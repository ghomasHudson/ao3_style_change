“How did I fuck myself over this badly?” Tony asked, turning abruptly to Rhodey. He could always count on Rhodey to see through 100% of his bullshit, and in a way it was a relief to talk about it with him. “He’s one of my best friends, who I’ve known for years, and is a minimum of 150% straight, and now I’m being forced to live a life of fake marital bliss—”
“No, it’s not.” Steve hands tightened, hanging by his belt. “Everything’s different now…if something happened to you…”
“Y-yeah,” Tony replied.
Steve bit his lip. He got up and walked into the kitchen with Tony following on his heels. “Look, it’s fine. He never has to find out. We’ll just—”
Steve staggered backwards as if he’d been hit in the stomach and put his hand to his earpiece. “Guys, we’re not done yet—there’s still someone here. I need you to regroup.”
“Whoa,” Rhodey said with a laugh. “You don’t know he’s straight. He could be just as much of an idiot as you are and never got the courage to do anything about it.”
“What scares me more is the idea that maybe none of this would’ve happened. If we had never found him after the battle, or if we had but we hadn’t been able to adopt him…”
“Tony, what’s going on?” Pepper asked.
“How did you sleep?” Steve asked quietly, and Tony tried not to laugh at the ridiculousness of the question.
Tony’s phone buzzed. Hulk, Jan and Sam were beginning to help Miles build something out of blocks. Steve and Peter had just sat down with them. Carol and Rhodey had just come back and were catching up with Thor and Natasha in the kitchen. Tony grinned to himself as he turned away and picked up the call.
"Oh." Tony paused. "No. God no." He grabbed the back of Steve's head and pulled him into a kiss, fumbling with the door behind him and pulling Steve after him into his--their?--room. Steve pulled off his jacket and then went back to kissing Tony in earnest. Tony pushed him back on the bed, as much as you could push a supersoldier anywhere.
Tony laughed in surprise. “You already are.” He looked up at Steve, who was smiling slightly. “But yeah… of course you can.” He shared another glance with Steve and Steve nodded. “We’ll train you,” Tony finished. “But no vigilante-ing until you’re at least sixteen, okay?”
“Look, the first time me and Carol kissed, it just kind of happened. It was the right moment. You never know. It was…one of those moments when you think you might not see someone again. I think that made us both a little braver.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve whispered. “I’m sorry. I let everyone down.”
“I mean, I know,” Peter replied, throwing his arms around both of their shoulders. “You guys still act married though.” Tony brushed a hand over his forehead. “I’m just so excited to be an older brother. I never thought of myself as a role model before--”
"Tony." Rhodey interrupted. "Who?"
It was Wanda. She was unconscious, but alive.
They all woke up around noon. After a long night of fighting, no one was prepared to do anything that day. Especially not Tony, who was feeling the bumps and bruises much more acutely now.
“I don’t want any Pym particles near my son, is that clear?”
“When did this happen?” she asked breathlessly.
“So what do you say, Stark?” he asked.
"Stay put, Rogers."
That night they went back to sleeping next to each other without touching, and Tony missed the solid feeling of Steve in his arms and the warmth. It had been a while since he slept that well.
“You know that’s not fair.”
“You okay?”
Tony did, and Rhodey agreed it probably wasn't the best idea to sleep in his bed. He looked so sad and concerned that Tony wished he hadn't confessed any of it in the first place. But Rhodey was right, and Tony figured he should break it off with Steve.
It went on like that, for a while. He worked and slept. He started to sleep better. A few times he woke up with his hand brushing against Steve’s shoulder or elbow, but for the most part they didn’t touch.
“Hey,” Tony said quietly. “I saw the article.”
It was always variations on this theme--he was alive and the others weren't. He was alive wishing he wasn't alone. He was on a battlefield surrounded by dead teammates and friends and Steve was asking him why he didn't do more to save them. He was a kid and his parents were gone and oh, how could you mourn someone who had treated you like
“He might be able to do other stuff too,” Sam added.
She smiled. “Thank you, Mr. Stark.”
Steve let out a laugh. “Enough about the past.” He leaned down and kissed Tony again.
Sam moved his head to look up into Steve’s face. “Okay…? What does that mean?”
—” He stopped, cutting off the anger in his voice. “I guess you didn’t know.” Tony’s heart wrenched at the guilt in Steve’s voice. “But I just need you to know I wouldn't—”
Steve let out a laugh and put a hand over his eyes.
Tony thought they’d go back to just lying side by side, except that later that night Steve wrapped Tony’s arms around him again. And the night after that, and the night after that.
Red Skull lunged at her, and Natasha yanked him back. Bucky nudged him roughly with his gun. "Make another move and I shoot you. You tried to kill my best friend."
Tony looked away like he had been slapped. He turned to go.
“I’m trying,” Steve said, and he sounded like he'd had the life drained out of him. “God, am I trying.”
Sam raised his eyebrows. “Told you.”
There was no need to say anything as they waited to see whether their mistakes would cost Steve his life.
Steve let out a small laugh. “Maybe you should.” Tony felt the tension in his chest begin to melt at the sound of Steve’s laugh--God, it had been so long since he heard it sound this genuine.
"I'm not afraid of monsters," Miles insisted, snuggling down farther under the blankets. "I'm a superhero."
“Ugh.”
“Always am. What’s up, Cap?”
“I could do this all day,” Steve replied, grinning as he took off his helmet, leaving his hair an unruly mess.
Steve bit his lip to stop smiling. “Okay. We’ll get those.”
He pulled Steve down into a kiss, and Steve moaned quietly as Tony pushed his shirt up to his chest. "It's not a big deal anyway, baby," Tony murmured. "Not unless you think it is."
Miles was still hiding behind Tony. “This is our son Miles,” Tony explained, and he couldn’t help but smile, looking down at the little boy clinging to him. Steve squeezed Tony’ shoulder, a little gesture of support.
you're powerful. And it looks like you barely broke a sweat. I owe you one. Big-time."
Steve reached down to take Tony’s hand and placed it on the side of his waist, just below the hem of his shirt, holding it there and rubbing it back and forth.
fault?”
Steve was quicker and stronger than he had been in weeks. It wasn’t long before Tony was out of breath. A few beads of sweat dripped down Steve’s forehead, but Tony was sweating hard. Tony shoved himself back from Steve to buy a moment of time, but then dropped his hands, opening the faceplate in defeat. But he wasn’t scared, not of Steve hurting him, not ever again.
“You’ve been out almost a week. Someone shot at you. Tony saved your life,” Sam replied, motioning across at him. “It was poisoned, although I’m sure you figured that part out if you feel anywhere near as awful as you look.”
--and the friction between their bodies felt too incredible to stop. Steve pulled Tony down into another deep, wonderful kiss and then rolled his head back and gasped his name as he came between their stomachs. Tony didn’t last after that, not when he was looking down at Steve looking like this. Not when Steve was
“I’m prepared,” Tony said suddenly. Steve turned to look at him. “I want to adopt him,” Tony continued, his voice firmer.
“Look, I don’t care when you were born. It’s the twenty-first century,” Tony snapped. “Are you telling me that it would bother you if Steve dated a guy?”
Steve was still in his uniform, bloodied, his shield tossed across his chest. Tony sat for hours next to him before even moving. He was numb down to the very core. He stared at Steve’s lifeless body, trying to understand what had happened, how he had let it happen. The air around Steve seemed to pulse. This wasn’t real. This was a nightmare.
“I did better than last time though.”
“I—okay. I’ll go. I’m sorry.”
"I thought you were just...hot," Tony stammered. "I mean, you are hot,
Tony nodded and looked down. “Then we’re gonna fix it, together. But for now, give me your hand.”
“That makes a funny noise!”
Carol pointed out that even if they put some regulations on unlicensed weapons technology, whoever had tried to assassinate Steve had infiltrated the police force. If the Avengers wanted accountability they couldn't do it blindly. They couldn't trust that they were always working with the right people. They couldn't always act within the law if the law was enforced by people dangerous to them.
“My…my mom always got raspberry ice cream,” Miles said quietly. Tony followed his gaze to a little boy and his mother standing on the beach hand in hand.
Rhodey shrugged, smiling to himself. Steve said in a low voice, “Are you and Carol…?”
“Hey, it’s okay,” he whispered, resting his chin over the top of Miles’ head. Tony gritted his teeth as he felt tears sting his own eyes. He remembered exactly what it felt like after he lost his own mother. If there was one thing he could do, it was show Miles that he didn’t have to do this alone.
Steve looked down, sadness showing in his eyes. “So what’s your plan here?” Anger tinged his voice. “You want to make sure I don’t die during the night, but other than that…”
When Tony pushed his shirt up, Steve arched his back with a groan, head falling back on the pillows. Tony was kissing his neck in an instant, one hand massaging the muscles on Steve's chest, the other reaching down to palm him through his sweatpants. Steve made a low strangled sound, grinding up into Tony's hand. He yanked Tony's shirt up his back to his ears, and then Tony was fumbling momentarily to pull it off and over his head, and then they were right back to it, Steve's fingers pulling at the roots of Tony's hair as they kissed.
He saw her nod from across the room. She looked at Red Skull and came to rest on the floor in front of him. "We don't have to fear you anymore." With a strand of magic, she lifted the Time Stone. "Time caught up with you at last."
The mixture of aggravation, affection and arousal in Steve's voice was enough to make Tony's head spin, and really, why was he trying to talk Steve
“Hulk angry too,” the Hulk grumbled, smashing his fist against his other hand.
“This isn’t the kind my mama gets,” Miles said matter-of-factly when Steve sat down next to him on the couch with the bowl of cereal and a spoon.
you're hot, what I mean is--"
Suddenly the shape in Steve’s arms became visible, his face still buried in Steve’s chest as he cried. Jan landed on Tony’s shoulder, her face drawn with worry. “Let’s get him to the Avenger’s tower and then figure out what to do,” she murmured to Tony.
He busied himself by making Steve breakfast. He remembered exactly how he liked his eggs, and hoped Steve wouldn't think it was awful that be could make him breakfast like they hadn't just been on opposing sides of a war.
“Yesterday when we were building robots Dad said—”
Tony let out a laugh and looked down.
“What did you—“
“It’s okay,” Steve whispered with a bit of a laugh, closing his arm around Tony’s shoulders. “Sorry I was gone so long today. Fury needed me.”
“Things changed.”
, Cap?” Tony asked and Steve shook his head.
Steve smiled. “Better after getting some fresh air and a run. Sometimes you can’t punch everything out.”
“I’m so sorry, Sam,” Steve whispered, and pulled him into a hug.
Each noise he made into Tony's mouth made Tony's insides twist. He fumbled with his own fly-- why had he fallen asleep in these pants, honest to God, could he wear something more comfortable to bed--
"This a case of good cop bad cop?" Tony asked, pointing at Bucky. "I get why Sam is the good cop. Handsome, funny, doesn't sneak up on people."
"Sure we should get your heart rate up like this?"
Karen glanced up at Tony in surprise. “Nice to meet you Miles.”
“No, I’m good,” Tony said replied with a forced smile, and he heard Sam begin to laugh behind him. Natasha was smiling. They all needed a laugh. He turned to see Steve standing next to Sam, a small smile on his face. He had just come back from his own training with Sam and Bucky.
He hadn’t asked his teammates before he did it. The thought that they might be disappointed in him had crossed his mind, but he didn’t care anymore. He still believed they needed some oversight--but not when Steve might die for this. Never. Nothing was worth Steve's life.
Tony groaned and lay back down.
And Steve kissed back. He kissed
After a long day, Tony fell asleep on the couch in between Nat and Rhodey watching Miles’ favorite cartoon. The rest of the Avengers were somewhere else in the tower, except Hulk, who Miles had chosen as his large green pillow of choice.
Carol passed a hand over her forehead and reached for Rhodey’s hand. “What are we going to do?”
“I know you are.” She placed a hand on his shoulder and Tony put his hand over it. He had missed her after they broke up—he had missed her so much. It had been a long time since he didn’t have that hollow feeling in his chest of missing someone.
Red Skull evaded Wanda's magic again and again, easily deflecting Bucky and Sam's gunfire and the occasional blast from Tony’s repulsors as he guarded Pietro. Pietro was sweating and shaking with effort. He had only managed to move a few feet backwards. It would be hard to win the battle when they were fighting on the defensive, especially as more Hydra agents joined the fight. Part of the wall had come down, crushing a few men, but there were more coming to replace them.
Tony came forward and knelt down beside Steve, his heart aching in his chest. “Hey Miles,” he said quietly. “I’m Tony. And this is Steve—he’s one of the best we’ve got. You’re safe with us. We promise nothing’s gonna happen to you.”
"Were not saying goodbye. Kiss me after the battle."
“And I mean, I may not be green anymore, but I still feel really angry about how people are taking the news.”
Steve took a few sips of water and then laid back down, sighing.
“Anything horrible in the papers today?” Steve asked.
“That I’m gay for my best friend? Well, bi, technically,” Tony clarified.
“I didn’t think this through, okay?”
“Part of being a superhero is eating a good breakfast,” Tony explained to Miles. “Have some eggs too.”
Tony's visuals confirmed the same thing. "Looks like twenty or so, some stationed in front of a room, some inside, others are patrolling the area around it."
Tony whirled to her, his face tight, eyes wide with panic. “Keep your voice down. Jesus Christ.”
“Breakfast?” Tony asked, and Steve made an effort to get out of bed. Tony noticed that someone had brought him a change of clothes, his usual sweatpants and t-shirt.
Steve groaned and Tony glanced at him, thinking about what Bucky had said. Steve looked up, noticing Tony’s gaze.
Rhodey laughed and shook his head. “All logic goes out the window.”
They fell into silence, catching their breath. Sam reached over and put a hand on Steve’s shoulder. “I just want to say, man, that I’m so glad you’re okay.” Steve looked up. “I didn’t wanna…bring it up before. I just wanted you to focus on getting better. But I want you to know, I-I couldn’t handle losing you. Not after Riley.” Sam dropped his hand, smiling through the pain written on his face.
She raised her eyebrows in surprise. “Oh. Well, it’s…it’s just something I started doing recently.” She brushed her blonde hair behind her ear. “I guess it’s important to me to tell the stories no one else can.”
Tony narrowed her eyes. “Yeah, I’m not a prude. You should try it sometime. Having fun. Look, you just seem like you’re going crazy cooped up in here. Get out more. It’d be good for you.”
“I don’t understand,” Sam began. “That thing was your baby. And you just…threw it away.”
"Noted."
Tony spent the night sitting beside Steve’s bed, and finally fell into a fitful sleep, collapsed on the arm of the chair.
“Better,” Tony agreed, with begrudging admiration. “But there’s still nothing I really need to say.”
He asked quietly, "How you feeling, Cap?"
“I still haven’t thanked you,” Tony began.
“It looks like he’s just hanging onto the surface. I don’t think invisibility is his only deal.” Tony opened his faceplate, rubbing his chin as he looked over at Sam. “Hey Sam, I got an idea. Gimme your goggles.”
Sreve raised his eyebrows and breathed out, as if letting a huge weight off his shoulders. "I know."
Eve glanced up from Tony’s mouth. “What about tomorrow?”
“Language,” Steve murmured, and Tony could hear rather than see the smile on his face.
He sent a blast of energy up at Steve but Steve rolled out of the way and then slammed him back down. Tony’s suit sparked and crackled. POWER LOW.
Tony knew that Steve must have felt the serum weaken—he had felt himself begin to fade away. Tony had thought that there was no way he could live, but Steve probably known it in a way that couldn’t have felt more certain. Tony knew exactly how it felt to face that cold inevitability: when Stane had ripped out his arc reactor and left him paralyzed on the floor, he had been helpless, sure he would die there.
Steve shook his head, smiling. “I don’t think he’ll mind.”
"Which one?" Tony grumbled.
“Aww man, you win every time.”
Sam and Bucky exchanged a glance and Bucky turned away to hide his face, pacing back and forth in front of the door.
“Did Uncle Peter make this for you?” Steve asked in disbelief.
He stared at Steve’s face as if he could will him alive again. “I thought I knew what the worst thing would be,” he reasoned, “I thought I’d be ready. For the end. And now the worst thing has happened. The thing I can’t live with…has happened.” The tears drying on his cheeks felt cold.
Miles snuggled into Tony’s chest once he had finished his ice cream.
It took a few times, Tony watching Steve's face worriedly. Steve lay back down on the pillows, exhausted. “Tony—” he started.
There was a pause and then Steve said, “She’s missing.”
“You were right, Steve,” Sam said, a hand on his shoulder. “Civilians were getting hurt. That’s not what any of us wanted when we started this.”
Steve sat down on the side of the bed. He shrugged. “That wasn’t the worst part,” he said quietly. He looked up after a moment to Tony, who was silent, waiting. “No, what was worse…” Steve began, “I didn’t want to go back. I had already lost my family, my best friend, even Peggy…I had made peace with the idea that I was giving my life in the service of my country. I was ready to die. But I didn’t get to,” he whispered. Tony realized he looked furious, his expression as still as stone.
Tony raised his eyebrows. “Yep.”
Wanda snarled, finally separating Pietro from Red Skull in the next instant. As Bucky, Steve, Natasha and Sam converged on Red Skull, Wanda landed by Pietro.
“Yeah, whatever he did must’ve taken a lot out of him.” Tony gently pressed the icepack to Steve’s side and held it there. “Relax, Cap. Just lie back.”
"Where were you hiding, Captain?" Red Skull hissed, whirling to Steve as Natasha held him in place. "We looked everywhere."
It was the middle of the night when Tony heard a noise from Steve’s room. He opened the door to see Steve pale, sitting up in bed, coughing. He rushed to his side.
“See?” Steve said to Miles, still holding Tony’s hand. “Don’t worry. Your Dad and I are just fine.”
Tony let out a laugh. “Only if you’re planning on catching me.”
“You trained the least out of everyone.”
He opened the faceplate. “Hey, Steve, wait, can we—”
Tony sat down on the couch in exhaustion, his head in his hands. He was starting to get a headache.
Tony swallowed. “But that wasn’t enough for you.” It wasn’t an accusation—it was an apology.
"Oh my God. I have more stamina than you on a bad day. Fuck you."
“I’m going to hold you to it. Let’s go meet Miles.” Natasha pulled the giant Asgardian after her.
“I thought you—I didn’t—I didn’t know—”
“How bad is it?” she said in a low voice.
“It doesn’t take a genius to figure that out,” Natasha teased. “Come on, Stark, use the jiu jitsu I’ve been teaching you.”
“Hey buddy,” Tony said. “Let’s get you something to eat.”
Steve smiled smugly underneath him. "Make me, then."
Steve looked at him for a moment as if he was considering something, and then looked away.
Sam finally sat down, laughing. “Seriously, you okay?”
“What was the one thing you wanted to tell me?”
“Well, congratulations,” she replied, smiling at Tony and Steve. “It was nice to meet you and your son. Sorry to interrupt.”
Bucky raised his eyebrows. “Is there something you need to tell me?”
“Miles?” Steve said, looking up in the kid’s direction even though he couldn’t see him. Tony saw the boy’s face turn to look at Steve.
"Saved your ass," Steve said with a smirk. "Now you can worry about saving mine."
"With pleasure."
“What happened?” Steve whispered, glancing at Sam and Bucky.
Sam hugged him back hard. “I wouldn’t ever have gotten a chance to beat your ass at running if you’d died on me,” he murmured, tears stinging his eyes.
Tony’s eyes widened slightly and he glanced up at Sam and Natasha. “Well…” He looked back down at Miles. “They don’t like people who are different.”
Steve breathed out and looked down, but then reluctantly met Tony’s eyes. Slowly, his eyes flickered down to Tony’s lips and then back up. Tony’s head was buzzing, and he wasn’t sure he wasn’t hallucinating 100% of this. Before he lost all his resolve, he leaned up and kissed Steve on the mouth.
“Hey,” Tony complained, but couldn’t help but smile.
“Yes!” Peter leapt over to Miles. “Come on, little Spider-bro. We’re going to have a blast while the grown-ups are gone.”
“I’m working on it, Pep.”
They drank coffee at the kitchen table together, watching Clint show Miles how to make arrows. Bucky walked over and stood directly in front of him, arms folded.
. I don’t just get to be friends with you after everything that happened, that was
Tony rubbed his eyes. “Unconventional, yeah.”
Steve joined them, slamming another Hydra agent away with his shield, and Bucky knelt in cover near them, sniping off a man climbing over the rubble.
Something in Tony snapped. “NOTHING is more important to me right now than you,” he said, whirling to face Steve. “Definitely not some stupid document. But that didn’t stop me from almost getting you killed." He buried his face in his hands, unable to look at any of them. “I’m sorry, Steve, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry,” he whispered. He felt a hand on his, and looked up.
God, he was getting tired of this.
“I'm okay, buddy. How long have I been
Steve set his shield down on the ground and sat down below the overhang. “I know you don’t know me, but I lost my parents when I was young, just like you.” He glanced back at Tony and held up his hand, gesturing for them to stay back. “I know what you’re going through. I want to help.”
“I thought he was dead,” Clint interjected, glancing at Nat.
“Hospital. You’re safe,” Tony said.
“Why would you want me to?” Steve asked carefully.
"I'm being serious. We're more than that, and you're the one who showed me. Not just by saving my life, but my staying here, even when things were tough. Love...was something I thought I could move on from, but I don't want to let this go. I'm sick of missing my chance. Don't you trust me?"
It was getting late.
behind the carefully schooled expression on his face and Tony realized it was scared. Of course he was scared. He was scared of the possibility that Tony would say, no, I don't believe you, I don't trust that you could love me after what you've done.
“I’ll fix this up by the morning, just in case, you know…we get any surprises.”
Miles looked down. “But you’re the best. You can even fly!”
“Pretty much.”
Usually jokes like that earned him a smile or laugh from Steve, but this time he was silent, staring at the floor. Tony dropped his hand from Steve’s shoulder. “I promise I’ll be careful, okay?”
Sam and Steve both loaded up plates full of food. Steve hung back after Sam went to sit down, glancing at Tony. “You in the lab all day?” he asked quietly.
"That I look like a mess. I know.” Tony smiled slightly.
Tony let out a short laugh and sighed as he relaxed under the pleasant weight of Steve’s body.
“Bucky’s a big fan,” Tony said with a wave of his hand. He looked at Steve. “Hey.”
“What he said,” Sam murmured, smiling slightly, and Steve started coughing, lifting an arm weakly to his mouth before Helen quickly gave him a cup of water.
“Look, I’m sorry, Cap. I know they said a lot of awful stuff about you.”
Steve grinned and Tony pulled him into a kiss, wrapping his arms around Steve's waist.
“And then all I had to do was change the pattern to fit him and voila, mini Spiderman!” Peter explained as he walked in between Tony and Steve. “He picked out the color scheme and everything.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Point taken.”
“My marriage is a sham,” Tony said as he plopped down on the couch next to Rhodey, who was playing a video game with Carol.
“Looks like it,” Natasha replied with a smile. “Hey Miles, bet you can’t find me if I hide! But you have to count to ten first.”
“Miles thought—”
Miles reached up and grabbed one of the muffins from the counter and took a huge bite. “Mmmff, can I have another one?”
Tony felt the prick of tears behind his eyes and shut his eyes tightly until it went away. He looked up at Steve coldly. “I got you killed. I didn’t almost get you killed—you were dead. You
Jesus. No wonder the poison had been powerful. Tony was in awe of Steve's recovery and Helen's antidote all over again.
Tony didn't know how many hours later Steve returned, only that he did, and he looked worse than Tony felt. If that was even possible. His face was red, but drawn, and his expression hard as stone. He looked tired as the grave.
“Hey, be careful,” he said in a low voice, hand still on Tony’s arm.
“Mom always liked superheroes. She said I was her little superhero,” Miles whispered.
Rhodey and Natasha came in and collapsed on the sofas and Tony got to his feet and ran into the living room. It had been another late night mission. They had learned the hard way that they had to take turns fighting these battles.
“Not yet," Steve admitted with a fond roll of his eyes. He put his arm around Bucky's shoulders.
“Hey, how is the whole adoption thing coming along?”
Steve added, "But it feels a lot better to do it together."
Tony kissed him again, and Steve’s lips parted under his, warm and soft. He rolled Tony over onto his back, pulling away slowly, his mouth still open as he looked down at Tony’s lips.
They had to childproof the tower.
Steve raised his eyebrows, looking a little bit too smug. "So it worked?"
awake?”
Tony winced. “Yes? Ouch.”
“How long before the kid finds out? That’ll break his little heart all over again.”
Tony wiped his tears away quickly. “Makes two of us,” he spat out, instantly hating how bitter the words tasted in his mouth.
“Favorite tiny Avenger.”
“Tony,” Eve whispered, and Tony hummed in response, holding the back of Eve’s neck as she kissed down to the collar of her shirt.
?” Clint yelled. “They’ll throw us in jail if you surrender!”
Tony tried not to smile, pursing his lips.
"Steve needs you sober."
Tony still hadn’t told anyone about it. He’d gotten so close to telling Pepper. He hadn't seen her since she’d visited, and they only spoke briefly on the phone. It was on the tip of his tongue, but he never managed to say it.
“As long as Iron Man brings me Tony Stark back in one piece.”
“No, just listen to me, baby,” Tony interrupted, pulling back to look into his eyes. “The one thing I should have told you…” This wasn’t just his second chance with Steve, it was something more like his third or fourth, something he had thought he in no way deserved or could have hoped for. The expression on Steve’s face melted from resignation to confusion, then disbelief, and something that was almost tentative hope.
Wanda waited for him to look at her. When he finally met her eyes again, she spoke. "We did this. It's over." Tony tried to stop his lips from trembling and Wanda said, "It's okay."
“Dad,” Miles complained. “I want to fight bad guys now. I know, I know, I’ll wait until I’m older, but—”
“It seems…for the best,” she murmured. “It’s out of any of your hands now.”
Eve grinned at that, and dropped her hand to her side. Tony studied her face—Eve blushed a bit.
Bucky put a hand on Tony’s shoulder. “Wait a sec. You know how much Steve cares about you.” His voice was quiet but firm. “He adopted a kid with you without a second thought. He wouldn’t make that decision if he didn’t think you were the right person. He’s told me…what it was like waking up after the war, and how you were the first person who was there for him. I know he’s grateful for that, but you know I am too.”
“I know you,” Pepper added, “and I know how you like to beat yourself up. You have to stop beating yourself up about this, for your own sake and everyone else’s.”
“Why are we doing this again?”
And the truth of the matter was, knowing that Steve cared about him—somehow enough to forgive him—didn’t mean that Tony didn’t feel guilty. But it made him feel like there must be something good in him that Steve saw, something worthy. He would regret and mourn what had happened, but he’d keep going because of Steve’s faith in him, and because he knew Steve bitterly regretted hurting him. It didn’t make it go away, but it meant they could go forward.
Steve stopped and was silent for a moment. “Hey,” Tony murmured, wrapping his arms around Steve’s shoulders. Steve smiled, wiping away his tears angrily.
“Mmf. Fine.”
“Not fair, man, I can only do one thing at a time.” He grinned. “Things are good.”
“Excuse me—”
“Because I don’t understand what happened,” Steve shot back, folding his arms. “You would have done anything to stop me before.”
Steve looked down. “It’s…different, but...”
Miles nodded shyly.
Bucky set the glass down, still filled with ice. "Metabolism. Whiskey doesn't do much for me since the war."
“No,” Steve replied, signaling Tony to stand down. “I’m fine, Tony. Whatever hit me was small. I’m betting it was just a kid.”
Tony took another step forward, about to speak. But it was Steve who broke the silence.
doesn’t die easy. At some point I started not wanting to go back in the ice. I had a family. And then, the courthouse…I’m not ready to die, not anymore. I'm not done."
Pepper raised her eyebrows. “Oh, yeah. Yeah. We are.”
Natasha smiled sadly and shrugged. "I said I had believed what I was doing was right but…" She trailed off. "Clint knows that I…" She sighed and shook her head. "I tried to apologize to him for my part in this, and he said, 'don't take all the blame yourself, Nat, leave some for the rest of us.'" She hummed a bit of a laugh. "You and me, we always wanted to believe that there’s a right side to be on, some sort of redemption at the end of all this to right our wrongs, but I'm starting to think in this one there’s only losers."
“You’ll be back there in no time,” Sam said, elbowing him in the stomach. “Hey, what about that run? I think it’s overdue.”
She was looking at him like he had been shot, Tony realized humorlessly. It was so funny because the thought had crossed his mind that it should have been him.
He glanced aside to where Wanda's red magic roared with power, pushing against the green of the Time Stone. She was grimacing with effort, but she was also standing in the face of an entire Infinity Stone and giving back everything she got. The room buzzed with electricity and tension, the walls vibrating. The battle had stretched on too long.
time," Steve interrupted. "Wanda was right: time’s caught up with you.” With that, he punched Red Skull hard across the face.
“We do.”
Tony dropped the newspaper in front of Steve gleefully. “This is a hole you dug for yourself, Cap.”
The poison still in Steve's body affected him in fits of pain, nausea, difficulty breathing. It was hard to tell which were conditions caused by the poison or the serum being repressed. It was disturbing for Tony to see Steve reluctant to even go on a walk, but he was grateful that Sam and Bucky were just as concerned as he was. It almost felt like he wasn't needed. Which was fine.
, okay, Cap, I guess I'm getting too old for this."
"Thought I'd find you up here," Natasha said, sitting down next to Tony on the edge of the roof. The city glowed below them through the darkness. Tony had flown up here to get some fresh air and clear his head--alone--but who was he kidding, Natasha's company was always welcome.
“Miles.” From his voice, he sounded like he couldn’t be more than five or six years old.
Pepper pursed her lips. “You didn’t have to tell me. I’m just…he’s perfect for you, Tony. I know you know that.”
Nat had just thrown Tony for probably the hundredth time on the mat. He groaned and got up, massaging his shoulder.
The punch broke his faceplate.
When he was finished working he suited up. The analysis of the poison had been successful. After that, it was just a matter of tracking sales of its components and matching them with sales of the materials used to make the bullet that had been left on the courthouse steps. There weren’t a lot of substances that could pierce bullet-proof armor. Black market deals of vibranium used to be Tony’s area, so that wasn’t a problem.
“Tony—” Steve started.
And then he was holding his head in his hands, crying silently, and Pepper was holding him—sweet, kindhearted, forgiving Pepper who still somehow loved him after all this.
Steve opened his eyes again, tired, pale and drawn. He looked at Tony, as long and hard as he could, still holding his hand. It looked like just the effort exhausted him. “I’m tired of arguing. Don’t argue with me on this.”
So he was picturing Tony's bloodied face below him on the battlefield as he begged for Steve to end it all. Tony pulled him closer, curling his arm around his back and squeezing his shoulder, burying his face in his hair. He held Steve as tight as he could, squeezing his eyes shut. He wanted to say,
Rhodey elbowed Tony. “So is this final?” he asked. Miles clamored down from Sam’s shoulders and looked up at Rhodey in awe.
“Awwww man, you know that’s kind of like watching your mom and dad kissing,” Peter complained.
“Me and Rhodey have our own super-secret flyers-only training session in a bit. Sorry Cap.”
Eventually Carol sent them all to bed. "You're heading out in the early morning. I suggest you all get a few hours of sleep."
“Tired from your workout or got some energy left?” Tony murmured, sliding her hands down over Eve’s ass. Eve groaned and Tony leaned in and kissed her open mouth. “My room’s on the floor up from this one,” Tony added breathlessly. “I’ve got no plans for the rest of the day if--”
“Hulk like tiny Avenger.”
“Hey, Tony.”
Steve started to hang out in Tony’s lab, and he brought his sketchbook like he used to. It wasn’t every day, but he was there so often Tony assumed it was him when he heard the door open.
Tony looked away again, tugging his hand away from Steve. “You’re a stubborn motherfucker, I’ll give you that.”
Tony nearly had a heart attack, jumping out of his chair. Helen Cho stood in the doorway to the hospital room.
“Yeah?”
It wasn’t normal after that, far from it, but things were more comfortable between them. Not just Tony and Steve, but the whole team—if that’s something they still were.
Miles got up and bolted from the room.
It had been after they fought Ultron. The flight to Korea had been long. Tony had been the only one who thought it was a good idea. Pietro had been dead, but acceptance was never Tony’s strong suit.
"I know…it must have been tough, waking up to a completely different world, and you couldn’t go back—I-I can’t even imagine how much. But we’ll fight him together, send him back where he belongs, if that can make anything better—”
“But then I met you,” Steve whispered. “Sam, Nat. I got Bucky back again…” he let out a bitter laugh. “I guess
“Okay,” Miles replied, hopping down onto the floor and hugging Tony. Tony motioned quickly for Steve to join and Steve smiled and knelt down to wrap his arms around both of them.
“Go and tell her about your boyfriend, man,” Rhodey said with a grin.
“Okay,” Tony said lamely.
He felt like he’d grown closer to Natasha in the past week than in the years they had fought side by side.
“So you
Steve glanced sideways at Tony. “I…guess you’re right.”
“I mean, they can still technically pass it,” he continued. “It’s just going to be useless without the information.”
“Tony,” Steve started, and Tony was instantly on edge.
“No,” Miles replied, shaking his head. “I don’t want to. I-I want my parents.”
"Good. I'm gonna hold you to it."
But mostly, as he lay his head on top of Wanda's, he thought about how the woman in his arms was brave and powerful enough that she had saved Tony's whole world.
Tony did a double take and then turned to Jan. “Make sure that my child doesn’t die. Okay?”
Sam looked up at Miles. “Don’t worry kid, we’ll figure it out.”
“I mean, Steve’s kind of your type.”
Steve’s brows furrowed slightly and he turned to Tony. He cupped the side of Tony’s head and leaned in to press a kiss to his cheek. Tony’s heart raced. “What the FUCK, Steve,” he whispered into Steve’s ear, and Steve kicked him under the table.
“That’s not going to improve your prospects with the ladies,” Clint added.
“So did you hear, they struck down the SRA?” he asked, not because he was trying to change the subject—maybe a little bit—but because he wanted to hear her opinion. “Too much trouble defining what it means to be superhuman.”
Tony noticed Jan talking to Steve the next day. After she said something he had hugged her a bit weakly, and then Natasha had come over to talk to him too. She was cautious, and didn’t push him, she just showed him that she was there, and Tony saw how much Steve had missed her. He tried not to wonder if Steve had missed him too.
“That’s cruel.”
“Yeah,” Rhodey sighed. “You don’t look too great either, you know.”
Steve let go of him and slowly stripped his shirt off over his head, looking Tony in the eye. “Come and get it.”
“Yes. Hence, my marriage is a sham.”
Steve stood frozen for a moment. Then he seemed to make a decision and came to Tony’s side. He knelt down between his legs on the floor and pulled him into his arms. Tony let out a shuddering sigh and dropped his head onto Steve’s shoulder. Steve rubbed his back gently, his hand eventually settling around Tony’s shoulders, squeezing slightly. They sat like that for a while, until Steve’s voice finally brought Tony back to reality.
Tony’s lips formed a thin line. “Really, there’s nothing to think about.”
Steve turned his head to look at Tony, and Tony felt his insides turn over. He was looking at him with a gratitude he hadn’t thought possible, but there was an undercurrent of confusion and doubt.
“I don’t date, Tony,” Steve sighed.
Steve turned back to him, looking him straight on. “Then how is it? Tell me.”
She flew up to the concrete hanging overhead as Tony flipped down his faceplate again. They saw her land on the underside of the building, holding on to the edge of a window next to the invisible boy.
Steve shook his head. “Inhaler,” he gasped.
“I know he’ll take really good care of you,” Pepper murmured. Tony knew she was thinking about everything that had come between them that had eventually led to them breaking up, including Tony’s recklessness and his tendency to get beaten up by supervillains.
“Mmmf.” Tony sat up to pull Steve’s shirt all the way up.
“Well, I called this, byyyyy the way,” Sam said, drawing a circle around Steve and Tony in the air with his finger. “
"Wouldn't want him becoming a workaholic like his dad, now would we?" Steve said dryly, smiling at Tony.
“Yeah?”
“Oh, shit.” Tony had just spotted Steve halfway to the Avenger’s jet, which was preparing for takeoff. “Gotta go. Assuming I’m free to go?”
"Skull is paying for this," Wanda breathed out in anger, turned and flew off to join the battle.
“We can’t just put him up for adoption,” Natasha said firmly. “There’s no guarantee he would even be adopted. Do you know what those agencies are like?”
“Don’t wake
Tony smiled at that. Carol watched his smile fade slowly until he had given up on the attempt entirely, and said, "Tony, you can't control what he does. You've done what you can."
He stiffened involuntarily, trying to shake the thoughts away. Steve stirred in response, arching his back as he stretched. The sleepy moan he let out made Tony almost choke.
Bucky, Sam and Nat played with Miles all afternoon. Eventually Miles wound up in Tony’s lab again and they spent hours lying on the floor together building things and taking them apart. Miles demanded explanations for everything he didn’t understand, and he wanted to know everything. Before Tony realized, Miles had made his own little spider-bot that scampered away under the table and refused to respond to voice commands, even though they had programmed them in.
if having sex with him again? Had he hit his head?
“Probably,” Tony groaned. “I definitely need to talk to you later.”
Steve’s back was pressed to Tony's chest, and Tony didn't know where to put his face, because nestling it tenderly at the back of Steve's neck seemed inappropriate.
Bucky looked up at Tony for a moment, and this time it was gratitude that showed in his eyes for just a moment, so brief Tony almost thought he was seeing things.
Tony blinked. “Steve, what the fuck—”
“Clint, what do you know about ladies,” Natasha murmured, smiling as she kissed him on the cheek. Clint shrugged and started blushing as he grinned at her.
“Yeah,” Steve replied with raised eyebrows. “Bffs already. That’s gonna be terrifying.”
Tony grumbled and moved over slightly. Steve’s shoulder was warm against his. “If I steal the covers, don’t let it end our fake marriage, okay honey?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Miles frowned. “But I won’t be eighteen in foreeeeverrrrr!”
With that, he got up and left the hospital.
“Ignore him, he’s always this grumpy in the morning,” Steve explained, leaning over and giving Tony a kiss on the cheek with a smile. “Hey Tony.”
Miles nodded, looking up at both of them. “Will you guys teach me how to fly?”
“Not coming back,” Miles whispered, curling away from Jan.
Steve looked down. “He looks up to you too, Tony.”
Tony smiled slightly. “I mean I guess our lives are pretty weird as it is.”
“Why’s that?”
“I know,” Jan said with a frown. “What’s taking Cap so long?”
Natasha’s brow drew down as she looked down at her hands. Tony knew she had been trying to fix her mistakes, doing what she thought was the right thing. And now they were on the other side, looking back. Regret was too weak a word for what Tony and Natasha felt, not when they had fought for redemption for so long just to see everything they had wanted fall apart. What did they say again? The road to hell was paved with good intentions. How come the better his intentions, the more he tried to take responsibility, the worse it all got?
Jan put her hands to her mouth. Miles covered eyes as he started crying, and Steve looked at Tony before taking a step forward. He took off his helmet.
“I panicked,” Steve replied, holding his head in his hands.
Sure, they kept bumping their noses into each other, and kissed until they couldn’t breathe, and all Tony’s attempts at dirty talk failed because Steve kept telling him to stop talking. “You’re no fun,” Tony gasped, as he ground his cock against Steve’s, watching Steve’s abdomen tense as he breathed under the rhythm of Tony’s hand. Steve telling him to shut the fuck up as he lay there panting, gorgeous and messy, made Tony want to joke about something better to do with his mouth, but there would be plenty of time to blow Steve later--
He waited in silence for Tony to look at him, fidgeting with his hands. When he knew he finally had Tony’s attention, he took a deep breath.
Miles nodded.
a good man,” Tony murmured. “The best I’ve ever known. We all make mistakes. I know that better than anyone."
"You know I like a challenge."
Tony looked away from Bucky, turning to Steve. “What do you want? If you want to hide out in Stark Tower, you’re more than welcome. I’ll make myself scarce.”
“You okay?”
“I know you were the one who paid the bail,” she said. “Although T’Challa didn’t need it since he has diplomatic immunity.”
“Recently married,” Tony explained. “Private ceremony. You know, that kind of thing. I’m sorry, we don’t have time to answer a lot of questions—”
Steve snorted. “I think maybe that’s why we got into this mess.”
“I’ll make the pancakes,” Tony offered. He lifted Miles up on to the counter while Bucky began braiding Natasha’s hair, and Janet joined in and started French braiding his.
When they stopped in the cover of some trees in view of the building, Tony came up at Steve's side.
“I’m okay,” Steve reassured them, standing unsteadily. “Let’s go.” He started towards the door, bracing himself against the wall, looking like he was seconds from blacking out.
“We didn’t account for civilians with superpowers,” Steve replied quietly.
“I want pancakes,” Natasha called, sitting behind Thor on the couch and beginning to braid his hair. “With syrup!”
longer than that.
“Yeah, I do,” Eve murmured, looking up into Tony’s eyes. She raised an eyebrow. “Besides, you said a stick-in-the-mud like me could be a good influence.”
“Slacker? I trained a little bit,” Clint complained, but Natasha just looked over and shook her head.
Tony groaned. “What, am I supposed to have planned this since I was ten? Make lists of names if I have a boy or a girl? Because guess what, Steve, this one already has a name.”
Steve bit his lip and tried to give Tony a serious look. “I don’t have enough to take you on a honeymoon, Tony. If anyone should be paying for the honeymoon it’s you.”
“I didn’t know you wanted a family,” Steve murmured, folding his arms.
“Hey, kid,” Tony murmured, handing Wanda a smoothie.
They rounded the corner. Steve smashed the guard stationed at the door with his shield and kicked down the old wooden planks with a crash.
“That would be so cool!” Miles’ eyes were wide. “Like a spider! Then I’ll really be Spiderman!”
“It’s not fair.”
Bucky shrugged. “Fine. But seriously, why is there a kid—”
He looked up through his tears to see Steve, alive and unharmed. Tony processed this slowly as if through a fog.
“Or maybe you’ll learn how to swing between buildings like Peter,” Jan added. “That’s a lot like flying too!”
“Hi Dad, hi Pops,” Miles called.
She’d thought she had found on one of the government’s storage facilities for Stark equipment, and so she had gone alone, knowing she could take out any opposition she met. There were crates stacked high along the wall, like she’d expected. She passed by them, drawn to the end of the room, and stopped short.
“Tony, I..."
“Cap? I don’t think I’ve ever seen you in bed this late. Did hell freeze over?”
“Since right now,” Tony replied defensively.
“No,” he mumbled, “I'm still sleeping.”
“Hey, Tony. I didn’t mean to wake you.”
"Right. I don't want him getting away," Steve gritted between his teeth.
Bucky looked back and forth between them. “O…kay? Well the kid is climbing up the walls, just so you know.”
“You’ve been avoiding me.”
After a while Steve began breathing easier. He exhaled a few uneven breaths.
“This is
Wanda let out a laugh. “You wouldn’t?”
Sam walked directly to him and Tony half expected him to punch him hard across the face. Instead, Sam stopped in front of him and nodded.
Thor made his hands into fists. “I like it! Where can we start?”
“Really, was it that bad?”
Tony felt a small body squeeze itself in between him and Steve and cracked one eye open. “Huh? Miles?”
It killed him to see Steve like this, but at the same time, he had never imagined a week ago that he’d be sitting here at Steve’s bedside, watching him wake up—that he’d be alive and okay.
Steve turned to Jan. “If he saw half of what just happened with Galactus, he’s going to be terrified. He doesn’t know we’re the good guys. Hulk, maybe it would be a good idea if you took a few steps back. No offense.”
, can’t you just try to see—”
“It’s me, Tony,” Pepper said. “I came to say hi.”
He took Tony’s hand and pulled it over his side as he turned his back again. Tony’s heart thudded in his chest and he closed his eyes and then opened them--Steve brought his hand all the way around to hold his waist, pulling Tony closer, and then lifted his shoulders, as if he expected Tony to put his arm underneath. So Tony wrapped his other arm around Steve and felt him settle back down with another sigh.
Natasha rested her hand on his shoulder. “It’s not your fault, Tony,” she murmured.
He closed his eyes, but sat up abruptly as he felt someone else get into bed next to him.
When he and Steve were finally alone Tony leaned in and kissed his cheek, pulling away slowly and watching the smile spread on Steve's face.
Sam soared in front of Red Skull, keeping Skull's eyes off Natasha as Wanda held him with her magic. Natasha swug herself into position and immediately dropped from the ceiling onto Red Skull's shoulders, wrapping a cord around his neck.
“You should come meet Miles sometime.”
Miles nodded solemnly. “But can I wear my Spiderman backpack or will that give me away?”
Tony rested his head against Steve’s chest. “Could’ve been worse. Could’ve been Pepper."
Once he has found something in Steve's nightstand to use as lubrication--which was a brand he didn't even recognize and looked terribly old fashioned--and slipped Steve's sweatpants down over his hips, and Steve had muttered something about how he couldn't catch anything so he shouldn't worry about protection--
Eve’s mouth curved into a small smile and she turned a darker shade of pink. “You are. It’s just I’m trying to ask you out.”
Steve raised his eyebrows. “You really didn’t think I could be bi?”
Tony grinned back, but found her eyes falling to Eve's lips again. She glanced away. “So you’re keeping an eye on me, huh?”
“It’s very fair. It’s extremely fair.”
Wanda smiled as her eyes began to glow. "My brother and I have got this."
Tony glanced at Steve. “You know I had a crush on you from the minute I saw you in the ice.”
Tony looked abruptly away and let her words settle into the silence. "Isn't this a terrible idea? All of us being around each other again, just pretending nothing happened, never able to fix things?"
“C’mere.” Tony motioned for Steve to follow him. He led Steve to Miles’ room and pushed the door open. “Just look at him.”
Tony flipped through a few different designs he'd been working on. A text from Rhodey read
“Hey. We’ve gone on hundreds of missions just like this before. It’s going to be fine. It’s the same—”
Miles nodded and jumped impatiently.
Steve shook his head. “Not if we’re putting innocent lives in danger. That’s not what I wanted when I started this. They’re the ones we’re trying to protect, Sam.”
“This conversation is not over,” Rhodey pointed out, pulling Tony into a hug.
Steve gave him a confused look and turned away, sighing as he slumped over the edge of the boxing ring.
“Oh, I am.”
Red Skull whirled and enveloped Pietro in the green magic of the Time Stone. Wanda flew towards them, intercepting with her own magic as they watched Pietro slow and slow until he was frozen in the Time Stone's green light.
Tony grinned. “Yeah…he’s perfect.”
“Are we okay?” he asked quietly.
“I’ve felt better,” Steve replied quietly, and Tony’s mouth quirked up in a humorless smile.
And that’s when Sam opened the door.
“Call me Tony.” He waved a goodbye as they walked back to Stark Tower.
I super appreciate comments of any length! <3
“Sure,” Tony said with a shrug, glancing at Steve, who was biting his lip.
That’s why Tony was surprised one morning when he woke up late and found that Steve was still lying next to him, looking exhausted.
He came back from the bathroom and got back into bed, turning off the light. Tony moved over instinctively and Steve turned his back to him. Tony heard Steve breath out a long sigh, and then saw the silhouette of his shoulder drop slightly as he turned over.
He huddled down against the couch as if he could bury his feelings in it. The unsettled feeling in the pit of his stomach was worse now, and he turned onto his side and breathed raggedly. A panic attack, now, really? He fumbled for his phone, hesitated for a moment, and then dialed.
They headed home.
"He's...okay I think," Wanda breathed, shaken, looking into Pietro's panicked, frozen eyes. "But it's like Red Skull just
As soon as they landed at Stark Tower, Steve knocked impatiently on Tony’s faceplate. Tony opened it immediately and pulled him into another kiss, hard at first but then slow as they pulled away, grinning at each other. They were both exhausted, sweaty, covered in dirt and scrapes and bruises, but neither of them cared.
He didn’t have anything particularly witty to say after staring at Steve’s bare chest, so he just said, “I hate you.”
Steve bit his lip. "I thought, maybe, if you were...you know, if there was a chance you were into guys, I thought taking my shirt off when we train would be a good…strategy."
Of course Steve would talk shit in bed, what had he expected?
Tony turned back to Steve, trying not to laugh, but it was difficult with Sam cackling behind him. “And you know what else you didn’t do? You never took me on a honeymoon.”
Steve shifted slightly, pulling Tony closer. “You sure you’re not too warm?”
"I'm pointing to my heart, buddy, come
Tony looked up and stood to accept the vile from Helen. “Thanks.” He turned towards the door.
“Breakfast,” Steve repeated with very little conviction.
Rhodey furrowed his eyebrows at Tony. “You know it doesn’t work like that.”
Tony exhaled. “I know. I know. It’s not your fault.”
"I'm sure as hell not sitting this one out," Sam said. "And I assume you aren't either."
“You’re stubborn. I would’ve liked to have you on my side,” Tony joked, but Wanda’s brow furrowed in displeasure. “Not a good joke. Okay.”
“Can’t do what?” Tony asked, feeling panic rising in his chest. “It’s me, right—”
Natasha jumped to her feet at the sound of footsteps, and Tony stood stiffly as Clint, Sam and Bucky walked towards them down the hospital corridor. God, they weren’t ready for this, he wasn’t ready for this.
After some time they got themselves cleaned up and went back to necking, which was really even hotter than Tony could have imagined with the way Steve's hair was messed up and his clothes were rumpled from sex, his sweatpants sitting almost obscenely low on his hips.
“Yeah, he’s awake,” Tony repeated, and Wanda smiled up at him from her nest of blankets. “You look awfully warm.”
"When I got this team, this family…" Natasha turned to Tony. They were sitting on the side of the room, watching the rest of their team--because that's what they somehow were, after all this. "I'd never had something like that before." Her voice was quiet and thoughtful. "I didn't know what it could do for me, and how it would make me want to be better."
Wanda looked at him. “Steve, is he—”
“Tony,” Steve murmured after a moment, his voice buzzing pleasantly through Tony’s body.
"Uh, I…" Tony heard his voice shake and tapped the arc reactor, then shook his head.
“It’s just too much,” Steve finished, looking up sadly at him. “Being next to you, but not really having you at all.” Tony looked at him in confusion. “I know it’s selfish. You need me too, and I-I want to be here for you. But I can’t do it anymore.” He looked away. “I can’t stand having you just out of my reach, and—
Steve raised his eyebrows. He couldn't help a smug smile as he looked at Tony. "Oh, I think you can find a way to convince me."
We’ll talk about this later.”
“The SRA is going to pass,” Steve continued. “Everything we were fighting for…”
“I know we need to talk.” Steve looked exhausted and miserable and like he did
“Yeah,” he murmured.
“Not a chance I’d let that happen.”
“Surely a woman of your age should be out doing something less boring, huh?”
Tony felt his lips trembling. He cleared his throat. "I know I have blood on my hands. So much. I don't want the government telling us what to do anymore than you do-- telling us we can't protect people we want to protect. But there are others like us out there, and they don't all have your good intentions. I don't think regulating that is a bad thing. Do you still think the safest hands are our own, when we can do things like this to each other?"
“Problem?” Eve asked, pausing to look up, but Tony caught a small smile on her lips.
Tony glanced at Steve, who was pursing his lips. “No flying until you can drive, young man,” he decided.
“I’m sorry, I can’t finish this."
Before Tony could open his mouth again, Clint piped up. “Do they have gay marriage on Asgard? You seem…really unfazed by this.” Steve massaged his forehead.
“Uhhh, bad,” Tony heard himself say, too lightly. “Pretty fucking bad.”
. Like he had her old partner back, or could at least glimpse a future where they'd trust each other again. And it was the first time Tony had seen her like this in months.
Tony shrugged and tried not to roll his eyes. He really didn't feel like doing this today. "Whiskey."
“Tony, hey—” Steve stopped him, a hand on his shoulder. “When you came back from the lab earlier, that was the first time I saw him smile since we met him. I think I need you to do this with me.”
Steve looked indignant. “You’ve only known about this for, what, a few days?”
Tony helped him to the elevator, still holding him up as he leaned against the wall. He felt panic flaring up in his chest. His throat felt raw from all the crying. Out of earshot of the others, Tony murmured, “Hey, you know what, I’ll let Sam switch out for me, how’s that? I know I’m probably the last person you want to see right now. I’ll…go, as soon as we get back.”
Tony wilted. “But—” Steve raised his eyebrow. “Fine.”
“Ugh,” Tony grumbled. “Can you believe this guy? First he marries me without asking, now I have to pay for the fake honeymoon?”
When he turned around, Bucky was standing there, even though Tony was sure he hadn't heard anything over the noise he'd been making.
Tony breathed a huge sigh of relief. “Okay,” he said. “Then what did I do? Tell me, baby, please—” So that was a thing now, Tony thought distantly, hating himself. Maybe Steve hadn’t noticed.
He groaned as Steve shifted against him, blinking his eyes open.
“I’ve never seen anything like this,” Helen continued. “His body completely shut down, but it’s still fighting the poison. It’s my hope that I can strengthen his immune system enough that he can fight it on his own.”
Tony looked away, slumping down on the couch. “That’s it. Next time Galactus decides to vacation on earth, I’m making sure he doesn’t leave in one piece.”
“Don’t swear in front of the kid, Buck,” Steve whispered.
Sam shook his head. “That’s not on you, Steve. You do it when you’re ready, you know?”
“Thanks, Tony,” Wanda replied in surprise.
Tony remembered what Steve had said to him.
Steve sighed, letting out another little laugh as he laid his head down. “I missed you, Tony,” he said suddenly, his hand still holding Tony’s over his chest.
“Steve,” Tony begged, his voice breaking a little, and something in his voice must have alerted Steve that something was wrong because he didn’t hang up. There was a silence. Tony swallowed. “The same people who took Wanda, they’re gonna try to kill you—I don’t know how, I don’t know when, I just know they’re going to and you’ve gotta—you can’t—I don’t know how—”
Tony opened his mouth to speak. “You were in the ice but we couldn't wake you up...” His voice cracked and he stopped abruptly. “I was just there watching—”
“Unless New York is attacked by aliens between now and then, we’re free. You should come over as soon as you get back.”
When Tony stumbled into the kitchen, most of the other Avengers were just waking up from their various positions on the couches and floor. Bucky and Steve were the main exception, both busy cooking breakfast in the kitchen. Bucky was just taking a tray of hot, delicious-looking muffins out of the oven with his metal arm, then putting in the next batch of whatever he was currently baking.
“Whatever, Steve, why does it matter to you, I—
Steve’s brow furrowed and he glanced at Tony. “Um…”
“What? No? Is he?” Tony asked, starting to panic.
“You almost just got murdered,” Sam said to him, raising his eyebrows.
It was silent for a moment.
Tony quickly opened his phone and looked at the news.
the drink. He swallowed that feeling, feeling it settle down warm and fizzy into his chest and send tingles out to the ends of his limbs.
They entered the building without difficulty, Natasha once more in the lead, Steve behind her. It seemed deserted--dark, quiet, but for their soft footsteps muffled on the floor.
He looked over at Miles and saw that his lips were starting to tremble. “My…my mama always made me a…a…” He didn’t finish the sentence as large tears started to roll down his face. Tony knelt down and pulled him into his arms, rubbing his back. He lifted Miles into his arms and sat down on the couch.
Rhodey disappeared down the hall and Tony turned to look after him, feeling his heart wrench in his chest. At least he hadn’t driven away all his friends. Rhodey would probably never really know how much Tony needed him there.
Clint looked up from his morning coffee and blinked a number of times. “Wha-huh?”
“I’ll be careful.” He turned back suddenly and sat beside the hospital bed. What if this was the last time?
“I know this has been really scary, but it’s safe now,” Jan said, reaching out to touch Miles’ shoulder.
Tony glanced up at him. “But you’re always angry.” He looked back at Sam. “Why’s Steve angry?”
The government got the body, of course. Government property, the serum, whatever. But they couldn’t really stop Tony from seeing him.
It still sounded so strange to hear Steve say that. And he said it so easily, so surely, like it was just a fact of life that Tony, almost despite his efforts to pick this apart and find some flaw and some plausible deniability, couldn't help but believe him. He was so screwed.
It was the photo from yesterday. Tony was looking into Steve’s eyes and smiling as Miles sat between them. Steve’s hand was still resting on Tony’s, on top of his knee. The headline read,
“Oh, no, that’s alright, sorry to bother you,” the woman replied, biting her lip. She smiled and waved at Miles, who was now hiding behind Tony’s leg.
Tony squinted at him. “I don’t know…not lie? You’re Captain fucking America for god’s sake.”
“I love you, I love you so much,” Tony muttered incoherently against Steve’s neck, and he felt Steve’s arms tighten around him.
“Of course you can, honey,” Tony said with a grin, kneeling down and hugging Miles. Steve knelt down too and put his arms around both of them. “And you can be as loud as you want. Just so long as you go to bed on time.”
Eve turned around to glare at Tony. “Just because you sleep around doesn’t mean I need to.”
Pepper raised her hands. “I don’t even have to tell you what I think of that,” she exclaimed.
that you were hurting civilians—the same people you wanted to protect.”
“No, what are you talking about? Is she there? Can I talk to her?”
“Tony, don’t you think there’s even a chance he loves you back?” she said quietly.
Tony nodded wordlessly.
“That’s not how it is.”
Tony tried not to smile. “Yes, Captain.”
Steve leaned in and pressed his mouth to Tony’s again, running his hand through Tony’s hair. “That’s alright,” he said with a smirk. “I didn’t really think through getting us fake-married in the first place.”
Steve leaned in and Tony kissed him, narrowing his eyes as they pulled apart.
Steve suppressed a smile. “Not really married, Peter.”
Tony went in for a takedown but Steve easily sidestepped him and threw him on the mat.
“Hey, buddy, did you sleep okay?” Tony asked, getting up and walking towards him.
“She’d be so proud of you, Miles.”
"Bucky, we don't want you getting hit with the Stone," Natasha said, grimacing as she threw her opponent to Steve, who punched him with his shield. "After Pietro, we don't know what it could do."
"Right," Steve said, "we want to pick as many of them off as possible, but quick enough and quietly enough that Red Skull isn't alerted in time to make an escape."
“Right.”
Steve was still not quite ready for battle, and Tony saw how much it frustrated him to be kept back while they were in the field. But he also knew that Steve was unwilling to go into the field before he was ready. He wouldn’t do it, not when Hydra still had that poison.
“Let’s go.”
Tony fell into bed, exhausted, briefly wondering where Steve was. He turned over, smushing his face into the pillow. He’d have to start going to bed earlier now that Miles would be waking him up every morning at the crack of dawn. But for maybe the first time in his life, he was actually looking forward to getting up early.
Sam handed him the paper.
Then something snapped inside him and he stood up again, whirling to look at Steve. “But you did, Steve. You hurt me…you hurt me so, so much. I wanted you to end it. But that doesn’t make it right."
Steve flushed. "No...about being a virgin."
Tony turned around to see Miles grabbing onto Hulk’s foot.
Wordlessly, Tony put an arm over her shoulders and pecked a kiss onto her hair.
Steve knelt own to scoop up Miles in his arms. “I was only allowed to enlist when I was eighteen, you know.”
He really meant to.
"Well, I’m going to get a fucking headache,” he muttered.
"And you flirt with no one, you 90-year-old virgin. I should have known something was going on."
He left the battlefield with his usual swagger, heading the others towards the quinjet, motioning to Tony to hurry up. Sam had brought the quinjet closer to the building remotely, and it waited outside for them to board. Tony nodded at Steve, signaling he'd be right there.
Sam smiled. “Yes. Yes you could.”
“The guys who shot you were lucky you’re the walking definition of a human disaster,” Bucky interrupted. He hauled Steve to his feet. “Come on, we’re going for a walk. Don’t wimp out on me, Rogers. Nauseated?”
It was the beginning of the fall now, with a hint of coolness in the air. But by the time Steve had finished he was sweating like it was 100 degrees. He collapsed at the end of their run, laughing as Sam literally ran in circles around him.
To Tony’s surprise, Steve burst out laughing, letting his head fall back and clutching Tony’s hand to his chest.
He felt violated. The one thing he was supposed to tell Steve—in some other alternate version of events were things were okay between them—and now she knew it. He was ashamed that he could ever love Steve this much and not deserve his love in return. And he was supposed to be the only one who knew.
“Maybe because I was closer to where you were,” Tony wondered out loud. He was sure if Wanda had been able to control who she sent the vision to, she would’ve picked someone like Sam or Bucky. Someone Steve trusted.
Turning around, he saw Pepper clap a hand over her mouth as she appeared in the doorway. Her plane apparently hadn’t been cancelled despite the alien invasion.
“Three days.”
When Tony woke up and detangled himself from his friends, Miles was still asleep in the Hulk’s lap. Tony watched as the Hulk gently scooped him up and deposited him, still wearing his spidersuit, into bed.
Bucky stood behind Sam silently, his expression less friendly. Tony looked away. “Great job I did of that.”
“New York has all sorts of heroes,” Steve pointed out, scooping Miles up and putting him on his shoulders.
Steve reluctantly gave Tony his hand and Tony took out a bandage from the first aid kit and wrapped up a cut that had opened on his knuckles.
There had been a lot of nights, especially after they took him out of the ice, when Steve hadn’t slept. Tony would find him in the early morning drinking coffee. He knew a lot about sleepless nights, but it had been a while before Steve trusted him enough to talk about it. But if Steve was bad at talking, he made up for it in other ways. There were countless times when Tony would have been looking for a drink if it wasn’t for Steve. All the times that he had broken down and felt Steve’s arms around him, and Tony knew Steve didn’t really understand how good it felt for him.
They kissed, they kissed, they kissed, and they rolled over each other and almost rolled off the bed, only barely avoiding it as Tony laughed stupidly against Steve's neck.
Eve looked at Tony dubiously and laughed. “I’m fine here.”
Pepper shook her head. “Tony, you look exhausted. When was the last time you got a full night’s sleep? In a bed?”
Tony nodded, but didn’t look up.
Tony sighed. “I’m trying, but have you seen this guy?” He turned back to Steve, who had pulled his shirt over his head. Tony felt himself blushing and forgot all the jabs he was going to make at Steve and did his best not to stare.
Tony looked up at Steve briefly and then screwed his eyes shut.
It was a long wait in front of the door. Clint had gone to see Wanda. Bucky kept pacing back and forth, although the news about Wanda had calmed him slightly—she had been missing for a long time. But they were all on edge, and finally Sam got to his feet in frustration. “You’re not going to make that door open any faster by pacing in front of it, man. Just sit down and wait like the rest of us.”
The noise faded and Tony looked up uncertainly at Steve. “Look, I just don’t understand why you would—”
She looked at him and smiled. "We've got to hold onto this with everything we've got."
“Who do I root for, Dad or Pops?” Miles asked him.
“Where’s Barton?”
“He’s probably so scared,” Jan murmured next to him. “I’d turn invisible too if I could.”
“Sleep okay?” he asked.
“I’m not going to let him get to you again,” Tony said quietly. “I swear to you. We’re a team now. We’ll all be here protecting each other. And we’ll have your back. As far as I’m concerned that’s the most important job anyway.”
Tony pressed his hand gently to Steve’s ribs. “Does that hurt?”
Miles shook his head and jumped up and down. “No! I’m excited! I’m going to make new friends, and play with them, and Dad, Pops, can I invite them over to the tower? Please? We wouldn’t be loud, or make a mess, or—”
Steve clenched his jaw. “You know just as well as I do that people in our line of work can’t make it work with civilians.”
Tony blinked back the tears in his eyes, staring at Steve in horror. “No, I realized that we were both wrong.”
Once the cold had faded, Tony wrapped his arm around the back of Steve’s waist and drifted off to sleep again.
Tony got to his feet and waited for Steve at the door. He defended himself against a jab in the ribs from Rhodey and pretended to roll his eyes in annoyance at Rhodey's wink. He should have known Rhodey would tease him just like back in college, but who was he kidding--it made him happy.
The next chapter will be posted soon I hope, since it's almost done. It will be about as long as this one. Edit: it's up!!
Tony bumped his shoulder against Steve’s. “Anything would’ve been wishful thinking, you know? You didn’t know I was bi either, you hypocrite.”
Steve looked at him, and Tony couldn’t tell what he was thinking. “So what you’re telling me,” Steve started quietly, “is I don’t get a say? That we’re done?”
“Why don’t I get one?” Clint asked.
"About that," Tony added, "Helen's been sending me stronger antidotes as she develops them. The latest should reverse the effects of the poison entirely if injected within an hour. I swear that woman works magic. Y'know, sciencey magic."
“Not a perfect soldier, but a good man,” Tony said quietly, and he knew it was mean. He knew and he said it anyway. “That’s how it goes right?”
to think about Steve, but how could he when that damn couch was sitting right there?
Sam raised his eyebrows. “If you call that running.”
“Just because you fight doesn’t mean you are not brothers. I...would know.” She looked down briefly and then back up at Tony. “How is…how is Pietro? Does he hate me?” she whispered, and her eyes filled with tears.
, and since when do you care?”
"I agree, we can't let him get away. But what about the poison?" Wanda asked. "Shouldn't we take precautions to protect you from being exposed to it again?"
“I wonder why it went to you,” Wanda murmured and Tony stopped.
“Okay Miles, remember that when you’re at school you’re on a secret undercover mission. That means no turning invisible and climbing up the walls or stinging anybody.”
“And I love you, but I’m not raising a child with you. That’s kinda gay.”
Tony looked down and grinned. “Pretty weird, huh? I guess a stick-in-the-mud like you is a good influence.”
“Better make it convincing then,” Bucky replied, stifling a laugh.
Tony had fallen asleep on his work table in his lab. He woke with a start. It was dark, and he was disoriented. When he opened the door to Steve’s room, Sam looked up, bleary eyed, from the chair by his bed. He got up quietly, coming to stand by the door.
? Apparently they had to do this now.
"I'm piloting," Wanda added. "Taking over for Sam. You get in the back with Steve and make out like high schoolers."
Tony woke up in the early morning. Natasha was gone. Steve had rolled over on his side, breathing shallowly. Tony got up to get some water, and when he came back, Steve was awake.
“Hey.”
He zoomed up past the skyrises until he could see the city spread out below him, and then flew in the direction of the court house, ignoring the throbbing pain in his bruised limbs. It was grey and oppressively hot for the end of summer, and up here he should’ve been pleasantly cool, but he was sweating like mad.
“I love you,” Steve said, unable to look at him, his shoulders crumpled and his voice unsteady. He looked like he had been shattered. “I’ve loved you for years, before…”
“It didn’t mean anything, okay? Just forget it ever happened.”
Steve began to eat more, and he had more energy, but he was frequently out of breath as his body continued to fight the remaining poison. He had a fever that came and went. He insisted that he didn’t need anyone to watch him at night, but Tony stayed anyway—from what he could gather Steve’s health had been a nightmare before the serum, and that meant he wasn’t going to stop worrying about him until he was 100% normal again.
Tony put his arm around Miles’ shoulders. “Some people are angry at Pops for, uh, marrying me.”
Steve was handcuffed and pushed out of the car. He didn’t struggle, just looked straight ahead with a grim expression as he walked up the steps. He had knowingly turned himself over to these people, these faceless men in black. For a split second, there was hesitation between the guards—some sort of communication between them as they stepped back from him and then a gunshot sent Steve staggering forward onto the stone steps. Blood was pooling under him—more and more blood. A surge of people gathered around him, and one of the guards turned him onto his back and felt his neck—no pulse. He lay there still and cold and bloody. There was blood all around him, bright red. Blood on his mouth.
Tony’s eyes widened and Steve blushed. “Hey, uh, Miles, just let me talk to your dad for a second, okay?”
Steve's eyes slowly wandered over Tony's armor. "I hope not too many. It's fun when it's a little rough." Then, in a low voice that made shivers run up Tony’s spine, "Where's that kiss you promised me? I gave you mine."
“What am I then?” Steve asked, raising his eyebrows at Tony and then Miles.
“He’s tall, he’s blonde,” Pepper began, suppressing laughter. “He’s got a great rack.”
“Aww come on,” Tony breathed. “I thought I had you for a moment there.”
“Can I call you Dad?”
“What?! I thought you were just too mature to take the bait," Tony managed, staring at Steve in shock. Steve, in his bed, his lips pink from kissing, his shirt riding up over his hips--a virgin. Not that he could have ever actually known--that was one aspect of Steve's life that he had always kept private, no matter how close they got. But Tony had assumed.
“Although rumors of a marriage between Tony Stark and Steve Rogers are now being confirmed as false, the two Avengers did adopt a young boy together as partners. Stark and Rogers started dating after adopting Miles Morales, who was orphaned in the recent attack on New York. In an interview with Karen Page, the couple explained that for years they had what they thought were unrequited feelings for each other, until Rogers initiated the relationship in recent weeks. In the interview, Stark lived up to his reputation by flirting with his new boyfriend, something he seems to only enjoy more now that they are in a relationship. Iron Man and Captain America have always had chemistry—now we know why! Rogers talked passionately about protecting and advocating for LGBTQ rights and opened up for the first time about his own bisexuality, stating that the support of his friends and the outpouring of both criticism and support from the public cemented his decision to come out. Stark came out as bisexual as well, and made an announcement that Stark Industries will be sponsoring programs to help LGBTQ youth in New York City, raise awareness for LGBTQ issues and prevent hate crimes. Page also spoke with Morales, the newest addition to the Avengers family, who started kindergarten this fall. His interests include wrestling, robotics, and saving the world. Read the full article below.”
Steve closed his eyes. “You know that’s not what I was going to say, Tony.”
He took Steve’s hand carefully. It was warmer than Tony had expected. Tony swallowed as he studied Steve’s face. Not sure if it was directed to Helen or Steve, he said, “I know you can…”
Steve shrugged and gave that buoyant relaxed smile. "I think...I think I did.” He was silent for a moment. “I'll always be afraid of losing this life we've made. But afraid of that poison? Not anymore. Not with an antidote. It helps that Red Skull is dead. I'm not gonna lie, it felt
Tony fell silent. He realized he’d never feel about anyone the way he felt about Steve—he couldn’t. There just wasn’t any energy left in him to love someone like that, and now he didnt feel anything, just scar tissue toughening around his heart. For all the battles they’d fought and the arguments they’d had, Steve was never the enemy. If he had been an enemy it would’ve been easy to fight him, even to hate him. Instead, it was like a piece of his own heart had been torn out and could never be put back in.
Steve raised a hand, laughing. “Easy, kid. You got it.”
“If that’s what it takes,” Eve replied after a moment, and Tony reached up to hold the side of her face suddenly. Eve opened her mouth in surprise and then Tony kissed her, cupping the back of her waist and pulling her closer as she felt Eve’s lips part beneath hers.
Tony looked away, biting his lip. “It’s super weird that we’re adopting a kid together.”
“How did you meet Dad?” Miles asked through a mouthful of cereal.
Tony leaned up and pressed his mouth to Steve’s, wrapping his hand around the back of Steve’s head.
He looked up to see Steve’s eyes shining with relief.
“Are you okay?” he asked, his voice husky like he'd been crying.
Steve opened his mouth but Tony beat him to it. “Steve here just got us fake married in front of our child, is what happened.”
“No.” Tony was surprised by the belligerence in Steve’s voice. Steve turned against Tony, putting his other arm around his shoulders, and Tony felt him breathe out a sigh. “No,” he heard Steve whisper again. And then, quietly, “Please don’t leave.”
It ricocheted off a pulse of green magic bright enough they had to shield their eyes.
Miles wilted. “Can I see it?” He pulled on Carol’s knee. “Can you teach me to fly, scary lady?”
“I don’t think he knew he could do it before yesterday. It’s like what Jan does, when she stings you. Has she ever accidentally stung you?”
“When did…what happen?” Tony replied, motioning with his eyebrows at the little Spiderman peering down over his head. “Uh…nothing new has been happening. At all. Nothing has ever happened, ever.”
“Aww, you guys make a cute couple,” he said, making Steve sink his head lower.
“What?”
“I’m sorry…about your brother.”
me to be here for you, Steve, I—”
Sam burst out laughing. “Oh my god.”
Steve took a step forward, squared his jaw, and leaned down slightly to press his mouth against Tony’s. His lips were soft, and his eyelashes brushed against Tony’s cheek for just an instant before he turned and walked away, leaving Tony alone in the hallway, dumbfounded.
Normally Tony would let whoever was intruding deal with the embarrassment of seeing him in bed with someone, man or woman—but there was something about how secretive he’d been about his feelings for Steve, even about sleeping in his room—that made Tony leap for his shirt and try to destroy any possible evidence of what they’d been doing.
“Okay.” Miles looked up and dried his eyes, smiling. “I want to be a hero like Dad and Pops.”
“Pepperrrr,” Tony groaned, rubbing his eyes with his hand. “I mean, everyone’s a little bit gay for Captain America—”
“Sorry, what were you saying?”
Tony blasted a Hydra agent who whose gun was trained on Natasha as she scaled up the far wall. Pietro narrowly managed to duck a man swinging at his head before Tony blasted the man too.
"You will see--"
She lifted a hand hesitantly. Clint slowly reached out to take it, and then placed his other hand around it, his shoulders slumping down.
Steve opened his eyes. “Morning,” he grumbled.
Steve groaned and rolled over onto his side, wincing in pain.
Tony sighed as he hung up. He glanced down to see another copy of the newspaper on the table. The front story with the headline he’s seen that morning was written by someone he didn’t know, but on the third page he found Karen’s story.
“Go for his legs!” Natasha called.
"Have you poisoned yourself again?" Rhodey asked in such a concerned voice that it made Tony feel like shit for making him worry.
“I just wish we could bring him up in a world where there wasn’t so much hatred,” Steve whispered.
Tony breathed out a long sigh.
“Have we ever been on a real date?”
Rhodey pulled her into a tired hug. She looked at him worriedly. “We found a kid after the battle…he lost his parents,” he explained. “He’s sleeping in one of Tony’s extra rooms.”
Tony had just arrived back at the hospital with Wanda in his arms when Pepper appeared down the hallway. It was the first time he had seen her in a long time—since they had ended it, he realized. He came to meet her, lifting the faceplate, and she put a hand on his arm gently. “I heard what happened. I came right away.”
"Natasha, you're clear," Tony said though the comms.
“Yep, I was just finishing up everything with the adoption agency.” Tony gave Steve a thumbs-up and Steve smiled warmly at him, making Tony blush a little.
Tony shrugged, shaking his head. “Well I guess I didn’t know it until I saw it.”
“Hey, buddy,” Tony said suddenly. “How would you like to come down to the lab with me? When you’re finished?”
Tony let out a bitter laugh that sounded more like a sob and felt the coldness settle into his bones.
“I didn’t know you could do that from--from far away.”
Miles pointed to the rainbow sherbet. “I want the rainbow one.”
Tony shrugged and glanced at Steve, then looked away, grinning. Bucky wrapped his arm around Steve’s shoulders and ruffled his hair. “
He hated how much concern showed in Wanda's eyes.
Natasha fought back to back with Tony. "He's trying to get Bucky," she muttered. "Look at how he's fighting, moving constantly away from Wanda in Bucky's direction."
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve turned to him and smiled. “Neither did I.”
Tony was almost concerned for Steve's asthmatic lungs, but he was a little too angry to be. Instead he found himself sitting at his work table trembling with rage and grief. Trying not to cry just made him feel worse. And it all ended up coming out anyway as he worked, doing anything to keep his hands busy. He ended up getting tears all over his work and throwing it aside in frustration.
Steve shared a smile with Tony. “He’s friendly, Miles. This is Thor.”
“What? No way.” Tony turned to Nat. “Are you telling me we adopted a little Spiderman?”
Steve groaned. “Buckyyyyy.
"Were you drinking it?"
“He’ll be okay,” Pepper murmured.
“You realize in the span of 30 seconds you just divorced me and then asked me to marry you again,” Steve asked, and Tony kissed him on the cheek.
Steve smiled slightly, shrugging his shoulders, his voice light again. "Hacking an old man out of a block of ice doesn't sound that fun. I think we can top it. What do you say?"
Rhodey was still wearing his armor, but he had lifted the face plate and Tony could see that he was pretty bunged up. He looked at Natasha. She was silent, her eyes empty and Tony looked away quickly, knowing that she had probably fought with Barton. It had to be terrible that this had torn them apart too. Tony felt his own chest tighten. It had come between friends and siblings, so why not lovers?
The rest of the Avengers filed into the room, and Tony waited by the door for Steve. When he appeared, he took Tony's hand and squeezed it. "Whatever this is, we'll deal with it together."
“Thanks, Bucky,” Tony murmured, and Bucky squeezed his shoulder. Tony cleared his throat. “Sorry I assumed…”
Steve took Tony’s hand as they watched him join the group of other kids pouring into the school.
Steve nodded at both of them with gratefulness. Then he glanced to Tony, almost shyly, across the room. "Our first mission together since...well, since we stopped being a team. What do you say?"
“We should get you to bed. Brush those perfect teeth in the morning.”
Steve groaned and rubbed his face with his hands. Clint cackled as he walked past with his cereal and Sam grabbed the newspaper from Steve.
“It’s not like that, really, it’s not. I swear to god. It’s just that Miles thought that we were, you know, married and Steve panicked and you know how impulsive he is and…now we’re stuck with it. He’d be so heartbroken if he thought we were splitting up, Pep—”
Tony snapped the faceplate closed. He could feel his teammates’ eyes on him. The last time they’d seen Tony and Steve fighting, it hadn’t been anything like this.
“I think he’s just taking this really personal,” Sam murmured to Natasha. “I got the feeling that maybe he wanted to say…” He shook his head. “I don’t know. Never mind.”
Tony grinned. “That’s cute.”
“So much as changed since Galactus,” Tony murmured, squeezing Steve’s hand in his. He squinted against the sun. “I never thought that any of this could happen.”
“Are you sure she’ll want to see me?”
Natasha smiled and shook her head in agreement.
Well…just the one.
Tony didn’t realize he hadn’t taken off his suit until Pepper reminded him. They were waiting outside Steve’s room. Pepper tried to stifle her gasp when she saw all the scrapes and bruises and Tony wished for the hundredth time she didn’t have to see him like this. It had been bad enough when they were together.
“If you don’t want me to…hold you…”
"This is your fight," Carol replied. "You deserve this win. We'll hold down the fort till you guys get back."
“Oh, that’s how it is.” Sam grinned. “Come on, man, this is like my
"Yeah okay. Good plan."
“Uh, guys, there’s a lot of paperwork involved here,” Rhodey interjected. “It’s not guaranteed that either one of you could adopt him, even if you wanted to.”
going to leave.”
“Yeah, you’re right, you’re a prude,” Tony shot back. “Every woman in New York wants to sleep with you, and probably half the men, but you—what, you want to be fake married to ME of all people?”
And just like that, Steve left.
“You need to sleep too,” Steve murmured, pulling on Tony’s shoulder.
She was silent for a moment. Then she said, “We never talked, after…”
“Shirt. Off,” she murmured, and Eve lifted the offending garment over her head. Tony squeezed Eve’s shoulders and slid her palms down Eve’s chest. Eve had about the taste in sports bras that Tony expected. No one should look this good in what was probably army regulation wear. Eve moaned, hands clenched on Tony’s shoulders as Tony squeezed the sides of her abs.
“There are no monsters in the closet or under the bed,” Tony concluded, bending down to plant a kiss on Miles’ forehead. “Night, buddy. I love you.”
“Not mine, okay, got it,” Tony breathed, and ran.
"He was with his team," Tony called across the room, rolling his eyes. "Ever think of that?" He did a scan of the rest of the building just in case, but infrared was negative. It seemed they had drawn all the attention they'd be getting--for now. He didn't want to take chances. Pietro doubled over and breathed like he'd just run ten miles.
“He looked so peaceful,” she murmured, glancing back at Steve.
Rhodey grinned and looked up at Tony. “Hey buddy, I can’t wear it all the time,” he explained to Miles.
“What’s an old-fashioned way to say dad?” Miles asked.
Steve glared at him. “Yeah, and getting a divorce.”
Tony glanced at Steve and winked. “No, somebody’s gotta tell it. May as well be you,” he said, turning back to Karen.
Bruce had just finished his coffee. “I know the other guy congratulated you guys, but I want to, you know, as myself.”
“Wait, uh, I…” Tony began but then deflated as Thor strode away, cape billowing.
“Well, you’re both so busy, being on the Avengers and saving New York from threats, and you Mr. Stark, everything you do at Stark Industries…but your friendship—“ Karen blushed a bit. “I mean your relationship, is what most people believe is the core of what makes the Avengers work. What I’m trying to say is, how do you juggle all of that? What is the key to making your relationship, your marriage, work?”
“Okay, just checking in. I know he means a lot to you. It can’t have been easy making up after that, is all I’m saying.”
Tony sat down next to Miles and put his arm around him, Steve on his other side. “Don’t worry, Steve and I have some ideas about that.”
Peter hung his head. “Aww man.”
“I know. I know a lot of guys with a body like mine would probably have slept around a lot. It’s just…I knew how women looked at me before the serum, and I knew how they looked at me after. As for men…it was a while before I realized that was something I wanted.”
Which of course meant that Tony went after him, even though Bucky shook his head like maybe that was a bad idea. Well, Tony apparently loved bad ideas.
There were still no new leads on the people who had shot Steve, but with everyone’s help Tony knew they would get there. What he didn’t know is how much he would hate it when they did.
“Take care of him for me,” Tony called to Sam, and Steve waved goodbye to him with a smile.
It was immediately picked up, but the other end was silent, and Tony heard his heart throbbing in his ears. It was the first time he’d called—Steve hadn’t even wanted to talk to Tony in person before this all escalated. He had never given Tony a chance. There had been no point in phone calls.
Sam glanced at Steve. He was focused on Bucky and Nat, who were now in the middle of a grappling match at insane speeds.
“As long as I don’t have to kiss the bastard,” Tony said with a smirk, and then wrinkled his nose in mock disgust. “I mean, have you seen him?”
“Another thing I don’t understand, is why you just gave up,” Steve said suddenly, and Tony could tell he wasn’t going to let this go.
Eve got to her feet and looked down slightly at the shorter woman with that familiar righteous clench of the jaw. “Don’t get started on that when you’re not even wearing your suit, Stark.”
“That’s your Uncle Bucky,” Steve explained, and Bucky went down on one knee as Steve put Miles on the floor. Miles took a step forward slowly and tapped the metal arm experimentally and then started giggling.
Tony jerked, sending the machines around him beeping. “What the HELL?”
Tony glanced around the room. “Well, we’re all assembled.”
“And for all our back and forth—and all the things we’ve said and done to each other…for all the hard questions I’ve had to ask, and terrible lies I’ve had to tell…there’s one thing that I’ll never be able to tell anyone now. Not my friends or my co-workers or my president…the one thing. The one thing I should have told you. But now I can’t.”
Rhodey raised his eyebrows. “You gonna debate me on this?”
Tony reached up and rested a hand on Steve's shoulder, giving it a bit of a rub. "Sounds good to me. We're a team again, and you know there's nothing we can't do when we're working together."
It wasn’t worth it.
“I hurt you, just like he hurt me,” Steve said quietly. “I put you in that place.”
The last of the Time Stone's energy faded from him, withering his body until it fell apart and became smoke. Steve watched the smoke dissipate with a hard look on his face, then glanced sideways at Bucky. Bucky clasped his shoulder and breathed out a sigh.
“What’s going on, Dad?” Miles asked, pulling on Tony’s hair. “Is something special happening?”
Which, of course, was impossible, Tony realized, as Steve, dazed, finally managed to pull his too-tight shirt back down over his chest.
Steve was quiet over breakfast and Tony had a feeling it was for his benefit.
Steve considered what Tony was saying for a moment. “You’ve told me those things before.”
Carol smiled at him when she pulled away. "You said it, not me."
“That’s on him,” Carol replied. “You have to take care of yourself right now. If Rhodey was here he’d tell you—”
Because really, kissing Steve was every bit as incredible as Tony had thought it would be in those moments of weakness where he had allowed himself some dirty fantasies. Once Steve got him back in bed, Tony went right back to it. Steve's hands were in his hair and Tony's hands were on Steve's throat and chest and pushing up his shirt, and he didn't want to take his hands of Steve even for a second. They had lost so much time already. Steve cupped Tony's face in his hands, making a sound of relief like a groan into Tony's mouth that made Tony's dizzy with arousal.
"This whole time?"
Steve exhaled and turned over on his side so Tony could hold the icepack in place. Tony rested his head on Steve’s shoulder. “So what happened?”
Tony took a step forward, spreading his arms. “Then you’ve got me—”
Tony turned to look at her, and waited, trying not to expect the worst.
As reality slowly came back to him, he remembered to ask, “Did you mean what you said to Red Skull? About not being afraid?"
Tony looked around, remembering where he was, and breathed out a sigh. Steve slowly pulled him back into his arms and Tony didn’t stop him.
It was Steve who spoke up next. “Don’t get me wrong, this is good news…but it was so important to you, and you just let it go?”
Steve collapsed onto the couch next to Tony. It was late—they both should have been in bed hours ago, if Tony even slept in a bed anymore, which he didn’t—he slept in the chair by Steve’s bed every night.
Tony grabbed his face and kissed him, and this was never not going to do things to him, the way Steve pressed as close as he could, urgently, tilting his head, holding the back of Tony’s head in his hand as he kissed him with everything, open-mouthed and hungry, only pulling away regretfully to breathe.
Tony blushed and smiled. “Yeah, okay, Cap. Yeah, that sounds good.”
He hadn't had sex so good in...
Steve nodded, and smiled grimly.
“I’ve felt fine ever since we left the hospital.”
Tony looked up to see Steve watching him. But whatever question was on Steve’s mind, he didn’t get a chance to ask it.
“You saved his life,” Wanda replied.
Tony was resting his head on his arms, parts of the Iron Man suit jumbled on the table in front of him. Since last night this was just going from bad to worse to terrible, and with Wanda accidentally seeing into his mind, he had no doubt about what she had seen there.
“Was that fun?” Sam asked.
Tony glanced over at Steve discussing something with Bucky. Wanda and Pietro were standing together, Wanda fiddling with a bit of red magic. Natasha was idly toying with one of her knives.
Tony shrugged. “Your choice.” She stretched her arms above her head and let out a sigh as she walked back to her work table. “Just another week. May as well make something of it. I guess you are an old fogey though.” Tony smiled to herself—she could practically hear the look of exasperation on Eve’s face.
“Do you prefer just
Steve looked down, exhausted. “So it’s over,” he said quietly.
“Hey, are you going to get in on the hair braiding, man?” Sam asked Bucky.
“I’ve known you the longest. When you got to be friends with Steve, and after you broke up with Pepper…I mean, you flirt with everyone but you really like flirting with him. Like…a lot.”
“You okay?” Steve asked, propping himself up on one elbow.
“I’ll be the best influence ever! Just like Uncle Sam.”
Tony burst out laughing.
"How many men?" Bucky asked.
Steve’s eyes hardened. “For hurting you, not for fighting for what’s right.”
“Least I can do,” Tony replied. Rested his head down on the pillow behind Steve's. “For the record, if you get killed again, I’ll shoot you myself.”
“Yeah, we had a lot of fun!” Miles replied. “Peter taught me all these cool new moves.”
Steve sat down on the side of the bed. “Not in front of children I don’t.”
“Maybe in a little while.”
chance to beat you! I ain’t giving up on that.”
“Ugh, just that Steve told Miles that we’re married.”
Tony looked down at the suit in his hands, and for a moment he was taken back to before the Superhuman Registration Act, before any of this had ever happened. What had gone so wrong? Well, that wasn’t a question he could answer now.
“You can’t be here.”
“You’re one to talk,” Steve said, striding into the training room with Sam and Natasha. “Whenever you’re in a combat situation without your suit, do you know how that makes me feel?”
The warehouse the search led him too was empty on the first infrared scan, but on the second, he saw a faint signal near the northeast side.
"Yeah?"
“Don’t call me that.” Well, there went that idea. “I’m not yours,” Steve said stiffly, and Tony was right back to panicking. He should never have let Steve pull him into his bed, not when he felt the way he did about him. There was nothing about that that wasn’t dishonest as fuck.
“Let’s make breakfast,” Tony continued, opening the refrigerator. “You want some toast? Eggs?”
“Hell yes.”
Tony squeezed the sides of Steve's waist, rubbing his thumb up over the skin that showed below the hem of his shirt. "You really think you're bad at this? I really shouldn't go into my list of exes right now, but trust me, you're not."
Sam frowned, shaking his head and then stifled a laugh as Miles kicked him accidentally with his foot. “Nope. Haven’t seen him, technically speaking.”
“Actually, it kind of is,” Tony replied, standing up. “I became a hero to stop kids from losing their parents like this. What did we do wrong?”
you.”
“I don’t have any hiding places left,” Steve breathed out, sitting down on the side of the bed. Wanda stood in the doorway—she had been up on her feet for a few days now.
"How do you fight all the time without powers?" Pietro gasped as he punched someone in the face with a huge effort. "This
"That's a big of a self fulfilling prophecy don't you think?"
“I’m sorry, I know I did something wrong—just tell me what it is—”
They pulled apart, and Tony had to take a deep breath to recover. "I could get used to this. After a battle. Calms my nerves."
But Wanda wasn’t listening to him. “I didn’t know,” she whispered, and Tony’s blood ran cold.
“I’m fine,” Steve sighed. “Me and Nat figured out another of Miles’ powers yesterday.”
“Let’s face it, you guys are maaaaaaarriiiiieed,” Clint sang as he followed after Natasha, Sam and Thor.
“Fuck,” Tony muttered, and Steve pulled him down by his collar of his shirt for another kiss. It was slow this time, unhurried. Steve cupped the back of his head, still running his fingers through Tony’s hair after they pulled apart.
Tony squeezed his hand. "Well I couldn't just leave you there in the ice, all dressed up with no place to go," he joked, but his eyes were serious. After a moment he said, "Finding you was the best day of my life. Or at least...it used to be." That was before he had a son--before he even considered what it would be like to have his own family--and before Captain America decided Steve Rogers still had one more chance at a normal life.
Sam grinned. “I know. C’mere.” He pulled Miles into a hug. “I wish you didn’t have to grow up in a time like this. It’s not always safe for black kids.”
He let out a long sigh. “We’re going to need to find him a kindergarten or some shit.”
“You don't have any frame of reference. You're not going to know how good I am in bed," Tony teased, glancing down at Steve’s mouth.
Steve raised his eyebrows and smiled, an angry light in his eyes. “We’ll I’m ready now. If I can help people by talking about this, just by telling the truth, and making everyone else uncomfortable then hell if I’m not going to do it.”
I thought you were going to pine over him forever.”
“You’re the perfect person for him to raise a kid with. I think you’ll be great dads together.”
Miles was curled up, still in his spider PJs. Tony smiled and turned to Steve. “You know, Miles wants to be a superhero because of you. No matter what people say about you, people are always going to be inspired by you too, because that’s what you do. You make people want to be the best version of themselves.”
Tony had just slipped into the kitchen for more coffee. “Um, excuse me,
“I wonder what gave him that idea.”
Steve flipped him over on his back, his face just an inch from Tony's. "No more jokes. Just because you've had a little bit too much practice in this area--"
“I should be the one asking you that, kid,” he replied, turning away.
Tony felt his lips tremble. He rubbed a hand over his eyes.
“You sure you’re ready for this?” Tony asked, the faceplate of the Iron Man suit still up.
Tony and Rhodey landed next to Sam and looked up where he was pointing. Under the side of an overturned building, there was a small shape of a boy, clinging to the concrete. Tony flipped off the infrared and the shape was invisible again.
“Yeah, those are my friends. One of them can fly up here to help you down—”
When he returned Steve was lying in the same spot.
"Do we know why Red Skull is hanging out in Virginia?" Sam asked. "Because I grew up there. Feels a bit personal, you know?"
. He sat up slowly, wincing, and fumbled for his phone. Where the hell was everyone? Panic settled back into his stomach.
Steve groaned. “I won’t let that happen, okay Buck?”
He wished he hadn’t said it. He knew how pathetic he sounded. Bucky looked at him for a moment and then turned, leaving Tony to stare at the ice melting.
Steve raised an eyebrow at him. “You’re not really a member of the Avengers yet, son.”
“How about me!” Natasha called from across the room. Bucky threw her a muffin and Clint rubbed his eyes blearily, peeling his face off the side of her shoulder.
you?”
“Yeah?”
Sam looked thoroughly unimpressed. "I guess even divided we were more than a match for a piece of shit like you, huh."
Tony looked at him blankly.
“Really?” Steve asked. “I’ve known you a long time, you’re not the type to—”
After Tony was satisfied that the building was empty and that they could make a safe exit, and that Pietro wasn't going to pass out, he picked his way across the ruined floor of the building as quickly as he could. Steve dropped is shield and pulled him into his arms and for a while they just held each other. Even through the armor it felt incredible. The dust was still settling around them.
“Love you.”
“Sorry…about the other day,” Steve murmured, putting his hands in his pockets as he looked away. “I just didn’t know you wanted something like this, that’s all.”
Carol was sure they’d find something soon, but Tony wondered if she was just being optimistic for his benefit. He felt like they were running in circles, all while Hydra was out there with a weapon that could kill Steve with one bullet. There was no way Tony could accept that.
Suddenly shy, Miles walked cautiously over to Thor and solemnly shook the Asgardian’s giant hand. He pulled off his mask as Steve picked him up.
“Yeah, yeah,” Steve replied, waving Sam away as he offered the inhaler. “Enjoy this while it lasts.”
"Your kind don't belong in this time or
"Miles thinks getting good grades is part of his superhero training," Tony said as after Steve closed the door behind him. "Which would be great, if he was starting college and not kindergarten. We need to make sure he doesn't take school too seriously and miss all the fun."
Tony got it. He did. But despite his best efforts not to, he must have looked hurt, because Steve added more gently, "I'll see you soon, and I'll want that kiss when I do. Stay safe."
I like that I implied that Tony is going to develop a quicker way to get out of and into his armor specifically because Steve wants to fuck him. I mean, IT SEEMS LEGIT
Steve swatted at his hand and made a face in response to his question. “Sam’s never going to let me live it down.”
Steve glanced up. "It's what we talked about earlier. I never said I loved you. I do. I love you." He looked into Tony's eyes. "I need you to know. I've kept it to myself for so long, I thought, I thought I might never have the chance to--"
Fury smiled. “I plan on it.”
After leaving the quinjet camouflaged, it was a short hike through the woods to the target location. Natasha was in the lead, taking them in the direction of the huge rundown sprawling building where they would find Red Skull.
Tony nodded, and tried to take a deep breath. “Okay.” This was starting to sound like the poison had been engineered specifically to kill Steve. He remembered the shooter, masked, dressed like any other member of law enforcement, the other guards stepping out of the way to give him a clear shot.
He'd missed this.
” she replied, a small smile on her lips.
He was all in.
Miles rested his head against Sam’s shoulder. “When I’m really Spiderman, I could make things safer for kids like me.”
Tony let out a laugh and looked down. He was starting to feel the exhaustion from last night’s battle, and all the little scrapes and bruises were starting to hurt.  “Okay, Pep.”
All of the battles had come down to this one. They were all fighting this time, not split up into teams, not being careful and conserving their energy. It was all or nothing—it couldn’t go on much longer anyway, it just couldn’t. Or maybe Tony just didn’t know if he could.
Steve shrugged. Sam looked at him quizzically.
He passed Wanda in the hall, and she stopped cold at the look on his face and took his hands.
Natasha’s eyes flickered up to Tony. “Ever since Ultron, he kind of took her under his arm. I just noticed that she wasn’t there, that’s all.”
Tony grinned and handed him a cup of coffee. “Hey, I’ve got a husband to be faithful to here.”
Tony cleared his throat and glanced at Steve. “That’s a good question. Uh…well, I think it’s honesty really.” He saw the small blush begin to form on Steve’s cheeks. “It’s definitely honesty. If there’s one thing I love about Steve it’s that he’s always honest.” He flashed a grin at the reporter and then glanced at Steve with a flick of his eyebrows. “Honesty is the best policy, right sweetheart? You know Steve, he’s the most trustworthy guy anyone could wish for,” Tony finished, turning back to the reporter. “Captain America and all that.”
Tony’s head swam as he stared at the doctor, clean and petite in her hospital dress. He swallowed, still processing all this new information, residual panic and grief still coursing through his body as he tried not to tremble from the sheer effort of keeping it together.
Steve turned towards him and pressed a kiss to his cheek. "Gotta find a way to take this armor off you faster."
She glanced over at Eve. The supersoldier was hard at work improving her already superhuman body. Tony grumbled under her breath. Eve was on her thousandth pushup or so. The soldier’s blonde hair was tied back in a neat ponytail, and her tight grey shirt outlined the muscles in her arms and back as Tony walked over to her.
“I’m fine,” he said, motioning at the disorganized pile on his work table. “Just the usual.”
“Ugh, I’m exhausted,” Tony sighed, leaning against the wall. “Who knew it would take that long to put the little monster to bed?”
Tony elbowed Steve in his beautiful but very distracting abs. “See what you’ve done now, Rogers?”
Rhodey pursed his lips. “Yup. Just the usual.”
Tony glanced at Steve. “If you want, yeah.”
“Is that some sort of joke?” Steve spat back at him and Tony jumped at the venom in his voice.
When Steve woke up he lay silently for a while, and finally turned over to look at Tony, who was still crumpled by the side of his bed. Tony thought he looked even angrier than he had before. He got up weakly to sit on the side of the bed, and the silence dragged on until he turned to face Tony.
"I don't know, but isn't it worth it to try?"
Rhodey smiled at him conspiratorially. “Okay.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “So you find a hot superhero girlfriend. Problem solved.”
He managed to say, “Can I see him?”
"What, so you
Tony put all the remaining energy into his repulsors and soared into the sky, dropping down in front of Steve and blocking his path.
Steve collapsed on his back, groaning and laughing. “That’s not…how I wanted that to go.”
And after that, Tony somehow wound up keeping a watch over Steve every night, until it became part of the routine. Sam didn’t ask him about it, he just let him be.
Steve lifted him effortlessly to his feet and Tony stumbled after him back to bed. He crumpled onto the mattress, rolled onto his side, drying his tears and looking away from Steve. Steve put a hand tentatively on his shoulder and Tony flinched.
Steve bit his lip, raising his eyebrows in surprise. “Where to?”
Tony pulled back, squeezing the side of Steve’s waist. “I just realized something,” he said a little breathlessly. Another kiss.
“Looks like it to me.”
Steve’s face was still pale. He was struggling to keep his eyes open, and as they came into the room, he laid his head back on the pillows. Sam and Bucky were at his side right away. Bucky put a hand on his shoulder, gripping it gently. Steve opened his eyes and looked up at them and Bucky whispered, “Don’t you ever do that again.”
When Tony woke up, Steve was gone. He was making himself a cup of coffee when Sam and Steve came into the kitchen, wearing running clothes, faces flushed. Sam’s arm was around Steve’s shoulder and he was saying “You can be whoever you want to be, man.”
Peter jumped up and down. “I’m assembled! Does that mean I can come?”
Tony breathed out slowly, trying to remain calm. He decided to be honest. "Hadn't decided yet."
He remembered sitting in front of Steve’s body after the shooting, and wondering if he’d ever have it in him to love like this again.
? Something that could tear us apart, people who have known each other for years, people who—who care about each other—Steve,
He didn’t talk to anyone about the dream. Couldn't bear to. Not yet.
It was like on the steps of the courthouse, only this time, he couldn’t hide behind his armor. Steve sank against him, wrapping an arm around his shoulders and putting all his weight on him. Tony adjusted his hand on Steve’s waist. It was a lot all at once, Steve warm and heavy in his arms—the last time he had been this close to Steve had been the battlefield. After everything that happened between them, their friendship was so damaged, maybe irreparably, but Tony held on to Steve as if he could somehow salvage some last piece of trust between them, even if it would break his own heart in the process.
Before they split up, Steve pulled Tony aside.
Tony pulled him into his arms. Steve gingerly relaxed. He was so silent Tony didn't realize he was crying at first until his chest was heaving. It surprised and saddened Tony---the quietness. Sobs shook his body but he choked back the sound, breathing heavily against Tony’s neck. Tony held him tighter and it felt like Steve was almost going to crush him in return. Tony pulled him gently back onto the bed, wrapping his hand around the back of Steve’s head and holding him close.
Tony suddenly wondered what it would be like to really touch him. He wanted to slide his hand over that perfect chest, up to hold Steve’s jaw, and kiss the side of his neck. He wondered what kind of noise Steve would make. Tony swallowed hard. He shouldn’t be thinking about this. This was strictly off-limits. Especially when he was in Steve’s bed.
“I’m sorry,” she whispered.
“I’m going to be fine.”
Jan fluttered closer to Miles, reaching out to touch his shoulder slowly. “We can help you.”
Miles breathed out a sigh. “It’s just…if someone has my abilities and chooses not to use them, they’re responsible for bad things happening, you know? I want to do something, and—”
“I’m sorry I didn’t tell you…about any of this,” Tony started.
at him like this.
“It wasn’t,” Steve said truthfully. “But he’s the same man I was friends with before. It was worth it. It would always be worth it.”
." So Tony had, and none of his dirtiest fantasies had lived up to it, not even close. Not with Steve gasping in his ear, arching back, groaning his name so loud Tony felt it like a warm vibration in his chest, his leg hooked over Tony's shoulder. Not when they kissed and panted against each other's mouths with each thrust of Tony's hips, and Steve put his hand over Tony's heart and Tony thought
Tony’s arm was still under Steve’s waist. Steve's head was thrown back, his face turned to the side, exposing his neck. Tony’s eyes darted down to the hem of his shirt, which had ridden up over his stomach while he slept. His chest rose and fell slowly as he breathed.
"I just can't believe it. Not even when you were in the army, on a cold night--"
Steve ate slowly, his shoulders bowed. Finally he glanced up at Tony.
“You said there was one thing you should have told me—”
“Oh, you mean your husband, right?” Sam asked with a grin. “He’s in the gym. But you might want to give him some space.”
said "
Rhodey handed him something—oh good, his phone—and then looked down. “It’s over, Tony.”
Tony looked at her--really looked at her. Natasha looked tired, but she also looked happy. Relaxed.
“I’m sure you are, big guy,” Jan said in Hulk’s direction as she shrank back to Wasp-size. “Okay, I’m on it.”
The hunt for Red Skull continued.  They found a few Hydra outposts, but the raids brought back no new information. After receiving new intel that Natasha collected, Tony, Carol and Sam were somehow never fast enough to reach the new location in time before everything had been cleared out. Tony got immense satisfaction from how well the three of them worked as a team, but it was overshadowed by the frustration of chasing leads over and over and over and coming up empty-handed.
The tears dried on Steve’s face, he looked drained and pale. Tony sat down in a chair in front of Steve, like the breath had been knocked out of him. When he looked back up to meet Steve’s eyes, he saw the same guilt and shame that he felt, but he still almost couldn’t believe it, because if Steve didn’t blame him for everything that had happened, maybe, maybe Steve didn’t hate him.
The color drained from Wanda’s face and she slumped back into the bed.
“Did you have fun with Nat?” Steve asked, and Miles nodded.
“Nothing to talk about,” Tony replied.
Sam came to get Steve in the morning. Tony had just finished shaving and come out of the bathroom when Sam turned to him.
“Yeah, that’s right,” Tony said, turning to Clint. “Steve wasn’t even man enough to buy me a wedding ring for our fake marriage.”
Tony only wasted a moment looking scandalized.
The wind was blowing over the water, bringing the fresh scent of the ocean. Couples were out enjoying the sunshine, and children were playing down on the beach below.
He woke up to see a sleepy Miles climbing into bed next to Steve.
Steve appeared on the other side of the room and rushed over immediately when he saw Tony.
“I mean, I’d rest easier at night if I knew you were being protected by more than a tin can,” Steve teased, and Tony just shook his head.
Miles took a bite of his cereal dejectedly. “I don’t believe you.”
Was he having a panic attack? He should have listened to Rhodey. He should have talked to Pepper. Of course he should have talked to Pepper! He should have never let himself get this close to Steve.
“Really?”
“Hey, Buck,” Steve greeted him.
Steve turned around, pulling off his hand wraps. “Besides, why couldn’t I be bi? Would that be so hard to believe?”
Natasha looked at him with hooded eyes, and Tony wondered how long she had gone without sleep.
“I hate your stupid supersoldier metabolism,” Tony grumbled.
"Tony?"
It was every bit as good as she thought kissing Captain America would be. Eve’s lips were soft, her eyelashes brushing against Tony’s cheek. Tony grinned as she pulled back. Eve opened her eyes slightly and then closed them again she leaned back in for another kiss. Tony obliged, pulling Eve closer as she sat up on the edge of her work table. She wrapped her legs around Eve’s waist and trailed her hands up to her shoulders.
“I’ll make you coffee,” Steve offered.
“Do you want to talk about it?” he asked.
Natasha gave him a rare smile--not one of her bittersweet ones but a real one--and leaned her head against his shoulder.
Carol glanced at him, her previous levity gone. Furys message to her had just come in moments before. "Trust me, you're going to want to hear this."
It turned out Steve was every bit as bossy in bed as he was outside of it. When they'd made it back into bed he had wrapped his legs tight around Tony's waist, leaned close to his ear, his voice rough, and said, "
“To a kid we’re just a bunch of scary guys in armor and masks. We need somebody small for this job if we don’t want to scare him away again,” Steve said, putting his hand on Tony’s shoulder. “It’s a good idea, Tony.”
"Captain America. Feeling better after the poison, I see," he hissed. "I had hoped that making it with the power of an Infinity Stone would defeat you once and for all."
Steve Rogers was feeling it for the first time. And that made Tony feel so irrationally angry and so relieved and so sad and so full of utter self loathing--
want to talk. He looked down, squaring his jaw. “I’m sorry, Tony, I don’t want to make things weird. It’s just—”
"I can't think of a better way to make me feel better, can you?" Steve countered, and it sounded like a challenge.
It was a miracle that Tony made it through the battle in one piece, not because it was actually difficult fighting the aliens, but because his brain had short-circuited and he couldn’t focus on anything. They fought all night into the early morning and Tony’s head was swimming with sleep deprivation and confusion and giddiness.
Pepper had said.
“Cap? You want the pistachio, don’t you.” Steve nodded and Tony grinned. “Miles, just so you know, pistachio is an old person flavor.” Miles put a hand over his mouth as he giggled. “And I’ll have coffee, please.”
Tony grinned. “I think I’ll be just fine.”
“Not my point,” Steve replied. His eyes were tired as he looked up at Tony.
“These things take forever,” Tony complained.
“Keep it down,” Steve insisted. “I have a fake marriage to uphold.”
“Just because you’re a supersoldier doesn’t mean you shouldn’t take care of yourself. There. Save the world in the morning. Sleep now.” Tony looked up into Steve’s eyes. “Deal?”
There was so much red and Tony sat up, breathing hard. It was a dream, he reminded himself, it was just a dream. He was still seeing red. His arms were shaking as he pushed down the sheet drenched in his sweat and got unsteadily to his feet. He staggered to the bathroom and collapsed against the sink without turning on the light, and felt tears streaming down his face.
After a moment, Miles asked quietly, “Why would he leave?”
Karen stood up again. “So…you’re…”
“This is already my second batch,” Bucky explained, pointing to Thor, who was probably on his fifth cup of coffee and was finishing up a large number of baked goods.
"Now!" Steve yelled, and threw the shield to Sam.
Another laugh. “Okay. I just wanted to say I think it’s great that you adopted Miles with your best friend, Tony, I really do. I bet Steve will be a great dad. And I know you will be too.”
They both laughed and then there was a silence.
“I feel you.”
Tony squinted at her. “I’m trying to seduce you here. I thought I was doing a pretty good job of it too.”
“Because you’re going to kiss me and I’m going to feel much better.”
Tony grinned. “Alright.” He turned away from Rhodey and let his smile disappear. Thank God Rhodey didn’t know he’d started drinking again. He wasn’t drinking that often, it’s just that he had, well, started. Carol probably knew though. Carol always knew.
Tony massaged his face with this hand. “No, I’ll be fine.” Without thinking, he turned over and accidentally bumped his head into Steve’s nose in the darkness before settling down on his shoulder. Steve made an excellent pillow.
?" Tony asked quietly. "What were you thinking? I make you so mad, I-"
Tony shrugged bitterly.
Panic was rising in Tony’s chest. “So it was a mistake, and it didn’t mean anything.”
Suddenly a bolt of lightning struck the landing strip outside the window and Thor appeared, wearing full armor. He strode towards the door and flung it open, then grabbed Tony and Steve and pulled them into a big hug.
Steve huffed out a sigh. "I flirt," he argued.
“What’s wrong, buddy?” Tony murmured.
“Looks like it killed a little bit of both of us.”
Tony groaned. “Maybe if I pretend it doesn’t exist it’ll just go away.”
Wanda sent a dart of red around the room. “Soundproof. Better?”
Steve shifted uncomfortably. “I can’t piece it all together.”
“—but only if you want that. It’s up to you. There are a lot of people who would love to be your family, not just us,” Tony finished.
Wanda looked at him cautiously. “No, it wasn’t. But it is now.”
“We’re going to head out. Do you want to come with us?”
"North wing," Sam said suddenly. "I'm picking up something on the infrared."
Tony looked back at Steve, who was trying not to laugh.
Janet flew over and landed, becoming her normal size again as she put on Sam’s googles. “What’s the plan?”
“I couldn’t have done it without you.”
“Why is this funny?” Tony asked. “I could get stuck with this lie for the rest of my life. I mean, yeah, he’s easy on the eyes, I could get used to being fake married to him. Hey babe.” Tony moved over as Steve joined him on the couch.
“We played hide and seek,” Miles explained.
And even through all of that, Tony somehow slept every night. And he woke up next to Steve every morning.
“You know, Pops would rather jump out of a plane with no parachute than stay out of a fight. It nearly gives me a heart attack every time. Are you sure you’re not related to him?”
He decided that it wasn’t a question he wanted answered, and stayed out of Steve’s way. Natasha started spending time helping Sam and Bucky with their diligent effort at making sure Steve ate enough and got what exercise he could manage. They took turns watching over Steve at night, but Tony slept better at his bedside than anywhere else. It didn’t take long for it to happen again—the nightmare where Steve was lying dead on the courthouse steps. Only this time he was trying to say something before he died, struggling to form words as life left his eyes, his hand grasping, frantic, at Tony's shoulder.
“Don’t strain yourself, big guy.”
“God, this is a mistake.”
“Here.”
Bucky looked uneasily between them. “That actually might work. That’s about the last goddamn place they would look.”
“You’re not married, Tony,” Rhodey said absentmindedly.
When they turned they saw all their friends in the living room. Discarded armor was strewn on the furniture. Miles was on Sam’s shoulder waving. Thor, completely unsurprised, raised his cup of coffee in a toast and beamed at them.
“Steve?”
Pietro was struggling against the magic that had hit him, but it looked like he was trapped under an immense weight. He had moved his finger maybe a few inches in the time they'd been talking.
Tony coughed, tasting blood. “I can’t,” he gasped. Steve was poised above him, face smudged with dirt and blood, fist still raised. He was so close Tony could see the beads of sweet on his brow, but so far away across the gulf of anger and hurt between them. “Kill me,” Tony said in a gasp, but Steve wasn’t listening to him anymore. He was looking around them, at the fires and crumbled buildings.
It took Tony a moment to regroup his thoughts. "What?"
“You want to come train with me and Bucky?” Steve asked her.
Tony felt the power on his suit crackle and go out--he'd been hit with an EMP. He whirled and elbowed his opponent in the face the good old-fashioned way as he tried to reboot power. That was just annoying.
“Where—where am I?” Wanda gasped.
“Huh?”
“You’ve gotta eat,” Tony argued, pushing the plate closer to Steve, as if that would do anything.
He must have been staring after Steve for a long time. Carol had come into the kitchen and paused, looking at Tony’s vacant expression. She put her arms around his shoulders, squeezing him slightly. She didn’t say anything, and Tony relaxed against her.
Wanda squeezed his shoulder. “Good. See you.”
Steve got to his feet on the other side of the bed, rubbing a hand over his forehead. “I just can’t do this.”
“Stark Tower.”
Steve reached out a hand and Tony took it. “Deal.” He pulled Tony into a hug and Tony distantly heard the other Avengers cheering behind them. Then Steve pressed a kiss to his cheek, and Tony blushed hard, glancing over to see Rhodey grinning, and behind him, Natasha, Sam and Bucky exchanging pleased glances. Carol winked and gave him two thumbs up. Wanda was beaming at him.
“I am a good kisser though, right?” Tony asked, raising his eyebrows at Steve and smiling winningly.
“Yeah, I’m going to be Spiderman just like him!”
Tony scoffed in mock irritation as Sam flew Miles out of the room. “I’m the fun dad,” he called. “Steve is the…Steve.” He waved at Steve, who raised his eyebrows and tried not to laugh.
“Because I want to adopt him too,” Steve said replied, his jaw set.
“You’re hand’s cold,” Steve explained with a bit of a blush. “That feels better.”
“If he’ll still have me,” Tony murmured, too tired to argue.
“I came to say I’m sorry,” Steve said, and Tony looked away.
“I don’t think he’ll ever forgive me,” he said absently.
Clint trudged over to the couch with a confused expression on his face.
"Hey, what are you--"
“What happened?”
adopt him.”
“Pietro,” Wanda explained.
When he came to Steve’s room that night, he was asleep. Natasha was there, sitting beside the bed. She looked up when she saw him.
“Let’s get you to bed,” he interrupted, getting to his feet and pulling Steve up after him. But Steve stopped him, a hand on his arm.
“What are you gonna do about it?” Steve asked, pulling a fresh shirt over his head.
The concern on Rhodey’s face was mixed with exasperation and care. "You can't even say his name."
Tony squeezed Steve’s shoulder. “What about Peggy? She liked you from the moment she saw you. At least someone has good taste.”
“That’s not up to me,” Steve replied. He looked at Tony for a moment before looking away.
“He wants you to pick him up,” Steve explained.
Tony was thrown again. “What? No, I haven’t. I’m just…giving you space.”
“It’s not just Miles I’m worried about.” Steve paused and took a deep breath. “It’s everything we’ve done…together, everything we’ve….”
“Don’t tease me, Rogers.”
There's a scene in this chapter where Tony isn't present that's just between Steve and Sam, and I thought it might interrupt the flow of the story to shift points of view, but I liked it so I kept it :)
With the last of her energy, she balled a red mass of energy in her hands. As she collapsed to her knees, she raised her arms and sent the energy coursing upwards through the ceiling, surging and crackling, and screamed as the last of the energy sapped from her and she fell unconscious on the floor.
Steve looked pissed. Or at least be looked upset. Tony figured he'd find out which in a second. Did they have to do this
Now it was empty. Tony got up and slumped down into the couch with a drink. It was moments like this, when he was tired and looking into the bottom of a glass and couldn’t help himself, that he missed Steve the most. And he hated it, and he hated himself for it.
“Did you have fun with Peter while we were gone? Was everything okay?” Steve asked.
Steve stood up and helped Tony to his feet. “I miss training with you. Spend less time in your lab and more time on the mats and you’ll get an edge on me in no time.”
Tony let out a humorless laugh. “Yeah. But maybe it would be simpler if you just adopted him without me—”
“What else would you call me, buddy?” Tony asked, turning over. Steve opened his eyes and sat up, looking perfectly awake and well-rested as always. And gorgeous. Tony rubbed his eyes grumpily.
Miles paused and then nodded vigorously, his eyes lighting up. “Are you--are you gonna teach me how to build one? Can we make a big one? My mom always said that I was really good, and I want to make one that can run up and down walls and do all these crazy things and—”
"We're not taking any chances," Steve replied grimly. No one said the unspoken thing-- if the Infinity Stone could alter reality by manipulating time around Pietro, it could definitely return Bucky to an earlier state. "I'm covering you, pal. No arguments."
“I know,” Tony groaned.
Tony looked down, anywhere but at Sam and Bucky, and Natasha’s lips quirked into a small smile. She said under her breath, “At least there’s one thing that can still unite us.”
“I’m sorry, Tony,” she whispered, and he paused in the doorway, and then left.
“Well I guess it wasn’t a huge mistake after all,” Tony grumbled, smiling back at him. "Maybe you should make more mistakes, like maybe you should forget to wear a shirt, or--"
“Somebody pass me my water,” Tony said irritably, although he was smiling too. Bucky, who was next in line to spar with Natasha, walked up to him and handed him his water bottle.
“Sorry, ma’am, we don’t really have time—” Steve began.
“You’re our hero,” Steve said, kissing Miles on the forehead. “We’ll be back to get you at 3, okay? Go get ‘em.”
"You think we can work out some of our issues in bed instead of in arguments? Might do us good."
"Landing shortly guys, hold onto something," Sam warned from the pilot's seat.
“Yeah,” Tony replied with a nod.
“So…maybe I just wanted to tell you again,” Tony said, spreading his arms defensively. “It was my last chance. I thought.”
Tony held him for a long time. Although Steve's tears were almost over before they started, Tony didn’t want to let him go. After some time, Steve shifted.
“Yeah, you two, get a room,” Natasha murmured, jabbing Steve in the ribs.
"Hey, how come I've missed you even though we've been on the same side this whole time?"
It was like old times--almost.
“Tony, you took a bad fall. I hope you’re not planning on doing that again.”
Tony flopped onto his back. “Deal. I’ll get up soon, I promise.”
“We already have a kid together.”
“Some people won’t like you for being different,” Sam said to Miles, sitting down in front of him. “Because of the color of your skin or because of your abilities. But always remember the things that make you different are what make you who you are. And you should be proud to be who you are. People who can’t see that aren’t worth your time. There are even people who don’t want to see a black man be a superhero.”
“Maybe when you’re older, little guy,” Sam replied, smiling.
Tony scoffed, secretly grateful for the moment of humor. He had to pull it together. "I haven't done anything stupid with my dick. Yet. Though some days he does seem to have a stick up his ass, so maybe it would--"
“Really?” Tony asked. “Wait what--what are they?”
Bucky whirled on him. “He might
, and I still haven’t even gotten to see him. I never even got to say goodbye to him,” he hissed. “Do you realize that? Does this matter to you?”
“Miles!” he called, panicking, but Hulk picked up Miles with extreme gentleness and lifted him up onto his shoulder.
Tony blinked as Thor shook his shoulders. “Well, um, actually about that, it’s—”
"But are you sure you're well enough to-"
Tony thought that might be Loki-
Something lurched in Tony’s stomach. He felt like the floor had been taken out from under him. “I mean, we do that, right? I usually pair up with Vision but we work great too—” he motioned between himself and Rhodey “—and you and the kid made a great team when we need you to.”
“You sure did.”
“I have a sample of the poison like you asked.”
“You saved his life,” he said, his voice almost catching in his throat. “I can’t thank you enough.”
“Oh shit, I can explain,” Tony began. “I mean, it’s Steve’s fault, actually—”
It’d been after Pepper left him, Tony remembered. She’d left before he really became a wreck. He was grateful for that.
“I don’t know,” Steve replied. “It could take a while, but it just seems unfair to the kid to make him wait for something permanent, and then just to be uprooted from one place to another.”
Tony nodded.
“It’s not fair,” Miles grumbled, crossing his arms, and Natasha and Sam couldn’t help but smile at how much like Tony he looked.
Tony narrowed her eyes. “Okay, Rogers.” She grinned at Eve and pulled her into a deep kiss, taking her time as her hands ran up the soldier’s muscular back to cup the back of her head. She finally broke away and glanced down at Eve’s mouth, which she planned on getting much more used to kissing. “It’s a deal.”
“Oh,” Tony mumbled distantly.
was sure this was a huge mistake. They were raising a child together for heaven’s sake.
“That
He pulled away awkwardly, and Tony did his best to not reach out and grab his hand.
," and watched Steve's lips, wet from kissing, murmur something like an incoherent I love you.
Tony bit his lip. “I swear to god, it’s like you’re related to Steve. Don’t worry kid, you’re in the right place.” He held Miles at arms’ length. “But when I think about you, when you’re sixteen or seventeen or eighteen, going out into the field and being in danger—we’re going to put you through some tough training before that happens. No son of mine is going out there unprepared. And there’s really no rush. You’re so young, buddy.”
