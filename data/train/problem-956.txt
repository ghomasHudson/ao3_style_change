Sherlock didn't miss a beat. "If you're concerned about your position here, Mr Watson, I assure you, you will be well taken care of."
Sherlock sat up, his stomach dropping and lifting in a twist of dread and hope that made his head spin. "What happened, Molly? Is John... is he...?"
John was pretty sure he hadn't breathed from the moment Sherlock had knelt down before him, and now, he exhaled a tremulous breath. The finger trailed down John's jaw and to his neck, where it rested on his carotid artery, over his racing pulse. "Interesting," the man mused, eyes far away as they drifted down to where his finger was pressing.
Sherlock dragged the sponge across his chest, soothingly over his nipples and then harder over his stomach to scrub away the dried semen. Sherlock was a quiet presence behind him, and John didn't feel the need to fill the comfortable silence with chatter.
Well, John thought, it was as good a time as any to confess his sins. After all, John did come to church for no other reason than to see if his faith in a deity could be renewed.
“I sucked them and let them suck me,” John breathed, aware that even though they were in an enclosed part of the sanctuary, anyone could be standing just outside. Sherlock didn't seem to care, but his voice stayed a careful undertone.
John’s bed was still neatly made, tucked in curtly at the edges and the wrinkles smoothed out of the blanket. John hadn't slept in his own bed in ages. Sherlock's was significantly more convenient after a long case, somewhere close to fall into after stumbling through the door, exhausted after running through dirty alleys and hopping fences. Sherlock missed it.
John looked away, before the lust consumed him, fidgeting beneath Sherlock's relentless gaze. He crouched down to retrieve the ruined sandwich from the floor, throwing it on the plate as he spoke. "How did you get in here anyway? Last I checked, housebreaking was illegal."
"Morning, Mr. Holmes," John returned, hoping to slip past Holmes, and to his seat without too much of a problem. The man had strategically placed himself on the side of the desk, so John would have to brush by in order to sit at the desk. For a man so intelligent, it was glaringly obvious he'd set a trap for him, but John was determined not to allow Holmes to win.
Sherlock stopped and stared down at him from where he knelt between John's legs, eyes dark and opaque. John was speared by that one look, flayed open and dissected under pale, ever-changing eyes. There was that acute sensation of falling, yet John had never been more there than in that moment. It was wondrous and brilliant, and John thought he might just throw himself from Tower Bridge if he couldn't have Sherlock right this second.
John sighed happily beneath his breath. Ah, the single life was not something he'd be working to get rid of any time soon. He didn't envy Mike's constraints on his social life, now that his friend had a bird on his arm.
For the umpteeth time that night, John felt the nervous flutter of butterfly wings scraping against his stomach. He was afraid to disappoint Sherlock, afraid that he’d muck it all up and that Sherlock wouldn't be satisfied, but most of all, he was frightened of what would happen afterwards.
The man turned abruptly, taking long strides to the door before John finally found his voice and called out: “Why are you helping me?” John swallowed nervously, feeling his stomach clench up in anticipation as the man stopped, one hand on the doorknob and the other resting relaxed by his side.
As Sherlock's mouth began to move south, John could see the bruised red skin left behind, a physically mapped trajectory of bites from Sherlock's teeth. Then, a hot, slick tongue was drawing circles around his nipple, flicking the bud until John was straining against his restraints. He wanted to sink his fingers into those curls and tug.
As John contemplated whether it would be beneficial or not to actually check the time, his mobile buzzed on his nightstand. John groaned, sure that it would be Irene blowing up his phone, as per usual, but when he picked it up and checked the screen, it was an unknown number. The dial code was for Westminster.
He feared Sherlock to be the type of man that would take what he wanted and toss the remains aside. John didn't know if he could stomach such a rejection. Sex... sex was simple, and if that was all they had with one another, then John saw no reason to deny them both this basic pleasure.
Sherlock's eyes were red-rimmed as if he hadn't slept in days, and the dark circles beneath them stood out harshly against pale skin. When Sherlock stepped in, long arms curling automatically around John's waist, John brought his thumbs up to run worriedly over the bruises.
John reinstated some of his control as he slipped forward and lowered his lips to her cunt, the tip of his tongue nudging against her clit. Holmes came around, shirt unbuttoned to reveal a chest as fine and smooth as ivory, peaked nipples and the long pale column of a neck John couldn’t wait to sink his teeth into.
Sherlock raised his hand and plucked the air, recalling the weight of the sturdy metal strings of his violin against the pads of his fingers, hearing the delightful twang as it vibrated back into stillness. Sherlock kept his eyes closed and let himself be carried away.
“Oh,” John muttered, disappointed that Sherlock wouldn’t turn up at his flat like he was prone to doing.
“Mycroft, I need a safe place for my pack. I understand that I will be in your debt,” Sherlock stopped pacing, and turned to his brother, a look of sincerity that caused every eyebrow in the room to lift in astonishment, Mycroft, even, who John imagined hadn't seen something like it before, or not in a long time, at least.
Why was Sherlock helping him; the man who had shown the most aggression towards his presence? What was Sherlock expecting to get out of accompanying John on a potentially suicidal mission? In the short time John had known Sherlock, he didn't take him to be a particularly altruistic man.
"I...I can't decide yet. I need time," John stated, keeping his eyes downcast at his hands, wringing nervously in his lap.
The vicar sighed and threw his hands up exasperatedly. “Oh, for the love of- Afghanistan or Iraq, you idiot?”
It'd been a long day at school, even longer without Jasper's continued presence. His best friend had been the only real thing John could look forward to, where school was involved, at least. Jasper had been a light spot that John's personal life at home, with his mum and sister, couldn't touch. Now, he was fighting even more demons than before, while constantly trying to focus on the light at the end of the tunnel. John wasn't sure if there truly was a light at the end of this whole, sordid mess, but something had to happen, there had to be a silver lining.
"No, Mrs Hudson, that's quite alright." They were already halfway down the staircase, and it was a wonder that John hadn't already made an attempt at sabotaging his meticulously groomed curls.
“Not at all,” Mycroft said, waving his hand at the unnecessary question. “I'll have the guest room made ready for you.” Mycroft sat forward and began to prepare himself a cup of tea, no sugar and little cream. “You'll have to entertain yourself during the day. I'll be at the office most mornings and afternoons. Breakfast is at seven in the mornings and dinner is always served at six in the evenings. Anything later, and you'll find your food cold.”
"I'm fine, just... I probably have to be getting home soon to check on my mum..." John didn't want to leave. He didn't want to go back to his depressing bedsit, with his depressing mum and back to his depressing life. He dreaded it. John hadn't had this much fun in longer than he could remember.
The next room was a party of six, all engaged in some sort of sexual act. Sherlock had only attended one orgy during his time at the club, but he had never been good at sharing, so it hadn't been a memorable experience. The fourth room was vacant, but the fifth and sixth were couples who were bored with their sex lives and wanted to spice things up. Of course, most of these people were elite members of upper society. The club came with a high membership price, but Irene never made him pay. This was where it had all begun for Sherlock. Irene liked to refer to it as his home, free of rent, free of debt, always open to him.
"So I've heard," Sherlock returned, pulling away and turning to a hallway further inside the flat. John's tunnel vision didn't allow for anything other than following the thin line of Sherlock's back as he threw open the door to what John could only guess was a bedroom.
"... fucking, cock-sucking shirt lifter! Don't ever say no to me!" John slowly sinks back into the present, ears ringing as the man screams in his face, accompanied by flying spittle that hits John's cheek in tiny splatters.
The men suddenly fell quiet, looking to Gillian, but John didn't know if they were looking to see their leader's reaction, or for him to disprove Holmes' declaration.
They waited for a moment until Holmes was well out of earshot before Janine turned on him with a sly, inquisitive smile. "What exactly did I just interrupt? Thought maybe I walked in on the two of you shagging." That was another thing John appreciated about Janine; she said what she wanted to say, when she wanted to say it, and the woman had a wicked sense of humour.
Mycroft placed his hands in his lap and looked down at them briefly before catching Jasper’s eyes again. “I offered him a place in the RAMC, and now he has accepted.”
A short time later, the driver pulled the car to the kerb in front of a row of Edwardian style buildings. Although most were refurbished, the buildings held an authentic look with rustic bricks and wooden porches. The large bay windows were picturesque and John could just see inside some of the flats, how large and cavernous they were. They all looked exactly the same from where he stood.
Holmes smoothly rounded the corner, where John couldn't even turn on his heels without the soles of his cheap shoes squeaking loudly against the floor. He envied the posh git his gracefulness.
It was during the scenes that Sherlock became what he truly was behind the suits: the sociopath, and Jim had reveled in every twisted second of it. Some days, Jim couldn't sit straight for the welts on his back, and dear him, it had been delicious.
"You're not as much of a genius as they say you are if you can threaten a man who currently has the upper hand," Förstner growled, his composure finally giving way to reveal the insanity beneath. "It's just your luck that I'm feeling generous today."
His teenage years weren’t all that happy following his multitude of reckless decisions, but Sherlock could never bring himself to delete any of it.
This was purely for his fulfillment, not just some quick, passionless blowjob that would leave John feeling cheap and bereft. It was worship, a veneration of his body like he'd never experienced; the constriction of Sherlock's throat over his shaft as he sucked him deeper, the feel of the man's velvet tongue caressing the veined ridges of his cock. John didn't want to think about the aftermath of such a devastating encounter with this strange man, but he had an inkling that Sherlock would be on his mind long after the night was over.
Sherlock hands were gripping the back of John's shirt desperately, his lips soldered to John's at this point as he licked into John's mouth, caressing. John loved the way he tasted, craved it more than any caffeine. He pursued it zealously, moaning as the hardness of Sherlock's erection pressed against his inner thigh. Sherlock grunted against his lips as John's teeth scraped against his tongue, touched Sherlock’s arse with venturing fingertips.
She’d been a hopelessly enamoured pathology major and he, an outsider that sought to understand human connections yet loathed them at the same time. He hadn’t treated her very kindly but the more time they spent there, toiling quietly side-by-side, hopelessly enslaved to their respective sciences, Sherlock began to value her presence.
John didn’t have time to think any more on it, because something warm and slippery was burrowing beneath his balls and trailing between the cheeks of his arse, confident that he wouldn’t push away. Just past Molly’s thighs, he could see that shock of dark hair and pale hands holding his legs apart, massaging the back of his thighs.
“What do you do, then?” John asked, pushing an oily curl from Sherlock’s forehead, if only to get an unhindered view of his eyes, pewter grey now that the lights were off and the fervor had lessened to something more bearable.
Sherlock gave him a look that clearly conveyed his impatience with John's inability to keep up. "No, you idiot, I fancy you, because you stand apart from the rest. I fancy you because you are the first person in many years that is causing me to
One sweaty curl brushed against John’s forehead, tickling, and he reached up to push it away, which ended up with his hands pinned above his head and Sherlock’s cock thrusting against his hard enough for the backboard to hit the wall.
"... Oh, Sherlock, would you put that dreadful thing away! Your mother would be appalled at your table manners! Time was, we didn't have any of those little gadgets, if you can believe it. We actually held conversation at the table during meals-"
John turned away, running his hand over his face to stifle a groan. If the ground opened up then and there, he would have been happy to let it take him.
Once inside, John felt the tension in his body unravel like a coil, and he breathed a sigh of relief as the scent of fresh food invaded his senses. It smelled like mulled wine and mince pies, fresh cranberries and brandy butter.
The words ran rampant around his mangled mind as he helped a red-faced John back into his seat and knelt beside him. John avoided his eyes, his own hard around the edges, yet painfully vulnerable.
John looked weary as he peeled off his jacket and toed off his shoes. His date was nowhere to be seen, so Greg could only conclude that it hadn't gone well.
The last time John heard those words, Sherlock was tempting him into a world he knew nothing about, and ever since, John hadn't been the same. He could only guess what this would do to him.
The waitress apologized profusely and shoved a handful of serviettes insistently at John. Her face glowed an alarming shade of fuschia. Holmes was not amused.
John released a breath he hadn't known he'd been holding. Okay, so Holmes wasn't a complete arsehole, and he seemed to genuinely need someone to fill in for Janine while she was in cookery school. The thought eased whatever tension had been creeping into his shoulders, and John relaxed back on the bed, thinking of what to reply with.
John nodded, going off script to acknowledge a statement he thought was peculiar. "And when you say, you're not a man of the people, what exactly do you mean?"
It’d been two weeks since “THE scene”, as John began to refer to it; the one where Sherlock strung John up, fucked him out of his mind and then gently bathed his aching body, afterwards. The next morning he roused painfully with an aching backside and numbs limbs. John nearly tore Sherlock's head off when he tried to convince John to leave the bed, because it was
John smirked, and the urge to kiss the smile off his face was nearly irresistible. When he was close enough, a dripping hand reached out and circled his nape, pulled him in. Lips, soft and wet, bestowed a lingering, closed-lipped kiss upon his own.
She cut herself off  and walked to the couch, slumping down on it with a huffed breath. Her eyes glistened in the lamp light as she regarded her son with crushed disappointment. The way she was capable of saying many things with a single look spoke volumes as to who John took after.
Because he'd allowed John to sleep so long, the infant stayed active throughout the night after having another bottle and well into the morning, when at last he fell asleep.
But saying that John was just as precious as his Stradivarius would be remiss. John was more than. He was the quintessential example of something that should be cared for, invaluable, which he’d learned during the man’s absence. Precious was far too dull a word.
John allowed his body to go slack in response to the warning. Sherlock wasn't asking for his surrender, he was
"Look at where you are, and look at what you at what you are doing," Sherlock spoke as if he were coaxing a wild horse into submission. “Control yourself.”
Sherlock returned the box and baseboard and replaced the whole lot back beneath his sock index, sans riding crop.
“I'm not your sister, John,” Sherlock stated, and when John began to pull away, he held tighter, hissing, “
When John catches the candy, he eyes it curiously, then places his lips round it, but Sherlock is impatient, because all he wants is for John to, "Bite it, you have to
Relieved, John lowered the phone back into his pocket and retreated to Sherlock's room to dress. In the closet were the clothes Sherlock commissioned for John, still enclosed in a garment bag. John pulled it out and laid it on the bed, pulling the zip down to reveal a steel grey silk shirt. For the moment, John relished the smooth slide of the silk resting against his skin, the thinness of it in comparison to the jumper he’d had on before. It felt luxurious and expensive, and so very far above his means.
In a move that John wasn't expecting, the human grabbed frantically for his pocket and stuffed something in his mouth, but it was already too late. Sherlock was ripping into his throat in a vicious display that made John’s stomach turn in terror and disgust.
John swung with Miss Vicky, allowing her to lead as her long legs took them across the stage. He threw his head back and laughed as across the room, Irene shrieked, having been thrown in the air by one of the male dancers, and caught around the waist.
“No,” Sherlock replied, though this time there wasn't a hint of playfulness in his tone. In fact, he seemed rather put out, so Greg decided not to push the issue. Instead, he made it his mission to bring things to a head. A man could only take so much sexual tension in a room, and Sherlock was enough of a terror without the added effects of pining.
The only one that always called instead of leaving a text, as Sherlock preferred. Always the infuriating busybody.
Janine took him on a tour of the floor and informed him of everything he needed to know about his position and what it entailed. It was basically everything John had expected, from filing paperwork and screening phone calls, to having a hot cup of tea waiting at Holmes' desk every morning. Then there were some things he found unusual, like Janine's instruction to make sure Holmes ate at least once a day and if it looked like the man hadn't slept in twenty-four hours, send him home. It sounded to John more like taking care of child than a job as a personal assistant. He wondered how much Janine got paid for all the extra work she seemed to be doing for Holmes.
Because really, there wasn't a pie that Jim Moriarty didn't have a finger in. Puppy really ought to know that.
"Look at you, so close already, I can feel your balls drawing up," Sherlock said, his voice low and breathy, then planted a soft kiss on the head of John's cock, where it peeked from beneath his foreskin.  "You won't get to come until I've fucked you properly."
It was the most awkward that it had been since John's initial meeting with Sherlock, and it unsettled him. Now he wasn't so sure what to say. Fortunately, Sherlock began first, so John didn't have to worry.
“Mrs Watson,” Sherlock rumbled in a rich baritone. It wasn’t unpleasant to listen to, she thought absently.
Someone moaned, John couldn’t figure out who. He hadn’t felt his throat vibrate, hadn’t felt Sherlock’s breath on his arm.
Sherlock walked backwards to sit on the edge of his bed, staring down at the white powder with pained longing. He had two options.
The sound that issued from John’s throat was nothing short of a plea. He refused to believe it could be a whimper, but whatever he intended it as, Holmes understood the subtext as he lowered a hand to stroke John’s cock.
From the moment Sherlock left the set earlier that day, John hadn’t been able to forget the piercing quality of his steely blue gaze, those plump, perfectly bowed lips, and the soft curl of his hair. Seeing it again just a few hours later, John couldn’t help but admire the man’s striking features. Even without the set lighting, the elegant cut of Sherlock’s high cheekbones highlit a row of straight white teeth and dimples that framed the curve of his lips.
His frame was still throbbing from the attack earlier, but he felt curiously sated after the impromptu tussle with the alpha. It felt right to have someone to follow; it felt right to John to submit and surrender his control to another entity. Though he would probably be leaving in a few short days once he'd fully recovered strength, John thought it wise to show Sherlock that he didn't have anything to fear from him. It would make his stay a lot smoother if the man weren't antagonizing him at every turn.
John didn't say anything for a several long seconds, but instead, focused on evening out his breathing. Finally, he was calm enough to speak. “What do you want to know?”
“Pleasure,” Sherlock murmured, offering his hand for a perfunctory shake before striding off toward what looked like the kitchen while the three of them settled into their seats. From her vantage point, she could see the clutter of beakers and test tubes as well as papers strewn about the table. In the midst of it all, a microscope. A scientist of some sort, then, Julia gathered. “Tea, I think.”
Although the other wolves had gathered to speak amongst themselves, Victor and Sherlock held a silent conversation in the the center of the room. It was intimate, and John looked away.
When Sherlock pulled away, John was mesmerized by the thin strand of saliva that left them connected. The poignant scent of sex hung heavily in the air, stifling and heady. He found it hard to breathe, seeing Sherlock so disheveled, those dark curls creating a corybantic halo around his flushed face. The connection was broken when Sherlock leaned up to place a soft peck on the corner of John's lips, where the laugh lines were beginning to fade. It was discomfitingly familiar, and John could feel his stomach bottoming out at the touch.
Try as he might, John couldn't withhold the groan or the way his eyes squinted in pain at the glimpse of two heads, one dark and curly, the other a sandy blond on the front page, undoubtedly Sherlock and himself.
“And you're telling me the day of…,” John asked slowly, a vein just beginning to protrude near his temple. It was a bad sign when his face flushed an angry red. “Sherlock, how do you know I didn't have anything planned with Mike or Sarah? My life doesn't revolve around you, you know!”
Sherlock smiled fondly, clearly enjoying the sass, just as much as the view, as his eyes slid leisurely down John's chest, and then up, until their eyes met again. John couldn't help the little thrill of desire as he recognized the beast that lurked just underneath Sherlock's skin. He was hungry, and sod the sandwich, John was too. "I'll have to disagree with you on this, John. I believe I've found exactly what I was looking for."
While their apparent host tinkered round in the kitchen, Rupert managed to drag succinct answers from John’s stiffened lips. Every few seconds, she would catch his eyes as they flitted toward her and away.
Over the line, Sherlock scoffed, and John could hear the shifting of fabric as he moved. "Don't be dull, John, I don't allow rent boys to sleep in my bed after intercourse.
Lestrade held John in his arms, staring at the infant in perplexity. Now that he was so close, his eyes widened as he noticed the similarities. "Christ, Watson, for as long as I'm breathing, I will never let you live this down." Then his eyes grew soft as John began to babble nonsensically. "Of course you'd survive this. Knew you couldn't leave old Sherlock alone."
Quickly, Sherlock stood, already feeling his pants grow damp with moisture. John stood as well, his jaw clenched tight and nostrils flared as he backed towards the door. "Uh, Sherlock? I think-"
He’d been afraid to name it, so Sherlock did what he always had done when confronted with things he didn't understood. He buried himself in his addiction and severed all thoughts until he had time enough to suss it all out.
The water was warm and soothing on his skin, washing away the stickiness of semen from the night before and the sweat of his feverish dreams. The steam danced around his body in thick, suffocating clouds, and suddenly, crawling back into bed and forgetting all about Holmes, was all John wanted to do.
Downstairs, Mrs. Hudson was baking something that smelled of freshly baked bread and a tangy-sweet aroma that drifted up through the floorboards. Her telly blared Connie Prince, probably to block out the noise from upstairs, or either the walls were just thin.
Sherlock smirked, and John’s eyes drifted unwittingly to the perfectly shaped bow of the man’s lips. “The vicar who is ordinarily here. It's most certainly one of the clergymen that have been sending coded death threats, though the vicar certainly isn't without fault. Classic case of a man abusing his power, but I won't go into details. I've said enough. Your turn, now. Afghanistan or Iraq?
Molly moaned into his mouth, rotating her hips up into his grasp. John matched her with a groan of his own as he pressed his tongue past her lips and let it tangle with hers.
That must be how celebrities felt, never having a moment to themselves in the public eye. John wasn't anybody by any means, but Sherlock was, so why should it come as a surprise that the Paparazzi would cotton on to a suspected new relationship for the millionaire?
Irene threw her head back in a dramatic laugh that stretched her pale throat into a long, tantalizing line. If John wasn't so annoyed by her presence, maybe he would have found it an attractive display. "Of course you don't, dear. Forgive me if I'm being a bit cryptic. I really can't fault you for your ignorance on the matter."
Not only did those questions beg to be answered, but John wanted to know everything there was to know about Sherlock. It would certainly help in the way of any future surprises.
“You didn't,” John agreed. “I dunno. It just sort of seemed like the right thing to say.” John stared at the ground with a faraway look, bemused, before his eyes shot up to Sherlock’s hopefully. “Did I get it right?”
The mounds of Sherlock's arse were soft and plush under his touch, tight yet yielding and perfectly rounded. John pulled his hand away before his thoughts ventured towards dangerous territory and inhaled sharply as Sherlock grasped him round his back and pulled him forward until there was no space left between them. Their erections kissed and John couldn't withhold the tiny thrust at the contact, but Sherlock's hand stilled his hips, grounding him back into the moment.
The words gave John pause, in which the sentence filtered slowly through his brain, catching on the word ‘flatmates’. John exhaled breathily, not sure if he’d heard correctly, because surely, this man who knew almost nothing about John wasn't offering him… a home.
“Leaving, then?” John asked before Sherlock could speak. Sherlock could see his silhouette go still behind the frosted glass. John’s head cocked slightly, a bronze smudge.
John beamed, feeling reassured by this woman's welcoming nature as he ascended the stairs. "Thank you, Mrs. Hudson!"
His mother's tinkling laugh filtered through the line, light and airy, just like she must be feeling from the drugs, or else she'd be bawling. "You know I used to forget your father's name all the time. His name is Hamish, like your middle name, and I would call him Haywood up until our third date. Isn't that funny?" She sighed and John heard the clink of something hitting the table. Probably the needle. “Dear thing was always so sweet about it.”
"Sod off," John chuckled, pulling the blazer on, before taking the shoes back to his bed, where he sat to put them on. The blazer wasn't too tight around his arms, and allowed room for him to move without feeling constricted. Surprisingly, the whole get up was quite comfortable. The boots were a nice finishing touch, and John found himself eager to see how it all came together.
"Right through here. You don't have to knock, he's expecting you," she said, stepping off to the side and facing John. A tiny secretive smile curled the edge of her lips, as if she knew something he didn't. "Oh, and Mr Watson, don't look so frightened. Trust me, his bark is worse than his bite." With that cryptic statement, the woman turned and sauntered back to the front of the office.
John is running from a vicious gang of hunters, but encounters something more terrifying along the way.
Sherlock was watching him struggle to take it all in, pleading with him to understand, but there was so much John knew he wasn't saying. "You still don't understand," Sherlock stated, with a tinge of frustration. "No matter, you will soon enough."
“I had sex with a man in the army,” John said, so softly he might as well have been whispering. “Men…”
Sherlock had been surprised when they’d arrived at John’s modest flat and the man pulled him to the bedroom. Had Sherlock known what John wore underneath the innocuous shirt and the denims, he didn’t think he would have been able to sit through dinner. Then, he’d unhurriedly stripped to reveal a black corset that shaped his body and little black knickers with the usual—but never tiring—garter belts attached to matte black stockings with lace around the top.
John paid the cabbie and hurried into their tiny, two bedroom flat, calling out to his flatmate as he entered. "Mike?"
Sarah smiled, a cat that ate the canary kind, that has John scooting quickly in the opposite direction. What was it with him and devious friends?
"I'll never forgive Mycroft for this," Sherlock murmured against the bed of tousled, blond hair, sullen and tired.
The cabbie cleared his throat pointedly, lifting one shaggy, grey eyebrow in the rearview mirror when Sherlock snapped his eyes over to regard him. He retrieved his wallet and paid the fare, plus a bit more with added instructions. “If I’m not back in ten minutes, you may leave.”
Sherlock's sleeves were rolled to his elbows and the top two buttons on his shirt had been undone, revealing an elegant line of creamy flesh, a long pale throat that swallowed under at the sight of their reflection in the mirror.
Sherlock was an odd alpha, one that seemed irresponsible and carefree; despairing of his position as pack leader. In the forest, Sherlock had run off without a thought for Molly or Lestrade's safety, but John assumed it happened often, because neither one of the wolves pursued him. Even though these were the qualities of an abhorrent leader, John found it embarrassingly easy to submit to Sherlock.
“What the hell was that back there?” John started in as soon as they settled into their seats. “That was a bit of an overreaction, don't you think?” John was outraged on the waitress’ behalf and wary of the man who sat so calmly opposite him, as if he hadn't just caused a scene in a busy restaurant.
Sherlock's skin was all smooth lines and fleshy marble, and his eyes were blazing sapphires with flecks of emerald. His bare form held a sort of equine grace, hidden power beneath a deceptively lanky frame. Sherlock's thighs and calves were thin but well muscled like a cyclist and parted under John's inspection, his aroused member jutting out proudly from a thatch of light brown hairs. John skimmed over it briefly, watching as it twitched in reaction, before he continued his exploration.
Anxiety crashed into him, untenable and didn't let up until the car was pulling up to Baker Street. He shot out of the car and up the stairs, not waiting for John before he was stomping up the stairs to 221B and slamming into his room.
The head of Sherlock's cock was hitting John's prostate with unerring accuracy, a feat Sherlock always seemed to be able to keep up with each time they had sex. Though, John thought, he shouldn't be surprised. He was sleeping with someone who was nothing short of a genius. If anyone knew the ins and outs of anatomy, it would be Sherlock.
John laid himself slowly on the bed, over the sheets like some virginal sacrifice to a hungry deity. Sherlock's eyes never wavered in their intensity, and John had to force himself not to squirm beneath the weight of that infinite stare.
John was close enough to the screen that a few stray drops bounced through the gaps in the screen and landed against his cheek. John's orgasm happened upon him quicker than he expected, and so intensely that he couldn't move a muscle while his cock spasmed over and over. Warmth rushed through him like a pleasant tingle that faded away in his extremities, until John could finally move again. When he was able to focus again, John's hand was dripping and there was a puddle of semen on the wood beneath his knees.
The woman hesitated for a moment, fretting silently where she stood at the bedroom entrance, before she visibly steeled herself and stepped forward, holding out the the bowl to John.
“Good,” Mycroft hummed, now back to his BlackBerry. “Let's get you home and into the shower. You're ruining my upholstery.”
His hands, which he’d held firmly on John’s hips to steady him, dipped to the sliver of bare skin beneath the waistband of his ill-fitting trousers. Like a magnet to steel, the temptation to cling to John, to touch him, was irrepressible.
"So...," John started, a pathetic prelude to what he was sure would be an excruciating discussion, "you want to use all of that," he motioned with a slight shoulder tilt to the cupboard, "on me?"
By midnight, John was noticeably older. A few of John's familiar signs of age were beginning to emerge, the smile lines at the corner of his lips, and the wrinkles on the sides of his nose.
"Of course," he murmured, a small, secretive smile playing across Sherlock's lips, "what else could I expect from you, John? You, who surprises me at every turn."
Sherlock scoffed, turning to look at the two of them as they stuffed their faces with bread and meat. "Nothing a simple DNA test couldn't have solved. It's a wonder anything was ever solved before I began working with Lestrade." John watched the man gesture wildly with his hands heavenward, as if begging for mercy, which John supposed he was. "The IQ of the Yarders could bring down the entirety of London alone." The words were scathing, but the man said them as if he were talking about the weather.
"No," Lestrade shrugged. Sherlock was pretty extreme when it came to the hostility he'd shown John. "Just thought you ought to know. Well, I'll leave you to it, then."
Sherlock never appreciated benediction until John was saying his name, letting it float upon a low, strangled moan, or the way his strong fingers would dig into the wings of Sherlock's shoulder blades on a down stroke. No amount of prayer could save Sherlock from his downward spiral at that point, the final fall into John that he experienced when he finally reached the pinnacle of their joining. Sherlock's stomach clenched and his muscles tensed, and the adrenaline was enough to send him skyrocketing to the moon and back. John's belly arching against the line of his own body, curving like a bow with the force of his orgasm, what more could a god give him that he didn't already have?
Sherlock was very obviously a bachelor if he lived like this. There was nothing but papers and books, and odd knick-knacks cluttering up the room. It was chaotic and mysterious, and so much like his employer, that John couldn't stifle the giggle from moving past the barrier of his lips as he peered around.
Sherlock guided John toward the restaurant with one hand on the small of his back while the other held the door open for him.
The doctor cleared his throat uncomfortably. “Ah, well then, I'll leave you with your brother for the time being. Don't hesitate to press the call button if you need anything.” Another pair of shoes – faux leather, cheap – retreated towards the room door, and with little fuss, Sherlock was left alone with Mycroft.
His reflection stared back at him, unkempt blond strands, an unrefined slump against the wall and wide, wandering blue eyes. Sherlock had moved to his side, no longer hovering over John, but close enough that John could feel the warmth radiating from Sherlock's clothed body. Sherlock met his gaze in their reflection, heady and sloe-eyed.
"I was wondering if I could use the loo? I promise I won't take but a moment." John couldn't help fidgeting under the woman's keen, blue gaze. He plucked at his fingerless, tattered gloves and shifted his weight between his feet, feeling like the grime on the bottom of his shoes.
Jasper swept into the room looking decidedly more comfortable in a plain grey top and checked pyjama bottoms. "God, I feel like I haven't eaten in days. Do we have anything to nosh on?"
"You can leave at anytime, John. I won't stop you if it's what you truly wish to do, but we both know that should you choose to stay," Holmes' burned, a low, sensual croon in his ears. He leant forward, bypassing John's lips, and dragged his own against the younger man's jaw, "I
Sherlock allowed the words to settle between them, and John swallowed at the weight of them. “And why didn't you?” he asked with a tight throat, hoping that Sherlock hadn't heard the crack in his voice.
"Oh, you know how she likes to fuss when you come home," Rupert grinned, lugging the bag into the boot of the sedan. "I wish she would cook like this when you're away. I swear the woman is trying to kill me off some days."
Sherlock made sure to pierce the dermis quickly, perpendicular to John's fingerprint, his gaze darting up to see John awake and staring at him distantly, lips drawn down into a teary frown. He still didn't move, but his whimpers were more pronounced. Quickly, Sherlock placed the slide under a drop of blood before setting it to the side. He dabbed the tiny pin prick with the cotton ball, holding it on the finger with one hand and pushing John's sweaty curls back with the other.
"Sounds 'bout right, Alf. What do you think we ought to do 'bout it?" The question held an abundance of possibilities, and John shivered at the thought of every single one of them. Either way, it wasn't going to be good.
Every step shared a memory, and as he ascended, Sherlock remembered each one clearly, until he stood before the door. Images flashed before his eyes like old, sepia-toned film: Pressing John back against the door, showing him 221C for the first time, soaking up the wonder in his wide blue eyes. So naïve, so young and changeable. Sherlock had thought that the moment John laid eyes on the room, he’d bolt. But John, unpredictable John. He’d submitted, opened himself up to be trussed up, touched, taken in ways he’d never experienced before.
When the driver pulled to the kerb, Sherlock was ready to throw John into the back seat and drive far, far away. Instead, he rolled up the partition and let the driver carry them to Baker Street.
Jim sat forward, suddenly feeling the need to watch that impassive façade crumble beneath his words. “Sebastian here has been kind enough to share some....
John blushed bright red, in chagrin and frustration. The fact that the man could be so blasé when John was struggling to keep a calm exterior was extremely maddening. He brushed a hand over the front of his shirt and glowered at the man sitting opposite him. Holmes had already dismissed him and began to tap away on his phone once again.
Sherlock watched her out with a raise brow, and when the door closed, he turned sharply towards John. "You've had a lovely day off, I presume?"
John suppressed the urge to salute. The bossy, controlling side of Holmes was beginning to emerge. "Yes, sir," John replied.
Without preamble, Sherlock walked to the cupboard and pulled out a sturdy metal chain with two leather cuffs attached at opposite ends of one another.
John filled up the kettle and switched it on before coming to stand at the entrance of the sitting room. “Sorry, Greg,” said John, a bashful, apologetic smile curving around the corner of his lips. “I know you had plans tonight. You should've gone. I'm sure Sherlock is okay to be left alone for an hour or two.”
John smiled down at his lap and patted himself on the back for his small victory. "Okay, next question. Why are you so big on this control thing?"
John’s head tilted submissively to lay against his shoulder as Sherlock ran the warm washcloth over his cherry-stained lips, his free hand wrapped around the smaller man’s waist to rest on his belly. Sherlock couldn’t take his eyes off their reflection, and the way John’s eyes gleamed as the vanity lights hit them.
There are some minor depictions of violence/violent BDSM sessions, but it is ALL consensual and absolutely none of it is between Sherlock and John.
Sherlock was aware that John trusted him with his body, or else he would have drawn the line. Sherlock wanted to know if John trusted him with more than his body; did John trust him with his mind, emotions? His heart?
Sherlock stood as he came closer, that oddly handsome crooked smile on his lips. “John,” he greeted, stepping forward to wrap his arm around John’s waist and place a soft, chaste kiss on his lips. “Magnificent, as always.”
"Do you think you're not worthy of the position, John?" It was a simple, yet loaded, question, and Sherlock's voice revealed nothing other than curiosity, but John knew that underneath, there was more to it, as if he were being screened.
John shifted and Sherlock didn't need to see the shame in his eyes to know that he was berating himself, being so predictably ordinary that it pushed away the unease and replaced it with simmering anger. What
For the second time that night, John found himself looking into soulless, cold eyes that held less than honourable intentions. "Fuckin' tease, walking off like that when I'm talkin' to ya! You must think you're somethin' special, eh, blondie?"
"You do realize there is a high probability the hunters are expecting you to return," Sherlock spoke suddenly, though, his voice was pensive, and lacked its usual caustic edge. "They're intelligent enough to understand that there's a chance your presence here wouldn't be accepted."
In a seemingly random turn, the atmosphere in the room changed, as did the music, an unpredictable choice where Sherlock was concerned. The air between them crackled with something more charged and primitive. A low, rhythmic bass filtered through the plugs, as did the clear, seductive pitch of a woman crooning softly over the beat.
Now, the light of day brought with it new worries. It was Christmas day, so there wouldn't be many people out, save for the lonely few. The shelters were probably full and the food nearly gone, so John packed away hopes of a hot Christmas dinner.
His fingers twitched, mimicking the movements he’d learned by habit, feeling the hollow thrum of his violin strings beneath his fingers. Sherlock wished he’d brought out his Stradivarius before allowing Lestrade inside. Nothing got Mycroft out of the flat quicker than a Paganini composition, although Sherlock was partial to his concertos. Another thing he and his brother had never been able to agree on.
"We'd rather not, thank you," Anderson intoned, sulking like a child who'd just had his lolly taken away.
The office was thankfully empty when John opened up for the morning. He'd been cutting it close as it was, so John made a beeline for the electric kettle, and started on a fresh, warm cup of tea to place on Holmes's desk before he arrived.
Three years into his service and things were still relatively peaceful at the base. They did their patrols and in the months where there was nothing much to do, John was left to stitch up the scrapping soldiers and treat minor illnesses.
"How sweet," Holmes derided. "How about this: I'll allow you to ask me anything you'd like, as long as it's one of your own questions."
Sherlock undid his own zip, slowly pulling out his cock and stroking it lightly, eyes trailing over his lover's young body. Ripe and untouched; John knew older men liked those things, and he'd never engaged in anything like this, but he had a feeling had he been older, more weathered, that this man would still look at him the same way.
“I’ve got it,” Sherlock said, then pointedly cast his eyes towards the couch and back to John. He didn’t have to say anymore for John to get the hint. He flashed a coy smile and walked away, sliding the robe down his shoulders and onto the floor.
The stranger had his hands up, palms facing out in submission, but Sherlock was growling which meant this human didn't have much time.
Sherlock tilted his head, feigning confusion, though he knew what John was referring to, but... John's voice was pleasant and sent a lance of delight plunging through Sherlock's chest whenever he spoke.
“Yes, I will accompany John back to his territory. There, I may find the necessary data that will give me information as to the source of these attacks.”
Sherlock pushed the hair away from John's forehead and pulled John's fist out of his mouth and reached for the dummy on the coffee table that was included in Mycroft's care package, and pushed it past John's lips. "As well as can be expected. He's taken care of, spoiled if I'm honest."
It felt like the air between Holmes and himself had risen several degrees, suffocating him. John shifted uncomfortably in his seat as he brazenly attempted to match that steady gaze.
John smiled fondly at his partner and stood, taking it slow because he’d been kneeling for quite a while. “What kind of favour could the vicar possibly owe you to allow you to enact a fantasy in his confessional?”
The sudden shock of air brought John back into his body when Sherlock pulled away. The man grabbed his hand and pulled him across the pavement and into the backseat, the car pulling away from the kerb and into light traffic as soon the they were securely inside.
is where you live," John asked, dumbstruck. He was expecting Venetian fountains and French doors, not old, crumbling steps and an unsecured entrance.
John shifted on his knees. The kneeler wasn't exactly meant for long sessions, and John was beginning to feel it. Also, his burgeoning erection was beginning to press uncomfortably against his pants. He cleared his throat and elaborated.
John moved first, lying down over the bed on his side, and Sherlock followed just behind, admiring the gentle slopes of John's hips, the soft, downy hair over his belly and spring of curls that nestled his cock.
The door opened to a beautiful woman with chestnut skin, a bright row of gleaming teeth and large, brown eyes framed by thick lashes. Her hair was cut close to her head, but it highlighted her sculptured cheekbones and the strong shape of her jaw.
John sighed, knowing the man was right, but he couldn't go another night off measly scraps and rain water. He needed something solid, and John knew the Work was the only means to a full pocket.
"Up to floor thirty-four, Mr Watson. Good day." The woman offered him a winning smile, and John nodded a thank you. He pivoted and headed in the direction she pointed to where a small group had already assembled to wait for the next lift.
The human whimpered, wide eyes darting between Sherlock's massive jaw and dark, glittering eyes. A long, pink tongue swiped across his dripping muzzle. John had never been sure if Sherlock was a man-eater before. Not all wolves enjoyed the taste of human flesh, but the gleam of hunger in his eyes as he pinned the man left no doubt in John’s mind.
“You mine as well share with the class,” Sherlock griped, and John could feel his face heat red with blood, unsure if he was willing to share his fears with the Alpha. That would mean telling him what happened that day, to his pack, and his utter failure to defend them.
"...like you, Sherlock, and I know that you're not offering what I want with you, so I'd rather save you the headache and me the heartache, understand?"
Rupert Watson was possibly the kindest man anyone could ever meet, and John wished he'd inherited more of that from his father. It was John's mother that had more of a temper out of the lot of them, and unfortunately, so did John, and his sister, Harriet.
Before he could move to block her entrance, the woman threw the heavy wooden doors open, an admirable feat in itself, peering around the room for a glimpse of a tall, pale figure decked out in the usual bespoke.
She found him sitting at the kitchen table, peering into a microscope at a slide of murky, green liquid. He looked up when she drew near, and pushed away from the table.
"Would you like me to take him off your hands for a little while? No offense, Sherlock," Mrs Hudson said, wrinkling her nose and wringing her hands, "but you smell a bit raw."
His heart sped up as Holmes’ hips began to move against his arse, and though the camera was catching everything, John could almost believe they were alone. Except directly in front of him, Molly had lost her knickers and her gleaming pussy was spread open, two of her fingers pushed inside of her.
"I don't issue threats, dear brother. That was a warning. If you don't send him away, I will personally see to it that Jasper does not return here, should we cross paths."
John turned, so that he was chest to chest with Sherlock, a heavy erection pressing into the bare skin of his lower belly. "It's dangerous, the knowledge that if you accept, you will be mine, and I can do what I like with you. I can fuck you anywhere," here Sherlock pressed John back against the counter, pushing his hips forward so that they sat firmly between John's legs, "at any time."
Sherlock began slow, just barely moving his hips, giving John time to adjust to being inside of him. John was already so close, teetering on the edge of bliss, nearly ready to fall over that cliff, but Sherlock held off for the longest time. “If you come now, you lose,” Sherlock breathed.
Every night, it became routine: Work, home, cocaine, sleep. Work, home, cocaine, sleep. Lestrade came with cases, but they were never interesting enough to distract him.
Alphas. All of them were incompetent fools incapable of overcoming their biological imperative to rut any willing orifice to come their way. They allowed their bodies to rule them, take over their most valuable possession: the mind. It grated. Sherlock couldn't remember a time in which an interaction with an Alpha was even slightly stimulating and didn't end with a proposition.
“Is that what you call it?” John chuckled, though he sobered a bit when Sherlock’s eyes narrowed in a way that could be construed as offended. “I think it’s brilliant, but the delivery needs some work.”
“For a man with a bum leg, you’ve certainly sat on it for long enough without much trouble,” Sherlock commented drily, but the way his eyes moved over John was anything but disinterested. He tilted his head. “You're easily the most interesting thing to walk through that door today.”
"As it happens, we've not found much in the way of a cure, however, we believe the drug was created to target the DNA strand. As I'm sure you're aware after your visit to Ms Hooper's lab last afternoon, you've discovered the rate at which his cells are currently undergoing mitosis." Mycroft paused, staring as John abandoned the bunny and crawled to Sherlock, clumsily pulling himself up using Sherlock's knee as a crutch.
John knew the exact second Sherlock returned from his introspection. His eyes focused with a laser-like intensity onto John, pinioning him to the couch with paralyzing capability. Sherlock no longer appeared overwhelmed by the sensations; now he was the predator, prowling over John, lips stalking over his jutting erection with tantalizing puffs of air.
"Actually, Mike was not well, so he asked me to conduct the interview for him. I hope that's alright with you."
After a light supper from the canteen, and a bit of tidying up, there was nothing much left to do, and John found himself twiddling his thumbs.
Sherlock tore his eyes away and waded forward through the crowd, bypassing the dining table, to drift closer to the stages.
Sherlock's face was a mosaic of expressions, ranging from intense concentration, to admiration, desperation and arousal. His pale eyes were bright and feverish in the darkness of the room, his skin wet with sweat. John arched up to meet every thrust, throwing his head back in pleasure and pain, and confusion at the clutter of emotion clouding his thoughts. How was he meant to go back to the streets after having a taste of this? This was not supposed to be anything other than gratitudinous sex, but it was immeasurably more than that. This was intimate and frantic, and familiar on so many levels, and the tenderness of it stumped John where he lay.
For a man with so little time, John couldn't help but wonder how Holmes could spend so much of it in his office.
So John held his stare and stepped up until their chests touched. Sherlock's heavy gaze cut through the sheets of rain, droplets shimmering like pearls on the tips of his lashes as he blinked once. Then John walked past him and into the foliage, assured that Sherlock was one step behind him.
“Don't worry. You won't be needing that,” the voice called out, and John's stomach plunged. “Come, let's…
Sherlock leant back in the chair and swung his legs onto the desk, crossing them at the ankles. He used to do it often, back in John’s appalling flatshare with Stamford. It would drive John round the bend and then they would have a row that Sherlock knowingly induced, because the resulting sex kept his head spinning for days.
John made his way to the door slowly, keeping his footsteps audible so that Sherlock would hear him coming and open the door, but it remained firmly closed.
With one twist, the door swung open slowly, creaking ominously on weathered hinges. The wave of memories pummeled him with strong, relentless fists and the sting behind his eyes was unavoidable.
Eventually, he suffered the same fate as Murray. John was invalided back to London with a pension and a sad little bedsit to greet him.
John had never felt as uncertain of himself than at that moment. Why was John taking to heart the words of a man who didn't know know him from Eve, nor didn't he seem like an honest character? So then, what? Shame Sherlock for a past he couldn't change? John had his fair share of dark history, so who was he to pass judgment?
Sherlock took his time meandering his way back to John, because if anyone was going to be demanding things, it would be him. He mulled over his words, catching John’s eyes, allowing him to see only what Sherlock wished him to. Want. Disappointment. Outrage. Underneath his skin, it coalesced until he was swallowing around fury and need, and everything he wanted to do to John was tingling at his fingertips.
John seemed delicate, breakable, a house of cards ready to collapse at any moment. Sherlock was almost afraid to touch him, but he did. He raised a hand to John’s cheek, his heart plummeting at the first touch of stubble against his palm. John watched him, though his eyes were guarded, fingers fidgeting in his lap as he regarded Sherlock with longing and a deep sadness that echoed in his own chest.
John shrugged, pulling himself from his reverie and going to sit in the chair Sherlock hovered next to.
The stranger was standing at the counter with the oddest array of knick knacks, bargaining, John assumed, with the amused shopkeeper.
Sherlock scoffed and rolled his eyes. “You’ve obviously been spending too much time with the Americans.”
He turned to Holmes holding her juice in until their lips met, salty liquid spilling down to their chins as Holmes wrapped an arm around John’s waist and pulled him forward.
With the beginnings of a migraine battering the edges of his consciousness, John returned to the couch and stretched out on his side facing the back of the couch with his arms crossed around his middle and knees pulled up. His eyes felt cottony behind the lids, as if little threads ran the width of them. Even with all the noise of Baker Street, the traffic, the blaring horns and screaming babies, burnt rubber, and bantering teenagers, it seemed as if life had come to a standstill in 221B.
It was beautiful and not at all what John envisioned his first time with a man would be like, but more than satisfied.
His hands trembled where they wrapped around to grip his legs, unable to contain the sob that broke violently from his throat. John felt like retching until there was nothing left of him. He'd never known a sorrow like what he was feeling. When he left Sherlock's pack within a few short days, he would truly be alone, with nothing but the knowledge that the only thing awaiting him were the hunters and a sure death.
His pristine suit screamed wealth, from the handsewn hem of his trousers to the cotton collar of his pressed shirt.
Greg wanted nothing more in that moment than for the building to collapse and bury him in the rubble. Quickly, he cut in to save them both any further dignity. “Sherlock! Sherlock, shut it.”
John gingerly stepped over Sherlock’s feet and pushed into his space until John’s knees were flush against his inner thighs. For a moment, they stayed like that; trapped in one another’s orbit like hopeless moons, constantly revolving around the other.
Though Sherlock didn't feel anything more than a distant disdain for Sarah Sawyer, he was desperate enough to reach out to her when John failed to answer any of his calls or texts.
Sherlock's glamour was slowly lifting, and now he felt bereft, deprived of something. It made his gut churn in disgust.
Nothing, absolutely nothing could describe the horrific free-fall of his heart diving straight into his gut, nor the fact that John could literally hear the blood racing in his veins. Metaphorically speaking, John was on fire.
The other man watched quietly, a gleaming, knowing look in his eyes. John was almost sure that at some point, this man must have been in his position before. "Easy does it," his tone was placating, but his voice had a gruff quality that made every word he spoke sound akin to a low growl. "More where that came from if you behave."
It was only a matter of time before Irene found out, not that John was Sherlock's dirty little secret. In fact, Sherlock had planned on letting everyone know that John was off limits, but that would imply many things that weren't true, including the misconception that they were more than bed partners.
He finds John searching for his sister near a grotto, flashlight in hand as he scours the area, though he doesn't see Sherlock's approach.
Stamford shrugged. “You’ve been snapping at everyone in the lab, lately, and we’ve all had just about enough of it,” he said. “I come to places like this sometimes, just to enjoy a good show, especially particularly stressful days. Maybe you’ll follow suit, if it makes you feel better.”
a student and he interviewed me for a school paper.” Sherlock didn't understand why he felt so nervous, so eager for Victor’s approval when it shouldn't mean anything to him. He wasn't ashamed of John nor how they met,but for some reason, Victor’s opinion of John seemed important.
John tapped down the contact menu until he reached the words 'Mum', and pressed the call button. The phone rang for a good minute, but John knew to wait. She would answer eventually.
It was cold – cold and dark, and Jasper desperately rubbed his hands together to generate heat. It kept his uncovered fingers from becoming frostbitten, but after a while, not even this would be enough.
It was new and exciting, and as his venture into pharmacology continued, he found that he was never bored with it.
Lady Grey came to stand next to him, almost a head shorter than he, and more than formidable competition for the woman eyeing Sherlock up from the bus stop across the street. Sherlock stared down at her, and she, up at him, lips tilted up at the corner. “Needed air. It can get a bit stuffy in the back, what with all those bodies crammed into limited space.”
"John," his name rolled off that skilled tongue like a lover's caress, soft and breathy, sending a frisson of pleasure curling down John's spine. Holmes set off every excitatory neurotransmitter in his body, and John found himself struggling to take hold of himself once again. Holmes took a step forward, and John took one back defensively.
Holmes raised his hand and almost immediately a waitress materialized beside the table, two chilled glasses of water at the ready, one of which she sat at Holmes' elbow, and the other before John. He wondered if she had been standing nearby awaiting a summons from the pompous git. Before she could stutter out a greeting, Holmes was already ordering.
John couldn't tear his eyes away, and Sherlock was staring at him like he would disappear at any moment. His thrusts were growing inconsistent as he lost control, pistoning his hips into John's savagely.
Mrs. Hudson emerged from Mycroft's car, moving quickly towards John, and frighteningly, he could see the tears welling up again. Dear God, no.
Sherlock growled against his skin and swiped a hot line up to John’s ear that nearly made him come in his pants. “This mouth can do anything you want,” he purred. “And for the record, you should know I’m more partial licking arse than sucking pussy.” At this, Sherlock slid his large palm down John’s back and grasped his arse, his long middle finger pointedly pressing into the seam of John’s trousers, right over his wanton hole.
"Sherlock," John said quietly, "let me up, please." He wasn't even sure Sherlock heard at all because the man just kept right on going until he froze mid-stride.
It was Holmes’ business card and a mobile number scribbled on the back of it, along with an address and a time.
John issued a shaky breath as Sherlock kissed a slow path across the back of his head while his fingers crooked to stimulate John’s prostate.
Most people John worked with did what they had to do, collected their cheques and went about their business. The sex was generic and unoriginal at best, and a number of the men John worked with often needed fluffers or Viagra to get hard. Over the years, John had attained some modicum of professionalism, and every case was purely for entertainment. He didn’t have sex with any of them and leave with a connection. But whatever was happening with Holmes was beyond any experience he’d had in the porn industry, and John would be lying if he said he wasn’t intrigued.
John couldn’t filter his words even if he wanted to, but the malicious tilt of Sherlock's lips informed John that his words wouldn't be taken lightly. Just as easily as Sherlock donned the persona of a perfect gentleman, he shed it with ease, falling back into his familiar cynicism. “I suggest you leave John. Your presence is no longer wanted or required,” he intoned impassively.
"Was he anything like the rumours say?" Mike asked, overtly curious. John contemplated holding out on him just to be vindictive, but the truth was, he was quite eager to tell his friend what occurred with Holmes. Mike always had some kind of wise advice to give and John was not going to pass that up.
“Come on, let’s get out of here,” John said when they separated. Sherlock agreed and turned off the water. They didn’t spend much time drying off, swiping their bodies quickly, Sherlock donning a silk gown and John, the clothes he’d retrieved from beneath the couch where they’d been kicked during the flurry.
Sherlock wasn't much for talking during sex, and neither was John. He preferred the intimacy of throaty moans and broken sighs, would rather allow their bodies to communicate where words weren't necessary. At that moment, however, John wanted to hear Sherlock speak to him, listen to that lovely baritone flow through him like a fine brandy, intoxicate him.
Sherlock clasped his hands behind his back, rocking back on his heels like a preening child. He cleared his throat. "I... I hadn't thought of it in that manner before."
He stepped out of the room and closed the door, then lay his forehead against it. Could he trust John with that part of his life again? Would it be worth it?
The lounge room was nice and spacey, almost as big as the tiny little bedsit he occupied with his mum and Harry. There were things everywhere though, as if someone just picked up papers and books and sat them down wherever they happened to be standing... and was that a real skull on the mantle?
Sherlock stopped before him, hands shoved in his pockets. "You decided to take him up on the offer. Due in part to your sister's attempt on your life, perhaps."
Sherlock skimmed his hand from the small of John’s back to circle his waist. “Then, I hope Lady Grey knows how to share.”
"All right, John?" Lestrade was staring intently at him now, concern etched over his lined features as he regarded the younger man. Molly looked up as well, soft brown eyes curious and worried.
Sherlock graced him with a lopsided smile, a hint of that smug, arrogance glinting in his gaze. “Eager, indeed,” he hummed. “I haven’t been ridden like that in many years, and never with such skill—oh, wipe that self-satisfied look off your face.”
The sound of his knuckles popping snapped Sherlock out of his reverie. His fists were tightly clenched against his thighs, stance rigid and brittle as he fought himself. John’s admission was tempting, but it was not enough. Sherlock wasn’t sure what qualified as “enough”, but at the moment, he was sure that John wasn’t in any state for emotional upheavals, so he’d leave it for the time being.
After they washed and John made sure they both ate and rehydrated, Sherlock took him to bed and soothed his aching muscles with his lips and hands until John was snoring beneath him.
"I want to take you back to 221C," Sherlock whispered without elaboration, and John didn't need him to expand on it, because they only ever went to 221C when Sherlock wanted to be the worst of himself, the darkest part of himself. John shivered. He wanted it, too. Sherlock kissed him again, his tongue darting provocatively past John's lips and into his mouth, and this time it held more bite and less patience. It was an oral exhibition of the things Sherlock wanted to do to him, and John was
John wasn’t even looking at him. The stiff line of his back trembled slightly beneath his vest, arms folded as he avoided meeting Sherlock’s gaze, the coward. Sherlock wanted him to see, to observe all that was taken away from him when the idiot ran off to get himself killed in a bloody desert.
John washed quickly and turned off the water, grabbing a clean towel off the rack before stepping out, wrapping the cloth around his waist. He brushed his teeth and left the loo, exhausted after a long night with no sleep and his talk with Sherlock that morning.
“You passed out from exhaustion, so obviously the hunters had been chasing you several hours before you got to my territory. You were alone; your pack was massacred by hunters or else you would have no reason to run from them. Most wolves stay and fight, you were fleeing, which meant you had no backup coming. The hunter you were fighting had a collection of used bullets in a pouch, most likely trophy's from his recent kills. By the number of bullets, he killed six of your pack mates and was planning on gloating once he caught you, before he rid you of your pathetic life, of course.” The stranger tilted his head the other way once the stream of word had come to a stand still, as if changing perspectives and leaned closer. His words were spoken without emotion as if he were just listing off names and numbers, rather than the fact that John's entire pack had been slaughtered and he was next.
Jasper turned the paper over, wishing for more words, but was met with a blank white canvas. His lip trembled, reading the words over and over but it wasn't enough; it would never be enough. John was gone, like a dream that came in the middle of the night and vanished by day.
“Shut up,” Sherlock snapped. “I don't know how else to convince you, John,” he stated, his hips falling still. “I've never wanted anyone more in my life, and yes, my past is sordid and shitty, but
John's breath was sweet against his face, and Sherlock watched as those eyes burned a trail down Sherlock's body, heated and more telling than any words the man could say. Sherlock ran his hands up John's shoulders and up, up, up into a crown of golden strands and clenched. Slowly, Sherlock began to undulate his hips over John's erection, rendering himself breathless at the tortuous friction. John's hands were at his hips, guiding them as his lips played succulently at junction of his jaw and neck.
John stood up straighter, under the man's sharp eyes, determined not to be cowed. “John Watson, yes.”
"I'm your employer, John. It would be remiss of me not to know these things. No matter how intriguing I may have found you, I don't hire just anyone to work for me." Sherlock paused, breathed in. "Also, I'm aware of who you're with at all times.
John’s chest had begun to heave rapidly under the onslaught of Sherlock's words, and Sherlock refused to look away until John finally nodded, blinking rapidly.
Finally, at the end of his rope, John stopped and turned, pointing a cautionary finger at Sherlock. “Stop this, Sherlock, I mean it. You don't have to like her and it really doesn't bother me whether you do or don't, but do me a favour and don't ruin this for me.”
He peered up under his lashes, desperate to see the desire in Sherlock's pale gaze. Sherlock didn't disappoint.
And it was true enough. Even now, John looked so much the same, yet immeasurably changed in a multitude of ways. He still brought sunshine to 221B. There were moments when Sherlock forgot he’d ever left, but then he would see those blue eyes turn inward and hollow and he remembered the six empty years yawning between them.
“She has a history of sexually transmitted diseases, John. She's slept with any man whose given her even the slightest amount of attention. Her wilting flower persona is nothing but a hare-brained attempt at making you believe she’s some virtuous woman, when she’s nothing but a harlot. It’s laughable is what it is,” Sherlock griped, following John around as he prepared for his date.
Sherlock was knuckle deep inside of him, loosening his arse for inevitable penetration, until it pressed into his prostate with unerring accuracy.
"I'm not yours to keep," John replied defiantly, coming to stand in the center of the room with Sherlock so as to even the playing field. All this looming over him was starting to become irksome. He wasn't fooled by the man and his fake smiles. He saw the darkness in Sherlock's eyes.
“I-um… thank you, Sherlock. For letting me stay the night.” John swallowed, brows furrowed as he flicked his eyes between Sherlock and his own clenched fists. “I don't—um, expect you to forgive me or anything, but it's nice—”
"I... I trust you with this, Sherlock," John responded, keeping his voice light and submissive, allowing Sherlock to see that whatever he wanted to do to him, John trusted that he would come out of it sated and with peace of mind. "Whatever you want, Sherlock..." It was all fine.
John turned his head toward the take-away bag on the table and raised a brow, the corners of his lips fighting a grin. “Angelo’s risotto?” he asked, tilting his head toward the food.
John ignored him and carried on, walking to a well-known spot, where he was familiar with the other poor souls selling their bodies to make ends meet. Behind him, the man cackled with his friends and called out to John again. "Fuckin' cock tease!"
Mycroft shrugged and sat back in his chair, crossing his legs at the knee. “I only ensured that John Watson will never come between you and your father again.”
The warning was met with a strict silence, just the constant buzz of the flickering fluorescent lights above them. Sherlock set out across the hall, staying against the wall as they edged towards the door.
John didn't have any pre-existing memories, and whether or not he suffered from anterograde amnesia as well was as of yet undetermined. Sherlock would have to wait some time to see if John was capable of retaining the information.
Sherlock tilted his head in a vaguely reptilian way, computing, Julia realized, though she didn’t know what. It didn’t matter, as long as he processed her message.
"Now," he began, his hands resuming their previous pose beneath his chin. "I thought that given our time together and the activities therein, that we'd established a level of trust with one another.  Why do you feel that you couldn't come to me with this right away, John?"
No, John was not ready yet, because… well, because he couldn't stop staring at himself in disbelief. Victor Trevor, it appeared, was a man who knew how to make a damned good suit. Of course John already knew this, could tell by the cut of Sherlock bespoke wardrobe, but he never thought that he would see it on himself.
They lingered there for an hour or so, at times filling the silence with light conversation and others, merely enjoying one another's company. John hadn't said a word when Sherlock pulled out a cigarette, though he cringed away when he leaned in for a kiss, afterward. It only baited Sherlock even more, and soon they were necking like teenagers (accurate in regards to John, but something Sherlock hadn't done in years).
It was mesmerizing, watching John grow right before his eyes. No matter how long Sherlock kept his eyes on John, the changes were always subtle enough not to be noticed by the human eye. Once John was old enough, Sherlock would make a note to interrogate John on the changes his body underwent, how it felt, did he know when it was happening?
John’s head shot up. He’d been on a few cases with Sherlock, but never one that took them out of the city. It was Sunday, and John wasn’t headlining that night, but he still wasn’t sure that Irene would be too happy about him skipping out. “I don’t know, Sherlock. Irene-”
It was too slow, too genteel. Too human, and neither of them felt much like being anything but savages. So, John wasn't surprised when their licks turned to nips then to bites until they were waging war on one another's bodies.
Slowly, he slipped from John's hold and pulled away, keeping his features clear of any telling signs, though there was a storm wreaking havoc in his mind, tossing his thoughts into chaos like waves.
He willed Sherlock to face him, tugging gently on his lover’s bicep. The hand attached to Sherlock's lip dropped, and the man turned to stare down at him with a wonderfully expressive crystalline gaze. “Caring is not an advantage,” he said, as if reciting words he’d heard a thousand times before.
The shower was on, and John was glad for the steam shrouding the rather pathetic image he reflected.
John didn't know how to reassure her, could barely even reassure himself that the tenuous thing he had with Sherlock would last. Her words were wary, however, and John wondered what in Sherlock's past had made her so.
Sherlock didn't make a show of looking away or pretending that he hadn't been staring; he just went back to work and kept his lips sealed shut tightly. Afterwards, John was constantly aware of Sherlock's intense perusal.
“The French are glad to die for love… They delight in fighting duals, but I prefer a man who lives and gives expensive... jewels!"
Sherlock wanted to take him, but it wasn't that moment, and John didn't want to disturb whatever was happening between them because it was a new and fragile thing, easily rendered unavailing and cast aside. No, it had to be about more than the sex.
John's breath was ragged beneath him, stilted with every thrust of Sherlock's hips. Sherlock groaned as John's legs tightened around his waist, dropped his lips and tasted what was being offered to him. John's skin was soft and damp, the area at the base of his neck salty with sweat. His other hand was gently stroking John's cock, just enough to bring him pleasure but not enough to let him come. Sherlock wanted to prolong the moment, wanted it to last for an eternity, even if that eternity was the few moments they had left together. Sherlock wanted to be buried inside his young lover until he wouldn't forget what it felt like to have John wrapped around him.
Sherlock planned on taking his time the next go round. He was going to partake in what John had on offer; nibble at him until he was a crying, shivering mess. Shed his clothes, sink down over him and cover up that body with the length of his own. It would be a slow possession.
Sherlock sauntered to the cupboard, relaxed and unhurried, much to John's disquietude, and scanned the items with a scrupulous eye.
“Julia, you’ve had your say. Let me speak,” Rupert forged on with calm authority. “Your mother and I aren’t sure what made you run off to some dreadful desert, but I believe you owe it to us to provide an explanation,” here he turned to his wife. “And we owe it to him to listen.”
Mycroft held his gaze for a moment, until Sherlock turned on his heel and left the room. No apology, but what else had he expected from Sherlock? Sherlock rarely did anything and felt the need to apologize for it. He didn't get that sort of thinking from their parents, so it had always been a curiosity to Mycroft where such behaviour stemmed from.
He stood on the pavement, resisting the urge to scratch his head, confounded by the situation he found himself in. Mike always found a way of convincing John to do things he would never do otherwise. The year before, Mike was due to record a lecture given by the world's leading neuroscientist, and he'd begged off at the last minute citing familial obligations. Mike begged him to go, and although John was currently in medical school, these lectures did a better job of lulling him to sleep than enlightening him.
Lady Grey threw her head back, playing flustered as she fanned herself with her hand. “Ah!” She drew up, crossing her legs and slashed hand across her neck seriously. “But get that ice or else no dice!”
John stared up into soft, chocolate eyes, determining just how much information he should be forthcoming with. The man seemed friendly, however, just a bit confused. John stood and held out a hand, which the gentleman took with a genial smile. "John Watson," he introduced, forcing himself not to wince at the strong grip. "I'm just filling in for Janine three days out the week, while she's in cookery school."
Sherlock was pulling off his suit coat the moment they passed the threshold of the bedroom, taking care to place it on a hanger and on the doorknob.
Sherlock pulled back, his face carefully blank. He sat back against the door and turned to stare out the window, but as always, those crystalline eyes were watching John all the way
The corner of her lips quirked up the tiniest bit before she turned on her heel and strode out of the room, leaving the door where it was as she went.
John gagged immediately, covering his nose with the sleeve of his shirt as he surveyed the ramshackle room and the deteriorated corpses. What was left of his kin had been picked upon by scavengers, and upon close inspection, a home for smaller organisms. John turned, watching as Sherlock took it all in with dispassionate grace, but his eyes were lit like torches. With some disgust, John even noted that Sherlock seemed somewhat excited as he leaned forward to examine the bodies. Sherlock's long, slight frame circled the room like a bird of prey, peering down at the emaciated corpses, though he - barely - refrained from touching.
Jasper didn't try to mask his disappointment, but he nodded in understanding, knowing that nothing could change John's mind. Jasper knew that if anything happened, John would blame himself and his inability to prevent it.
In the lab, Sherlock situated the pram to face the stool as he readied a sample of the blood that Molly initially extracted from John, and used a dropper to place a pearl of blood on a glass slide to place on the stage of the high-powered compound microscope.
