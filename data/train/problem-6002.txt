"Well, technically he asked for a job, but considering the oftentimes dangerous products and experiments I couldn't hire a minor. However, Poppy came with the solution of an intern. As long as he's supervised, he can work at my company. When he'd old enough, I plan to give him an actual job."
His dad's raccoon, Basil, was walking back and forth on the back of the couch, leavinga brush of cool air in Peter's neck every time he passed by him. Qatara, on the other hand, was seated perfectly beside his pops, ears switching between up and alert and flat in the neck in concern.
Right on cue it seemed, rapid beeps emanated from the heart monitor. Bruce approached the device to see what was wrong while Raakel moved closer to Peter.
I'm borrowing Ned gain, really I should start calling this Peter & Ned grand adventures XD Anyway, still basing my spider-man on TASM despite the usage of Ned.
A burst of static came through the ear piece before a choppy answer managed to get through the bad connection. "What do you mean by that? It's right there on the main control panel. You can't miss."
In my head, I've sort of added two years give or take after Avengers 1 for the couple to actually get together. So kinda messed up the entire timeline :)
"There you go!" Pops yelled to be heard over the wind. Peter laughed as his joy bubbled to the surface.
Peter offered no resistance when his pops lifted him into his arms and carried him to the bedroom. Everything had turned into a blur of movement and actions and before he knew it both himself as Kalyca were tucked into bed and blissfully drugged by medicine and painkillers.
"You did the best you could, Peter." Steve stepped forward, but Peter abruptly turned away. "Peter - "
Peter grimaced at knowing what was waiting for him upstairs. His dads were protective and quick to worry which considering who they were and how many enemies they probably had, wasn't a bad thing. They just got a little overprotective with Peter.
"Happy, please. Pepper is out of town and I really need to go to this meeting. I can't leave him alone and I won't take him to some strangers without having done a thourough background check, which I don't have the time for right now."
Devlin's answer was to turn away to look out the window. Gwen already knew though. He'd enjoyed her company, much like Gwen had enjoyed Peter's company. Though the daemons had barely interacted, Gwen had felt Devlin's curiosity for the otter daemon and his shared fondness with Gwen for Peter. She was defnitely asking him out again.
A frustrated noise was all Peter got as response before sounds of a scuffle could be heard. He was about to inquire if Quill was alright when the door to the cockpit burst open and the alien bug came right for him. Peter quickly webbed it to the ground to slow it down before leaping over it and through the now destroyed door. He knew he had little time as the creature possessed some sort of acid liquid that could easily dissolve his webfluid. Something he found very interesting, but not at this moment.
"What if you linked my suit with Friday, somehow? I know my suit isn't made of metal and stuff ,but I'm sure you can figure something out. That way, Friday can monitor me and if I get injured, badly, she can alert you. You won't have to spy on me." Peter added with a gently chuckle, his adrenaline fuelled anger having subsided.
"Peter, come in here a sec." Curious and slightly wary, Peter turned around and entered the kitchen. Though seeing all his family together in the kitchen was not too unusual, but the smug expressions the two spies gave him pause.
Peter couldn't explain why he did it, maybe Ned just had a trustworthy air about him, but he pulled off the mask. The reaction was shocking to say the least. Ned made a strangled, half choking noise before suddenly engulfing Peter in a crushing hug. He awkwardly patted his back, not wanting to outright push him off.
"Hey, Peter. Would you like to come inside for a bit? It's pretty cold out tonight and you look like you could use a warm drink. Do you like hot cocoa?"
"No!" Aunt May threw herself at Ben's side, trying desperately to stop the bleeding but only succeeding in spreading it over herself. Peter sat frozen with his uncle in his lap unable to look away from the fading daemon of his uncle.
"Very happy." Steve answered as he cuddled up beside Tony for the remainder of their evening, basking in the knowledge that his family was safe, loved and happy. He felt like his second chance at life was finally worth it. But even more importantly, was what Tony said next and how much it had taken for him to finally find true happiness in his own life.
Oof, almost couldn't write something for this prompt and my day is almost over. 1,5 hours to midnight but I managed to write something, finally. It's nothing fancy, nor thought through. Just a real quick drabble written in a few minutes.
Bruce reached out to calm the teen but the moment his hand touched Peters' forehead his eyes snapped open as if in shock. Peter moved so suddenly that he caused Bruce to stumble back and when he recovered Peter was no longer on the bed.
Being deprived of his sight was unnerving, but it provided the advantageous effect of enhancing his other senses. Just as he felt the dirt wall beneath his fingers thin out, a terrible smell reached his nose. Apparently Scott had noticed as well.
"It's a good thing we have each other then." Peter answered with a grin on his face, but it dropped at the serious look he got back.
"Goodnight, Spider-Man." Otto said criptically before a smoke bomb of some sort exploded in his face and he lost consciousness.
"All I know is that Peters' DNA has been drastically and irrevocably altered. But I do not know how."
Raakel stalked in front of him, blocking his view of the screen and its data, Her ire was clearly projected through the bond and he couldn’t really fault her fort he outburst as she was part of hi mand thus a part of him felt frustrated as well at his lack of action regarding Steve and Tony. They were Peter’s parents, for god’s sake! They deserved to know.
"I'm not sure." There was no point in trying to sound brave when he was aleady found out. Peter nervously stretched to try and peak over the edge, but he made no move to step closer to the edge.
Tony walked away, only to be forcefully turned around by Clint. "You don't get to walk away. What happened is the worst pain imaginable, I would know as I've got kids too, Stark. I can imagine what you're feeling." Tony was quickly shushed before he could interrupt and Clint's next words hit a bit too close to home. "Peter was your everything, but he was that to someone else too. Do you think Steve is doing any better than you?"
. But you need to talk to me. Eyes on me, Peter." Peter's gaze returned to Natasha at the calm command after drifting across the room in search of something again. Nat's calm composure seemed to have an affect on Peter. It surely helped that Peter had been rather close to her. They'd met several times when Peter was very young due to Fury having sent her to spy on Tony, before Tony became an avenger.
Kalyca curled up on his lap, worry about what the message could hold nagging at them both. Peter pressed play.
"You had better!" He couldn't help but snap back. He didn't mean to be this person, but his son was missing! He couldn't think straight, let alone mind his manners.
Tony was no stranger to nightmares, especially when he was worried about something or someone. In this case, Peter. So the nightmares that followed that night were not unexpected. What was unexpected was waking up abruptly from a nightmare, only to feel as if he were still dreaming. Emergency lighting was flashing in his room and from the sudden movement beside him, Tony knew Steve had awoken too and was already up. Tony quickly followed his lead, sparing a quick glance to find Basil nervously fidgeting on his nightstand, before turning his attention to JARVIS.
Tony sputtered indignantly, crossing his arms as a defensive manoevre. "Of course not. I do not tear up at every single thing."
Seeing as he wasn't getting through that thick skull, Peter decided to indulge the other teen. "I stopped a bunch of criminals who were building something with alien tech at the docks, but the device blew up and launched me into the bay."
Perhaps the kid was taking a shower and couldn't hear him? Though it didn't sound like a shower. Something wasn't right here. Sam had a bad feeling. Apologizing mentally to the kid, he opened the door.
Peter looked up, surprised to see none other than Gwen Stacy approaching him. It took a moment for Peter to get his head straight and stand up to greet Gwen, who by then was looking at him with an amused expression.
"I'm not sure it would be safe." Tony answered, but his son was already getting up so he followed him into the kitchen. He watched nervously as Peter tasted the probably ruined dinner. True to form, Peter managed to keep a straight face, for the most part. "It's horrible, isn't it?"
Tony stared at the tear-stained face of his little boy as he placed the little bandage on his knee. He hated seeing Peter like this, but he had an idea to cheer him up. "There all done, well almost done."
He didn't know how long it would take for Peter to calm down, but Steve would stay like this for however long his son needed. The first loss was always the hardest and unfortunately Spider-Man had experienced that today.
"Did you ever think about who will save the people in this city if you are dead?! You need to think about yourself for a once!"
He didn't get an answer from, but Tony had no chance to do anything his husband wasn't already trying, when Friday alerted him of reinforcements arriving within minutes. They needed to get out, now!
The reason Friday did not detect anything wrong with him, is because Peter either hacked her to not report on him or she likes him enough to not report on him. Whichever you like better.
Peter jumped when he looked at his hands which were black, or rather his suit had turned black. "What is this?" He wondered out loud.
The doctors and nurses swarmed the medical bed upon wich lay Tony Stark. Steve held on to Peter, needing to restrain his son from rushing into the fold and to remind himself why he wasn't rushing to his husband's side himself.
"It's alright, Cap. He is right, but more importantly, I didn't mean physical. Peter's change was on a micro level. Whatever altered him did so fast and violent, which is why his body shut down. It couldn't handle it all at once."
They walked cautiously into the living room when an excited whoop was yelled. "Yeah! that's what I'm talking about!"
He swung underneath the falling wall, using his webs to stop its descend by tying it between two adjecent buildings like a hammock. He dropped beside the woman, lifted the rubble to let her crawl out before turning concernedly towards her.
His dad whirled around, his fury back to a burning flame in an instant. "You're not an Avenger. You don't belong here. Now. Get. OUT!"
"Please!" Peter yelled himself hoarse as the electric current singed through his body, setting his nerves on fire and making him shake in his binds. Mercifully he was allowed a moment of reprieve which he used to gasp for the air he expelled while yelling and begging for mercy.
"It's just, I don't know what to call you anymore. You were uncle Steve to me or the great Captain America. My dad is my dad and my birth dad is my father. But I don't want to call you that because it feels too distant and we're not distant and I am ranting. Sorry."
Below them, he could hear the familiar noise of the Iron Man suit, circling below them and yelling triumphantly up at them. "I did...I did it!" Peter yelled back, all his fear forgotten now that he was actually flying.
, but it was worth it. He could only enjoy it for a few fleeting seconds before he was punished for his defiance, but at least it kindled that dying ember of resistance inside of him. Enough for hope to flicker through.
It was a good suggestion and Peter had plenty of uncles and aunts in the hero business to have some back up. He wouldn't even need someone all the time, just someone he could call upon if things got out of hand, like it had tonight.
"Do you think I enjoy hurting you?" Peter didn't grace the question with an answer. "You do, of course you would." He stepped closer, using the chair to balance himself and leaned over Peter, as if trying to intimidate him. "I'm trying to
"He just died, Steve! Who knows what else is wrong with him. Bruce said himself he hadn't been able to figure everything out yet. Wish he'd hurry up already and tell us."
"My apologies for interrupting, but I just received a phone call from Mrs. Parker." JARVIS commented.
"And why should he reveal himself to us? Usually when someone hides their face it's for a good reason."
"And why is that?" The question was spoken carefully, but Peter could tell his pops was worried and probably expecting the worst. He wasn't known for wanting to skip anything school related after all.
Peter swallowed past the lump of emotions clogging his throat. Maybe it had been a bad idea to leave unannounced as he had.
"It's okay, papa." Peter answered sleepily. "Are you cold?" Before Steve could answer that, Peter pushed himself onto his feet and promptly hugged him. Steve smiled at the sweet gesture.
"Heard you." Came the short answer as Peter snuggled into his side. Steve held him close, kissing the top of his head. "I'm sorry, kiddo. Didn't mean to wake you up."
Peter looked away from the collection of villains, despite evidence indicating they were anything but villains. His world didn't make any sense anymore and he'd had quite enough of it. It was childish perhaps, but even he had his limits and this day was the worst he'd ever had. Kidnapping seemed like only a minor issue to deal with and one he was oddly familiar with. It was easier to focus on just that, rather than the obvious issue of the
"Steve is going to kill me. Best keep the kid alive." Bucky spoke out loud, before joining his nephew in the battle.
"Hey, Ned. Where's the kid?" Ned was frozen again. What was he going to do now? "Is that the kid's bag? Why do you have it?"
"What-" Happy again didn't get to speak as Ned continued, this time revealing the most damning information he could ever give up.
Despite his resolve, Happy couldn't help but smile at that. Tony scooped up his son, and wow wasn't that still a strange thought, causing Peter to giggle loudly. "It's because he's such a happy person!"
spidey sense is new so doesn't catch everything yet, hence the dude sneaking up behind peter when he was so focused on the threat in front of him.
There were many strange looks sent his way before Clint spoke up. "Isn't that why you hired the kid in the first place?"
"Pete, -" His dad seemed to struggle to speak and it was uncanny. His dad, the great Tony Stark had never faltered as he did now. Unwillingly, Peter's heart picked up feeding on their distress. Already his head was shaking left and right, as his subconscious already seemed to catch on, but Peter's waking brain refused to put the dots together. His pops sealed the deal.
"Nah. Just a bit boring really." Sam opened the fridge, furrowing his eyebrows at what he saw. "The hell? Since when did we run out of...well
Peter convinced Friday to help him gather all the avengers in one place. Not mentioning they were summoned by Spider-Man certainly helped. Even though it probably wouldn't be a good idea to confront them at the Tower, it was Peter's home too and he felt more comfortable there. The hostile looks from some were unnerving, but mostly Peter noticed grief and shock when he crawled along the ceiling into the room.
"Peter, kiddo...you know we wouldn't lie to you and especialyl not with something this important." His pops words were sincere and held truth. Peter knew they wouldn't lie to him, and yet his mind refused to give in. His pops, his dad, both of them were lying to him even though they never would and never had before.
"No, Gwen wait. It's absolutely you're business. You work there and I had no right to be there. In fact you didn't rat me out, for which I'm grateful but also confused."
"Pops!" Peter stumbled in his surprise before bending over to catch his breath. "Sorry, I didn't hear you."
The grieving parents were interrupted by a loud screech from Raakel. She was standing next to Kalyca, flattening herself to the ground as if afraid or perhaps shocked? The reaosn became apparent clearly when Kalyca took a breath!
“True, but her situation can change, so keeping an eye on her is time well spent, unlike someone else I could mention.”
It was a drawing. Peter couldn't help but smiled fondly as he recognised the name of the recipient, remembering that very important day.
Peter looked up at him, a slight tremble still to his voice after his scary fall earlier. "Not done yet?"
As soon as the pen touched the paper a strange sound distracted Tony. Looking down he saw Basil, his daemon. His attention was drawn to something behind the social worker. Tony couldn't be bothered to remember his name. Following Basil's gaze, Tony froze when he realised he was looking at a young child.
"Now you're relaly stretching it, Ned. Listen, I was not kidnapped, nor killed, nor brainwashed. Trust me, I've got an entire superhero family and two very protective dads. If something had happened to me, I wouldn't be allowed out of the tower for forever!"
Said teen was not looking at him, but rather at his own hands. Peter didn't know how long he stood there, however hurried footsteps thundered down the hallway, drawing his attention away from whatever had just happened to him. No less than four medical people rushed into the room stumbling to a halt as they stared at Peter. The urge to run, to escape became so strong, Peter found himself moving without consciously deciding to do so.
Change was indeed annoyingly difficult, especially if you had recently been bitten by a radio-active spider and were suddenly capable of crawling on the ceiling. Not to mention hiding that very fact from right under the noses of the avengers.
Here's day 2 for fictober19. Though it is tagged as superfamily, it's mostly background stuff. Tony and Steve are only mentioned and established as Peter's parents, but they don't actually appear in this.
Today however, it was Happy who was going to the mystery floor. For the first time ever. He would admit only to himself, that he was a little bit nervous. He steeled himself when the elevator pinged and the door slid open.
"Peter!" Sam leaned down and gently touched the kid's shoulder. Peter jerked in surprise before looking up with a dazed look to his eyes. "Peter? Can you understand me?"
. Despite feeling uneasy in this suit -which was weird as it was exactly the same except for the color- Peter swung his way home, hoping he would get answers there.
A large explosion catapulted Peter right in to the bay. He felt an electric current sizzle through his nerves, setting them on fire and causing him to reflexively cry out. Too late did he remember he was underwater leading to him inhaling a mouthful of it. His body thrashed at the invasion, instinct makijg him acutely aware of how bad this was. He struggled to right himself, the explosion having knocked him around so thoroughly that he couldn't tell up from down anymore.
Peter tried to the word out in his head before smiling back at Steve, no pops. "I think that might work and it kinda suits you."
"Scared, me?" Tony scoffed teasingly. "You know me better than that. I knew we'd find you." If he was expecting his son to look relieved or reassured, Tony was about to be disappointed.
"Were you scared?" He asked a little louder and clearer than before. He just sat there staring at him waiting for his answer and thinking Peter needed to feel safe, Tony decided to act confident hoping to instill in his son that he was safe and no one would get him here.
"Do you have- ! Can you even- !" Steve couldn't even finish his sentences, his throat clogging up as images bombarded his mind.
Peter smiled a genuine smile, feeling suddenly a lot lighter. Before either of them were aware, a good hour had passed. "This is nice. Thanks for staying." Peter spoke up after they'd both fallen silent for a few minutes just comfortably sitting together.
Peter felt suddenly less confident. Did his dads even know what had happened? Had anyone even seen them fall? With no hole to hint at the accident, how would anyone find them?
"And if I hadn't gone out there, that building would have exploded and everyone inside of it would have died!"
"I can see that. Trust me it was not what I was expecting, but honestly I've seen some crazy things. I shouldn't really be surprised."
Happy watched the kid go before going to opposite way towards the parking garage. He snuck a peak into the bag, finding two strange looking gadgets and a very familiar mask. This was really happening. Peter was actually Spider-Man.
Tony nodded letting Steve gently pull him back when the medical team Bruce had called, arrived to take his son and Kalyca. All that mattered was that Peter was alive. His little boy was alive.
"Not again. Why is this happening. Just let go!” Peter pulled with his entire body but his hand refused to release the wall. With every tug that failed, he grew angrier and more desperate.
"You are not taking Peter." Uncle Ben held his ground, but Peter saw the slight nod the leader gave and suddenly hands were on him, pulling him back. Another man had snuck up behind Peter. He had been so focused on the threat in front, he had completely missed the other threat closing in.
"Honestly.....tickling....is a bit....childish, isn't it?" Tony managed to answere in between gasps of air. Steve just smiled knowingly at him. "Very well. yes I did tear up a little bit. Happy, now?"
"What is it?" his aunt Nat prompted, her curiosity getting the better of her. He often teased her how she'd become soft now that she had a family of sorts. He'd surely payed for that in their next training session.
"I guess, I didn't want you to get in trouble." Gwen blushed ever so slightly as she said that, looking down at her hands to avoid more embarrassment.
. He snapped his head back foreward and stared for a few seconds at his own hands. Then as if his body caught on to his mind, his fingers lost whatever connection allowed them to stick to the ceiling, and Peter came tumbling down.
"Just don't feel like you have to use it. If you want you can keep calling me uncle Steve for as long as you want."
He pulled away for real this time and was gone long before the avengers had been informed. No matter how much he trusted his family, if there was even the slightest chance of Gwen being hurt or
Panic gripped Peter as he turned and turned and looked but Kalyca was nowhere to be seen. His breathing sped up and he started running again. Trying to find her. As he turned a corner he collided with another person who grabbed hold of him before he could fall.
The mission as it was called, was nothing like Peter expected. It was utter destruction. His family had launched at the guardians as their opponents had been called with no care for the city or its people. There was no delegation of jobs, just pure madness and chaos as his family tore the city apart trying to get these guardians.
The secret is out and Peter is in a heap of trouble. Unfortunately his dads anger is the least of his worries when the wrong kind of attention finds him.
"You're not useless, Tony. Just being there for him is enough. Let's get some rest, you certainly look like you need it."
Appearing disappointed, the masked man stood up and turned forlornly away from Peter. "I had hoped you would be ready to accept your true potential. But you still do not understand."
Silence finally descended on the two and Ned thanked his lucky stars no one else was in the school right now, but it didn't alleviate his guilt by much as he'd just effectively exposed his best friend's secret.
The slow, steady beep in the otherwise quiet room was only broken occassionally by a deep sigh. Bruce rubbed his hands down his face again as he tried to make sense of what was right in front of him. The data didn’t lie, he’d checked and rechecked it so many times his vision became blurred from lack of sleep. The results on his screen were sound and yet he couldn’t figure out ho wit had happened. The only person he could ask was currently lying in a bed behind him and had yet to wake up since he sort-of-technically died 5 hours ago.
"A risk we're going to take. Spider-Man is not to be harmed, not even as a bargaining chip against the Avengers. That's not how we work."
"Peter get back upstairs." Uncle Ben stepped forward, pushing past the arm that tried to block him and standing protectively in front of Peter. "If you think I'll let some strangers come into my house and take my nephew without question, you are sorely mistaken."
Bruce purposedly ignored looking at Raakel, not wanting to raise to her baiting, but it was hard to ignore the slight smugness radiating from her end of their bond. He knew exactly what she was getting at, but the prospect of telling the distraught parents what he believed to have happened to Peter was not a good one. Besides he’d much rather wait for Peter to wake up so he could help the teenager through the change first. It was traumatizing enough without the added stress and fear of his parents.
Steve carefully stood up but before he could approach Kalyca, a loud gasp came from the bed. Peter had taken a breath!
As expected with his usual Parker-luck, both of them ended up in the water with a loud splash. "Bleh, oh great." Scott looked forlorn at the water dripping from his clothing. "Well, at least a sewer means we might find a way out, but where exactly are we?"
For just a moment the entire world stopped moving. Uncle Ben was holding Peter protectively after having hit the suit who tried to take him and then he suddenly sagged becoming a near dead weight in Peter's arms as he caught him. Peter vaguely heard his aunt May's distressed sob but his entire focus was on his uncle and the blood blossoming on his chest. A squak alerted him to Sioka. Kalyca went and nudged him in what little comfort she could offer for his pain, when she found herself smudged with gold dust.
The drawing made it's way around gaining confusing yet fond reactions as the image drawn could not be perceived as anything else. There were 3 people, in the drawing. A man, a child and spider-man. On the back was written a big 'thank you spider-man', by Jack.
Watching Tony behave like an exuberant father was heartwarming and Happy knew he had already agreed to do this for his friend. He would watch over Peter, protect him, dote on him and grow to love him like family.
Confused and a tad alarmed, Happy rounded the corner and found himself in a spacious living room, with an open-floor kitchen in the back. Sitting on one of the stools at the kitchen isle, was none other than Tony Stark.
were the one in danger! You and every other hero with mutated genes!" He wasn't getting through to Peter. As mature as his kid was at barely sixteen years of age, he was still a kid. But Tony feared his growing frustration at not getting Peter to understand and he was already walking on a tightrope as fear for Steve boiled in the background.
Still holding Peter, is how Tony found them both in the morning. Both passed out on the sofa, Peter's plushy wedged under Steve's cheek and both blankets spread haphazardly across their bodies.
Just then Peter abruptly turned around, crouching into a defensive stance. Standing in the hallway was Clint, Illarias on his shoulder. It looked like Clint got the wind knocked out of him as he held himself even so slightly steady against the wall. Peter shifted and Nat easily read his intend to fight. Semyon whispered in her ear before she could try and soothe him again or potentially restrain him, that someone else was approaching.
"Peter....," Steve trailed off, not knowing what to say right away. His heart broke watching his son struggle like this.
"Stop!" Peter yelled hoping the man would see sense. When it was clear he wouldn't, he tried to web the man, but the angle was awkward enough without the man stepping out of view. Left with no other options, Peter jumped up there. "Please stop. I don't want to hurt you."
Peter immediately felt on the defensive and apparently showed it when Ned hurried to explain. "Please don't leave, Peter! I just need to make sure this is really you. Maybe something happened to you that made you forget me or maybe you're not who I'm thinking. I just want to make sure."
Also I sometimes without noticing change my past and present tenses. Please let me know when that happens. I've more than once written an entire scene without realizing it and never noticed it even as I reread it. Dialogue sometimes causes me to do this, because the characters often converse in present tense and I mostly write past tense and things get all befuddled :) Guess we all have our quirks.
Despite his unease at the words and the way they were spoken, guarded and cautiously, Happy found himself wanting to reassure his friend. "Of course I'll help you, Tony. So what's going on?"
Peter carefully stretched and moved his limbs before even attempting to get back up. With his luck he'd broken his neck or spine, although unlikely due to his newfound resilience as a mutated superhuman. Still, one could never be too careful. His dad must have rubbed off on him after all this time. Peter softly chuckled at the thought.
"You were the Avengers. You had a catastrophic threat to stop across the world. You know I don't hold it against you, any of you." Peter added as he looked at his entire family.
Peter couldn't explain the gratitude he felt for the man, knowing he would go that far for him. "I actuallydon't mind you becoming my parent too. You sort of already are, it's just...it's silly really."
So any and all opinions requested. Which Harry do you think I should base my Harry on? On a side note, this will not change the daemon I have planned for him, just who I'll keep in my head whenever I need to write him.
"Right, sorry. Still getting used to all these advancements." Steve had a pensieve look on his face as if he was remembering all the crazy new technology he'd had figuratively thrown at him. "I should let you get back to you work. Sorry to bother you."
Peter abruptly tossed the boot he'd been working on at Tony, causing Steve to swallow his cry of alarm when Tony caught it as if expecting this kind of reckless behaviour from his son. Considering who raised him, he shouldn't have been so shocked.
"Ah, it means a great deal. It means you are important to me. It means you are the world to me. It means I want you to be happy and safe. I guess all in one, it means I love you."
He's a skinny teenager and you're a supersoldier. I know you don't want to hurt him, but he's going to hurt himself if you don't give a little more."
"Wait!" The call abruptly cut out. For a moment Peter could not move a muscle as shock ran through his body. Then he was running for the lab where his suit and webshooters were. He'd been upgrading them, but those upgrades would have to wait.
In answer Tony walked towards a door that Happy only now noticed and opened it with an almost dramatic flair. Happy slowly walked forwards until he could look into the room and what he saw was like nothing he had ever expected. A young boy, no more than 7 or 8 years maybe, sat on the floor of what appeared to be a child's bedroom.
Peter disappeared from his line of sight, though he could guess where he'd gone from the sudden brush of air flowing into the room. The sciccors had fallen on the ground in front of him, his own blood still covering it. It was those sciccors he stared at until he lost consciousness, even as Steve called for him in a panic that Tony could not even hear anymore.
"It's a secret." He nearly doubled-over in laughter at his uncle's expression. Just for that it was worth it. His aunt Nat certainly agreed.
Peter smiled despite his uncle not possibly being able to see it. "Right, so what's the plan. Doesn't look like we can get out there."
Ned stared at the broken windows as he tried to comprehend what had just happened and more importantly, what he should do now. Peter and himself had been the last two in the classroom as they gushed over a new game, when out of nowhere something big crashed through the windows and grabbed Peter before leaving the same way.
Peter squeezed his eyes shut as his fisted his hands, trying to push down the absolutely overwhelming urge to move, to run, to do something. A hand on his shoulder felt like an attack and he jerked away from the contact in such a violent manner, Stark actually held up his hands in a peace gesture.
He found Peter in the training room as he worked through a holographic training routine. Tony had installed this little upgrade, using Friday to power the projectors. It gave the avengers opponents to fight without actually hitting and thus destroying something or someone. Digital opponents.
"You believed me to be bluffing, Stark. Let this be an example to you. A pity, a child had to pay the price." The alien vanished then, leaving a heart broken family behind.
Peter whirled around on his seat as his dad entered the kitchen, looking as if an experiment had gone up in flames again. "Dad! How long have you been standing there?"
This is a direct continuation of Prompt 5 [Chapter 5]. Also Peter is only mentioned in this Superfamily drabble.
Every human has wings, but not everyone has wings by which they can flynor are everyone's wings made of feathers.
Tony gently stepped away from the comforting hand on his shoulder, scooping Basil in his arms as he walked out of the lab. "Yeah, you're probably right."
"Very well. You have made your choice and now you will face the consequences." In one swift move, the alien put his spear through Peter's stomach.
"Not really. The kid's absolutely brilliant. It would be a shame to lose him to some other company. Besides he's not the worst company."
"What of it?" Peter snapped back. Kidnapped, bound and thoroughly confused and frustrated by everything, Peter could only fall back on his snarky attitude.
A beeping drew his attention to his phone, waterproofed of course by his dad, alerting him to his looming curfew. "I better hurry, if I want to get back on time."
Aunt May refused to let go of him ,so Peter just held on tight. Looking over her shoulder, he noticed his pops in the doorway and he couldn't help but give him a relieved smile. As angry and frustrated as he'd felt the last time he saw him before he'd stormed out of the tower, he was immensely relieved to be back and have both his dads near.
Rhodey looked up at that, seemingly surprised by the question. "What do you mean? Stark always keeps this place well-stocked." He walked up to see for himself. "That's unusual."
"The Avengers have all returned to the Tower, sir." Friday reported as Tony cleaned his son's face as gently as possible. He was clearly awake, but it was like there was no one inside.
Peter was still processing the question when he found himself seated on the couch, his pops face in front of him looking intently into his eyes and it occurred to Peter far too slowly that he was still waiting for an answer. He was prevented from answering by his dad's concerned voice from somewhere to his left.
didn't even understand. He didn't want to tell her something so personal before knowing himself, yet he didn't want to lie to her either.
"Very fun, Peter. Well at least if you're making jokes it means you're probably not as bad off as you could be. Can you move?"
"I said his abilities are similar to Steve's. But Steve was enhanced. Peter's been changed, altered. His transformation can be compared to....-"
"They can if they feel it is best. Or you can offer them something to assure them of your safety, at least more safe than normal." Peter gave his uncle a confused look. "Perhaps you can convince someone to partner with you, so you won't have to fight alone every time."
Kalyca's own grieve, their grieve echoed across their bond towards him. Peter had not the strength nor will to look around for his daemon. His pops' hold was the only thing keeping him from crumbling onto the ground completely, but he just knew somehow that his dad had her.
Tony sat in the kitchen cloaked in darkness, a bottle of whisky in front of him and spider-man's mask in his hands. His phone lay across the room with numerous cracks in the screen from having thrown. Why couldn't they just leave him alone?!
Peter's attempt to prevent spitting out the liquid, had the disastrous effect of it going down the wrong way and he ended up coughing madly, Kalyca crawling onto his lap wanting to help but unable to. Gwen was half out of her seat ready to get help, but Peter waved her back down. "I..I'm.. o-okay." He coughed several more times before his body settled down. He gratefully took the offered napkin from Gwen.
That did make sense, Happy realized. "So why tell me now?" As soon as he said the words, it hit him and Tony had apparently noticed his realisation as well, seemingly getting ready to plead with him. "No. Absolutely not. Children are not in my job description, I would have taken a job in daycare if I wanted that."
He waited a few second and when there was still no answer, he opened the door. He immediately got smacked in the face by a piece of paper. Pulling it away, he observed the room. The window was open and the growing storm outside had entered Peter's room. Bursts of wind had scattered many of Peter's belongings in such a matter it was dangerous to walk around. On the bed, he found the entire contents of the fridge.
Dr. Strange put his hands together, looking far more friendly than before. "Excellent. We'll work on the plan for now, then get a good night's rest. The creature cannot track you here and even if it could, it cannot enter. Tomorrow we'll take it out of the picture."
His torturer crouched down before him, only his eyes visible behind the mask. A clear grey color. Peter had wondered in one of his delusional episodes prodcued by his suffering, why a person with such nice eyes would hurt anyone. The man -for Peter deduced that much from his voice and behaviour- reached out and gently cupped his cheek.
Peter was prevented from answering by none other than his dad finally returning. "Hey kiddo, I'm back. You better not have been slacking in....here." Tony looked surprised at seeing them both in his workshop. "This day just got a lot better. My two favorite people in the same room."
"Peter?!" Sam called on the edge of panic. An aborted sob came from his right and he finally found the kid, sitting on the ground behind the open door, knees drawn up to his chest.
Hydra had gotten hold of an enormous source of power enver before seen and energy readings were indicating an explosion was going to happen and not just any explosion. This would wipe out the entire city if not more and Peter had been the closest to the base.
Very carefully, with the lightest touch, he closed his bedroom door. The sound of the doorbell had Peter stopping in his tracks at the top of the stairs. A wave of anxiety rose up out of nowhere, a feeling as if he were under threat. Trusting in his gut, Peter ducked behind the banister, out of direct sight of the front door. He heard his aunt May move towards the door, her footsteps echoeing loudly as if his hearing had suddenly been dialed up to the extreme.
The spell was broken the moment he saw his aunt go down, fast from the corner of his eye. With a cry of alarm he moved as if to leap of the bed and help her, but his pops held him back before he'd even gotten one foot on the ground. Bruce had lurged forwards and caught her before she could truly hurt herself and held her as to Peter's horror, she burst into tears.
A sound to his right caught his attention and he noticed light under the bathroom door. He carefully manoevred his way to the door before knocking once more. "Peter? You in there?" As expected by now, there was no answer. But as he put his ear to the door, he could make out the sound of running water.
"He's not missing, yet. I think." Tony began awkwardly. "I just haven't located him yet. Friday, can you ping Peter's phone?"
Barely daring, he opened his eyes to find himself standing in a perfect crouch on the bottom highway, right next to the destroyed car and the suit who was not moving.
"I know you worry, I worry, but this is not the way to go about this. We established rules and this wasn't one of them."
Peter came to, slowly. His body felt heavy, uncooperative and just lifting his eyelids felt like an herculean effort, but he managed to scrunch them open a smidge. From what he could make out he was in the backseat of a car with two people in the front -one the driver, the other his partner? or someone to watch Peter. He noticed the windows were tinted darkly.
Indeed the hole they supposedly fallen down was completely invisible, as if something had covered it. It explained the lack of light down here.
"Please answer the question m'am." The voice sounded irritated and that worried Peter. How long could his aunt stand her ground before they took matters into their own hands?! Peter itched to go down there but if he did right now he might complicate things.
Perhaps it was the simple suggestion or just the willingness to be that listening ear, to want to help
"NO!" Tony surged forward, catching his limp son as his foe released him. "Peter? Petey, stay with me. Please kiddo, please don't go. Peter!"
Footsteps form behind alerted him to his pops arriving. His dad would be in his suit below, ready to catch him if the need arose. "Hey Peter, are you ready?" Pops leaned down a little to look him in the eyes and from his reaction, Peter knew he could tell how nervous he was.
Peter thought before moving to follow his clearly distraught dad. "Since when am I just Spider-man to you? You can't be serious about kicking me out?"
"That is debatable." Steve said teasingly causing Peter to snort as he tried to restrain his laughter. Tony grabbed his chest in a mimic of a broken heart before refocusing on his son.
"Like," Tony began as he leaned ever so closer to his son before gently kissing him on the forehead, right before his hairline. "A kiss on the forehead means you're precious to me." Tony then gently held Peter's face as he continued. "A kiss on the nose to make you smile." Before Peter could process his words, Tony quickly pecked his son right on the nose, causing indeed a smile to erupt on his face as tried ot pull away.
This prompt almost didn't make it today, but at the last stretch I managed to get a few short ideas and I went with the angsty one, of course XD
The stranger seemed unperturbed by this act of defiance and it quickly became clear why. With an eery calmness, the man drew a gun and pointed it straight at his uncle Ben. "I'm afraid I have to insist."
"There you are." Steve said walking into the living room and spotting Tony on the sofa, looking happy and a smug. "What was that all about?" He inquired indicating Peter's kiss to the forehead that the kid had given him a minute ago.
He quickly retrieved Peter's "secret" bag from his locker, the one with his webshooters and ran as fast as he could. In the hallway however, he ran into Happy.
Guilt settled heavily in his gut at the mention of his boy. He'd treated him horribly, yelled at him. Yes he'd been angry, and yes Peter had done something incredibly stupid and it had resulted in terrible consequences.... but he wasn't the only one to ever make mistakes. He needed to talk to his son.
"What the-?“ Tony was at a loss for words as he watched Peter fling a god across the room like it were nothing. Even stranger was Peter tugging on his own arm as if to free himself from the wall.
"It's okay, Peter. It's me, it's dad." His dad pulled him into a hug and Peter sagged against him. He was safe now. Unfortunately for Peter, his dad pulled away needing to check him over. "How badly are you hurt? I'm so sorry. I had no idea those idiots would startle this badly."
Peter wasn't sure what to expect when he landed in the teenager's backyard. They stood there staring at each other for a few awkward minutes before Ned, apparently, broke the silence.
With that announcement, Peter was hauled off to his supposed cell and no closer to the answer of this strange world he'd woken up in.
"That would be great." Peter stood up, stuffing the phone back into his bag and swung it over his shoulder. "See you at school Gwen. By Devlin."
Peter hesitated in anwering. He so wanted to tell them the truth, but it would only hurt them more. They may dislike or even hate Spider-Man forever, but the truth of the matter was that neither he nor Peter would return. Nothing would change and he'd only be causing them more grief by revealing himself to be Peter but not
Before anyone could respond, Tony's phone rang. Not in the mood for it now, he had every intention of ignoring the call, but the unknown number gave him pause. Call it parental instinct, but he answered the call instead.
A fairly sized owl stretched its wings on the back of the bench drawing Peter’s attention away from Gwen.
A scream from his other side caught Peter's attention. A woman lay on the ground stuck under some rubble. His spider sense alerted him of a big piece of wall breaking off from the building above her, a split second before it happened. He tossed the explosive he was still holding towards his aunt nat, knowing she was watching him closely, and dive out of the quinjet.
Chapter 1 is General rating, but the entire collection will remain on Teen and Up, as I expect other prompts to potentially go there.
"Yes, I think so because I definitely travelled through it somehow. And I need to find my way back." Before he could indulge his uncle who clearly itched to ask him all kinds of questions, his pops interrupted.
Tony could feel the tears roll down his face but he refused to acknowledge them, pulling out of Clint's hold and turning away. In truth, he hated how he couldn't be there for Steve. Hated how he felt the need to grieve alone. Hated how he lashed out in his grieve at everyone else. He'd chased everyone out and Steve leaving had hurt the most.
Tony laughed merrily before answering. "The kid scraped his knee and wondered what we could do about it, so I said I could kiss it better. Well technically I said I might kiss him and he wasn't keen on the idea, believing kisses to just be between you and me."
"No! No, it can't be. Peter! Peter wake up!" Tony dropped beside the bed, shaking his barely alive son, watching the life slip out of him.
Peter had seen his uncles and aunts do some crazy things, but he was not prepared for this and neither was Ned as he stood with his mouth agape wathcing the scene. Four of his uncles were seated before the television -Uncle Scott, uncle Clint, Uncle Rhodes and Uncle Happy, each holding a familiar controller with the new mario party game playing on the screen.
"Hey dad, can you look at this for... oh." It wasn't his dad. Staring back at him was none other than Captain America himself, more recently knows as his dad's future husband.
Peter slowly put up his hands in surrender, feeling completely off balance with his own dad threatening him. "Like I always do, through the window."
Peter craned his head backwards to look at him and Bruce could see in the teens' eyes the moment he realised what he was looking at, or rather what
But despite all that, to suddenly have him become more than just uncle Steve like all the other avengers had easily becomes his aunts and uncles, it was strange to say the least. Not unwelcome, especially seeing how happy his dad was with Steve. It was just a bit of a struggle fitting the pieces together now that the puzzle had changed.
I was convinced I was going to fail this day as I couldn't figure out what to write. Then I got an idea and still felt unsure of how to write it, but when I tried to make a start on it, it suddenly took on a life of its own and voila, I made it!
Peter is about 4 or 5 in this one. Obviously my headcanon adjusted for Tony and Steve to be together earlier and to have Peter from a very young age together.
Tony felt his eyes water at that and was glad to find Steve was just as easily moved, when Peter did the same to him later that evening when he returned home.
They had no idea, Peter thought as he silently worked on his project while listening to the conversation around him. Mr. Stark was his usual dramatic self, but Peter would never say this out loud. He was just an intern. He couldn't just say whatever he wanted after all. Dr. Banner of course was more lenient, but Peter looked up far too much to the man to be unpolite to him.
"Yes, there does seem to be some residual traces of it left in your blood. Though the rate at which it is disappearing is astounding."
"No I haven't seen him." Bruce asnwered. "I asked Friday to inform you and Peter and she reported back that you would tell Peter."
but there were plenty he'd never seen before. Obviously there was Norman Osborn, better known as the Green Goblin. Otto Octavius had captured him, Venom skulked about as did Electro and Vulture. He'd even seen Mysterio off to the side.
"Sorry, I don't plan these things, you know." He gave a wry smile that evoked a grin from his dad. Though uncomfortable, the strain on his connection to Kalyca was better than the alternative. Their bond was in tact. He looked up, barely able to make her out looking down at him. His dad followed his gaze, horror overtaking his.
Peter couldn't shake the feeling she perhaps already knew who Jack was. He wouldn't put it past her.
was in this big battle and he won, but a lot of people had gotten trapped in the area. He managed to rescue them all, but he'd gotten hurt bad. Before he called his family for help, he changed back into his civilian clothes since he wasn't ready for them to know just yet. But Peter didn't make it and they blamed Spider-Man for it. From their point of view, Spider-Man managed to save everyone, several dozens of people, but he couldn't manage to save Peter."
"Yes sir, I'm very sorry. I know this loss is hard to take, but it is only part of the reason I am here."
Tony stopped them in the middle of the hallway and turned to face Happy with his serious business face. "Listen, this is very important to me and I don't trust just anyone with this. I know you didn't ask for this, but I was hoping you'd be willing to help me out."
Explaining the reason for being so late would come later. For now, Peter had no strength or consciousness left to tell them about sneaking into Oscorp or make up an excuse so he
Steve had likely already reached Peter's room by now but before Tony could find out he stopped dead in his tracks because of what he suddenly heard. Screaming. Terrible screaming coming from Peter's room, from Peter himself. It sounded like he was being murdered and didn't that bring to mind all kinds of horrifying images. Basil suddenly screeched in distress as he flattened himself to the ground. Daemons rarely screeched like that as it sounded unnatural and pointed out how deeply terrified and vulnerable they were at that moment. Tony reached down to comfort his daemon, confused as to why Basil would shows such behaviour when normally it was only used in the most extreme of situations, usually when a daemon was dying itself or its human. Before Tony could touch Basil a similar screech tore through the hallway and it wasn't coming from Basil.
"Not as such, no. It's a strange specimen as far as I can tell. I could sense a little of it as it followed you, but not enough. It seems capable of some telepathic contact, though it was directed at you."
When Peter came to, he was no longer inside the bunker. The first thing he saw was a blue sky and some trees. Carefully getting up, he noticed he was on the outskirts of the city. The city, which was still standing and appeared undamaged from what he could make out from this far away.
"Hey pops," Peter said as he took a seat at the kitchen isle where his pops was chopping vegetables presumably for tonights dinner.
"Why are you such a morning daemon when I’m clearly not a morning person?" It was a rethorical question, one that Kalyca answered with an eye-roll before cleaning her fur as she waited for Peter to finish.
Peter was so caught up in his work he almost missed the heavy footfalls from behind him. Expecting his dad back, he already turned around to ask his opinion on the fix he'd used on the thruster for the boot.
"Alright, here's what we'll do. I'm going to Peter and you are getting in my car," He quickly handed the keys to Ned. "Use the phone system to call Friday and have her alert Tony, Steve, everyone. And do not touch anything else!"
"I'm sorry. I can't tell you. Please stay safe." The call was ended by Peter without warning or a proper goodbye. Just like that, he was gone.
Both men shared a look before trying to answer at the same time. "It's not as bad as you think." "We lost him."
"I think you've got us confused with your own family. We don't hurt unless we have to, not even our enemies. But I was hoping you were no longer one."
Peter was so thrown by the woman's reaction, he didn't react fast enough to his spider sense and got thrown across the street. As he struggled to get up, he saw Otto Octavius standing above him, his metal arms hovering menacingly behind the man. Off to the side, Peter glimpsed the green goblin helping the woman he'd just saved. She did not fight him or scream at him. In fact she seemed quite trusting.
"What do you suggest?" Peter could only barely make out the non-drivers' face and from the look that crossed his face, he was taken aback by his partners' suggestion. "You can't be serious! You want me to dose him a second time?!"
"I'm willing to compromise and this seems the best way to do it. Will you let me be spider-man this way?"
Tony never regretted to this day changing his mind that night. Adopting Peter was the best thing he ever did. And now, his little boy was gone.
"No, Peter. Stay out of this." Kalyca ducked her head as Sioka waggled up beside her, flapping his wings in his distress for the situation. Uncle Ben must be very worried if Sioka was acting so agitated.
Raakel settled down, her temper slipping away like smoke on a breeze. She bubbed her head against Bruce’s in a comforting gesture.
"Frankly... I have no idea. On the one hand is a scarily, brilliant engineer who could build anything to either destroy me or torture me. On the other is a supersoldier who could crush me with his bare hands. I'd rather not find out who to fear more."
Peter was about to say yes, when he hesistated. The fight had been fairly recent and there was bound to be nothing new aobut his pops just yet. Best to wait for a while. "No, that's okay. I'll call in the morning."
"Yes, I'm aware. Your point?" Peter answered crisply, already getting ready to potentially fight his supersoldier uncle on this.
Peter's spider-sense was not fast enough to alert him to the rest of the iron man suit arriving and promptly throwing him through the window. He'd barely managed to web to the nearest building to slow his descend enough to tuck and roll and not break everything upon hitting the ground.
"Thank you Friday." He returned distractedly, his eyes never leaving the poor vision of his hurt boy. It was clear from some of the wounds that Peter had been tortured. Tortured! Who would torture a child?! It mad eihm sick to his stomach just thinking about it.
"Peter!" Steve nearly fell off the bed in his haste to get closer to the phone. Tony stepped closer before he could further hurt himself and put it on speaker.
"What other choice do we have! If the rumours are right, we cannot handle him awake. And if he is capable of waking up this soon, he can probably take it."
"So you need me to sign a permission slip. That's hardly cause for you to be so nervous about. You know your dad and me value your education."
It was a low blow, Tony knew, but what little control still remained over his emotional state was quickly unravelling. It felt like someone stabbed him in the heart when Peter pulled away from him, the glistening in the corner of his eye betraying his hurt. But his words were harsh and laced with growing anger as he verbally struck back at Tony.
Peter fiddled with one of his tools as he tried to find a way to explain. "You're not wrong. Something has changed, but it's not bad." He quickly added at the devastated look on Steve's face. "I really like spending time with you and I see how happy dad is with you. And it's stupid that just because you're putting a lable on it, that it suddenly makes a difference, but..."
He looked up at the tower, his home, stunned and betrayed. What the hell had happened while he was on patrol! Had his dad taken leave of his sense?! And where had everyone else gone? Peter was determined to get answers and decided to call his pops. But when he unlocked his phone, he found a single message waiting for him, from a number he did not recognise but his phone apparently did as it was registered under the name, Ned.
Bruce put a comforting hand on his shoulder, prompting Peter to look at him. "I know, Peter. You do good work and most of the time you do it easily and without injury. But it's day like these where we all wonder if we did right by letting you continue. You are still just a teenager."
There was no answer nor any noises that could indicate his son being awake. Normally Tony would not intrude on his son's space, but with the kid not knowing yet if his pops was going to make it, Tony figured now was the exception to that rule. So after taking a deep breath he opened the door....
"Peter!" Bruce moved to try and catch him before he got hurt, but to his surprise Peter landed without trouble on his feet next to the bed. Bruce put a hand to his chest in relieve as he tried to settle his heart rate. "Peter, are you alright?"
"Still alive, dad?" He called teasingly from the living room. He turned around at the footsteps heading into the room., his dad looking both parts furious and devastated.
As soon as Peter was gone, Steve sent Tony a smug look. "Yes, I admit it, you were right." He answered the look, before making his way to his workshop to work on his son's suit.
It was quiet for a while before Scott spoke up, a laugh bubbling beneath the words. "You really are the son of two avengers."
Instead, Peter pulled back and sat up straight, tilting his head sideways in a strangely intimidating gesture. His eyes narrowed ever so slightly and his mouth shaped into a sneer. But it was his voice that sent shivers down Tony's back. Low, but closer to a whisper and a clear tone of hostility.
"Aww, does that mean you didn't?!" His dad turned and pointed accusingly at his pops. "I blame you for this. You coddle him too much. Seventeen years old and he can't even kill anyone on a routine run."
Peter hesitated for only a moment before stopping. "You could....I mean....Can you stay?" Peter felt his face heat up in embarassment, but his need to not be alone was greater. Besides it wasn't like they'd never hung out before, yet somehow now it felt strange to ask him to. "You don't have to. You're probably busy and this is boring anyway. Sorry."
Several seemed okay with it, even without ever knowing who he really was. Tony only really payed attention when Steve asked him for his opinion. He thought about for a while, but eventually decided he liked the new guy.
Peter accidentally knocked against his mug as he got caught up in his arguement with Kalyca. He barely managed to keep it steady, only spilling a little bit on the table. "Sorry", he mumbled as he attempted to cover it with a napkin. Gwen was watching him but it was Devlin's stare that unnerved him. It was like the owl was studying him, maybe even judging him? Gwen caught him looking at Devlin and was quick to shush Devlin who turned to stare out the window as if nothing had happened.
"Tony, hey, look at me." Steve released his arm and both hands grabbed hold of his face and refused to let go even as Tony tried to wiggle free. "It's just the flu or something. JARVIS would pick up on anything life threatening. Peter is going to be fine."
Peter nodded fervently and scooped Kalyca up in his arms beneath the blanket. Tony helped him out of the car after Basil jumped down, and led him towards his home.
"Tony, no, that's going too far." Steve said pointing at the live camera feed. "You're invading his privacy."
Worry nagged at Steve, despite being safe in the tower, their home. However, he didn’t want to leave Tony alone either. Natasha seemed ot notice his plight and stood up when an unexpected distraction showed up in the form of Peter stumbling into the room.
Seeing her reminded Peter of Kalyca, or rather Kalyca's absence. The panic and desperation returned full force and he found himself running again before deciding to do so.
He almost careened straight into his uncle Bruce in his haste to get into the lab. "Peter?! Are you alright?"
Peter scoffed at the offer. "Oh come off your high horse. We all know you're going to torture me if I don't answer. Just get it over with."
Tony quickly stepped back into his suit before reaching for his son. "Give him to me, Steve. I'll get him out of here. You help the others get home." Steve nodded his consent as he glanced with clear fear in his eyes at his still unresponsive child.
"What?! No of course not. Pepper has been helping me get a handle on suddenly raising a child. She also looks after him from time to time whenever I'm away for business."
As if saying it out loud suddenly made it hit home, Tony started breathing heavily and his heart began pounding in his chest.
"Alright," he heard his uncle draw the word out as if not quite certain he believed Peter. "Just stay close to me. I do not want to explain to your dads how I lost you because I didn't notice you passing out on me."
Peter flexed his hands trying to deduce his situation. Strong, plastic wire held fast to his struggling, though Peter had a feeling he could break them if he really wanted to, considering what had happened yesterday with the avengers.
Gravity grabbed hold fast and powerful, and for a moment Peter panicked. But his pops pulled him up with him, holding him steady until his own wings found the wind current and he found himself no longer falling but instead floating.
Peter noticed movement below and saw Kalyca unconscious on the floor of the car. Unfortunately for PEter his movements had gained unwanted attention from the dog daemons he could now hear behind him, from the trunk. The non-driver turned around, obviously alerted by his daemon and started at the sight of Peter being awake, as if he had not been expecting it.
Bruce stopped him when he tried to leave the lab again, his grip on his arm firm but not painful. Always in control of the Hulk. "What is going on, Peter?"
Tony was not panicking. Tony Stark did not panic. However, Tony the dad of one Peter Parker would absolutely panic when his son who had recently be clinically dead for a minute and was still recovering from whatever science experiment he got caught up in, had up and left the safety of the tower without alerting anyone and he didn't even bring his phone!
!" Tony turned back around ro face the live feed, needing a moment to gather himself. He felt hands on his shoulders as Steve leaned his head on top of his own.
The soft voice was no doubt that of Kalyca. Everyone watched confused as Peter reached out to Raakel, but rather than touch Raakel -whihc Peter would never do normally- he stopped just inches before her. The avengers slowly came closer to see what was going on and then they saw it. A small, purple colored spider slowly crawled off Raakel's head and onto Peter's hand. He gasped upon contact and tears sprung into his eyes, despite his confusion.
Steve looked alarmed and tried to sit up. "Whoa there, stay put. You're in no condition to get up just yet."
Peter ignored the heated argument from Kalyca buzzing through his mind. No matter how deep a hole he was digging himself in, he had to ask. He felt so elated around Gwen, he wanted to know why she did what she did. If perhaps there was more to it than her simply being kind. As he looked at Gwen he completely missed Kalyca rolling her eyes beside him. She already knew what Peter was feeling, even if he didn't know it yet. It wasn't that she didn't share it, she liked Gwen and Devlin, but she feared how far Peter would go to chase that feeling. One of them had to be cautious with their situation.
"Tony." The response was sleepy as Steve had only just woken up. Momentarily distracted by seeing his husband awake, Tony missed the lack of his teenage son in the room, at first.
They stumbled through the dark for what felt like hours, Scott never letting go of Peter's arm. They both joked about it but Peter's dads truly were terrifying if something happened to him. He was content to let his uncle keep a firm hold if it saved him from the wrath of the two other avengers. Beside, Peter felt rather uneasy in the dark, the narrow tunnel, the idea of being surrounded by ground on all sides....he'd rather not get separated.
"Sorry uncle Bruce. In a rush." He sprinted past him, not caring how his behaviour must be setting off all kinds of alarm bells. In the back of his mind, he could recognise the beginnings of a panic attack, his fear for Gwen derailing his entire mind.
Sounds of heavy fighting echoed through the corridor as the Avengers lived up their name and stormed the hidden base where Peter had been taken. The security of the place consisted mostly of automated turrets and even some amateur -in Tony's opinion- robotics. But neither Tony nor Steve paid any mind to the defences other than to dodge or destroy them in their rush to get through the base.
Oh and I'm borrowing Ned again from the MCU universe. I just really like Peter to have a best/nerd friend XD
"Come on, Peter. Let's get you up." Steve urged as he gently coaxed his son off the chair and ina standing position. Peter's entire weight sagged into his pops' side, but Steve held him up around the waist. "Peter? Can you hear me?"
Russian phrases/words translation jsut requires to mouse-over them. Keep in mind I got the translation from a google translator so they might be wrong.
Sam slammed the fridge door closed a bit too hard as he turned on the two. "And you didn't think to check on him?!"
While the four grown men argued over the supposed win, Peter turned to Ned as the frozen state of his friend was starting to worry him a bit. "You alright, Ned?"
Peter sighed as he frustration rose. "What kind of question is that? I saved her because it was the right thing to do. I saved her because it's what I do. I don't know what the hell happened since last night, but everything it turned upside down and nothing makes sense anymore! Saving her was the most normal thing that happened today!"
Heavy on the dialogue, a bit of an experiment on my part. Apologies if it is confusing and unpleasant to read. This prompt was difficult to think up something for and this was the easiest way I could manage it. I didn't want to skip another day.
The fox's ears drooped a little at the minor chastise before flipping upright again. One of Peter's hands removed itself from the blanket and petted her gently and lovingly.
"We're used to scent of burning metal oil and whatever else you do in that workshop." Steve joked. Tony tossed his husband a look that promised revenge, before taking a seat next to his still troubled looking son.
"I'm afraid for him too." He spoke softly. "I want to follow him around or keep him home, but all that will accomplish is Peter pulling away from us. How are we going to keep him safe, if he doesn't trust us to help him? We came up with a set of rules together, all
"Dr. Strange?! I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to run into you." Peter looked sheepishly at him. Strange was staring at him, an almost confused or curious expression overtaking him. "Uhm, something wrong?" Peter cautiously asked.
?" Peter snapped, shifting on the chair in a futile effort to get more comfortable or at least less uncomfortable.
Clint stood up, now curious enough to join the discussion. "The only one who's been in the tower besides us would be, Peter. He came home about an hour ago."
all characters will probably act way out of character and some things have been exaggerated for fun and to suit the prompt. Just so you know why something might feel weird.
"No, please don't! What do you want with Peter?!" Aunt May was shaking, her fear practically palpable to Peter. It screamed at him
"What are you doing in my home!?" Peter shook with every syllable, completely bewildered by the violence and anger his dad was aiming at him. He'd never ignited such irk from his either of his parents. Despite his reputation, Tony was not a violent man, especially not with his family.
-like. All three looked up at the source hopefully. A wave of relieve rushed through Steve at the sight of his little boy in the arms of Bruce, giggling like mad at the plush his uncle was keeping just out of his reach.
Taking advantage of this new development -after all he could freak out about his supposed super-hearing later, Peter turned his attention to his aunt and whomever was on the other side of the door.
His anger gave him the strength he needed and he pushed back causing the suit to stumble. He'd overestimated his strength though when he felt them freefalling off the highway bridge thorugh the gap in the guardrail. "PETER!"
Finally Tony gave in, how could he not. Steve had that affect on him, damn his very fine husband. "I know...I know, I just hate to see the kid suffer. He's suffered enough already in his life. "Tony placed his hands on Steve's for a moment before gently prying them off and continuing his task of getting ready for bed. "I hate being useless."
Tony barely heard the estimated time of arrival for Banner, his attention on Peter who had gone from scremaing to whimpering and wailing, still struggling against Steve's hold on him. Fearing the worst, he turned around to see how Kalyca was doing. His blood ran cold at the sight.
"Is that right?" Gwen smiled as she took a sip of her coffee, the awkward silence momentarily broken by a relieved one on Peters' end. Trying to quench his own nerves further, he took a sip of his own coffee only to nearly spit it out at Gwen's next question. "So why did you sneak into Oscorp?"
"Friday never kept me out." Peter nearly bit his tongue when his dad actually charged the blaster, readying it to fire,
Peter buried himself in his jacket to combat the chill in the air. It was unseasonably cold today but he hadn't been in the right headspace when he'd stormed out of his home. He wasn't normally so easy to rile up but everything was different and kind of terrifying at the moment. Not a time when he could handle being verbally attacked by his own dad.
"Perhaps it has something to do with the idea that I would become a parental figure in your life, rather than just another uncle in your strange family." eter stopped pacing, turning to face Steve. "Listen Peter, I would never do anything to make you uncomfortable or to get between you and Tony. We've actually discussed the issue and I agreed to co-custody only if you were on board with it. You're Tony's kid and if you want it to be just like that, it will stay that way."
Peter looked around as a feeling of familiarity came over him. Had he been here before?He edged himself around the nearest corner, ignoring his uncle's shout of "Hey wait for me!", as he slipped and struggled to get out of the water. When he caught up he seemed to deflate at the sight before him.
Tony was up and beside his son even before Steve had managed to move. He gently turned his head to him, shaking his shoulders ever so slightly, hoping for a response.
Tony had never been a patient man, but now even less. Peter was on lockdown in medical after having d-, after ceasing to be alive, and not even Tony
Raakel hissed threateningly, hair on her back standing up. Basil moved to block her, snarling in response.
Steve felt himself get weak in the knees, but thankfully Scott and Clint noticed and set him down on the nearest available space. "We'll find him, I promise you." Scott tried to reassure him.
Peter straightened and made for the stairs just as his uncle's voice also joined the mix downstairs, Sioka quaking loudly at his side.
It exploded upon hitting the side of a building, causing in instability that made the top half tilt dangerously. Peter watched in horror as the building collapsed against its neighbouring one. Glass and pieces of structure rained down on the streets below. People screamed as they tried to outrun the debris. Familiar metal arms, belonging to none other than Otto Octavius, grabbed the runners and pulled them to safety.
Though it seemed as if Peter would like a physical opponent if his fierce punches were anything to go by. Peter looked like a mess with his hair stuck to his forehead and his clothes plastered to his skin. How long had he been in here?
Peter felt Kalyca curl against him and he held her close with one arm as he crawled forward on the backseat towards the door not curled around the guardrail of the highway. When he reached the door, he pushed with all his might and within seconds felt the door's resistance fall away. He tumbled out of the vehicle, still clutching Kalyca close.
"I believe it can possibly influence or even control someone, but you seem unusually resistant to it. We could have a chance with such an advantage."
Peter would gladly stay like this for a while but his memory choose that moment to surface. "Uncle Ben!" Tony held him before Peter could run off in a tizzy.
"Sorry about that. Dev can get a bit intense sometimes. I hope he didn't upset you?" She pointedly looked at the napkin on the table now covering up the spill.
"Not smart enough to bring his damn phone apparently!" Basil hissed agitatedly from the kitchen counter as Tony paced in front of it.
The peace and quiet was broken when Peter broke off the faucet, staring at it in horror while the water shot free of the plumbing. "Peter!" Peter turned defensively to Kalyca, "I didn’t mean to do it!" before blindly grabbing several towels and plugging up the broken faucet.
Ned and Peter looked equally shocked at that revelation, but Peter had no doubt Friday was telling the truth. Not only did it make sense with all the inconsistencies, but he knew his dad had isntalled all kinds of extra's into his latest AI, especially after meeting Stephen Strange and his strange world of magic. It made sense that Friday could detect alternate universes, if they existed, which she just proved.
Peter sighed. He knew why. That damn bag he found at his aunt and uncle's house. A photo of his father and one dr. Connors. He'd just wanted to know something more, anything more about Richard Parker. Even though he had a great life, two fantastic dads and a true family in the avengers, not to mention a wonderful aunt and uncle... and yet his birth parents' deaths still bothered him. There was just something about it. Maybe it was nothing, just his traumatised child mind trying to process it all through nightmares and dreams. But a part of him wondered if some of those dreams weren't made-up. What if they were memories?!
No, he didn't. Especially not after he got his pops hurt, He would not let that happen to anyone else if he could prevent it.
Ned nodded before taking off, but he stopped after only a few steps and turned around to push Peter's bag into Happy's hands. "Peter is going to need those."
And promptly found it lacking another person. It was fairly early, but it wans't too unusual for Peter to be up already, especially with their family in such distress. Had the kid even slept at all? Tony checked the bathroom, then the kitchen, the living room....he was nowhere to be found.
"Thank you, sir." Despite knowing it was rude to just up and leave in a rush, Peter could not delay any further as his skin practically crawled with the need to
"I suppose we try and find a different way out. I'm not receiving any communications, so either everyone stopped talking at this exact moment, which I highly doubt, or we are cut off."
Tony stood as still as a statue while it was going on, completely unaware of Steve approaching him until he felt the hand on his arm gently but firmly turning him around. Tony refused to look at him though, not wanting the gentle reassurances he was sure were coming. He'd much rather stew in his anxiety, thank you very much.
Steve was out the door in a heartbeat, Tony rapidly following him although there was no feasable chance of him keeping up with the supersoldier. "Alert Banner!" Tony ordered JARVIS as he ran.
"Killing someone isn't always the best way to instill fear. Besides, if you kill too often people get used to it and harden against it." Neither man seemed to notice the shocked expression on their son, even when his pops turned to him. "You did
His dad seemed to deflate with relief at the news, and although Peter felt relieved himself that he would be alright, his mind was on his aunt and especially his uncle. "How's uncle Ben? Is there any news?!" He turned to face his dad as his anxiety rose the more he thought about his uncle. "You said your medical team got to him, right?! How bad is he?!"
The morning brought good news and finally calmed down the frenzied wave of emotions, Tony had been struggling with the day before. Steve had made it through the night and would make a full recovery, fairly soon due to being a supersoldier. He would still need to take it easy for a time, but at least things were finally looking up.
"What did you do?!" His dad all but growled at him, but his next words were even more confusing as his voice broke as if in grief. "It's what you didn't do." Peter made as if to reach out, to comfort his dad but his next words effectively shut him down. "Get out, Spider-Man. You're not welcome here."
"No, Peter. I'm talking now." Steve stared both of them down until they sat down and listened. "Both of you are wrong and both of you are right. Peter you are a minor and our son. You can't stop us form being protective of you or worry about you and Tony, you can't abuse your power as a engineer and parent nor can you go behind Peter's back. We're a family, can we please work this out as one?"
The whisper broke the spell Tony seemed to be under. Having control over his limbs again, Tony kneeled down so as not to tower over the little boy. Basil took this as an invitation and jumped into the kid's lap. With the way the boy was bundled up in the blanket, there was no risk of him touching Basil. Still, the kid tensed for a moment at Basil's action.
"Alright Bruce, what do you know?" Tony asked as he walked into the lab followed by the rest of the team. Bruce turned around in his chair, hands together as he tried how best to explain.
"Wait, you're letting me come?!" Peter was hardly ever taken along on avenger missions as they were too dangerous for a minor they kept saying. Only when the need was dire, like last night, did he get to come and even then he would need to beg.
"Peter, wait!" The familiar voice had Peter turning around to face Bruce despite the urge to move, to get away. Something was wrong! "It's alright, Peter. I know things are very confusing right now, but I can help you." Peter wanted to believe him, he really did. Bruce was familiar, safe, someone he trusted. Bruce would make it all better, he always did. Peter moved ever so slightly forward when Bruce suddenly looked alarmed and shouted. "Stop, don't-!"
"Yes, this I can work with." Peter hugged his dad before getting up to leave. "Hey now, where are you going? I wasn't kidding about your injuries."
"I think something is wrong with me." He whispered brokenly. Sam silently agreed before grabbing a towel and wrapping up the soaked teenager.
"I can't come back," Peter answered sounding solemn. "I just called to asks about pops and to tell you something." The three men shared worried looks as they waited for Peter to continue. "Don't follow me and don't look for me."
A sharp pinch broke his frozen state but before he could realize what was happening or why his aunt May suddenly shouted and reached for him, he passed out.
Though I'm sorry for this utter sadness that is to come. My mind just really likes angsty and sad stuff.
Peter was suspicious as the timing was almost too perfect but he was also curious. He opened the chat window and found a single hello waiting for him. Nothing more. He decided to take the bait and sent a message back.
Taking the attack as much needed fuel for his own anger, Tony threw his glass against the wall. "Do not give me that crap. Why can't you assholes just leave me alone!"
Both father and son jumped when the car Peter crawled out of slipped over the edge of the highway bridge. Before Tony could intervene it crashed onto the lower highway sending cars veering out of the way. Distracted by this Peter barely noticed the flair of warning and on reflex pushed his dad aside. Tony went flying a good distance before landing with a thump but Peter could spare him no thought when a strong arm wound around his neck cutting off his air. Peter struggled to get a proper foothold to force him off, but the man was relentless. A dog barked nearby, probably the suits' daemon. He felt stinging pain that he immediately knew was not from him. That daemon had hurt Kalyca!
Daijee sat on her lap, his entire form screaming sorrow as his wings hung beside his little body. With shaking hands aunt May hugged her daemon close to her chest while Bruce and Raakel stayed beside them.
"Enough! I heard enough." Both Scott and Clint shut up immediately, eyes cast down and looking all manner of guilty. This was answer enough for Steve, though he still asked. "
"I'll go check on him. You okay for a bit?" Peter nodded. "Yeah, just don't stay away too long, okay?" He may be a teenager on the cusp of adulthood and far braver than he thought he'd ever could be, but right now he felt vulnerable and wanted his dads near.
"Peter's under attack!" Happy's alarmed exclamation was drowned by Ned spewing out even more information against his intentions. "Something came through the window and grabbed him!"
Peter tried to make it to the door, tried to get out because the air was suddenly too heavy to breath and he didn't want to be here listening to their lies. A hand grabbed hold of his arm and he non to gently pulled his arm free before backing away from his dad. He held up his hands in a placating manner as he spoke to him. "Peter, please kiddo. Calm down, breath."
All eyes turned to Peter who seemed only to get more distraught, pulling at his own hair to try and alleviate his turmoil. "I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to. Why is this happening?!”
"I swear." Just then a phone buzzed in his bag, taking Peter by surprise. He had left his phone at the tower so that his dad couldn't track him. He was pretty sure he hand't tagged him with anything, lately. Kalyca eagerly dover into his bag recovering his now once more silent phone. It was an old one, faded blue and chipped on almost every side. It was his back-up phone for uncle Ben. When he'd found out Peter left his phone behind sometimes to stop his dad from tracking him, he'd talked to Peter about it. He trusted Peter but worried about what might happen if he had no way to contact anyone. So they had come up with this idea, a phone only they knew about so that if ever Peter needed help he could call uncle Ben.
"I'm not sure, yet. I do know it's loose in the city, because Hydra lost control of it. I do have my own eyes and ears in the city." He added at Peter's incredulous look at the information he possessed. "The incident that injured the Captain, I believe it was this creature Hydra threatened the non-human avengers with."
Peter felt his dad's hand tighten on his shoulder ever so slightly. "That's all very fascinating Bruce, but I'd like to know if my son will be alright."
Thus he sprinted and occassionally swung his way through the giant spaceship that Quill had "recovered" on one of his recent jobs. Not that he checked for infestations, unfortunately. All he could do now was survive and outrun whilst his family found a way to help him.
Before Tony could indignantly retaliate, Steve had already moved out of reach. Pretending to be offended, only slightly pretending, Tony got in bed beside his husband, Basil making himself comfortable on a pillow beside the bed, Qatara stretching out on her own on Steve's side.
Not very proud of this one, but it’s the only thing I could manage with this prompt and one hour left to midnight XD
“Tony,.." Steve watched helplessly as Tony refused to meet his eyes. The water and food in front of him went untouched. Basil sat under Tony's chair curled in on himself. Not even Qatara's whines could get a reaction out of him.
"Who are the adults here, Steve? If I feel the need to up my security measures then my underaged son doesn't get a say."
Inside the social worker's car sat a young boy, barely visible through the window, curled in a big blanket. Tony couldn't explain why, but he was drawn to the child. He walked towards the car, opened the door and stared at the solemn boy, who's confused big eyes looked up at him. Silence reigned between them for a while, neither knowing what to say. The kid was probably terrifed, Tony realised. He was nothing but a stranger to the boy and here he was staring at him, not saying a word.
Peter couldn't resist a chuckle at that. "Why are you even trying to make dinner in the first place? Did you lose a bet or something?"
What a journey this has been. It's been an absolute blast, even during the moments where I freaked about the midnight deadlines and difficult prompts, but we made it. Hooray! Thank you to everyone taking part, reading, writing and just plain enjoying this challenge and of course thank you to the organiser. This gave me hope that I can write if I just keep trying :)
That just made Gwen laugh even more and soon enough Peter joined in, her laughter even more contagious than her smile. Kalyca jumped up on the bench watching happily, sharing a knowing look with Devlin.
If this was some plan to kidnap him or take him down, it was beyond ludicrous. But, the kid on the phone sounded genuinely griefstricken. Besides, he was known for getting out of tight spots. Lord knows he had plenty of enemies already.
It took a few seconds, but with a few aborted flickers, the lights in the tower came on momentarily blinding Peter. He felt someone grab him quite roughly before he opened his eyes and was shocked to find his own dad was manhandling him.
"Ka...kalycc..ca?" he called haltingly. He held his head as if that would lessen the pain ricocheting through it and blindly felt around for his daemon.
"Pops?" Peter's voice sounded choked through the phone, as if he was trying hard not to tear up. "You're awake?"
"Come one, let's get you cleaned up and then we'll figure this out." Peter allowed himself to be herded out of his room and toward the common area where his appearance was certain to give two avengers the shock of their lives. Sam could not deny after this whole mess was dealth with, that the shock on their faces was a joy to witness.
Also, in my headcanon the first avenger's film happened two years before TASM and during TASM the avengers were away on a big mission and Peter had been staying with Ben and May.
"In here, child." Strange called out to him, having already moved to an adjacent room to the entrance chamber they had arrived in. Peter grumbled under his breath about the child comment, but followed the man regardless.
"Of course not. But maybe he knows who did. Although, I'm not sure if we should bother him." Rhodey nodded his agreement.
"Medical emergency! Mr. Parker is having trouble breathing, is in severe pain and his heart rate is reaching dangerous levels."
Tony sighed at the damn logic his husband provided, but before he could give in, a pained cry pulled their attention to their webswinging son. Peter had been hit by something and wasn't moving!
"Enough!" Steve interrupted the shouting match, pushing both parties away form each other. "I heard enough."
Tony felt his throat constrict as strange emotions surged upwards inside him. He hadn't thought of Richard Parker since they parted ways, so many years ago, but it seemed Richard had not forgotten about him. He'd even told his son about him.
His spider sense suddenly alerted him to danger behind him, giving him just enough time to dodge under the punch. He stumbled back, not having expected to be under attack in his own home. "Friday! Lights!"
to go. No one was getting hurt on his watch. He was the friendly neighbourhood spider-man after all.
Tony struggled to hold a tight reign on his emotions as his husband fell apart before his eyes. Luckily he was distracted by movement in the corner of his eye. Raakel was slowly stalking into the room, as if she were afraid to enter. Upon seeing her, a rage overcame Tony and he turned around and grabbed Banner by the front of his shirt and slammed him into the wall.
Tony grumbled before leaving the discussion for his workshop. If spider-man was going to join them, he should start working on some prototypes for the guy.
"I've got the papers right here. To be clear. Once you sign this, you will relinquish all rights to Peter Parker. Do you understand?"
There! Light! He burst into the room, eyes darting about to try and locate the errant scientist before he could set off the 'bomb'. Looking up, he saw the man up on a catwalk holding a big wire in his hand while the energy source pulsed in front of him, floating in a circular orb. The black waves coming off it were not comforting.
"Oh no, not at all. That was just me being...well me." He looked down at Kalyca as he said the last part, but she just turned away while humming distractedly over the bond. "I can get distracted easily and my hands don't always catch up with my brain."
Ned knew Happy meant nothing by it. All of Peter's family members were overly protective, even concerning Peter's best friend. But in his current predicament, the not-quite-a-threat was enough to double his panic and his brain decided to latch on to it and caused him to blurt out the wrong thing to say.
The elevator doors opened, alerting Tony to an unwanted visitor. He didn't bother to look or even get up. If anyone was foolish enough to bother him, on their head be it.
Steve's gaze was clear and honest, there was no lie there. He truly was giving it his all and yet Peter was giving him a hard time. Scrawny, unathletic Peter was giving Captain freakin' America a hard time?!
"About that, " Steve began carefully. "I know things have changed rather suddenly, maybe and I want you to know you can tell me anything. Even if it's about me and your father being together. I can't help but feel like something drastically changed with us, the moment we announced our engagement."
"You don't know everything and I can't tell you, but please believe me when I say you've got the wrong idea and the wrong person."
"Probably not." Peter answered looking over his shoulder to make sure his uncle was keeping up. At the expression on the avenger's face, he decided to elaborate. "I tracked down a rogue scientist who had mutated himselb by accident into a giant lizard. He had his hideout down here."
"Why...a-are...y-you...doing....thi-this?" He could barely get the words out and part of him wondered why he even bothered to ask. But he was out of options and fast approaching his limit. He couldn't guess at the hours or days he had been here.
The man simply turned to face him and before Peter could notcie, stretched his hand out to attach the eletric wire to the sphere. He smiled as the sparks shot everywhere. "Hail Hydra!"
Basil curled in on himself, clearly showing how devastated Tony was feeling about that. Peter was his world and now he choose not to come home, if only for one night. Steve approached Tony calmly, feeling the same sadness but also understanding how Peter might feel, how overwhelmed the teenager was. He would come back, just not tonight.
Apparently it was the wrong thing to say as his dad pulled out his palm blaster from the iron man suit, and aimed it right at Peter. "How did you get in here?!"
Tony slapped a hand over his mouth. "Pipe down, will you." He said in a hushed voice before taking away his hand and he actually smiled at Happy. "And no, I didn't kidnap anyone. That was my son, whom I've adopted a few years ago when his parents died. I never told anyone about this beyond a select few because I didn't want that kind of attention anywhere near the kid."
"I wanna try." He bravely told his pops, though he still remain hunched over in his unease at the idea.
Tony jumped up and ran the rest of the way, grinding to a halt in the open doorway taking in the terrible chaos inside.
"Listen to me, Peter." The serious tone of his voice gave Peter pause. "This is obviously a trap. He choose the time and place, he took someone you love- "
"Really, Stark" Came the accusing voice of Clint as he no doubt observed the disastrous surroundings.
The elevator came to a gentle stop at the right floor, the doors opening to reveal none other than his dads. Peter sighed internally, not feeling up to this but having no coice in the matter. He pushed off from the wall with more effort than was considered normal and immediately the stern faces morphed into concern and previosuly crossed arms reached forward as if to steady him. Peter usually dodged such attempts but his world shifted sideways dangerously, so he allowed them to steady him and almost literally pull him out of the elevator, his bag dragging behind him as he lacked the strength to lift it up.
Steve looked up,a almost sad look in his eyes. "You get like this often, feeling like you need someone around?"
Finally Friday located Peter's signature, leading them into a dead-end hallway leading up to a single room. Steve wrenched it open forcefully, not even bothering to hold back his strength. Tony flew passed him entering the room, weapons ready, but imemdiately putting them away and nearly tripping over his own feet in his hurry to get out fo the suit.
This takes place right after Peter was bitten by the spider in TASM and thus is changing as he did in the movie.
This prompt truly ran away from me. It was planned ot be even longer, but I lost a bit of steam near the end and decided to cut it a little shorter. This event is after all, not to tire out my inspiration but give it fuel.
"Peter Parker, excellent." the man clapped his hands together with false cheerfulness, his gaze predatory as it fixed on Peters'. It sent all kinds of warnings through his head.
His pops leaned forward, forcing Peter to look at him. "Peter, what goes on with either company is unrelated to you. There should be no problem with you going on this fieldtrip. You are just another student there to learn something."
"He's been drinking too ,though not as much as you. Most of the time he's just hitting things until his hands bleed. Scott is staying with him for now, to keep a watch over him."
"How can I possibly be cold when you keep me warm?" He hugged Peter back tightly, feeling so immensely grateful for this adorable child in his life.
"This creature has put its intent on you, I believe because of your mutation. From what my sources could gather, the creature needs a host to become stronger. With Hydra's threat, I believe it can only do so with specific people."
Peter stared with his mouth open at the boy as he spwed every question at him in quick succession. "What are you talking about?! I have never met you in my life. Who do you think I am?!"
I honestly couldn't come up with much, so sorry for the super tiny drabble, but the whole point of this event is to write something even if it's not much. Hope you'll all still enjoyed it.
"Yes?" Peter abruptly got up and started pacing, his nervous energy not allowing him to stay still. "And no. I can't really explain it. I just don't know how to act around you now and I don't know why."
What have I done?! This is the most horrible thing I ever wrote I think. I had the beginning planned earlier today, but when I sat down to write it the cruel twist crept into my mind and since it is halloween and the final day of the challenge, I figured it was a suitable way to end this XD
Peter winced when Bruce extracted another piece of shrapnel from his back. His patrol tonight had taken an unexpected turn and not in Peter's favor. He looked miserably at the closed door beyond which his dads were most probably arguing the whole spider-man shindig.
The slight hitch in his uncle voice snapped Peter back to the moment. Knowing how quickly his uncle could panic when children got hurt, even almost adults like himself, urge him to answer. "Yeah, yeah I'm here. I'm okay, I think." Lifting his head off the ground test that exact theory, Peter was relieved to find the movement did not cause any excessive pain.
"Yes Natasha, similar but not quite the same either. Unless I know what exactly happened, there is little I can deduce from the data I have. There are superhuman traces, as proven by his strength and speed, but there is something else that I can't identify unless I have more information."
"Tony, it's going to be alright. This is not because of you, Peter is probably just a little overwhelmed."
Peter turned to his uncle and noticed the numerous collection of shrapnell already pulled from his body. Perhaps everyone's reaction wasn't exaggerated. He had shown up covered in blood and swaying where he stood. Bruce gave him a knowing look.
Before Tony could digest the words, Peter lashed out and drove a thin object into his neck. Shock overtook him as Tony dropped to the ground, his entire body shaking as he desperately pried the foreign object out of his body. His blood was everywhere and spreading rapidly and standing above him, actually smirking at him, was Peter.
"Yes." Peter froze not expecting the answer. Unfortunately Friday was not done yet. "You flatlined several times in the Tower's medical facility until you eventually did not recover. I was very sad and still am. I miss you Peter."
The silence reigned on long enough that it bordered on awkward, even if neither man was aware of him listening, unless they did know and were ignoring it? Either way, Peter felt the need to escape and he chose to act right on time, when his spider sense reacted to something much farther away.
"Good, cause it looks like we've got work to do." Peter swung away then, right into the group of newly arrived criminals.
it!" Peter exclaimed, getting a raised eyebrow for his efforts. "I just felt a strange feeling, like someone was watching me or in this case following me. Guess I was right."
Iron Man was fast. Peter would know as he'd seen him in action and he worked on the suit enough alongside his dad. He also knew no matter how fast he was, the distance was too short to catch up. The suit had released Peter when they fell, desperate to save himself.
Steve smiled at him reassuringly. "It's alright. Thank you for telling me. I'm very happy that you aren't against my becoming your parent. Perhaps, I can offer a "label"as you put it." Peter looked hopefully at his future father, wanting the closeness they used to share to be back already. "I'm from a different time and back in my days we named things very different. Perhaps, if you like, you could call me Pops?"
Cautiously, Peter stepped out of the bathroom only to be intercepted by his dad who handed him a mask.
It was as if a bucket of ice-cold water just emptied over him. His senses sharpened and suddenly the room didn't sound quite as muted as before. His aunt's sobs had quieted some but still rang painfully in the room. His own laboured breathing finally reached his ears as did the slow rumble of a distressed Qatara as she stood just off to his side with her tail and ears down.
This prompt gave me hell, but I finally thought of something that could work and it was painful to write because I don't want my boys to be at odds.
Tony backed away from Bruce, dodging Steve's reaching hands all the while taking a breath becoming more of chore. Peter was dead. His son was dead. And the last thing he heard from him, was his boy begging for someone to help him, to make the pain stop. Tony's legs gave way and he crashed to the floor in a heap. He didn't have the energy to push Steve away as he held him.
Peter never heard the answer because at that moment something slammed into the side of the car sending them careening towards the left crash barrier and ramming them into it violently. It was over in seconds, but left Peter with a pounding head, ringing in his ears, and a constant tingling from his new danger sense.
The young boy tilted his head as he watched Basil, a tiny smile appearing before vanishing just as quickly.
was allowed to see him. His own son! He’d been ready to tear into Bruce if it weren’t for Steve. His husband was his complete opposite; calm, patient, level headed and ordered. Steve was the reason he was sitting here in the kitchenette, his back to his avenger family seated on the sofa and chairs. They had dropped in one after the other when the news of Peters’ situation had spread throughout the team.
"All of you stop, you're only making it worse. Get back!" Bruce tried to keep control of the room but it was getting cinreasingly harder to do with everyone confused and frightened. Having the Hulk roar in the back of his mind about threats and anger was not helping. It was costing most of his attention and energy to keep him at bay and form the look of Raakel shaking beside him, he was losing that battle.
