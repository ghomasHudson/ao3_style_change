"Well surely your mistress is already missing you," he said spitefully. "Beds do get cold quickly."
"Why?" Sherlock questioned, although he knew.
Perhaps...no matter what John had meant, perhaps it would be better to have it happen tonight. Tonight was just as good as any other night. Even if he aggravated John with his inability to properly submit to his role, at least he could please him in the bedroom. Others had kept him around for a little longer for that despite his many faults. John would, too.
"Hen party or a stag do then. Any similar party. You could make up to hundred quid a night."
"Ah," was all Holmes said with a curt nod. "Excuse me, master. The dinner."
Sherlock kowtowed when she let go. "I'm terribly sorry. Forgive me, ma'am," he spoke to his potential buyer. His voice didn't waver despite his shock. Rather, he felt as if his heart had stopped altogether. "I didn't know I was for sale. I hope you will still have me."
John didn't pretend he knew much about playing instruments. He'd only played clarinet unsuccessfully for a while in his youth. But even so, Holmes seemed skilful. He had tried calling several places by now during his lunch breaks, but alas hadn't found anyone interested in renting a violinist. Two places he'd reached out to actually remembered Holmes, and had nothing but good things to say. Holmes wasn't a musical genius, but very good nevertheless. It was a good sign, but didn't help John. He needed money now. He didn't regret moving, but doing so and getting a slave had come with unexpected expenses. Perhaps there could be something else he could rent his slave for.
"You can use the bathroom after me. Cereals work fine this time", he said smugly.
John glanced at the black car behind him, not quite sure of what to think of it. "Right…"
The floodlights blinded him and when he'd turned to look away, he'd seen the someone swim away alone to the open sea while the others tried to cling onto the boat. Lifebuoys had been thrown to them, and one by one each slave who accepted the buoys had been pulled to safety. Back to captivity.
trying to escape!" Holmes equally raised his voice at him.
It was laughable. Why would he fight? Why would he resist? He had no right to and the more agreeable he was the sooner it would be over. If only he could like it...
Sherlock came to a sudden halt. He didn't know where he was. All the streets lined with parked cars looked the same. He could see his breath against the yellow street lights as the cold began to settle in.
Mycroft pushed the thoughts aside with a heavy sigh. "But you know why I'm doing it."
“Uh, no, I meant like a proper name. Anything you prefer?”
Hope could claim it to be chess all he wanted. A mind game, a way to determine which of them was superior.
The photos were a clear game changer. By the next day the advert had produced twenty-six emails. Majority John trashed immediately. Couldn't people read? It was clearly written he wasn't renting Holmes for sex. He replied to fourteen messages and got two replies. Soon he had Holmes booked for a birthday group for the Friday night.
"According to his own words, no." Holmes had been reluctant to talk about it or any of his previous escape attempts. Who knew how many there had been in reality? He was willing to bet there had been more than the recorded ones with police involvement.
"Amongst other things. I happened to be in the area and mistress has no further use for me right now."
"Good luck, John," Holmes obediently wished. "While you're gone, can I go out?"
"Yes, master." Holmes rose and bowed. "Thank you, master."
"You've acquired him quite recently, haven't you?" the woman continued, putting away the mobile. "99OR-79/3J3A."
"Thought I wouldn't notice?" John muttered. Was he testing John? Was it some sort of a power struggle? He hadn't forgotten the staring contest in the cab. Holmes was definitely no ordinary slave, but two could play the game and he'd be damned if he was going to lose to a slave. Holmes would need to learn his place and John
"For what?"
"What do you want?" Sherlock growled. He shut the door with far more force than necessary before following Mycroft further in to the flat. His brother didn't flinch at the noise the door made. It irritated Sherlock to no end. Sudden noises, not necessarily even loud ones, still made him flinch from time to time.
"Shame."
Holmes gave him a confused look. "No, I made sure he would never get out of prison alive."
The cabbie looked anything but convinced. Typical free citizen. As soon as it came out he was a slave, he was instantly worth less than a dog, no matter what they had thought of him before finding out about his status.
"Oh, you don't have to, I can eat from the–" John cut off his sentence in the middle. The slave looked at him over his shoulder, through the window in the wall between the kitchenette and the living space, already reaching for the cupboard.
Holmes didn't turn to look at him and his eyes never left the screen. "Brilliant deduction, John."
“Then get off the bus, please, and wait for the next bus that accepts slaves.”
Then again, the life of a slave was rarely a happy one —and Sherlock was only beginning to understand how true that statement was.
"It isn't easy for me, either, you know that," his brother sighed. They were both highly proud individuals, and despite spending good twenty years in slavery, it still took Mycroft effort to swallow his pride, bow his head and submit. With Anthea, or rather, Andrea, but only select few were privy to her real name and he himself only ever addressed her as his mistress. With her it was routine, something he didn't spend too much time thinking about, but the people he worked with and met every day... Had he been free, he could have easily been their superior. Now everything he said had to go through Andrea to be taken seriously unless it were the people who worked with him on a daily basis.
"I am a slave and legal property of my master. My entire being belongs to my master, whom I love and fear and respect, for he is my world and his wish is my command. I was born to serve and I strive to please."
Being a slave in America was far more dangerous than being a slave in Britain or Europe in general. With such loose laws for both slave keeping and guns, a slave shot to death wasn't an unusual crime. Depending on the state it wasn't even a crime to kill a slave. In Florida it had been illegal to kill a house slave, but not a worker slave owned by a business.
It didn't sound like mercy to Sherlock, but perhaps it was kinder than the alternative of being donated for medical research. He died only little after a week. Killed himself with household chemicals. It wasn't the suicide that bothered Sherlock the most, but how the free people seemed annoyed that he had dared to end his life while he would've still been useful to them. The sheer injustice of it all filled him with resigned anger, sorrow and fear.
Why were his thoughts even going down this trail? He glanced at the slave from the corner of his eye, but the man was facing the window. John concentrated on the advertisements at the back of the front seats in silence, letting their exchange play through his head again. Everything the slave said was true and it seemed logical now that it was explained, but he couldn’t see how anyone could notice all that and put it together like this. Except...
An emotion John had no time to name passed the slave eyes, but it was gone as quickly as it appeared, replaced by hard, intense stare. The slave tilted his head. "Of course not."
"You didn't say I couldn't", the slave countered, still not looking at him.
"Always dashing about", Mrs Hudson sighed, but sounded amused more than anything. "My husband was just the same."
"We're looking for a sniper," Sherlock smirked. For a new pair of gloves he could show off a little.
Sherlock already knew this. John, however, felt slightly uneasy.
"It's John", John reminded. "I didn't notice."
"No, I didn't. No one did. Everybody knew, but no one wanted to make a scene of it. It was easier to just get a new slave. InS should know we were all involved with a slave's death, but no one was blamed for it."
More shocked gasps followed. Lestrade was openly staring at him, wide-eyed, gulping when Holmes still refused to comply. Sergeant Donovan next to him had paled and covered her mouth with her hand. Anderson's face was a mixture of loath and outrage.
"We used to play in her cupboard. It was like a cave. Harry locked me in couple of times," he told with a grimace. "I don't know how you slaves do it, I was terrified. Mum and Dad were always really angry 'cause people shouldn't play in slave cupboards."
," he quoted cheerlessly.
"You have", John marveled, "
None of the words the slave forced out of his mouth sounded sincere, but at least he had said them.
"Because it was funny!"
John shrugged and handed his empty mug for Holmes to wash. "Seems alright to me. You could learn a few things from him. He seems much more well behaved."
"What about before that?" John wanted to know. Based on some of the stories he'd heard, he was impressed that a slave like Holmes had survived on the other side of the Atlantic.
He felt relieved, lying on the floor, but somehow inadequate as well. Sickeningly so. It was a feeling that belonged to the slave side of him, the part of him he wished to have nothing to do with. If Dr Watson didn't want to sleep with him, it was a
"Everyone's so stupid —even you."
"Certainly. Holmes, you heard Mrs Spedding."
"Just let me,
The slave shrugged. "He prefers it to Myc –or Fatty."
"Arrogant, really? Recently enslaved then?" Mike wanted to know.
"Of course he is."
"And when will that be?" Sherlock spoke silently, eyes lingering at his master's back who'd taken several steps into the living room.
"Hang on a second", John exclaimed, still having absolutely no idea of what their exchange had been about. The woman met his eyes briefly and handed the phone back to her slave.
He swung himself to the top bunk in an urgent need to just
His owner snorted. "I'm yet to see any of those."
What interested him far more was Moriarty. Who or what was it? Why had they taken such interest towards him? Fan of Sherlock Holmes based purely on the website he could understand, but Moriarty knew he was a slave. How long had Moriarty known of him? Was it a coincidence that Mycroft and Moriarty had found out about him being in London at the same time? He didn't believe in coincidences.
"We're not hugging," Sherlock said instantly, folding his arms and scowling at Mycroft whose eyes were devouring him for information. His brother's expression turned cold.
"Most kind," Holmes agreed, but his remark went unacknowledged.
It was the slave’s turn to look shocked. “Really..?”
Holmes steepled his fingers and tilted his head as he looked at John. "So not something you saw or could have prevented. You've personally done it."
John shook his head in response. "No, I didn't. They paid more than double."
"Of course." He wouldn't mind at all if he could play somewhere. If John got money out of it, that was just a bonus.
"Because I know what he is."
John frowned at Holmes, who was still lounging on the bed, eyes closed and fingertips pressed to his chin. He was surprised –no, he was
"Something's wrong," John muttered. "That's not supposed to happen."
The man smiled at him. ”Aren't you all, sir?”
"Three times," Holmes insisted this time as well. "I've learnt my lesson. I won't try again. But I still wouldn't sign a contract."
The realisation began to seep in even before Mrs Spedding got up and spoke: "And he's still untouched?"
Sherlock's hand trembled as he pretended to examine the potentially deadly capsule between his gloved fingers. Jeff Hope watched him, his own pill already almost on his lips.
"I was talking to Sergeant Donovan earlier," John spoke. "She's mostly explained what happened."
Two identical buildings formed the Roland-Kerr Further Education College he'd arrived to. Both were mostly dark at this hour. Was Holmes inside? Or somewhere out in the yard between them? The GPS signal wasn't reliable enough for him know for sure.
He gulped, pulling his arms around himself protectively. He shook his head. "No."
Deep in his thoughts, hand in his pocket touching the card yet again, he didn't notice the black car until it drove past him and pulled to the kerb. It wasn't the same car as yesterday, but it might as well have been. Like the previous one, the windows were tinted and if one was powerful enough to control the CCTV, they might as well have two or more black vehicles.
"I don't know. I don't really care at the moment." He stood up, just in time to see Holmes stick something on his arm. This time he didn't even bother asking. He wrenched the man up violently by seizing his arm.
"I'm 99OR-79/3J3A," Holmes slowly began with the individual part of the so called "oath". The words came out in a forced monotone, spoken between gritted teeth. There were many versions of the oath, but despite small differences, they were all essentially the same.
"No," Holmes denied immediately, clutching his violin case. His voice was hoarse and strained. "I don't know
he could do, other than to try to convince someone a cabbie had just stolen his slave. He'd need to call the police, he needed to find out who was driving the taxi. And he needed paper to write down the cab number before he could make that call.
"Well it's your big mouth that's going to make Doctor Watson have you changed for another slave once he's had enough of your bad behaviour and attitude. Sherlock, I'm
"An interested party", she smirked. The car stopped and the locks unlocked. John gathered his cane and shopping bag.
"Go to your mistress," he spoke quietly to Billy. "I'll deal with this."
John paced the kitchen. "Whichever of your owners fucked you up like this should be disciplined themselves," he cursed under his breath as the slave's eyes followed his every movement. As if he could not fathom that the master's ire could be directed at anyone else but at his slave. "How can you even
"Your PIN?" Holmes let out an unimpressed huff. "I've seen you type it several times by now."
"Please, mistress. Whatever she's paying. I'll work hard to earn the same and more."
"How is your new master?" he inquired instead.
"Holmes..!" Lestrade cried, not buying into his act of worry over his master.
For the past three years he had learnt to embrace it. He had obeyed and served, and he had learnt his place. He had been happy. It had been such a relief, such a heavy burden off his shoulders, to
The slave accepted his order and did not say another word on the subject, although it clearly irritated him immensely. The mood stuck on Holmes for the rest of the night and later things escalated even worse.
"No, out of question", Holmes said firmly.
"I need to see what's inside."
A shiver ran through his body, but it had nothing to do with how he felt about the situation. He was fine with being shown like this as long as he kept his mind occupied with something else. The floor was cool and felt cold against his skin. He was cold, he could feel the hair rise on his arms in response to the sensation. Sherlock rested his forehead against the linoleum and closed his eyes in an attempt to relax. The two free people in the room kept talking as if he wasn’t even there. How he
"Oh my god, my baby! Please, oh god, my baby, my baby my babymybabymybabymybaby!"
The man didn't seem to get the sarcasm. "Don't look like one, do I? A funny little man, driving a cab. But it's perfect, actually. No one ever thinks anything of you, you're just a back of a head."
"A friend?"
But until then, Sherlock was all alone in the world.
Sherlock walked as gracefully as he could with his wobbly legs and pulled a seat closer to the windows. He collapsed on the chair and slumped against the table. Jeff Hope sat down opposite to him. He smirked, but Sherlock could only hear it in his voice with his cheek against the surface, eyes closed.
John huffed at the thought. He was the master and Holmes would need to remember his place. Surely the man couldn’t be as difficult as the Ms Bruce the handler had seemed to suggest. He’d been a slave since he was a child. He must have had adjusted to his role in the society by now.
"Where's the ambulance? He needs help!"
He pointed the umbrella at John. "And you of course, master Watson, should you want to be involved. He is your property, after all. All I am asking is that you let me meet him."
It was by far the most awkward car ride ever for Mycroft and the most miserable one for Sherlock. Father was stoic and silent, mostly, and let their mother yell at him. It took a lot of prompting from her to get him say anything, but when he finally did, the fight only escalated. Later, Sherlock would remember the absolute disgust and loath dripping from her tongue. "You repel me," she'd said.
"You have no job. My employer can arrange you one anywhere you'd like", she told. Her tone reminded him of a school teacher.
Holmes growled frustratedly. "Did you actually have something you wanted to say or were you interrupting me just because you can?"
"Uh, yeah. Please."
"Joh– Master," Holmes tried. John banged his fist against the wall.
"Mainly that," John admitted. In his younger days he'd been to parties with rented slaves. Usually the slaves were made to wear revealing fancy dresses and were treated as kind of a group mascot. They were ordered to sing and dance, losers of games might have needed to do something to them and it had always been funny to try to get the slave say something bad about its owner. And there was always that one jerk who tried to sleep with the slave, even if the rental agreement forbade it.
. I am not joking. I am
“Here it is, Mr Watson”, she announced unnecessarily, tugging the slave’s sleeve. He yanked his arm away from her, undid the sash and shrugged the robe off his shoulders, letting it fall around his feet.
"Give him some water first."
"Him?"
"Does your master know?"
"Not really. I'm just curious about you."
"No, I was handed to a new owner. He's why I'm calling. No, no, I'm fine. He's been very good to me. Listen, are you still looking for that tenant? My new master is in dire need of accommodation."
“But this is InS!” John exclaimed. Of course there would be people wanting to come and go with slaves!
Just a familiar nightmare, he told himself, but it did nothing to silence the voice in his head that still cried desperately for her child.
"Oh, alright. Is she any good?"
Sherlock accepted his words with a nod. Truth to be told, he had been worried. One needn't be a genius to figure out why the man had trouble sleeping. And he was surprised, given that he'd been with the man for over a week now that John hadn't yet ordered him into his bed. Sherlock had after all heard him in the shower twice quite clearly. Sex, Sherlock assumed, was something a man like John would have to soothe his nerves. He was a soldier and it was no secret that military bases were equipped with slaves whose sole purpose was to cater to the soldiers' sexual needs and offer them comfort. But perhaps tonight was not the night John required such services after all.
"How long did you stay with them, then?"
A family slave picked them up from the hospital early in the morning. All the four slaves they had did their best to help Mycroft with funeral arrangements, but Mycroft had no time to grieve. A far bigger problem presented itself. They were left orphaned with no close relatives or family friends to step in to take care of them. While their slaves would have been more than capable of taking care of them, they were slaves and thus not eligible. He considered freeing one of them for the sole purpose of getting a guardian, but as it turned out a minor could not free a slave. Nor could an ex-slave become the legal guardian to his master, since it was the master’s responsibility to help his former slave to begin a new life.
"How... How did you even get back in? You don't have the key. And
"Tell me what's missing."
"John," he managed to call, but it went unheard as the door closed and shut him in. The last coherent though he had before the lost his consciousness was that the car was moving and
"I didn't lie, I just didn't point out I am a slave," Holmes replied as if it should've been clear. "And if they assumed I'm not...well, it's not really my problem, is it?"
Sherlock could have named a number of talented musicians with fan following who were owned by their producers or agents, but instead he fixed his gaze on the bottle closer to the cabbie.
"I'm alright," Sherlock murmured. "He drugged me, but it's not the poison."
"You just told me to fuck off!"
She was always so kind after she had had Hunny punish him.
Oh, low blow. That was low. Sherlock's fingers curled around the armrests.
Last chapter seemed to stir a lot of feelings. I did think it might, but I was surprised by the amount of really well-thought and intelligent comments I got. Thank you very much. It’s a joy to read your comments and get to talk with you guys. I’m a little overwhelmed, but very, very happy for the interest and varying opinions. I hope you'll enjoy this chapter.
Sherlock never meant to make his parents fight. He just wanted to impress them. Mycroft seemed to know half the people present, so he just wanted to show them that he, too, could point out people from the crowd. What he did not quite understand was why they all fell so silent when he pointed out the young cellist, who clearly was good friends with Daddy. Mycroft clearly had known of her, too. Sherlock just had wanted to be the first one to say it.
Wearing a collar would at least have people immediately recognise him as a slave.
"InS sold me to Florida", he explained, but before he could say anything more, John caught up.
"You don't need anything I don't tell you need," John reminded. "Argue with me and I'll hit you again. And then a couple of times more, because I completely missed what the previous thing was about," he said, pointing at the television. "Go warm the bed or something."
"Were they these "normal people" you mentioned?"
“Well, we can’t remove it from you or anything. The first three years are a trial period of a kind.”
It came out far more bitter than he had intended. He lay down and pulled the blanket over his shoulders, facing the wall. "If you don't need me, I'd like to rest. Goodnight, John."
Holmes seemed to think nothing of it. He bowed his head a little further before standing up straight.
"Right... Well, pretend for a while I'm considering this. Where is this place you're talking about?"
He couldn't conceal his smirk nor the smugness of his voice. "How did you get them take the poison?"
"Turn to your left. There's a camera at the top of the building across the street. Can you see it?"
“Prime condition, as you can see”, she hurried to say, hastily making the man turn around a full circle. “Just turned thirty-three, excellent health despite it’s been two years in America”, she read from her tablet.
The map of Britain loaded with a blue dot on London. John tried to zoom in, but the free service only let him know that Holmes was somewhere in the area. It wouldn't zoom close enough for him to be able to pinpoint an exact street. He checked back the three days the service allowed, but the only time the dot significantly moved was when Holmes had been given to John and they'd left the InS holding centre. But it
help him.
Holmes's expression darkened. "When you got me, and I asked you "Afghanistan or Iraq", you were surprised."
"What about the ones before that? Did they let you out, let you see your brother?"
fresh air!"
The third slap made his eyes water.
"This is no instrument for a child," she'd said. "You will play it when you're older. I will put it away until you're worthy of it."
"Yes, mistress. Quite done for now."
Street away from home and there it was again. The sound of a ringing phone. It didn't stop even though he walked past it.
"He'll be put down when he can't work anymore if the masters have mercy."
John looked at his plate and impaled a carrot with his fork before looking back at Holmes. "I assume you know what the file says."
"You keep staring at me. Clearly there's something."
"I'm not in mood for prolonged suspense," Sherlock murmured at the table. While he might have liked dragging things himself to impress others, he didn't appreciate the same being done to him.
escape attempts?"
"No", he snapped, perhaps a little too quickly. "I didn't get to choose."
"What about the message on the floor? Anderson reckons she's German."
John glanced at the floor by the fireplace. All Holmes's possessions seemed to still be there except for the coat. But maybe the violin wasn't important in the least. Maybe he didn't even enjoy playing it.
"Warned by whom?" he asked as coolly as he could, but in reality it made his blood run cold to hear someone aside from the select few to call him by his birth name. The name was on his website, but there were no photos. The cabbie shouldn't have been able to recognise him. The only advantage he seemed to currently have was that the man did not appear to know he was a slave. He pulled the coat sleeve further down to protect the stigma on his wrist.
Holmes stared at him mouth half opened. John couldn't tell if he was shocked or outraged, but after a second it seemed to click in his head that he was still in fact a slave and that John was his master. He peeled off the nicotine patches reluctantly.
"I know. But later," he clarified. It was futile, he knew, but he didn't have much. Technically,
"Don't you have a slave to carry that for you?" a female voice asked him as he scrambled himself and his bag into the car.
"I met a friend today", he told, not entirely sure why. He supposed it was just nice to have someone to talk to. He was reminded of Ella writing down "friend" and fought the urge to grimace. He wasn't thinking Holmes as a friend. Absolutely not. Plenty of people talked to their slaves, he reasoned, though a small voice insisted only lonely and old people actually considered their slaves conversation material. He was reminded of an old man who lived on the other side of the street when he and Harry were kids. He often sat in his tiny front garden or walked painfully slowly to the news agency at the end of the street. His slave always followed him, listening to the same stories over and over again, always laughing at his jokes, always responding to them with interest and enthusiasm, regardless of having heard them hundreds of times already.
"Whatever you choose
"Let me know if he goes too far."
"Oh, but you're gonna love this!" Hope exclaimed. "Come on, Mr Holmes. Cheer up! Play the game."
Holmes shrugged and continued his task. "You could still rent me full time. Did you get enough of me already?"
suicides."
Mummy and Daddy had never fought like that. It was New Year's Eve, and for now the other people around them preparing to welcome the new year were still oblivious to the prelude of a tragedy midst them. A New Year's party wasn't a place for a child. Sherlock had been dreadfully bored despite the host's slave trying to keep him and other children company. Mycroft, being so much older and smarter, followed around their parents.
(See the end of the chapter for
"How did they die?" John asked as he sat down. Not demandingly. Just curiously.
." The man sounded delighted. "Yes, exactly. Driving cabs doesn't make you rich. But every time I kill...money goes for my kids and the more I kill the more they'll get. Don't want them ending up like..."
"Obedient," the guest pointed out over her teacup.
"Oh... Oh! Yes, clever!"
"He's your–? I mean, you're–you're brothers?" John blinked at the sight. He couldn't see much familial resemblance.
"Capoeira?" he questioned coolly. It was a martial art, disguised as a dance of some kind. Created by slaves somewhere in southern America, but the nuisance had since spread across the pond. Any slave practicing any form of martial art without a proper licence to do so could face an instant death sentence.
"No. I think I'll just watch the news and head for the bed," he said. He got up to move to the sitting room. "Take something if you're hungry."
Several jaws dropped and it was suddenly so quiet one could have heard a needle drop in the stunned silence followed by Holmes's outburst. John clenched his teeth in a mixture of humiliation and anger. His left hand, curled in a tight fist, was shaking. His right hand gripped the cane, knuckles gone white. He wasn't a man easily enraged, but it wasn't everyday he was humiliated like this in front of a dozen police officials. No slave should ever speak like that to his owner, and absolutely not in front of other people. Even the people he hadn't been introduced to had heard Holmes and were staring. Several slaves looked at them with such alarmed expressions one would've assumed they were expecting to be beaten themselves.
The fact that he didn't know terrified him the most.
? I don't have any."
He probably would go that far without a word of protest if his mistress wanted it. Mycroft took his position far more seriously than Sherlock did. He ranked highest among the four slaves his mistress owned. Being a head slave and in his mistress's favour gave him actual privileges, like more freedom to move around as he wanted. Not that he did. Mycroft was not only a head slave and a bed slave, he was also a slave to his habits. He rarely did anything outside his routines unless ordered to. And he had the advantage of being able to almost always send another slave in his stead.
"Her phone, of course!" Holmes cried. "Where is it?"
And while Sherlock hated to make it obvious he was a slave, it did make shopping faster. He couldn't have hidden his status at a supermarket even if he had wanted to. The cursed chip in his arm alerted the cashier to check if he was allowed to even have money on his person, so he rolled his shoulder and let the cashier scan his arm before the shoppings.
"I'm going to meet someone."
"Yes, sir. Mistress told me to ask you to see who it is."
"I don't think he meant for you to keep it."
"Er, sorry, have you seen my slave?"
"My hobbies are none of your business."
"And you'd do well to remember that," John said, lifting up the slave's chin. "Is that understood?"
"Anything else?"
“So what does it mean, then?”
Six weeks went by, and talking to her confirmed everything he already knew. Mrs Hudson was stuck in an unhappy marriage with an abusive, unfaithful man. Mr Hudson was unpredictable and often violent. At this point he didn't even bother trying to hide his younger lovers from her. Or the true nature of his work. She knew too much to get away. Her husband's company, while perfectly legal and reasonably profitable, was a mere cover for the cartel working behind the scenes. Marijuana, mostly, but also weapons and slaves.
Mike was too shocked for a second to start apologising and John cut him off when he did, but agreed to the offered coffee. Ten minutes later they sat down on the bench, sipping their take-aways.
John sat up hastily on his bed, pushing the covers away. "Billy..?"
weren't one of them."
To InS it presented a strange dilemma. Many slaves legally owned small things, but usually nothing to this scale. Whatever the instrument's true value was, it belonged to Sherlock now and would not add up to his future owner's wealth. It could affect a little to the price Sherlock would be sold at, but ultimately it had become worthless. Technically it could be worth enough for Sherlock to buy his freedom some day, but as a slave, he would be unable to sell it. Or rather, he could sell it, but he could not own money. If he were to sell it, he would have to trust the good will of his owner. Many would just take an advantage of the situation, keep the money and keep the slave, for legally it didn't bind the owner to do a thing.
It had been perhaps the worst day in his life thus far. To hear that the slave had died and he had been part of it. For the first time it had fully hit him that slaves were actually living human beings. And he had just killed one.
"So your..." John prompted.
"But that's enough chatter." The cabbie straightened on his seat. His tone was more commanding than it had been at any point so far. Voice of a free man talking to a slave. "Choose."
He'd done it! He'd escaped! Now he'd just find Mycroft and together they'd–
"I don't go see him," Holmes replied. "He's the one who keeps pestering me."
"Well, yes, that was brilliant, but it's–"
"Don't need it with you, though, do I?"
"They're going to put him down, Sherlock."
"Yes, of course. Absolutely." Lydia clapped her hands. "Holmes, undress."
"They're going to put him down."
"After they chase us off the station, yes." The park slave he knew would let them somewhere to get shelter from the rain.
"What happened?" John asked. His voice was strained and everything of Sherlock that was a slave urged him to slump further down, be very small and so, so very obedient and submissive.
"People tend not to like me."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Fine, keep your secret," John gave up, rolling his eyes. "Like you said, that ID is your true name now."
Please be aware that there are spoilers for the later chapters in the comments of this chapter.
"Precisely."
Sherlock thought of mistress Summers. He had been as agreeable and obedient as it was possible for him to be. Fat load of good that had done to him.
He was caught of course. He didn't even make it over the garden fence and his unsuccessful escape attempt was reported to their mistress. Lydia Marlowe didn't seem surprised, but that did not mean she did not have him punished.
"He answers to
"Go to sleep," John said softly, pushing lightly at his back. Sherlock rolled off the bed and came to his knees on the floor.
John slapped him across the face. "And it's my legal right to demand
, he needed to remind himself. Words he'd recited hundreds of times during his childhood, words fabricated to make the slaves obedient. Just a bunch of lines he'd been made to remember by heart in hopes that one day he would say them genuinely. Made to repeat until he'd believe them.
"Natural then", Holmes said with another nod. "I should perhaps mention that my previous mistress preferred me clean, so it's-" He swallowed and his eyes darted elsewhere for a second. "Well, you saw me. It'll grow back."
"No one takes my property and gets away with it," John replied. His mouth was a firm line for a second until he continued: "I got here before the police did. I was about to search the other building when I heard the shot and... I thought I was too late."
"No."
"What were you even doing with it?"
"Well you know what I think of that", she stated, but let them pass.
Three days later from that, he was finally able to approach her for the second time. Head bowed and eyes cast down he thanked her for saving him from the keepers wrath. She was happy to see him, and invited him to walk with her, but Sherlock had to decline. He wanted nothing more than to take an advantage of her charitable offer, but he couldn't. He had duties to perform, and even if he had her invitation, he still would have to get his load of work done by the end of his shift.
"It's alright," Sherlock murmured, peering his eyes open, still tense and expecting more pain.
"Not because any of my owners would've rented me for it, but yes. Quick and easy."
"You're not the judge of that", John grunted.
"That's what they all say." The cabbie looked amused. "Let's talk. Take a seat," he advised.
"Take a look. Tell me what you see."
angry. "Why do you have to be so difficult? I just told you to make a cup of coffee, not run an errand to the other side of the city."
Holmes nodded as silent agreement. "Do you still want that tea?" he asked much more amiably.
"I guess I'll take a look at your file then", he said, mainly for the sake of saying something.
John sighed, but nevertheless lifted a paperback book and couple of clothes to see what Holmes might have been talking about. From the sound of it, Holmes was rustling papers.
weak and if the man realised he was a slave his situation would only worsen.
"It's not that, master Watson. My mistress is all right," the boy explained. "There's someone at the door."
it wasn't his fault. With any other owner, Sherlock would have insisted none of this was his fault. With any other owner, he would have expected to have been blamed anyway.
John hummed. "We'll buy some then. Can't have you staying idle all day."
Sherlock heard her walk away, and when she turned off the kitchen lights nothing but blackness surrounded him. Panicking he tried pushing the door, but it didn't budge. He froze when creaking sounds came from above him. He scrambled blindly on the floor, feeling the blanket on it. He crawled until he found a pillow —and hit his head against something. He felt the wooden edge with his hands, running his fingers up along it until they hit the ceiling. He flattened his palm against it, then slid his hand along the ceiling until it came to an abrupt end. Stairs, he realised. He was feeling the underside of the stairs. The noises had been Hunny climbing upstairs.
John wasn't sure what to say. He still needed to discipline Holmes, he'd said he would. When it became clear that he wasn't going to say anything, Holmes held out his hand and tugged at his trousers, looking up at him pleadingly.
The man seized his left arm, knocking over the bottle he'd slid to Sherlock's side of the table and pulled the coat sleeve up to reveal the wrist and the codes tattooed on it. "What's this?"
Tomorrow.
"I'm not sure I'd sign any kind of a contract at all, either", John muttered.
"Out."
"I know it won't," Holmes cut him. "You'll know when to stop."
He'd rushed to the door, heart leaping, full of hope. He hardly even recognised the young man standing by the road. He'd lost so much weight that despite Sherlock growing himself, it seemed as if Mycroft had got taller as well. Maybe he had. Sherlock had rushed across the small yard, only to come to a sudden halt as he registered the collar around Mycroft's neck. His heart sank, shattering all the giddy happiness and hope. Mycroft wasn't there to free him.
was the largest and most popular publication in Britain aimed for slave owners. InS funded most of it, and naturally tried to make as much money out of it as possible. It included a four page sneak peek of the monthly auction, so people were actually able to start bidding for the best slaves even before the actual auction day. The auction itself was an ancient tradition, even though slaves here were on sale every day of the week.
“Duly noted, sir”, Sherlock replied, wrenching his arm free. “I believe my new owner is waiting.”
, he thought. He wouldn't be like that. Holmes would never have to suffer again because of an unfair, cruel owner.
Eventually John stood up. Sherlock stole a glance, but quickly returned his good eye to the teacup. The other he still held the ice against.
No, no. Holmes didn't have any money and his ID chip hadn't been synced with his card. It would probably be for the best to never sync it. He hadn't even had any time to renew Holmes's right to legally carry money.
Mycroft called for him, fumbling to get himself free. Sherlock remembered nothing of Mycroft helping him out of the car. The first clear memory of the aftermath he had was the field. He stood on frozen field, watching the sparks flying in the air as the power saw cut through the frame of the car. It lay on its roof, trapping his parents inside. Daddy had steered the car on the opposite lane, and a car had hit the left side of their's.
"Everything, Holmes."
"If it's alright with you", he responded to Lestrade, but Holmes didn't wait for them to exchange more words.
Holmes didn't seem fazed by the story in the least.
"Extra?" John repeated. "Oh, you
Memories flashed before his eyes.
?" the slave all but spat out. "You
Briefly he considered if it would be best just to tell John about his website. If ever, now would be the moment when John might actually be happy of the knowledge he had it. He could take a case and demand for payment.
"You're mine, so they're mine, too," John reminded. "I don't want you smoking."
"Thank you, ma'am," he said, ignoring the touch. People touched him all the time. To get his attention. To correct him. To discipline him. To remind him off his place. To generally remind him he wasn't a human being to the same extent they were. And sometimes, if he was very good, to reward him.
"Tell me then,
What if they had all really meant it?
"Thank you", the man said, pushing the chair quickly back. He strode to the kitchenette with a few long steps and returned to the table after adding several spoonfuls of the sauce on his plate.
Sherlock attempted to swallow the tears. His voice wavered only a little. "Yes, mistress."
"What did you do?" the guest wanted to know.
"With the lovers? Please," he scoffed. "She wouldn't just leave it lying around. She'd never be so careless. No."
His other "privileges" were to get to sleep in the master bedroom, fulfil his mistress's sexual needs and discipline the other slaves. Not a place Sherlock ever wanted to find himself in. Considering that he was the only slave for now, and likely to always be the newest slave in the house should John rent or sell him was a guarantee he was unlikely to ever become a head slave. He did not want to be put in a situation where it would be his duty to hit other slaves. Growing up, he had always resented the slaves who would beat their fellow slaves, even if it wasn't their choice.
"And there you have it," Holmes declared in a low voice. "The London cab. A perfect murder weapon."
A stunned silence followed his words. John stared at him, lips still parted in mid-speech.
Sherlock looked at his brother from the other side of the room. It wasn't in his nature to be scared easily, but he now felt a cold, twisting lump in his stomach. He wasn't as smart as Mycroft, but he wasn't stupid by any means. He knew well what this meant. And he realised that Mycroft could not help them.
"Ah," the cabbie smiled with self-satisfaction. "You don't get it yet, do you?"
"You're..." Holmes's brows furrowed in confusion and he dropped the polite speech pattern, "apologising me?"
happened?"
"Or they just want to make the child legal and equal," Holmes countered.
Sherlock glanced at the slave. She tried to smile at him reassuringly. He nodded cautiously. "Yes."
Sherlock eyed him suspiciously, though secretly he was relieved. Having rules laid out clearly would make his life significantly easier. Knowing the rules was the first step into knowing how to bend them or go around them. "Alright."
They sat in silence for the rest of the drive. Holmes followed him patiently while he limped the stairs painfully slowly to reach his flat.
Holmes smirked. "Like you said. Slave or not, the police don't consult amateurs."
"This and that", he brushed off the question. "So you wouldn't mind if I played occasionally?"
"You would've let me?" Sherlock asked, genuinely surprised. So far he had scheduled all his computer time for when John was out or taking a shower, because he would have never assumed John to allow him to use it. People in general were not encouraged to let slaves use computers on their own. Who knew, the slaves might even learn about slave right movements that way. Or try to book a trip to Norway.
"Harry's short for Harriet", John corrected. "How do you know she's an alcoholic?"
"Strip," he ordered. He had to harden his heart not to feel sorry for Holmes. "Keep the stigma visible."
Holmes obeyed albeit unwillingly. "This is waste of time."
John felt a sting of bitter anger at her dry remark. What did she know?
"Why? How did it start?"
"Sherlock! You can't withhold evidence!" Lestrade exclaimed, slapping him.
Sherlock faked a smile and nodded with equally faked enthusiasm. Well, at least he wanted to tell himself it was fake. His sudden eagerness to serve wasn’t entirely an act. After the weeks spent within the same four walls, where only meal a day and a shower three times a week had distracted his routine of absolutely nothing happening, nearly anything to do was welcome. Even if it was to serve a new master.
John cut himself off. He didn't need to ask, Holmes was his slave. He cleared his throat and started again. "Holmes, I want coffee."
"Not one like me."
He trembled as Mrs Spedding took his hand and turned it around, stroking his fingers. She lifted his chin, turning his face towards the light. She looked at his eyes and had him open his mouth to see his teeth, poking her finger in to move his cheeks out of the way. She pushed at his tongue and chuckled when he gagged, jerking away from her.
"They are your concern as a long as they are my concern," John snapped. "Should I be concerned?" he asked bemusedly.
His slave's lips curled in annoyance. "I
"I sprained it," John corrected.
Sherlock froze, but only for a second.
"I've just started", John said defensively.
"Yes, master."
"Where? How?"
"Bit timid," Mrs Spedding commented. "But they all are at first, I suppose."
, he thought while checking his watch. Knowing the buses, there was no guarantee of when the next one that accepted slaves would come. He wouldn’t have time to wait if he wanted to make it home and have some time before his job interview. He still needed to fix some parts of his CV. Waiting at InS had taken considerably more time than he had thought and Ella had practically forced him to look for a job.
"I said
"We need to establish some rules", he said as soon as Holmes had sat down with his share of the breakfast.
"Yes?"
John stepped back, letting go of the man's hair. He did not take his eyes off the slave. "I'm waiting."
John nearly choked on his own tongue at the exchange. Holmes's behaviour was outrageous, and thus technically it meant John's was, too, since he was the owner. Holmes was just his extension, and what Holmes said or did were his responsibility.
John felt guilty. He hadn't fed his slave for twenty-four hours, and Holmes looked exhausted.
"You don't need one, you just want one", Lestrade sighed. "I'll see what I can do. But I'm not promising anything. Don't pick up a fight with Anderson. Are you coming?"
"Do you often get to pick your tasks yourself?"
Thank you for reading! I'm not sure if I can ever really say "I hope the chapter was enjoyable" when it comes to this fic, but I hope it made you feel something. I would be really interested in knowing how you felt. So if you liked it and you have a moment, it would make me really happy to read your thoughts. :)
As they sat down to eat, John attempted asking again of his slave's sudden interest in house work, but he received no better answer. Holmes began asking him about his day at the clinic, and it was hours later John realised Holmes had carefully manipulated him the entire evening not to ask again. Given the previous experiences with Holmes behaving like a normal slave had him suspicious, but Holmes assured him his intentions were good when John confronted him again. John was beginning to suspect Holmes was prone to phases like these.
John sighed and shook his head helplessly. "It just went too far. The next day he was dead. Died of internal bleeding."
"Do you want me to shave?" the slave asked.
"How long have you been helping the Yard?" John finally asked him the question that must have been on his tongue ever since Lestrade had showed up to take him. "You seem to know him well."
"Here. Hold it against your eye."
"And the other?" Holmes prompted.
?" John repeated mockingly. "You're supposed to tell me!"
"Sherlock? Sherlock! Are you alright?"
"And where exactly do you want to go?" he asked, snatching his jacket from the slave's hands.
"If I'd successfully escaped, why would I've let myself be captured after three years? The third time
"Correct."
John loosened his grip on the cane. "Were you ever a pet?" he asked, just to change the subject.
Sherlock glanced at the narrow window near the ceiling. He would’ve begged on the floor to be let out in fresh air had he thought it would be any help. He had hardly been out of this room. Given his ill temperament, he hadn’t been sent to train younger slaves or do any kind of work, not even when in his boredom he had asked to be given something useful to do. He was nearing the point where he would willingly attempt something incredibly stupid during the next time he'd be herded to the showers if it weren't for the fact that he knew from experience that such an attempt would only get him tied to the bed. And then he'd be guaranteed to end up going completely insane out of the frustrating lack of anything interesting.
"You're nothing more than a slave!" John yelled, shoving at the slave violently, but Holmes didn't lose his footing. "Playing a detective because you happen to know a police officer doesn't change that!"
"There's a another bedroom upstairs if you'd rather have that one", she informed him worriedly. "It's smaller and doesn't have a cupboard for Holmes, but you could get a bed with slave space. It's more private. In case I get another tenant. But the only bathroom is here."
John stopped in his tracks. "What? How? You're a slave, you
It took nearly an hour before the LED board chimed and his number appeared on it, instructing him to room number 12.
"Says the slave who tried and
"And how is it?"
"Not yet, Holmes. It's cold and I'd like a cup of tea first."
"If you have so much energy you can use it to clean the oven!" John had yelled back at him before leaving the flat entirely, but not before reminding Holmes that there'd be severe consequences if he attempted to leave the flat without his consent. It remained a mystery why Holmes hadn't simply asked to be let out. John had thought they had reached some kind of an understanding over the matter after he'd caught him, but evidently not.
"Are you? From what I've heard, you were a wreck when Lestrade found you."
He couldn't recall his name anymore. Mike or Mickey or something like that. In his forties, though at the time it had sounded old. Dying of cancer because nothing would be done to save his life.
have the baton after all, and he preferred to be able to properly walk when he’d finally get out of here. And despite his natural instincts to rebel, he had no desire to sabotage his sale if the alternative was possible execution after the auction.
His eyes stung, but he forced himself to keep them open. It would be rude to fall asleep.
"Don't worry, Doctor Watson, we're used to him", Lestrade waved him off.
John thought about it for a moment, then shook his head. If his record so far was anything to go by, chances were he would't even be home by the time John got back –let alone would there be any food prepared. The slave had been going out a lot recently. Ever since he had got his commuting rights and permit to carry currency he had finally started to make the most of John's promise that he could go out given that John knew where he went and why.
"It's none of his business, either."
Refusing –fighting again had earned him a bloody nose and a black eye.
"There's a Lidl just around the corner and a Tesco Express down the street. What else..? You can use the bathroom whenever you want as long as I'm not using it. Same goes for the TV. Like I said, you can watch it, but if I tell you to change the channel or turn it off, you do that."
She sat in the armchair and her guest on the sofa. The guest turned to look at him curiously from head to toe as he approached.
John glanced at the desk drawer and thought of his pistol. But Holmes was already out of the door, so he took his cane and followed as quickly as his limp allowed.
"Wrong..." he muttered as Lestrade told the cameras how the "suicides were clearly linked".
"But I
"Holmes, could you–"
"But it wasn't."
"I've been asking around," Sherlock decided to answer. He'd spent a considerable amount of time reconnecting with his old connections and retrieving items he'd hidden or given away years ago. He had asked about Moriarty, but with little success. "The majority know nothing and those who seem to know something are too scared to talk. Just rumours in the shadows and figures in the corner of my eye."
But the girls paid cash in advance and had something for Holmes to wear. John didn't care to know what it was. While he slept comfortably in his bed, his slave was paraded around, groped and stared at, made to pour drinks, dance and perform idiotic tasks for the partiers entertainment.
"Of course. Forgive me."
Mycroft froze and looked at him with confusion. "I have no power whatsoever to buy you. I have never offered that."
Holmes looked delighted to return to his original theory, and delivered a maddeningly quick speech about Harry's shaking hands and how John didn't get along with her.
"I'm just saying, the economy, for example. They'd move all factories out of this country if it weren't for slaves", his master continued, completely oblivious to moodiness taking over his slave. "The world wouldn't function without slaves."
"Shh..." he hushed gently, pulling his arms around Sherlock, who first tensed at the touch, but soon relaxed and pressed his cheek against Mycroft's chest.
John paused to fumble for words, to find a way to explain that he just couldn't let himself forget that. That when he looked at Holmes he saw brilliance, but he knew he wasn't supposed to. It wasn't proper. He wasn't supposed to say it out loud, he wasn't supposed to look at his slave like that. Slaves were not people.
The cabbie just chuckled and shook his head. Whether it was a "no, I won't tell you" or a "no, you didn't" he couldn't tell. Sherlock grit his teeth.
He gave up on escaping. He hardly ever missed his curfew. Perhaps that was why his owners were so enraged when the Powers case caught his attention.
to touch him."
"Oh, come
John ignored him. "I could have you flogged. No, actually I
John sat heavily onto the bed, dragging his hand through his hair in despair.
He’d been on his new task for several minutes when Dr Watson put away the laptop and started to get ready to leave, so Sherlock temporarily abandoned the dishes to help the jacket on the ex-army doctor.
"The law may not acknowledge us, but you are still a brother to me," the older slave argued.
tempt me."
She disappeared through a back door that locked itself automatically behind her. John glanced at the clock on the wall and for the lack of anything better to do began reading.
Sherlock knew only one such slave, but even Mycroft, classified as a lethal weapon for his duty to bodyguard his mistress, most certainly did not practice capoeira. Capoeira and other disguised forms of fighting and self-defence for slaves were highly illegal. A slave caught practicing one could be put down with no questions asked.
Like his master, Sherlock was no stranger to nightmares. Scarce were the slave who never dreamt of the abuse they had suffered. It was not the first and unlikely the last time Sherlock woke up gasping for breath, half expecting to drown for several harrowing seconds before his brains caught up with the reality.
Pity being hit by a rugby trophy hadn't killed the man. Though had he died or been permanently injured there would've been nothing Greg could've done to save Sherlock's life. After being taken away in slave cuffs the next time Greg saw him he had been under a very real threat of termination. His case had attracted some attention from slave rights activists, but it was Greg who ultimately spoke in defence of 99OR-79/3J3A.
"There has to be something that can be done," Mycroft insisted.
He hissed in pain when the guard thwacked the side of his head. “You’re complete waste of money and you’ve been given far too many chances already.”
Seeing there was nothing else he could say, John had made a hasty retreat. He didn't go to his second interview. The one that would have been his "proper" job interview that could have got him back working on the medical field. He wouldn't have wanted the crappy job the unemployment office had directed him to, anyway.
"But Mummy, what about the fireworks?" The fireworks were the one thing Sherlock had been anxiously waiting for all night.
"Lestrade managed to bribe him to borrow me couple of times, but I haven't worked much with the Yard since 2004 when I was sold to my seventh owner. And then of course... I was sold to Florida."
John gestured the room. "You've cleaned."
"Still. You've been meeting them an awful lot after we moved."
"He will. He thinks himself clever. He's a serial killer, he's craving for attention."
"Well then," he said with a bow in his best clothes as he prepared to leave early in the afternoon.
Life rarely goes the way one imagines it would. No matter who you were when you were born, unthinkable things can happen. Sometimes life turns out better than you would have ever imagined, but sometimes... Sometimes it can go horribly wrong. Small things can turn into bigger ones, the tiniest details can determine the reality around you and turn it upside-down. The most innocent, well meant words can bring forth hell.
A year into this world, to this never ending load of work. It was sometimes hard to remember anything existed before it. Hard to remember who he was. That he was a person at all.
Their slaves had already packed their own belongings as well as chosen some clothes for the brothers. They wouldn't be allowed more than they could fit into duffle bags handed to them, but whatever they took would legally belong to them. Once all the paperwork was done, they didn't have much time to pack and choose. A lady from InS urged them to take only what they really needed and wanted to keep. Clothes, shoes, maybe a photograph or some small mementos. She probably assumed a child such as Sherlock would take a toy or two for comfort. Instead he abandoned third of his clothes to fit in his father's antique violin, case and all, even though it was still a little too large for him to play.
"She's coming with the tube then?"
"Sherlock, this is serious," he barked. "You'll be killed if he returns you. Please, just this once… Behave. Submit to it.
The door which Holmes had opened led to a sitting room with two tall windows facing the street. The room looked like it had been renovated and not touched since. The wallpapers were modern and stylish, the furniture cozy, but a mishmash of this and that. The other door from the landing, he realised, led into the kitchen that was joined to the sitting room. A full size kitchen compared to his current one. Holmes led him to a short corridor that led to a bathroom and a bedroom, both of them probably added to the house later by knocking down a wall.
"You know exactly what I'm talking about," Sherlock countered, giving a meaningful glance at the pink mobile in the cabbie's left hand.
”Only for the decorated ones, and even them only if someone applies for them to get one. Apparently your heroic actions awarded you one.” She glanced at the printer, unconsciously stroking her wavy black hair behind her ear. She was wearing large silver leaf earrings. ”Whatever it is you did.”
”First slave?”, she commented after ten seconds of more typing and clicking.
"So what's different with this one?" Holmes wanted to know.
"I texted Mrs Wilson's phone that I want to meet there. If someone randomly found the phone, they'd either ignore it or might try reply to it. But if the murderer reads it, he'll panic. It's only been a few hours since he killed."
He moaned and dragged himself on the seat. The flashing lights of the cars passing by made him feel nauseous and he was reminded of The Oyster House again. Of the flashing lights, loud music and people dancing. Of hands on his body, the smell of alcohol in their breaths and the despair at the face of it all.
was the deal. You had
Holmes's jaw tightened and to his triumph, John thought he saw him blush slightly. The slave stood up abruptly.
"Yeah? What's so special about you?"
The man rustled his papers, clearly trying to let them know the conversation was over. "If your future owner chooses to free you after you've turned eighteen, you can contact the Institute and apply to become your brother's guardian. But even that would require you to first purchase him. Until then there's nothing to be done."
"You can sleep after you're finished. Be silent, I don't want you bothering me or the neighbours."
John threw his hands in the air and shook his head in frustration. Clearly Holmes did not want to talk about this. "Forget it. I don't want to fight with you. Just tell me if I should be worried or not."
And of course Ella had made him promise he'd go to the interview, though he hadn't told her what kind of a job it was. He wasn't sure if she'd approve. He'd focused on talking about another one he had later today.
“My name is Holmes.”
Holmes took the plastic bag to the kitchen, switching the kettle on as he started emptying it.
Sherlock shook his head. "I don't know, I wasn't there. John said someone offered him money in exchange for me. I assumed–"
"Yes, but you could still return him. My employer would be happy to pay you for doing that."
No reply came from the slave and he didn't move an inch from the bed where he was apparently just resting, eyes closed but his hands brought over his chest into a prayer-like position. John pushed the chair a bit further away from the table to see the slave better.
"Well, I wouldn't have signed a contract for a slave like him anyway", Mike said somewhat disgustedly. "My slave behaves like a proper slave, but I wouldn't sign her a contract."
"Two-two-one Baker Street," he mumbled, having made sure his coat sleeves properly covered his wrists.
"When he's sixty and only if he serves his mistress acceptably," his slave replied. He managed to say it as if the idea appalled him.
"What the
Since Mycroft's visit he had attempted to clean his act a little. Mycroft was right, of course. He always was. And wasn't that hateful?
"I just did", John reminded. "Even after you had done it on your own. You may be my first personal slave, but you aren't the first slave I've dealt with. I'm a fair owner, I promise you. Act well and I have nothing against rewarding you. Switch on the TV.""
He typed the end of his email quickly, sent it, logged off and made sure to erase all his traces from the browser's history. John didn't need to know about his website or how he'd been doing research on Austrian chocolates and poisons. That would only lead to unwanted questions. Better his "hobby" would still stay a secret.
"You're still a slave," he blurted out.
"He seems independent the way slaves usually aren't. It's more like he'd become a slave recently, actually. He's obedient, but not submissive. We ate breakfast together this morning, and it was more like talking with a friend than a slave."
The slave seemed uncertain how to react. "I'm sorry I got you involved," he apologised. "Won't happen again."
"Yet I am", the slave agreed.
"The fan of Sherlock Holmes."
Holmes's eyebrows furrowed and he looked at John like he'd just been asked something completely irrational. In a way, John knew, he had. He shrugged: "I've no interest in starving you. It's not like I'm eating it now. I can have it tomorrow if there's any left, but you might as well have some now."
He wished he had never seen it. He dreamt of being chained and whipped for weeks, startling awake to ghost pain and pounding heart.
He couldn't believe it. Did not want to believe it. He was mistress's investment, wasn't he? Why would she sell him? How
"What about Redbeard?" Sherlock cried. "Where will he go? Who's gonna take care of him?"
She shook her head, but smiled. "Upstairs then, Dr Watson. Billy", she addressed the boy, evidently her slave, "put the kettle on."
“It most likely doesn't concern you, but this item cannot sign the so called “emancipation” contract before two-thousand and...” she rustled the papers for reference, “thirty-two.”
. You defied me in front of a dozen police officials. You spoke against me. I have never been so embarrassed in my life," John shouted. "You are my property, and you
in shock," Lestrade corrected. "And that's fine, you nearly got yourself killed."
It took nearly two weeks until Sherlock saw Mrs Hudson again. She didn't see him, and he had no way of getting to her.
"You're not very good at lying, John. It's something to do with me."
A sly smile unlike anything John had ever seen on a slave appeared on his face and the man swung the umbrella twice. "It's my business to know."
John swallowed. Three pairs of eyes looked at him, anticipating. But if the rent truly would be around the same as Holmes had assured him it would be... If he'd get a job he could afford it. It wouldn't leave him much cash to spare, but he could rent Holmes... The location was more than perfect, the rooms were more than he could hope for. It came with furniture.
John frowned, itching to turn around. "I don't follow."
John checked the messages, but the only new one was the one from unknown number.
"I said no."
"I've had masters who have let me go out when I have no duties to perform", the man argued. "I couldn't have known
"Sherlock Holmes, mistress", he sniffed, too late remembering what Mycroft had told him about his real name.
Sherlock Holmes?"
"What if I chose I'd like to call you by your real name?"
"What name thing?"
"Er, excuse me", John interrupted, "but what do you mean "cases"?"
"Excellent. Come along, master." The slave strode to the blue and white tape, Lestrade following close behind. It was unsettling to see a slave walk with such confidence, as if he owned the place. Neither men paid attention to John trying to keep up with them.
Whichever the case, Sherlock changed to pyjamas and slipped under the duvet. It was heavenly compared to sleeping on the floor or even on the thin mattress in the cupboard. Soft and warm, and it smelled faintly of fresh flowery fabric conditioner Mrs Hudson had made him use. He practically melted against the mattress and buried his cheek against the pillow with a delighted sigh. A bed was such a normal, simple thing, yet for a slave it was a rare luxury. Sherlock had slept on top of John's bed at the previous flat, but the last actual, proper time he'd slept in a bed had been with master and mistress Summers back in December. Back then sex had always been involved if he had been given the privilege of actually staying in the bed for the night. More often than not he'd been ordered to move away once his services were no longer needed. Sharing the bed with his mistress had only been allowed when master was away. Would John let him stay, he wondered?
! It's Baker Street. Two-two-one Baker Street," he repeated persistently, leaning closer to the window to see inside the car and take a good look at the driver. "It's not far."
"Case?" He was momentarily at loss. "Oh yes, that case. I found it. Talk to John, it's at his flat."
"Yes, mistress," he agreed.
"Sherlock Holmes..." he spoke, smugly shaking his head a little. "I've heard so much about you. And look at you now, all at my mercy."
"Yeah, capoeira. Chinned my mate here. Look."
"Oh…" He remembered Holmes's explanation about the e-mails. Perhaps this slave had nothing to do with the earlier meeting after all.
the violin was his to keep. That
"No, just John. I've never been called 'master' before, it's weird", he admitted, but hurried to continue: "Obviously you'll call me 'master' in public."
Work kept him busy for the next three days, and Holmes's good behaviour persisted. Lestrade phoned him, asking if he could borrow Holmes. He agreed, but was secretly disappointed not to be able to go with them. But perhaps it had been for the best. Despite still remaining polite, Holmes complained it had been incredibly boring and waste of his time.
"Why does it matter to you?"
John laughed nervously. “Oh…”
"No, no they don't," Hope agreed. "Come on in and I'll show you. It's much better."
"It was a long time ago."
At the same time he dreaded the idea of Holmes in the same room. He knew well enough by now that he probably said things in his sleep, whimpered and cried, maybe even shouted or screamed. It wasn't something he'd like anyone to witness.
