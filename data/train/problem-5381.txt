Tony held up a hand to stop them for a moment, putting his helmet back on. And even though his face wasn’t visible, Steve still could see the tension in his movements.
Steve jolted sideward, trying to be fast enough before the phone went a second time. He disentangled both arms from Tony’s upper body, flexing his fingers before holding the device in front of his frowning face. With a long exhale, Steve’s pupils flew over whatever message had appeared on the display. After a minute, he tossed the phone back on the nightstand, momentarily allowing his temper to get the best of him. His jaw tightened, his brows drew together in a firm line and his hand shook with how tight he was gripping the pillow beneath him.
Steve smiled—he couldn’t help it—and leaned down to kiss Tony once more, before slowly moving downwards, along Tony’s chest, nipping briefly at his bellybutton before his thumb slipped over Tony’s erection, teasing him with lazy circles.
He dashed forward, bodily and mentally. While he shot repulsor beams at Ultron, he also fought his way into Ultron’s matrix.
"He really doesn't need his ego patted, Steve," Bruce called from across the table. The science professor was sitting comfortably next to his wife, Betty, nursing a glass of wine and wearing what Steve assumed was his finest tuxedo suit. Steve laughed at that, nodding his head. That was true enough. He recalled Bruce's indignant expression when Steve had told him about the development in his and Tony's relationship. They had gone to that same shitty cafe and Steve was buying. Bruce had seemed ready to high-five him.
After a moment, Barnes’ face hardened. Tony had long since sat back on the floor, regarding him with cautiousness. Somehow, Tony knew exactly what Barnes was thinking right now and he just…
He had chosen a side—the side that wasn’t Steve’s—and thus, he had forfeited the lasting remnants of hope on his own happiness. In the process, he had willed his own wishes away, mentally letting go of what could have been if he and Steve had stayed friends just a little while longer.
The next thing Tony knew, Steve hauled him upwards and resituated him in his lap, pressing their chests together. He dipped his cock back inside Tony, so goddamn deep now, that an involuntary tremor rumbled through his limbs.
It was too much. Steve’s hands dug into his skin when he felt himself about to tumble over. “Shit, I—”
“You were a bit of an asshole,” Tony confirmed with a crooked grin. “Will your childhood hero ever forgive you?”
The war was… it was taking parts out of him. Tiny parts, but Steve felt as all those horrors, each and every day, slowly but steadily wound their way into his heart.
Tony nodded and cupped Steve’s cheeks with both hands. They both sat leaning towards each other, but even that small space between them seemed too much. Drawing nearer, he saw Steve’s eyes had focused on something he couldn’t see, but the expression on his face spoke of horrors beyond imagination. Tony remembered the blood leaving his body, remembered those stab wounds, and the pain was a distant hum, but the pure despair in Stephanus’ eyes wasn’t.
"Mr. Stane, may I offer some painkillers? Mr. Hogan is just outside, ready to assist you in case you're still unstable on your feet. Can you stand?" She fired one question after the other, while Stane was slowly sitting himself upright and holding a hand to his forehead.
Vision shrugged—he’d seen Wanda do it, whenever she tried to look casual, and figured it were those little things that would make him seem more human. “He figured out who Steve was, and decided to call him out on it. He did, however, realize that Steve had no hostile plans, so he decided to play along, and lie to you in the weeks to follow.”
Another moan ripped through the air, once Steve had pushed his fingers further into Tony. “Harder,” Tony demanded, and of course he’d be absolutely unashamed as he gripped his beautifully curved cock, rocking between the two sensations.
“I know it’s not our only option,” Steve said calmly. “Or… maybe it is. Maybe we lost too much time and all the other options are gone. Point is, it’s the only one we’ve got right now. We don’t have time to sit around and wait for something else to spring to mind.” A soft beat, and Steve leaned down, pressing their foreheads together. They usually tried to tone down the PDA whenever the others were around, but desperate times and all that… His hands grasped Tony’s as his thumbs ran comforting circles into his skin.
Fury’s gaze darkened, but he didn’t seem surprised. He knew Steve’s views on punishment without a proper prosecution and what he would or wouldn’t agree on. “We can’t afford to wait that long.”
“Let go, baby,” Tony murmured softly, clutching Steve as close as he could. “I know you can. I’ve got you.”
So he fisted Tony’s hair and dragged him away from his throat, ignoring the whimper of protest that tumbled through Tony’s lips. “It’s Steve,” he told him firmly. “My name is Steve.” With that, he pressed his lips to Tony’s mouth. And immediately, any sliver of doubt that this wasn’t a dream was banished.
“Of course they did.” Tony sighed and raised his voice. “Well, if she ever comes near anyone with her creepy magic again, I’ll put her in the Hulk-out room.”
Steve knew the last year hadn’t been easy, the loss of Extremis forcing Tony to once more learn how to function without the ability to perform inventions and improvements at his fingertips. On the other hand, there was the government, calling him over to DC almost every other day. And there was Ian.
Steve heaved a low breath, taking that last step of the stairwell, and stopped when he saw Natasha leaning next to his door.
Instinctively, Tony tried to hang onto some grain of strength, but step-by-step, Ultron was taking hold of him. And deep inside, he knew he couldn’t so much as lift a finger in defense.
Tony had reached up and brushed back the hair that fell across Steve’s forehead. Steve had closed his eyes, feeling his face heat at Tony’s touch.
“You’re lucky they’re still clothed,” Clint declared. “I once caught them with their pants down in the gym. If you haven’t seen their schlongs by the end of the year, you can call yourself one happy man.”
They were kissing, and then Tony told him he could touch the scars. Embarrassed, Steve allowed himself to more directly feel them. He'd touched them briefly before, but never truly investigated them. The play of dull and sensitive skin was tantalizing to watch, and Steve had to pull his attention away with conscious effort.
“It seems, there has been an unexpected visitor,” Friday replied at once. “The whole team has assembled.”
Natasha closed her eyes as Bucky’s fingers dipped beneath the waistband of her pants, though he knew she tried not to. He traced the hem around her waist and grinned when she quickly reopened her eyes as he ground his middle against her, pressing her further into the mattress of his bed. His mouth was millimeters away from hers when he said, “You missed me. I know you did.”
The front door of the farm house opened, and Tony stepped outside, looking a little frazzled. He turned around, then fixated Bucky with his eyes. “Got news for you, Frosty.”
“I really can’t believe you,” Tony said, shying away from Steve as he tried reaching for him. There wasn’t much room to maneuver on the steep trail however, and he ended up almost stumbling into the greenery. Steve caught him around the waist, pulling him near even as Tony glared at him. “You’ve gotten us lost in the middle of nowhere,” he complained.
He saw them all in his mind, as they stood there on the deserted airport like the opening of an overly dramatic musical show, and wondered how the hell they got here. Weeks ago most of them had lazed around at the tower, bickering over movies, giving foot rubs to random people and arguing over who took the last beer out of the fridge.
Tony frowned at him for a moment, but his eyes were clearly set on Steve and that was… great, really.
A few minutes passed before Tony felt he could attempt to broach the line between sleep and wakefulness any more than he already had. His mind raced against his body’s will, trying to remember what he had consumed the night before and just how much of it.
Steve stepped forward, doing that thing with his shoulders that made him five inches larger. “Diving in head-first without a plan is still better than only reacting when it's too late.”
. There should be laws against Steve looking the way he did now. All flushed skin and potent need. However, soon enough, Tony felt a wave of giddiness surge through him. So they were both alright with switching, that was… God, that was perfect.
"He'd better," was all he actually said, giving Tony another kiss and pulling back. If he stayed close much longer, he'd get distracted, and then there'd be no telling when they'd stumble out of bed.
When they’d arrived at the address Agent Romanoff had given them, they’d stood in front of an enormous building. Above the front entrance Steve could see the inscription:
Steve’s only answer was a groan. But his body communicated plenty as he pressed his whole frame against Tony’s. Tony’s hands glided up his chest and underneath his shirt to slide it off him. As it puddled on the floor, Steve grabbed him around the waist to spin them both around. Tony winced and clutched his side.
“You do that,” Steve said lowly, irritation rising within him. Years ago, he wouldn’t have thought that losing JARVIS would hit him that hard, but here he was. And he didn’t want to stop his mourning because the guy that had JARVIS’ voice was having an epiphany. “We’ll meet at the—”
Steve hesitated. He did because he knew a panic attack when he saw one. He'd had quite a few before the serum, and he'd been lucky because Bucky had usually been there to help him through it, but for the life of him Steve couldn't remember
Tony looked up at him with his big brown eyes that had Steve’s heart skip a beat every time he stared into them directly, and a tiny smile rose to his lips. “That’s something only you would say,” he said, huffing softly, before he leaned in and slowly kissed Steve back.
Without hesitation, she undid the buttons of his trousers, and there was nothing romantic about the fierce coupling that followed. He only pressed her against the wall and took what she offered.
that he'd remember before it was too late. I know what it must've looked like, and I'm sorry that you had to go through that, I really am, but the serum can take a lot. A lot more than some flesh wounds, and I needed to take that chance.”
Steve made a face at him, but did as he was told. He wound an arm around Tony and pulled him near, moving them back and forth until he could take a decent selfie of them both and the mirror.
“Zoning out,” she replied and smiled knowingly. “Tony will come around, Steve. You just need to use this opportunity wisely.”
Tony exhaled slowly and regained his breath. He squeezed Steve’s hand lightly. “I think you shouldn’t be so hard on yourself. You’ve braved yourself into things this far.”
His eyes lingered on Tony’s chest. He never thought he would be partial to a man’s chest, but he was. Suddenly, Tony’s chest was the most sexy thing he’d ever seen.
“Good.” Snatching the can in mid-air, Steve grabbed Tony’s hand and basically dragged him up the stairs. They didn’t waste much time, and soon enough, Steve had Tony beneath him, naked and ready and very willing. There were still some chocolate smudges on both of their bodies, but foreplay was only bearable for so long.
Standing up, he realized he wouldn’t have been able to defeat her. She had gained the advantage over him, and the only reason he wasn’t dead by now was that she hadn’t wanted to kill him.
He turned around somewhat, cleaning first his hands and then, a bit awkwardly, the insides of his pants.
An hour later, Steve waved at the others as the elevator’s doors closed. After asking FRIDAY to lock the penthouse, he turned around and saw Tony standing at the foot of the stairs, tossing the can of chocolate frosting from one hand to the other, smirking at him.
Dazed, Steve stood in the center of the room. He had no idea what to do, and he only looked over his shoulder when he heard steps. “I should check on Wanda,” he heard himself say.
“Whatever you decide—the team will deal with it. Whether we’re all staying here, or if we’re splitting up again… or if the two of you decide to take a timeout… we can deal with it. You don’t have to worry about that.”
When he glanced back at Tony, Steve saw him already halfway through the first sandwich, and it made him smile. So that had been a good idea. "So long as you get to sleep at some point," he said, then turned his attention back to the suit. It was difficult to see all the details from where he was standing, but he wasn't sure if it was off limits to come any closer.
It took two more weeks before he called Steve again. This time, however, Steve didn’t say a word either. Tony managed a whole minute of listening to his shallow breathing before he ended the call once more.
Steve just hugged him, and when Tony's voice faded, he finally kissed his cheek. "You don't have to say anything back."
When he stood a few feet away from Tony, his gaze shifted from his face down to his hands. There were a few bruises on his knuckles that had Steve suck in a sharp breath.
Evidently, by the time the group had moved to the old part of the house—back through the entry hall, the kitchen, and into ‘Clara’s room’—Tony had well and truly lost all remaining interest.
Tony glanced at him. “I have no idea, I’m not a shrink. Maybe you’re my way of dealing with J’s death, or I just really need to get laid again, what would I know.”
Instead of answering, Steve only rolled his eyes. And then, with his free hand, he let a finger drift over one of the feathers. They felt… different. It was hard to figure out what it was, but there was a warmth pulsing beneath—a light shining from within. They were beautiful—even now, even bloodied as they were. “Does it hurt?”, Steve asked, his voice cautious.
Bucky stared at the ground for a long minute, then shook his head. “They put me in the cell, and… the soldiers weren’t there, it was just that doctor. He had a book with him. He… he said something to me. I can’t remember what, I…” Suddenly, his eyes were awash in remembrance, trained on his metal hand. “He wanted to know about Siberia. Where I was kept. He wanted to know exactly where.”
“This might get a bit more than unexpected,” Steve protested quietly. The Mind Gem clearly was the uncontrollable factor here, and yet… he realized that if someone had to bear it, he wanted it to be JARVIS.
“Yes,” Steve answered, his voice achingly hushed. A tiny smile quirked his lips as he studied the guilt that shadowed Tony’s brown eyes. “Just… please go slow.”
“Easy now,” Steve said softly, trying and failing to conceal his mirth. He guided Tony’s hand through the water, turning it back and forth. “That’s it.”
When he looked up, things got… a little strange. After he’d run into Strucker, Steve had stood right behind the building’s entrance, and now, he was lying at the bottom of a stairwell. Focusing on the matter at hand, Steve shook off his confusion and instead ran back up the stairs. Once he stepped through the door, he spotted the girl again and, raising his shield to her head, he ordered, “Stand down
There was a blast of air, and the next thing Steve knew, he was knocked to the ground. While he hadn’t seen anything, he knew enough about how it felt to be tackled by someone, and this had definitely been a person—male, probably.
“Goddammit,” Clint said, evidently unhampered by the awkwardness of the situation. “I expect a state of the art tractor, Tony, all extras, in shiny purple, are we clear?”
“I can make you feel so good,” Tony repeated, running his index finger over Steve’s shirt. “You never did this before, did you?”
He grabbed for the suit’s helmet, pulling it off and letting it drop to the floor. It was his tech, it could take it. He moved around in Steve’s arms, staring up at him intently. “Long story short: We won’t suffocate. That enough?”
He felt Steve trembling against him. His hands still cupped Tony’s face, his fingers rubbing imperfect circles into his skin.
With that, the man spun around and thrust out a knife from his pocket, nearly slicing off Bucky’s human hand in the process.
Steve’s body quivered with alarmed arousal as his mind clinked out. His hands blindly sought Tony’s wrists, trying to make him slow down.
“You want to?” Steve echoed and Tony tried hard to ignore how those words affected him. Steve sounded almost…
Tony seemingly couldn’t bear it any longer. He turned around, set into motion and walked a few steps to the other side of the room, coming to a stop with his back towards the others.
At the end of it all, Steve was fine. And Stane, the man who’d made their lives a living Hell for far too long, was dead—and that was all that mattered.
With a deep frown, Steve glanced down at the card. “What is this?” he asked, squinting at the code Tony had written down there.
He’d died… Antonius had died. And the feeling of it would now forever be burned into Tony’s memories. The last thing he remembered were fingers brushing over his forehead and then he’d… vanished. He’d left.
Tony needed to figure out into what time period the Eye had dropped him. Maybe he should’ve thought of a specific date when he’d put the necklace on?
. He marveled at how Steve could make him happy to see him and thoroughly furious, and really, really pissed off and annoyed, all at the same time. He kneeled next to Tony, looking down at him, and as much as Tony was glad to see him, he also kind of wanted to punch him in the face.
Tony took a deep breath, held it, and exhaled. Of course Steve would want to go in alone—the reason was pretty fucking obvious. And the South carrier was closest to the Triskelion, which also meant he’d face the worst opposition. “I don’t mean to put a damper on anything,” Tony said slowly, glancing up at Steve. “But are you aware that everyone aboard those carriers could be HYDRA?”
“Alright,” Pepper said eventually and only a beat later, she began to talk of all the preparations that would be necessary for the ball to happen on such a short notice. However, Steve hardly heard what she said, because the look on Tony’s face was absent once more, and Steve could see from the way his shoulders drew upward that he was trying to hide something.
The words hit Steve like a tidal wave. He couldn’t move. Couldn’t open his mouth to do as Tony asked and that was it—that was enough. Tony’s hands dropped from Steve’s body and a self-deprecating smile took hold of his lips. “It’s alright. You’re a good man. I would never ask you to love a murderer.”
This was how Steve had always imagined the ‘old Tony’ to be. A man driven by his own ideas. A man shaping the future, no matter the odds. He’d seen glimpses of him while they’d traveled through Southern Europe, and seeing that devotion back in his eyes now, it almost had Steve tearing up.
Tony’s expression darkened even further. “You know what,” he snapped, and neared Steve like a leopard on the hunt. “For once, I completely agree with you.”
Steve let himself slump down against Tony, mindful to keep some of his weight off him. He knew Tony was right. Even though they were the same people, it still wasn’t the same.
Steve nodded, saying nothing. They all had their fair share of nightmares, and he’d known Tony’d had a particularly hard time after his fight against Aldrich Killian, and once more after Ultron.
Tony jumped swiftly on his feet, but the scene outside hadn’t changed. But then, Steve’s hands were suddenly on his upper body and he pushed him hard against Fury and—
“Just because you couldn’t get through to him doesn’t mean that I can’t,” he snapped at her and immediately wanted to take the words back, but it was too late. There was a brief look of hurt on Natasha’s face, before she schooled her expression. Then, she turned on her heels and made to move back into the house.
The next second, the door to the penthouse flew open and Pepper walked in, impeccably dressed in vintage Chanel. She gave the room a once-over and shuddered. “God, Tony, this place is a pigpen.” Making an executive decision, she snapped open her cell phone and punched in a number. “Happy? I need a cleaning service over here. Offer to pay them double their rate if they can do it today.” Her eyes flicked over to a plate of Spaghetti spilled all over the floor. “And get a cleaning service that specializes in Macassar ebony. Thanks.”
Tony smiled at Barnes’ wide eyes, then stepped up next to him. That wasn’t excitement yet, but he hadn’t turned on his heels and left, so Tony counted it a win.
“Negative!” Steve shouted back. He and Bucky raced towards a ladder leading up to the upper level. “If that truck crashes, the gem could level the city. We need to draw out Ultron.”
Tony bit his lip. “I don't remember Steve dimension-hopping back then, so that’s new, but…” He sighed, obviously finishing whatever he’d had to say in his mind. After a beat, his eyes flickered back to Steve. He quirked a smile. “Sorry for… the kiss and… the stripping.” He rubbed another hand over his neck. “I guess we’re not an item where you come from. That must’ve thrown you for a loop.”
Tony watched for a moment, mesmerized by the woman's grief, then walked towards the next room. He felt like his body was moving on autopilot, his legs functioning while his mind still tried to process what had happened.
Steve smiled knowingly. “Now that you mention it, why don’t we make a little detour to Coney Island? The park should be open for another hour.”
“Did I ever?” Clint asked and grinned. “Sooo, now that I’ve clearly saved your marriage: No sex in my house, you hear me, Cap? Thin walls, impressionable children, and Laura actually likes her sheets and I would hate having to burn them.”
Steve stared off into the large hangar. His hand, however, cupped the back of Tony’s head, his thumb brushing gently over the curve of his cheek. “I don’t want this to come between us.”
“Try,” Steve urged. “All of this, there needs to be a reason behind it. We need to figure out who’s trying to blackmail you and why. So you got on the plane, and then what?”
It wasn’t a loud crash that stopped Tony’s words, just a subdued whooshing sound. At first, he’d thought something on the now-crooked supply shelves had fallen to the floor, but when he looked up, he stared directly into the serene face of Vision.
Tony’s exhalation blew through the air. “You’ll have to sign first. There’s a paragraph explicitly saying it’s a draft paper and all parties will be allowed to negotiate further changes. I had my lawyers check it, already. Sign first, discuss later. It’s safe.”
Steve smiled as he panted, struggling to catch breath. They stumbled into the tent together, mindful to pull the zipper up behind them. When Steve turned around to look at Tony, though, he was already sitting in the middle of the tent, looking at the ground with a serious expression.
Rhodey gave him a look when he returned. “We need you strong now.” He shoved the plate into Tony’s hand, holding the coffee at arm’s length. “Eat. Then drink your coffee.”
, Tony,” he cursed, and there were trembling fingers brushing along his neck, while Steve buried his face in Tony’s shoulder.
Barnes snorted. “I know what an AI is,” he interjected and had the audacity to roll his eyes at Tony.
“His recent associates have proven a liability to SHIELD.” Fury turned away as though ashamed. “And as you might have guessed, SHIELD has a traditional way of dealing with its various obstacles, including arbitrary personnel. And since I have taken action against our policies…” He trailed off, frowning at his own words.
Gesturing the others to hold open the door, Steve gingerly maneuvered him over the threshold and into a room that strongly smelled like hospital. God, Tony hated hospitals.
The grin turned to something a little more soft. “Those I always forgive.” Steve leaned in, making a pleased sound as their lips touched ever so gently, and Tony was still surprised by how little Steve cared for what people thought of them. He planted one on Tony whenever he felt like it, and now, with hundreds of people mingling all around them, and a few even coming to a halt and staring blatantly, Steve only seemed to kiss him more fiercely.
Tony let go with one arm and looked at him intently. “I’m sober. Well, mostly. Two beers don’t count, right?”
“He doesn’t have to explain himself to us, that’s why. We’re strangers. You’re his best friend. It’s just easier for now. You need to respect that.”
Sam tried for a smile as he stepped up to them. There was a thin dribble of blood leaking from his hairline. “At least no one got killed. That’s something to be thankful for.”
“—not the do-gooder he wants us to believe he is,” Tony finished. “Yeah, well, we figured. Aside yourself or the agents down in records, I don’t believe anyone knows
"Actually, they didn't do anything," Steve said, sitting down in the chair across from Bucky and looking at him closely. He was pale, but looking much better than he did when he showed up at Steve's door. Bucky lifted an eyebrow at him, a silent 'oh?' "I… After what happened, I just quit. They never court martialed me."
Tony smiled and moved just enough to nuzzle Steve’s cheek delicately. “That was a no-brainer. You’re the nicest guy on earth. I knew you wouldn’t be like Ty.”
If things with Pierce came to a close, he wouldn’t be able to pilot Iron Man like this—or rather, Steve wouldn’t deem him fit enough to join the fight. He would put him on the bench with nothing more than a worried but oh so stern glance and there was
The library, however—Steve didn’t recognize this room. The slightly dusty books, the dark ceiling-high shelves, the old desk. It looked like some kind of time capsule, closer to what Steve had been used to in the 40s. He hadn’t been here before, though something about this place rang familiar anyway.
Maria nodded determinedly. “You’re absolutely right, Doctor Banner. It isn’t. Now’s the time to put the Winter Soldier in front of a judge, where he belongs.”
“I like the way you think, Rogers,” Tony said, grinning broadly, as soon as he realized what Steve had in mind. He was all but towering over him now, complete in boots and uniform and,
“Look, you can’t deny that I was best qualified to do a quick scan of the perimeter. It would’ve taken you
“Hey man,” Rhodes warned. “That’s my best friend you’re trash-talking about. Better check what you’re saying.”
Steve’s lips drew upward in a tender smile. “It’s… still about the weirdest thing that ever happened to me, and that’s saying something. You and I… well, I don’t have to tell you we have a difficult past.”
It was sad, in its own way. But Tony guessed there was nothing to be done. Today was the first time they’d met ever since, and though the Antarctic hadn’t exactly warmed up, Obi had been fairly polite, even shaking Steve’s hand for about half a second.
When it came to men, he’d always had a weak spot for the blonde bulky sort of guys. And this one hit all the marks.
Tony made a face but didn’t argue, letting Steve put on his blue button-down slowly. “How’s everyone, by the way? Did Vision settle in?”
"The Hulk and Scarlet Witch are ready to lift the debris blocking the exit," Vision said in his calm, even tone. "You might want to dress up and move out of the way." He stood still, watching them expectantly for long seconds. Something about the play of muscles or light on Vision's face changed, and Steve could've sworn his impassive expression had somehow shifted into a smug one.
The next instant, something crashed hard above their heads, and the ground began to shake. The steel beams whined, and in the distance, he heard something rip apart. And then the floor gave way, and in an instant, Steve was falling—
It dawned on him then. Tony was memorizing him. Committing his every contour to memory. There was no gratitude in his touch—this was pure yearning at its best. For a split-second, Steve vowed to ask him why he was so afraid to lose Steve all of a sudden, but then, Tony’s hand wrapped fully around his length, a quivering breath pressing past his lips.
Tony bit his lower lip, staring at the van in front of them. “You sure you don’t need Bruce as backup?”
Tony, for his part, was alone in Clint’s barn. He stood in the shadows, silently tinkering with the old tractor, fixing something for a change while he waited for the go to fly off. He reached into the lapels of his jacket in habitual search for his favorite red screwdriver, then leaned down and loosened the screws of the engine hood. The dark green tractor was an antique, and usually, he enjoyed working on old machines, but today, his heart wasn’t in it.
He reached for one of his tablets, typing on the screen so fast Steve had trouble following. It seemed he was giving Jocasta instructions, then dated them back four years ago. When he was done with that, he photographed the floor plan, then highlighted an area on the lowest floor of the castle.
Steve shook his head heavily. “But… I thought… Everyone told me how much you loved her. And every time someone mentioned her, you had that look in your eyes. You…”
Tony’s mouth traced the line of Steve’s throat, while one hand finally managed to wheedle under the pajama top, stroking all the way along Steve’s ridiculously toned back. On his way down, he settled his fingers on the waistband of his pants, dipping inside a little, caressing the curve of Steve’s ass before retreating again.
“Yeah, we kinda can’t,” Clint drawled, though it was clear just how much out of breath he truly was.
“Of course I do!” Tony thumped a fist against the wall behind him. “I just… I can’t go back. I can’t go through all of that again. And it won’t change anything, anyway.”
the Wakandan shield after all—“…but I think you should have it, anyway. It’s yours. So… you’d do me a favor to take it back.”
“Alright,” Tony said, smiling at Steve warmly. The guy looked as shaken as Tony had ever seen him, and he knew this wasn’t the time to sulk like a prima donna just because Steve didn’t want to share his feelings. He clapped a friendly hand on his shoulders, lingering for a second, before he let go again. “Offer stands, and you know where to find me.”
Tony's hand was warm, and the touch was like a shock to Steve's system. It had never felt this way when Tony touched him in the past, but now… He glanced over at the guy, who was still smiling at him with a kind of understanding on his face that Steve hadn't expected from him.
When Steve and the others walked inside, Tony had already assumed a seat in the far back, his back halfway turned to them, leaving them to the larger sofa in the middle. He didn’t even look up when they entered, only rigidly staring down at his tablet with an intense focus that was probably faked.
, I’m sober.” He looked as if he was nearly going to weep at the thought. “Shit. What did you have to sober me up for? Now I’ve got to do it all over again.”
Tony’s eyes were one hundred percent fixed on Steve’s, his hands holding his hips steady while he rolled against him. “Oh, I think you do.”
“Sorry, Steve, that… that is dangerously arrogant,” Rhodey replied. “This is the United Nations we’re talking about. It’s not the world security council, it’s not SHIELD, it’s not HYDRA.”
“My, uh, knees kind of do, though, sorry,” he admitted, even while he entwined their fingers again and pulled Steve’s hand to his lips, kissing its back. He slowly pulled off of Steve, only groaning once when his cock plopped out, leaving him empty. He turned back around while sitting back on his feet and took Steve’s hand in his. The room around them was still quiet, still dark where the light didn’t reach, and maybe he was imagining it, but the air felt a little thinner already.
“Might as well join you,” Tony said, moving to stand with Steve. He trailed after him through the room, picking up his clothes as they went.
A surprised shriek left Tony’s lips as the world suddenly veered off its axis. He was—had Steve just actually picked him up? Tony was hanging in his arms, limp for a long moment, before his hazy mind caught up with what was happening.
“I keep replaying it in my head,” Tony said. “Not just our little stuntshow there, but the whole thing… and I…” He trailed off, then glanced back up at him as well. “Do you think if you and I had ever learned to get along better… If you felt like you could’ve maybe trusted me, that you—”
Steve had been so deeply focused on the two that he hadn’t heard the sound of footsteps behind him, and he wasn’t at all prepared for the vicious kick to his lower back that came just a few seconds later. There was an explosion of pain in his spine, and he hit the pavement on his hands and knees. Before he could recover, another kick landed on the side of his head, pushing him over onto his back.
Even from where Steve stood at the far side of the room, he could see that both Bruce and Tony were definitely nervous and at the same time, they seemed excited. It had been a while since Steve had been around for one of their experiments, and he found himself relax a little. With the entire team standing in a circle around the cradle, it felt like they were at last seeing eye to eye about this. And Steve had a feeling that whatever happened today today would dictate much of their future.
Steve had forgotten to pull the shutters closed. He regretted that only briefly when the light from the window fell on his eyes. He was used to early mornings, and usually didn’t resent a wake up call in the form of sunlight on his face.
Of course, there was every chance he might die today, and if he didn’t—he simply didn’t want to lose anyone else.
, his voice was breaking now, his eyes getting all watery. “But that’s too boring for Tony Stark! Nah, Joe Billionaire here says all you need are some superpowers and a badass attitude, and you can have a place in his private super-gang.”
Tony grinned as he lowered the fork to his plate to scoop up another mouthful. Whatever this was—it was nice, just spending time with Steve as though they were normal. As though they hadn’t tried to kill each other. As though they weren’t so horribly complicated, and the burden of the future didn’t mean every move could change their life forever.
that,” Tony said, a little smug now, moving upwards so the head of Steve’s erection nudged against his opening. “Go on then, before I can change my mind.”
Steve was about to open his mouth at that, planning to tell them exactly what he thought of that nickname. But before he could fully decide what to say without breaking the light mood, there was a low ping from the elevator.
Fury’s jaw tightened. “Alright. I call for further investigations,” he said, looking back at each of them, then at Tony. “I’ll have to consult legal authorities, Mister Stark. Until then, we’ll bring you to our Headquarter.”
Tony raised both hands into the air. “Here’s me, looking at the bigger picture. I say: let’s take our awesome plan and do what we said we’d do. We drive to Hopkinsville, we bask in the magical awesomeness that is the solar eclipse, and then, you can come home, find Carol, and spend the next billion years in bed, for all I care.”
There was a beat of silence. Then, with an angered groan, Tony pressed a hand to his forehead and freed himself from Steve. He walked away, obviously trying to find stability in the middle of all this confusion. After a moment of contemplation, however, he once more walked towards the bottle of whatever alcohol he had been drinking and finished off the remaining quarter in one single chug-a-lug. Then, he flung the bottle away and flopped onto Steve’s sofa. “I’m gonna get some sleep.”
They first came to a stop in front of an elderly man with a pleasant smile, who greeted both Tony and Steve with a firm shake of his hand. He drew Tony into a long hug after, before his eyes settled on Steve.
“Gotcha,” Sam said and through the comm-line, Steve could hear both Bucky and Sam whooping. Natasha smiled widely, slumping against Steve with a relieved chuckle.
They fell silent for a long moment, but Steve knew there was more to come, and he had an inkling feeling that he knew exactly what Bucky would say. So he braced himself with another full spoon of melting chocolate.
“I would agree with you if there weren’t things well beyond human imagination threatening the world. You and I, we both have seen what is out there. We have seen what kinds of evils are waiting to dig their claws into Earth. And as long as we are our only defense system, we
All of the others had left for ‘grocery shopping’, and while Steve suspected that Natasha had something to do with that, he was less annoyed and more grateful that he might get to talk with Tony without an audience.
While the others broke into big smiles, Bucky walked over to bring him some clothes. All the while, Steve’s eyes lingered on Tony, watching how his shoulders were hunched a little, his gaze downcast and his face expressionless.
Sam blinked, only then realizing what Tony was saying. “Well that’s true, in Riley’s case, mine though… okay, wait. Are you saying
Only when he felt Steve’s hand on his thigh, Tony realized he’d been fidgeting and forced himself to stop. He put a hand on top of Steve’s, entwining their fingers and glancing at Steve with a reassuring smile. “‘m good,” he said. The look of concern failed to dissipate from Steve’s eyes; he clearly didn’t believe him. Tony sighed, shrugged. “I’m just… I think I’m finally getting somewhere with the company, you know. At least half of the board listens to me now, the energy projects are well underway, and he stopped nagging about his weapon’s projects all the time and only brings it up a solid… twice a day. Don’t want him looking over my shoulder again all the time. Not that I don’t want to tell him, I really really do, just… Obi’s Obi. Hard to tell how he will react.”
“Please,” he pleaded. By the end of it, Tony’s chest was littered with little bite marks, thin trails of saliva, where Steve’s tongue had made its course.
That wasn't Steve. And as much as it hurt that he had risked his life like that... it was also one of the reasons why Tony loved him. Steve didn't quit. He didn't stop as long as there was still something to fight for. It was what made him a hero. It was part of their lives, and at the end of the day, Tony needed to respect that.
Steve sighed. “You’re right about that one. Come on, we’ll get you to your room, you can sleep it off there.”
“If we don’t do this now,” Tony said, his voice gentle, “it’s going to be done to us later. That’s a fact. And it won’t be pretty.”
At that, Steve’s breath shot from his mouth as he started to come, completely untouched. Tony shut his eyes with how much Steve was squeezing him and jerked forward, thrusting into him hard, feeling Steve quake and tremble beneath him. His lips opened against Steve’s shoulder blade to groan into his skin. Everything stopped for a few perfect little seconds, and then Tony’s orgasm took him as he spilled into Steve, hissing as his body tightened around him further.
“I’m glad you’re with me,” Steve said. He hoped Tony was too cold and sleepy to mock him, and the thought was confirmed when Tony nodded and let Steve tuck him further against his chest.
“He’s here,” Vision replied. “There was someone looking for him, so he went to see what they wanted.”
“In a nutshell, yes,” Tony said. “I know this year has been hard on all of us, but I do believe we can move on from here.” His eyes flickered briefly to Bucky, before they continued with their round towards the rest of the team. “So we’ll make the best of what we have, and once this mess is settled, we’ll all go back to our lives, more or less. I'll leave it to you if you want to return to the tower, or resign from the team, but consider yourself invited.”
“Here we go,” he murmured, hoping Steve wouldn’t hate him for just showing up here, while all of the others were around, too.
A still beat settled between them, Steve’s eyes wide, and Tony used that moment of surprise to finally wrangle his hand free and storm off in the direction of the lab.
“Couldn’t see what was happening,” Bucky whispered after a moment. He blindly flicked Sam off before brushing his thumb tenderly over Natasha’s cheeks where a light cut was already healing.
The sight was… unlike anything Steve had ever encountered, and he felt himself stiffen once more. Once Tony cried out and added to the already cooling come on Steve’s chest, a surprised groan tore through Steve’s throat. He fisted both hands into the bedsheets, bucking up. There was the sound of cloth tearing, and he gasped and twitched and couldn’t believe himself as he came a second time.
“I know you think I’m just some stupid kid, so let me do stupid things! What does it matter—just fuck off and let me
Next to them, Natasha stood up and looked down at the broken debris around them. Both hers and Clint’s face were ashen and smeared with black sludge. “We got to keep moving,” she said worriedly.
“Whoever’s still standing, we gotta move!” someone called, and the voice was near and yet miles away. When Steve blinked, he had moment when he thought Bucky was kneeling right in front of him, shaking him with hands on both of his shoulders, but before he could snap himself back to reality, he was pulled into the vision again.
he thought, feeling a sour tightening in his throat at the mere thought of it. He was glaring at Tony, daring him to say something to rile him up more.
After that, it was mostly routine work. They were able to free Sitwell and the rest of the hostages without any casualties; Natasha retrieved whatever data Fury had told her to retrieve and they vacated the premise without any difficulties.
“Tony, I… Look. I know that we’ve planned this for-fucking-ever. And I know how important it is to you, because it’s exactly that important to me, all right? But… bringing a few more people along won’t make it any less significant. In fact, I’m sure it’ll just make this an all-round more fun experience, with more minds to bear witness of the wonder that is the solar eclipse.”
And then, hell broke loose. Outside, thunderclouds darkened the sky and explosions resounded everywhere, the ground shook, pushing Steve against the railing. Beneath him, Bucky fell on the lower level, taking the rest of the Iron Legion suit with him, and parts of the bridge landed on top them both.
“That’s it,” Steve rasped into his ear. “Give it all to me. All of it.” His thrusts were growing even more frantic, but no less precise. As though releasing to a mixture of relief and anger at once. As though punishing Tony for making him worry so much. Every strangled moan from Tony was answered with a gasp of pleasure, and Tony did not call him on it. It was good. He felt so
“Tony,” Bruce ventured cautiously, as the Iron Man suit bled all over Tony’s body. It hadn’t even been a conscious decision. And yet, within seconds, it had encased him in metal. It cut into the splints around his torso, rendering them useless. A dull pain rolled across his abdomen, but Tony didn’t even flinch.
Alarmed, Steve pulled himself over the edge, but then, there were two large, green hands grabbing for his shoulders and hauling him upwards. Above him, fierce lightning illuminated the sky. It was everywhere, all-consuming and Steve had exactly a second to watch the missile speeding through the sky, before thunder hit it while it was still high up the air. The explosion shook the air, but the detonation held no danger to them here.
They walked past a wall that held three framed photographs. Peggy’s, Howard’s and one of Colonel Phillips.
“Fuck,” Tony ground out as he realized one of Clint’s EMP-arrows had hit his power transmitters. There was still plenty to keep the suit running, though. Shaking off his stupor, Tony saw Vision at the other end of the battlefield, still fighting Wanda, and it didn’t look like either of the two would be getting the upper hand soon.
It took him a moment to raise his eyes from Ian’s sleeping face. “Can this wait? Haven’t seen the little guy in a while.” A while was just a bit over one day, but he couldn’t care less about his clinginess right now.
Steve shook his head, trying to clear it as he wiped a bit of dirt and greenery from his trousers. It was late afternoon and they sat in a clearing inside a small wood next to the hotel. They had discovered the place earlier in the week and now often came here to enjoy the warmth of the day—without anyone bothering them. The grass beneath them was soft and still slightly heated from the sun. Steve had his notebook and a few pencils with him, though the pages were still blank.
Tony made a sound of mild amusement. “Yes, Steve. Though I admit I thought this would be a bit easier. Actually, I thought you were in love with me.”
They held their gazes a moment longer, then Tony nodded and left the room for good. For a long while, Steve just stood there, staring at nothing in particular. He had no idea why Tony looked so
Steve gritted his teeth. The moment of silence lingered, and he thought he might've said too much already, so with the slightest glance at Tony, he took himself out of the workshop and as far away from Tony he could get while not leaving the tower.
"Fine, whatever. But you're going out, anyway." It was final, it seemed. "Tonight's now officially date night. We'll go after dinner."
After he’d passed Albany, he exited the freeway and drove a little through the countryside. When he came by a diner, he decided to grab something to eat and parked his bike. There were only one or two guests, and Steve greeted the young waitress on his way in, keeping the sunglasses on for the time being. People usually respected his privacy, or didn’t recognize him in the first place, but he didn’t want to risk it today.
“Steve.” Bucky’s voice was quiet, and he put a gentle hand on his arm. “You’re both going to be fine.”
Tony couldn’t settle down, couldn’t stop the buzzing that was racing through his bloodstream. A good hour had passed since Ross had announced his arrival and he still hadn’t shown his stupid face. And Tony still stood in the bathroom nearby. He’d spent endless minutes trying to figure out a way how to help Steve without helping him, how to keep him safe without turning everyone else against him, but so far, he’d come up empty.
for beta-reading, and more importantly for listening to me whining for about 4 months straight, and for giving me new ideas and pointers. Also a BIG thank you to
Gently, Steve let his hands wander down Tony’s arms, and Tony felt his own body shudder beneath his fingertips.
There was a moment of contemplation, and when JARVIS spoke up—probably for the last time, Steve realized with a pang of sadness—his voice was very gentle. “It’s a date, sir.”
“You’re starting to sound like ‘Drunk Tony’.” Steve grinned wickedly and kissed him all the same. Tony utilized that advantage and wrapped his thighs around Steve, pulling himself on top, and earning a long-winded groan as he began to rub against Steve.
“Says you,” Tony said. “Dragging in Clint. Dragging Wanda and Pietro from a place they didn’t even want to leave. I’m trying to keep... I’m trying to keep you from tearing the Avengers apart.”
“Don’t be a baby,” he told him. “A couple of months ago, a slime monster dumped a whole church on me and left me there to burn to death; so you can deal with a little antiseptic.”
An eternity later, the door of the car opened. “Get him inside,” someone ordered from afar. “We have basic medical equipment down the stairs, the first door on the left.”
Tony cast him a small smile and even moved a little to give Steve space. “I’m fine,” he said, as Steve settled in. “Sorry for being weird. Just… there’s a lot on my mind.”
He took a deep breath. “The day Tony took us all to the workshop—I chased Dummy until coming across the room nearby. It led straight to the ocean…”
“Steve?” Tony said for the fourth time within the last minute, and his tone was getting more and more urgent. What was going on? One moment, Steve had opened his mouth to say something, and the next, he’d frozen on the spot. He’d stared into the distance, eyes wide, shaky breaths leaving his mouth.
Steve's hand ran idly up and down Tony's back in a slow line. He hummed a no and closed his eyes. Tony's weight was a comforting presence, and he didn't want it to disappear just yet. The way the man's words slurred, his complete limpness, the way he draped over Steve, he just wanted to keep all of that.
The thought of leaving here in the morning, without at least trying to make Steve understand, had Tony’s insides twist and his heart ache. Returning to his regularly scheduled life held little appeal. Not after being so close to Steve.
“I thought if I fooled myself into thinking I didn’t need you, it would become true at some point.” He sighed. “It didn’t. And now…”
A long sigh shuddered through Steve’s body at the contact and Tony sensed the minute that he snapped awake. Felt him recall everything that had occurred. A pained groan left his lips. Then, Tony felt his lashes dance against his skin and the intake of a sharp breath.
“How old-school of you,” Tony mumbled, but unfolded the paper anyway. It was a newspaper article. On top, there was a headline:
“No opposition?” Steve asked, only slightly out of breath as he finally stepped inside the building. The corridors were empty, as far as Steve could see, just brittle cement walls to his left and right.
Tony glanced up and sighed. “Come on, I’m not angry, quit looking at me like I’ll throw him out. I know you can keep Ian safe even if he loses it, but…” He looked at Bucky, his expression a mixture of solemnity and regret. “The risk is too high. We gotta ask Happy to babysit for a while. I can’t… I can’t have you around him.”
He figured Steve hadn’t told Barnes, what with his panic of messing up his future. So Barnes didn’t know about… It. Tony just needed to calm the fuck down.
Steve closed his eyes, reminding his body very sternly that he wasn’t going to throw everything away for quick sex that would be sloppy rather than memorable. He refused for this to be it.
A shudder ran through Tony. He was sort of aware his full weight was slumped on top of Steve, and while he
A shiver raced through Steve, and he cuddled more provocatively into Tony. “Not exactly. But I think you might like it anyway.” He ducked his head conspiratorially, murmuring against Tony’s ear, “It’s a thank you. For everything.”
As he walked down the stairs to the foyer, he was somehow surprised when he first saw Virginia Hogan. She had beautiful red hair and was dressed in fine clothing—but what got to him was her composure. She looked confident and exuded a certain sense of authority. Next to her stood a burly, large man and one that was a little leaner, with dark skin and very kind eyes.
Natasha pressed her lips together and shrugged. “I’m not sure. There have been some rumors that the ATCU got infiltrated by HYDRA as well, but I didn’t have a chance to talk to him so far.”
Bucky snorted, leaning back and taking a large swig. “And there they are. Heart-eyes. God, this is 2019 all over again.”
"This… It's… Is this a cybernetic arm?" Bucky asked, sounding cautiously reserved. Steve knew better, though. Bucky had always been a huge sci-fi geek, and his eyes were getting larger by the second.
“Sokovia,” Tony agreed. “He wanted to make a difference, I suppose. I mean, we won’t know because we dropped a building on him while we were kicking ass.”
A part of him agreed with that assessment, but the other… the larger part… thought about Charles Spencer, and that guy’s daughter, and knew the alternative was something he couldn’t live with any longer.
By now, his mind had sort of caught up with the idea that he’d once more travelled to the future. He’d heard Bruce and Tony talk about time travel before, but it had only been a theory, something they’d joked about, nothing that could actually
,” Natasha interrupted. “There’s always a first step, okay? You just got to breathe…” She pulled one of the chairs around to the head of the kitchen island to sit beside Tony. “Now let’s take a look at that list of yours.”
Right… that’s what it had been hadn’t it? He’d been jealous. He could feel his face flushing a little red.
“Just a little.” Steve let a hand run along Tony’s jaw, his smile widening when Tony leaned into his touch. “You’re the most intimidating person I’ve ever met,” Steve whispered, but though he was quiet, his voice remained sincere. “You still are, to some degree. It took me a while to bring up the nerve to do anything about my feelings. But now, it doesn’t make me nervous anymore. I’m just… happy. You’ve made me happy in way I never thought I’d be.”
The shock at what Tony was saying was akin to getting slapped across the face, and Steve stared at him for one, long, disbelieving moment. He gritted his teeth, his hands clenching to fists still held tightly in his crossed arms to avoid doing anything stupid. It was much harder than he remembered to keep his anger in check.
“Yeah, good luck with that,” Tony shot back challengingly. He really didn’t need to be told twice, and instead just grabbed for Steve’s hand and dragged him into the room.
The Enhanced Citizen Act (a name Tony thought was a bit ridiculous, but everything was better than naming the bill after a destroyed city) was everything the Sokovia Accords hadn’t been.
He’d felt a bit irritated by it, at first, but decided to agree. All of it felt too overwhelming already and Natasha looked to have his best interest at heart, so until he found proof of the contrary, he’d trust her.
When he’d first learned that Steve was married, he’d thought he’d felt envious. Envious about Steve having what he’d never managed to have: a steady relationship, a permanent commitment.
“Oh, I dreamed of you for years, basically my whole youth. But you weren’t like this, not so…” He swallowed, and words seemed to fail him. “You’re different.”
“I’m not making excuses,” Steve said steadily. “You let your fear of losing someone rule you, that’s human. That’s something I can forgive, but… Tony, we need to start talking about these things. You need to let me in on your plans.”
Steve frowned slightly. Did Tony really think they wouldn’t be seeing each other after this? He would be lying if that didn’t sting at least a little. College was a busy time, sure. They’d meet a lot of new people, but of course they’d be seeing each other again. What made Tony think Steve would just drop him because they weren’t on the same school anymore?
And then everything was quiet. He didn’t hear Ross yelling commands anymore, didn’t hear his team talk, didn’t hear anything. The comm was down.
Steve hummed in agreement. He couldn’t even visualize it anymore. That a time existed when they both tried with all their might to hurt each other. Softly, he kissed the corner of Tony’s mouth while Tony sighed with contentment against Steve’s cheek.
There was a long moment of quiet, then, “Also, I want an official thank-you-note for not calling you
All of them SHIELD agents, Steve thought belatedly as he greeted them back. There was already a plate full of food in front of him. Eggs, cheese, ham, bread, and he really guessed he had to be grateful for all of this. Upon awakening, Natasha and that director—Nicholas Fury—had sat down with him and explained very calmly what had happened and where he was. There had been no games, no belittlement of the situation, they’d only told him what was what, and Steve was grateful for that.
Sorry for the long wait. This chap does contain a bit of original TWS dialogue, I hope you don't mind, it's definitely not gonna happen often. Thanks to
Tony stuttered, frowned. He was almost sure it started with B. “Well, he likes to be alone most of the time… you really think I have no friends?”
Staring at the ceiling, Steve let the thoughts come and go as they will. He should call Bucky. It had been too long, and Bucky deserved better from his best friend. Maybe later today, he mused, turning onto his side and watching the light from the digital clock blinking.
"Bucky?" he asked as he approached the step. Bucky smiled at him, but it was an unstable kind of smile, the kind that was a little lopsided, and didn't reach his eyes. Bucky didn't look like he was doing well at all. His hair was longer than Steve remembered, he had deep, dark circles around his eyes and wasn't properly shaved.
God—It was only four years. How had he managed to get there in four short years? Convincing Steve to be with him, to marry him… just…
In the weeks after they met at Bruce's lab, Steve suddenly spotted Tony all over the campus. The guy seemed to be everywhere. For one, the setup of Bruce’s new lab equipment had taken longer than one session, but even outside of the science division, Steve now saw Tony almost every day.
“Tony…” Steve said lowly, not wanting to pressure Ian into anything, but on the next beat, he turned his head sideways, glancing up at Steve as he clearly considered the situation.
"Right, uh, Steve, this is Natasha. Natasha, Steve." Bucky kept the introductions mercifully short, and while Natasha made no move to shake Steve's hand, she did smile at him, so Steve decided to put her on the okay-list and gave her a small smile in return.
Tony shrugged, though he did rub a hand over his forehead as he walked across the room and then back. “Not much in this world surprises me anymore, to be honest. So, what was it: A spell? Fuck, I hate magic
His finger was scrolling through the phone’s menu and before he knew what was happening, Tony had already opened its contacts. There was only one number in there, and Tony rolled his eyes when he saw the name.
“We both know that whether or not we can take Ultron off the Internet, I’m still a liability. You saw it at the party, Extremis is a handicap, and there’s every chance he’ll take me apart as he did with JARVIS. And I couldn’t live with myself if he turned me against you.”
Tony raised a brow when he heard Steve apologize. He looked up and saw the frown on his face. With some awkward shuffling that had Steve chuckle, Tony managed to sit up, scramble for balance on the narrow counter top, and settle down—chest to chest—on Steve’s lap.
announcing their arrival. He held his hand against Steve’s, prompting him to take it, which he did without hesitation. Together, they stepped over the threshold, and into the workshop.
Steve glanced to Tony, who only smiled softly. “Peps has a rather liberal definition of the word ‘insist,’” he replied. “I mentioned we were home, and she announced that she would be stopping by today to size you up.”
Another line appeared on the canvas, and then a rounded shape on one corner, before Steve paused to look at it again. This wasn't going anywhere, figuratively and practically. The lines did nothing to work with one another, it was just raw feeling, and Steve knew he was too scatter-minded to get anything meaningful out of it.
“Well, maybe ‘friends’ is an overstatement. He likes to keep to himself, too, we just meet for coffee sometimes.” He pinched his jaw, which Bruce always did whenever he had some sort of revelation. “This looks good. We might be able to produce about 250 percent more energy, that’s… a real break-through. Thank you, I mean—how did you know?”
“I still can’t believe it. You’re from the future,” he murmured, like he’d been doing for the last half hour straight. “Let’s start with this: When exactly did you learn how to time travel? I mean, I’ve kind of been waiting for you to build a time machine for decades now, but the fact that you’re here and you obviously didn’t bring me with you, you’ll understand I’m a bit bummed.”
“Oh-kay,” Tony stated, flustered for a moment, before his eyes settled back on Steve with an intense sort of heat. “That’s… infinitely hot.”
As his eyes fell on Tony again, he couldn't help that overwhelming surge of affection towards him. He looked so wonderfully ravished, even after they'd had a good night's sleep. He was carrying himself like he was having a constant muscle ache, the kind you get from good exercise. Steve wanted to do so many other things with him.
“Off to the decontamination shower, Cap,” Tony said. JARVIS had already rerouted air circulation within the suit, so it was safe to pull Steve a little closer to his chest so they could actually talk. And with ‘talking’, he meant making sex-pollen jokes.
Steve swallowed hard, reactionary senses on autopilot. He couldn’t trust himself otherwise. “Prove it.”
“Oh, right,” Pepper replied good-naturedly. “Tony mentioned that you were the traveling companion of that horrid person. Justin Hammer, wasn’t it? The guy couldn’t produce a working weapon if we gave him all of our money.”
"Who are you trying to impress?" Steve asked as he let the strange material of Tony's undersuit out of his hands and onto the floor, reaching to stabilize him as he got rid of the pants. The suit was tight and springy, which Steve thought would present an excellent way to keep them off the floor.
And this wasn’t the Steve who had betrayed him, the one who had left him half-dead and freezing in Siberia. Not yet.
So instead of grasping Steve’s hand in his, he stood up. The air between them was dreadfully still, and now that Tony had stepped out of Steve’s reach, he found himself drowning in cold. He had barely dared to hope at all anymore, but now Steve was here, and Tony wouldn’t let that chance go to waste.
The second he came to a halt right next to Tony, Tony all but… dropped. He slumped forward, down on his knees, and the gauntlet that had just been about to shoot a hole through Bucky’s head came to a rest on top of his heart instead. He balled Bucky’s uniform up between his fingers, as he let his head sink.
Ross nodded, and turned the television off. He walked closer towards the table, putting the remote control down with a clicking sound.
Steve reached for his chin, feeling the light stubble beneath his fingertips. “I do. Just takes longer.”
"God, this is good," he breathed, rolling his hips against Steve and pressing broken moans into his neck. His fingers were digging into Steve's shoulder and... this could be enough, would
Tony’s small smile had lasted only a second, but it was definitely there. “Yeah, I know.” He squeezed Steve’s hand firmly, his voice suddenly gruff with emotion. “Love you just as much. And we’ll find a way.”
Steve released him with a wet plop, rubbing his cheek along his length before taking him into his hand again. “Either I’m very good today,” he said with a smug smile. “Or you’ve just not had any in a long time.”
Tearing his gaze from Tony was not an easy task. The guy could come off as sensual beyond measure when he wanted to, but Steve desperately needed to find an available surface for them right now. The training floor was expansive and he felt exposed, no matter the blackout. Look at all that tan skin…
When Bucky lifted his head to speak, Steve saw the marks on his neck, a good few dozen scratch marks from longer fingernails.
, he didn’t have to. Instantaneously, Tony wanted to cradle him in his arms, to shelter him from the harshness of the world, and to remove the terrible look of sadness that was now darkening his features. On the next beat, Steve buried his face in both hands.
“Please don’t freak out,” he mumbled awkwardly, but didn’t give Steve even a second to let those words register, before he pulled back slightly. He cupped Steve’s face, guiding his mouth to Tony’s and pressing their lips together.
“Today’s gonna be packed,” he murmured. Steve’s heart rate seemed mostly back to normal, and he closed his eyes listening to the soft thumps. “Might as well grab breakfast and start early. Have a feeling Jarvis is already on it, either way. He tends to go overboard when I'm away from home that long. Fair warning.”
And just like that, Steve was in control again. In a flash, his insecurity vanished and self-assuredness poured off his body in waves so powerful Tony was amazed he hadn’t yet drowned in it.
They took off as soon as they reached the bridge. Pausing briefly to catch the truck driving in their direction on the street below, Steve readied himself for jumping.
He caressed Tony’s cheek as gently as he could. “What’s going on?” he asked. Clearly, Tony was still linked to Extremis, and that meant Ultron could get to him whenever he wanted, right?
Tony tried to meet his gaze, and when he did, he cast him a small smile. “As you can imagine, we get along better at some point.”
Steve opened his eyes and saw Tony swimming next to him. Feeling as light as he hadn’t in a very long time, Steve grinned again and splashed some water at him.
The man next to him, one of the armed guards, offered a nasty grin, taking a step forward. He leaned down, lips pressing to his ear, just as the familiar pain started to surge through every part of his body, whispering, “Just close your eyes and think of America.”
gotten thinner, and with his almost fully-grown beard, he looked a lot different than the Tony Stark he knew from back home. But he was healthy and in good spirits now that he was able to move again, and in Steve’s book that was all that mattered.
He let both of his hands trail along Steve’s arms, settling them on Steve’s neck, so he could draw him in. “And most importantly, I want to take my time with you, make you enjoy this as much as possible. Let me do that for you?”
Of course he did. Steve always memorized plans with an ease Tony admired. It didn’t make him feel any better. “Good,” he said with a forced smile. “Then walk me through it.”
Before he could truly sink into the feeling of utter failure, however, Nebula suddenly stormed forward and several things happened all at once.
His tone was probably slightly hysterical, but just the thought of facing any of the others right now, and having to engage in serious conversations, was definitely on the more frightening side.
Tony moved, carefully settling on top of Steve, and looking down on him. Steve had half a mind to remind him of his injuries, but Tony was moving without any visible strain, so he kept it to himself.
At some point before dinner, Steve excused himself for a quick shower. The mission had lasted far longer than he’d expected, and he really needed to freshen up a bit.
After yet another morning full of boardroom meetings at the UN, Tony stood in some secluded and far too colorful ‘parent-child room’ that seemed to be in use only by himself these days. It was noon, and he’d just had his last meeting for the day, and could very well be on his way home, if Ian hadn’t decided to make a big fuss before Tony could put him into his stroller.
“I never found out what it was,” he said, his voice soft. “The dreams. The reason we were… together. I did a lot of research, spoke with people I would’ve never spoken with otherwise, and… I still don’t understand it.”
Steve laughed when Bucky pressed a spoon in his hand, before he opened the lid. He knew that JARVIS was thoughtful enough to always stock the fridge full of every possible type of food that anyone could ever want, but ever since Bucky had joined their group about two months ago, there was a new assortment of chocolate that led Steve to believe the AI had caught on to Bucky’s sweet tooth.
"Thanks," Bucky said, and Steve eyed him worriedly. He didn't even sound sarcastic when he said that. He pointed Bucky towards the couch as he went to get the coffee started. Once they were settled with steaming mugs, Steve let himself look at his friend for a long moment. Neither of them spoke, but Bucky gave him a small smile.
A small grumpy yawn left Tony’s lips, but he forced himself awake. Sure enough, his head was craned back in an awkward and entirely painful way. The apartment was still dark, and Steve was kneeling before him, his face illuminated by the dull light of the arc reactor, while he was caressing Tony’s neck in slow strokes. He was wearing gray sweats and a blue t-shirt now, his blonde hair still somewhat damp from the shower. His blue eyes were very large as he looked up at him.
Tony’s jaw tightened as he watched Steve turning around while jogging towards the 50 yards line. He waved at the crowds, his expression as always a bit sheepish. Steve had a hard time dealing with the fame, he’d once told Tony. You could see it in the tensed line of his broad shoulders, and the way his eyes never quite made eye contact whenever he was the center of attention.
Tony could practically hear the exclamation marks as she talked. That they were all expected to be excited about it. And everybody else seemed to be. All of his classmates were happy to escape high school, and embrace the wonder that was university-life.
It was as exhilarating as it was frightening. This new body was very obviously meant to fight, to endure the heaviest strain, the longest exertion. And yet, he was sitting here, in this slightly run-down motel room, doing absolutely nothing.
“No, I can’t! Whatever I say or do… it’s wrong, you see? And if I don’t speak, it’s still wrong. And I can’t talk to you because…” He swallowed hard. If he didn’t do this now, he’d never again have the courage. “Because I
“Yes,” Natasha said. “His son. He funded the expedition, upped the frequency by a good few hundred percents after his father died. Even made some of the flights himself. You’ll meet him, eventually. He’s kind of… a consultant for SHIELD, even if he doesn’t want to admit it. So you’ll run into each other at some point.”
“It’s called making amends,” Strange argued. “I met the Captain, once. And I do believe the two of you can choose a different path if you try.”
,” Steve corrected. “Come on. Let’s take it one step at a time.” He reached out and took his hand, leading Tony towards the elevator. “My next step is getting through this day without breaking a politician’s nose.”
Steve snorted with surprise, before barking out a real laugh. “You’re exaggerating, that was one time.”
Tony quickly sealed the space between them, seizing Steve’s wrists. “Hey, look at me,” he said thickly, raising Steve’s hands to his own face. Steve swallowed hard and obeyed, his gaze locking with Tony’s.
Back then, his mother used to say the mind fought ninety-nine percent of the battle. And up until now, Steve’d thought she was right about that. While he’d often found himself looking at other men,
“What?” Tony asked, voice breaking, suddenly overwhelmed by his own emotions. He was aware that the others were staring at them uncomfortably, but there wasn’t anything to be done about that. “‘Please Tony, let me give my life for this guy?’ Is that what you want my blessing for?”
“Early,” he replied in a clipped tone and folded his suit jacket across one of their lounge chairs. “No need to get up just yet.”
“They’re all looking at us,” Agent Barton muttered. He was an archer and had been working for SHIELD for a long time, if Steve understood correctly.
Ian didn’t seem to care much for the mask on Steve’s face. It didn’t trick him in the slightest, he knew exactly who that person in front of him was. He did look a little confused, though, as his hands settled on Steve’s cheeks, pinching the material.
“Since I started behaving like a Grade A asshole.” Tony smiled kindly. “I tend to get carried away when I want to have something.”
“Liar…” Tony dipped his head. “Come on, shower, then you need your beauty rest. We don’t have to do anything tonight.”
, you scoundrel.” He pulled firmly at Steve’s hand, trying to pull him the last inches to the bedroom door.
Sensing Tony’s attention, Wanda glanced his way, and her expression almost immediately darkened. Tony got where she was coming from—if what Natasha had told him was true, the twins had every right to hate him, whether or not he was responsible for what had happened to their parents. He understood that they had needed someone to blame so they could stay sane in the aftermath of their loss, and he wouldn’t take it away from them.
The height wasn’t completely ideal, but there was no way he’d stop this now. He jerked at the zipper of Steve’s pants, tugging them down over his hips. He nipped at Steve’s lips one last time, before he leaned down. “You want to be here. You want me. And you want me to do this to you,” he said boldly and didn’t miss Steve’s gasp when he slowly drew his head in.
As she walked away slowly, down the middle of the cemetery, Steve hurried to catch up with her. “Sharon,” he prompted. “My sincere condolences.”
The church was three-story high and occupying an entire block. Even now, after years of obvious neglect, Tony could see how impressive it must have been in its day with a sweeping entrance, huge bay windows and elegant columns. Staying in the shadows, Tony circled the area trying to figure out what Ultron was planning. He spotted a couple of his minions roaming the grounds and two more at a smaller back gate.
In any case I invite you all to chat me up on Tumblr and discuss this with me if you feel the need, because I KNOW this is a different approach and one not all of you might like ... and if that's the case I hope you can overlook this part and still enjoy the upcoming Civil War installment. :-) Little Ian will now play a part in this verse, it's one of the few changes I decided to do because... let's be honest: Civil War with a baby? Heartbreaking. (However ... since I got so many asks: I intend for Civil War not to actually break any Stony hearts. It won't be all sunshine and butterflies, of course, but I love them too damn much to really do any permanent damage. If you survived this AoU fic, CW will be bearable, too. Pinky promise.)
Steve held his breath. One of Tony’s knees had found its way between his thighs and his cock was rubbing intimately against Steve’s clothes. His brown eyes were wide with something between anger and lust.
“In the evenings, Jarvis will always call you to discuss the next day’s activities,” Stane announced, halfway turning towards the exit door. “He will be by to show you the mansion shortly. If you need anything in the meantime just ring him on the telephone.”
"You have me," he said, short of breath, right against Tony's shoulder. He licked at the skin and nipped on it, decidedly aiming to leave a mark.
When Steve kneeled on the bed, Tony kissed his cheek reverently. Together, they lay down face to face, and Tony’s heart was aching with how much he wanted this, his whole self wrapped in this moment.
The rhythm Steve set was tender—he couldn’t help it. After the hints Tony had dropped about his first and only time, he couldn’t do rough. Not the first time they did this.
“I’ll grab a few z’s soon,” he said, figuring a ‘No’ would only have Steve furrow his eyebrows in disapproval. He took a long gulp from the beer, closing his eyes for a moment because it was cool and one of the nicer sorts they had in stock upstairs, then pointed the bottle towards the new suit. “The bulb’s layers gave me an idea for a problem I had with the new suit casing, and things kinda went out of hand from there. I tend to zone out sometimes, just means I have to sleep a bit longer later, it’s no big.”
And, the more reasonable part of his brain supplied, they had only spent a few stolen hours together. There was no need for a label just yet.
Huffing, Tony let his hands drop lower, placing them on Steve’s ass and pulling him in. “Do I ever?”
He heard it shatter, and for minutes, he attempted to simply put Steve out of his mind. Forget how he’d once looked at Tony with such patience. How he’d often sat down with him for hours, bickering about music and movies, and television series and trash magazines. How he’d respected him, depended on his opinion, and—
Whatever decision he was approaching vanished on the breath of a hoarse cry, as two red metal hands clutched Bucky around his throat, choking him. At first, Steve didn’t even understand what was happening. And then, his eyes clashed with Iron Man’s.
Steve snorted and followed Tony’s thoughtful gaze. Bucky’s cufflinks were hexagon-shaped, with geometric patterns along the border, and black engravings on its white-golden surface. He remembered vaguely that they’d belonged to Bucky’s grandfather once, and it was almost surreal that Tony had found them in some World War Two museum.
In that moment, Steve glimpsed into the eyes of his own mortality and realized his life might end any second. But right then, he was still alive. He was alive enough to remember, he still was…
are his husband. The Sokovia Accords was one thing, but faced with a simple choice, Steve would always choose you.”
Every other woman would’ve either pulled her hand back so she wouldn’t make him feel awkward, or say something sappy. Natasha, however, leaned in and pressed a kiss against the round metal stump and cast him a smirk. “Kinda miss that guy.”
Tony released a trembling breath and gripped his cock to lessen the strain a bit, before pulling his knees up to give Steve better access.
Now that Steve stood right in front of him. Seeing the truth with his own eyes. Seeing Tony for what he was. In the worst possible moment.
The stars above them fanned out in waves, brilliant against the complete darkness. It was impossible to know where earth and space began or end. It was one fantastic stretch of dark and light, glowing blues and greens.
“I…” Steve said, not knowing what to say, but then, the front door just beneath the living room opened and closed, and Bucky walked into the kitchen.
“No, they’re everywhere—all over the country. I always wanted to go to one, but never really had the chance…” He trailed off, skimming the rest of the pamphlet. He was also almost fully pressed to Tony’s back from head to toe, which yeah…
Steve glanced to Tony quickly, his retort for Bucky immediately replaced with the more urgent question, and both he and Tony turned to her at the same time.
Steve couldn’t believe his own eyes. The room was like a time capsule, preserving life as it had been a year ago, when Indries was still alive.
Steve laughed and handed her staple of platters. “Take that to the table, please. I think we need two more chairs if Maria and Phil are joining us.”
good way. And I… this is enough, don’t get me wrong. At this point, I’m pretty sure everything we do is still a million times better than doing this with anyone else, ...and please know that you can totally say no here... It doesn’t need to be today, of course, or ever, for that matter, I—”
"I only have the one," Bruce said, indicating Tony with a tilt of his head and a smile on his face. "My star student, I must add." He stepped back into the lab, motioning for Steve to follow. "Come on, I don't want to take up too much of your time and this shouldn't be long."
Steve looked as relaxed as he possibly could be while he was reliving moments of a past--but not really past--life, never showing any kind of emotion, only a flutter of eyelids here and there.
“I hope you approve of the new decoration,” Stane went on. “These rooms were never used much before, except for occasional visitors. We were in a bit of a hurry to get everything done.”
Someone was walking along the corridor. That was the first sound Tony heard upon waking up. It was still night, still dark outside. Slowly, Tony raised his head, ignoring the way his muscles ached at the weird position he’d fallen asleep in. He... probably shouldn’t make it a habit to sleep on that armchair. His fingers twitched around the glass he’d been holding, only to find that it had long ago fallen to the floor, the whiskey spilled all over the tiles.
Faintly, Steve heard the others mutter a few words before they finally gave them some space. When Tony pulled back, he stared up into Steve’s eyes with palpable despair. “You gotta go with them,” he whispered.
Steve released several harsh breaths, glancing down at Tony with a frown. “What…” he said slowly, enjoying the view for a few wonderful seconds before he felt Tony’s hand trailing
The only facts he knew were Tony’s first name, that he liked to work with machines, and that he’d once lived somewhere in California. He didn’t know much about this new world, but he knew there would be thousands of Tonys out there.
Tony just stared at Steve, wondering what exactly to say. It was a loaded question at that point, so fucking loaded he didn’t even know where to start. Alcohol tended to make him too talkative, so better to dodge the subject altogether.
Tony frowned down at the floor, still not looking directly at him. His mouth started to shape the word ‘Why?’, then he changed his mind before articulating it and shrugged. “Do whatever you want,” he said curtly. “I’m going to the shop. Suit still needs repairing.”
. But apart from that, and despite everything that had happened, he wanted… he wanted for them to be able to look into each other’s eyes again without flinching.
That being said, Tony wasn’t all that thrilled that Rhodey (who was marginally more hormone-driven at the age of eighteen than he’d been in elementary) apparently wanted to bring his girlfriend and a few more people along.
Steve nodded his head, to show that he'd heard. He had no intention of talking about it, not now or ever, but there was no reason to say so. The thought of wading through those memories again made him feel ill and he gulped around the tension in his throat. He couldn't imagine what Tony's nightmares were about, but if it gave him as much grief as Steve's did, he may not want to talk about it, either.
“You… are?” Tony asked, then back-paddled. “I mean, yeah, it’s good to see you, too, Cap. We thought we’d lost you.”
, Tony thought to himself, and it wasn’t the suffocating and frightening kind of feeling anymore, but a pleasant hum in the back of his mind.
This year's students seemed to be a bit dull up until now, but Steve found it to be both a curse and a blessing. For one, they didn't ask too many questions, so he usually managed to relay all the material in class, which left him with more time to run workshop sessions. So aside from the fact that he sometimes thought he might fall asleep standing, it was pretty good.
“I know.” With a disgusted expression, Tony pulled the tank top off and threw it on the floor, now standing top-less before them—something Steve had
While Steve knew Tony meant every word he said, there was an undertone in his voice. Something dark and pained and… did he think Steve was turning him down?
Steve shook his head. “Don’t say that. You’re a good man,” he said, his fingers dancing across Tony’s cheek.
“There’s this little thing called learning from your mistakes. Since you obviously haven’t taken that step yet, I’m going to have to take it for you: You’re not going without me.”
The words brought warmth to Steve’s heart that was unlike anything he’d felt in a long time. It might not be love what Tony felt, but it was genuine and beyond simple gratitude.
“Morning,” Steve mumbled, moving even closer. A comfortable silence covered them like a blanket. Just being here together, it was enough.
are far more clever than you’re letting on,” Tony said, looking at him fondly. “You’re the most intelligent, empathetic, stubborn man I’ve ever known. One day, you’re going to change the world for the better, I’m sure of it.”
“I think it might be a good idea to let the two of you train separately for a week,” Steve suggested, keeping his tone mild. “Natasha will supervise, give you pointers. Then she’ll team you up with one of the others at a time.”
Eventually, he couldn’t hold his own weight anymore and slumped against Steve’s back. He breathed heavily, body exhausted, as he pressed little kisses against Steve’s neck with reverie.
Tony tugged at Steve’s arm, tasting himself on his lips when they were eye-level again, ignoring the victorious smirk that arose to Steve’s face in turn.
“How long have you wanted this,” he asked, heaving low breaths. “Tell me. How much time did we lose?”
Love. It was such a big word, and yet… for some reason, he knew Tony meant it, he just couldn't say how. They’d barely been doing this for a month, and hadn't even seen each other for most of that time. And yet he felt… a response so powerful to that thought that he was ready to shake Tony awake just to share it with him.
We would also like to thank our readers for all your lovely comments. We were very pleased you enjoyed our protective!Natasha.
Bruce, however, looked exhausted and shaken, staring down at his hands without really doing anything aside from massaging steady circles into the sole of Tony’s naked feet.
He tried to hold on to a guarded optimism, a hope flaring inside him that allowed him to sink further into the belief that maybe the United Nations wouldn’t even consider the Accords. Or that he’d discover a way to circumvent the oncoming rupture between him and Steve with some sort of compromise.
Tony huffed, as if he’d asked himself the same question a million times. Why work on something that was no use to him? Then, a sinful smirk appeared on his lips, and he turned his chair around, settling both hands on Steve’s hip. “I guess you could say I always loved a challenge.”
Tony nodded and pressed a gentle kiss against the intact side of Steve’s face. Then, he made to stand up. He knocked on the door once, not waiting for a reply since he knew there wouldn’t be one, and unlocked it via Extremis. Then, he pushed it open a fraction.
“I know that road,” Tony said, his voice surprised, but laced with something… else. Not quite fear, but very close to it.
“The new equipment is set, I don’t know why he should, exactly,” Bruce said slowly, obviously gauging his words. He was leaning against the wall beside the exit, eyeing Tony with interest. “You really should stop giving him such a hard time, you know? Kids flirting with you is tricky business, Tony. Don’t put him in that spot.”
“Remember how I said nothing could go wrong with a little walk? Forget that. Seriously forget it. And forget about dates, too, we’re fucking horrible at it.”
-wrong, although my dad sure as hell thinks so, but… it just… it doesn’t feel right. I don’t have exactly much experience, and what I have wasn’t… good. And,” he inhaled a low breath, and tried to keep his voice steady. “Sometimes, being normal would’ve been easier. Sometimes, it sure does feel wrong.”
Natasha stopped, but didn’t turn around. “You’re welcome. But I did both of you a favor,” she said, then left.
“But you wouldn’t have agreed on this,” Clint pointed out, raising his hand in defense when Steve glared at him. “Hey, I’m not saying you would’ve been
A muffled sob escaped Tony’s throat when Steve sped up. He was sucking and nibbling at Tony’s neck, pulling the thin skin between his lips to the point of almost-pain. And all Tony could do was turn his head sideways to give Steve better access, fingers taking hold of Steve’s neck and bringing his mouth closer. He loved how Steve took complete control over his body, taking him however he wanted, hurting and soothing, wrecking and mending in any way he pleased.
A cheeky smile crossed Tony’s face, and he brushed a kiss against Steve’s lips. “Did I mention I don’t do bottoming?” he asked, then snorted as Steve’s expression just kind of… fell. He tried not to let it show, but couldn’t hide his obvious surprise.
“Yeah, well, you know how it is. Can’t watch kitten videos on YouTube all the time,” Tony joked then heaved his old man’s body up. For some reason, he suddenly worried that this was yet another pop culture reference Steve wouldn’t get, but his mouth had quirked upwards so Tony figured it was okay.
Tony stared up at Steve with wide eyes; a surprised yelp escaping his lips when Steve suddenly set into motion. For the fraction of a second, he’d thought Steve would push him off and that would be the end of it all. But then, Steve was hovering above him again, face just inches away, and he looked about as unhinged as Tony had ever seen him before.
“You saved my life,” Steve said, coming closer. His gaze still flickered towards the wings, though he very obviously tried not to look at them. “I can’t… grasp it all, yet. I keep replaying every case we had in my head, everything that happened since I’ve met you, but it’s all a mess right now. And yet I know—I
Steve turned around, pleasantly sore from the previous night when Tony had walked into his bedroom just when Steve was about to go to sleep. Every inch of skin was still thrumming and Steve felt a smile on his lips as he turned to look at Tony’s slumbering form.
That broadened Tony’s smile. “It’s a prototype for a… well, an alternative power source. My father used to work on it before he died. It’s not working, though, and it’s not something I can use for my company, anyway.”
Steve could tell Tony was just as unnerved about all of this as Steve himself. This wasn’t normal by any means. Dreaming about the same person was one thing, but having that person remember the dreams in great detail, it was… impossible.
“You want it?” he whispered into his ear, while he made quick work of his tie and dress shirt, throwing both on the floor. As soon as the arc reactor was laid bare, the dark surrounding was cast into a soft, blue light, bathing Steve’s skin with it.
“Well, your choice,” Tony answered matter-of-factly. “Once this dream is over, I’ll already have the next chit at the ready. And there’s always the one after that. That’s the one good thing about being who I am.” He took another, much longer sip, and Steve noticed he didn’t even flinch as he swallowed the alcohol down.
“Are you sure your Steve is even with them right now?” Steve asked. “What if he never got in contact with my team?”
“Well,” Steve said, shaking himself back to the present, trying to make his voice sound as neutral as possible. He would find out what was going on eventually. No secret remained hidden forever. “Let’s find out what the ghost wants.”
. One of those was sweeping at Steve just as he landed from a successful toss of his shield. Luckily, Hawkeye had managed to put an explosive arrow in it before it could tackle him.
“Tony?” Steve called, whirling around in horror. Tony was nowhere to be seen. And the woman, and the guy with black hair were gone as well. “Tony!”
“Because Carol is secretly a nerd,” Tony replied after a moment. “Because she knows the significance of this trip. Because
Tony wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, feeling the warmth move down his throat and into his chest. Great feeling, he thought, and decided to have more right away.
He grinned and reached for one of Tony’s hands. As always, Steve’s skin tingled when their fingers entwined. And again, he wondered how silly he was, for his heart to flutter like a teenager, when in truth, much more than Tony’s hands had touched him. When he knew what it felt like to take him inside. And yet, the heat on his cheeks refused to fade.
Cleanup went quietly between them, and Steve waited out that quiet again. He could tell, from the energy in Tony's movements, his concentrated look, that his mind was racing again. Amazing that it could come back online so soon after orgasm, he thought absently, but didn't say anything in comment. Tony would speak his mind sooner or later. That’s how the guy operated.
“You shut me out,” Ultron roared, throwing Tony off of him, before attacking Vision straight-on. “You think I
“Just… what happened with him, before he died.” His voice was gentle. His eyes flicked to Tony, then settled back on his watch. “How he tried to kill you, how he left you to die, and how you had to kill him. The things he… the way he goaded you into it.”
She cast Rhodey a regretful glance. “And I’m afraid it’s not only a matter of the boat.” There was a significant pause. “We have to follow every lead from here on.”
. With some reluctance, Steve set into motion. Tony had a feeling that right now, Steve would follow him off the edge of the world if he asked it of him.
“FRIDAY, ask Happy to go to our pediatrician, get some homeopathic pain relievers for teething. Make a list of things that help, and order some teething toys while you’re at it.”
“Exactly,” Tony agreed as he raised Ian back to his chest. “And don’t you forget it.” He pressed a kiss on Ian’s nose, rejoicing in the laughter that followed.
Only much later, when they were both lying on the workshop couch, grinning from ear to ear and pressed together from head to toe, Steve took a moment to reflect back on what had happened.
“What time is it?” Steve mumbled as he was roused from sleep. He had a feeling it was only a few hours before dawn. And yet, Tony stood next to the bed, loosening his tie.
Ah, Steve nodded, then nodded some more. He didn’t feel too good about sending his team into situation they might not be ready for yet—after just fighting Thanos, but if there truly was no other choice…
Five minutes and some very endearing deep breaths on Tony’s part later, they said their goodbyes and made their way through the crowd. And within two seconds of getting in the elevator, Tony’s mouth tore at his—both hands fighting his clothing and chucking his tie and dress jacket to the floor without any niceties. Steve moaned into him, guiding him blindly in a clumsy haze for the wall and fending off his attack with one of his own.
Of course, Tony refrained from telling him that his Steve had served him that exact breakfast about a dozens of times already. It was only polite.
Relieved, Steve smiled. Tony was staying. At least for now. He hugged him briefly, not sure where the gesture had come from but rolling with it.
