John stripped off his oatmeal cable-knit sweater and undid his belt. He stepped out of his jeans and paused in front of the mirror. He trailed his fingers over the scar tissue from his bullet wound. It seemed so long ago now. Everything before Sherlock seemed like such a distant memory.
Heat spread downward and John closed his eyes, willing himself not to react to the thought. That would never happen. He wasn’t gay and Sherlock wasn’t… Well, he didn’t know what Sherlock was. Definitely not interested in him. If Sherlock were to be interested in anyone, it would be a sexy, beautiful, intelligent woman, like Irene Adler, or someone who could keep him thoroughly transfixed, like Moriarty. Not someone who wore too many jumpers, woke from nightmares of war, and could barely keep up with him; not someone like John.
A bright blue phone box came into view and Rose went to unlock the door. She held it open and John and The Doctor carried Sherlock in. Almost as soon as he walked through the door, John stumbled and nearly dropped Sherlock in his surprise.
Sherlock’s eyes widened and his mouth parted to say something, but he seemed to change his mind and leaned toward John. His eyes remained open.
His gloved fingers were laced into the chain link fence as he stood waiting. He wasn’t stupid enough to risk a torch, not after the last time, so he put together a map in his head of the direction he would go when the time came. His eyes danced over the towering silhouettes of the junk piles on the other side of the metal fence as he tried to remember which piles he’d searched and which he’d wanted to get a better look at.
Sherlock sighed and dismounted. His erection was prominent and John couldn’t resist running a finger up Sherlock’s long thighs to tease the fabric, tightening it over the plump, damp tip. Pre-come darkened the silky purple fabric.
“We work well together,” Sherlock said, dragging John’s attention away from the green numbers. He was watching John with a curious look that John really couldn’t put his finger on. He would say it was like Sherlock was trying to assure him, but John didn’t know why he would feel the sudden need to.
There were times when John would ask a question and the android seemed unable to answer. Its eyes would brighten as if it were searching for the information to respond, but it simply wasn’t there to respond with. It happened mostly when John asked about Sherlock’s older brother and it frustrated him to no end.
“Rose, close your eyes!” The Doctor said, covering her eyes with his long, bony fingers and quickly turning away to head inside the TARDIS.
John turned to look at his flatmate. "What, is that a bad thing?" he asked, sounding slightly offended.
John closed his eyes, needing a moment to prepare himself before he opened them again. “Sherlock?” he said, barely above a whisper. He reached out and took Sherlock’s wrist in his hand. “It’s fine,” he murmured. “It’s all fine.”
The bot came loose of the pile, as well as the junk above it. John had only a moment to heft the bot into his arms and take off running as the deserted items began to slide down like a tidal wave. The thunderous crash had the lights in the house flicking on and a moment later John heard the telling sound of the door banging open. He spared a glance over his shoulder to see Old Man Crawley standing in his doorway with a double-barrel shotgun held in his arms.
John furrowed his brow at the back of Sherlock’s head of curls. What did that mean? “Have you… you know?” he asked, cheeks blazing.
“Oh, sorry,” Rose apologized. “We’ve got all kinds of different foods in the kitchen, if you two are hungry,” she offered.
He’d been asking the android questions all day about it’s creator. It answered most of his questions, telling John that Sherlock was 16, had black hair, was (obvious, considering the quality of the android’s pieces) rich, hated school, didn’t really have friends, and was a genius.
“I like it,” John admitted as he set his glass down on the rich blue table cloth. Sherlock had been the one to choose the restaurant. John had tried to steer him to a more poor-friendly McDonald’s, but Sherlock had refused and told John that he would pay.
“I’m always careful,” Sherlock replied. Unseen by John, Sherlock quirked his lips into a smile and rounded the corner, directly into another set of lips, which planted themselves rather sloppily across Sherlock’s. The creature they belonged to was kissing him and as it did, Sherlock’s lips began to tingle.
He glared and hurried Redbeard along by his collar before slamming the small door closed again and putting the lock down with a satisfying clack.
John watched as an unabashed smile stretched across Sherlock’s lips and he grinned proudly back. He always felt like he’d done something brilliant when he managed to make Sherlock smile like that.
The android made a rough humming sound like he had rocks in his chest and turned his face away from Sherlock until Sherlock finally finished and closed his chest panel. Then Sherrinford hopped off the table and strode out of the room, slamming the door with a bang behind him.
John watched as Sherlock popped open the androids faceplate and began tinkering around inside. “It must have been damaged in the junkyard,” John supplied.
“I’m telling you that you can,” Sherlock said, turning to face him head on. “I... enjoy your company, John, and there’s plenty to go around.”
John’s foot grazed against Sherrinford’s calf and he froze. Sherlock stilled above him and looked at him, concerned. “All right?” he asked.
The twins chuckled and John’s body filled with warmth at the sound. He turned and watched as they passed through the city on the way to Sherlock’s house. And if he blushed when Sherrinford’s pinky brushed against his as he laid his hand down on the seat, or when Sherlock, seated across from him, bumped his foot against John’s, neither of them noticed.
Sherlock glanced away from John and began toward the refreshments counter. “Love is a very important part of my work,” he explained.
He thumbed the slit of his weeping cock as Sherlock watched, slicking the pre-come around the mushroom head. Sherlock swallowed, his adam’s apple bobbing in his pale throat. There was the ghost of a smile on his cupid’s bow lips.
“The captain goes down with his ship,” he told his first mate, giving him a final salute before closing the door. He raised the jolly roger before settling in for a long night at sea.
Sherlock felt his body jostling as if on waves. In his sleep state, he cracked his eyes to see what, he wasn’t sure. He couldn’t differentiate the night sky from the sea. All he knew was one thing for certain: he saw stars glittering like dust in the air.
After eating a bowl of cereal so big his stomach started to hurt, John’s lesson ensued. Sherlock was actually quite a good teacher when he wasn’t huffing in annoyance because John didn’t know something. He hovered behind John’s shoulder, leaning over him sometimes to correct him. The first lesson consisted of explaining which tools were important for what. Sherlock got out an old android that looked like it had been in a car wreck and demonstrated how to use each, then handed John the tools and let him copy his movements.
John glanced over at Sherlock and the other man groaned and walked away from the mirror. He stopped and stood in the middle of the room beside the center console and stared up at the high ceiling with a look of frustration and intrigue; he seemed not to know where to look.
The android was beautiful. It was clearly male, though the softness of its lips and the angular, yet soft curve of its cheekbones made it appear slightly androgynous. It had sculpted metal curls painted black that revealed a gold shimmer as John shifted to sit back on his heels.
“Any preferences?” John asked as he dropped to his knees to examine the options. He glanced over his shoulder at the frowning faces of his friends with raised brows.
John squeezed his eyes closed as a shuddering sob broke from his throat. He brought up his clean hand and pressed his fingers to his eyelids, willing the tears not to fall. One managed to escape down his cheek. “Stop this pain, Sherlock. Stop me missing you. Come back,” John plead. “Please, just come back.”
It was late by the time they got to Sherlock’s house; the sky was an inky blue. John was wiped out, exhausted from rugby practice that day. All he wanted to do was sleep, but... well, he was in the house of a boy he’d barely known for a few hours and, apparently, he seemed to also have a bit of a crush on the guy.
As they stepped outside, a sleek black car pulled up to the curb. The driver got out and circled around to the back where he opened and held the door wide for them.
“We would need the Blabbersnog’s saliva to develop the antidote. Come on, help me get him up. We need to move him into the TARDIS.”
“How do you know it’s a ‘him’?” she asked, glancing back at the creature to make sure it was still there, but mainly just to hide the colour in her cheeks.
By the time John finally caught up with Sherlock, his calves were burning and his skin was blazing warm from running. He couldn’t feel the cold at all.
The sound of his jeans ripping was followed by a sudden loss of weight. John climbed at top speed up the fence and dropped onto the other side of the fence beside the limp robot. He sucked in gulps of air as he lifted the light weight onto his shoulders and took off running into the night.
“‘Orange’,” John started. He at Sherlock and smiled as he watched the tangerine colour spread across the bridge of Sherlock’s nose. “You heard me and Rose talking, didn’t you?”
“Since your mother died? She must have been dying of something where there was enough time to save her, had she had the right kind of doctor, yes? And now that’s what you want to do, right? Save people by replacing their damaged parts with indestructible ones?”
The bot came to a stop just in front of where John was crouched on the other side of the fence and he watched as the bot’s flickering eyes turned in his direction, scanning the dirt floor. There was the rusted frame of a car in between John and the bot and he watched through the windowless window frame as the bot’s eyes lit up the inside of the car. Its conveyor belt moved it closer to the car and its sensor lights nearly touched John.
Sherrinford’s hand squeezed his thigh gently. “It did turn out well for us the last time,” he supplied.
“Yes,” John said. “My mother could have been saved with a new heart and lungs, but the doctors... it was risky to begin with, she was in such bad condition, but they nicked her heart and she didn’t make it.”
“He was the one person that never looked at me like I was a freak,” Sherlock said, looking into his glass of water. He eventually picked it up and took a drink, then set it back down. “Are you ready to go?” he asked, eyeing John's empty plate.
Sherlock spared the man who’d spoken a glance before grunting and taking the stairs down onto the pavement where he had the vantage point to look down the alley beside the building.
“That text. It was from John again, wasn’t it? Why are you ignoring him?” the android asked. It was looking up from the book in it’s hands, furrowing its mechanical eyebrows pensively, its eyes glowing brightly.
Sherlock got a really pleased expression on his face and left the room in a hurry. “Excellent!” he cried in victory as he went.
It’s a few days later that Lestrade calls with a new case: a woman has been murdered. She was found by her husband, hit over the head by a blunt instrument. The crime scene is only 5 blocks away, so John and Sherlock set off on foot. John suspects it will only take Sherlock moments to solve the case, but Sherlock hasn’t left the house in weeks, so he decides it’s for the best they at least get a little fresh air and exercise. Sherlock goes, surprisingly, without a fight.
“When Rose and I first found him, he was here, and we’ve just run into him here again, so we suspect that, whatever it is he’s looking for, it’s somewhere nearby.” The Doctor drummed his fingers against his lips. “If only we knew what it was!”
Sherlock knew before he even checked the computer that his brother had at least thought to turn the android’s tracker off. He hoped his brother hadn’t damaged the android too badly in the process.
John frowned, suspecting it was a lie, but he nodded, because clearly Sherlock needed him to go along with it. “Alright,” he said, standing up with Sherrinford. “Well, call when you’re free, yeah?”
“I told you, Sherlock. I’m not scared of you,” John told him, his heart thumping wildly as Sherlock studied him closely, portraying no more emotion than that. He’s gotten better at it recently, but it’s not enough to deter John. He knows, can tell by the way Sherlock still breathes slowly but surely between them.
“Was that John again?” Sherrinford asked, scanning through another book, then shoving it back into place in the packed bookcase.
Sherlock stuck his tongue out at the door and crossed his arms. He didn’t want her food, anyways. Food was rubbish. Eating was boring.
Sherlock released him and John ran at full speed. He tackled a serial killer to the ground and they skidded a few feet across the pavement until they lost momentum. Sherlock laughed giddily, towering above them with a grin on his face. “That was spectacular, John!"
“Sherrinford, what are you doing?” John said, hurrying to keep up with Sherrinford’s longer strides.
He knew he shouldn’t risk his dad finding him still awake, but he was too excited to wait until morning, so he laid the android out on the floor, then shut the blinds and stuffed a towel along the bottom of his bedroom door to prevent the light from peeking out underneath. His knees popped as he crouched once again, dropping down beside his latest find.
John laughed. He rolled onto his side to release the pressure on his erection and faced a sleeping Sherrinford. He reached out and held onto the android’s cold fingers and John felt Sherlock’s fingers curl gently around his elbow. Sherlock’s breathing slowed fairly quickly, warm against the back of John’s neck, and John soon followed him and Sherrinford into unconsciousness with a pleasant thrum of warmth pulsing in his chest.
John made the decision to slice through the food with his spoon and brought it to his lips. He sniffed at it before hesitantly sticking his tongue out and tasting it. It was flavourless.
“I’m what?” Sherlock said confusedly, thinking he’d heard his friend wrong. His ears were ringing, after all. Suddenly his arm went out from under him and he fell forward onto the pavement. He turned a rich shade green the moment he hit the ground.
He used the pre-come to slick up his cock and started working Sherlock, matching the pace of his hand to his thrusts.
Sherlock was standing at the window, peering out at the city under the moonlight when John walked in. He crossed the room to stand behind him and wrapped his arms around him, pressing his lips to the back of Sherlock’s neck.
Sherlock’s tummy gave yet another defiant growl and he lowered his book to eye the candy wrapper discarded on the floor, the chocolate licked clean off of the white inside. It had been the only thing left in the hull after several days of quiet repose in the ship previous. He’d been meaning to restock his stores and regretted it now as he thought of the meatloaf his mother had made. It was a favorite of his and he’d been looking forward to it ever since he’d seen her bustle in the ingredients from the shops.
John knew exactly what he was doing. He was denying the truth of the matter, but he was growing quite used to that by now. After all, since Sherlock’s death, somehow his limp had come back. Worse than before, this time. He struggled to get out of bed like a man twice his age. Then again, the drinking probably didn’t help.
Sherlock nodded. “Goodbye, John,” he said, then he turned and whirled out the door with a swoosh of his coat.
“John?” Sherlock murmured, his warm breath gusting against John’s ear. John couldn't stop the shiver that wracked his body.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Maybe you missed him while you were performing fellatio on your fingers,” Sherlock murmured back.
The way the robot described Sherlock, the teen sounded like an intelligent arse, and John had a feeling that the boy would be disappointed by him once he finally found him. The thought upset John, though he couldn’t exactly explain why. For some reason, he wanted the boy to like him. From what John had heard, the human Sherlock wasn’t afraid to speak his mind, and John liked that.
John stared through the door for a moment before he slid onto the back seat. “God,” John said once Sherlock and Sherrinford joined him in the backseat. “I should have known you’d have a driver.”
The boy clutched one strap of his backpack while his other hand was tucked into one of his jacket pockets. The sunlight glinted off his short straw-colored hair, making it glow like a halo. His gaze was set straight ahead as he walked the pavement leading off of the school grounds, his posture straight and shoulders back.
It was nice, preparing dinner with Sherlock. Though they’d never cooked together like this, they had a good understanding of how the other worked, so when one went one way, the other went the opposite way. Not a single elbow was jostled until they were standing side-by-side watching the minutes tick down to meal time.
“It’s like the guy’s a government agent or something," John groaned. "Is he a spy?” he asked excitedly.
The truth was that he found himself jealous when he watched John touching Sherrinford, John laughing because of Sherrinford, John simply smiling because of Sherrinford. He wanted John all to himself. It would be different if Sherrinford was like he was meant to be. That way there was no way John liked him any more than he did Sherlock.
John licked his lips as he convinced himself that Mrs. Hudson was wrong. This wasn’t a date. This probably had something to do with the bloody experiment. “So, what’s for dinner?” John asked with a hint of disappointment, but he was also a bit pleased, because any experiment that had Sherlock cooking dinner was a good experiment. Actually, that wasn’t quite true, but if Mrs. Hudson thought the ingredients were acceptable enough to pick up, John would at least give the meal a taste.
“Mycroft had threatened Sherlock on many occasions to throw me away. It appears he has finally followed through.”
“Sherlock!” he heard his mother shout in warning while Sherlock stared after the android in shock. He tented his fingers and pressed them to his lips. Alright, so he was being cruel, but he had good reason. Well, at least he told himself that. He had experiments to do, information to uncover, and he couldn’t do that if he was spending time with John.
John stripped off his clothes and stepped into the trousers. He was pleased to find that they fit, and they fit well. They hugged his arse and somehow managed to make his legs look longer than they actually were. He pulled on a black shirt and buttoned it up to the neck, then he opened the drawer Sherlock had arranged his ties in and grabbed out a simple black one to go with it. By the time he got downstairs, Sherlock was standing by the door typing away at his phone. He looked up when a stair creaked beneath John’s foot and his eyes scanned down his body, then back up to meet his eyes. “It’s about time. The concert starts at 8 o’clock, John. Come along!”
“You wouldn’t have come if you didn’t need to,” John told him, his voice wavering. He tilted his head back, baring his neck for Sherlock. “Drink, Sherlock. Please.” He blinked his eyes several times, feeling the sharp prickle of tears forming. He’d thought he had come to grips with it, but if he was honest with himself, he knew that would never happen. He was done for the first time they met. “I need you to drink.”
John steps quickly away when he can, pulling his hand back with an apology. He glances over at Sherlock, ready to share a laugh, only to see the other man purse his lips and look away. Sherlock tucks his hands into his great coat pockets and that is the end of that.
“I mean, because the other version of you two, the ones from the books, people have always wondered.”
With the help of the fire alarm and a bucketful of buttery popcorn dumped over the man’s head, they got their murderer. Sherlock and John leaned against the wall outside the theater as the police apprehended the criminal.
“The android. It’s a machine, like you said, it doesn’t have gender, but you keep calling it ‘him’.”
“I love you,” John told him. While Sherlock had been “dead”, John had spent a lot of time thinking about the other man. Hurting from losing him. Aching for him. And he realized that it had to be love.
"Yes, well, you were taking too long to get home," Sherlock said, not even bothering to look away from whatever had caught his interest through the microscope lenses.
They struggled to collect themselves for a moment, coming down together from their highs, then John pushed himself up off the bed and went to the bathroom. Sherlock lay there waiting, but John never came back.
“I better be the only one you’ll be kissing,” John said, and his smile got even bigger as Sherlock’s cheeks glowed a yellowish-orange and he looked away bashfully.
“His wife died from a brain aneurysm. No more than a week later, he was dead. My mother says he died of heartbreak. My father said it was a suicide.”
A knock on the door made him press more fully against it, his body a barricade against the forces of ultimate evil. “Go away!” he shouted, his small voice sounding like a shrill wail.
John dragged his fingers lightly down passed his belly, pausing only once he reached the waistband of his boxers. His cock already strained at the fabric, just from Sherlock’s eyes being on him. He gripped himself, pre-come dampening the front of his pants. He eased the boxers down and left them in a pool on the floor as he turned around to face Sherlock.
“It’s alright,” John said, eyeing Sherrinford with concern. He reached up and smoothed his hand over the android’s cheek. He guided the android in for a gentler kiss and Sherrinford made a pleasant humming sound against John’s lips.
“More often than not. Dad works until 10 and Harry’s usually at Clara’s. Want something to eat?” he asked, headed for the kitchen.
John looks back at their hands and slips his out from underneath Sherlock’s. He tucks them into his jacket pockets, then turns to look out the window. His heart is racing a mile a minute as he tries to focus his sight on the passing scenery outside, but the reflection of Sherlock still looking at him seems to fill up all his vision. John closes his eyes and rests his head against the glass and tries not to think of how soft Sherlock’s hands are. It isn’t until later that he realizes that Sherlock hadn’t been wearing gloves and he tries to convince himself that Sherlock was just trying to warm those long fingers of his. Even later still, upon catching a glimpse of that blood red folder of Sherlock's, John realizes his stupidity at hoping it was something other than an experiment.
"You were right. The body was found in Regents Park. Will you come?" said the first text. "His hair has recently been dyed blue and he has new piercings on his face and ears. Wife not aware. Weird. Are you coming Sherlock?" read the second. "Please message if not coming," said the last one. John glanced up at Sherlock and saw a big smile on his friend's face. "Interested, then?"
“Are you always alone here?” Sherlock asked when John told them no one was there. He saw two sets of keys in the dish beside the front door; John's and presumably his sister Harry's, since there was a sparkly, silver letter 'H' hanging off one of the key rings.
John’s eyebrows went up and he looked down at Sherlock, whose breathing was rather shallow. “Is he dying?” he asked, his voice cracking slightly.
“Oh!” The android’s eyes flared silvery blue, then his hand warmed in John’s hold until it was just a little warmer than the human’s; room temperature. “I was saving energy,” Sherrinford explained.
The Doctor stared at Sherlock’s hand for a moment with his bottom lip pursed. “I… really don’t know,” he admitted. “I imagine they’re a bit like a mood ring. I’m sure I’ve probably got some information around here somewhere, probably in the ‘B’ section of the library.”
John looked up at Sherlock and realized just how close they were standing to each other. Fingers touched the back of his hand and they were cold. He glancee back and Sherrinford smiled down at him. “You can sleep in my bed this time,” he said, looking pleased. His fingers grew warm against John's skin.
Sherlock’s eyes flitted down to the cover of the folder in his hands. “If I told you, it may ruin the whole experiment,” Sherlock said. “The reason I am telling you is because you told me that I had to ask you permission before I did any sort of experiments on you.”
“Yes, we are,” Sherrinford inserted quickly. He offered his hand and Mary shook it, looking a bit starstruck. “Nice to meet you, Mary. Now we’ll be off,” he said, slipping his arm through John’s and steering him away, much to the chagrin of Mary, who looked after them frowning.
The first thing John noticed was that it wasn't just a robot, but an android. It was clear to him that the bot he’d unburied was expensive. He had never seen one like it before with metal almost like porcelain and pieces so delicately shaped the planes of its metal looked nearly human. If John didn’t know better, the android could have passed as a person resting on his bedroom floor, lips slightly parted as if to breathe and all. The only thing that was missing was a heartbeat.
Sherlock froze on the doorstep. Huh. He hadn’t thought this far. He stood awkwardly on the front porch for a few seconds before he decided to circle around the house to find a window. The shades were drawn over the living room window, so he went around to the back of the house, where there was a higher window that he was just shy of being able to reach.
“Hello Sherlock,” the android said in a voice that was a low rumble, its eyelids flickering open to reveal the silver lights underneath. The dirt caking its eyelids forced the robot to close its eyes again and John powered it down. He pressed his ear to the door before he darted across the hallway to fill a cup with water and grab a towel before racing back on quiet feet. He sunk to the floor beside the android and John went to work cleaning it off the best he could.
Sherlock pointed to the bed. “The pillows. There are two, one on each side of the bed, both clearly slept on.”
Sherlock’s eyes met John’s and quickly dropped to his lips. He shifted forward and quickly placed his lips on John’s.
John frowned questioningly over Sherlock’s shoulder at it and his eyes landed on the blue raspberry and green apple-flavoured tubes of lube he’d seen in Sherlock’s bedside drawer. This only made him frown more.
Sherlock replied by turning onto his side, facing away from John. He frowned, exasperated. Sherrinford’s hand sought John’s under the blanket and John turned to face the android, who was smiling.
“John?” Sherlock blinked slowly up at him. His eyebrows furrowed as he raised his eyes to the tall ceiling above him. “Where are we?”
“Mrs. Hudson took them. Apparently they’re making candles at her crafts club and it was her job to pick up the supplies this time and you said she could use them,” Sherlock grumbled in frustration.
Needless to say, when John walked out of his bedroom, he found two very different expressions looking back at him. On Sherrinford, there was a beaming, pleased smile. On Sherlock, he could have sworn he saw fear edging in around the mask of calm Sherlock wore on his face.
"You’re confused," Sherlock explained. "You’re sexually attracted to me, a male, and an android that is also, technically, male.”
Sherlock thought about it for a moment. “Of course,” he said, because in all honesty, he’d feel weird without him there. He and Sherrinford did everything together, it only made sense that that included this.
Sherlock tucked his forehead against John’s chest and they lay like that, Sherlock shivering like he was cold, until eventually he stilled and Sherlock began breathing the rhythmic breaths of the sleeping. John leaned back and looked down at Sherlock’s dark curls. A smile crossed his face and he brushed Sherlock’s hair out of his face.
John ate the mirror piece and his face scrunched up as the sweet tang burst on his tongue. “I’m not a big fan of sweets,” he said.
John's eyebrows furrowed and he slowly hanged his coat. "Um... why?" he asked, bracing his hands on the wall to toe off his shoes.
John chewed his food quietly as Sherlock and Sherlock sat watching him. He took a sip of water and cleared his throat, feeling awkward, and continued eating his spaghetti. He’d been hungrier than he’d thought and had ordered the first thing off the menu with lots of delicious garlic bread. After too long of being watched without a word being spoken, John set down his fork and swiped a napkin at the corners of his lips before dropping the cloth on the table.
"Hmm?" John replied as he paused inside to pull off his coat. The chill of the cold outside lingered in its fabric and made him shiver.
Sherlock and Sherrinford stood side-by-side and watched as John walked down the hall, admiring the boy’s strong shoulders and the way his arse looked in his light denim jeans. When John finally disappeared into the bathroom, the android and human glanced at each other and chuckled softly.
He had not felt so annoyed, and at the same time powerless for a long time, as at the moment when he was walking next to his brother along the corridor in one of the secret government building. They walked in silence, but he could easily guess Mycroft's thoughts. He saw the worry, care, and doubt on his face. Every time his brother gave him a look, Sherlock turned his head. He wasn't sure if he was annoyed by the current situation, or maybe he had already accepted the idea that every time he was ready to confess his love to John, something unexpected had to happen. Something that will change his plans and force him to deal with completely different matters. And he was so close. That evening, when he saw his friend's face, he knew that something had thwarted his plans this time. Actually - someone. He looked at Mycroft again. The helplessness he felt completely took away his urge to discuss. His only hope was that the situation would not turn out to be as hopeless as he thought. But, when he looked at his brother's frown and his cogitative eyes, he knew that his hopes were vain. For some time he will not be able to experience a happy life in John's arms.
"I do not mind. I am glad I can count on you, Francesca" Mycroft bowed slightly and putting his hand on John's lower back, led him gently into her arms. Francesca grabbed John by the elbow and clung to his arm. She felt completely comfortable.
"Do you know, at least, why are you sorry? If your intentions are not honest, then forget about it ...". John did not change position, but Mycroft knew he was waiting for this conversation as much as he was.
They got out of the winding and narrow streets. They passed lively bars and clubs. They heard the splashing of water, and whistling of gondoliers passing by and loud and cheerful groups of tourists. From the windows of private apartments came the voices of the angry residents who were trying to fall asleep. The Holmes Brothers with John and Molly made their way through the main channel beyond the western part of the city. The night was young, and Sherlock still had to tell them about the case of the second serial killer. They were going to the next crime scene. On the way, they passed the famous 'Ponte delle Tette' bridge. When Molly heard the story of where the unusual name came from and what it meant, she blushed and fell silent for a few minutes.
He sniffed and paused for a moment to shield his neck from the wind and to rub his leg. He was surprised that he was still able to function despite such an intense day. But he felt that his body was crying out for rest with every passing moment. He put the lantern down on the street and rubbed his tired face. He frowned because he felt that he was missing something under his fingers, but a moment later a small smile appeared on his face. He wondered if his decision had been too hasty. The lack of a moustache completely changed his appearance. He was sure of that. However, weren't his actions too impulsive? Why was he so eager to win Holmes's admiration? And what will the detective think about such a change? Will he consider him a desperate loner or will he praise him for his new appearance? Ha! He already knew the answer. He smiled and laughed softly. He also thought of himself that way when he looked in the mirror in his bathroom. Holmes will surely guess why he got rid of his moustache in the first place ... A chill ran down his back as he bent down for the lantern. He started walking, but much slower than before. He sharpened his hearing. His muscles tightened.
Store shelves were full of unnecessary things. Even so, John spent long minutes carefully examining each thing. Standing near the cash register, he realized that he probably didn't have enough money, so he gave up half of the things. He was in the middle of putting them back when he heard his phone ringing. He answered after he was sure that it was his landlady who was trying to contact him.
She did so. She grabbed the long dress in her hand and slowly turned around. She leaned against the wall and bent her knee.
"I'm not hungry, but you need something to eat, for sure," John said from the other room. He was in the middle of removing his shirt when he saw Mycroft leaning against the door frame from the corner of his eye. He stood with his arms crossed and was looking at him intently. There was something awkward in his behavior, so John cleared his throat and turned to face the wardrobe.
"Alright! Enough! ... God, Sherlock ... Save me your analysis. I feel like soaking my legs and I will do it ... Could you, for a moment, stop looking at this city from your point of view and see it with my eyes? "
John met various people in his life - scammers, two-faced people, people without empathy. He had an ambivalent attitude towards them. Some of them irritated him, so he avoided them and the problem was solved. But there were people John was sick at the thought of meeting with. He felt cold sweat and chills. It was true, he was able to control his emotions and successfully confront these people. But it was different this time. Stoner was the only person he couldn't handle. Aaron enjoyed it when he saw his confusion and impatience. It was like he was living to torment others. He fought with people who resisted him. Fight and confrontation pleased him. He didn't let go even when he saw his victim was not on his intellectual level or was not interested in continuing to play the game. He liked to torment others in a very subtle way and at the same time, he did not reveal the goal he wanted to achieve. Aaron Stoner was a cunning, mysterious man. John was not surprised he chose someone as Mycroft as his opponent. He was a perfect player, but the icing on the cake was his behavior. That warm hand that held John's fingers firmly. A penetrating gaze of beautiful eyes. Provocative smile. A proud attitude. And this total silence when Aaron looked at him. His eyes said - everything is clear. I have won.
"Tell me, Watson. What is with these ..." Lestrade asked, pointing his finger at the space between his nose and upper lip. "You've never had worn a moustache before."
He cleared his throat softly, drawing her attention. "Thank you for your help ... and sorry for Holmes's behaviour."
"Where are we going? Here?" Molly asked, pointing her finger at the large dome building. She stayed close to Sherlock, who nodded and led her ahead. John stayed behind to avoid Sherlock's prying eyes. Of course, his friend never looked at him while they were traveling in a gondola, but for some reason, John knew Sherlock was watching him all this time.
"I'm worried, John ... I'm in this position for the first time. For the first time, I have to rely on someone else but myself."
This time John looked in his direction, and the slightly frowning eyebrows smoothed out. He looked contrite now.
The sight of such a mutilated body was terrifying. How could one person do this to another? The woman had so many injuries it was difficult even to distinguish the features of her face. One cut overlapped two more. Her stomach and chest looked even worse. The hole left by the murderer revealed everything. Breasts dangled on both sides of the table, and her flared legs fully revealed the Ripper's abilities. He had difficulty breathing. Air barely escaped through his hand pressed against his mouth and nose. The leftovers of the breakfast choked in his throat. Fortunately, his oesophagus was squeezed with regret, a sense of helplessness and self-resentment.
John could feel his friend's fingers tightening in his hair. He sucked him, licked him from the base to the tip. He caressed the scrotum carefully and pleased his ears with Sherlock's moans. Eventually, he looked up and saw one of the most beautiful sights in his life.
"So, how was it, John?" she asked. Her eyes were shining and her lips were stretched with a smile. Unfortunately, John was too absorbed in his own thoughts and he didn't hear her question. He looked at Mycroft with a soundless question in his eyes.
"Evening, Mycroft. I thought they locked you up at this meeting and they are keeping you there by force," John said as if nothing had happened between them and returned to fastening his cuffs. He took Mycroft off guard because the genius looked as if he did not know what happened and whether their night act was just a dream.
"I wonder," he started, piercing him with a searching gaze, "how someone like you can have a hard time finding a roommate."
"I saw desperation in your eyes ..." he joked and returned to the bathroom door. "... I'm guessing, you wouldn't decide to throw him out of the room," he added with a smirk. The older man did not answer but smiled at his reflection in the mirror. The very idea that he would stand naked in front of his younger brother made him feel ashamed. He had many complexes. Especially when he compared himself to Sherlock.
He stared at her glazed eyes for a long time, and as he moved towards Holmes, he trembled at the sight of the expression on his face. The detective ignored Lestrade. He was watching them with pursed lips and eyes obscured by the shadow of his top hat. His chest rose and fell rapidly, and his jaw muscles twitched under the pale skin.
Three years ago, having rid Britain of Moriarty’s gang, I hadn’t even imagined the true scale of the worldwide net created by the Professor. It horrified and fascinated me in equal measure, its tentacles spreading through Paris, Rome, Vienna, Istanbul, as far as Calcutta in the east and New York in the west. I would need a coordinated plan to topple that colossus. Each of the hydra’s heads had to be burned off so that they wouldn’t grow again.
“Here you’re cooped up indoors all the time,” I went on. “There you’ll be able to go out and see daylight without being chased by the press. It will be better to get away until this frenzy passes.”
Having settled myself by his side, I circled my arms around him and kissed him behind the ear. Sherlock murmured something unintelligible, stroking my thigh. Slowly, I pulled out of him and entered him again. Next time I rubbed the sensitive, stretched rim of his hole with the head of my prick before plunging in. The moment I was out of him yet again, Sherlock whined. I trailed my hand to his entrance and felt the swollen rim between my thumb and fingers. Sherlock’s blunt nails dug into my thigh. I didn’t make him wait. I pushed in, all the way up to the hilt, and rocked into him, alternating quick, shallow thrusts with deep ones. Sherlock couldn’t contain his moans anymore which only spurred me on. Even if any sounds reached the ground floor, our household were trustworthy people. Palming Sherlock’s bollocks and fondling them, I could feel them tighten. His stiff cock was throbbing and leaking, untouched. I took Sherlock in hand and frigged him, having him at a relaxed pace. My hand, still slick with vaseline, slid along Sherlock’s prick with obscene squelching noises; soon the first droplets of his seed coated my fingers. More and more followed as we both shuddered and I burst inside him. He blabbered in incoherent French whilst I filled him up with my essence and stroked him to completion.
“Oh, very well,” Watson grumbled. The tactic I employed was quite transparent to him, and yet he gave in to my praises. “Not sure that my old uniform will fit as I’ve gained a few pounds, but I can try it on.”
“On Thursday evening last week I was delayed at the store, for there was much to do before Christmas,” she said. “It was already late, and the store was closed. When I was cleaning the lumber room in the gallery, I was surprised to hear noises from the main hall. Curiosity got the better of me, so I went to the balustrade as carefully as possible and peeped down. Below, the new toymaker seemed to be repairing the big clock. Poor fellow, I thought, he has a lot of work too. But then he finished quickly and stepped aside, arms akimbo.
“This morning, having received a telegram from you, sir, I was immensely relieved to hear that you had put that villain behind bars.”
“That will be all,” I said, my voice sounding surprisingly level. “By morning you shall be back in London. For your own and your family’s safety, do not contact Dr. Watson. I shall do that myself. Carry on as you were. Consider this just a dream after a merry Saturday night at the Green Dragon.”
Despite myself I was fidgeting and drumming my fingers upon the rough plastered wall until my agitation grew so great that I could hardly stand still. I paced up and down the room, consumed by obsessive conjectures and losing my grasp on reality. Suddenly a firm hand upon my elbow made me stop in my tracks.
“Doctor Watson,” she exclaimed, panting. “Finally! I’ve found you. It’s Mr. Holmes. He’s been ill for three days!”
Approaching the pair, I slowed my pace and shamelessly stared at Swinsby from across the street. That prompted him to turn his head in my direction. His eyebrow arched, he trailed an appraising look along my body. I winked and smiled, cringing internally. It worked like a charm, though: he abandoned the young corporal at once and walked up to me.
We took our time enjoying our meal and then bought a cottage pie for the next day’s breakfast. Mrs. Hudson’s basket I had brought with us, as it could be conveniently hung on the bicycle handlebar.
“John. John,” he said and touched my face reverently. “How I wish we had met under different circumstances. I don’t want you to ruin your life.”
“I suppose you had a very good reason, Mr. Holmes,” Mrs. Hudson murmured. “Have you seen Dr. Watson yet? No? Then what are you doing here? Go at once! What he’s been through, the poor soul!”
“My answer remains unchanged, Mycroft. I did it while it was necessary but the kind of games you play is not for me,” I said.
There was an edge to his voice: this time he would not allow me to go alone. I did not intend to raise any objections, for John deserved to have a part in the last battle. I shared with him the details of my plan, and we drove to Baker Street, taking due precautions, to prepare.
(1928), Poirot prevents a terminally ill man from framing his rival in love. The man planned to kill himself but make it look like as if his rival killed him and thus have that rival sentenced to death. Sounds a bit like
Back at home he spent the rest of the day in deep meditation with the old black clay pipe between his lips and the Persian slipper at his side. When I retired for the night, I was surprised that he followed me soon after and didn’t stay up as used to be his wont. This was one of the changes in him, seemingly small and insignificant but in actuality of great importance, which made me love him even more. Through such subtle things he showed how he cherished the time we were granted together. Now we both had learned to treasure it, for we had realised that it was as finite as were our very lives.
Watson’s ability to read his Holmes and especially his fascination with Holmes’s eyes were pointed out many times. The Adventure of the Abbey Grange is a fine example of that—one can trace the way Holmes’s moods fluctuate from peaks to pits and back again.
“It was a worthy match, but you’re dying in vain,” Moriarty sneered. “You think you destroyed my organisation? Why, it was just the tip of the ice—”

Mrs. Hudson was angered and appalled too upon our arrival. She served a light meal which I coaxed Holmes to consume as soon as he regained his senses. For the next four days we nursed Holmes back to health in spite of his annoyed protests. Even though the Norwood case proved successful in the end, it frayed his nerves, and I was concerned that he would fall into a black mood. At my request, the whole household trod lightly around him.
“You can have the room upstairs,” I said. “Then my consulting-room will be free for other patients. I’ll sleep here on the couch. As you have observed, I’m not much of a sleeper, so it won’t be an inconvenience.”
I kicked the pile of presents at the foot of the Christmas tree and they scattered about, rattling and ringing. While Saville was confused momentarily by the commotion, Lestrade saw his chance to hit him in the ribs and push him away. Saville bolted off; I darted after him, and Lestrade followed. Finding his way easily in the dark reaches of the store, Saville made abrupt changes of direction, jumped over the furniture, and tried to disappear from sight, but I was always at his heels. Twice he shot over his shoulder indiscriminately, and when that failed to produce results, he turned to aim. That was when I caught up with him, grabbed him by the hand, and twisted it until he let go of the pistol. He began to struggle, but I knocked him out with a left hook.
The house was cosy inside, furnished with utmost care to preserve the traditions of old. At the same time one could trace the Colonel’s refined, demure taste. A room with a spacious four-poster bed had been prepared for Holmes and me. Soon after we settled down there was the gong for dinner.
"What are the chances that we will accomplish this fucking mission?" one of the men finally asked. It was the one Sherlock considered a handyman. His voice spread around the room, drawing the attention of others. They were also curious about the answers.
John turned his head and, saw the reason for the lack of his sleep. Mycroft. The man lay next to him, looking exhausted. His chest slowly lifted and fell. The morning light burst into the room through the thin curtains and lighted Mycroft's calm face. His aquiline nose, short eyelashes, and thinning hair. He looked so calm and John could barely take his eyes off him. The awareness that he lay next to such an influential person was almost beyond his strength. He smiled slightly under his breath and shook his head.
Sherlock looked back, then turned quietly to his landlady. "This is my intention. I will do it if you stop disturbing us." He heard the excitement in her laughter again. He closed the door when she wanted to grab his face to give him courage. He turned to John and was relieved that his friend was more interested in browsing the pile of letters. The last thing he wanted, was for him to know about his intentions. He didn't want his honesty about feelings to look like this - spoken aloud by their landlady. He wanted to tell John in person. Alone. He shook his head because he couldn't believe how much John had changed him. Earlier he couldn't think of such a thing at all. However, he didn't mind at all. If he could initiate an intimate conversation with him about feelings, he decided to take advantage of every opportunity. He slowly approached his friend. He could barely resist the temptation to stand behind his back and hug his face in his silver hair, but it was like that every time he was close to him, so he had already mastered his desires. He stood beside him and pretended that he was also interested in letters.
"Then pizza maybe?" Molly suggested. "I heard, it taste really good only in Italy." She looked at Sherlock and John, who nodded without saying a word. They were really hungry, so they didn't want to discuss it. Only Mycroft refrained from commenting and chose a more elegant dish that suited to the man in his position. It turned out that all dishes were prepared on a regular basis, so the waiting time was as impressive as the prices. However, this did not disturb the mood, because to improve it the waiters offered them several types of wine. Of course, Mycroft was the one who chose because he loved wine and knew which one he should choose.
"Mycroft, what's gotten into you? Did something happen? Just don't tell me, you worried about us because I will start thinking, I finally managed to evoke some emotions in you ..."
Sherlock unintentionally hit his elbow on the back of the chair in a nervous tick, which of course caught the attention of Greg and Mrs. Hudson. He avoided their eyes and barely refrained from grinding his teeth. "Lestrade, if you came to gossip about the situation of John and Mycroft, I advise you to come tomorrow. Mrs. Hudson is going to tell about their warmed up relationship to everyone around anyway, so she will have time." He ignored the landlady's surprised and slightly offended look, who was already getting ready to answer the accusation.
He was awakened by the sound of water coming from behind the closed bathroom door. It was a warm morning, John had no idea what time it was, but he wasn't going to waste more time. He slid off the huge bed very slowly and stretched with a loud grunt, looking out of the open window.
"How can you be sure that this cat belongs to someone?" John cut in. "There are traces of the collar, but he is not wearing it now."
He flinched in surprise as he felt the detective's hands. Exactly as he described it. He was stunned but realized that Mr Holmes had been kind enough to take off his gloves sooner. He could feel the detective's skin on his lips.
He accepted the white gift hesitantly, and when he looked up, he noticed Holmes's seductive wink and his wide smile. The horses snorted and the carriage started to move. Only when the shock was over, after such an open and unambiguous gesture of the detective, he did lower his gaze and looked at the white, soft thing in his hand. It was a gift from his old companions. A handkerchief with his initials that he completely forgot that existed.
"I can see the concentration on your face, Watson. Go on. Which of my statements did you not like?" he asked, abandoning the formal tone.
A soft click told him he was alone. Alone with his reflection in the mirror. He could see his puffy eyes, a pale face, faded hair with single silver streaks. As he undressed, he could not understand what the Holmes brothers saw in him. He was an ordinary person with a traumatic past. How did someone like Mycroft Holmes even notice him? And Sherlock? Yes, he knew how much they owed each other and how much they meant to each other. But how did their friendship develop into something more? How could Sherlock look at that tired face, and yearning for kisses? He didn't understand it, but ... Does everything about love have to be obvious?
"Are you serious?" John asked sincerely surprised and irritated by Mycroft's theatrical ignorance. "You usually know the whole schedule of his day, from the moment he wakes up to the moment he goes to bed. You have your spies everywhere. They probably report you every time when he sneezes. And now you ask me what's happening?" He rubbed his eyes, then clenched his hands in a nervous tick. "He sits in his armchair, doesn't speak and thinks all the time. He murmurs something under his breath. He doesn't answer my questions. He ignores phone calls and everyone around."
"The one where there will be a lot of people nearby. Stoner cares about his privacy. His people will not arouse suspicion, even at this hour, but we can be sure they will be there."
"All right". Mycroft's voice spread across the room. He wasn't mad. He was surprised. As if he didn't believe that someone could do such a thing to him. He got up from the chair and was about to approach the couch when he saw John's figure lighted by light from outside the windows. His husband stood upright and pointed his finger towards the bedroom.
"Could we leave it for later, Sherlock? We both need some sleep ... especially you. Admit it, how many days have you not slept?" John at least had to try to change the subject. He supposed the strange behavior of his friend was caused by a lack of sleep. At least, he hoped, because that would be some sort of explanation for his crazy ideas.
Mycroft nodded but didn't look overly pleased with himself. He did not smile meanly or give him nagging glances. He sat calm and composed. This attitude irritated Stoner even more. He hated losing, especially with someone who showed that the game was not worth the planning and effort. Aaron sighed again. "You should give her a promotion."
John felt slightly embarrassed talking about these things with Mycroft. He avoided his eyes, but the older man's voice caught his attention.
Lestrade stood over the corpse and rubbed his neck. "You're right, Mr Holmes. Perhaps we will ask for your help, Watson."
"About twenty percent" this time the leader's voice was even quieter. Still, he looked at them with his head raised.
"No, not this way, John. We must first get rid of the people who are following us." Sherlock looked discreetly from side to side, still slightly leaning over him, and turned John around. "The man in the red bow tie and the two by the stairs are Stoner's people. They've been watching you closely from the start," he murmured, still close to his friend's face.
expression. The belt in the golden bathrobe was barely hanging on his hips. Water droplets ran down his body, forming a puddle on the floor. "I didn't mean to make you blush," he walked toward the other room, still wiping his wet hair. After a few steps, he paused and turned, a seductively raised corner of his mouth. "Not yet".
That hurts. It burned like hell. Not because John was speaking to him very strongly, nor the way he was looking at him. It had all happened before and it was up to him whether he listened to similar advice from his friend or not. It hurt him the most because John took Mycroft's side. The same Mycroft, he didn't like at first. An old cynic who was in love with his own ego, who took everything that was valuable to him and liked to disgust his favorite things.
"Umm! H-ha!" Mycroft kept fucking him. With his mouth open stuck to his temples, he was losing control more and more. He held him tightly with his arm until he finally groaned loudly. "Aaah!" He shivered and came in John's hole, thrusting his penis a few more times, but this time slower and gentler.
On the first day, John was happy. This was of course due to their return home and the possibility of hugging Mrs. Hudson. He was so excited about his stories that he sat with their landlady until late at night. Sherlock tried to interrupt their discussions about Venice, the romantic meaning of this city and recent events, several times, but Mrs. Hudson did not let him do that. She was very happy to have John next to her. She brewed tea all the time and sent Sherlock upstairs several times when he went down the stairs to the kitchen and when he let her know with a displeased face that he wishes to be with John alone. His friend also didn't seem eager to end the discussion, as if the opportunity to spend time with Mrs. Hudson was the only way to avoid his company and not think about the consequences of his last decisions. Sherlock gave up after one of the attempts and eventually returned to the bed, which for some reason seemed strangely empty to him. This was because he had long dreamed of his relationship with John. Every day he dreamed of waking up at his side. And now his dreams were almost tangible and close to realization.
"As far as I know, both she and her husband will also have to be at this meeting," Mycroft's tone was dispassionate as if he didn't care. John didn't even doubt it. Over the past week, he realized that Sherlock's older brother not only avoided official banquets but actually detested them. If he had the opportunity, he would go somewhere in the room and spend this kind of situation with a laptop in hand.
Sherlock smiled wider. "John, I think you may not have control over his decisions, but you certainly have an influence on his emotions. Greater than you think."
He smiled again. Sherlock loved this view. He also loved the warmth of his body and the fact that they could lie naked and relaxed in their arms. Another noise made John turn his head slightly and look at the open window. Drops of rain began louder and more often hit the windowsill, and dark clouds tightly covered the sky, wrapping everything in the darkness. The wind blew refreshing air into the bedroom. John looked at Sherlock, who was watching him again. "You know ..." he said and leaned on his bent elbow "... I prefer the unpredictable London weather than the Venetian heat." Even if he was waiting for an answer, he would not let him give it or respond to his words. He sighed theatrically and put his forehead on his shoulder. "Damn," he said. "I forgot about the daisy."
John smiled honestly. He left Mycroft and approached Francesca. She was walking toward them with a glass in her hand. John didn't know how it happened, but she looked even more gorgeous than the day before. This time, however, instead of the usual greeting, Francesca handed a glass to her partner, who was holding a little behind her and grabbed John's face with both of her hands, forcing him to lean down. John felt a warm kiss on his cheek. He saw Mycroft out of the corner of his eye. The genius smiled slightly and shook hands with Francesca's partner.
“We’ll order a delivery then. And stay for the night, John. I can’t stand the idea of letting you return to the front lines just yet.”
We lay in a post-coital haze for quite a while, all messy, our limbs entangled. At last, as loath as we were to budge, we had to. I pulled out and flopped down gracelessly beside him. Sherlock wiped us both with an edge of the sheet—I conceded to that since we were too lazy to get up—then he stretched out his long arm and rummaged in the drawer of the bedside table. Having found what he was looking for, he put a cigarette between his lips and lit it. After a few draws he passed the cigarette to me, and we savoured it by turns, puffing out rings of smoke. Momentarily exhausted but not inclined to sleep at all, we exchanged mischievous smiles. Tomorrow we would have to behave again, but for now the rest of the night was ours.
(1961), Poirot is overworked to the point of exhaustion and needs a vacation, just like Holmes does in
He hummed in appreciation when I put my arms around his waist and brought our bodies flush together. My prick pressed between his buttocks, I slid it along the cleft, making him hiss with pleasure. He took my left hand and guided it to his nipple which became instantly erect at the touch. It sent electric charge from my fingertips straight down, through my spinal cord to my bollocks and cock. Leaking for him, I could wait no longer. I slathered my prick and his hole thoroughly and discarded the now empty vaseline tin. Then I wrapped my hand around my prick and inserted the tip into his anus. Slowly, carefully I pushed into his tight hot arse; he moaned and whined under his breath as my cock stretched him. He relished being entered like that—for a moment his knees almost gave way. I supported him, pulling him closer to myself and thrusting in deeper until I filled him completely. Panting, he regained his footing while I reached for his cock. It was rock hard, pulsing and moist with pre-ejaculate. His girth felt thick and heavy in my hand.
”). Also, Holmes already stated once that if anything happened to the person he loved, he would kill the culprit, just as Dr. Sterndale did in DEVI (“
This is the second story written from Holmes’s POV, but unlike BLAN, it doesn’t feel like Holmes at all. While the narrative in BLAN is always strictly to the point of the case (except those 9 times when Holmes mentions Watson, saying how he misses him), LION features a lot of romantic descriptions of nature, florid similes, admiration of a pretty lady… doesn’t it remind you of someone? The very voice of Holmes is off and there are too many inconsistencies:
“Elementary,” Holmes heaved a sigh. “I do impose on you terribly. Taking an unscheduled day off costs you quite a bit: you are clearly working hard to make ends meet. Buying this practice must have required the entirety of your wound compensation.”
“Besides being a ruthless murderer, Saville writes under a nom-de-plume. A multifaceted personality—unusual criminals often are,” Holmes elaborated. “Born of impoverished gentlefolk, he had high hopes for an illustrious military career serving in artillery. Those hopes were cut short by the Siege of Khartoum during the Mahdist war, when he contracted cholera and barely survived. Upon being invalided, he became disillusioned, blaming the Crown for all his woes, and thus joined anarchists. His skills as a mechanic proved especially useful in the preparation of intricate infernal machines.”
So, both the Sleuth and the Doctor read each other easily, and there are always mutual respect and admiration, no matter how many years pass. Relationship goals™, really.
Forgoing preparation was rather extraordinary. We rarely did that. Of us two I was more suitable, since I was the receiving partner more often, and even then we risked it only if John had taken me the previous night.
I thought about how nice it would be to have a country house. Not a big one, just a cottage where Sherlock and I could spend weekends, roam through the glades together away from curious eyes, laze about the house undisturbed by visitors, and be as loud in bed as we wished. As ever, Sherlock seemed to have read easily what was on my mind.
Sherlock Holmes stared at me as if I had two heads. Meanwhile, Martha brought in a tray with two bowls of steaming chicken soup which smelled delicious. Holmes declined his bowl.
This occurrence would have been soon forgotten, had it not been followed by a second strange incident the next afternoon. Having sold my Kensington practice at Holmes’s request several months prior, I had gradually started to miss my profession, so in November I purchased a much smaller practice in Queen Anne Street. Thus I could stay in touch with medicine and be available whenever Holmes needed, since it was but a ten minute cab drive to Baker Street.
Watson does so in many stories, including this one. In LADY in particular, if we take everything Watson tells us at face value, things often just don’t make any sense. Why would Holmes send him to investigate and then follow him to carry out a parallel search? It would be a waste of effort and time, and unlike it was in HOUN, it would accomplish absolutely nothing. But let’s start from the beginning.
In his stories he presents with dramatic flair my ability to tell what’s on his mind. He doesn’t mention, though, that he often reads me as easily. I kissed his shoulder. We had chosen this life for ourselves, sharing dangers being one of the appeals.
For many months the work had been grueling as I was destroying the foundation of Moriarty’s gang brick by brick. The last cornerstone was Jelland, the most ingenious forger in Europe, who managed to run his business in the heart of London, keeping the Yard none the wiser and flooding the City with counterfeit banknotes. Over the previous five years I had cut off other sources of the gang’s financial supply such as the frauds of Baron Maupertius or Milverton’s blackmail schemes, as well as the failed bank robbery John described in ‘The Red-Headed League’. But Jelland was a crucial figure, for Moriarty had made one little slip and through that slip his connection to Jelland could be traced unmistakably.
It is worth mentioning that in actuality Holmes’s trickery wasn’t as successful with me as he had wished and that I saw through his malingering quite soon. But I shall start from the very beginning.
I didn’t enjoy drinking in the slightest. Quite the contrary, my body rebelled against it. But physical indisposition was a passable distraction from the wretched, hateful reality. Eventually the spirit case ran dry, and I continued on drinking my way through anything that contained alcohol. I knew what degradation it would entail. At last I understood my brother, how he felt, having lost his beloved wife and newborn son. Henry’s appalling conduct made perfect sense now. Perhaps he could have pulled himself together and moved on, being reasonable. Only he hadn’t wished to. Neither did I.
“You’re worrying too much about me, Doctor. Please don’t. I am fit as a fiddle,” Holmes said softly.
Holmes gave me a bemused look but didn’t offer any objection. I helped him to climb the stairs; the effort took every ounce of strength he had, and he was visibly in pain again before I settled him into bed. I pulled the blinds down and left him to rest.
The Russian flu was at the time the deadliest flu pandemic in Britain. It was the first truly urban outbreak, gliding from town to town by rail and passing through tightly packed terraces and soot-smeared workshops at speed. It even sent the prime minister Lord Salisbury to his sickbed for over two weeks, and Queen Victoria’s grandson, Prince Albert Victor, the second in line to the throne, to his grave. (
“There’s a place I’ve heard about from a friend,” I said in hushed tones, with a slight nod towards the side street which led to the brothel. “Getting into the trade there would be more comfortable for me. It’s the first time I try doing it.”
Holmes regarded it gracefully, saying that the case was almost solved and I wouldn’t need to worry. Meanwhile, it was clear that the strain was already taking its toll on him. I departed on the 5th of April, ill at ease. Soon my mind was entirely on my patient, and there was no point to wiring Holmes since he would be too busy to reply. Mrs. Saunders required postoperative supervision, so my absence extended for longer than I had initially expected. On the 14th of April all the newspapers hailed Holmes’s triumph. The final link of the chain turned out to be in Lyons, and I sighed with relief, expecting Holmes to be back in London shortly. But by the evening, I received a telegram which read:
As I had predicted, after the events at the Reichenbach Falls Moriarty’s organisation was like an agitated wasps’ nest. Its true scale turned out to be appalling: its tentacles stretched throughout Europe, reaching India and crossing the Atlantic. To my dismay, I realised that it would take me a substantial amount of time to put an end to it, even with the help of Mycroft’s agents. I flung myself into work, for the more effective I could be, the sooner I would be reunited with my John.
“The Professor’s younger brother now slanders Mr. Holmes in every paper,” Mrs. Hudson said with a tired sigh.
“As always, your assistance was invaluable! Don’t argue.” He put up a masterful hand. “We’ve been saving together. There’s much to be done here: plumbing, electricity, a steam bath, what else did we mention? This place shall belong to us both or I won’t have it.”
Besides his mentor Dr. Patrick Heron Watson, ACD had a friend in Southsea, Dr. James Watson, so it’s unsurprising that ‘James’ popped up in his memory instead of ‘John’.
“Keeping bees too,” he mumbled into my neck. “Someday I should like to put my theoretical knowledge into practice.”
supporting the idea that Holmes and Watson retired together, since at Baker Street there could be no tree to observe from the window of Watson’s room, as there was no backyard either. So it might be a hint at their country house rather than the London flat.
“Please excuse my outburst, sir,” she said in her usual staid manner. “But this time I can’t handle him. Given the circumstances, it mustn’t continue. Mr. Holmes was absent from Monday till Wednesday, and when he returned, he looked sickly and worn out. I was about to send for you at once, but he assured me that he was a little indisposed and just needed rest. There was no improvement the next day. He refused any help, and when I went up with a tray of food, he didn’t let me in. This morning he talked to me through a half-opened door, all skin and bone, with those great blazing eyes of his, insisting that he was fine. Fine indeed! I refuse to put up with such nonsense any longer.”
In this story we learn that Holmes came out of retirement to do some work for intelligence. Actually, I think that’s what he had been doing since his moving to Sussex in 1903. Because for a man like him to retire at 49? Considering that his mind “
“I thought I’d gone mad,” John stammered. “I kept seeing you in random passers-by only to find I was mistaken.”
“Attracted to him? I don’t think so. I admired him as my comrade and a man of honour but not in any other sense.”
