“Thank you!” Bay called loudly.

He was spitting the words out rapid-fire now, mesmerizing like a magician setting up a trick. “Clearly not
As Bay limped past a public telephone, it rang. He glanced at it once in surprise but then kept walking, having seen enough crime dramas to realize it was probably meant for a drug dealer or something. He saw a taxi approaching and tried to flag it down—they slowed, saw his collar, and drove on. Another phone rang, this time a payphone inside a fast food place Bay was passing, but it stopped as an employee reached for it.

been planning to do that anyway, his look said, and he started climbing higher.
Oh, only bitter agony shooting through his thigh. “It’s fine.” Magnus shrugged and turned away, as though watching for his transport would make it come faster, and Bay vanished. It was somewhat foolish, here and now, but he had gone without it for so long. A supernatural fantasy, in which he was a werewolf—where did he
was the one who had spoken, as was Magnus. “Sorry,” he added quickly, dropping his gaze. Maybe… maybe his new master wasn’t exactly

The woman snorted. “Well, you know what

at the dragon as he ate. It felt a bit rude, but it allowed him to pretend the voice was just coming from another person, a Man or Elf maybe, someone a little less intimidating.
With the door open the voices were louder, but not what he considered excessive. “Irene’s bought some real clothes for Aquamarine,” he told her conversationally. “I expect he doesn’t like them. Would you like some tea? It’s lovely out here.”
A few moments later he heard footsteps on the other side and straightened up, making sure his collar and tag were displayed. The door opened to reveal a sixtyish woman in a pink dress, wearing an apron with flour smudges on it. She seemed maternal but also lively, like someone’s cool grandma. “Hello, I’m—”

scares you?” She started to crawl under the table.
“How horrible!” Molly exclaimed, kneeling to hug Aquamarine tightly. “Poor thing! You must have been so scared!” Molly was warm and soft, so Aquamarine decided to whimper in agreement and nuzzle against her.
Another Western stomped over authoritatively, while others rushed to examine the bodies. “John, what the h—l?!” he demanded aggressively, and Aquamarine snarled and tried to lunge at him.
Finally he felt he had to leave; he was becoming increasingly nervous about what awaited him beyond the sliding door, imagining his new master to be pacing back and forth in front of it, on the verge of knocking. When Bay slid the door open, however, he saw that Magnus was still seated in his same spot at the table, and he limped back to join him.
His hand had been resting on Nico’s ribs; now he slid it down to his hip then started pushing back up, under his shirt. When his hand touched the boy’s skin, though, Nico jerked back as if burned.
, and for what purpose.
The man chuckled. “Well, I suppose not,” he agreed, surprisingly. “I know Magnus is terrible about maintaining the rules, so we might drop the façade for a bit, perhaps. He’s been looking for you for quite a while this time,” he added, more casually. “Where’ve you been?”
“Oh honestly,” Magnus huffed, then added impatiently, “Bay, I call him Bay, of course.”
“You’re very sure of yourself,” Nico observed, as if this was a flaw, and he feinted with the knife.
“Then

to be a slave, but rather my forensically-minded colleague.” Bay turned to him slowly, trying to decide how serious he was. He feared he was very serious indeed. “On second thought—which I don’t usually bother with, by the way—I see that would not go over well.”
“He’s alright,” Master assured her, transferring control of his collar to Molly. “See if you can clean him up a bit. You didn’t need him for questioning, did you?” he checked with Lestrade.
“Slight change of plans,” Magnus announced, eyes glued to his phone. “There’s been another killing—another suicide, which is really a murder—and Lestrade wants me to come straight to the crime scene.” He looked at Bay. “Are you up for it?”
Lestrade looked over the blood-covered slave and Aquamarine snarled at him ferally. Now was not the time to suggest there might have been anything more going on between himself and the serial killer, he could see that. It would just lead to too many questions.
“None of his other victims were slaves.”

“Easy there,” Ivan told him soothingly, taking the wrist that held the knife. “If you’re going to stab me, do it on purpose, not on accident.” As he scooted closer he let Nico’s wrist go, his arm sliding over Ivan’s shoulder. The boy could easily puncture Ivan’s neck or back, but he had a feeling he wouldn’t. His eyes blazed almost feverishly bright in the faint light, a forbidden curiosity and fear deep within them.
? Western medicine was more advanced that the local version, then, Aquamarine decided, which was not exactly surprising.
“Her case!” Magnus bellowed. “Come on, where is her case? Did she eat it?” he demanded sarcastically. “Someone else was here, and they took her case.” His voice dropped, as if he was just talking to himself. “So the killer must have driven her here, forgot the case was in the car…”
Attempting to follow this advice led Aquamarine to pitch right off the edge of the deck into the yard, but he popped back up right away and started clumping around. “Are you wearing sunscreen?” John asked Irene. Her response seemed to indicate no. “Go put some on if you’re going to stay outside,” he told her, pushing lightly on her back.
“Life can be difficult for a slave if your master neglects you,” the man said, trying for sympathy. They both knew he had absolutely no idea of what it was like to be a slave. “You weren’t born a slave… perhaps one day you’ll be free again.”
reason that made him think of Nico. Of course, what didn’t; he existence was the sole reason Ivan had pushed this far west, trampling all kingdoms that blocked his path. Empires rose and fell, but love was eternal.
seem to be icy; Nico’s nose was cold to the touch. When Ivan seemed to fall back asleep behind him, he allowed himself to do the same.
Bay had been stretching, and marveling at the lessening of the pain he felt while doing so—his leg was still horrible, of course, but other things were much better. Shower, food, and sleep were indeed a potent combination. “Sorry—crime scene?” he said to Magnus in confusion.
Bilbo scooted to the edge of the mattress—it was big enough to hold several of him—and lowered himself onto the small stepstool, then to the stone floor. For once the oversized furniture was not the result of a Hobbit trying to maneuver in a Man-sized world; it had been built for Dwarves, who were not much bigger than Hobbits. But a Dwarven king’s bedchamber still had to be ridiculously grand, as befit his status.
was crouching, so clearly this wasn’t the desired endpoint. Carefully he lowered his legs to the floor, sitting flat on his rear end. Then he winced and Irene burst out laughing, knowing the source of his discomfort, but Master shot her a look and she kept her mouth shut.
“But Jennifer Wilson might not be dead.”
There was a bowl of water on the floor in the corner, and next to it a bowl of dry brown chunks. Convenient, Aquamarine thought, crawling over to investigate. Master snagged his collar. “No, your food is on the table,” he reminded Aquamarine. “Leave that alone.”
“I’m sorry. Please, continue.”
There was a dragon head on the other side of it, his great golden eye as big as Bilbo’s head. It blinked sideways. “Finally!” exclaimed the dragon, his voice deep and rich. “You’re very pokey this morning. I was getting quite bored waiting for you.”
As he finished his piece he was clueless about what to do. Sherlock didn't reacted in any way. He just kept staring straight ahead.
So that probably wasn't it. But then what?
Lestrade couldn't help but feel awed by the soldier. Now he clearly saw that John Watson wasn't average. Hidden under those cozy jumpers and easy smiles was a man who was dangerous. A man who would kill without a second thought if it was needed. Right then that was not John, that was Captain Watson.
Sherlock stepped back murmuring the name to himself.
"Obviously." He said, but his voice lacked of its usual bite. He vanished into his room to get it.
"No." He answered bluntly, keeping his eyes on the street, outside.
As he read the card he completly forgot about the cain, at that Sherlock just smiled smugly.
So that's how the month went by.
"Oh, hi Mycroft." John meowed and was about to say something else but then they heard Sherlock's paws hitting the ground in a hurrid pace.
"No way." He heard Donovan say as she stared at the two in bewilderment.
“John.” He whispered as reassurance.
"How do you know for sure?" John asked, not answering Sherlock's question.
“Well, that could have gone better.” Sherlock looked to his side taking his eyes of John for a moment who was talking to Sarah. The white bandage around his head glowing in the cool London night.
“What-?” He asked. The only thing he could get out in his shock.
Greg frowned at that. "But he sent me a text less than an hour ago, how could he-"
It was a hard week for them. They had barely found a few bites.
be the one to worry about that for a change.
“Her name’s Jennifer Wilson, according to her credit cards,” Lestrade went on. “We’re running them now for contact details. Hasn’t been here long. Some kids found her.”
,” Magnus said indignantly, as Bilbo calmed himself. “I was being very quiet.”
He sensed Nico’s surprise when he actually pulled back, withdrawing to his own side of the bed and putting some breathing room between them. Most people in this world just took what they wanted, commanded and expected it would be done. Nico had been at the mercy of his parents all his life, doing as they ordered; now he was at Ivan’s mercy, technically, but he didn’t have to think of it that way. He didn’t have to be afraid that his will would be overridden—at least, not in this particular instance.
“Oh, about four hours, I think,” Magnus decided. “Sit down. Here. I promised I would get you a drink.”
There was much to attend to in a conquered kingdom. Ivan was not trying to build an empire, but no one needed to know that yet. Settling an unexplored land was satisfying, he felt, but conquering and maintaining an empire was merely a lot of trouble, especially in an age when the king’s physical situation was not too far removed from that of his lowest subjects. Technological innovation seemed a long way off, though, especially in this tradition-bound place. Ivan would be heartily glad to see its backside.
“What if—” Bay began, and Magnus leaned forward eagerly. “What if she was killed by one of her lovers or someone connected to them, or her husband—” From the way Magnus slumped back with a defeated, dramatic sigh, Bay realized he was on the wrong track. “No?” he guessed dryly. “If one
yet. And he wouldn’t make it easy anyway, be
“Sit back down. How do you feel here?” Aquamarine drew a sharp breath at the gentle touch. Partly it was just unexpected. “Still hurts? A lot? Just a little? Good, that’s much better.” There was a light sheen of sweat coating his skin now, and Master rubbed soothingly at the back of his neck and shoulder. “All done now, nothing else to worry about.” Which was hardly true, really. “You can get dressed now.” Aquamarine hurriedly rose and pulled on his two articles of clothing, unsure what he should do next.
“What’s the address?” Bay checked, not wanting to get it wrong.
Well, right now he didn’t. Ivan watched him work in the firelight, his delicate features thrown in high relief. Stepson of the king, so born to his wife from her previous marriage, something dragged along with her, awkward to deal with. Close to the king but with nothing to inherit—he’d save the choicest positions for his own future sons or sons-in-law. And so far the queen had given her current husband only daughters—did that make this boy’s position better or worse? Academic, really, Nico couldn’t found a dynasty of his own, not under this world’s strict rules of biological inheritance.
“Good boy!” she praised, scratching his head. “Now, which bags do I want?”
“Maybe the case is at her hotel?” Lestrade suggested. Pointless, really. “If she’d checked in—“
mad than he’d feared—but if so, that would say something rather unsettling about his own memory.
I be scared?
risk, isn’t it? He’ll be too slow without it. Bay, you can stop walking.”
“And your freedom, too, I’d wager,” Magnus suggested critically. “Did you take it?”
In the room he had lamps casting a warm golden glow over everything. There was an overstuffed chair with an ottoman, right next to the bookcase half-full of books; there was a dresser and a trunk and two nightstands, a full-length looking glass, a huge closet, a writing desk and chair, thick rugs scattered about the floor. For décor he had a king’s ransom of treasures: crystals larger than his hand were lined up across the mantel, his soap dish was gold and encrusted with gems, a silver bowl on the dresser held odd jewels like cat’s-eyes and fire opals, a tapestry of silk and gold hung on the wall.
“Sorry,” he man said, as Bay struggled to lean against the chair. He sounded sincere but not overly distressed. “I needed to make sure you weren’t faking.” Bay gritted his teeth and crawled into the chair, and the man deigned to hand him his cane, evidently not afraid it would be used against him. “This does change things somewhat. Why don’t you remember?”
She gave him a slightly disbelieving smile, like he was being cheeky to expect an answer. He double-checked her throat; definitely a slave collar, twisted gold strands with an oval tag dangling from them, though at this angle he couldn’t read the writing on it. “Anthea,” she finally told him, which might or might not be true. Obviously she knew who
“You have a delightfully dark imagination,” Magnus noted with approval, and Bay reminded himself to keep these extraneous thoughts to himself. His new master obviously had a warped sensibility.
Bilbo took a deep breath, then sagged with relief. Finding no chair nearby he sat down on the stone floor. Sometimes he chided himself, saying he needed to calm down and look at the advantages to his situation; but inevitably another part of him would yell, “But there’s a DRAGON!” and panic seemed the only logical response.
“He’s my step-father—”
“You don’t believe me, do you,” Magnus observed. Bay shook his head slowly. “About any of it.” He shook his head again. He felt like he would be buying into a cult, that he would lose himself completely in the comfort of fantasy. It was
“Of course!” Magnus replied cheerfully. “Well?”
; the next one might be even worse.
“Well, I know who did it.”
Aquamarine turned up his nose at
“Why?” the woman challenged.
“What are we going to do today, Master?” Irene asked eagerly.
Molly appeared from behind the screen, wrapped in a robe; her hair was pinned up and slightly damp—perhaps she’d been bathing. Bathing was permitted, perhaps encouraged—Mrs. Hudson seemed very clean. “It’s alright, Mrs. Hudson, I’ll take him to Master,” she said. “Come on.”
“He’s gone,” said a voice behind him, and Bay turned to see Sergeant Donovan standing there.
“Probably couldn’t pull it off, hmm?” Magnus added, a slight challenge in his tone.
“Donovan!” Lestrade called suddenly from the entrance to the house.
a mistake. Get on to Cardiff—find out who Jennifer Wilson’s family and friends were. Find Rachel!” Then he reached the bottom of the stairs and disappeared.
Irene made sympathetic noises, always with an air of amusement and flirtation behind them. She reached out to touch Aquamarine and he snapped at her, as a warning. She was not offended.
Any amount he’d relaxed, Aquamarine tensed up again. “You might have to sleep on the couch in the living room,” John pressed on helplessly, “or in the tent, in your own room, or mine if you prefer—” He was not really addressing Aquamarine’s concern directly, he could see. Well if the bloody man refused to
Not for this man, though, whose eyes raked assessingly over Bay. It made him feel quite naked, which had ceased long ago to be a good thing. “Why don’t you take a shower,” Magnus finally suggested. “It’s there, across from the loo. The shower doubles as a health scanner, so do that first.”
Aquamarine growled at her, making Mrs. Watson’s eyes go wide. “Stop,” Master ordered evenly, not looking at either of them. Aquamarine sneered silently at her, and Irene made a face back. Molly ruined it by giggling, which drew Master’s attention from his conversation with his mother. “Are you going to get up in the chair or not?” he asked Aquamarine pointedly.
“Do you want to know the truth?” Magnus offered. Bay could see he wanted to tell him. “You won’t believe it.”
she remove her ring for?”
The look he gave her was highly suspicious, and he glanced at John for guidance. With a sigh John just shrugged. “Up to you. You know what she’s like.”
Magnus frowned as if this was a completely bizarre question. “No.”
“Alright, I’ll tell you,” Magnus proposed, again. He paused as if to give Bay time to object, but the slave just looked at him. One of these days he was going to vanish into his mind and never return—maybe that day was coming soon. “You and I are immortal beings of great power, who play out lives over and over in various settings. We have fairly typical childhoods, but then as we become more adult we start to become aware of our powers and memories of previous adventures—and of the pull we feel to find each other. We always want to be together. Oh, and other familiar characters often pop up, like Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson.”
“Her phone, yes,” Bay agreed quickly. “She didn’t leave it at home?” Magnus shook his head quickly. “Perhaps she lost it once she got to London, or it was stolen by someone”—Wrong track again. “—stolen by some unrelated person who found her body first—”
“I was a messenger,” Nico answered. Finally he gripped one of Ivan’s boots and tugged.
“Is that the gate?” he asked, distraction again.
“It’s alright, you’ll be alright soon,” his master assured him. “Molly is very good at this.” His skin stung again but he resisted the instinct to jerk away or kick; his mater noticed. “Good boy, that’s good, you know we’re trying to help.” His master swung off him, the loss of warmth and pressure disorienting, and he settled himself on the floor on his stomach, facing the slave. He continued massaging his head and neck. “What’s your name, then? Come on, you must have a name.”
Aquamarine nodded and leaned his head against John’s thigh, shoulders slumped in defeat. “I know, it’s a big world,” John confirmed in a comforting tone. “Most of it’s
Magnus was obviously frustrated with the speed lesser mortals took to catch up with him. “No, she was leaving an angry note in German,” he snapped, deeply sarcastic. “Of
Magnus lifted the tape for Bay, who ducked under it and followed his master and Sergeant Donovan towards the abandoned house at the center of police activity. Her behavior was what he was used to: very little regard, no direct speech or eye contact, unworthy of a name even. A thing, not a person. He’d probably have gotten more attention from her if he’d been a golden retriever. People at least liked to pat dogs on the head.
“I’m not sleeping in your bed at all!” Nico shot back, as if he was really in control of his own destiny.
It had to be the most slapdash and pathetic collar Bay had ever worn. But hey, it worked, and he looped the tag over the neck band. “Acceptable?” Magnus couldn’t help asking, slightly smug as though he’d done something quite brilliant. He tumbled into the seat beside Bay.
“Go on then, clever boy—“
“Slave, huh?” the man commented, and this time he talking
Molly did not really like thinking about violence and she put her arm around Aquamarine, trying to hold him close. “I’m sure he only did it to protect Master,” she finally suggested. Aquamarine whined in agreement and sniffed at Molly, then turned to check on Irene.
“Fine, then send me one of your pretty little sisters to do the job,” Ivan suggested, reaching down to trace the injury.
“The neighbors might be out—“ his mother worried. She was certain she would never live down the attack on the mailman—normally Taffy just barked at him from inside, but this time
Master’s mother was nervous around them. Aquamarine didn’t think it was
Anthea opened her car door and got his attention. “I’m to take you home,” she announced, and Bay limped over to join her.
Slowly Aquamarine did so, and John let him sit up. “Those clothes do look rather good on you,” he told the slave, then leaned in close to purr in his ear. “I think they’d look better off, though.” Regaining his cheeky attitude somewhat, Aquamarine raised an eyebrow in challenge, evoking the ’no sex’ rule John had just mentioned. “Sleep in the tent,” John decided, “and maybe I’ll come see you tonight. Now pick up your shoes and socks, and go inside.” No doubt Molly and Irene would love to get him cleaned up before teatime.
“D—n,” he muttered, contorting himself trying to see the wound. “Get some water and clean that off.”
“I like his voice,” Irene declared. “It’s deeper than you’d expect, don’t you think?” Molly nodded, blushing a little.
“Couldn’t I just—”
the reminder—
“You were thinking. It’s annoying.” Lestrade glanced at Bay and rolled his eyes a little, as if saying, ‘Can you believe this guy?’ Bay made a noncommittal shrug in return.
“You know the address?” he checked.
In hindsight leaving Aquamarine alone in the tent had probably not been a good idea, John decided. “Aquamarine? Aquamarine!” He knelt in the grass by the slave, who was rocking back and forth erratically, and slipped his jacket around his thin shoulders for warmth. “It’s okay, you’re okay, come here.” He pulled the slave into his arms and Aquamarine clung to him, whimpering. John felt hot tears soaking through his shirt and guilt stabbed at him. “Aquamarine, you’re safe,” he tried to assure him. “Yes, we’re someplace different but you’re safe—“
As they reached the pavement a man wearing coveralls stepped outside, the permanent sneer on his face deepening as he spotted Magnus. He had not made friends for himself on the police force, had he?
Magnus did a double-take, then laughed. Genuine laughter, no undercurrent of menace. “I’ll have your leg fixed up soon, too,” he promised, ridiculously. “Your room’s on the third floor, can’t have you limping up and down the stairs all day. Plus, I need you out with me,” he went on excitedly. “Racing through the streets and alleys of London—oh, I’m a detective, I solve crimes. No committing them this time!” he chuckled madly. “Though of course some people always think I’m on the point of doing so.” He rolled his eyes at this. “Sally, Anderson, Mycroft, Lestrade, all the usual suspects around. But
Irene started to wander away from the Jeep and Aquamarine snarled his disapproval, reaching out to grab her arm. “He wants you to stay here,” Molly interpreted, which was pretty obvious.
“Yet you’re still in a cage,” Sherlock zinged.
countermanding it?”
“Not sure that’s a proper collar,” Sally interrupted, peering at it closely. Her gaze had glanced over his face so quickly, Bay doubted she’d even recognize him later.
“No,” Bay answered. He didn’t get much in the way of current events. It worried him how gleeful his master seemed about this, though.
“Yes, it’s useful,” Bay responded lightly. He glanced around the cabin. “Nice transport.”
another one,” he reminded Magnus. “What are you on about?”
Magnus tipped Bay’s chin up so the slave met his gaze. Surprisingly his eyes were clear and steady. “I will get you a drink, on the transport,” he repeated firmly. “I will make you very comfortable there. Can you trust me?”
On one wall was a massive fireplace, green like all the carved columns holding up the roof. The area before it had been swept clear of flammable treasures, the floor of golden bits stamped relatively flat, and a table and chair set up. Of course they were the most ornate table and chair Bilbo had ever seen, and the large table was laid with a truly Hobbit-sized breakfast, which for once meant
A chill went down Bay’s spine and he immediately dropped the phone and backed hastily out of the booth. He was not getting caught up in some creepy game—suppose that was the killer the police and Magnus were hunting for, who had seen Bay abandoned at the old house? Okay, that was rather fanciful, Bay told himself soothingly as he limped along as fast as he could. Much more likely it was something totally innocent, a phone call meant for someone else, and Bay glanced back, hoping to see a city worker at the phone, helping to resolve some issue with a sticky security camera. But the phone box was empty.
“Perhaps we need to get to know each other better,” Bay suggested pleasantly. “It can be difficult, at first—“
“Asphyxiation, probably,” Bay decided clinically. “Passed out, choked on her own vomit. Can’t smell any alcohol on her. It could have been a seizure, possibly drugs.”
“Honestly?” Magnus nodded, with great interest. “I guess you could be playing a game,” Bay hypothesized slowly. “Pretend you recognized me, just to mess with my head. All that nonsense with your archenemy acting like a cartoon villain—”
It was the most he had yet said to his new master and he was trembling by the end, frustration and rage and fear all mixed together inside him. A mad man who didn’t know the first thing about owning a slave, not even the parts that were beneficial to him, thus forcing Bay to pick up the keys to his own cell and hand them to his jailer—that went beyond mad to sadistic.
Ivan could imagine it would take a while to come to terms with that.
“Alright.” Clothes were little enough protection anyway.
There was a beep and a green light, signaling that they had reached cruising altitude, and Magnus popped up immediately and disappeared through a sliding door. Bay unbuckled himself more slowly, glancing around to see if there was any more he could learn, such as if they were really going to London.
“Yes, that’s right. Your garden is looking lovely,” he redirected. “Are your tomatoes in yet?”
“It might be entertaining,” Bay shrugged. “Rich people get bored.”
“Perhaps the country would rather have their heads on pikes, and write ballads about their brave defiance,” Ivan suggested, watching Nico’s work with interest.
to calm down, didn’t
“Pity, we could have split the fee,” Magnus said seriously. “Think it through next time.” He did at least seem to believe Bay. “He wouldn’t have freed you, you know,” he added more soberly, and Bay nodded along. “Not once he realized—” He tapped his head and Bay somehow knew this referred to his supposed memory loss, or whatever.
“Oh.” No way around that, then.
“Oh.”
After a moment his posture changed subtly and he said dismissively, “Well, I’ve a mess to clean up. Dr. Watson.”
“Yes.”
Magnus’s eyes were shining in a way you really didn’t want to see when kneeling by a corpse. “Murder,” he intoned.
“How long will it take to get to London?” Bay inquired neutrally.
“Let me go,” Nico ordered, slightly breathless, although Ivan wasn’t technically restraining him in any way.
Staring accomplished nothing, Ivan had found. Staring was just two people doing nothing, looking for any sign that the other person was going to do
“Mm-hmm,” Bay replied. “Yes, that all fits together rather well.”
fellow, and he wasn’t a violent person, despite being in the Army. But now he was some kind of conqueror, sweeping across the peaceful kingdoms in his path like a farmer scything wheat, turning his back on his rapacious followers and facing ever forward, to the next land. He was searching for something, something he was desperate to possess, and he knew he was getting closer to it, and that proximity spurred him on, lashing his horse to slog through the mud, over the mountains that they said could never be breached, across the mighty rivers. He had never felt so driven and single-minded before, and there was an exhilarating clarity to it, a simplicity. He knew, vaguely, that his men admired him for it, admired him even as they feared him, even as they wondered how he could reject the generous offers of settlement that came his way, how he could face the mightiest armies without hesitation. And then, in a drafty medieval castle, once the property of a now-cowering king, he found—people whispered about a boy, well, a teenager, adult enough in this day and age, and as he turned in the firelight his eyes blazed blue with defiance—
Bay added the layers slowly, as he had to, while Magnus hovered around him. Perhaps—perhaps he
Aquamarine stared back at him, unsure how to react. He tried and failed to look innocent, or humble. He wasn’t either of those things, but
“I thought maybe you and Molly could do some shopping,” he responded, which was exactly what she wanted to hear. The girls started to plan which stores they would visit—the most expensive ones in his mother’s mid-sized city—and John caught her eyes flickering away from him. People had slaves—not everyone, they were a bit of expense and trouble, but they weren’t rare. People didn’t usually let them go on shopping sprees, though, especially slaves like Irene, because that

missed you, though,” Magnus told him, stopping to gaze at him with utter sincerity. He lifted his hand to caress Bay’s cheek. “I always miss you. It’s been quite a long time, this round. More than ten years.” He seemed very sad all of a sudden, and very serious. “I suppose I sound quite mad to you,” he finally admitted, with a dry quirk of a smile. “I hope you’ll understand in time.”
had allowed him to keep. Ivan’s intentions were now plain to him, but his methods confused.
“Well, I’m off,” Magnus announced after a moment. “If you get into trouble, yell loudly.”
“I’d like to avoid that,” Bay assured him.
“Have you
“We’ll try to act normal,” John assured her dryly. “Come on,” he repeated to Aquamarine. “Walk on your feet. I know you can.” Aquamarine gave him a scornful look that said
“Don’t try to distract me,” Master panted a moment later, sounding very distracted. He rested his forehead against Aquamarine’s, still cupping his jaw. “Do not leave without my permission again,” he managed to repeat. “Do you understand? If something’s wrong come and tell me about it.”
This time, at least, the shadow over his heart passed after a few minutes, and he looked around the laundry room with a fresh eye, determined to control what he could in this situation. His clothing was going to be
Hands yanked him up when he wouldn’t, or couldn’t, move on his own. He was pushed, so he walked; he reached the end of his tether and started walking around in a circle at its maximum, conscious only of the pain and the dust and the heat.
Molly seemed pained by this suggestion, stroking his tense back soothingly. “You didn’t bite anyone, did you, Aquamarine?”
Irene was drawn by the chaotic chairs and ducked down to look beneath the table. “Is he under there?” she asked in a teasing tone. “What are you doing under there, Aquamarine?” The quivering ball did not acknowledge her.
The man gave him a look. “Would there be any point?”
Bay did so, then watched his master open the slightly dingy pink suitcase and shuffle through its contents—clothes, a novel. Everything inside it was pink.
Ivan grinned, slightly incredulous but also delighted. The spirit came through as well, even if he didn’t understand who he was talking to. “Well clean it then,” Ivan repeated, and Nico fetched a cloth and some water, his body language very put-upon.
“Can he come with us?” Molly asked hopefully.
Bay stared after him for a long moment.
The kitchens were well-appointed, being meant to serve a great king and his court; now they served only a single Hobbit. Bilbo was not sure what the dragon ate and he wasn’t going to ask, either. The fire was banked in the main hearth and Bilbo stirred it up and swung the kettle over it, then proceeded into the pantry. This was what
him, since he obviously had a specific answer in mind. He tried to think, not logically but Magnusly—Magnus had him send a text to Jennifer Wilson’s phone, a text that would be meaningless to most people but the murderer would think he’d failed—
They threaded through the tents and cages of the slave market, ignoring the calls from vendors advertising their wares. Despite disliking the close proximity with irrational humanity, Sherlock appreciated the energy, the possibility of London, its speed and convenience and capacity for distraction. He missed it, and he knew John did, too, by the way he was staring at the buildings looming around them instead of at the slaves they were supposedly looking for.
going to hit you.” His blue eyes gleamed with a frightening sincerity. “I love you, Bay. And I know you don’t understand that,” he added quickly as the slave looked away, stifling a sigh, “but it’s true, and I hope you will remember eventually.”
Magnus waved this off. “She’s not real.”
The bizarre game they were all enacting around him made him angry—slaves had enough to worry about without the mind-games masters sometimes liked to play. “Well at least he gave me a ride,” he said sharply, before he could stop himself, and immediately dropped his gaze to the cane he clutched.
Instead of answering him, Magnus turned to the slave. “What do you think?”
“Hey.” He stroked Aquamarine’s cheek until the slave looked at him. “I do often buy slaves to train, and sell them on. Molly and Irene aren’t going anywhere, though. You can ask them how it works. I promise it will not be a surprise.” John resisted making any remarks about how Aquamarine still had a long way to go in his training, as this might discourage him from trying. “Now put your collar back on.”
“Yes. That’s not important,” Magnus told him, and Bay nodded to himself. No extraneous comments necessary. “Just enter the number. Are you doing it?”
“Yes, please,” Bilbo agreed. The dragon—Smaug by reputation, but Magnus to his friends—tilted his head slightly sideways, so Bilbo could climb onto the relatively flat plane of his snout. He clung to a couple of small horns as the dragon straightened up and began to glide across the vast hall of treasure.
“Come here, lad,” Ivan instructed, waving the boy closer to the fireplace. Reluctantly he came, wary and tense. Ivan looked him over, marveling at how the key features always came through—the high cheekbones, full lips, blazing blue eyes. This time his hair was dark and curly and he was skinny as a rail—but he would be strong, Ivan predicted, and quick. “What’s your name?” he asked conversationally.
“She was killed by the same person as the other three!” Magnus insisted, as if this should be obvious.
“Oh, you gave me quite a turn, young man,” Mrs. Hudson chided him, not severely. “Now you shouldn’t be in here, should you? This is Molly’s room.” She turned his face up to hers. “You are skin and bones, aren’t you?” she tutted. “Here, have a biscuit.” He took it from her and ate it before she could take it back.
“Honestly,” John muttered.
Master was washing his hands again, thoroughly. “Sit down next to Irene and she’ll get you something to eat.”
Bilbo carefully sponged the gown. “I never fit in,” he admitted. Magnus was sometimes surprisingly easy to talk to; he’d heard dragons could weave spells with their words and make you spill your secrets. Though Bilbo’s secrets weren’t worth much to anyone but him. “I was always just a little bit different.”
to calm down. He meant to keep fighting. “That’s it, good boy. You know I just want to help you.” He couldn’t give in, just because the man’s voice was soothing, his touch gentle. Anyone could fake that temporarily. He heard a whine and was ashamed to realize it was coming from his own throat. “I know, you’re safe now,” his new master assured him. “You’re injured and I’m going to help you. Molly’s going to help you. You’ll let Molly help you, won’t you?”
“That’s fantastic.” Bay simply could not stop himself from speaking.
“Are you alright?” Molly cried, seeing the blood covering Aquamarine.
“Bay,” Magnus whispered, stroking his cheek gently, and Bay opened his eyes with a sharp intake of breath. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to startle you,” his master continued, as Bay’s eyes danced all around the cabin of the transport, orienting himself. “We’re just a few minutes outside of London.”
He spared the other two a glance. “Yes, good job with the socks,” he told Aquamarine faintly. “Shoes next.” Then he went back to Molly and his laptop.
“Oh yes,” Bilbo agreed readily. “I’m very glad to be fed, and not fed upon.”
“Let him sniff your hand,” Master told her, and she complied, holding elegant fingers under Aquamarine’s nose with a coy smirk. He inhaled her scent, delicate and spicy, and growled again in acknowledgement.
, Master?” she shot back tartly.
Ivan grinned at him slowly. “You might make a very effective spy,” he suggested, and Nico’s head snapped up, eyes wide. They held a tinge of fear.
Mrs. Hudson brought a platter of French toast to the table—his mother never had to lift a finger when he visited, and got her whole house cleaned as well, you’d think she’d enjoy that. Molly and Irene sat down at the table, giving Mrs. Watson a respectful berth, and reached out to load their plates up.
say anything, not when you could hardly move in the room once she was done.
The salesman adopted a sober expression. “Sadly Lady Englethorpe recently died,” he informed John. “Her husband, Lord Englethorpe, has decided to sell them, as he’ll be traveling abroad and no longer requires their services. As you see,” he went on, directing the slaves to get up and come closer to the bars, “we have two very fine domestics, Molly and Andrew, and Irene, a pleasure slave.” Irene made a coy little face at Sherlock as he said this.
Bilbo felt better after eating and went back to his task of laundry. Here was something he could really focus on, odd though that might seem. It required some care and attention, yet at many points could be done mindlessly, and when he was done it would be a big accomplishment. Just the right thing for taking his mind off his current predicament.
“Come on, let’s go outside for a bit,” John said, trying very hard not to grin at Aquamarine pouting in the corner with the dog.
Master didn’t sound angry exactly, he sounded… concerned. Aquamarine remembered how stunned he’d been to realize Master would kill to protect him. Stunned, and grateful, and like everything had suddenly changed. Impulsively he launched forward, bringing Master’s lips down to his in a raw, messy kiss that tried to express everything he couldn’t seem to say in words.
Bay glanced at the phone, which he’d left on the arm of his chair in case Magnus wanted it back. “And what good does texting the murderer do?” he asked, feeling suddenly quite weary.
being sold, then? The salesman wouldn’t like
“What? No.”
“Got anything?” Lestrade dared to ask.
“No,” his companion answered firmly. “Come on. Shouldn’t think this place would really bother
“Yes, you
Bay blinked at him. Definitely an odd one. “Oh, now and then,” he dismissed.
His master saw through that and smirked, but there was something sad in his eyes. Bay pondered that as they resumed walking. Sad that he would have to punish the slave later? Sad that he’d led a life of slavery? It was an odd reaction. Some people had odd reactions, though—odd people, whose actions couldn’t be predicted because something wasn’t right inside their heads. He’d had masters like that before, too. With them you could only endure, or die.
Sherlock snorted. "Sorry to brake it to you Lestrade but you had close to nothing to do with me getting into rehab."
He turned back to the dying cabbie with a pill in his hand. "Was I right? Did I get it right?" He asked and when the man didn't answer he threw it at him.
The older Holmes let out a humourless chuckle and tapped his umbrella against the floor a few times. "I wanted to talk about Sherlock and your son's relationship."
John almost fell through it. Sherlock clenched his fists as he saw how much problem John had with supporting his own weight. His blogger’s breathing was shallow, broken ribs, maybe even a punctured lung. Blood was flowing freely from a deep wound on his head, concussion was likely. That stupid coat didn’t help much with his balance either.
He was thinking about what to say when Sherlock stood up suddenly.
In the end Gladstone settled down in Sherlock's armchair and kept an eye on their every move. Though before he was calmed he did pee on Anderson. Lestrade wouldn't be suprised if Sherlock trained him to do that.
“Wouldn’t that be ideal?” He asked, but shook his head. “Unfortunately I can’t do that, I just can’t.” And with those words he raised his hand and started to murmur then a green light was coming at Sherlock who was frozen to the spot.
They were chatting when one of the officer's eyes widened. The others wanted to ask what was wrong but in the end just followed his gaze.
After that there was a disturbing quiet. Sherlock tried to open his eyes to see what was going on but he couldn't. However he could feel now that he was in a bed which was strange. Most of the times when he was kidnapped he was usually cuffed  to a chair. This time he wasn't even tied in any way.
Mycroft and Sherlock were from the same litter, the only two who survived. Though Sherlock had been weaker and slimmer than the others he surprisingly survived and Mycroft was protective of him ever since. They always lived on the streets, at first it was hard but then Mycroft became the leader of the cats around the area.
"None of the rules say that Lestrade."
Not paying attention to Molly he took a slip tentatively.
"Dad?" John stopped in the door step in suprise.
"Piss off." At that John let out a laugh and Sherlock couldn't help but chuckle too.
"We were together before they moved and we got married right before he was shipped off." Sherlock mummbled and pulled out a chain from underneath his shirt. On the end there was a simple gold band on it.
Sherlock crawled into their box next to him and pulled John in too. There was no way Sherlock would let his friend go back to his box in the quickly approaching storm.
." She waved a letter in front of his eyes. "He took his name. ." She took the letter in both hands again and just stared at it. Probably the truth really sinking in for the first, now that she had legal proof between her hands.
“Well, I couldn’t just leave the poor guy wandering aimlessly. He would have killed himself without a purpose after a month to arrive where he was originally planned to be by now.” The Goddess of faith and destiny answered. “I still can’t believe you have actually found Sherlock’s match. Though we should really talk to Ares and the other war Gods to dial it back.”
He tried to get out a word, something to stop the quite pretty woman leaving but he was busy not to fall on his ass as the young lady untagled them hastily from the leashes.
As soon as she regained the ability to speak she introduced them to each other. "Sherlock Holmes, John Watson. John Watson, Sherlock Holmes."
"For God's sake don't be idiots. We have to-"
"The engraving on your phone. The kiss suggests deep emotional relationship. And the 'Don't give up'? It could mean that you are still crushed about your parents' divorce but at Barts you spoke of it without much care so that's not it. She was probably thinking about you shoulder injury which you got while playing rugby and the injury worried you because it can cause conflict in something important to you which right now is your future, your carrier. Your shoulder healed but your mind transferred the pain to your leg because of the worry." John's expression was awed and Sherlock seeing this couldn't stop. "You have excellent reflexes and when you had sat down in my flat you had to move around, probably because your gun was digging into your back. You are obviously a good shooter, otherwise your Father wouldn't let you carry a gun around. Your Grandfather taught you."
"That was-" Here it comes. "amazing!" Sherlock almost spit the water out in suprise, fortunately he just coughed on it.
"God help us that he might actually be human." Lestrade said with sarcasm and disapproval.
Sherlock let out a growl at the buzzing noise. People were talking, glasses were clinking together, the cars were too loud outside.
Thanks for reading and sorry for any grammar mistakes. Hope you liked it.
"Who is John?" Lestrade asked, in all the two and a half years he had known Sherlock he had never heard of him.
The murderer yesterday had gotten away by lashing out and smashing a bottle on the top of the head of an officer. Greg stayed behind to make sure that his team member was alright since it was his responsibility. 10 minutes later just when the ambulance arrived he got a call from Sally -who had chased after their suspect with a few other officers- telling him that he got away.
Greg knocked on Sherlock's door and he only needed to wait a moment before the door was opened by a very tired looking Sherlock. His skin was paler and the dark circles under his eyes were more visible, his hair looked like he ran his and through it a hundred times. To put it nicely he looked like a mess. Like he was totally exhausted mentally.
"He left you behind. See? He doesn't really care about anything else than the cases, John." Greg said, looking down to his son who was sitting in front of the laptop and waiting to refresh. "He is an ex-junkie, anyway."
Sherlock couldn’t wait.
"Thank god, I was afraid you had become boring like the rest of the mass." Sherlock said with an eyeroll but inside he was secretly feeling warm. It was quite nice.
"Because you are an idiot." John said simply and started to walk off.
"No."
Over the last 24 hours he learned that John Watson was much more. He was different. He wasn’t even frightened by Mycroft.
Lestrade decided to speak up. "I have the car with me, with the sirens we should make it in half an hour." John tried to smile gratefully at him but failed.
“No.” What else would one say, whether true or not?
“I don’t know,” Master admitted, glancing back at Aquamarine thoughtfully. He stared back, unself-conscious but unhelpful. Aquamarine knew a lot about this Mycroft Holmes now, just by observing him—eating habits (plentiful, prone to temptation), general occupation (sitting, reading, writing), background (privileged, non-military, cosmopolitan)—but he didn’t know why he would be interested in a wildling slave with no memory of his origins and no tangible talents. Possibly, he just found him attractive.
“My skull? I like to talk to it sometimes. Oh, you weren’t here before,” Magnus realized suddenly.
“He does sort of remind me of Taffy, I suppose,” Mrs. Watson commented, in a slightly warmer tone, and John coughed a little.
"So you don't think I am boring?" John asked with a smirk but Sherlock could see it in his eyes that he really wanted to know the answer.
"I can't believe you are callinh the freak again." She rolled her eyes.
"Alright? Alright?!" He shouted and rounded on John. He pushed the letter into his face. "How could this be alright? They are taking you away from me. They want to send you back into that death pit." He spat out the words. He was about to continue but then one of the officers moved, presumably to leave, but he maneged to bump into the table and thus making a glass fall and shutter.
"Not good and there has been another one."
Sherlock shook his head slightly and recieved an eyeroll.
Sherlock's eyebrows shot up. He was impressed. John was asking the right questions. It even helped him to think. It's no wonder now how he managed to be helpful to Lestrade.
This time John snorted. "No you didn't."
Sherlock nodded and he would deny it till the end of the world that he had let his gratitude and relief show in those moments, though the other Gods would say it other wise.
He walked up the stairs after he was let in by a sad looking Mrs. Hudson.
He looked at the other yarders then. Slowly looking over their faces, glaring at them. "I would ask who are you but your stupid, empty gazes tell me that you are part of the oh so productive NSY." Greg was now sure that he heard desperation there. "Nevertheless that you-"
"There was no need for you to grab me again." John grumbled in annoyance but he still snuggled closer to Sherlock against the cold.
Lestrade shook his head in uncertainty as he followed Sherlock in. He had no idea why Sherlock wanted to be here. He would have never imagined Sherlock being so determined to play paintball. Especially with the yard.
John was standing there like moments before, but around him was a light blue shield, buzzing with energy.
Mycroft shot him a glare and pulled out a notebook. "Your son has trust issues."
At this Sherlock lost it.
"Rache, german. It means revenge. So we know that she is not from the area.."
"John." Next to him Sherlock whispered than lunged forward. He collided with one John Watson who dropped his bag just in time to have both of his arms free for the hug Sherlock greeted him with.
Aphrodite stood up and looked down at Sherlock with a sad look. “No, not at all.” Then she vanished into thin air.
Aphrodite snorted. “Yeah darling.” Sherlock raised his eyebrows and with an eye roll looked to the right. The Goddess saw that she had to get to the man from a different view. “Wouldn’t it bother you then if I found him a girlfriend then, right? Poor chap shouldn’t be wasted now that he cost a favour from Hades.” Sherlock at that raised an eyebrow.
He looked around the room and his eyes stopped on a leather-bound book. It was on the coffee table and it wasn't covered in dust like most of he surface in the flat.
Sherlock looked up next to him where normally John would be standing, looking over his shoulder with Gladstone. However there was no one there this time and Sherlock froze, remembering why that was.
"Yes, just a murder. Sorry for leaving so soon-"
"Thanks Greg." He heard John say from behind him. He was in his camouflage clothes and heavy army boots. He looked at him as he went to Sherlock and knelt before him.
Ten minutes later all of them were in the car. They sat in the back together. John's back was straight, already preparing himself for the upcoming month. Although he still had an arm around Sherlock's shoulder as the detective laid his head on his shoulder.
"Get out!"
“It. It was great.” Sherlock narrowed his eyes at him and didn’t say a word. “Ah, okay. Her name is Sarah and we got a-”
"And you? What have you done?" He asked the dirty one.
He felt his stomach become heavy from some unknown reason.
Greg felt bad for him, he knew that he needed to say something, anything, but he had no idea what. "Sherlock, I believe you." He said in the end, just before the man left. The consultant stopped in the doorway, his back facing the inspector.
Sherlock sat up straight pulling his legs off as John greeted everyone with a smile and a hi. Then he went to Sherlock and kissed him on the cheek.
They started at the same time making the whole thing more awkward for them.
"Yes, savour it." Sherlock said while standing up, John instantly doing the same.
"That can't be. They had barely talked to each other." Greg said, desperately trying to believe it, but even he couldn't deny that his son had a tendency to become very loyal, very quickly to certain people. "Being around Sherlock is dangerous. He must know that."
Paying no mind to him they laid down to catch their breath.
"No, I don't." Lestrade sighed. "But I know what kind of things he does." Greg waited for a response but his son stubbornly refused to look at him, with a sigh he turned around and left. Hoping that his son would do the right thing.
Sherlock stopped to take a breath and regarded John. "You like danger, you can shoot, you are studying to be a doctor. You are planning to sign up to the army for excitement." He finished and strangely his last deduction left a sour taste in his mouth.
At this Sherlock's attention focused on John. Unattached?
As soon as they were alone in the office Greg cringed mentally and waited for the insults from Sherlock to start but surprisingly he said nothing. Now that was strange.
His head snapped up lightning fast. He watched the screen intently as the black and white dots slowly started to form a picture. Moriarty’s face quickly became visible in the chaos. Then they started to settle down and gain colour.
John at the noise looked up but he was still lost in his own head, however Anderson managed to bring him back quickly. The idiot.
Lestrade smiled at the obvious anticipation. The younger man was like a child on a christmas morning. Though Lestrade wasn't so suprised anymore that the detective was so eager to see his husband again. They learned how really important John was to Sherlock in the past month.
"Even if he is real he probably left because he couldn't be near to you." Sally sneered.
Sherlock couldn’t help, but laugh at what John had said. They were having Chinese take away from his favourite place back at Baker St after the serial suicide case.
"Don't think I don't feel guilty. Don't you dare to think I don't care that I left him with her." He whispered and looked down. His eyes glazed over as got lost in his thoughts.
He looked up from his phone when he heard Donovan scoff.
However he needed to solve this case so he told Greg his deductions with a rapid speed and only stopped when he was told that there was no case.
Donovan growled in frustration but stopped wanting to go out and get shot.
“Greetings Sherlock.” He could even hear the smirk in his voice. “This is your fifth beep. What a turn on, isn’ it Sherlock? You know through years and years you held me back. You called it that we balance each other, but both of us know that’s stupid. We are not really each other’s opposite. But I just couldn’t get you to back off. You are a half god I couldn’t really threaten you, but now, oooh now is completely different. You gained a pressure point.” Sherlock eyes widened. No. “Oh you are getting it. I had a sweet little chat with Johnny boy here. I see why you like him. Anyway You have one hour Sherlock or I gonna send your pet here as a late wedding gift to Persephone and Hades. Tick-tock. Tick-tock. See you soon Sherlock.”
Aphrodite just huffed. “You mean the Goddess of everything you don’t understand and secretly want?” She pulled up a challenging eyebrow and for a moment Sherlock was caught off guard, but quickly covered it up and was ready to retort but then the door swung open.
Far too soon they parted. He couldn’t help the stupid grin that made its way onto his face as they looked at each other. John was flushed and his eyes twinkled and they seamed to be a lighter blue, the small wrinkles disappeared and he appeared to be younger. Sherlock felt immensely proud that he was the cause of that.
Sherlock was part of the Greek family so he had a stronger connection with them however due to his arrogant nature most Gods disliked him. He even mocked Zeus for constantly sticking his dick into places where he really shouldn’t .Although there was a half god who he despised the most. Moriarty. Child of Erebus, ancient God of darkness, and a mere mortal.
Greg debated about sitting next to him but then Sherlock put up his legs on the bench. Efficiently telling everyone that that place is already saved for somebody else.
They shook hands and Sherlock felt a little warmer as they touched. When they let go he pulled up one eyebrow. "Watson?" He asked.
“Your choice,” John warned him, and Aquamarine crawled towards Irene with acceptance.
He could walk slowly, but to the ends of the earth, if it was away from the salesman and the market. Of course, he didn’t know what he was walking
Magnus let out a sigh, and caressed Bay’s cheek with his thumb until he relaxed marginally. “I’ll get you a warmer jacket,” he finally promised, “and we’re actually going to a restaurant. You can eat whatever you like there. Will you please come with me?”
Aquamarine seemed to know it and dropped back down on all fours, crawling around the deck to show off his rear end in the jeans. That also enabled John to notice his still-bare feet. “Didn’t she get you any shoes?” John asked, as Aquamarine came back to him.
“Aquamarine,” his master prompted after a moment. “You should be able to speak. Repeat my name so if you get lost, you can tell people who you belong to.” He cocked his head to the side slightly. “Do you remember my name?”
At first Bilbo had been too nervous to eat much with the dragon staring at him—visions of being fattened up for later consumption persisted in his mind—but gradually he’d gotten more used to it. And the food was very good—steak, bacon, hard-boiled eggs, fried potatoes, flapjacks, muffins, fresh fruit, tea, the likes of which could not be found in Laketown anymore, even by someone who was willing and able to steal it. The secret, Bilbo had decided, was to not
“Coming,” she replied, giving Bay one last look before walking away.
This was the point when the master marched over and cuffed him in the ear, saying he didn’t care
“My new slave,” Magnus finally said.
A shot rang out in the still air, echoing slightly, making Aquamarine jump backwards and drop the pill. The man lay on the ground in front of him now, not quite dead yet but rapidly bleeding out. “Aquamarine!” His head jerked up, toward the jumble of boulders nearby, and to his astonishment he saw his master scrambling from them, in his hand literally the smoking gun. Master dropped to his knees beside Aquamarine, setting aside the gun so he could pat the slave down, squeezing his arms and ribs, cupping his cheek. “Are you alright? Are you hurt? Did he hurt you?”
him. Were mothers supposed to be nervous around their children? He’d never understood that sort of thing.
with it. Often no one noticed me, or I could convince them I was innocent.” He was not particularly proud of this ability, such as it was—he’d done what he had to, to survive. Well, not really, he’d done
Medical background, as Aquamarine had already deduced from his belongings. If he hadn’t, the way his master casually poured out a bowl of water and washed his hands in it first would give it away. Water was precious in the desert, though less so if you were rich, he supposed.
