“Thank you so much.”
“This is John,” he heard his father say, but his focus was on his brother who looked strangely guilty.
“Is it always like this?” he asked Dean quietly.
“It was a Demon,” Dean answered Sam’s unfinished question, and Sam frowned.
“Who is she?” Adam asked.
“Are you
The sky was clear and the air almost warm but Dean still felt a shiver running down his spine when they arrived at the park. Rollercoasters, swing rides, a Ferris Wheel, the whole shebang. Adam smiled excitedly and it made sense, Dean supposed, Adam probably had a whole bunch of good memories of him and his mum, enjoying a nice summer day at something like this. Hell, maybe John had even taken him.
“Alright boys, keep it civil,” Bobby grumbled but there was fondness underneath and Dean couldn’t help but smile while he pressed his forehead against Cas’. Gently, he pulled away and faced Bobby and Ellen.
“That doesn’t make any sense.”
He saw that Max was holding the gun again, calmer this time. He exchanged a look with Cas, trying to tell him what he would do, before approaching Max. Except, Max had let go of the gun and now it was floating in mid-air, pointing at him. Dean’s eyes grew wide and he stopped, unsure of what to do. Dean heard the clicking of the safety, before the gun swung around towards Alice.
“Jo?”
So it goes.
“Mornin’ Adam,” Dean grumbled.
“I was talking to Matt when Alex stumbled through the door. He said he’d been put on trial for something he did and sentenced to death.”
Nonetheless, Dean accelerated because this was their first real lead on their dad.
“Give him time,” Bobby told them, or rather Dean, “It ain’t easy what he went through.”
He was just done with his whiskey, thinking of getting a second one, when the door to the Roadhouse opened, and Bobby walked in, grey beard, baseball cap and all.
“I don’t know.”
“You died, Dean. The Demon killed you and…and you were dead.” It almost physically hurt Dean to see so much pain in Cas’ eyes and he swallowed hard.
He sparred with Claire in the gym, learning to never underestimate someone just because they were a foot smaller than him, much to Claire’s amusement after his back had hit the mat for the third time in a row.
“We went to bed last night and when I woke up this morning, he was gone. Doors were still locked, windows closed and all of his stuff was there. I know Alex, he didn’t just leave.” Matt seemed desperate now and Dean felt sorry for the boy. “I’m sorry, I didn’t know who else to call,” he muttered.
“You want us to leave you two alone?” Adam joked and Dean flipped him off, enjoying the food. They ate in silence, and slowly but surely, Dean became more relaxed, his head getting clearer but he knew it was only a matter of time before it would hit again. Maybe, Cas was right. Maybe he did need help. Or maybe he should just talk about it.
“Okay,” Sam agreed, carefully replacing the spell book on the table.
“We’re also digitalizing all of this,” Dean went on to explained, “Still. Takes a hell of a long time and we keep finding more ‘cause this place is frickin’ massive.”
Dean grunted in assent. “Just be careful,” he added, “They’re Cas’.”
It had taken him a long time and a boyfriend to realize it, but John was as much to blame as he was; training him to be the perfect soldier, an obedient pet, ready to follow orders. But Dean was not a soldier. He was a worrier. Fighting for what he believed in and right now he believed in Sam.
As it turned out, it didn’t take half an hour for Ben to come home and when he did, Dean was a nervous wreck.
“No, you’re not. You’re keeping secrets.”
Dean wondered and stepped closer.
“Dean,” Cas pressed, “What happened with Sam?”
“Oh right, this is Sam, my brother,” Dean introduced them and Matt nodded. “What’s up man?” he asked and sat down, the others following his example.
“So, first of all there was James Jayden, he drowned in the garden pond. That was a month ago. Then, two weeks ago, Ferhad Baitan, a car fell on him in his own garage. A few days later, Jack Serendel, tripped and fell down the stairs, broke his neck, and finally, yesterday, Greg McQueen, who fell through the roof of his house. All of those were in the same neighbourhood and…Ferhad Baitan? He used to be a Hunter.”
, he wanted to say,
“Claire would.”
“Thank you, Dean. For everything. Ben told me what happened and…I mean I can’t say I understand it but…thank you.”
Bobby’s phone rang and Dean watched him as he fished it out of his pocket.
The stool next to him scraped over the floor as Dean sat down next to him. “No, you’re not,” he said, “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have – I’m sorry.”
Both Matt and Alex nodded. Satisfied, the two Hunters left the house and got into the, while Dean tried to reach Sam.
Unfortunately, Matt shook his head, “No, no don’t worry about it. I was just leaving for work.”
“So, why are you the one telling me?”
“We will. This is not going to happen again. Ever.” There was conviction in John’s voice and Dean felt himself relaxing. Maybe it wasn’t such a bad thing that their father was with them.
“Dean. Cas.” Matt smiled at them, before noticing Sam.
That night, when everyone assembled in the Bunker for the weekly get-together, it was Sam standing by Benny’s side as the Vampire drank a blood bag like a Capri-Sun, Sam joking with Charlie, Sam helping the kids in the kitchen. And when they all piled in front of the TV, Dean and Jo arguing about which movie they were going to watch first, and Eileen sat down next to him with a smile that made him blush, and when Jo won the argument and the first scenes of Legally Blonde started playing, and when Dean sat down on his other side, grumbling and mumbling and cuddling up to Cas, Sam realized that this was his family and he really was home.
“Dean?” Dean pointedly ignored his half-brother in the back seat and turned around to look at Cas.
“What would I do? I’d kill every last one that laid a finger on him and then I’d lock Sam up in Bobby’s panic room so they can’t get to him,” Dean answered harshly.
“Dean.” Cas’ voice was soothing, calm but also decisive. “Let him go,” Cas whispered and Dean started crying.
“For fuck’s sake! We don’t have time for this,” John exclaimed, “Sam, you wanna kill this Demon, you gotta trust me.”
Sam couldn’t take his eyes off his brother as he followed him. There was something about him, something different. He was older, sure, but Sam realized, while Dean ordered a soda and asked after Jo with a genuine smile and a soft look in his eyes, he had also changed as a person, and Sam had no idea who this man was.
“Good.” That he actually meant. It was good. They might not know each other very well but Lisa was a bright, pretty woman and Dean really wished for her to be happy. For the kid to be happy.
“You’re just a sore looser,” the girl shot back and a second later both entered the kitchen. Sam couldn’t tell their ages, anywhere between 15 and 25, though he was almost sure the girl was the older one of the two, her long hair blond and wet, while the boy reminded him of Dean somehow. Both sported scraped knuckles and split lips.
“Well enough,” the Vampire answered, “Lenore took ‘em in, told ‘em the rules. She’s gonna talk to the parents of the twins. They’ll probably have to move to avoid suspicion, but I bet they’ll be happy to have their kids back.”
“Claire!” Cas’ voice cut in, sharp and final, “Why don’t you go and see if Dean needs any help in the kitchen.”
Dean shrugged. “’m not,” he answered, “Means what we’re doing’s working.”
“We’ll find her, Ellen. I promise.”
“That is correct. But your husband lied to you, did he not? About his past, his family?”
“A Psychic in Lawrence, Kansas. Friend of dad, too. You can come if you want,” Dean said just before questioning himself for suggesting it because, what the hell? But Adam was smiling like he had just revealed that Santa Claus was real and Dean really didn’t have the heart to take back his words and anyway, it was just a trip to Kansas.
Jody drained her coffee and waved Sam through to the kitchen where she filled the cup back up. “There are ways,” she answered, “You heard of Samuel Colt?”
“Hey, I wasn’t finished with that,” he complained when Cas took his beer and the cigarette from him, but it was only half-heartedly and Cas just winked. He dropped the cig and emptied the beer before going inside and Dean followed, shaking his head.
Dean nodded, he definitely understood why they shouldn’t stay, but – “What about Alex?” he asked, “That ring of salt won’t hold forever. I say, we find that son of a bitch and put an end to this. “
“Dean.” There was a subtle warning in Cas’ tone and Dean sighed.
“There is something I haven’t told you.”
“He’s the one that fucking left.”
“Why are we doing this anyway?” he finally asked after Eileen had offered him a bottle of water and they were both taking a minute away from the smell of mildew.
The last thing on his mind before falling asleep, was the picture Dean and Cas and Claire and Ben, smiling happily at the camera, mocking him with something he could never have.
“Morning, Sam.”
“Yes.”
Dean let out a dry, humourless chuckle. “Yeah, well, I had 10 years to get over it,” he said, and he was, Sam realized, Dean was over it, “But I know you two had your problems before you left and you just found out he’s gone, and – and that’s tough, so, y’know? Take as long as you need.”
In fact, they were.
They all hurried out of the room and into the car, rushing through the streets towards Roger’s apartment. Sam still seemed a little out of it even though he did a good job at hiding it but Dean could see it. The weariness in his eyes, the pale of his skin.
Together, they carried John into the Roadhouse and up the stairs to the guest bedroom.
Sam bit his lip. He had more questions than answers at this point, and a voice in the back of his mind started reminding him that he was being somewhat reckless. After all, he hadn’t seen Bobby in 15 years, his house was abandoned, and just because the voice on the phone had sounded like him, who was to say that it had actually been him? But then, if Jody was not who she said she was and this was a trap, it was a poor one, and she’d had more than enough opportunities to hurt him and not taken them.
It was a quiet journey. There was not much to say except for the things they already knew, so Dean was content with just being there with Cas, one hand comfortably laid on the other man’s thigh, his thumb rubbing circles over the fabric of the trousers.
“They – they – they took me,” Emma cried out, “They took me. I heard them talking. They were going to kill me!”
On impulse, Dean closed his eyes and took one deep breath. He could feel the blood pumping through his veins, the adrenaline, the anticipation. He could hear his own heartbeat, fast and steady and for the split of a second, it all seemed to slow down.
“I just...I just need to buy a few hours, that's all.”
Sam didn’t stir, didn’t answer, didn’t even look, his eyes firmly fixed on the crack in the ceiling while Bobby let out a heavy sigh and the chair by the desk scraped over the floor before the older man sat down.
“Do you know where she could be?” Sam asked.
“Dean…” she started, “It’s you dad. He’s dead.”
“Oh, of course. Just through here.”
Very careful to not meet Bobby’s gaze, and pointedly ignoring Dean’s snide remark, Sam told Eileen, “I just had to get away for a bit.”
“Three years,” Lisa replied, “It’s not perfect but it works.”
“Hey Cas, how’s it going?” he smiled at the windshield.
“I’m uncertain what to say,” Cas answered, his fingers playing with the hem of his shirt, “You’re brother just lost a part of his family and this is the first time in years that you and your brother are in the same place…I guess I’m trying to figure where fit in in all that.”
“Matt, this is Dean, an old friend. Dean, Matt, my fiancé.”
He could see it in the hardness of her eyes and the set of her jaw, the way she clenched her fist, could hear it in the sharpness of her voice – Dean had been like that, back when they’d still known each other. From what Sam had seen so far, he still was.
“Beer.”
scared. Scared for Cas. Scared for his dad. And the worst part was that there was nothing he could do, except wait.
“You gonna make good on that promise?” Dean whispered.
“Well yes, but –” Madison vanished with a wave of Osiris’ hand.
“Charlie mentioned a Werewolf Hunt.” The memory was hazy, overshadowed by everything else that had happened and doused in the heavy fog of alcohol, but definitely there.
“Alright,” Dean repeated, the faintest of smiles tugging on the corners of his lips, “I’ll go get packed. Cas, can you…” he trailed off, looking back at Cas and gesturing towards the computer.
“Yeah.” Dean pulled the Colt out of his jeans but something made him hesitate.
“Makes sense. Dad always had a theory about it and…well…” he hesitated.
, was written in the same neat handwriting as the rest of the book on the inside of the cover.
One foot in front of the other.
Sam only nodded in quiet acceptance and they spent the rest of the drive mostly in silence, stopping once for gas and a snack, and Dean even allowed him to take the wheel for the last stretch of road until they’d arrived at the motel, something Sam most definitely hadn’t missed, and Dean immediately called Cas so they could go over the case and figure out where the Nest was hiding out and what they could expect when they went in.
“I have no idea. Come on, get dressed.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What are you saying? That he only needs one?” Cas asked, finally catching on, “But then why would he make so many?”
“No, sorry, there are hundreds of people here, every day,” she handed the picture back to Dean who pointed at the security cameras.
“Wait – Jackson? Same Jackson as Julian and Harry? The two missing people?”
“Good afternoon,” Dean greeted Roger Miller when he opened the door.
“I dunno, man. You sure this is our kind of thing?” Dean asked when they got back into the car.
“And you only mentioning this now?” Cas was exasperated but Adam only shrugged apologetically.
He did. They both did. Sorting through the archives was tedious work, stacking up files by cases, by year, by location, and yet Sam found himself almost enjoying it as he read through the seemingly never-ending well of knowledge, occasionally exchanging looks and smiles with Eileen, finding comfort in the calm of the basement, and some part of him was even a little disappointed when Bobby came down to tell them lunch was ready and they both went upstairs.
“Same goes for you,” John replied eventually.
It was a silent drive and they switched halfway through after Sam, lost in thoughts, ran over a red light and nearly crashed with a truck. Jody didn’t comment on it, merely suggested he pull over and let her drive the rest of the way, and Sam, too keyed up to argue, agreed. The closer they got, the bigger the knot of nerves grew inside of him, but it was too late to go back now. He could already see the sign to the town entrance.
, Sam wanted to say,
“Where’s your brother, Dean?” Gordon asked suddenly.
“I think normal’s overrated,” Dean said, “I think your ex-girlfriends had a point and you should listen to them. And –” He hesitated, worrying his lower lip for just a moment before continuing, “The way we grew up? That was some fucked up shit,” he told Sam, the barest hint of bitterness sounding through, “Now, I dealt with that. Got the chip and everything. Have you?” It was a genuine question, was the thing. Dean wanted to know.
“Dean?” Ellen asked in disbelief.
“Son. Of a.
you decide to meet up with us? Where were you?” he asked.
“What are you waiting for? Give it to me, Dean.”
“Er…I was upstairs with Sammy and dad was possessed by the Demon. I don’t know what happened after that. Where are Sam and dad, anyway?” he asked, but was only met with more blank stares and silence. “What? What is it?”
Slowly, John lowered the phone, a look of defeat on his face.
They did return later that night with an arsenal, a thermos of coffee, enough food to feed an army, and Cas on speed dial, sitting in the Impala safely hidden by the shadows of the trees, watching as the cabin slowly came to life.
Bobby hummed. “Not me you should apologize to, boy, but I’ll take it.”
Sam nodded along, offering her a tissue. “We understand that this is stressful for you,” he said, “But would you have any idea where Max could have gone? You told the police he went on a walk. Was that something he did often?”
“Anyway,” Dean went on after taking a deep breath, “Downstairs – Hell – they weren’t happy I’d ganked their prom king. I had a price on my head. They caught up with me eventually and – I was tired Sam.” Finally, for the first time since they’d left the Bunker, Dean looked at him, really looked at him. Sam wished he hadn’t. “I was done. I’d’ve died right there and then ‘cause I’d given up.” He shook his head, sighing. “Cas saved me. It’s what he does. It’s what he’s been doin’ ever since.”
“Uhm…” Adam blinked rapidly, not having expected the question, “Maybe, checking out the last places the victims were seen? Looking for any kind of connection?”
“Well, I guess Adam and I will go over to the morgue,” he heard Cas muttering but didn’t really react to it. Suddenly there was a hand on his head, running through his hair and a pair of soft lips, ghosting over his skin. “When we come back, I want you to talk to me, okay?” Cas whispered, “I love you, Dean.”
Sam’s desperately looked forth and back between his father and his brother.
“Jo, what happened?” Ellen asked and stepped towards her daughter but she ignored her, instead she kept looking at Dean, a pained expression on her face.
“Whatever you have from last Saturday,” Adam said eagerly, earning himself an exasperated look from Cherry, before she slowly answered, “There are exactly 100 cameras in this park, we are open from 10 to 6, which means there are 800 hours of footage from last Saturday,” Cherry said monotonously and the three Hunters stared at her for a moment before Adam reacted.
And it was wrong.
“Jesus,” Dean muttered under his breath as he took in the burned remains of what once must have been a pretty building. Some curious onlookers were lingering before the barrier, and while the firefighters had already left, there was still a lonesome ambulance and in the ambulance was –
“I’ll try calling him again,” Bobby said and went to the phone, “Hey Sam, it’s me again and I swear if you don’t call me back soon…there’s something you should know about Dean and I’ll be damned if I tell you this over the phone, so call me, ya –” the rest of Bobby’s words were drowned by the sound of the door bursting open.
“So, he is a Witch,” Sam concluded, daring a side-glance at Dean who nodded his head but remained quiet, “And, what? You don’t mind?”
“Did they bleed in your mouth?” Dean asked from behind Sam, stepping closer.
“Talk to me, Dean,” Cas interrupted his train of thoughts, “Tell me about Sam. He went to Stanford, yes?”
His brother's face went completely blank. “So, it comes for the kids? Like it came for me? Mum. Jessica. They died because of me?” he wanted to know. There was something desperate about the way his voice tightened and Dean felt his big – brother instincts kicking in.
“Alright,” Sam agreed, giving Jody a nod.
“Exactly.”
And Sam wasn’t sure why or how, but he found himself recounting the story of Stanford and how he’d ended up here for the third time, and even though this woman was essentially a total stranger, she listened and nodded and didn’t say anything until he was done.
“I know that, just…please, man…I need you alive, okay?”
Quiet.
When Dean woke up, it was dark outside and he had no idea what time it was. Cas was lying next to him, his arm draped around Dean’s chest, face buried in Dean’s neck. The Hunter was a bit confused, not sure what it was that had woken him up, when he heard it again; the buzzing of a phone. Groaning lightly, Dean reached to retrieve the offensive object from the nightstand.
“If you even had a spark of reason in that thick head of yours you’d do it yourself, Dean. Have mercy on your brother, cause I sure as hell won’t once I find him. He’s hanging out with Demons, d’you know that? Fraternizes with the enemy. He’s murdered people in cold blood. He’s the Antichrist.” If it wasn’t for Gordon’s eyes, Dean would have said that he’d lost his mind, except there was no sign of madness, no insanity. Gordon truly believed every word he said; that Sam was evil, that he needed to be put down before it was too late.
The door closed shut and Dean was left alone with Sam. Sam who had just lost his wife and unborn child. Sam who probably blamed himself for Jess’ death. Sam -
Dean thought.
“Guilt?”
Dean shrugged, “’s not like Sam said much since it happened. The house was a ruin when we got there and Cas managed to talk to a view people at the station and they couldn’t find the source of the fire. The house was new. No way it just went up in flames for no reason.”
“Yeah. I think you’d like him.”
“Sulking,” Dean answered, entering the apartment. Matt and Alex were sitting on the sofa in a ring of Salt, Matt’s arm protectively wrapped around his boyfriend’s shoulder.
Daring a look to his right, Dean saw the soft smile playing around Cas’ lips and the softness in his eyes. “I know, Dean.”
“She was infected, Dean,” Sam just replied without looking at him.
The drive back to the bunker was silent but much more relaxed, Dean absent-mindedly humming along to the radio while Sam contented himself with staring out of the window, thinking about what Dean had said. He still wasn’t sure he understood all that was going on, or how he felt about Witches and Werewolves suddenly being the good guys, but maybe he could try. Dean had trusted him with this, the least Sam could do was return the curtesy and not run off. Again.
“So was she.” Cas stood over the second body, a girl with brown hair, her skin torn open, bloody. Dean stared at the empty eyes and the eyes seemed to stare back at him, while he tried to ignore the lump in his throat and the constant
The sun was slowly setting and the fire burned bright against the dark of the forest. Dean was a bit drunk, not that he cared, who wanted to see their dad’s cremation while sober, anyway? It was strange; he had spent so many years loving John, only to hate him afterwards, and now he was gone and Dean felt like something had been stolen from him. Something he had never had in the first place. There were so many things he would have liked to say and now it was too late. From the corner of his eye, he saw Jo, wrapping her arm around Adam’s waist while the boy starred into the flames.
“Sam?”
Pretty soon after that, Cas and Dean had been in Pennsylvania on a case; a case that Jo had found but Ellen hadn’t wanted her to go on. Jo, stubborn as she always was, had followed them of course, gotten kidnapped by the ghost and nearly died. Ellen had blamed Dean. Hell, Dean had blamed Dean. And now she was possessed by a Demon. Good times.
“Shut your mouth,” he said instead, “Chris, are you sure they didn’t get you?”
“Pastor Jim Murphy from Blue Earth, Minnesota, was found dead in his church, throat slit. Traces of sulphur all over the place,” Ash explained unnecessarily gleeful.
“But didn’t he leave you behind?” Osiris asked, his eyes fixed on Sam.
Dean chocked on his own spit and almost turned around in his seat to really look at his brother. “Wow,” he said after he had somewhat caught himself. “Never thought I’d hear you say those words.”
“Take cover – now!”
Kate opened her mouth as if to say something when suddenly three men appeared at her side, after throwing a quick glance at Dean, they turned towards Lenore.
Dean turned towards Phil who stood in the lab, looking utterly lost.
“It was pure evil.” For a second, Dean thought that he saw fear in Missouri’s eyes. “I haven’t seen your daddy since. He left shortly after that with you two, Hunting the Demon that killed his wife. The same thing that killed Jessica.” She added towards Sam whose eyes were still a bit too unfocused to Dean’s liking.
Dean took be book, barely daring to look at it but when he did he had to swallow hard. He’d been right, he knew the book.
He pressed a gentle kiss on Cas’ forehead and walked outside to his car. He knew that Ben had safely gotten back home, but he still needed to know how they were holding up and Lisa deserved an explanation.
Fiona nodded through the tears now freely spilling over her cheeks.
“Come on,” Dean rasped, ignoring the look the other two exchanged.
“Yeah. Let’s go inside.”
Speaking of unforgivable things.
“Alright, I’m listening,” Dean grumbled, his eyes fixed on Adam who seemed to be unable to meet Dean’s gaze but still answered in a low, timid voice.
“The one with the restraining order?” Dean asked, looking up from where he was marking down the Pint Tree bar
He felt helpless again. Useless.
“Dean, you can’t –”
It was a long shot, of course, but maybe…
“You can by being there for him.” They separated and then it was Cas’ turn. Dean smiled faintly at the picture of his boyfriend and his as-good-as surrogate father – two of the most important people in his life. “Cas?” Bobby asked.
“I’m not stupid, Dean,” he said, “Neither am I blind. And it’s not like I care either way but what I do care about is that you treat me like I’m an idiot! You’re worried about me, I get that, but I’m not a kid anymore, And I’m fine.” And then it was Sam storming out of the room and Dean was left alone.
And another.
“No,” Jody replied solemnly, “Not everyone.”
“Alex used to do drugs, deal them too,” Matt began to explain, “A kid from his neighbourhood died, he stopped after that, went into rehab. Last night the kid that died showed up, he blamed Alex for his death. He was only 16.”
“One of my colleges, Sarah McQueen, she lost her husband too. They had a child, little boy. It’s just the two of them now,” Matt said.
“Let me talk to him,” Dean demanded, his mind reeling.
“Yes,” Cas said, “Dean talks a lot about you.”
Inhale.
“What else do you like Ben?” Dean asked, completely ignoring Lisa now.
“Uhm – What?” Sam said intelligently, too stunned to come up with anything else. How could she possibly know him?
“Nothing, I – like I said I was around and –”
“Demons,” Dean answered while putting away his weapon, “Three bodies.”
“Not what I asked,” Dean grumbled, looking back over his shoulder, waiting. “Come on,” he said, when Sam didn’t answer, “Got enough bedrooms to house an army.”
“Not really.” Cas shrugged. “I don’t even know why I’m so upset, I mean…Ellen’s still alive. And Jo. It’s just the Roadhouse…it was like home to me,” he admitted.
“I read,” Dean crossed his arms defensively.
, he though,
“Sam’s not a Psychic, though,” Dean threw in.
He thought frantically.
, Sam wanted to argue,
“I’m sorry, Jess.” Sam whispered hoarsely.
She suddenly got up and Dean needed a second to process her words.
“Sam?” Dean exclaimed in utter disbelief. God…how long had it been? 7 years? 8? “What’s going on, man?”
Dean looked at him, his mouth working around words that never came, before giving up and shaking his head.
Her words made him chuckle despite the growing pit in his stomach. “Don’t worry, that’s not why I’m here,” he assured her, “I just – do you know Bobby Singer?”
“She wouldn’t,” Dean answered quickly, “We lost touch over ten years ago.”
“Where’s the Colt?”
“I didn’t mean to!” Fiona said frantically, “I always took my blood from the hospital, but with Kim and Ray it wasn’t enough, I couldn’t take more, and they were so hungry, so I thought Michael, no great loss there, but then Max found us and he said he’d tell everyone what I did to Michael if I didn’t turn him, and he took Emma, and it all just got out of control!”
“Jess was my friend,” the paramedic answered his unasked question, “You can see your brother now.” She stepped aside and Dean immediately rushed forward. The closer he got, he heavier the weight got in his heart.
“You told us to come. The text you sent me?” Dean said but there was doubt nagging at him, doubt that maybe –
“I wanna know why. Why’d you do it?” The desperation in Sam’s voice made Dean snap out of his thoughts.
death – and yet Dean had been blind, had been unwilling to see just how different his brother was from the kid he had once known…and the fucked up thing was…none of that made him any less Dean’s brother and Dean would be damned if he let anything else happen to his little Sammy.
He pondered.
“It wasn’t a question,” Claire snapped back from where she was almost towering over Dean, “I was just letting you know that this is happening.”
“I’m sorry about your dad,” Jody finally spoke up softly, bringing Sam’s mind to a screeching halt.
“I don’t know where Sam is and even if I did, I wouldn’t tell you. Now, get
“Stay back.” Sam commanded and Dean – stayed back.
“Yeah. Turns out, it wasn’t him that sent me the text.” he replied.
They had fallen into a comfortable silence, when Dean remembered, “Cas?” he asked.
They made quick work of the door by simply kicking it in and not a moment too late because Max was standing in the middle of the kitchen, staring at his mother and Dean could have sworn that the knife, lying on the counter was moving.
“Why?” Andrea asked.
– and then take it away from him. Sam clung to him as if Dean was his last life line, the only thing keeping him from drowning, his body shaking violently as he slung his long arms around Dean, holding him close.
Dean paused and looked at his brother incredulously. “Because the Demon knows we’re in Salvation, all right? It knows we got the Colt. It’s got Dad – it’s probably coming for us next.”
“Shut your cakehole, short stuff. I brought coffee.” The effect of those words was astonishing. Within seconds, Adam was out of bed snatching one of the cups from his hands, while Cas, slowly but surely, made his way to the table.
“Watch out for yourself kiddo.”
For a split of a second, Dean actually forgot his anger and stared at the railway lines in front of him with a mixture of awe and horror. Samuel Colt had been a genius. The lines were massive and made of pure iron and there was no way any Demon could cross them. Except Sam wasn’t a Demon.
“I never asked for his help until it was too late.”
“Yes, yes I heard I about that.” Baker nodded. “Very sad. But I can assure you, I had nothing to do that. Hundreds and thousands of people come to this park.”
Fortunately, no one came to check on him, so Dean spent the next hours alone on the hood of his car, staring at the driveway of the Roadhouse.
“You could have died,” Cas retorted.
“You’re welcome.” Eileen winked at him, a smile tugging on her lips. “Now get back to work.”
Greg McQueen and his family lived just a few houses from the Serendels but when Dean rang the doorbell no one answered. With a shrug, he turned around again and made his way back to the motel. He still couldn’t get the girl out of his head. The way she had stared.
It was a long walk and all there was to see was flat land covered in grass but Dean wasn’t paying attention to his surroundings. His thoughts were with Sam. His little brother. The man he had raised and who had become a stranger somewhere along the way. It hurt. Up until now, Dean hadn’t even realized just how much because there had still been hope. Hope that Sam was alive and save. Now? Now Sam was out to do something stupid and probably get himself killed in the process and for what? To keep Dean safe from whatever threat was out there? To revenge their mum and Jess? To get his life back together? The changes had been obvious over the months leading up to dad’s death – to
Something passed over Cas’ face, like a smile but infinitely sadder. “Because you were about to leave without saying goodbye.”
“Mum! Mum!” Jo came running in, screaming, and when she saw Dean she stopped dead, gaping at him.
“Fuck,” was all Jo said.
“Sam?” Dean turned to his brother who had made no attempt to get out of the chair yet, his face pale and wet with tears.
The next morning came and the sun seemed to shine just a little bit brighter and a little bit warmer through the curtains into their motel room. Dean lay awake in bed, listening to the steady rhythm of Adam’s and Cas’ breathing. Eventually, Dean got out of bed to get some breakfast.
“Yes.”
Before Dean could think about it properly he had fled the motel room and gotten into the Impala.
“But not everyone.” Sam thought of the pictures and how many people would only ever be seen smiling again because they were immortalized on a piece of paper, thought of his mum and his dad and everyone he’d lost, everyone who’d left.
“Phew, I’m not scared.” Except he was. He had put so much effort into hiding his relationship with Cas that it terrified him to think, John might find out.
“Yeah.” Matt nodded and that was good enough for Dean. “Thanks, again.”
Sam tried opening the door, but it wouldn’t move.
“I am too. Seems like we’re after the same thing. Again.” Dean snorted contemptuously. “I can tell you where they’re hiding out. I didn’t come here because of that.”
He helped Ben with studying for his SATs and college applications and gently stirred him away from all things law after Ben had started grilling him about being lawyer.
No one to help you, nobody cares about you
“He’s your half-brother!” Jo yelled behind him and Dean froze.
“What the hell are you doing Sam?” he demanded. Sam still wasn’t looking at them.
The line went dead and Dean groaned. What had he done?
Sam hadn’t even noticed the older man come over, but there he was, grim as ever with the familiar hint of kindness buried deep in his eyes.
“For dying, I guess.” Dean gave a crooked smile and when he saw Cas rolling his eyes he was a bit proud of himself.
. Adam actually has a chance, Cas.”
“You save Monsters?” Sam asked slowly, just to make sure he’d gotten that right and fighting hard to keep the incredulity out of his voice. He wasn’t sure he’d succeeded.
“Hah!” Claire pointed an accusatory finger at Dean, “I knew you were vain.”
“Anything?”
“Doesn’t matter. I’m going to Lincoln.”
Chris was tall and skinny, his hair was tousled and his clothes ripped and dirty
Cas turned his head in surprise. “How is this your fault?” he asked incredulously.
“What do you mean?” Cas asked innocently from across the room.
“I’m sorry about her,” said Eileen, genuinely sounding like she meant it.
Having a good night’s rest, was refreshing.
Sam was acutely aware that his plan of hiding away wouldn’t work forever, but he was going to stick it out as long as possible, if only it meant he got five minutes where he could pretend everything was fine. That was perhaps the trickiest part. His brain wouldn’t shut up. He thought of his dad and how disappointed he’d be. In Sam. In Dean. In everything that had happened these past 15 years. He thought of Dean, alone and hurt, ready to lie down and give up everything, thought of himself safe and sound in Stanford, not knowing what was going on.
“Well, we do. We stick together. No one goes out alone. We do things differently around here. Some don’t agree with that, those people usually don’t stick around.”
“Doc, please tell me you can tell if he’s infected or not.”
Dean stared at Bobby. His surrogate father. The man that supported and accepted him, no matter what and if there were tears filling Dean’s eyes, neither of them said anything.
“Jane?”
“Dean?” he groaned, “Sam?”
“What?”
“I’m okay.” Dean forced out, his forehead pressed against the cold tiles.
“Can’t tell. County Sheriff called, said that somethin’s going on.”
“Let’s go home,” he muttered before pulling back and he saw the relief on Sam’s face before he turned around and went back towards their cars.
He thought frantically.
“So what, you're just going to pick up a ringer at a pawn shop?”
Was there anyone in this damn town who didn’t know who he was?
“Piece of work, that one was,” she’d told them, “But he always payed his tap.”
Sam thought of the people in his office, of George who always ate the last donut, of Fiona who always complained about her in-laws, of Will who never got the promotion she so desperately wanted, and he felt nothing.
“But you did,” Sam said, thankful that the conversation was moving on from John Winchester, “You stuck around. Why?”
“He declined.”
Sam nodded, ignoring the bitterness settling in his gut. “What happened to him?”
“Huh.”
“I just told you, Sammy,” Dean snapped back. He was on edge and the second he saw Sam flinch, he regretted raising his voice. This wasn’t Sam’s fault. “Sorry.”
“Is he going to be alright?” he asked the doctor.
“Ben?” Sam prompted gently and Dean let out a sigh.
“I’m sorry, you know,” Cas muttered.
“I know. I know you were just trying help, but – but you can’t keep taking people. Or killing them.”
“Then start acting like it!” Dean snapped, ripping open the door to the Impala, “Now, get in the damn car.” His face was hard and impossible to read, a storm brewing behind his eyes, and Sam decided that it was probably best to simply do as he was told.
“Jo is a tough girl, I’m sure she’ll be alright.”
“There’s a cut on his back,” Phil reported after examining Chris.
“Hello?”
“Crap!”
“What did she mean?” Dean whispered urgently, “Bragging about your secrets to strangers in bars?”
“Dean?” Sam asked again. It certainly looked like his brother. He was older than Sam remembered him to be, which really shouldn’t have come as a surprise and yet it was. In Sam’s mind, Dean was still barely old enough to drink, a cheeky smirk on his lips while he practically drowned in their dad’s leather jacket. The man standing before Sam now was not that. There were deep lines etched into Dean’s forehead, crow’s feet surrounding his eyes, and the odd grey streak running through his hair.
After the disaster in Indiana, they purposefully avoided the big Hunts, easing Adam into the Life with simple Salt’n’Burns or the occasional Cursed object and Adam was learning fast. Too fast, for Dean’s taste.
Dean was absolutely and utterly speechless. Did Lisa really think that’s what he was there for? To continue something that had ended 11 years ago?
“You’re right,” his brother conceded, “And you know where that got me? A hospital. Now I’ve been sober for 5 years. I’m not that person anymore.”
There was more, Sam could tell. Things Dean wasn’t saying. Things, Sam wasn’t even sure he wanted to know about, not right now, anyway. It was all a lot to take in as it was.
It was a solid plan, but Sam also couldn’t quite suppress the hint of disappointment he felt when they turned their back on the cabin to make the hike back to civilization.
“Yet, he didn’t help you?”
“Dean?”
For a moment, Lisa didn’t say anything, just gaped at him before realization seeped into her face.
“Yeah, yeah…” he muttered and peeked over the stone towards the door, “Shit.”
“I’m okay, Dean,” Cas finally muttered.
“What?” The incomprehension in John’s voice seemed genuine, still Dean shook his head
“Four minutes,” Cas replied smugly, “I’m still better than you.”
“He quit when he married.”
There was that expression on Dean’s face again, disbelieving and hurt. “You got out, man,” he pointed out, “You had a life. What? You think I’d just drag you away from that? ‘sides, you made it clear you wanted nothing to do with me.”
Dean gulped, his tongue feeling way too big for his mouth, “Dad,” he started, “Dead, he – he’s dead, Sammy. He made a deal. And he’s dead.”
Sam gave a sharp nod to signify he understood, though he couldn’t deny his nerves growing more and more fluttery. This was different. Before, with their father, they’d aimed to kill. Always. But this was different.
“Well, technically –” Cas began but Dean cut him off, “Not helping, Cas!” he snapped but again, he knew Cas was right.
“In his office I think, er, in the main building.”
The town itself was…idyllic. Literal white picket fences in front of picturesque houses with front gardens and judgemental neighbours.
“No,” he answered decisively.
he thought,
“Dean?” Cas muttered groggily. “Wha’s going on?”
“You know that’s not gonna fix anything, right?” Dean asked with a nod at the whiskey, and something inside of Sam snapped.
Sam nodded, carefully trying to wrap his head around yet another side of his brother that he’d never known existed.
“What –” Sam began but stopped himself. Did he even want to know?
“Yeah but for how long?” Dean questioned, “What happens when she figures it out?”
“I can’t stop you from leaving, if that’s what you want to do,” Cas added, a softness on his face that Sam wasn’t sure what to make of, “But I am asking you to at least wait until Dean wakes up to tell you himself.”
“I can’t.”
“Matt.”
Sam couldn’t see who it was, but he heard the heavy footsteps slowly coming closer, kicking over one of the empty bottles on the floor, and a low grumble that sounded like Bobby.
“Alright.”
A few days later they got back on the road to pay a visit to Missouri Moseley. Sam seemed a little bit better now or maybe he just started hiding it better…Dean wasn’t all too sure. It was weird…they used to be so close, used to be able to read each other like open books, but somewhere during the past 7 years that had gotten lost and now, when Dean looked at his brother, all he saw was a stranger with little Sammy’s face.
Sam didn’t quite notice falling into a fitful slumber, stuck between being fully awake and fully asleep, but when he opened his eyes again, it was much brighter outside, the lights in the hut were off, and Dean was on the phone.
“Is that him?” he muttered, “The one I –”
“So, how’ve you been?” he asked, trying to break the tension.
“Not your fault.”
Cas looked over in alert at the sound of his name, questions clearly written on his face, but Dean was faster.
Half an hour later Sam was standing outside the hospital, waiting for Dean to come back out. He felt strange. Fragile, somehow, but in a surprisingly good way.
“Someone’s gonna get in touch with you soon,” Dean said, “Someone who’s gone through the same thing you have. Someone you can talk to. They’re gonna help you. But you can’t talk to the police, ‘cause they probably won’t believe you.”
“My apologies.” Cas seemed like he had nothing to add to that, so Dean let it go.
Dean shook his head. “Too risky,” he countered, “Let’s go to the motel, suit up, then come back and stake it out first before we do anything stupid.”
“Come on,” Dean stood up to get rid of the memories, “It’s getting dark and we should get going.”
Ben nodded, seemingly satisfied, and Sam could hear a soft sigh coming from Cas, just as Dean and Clair re-entered the room, carrying plates of pancakes.
“The way you always knew that Monsters are real?” Dean remembered.
“I have the Colt,” John admitted.
At the hospital, Cas let them get out of the car before he himself went “looking for a place to crash”; Dean wasn’t sure how he felt about the distance Cas was obviously creating but that was something he was going to deal with at a later point.
“About what?” Dean asked, taken aback.
Inhale.
“We’re here.”
” The voice on the other end sounded young and somewhat familiar, and for a moment, Dean stopped.
“Dammit.” he cursed and ran towards his brother. Or at least he tried to.
“Yeah?” There was a moment of silence in which Bobby listened and it was obvious that he didn’t like what he was hearing, his lips pressed together in a thin line, his eyes hard. “Balls! Alright, we’re on our way.” He put the phone away before looking directly at Dean. “That was Ellen,” he explained, “Good news and bad. We might know where Sam is but he is probably about to do something really stupid.”
“And we’re sure it was the same thing?” Bobby questioned.
“So, what’s the plan here?” he asked his father.
“That was rude, Sammy,” the Demon said, “And here I was thinking we became such good friends…I mean…we’re practically family. And I know how you feel about family. So loyal, even now. But I know you’re stronger than that, Sam. You’re stronger than your brother. You don’t need him, you never did.”
” a rough voice sounded through the line, so painfully familiar it might as well have come straight out of Sam’s memories.
“Come here, son,” the old man said when he saw Dean standing in the door, “Your angel of a boyfriend reminded me that I need to grind off my edges once in a while,” he chuckled lightly, “You know that you’re like a son to me, right? I love you to bits, boy. You, Cas, an’ your brother, ‘cause you’re family and I’ll be damned if I let anything happen to ya. I’m proud of you, Dean.”
“Presumably.”
“The blood,” the Demon whispered, “The pain. Seeing them suffer. It’s who you are, Sam,” he continued.
“And what would you say, if I told you that he knew what would happen? That he could have stopped it, but he didn’t.”
“It’s never easy for a child to lose a parent,” Dean reminded them but his thoughts were somewhere else completely.
?” He really hadn’t meant to put that much emphasis on that last word, but couldn’t help himself, really.
“Sam?” Sam looked up at the sound of his name, seeing Eileen give him a worried look. “Are you okay?”
“Stop embarrassing me and get the table,” Dean told the man though he sounded amused and fond.
Dean twisted his neck so he could see where Cas was and spotted his boyfriend still sitting in the car, observing them with an unreadable expression.
Dean still remembered the small church with its colourful windows and the organ in the back; remembered the hours he and Sam had spent there and the care with which the pastor and Hunter had looked after them.
“Well I did.”
, Dean.”
.” And then the line went dead.
“What about the blood?” Adam asked and both Cas and Dean turned towards the younger man.
“Alright,” Dean sighed and sat down, “Tell us about the case.”
And it wasn’t fair.
They were all looking at him, even Adam.
“You’re welcome, Dean.” Cas smirked at him before offering his hand to help Dean up.
“Dean, please –” Sam’s voice broke and Dean finally looked at him, seeing the tears in his eyes and although he was fucking furious he also felt like a huge weight had just been lifted from his shoulders because they were together again. A family. They would face whatever was coming their way and they would do it brilliantly.
He didn’t turn around to see if Adam was doing what he was told but he heard steps and then a door slamming shut. The old lady was dead, and Dean quickly turned around to check on Cas and Sam except it wasn’t Cas standing side by side with his brother but Ruby who was holding a bloody knife, behind them, on the floor, lay Kate. Dead.
“Yeah, yeah, I know,” he grumbled, his eyes fixed on Sam, wary and appraising as if he wasn’t sure what to think before his face smoothed over, “Sam.”
, Dean agreed silently,
Again, Sam wanted to argue, but the thing was, he couldn’t. One of the few perks of being raised by John Winchester was that he’d learned very early on how to disappear without a trace, a skill he had used almost immediately after arriving at Stanford. He hadn’t wanted to be found, not by anyone, especially not by his family.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Adam,” Jo repeated, “He’s your half-brother.”
Nodding slowly, Bobby drank his coffee and was obviously lost in thought.
John kept walking. “You shouldn’t’ve come here,” he snapped at the youngest Winchester.
“He also has a choice,” Cas argues calmly, “He’s 20 years old and if he wants to Hunt, then that is what he should do. You and Sam, you’re the only family he has left and he looks up to you, Dean. He accepted you as his big brother the minute he saw you. He trusts you. At least try and give him a bit of trust in return. He’s not Sam, Dean.”
“Andrea Holley, my brother’s girlfriend.”
“What did Bobby say? Yesterday?” He wasn’t even sure he wanted to know but maybe he had to. This was Sam they were talking about.
“It’s happening again,” Sam exclaimed in panic, “Something’s gonna kill Roger Miller.”
he knew that Gordon might have been telling the truth.
“Wha – No!” he exclaimed, “God, no! Just –”
It was time to leave.
“I only did what I had to do to keep my family safe.”
“What’s weird? What happened, Matt?” Cas asked, leaning forward slightly to give the boy his full attention.
And Sam had no idea how to answer.
“I checked,” Cas announced, “There’s no one here. They’re all just…vanished.”
Eyes closed, Dean took a deep breath and ran his hand through his hair, trying to stay calm.
“Where is he taking her?” he whispered.
“World’s gotten a lot bigger,” Dean answered with a shrug.
“You okay, kiddo?” he asked his half-brother.
“Oh, you know…I was in the neighbourhood and I couldn’t resist,” he lied.
Dean was out of the car before Sam could object, giving Benny a hug and the woman a nod.
“Who are you?” he managed to croak out around his dry throat.
With a soft sigh, Sam pushed himself up and got dressed, leaving the borrowed clothes on the foot of the bed and giving the room one last once over before slipping out. Dean had said the kitchen was to the right, and Sam remembered the kitchen being near the War Room, which meant the exit was close.
“Then why did you come?”
Sam wasn’t entirely clear on where exactly they were going. When asked, all Bobby had said was “home” as he drove them out of town to where the fields gave way to forest, and Sam was reminded that he didn’t even know where Bobby lived these days. Or Dean.
The visit itself was disappointing to say the least. A grieving wife and a traumatized son was never much to go on and not finding any signs of anything really didn’t exactly make it easier.
“Yes.”
“Yeah.”
But he didn’t have a home. He’d never had a home. Always the odd one out, always the new kid in town. The freak with a knife collection.
“I just want to go home,” she whispered.
Next to him, Dean tensed. “You’d be surprised,” he said, “Not everyone’s a fan of what we do here. We learned to be careful.”
“So,” he started, “You have a kid?”
“And say what? ‘Hey Max, we’ve been wondering, did you kill any of your relatives lately ‘cause they beat the shit out of you?’” Dean mocked, naturally, Sam did not look impressed.
“Bobby hasn’t lived here in years,” she answered, crossing her arms firmly over her chest, “Why do you need him?”
“You’re a better man than dad ever was.”
Finding the actual entrance was easy and Dean soon found himself at the top of a flight of stairs; the air was cold and dry and Dean raised the flash light to see better. The bare stone walls were surprisingly smooth, the stairs, even. Someone had invested a lot of time in these tunnels.
“Sometimes I wonder what I’m even doing, ya know? Hunting Monsters. It’s crazy, isn’t it? Hell, seeing Lisa again and meeting Ben…it got me thinking…what do I leave behind? Cause sooner or later I’ll bite the dust and what’s left of me then?”
The third night, the third bottle, the third day.
“Well, this is it…he was upstairs and must have tripped.” Hannah made a vague gesture with a hand towards the stairs they were standing in front of and Dean nodded.
“Of course, Dean.” Cas gave a curt nod, turning towards the computer, his fingers immediately click-clacking away on the keyboard to, presumably, pull up any information he could find on the town and Vampires in the area.
“What I don’t understand is, why. Why would Demons burn down the Roadhouse?” he asked, waiting for Ellen to answer.
The sheriff hummed and Sam could feel her watching him. “What’s your name?”
It was raining when they arrived at the cemetery where Jess was buried. Dean and Cas got out of the car, walking through the lines of headstones towards Jess’ grave; there was no one around but Dean immediately saw the fresh flowers on the ground.
“Ethical differences. He didn’t agree with my methods.”
“I – er – I ditched my phone,” Sam admitted sheepishly.
The creak of a floor board had Dean turn around and suddenly he was looking down on a Creepy Little Girl. The kind you found in horror movies. The kind that made you think twice if you really wanted children. Dean was surprised how different this child looked to the one in the photos.
A whimper sounded from next to Dean and when he turned to look he saw the little girl crouching on the floor, hugging her knees and crying. He saw movement from the corner of his eye, Sam stepping forward, his gun aimed at the girl and -
“He’s not dad,” Dean repeated.
“What? Lost your sense of humor, Cas?” Dean mocked the other Hunter, “Oh yeah, glare at me. Always gets me all hot and bothered.”
“She’s fine,” he said, “They see each other most weekends and on holidays.”
“Take as long as you need?” Sam echoed Dean’s words, mocking them, “Whatever happened to suck it up and quit being such a girl?”
Claire looked incredulously from Cas to Eileen and back to Cas before letting out a scoff and storming off.
Sam opened his mouth to say something, anything, defend himself, maybe, because Dean wasn’t being fair, it hadn’t been like that, it –
Cas gave another nod, turning around to refill his own coffee before leaving the kitchen without another word.
. He was just about to call back when he saw the Impala rolling up the driveway. There was a crease of worry between Cas’ eyes when he walked towards Dean but only for a moment before he smiled.
But Dean?
“Their loss if they miss it,” Dean replied with a shrug, finally turning to face the rest of the kitchen, “Cas, Eileen, this Sam, my brother. Sam, Cas and Eileen.” He was making hand gestures while was talking, sign language, Sam realized with no small amount of surprise.
Cas sighed before continuing, “Apparently, Steve Wandell was an old friend of your mum. Johnny Campbell was a distant relative of her and if you just look deep enough, you’ll find that any person that has ever known your mother, is dead. Family, friends, colleagues.”
and –
“Non-humans,” Eileen supplied and Sam nodded his head, “Maybe at first,” she answered, “I was raised a Hunter, much like you, and it took some adjustment to get over that, but –” She hesitated, signing something Sam couldn’t understand, before saying out loud, “—It’s worth it.”
“Alright then,” Dean muttered and started walking towards the trees, “Let’s –”
“Well, good on you,” Dean snapped, “Remind me to give you a fucking medal when this is over.”
“He lost his family. His life. Of course, he’s not coping that well. But at least he’s got you.”
“Now.”
Dean watched as Lisa’s eyes grew wide, her mouth opening for…something, before she snapped it shut and apparently got herself back under control.
Sam behind the wheel, Dean in the passenger seat, and Benny in the back, Sam started the engine and smiled.
“Dean? Damn, son, it’s been a while.”
It wasn’t a long drive.
“Hospital,” Dean instructed before bringing his attention back to his brother who still seemed to be mostly out of it.
“Can I –” Sam trailed off, indicating at one of the reading tables.
One look at clock on the wall told Sam that it was barely 6 in the morning, early enough for the others to still be asleep, for Dean to still be asleep.
“I left.”
“The right conclusion,” Cas pointed out, “The problem was your reaction to it.”
“We didn’t know what it meant. It started out as nightmares and now I get them when I’m awake and the closer I get to anything involving the Demon, the stronger they get,” he explained.
His brother let out a sound that fell somewhere between a hysteric laugh and a sob. “World’s gotten a lot bigger,” he said again, instead of actually telling Sam something useful, “I found the Demon, I killed the Demon. It’s dead.” There was more, Sam could tell. Dean was looking at him, considering him for a long moment, before adding, “So’s dad.”
“No one’s killing anyone,” Dean said firmly and to prove his point he put his gun away.
“Argh, son of a –”
Sam made a mental note to take a look at that database if he had the chance, but for now he merely nodded his head and went back to work.
“All victims were in some kind of relationship,” Cas began, “But there’s no real connection between them.” He pointed at one of the pictures and continued, “Ferhad and Hayley Baitan,” he explained, “Both used to be Hunters but then Hayley got pregnant and they moved here. Ferhad worked at the local bar as a bartender, James Jayden was a lawyer, Jack Serendel was a tax accountant and Greg McQueen owned a bookshop.”
“Anything. Something.”
“Probably, but –“”
Right. Dean. Sam had done his best to not think about him or his strange behavior the day before, or anything.
“Vampires,” Dean clarified, and Fiona flinched at the word, “We know you took those two kids from the hospital. We know you Turned them.”
“Sam’s not a killer,” Dean whispered frantically.
“Yes. Theology.”
“Where are you going?” Sam asked while Dean grabbed his duffle bag
“Dean! Dean, no!” Sam’s voice was a million miles away, the only thing that was real was the blood spilling out of his mouth and the numbness spreading in his head. It was the Demon’s power that held him upright against the wall, its will that kept him barely alive and he wanted to scream and beg and shout, he wanted to tell his father that he was sorry but no sound came out of his mouth.
“Cas. Cas look at me,” he demanded and his boyfriend slowly raised his head, meeting Dean’s eyes, “I’m right here. I’m alive and I’m
“Road’s closed,” he announced.
“That was avoidable. But you didn’t think, just like you weren’t thinking today.” Cas dropped his hands and slowly walked towards Dean. “I meant what I said, Dean. If you want out, I’ll be there with you.”
, it said, alongside
Dean was startled by the last sentence because, yeah, maybe, he might’ve, sorta projected something there. But he still stood by what he had said, he didn’t it that Adam was so eager to step in his father’s footsteps. But Cas did have a point.
Kate grabbed him from behind, her hand pressed on his mouth while two of the men held his arms. They were strong, much stronger than him but it was too late anyway because of course, Cas had heard him and seconds later a bright light entered the room and he could see Cas and Adam standing there, eyes wide, both of them holding guns.
“Hey, Cas,” Dean croaked once their lips had parted, “Fancy seeing you here.”
“Dean?” Cas’ tone told him that Cas had said his name several times already.
Sam nodded. “Thanks,” he said, “For letting me stay here.”
“Maybe I found something.” Cas appeared in the door, holding a stash of newspapers in one hand and something that looked like dirt in the other. “There have been strange deaths over the past few weeks,” he explained, handing the newspapers to Dean. “Hillary Johnton, drowned in a lake nearby, she used to be a member of the swimming club. Keiron Winter, alcohol poisoning, although he’d been sober for ten years. Michal Piszczek, suffocated in his own bed, his body showed signs of struggle. I’m not sure of course, but these might be connected.”
Dean thought but he couldn’t bring himself to say that. It was too much. Too personal. “Don’t know,” he answered instead, standing up to get his third beer of the night. “I guess I grew up.” Which was true as well. He was by far not the man anymore he had been at 22.
“Hello Ellen,” he said, “No. I haven’t seen her in months.”
. “You did good. With Claire and Ben.”
Exhale.
Sam blinked once more, staring at Eileen who smiled back at him with just enough of an edge to make Sam think that there was some kind of plan being out in motion here.
“What about Ash?” Cas asked.
Dean flashed his batch at the girl sitting at the entrance.
“What?”
“What the hell?” Dean breathed out and got of the car quickly. He took in the scene before his eyes; black, charred pieces of wood and molten metal was all that had remained of the bar. He exchanged a look with Cas, checking if he was okay, if he could deal with this because this had been the closest Cas had ever gotten to a home after his parents had died and Dean knew exactly what it felt like to lose that. The blankness of the other man’s face, the hard look in his eyes, nearly broke Dean’s heart.
great.
“It’s not from the city, the man I spoke to said it had to come from somewhere more rural,” Cas explained.
Did I ever mention how much I hate Witches?
“Hope ya’ll are hungry, ‘cause there’s a lot,” the older Winchester announced, not noticing, or perhaps not caring, about the tension hanging over the map table like a particularly thick cloud.
“Quarantine,” the man answered.
“Please, state your name for the court.”
“Yes,” Lisa answered slowly, apparently confused by the question.
“Why?”
“I’ve been living in California for the past 15 years,” Sam offered. Jody nodded her head and didn’t ask any further. She’d been right, though – the silence was awkward. “Bobby says you’re a Hunter?”
Dean chuckled slightly, dry and doubtful. “So everyone keeps telling me.”
“You’re scared.” It wasn’t a question and Dean didn’t respond. He couldn’t. Not in front of all this people, so instead he just glared at her. “You know Cas, he’ll be fine.”
“Come in. Ben’s asleep.”
“Good.” Dean kneeled in front Emma and Sam quickly followed his example. “We’ll take you to the hospital,” the older Winchester said, “But first you need to listen to me, okay?”
“Maybe, or y’know, sometimes people just die,” Dean replied tired, knowing perfectly well that he was being unreasonable.
,” a very familiar voice prompted.
“You boys grew up handsome,” she remarked before her eyes shifted to Cas and narrowed, “You shouldn’t be here.”
“Yes. You think there is a connection?” Cas asked.
Through a door at the end of the room, he thought he could see rows and rows of bookshelves, but Bobby turned right, into a hallway and Sam began to understand why it was called the Bunker. The walls seemed to be concrete and there were no windows in sight. They were underground.
“She always takes the night shifts,” she told them, “But I’ve barely seen her since they found Michael’s body.”
Dean swallowed while Madison’s ghost appeared behind the chair, looking just as he remembered her.
Dean sighed, all the energy leaving his body. “What he said.”
, he thought desperately,
“Well, yes, because there were two raging psychopaths on the loose, who are dead now so I decided it’d be safe to come out.” Adam flashed him a self-satisfied smirk that reminded him very much of himself.
“I know that,” Sam quickly defended himself, “It’s just – it’s not fair! I tried, Bobby. I really did. I only wanted to be normal for once, but everyone just keeps leaving!” Sam let out a heavy breath, a little shaky on the tail-end, while Bobby simply looked at him for a long moment before giving Benny a gesture and the man behind the bar hurried over with another soda. Sam wondered distantly if Bobby had quit drinking as well. It seemed even more unlikely than for Dean.
“This is my fault, Cas,” Dean said in a low voice.
“You tell me, kiddo. It was your idea to come here, after all,” Dean teased; he could practically feel Cas’ eyeroll behind his back. “Anyway, the eyewitness that saw Julian and Harry in the park works at a fast food joint around here and saw them around 1 p.m.” Dean skipped from one camera to another until he found said joint and began rewinding the video.
“He is,” she answered, growing more and more serious as she gave him a long, lingering look, “It’s not always doom and gloom, Sam,” she added, “Sure, it kinda sucks and sometimes I wish I didn’t know what was out there, but it’s what you make of all that, and I made a family that looks out for each other.”
“Hey Cas. Adam.” He grabbed himself a beer before joining them but all the way he could feel Cas’ gaze on him. “What is it?” he asked and sat down.
“Yes.” Cas nodded. “Ben. A bright boy. Huge ACDC fan. You’d like him.”
She wasn’t home. Obviously, she wasn’t home. Sam tried to remember if she’d said anything else, had any plans to go out with friends, but there was nothing. Letting out a sigh, Sam walked over to the table, picking up the menu to one of their go-to take-out places on the way. It was late and he was tired and not particularly in the mood for cooking. That’s when he saw it. There, on the table, was a letter, a letter with his name on it.
The girl looked up hopefully when they entered. “Hey, Cas.”
“EMF is negative,” Sam explained after he had checked all the rooms, after leaving Missouri, he had curled up on the backseat of the Impala and not said a single word on their way to see Matt but now he seemed…normal. Focused. It worried Dean that he had no fucking clue what was going on his brother’s head.
“I didn’t send you a text, Dean.” John shook his head.
Exhale.
“You okay?” he asked with a side glance at Sam.
“What’ya reading?”
“I don’t know man, it’s been like almost a year since dad went missing. You’d think we would have found him by now,” Dean sighed, taking a right turn.
He gestured for Charlie to bring him another drink and told her to leave the bottle; drunk or not, it clearly wasn’t enough. He could feel Dean’s eyes on him, the weight of it sending a strange wave of annoyance through his system.
“Thanks, Cas.”
“Dean,” Sam said slowly, looking up at his brother, “These are spell books.”
“I know.” And he did. It wasn’t that he regretted anything, just that, for the first time, he was actually confronted with his love ‘em, leave ‘em attitude he used to have going. Lisa glared at him but Dean couldn’t wait any longer,. He had to know.
There’s people inside. Dean could see a man in his mid-thirties sitting on the floor, next to him was an old woman, holding the hand of a little girl. Another women was praying in the corner. But what was far more interesting was that Sam seemed to know these people.
As if on cue, in that moment, the kid came running towards his mother and Dean was shocked to see how different he was. His eyes were exclusive fixed on Lisa and there was a hunger in his eyes. “Make them go away, mummy. I don’t like them here,” He almost whined.
, Sam thought sluggishly, though he couldn’t muster up the energy to actually do something about it.
Is the ending a bit rushed? Absolutely! Do I care? Not particularly...
“Fucking finally!” Dean exclaimed when he answered the phone. They had just left the town when Cas called.
without any influence of John’s upbringing, agreed. The world was a colourful place.
“A lot of people who wouldn’t have survived without you. You’re a good man, Dean Winchester. And I don’t say that because you ‘Hunt Monsters’, I don’t even say it because you’re my boyfriend. I say it, because you only do what you believe is right and that’s all that matters.” Cas hesitated for a second. “And if you wanted to quit. Get out of the Life…I’d be there with you.”
“We need to go.”
“Where’s dad?” he slurred.
Dean wasn’t sure how long Cas and Bobby spoke since he tuned it out at some point, concentrating on the road ahead and the music coming from the radio.
They both got up and Dean cut his brother lose so they could make a quick exit and kill the Shapeshifter that had taken them, on their way out.
“Hello?” he asked.
“Dean?” Both Sam and Dean snapped around to look at Cas, standing in the door, clutching his mug, and looking deeply confused. “What happened?”
Maybe it was Bobby’s words, or maybe the slight tremor in his voice at the memory of nearly loosing Dean, but Sam finally turned his head to look at the older man sitting at the desk.
do that again!”
He stood in the middle of the Roadhouse, staring dumbfoundedly at Jo.
Isn’t it strange how in a situation of shock, the human brain can simply refuse to take in information?
, his dad had yelled at him,
“That’d be something new,” Dean muttered but stepped away anyway because it was way more likely to attract attention if he let Gordon stand outside. The other man came in, his hands slightly raised so Dean could see them; he was moving cautiously, well aware that Cas had a gun pointed at him and that he wouldn’t hesitate to pull the trigger when needed. Gordon’s eyes fell on Adam and for a second he seemed confused but he didn’t say anything, instead he turned back to Dean who fixed him with a glare.
“Hi.”
“Lisa?” Dean groaned into the phone. It was the middle of the night and he was still half asleep. He heard a sob at the other end of the line. “Lisa are you okay?” he asked, suddenly wide awake.
“Lenore?” he asked, just to be sure.
“He didn’t.”
“You’re not sure?” Sam repeated slowly, “How can you not be sure?”
“How do you kill a Demon? I didn’t think it was possible?”
who nodded in confirmation, just as a small figure with long blonde hair came into the room and Dean could only just stop himself before he would have shot her.
Cas smiled, it was a real smile, full emotions that Dean couldn’t even distinguish, there was sadness and happiness, relieve and adoration and so much love.
“Right.” Sam drew out the word, glancing back and forth between Charlie and Jody, hoping to get some kind of explanation. None came. “Uhm – Nice to meet you?” he said, though even to his own ears it sounded more like a question than a statement.
Looking at Ben was like looking into a mirror. Sort of. Ben had dark hair like his mother but everything else…the Metallica shirt, the leather jacket, the overcompensating-macho-act, the fricking
