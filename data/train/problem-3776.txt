Snatching his hand back he pulled away, curling his fingers into a fist, trying to push away the echo of the warmth that he had felt, the lingering memory of the pulse. Grabbing his duffle bag, still lying at the foot of the bed, he threw it over his shoulder, heading for the door.
"Dean!"
Shaking his head, he unzipped his pants and pulled them off, suppressing a groan at the pressure against his engorged flesh, and the freedom once the material was removed. He pulled off his underwear too, and watched with mild curiosity as the offending appendage bounced slightly, the air cool around it.
It was all rolling around in Dean’s head while he was just trying to get some fucking shut eye. It was their legacy. Their grandfather, not the douchebag they’d met but the one who abandoned their Dad, had been part of some agency or something, the Men of Letters. Dean and Sam vaguely remembered the name, some old hunting legend they’d heard over the years but never put much stock in, something long since destroyed, defunct or lost, one way or another. Except Cas said all the members were killed in the late 50s, including their Grandfather. That’s why he never returned home.
He’s seen how Dean responds to questions like this, the brush off, the determination to present everything as
Dean turned off the heat on the pan, turning, ready to serve up. “As we’ll ever be.”
He blinked his eyes open a little more, carefully, as he took in the light in the room. Slowly does it.
Dean turned around, looking back to the man in the bed. "Nothing?"
“Oh.” Dean nodded again. But, he’s a glutton for punishment. “But… you and Meg? And, the, uh,” He glanced over, cocking an eyebrow. “The pizza man?”
"Finally." Dean said, looking down at the head in his lap. "I need to stretch my legs."
He called, and Cas shook his head.
Castiel looked to Gabriel, then back to Anna. Their eyes fixed, and while he didn't say anything, couldn't get the words out, she knew. The look of love there. They had been family and soldiers together for years before they betrayed each other in turn; now was not the time for grudges.
"So I called Missouri."
Cas froze, almost certain now of what he had feared.
"Enochian. Yeah." Sam agreed. "It does."
"How come you get to talk to the hot wife?" Dean huffed.
"Doesn't hurt. Well..." He commented, grinning to his friend as he stepped out of the car. "It does, but you'll be fine."
He straightened up, watching.
"At the time, a little." Cas explained. "Leviticus was written more as a guideline for the society. Rules and laws that made sense at the time, but don't any more. Homosexuality tied in with 'go forth and multiply', but with overpopulation as it is, it's no longer an issue." He looked up at Dean. "As you are neither Jewish nor born three and a half thousand years ago, you don't need to worry about it."
A woman's voice greeted him, and he blearily looked up. He groaned and automatically reached behind him, grabbing for his gun. She grabbed his arm, her sober strength a little overpowering against his swaying drunkness.
She opened the door behind her as Dean pressed her against the car, the cool metal pressing hard against her back. He ran his hands down her sides, plucking at the material, searching for warm skin beneath. Scooping his hands down beneath the fabric he found skin and scratched gently up her waist, making her shiver. Nuzzling into his neck, she chuckled.
Dean groaned at the concept. The amount of monsters they’d killed, who one day probably would be seen as a casualty. “Shit.”
“Things change. Namely, Leviathan.” He looked between them again, taking in the expressions before him; surprise, suspicion, impatience. “Not easy guys to make a deal with, so far, pretty impossible. I thought they might make good allies, figured serving your heads on a platter might make a good offering. No dice.”
. Dean jolted backwards, stumbling over his feet, and his eyes were wide, dark, he was breathing heavily.
"Yeah, great, Dean." Sam said. "But we have to plan this. She notices you, plans dead. She can mojo the arrow out of the way."
Castiel's face lost its smile, and his head tilted to the left. "What's the matter? Don;t you think you deserve to be saved?" His eyes were wide, the blue searching Dean's soul.
"I'm plenty talkative if you're tipping well enough." The man grunted.
He started stroking his hand up and down the outline of Dean’s dick, and a whimper escaped his chest, pinned there under Cas’s determined ministrations. He wasn’t gonna come like this, just a hand over the clothes, not even fucking reciprocating, he wasn’t, but his head lolled back against the wall and he groaned when Cas upped the ante, started grinding, and then started kissing against Dean’s neck. And when Cas’s hand skimmed along his ribs, finding a nipple again and rubbed it, flicked it, Dean gripped Cas’s waist and bit down on his lip
(See the end of the chapter for
“You know Dad took me to a worker once?” Dean laughed, remembering.
Dean had said. There it was, the fluorescent green sign, the stick figure running through a door. He beelined for it, the crowd thinning and thinning until Cas was free to run to it, pushing it open and could finally suck in a breath of clean night air.
Dean chewed his lip in thought, his brow furrowed as he thought. In this light his eyes shone a beautiful moss green… Cas shook the thought away.
Dean left the half naked Cas to his shower, exiting the bathroom and closing the door with a solid click. Sam looked up expectantly.
Dean opened his eyes again, gulping.
"Everything go okay?" Sam asked.
"It'll help." He told him.
Good.
Dean’s mouth dropped open and he adjusted himself in his chair. He squeezed his eyes shut for a second. “Shit, Cas, I’m really not used to this.”
2 chapters in a row centred around shopping? I think I'm living vicariously - UK Lockdown is really getting to me.
“The Xenophobic response would be astronomical.” Cas said, and Dean remembered again how much Cas had seen, the length of his existence. He’d seen humanity have to shift again and again, seen their reactions and how they adjusted.
"I can tolerate pain." Cas told him, taking a step forward. "But are you certain this establishment is sterile?"
“I kept digging, and it kept getting worse. And then Dick
Sam awkwardly patted the smaller man on the back. "Yeah, Garth; I'm good." He told him. "How about you?"
"That too. Completely understandable, if I do say so myself." She smirked.
"Uh," Dean stammered, and caught Cas's eye in the mirror, blue shining bright under the fluorescents. "Hi."
“Souls.” Dean told her simply, and she squinted incredulously. “He can’t do that any more. He’s powered down. Completely human. Can get hurt and die like the rest of us.” He gritted his teeth and took a sip of his beer.
“No.” Cas gripped his hair, pulling Dean’s head to look up at him again, and Dean’s teeth bared in the movement. “Too much was asked of you. You don’t have to hold that on your shoulders.”
"Heh." Dean chuckled. "Frank taught me a few tricks." He opened up the computer, and within a few minutes he had every camera within the house on his screen.
"What're you even researching?! We're not on a hunt." Dean asked his brother.
.” She emphasised. “Anyway, it all came to a head a few months back, when someone pretty high up in the government turned out to not human.”
He just needed to figure out his own damn head. Now that he knew what he was feeling, he noticed every time the breath caught in his chest when Cas would walk into a room, the way a smile would come easily. He noticed how much he used to casually touch Cas, because now he was hyperfixated on how much he did - was it more, or less now? Should he hold it back, or would that be even weirder?
“The other bank?”
“Dean?” He heard behind him, and he lost focus on the body instantly. Cas had walked in… no…. this was Castiel. He was
Shaking his head slightly, he reached down, the movement familiar, knowing the precise spot even as he looked away, looked up at the ceiling. The strong, steady pump of Cas's heartbeat was there, strong under his fingertips.
“And we don’t pay rent… that’s usually a big expense.” Sam was ignoring them, which was fair.
“This?”
"I don't think you are." Was the retort. "You're no ordinary human."
“So how’d you decide?” Sam asked.
Cas looked away, looking back to the door, and Dean released a breath that had been stuck inside. “I didn’t want to make you uncomfortable, I wanted…. I thought you maybe wanted this too.”
“No, no, what are you doing with that?” She asked, looking back up at Dean. “I knew this was a bad idea-”
from within. Everything, he needed to feel
He’d asked as she’d made him blink against the mascara wand.
“Yeah, Ash did a good job.”
Dean was still on the phone behind them, though now looked more relaxed as Cas turned to look. He was leant back in his chair, clicking the pen in his hand up and down, writing nothing. Seeing Cas watching, he winked, before quickly turning away, listening to Garth. Turning back to the onions and meat in front of him, he dutifully stirred, watching as Sam chopped the carrots far more efficiently than he had. He frowned, looking away as he began to feel the uncomfortable notion of inadequacy rising, focusing instead on making sure the food didn't burn.
"Fine." Dean snapped. They both placed their right fists in their left palms, ready for battle.
Sam shrugged a little too nonchalantly. "Well, if it were anyone..."
A hand clapped onto his shoulder, and he jerked away from it. He looked up to see his brother crouched over him, and he tried to pull away, tried to stop crying, but instead found himself pulled in as Sam put his arms around him and held him tight.
Cas said nothing, just tightened his jaw. That was enough for Sam.
Dean glanced back to Sam, to Dean, and Sam shrugged. So much for poker faces.
"Castiel? What did he do to deserve this?"
[10:14 AM] Sam: Kill me. They won’t stop.
"So?" Sam asked. "Anything?"
"Fine." Sam finally said, sighing. "Whatever. Where's Cas?"
“I was an angel of the Lord. I used to be able to smite demons with a touch of the hand. I could heal your wounds instantly. Now I have to deal with
"Quite a plan... it really is. Bulletproof." Crowley told him. "I'm sure that'll work marvellously for you... if you think you can get through my staff."
"Am I on research duty?" Dean sighed.
Cas took the distraction gratefully, feeling the arms slacken around him, he shoved the angel blade into the stomach of the Leviathan, and using its distraction and pain to spin out and slice the head straight off. He didn't truly see what happen, but he sensed it, near enough.
As Sam had expected, Cas flinched at the touch, jerking out of the loose grip and bouncing in the bed as he scrambled away, almost falling from the bed in a need to get out. Dean jumped back at the movement, and Sam spared a look at him. He looked like he'd been slapped.
“Mighta figured this out sooner.” Dean admitted, with a shrug. “Mighta made a move years ago.”
, the warm pressure exquisite around himself and his toes curled as he felt himself fill out, get larger in his hand. He watched with fascination as he moved his hand up and down, the sensation of the movement curious against the visual, until his eyes rolled close and his lips parted, a low groan rumbling in his chest. He paused, aware of the thin walls, and pressed his lips back together. This wasn’t an opportunity to explore himself and the sensations, this was to deal with a
Oh. He was asking if he was hungover. He was trying to figure out if Dean had been drunk when he’d visited him last night, right? “Not so many.” He said, pulling his coffee over. It was true, he drank well below what he had been polishing off in the last year, though he came back loose and with lower inhibitions. But he didn’t say anything he regretted.
"Well, that option is not being explored. No exploring is going to happen."
And so they searched the rooms. They went from the kitchen to the dining room, to the study, to the second living room. All of these were free of treasured locks of hair.
“How much time you spent on this?”
“Hmmmm….”
“Yeah.” Sam leaned back against the seat, closing his eyes and resting his head against the window, like Cas. “Did you guys have fun tonight? I mean, before this?”
"You had time to buy every single Star Trek film, but not my pie?"
"Not on purpose!" Sam reminded him. "Sure, at the end he went-"
. He groaned again at the feel of it, and he felt Cas smile against his lips, a chuckle, before Cas ground down against him. Fuck, they both were. This was fucking
"Where're you going with this?"
"Is that what it is?" Sam chuckled. "Dean, we've barely been here four days."
But it wasn't Dean. His elder brother had sat bolt upright the same instant that Sam had, ignoring the ache that he must have been feeling from spending the night on the floor. In the instant that it took them to realise that it wasn't either of their yelling that was ringing through the cold cabin, they were on their feet, clambering for the stairs to Cas.
“Why do we need your help?” Dean asked, looking her up and down. She psyched herself up, wincing before she spoke.
"Dean." Cas interrupted. Dean turned round, and Cas glowered at him. "The job."
.” Cas roared at him, and Dean tried to steady himself. He had, but he wasn’t now. Surely Cas could see he wasn’t now. But Cas was right, he’d said yes before and then snatched it away.
"You haven't offended me. Just, we're not discussing this while we're shopping for clothes."
“Hey, Mom.” Sam spoke into the quiet air, kneeling down to place the gas station mixed spring flowers bouquet down against the headstone. “Been a while.”
"I didn't want to go, Dean; you must know that."
“I wasn’t looking.” He didn’t look up, still leading through the pages. He stopped at a page, offering a low whistle.
out of what he said was okay, it was just as bad as the things we hunted.” He sighed, watching his breath dance in the air in front of him. “I just always tried so hard to be his perfect son, his perfect soldier… Sometimes I just think…”
Dean wandered up a floor checking it out. Furniture filled the space, settees, beds, laz-e-boys, bookshelves… there was a lot up here. It was silly to look, really, the bunker came fully furnished, but it was nice to wander the space, checking it all out. That settee looked comfy, and that blanket on it looked cosy as hell. They didn’t really have a comfortable room, they’d been watching movies on their laptops in the library or the kitchen, or once the four of them piled into Sam’s room and watched Starsky and Hutch on his bed. They needed somewhere they could really chill.
"Don't." The angel told him firmly. "Dean, don't come."
Dean knew gays could look like that, he knew they weren’t all small weedy guys with long eyelashes and plump lips, or skeevy old guys, he knew that. He knew that what he’d known when he was a teenager wasn’t the full picture, but damn… every person here was so different, and so, so similar.
"I was attempting to make a balanced meal." He explained.
"Sleep in the same room." He corrected, yawning.
“You wanna be able to settle down?” Sam says, leaning forward. “I mean, I know you wanted to with Lisa, you did-”
"No." He told them. "I cremated her."
“Five years is a long time.” Sam said. “If it were a hunt that’d be one thing, but this sounds weird.”
"Castiel." She breathed. "You have the choice."
He'd been here once. Back through the woods, a few miles back, his Dad and he had destroyed the ghost that had been haunting the woods. After it was done, John went off, leaving Dean to his own devices for a bit. He'd stumbled across this dock. He'd just sat there for hours, feet dangling off the edge of the pier, just shy of tracing the water. He hadn't been fishing at the time, that was just something his brain added in. Same with the lumpy arm chair he was sitting in.
“I hate texting.”
"I do, Dean." Cas told him solemnly. "Just go. I'm not worth your life."
“Not much here, really. Just people and shops. Farms, if you’re into that. There’s Vista, the cinema, that’s pretty much it. You wanna hit up Philipsburg if you want something to do.”
“The harp.” Cas answered, and Dean’s eyebrows shot up.
“Stow it.” Dean snapped back at him, and Sam put his hands up in lazy defence.
She sat up, slowly, and moved back so she was resting against the headboard. "Of course. You don't recognise me." She said slowly, deliberately. Each word was measured and calculated, weighed up before she said it. It reminded him of someone, and something uneasily stirred in his chest.
"You sure know how to make a girl feel special." She said, rolling her eyes. Pulling her top back on, she raised an eyebrow. "Don't you wanna try again?"
Dean huffed, crossing the room and walking towards the front door. It was dark outside, the light from the cabin filtering through the cold February evening with nothing more to help it than the moonlight and stars above. As an afterthought, Dean grabbed his jacket, shrugged it on, and kicked the door closed behind him. He knew the cabin was going to start getting to him. With a grand total of three rooms, there wasn't many options when he inevitably wanted to get away from everyone.
"Dean!" Sam barked, and Dean flashed back to the present, shifting his legs under the table and turning to him.
“For me!” Crowley pointed out, his voice rising into a shout. “I was the one jilted at the alter! And on the run after you missed your shot at Lucifer!
"True." Sam shrugged.
"Actually, it's not easy to say anything." Cas corrected feebly. Dean looked round at the girl, seeing her pale and forlorn. Something twinged inside of him, and he reached down on the floor for a water bottle that he knew was there.
“Sometimes. Quitting… the office, opening a bar somewhere, settling down. Finding….” Don’t think about it. “Someone, building a life. Sounds nice.”
Cas still had nightmares, some which Dean woke up for, some which he didn’t, but each day the dark circles under his eyes lessened a bit. His sleeping schedule, while still way off Dean’s small hours bedtime, approached something a little bit more reasonable, usually crashing about 11. And the training was going well. Cas was getting up early and going for a run every morning with Sam, which Dean slept through every time. Dean was focusing on hand to hand, how to disarm an opponent, while Sam taught him blocking, how to evade a charge or a punch.
, he’s a problem.”
Sam looked up when he heard the sound of yelling, deep and dark and desperate, instinctively looking for Dean, not unused to his brother's nightmares. The first few times he'd helped, but he quickly learnt that Dean didn't want him at times like that.
He saw a door leading out and shoved it open, finding himself in a small garden designed to cheer up the patients and visitors, but was clearly just used as a smoking area. But the fresh air felt good, and he frantically went through, scrambling as he went, until he dropped to the floor, cramming himself into a corner and put his hands over his head, and his head to his knees.
That wasn’t enough, he knew it. He’d said yes once before, and regretted it.
She turned to the little girl still in the flame circle, noticing her eyes wide with terror. She waved a hand lazily, and the flames went out.
"Right." Sam shook his head. "How do you know that the guy running this one isn't just in it for the money?"
Angels are great at waiting. They can stand to attention for millennia and not think a thing of it. Nephilim, on the other hand... their human impatience intermingled with their angelic grace made tasks such as this far more arduous. However, it wasn't just her human half making this wait so difficult. It was her grace, the butchered, shuffled, shaken and stirred grace.
He tried to distract himself by putting on the TV that was on the wall opposite the bed. It was early afternoon by this point, so all there was on was crappy daytime TV, which Dean, admittedly, had grown a soft spot for.
She didn't have much time for the ritual. It had to be performed at sun-up, which was barely any time at all. But she had the ingredients.
"Naturally. The aforementioned warm fuzzies."
The ring burned a hole in his pocket on the way back home. Not literally, thankfully, he didn’t think it was haunted. But it haunted him. It was private, taboo, and no one would know what it meant.
“Not at keeping it up to date, I can already think of like, twelve different things that could kick this up a notch and I haven’t even broken it down yet.”
So when he came out of the shower and Dean had straight away told him they they were going out tonight, to get dressed, to shave and look nice (not the suit, though)… Cas hadn’t known what to say. He stared for a minute, though Dean still wasn’t meeting his eye, before nodding and heading upstairs. There was no way this wasn’t directly related to last night, that Dean would suggest an outing, just the two of them, directly after Castiel’s proposition.
Sam frowned. They knew Borax did something to them, and Bobby had said just before... he had said that they could kill each other by forcing them to eat themselves. Surely there must be something in that.
Enough. He left the bathroom, glancing down at his outfit once more, feeling secure in knowing this one aspect of himself would be correct. He grabbed the scarf from the back of the chair, knowing in the early February evening he would need it, seeing as goosebumps were something he now had to deal with. The bedroom door remained ajar as he hadn’t yet formed the human habit of the perpetual need for privacy, and there was nothing in that room that needed to be hidden. He walked to the library, and Sam looked up from a desk, giving Cas a soft smile and a nod at the outfit.
"Cas?!" Dean barked out, the words escaping from his lips in shock as he gripped tighter on the wrist, moving up and onto the bed so that he could reach the other, reach for Castiel's arm, fixing him down, fixing him here.
Dean took a deep breath, almost cleanly this time. “You sure you don’t wanna trade me in for someone with less issues? Get a refund? S’not too late.”
"Heaven's not all it's cracked up to be, then?" Livvie sighed.
"Not exactly." Dean winced, remembering his words. "I said what was on my mind."
He shoved him back again, lips clashing back together as he pushed him back, back along the corridor. He grabbed Cas’s wrist, holding it high to keep it away from his dick for just a minute more, and he felt Cas strain against it for a minute, enjoying the struggle. And wasn’t that an idea, someone who could actually take him, could pin him down and not let him go. He knew Cas could do it, had felt it when they sparred, and now he could really admit to himself that he’d
"How long were Dean and Cas together, anyhow?"
This orgasm was gentler than the last but drawn out, heady, dragged from him, weighed down with an anchor. He could have stayed in Dean’s mouth for hours, relished in it, and wasn’t that a thought for another time. His body, intertwined with Dean’s, so human and physical, and all his, all theirs.
Cas shook his head, and Dean could sense it even he couldn’t see it. “We’ve already spoken about this, Dean.”
“Won’t lose any sleep over him, then.” He frowned, thinking, a fingertip tapping on the tablecloth. He looked back up to Cas. “But what I did to get money as a kid
Dean’s eyes flicked back up to meet his, wide, bright, shining. Peridot green. He opened his mouth to speak, but words had trouble coming out. So instead he dropped his gaze and looked at Cas’s hand, before slowly reaching forwards to take hold of it. Dean’s fingers clasped around his own, his thumb hooking over his knuckles, just feeling this tiny bit of warmth and connection from each other. Cas stared at it, stared at where their hands joined in a way they never had before.
Was that an option? He supposed it could have been, at no point did Cas ever ask for a relationship, just that Dean be a willing an eager participant to whatever they do, no regrets. He didn’t specify morning after eggs, or lazy morning hand jobs, or real, honest sleep. He didn’t have to choose this, but he did. “Not with you.” Dean answered simply, and Cas was quiet for a minute. Dean chanced a look up at him, and Cas was smiling softly at him.
He was out of breath, but the room looked immaculate. There was the big conference table, the one he’d been expecting, and stretched across it was a body, bound in straps to keep it still. Time to get to work. He flicked the tie over his shoulder and opened the drawer, grabbing the first thing available to him - perfect. A letter opener.
"Guess I gotta teach you how to use these, huh?" He asked, his voice a little too gruff as he flipped up the collar, fastening the last button and wrapping the material around.
He broke his clasped hands to wipe a palm across his mouth.
“I wasn’t out too late, only had a few.” He said, trying to keep his tone light, free from defensiveness.
It went better than she could have hoped. Well, she didn't get to sleep with the Winchester, which would have been a fun way to pass the time, but she saw it all from afar. She saw Dean calling Cas, she saw the argument. She heard the unkind words that were spat, she felt the hurt feelings.
"Yeah, I can see that!" Dean cried, looking the angel up and down. "Why not? What changed her mind?"
.” He reminded him, and Cas rolled his eyes, looking to the younger Winchester.
"Come on, Cas; that was funny." He grinned, but sobered up slightly, looking down and shaking his head. He began to self-consciously run his hand up and down his left arm, fingers catching on material of his t-shirt with each stroke, and his fingers began to play with it, plucking at the fabric. After half a minute, he noticed what he was doing and looked at it, pulling the material up further, peering at the shoulder, remembering what used to be there.
"We thought you were dead. Dean took it hard, though he wouldn't let on." Sam shrugged. "And now you're back; I thought it would've been good for him, but he's just gotten worse."
He placed a paperweight right on the belly button and watched it sink into the flesh.
” Cas groaned out, and Dean sat up, pulling Cas back and experimenting with latching a mouth around Cas’s nipple, licking and sucking as Cas rolled in his lap.
Dean grasped hold of Sam's sleeve, eyes ferociously determined through the pain.
“So what’s gonna work?” Dean pinched the bridge of his nose in exasperation.
He frowned, searching her with his eyes before his dwindling grace kicked into action, recognising a fellow angelic grace. "You managed to restore your grace without your father's assistance?"
"No, I mean," She sat back down, sighing. "You're my Dad's best friend. You're practically my uncle." She looked up at him. "I was meant to go to you for help if I needed it. You were the one I could trust."
Dean fought the urge to open them himself. He knew what lay beyond there wouldn't help.
Content warning: In the first few paragraphs of this chapter Dean has a flashback to John Winchester attacking him and calling him the F slur. This will be explored more in later chapters.
“Should we play that next?” Cas asked, pulling the paper towards him and placing them in orderly piles.
"Come on, let's swap." He told him, slapping him on the arm. "What we researching? Leviathans? I can do that."
were taking up too much of the road.” Cas told him.
There was a minute of silence, and Dean was beginning to suspect Cas had fallen asleep until he spoke once more. "Thank you."
"We'll help you find him." Sam offered, unsure what to say.
A thought struck Sam, and he chewed his pen in thought. "Who would win in a fight: A Nephilim or a Leviathan?"
"Like Cas, that's what." Dean told him. "What do you know?"
"Me hiding?" She laughed. "You're the one who moved towns."
“Fuck.”
“Are you talking about sex, or sex with men?” Cas asked. “Or sex with you? Because you didn’t seem to have these reservations when you
“Sangue?” Dean finished. There was a little more, but that was well worn.
"Just... great, Garth." Dean replied, patting the man thrice on the back until he let go. "What about you?"
It was irrational, he knew that. Cas was alive, Cas was here. He wasn't half way through the veil anymore, it wasn't touch and go whether he'd wake up. He'd spent the evening watching Star Trek with them, for crying out loud.
But, despite Sam's past, despite their fallings out and his flaws in judgement, Cas trusted the younger Winchester. Sam knew his brother, and if Sam said it was good for Cas to be around, Cas was going to stay around.
"I'll get the mirror so you can see it, Cas." She suggested, but he shook his head.
"You sure this is the place?" The second tallest asked, and the taller shrugged.
“Cas?” Dean called, kicking him slightly under the table.
"T-shirt, sweatpants." He smiled at the grey shirt that Cas had just pulled out, noticing the embroidery. He stood up and walked over, beginning to sift through, curious as to what they'd bought. "Same as you wore last night."
He laughed at the idea of Cas in a toe ring.
And for a while she started talking about her Dad again, about the appointment they’d gone to today, and all Dean could think was
Yes. “The furniture. It’s time we make the place ours. I know you moved that armchair to your greenhouse, but there anything else you want?”
. He wondered what that felt like.
He sat on one of the rocks at the water line, looking out at the water so the others couldn't see his face. He didn't want them to see him like this.
Sam looked to the bathroom, hearing the shower still going. "I ain't questioning it." Dean said stubbornly.
"I'm too busy trying to work out if we'll get there alive or not!"
"You're lovely colleague here-"
Somehow the room already looked like Dean, smelt like him even. Dean had laid out his guns on top of the dresser, had put his shoes by the door, had switched on a lamp. There was the old photograph of Dean and Mary on his bedside locker, placed carefully. It was beautiful.
"I don't understand." He replied.
He turned down someone, a beautiful woman, a night of what he was certain would be a fucking fantastic ride… for Cas. Even though he’d said no to Cas before. Even though Cas had said
“You’ve got some pretty striking pieces there.” Dean nodded at a Hawaiian shirt laid across the bed.
“I don’t know if you want that, but it’s something I think that’s needed. You don’t gotta give me an answer yet, it’s still early days, but I’d appreciate you thinking about it.”
"It's just..." He sighed, not knowing what to say. How on earth could he put what he felt into words. How could he be capable of that. He opened his eyes, looking to Cas. He knew what Cas would say. Whoever was listening would get it. They'd get what he was trying to say, what he couldn't. They'd get what words wouldn't put together.
“Take a shower, Man, warm up.” He’d told Cas as he fished through the fridge. Burgers, definitely. Sam had even got potatoes, he could make real fries with this, if the stove held out. Cas had nodded, and Dean watched as he went to the bathroom, movements stilted by the damp denim clinging to his legs.
"It's not a problem." Cas replied, stirring the food a little harder than he had before.
Almost as if on cue, Sam saw Dean scramble onto the deck outside of the window. He tried not to look, keep his eyes steady on Olivia. He swallowed.
“If she’s arresting us, we have stuff on her too.” Sam reminded Dean. “She shot her partner for us.”
Sam saw, from the corner of his eye, Olivia move. He looked round, seeing her hand grasped tight around the angel blade, lifting it up.
But somehow, not yet. Let alone what? Dean still doesn’t have the words, and Cas knows it.
“We need to pick you up, can we meet you on the track? Get your GPS on?”
Sam looked up, reaching out for the phone when Cas offered it. “Everything okay?”
"Yeah..." Dean stepped away, moving towards the fridge for another beer. "About that. Sam did mention-"
Cas picked out a low coffee table, iron cast but the top made of stain glass. It looked a little delicate, but it was artsy, and he could see Cas staring at it for a long time. He sent Cas to look at the CD’s while he went downstairs to pay for everything, knowing it would add up to no small amount. He traipsed down the stairs, all the way back to the ground floor, trying not to drop any of the clothes or trip on the blanket.
"There's nothing I can do." She sighed, leaning back and taking a sip of tea.
Finally, excruciatingly, it began to fade, until only one thing could be heard.
“Fuck yes.” Dean muttered, gripping hold of Cas’s shirt and pulling him closer somehow, the feeling of Cas right there, between his legs, absolutely intoxicating. When Cas stroked his thumb higher Dean sucked in a sharp breath and Cas dragged him forwards, suddenly flush against him, and Dean hooked a foot around Cas’s thigh, anchoring them both together. “Can’t believe you’re putting out on the first date.” He muttered, and he felt Cas laugh against him, lips pulling away to mouth along his neck.
"You weren't kidding when you said you had an angel, were you? You sure got someone special here."
It was a few hours later that Cas was disturbed. He’d taken to the conservatory, cool sunlight streaming through the now cleaned windows. Out of the window he could see the hill side fall below, the rocky outlook, and farmland as far as the eye can see. It was peaceful, and for a while he’d stood and watched the cattle grazing a mile away.
“Alright, alright.” Sam was laughing now, and they headed to the door together. Sam put a hand on Dean’s elbow, holding him back for a second, just before they leave. “You think he’s gonna be okay now though? With his nightmares?”
He could feel the alcohol still warm in his chest, lingering, in his ribs with each breath… his breath stuttered like his words.
He kicked open the bathroom door and went back into the restaurant, resolve sealed. They would get the damned angel his vessel back, they would put him in their rear-view mirror, and get back to cleaning up his mess.
"One of my sisters, known for her forgiveness. I expect she was chosen for the job as a sign of loyalty to whichever new leader heaven has."
Dean’s stomach dropped at Cas’s words, clinical and clear but… fuck if that wasn’t hot. He felt his chest tighten along with his jeans and he swallowed again. “Cas…”
"I did." Cas said softly, hints of confusion, and just a bit of pride in his voice. "Though I do not understand the humour."
"Sammy!" Livvie cried. "So nice of you to join us." She moved her gaze to the gun as she languidly stood up. "Is that really necessary?"
His breath was coming harsher now, through gritted teeth, fast and hard and a choked sound left his throat, and another, and another.
They paused at various points along the way. The first was directly outside of the bar, Livvie pressed up against the brick wall, Dean kissing her hard, hands all exploratory and unapologetic.
“I rang the dinner bell,” Dean pointed up at it. “Tells everyone dinner’s ready, they have them in places this old, and big. They couldn’t text.” He chanced a grin, trying to calm the butterflies in his chest. Since when did Dean Winchester get butterflies?
Cas was getting more well versed in subtext. He knew that while Sam didn't say it, the words this time hung on the end of the sentence.
He wanted to see what those eyes looked like in ecstasy.
Dean's driving was worse than usual. He turned corners far too quickly, ran red lights, barely escaped running over some unsuspecting pedestrians. It really was a miracle there were no cops around.
"Sorry." He repeated, laughter in his voice gone. He soothed his fingertips over the mark, looking it over. "Being human isn't that great." He admitted. "You know that. I get that it's a major demotion. Give yourself another fifty years, if you're lucky, and you're gone. Why bother?" Dean looked back at the sleeping face, seeing that the light had clawed further over, his nose casting a long shadow across his right cheek. "But there's so much..." He trailed off.
Cas charged, ready to slice for the neck, decapitation. He reached for the bottle of cleaning fluid in his pocket, going for the splash'n'slash, as Dean had once named it, but once again found his journey obstructed. Within a second he was pulled back, held tight by a second Leviathan that he cursed himself for not being able to notice.
He’d promised that he would help Cas, that he would make being human
All too aware that the next wave of demons would be rapidly approaching, they made their plans quickly.
Dean looked at his brother. "You seriously think that?"
Cas squinted at the phone with suspicion, folding his arms and leaning against the doorframe, his posture diagonal. He didn’t used to do that, never needed to… another quirk of humanity. His arms were thick, flexed as the crossed, and Dean forced his eyes away. Not the time.
Dean blinked. "Weren't you watching him?"
"You should've called. I wanted to pay my respects." Crowley looked back down to the angel. "I'll take him off your hands, gladly."
"Uh, was Rufus's," Sam explained, letting the nickname slide as he picked up his bag, checking around to make sure he had the necessities. "We moved all of Bobby's stuff here after the house burnt."
"You're Nephilim." Zedkiel said. "Though, without your grace."
food." Dean clarified, and Sam felt the smile creep back on to his face. He shoved the bananas in the fridge, hiding the beer behind them. Turning back to the bags on the table, he rummaged through until he found what he was looking for. When he'd spotted the movies, he'd doubled back specifically to get snacks. And while he himself couldn't stand what was inside the bag he picked up, he knew Dean loved it.
He sat down on one of the stools, placed his elbows on the counter and got settled. The bartender turned to him, not saying anything, just raised an eyebrow expectantly.
"Beats me." Dean replied. "First his pulse started up again, then he just sat up." He looked at his brother. "That's it. All that happened."
Dean exhaled, leaning back. "That's a good idea."
Sam could probably hear all they were discussing, the halls in this cabin were so damn thin. He shouldn't feel self conscious at the thought of Sam being able to hear a perfectly innocent conversation, but just the idea of Sam listening in... the sooner he got out of here, the better.
“Dean…” Cas breathed out, and Dean spread his legs a little, feeling the heavy heat of Cas slot between his thighs. Cas groaned against his skin, experimentally shifting, stilted, like he was still waiting for Dean’s okay. Dean took the hand that was curled around his middle, and he couldn’t resist pressing a kiss to the palm before moving it down to his own morning wood. His body sung in response, ecstatic for the attention of someone other than himself, and they rocked like that, lazy gasping and muffled words, praises, directions and swearing until they both came against each other, bodies humming the same frequency, breathing the same hot air.
It had been roughly half an hour since the film had finished. Dean was currently on the phone to Garth, Cas was standing at the window, DVD case in hand as he read the back, fidgeting slightly. Sam looked over as he pulled old equipment from the drawers and cupboards, rinsing them thoroughly.
"Thank you." The man said. "It happened last year... still doesn't feel like she's quite gone."
To Cas's mild surprise, Sam cracked a smile. "You got a paper cut?"
Sam sighed, looking towards his brother. Of course there'd been jokes on the topic before, there'd been pointed remarks by people as to their feelings for each other, not to mention the fact that they seemed to be in a perpetual staring contest with one another.
"Up to you, love." She sighed as she waved to the bartender. "Vodka, please." She smiled.
Dean's gaze went straight to Cas, looking at the man strewn on the floor, and most disturbingly of all, the burnt wing prints on the floor.
“Right…” She frowned, trying to process his words. “You wanna try to explain why without being a dick?”
"Crap." Dean said, picking up a bag and scrawling a note to the angel, telling him to call if he returned.
“Come on Cas, you gotta stretch it out.” Sam had called over, bending over to touch his own toes without bending his knees. He made it look easy, master and commander over his own form.
“Dean, that’s fucked up.”
"So what else is new?" Dean muttered.
Cas didn't say anything for a minute, just staring at the hunter. He could see the anger in his face, the hurt. The angel didn't want to fight – he had given everything for this man, and if he needed to give a little bit more, so be it.
Garth was good. But Dean was stuck.
It didn't hurt that Dean was fast asleep and snoring.
“Why?” He choked out, because right now he couldn’t see any reason why not.
From this vantage, he realised he could see out of the window, could see the blue sky, the trees. There was a branch right outside the window, not thick, not strong; it couldn't carry a man's weight, but it had something Dean hadn't seen in a while. A small, white flower was blooming from the brown, barely more than a bud, but still, definitely there.
Castiel feels the ground slip beneath his feet, a wet slide, the damp of the fog giving way underneath him and his stomach feels like he's been punched, a deep tug in his gut and he's falling,
Cas contemplated. "In my experience, the consumption of alcohol did not improve the situation."
“Good.” Cas said seriously, looking at her.
They took their meagre things to the room and set themselves down. Dean checked the clock, wondering if it was time to go to the bar yet, caring little either way.
"Well, fantastic." Dean grumbled, swinging his legs from the bed. "Have we got anything?"
"Yeah, that's not gonna work this time." He sighed.
Dean took another sip. "Yeah, I do, and it's dumb." He shrugged, looking back out the window and seeing Garth sitting in the car, tapping out some form of rhythm on the steering wheel. "Don't worry about me. Go kill some vampires, and come back alive. That's all I need."
“And then yesterday you kissed me, but later said you would have regretted going further.”
He sat back on his heels, breathing heavily and frowning. "How am I meant to even get started if you keep talking about him?"
Dean sighed. "Sam should be here." Grumbling, he nodded at the shirt for Cas's reaction, who took it in his own hands, placing it carefully over his arm. Dean guessed that one was sticking.
Cas turned out to be pleasantly surprised by how simple the meal actually was, and allowed himself a small ounce of pride at the look of pleasure on Dean's face when he first bit into it. He was under no illusions that Sam had done the lion's share of the work, but somehow that didn't matter. He had partially contributed to that smile.
He hoped, when he saw Dean had made them breakfast, that it was a blip, that Dean had forgotten and so could he, but Dean still didn’t look him in the eye. When prompted for requests he’d asked for candyfloss of all things, but Dean had smiled, had found it funny, and he thought it might have been okay. But when Cas offered to go with him Dean had turned him down so fast even Sam had noticed.
The man remained lifelessly unmoving underneath him.
Hours later, Dean Winchester finally left the bar, and Livvie was free to leave the back room. Honestly, there was only so much a girl could do to keep herself occupied. She had bored quickly of the man's advances and left as soon as she knew the route was secure. Perhaps Tommy would have kept her safe without the promise of sex, but she wasn't going to risk it. Outside the Winchester's car was still parked, and she considered taking it, but the risk of it being a trap was too great. Plus, she'd looted it of anything useful, and it was a damn ugly ride. She walked fast, bag slung over shoulder, pondering what to do next.
to get myself ready to fight, to not be a liability to you both in battle, on a hunt. I was once an angel, but even without my grace I am perfectly capable.”
“No, he did fine.”
When Castiel had jumped into her, she had sifted through his memories. She thought she had seen enough, all she had needed to. She hadn't been thorough enough; thankfully, the information she had needed stuck.
Dean woke, neck slightly sore from the awkward angle he had eventually found rest in, and sat up, groaning. He opened his eyes, shielding them slightly from the light, and looked around the room. He was alone. Frowning in confusion, he blinked, and then groaned as last night began to filter through the sleepy haze; Cas's nightmare, Cas half naked in bed, his hand on Cas's warm leg...
Suddenly, there's no ground beneath his feet, none at all. He's falling, feet first, scrambling for anything to cling on to, hands flailing, mouth open in a yell that gets lost up above, up in the clean white fog that was once comforting but now as terrifying as the fall, unable to see where he's going, what he's doing, and he's twisted, body contorted as he tries to hide, to climb back up and finding nothing and suddenly he can see the ground, just a few meters below and he can see his shadow getting closer and closer and closer and he's falling and it's going to hurt-
He tried to remember what happened last night. He remembered a park, dimly; he remembered a car... he remembered a pretty barmaid in a bar called...
"I thought God was his Father?"
She was teasing him.
Sam chuckled; Charlie had recommended censoring their texts in case Leviathan’s were using tech to search for key-words.
They both looked at her again. She hadn't moved, but at least the slight movement of her chest moving up and down told them she was still breathing. Dean grimaced and moved towards her, while Sam grabbed the shot gun, aiming it at the girl.
Dean smirked, replaying the film in his head, wondering if Cas was aware that he had just quoted Spock.
"And that makes..." Sam frowned, shaking his head. "So
“You fancy a sous chef on this?” Dean suggested, shooting him his old faithful smile, confident he could flirt him into accepting help in the kitchen without getting his back up.
Oh, god.
"We kill her." Dean said. "I'm not about to let her kill anyone so she can get her rocks off."
"Oh, just thinking out loud." Dean laughed. "Where is it?"
Cas wondered at his words, playing the weight of them in his mind. Sam had said that just by being here he was making Dean worse, but somehow this was good? He considered that, perhaps, it would be best to leave, to stop imposing himself on the boys, on Dean; that perhaps the healing process for them would be far easier without him around. They were not the friends that they once had been for a very long time, and though the hunter meant more than heaven to him, he recognised that this feeling may not be returned.
Silence. No one talked. Sam slumped back glaring at his arm again, grabbing the flask from the divot between the seats and wincing before splashing it on the wound. “Can I help you, Sam?” Cas asked, voice low and with all the effort of calm he could muster.
“I would like to.” He announced, holding the duffel against his chest. “Thank you for the coffee, Charlie.” He said as he left the room.
Cas nodded. “Okay.”
The car park was placed at the front of the bar, and as he walked through he melancholically thought of his baby, the beautiful Impala. It had been a while since he had last seen her, and these garish, boring, ill-conceived vehicles they drove now were nothing in comparison, the same as the cars parked here. That blue car in the corner was too boxy, that red car to the left was too flashy, and way too small, and that rusty car right next to the entrance clearly wouldn't have room in the trunk to hide a body.
Hitting the store didn’t take a few hours, by any stretch. And sure, he needed to get out of the cabin, but this wasn’t just a milk run. He was on the hunt for something specific. He was pretty sure the nearest town didn’t have what he was looking for, but he checked the high street again, checking out the windows of the bars around - not what he was looking for. He moved onto the next town, again coming up empty.
"They're Dean's." He pointed out. "And dirty."
Livvie's eyes snapped wide, instantly realising she'd said too much. A second later her poker face was back, but Cas noticed.
"Okay..." Sam replied, easily keeping up with his brothers fast, hurried strides. "Why?"
“Hello, Dean.” Cas responded, voice cool and gruff. He wasn’t looking at him, and Dean realised
, his body so acutely aware of every sensation, how could humans go around like this without simply going insane?
Cas smiled. “Okay.”
He went over to the bed, and gently shook his shoulder. Within seconds the angel blearily opened his eyes, blinked hard, and opened them wide. He was wide awake again.
“I should say though,” Sam carried on, snapping Dean out of his thoughts. “If you hurt Cas… you’re dead.”
Cas glanced over at Dean, who had taken a step back, but who carefully grabbed the drink out of Cas’s hand and not so gently gave him a push towards the man, and Cas stumbled towards him. And then he was being led forward, the throng coming closer, and they were weaving in. The man’s hand was in Castiel’s, warm and clammy but easy and freely given, and at some arbitrary point the man stopped pulling him forward and turned back to face him, slinging his arms around Cas’s neck and pulling him close. He was shorter than Cas, and his brown eyes shone in his face, highlighted by what Cas realised was eyeliner smudged around them. It suited him.
Sam scoffed. "Yeah, well. It can be fun, it's great to go out for a drink but... When you do it every night... you've got a problem."
Once he left the bathroom and was dry, he’d ask one of the brothers to put cream on the tattoo, it was a difficult place to reach. But, for right now, he’ll stay under the water for just another minute.
Dean wearing make-up?
"Yeah, yeah." He taunted. "That's right, focus on me."
These didn't seem too bad. He was twitching, he was muttering, he was saying Cas's name. It wasn't unlike the dreams he had when Cas first left, when he had first let loose the Leviathan's and vanished under the water. They weren't as bad as the nightmares that Dean had when had first returned from hell, the ones that he'd wake up from screaming, but Sam had an inkling that Cas had helped to soothe those.
"Seriously?" He uttered in disbelief. "Of all the times to call, Chuck... we have been through a boatload of crap in the last two years, and now you decide to call?"
Sam slumped back in his seat, contemplating just jumping out and walking into town. This was getting ridiculous. Sure, after what Cas had said he had a better idea now of what was going on, but this was not cool. To be stuck in the middle of his brother and his best friends will-they-won’t-they was getting old fast.
Cas wasn't coming.
Cas got the bedroom, of course. Sam and Dean were so used to sleeping on couches or floors or cars that beds were generally a luxury. Far better to leave it to the guy who actually needed it right now. While Sam checked on the demon proofing, Dean climbed the stairs and put Cas into the bed, placing him down carefully, and throwing the covers back over him.
Dean shifted in his seat, the words striking home as true as if she’d slapped him across the face with an itemised list of everyone he couldn’t save.
Sorry for slowing down a little - I hit a little block there but I think I'm back on track. Thanks for everyone commenting and leaving kudos, you're honestly giving me so much serotonin.
He peered in through the windows and could just about see a black bag shoved under the driver's seat. Going back to the trunk he checked it out, and reached into the pocket of his jeans, finding the car key still in there. He pushed it into the lock on the lid, and it opened easily, revealing an impressive stash of weaponry, guns, salt, bottles of water, and cleaning solution. It was their car.
"Next!" Balthazar called.
He felt something sharp press across his stomach and jolted back. She was grinning, holding the blade in her hand, pointing it at him. "Careful, sweetheart; I might change my mind yet." She laughed, and lowered it. "Why don't you run back to your little hunter before he starts to wonder where you are?"
Dean ached to reach out and touch him right now, to stroke Cas’s jaw, his cheekbone, to grab him tight. Before he would have grabbed his shoulder or something, but now that didn’t feel right. Not enough, but also way too much. Right now… Dean wanted to give him anything. He would give Cas anything to make him smile, to make him happy. He felt the air catch in his throat at that realisation. No matter how much they argued, how much they’d hurt each other, how much he wanted to protect Cas from all the dangers in the world… he just wanted Cas to be happy. And he’d do anything in his power to make that happen. “S’your place too, Cas.”
"Makes sense, doesn't it?" The smaller hunter smiled, sending Sam a wink. "Easy pickings on hikers, plus they totally rig the parking meter over here."
"Why?" Dean asked, shrugging. "Why'd you do it?"
He shook his head, taking a step towards it, looking back to Cas who was hesitantly getting out of the car, similarly staring up at the shop-front with trepidation.
It sunk into his chest to the hilt, and his knees gave way beneath him.
He told her that he took a shot today and got turned down, and she gave a sympathetic sigh, talked to him about something that he didn’t really listen to.
"I-" Sam hung his head. "Just sit down and tell me what you know."
Okay, so she knew them by name.
Cas jolted as pins and needles flooded his hand, and he gasped at the sensation. For a second, he could feel it. He could feel him, Dean, could feel his soul under his very fingertips. And he could feel his sadness.
“Have you been here before?” Cas asked, measuring his voice above the volume of the music pummeling through the hallway.
And in drunken curiosity he’d let her. They got back to the bunker, she got her, what was it, her LARPing bag out, fished out her make-up. She didn’t bother with foundation, they weren’t the same shade, but from the looks of it she’d gone to
The possibility that Sam would open the door to dinnertime never crossed his mind.
"Fuck off!" Dean yelled, storming towards him, startling the angel with a solid shove to the shoulder, followed by another to his chest. "Leave me alone!"
"What happened?"
He felt the knee-jerk defensive reaction rise. Those words would be so easy to read as mocking, making a joke about it. But it wasn’t a joke, this wasn’t. And Sam somehow knew it. “Would that be okay?”
"$16.50." The man told him, and Dean sighed, reaching into his pocket for a twenty.
“You could probably pick up some tips for what you’re growing.” Dean pointed out.
. Cas sighed as Sam raised his eyebrows at the blackened, smoking mess in the pan.
Time passed. They finished their food, Sam griping at the lack of salad in the house, claiming that they needed to go out and get some better food if they were going to stay here.
Okay, Dean looked up. Cas looked deep in thought, frowning slightly. Dean could
"And did you bury her?" Dean asked, perhaps a little too abruptly, and the old man looked a little surprised.
Charlie asked.
There was no rush to find it. They were in no immediate danger. He would not use it.
"What do you mean?" Sam queried.
"Something like that." Dean swung it round and took aim at a small figurine at the top of a shelving unit. He pulled and released the trigger and, amazingly, it hit precisely where Dean had been aiming. The old angel statuette that had been placed above his crib as a baby was now reduced to shards of china, and Dean smiled at the success.
"What makes you say that?"
“You were
“I tried a couple of times, but he shut me down. And I talked to Cas, but he said nothing was ever gonna happen… which now that I’m saying it doesn’t exactly-” He stopped himself. “Sorry, you said no.”
"Good to know." Sam closed his laptop. "And Dean?"
"Can you drop the attitude, Dean?" Sam sighed.
“I’m starting something new.” She said simply, interlacing her fingers and looking at them. “And I want you both on the ground level.”
They finally arrived at the lake, an hour and a half after Sam had asked how long it would take. Sam helped Cas out of the car, now requiring to put an arm around the angels back to prop her up as they all walked to the edge of the lake, kicking open the metal gate that discouraged intruders. Dean grimly looked at the sign that warned 'No swimming', the irony not lost on him.
“Spunk?” The word sounded so crude out of his mouth. Wrong. This is what Dean had done to him.
This wasn’t what he wanted, what he needed, he suddenly knew. This stranger in front of him, so kind and pleasing, was a stranger. The thought of leaving with him, exploring his body and finding release together was repulsive, despite the still simmering arousal in his body.
Dean groaned.
"Gotta be the bedrooms, then." Dean said. "Don't get any weird ideas."
After Sam and Garth left, Dean didn't really know what to do with himself. He drank another two bottles of beer, and mused on the fact that he hadn't requested more than one scant six pack from Garth's kind offer of groceries. He wandered the house, his feet taking him round, scuffing the carpets, meeting with furniture. Dean himself didn't take much notice, just sipping his beer as he went around, uncaring. But eventually his feet took him back upstairs, back into the doorway of the room that his friend's shell inhabited.
.” She said. Both boys looked up as Cas walked in the room, curious, and they both shushed him, holding a hand up to indicate him to be still. “
… he couldn’t tell. All he knew was he liked what he saw, and what Cas was doing. A lot.
” The bouncer called.
"Not that. He should've come to us." Dean said stubbornly. "It's too late."
Dean cracked a smile as he pictured it.
"What do you think?" Livvie asked. "Should we blow this place?" Her eyes glittered wickedly, and Dean didn't hesitate. He was now pretty much exclusively thinking with his downstairs brain. Turning to the bartender, he threw down enough money to cover both his and Livvie's drinks, before standing up, and followed her out of the door, arm around her waist, and her hands clutching tight to his shirt, dragging him out.
"What are we looking for?" Sam asked.
"It's a little rough, but I can figure it out." She mused, and Dean frowned, insulted.
"Did I?" Dean asked, smiling. "Sounds like me. Blonde?"
He sighed, popping the hood of the car and digging around. He picked up a few books, including John's old journal for good measure, and grabbed his laptop, throwing it all into a bag. He shut the trunk with a slam, hoisting the bag over his shoulder, and looked down in slight confusion as his stomach growled. He'd forgotten to eat, what with everything that had happened that day. He noted that it had been even longer since Dean had eaten. Glancing briefly at his watch, he could tell he hadn't been gone that long, so he headed for the hospital cafeteria, charming a member of staff to sell him some food with his lovely smile and probably far too large a bribe.
Sure, this wasn’t Dean’s usual type of place, but what’s one club to the next? He feigned comfort and ease that he didn’t quite feel, trying to make it look as easy and natural for Cas as possible - one of them had to be the expert here. And it wasn’t so bad, sure his ass got groped more than once, but everyone had been plenty respectful of his no, of him saying he was here with a friend. The guy at the bar who’d tried to buy them a drink was nice too, beefy, large, with a twinkle in his eye, and he reminded Dean of a hundred hunters he’d met before. Hell, the guy might even have been a hunter, he sure looked the part.
Cas weighed it up for a second, looking Dean up and down, eyes lingering for a second at the crotch, still shielded from view. “Well, despite all historical evidence to the contrary…” He mused, eyes slowly moving back up to Dean’s own. “I’m beginning to suspect you might actually enjoy following orders.”
She was pulled back by a force stronger than a Leviathan, yanked from Dean and sent hurtling across the floor with little more grace than a goldfish that had jumped from its bowl. Something else was on her in an instant. Someone.
"I believe it's customary to say good night?" He asked half heartedly, already looking forward to the bed.
"Yes, I hadn't forgotten." Balthazar agreed distractedly, clearly listening.
It's not just the fact that you're no longer in control of your body. That is annoying as hell – watching as someone else controls you, moves you, speaks with your voice out of your lips, kills people in front of your very eyes... that's horrific. But it's more than that... being pressed again, squashed infinitesimally small in your body against a being so huge, so magnificently massive is pure torture; the burning, blistering pain of it all as you're clung to both a black hole and a burning star... it's more than any human can deal with, but they just can't stop. It's no wonder the empty vessels are found, near dead, brain dead, discarded. They're not human anymore; they're a drooling shell.
She had raised an eyebrow when Cas had first removed his top, slight surprise showing at the risen scar across his chest, the old angel sigil that looked more than a little confusing and sinister to her. She shook her head, trying not to entertain the idea that these two men were involved in some form of cult, with matching pentagram tattoos on every member.
"In the bible they are described as giants: 'We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them'."
“Shut it.” Dean snapped, irrationally defensive despite the surge of pride rising underneath. Cute, huh? How did he feel about cute? He focused on picking a table, close to the exit if they need it. They’d got there first, of course; it wasn’t full, being outside of meal rush house, but it wasn’t empty. Dean looked around warily, eyeing everyone up, the happy family three tables over, the old truckers nursing coffees, the early bird specials. They could all be normies, or they could be plain clothes officers waiting to strike.
fashion
Dean didn't reply, and Sam watched him for a minute as his elder brother gave in. "He died."
"Dean," He replied, tilting his head slightly to the side and into Dean's wrist.
Sam and Dean paused for a second, processing. “Sorry, did someone leave a note for us?” Dean asked.
“I killed thousands, angels and humans-”
"Where is he?"
"Close the door." She told him bossily. "You're letting outside into my pretty car."
“Where’s Cas?” Sam asked, glancing back out in the hallway. “He not up yet?”
“Breathe with me, Dean.” Cas said, holding eye contact with him, and Dean watched as he took a deep, slow breath in. Cas raised an eyebrow at Dean, and, oh right, he was meant to be joining him. He tried but the air snagged on the way in, short sharp, and he had to exhale a little bit to breathe in more. God, he couldn’t even do this right. And Cas breathed out, and Dean tried to match him, but it came out shaky, his chest emptying before long before Cas was done. “Again.” Cas said, his voice low and calm, and Dean followed his movements. He couldn’t match him, not straight away, but minutes passed and his breathing slowed, his heart calmed.
"Yeah, I guess." Chuck chuckled nervously, and Dean frowned again, looking over at Cas in the bed. He stood up and vacated the room.
applies to your organs, Dean.” Sam shifted the logs with a poker, trying to get the new one to catch instead of smothering the whole thing. “Just, like,
None of them saw, but Livvie did the same, leaning forward to watch, but her reasoning was different. Her plan was back on track.
Grabbing a handful of leaves he hoisted himself up, hooking his foot into the trellis below. It held. He lifted his other hand a little higher, pulling himself up, and began to climb.
The boys waited for him to appear. And they kept waiting.
?" Dean repeated. "You've been gone for months and now you want to chat? Well, it's too late."
Looking closer at the board, Cas didn't turn round this time. "How did you and Sam choose where to put yours?"
“Oh.” Dean mumbled.
"Dean?" Sam prompted, presumably having asked a question and received no response.
A beat. A pause.
"What?"
Dean laughed, and just about saw Cas look over. "Top drawer, there's tissue in there." He told him, uselessly gesturing over to the cabinet beside the bed. He listened as Cas fumbled, wiped his face, and blew his nose for the first time.
“Basically, being gay, or bi, queer, whatever is all well and good until it might be you? And then it’s not cool, then it’s uncomfortable. Because it’s not what you’re allowed to be, you gotta be normal, gotta be a
It’s tempting.” Cas looked at Dean, weighing up the concept. “It offers a stability to the future.”
"She threatened me, but did not harm me." Cas explained, and Sam motioned for him to continue. "She says she will kill me later."
“When we’re done here do you wanna head back to the motel, or go straight back to the bunker?” Sam glanced at his phone, it was gone 11, they’d already be charged for the night, and right now he could go for a bed rather than driving for hours. “I think the bunkers making me soft, I kinda wanna rest before getting back in the car.”
The floor was cold, but he couldn't feel it. The high sheen should have sent chills through his clothes, but all he could feel was the bright scorch his body was bathed in. It was bright, too bright, blindingly bright, searing the cold room white hot while it burnt.
No one was around when he entered, Sam was probably asleep, or in the gym, maybe, it wasn’t too late. Dean went straight to Cas’s room, but it was empty, and so he went to the only other place Cas would be. He walked the long hallways, still chewing over in his mind what he wanted to say, the script he was building, snippets of sentences he could use.
“You did good at there, Sam says.” Dean watched as Cas digested the words, still, but saw his shoulders relax a fragment. “I know you’re pissed at me for being worried, but you proved me wrong.”
"You aren't going to help?" He asked, and Dean shook his head.
” he’d said, looking straight at Dean, talking to Dean, incredibly specifically meaning Dean. Cas, Castiel, talking about Dean.
This really wasn’t what he knew to be him.
Cas considered his options. He considered lying again, claiming ignorance, claiming that he did not know the girl's father. Or he could say it was indeed one of the angels fighting him in the civil war.
That Dean Winchester would do this for him, would help him in such a way…
A body with human botherings. The damp had seeped into his clothes and pressed against him, he could feel it in his bones. He needed to be warm, dry, and to stop shivering.
“He fell, recently, now he’s just human, but he’s getting the hang of it.”
"So the guy, after everything, after being a backstabbing son of a bitch, opens this big door and lets out these huge, flesh eating monsters!"
"Yes, but that would've been a bit obvious. We prefer the subtle approach, generally." Balthazar smiled. "You're in my way."
"Did you get pyjamas?" Sam asked, smirking as he saw the familiar patterns emerge.
"That was touching, Cassie." Livvie smirked as she whipped the phone from Castiel's hand with her regained angelic powers. "Really. Looks like the tin-man finally found his heart."
"This one is sawn off?" Cas tilted it for inspection, carefully.
“So, you’ll give me a pass if I’m not jumping for joy at this new place, this bunker. If it’s still standing, I’m sure it won’t be for long.”
After everything he had done, he came back to them asking for their help? They stopped being friends the minute Cas went behind their backs to Crowley. Dean wanted nothing more than to punch the asshole in the face, but he recognised that with the angel in his current state, it probably wasn't the best idea.
Cas heard Sam's tinny voice on the other end of the line.
They were both flicking through the items as fast as they could, but not fast enough. As Cas had in his hand an old perfume bottle, the hairs on the back of his neck stood up, and he felt goosepimples spread across his shoulders. He shivered, looking up, checking the air in front of him.
Cas quirked a smile, the first since yesterday. “As him being happy has brought our safety, I can’t agree. I’m sure he’ll be creative.” He pulled forwards another few slices or bacon.
"Sounds stupid."
"Like I used to wear." Cas clarified.
. It was good, so good, and Dean could feel the coil of heat low in his belly slowly start to tense.
"Whatever you think is best."
He reached his hand down again, and this time he didn’t flinch. He
Dean could've just left him at that, but instead he took the time to rearrange him; he fluffed the pillows under his head, he pulled the sheet up, making sure to keep him warm. He even went so far as to run a hand through his hair to sort out the flat patch on the top of his head to the scruffier look that Cas usually sported.
"As good-a-time as any." He replied, beginning to feed the mattress through the window. They were a floor above ground level, and while the boys had made bigger jumps before, they couldn't risk it with a comatose body in tow. Sam shoved it, hesitating for a fraction of a second. No demons appeared. The coast was still clear.
"So you do..."
"Yeah." Sam sighed. "You gotta admit, everything you did, everything... it was bad."
Sam pushed the covers from the bed, grabbing the mattress and taking it to the window, glancing outside.
Dean took another turn in the road. Cas clambered into the backseat, brushing against Dean as little as he could, though Dean still shied away to the car door as much as possible. He didn’t look at him, and he figured if he looked, he wouldn’t see any kindness there anyway. He didn’t deserve it.
"Earlier, when you called."
"I'm going to bed." He stated, and pushed past the angel, ignoring his brother and climbing into his bed, pulling the duvet up to hide his face. He didn't sleep for a while, even after the angel left the room and sat outside for the rest of the night, or after Sam had gone to sleep. It was light before Dean managed to drift off, and the dreams that he had didn't soothe him at all.
life?”
“Well.” Dean huffed, like he had won this round. Cas narrowed his eyes.
"That's great, Sammy. Did she say anything else? Did you talk about the weather?" Dean rattled impatiently.
Would John be proud of him right now? Maybe. What if John knew what he’d done earlier? No, definitely not. Wasn’t that what he’d wanted all his life, just for John to be proud of him again. To be John Winchester’s son.
“Cas… growing up, I had this picture of what my life was, what I would be, and it wasn’t what other people got. I didn’t get to dream about a wife and kids, I could only take what I could get. And with guys… I figured out young that men weren’t something I could want, but that I could… I could get what I needed from them. And they could get what they wanted from me. But having something real with a guy, that wasn’t just family or hunting…”
The more he walked, the worse it got. What had just been seething, burning rage, turned physical. He felt like he couldn't breathe, air not getting into his lungs fast enough, yet his lungs felt full to burst as air scraped down his throat. He felt too hot and too cold, he felt confined in the white wash walls of the hospital, crammed in by everything, and he felt miniscule, like an ant ready to be crushed by a boot.
Castiel cocked his head. "Is size relative to enjoyment?" He asked.
"I commandeered a car." She chuckled.
He remembered sitting down at the table, Charlie taking his chin in her hand and carefully running the lipstick across his mouth. He’d laughed, and she’d laughed, telling him off for moving. He’d been happy, spending time with his friend, the thrill of
“Yuhuh…” She said, and Dean realised her eyes had wandered, drifted over to a woman down the bar.
The entire hand jerked, spasming in Dean's now tight grip. Dean looked down, saw it move, before looking straight up to Cas's face, a split second before the man sat bolt upright, free arm flailing, gasping in deep for air like he hadn't breathed for a week. His bright blue eyes were wide open and alert, the deep shock of the journey shaking him bone deep.
A minute later Sam was back, handing the Styrofoam cup to Missouri.
Cas nodded in agreement, thinking of Dean alone in the bunker with Charlie for one more night. Part of him, a large part, wanted to go back to the bunker, the home they had found there, to see Dean and tell him about the hunt. Even if they argued, even if it led to frowns instead of smiles, even if Dean didn’t laugh as easy with him as he did with Charlie, it was still comfort, and Cas was happy there.
“You chose us.”
Cas stilled, his hands stuttering on the mans waist, but the crowd didn’t stop with him. It continued moving, pressing against him, pushing him to move and he felt off balance, unsteady on his feet, ready to topple at any second.
"Maybe he can't?" Sam suggested. "His mojo is draining, and he's already used some being at your damn beck and call."
"Livvie." He sighed. "Really not a good time. In fact, never is probably a good time."
"Nothing." Dean shrugged, but Sam wasn't buying it.
"You thought my presence would affect him positively?" Cas tilted his head in thought.
“Maybe he went exploring.” Dean straightened up, worry flitting across his face for a minute. He doesn’t know how much more there is to explore of the bunker, but he can’t figure there’s too much more. Maybe Cas went straight to the library.
Damn Cas.
"Nah," He sighed, clapping a hand on the smaller man's shoulder, who jolted under the pressure, surprised. Dean gave a little squeeze before letting go, smiling and looking to his knees. "Go get some shut eye. No point in falling asleep half way through this."
"Don't be a fool." She scolded. "He's healing, he's growing. It's a lot to take. You don't ask a caterpillar if it wants to be a butterfly."
Dean started taking note of all the furniture he thought would work well, snagging the throw he’d been eyeing up and throwing it over his arm too. That settee, that laz-e-boy. That coffee table would do well, and hell, get a TV while they’re here, the sign said it was in working order.
"Not to mention," Sam continued. "It looks like you might be needing a couple of bodyguards."
Sam looked over to Cas, who was standing there silently, but clearly watching eagerly. Sam noticed how quiet he was being, and frowned. "What did you do to Cas?"
"We're very reputable." Dean soothed as he walked in.
"Radioactive chamber." Dean commented, picking up the boxset and reading the title for the next film:
When they woke up in the morning it was all still there, all of it. It hadn’t been a stress dream cooked up while they took turns napping in the car, or a djinn situation (that they know of, how could they ever really rule that out), or a vivid daydream. They woke up in their
"Ah, we, uh..." Dean trailed off, glancing at Sam, who gave a small shrug. "We've just got stuff going on here, and someone needs to hold down the fort." He snapped the lid of his beer off and took a sip, looking away. As much as he liked the dweeby guy, he didn't want to explain. How could he really tell him? How could he start? Even just a fraction of a detail would lead to more questions, answers he didn't want to give. Sam could tell Garth later, if he wanted; just so long as Dean wasn't there. He didn't want the sad glances, the sighs, the "I'm sorry to hear that" and the sympathy. He didn't even want Garth to say that he might know a guy who knew a guy who might wake him up; he'd been let down too much already.
"Everyone said it was his choice, Dean." Sam reminded him. "He chose to wake up."
He felt himself sag, the adrenaline seeping out from him, and his chin drooped onto his chest. He took one more breath, letting it fill his chest, and he felt a shiver take him, goosebumps running over his skin under the robe. God, Cas was still standing there naked, wasn’t he cold?
“Eugh.” Dean grimaced.
"Chicks love ink on a guy." He pointed out by way of persuasion.
“Ours then.” Dean had said, and Cas had left Dean to it. Cas certainly had no claim on this place that was rightfully Dean and Sam’s, had no right to believe that they would let him stay here for as long as he needed, to create a home here. Cas couldn’t let himself hope that. There was every likelihood that once they had dealt with Crowley, once it was moderately safe in the world again for them all, they would take advantage of this newfound base. Maybe they would want it all to themselves, maybe Dean would find someone and move her in, create a family.
"I'm sorry." Cas said quietly. "He was a good man."
"Not just dead, you want him to suffer."
"Yeah, and this is different." Dean sighed. "We have lost... everything. And we get back... Cas comes back, and we lose him again."
"You didn't ask?"
"I have seen yours many times-" Kirsty raised an eyebrow as she prepared the aftercare. "I, in fact, recreated it. I know what it looks like."
was, what we needed to be in this life. Anything not his way, anything even
What in the damn hell?
"So?" Dean was practically yelling. "You're seriously saying you don't think we should go?"
“I’ll set Garth on it.”
Right now it was his quad. His left quad. It felt tight, stretched taught. Oh, and his hamstring. He could barely put his heel down.
Cas took a sip of the water in front of him as Dean waited expectantly, and Cas felt a certain amount of glee. He put the glass down before looking back to Dean. “Yes.”
"-Mandy," Dean corrected himself. "Says you were chatting for a while."
“Holy shirt, is this the Batcave?” She asked, and Dean looked at her, unable to not smile.
“Stomach of steel.” Dean grumbled, sitting up a little straighter. They hadn’t had lunch yet, he’d probably fix himself a sandwich soon. “Was just thinking about dinner.”
Each time he did that, it worked less and less.
"Why would she do that?"
He heard Sam’s voice, sharp and insistent.
“We’ll text.” Sam told her, and she sighed in relief. “And you?” She pointed at Cas. “It’s your turn on Words with Friends.”
“He’s ready. And like you say, this is a milkrun, probably not anything..”
"Told you you shoulda gone home." Betty smiled at Sam, her eyes turning back to the brown that they had been before. She grabbed Sam's head, forcing it back, and held the knife to his throat, ready to slit and a seconds notice.
“Sometimes things get said that people don’t mean, they think they mean in the moment, when they’re all post-coital and sweaty, but it’s all just hormones and crap.”
Dean squeezed his fingers again, and Cas stroked a thumb over his knuckles. “Did I ever thank you for that?” Dean asked.
