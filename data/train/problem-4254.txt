Not quite a kiss. Not yet.
It isn’t until they both slam the door of the bunker shut behind them that Dean realises he’s alone with Cas for the first time in two weeks.
Cas laughs. Dean scowls. “We have to talk to Sam and Eileen at some point too, you know,” he reminds Cas sullenly.
He can’t even resent her. She is kind, intelligent, beautiful, and more understanding of their intimate friendship than any girl Dean has casually dated in the past.
will you take him to that Taylor Swift concert.”
“I work here,” Sam repeats, his eyes flickering between the two of them with bemusement. “Are you guys here to fight or make out or—? Is this another bit? Like, are you doing a Brüno thing? Why are you—I don’t really get it.”
“Jeez, I’m sorry.” Sam holds a hand up in defense, not paying Dean half the attention he’s demanding with his hand to hip stance. “You
sounds the room as Sam collapses his head onto the bar in front of him, with Eileen rubbing his back. Dean thanks the God he doesn’t believe in for Eileen Leahy-Winchester every damn day.
He wants them to wash dishes together, shoulders touching, and lie in bed while they talk about their shitty days. Maybe their days will be less shitty if they’re together.
“Why would anyone walk outside without one?”
“If you pretend you don’t know what I’m talking about one more time, I’m going to slap you.”
“Dean—”
This was until his friendship with Dean Winchester started skewing his wiring with happy flickers of unpredictability.
“I think we will, however, struggle to find a store that sells paint on Christmas Eve. Any open store, stocking anything, in fact.”
“Guys, over here!”
“I’m sorry,” Castiel says, but there’s an echo. It’s Dean’s voice.
Everything’s quieter now.
Dean smiles, eyes falling shut. “We’ve gotta stop meeting like this,” he jokes, then burps loudly.
“Mm,” he mumbles in acknowledgment sleepily.
Cas has his hands clasped on the table, waiting for Dean patiently. Always fucking waiting in the wings for Dean.
It vanishes quicker than it arrived.
Maybe it’s because he’s a little drunk, his emotions are riding high, and it's spilling over regardless of Dean’s desire to cap it. Maybe it’s because he can’t go through it again, but this time, he manages to backtrack.
All in all, a pleasing thought that warms Castiel and makes him smile.
“Isn’t growing old with Cas a far more preferable option to you than settling down with the most perfect woman in the world?”
Last night was good, Castiel. If you’d like some more help getting over that ex of yours, give me a call and we can grab some ‘hot caffeinated beverages’ that you so enjoy.
“Not your vessel, man, you,” Dean says, getting Cas’ attention away from his annoyed observation over his knees. “Jimmy’s long gone. It’s just you in there. Your body is you. Sometimes it sucks, but there’s good things you’ll feel now too. Food, and um—you know—” Dean wonders why it’s starting to feel weird to talk about sex with Cas.
What’s bothering him is that he’s starting to think this wouldn’t be half-bad if it were for real.
“Even though it’s the truth.”
He was into Cas.
The key they couldn’t find is dangling from John’s hands, extended towards Dean who snatches at it viciously.
Dean starts feeling itchy in abstract places that he can’t mentally scratch.
“Ketchup is an ingredient,” he argues dazedly.
He could get used to this. He could definitely love his straight best friend and enjoy women for their company simultaneously. It’s a mental relief so grand it outweighs even the immense physical relief he’s just experienced.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Fuck, indeed,” says Cas dryly.
Cas opens the car seat and settles inside, cuts Dean off, pulls the seatbelt around him and then nags at Dean to do the same.
“Goodnight, Dean. I hope we can speak tomorrow.”
Cas’ cheeks go crimson.
“I don’t think therapists use forms of violence to assist their patients,” Cas mumbles, rubbing the side of his head.
“You’re so annoying,” Cas sighs, squeezing Dean’s hand even as he rolls his eyes.
Cas nods along understandingly, but his belly fills with nervous flutters and he purses his lips to prevent himself from beaming at the idea. Boyfriend.
“Don’t just say sure okay.”
Cas’ head is going to explode. His harried thoughts are bursting in his throbbing brain like popcorn kernels on high heat.
“Dean is here,” he hears himself mutter stupidly, then shakes his head, because Dean couldn’t be here. Why is Dean here?
“Fine,” he mumbles childishly, but his face betrays his petulance by quirking his lips at Cas. “You’re my favourite person you know. I wish I just stayed home with you today. It was a damn two-person job.”
“You’re certifiably insane,” Cas hums from behind a gargantuan hardback that covers his entire head. Dean knows his expression is probably a scene of disinterest.
“We have Santa hats,” Sam adds, “festive enough. I don’t think we don’t need an excuse to kiss who we want,” Sam consoles her, rubbing his eyes with the hilt of his palm. “We’ll see you two in the morning—”
“Dean, I am human now. You need to be more careful with me,” he teases.
Dean nods stupidly.
“I’m terrified, Meg. I’ve been terrified all night. Maybe my entire life,” he admits tautly.
seen you look at anyone the way you look at that man,” she volleys back ardently. “Sam and Cas, that’s a friendship that runs deep. Even you and Benny.”
Sam returns some time in the evening, arms overflowing with bags of food and clothes and more things than any human woman Eileen’s size would need. Dean’s nursing his fifth or sixth beer. When their eyes catch, they both make disapproving faces at each other.
Edit: Warning for a character’s use of homophobic slurs and aggressive language, emotional abuse, and a ton of angst
His sleep-addled brain clicks awake in an instant. “Is he okay?” Dean asks, already putting on his jeans. “And…er…boyfriend?”
“Hey, Cas?”
Cas is shaking. Dean is shaking.
“The winky-face asshole? Was it…that dick you met the night I came and picked you up?” he asks, teeth clenching in anger or anguish—he doesn’t know.
“I think you’ve not been listening,” Cas whispers, like it’s to himself. He sighs. “If you’ll let me, we can speak tomorrow. You need to either empty your stomach of the poison you’ve consumed or at least let me take you somewhere to sleep this off.”
"Of course it's okay to be nervous, Dean. I didn't say otherwise, did I?"
Castiel groaned as their telephone started to ring, glaring at it from his comfortable position on the living room couch. Dean was in the bathroom, which meant that
“Dean, can I ask you something?” Cas asked as they walked back into the main room and Dean started packing his things.
Dean really took his time preparing him, wanting to minimalize the pain for his lover by stretching him extra long and thorough with four fingers.
“Yes, Dean, I think you’re right and it would be wise to inform them about everything.” The angel lifted his hand to press two fingers to his lover’s forehead, but stopped midair before asking: “Do you wish to do this now or would you prefer to wait a little longer before visiting your parents?”
"We haven't", Dean explained. "We met Friday for the first time since back then." Now Bobby seemed even more bewildered.
I'll try to finish the next chapter quicker than I did this one!
"Good, I'm gonna ask her. See you tomorrow, Babe. I love you."
“Hey Dean, it’s me”, Sam called through the door. “Are you up yet?”
"Uh, yes? I was sure everyone at the hospital knew that. Dean's certainly not the best in keeping his hands to himself, even if we do try to be discreet, for the patients' sake", Dr. Novak mused, a soft smile grazing his features.
"One room with two beds, please", Sam said, and no, he wasn't just forgetting that Cas actually needed sleep now, he was just sick of his brother and the ex-angel making heart-eyes at each other and he was gonna continue trying to do something about it.
Three hours later, they stopped at a gas station because Sam had to go to the toilet. As soon as he was inside, Cas teleported himself right into Dean’s lap and the hunter gave a startled yelp. Cas leaned down and pressed their lips together forcefully, immediately slipping his tongue into his boyfriend’s mouth and kissing him breathless. Dean kissed him back enthusiastically, his fingers tangling in those soft strands of raven hair, messing it up even more. Cas grabbed his shirt tightly and grinded his hips down into Dean’s and the hunter was hard in a matter of seconds.
"So, you ready to rock this?" Dean asked, fiddling with his tie again, and looked up at Cas, who had apparently mojo'd himself into a matching carcoal tux. He looked stunning. Dean wasn't sure if he would be able to hold himself back from kissing him 'til the end of the ceremony. To make it easier to resist later on, he tugged Cas into a long, deep kiss by his tie. Cas eagerly reciprocated, his arms winding around Dean's neck, holding him close.
"Hey Dean", his father said, and Dean's trepidation melted away into something akin to anger.
"Of course, Dean. I'm happy I finally get to meet my father-in-law", Cas replied, turning in Dean's arms to kiss him tenderly. "Now, I hope you're hungry. Dinner's almost ready", he said with a smile, pecking Dean's lips one last time before turning back around to look after their food. Yes, he thought, he really did look forward to meeting the father of the love of his life.
On Friday, Dean picked Cas up after work and they immediately started their trip to Lawrence, Kansas, classic rock music blasting through Baby's speakers. Dean sang along happily, something he hadn't done in years, at least not that enthusiastically. Their hands were intertwined between them on the seat.
"Yes, Baby, c'mon, come for me", Dean encouraged between little kisses. "You're so hot, Cas, love you, ahh, love you so much."
"I am. We are. He's great, really. Dunno what I'd do without him.
Then he started undoing the angel’s pants, while said angel just snapped his fingers and Dean was completely naked. He groaned as his erection was finally freed of his jeans and quickly removed the rest of Cas’ clothes, before rolling his hips against his lover’s for much needed friction. They both moaned into their kiss at the sensation.
“Yes, your parents do share a heaven between the two of them”, the angel replied, following Dean up the steps. The hunter knocked on the door twice, then he waited for someone to let them in.
"And it worked out really well for you, from the looks of it." John finished the sentence for him, and Dean felt a huge smile split his face as he nodded his answer. "I'm happy for you, Dean," John continued, and it sounded sincere enough that Dean chanced a look up into his face to see his dad smiling at him softly. He returned the smile tentatively. The moment was broken by the oven beeping to announce that the pizza was done, followed only seconds later by the doorbell signaling Sam and Jess' arrival.
“I just assumed you were straight and I didn’t want to ruin our friendship by telling you how I feel.”
Dean had picked up his pace a little and found a good rhythm, one that Cas matched perfectly with his own thrusts. Since Cas had ridden Dean more than a few times by now, he was actually the one with more experience for once and prompted Dean's movements with his hands on the green-eyed man's hips. He made him circle them or had him do little figure-eights in his lap that had them both moaning loudly in no time.
As Cas reached the waistband, he sat up on his heels between Dean’s thighs, regarding the panties hungrily as his hands roamed all over Dean’s hips and stomach. He looked positively debauched already, eyes dark and hair even more of a mess than usual thanks to Dean’s own hands, his chest heaving with heavy breaths. Dean smiled to himself at the thought of getting his man so riled up with nothing but a flimsy piece of lacy fabric.
School's just ended and Dean Winchester, 17, is waiting in the parking lot for his little brother Sam. While he waits, Castiel Novak walks by and smiles at Dean when he sends a wink his way.
would be truly embarrassing. Dean drove at top speed all the time to arrive at the bunker as fast as possible.
Once inside, he was quick to explain the room situation to his brother.
…at some point”, Dean explained, grinning wolfishly. Cas kept his gaze trained on the tabletop, clearly embarrassed about what Dean was implying to the others, and Kevin and Sam looked clearly uncomfortable as well. Sam made a bitchface at Dean.
“C’mon, fuck me harder, yes, just like that, fuck,” Dean encouraged his lover, and was rewarded with a stuttering moan as Cas wobbled on the edge and Dean knew that it wouldn’t take much more to push him over. Reaching down, he wrapped a hand around his neglected cock, stroking in time with Cas’ movements. “Wanna feel you for days, Cas, wanna go back to that bar, oh fuck, go back and let them see me still walking- walking funny because you fucked me so good, fuck, you’re so good, baby, keep going, I’m so close…” Dean trailed off, stripping his cock furiously. Cas let his leg down to sit up between his thighs, gripping his waist and thigh as he proceeded to pound into him even harder.
The hunter closed his eyes and fell asleep minutes later, while Cas was perfectly happy with resting in his lover’s gentle embrace until Dean would wake up again.
Sam returned twenty minutes later, Dean and Cas still exactly like he’d left them. He handed his brother a bag with food and the car keys and went to his own room.
Dean’s lips left Castiel’s and he placed open-mouthed kisses along his jaw and neck. He had his hands in the angel’s hair, mussing it up even more, while Cas clawed at his back and shoulders. The hunter reached into his duffle bag, which he’d tossed beside the bed when he’d entered the room earlier and retrieved the bottle of lube. He placed it onto the sheets beside them and slid down Cas’ body, leaving soft kisses in his wake. The blue eyed man moaned and writhed underneath him, desperate for Dean to pay attention to his neglected cock.
For the rest of the weekend, Dean and Cas didn't leave
Eventually, Dean even got used to the idea of letting people know about them in public. Especially when someone’s gaze lingered just a tad too long on his /hot/ boyfriend. Then he’s grab Cas’ face and kiss him passionately, just to show everyone that he belonged to Dean. And when Dean was the one a girl tried to hit on, Cas would either glare at her until she got the hint and backed off, or he’d walk up to them and wrap his arms around his hunter tightly, kissing his neck, and Dean would lean down and playfully ask him why it took him so long to come over and ‘safe him’.
"Dr. Novak is preg-", he began, but Charlie shushed him hurriedly and glanced up and down the hall, glad to find it empty except for the two of them.
“Well, since it looks like we have to stay a little longer, I’ll just go get some food and a second room”, Sam explained.
The ceremony passed in a blur to Dean, and before he knew it they had both said their vows and he was crying and Cas was crying and most of the guests were crying, too (at least most of the human ones, while the majority of the angels just looked on stoically). Even his dad seemed somewhat moved by the whole thing, even as he stubbornly tried to appear cool.
"I always knew you two were made for each other", Mary gushed enthusiastically. "It's so good that you found each other again. I couldn't stand that everpresent emptiness in my son's eyes anymore, Cas. It was so terrible to see him suffer like that."
Panting, and so that Dean couldn't possibly miss what he was implying, he asked, "How far away is your house, Dean?"
"No. First I wanna know if it at least
"Yeah, I guess we could. His break starts right about now, too, right? Maybe he'll come in here", Jo mused, and just seconds later Dr. Novak stepped into the break room, looking a bit green in the face. Jo and Charlie threw each other a concerned glance before watching the dark haired man settle down at the table with his food. Neither of them had any idea what it was supposed to be, it definitely didn't look like something a normal person would eat in that combination.
“Seriously, guys? Do you really have to study me like that while I’m eating? Busy yourself with something else, will ya?”
"Uh, I thought you guys haven't seen each other since you were seventeen?" he asked, obviously confused as hell.
-- Cas showed mercy and finally, gently pulled the plug free completely, setting it on the sheets next to them. They’d used this same plug more than often in the past so Cas knew exactly just how prepared Dean already was and so slid his middle finger into the slick, tight heat without hesitation. Unconsciously, Dean’s hips shoved down to meet each thrust of that perfect, long, slender finger inside of him, silently asking for more, more,
"You're...uh...you're literally cuddling...with Cas right now, dude."
"What time is it?" Cas asked when he heard Dean's stomach rumbling.
“Come on, Cas. Why won’t you tell me? It can’t be that bad. What could possibly be bad about me seeing your wings? I mean, they’re really awesome, dude. I’m your best friend, you can tell me everything. I swear I won’t flip out. Please, Cas”, Dean pleaded, trying to give him the puppy eyes his brother always used to get whatever he wanted. Cas sighed and mumbled something under his breath, but Dean didn’t catch one word of what he’d said.
"Hey Babe?" he asked, and pressed a kiss into the angel's dark hair. The other man just hummed in response, prompting him to continue.
“Dean?”she asked, disbelievingly. He nodded and stepped forwards, pulling her into a tight hug. After a long moment, Mary pulled back and looked at Dean, and suddenly a look of pure horror spread over her features.
“Jerk.”
This time, he didn't hear Dean nearing the bed and nearly jumped off of said bed as something freezing cold touched his back, right between his shoulder blades.
By now, he was able to see them perfectly clear; he was pretty sure they wouldn’t get any more defined. He wasn’t sure why he hasn’t always been able to see them. He didn’t even know why he could see them at all.
Dean found his prostate easily and rubbed it briefly, making Castiel see stars, before he purposefully - and maliciously, in Cas' humble opinion - avoided it altogether.
and he didn't know if he should beg for more or ask him to stop torturing him with pleasure.
It felt all kind of surreal to both of them, especially the incredibly normalcy of the whole situation, as if they'd been together for ages, not hours.
Dean realized that he was smiling like an idiot, they both were, and they were also blocking the way for the other costumers. Dean pulled Cas over to a table and they sat down beside each other, even the distance that the table would put between them too much.
"I'm the Trickster, dumbass. It's not the first time I faked my death, that's not exactly news for you, right? But of course, I had to make an appearance to hand over my wedding gift, didn't I?" he said, gesturing in Mary's direction. Dean frowned.
It was really fucking sweet, and Sam found himself happy for them, but at the same time he wished he had someone to love as well. He already started to feel a little lonely at times, when he was in his own motel room on hunts, and sometimes he missed the old times when he and his brother would share a room.
(I might make some more edits later, but I gotta sleep now and I wanted to post today xD)
In this position, Dean didn’t have much possibility to move, so he wrapped his arms around Cas’ waist and pulled him down into every thrust. He leaned in and kissed Cas, their tongues tangling as they kissed each other breathless. Their new position causes the head of Dean’s cock to hit the angel’s prostate full-on and Cas cried out in pleasure. When Dean breaks the kiss and looks at his lover, his breath got caught in his lungs for a moment.
His hips bucked up involuntarily as Dean began tongue-fucking him, and he writhed on the bed, not even caring that this was the complete opposite of 'cooling him down'.
Dean almost laughed at the way his mother's eyes went so wide he thought they'd pop outta her head, but he held back and just stood there with a big, goofy smile on his face instead.
"Talk to me. In German. Please", Dean begs, putting on his best imitation of his brother's puppy dog eyes. Cas rolls his eyes fondly.
Dean reached down and fumbled with the buttons and zippers on their pants, but Cas pushed him away a little with his hands still on his chest. Dean sat back, straddling his hips, and looked at him questioningly.
While eating, they all used the special occasion to talk to their lost loved ones, already dreading the end of the day when some of them would return to earth while the others had to stay up here. Dean was especially saddened about having to leave his mom again, like he was every time when he saw her, when they did a time jump to the past or as he and Cas had visited her and John in heaven before the wedding. Although, he thought that it would be even worse for Sam, who had spent a great part of the day talking to her. After all, he'd never really known her and had even less memories of her than Dean had and the older brother wished he could grant him more time with Mary, somehow.
"I know, I know. I didn't mean to, it just...slipped out", Charlie explained sheepishly. Jo sighed.
“Of course, Angel. What is it?”
He hadn’t really adjusted to seeing this side of his brother mostly since they came together, although that had been ten months ago. But he was happy for Dean, he deserved some happiness after all those horrible things they’d faced over the years. Sam smiled a small smile and finished his salad.
“Dean you – you and Cas…you have…you will…?” he stuttered. Dean raised an eyebrow at him mockingly.
"Deaaan", he whined. "Stop that. It's too hot."
After they were naked, he continued taking his time, kissing and touching every inch of Cas' gorgeous body, worshipping him with his own. Cas was pliant and lax beneath him, just enjoying the treatment Dean gave him, the slow build-up to the main event.
"Come on Dean, get up! I'm gonna get the water going immediately."
"I think you forgot something, Dean-o", Gabe called cheerily, shaking him out of his stupor. He took a few steps forwards, coming up to stand right in front of the archangel.
They ate their breakfast in silence and when they got up to leave, Dean took the napkin and threw it into the wastebasket. The waitress looked disappointed, Cas looked smug and Sam was just irritated and confused as hell.
“Well, he has seen Star Wars…but mostly he gets a little…
“Of course Dean, it would make me very happy to marry you!” he beamed and let Dean slip the ring onto his ring finger. They continued their kiss after that, lips sliding against each other softly and tongues dancing sensuously. Their kisses turned lazy soon, as they were still tired and sated from their earlier love-making. They cuddled together under the thick, warm blanket and held each other firmly as they drifted off into sleep.
“Hey, uh, Cas?” Dean started, later, they were at his house now and Dean was playing video games while Cas had his nose buried in a thick book.
It didn't take long, however, for his rhythm to falter, letting Cas know that he was close. He clenched down purposefully and grinned at the little groan it earned him. He repeated the action a few times and soon Dean was pushing in as far as he could go before stilling completely and Castiel could feel his hot come filling him up from the inside.
Finally, they had to break apart for some much-needed air, and Dean let his head drop back onto the pillow with a satisfied smile. “Cas.”
“Uh-hu. Whatever, I’m gonna take a shower”, he said and then he was gone again. Dean wondered what was wrong with his little brother. Shouldn’t he be happy for Dean?
At home, Dean cooks lunch for Sam, who - even though he's only 13 - is a gigantic nerd and much too mature for his age. He also has the annoying ability to tell whenever his brother isn't feeling well. And he usually doesn't stop asking him about it until Dean tells him.
"Sorry, Dean, but that was the last room they had and I guessed that it would still be better than searching another motel", he said, trying to sound convincingly apologetic. He was left stunned when Dean just shrugged, called dibs on the first shower and disappeared into the bathroom.
The hunter discovered that this angle did wonders for his prostate, so he stayed like that for now and peppered kisses and little bites all over Cas' neck and shoulders. Cas had his arms wound tightly around Dean's waist as he thrust up into his hole, moaning at the feeling of Dean's heat around his rock hard dick.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean started shuddering on top of Cas, his fingers digging into the blue-eyed man's chest as he could feel his orgasm building inside of him. Unable to rise himself up and down anymore, he resolved to rocking back and forth on Cas' thick cock, grinding down and taking him in as deep as possible.
"Okay, well, I think I'm allowed to be a little nervous, I'm getting married to an angel in - barely an hour, after all", Dean snapped, sparing a glance at his watch.
"Ugh, Charlie, you're such a genius sometimes", Jo groaned, incredulous.
except Star Wars.”
“Well, Sam wasn’t that smart”, Dean countered. Kevin looked at the younger Winchester disbelievingly. Sam just shrugged and raised his hands in surrender.
“Cas”, he breathed, “how are you, man? You kinda scared the shit outta me earlier.”
Cas howled, hands scrambling for something to hold onto as he was overwhelmed by mind-blowing sensations. It felt
"Sorry, I uh- I should- I really should get to work now, guys," she stammers, grabbing her mug off the counter and fleeing the kitchen quickly. "See you around," she calls over her shoulder before disappearing around the next corner. Dean turns to face his fiancé.
"Mornin'", he grumbled back, before realizing that it was actually far from 'morning'. He heard Dean chuckle and then footsteps retreating down the hallway.
, Cas”, Dean said suggestively, smirking at his angel as he looked at Dean from the bed. An expression of understanding dawned on his handsome face and suddenly he was standing behind Dean in the bathroom. Dean turned and chuckled.
“Of course I can, Dean. I wouldn’t have said so otherwise”, Cas deadpanned.
And he
Cas startled and his eyes flew open when he felt his dick being infulged by tight heat.
"Huh. Oh and I'm sorry you're not feeling too well lately, Babe. I wish I could do something about that. But I'm sure the morning sickness will get better soon, the books said the first three to four months are usually the worst, right?" Dean asked, looking at Cas with endless amounts of love, care and concern in those incredibly green eyes. Cas smiled at him softly, pulling him back down to once again rest his head on his shoulder. He closed his eyes, a sudden sleepiness overcoming him. Just yet another side effect of the tiny life growing inside him.
Dean, harder, ahh...” Cas moaned constantly, and Dean complied happily, thrusting his hips upwards a little harder and faster. Dean felt himself getting close, and he leaned forward to kiss and suck at Cas’ jaw line, sucking a bruise there. The angel moaned and clenched around him, his cock leaking pre-cum. He reached down and wrapped one hand around his own length, stroking in time with Dean’s thrusts.
His brain was in practically the same situation as the cubes in his ass, molten from heat as well as pleasure, so it really was no wonder that Cas completely missed Dean getting the lube out of their bedside drawer. He whined when Dean retracted his tongue and finger, but they were soon replaced by two slicked up digits.
“I love you, too”, he sighed, just before he started to shudder heavily as he came, bringing Dean right over the edge with him as his hole clenched and fluttered around him. Dean groaned as he buried his head into Cas’ neck and worked them both through their orgasms.
Cas would stand in the bunker’s kitchen and attempt to bake a pie for Dean when the hunter would step up behind him and slide his strong arms around Cas’ slim waist. He would rest his chin on his fiancé’s shoulder and just hug him tightly from behind, as if he wasn’t planning on ever moving away again. The angel would have this small, happy smile grazing his soft lips – the one only Dean ever got to see – while he’d continue baking, trying to ignore Dean’s lips pressing tender kisses to the exposed skin if his neck and his hands slipping beneath the hem of Cas’ t-shirt – one of Dean’s; slightly to big for him but oh-so comfortable and home-ly.
“Shut up, Sammy.”
"I told you before that it is highly enjoyable", Cas answered matter-of-factly. Dean chuckled lightly.
Dean couldn't help but smile at the concern in Cas' huge blue eyes and he leaned in to kiss him again.
"Dean? What the hell are you doing up here? Shit, you're not dead again, are you?"
"Whose heaven would you like to visit first?"
"It's okay, Dean. I know I don't have the right to expect anything else."
Anyway, I hope you enjoy this little continuation :)
John and Mary made their way to their front row chairs as Dean took another minute to ground himself. They had decided to walk down the aisle together, and Dean took Cas' hand in his, grasping it so tightly that he was sure it would bruise if he were a human being.
He’s also finally getting some back.
“Whatever that means,” she scoffs, “but yeah. Two queens, take it or leave it.”
“This is all okay,” he assures to Cas’ mildly stunned face. “Very okay, in fact.”
This is why it’s particularly upsetting that his mouth doesn’t cooperate with his brain when he babbles out to the boy, “I like your freckles.”
“You both realise you are in public, right?” Benny drawls, watching them apathetically. “Incorrigible, you boys are.”
“It’s good to see you smile,” Dean says hesitantly, inspecting his fingernails and avoiding Castiel’s gaze, “but why did you get so drunk, Cas?” His voice isn’t angry like Castiel has come used to expecting. It’s tender. It’s worried. Castiel leans in more, presses further into Dean’s side, until Dean has to lift his arm away and set it behind on Castiel’s shoulders.
“Heya Cas.” This voice is familiar. This voice is the one he could listen to until the end of the world. It’s cheerful right now, a touch false in said cheer, but it’s still layered in kindness and affection and a bit gruff and—Dean.
“Oh, Cas, you wound me,” Dean belly-laughs, “I can’t believe an angel like you would do that to his own boyfriend.”
Dean swallows.
“I’m not over it.”
“I’ll get the yes.” Dean swings his legs onto Cas’ lap just to be a jerk and Cas, certainly annoyed, instantly shoves them off more roughly than usual. “I got you to set a bag of shit on fire in Henriksen’s office senior year and you were on course to becoming valedictorian."
Dean sucks in a pained breath that roughens his aching throat. He wants Cas’ face in his view again, not to plead for help again, but just for a bit of support like it always should have been. He glances sideways, but Cas was already bent over his seat to face Eileen. He’s signing too fast and for too long for Dean, the driver, to catch all of it. Dean’s also not as good at signing as Cas is yet because, well, Cas surpasses him in a lot of erudite ventures.
Dean’s eyes crinkle at the corners with mirth. It sends Cas’ relief to wondrous heights to see the glitter of joy that still thrives between them no matter how bad things get. He often feels like he’s walking on a tightrope where he may teeter off at any moment, sending their friendship into an abyss the moment one verbalized thought reveals where his heart lies.
“Okay. Let’s go deal with this then,” Cas replies more firmly, already pulling on a shirt and joggers. “Get dressed, Dean. I’m sure Sam is already hugging his knees in a corner somewhere, rocking back and forth. We don’t want to traumatise him further.”
“You’re welcome, Cas,” he replies, his eyes crinkling from the upturned stretch of his lips. Castiel wishes he could frame that smile and keep it close to his heart.
It’s been chipping away for many, many, many years. It’s been crumbling quicker since last night, and tumbling to almost nothing this morning.
Everything spirals again.
“I like weird. Everyone else is boring.”
This was the funniest thing Dean’s heard in awhile. He chortles, enjoying how honest he can be in this moment. “Yeah, turns out not so much. Really not so much.”
Cas exhales. “I know there’s a lot more to come but I think that went well so far, don’t you?”
“Is this what this is? A date?” Cas asks, eyes widened in disbelief.
“Fuck,” he says with relief, “fuck, that feels good to say. I’m so sorry. I’m sorry for everything. Can you…” He’s got one foot held in alleviated pain and the other in terror. “Cas, please forgive me.”
Dean’s feeling a little bitter now too.
“Bet you’re getting up to way more than sleeping now, aren’t you, Dean?” Garth reaches across the table to poke him jauntily.
Sam shuts Cas’ bedroom door behind them with a resounding thwump. Eileen’s giggles trickle through their walls.
Cas pales. Dean, again, feels disgusted with himself. He has to cover his face with his hands, press down on his eyeballs so they don’t water.
“It’s alright,” Castiel says, his fervour lightening into a softness for Dean. “I’m sorry too for my reaction, and…thank you. Thank you for apologising.”
“I fell in love with Dean before any girl even caught my eye,” Cas spouts off like this is the big confession that he’s finally getting to pour from his chest. “I wasn’t that interested in other men. I tried sex with women and enjoyed it. I suppose I’m just Dean-sexual.” He chuckles. It comes out sad.
He squints so infinitesimally that if Dean had blinked, he would have missed that micro-expression of unbridled confusion.
“Why do you give a shit?” he demands angrily instead. “It’s not like I’ve been raking in any best friend of the year awards lately. Why are you sitting here, throwing me a fucking pity party as if the ones I throw for myself aren’t enough? Why did you stay when I asked you to? Why didn’t you just punch me in the face and walk out again? Why did we get breakfast, and why did you tell me my soul was beautiful or whatever that weird fucking thing was at the staircase? Why aren’t you fucking livid with me? Why don’t you hate me?”
“Whatever, assholes,” Sam waves a hand, then takes the same hand to rest on Eileen’s waist who sags tiredly onto him. “Merry—whatever.”
“Cas,” he croaks. “Do you—do you not feel—at all weird about this?”
“You first.”
“—finding any excuse to touch him—”
“I guess we both have trouble listening sometimes,” Cas remarks lightly with a smile as he shoulders past Dean towards the fridge. He’s jibing at him like they’re friends. Dean doesn’t fight the stupid grin that appears.
“And his hair. I’d rather stroke that than a damn cat. It’s really soft. Have you felt it?”
“That’s why you’re borrowing Sam’s clothes? You’re going out? Out where?” He realises he’s starting to sound like a nagging wife but he can’t seem to stop himself.
I'm thinking of perhaps adding a chapter as a second series to this, having a look at Dean and Cas later on in life - a snapshot, somewhat, of their future where their relationship is more established and Dean has come to accept himself more fully. I probably won't be able to help myself, so let me know if anyone would be interested in some kind of work like that :)
They pull up onto a dusty driveway littered with motorbikes and hummer trucks. Harvelle’s Roadhouse glitters above an old and dilapidated building, with the R flickering every now and again to give the impression of Toadhouse, something Dean has teased Jo about endlessly and offered to fix for Ellen, also endlessly. Her thanks came in the form of slapping him across the back of the head with a dish towel and telling him she doesn’t need his charity.
“They appear intoxicated.”
“Yes, I believe it was you that said my ‘look’” he does finger quotes and it makes Dean smile, “is comparable to that of a holy tax accountant.” He grimaces. “Or a third-tier agent.”
“Because I needed to go to the bathroom!” Benny scowls at him from the side as they make their way towards the impala. “Andrea dropped me off and took the car. You said you’d give me a ride home. Have you knocked your head?”
He’s pretty. Like girls are, like guys can be sometimes. Dean sometimes thinks—knows—he wouldn’t care what body Cas was in, as long as it’s Cas in there. It would have just been a lot easier if he had been a girl. Something dad did give him talks about. Something he has experienced and understood.
It’s a soft and easy moment against tides of grey and uncertainty.
“Your logic is idiot-proof,” Cas says sarcastically, rolling his eyes.
“You said that’d be gay,” Castiel says dumbly, not entirely sure why his useless, hungover brain supplied him with that to say.
Sam and Eileen share a giggle.
“Now, I’m fully awake, asshole, you gotta entertain me,” Dean says with a shit-eating grin. It vanishes when a pillow smacks into his face, planting him straight onto his back.
Cas flits a glance sideways at Dean. “You know...Thoreau once wrote that it’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see. I’m sure that Sam doesn’t look at this picture of us and see anything beyond what’s here—which is...just us, being us. A slightly different snapshot of our life is happening before his eyes, that’s true, but we are still happening too, as us, and if I’m being honest, Dean, I don’t really feel like we’ve been acting any differently around Sam and Eileen as we have before, which is to say when we were...not...a fake couple...I mean—bar a few kisses here and there—” Cas stops abruptly and purses his lips in what looks like an effort to silence himself.
– want to show all these people that I’m yours, huh?”
After a long time, Dean pulled back to really look at him. Cas still had that same messy hair that looked as if he'd just fallen out of bed. He was wearing a tan trench coat that Dean was sure only he could pull off. He had light stubble and pale skin and, in Dean's opinion, he was even hotter than when they were teenagers. Cas reached up and gently brushed a stray tear from Dean's cheek with his thumb, his own tears threatening to spill over.
Cas felt his shoulders slump in defeat as he realized how idiotic he’s been behaving for the past twenty minutes or so. He dragged a weary hand though his hair and sighed. “I’m sorry, Dean. I was being ridiculous. What happened at the club—"
"What are ya doin', babe?" Dean grumpled sleepily, irritated by his husbands behavior. Cas shushed him gently.
- and a small smile grazing both their faces while they slept on. Sam
“Nothing”, Dean answered innocently and took Cas’ hand under the table. The angel squeezed his hand briefly in response. Sam didn’t notice any of this. When their waitress came back with their food, she’d written her number onto Dean’s napkin. Cas tensed a little but the hunter didn’t spare a glance at her and he was still holding Cas’ hand beneath the tabletop, so he relaxed again.
Dean hummed in agreement and made Cas moan loudly as he sunk two fingers into his hole and scissored them apart while moving them in and out of Cas’ body. The angel thrust back against the fingers inside of him.
After a few minutes, Dean scissored his fingers one last time before sliding them out entirely. Then, there was a lengthy pause were Dean didn't touch him at all.
Once they had Mary settled into the room next to Dean and Cas' and the newlyweds were back in their own room, the exhaustion came back full force. Dean barely managed to strip out of his suit before he collapsed face-first onto the bed. He was distantly aware of Cas getting undressed, too, and climbing into bed next to him. Then, the blankets were suddenly, magically, on top if him and Cas was wrapped around him like an octopus, and seconds later Dean was fast asleep, his last thought being
"...and?" Dean asked, stretching the word.
"Hey Cas", Dean beamed, walking over and kissing him softly. Bobby cleared his throat pointingly.
John obviously needed a little more time to process everything, and Dean already feared that he’d hate him for this, but then he finally stood up and embraced them as well. Dean breathed a sigh of relief and smiled at Cas happily, planting a quick peck to his lips. His father grimaced for a split second at that, but Dean pretended not to notice and Mary glares at her husband disapprovingly.
(See the end of the chapter for
He decides to call his boyfriend and tell him about his plans before he does anything else. He picks up his smartphone and dials Cas' number. On the second ring, he picks up.
After he'd lost against Cas, he resettled his gaze on Dean, who was desperately trying to come up with something - anything - to say, but was thankfully saved by his mom, who had been talking to Ellen and was now coming towards them quickly.
. So he’d pulled his boyfriend into his lap and kissed him, deep and slow and passionate, so that she’d definitely get the message. The next time she’d come to their table, she told them that they were “A really, really cute couple”. Dean had groaned in embarrassment while Cas just sat there beaming at him and Sam had a hard time holding back his laughter.
Dean sighed. Now came the part he feared the most. He knew exactly that his father wasn’t really fond of homosexuality (even if Dean wouldn’t consider himself as gay, since he’d never liked another man before Cas) and he was pretty nervous about telling him. But he loved his angel and he wanted both his parents to be there when they’ll get married. Dean took a deep breath before he started again.
“I love you, Dean”, Cas whispered against his lips, as if he feared he’d said it too early. But dammit, Dean has been waiting for this for years, and he really couldn’t be any happier right now.
"Is that...bad? I mean, I'd understand if you don't want to be with someone as inexperienced as I am", Cas said uncertainly. Dean kissed him again.
"Okay. Let's- let's do this," Sam conceded finally.
"I will support whatever decision Dean makes. His happiness is what's most important to me," he answered sincerely, smiling at Dean the whole time.
his heart pounding inside his chest.
“Don’t be so crude,” Benny repeats with a pensive hum. “Isn’t that Cas’ catchphrase? You’re sharing sound bites now, along with everything else?”
Thank you for everyone that's stuck with me and my story :) I appreciate you all very much!
“Guessing you did fuck someone. Congratulations. Mission accomplished. You gonna go back for round two tonight? Or are you meeting this chick or dude or whatever for your hot caffeinated beverage?” His tone is toxic, his face even more poisonous, and Castiel flinches at this bitter and dark side of Dean that he wishes he could help gentle.
“But—but—why—why did you tell him—”
sorry, and before he can explain himself, Cas has hauled one of Sam’s arm, the size of a python, over his shoulder. Dean hastily makes himself of similar use.
It’s not just bothering him. It’s paralysing him with horror.
Bad timing, such bad timing that Dean almost bursts out with a snigger, but he’s never seen Cas’ arms bare before and he realises they look…nice. Like a lot of things about Cas. He’d like to run a hand down one.
“Your boyfriend’s here,” the voice says, interrupting his mournful musings.
“I can afford a motel room somewhere outside town for a couple of days,” Cas ventures once they’re settled inside the Impala with the heat running. “We’re lucky the gas tank is full though. Is your hand okay? It looks sore—”
“Dean? What just happened there?”
“Look, son. I’m not going to pretend I know all the correct terms to use. If you’re happy, it shouldn’t bother you or anyone else what you call yourself,” he says seriously.
Saliva that’s come from Dean’s mouth, which had been on Castiel's, their lips and tongues exploring one another’s. He fretted as he stirred to consciousness that it had all been a vivid dream, borne of fantasy, and yet Dean is still here, holding Castiel to his own body like he’s afraid to let go.
on me.”
plan in the entire world!” he roars and reaches across the space between himself and Dean to give him a hard shove. “You are fucking insane!”
“I guess you want to call this off, then,” he mumbles without looking at Cas either. His stranglehold on the wheel clenches.
Dean balks. “Did you just swear?”
“Cas, you know I—I…” Dean bites his lips and his shoulders quiver with some kind of restraint. “Cas, I…I really…fuck.” He tightens his hold of their hands and says, eyes squeezed shut, “just give me a second.”
“Last night was fine,” Dean assures, the heavy pressure of guilt pressing into the pit of his stomach. He sits himself on the floor next to his brother and pats him on the shoulder. He realises that Cas is standing in front of them now and he locks eyes with him when he says, “we all say and do stupid shit, Sam.”
to tell me what to do, huh?”
When they would just walk down the street, holding hands, lots of people – mostly women – would throw them lingering glances, often seeming disappointed or even jealous. Dean would always grin smugly and wrap an arm around Cas’ waist, pulling him as close as possible as they walked.
but at the same time it was
, if he riled him up just a little bit.
“Hey, hey it’s ok, really. We’ve sorted things out, everything’s fine with us. And it’s not like I’m not used to women hitting on me”, Dean smirked, “but I’ll have to tell all of them ‘no’ for what will hopefully be the rest of my life”, he said with a brief glance at Cas, who couldn’t hide a huge smile at Dean’s last words. Dean couldn’t help but wonder when he became such a sap. Lara beamed at them.
“What?” Dean interrupted, “that guy? Nothing even happened with him. Plus, it definitely wasn’t the first time something like this happened and you’ve never reacted like this before.”
That's why he's decided to tell them. He was already freaking out about it, but he would do it. He can do this.
“You comin’?” he asked Cas.
“What do you think, shall we head back to the bunker now?” he asked his boyfriend, who nodded enthusiastically.
He paid and took the offered key before heading out to meet Dean and Cas and go to their room.
Obviously, Jo just told Cas something funny, because the blue-eyed teenager was laughing loudly, head thrown back and eyes crinkling at the corners.
"I understand that, Dean, but I can assure you that Gabriel told us the truth. If it would help you, I could go back to heaven and check on your father for you?" Cas offered, taking Dean's hand in his own comfortingly. Dean thought about it briefly, then shook his head.
"You think I'm irresistible, huh?" Dean says with a grin, waggling his eyebrows suggestively. Cas rolls his eyes.
Cas cried out and arched his back when Dean found what he supposed was his prostate and rubbed against it several times. The blue-eyed man didn't even notice the third finger entering him as he was caught up in the new, intense sensations.
Cas averts his gaze and he can feel the blush creeping up his cheeks.
At some point, Dean and Cas had switched seats and Cas drove the rest of the way. He felt truly honored that Dean trusted him enough to let him drive his baby. They drove the whole night and arrived in Lawrence in the early morning hours.
After telling his mom about his day, as requested, he went upstairs and decided to call Charlie. He was sure that she would know what to do. Even if she couldn't help, he really needed someone to talk about this or he was sure he'd explode.
“Love ya, Babe”, Dean whispered as he closed his eyes and started to drift off into sleep.
," he answered with a flirty wink. "And Cas? Please don't ever mention Sam's name again while you're talking to me in your sex voice, okay?" Cas laughed and watched as Dean took his phone again and visibly steeled himself before searching Sam's number in the contacts.
"Dean?"
“Uh…nearly eight months by now…” Dean answered. Charlie gaped at him.
"Really?" Dean whispers, sounding almost...
Sam stared at him, wide-eyed. They had been together for two months? What the fuck?! He'd been trying to get them to admit their feelings for one another and they had been a couple all along? Goddamn, he felt like such an idiot right now.
"Jeez, Cas, you want me to die from a heart attack before we're even hitched?!" he exclaimed, hand resting above his heart for extra dramatic effect.
"I just didn't know that you're- together that's all," she answers sheepishly. Dean's still confused, but Cas steps in smoothly.
The dead people looked at him curiously once again. "We're going to marry in heaven. Cas can get the few people who are still alive up here for a few hours and then he'll bring us back down again", Dean explained. After that, they sat together for another hour or so, Dean and Cas once again being bombarded with questions about their relationship and what son of a bitch they dealt with recently, before Cas flew them back into their bedroom in the bunker.
"Ash's. I bet he'll be able to bring the others there too", Dean answered after a few seconds. Cas stood and took his hand, pulling him to his feet, and Dean leaned in for a brief kiss before bracing himself for the flight. He closed his eyes, and with a ruffle of feathers they were standing in Ash's replica of the Roadhouse.
“Right, Dean, I am starving. But you also haven’t answered my question yet.
The other patrons of the diner looked mostly slightly shocked, but they seemed to either agree with Sam or be afraid to say something, because neither of them made a move on him. Dean and Cas sat still frozen in their seat, while Sam just sat back down as if nothing had happened and the homophobic guy stumbled out of the diner.
After just a few more strokes and thrusts, the angel came, scream muffled by Dean’s lips on his. Cas’ muscles clenched rhythmically around Dean, his inner walls pulsating as his orgasm ebbed of slowly. The hunter’s hips stuttered before he came too, spurting deep inside his lover with a deep groan.
Sam and Dean had just finished a case and were getting ready to leave their motel room and head back to the bunker, when suddenly Castiel popped into the room and just collapsed onto the floor in an unconscious heap.
“Hey, Cas?”
Dean startled as he heard someone stomping up the stairs. He sat up and quickly wiped the tears of his face. Not a second later, his door slammed open and Cas dashed into his room, spotting Dean on the bed and coming towards him rapidly.
They got back into the Impala, Cas in the backseat, and started their trip back to the bunker. Dean kept glancing at Cas through the rearview mirror and every time the angel would catch his gaze and smile that tiny smile of his. It made Dean want to kiss him right then and there, but sadly that wasn’t possible. He’d have to wait four more hours until they’d be at home.
So now, he was on the verge of going crazy, the realization so random and sudden he was completely caught off guard. He tried not to let anything show in his expression and continued to eat, lost in thought.
“I’m sure he’ll get over it”, Cas said reassuringly. “Come on, Dean, let’s just go to bed, okay? I don’t want to discuss your father’s narrow-minded views right now. Please just let it go for now, okay?” he pleaded and stood up to shed his clothes. Dean sighed but followed suit and they both stripped down to nothing quickly before they slipped beneath the warm blankets. They cuddled together with Cas as the little spoon and fell asleep soon after.
to watch porn and masturbate in the middle of the night?” he complained, instead of saying good morning. Dean turned and looked at him questioningly.
or something to flirt with everyone, as far as he can tell it's just him. He thought he's made it pretty clear that he's not interested but he's been here for three years now and she doesn't seem to be giving up any time soon.  "You seem to be in a good- wait. Since when are you
“ He was cut off by the incredulous stare Dean directed at him. He broke the eye-contact, ashamed of his accusations. Dean pulled him into his arms and hugged him tightly.
“Hey Cas?” he whispered, hoping the other man hadn’t fallen asleep yet. He let out a relieved sigh when he got a questioning hum in response. “So, um. You know…the lease for my apartment? It’s up in like, three months.”
"Good?" Dean asked from behind him, caringly. All Cas could manage was a jerky nod and a desperate whimper, but it was enough for the blond to understand.
It was late night when they concluded that the party should slowly come to an end, since most of the human guests were too tired to function anymore, no matter how hard they fought to stay awake to prolong their stay. Reluctantly, they all went to say goodbye to everyone who had to stay - which ended in another sea of tears - before they made their way to the freshly married couple and Cas took them back to the bunker.
Mary nodded, dumbfonded, and he rushed past her and up the stairs in a blur. What the hell?
He walks into the little room serving as a coffee kitchen on his floor of Sandover Inc. Lisa Braeden is standing at the counter, apparently waiting for the coffee to be ready. There's no one else in the room besides the two of them.
from Sam. Kevin groaned and then mumbled a sleepy
"Oh God, Dean", Cas breathed as he let his body adjust to the familiar feel of Dean's thick cock deep inside him. After a minute, he began to roll his hips slowly, teasingly. They had time, and he wanted to draw this out as long as possible. Besides, it was still way too hot and he was still too exhausted for hard, fast and dirty, especially if it was him who was gonna have to do all the work here.
"Of course, son. I understand. I just - I was in rehab these past two years, y'know? Therapy and all included. I checked myself in after nearly drinking myself to death and the realisation how lonely I was for the past eight years. I mean, of course I knew that loosing you two on top of Mary was the worst that could ever happen to me but I also know that it was no one's fault but mine. And I'm - well I'm
Twenty minutes later, they were sitting in the first diner on their way, Sam opposite of Dean and his angel, and ordered their breakfast. Sam and Dean ordered pancakes, while Cas, unsurprisingly, took nothing. Their waitress smiled broadly, especially at Dean, and walked away. Sam, who had noticed that his brother hadn’t returned her flirting, lifted an eyebrow at him. Dean shot him a questioning look.
"Yeah, you can say that again. That's the best thing to ever happen to me, Cas. God, it's been too long. But now, spill. What are you doing here in South Dakota?" Dean asked curiously, hoping that Cas wouldn't have to leave again soon.
Dean looked up as he heard him approach and undoubtedly smelled the delicious aroma of his favorite dessert. His eyes lit up as Cas settled next to him again and handed him one of the plates.
"A second chance," Dean answered, glancing up at Cas. He sent him an encouraging smile before both of them looked down at the phone when Sam spoke again.
Dean got out of the chair and straddled Cas without breaking the kiss. He ran his fingers through that incredibly soft, raven hair, messing it up even more. His lips left the angel’s and he started to kiss down his jaw and neck, leaving small bruises in his wake. Cas moaned softly beneath him. Dean sat up shortly to get rid of his t-shirt and Cas started to stroke his slender hands across his muscular chest and stomach. The hunter let himself enjoy the attention briefly before he began to work at the angel’s shirt buttons. After every button he leaned down to kiss the newly exposed skin. He then motioned for Cas to sit up slightly so he could slip the trench coat, suit jacket and button-down from his arms and throw them onto the floor.
"Good. But let's go tomorrow, okay? I think I just want to spent the day in bed for once", Dean said, yawning. Cas nodded in agreement and they stayed inside the bathtub a little longer before drying off and going back to bed. They tangled together under the blankets, facing each other, their limbs entwined so that they could be as close to one another as physically possible in this position. They exchanged kisses and talked about this and that for some time, before falling asleep again.
“Is Cas ok?” came the next question from Sam.
They stood like this until there was enough water in the huge tub, then Dean stepped away and into the hot water. He settled down slowly and Cas climbed in, too, and straddled him. The water was hot and relaxing and they just relished in it's warmth a little, exchanging soft kisses.
"Baby, I literally
After a few seconds, though, he felt Dean gently grasp his chin, turning his head so he was forced to look at him again. The cocky smirk was back in place and Cas frowned at him. “What?”
. He took a deep breath, pulled back, and looked into his angel's eyes.
"Dean--", Cas said, but Dean ended the call before he could finish. Dean threw the phone against the wall and collapsed back onto his bed.
After a few more moments, Dean broke the kiss with a gasp only to lean in close and put his mouth to Cas’ ear. “You’re so hot when you’re angry,” he said and pulled back, trademark cocky grin firmly in place. Eyes narrowing, Cas ignored the comment in favor of wiping the smirk off Dean’s face by kissing him absolutely senseless. God, but Dean could be so infuriating, making a joke out of everything – even some idiot trying to force himself on him. Of course, Cas knew that Dean was very much capable of defending himself but
Eventually, Dean got up to make breakfast. No one else was already awake. He went into the kitchen and made pancakes, Cas’ favorite.
___________________________________________________________________________________
"Don't worry about your old man, Dean-o. I created a replica of her to stay with him. Now, if you tell one of my dick brothers that I'm not dead, I'll smite you. Say hello to the gigantor from me!" And, with a last wriggle of his eyebrows, he was gone. Dean was still dumb-struck as Cas walked up behind him and placed a hand on his shoulder soothingly.
“I’m so sorry Dean. I’m sorry I – “, but he was cut off again when Dean leaned down and kissed him passionately.
"Dean!" he exclaimed just as unbelievingly, practically flinging himself into his arms. They swayed on the spot with the force of their embrace, both of them not entirely sure that this wasn't just a dream. They had their faces buried in each other's neck, breathing them in.
Cas crossed the space between them in three big steps and yanked Dean up by his collar. The green-eyed boy expected him to yell, to tell him he didn't want to be his friend anymore, but instead Cas pulled him in and pressed their lips together desperately.
He walked around the corner and saw Cas standing in the middle of the hallway with a look of pure shock on his face. Now Dean really was worried. Who the fuck was on the other end of that goddamn line?? His husband immediately noticed him standing there and as their gazes locked, Dean silently mouthed
“No”, Dean called back and he could practically sense his brother’s bitch face through the wood of the door.
gorgeous. But he was also
Just then, someone knocked on their door. Dean groaned in displeasure as Cas rolled off of him to lie beside him again.
"What do you mean, 'no'?"
Dumbfounded, Sam crawled under the covers of his own bed and switched off the light without another word. The last thing he saw before everything went dark was Dean's smug face.
When Dean pulled back for breath with a last gentle bite to Cas' bottom lip, their mouths still nearly touching, Cas quickly made a decision.
Sorry it's so short, but I didn't know where else to make a cut...
"What, in my Father's name, are you doing, Dean?" he asked when he noticed him back in the room, his voice strained with the agonizing wait, eyes still closed like Dean had told him. Dean chuckled nervously.
"Yes, they always get up so early. I don't get it, it's the weekend, I'd normally sleep in until ten at least, but right now that's rather practical for us, so I'm not complaining", Dean answered while pressing the doorbell. He beamed at Cas as they waited for someone to let them in, and he smiled back just as brightly, even if there was still a little bit of uncertainty detecable in those blue eyes.
"Nearly seven, I think."
"No, no, I'll tell you. It means...I uh--I love you", he says softly, still not meeting Dean's gaze. His face feels like it's on fire. He closes his eyes and dreadingly awaits Dean's reaction. It is not what he expected.
Also, I'm open for suggestions for the third and last chapter, Eternity. Should I write about their wedding, their married life, should it take place directly after the second chapter...? I'm a little indecisive so if you have any requests/ideas, whatever, feel free to write it in the comments!
"You wish."
Silence. Then,
Dean's nerves got worse and worse the closer it got to 6 p.m. on Saturday, the time John was supposed to arrive at their house. Dean had been stress cleaning all day, to the point that Cas got actually worried he'd scrub a hole right through their living room floor and told him, gentle but firm, to cut it out and busy himself with something else. After that, Dean tried to get Cas to have sex with him again so he could just not think about anything for a while, but his husband did not let himself be talked into abandoning their dinner. So Dean took to pacing the hallway at the front door, nearly forgetting that he was still wearing the ratty clothes he'd put on for cleaning the house until Cas reminded him that he still had to get dressed for dinner.
It had definitely been worth Sam’s bitching about the noise the next morning.
"So uh- this is gonna be pretty crazy, Sammy. Are you alone right now? Got some time?"
He was, however, wide awake again as Dean decided to up the game and trailed an ice cube down between his cheeks and across his hole, which fluttered at the icy touch. Cas let out a low moan, starting to thrust against the mattress lightly. Dean took his reaction as encouragement and circled the cube around his rim until it was completely gone before he leaned down and started lapping at Cas' entrance. He used both hands to spread his cheeks apart as he traced it with the tip of his tongue, similar to what he did with the cube just a minute ago.
Charlie quiets just for a moment. “You’re just—you’re so dense sometimes, Dean. You’re going to end up hurting him and yourself, you know that?”
“Are we still on for movies at my place this Friday?”
“I panicked.”
Cas huffs, indignant. It’s cute. “I was trying to be a helpful friend.”
“You—what?” Dean laughs, mind being lifted further from his dark thoughts.
“Hey,” rasps a drowsy voice. They have switched positions. Dean somehow is now rested on Castiel’s chest and Castiel’s head rests atop’s Dean.
Cas looks caught in headlights. “I thought everyone left for a hunt,” he replies, words a little stunted. “I was invited, but I…declined.” Dean knows what that means. Cas thought he’d have to be in the same car as Dean, around Dean, so he chose to stay behind. Unfortunately for them, Dean is still here.
“You’re one of the smartest guys I know,” Benny interjects with a softened but still firm approach. “You worked your ass off at Bobby’s garage to pay for Sam’s college, you worked your ass off even harder to invest in his business, and now you’re a freelance mechanic eating dividends off of a very successful venture. You believe in all the right people. You just...have to start believing in yourself too. Tell him, Dean. Please, for the love of god, tell him so we can all move on with our lives.”
That kiss. The one they shared, somehow, in its delicacy and quiet and chasteness was far more intimate than a drunken mostly-blacked-out smooch for laughs.
The night ends with Eileen entering to let them know she’s found a standard salt-and-burn case, twenty miles south. It’s a nice night for a drive. Is Dean ready to hunt again?
Dean’s heart kicks into gear and runs at the speed it would if he were to be perched over a cliff edge. He opens his mouth in a panic to amend it with no luck in more useful words tumbling out.
“How is that even remotely—”
“Dean and I are dating,” Cas blurts out.
‘To Somehow.’
“Hey,” Dean says weakly. “You wanna watch some TV?”
“We’ve been through enough shit, be a little optimistic, will you?” Dean says, poking Cas in the arm with the edge of his elbow. “They’ll have some kind of paint.”
Kinda
The friction in the air is suddenly thick, the space between them immensely frigid.
“Hey!” Dean cries and catapults a nearby slipper at Cas’ head. It misses by an inch, but only because Cas tilts his head to avoid it. “Stop looking at me like that! I’m not some piece of meat, you asshole.”
“Did you just sniff me?”
She’s smirking like she finds the whole thing pretty amusing and that makes Dean narrow his eyes at her.
Sam stares blankly while Cas inches his head ever so slightly to glare at Dean.
Dean’s lips twitches at that. He has to clamp down his teeth to curb the amused grin. “No, man, I mean,” he finally looks at him, trying, and probably failing, to ensure his eyes aren’t so very pleading, “Are you back? You staying tonight? There’s—um—we’ve got a room for you if you want some—shut-eye. Or something.”
“Thank god you’re alone.” Dean throws his head back, sighs indulgently to himself.
“Why are
“I’ve just kissed you twice—“
“Cas and I have been sleeping in the same bed on and off since we were fifteen. What’s your point?”
filled with so much foolish loyalty to you that I just go along with everything,” Cas rants five minutes into the drive. “Dean, I do everything that you ask. I always come when you call. How do you get me to say yes to every stupid plan? Tell me, I am genuinely curious.”
He watches Cas clear the table and load the dishwasher with newfound scrutiny. “I’ll pick up some groceries tonight and make you pasta. Do you want me to make your chicken alfredo?”
Cas frowns. “What?”
“You!” Dean points at April, his finger quivering in the air. “You and Cas? Over!
. Even his inner musings are embellishing every bit of Cas that it can.
Benny boggles at Dean, caught between stunned and furious. Eventually, he yells, “Are you out of your goddamn mind?”
“Meg, be serious, please.”
With Sam bungling out the bar on unsteady feet, at the aid of Dean and Cas, they manage to get him lying back scrunched on the back of Dean’s impala in under ten minutes. There were a few falls. He drools on Eileen’s lap and is already snoring away when Cas slides into shotgun.
,” Dean snarls viciously. “Not anymore, alright? I don’t care what people think about us. They can call us boyfriends, they can tease us, they can mock us, I don’t care! I don’t need to be told I can’t spend all my time with you or hug you or kiss your cheek because it’s not what boys do. I’ll do everything else the normal way boys do, but not that! It’s one of the
Cas smiles. “Yes. Food. Let’s go get some. We should visit a grocery store. There is one I frequented around here awhile back where the boy is so frightened of me, he offers me a free pie every time I visit.”
He savours the feel before retreating back.
It’s been a long hiatus, but not as long as hiatus #1 ✌️
Thankfully, his favourite voice is on the other line. “Hello, Dean.”
“I know you almost as well as you know yourself, Dean.” Perhaps that was a little too eager. He reels back. “Of course, it isn’t difficult for any creature within close distance to recognise your…prickliness as you wake.”
They both clear their throats uncomfortably.
“Stop talking.” Cas had yanked the whiskey bottle out of Dean’s grip then.
“Dean!
Dean is struck silent to Cas’ chagrin. He itches to be inside Dean’s head to hear his thoughts.
“Don’t kiss me this time,” Cas says with a smirk.
Dean starts checking off fingers. “Hemingway, Van Gogh, Sartre—”
Jack is inching back and forth on the swings, listless.
“Um...” Cas responds as Dean’s face drains of blood. “Love you too. Bye.”
“I’m going out.”
Smoothing quickly back from her jauntiness to a small forlorn look to Dean, she signs at him that she’s sorry. Another woman to apologise to him today for shitshows that are staged because of him. Fabulous.
Cas has edged himself back over and onto the bed. Dean shivers when he accidentally peeks at Cas’ bare chest and legs and reddened lips.
“That’s true,” chimes in Benny. “You’ve been calling him angel and sunshine since we were kids.”
“Sorry about what?” Dean snipes, already hooking his arm with Cas’ and ushering them off the couch and towards the direction of their room. “We’re gonna grab our coats and we’re gonna go for a drive to get some paint. Exciting adventures. Better than hunting monsters! Hunting for paint on Christmas Eve, awesome,” he cries with theatrical joy.
He looks to Cas for assistance but Cas feigns obliviousness so dedicatedly that it’s borderline theatrical.
He considers just sleeping here, no sense risking an awkward bump-in with Cas as he navigates the hallway towards his room. The issue is moot when after a few more minutes of drinking and pondering, Cas enters the room.
“Dean, it seems you are fully stocked up on alcoholic beverages and condiments, but no…actual…ingredients or food.”
“That’s—that was what it was...right? You didn’t mean—I mean it didn’t sound like—were you just saying goodbye and it wasn’t...that kind of love? More like a profound bond brotherly kind of...thing?” He stammers, sweat beading faster than when Death was literally at their doorstep.
“What is this? What’s happening?” Dean demands.
“I believe it would be a good idea for us to take things slow. Particularly when these are such…unfamiliar waters for you,” he says gently. “I don’t want to shock you into…recoiling from me. From us.”
“Why did we buy the chalk?” Cas grumbles, “we should have gotten slushies instead. They we”
“We’ll say it’s a prank,” Cas offers with an optimism Dean is seething at right now.
Dean swallows thickly. “You’re not?”
“Castiel, I assume you just went along with whatever Dean was doing again and that’s why you’re slowly sliding down the booth like a wet fish.”
Dean nods quickly, jerking his chin up and down with vigour. “Yeah. Wanna talk. Always wanna talk with you, Cas. Sleep, then talk.”
!”, the word laden with spite.
like.”
“Didn’t realise that was a loaded question,” Sam says, huffing an awkward and stilted laugh. “I’m going on a supply run to get Eileen some clothes, food, and um—lady things. She’s still resting a lot too. Falling angels and people back from the dead, am I right?” He’s blabbering now, rubbing his neck. “Must just be another Thursday, I guess.”
“Have you told any more people yet? Are we still going through with this?”
Benny turns to stare at Dean blankly. “What do you mean?”
“Dean is here,” he hears himself mutter stupidly, then shakes his head, because Dean couldn’t be here. Why is Dean here?
Luckily, Dean takes the next step for him.
Cas pulls away first, rests his forehead against Dean as Dean mutters, “for fuck’s sake.”
Now, when they do this, only very occasionally, perhaps once or twice a year, it’s Cas and his much better physique that often overpowers Dean. He blames the taken-for-granted years of burgers and pies and milkshakes for letting him down next to Cas’ steady, sensible, boring diet.
“Oh, good. Now you know what it’s like to talk to you.”
“Hey,” he murmurs as they turn a corner. Still no lit-up stores. They’re very unlikely, Dean knows, to find an open establishment at this day and time. Jesus.
“Th-that’s far enough. Um...” Dean laughs a little nervously, licks his lips, and directs his attention away from Cas to opening his car door which he struggles with for a moment. Cas boggles at the scene.
Throughout the next couple of days, Cas wishes quietly to himself that Dean wouldn’t turn up at his place Friday night, brooding and adamant. He obviously does anyway.
remember finding Dean sitting on the floor, staring blankly ahead, their bookcase lying beside him along with an assortment of books, baubles, and broken glass.
His senses, no matter how dulled, still attunes to others’ inspections of him from time to time.
“Oh, shit.” Dean gulps. “Right. Dinner. Shit. I didn’t get the friggin’ mushrooms.”
“Why would anyone need three fleeces?”
“Well, um, I don’t know how else we’d get Meg off your sexy ass, sunshine, except we just kick her out the group…” Dean is momentarily excited at the prospect before huffing defeatedly, “but she gets on with Rowena like a hell-house on fire, and has this weird romance to enemies to friendship history with Sam, and I’m pretty sure she and Benny and Charlie bonded pretty hard during their Satanic Shadow Vampire-Orc LARPing at college—which—weird, but back to my thing—so Sam won’t let me just fire Lisa either because—”
“Do you want me to make you a pot? We have a teapot somewhere, but I’m sure we can make it into a cocoapot, heh.”
“Yeah.” Dean chews on the inside of his cheeks. “Like...
He knows something happened with Hannah and Cas. Was it because of Hannah the angel? Or was Cas attracted to pretty brunettes with blue eyes, ones that he could hold hands with in public and have them not balk at the idea of cuddling?
“Um,” the boy mumbles after jolting at Castiel’s strange compliment. “Thanks. I guess. I like your...eyes. No homo, they just look cool. You’re like a human husky.”
“Yeah. You really are a pretty good pretender, aren’t you? Have you always been this good and I’ve just…not noticed?” Dean asks flatly.
that he can’t quite name.
“Yes, you, dumbass,” retorts Dean, resolutely ignoring poor flabbergasted Lisa. He once again has to haul ass with one hand urging Cas along with him by the shoulder, as far out of earshot as he can reach without leaving her by herself entirely.
Finally, his boyfriend got the message and stopped his assault on Dean’s already over-sensitive nipples to come back up for another kiss. Dean was just letting himself get lost in the perfect slide of lips when suddenly, Cas grasped his thighs and hoisted him up. Dean moaned, unfairly aroused at the show of strength, and his arms and legs automatically wrapped around Cas’ neck and waist while he was being carried to the bedroom.
my husband, I will not hesitate to kick you to the curb again, permanently. Understood?" he relented while still making clear who called the shots here.
"Oh, uh, yeah. I wanted to say, I know I can't to anything about- about Mom but I'd love if my kids at least got to know their grandfather, y'know?"
And maybe, he thought with a smile, maybe it really wasn’t too soon after all.
"Yeah, I feel ya. I asked around, too, and I just felt so goddamn stupid when I realized that we actually are the only ones who were still in the dark about this", Jo agreed. "But now that I know I paid more attention to it and I gotta say that these two do make an awesome couple. And so
After they’d left the diner, the three of them went to a bar for a drink. They hadn’t been out together very much lately, mostly Dean took Cas out alone and Sam stayed at the bunker with Kevin. The prophet hadn’t joined them today as well, saying he’d like an evening just by himself.
The green eyed hunter sat down on a chair next to the bed, his eyes fixated onto his friend. He sighed again. He wanted desperately to do something to help the angel but as long as he didn’t know what exactly was wrong with him, he couldn’t do anything but sit here and watch over him. It hurt him to see his best friend like that and he would do anything to help him.
“C’mere”, he said, lifting one edge of the blanket for Cas to slip underneath it. He pulled the angel against his chest, spooning up behind him and wrapping his arms tightly around Cas’ waist and chest.
"Ich liebe dich."
“You know exactly what I mean, Dean. I couldn’t sleep at all last night, because of those awfully loud
engrossed in their kissing. Sam tried to ignore it as good as possible and rather concentrated on the hunt. Suddenly, a loud voice spoke up and he tensed.
“You could really do that? That would be so awesome, Babe!”
Cas groaned as he opened the door to his and Dean's house, immediately kicking off his uncomfortable dress shoes and shrugging out of the too-hot suit jacket. It fell to the hallway floor in a crumpled heap, but he paid it no mind. He tossed his briefcase next to his shoes and made his way up to their bedroom, where he rid himself of the rest of his clothes and promptly collapsed onto the bed face-first.
Dean, who had been lying on his bed, waiting for Sam to finish packing his things, jumped up and hurried over to the blue eyed angel.
." And that? That right there? That was definitely new. John Winchester asking,
Cas whimpered as his husband drew back, sitting up on his haunches. He grabbed Cas' hips and the dark haired man let himself be manhandled so that his ass was in the air while his chest was still pressed into the mattress beneath him.
“Well, yes, so I guess what Sam’s talking about is…my current relationship wi-“ Dean started, but he didn’t get to finish his sentence because Charlie cut him off quickly.
Ugh, he really needed to get up and into that shower right now.
"I thought I heard something in the main room", he whispered and Dean immediately stood more upright and alert, trying his best to shake the tiredness off and be prepared to fight as he followed Cas into the main room.
"You ready for a little roadtrip, Dean? Seems like we've got a vengeful spirit two towns over. Here, have a look at this", he said and turned the laptop so Dean could read the article he'd opened up.
"I...told them that I'm pregnant", he said, slight hesitation noticeable in his gravely voice. Dean raised his head and raised one eyebrow at his husband.
“You’re kidding me.”
Because it just
"Of course not, Dean, I believe I wouldn't enjoy having to retrieve you from the death again, especially on our wedding day", Cas replied matter-of-factly. Dean rolled his eyes fondly.
had to get up and answer it.
“Yeah, yeah, I’m sorry I didn’t tell you”, Dean said quickly, hands raised in surrender. Charlie raised an eyebrow at him.
Dean laid back against the wall of the bathtub again, and Cas placed his hands on the hunter's chest for support. Then he started to pick up his pace, eventually slamming down onto the thick cock inside of him as quickly as he could manage, water splashing around wildly. They were both talking incoherently by now, pleasure building rapidly. Cas leaned down and they kissed again, a little messily and uncoordinated, their tongues entwining.
him-- he even dropped the phone on the ground. Thankfully, it did survive the fall.
"Kiddo, even I can't just resurrect people left and right. Believe me, there would be quite a few awesome people that wouldn't have left us so early if I could. And I was pretty sure that you would've chosen her, had I given you the choice between her and your daddy."
“That was…unexpected”, Dean panted eventually. Cas just grinned down at him and circled his hips, his hands on Dean’s chest for support. The angel lifted himself up and sank back down; slowly at first but steadily gaining speed. Dean soon started to buck his hips up to meet Cas’ thrusts, but it just wasn’t enough for him at the moment.
I wish you all a merry (late) christmas and hope you'll have an awesome new year *hugs y'all*
But suddenly Cas, who had sensed Sam coming out of the building, teleported himself back into the backseat, leaving Dean gasping for air and with an almost painful hard-on in his jeans. And they still had a whole hour ahead of them.
or something?"
Several minutes later, he was just stirring the sauce for the pasta as he felt strong arms slide around his waist from behind and a kiss being pressed to the back of his neck. He sighed contentedly, leaning back into Dean's warmth.
"How about I make you work for it, huh?" Dean asked back, lazily dragging a single finger along the rim of the dark haired man's slightly gaping hole. "C'mon, Baby, want you to ride me."
The drying come between their chests became uncomfortable at some point, and Cas worked his mojo to clean them up. Dean grinned and started kissing down Cas’ jaw and neck, occasionally sucking a small bruise to the pale skin.
Once he was fully sheated inside Cas' tight heat, he paused and looked down at him, waiting for him to relax and adjust to the feeling. Cas wrapped his arms around Dean's neck and pulled him into a soft kiss.
Or the two of them would be on the couch watching movies, cuddling, with Cas lying in between Dean’s outstretched legs, head resting on his boyfriend’s chest – listening to his steady heartbeat. From time to time, the angel would lean up for a sweet kiss, before settling back down lazily, and Dean would continue running his fingers through his messy bed hair comfortingly. Sam would watch their loving gestures from his place on an armchair – since he’d been practically thrown off the sofa – and he would smile to himself, marveling about how happy he was for Dean and his angel.
Dean guffaws, earning another fondly disapproving look from Cas. “Buddy, you look very much like a hot guy to me so I’m pretty sure it’s a bit gay.”
. What the fuck are you doing in the toilet with her?”
“isn’t that funny?”
jab back because, first and foremost, this is his best friend.
—but in a disabled toilet? A little kinky and fucked up, not gonna lie. I like it.”
“Dean Winchester can talk me into everything, but can’t string together one damn sentence when he’s confronted with feelings,” Cas interrupts, feeling entirely nasty the second he ends his words.
Dean slides in next to him and places a hand on his shoulder, righting Castiel against his side. He’s far too close. He’s so close now, pressed up next to Castiel, that he wants to cry in relief.
Dean’s hand drifts, cradles Cas by his jaw, pulls him forward for their lips to brush.
“Lunch,” Dean says, “Brunch, or whatever. We’ll have cheese and crackers as a morning snack.”
“I called you two mean. I didn’t—I didn’t realise it would ever be a thing. I thought that’s what you two were just like. I—I’m so sorry, Dean. I never even tried to talk to you or—or support you. I mean a couple of years ago I thought maybe—you two look at each other like you’ve both hung the moon. I should’ve gone with my gut and just talked to you about it earlier. I’m sorry.” His head crumples forward onto his knees.
Dean ends up with maybe three to four hours of shut-eye after his senses go on high alert, and he overthinks everything.
Cas starts unwinding her arms from around him and steps closer to his friend who immediately grasps onto his hand. Dean uses this grip as leverage to yank Cas behind him as if he’s acting as a shield between Cas and a ravenous lion.
It’s about Week Two into their mutual evasion of each other when Sam, recently oblivious to any person but Eileen, notices.
He sinks to the floor, head in hands, ignoring the barflies barrelling in and out the nearby toilets just as they ignore him.
April catches up to them in the living room and calls Cas’ name. He pauses momentarily to seize her eyes with his despite Dean’s physical barrier between them. He feels like he’s about to burst into tears, because he
Castiel turns back and nods, perhaps a bit too eagerly. “Thank you, Dean.”
Cas comes to stand before him in what seems like a rapid flash. Maybe he’s blacking out sporadically again.
“Wouldn’t the better question be what isn’t?” He laughs humourlessly. “Are we talking again now?” The beer makes him a little braver. Enough to at least confront it. “Or are we doing a thing where we go between realising there’s a mountain of shit between us and ignoring it. As if we’re friends again.”
“I am
Dean pointedly shuffles past Cas to set the table.
