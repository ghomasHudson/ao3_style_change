That had Steve smile, even as he heard Tony scoffing. “That’s no reason for you to manhandling my boyfriend. Could you stop that? I’d like to introduce him to Rhodey.”
Tony snorted, glancing up at Clint who only poked his tongue out at him. “Alright. How about we fix it together?”
In that moment, Steve thanked Wanda and her quick thinking, thanked her for his life, but on the next beat, he watched the bulb veering off course and into the building next to them. The shock wave was massive and merciless, destroying many floors, making the windows break and shatter as a fiery death took hold of their surroundings.
He found Steve lying on a big bed in the next room and he looked even more broken than Tony had expected. Not so much physically, but… he lay curled into himself, looking so small, one hand resting on his bare stomach. A rumpled sheet was tangled around his naked legs, covering him from the waist down. Tony stood transfixed, taking in the inherent beauty of the man before him. Slowly, he shrugged out of his jacket and hung it over a chair.
He knew that it wasn’t a fantasy, of course. Enough time had passed that he could trust this life was real. Yet, it didn’t quite seem like reality. Because apart from those last few months, things had been too pleasant, altogether too comfortable, and he knew that he didn’t deserve it.
“You guys don’t actually plan to drive back tonight, do you?” Tony asked. “We have… I’m staying over at one of SI’s guest suites, the mansion needs some renovations before I move back in. Stay the night, drive back tomorrow?” He glanced at Barnes in question. “Besides, I still need to take your measurements. No data, no new arm.”
Not waiting for an answer, Tony pushed himself off the bed and attempted to run across the room, only just realizing that his pants were still pooled around his ankles.
When Bucky rushed at him, swinging a blade out of his sleeve, Tony barely blinked. He ducked, rolled, and ducked again. He knocked Bucky to the floor with a quick sweep of his legs, and sent him staggering into the next wall when he tried to get up.
“I—” Steve started, then averted his eyes. It was small, nearly indiscernible, but it was there. A flicker of worry and a waver in his confident stance. He couldn’t remember ever having seen Steve like this. Like he was doubting the very foundation of his being.
“It’s strange that Stark didn’t want to be here, after all of his fussing when they found you,” Natasha mused, and smiled when she noticed Steve staring at her in question.
“Yes, and I have to deal with it, too, don’t I?” Tony said, and only when Natasha cast him an unimpressed glance, he groaned and nodded. “Fine, I’ll talk to him.”
Then again… maybe he was afraid of him. It would be the reasonable thing to feel. He knew Tony could hold himself up in a fight, but when it came down to it, they both knew Bucky could kill him in a heartbeat as long as he wasn’t in the armor.
From where Steve stood, Tony didn’t seem to do much of anything, only staring at the large blueprint he’d taped to one of the walls.
“Jarvis…” Tony warned, though it sounded too affectionate to have any real bite. And Steve had a feeling Jarvis was much more than a butler to Tony. He also knew in that moment that he and Jarvis would get along just fine.
“Do you have to tell Mister Stark today?” Jarvis asked. “It’s going to bring it all back again, and worse than before.”
“But I don’t wanna dream of someone else,” Tony replied with an easy shrug. “I like to have you here, with me.”
“No,” Rhodes assured him. “For like, two seconds, I tried to remember if you’ve ever checked me out and I think you didn’t, which—by the way—only shows how bad your taste is, but no, it’s not weird now.”
Steve glanced up when he caught movement out the corner of his eye. He instinctively covered the note and pulled it towards himself, not wanting anyone to see what he was writing, but when he saw Tony's face all other thoughts flew out of his head. What the hell happened?
“Dude, I could work alongside the Avengers,” Sam ventured and Tony saw the corner of his mouth lift in a half-grin. “There’s no better reason to get back in.”
. He just… he couldn’t stop thinking about Tony. After what he’d said… Steve wanted to know more, figure out how exactly the two of them had managed to get along as much as they did. It wasn’t about falling in love, either—it was about getting over what had happened, about finding out what it was that had Tony start trusting him again.
“Jealous,” Tony echoed, huffing at him. “As if. Even if I’d ignore the fact that Barnes is as straight as they come, or that Natasha pretty much put a property stamp on his ass, you’re all mine.”
Most just wanted to talk to Tony about his project, pointedly ignoring Steve. Some, however, only wanted to talk about Stark Industries’ weapon’s production—and Steve noticed that each time this happened, Tony’s hands tightened to fists at his side.
“No,” Thor replied, and while he seemed to be tempted to glance back to the television every once in a while, his expression had turned serious. “I might have seen it during my quests in the Nine Realms. But there were no traces of the Bifrost opening a portal, or a rift of a different kind, so I am uncertain why it appeared in your city.”
Soon enough, they were all in varying stages of sugar comas, lying on their pillows around the smoldering bonfire. The stars formed a blur of light as Tony squinted his eyes the way he used to on Jarvis’ lap in front of the Christmas tree. Steve was lying on a blanket between him and Natasha. Sometimes after things fell a little more quiet around them, he leaned over and kissed Tony on the tip of his nose.
He was in love with her. He had only gotten glimpses of it in all the lifetimes before when love had seemed impossible, but he knew so now. It was warmth that came without fear or doubt. Nat was curled around him, naked and soft. He had thought he was too jaded to feel like this anymore, but he had been wrong. Nat had given color to a heart worn with blacks and grays. And yes, he loved her. Somehow, even while forgetting her, she had always had his love.
Steve smiled to himself, not knowing what to say. And he was glad when Tony led him to the other staff members.
Steve sighed. “I’m not ‘claiming’ anything. And… no matter how much you trust me—Let me help. It’ll be safer for you if you take me with you.”
It reminded him of that bath in his vision, and it made him wonder if he and Tony could ever be like that. If they could spend quiet, comfortable time with one another while talking about everyday stuff.
He knew there was no other choice, though. Tony would need to visit the internet hub, find out who their anonymous ally was, and Steve had to stop Ultron from building himself a body with the vibranium he’d stolen from Wakanda. They’d just have to trust that they’d both come out on the other side unhurt.
Steve released a long breath. He’d known the moment Clint had walked in on them that he’d be hearing about this for weeks to come—
“Uh,” Tony exhaled, a half-confused, half-aroused sound, even as he arched into him, his arms wrapping around Steve’s neck. “I
Steve frowned. Well, that hurt. He’d thought… he’d thought they could start into this new life together. “So you don’t want to have your high school sweetheart around, is that it?”
He replaced the pot onto stove before he caused a catastrophe. His hands clutched at the counter while the pills fell to his feet as the room started spinning all over again.
Stepping out of the bathroom, Tony found Steve already lying in bed, and glanced down at the STARK logo on his pajama top.
“Yes,” Natasha said with a sympathetic smile. Steve didn’t know her all that long, but he’d gathered that she was very empathetic. And he had a feeling she could read him like a book. “I can almost guarantee he can do it. I could ask him to come over sometime, then you can tell him everything you know.”
The words, once they left Steve’s lips, made Tony freeze. And Steve’s heart sank as he watched Tony’s handsome face drain of all color. He suddenly looked like he had at the day on the cliff in Monte Carlo. Staring into the ocean beneath his feet, his own demons urging him to end his life then and there.
“And you called yourself reckless and impulsive. How is this any different from what happened on the bridge? When I said to keep trying I meant to come up with a plan, to actually think it through, have a strategy at hand, and not to dive into the next catastrophe head first.” He sighed. “When have we switched places? When did I become the reasonable part in this relationship?”
Steve blinked. It was weird to hear Bucky defending Tony, but he was glad he did. And he was right, too. They couldn’t know what was happening in New York right now.
“Because when our goal is to leave the Earth better than we found it, sometimes we need to take a step into the unknown.” At that, Tony smiled, and reached for the glass of champagne that stood on the speaker’s desk, raising it to the audience. “To Stark Industries’ Clean Energy Line. To a great Stark Expo. And to an even better evening for us all. Thank you."
Tony stilled, eyeing his hand. After a beat of contemplation, he turned sideways, giving Steve access.
“What are you doing?” Tony asked with a subdued voice, though there really was no mistaking Steve’s intent, and Tony’s body reacted appropriately.
Steve’s hands kept a tight hold on him. They gauged each other, silence settling in for a moment, before they both looked down at the card again.
Secretly, Steve had to agree with Natasha. After all, he had seen how good it could be between them. To throw all that away, all that love and caring and passion and tenderness, which was what he had always wanted but never received. To turn his back on that…
Extremis was broken—there was no way to ignore it any longer. And yet, he couldn’t tell if it was permanently broken, or just temporarily deactivated.
Entering the workshop, Steve spotted Tony at his workstation, as was the norm for the guy. It was a relief to see him unchanged, and definitely not wearing any ancient Roman clothes. That would've driven Steve to complete insanity.
built the world’s first sophisticated AI, I think I’m pretty much required to use that line as often as I possibly can.”
When Steve was all the way in, Tony pressed his head into the pillow beneath him. “I love you,” he whispered, briefly thinking how amazing it was that he could still think these words—much less voice them.
“No, it didn’t,” he told Rhodey, his voice rough, and then… then he couldn’t keep himself from crumbling. He had kept it together until now, but this weight on his heart, it was slowly suffocating him.
With a small sigh, he activated the holographs and opened up the latest news, flipping through the pages until he found the section on the Avengers. There was a lot there, a lot of hatred and not nearly enough support. It was a sick kind of self-torture he did there, he knew it, but the shit-storm about the Avengers wasn’t what interested him. It was that first page, that newspaper article he’d glimpsed at earlier this day. There was a picture of him and Steve. It was small and blurred, since they had never officially sold any wedding pictures; but it was undeniably them, exchanging their vows.
But instead of teasing him about it some more, Steve only kept grinning and took Tony’s hand in his own. “Come here. Let’s see the damage.”
Tony still hadn’t gotten used to this, to Steve looking at him like this and kissing him whenever he felt like it, and it made his heart race in a way that was both frightening and exhilarating. “You won’t regret this later and hate me forever, will you?”
“He’s a travesty,” Tony murmured. He met Steve’s eyes again. “I can show him to you if you want,” he explained gently. “But he’s a strange fellow. For one, don’t ever drink what he wants to offer you. No matter how good it looks. Alright?”
“There’s…” Steve trailed off and shook his head. “You keep knowing all kinds of things before they happen, you have vital information on missions, you knew about Clint’s family, when we watch the news you don’t seem to be surprised much. Last month, you bought me a set of drawing pencils because you somehow knew I was running out on them. We’ve never even talked about my sketches before, and you bought my favorite. So what I want to say is… I should be more wary, but then again, you’ve only ever protected us, helped us, so I’m having trouble believing you’re hostile.”
He turned to Bucky, but it was clear that he was as much in the dark as Steve was. Reaching into his shield and gripping the leather straps, Steve placed it on the holder on his back. “We should head outside. Nat and Clint are sweeping the city, we need to be ready.”
you’re back to idolizing him. You always do that. I’m just saying… whenever he calls for you, you jump, no matter what you’re doing right then, no questions asked, right? Just worrying that you give it your all and he doesn’t.”
In any case, it wasn’t hard to notice how cold the reception of their guests was. No one smiled—even Rhodey, who was usually quick to show his respect to anyone of rank, was giving Ross wary glances.
“I know it can be a little overwhelming. But Jarvis will give you the tour once we arrive,” Tony said. “You’ll feel at home in no time.”
When he stepped out of the toilets again, Steve was leaning next to the doors. At one point, he’d obviously tucked himself back in, and cast Tony a lazy smile, when he stepped in front of him.
“We won’t hurt anyone,” Steve reasoned, mostly with himself. “We’ll have to try to get into the jet before they can stop us, that’s all that matters at that point.” Steve let his voice trail off, unwilling to put his personal fears into words, namely what would happen once they had to face off the others. If Tony really had gotten orders to imprison them, have them arrested or worse, Steve didn’t know what he would do. He obviously couldn’t
“I’m fine,” Steve told Tony, but he didn’t get any reaction. Tony just walked on, not saying anything, and Steve was glad for it. The silence was something he needed. Ever since the explosion, the world has been bright and harsh and deafening, a fact not aided by the pictures still present in his mind. As soon as they stepped into their room, Tony let go of Steve. He walked into the baby room and cautiously put Ian’s sleeping form into his crib.
Steve knew how worried Tony was about the news on Sokovia. After returning home, he’d started scrolling through the latest news as soon as he got his hands on a phone. The fallout was horrifying, and at the same time, it was hard for Steve not to revel in the sense of homecoming. It might not last, but for the moment, things were calm, and they were together. It was all that mattered.
"I'm just telling you how it is. Take it or leave it. Tony’s life isn’t easy, and he’s not an easy kid to deal with." He stood up. "I’m sorry… thanks for the coffee. I gotta head back—time sensitive experiment," he said and sent a small smile at Steve before hurrying out of the cafe.
He liked to think not, but that rage… it had been everywhere inside of him. Knowing that Barnes had strangled his mother—his
"I guess not," Steve said, smiling at him. "They took it well enough, though," Steve said then, taking a small step back and looking around at his room. It never felt as right as his place in D.C. did, but it was a place to put down his head after a long day. "Not sure what they'll have to say in the morning, but there's time to worry about that, later." He wrapped his arms around Tony in a nearly automatic gesture, pressing into the kiss before turning to nuzzle his cheek.
“Phil already knows,” Natasha said, staring quietly at her phone now. “He isn’t answering on the emergency line. I bet he has his hands full.” She huffed, leaning back and staring at the ceiling. “And you told me I was going straight,” she murmured, glancing over at Clint. “I just traded in the KGB for HYDRA. It’d be funny if it weren’t so tragic. I… I really thought I knew whose lies I was telling but…”
Steve took a theatrically deep breath and gazed at Tony with a faux-worried expression. “You know… that bug up your ass must be suffocating. Why don’t you kill it and put it out of its misery?”
Steve sighed and walked across the ground. The chaos was everywhere, hundreds and hundreds of ambulances, fire trucks, SHIELD jets, and police cars. The press was held back at the outskirts for now, and Steve hoped they could leave before that changed. They would come back, for sure, as soon as their injured had been taken care of. They’d come back, help to clear up the area and search for victims buried under the rubble.
Her memory was the only thing that kept him awake. All he had to do was close his eyes and he wasn’t alone.
“I know you,” Steve said quietly, nearing Tony slowly… carefully. “And I never thought you were this sort of guy.”
He knew, somehow, that that would be better. He didn't know how, but he needed it. Despite the remaining discomfort, Steve wanted to feel more. He closed his eyes again, concentrating, his hands grabbing onto the bedcovers for dear life, and then he opened his eyes again to look at Tony with as much conviction as he could summon.
Steve grinned. “Just checking.” When the truck was just a few meters away, he took a running start. He barely managed to land right on top of it, rolling across the surface and coming to rest just above the cockpit.
birthdays, especially his own, the least he could do was to make sure the evening turned out exactly as Steve had planned it. So he closed his eyes and made a wish, however stupid the whole concept was.
Steve forced a smile to his lips, even while his thoughts darkened. He glanced at Wanda, and she looked right back at him. The discontented look in her eyes didn’t sit well with him at all.
When Tony stumbled out of his suit, though, Steve had moved before he knew it, kneeling before him and resting both hands on his shoulders, leaning down close so Tony'd have no choice but to look at him.
, Tony thought, but instead of raising his hand, he used it to stifle a yawn. Next to him, Bruce retreated into his hoodie, pulling up his headphones underneath it. The beat leaked out, tinnily. Seemed he was bored, too, which didn’t exactly come as a surprise, since Bruce probably had the same genius IQ as Tony.
Bucky was sitting on the floor in the far end of the room, a good dozen meters away. His face was buried in both of his hands, his knees drawn tight to his chest. His whole body was shaking heavily. Rhodes and Bruce were nowhere to be seen, which wasn’t unusual—Natasha, on the other hand, sat on the couch with a crying Ian in her lap, holding a plastic bag filled with ice against her cheek while she tried to soothe the baby.
“Тыпаниковал,” Natasha said and flashed an alluring smile, before she leaned in and pressed a small peck on his cheek.
No more work today, Ian had settled down, FRIDAY monitored everything. He finally had a few hours for himself.
"Good," he said next to Tony's ear. When he pulled back, he took a full step away to survey Tony's form. Even in his biased opinion, Tony looked well and truly fucked in the best sense of the word. An apology was forming on his lips even before he knew what he was going to say, but he never got the chance to speak, as he heard footsteps at the training area's door seconds before it swung open. Steve already knew who that would be by the sound of his footsteps but he still winced when Sam came into view and surveyed the room.
Tony smiled as though Steve’s question was a great source of amusement. “These people work for me,” he explained. “They have worked for me for decades, and even longer when my parents were still alive. They know I don’t have a preference when it comes to my partners. Most don’t acknowledge it, some might not approve, a few might even think of it as a perversion, but they won’t tell on us, if that’s what you’re wondering. And they won’t show their opinion to you.”
Long minutes later, Steve woke up. His sleepy eyes opened and settled on Tony, a small, content smile grazing his lips.
“Are you okay with this today?” she asked. “I was sure you guys would want a bit more privacy before you introduced him to the whole gang, and I know Clint invited more people than you thought would be there.”
“I have a… thing in DC,” Natasha said, while putting her empty plate in the dishwasher. “Minor issue, no need to call in the whole team, but I thought I’d head out early, just in case.” She looked down at her wristwatch and cast them a crooked smile. “Speaking of which—see you later. Oh and Tony…” As she walked around the counter, she came to a stop directly next to Tony, putting a hand on his shoulder. “Glad to have you back.”
Tony nodded, though his body was still tense. He felt him clench and unclench around him, then wiggle his hips a little.
. You saved Millions of lives.” He smiled earnestly. “I just want you to know that there’s still a lot of people who remember that.”
beneath all those new insecurities, he reached forward, and boldly cupped Steve’s cock through his pants. “Any objections?”
“Marshmallows? It’s… mostly sugar, very unhealthy, will probably keep you up all night. How have you never heard of marshmallows before?”
Barnes looked at him for another long moment, then, with a heavy breath, he turned around fully. “Look, Stark. I don’t know how to make this any clearer for you. Steve cares about you.
“You didn’t remember,” she said in typical Natasha fashion. They often came back to this—that he’d forgotten her.
“He would know,” Barton said, grinning as he pointed a thumb in Agent Coulson’s direction. “He’s your biggest fan.”
Maybe he just needed to accept it. That Tony had never been meant to be Steve’s. He’d always been Indries’—and always would be. There was something about losing your one great love that just left you hollow, and it had never been in Steve’s power to heal Tony’s wounds.
Steve looked around, frantically, then his gaze fell on a manhole in the middle of the room. There wouldn’t be room for all of them. The next thing he knew, Tony had pushed him forward, while his own body was already encased in the Iron Man suit.
Spider-Man had managed to wrap up Ant-Man, while Vision, Rhodey and Natasha were keeping the others in check. In the distance, Tony saw a de-Hulked Bruce getting shackled by Ross’ men. He looked terrible, his skin full of ashes, but when he caught Tony looking, he cast him a small smile.
Lost in his thoughts, Tony was almost past Simmons Hall, when a familiar figure suddenly crossed his path. He stopped in his tracks—probably not so gracefully—and valiantly fought the urge to just empty his stomach right on the grass in front of Steve’s feet.
“If anything goes wrong, inform the others,” he told the room in general and heard JARVIS agree with a fair amount of disapproval in his voice.
Afterwards, they lay on the bed, holding each other. They talked, all the while touching, caressing each other as much as they could.
Steve huffed, and cast him a very disapproving look from where he was hovering over Tony’s belated Christmas-miracle-chubby.
Steve took a step forward and faced the open doorway. Inside, on a long sofa, sat Mister Hammer, and he looked ready to strangle anything that moved.
Steve hummed and kept staring at Tony for a good minute, before he broke eye-contact. When he spoke, his voice was very quiet. “There were a lot of theories while you were out. Most of them were complete nonsense. Mind-reading, prophetic visions, hallucinations, but you know which one I found the most reasonable?”
“You’re getting a bit personal, there, don’t you think?” he asked, and then, without taking his eyes off the man, motioned for the paper draft in front of them. “You’re here to discuss the latest changes with me, aren’t you? I think we should stick to that.”
—because however much Bucky’s words were meant to soothe him, they mostly brought back all of those horrible memories of Tony lying lifelessly on the ground. The palladium, the Chitauri invasion, Aldrich Killian,
For the first time in weeks, Tony felt some calmness settle inside him. It was wonderful. And terrifying.
Tony shuddered in effect, his eyes rolling closed, wondering how he hadn’t even heard Steve enter the barn. That probably was a testament to how irrevocably lost he felt. “Laura asked me to look at the tractor,” he explained. “Figured it was a good way as any to get my mind off of things for a bit.”
Barnes smirked a bit at that, and soon they were chuckling together. The kind of laughter that was disguised as much as possible. Like two boys giggling in church.
With that, he yanked her pants and underwear over her hips. She gasped and leaned her forehead against the wall, biting her lip. He spun her around again, pressing her back against the wall and himself against her. She glared at him and one corner of his mouth lifted into a proud smile, his free hand dancing across her middle. “You’re the most gorgeous woman I’ve ever met,” he said softly as his fingers slipped between her legs.
He shook his head vehemently. Not quite putting his thoughts together but at least seeing the puzzle-pieces in his mind. Vaguely, he remembered falling from the train in Italy, again, falling, falling,
Steve gathered all the courage he had—the courage that always came so easily on the battlefield, but not when it came to matters of the heart. It felt like he was baring himself, making himself oddly vulnerable, and he’d never liked that feeling. And yet… not risking this—not risking himself—felt worse than knowing he’d never given it a try.
He leaned back in his chair somewhat, and smiled at the scene playing out in front of him. Phil was cooing at the baby, while both Pepper and Rhodey had an arm around Tony’s middle to get a closer look. Natasha had somewhat sneaked up on Bucky, delicately brushing her thumb across Ian’s forehead, and Bucky himself still looked like he would soon pass out.
The electricity flowed from Mjolnir into the cradle, and Steve focused in, picturing each lightning strike as a pulse of life, and the cradle a window into the unknown. Muttering some mumbled words under his breath, Tony put his hands on either side of the armatures.
“He said he wanted to see an empire fall,” Bucky told him after another moment. “With these guys he can do it. They speak thirty languages, can hide in plain sight, infiltrate, assassinate, destabilize, They can take a whole country down in one night. You’d never see them coming.”
More weeks passed and there was just too much on his mind. There were so many things that had already changed: They hadn’t moved to the facility at New York’s outskirts, Rhodey and Sam hadn’t officially joined the Avengers, yet, Thor hadn’t left Earth, and Bruce was still around, though he and Natasha had apparently let go of their whatever-it-was romance.
Tony scoffed. “There’s no problem. You’ve heard Steve’s future-self: We’re all going to be one happy family.”
“‘s a good song. Did you know the songwriter died in the back seat of a car on his ride home, quietly choking on his own vomit?”
Steve smiled far too pleasantly. “You won’t have to,” he said, “because I can always override the codes by putting in the main code.”
“Well, you’re a man hard to get a hold of, Captain,” Fury answered. “My sources told me your team is about to become a full-fledged international incident. Care to explain just what the hell’s goin’ on?”
When the red body broke free of the cradle, hovering in midair and staring into space, they all set into battle stance. This was a point to make or break, Steve knew, and his heart all but stopped when the figure rushed at Thor, pummeling him to the ground before he flew over to the window front.
“Oh, I see how it is,” Tony snorted, petting Steve’s head affectionately. “Now that Barnes finally cracked you come crawling back to me. Gotta tell you, if you think I’m just lying around here all day, waiting for you to put it to me, you’re wrong. I’m not some Victorian mistress needing to be bedded in the evening, Rogers.”
As soon as the rain had stopped, they’d gone hunting together, and Tony had even helped him with gutting and cleaning the animals after. They’d eaten as much as their stomachs allowed, and afterwards, Tony immediately set out to repair and improve their shelter.
“I just… I was wrong about him,” Tony said with a hopefully firm voice. “I don’t like him. He’s dumb, and arrogant and mean. I’m allowed to not like people.”
The light didn’t quite manage to illuminate the whole room, but Tony could see they were indeed inside some sort of maintenance room, with lots of shelves and boxes. With a quick glance, he confirmed that the ceiling looked like it’d be holding up just fine and they were in no immediate danger.
In the background, Tony heard the others talk quietly, with Natasha scanning their files, trying to find how much Ultron had plainly deleted, and what he was making use of. With the ringing in his ear, Tony didn’t get half of what they were saying, and he didn’t need to. He had been hands-deep inside those neuro-nets, and it was clear that if Ultron had access to the internet… he was long gone, and everything with him.
“Nothing I built is a let-down, wing-boy,” Tony said with a smile. “So, I take it you were pretty good with maneuvering them?”
“Stark is…” Bucky started, frowning as he visibly searched for the right words. “He doesn’t really do compromises, does he?”
“I've been looking for you,” he said, glancing meaningfully at Natasha. “Maria just called. Project Pegasus is down.”
The calls came more frequently, after that. At first, they didn’t really say anything substantial, only tiptoeing around the giant elephant in the room. It wasn’t quite small talk either, more like fragile inanities that, once taken into a wrong direction, could prove distracious.
There were hushed voices in front of his cell, and if he’d open his eyes, he would probably see Steve pacing back and forth along the large window front.
“Might as well start now.” Tony would rather get this over and done with. The morphine was rushing through his blood, making the dull ache fade into nothing and his head go even lighter, but Tony needed Extremis to finally get on with the healing program.
The fire of his eyes reflected in Steve’s as he moved towards him and Tony felt his own start to sting with comprehension.
It took three sweeps of the city before Maria Hill finally sent them their current location. All the while, an hour rolled by with long conversations, all with the loom of the impending storm weighing over their heads. The uncertainty of where the future would take them… of where to search for a solution.
It was hard being apart from him, much more than Steve thought it would be. And it had only been a week.
“And you didn’t tell me, you asshole!” Rhodey said, actually looking affronted. “Dibs on male first name, you hear me?”
“Yes,” Tony snapped. “But the UN has a slightly different opinion. The second Steve dragged Barnes out of Vienna, almost killing men from the GSG9, the UN decided to eradicate them on sight, given the chance. This was my only veto option.”
“No,” Nat said, “from the duty his father had thrust on his shoulders. From serving as God’s punisher. From being everyone’s scapegoat.”
“I… I want to,” Steve said, and it was the truth. No matter how nervous he was, he wanted to experience this with Tony. Now.
Tony regarded the new group, telling himself vehemently that it was okay to not be a part of it. That it was okay for Bruce and Clint and Thor to not be here, either, because things changed. It was just how life worked.
Tony blinked himself back into the room. “You’re one of the guys who apprehended Khalid Khandil three years ago,” he stated, snorting at the absurdity of it all. What were the goddamn odds that Steve would
Steve was about to open his mouth and ask what had happened, when a long sigh rolled off Tony’s shoulders and he collapsed wearily against the wall. “Or I’m losing my mind.”
Tony was well aware of what Helen could do, of course. She was by far the most visionary thinking person he’d ever come across, but this… This was a whole new game. Ironically, it was Ultron, and Vision and JARVIS that had pushed her research by a good twenty years, and brought up possibilities that would have been unthinkable just a few months before.
And it would’ve hit dead center, if Steve didn’t catch it in mid-air, popping it into his mouth instead. “Be nice, Clint”, he reprimanded.
That, Tony realized, might just be the most peaceful conversation they’d had since… well, quite frankly, since they’d met.
After another good few days, however, Tony seemingly dropped his resolution to keep Steve at a safe distance. A little, at least. He seemed more relaxed around him, and at dinner, he even went so far and shared a few stories as well. He told Steve about his past years, about taking over Stark Industries when he was only twenty-one, how he both admired and feared Obadiah and that he still had trouble believing that he could’ve betrayed him like that. He told Steve about how he’d always known that those parties, the many girls, the booze and other narcotics, were slowly wearing him down. That the need to find some kind of meaning for his life had always been there, but he’d never found the purpose to really change his ways.
Children had been off the table for the whole span of his adult life. In his younger days he simply hadn’t wanted anything to mess with the whole playboy lifestyle—partying and jet setting didn’t work well with having kids, after all. When he’d turned thirty he’d partied and jet setted (and done other things) enough to know that he’d be the world’s most horrible father, and dismissed the idea with a shrug and a sip of his current drink. Come forty, he’d thought about it here and there, but never too seriously, at least never enough to actually do something about it. After Afghanistan, after realizing how meaningless his life had been up to this point, he’d convinced himself that it’d be better to have the Stark dynasty end with him. In his darkest hours, he’d come to believe that aside from maybe his engineering skills, he really had nothing to give to a son or daughter.
Tony’s throat ran dry and his heart started pounding. “You don’t want this. People tend to go insane when faced with… with me.”
to drag his eyes away if only to not lose his sanity. Instead, he stared down at the latest protocol, scrolling back a little and—yup. DUM-E’s code had worked perfectly when Obi had entered the lab, and only when he’d called him a ‘giant pile of crap’, DUM-E had ceased all function.
Steve’s heart started pounding. There was a strain in Tony’s voice he’d never heard before, and for half of a second, Steve thought he might be as nervous as he was.
It might have something to do with Phil still getting that awestruck fanboy-look whenever he talked to Steve, but Tony guessed he was also overprotective of the brown-haired Inhuman-girl.
Barnes nodded, obviously not entirely satisfied but resigned that he would get nothing better out of Tony right now. And that was that. He left the room, leaving Tony to his thoughts.
“Hush,” Natasha reprimanded and pressed a soft kiss on Steve’s left cheek. Only then Steve realized how much his voice was shaking. “He’s fine. You’re fine. You’ll tell him, and then you’ll have a cute little baby and be all insufferably in love with it. It’s gonna be annoying as hell but we’ll leave you be because we love you.”
That kicked it. Steve hadn't even realized he moved, but the next moment his fist connected with Stane's jaw, hard. It was an uppercut. Steve could see surprise flitting across the man's face briefly as his head whipped back before consciousness slipped away, and Stane slumped to the floor in a heap.
At Maria’s wide, questioning eyes, however, Steve added: “Helen offered her help. If you want the details you gotta ask Tony or Bruce, it’s… miles over my head, but, yeah, Ian is ours.”
Something in Steve’s heart warmed at the idea, and made him think back on their own scattered team with sorrow.
“You’re shaking,” Steve pointed out, not unkindly, and put both hands on Tony’s face, softly caressing his cheeks. “What happened in there? I thought everything went just as we’d planned.”
He leaned back, looking right at Steve with a small smile. It was strange… the weight of the nightmare was still there, but he felt a million times lighter nonetheless. “Being your friend has never been anything but complicated, punk.”
Which left him here, scared shitless that Parker or one of the others would, for some reason, not make it out of here. And that it’d be on him.
Tony rolled his eyes at him, before he walked further into the room. He approached the opposite wall almost reverently, and Steve felt a little thrill run through him as Tony squatted down and reached out to softly touch the canvas.
“Not likely, Elsa. There will be friendship bracelets now, and insider jokes, and couples’ nights. From here on out, you'll hear this beautiful voice every day.”
Steve hummed, eyes briefly lingering on the likely dark circles around Tony’s eyes. “I’m glad, but… no work for the rest of the night, alright? Haven’t seen you in days, wanna spend some time with you.”
As always, Tony gave Steve a quick kiss and cast Natasha a friendly smile as he walked by, but there wasn’t ever any time for small-talk. Not when there was a job to be done, and getting Barnes' brain sorted out was nothing if not time-sensitive.
As if reading Tony’s mind, Maria raised her glass in Steve’s direction. “So, Steve, Tony just told us—”
Enough until they could take Ultron down together. After today, he knew they could use all the support they could get. And anyway—Steve had realized by now that their attacking them in Sokovia and Wakanda had been motivated more by repressed rage against Tony and Stark Industries than anything else. And maybe they could still salvage this, have them get to know Tony. Maybe they could take them in, give them a home, too… even after all that they had put them through.
The boy nodded and gave him the plane. It was only when Tony turned it around in his hands, that Steve realized that one of the wings seemed to be broken. Tony inspected it with just as much concentration as he sported whenever he tinkered with the Iron Man suits, and Steve couldn't hold back a small smile when Tony hummed in pointed consideration, rubbing his chin.
Steve nodded. “I think it’s our choice to make, but… I want it to be,” he said, and the emotion storming Tony’s heart threatened to overflow.
Steve however, had no such reservations. He let his arms close around Tony’s waist, pulling him in; his body rejoicing when he felt the evidence of Tony’s interest.
He grabbed for one of his larger hammers on the way to the cabin that was situated on the far side of the workshop. This wasn’t exactly the way to go, Tony knew that, but a more careful approach was definitely too time-consuming. And as soon as the others caught up to what he was about to do, every chance at seeing who he once had been was off the table.
They walked to a clear area of the meadow. Tony rolled up his sleeves, while Steve dropped his jacket to the ground. “We should start off slow,” he called over. “You haven’t done this in a while and you’re still recovering. I’m gonna try to hit you. You block.”
Wobbling around a bit, moving from one leg to another, Tony somehow managed to put the undersuit back on. Next to him, Steve had his pants on already, stepping into both boots.  “Smart,” Tony commented distractedly, zipping himself up.
“And if I weren’t drunk?” he prompted, chuckling lightly when Steve cast him an unimpressed look. “If I were sober and just really into you?”
As Steve’s hands moved down to rest at the small of Tony’s back, Tony tightened his grip around his neck. When the song ended, he pulled back a little to look him in the eye, and the pretense of dancing stopped. Now they just held each other, and Steve stared down into the brown of Tony’s eyes.
“How’s that funny,” Bucky asked and it was in that second, that he noticed Steve’s attire for the first time. Or his lack of an attire.
Tony suddenly let go of Steve’s hand, sitting up. He stared at him for a very long moment, as if only now taking him in fully—his face, his hair, his uniform. His face flickered over Steve’s body as if cataloguing the changes he was probably detecting just then, and Steve had to school his expression when Tony’s eyes turned to slits.
His human hand hurt. There was blood on the floor. He had killed him. His name had been important. But he didn’t know why, and he supposed he shouldn’t care.
“I know,” Steve replied. He blindly reached for their bed-drawer, followed by a hand that slipped behind Tony’s rear. His lubed middle finger rubbed him tenderly before diving inside. “Christ, you’re hot.”
Cautiously, Steve reached for one of Tony’s hand. “It wasn’t your fault. I mean, I wasn’t there, I don’t know the specifics, but I know
When Steve merely grunted something unintelligible, his eyes firmly trained on today’s newspaper, Tony and Vision exchanged looks. “Babe?” Tony prompted.
“Be careful,” Steve commented on an amused chuckle when Tony tried to push his still half-hard erection back into his pants. “Don’t hurt yourself.”
A surprised chuckle left Tony’s lips when Steve pulled him back by the hand and drew him into a kiss before they had even reached the bed.
When Tony looked back up, Vision was looking at him in a way that spoke volumes of how not impressed he was. In fact, it looked like he was barely refraining from rolling his creepily serene alien eyes.
The excitement in Tony was so tangible he nearly vibrated in Steve's arms. It was adorable. Steve's smile softened and he tilted his head, still maintaining that nonchalant air. "Who knows? PhDs in Arts aren't as rare as you'd think." He pecked Tony's cheek. "We'll see how they find me, and if that doesn't work out, I'll find something else."
Natasha pursed her lips, then said, “He’s referring to Operation Paperclip. After World War II, SHIELD recruited German scientists with strategic values.”
Steve honestly didn’t know what he thought would happen when he lost his virginity. Truth be told, he hadn’t given it much consideration until it was over.
“I’ve… always admired him,” he admitted, then breathed a soundless laugh. “The scariest thing about this is… after the initial shock, it’s… I can see myself falling for him so easily.”
that once I find some peace of mind, you come along—once again—to mess it all up. So I was angry, at myself, mostly, but I’ve been angry at you for so long that it just felt easier to stick to that, and I…” He trailed off, his eyes large and uncertain. “Could you please say something? Tell me I’m not completely crazy? ‘Cause a part of me is still expecting you to laugh at me any second.”
“Nice,” Nat said, grinning at Tony, who was now only wearing boxer-briefs and a black tank top. There were a few drops of that green slime on his arms and legs as well, Steve noticed, but otherwise, he looked mostly the same as Steve remembered him. Maybe a few more gray hairs as well.
“Seriously, your sappiness reached a whole new level. You should probably have someone check your head or something.”
Tony nodded as well, and made to stand up. At the door he paused, looking back. “He doesn’t expect you to be the same person, you know? He just wants you to get better.”
“For the past four years, you operated with unlimited power and no supervision. That’s an arrangement the governments of the world can no longer tolerate.” Another one of the senators walked closer and put a large stack of papers down next to Steve. “But I think we have a solution.
“Ahh,” he breathed, arching again, moving just a little harder. “Anything you want... I’ll do anything.”
. Bucky made a low, impressed whistle next to him and ordered a vodka before turning to him. "You don't waste your time, huh?"
Dammit, he really wanted to brush her hair out of her face, wanted to cup her cheek, showing her that it was alright to open up right now, but his goddamn arm was gone.
Steve moved forward, wanting to help, but was held back by the soldiers in front of him. He could barely keep up with them, and some of their hits had definitely cracked some of his ribs already.
God, Steve might not have a lot of experience with bottoming, but he sure as hell knew how be pushy when he needed it.
‘Did you know’, his eyes all but screamed, and Tony shook his head ever-so-lightly, before dropping his gaze on his hands once more.
“You didn’t hurt me,” Tony said again, coaxing his hold on Steve to lessen with another squeeze. His eyes fell closed, his head landing back on the tractor’s surface as he began moving on Steve’s length in languid, cooling strokes. He loved this part. Despite the fact that he sure as hell wouldn’t be getting it up again, it was perfect. Just knowing that he could make Steve feel good, only by staying tight around him.
Before Tony could go on, Steve took his face between his hands and kissed him. And then, there was nothing but them. Steve’s mouth moved against Tony’s as he seized his forearms, gasping when his own back collided with some table.
Or well, he'd thought he was, but apparently not. Apparently all it took was some horizontal messing about with Tony Stark, and he was completely gone. And being referred to as Tony's boyfriend…
He watched Steve warily, before rising up on his toes and pressing his lips against Steve’s. Fuck it, he couldn’t let Steve go while they were fighting. It didn’t matter that he was angry now—Steve’s head needed to be clear and they could still argue about this afterwards. At the first touch of their lips Steve sank into him, one arm wrapping tightly around Tony’s waist as Steve’s other hand touched his neck, holding him close.
“All yours,” Tony ground out, his voice beautifully hoarse already. “But I won’t last long if you keep that up.”
"I'm mostly trying to get naked," Tony shot back and let the rest of the undersuit fall to the floor. He raised an eyebrow at Steve, who was still very much clothed and apparently not even trying to do something to amend that.
“What?” Sam was the first to find his voice. He had turned around in the cockpit, staring at Steve with wide eyes. When Steve nodded, there was a blaze of confusion and surprise on his face. “I’m your friend, man.
Steve sighed, walking over to his own nightstand and putting the tablet down there. “What do you want me to say?”
Steve smiled, and Tony huffed at the probably very eager way he reached for the bottle of oil standing next to their bed.
“I don’t,” she replied. “But I didn’t mean for you to find out like that. I thought I was protecting you. I only saw all that James had put me through and I didn’t want your life to become like that.”
Steve was studying himself in the mirror and slowly swiped the razor over his skin, his movements measured and well practiced. If it weren’t for the dried blood that crusted his lower lip, as well as the bruises and cuts that mapped his face, one could almost believe this was an everyday shave.
“You looked so good in that tux,” Steve said. “But I like you better out of it,” he decided, head dipping to suck at Tony’s left nipple.
Pressing his face against Steve’s cheek, Tony knew only two things: Steve, and the blessed, medicated nothingness, finally—mercifully—engulfing his mind.
Tony broke away with a pout. “You wanna get breakfast? That means getting ready. And… getting dressed.”
The applause was instant and all-consuming. At first, only the press, the science department, and Tony’s friends stood up, but soon enough, the whole audience was rising from their seats and clapping their hands. Even the senior partners gave Tony a respectful nod as he passed them on the way back to his table. That was… hilarious in itself. Tony remembered the day he’d first uttered the words ‘clean energy’ in one of their board meetings. Remembered how Obi’s gaze had darkened and how most people had given him one of those ‘Oh, you naive little child’ looks that Tony had been pretty familiar with at that point.
Pulling on a fresh pair of underwear and then trousers, he turned to face Tony. "We're meeting your godfather today, aren't we?" he asked, trying very hard to not spit out the word 'godfather' with as much loathing as he had for the man. It wouldn't do to be disrespectful to the man so long as Tony had any kind of legal relations with him.
The days that followed were filled with preparations for the ball. So busy, in fact, that Steve hardly had a chance to speak to Tony, and almost no time at all to see him alone.
“Shouldn’t let this become a habit,” Steve murmured as he looked at the unconscious form, then he started to run. As he headed towards their car, however, Steve spotted spotlights and dozens
“Steve…” Tony breathed, and there was now a palpable tremble in his voice that had Steve step closer to him.
And they certainly could need all the support they could get. For once, they’d be treading on unknown grounds. Last time, Wanda had been on their side and Pietro… Pietro had been dead.
“Be careful,” he told Tony via their private line, trying to make his way up the hill. He didn’t want his previous orders for Tony to disarm and disable to backfire.
“Impossible,” Strange gasped, disbelieving. He was doing something with his hands, green lights flickering along his fingers, and his eyes widened.
Another sigh from Bruce. “A student then. But Steve’s still very much a staff member. If anyone gets the wrong idea, it could cost him his job and worse, you know that?”
“Did you hear what I said?” Steve asked. Not that he’d expected cheering and tears of joy but… alright, maybe he’d expected some of that. “I just told you that I want to have this kid with you.”
“I was asked to see that you are both not crushed by debris,” Vision answered. “And I intend to agree with Natasha whenever I can.”
It was impossible to tell, but somehow, Tony felt as if he was a tightrope walker, crossing over a giant abyss, and it was only a matter of time before he’d fall. And once that happened... it was a fifty-fifty chance if he’d fall down into a safety net, or into open air.
“Of course she was,” Tony said, annoyed that Natasha knew him so well—know that one of his greatest weaknesses had always been curiosity.
“Steve,” Tony prompted very gentle. He leaned in, then slowly, hesitantly, kissed him. “I love you,” he breathed against his lips.
Tony sighed and rubbed his forehead. “For now, there’s nothing we can do. Maria and I have been trying to establish the Avengers as an official defense institution, but it’s just… they’re really making it fucking difficult.”
Steve knew he must look like the dumbest person on earth. How was he supposed to react to that? And Tony
“A friend,” Bruce said, as he sat down at his own workstation, staring at the monitor in front of him. “You know it’s a hassle to get the handymen here on such a short notice.”
Steve would lie if he said he wasn’t relieved to hear those words. He had sort of expected to be astronomically bad at this, but… doing this with Tony came easy, just like their friendship had always been.
He frowned. “Limitations? I’m not sure what you mean—we can’t put our own failures on other people’s shoulders. If we fail, it’s something we have to face as a team.”
Eventually, he dropped back on the bed, his hand brushing over Tony’s side, his fingers tangling in the ends of his hair. Tony edged closer, his tired brown eyes meeting Steve’s thoughtful glance.
He was wearing chinos, a grey cardigan with a white polo shirt underneath, and with the red skin and the intense blue eyes, the picture he made was so weird and somehow so fitting for what Steve had secretly envisioned JARVIS to wear if he’d have a body that Steve couldn’t hide a small smile.
him? Just like that, some final barrier was crossed. They’d both stumbled headfirst into this, not holding back and therefore falling so fast it was a bit dizzying. And maybe they really
When Steve turned around, however, his eyes stuck on Tony’s face. He didn’t just look troubled at what he was seeing on the news channel, he had that closed-off expression he often sported when he was trying to shield his own emotions. It was a similar expression to the one Tony had worn when he’d been poisoned with the Palladium. The one when he was trying to keep something to himself. His eyes were carefully blank, but behind that—hopelessness and grief, coupled with a final, glomming ounce of determination to find a solution to face the unbeatable odds.
After a moment, Tony chuckled lowly, shifting a bit to make the noise stop. His body was half-draped across Steve’s, while his arm simultaneously tightened further around his torso. Tony shifted upwards, drinking in the sight. Steve’s blond hair was ruffled in the aftermath of their lovemaking and wild with sleep.
It took several long seconds for Steve to understand what had just happened, and when he did, Bucky was already yelling at him.
As Steve looked at each of them more closely, it became clear that some were more battered than others, but at first glance, nothing seemed too serious. Natasha had some smaller scratches on her face and Sam was kneading his left leg with a pained expression. Bruce stretched his arms, his bones popping with the movement, then wrapped the warming blanket more tightly around his bare chest.
The car shook from the turbulence and weight on top of it, and then it was mayhem, with dozens of HYDRA agents running at them from every which direction.
Tony. He knew his laughter, his smiles, even his tears. He’d tasted his lips and promised him that Tony would never be that for him: the devil.
Barnes didn’t waste any time. He quickly pushed, flipping Tony over on his side. He grabbed for Tony’s other arm, moving both upwards so Tony couldn’t shoot at him, then wrapped his legs around his middle in a firm hold.
“This is crazy,” Tony gasped, pulling his mouth away from Steve’s. He didn’t put up a fight when Steve turned them around, hovering over him now. Instead, his legs went around his waist automatically, pulling him back down.
“I really hate aliens,” Tony exclaimed with a groan as he pulled the helmet off and promptly stepped out of the suit. Once he’d done that, it folded in itself, until it wasn’t much larger than a cube. “Jo, be a darling and run Decon-Protocol.”
Tony was already closing his eyes when Steve neared him and then there was a warm hand at his neck, drawing him in.
“Idiot,” Steve said as he rested his elbows on his knees, then dropped his forehead onto his unbloodied wrists and sat there for a long time.
He grimaced when he spotted the burn-mark on the guy’s leg, but there was nothing to be done about it. He needed to get past.
“Can’t shut him down via Extremis, maybe, but a direct link should work just fine.” With that, Tony’s eyes went black and he powered up the machine without even touching it. Sitting on a stool beside it, he strapped wristbands dangling on cables to each arm and placed the cap, also attached to the machine by cables, onto his head. It clipped itself in place with the blunt-ended pincers round its rim.
The kiss lasted a long moment, and Steve's intoxicated mind wasn't fully registering everything, only the slick slide of their tongues and a heat that coiled in his abdomen. He wasn't even fully aware of where they were until Tony broke the kiss and pushed him a little back. Steve went easily, not wanting to impose, and he nodded his head at Tony's suggestion. It was a good idea. Privacy would allow for more kissing… more than kissing, maybe…
Tony’s brain shorted right out. Then he was floating in space, looking down at a crumpled form lying at the floor of the library. His form. His
“This is crazy cool,” Barnes said, his voice awed. He was lying on Steve’s other side, and leaned up a bit to look at Tony. “Thanks for bringing us.”
"So you're DUM-E, huh?" Steve asked the device, feeling a little silly to be talking to a… well, 'inanimate thing' didn't feel like the right term to use for it. "That's not a very nice name, huh?" he asked, side-eyeing Tony for a moment before turning back to the mechanical arm. It could hear him, so he figured it was only polite to introduce himself. "I'm Steve Rogers," he said, offering his hand to shake the thing's claw.
Natasha ducked her head, smiling. “Sweet,” she commented. “You realize Tony’s doing it all the time?”
Tony had been reaching for a bottled water, but his hand dropped when Peter said that. “I’m sorry I pulled you into this. I wouldn’t have done that if I’d had another choice—”
Natasha shrugged in an attempt at nonchalance. “I don’t know. I know what I would’ve expected from him before, but…” A sigh rumbled through her body. “I suppose that doesn’t matter anymore, does it?”
“I, uh, I need a bit more time,” Steve murmured after a moment. “And yeah, I know I’m not giving you the clearest indicators of needing time, right now, but I do. I… this is all so new.”
“I suppose you've been working for Tony longer than anyone else?” Steve asked, trying to change the subject to something lighter.
They walked down the street, checking the decaying doors and buildings for some signs that someone broke in. It took three blocks, before Steve spotted a shattered window at the end of the street. Since they’d walked around in a circle around the landing strip, the house was only ten minutes away from the airport.
At that, Tony exhaled a startled laugh, then broadly grinned at Steve. “That… actually sounded a lot like the vow you said at our wedding.”
Tony was kneeling again, and he held Steve’s gaze as his mouth dipped toward his cock. His tongue tentatively curled around the tip of him, sucking him between his lips.
“Give him a break,” Natasha told Clint, eyes twinkling with mirth. “He’s happy ‘cause he got laid. Let him bask while he can.”
“Hey, big guy,” Tony breathed, putting both hands gently on Steve’s cheeks. He was trying to lean in again, but Tony only cast him a calming smile and shook his head. “It’s a bit… public here. Let’s just go home, I’ll call us a cab, alright?”
Tony raised a brow, and Steve felt a jolt of satisfaction rush through him that he could surprise a man like him. “You’re really something, mystery-man,” Tony said with a far more genuine smile. His eyes raked over Steve’s face, over his hair, down to his shirt. “A bit old-fashioned maybe, but definitely something.”
The whirring got louder and DUM-E’s claw honest to god sagged down as if slumping in on itself. But instead of just hanging there, the claw opened up and tugged at Tony’s shirt, a sort of whiny noise filling the air.
Every hallway was filled with huge portraits of Tony’s ancestors. And the walls seemed to whisper with every step he took. Lifeless eyes trailed his every awkward movement as Stane talked about the mansion’s everyday business.
Steve nodded numbly. He stood up, staring out of the windows towards the ocean. “Does Rhodey know?” he asked. “And Pepper?”
“You shouldn’t have come,” Bucky eventually said, and Steve heaved a breath of relief. So he was back to himself again.
Thus, his fist came towards Tony’s face in slow motion and Tony struck it away. Steve threw another blow and Tony countered. It became a slow dance, weaving back and forth, a smooth, intricate motion.
A white, sourceless light phasing into black. Tony was caught there, trapped between here and… somewhere else, between the green pulses pouring out of the Eye and the raging black nothingness around him, the two conflicting energies crackling through him like an unending lightning blast.
Steve nodded, more to himself, and let his gaze wander across the landscape. From here, he could even see the lower part of the mansion where he knew the workshop was located—and the adjoining room.
Her head whipped towards him and she said, emphasizing every word by slamming her hand on the table, “It’s not about
Tony sighed when Steve checked his watch again. He’d been doing that for the better part of the last hour, always checking his watch and always telling him it wasn’t the right time, yet.
“You’ll be careful, right?” Tony asked as he handed Steve his pants. “Promise me. I can’t raise that kid without you, I’m gonna spoil him rotten and he’ll become one of those horribly nosy kids everyone hates.”
How foolish he had been. How utterly naïve he’d been to think that this unspoken thing between the two of them could ever work. Had he really thought that Steve could ever love him? That he could love the
A choked up moan left Tony’s lips, followed by a keening sound that was so excruciatingly erotic that Steve came hard without any sort of warning, his sight whitening out for a moment as he felt Tony shudder and groan helplessly against him as he too fell over the edge.
“I asked her once how she managed to master diplomacy and espionage at a time when no one wanted to see a woman succeed at either,” Sharon said with a small smile. “And she said, ‘Compromise when you can. When you can’t, don’t. Even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right. Even if the whole world is telling you to move, it is your duty, to plant yourself like a tree, look them in they eye and say: No, you move’.”
At one point, Tony couldn’t take the constant chatter anymore, and told the girl—in not so nice terms—that there wouldn’t be any action tonight. He hadn’t really been into it from the start, and now that Steve was in his line of sight all the time, sitting at the bar, hunched above the glass in his hand, Tony had lost all interest in partying tonight.
