“Ellen, I need to ask you something: what happened in the past? I heard you had been forced to sell to the Winchesters?”
“Yeah! I had no idea Dean was dating him! But when I saw his picture in the news and the name, I knew it had to be him!” Jo exclaimed while hugging Castiel.
“Come on, don’t tell me this place isn’t good enough?” Dean’s tone was more teasing than questioning.
“Let’s just say my childhood wasn’t a piece of cake…I was born in a small town by the ocean, I told you that. And if think I love the sea because my best moments were the times I spent in the ocean with my mother. My father didn’t like it much, he would never go there, he said it was a place of temptation because people were half-naked. My mother would take me in secret, whenever he wasn’t around. Once he discovered she would do that, he had beaten her and he had me pray for at least an hour. Still, she would continue to take me. It was a moment of liberty for us. I would play with my friends too, I think it helped me to bond with other kids more than school did. She tried to protect me, but one day, she just…I don’t know what made her snap, but she killed herself when I was ten.”
He intended to sleep, his eyelids were getting heavier. Yet he had to as Castiel one last thing: “Why did you kiss me this time? Your father wasn’t around.”
Before they could make a move toward the man, Dean was advancing on them. Anna gave Cas’ a desperate look and he smiled to the man.
“If you plan to kill me, let me tell you I have sent it to other people and made copies. If anything happens to me, then…”
“Home, to collect some of her things. I’ll need those once she’ll be in your home…I would like to spend that last night into my house.”
Why try to save him at everyone’s expense if he couldn’t even be saved in the first place? That was the most human and logical choice. She gave a shaky breath: “I tried to convince him, but he said you had defied his name, his family. And he said our school would suffer anyway, but that if you didn’t leave, he would completely destroy it…”
Lord, what should he do, now? Well, he would wait. If he could fix it, he would try. And if he was fired, he would just find another job and manage, just like he always did in the past.
Castiel didn’t say anything, and leaned closer as well, this time they were too close not to touch. Feeling his head spin round when Dean and he kissed, he felt almost limp, as if he was allowing all control to fade away for a short instant. Pressing against each other, the craving way Dean tightly embraced him urged him to grip him, slightly planting his nails into his back. Grunting, Dean went at his neck, delightful fire invading his hips and whole being.
Today, he knew John was really right, when he saw how many rich heirs and heiresses could barely do anything on their own because their parents were always behind them, he was thankful. As for Sam, he wasn’t even the kind to get detention anyway…
He was still angry when he thought of yesterday and how he made him sleep in that small room. But weirdly, seeing him cook for the two of them dissuaded him from starting an argument. He didn’t want to argue right in the morning, and he almost felt flattered that the man was bothering to make him breakfast, he didn’t expect that. Castiel served the eggs with a sigh.
It made Dean surely uneasy, remembering how stupid and rude he had been with all of them. He especially wanted to talk to Anna. He eventually managed to get close to her.
Hell…Well, just like Sam learning about Dean’s blackmail, he guessed Castiel would have to learn that one day. But he had already opened up enough for today. However Castiel’s awaiting expression pushed him to give him at least a bit of explanation.
At this, people around went almost silent and Castiel noticed how Dean’s face twitched. Yet the man gathered himself back pretty quickly. “Well, I guess he is. I didn’t have much news recently.”
“Yeah, but I can guarantee you I was nervous as hell!” She giggled and he sighed, happy to see her laugh. “I’ll be nervous tomorrow too. It’s so weird…”
She nodded, it was logical, but she wouldn’t let him see Cas’, though. Maybe it was indeed a way to have fun for the wedding guests, it was entertaining to make sure they wouldn’t sneak away to see each other.
“Maybe another time. That was more effective with him than me. Now with the last card, I guess the Lovers, that’s me and Castiel, that’s also my difficulties to have long-term relationship, that’s, uh…That’s also what I want with him.”
“Not exactly. I want some information on Crowley, actually. The deal is simple: I want someone to help crush Crowley. If I’m right, it’s in your interest. So, if you accept it, everything you hear about him that could be useful to me, you’ll communicate, and I’ll do the same if I learn anything more about his intentions toward you.”
“Pretty good, I must say I got wiser, I avoid the old businesses I used to be in, if you know what I mean.”
“When? At the cocktail? Should I have asked you: ‘Hey sir, are you the one who forced a woman to sell her bar for your benefit?’ You would have considered it an insult.”
He hesitated. On one hand, he knew he should know Castiel better, maybe take things slow. On the other hand, they were gonna live like a married couple already, so what difference a ceremony would really make? And weirdly enough, that would just make him feel more secure, to know that Castiel would be his. But there was something else stopping him.
“Yeah, don’t worry. It’s funny, I’ll be the only one of your friends to come on Castiel’s side. That’s nice of you to have suggested that.”
His future husband giggled and Dean threw him a deadly look. Once in the plane, Claire was smiling like crazy, even her dad seemed impressed but Dean had to take a deep breath to keep composure. They had taken a second-class travel, there were no seats left in First-class and Dean honestly didn’t care. When the engine started, he tensed, making Cas’ smirk a bit.
“No. Ellen would have wanted to, but it would have just made my father madder at me, so either I would be beaten worse, or they would have had to call child services, and for kids like me, they wouldn’t have done much good.”
“Don’t worry for that…I have an idea which would allow me to kill two birds with one stone. Even more than two. First, I need to go and see Charlie.”
Castiel was still absolutely baffled at this. He couldn’t believe Ellen was here, but anyway he was happy to notice she looked perfectly fine. She was briefly introduced to everyone, but she mostly paid attention to Cas’.
He took a deep breath, it wasn’t the moment, and he wasn’t some kid crying because nobody liked him!
A press conference? Oh God, he knew it would happen but he was ready for that! Dean narrowed his eyes, sensing he was scared: “You never did any of it, didn’t you? Of course not. Just agree with what I say, don’t talk much and it will be alright. Come.”
“It’s only my opinion, but don’t you think you were seeking an anchor? A moral compass? Having someone to call you out might have given you the sensation that someone was helping you to keep a grip.”
“I have to go to work for now. Go play with Buddy, I’ll come and fetch you right when I’m over,” he instructed her. She was obviously confused when he left but he still turned his back while Mrs Simmons made her enter the house. When they entered the car, Dean saw Castiel’s head was down, he looked devastated.
Frowning, Castiel watched as Dean pulled something out of his jacket and frowned when he saw a knife. The man tried to pull away, thinking he was going to cut him. Instead, Dean put the blade in his hand.
“Well, I didn’t really lie, we did met in a club and he did fell against my car because he was drunk. It wasn’t two years ago, though.”
She sighed at the unwanted memory: “He was the one who absolutely wanted my bar. I don’t know if you remember but some people wanted to buy it along with the fighting ring.”
“If he doesn’t we’ll go to another place,” Lexie declared. “I’m not getting anywhere if we can’t be together.”
Claire looked at him questioningly, and Castiel just handed the bag to Mrs Simmons before crouching to his daughter. “I’ll explain you later, okay? For now, be nice with Mrs Simmons, okay?”
That was Castiel’s voice. He sprung out of his office immediately and went to see what was going on. Who the hell was here? What was going on?
“Oh, you know kids don’t really realize at that age. And it would be only that one time, for the Honeymoon. We could take other vacations with her.”
“Continue to work in here if you want. Claire seems to like it, and my mother would have wanted her to enjoy it. I guess she would have wanted you to enjoy it as well.”
An athletic middle-aged woman arrived looking at Claire, and Dean stood up. “This is my fiancé, Castiel Novak, and his daughter Claire. Cas’, meet Mrs Tidler.”
He managed to calm her down, eventually, and now she was just playing on the beach with other kids. Castiel was just watching her, thinking of everything that happened, when someone came to him. He was surprised to see Jessica.
“Actually, I knew,” Anna intervened. “I’m sorry I didn’t tell any of you, and that I acted like I had no clue. But Castiel and I agreed that the less people knew, the better.”
“No, but she understood we both did some, so she wants to do the same. Well, why not? We’ll see that when you’ll be older, though,” Cas’ murmured to her, while ruffling her hair.
She ate well, all the activity today had opened her appetite, and that’s something Castiel really valued: daily exercises and a good nutrition, it was essential for a growing child. He heard Dean coming downstairs and they didn’t say a word to each other, the man just warmed up what Mrs Tidler prepared for them. They eat almost silently and Castiel took Claire in his arms once he was done, seeing she was tired.
They remained together a bit, talking about one another, and about small things. Claire eventually fell asleep, and Castiel had to carefully collect her in his arms and laid her in the car, only earning a few grunts.
He stopped and drank, a sad little smile on his lips: “But as I said, he spent a lot of time doing his job, and he didn’t have much time to spend with us. It’s true he put a lot of pressure on us and wasn’t much around. I don’t blame him, though, he was only a man after all and it wasn’t easy after my mom’s death, I was eight and Sam four. Nobody’s perfect.”
“As you wish,” Dean uttered though gritted teeth. God, the guy was such a tease! Or maybe he was hesitant? He wasn’t sure. But he thought of this conversation again and again when he was alone in bed. It was frustrating to be alone, but he was also satisfied. Even though Cas’ had tried to hide the blush, Dean had seen it.
“No, I just wanted to scare him. I thought he would leave, not record everything! I had to delete it all, I couldn’t let that thing in other people’s hands.”
“Saturday, after you left the house. I asked Sue to go and buy some linen for your daughter, and she also had the idea to buy this too. It was very easy to install.”
There was determination, anger, fear and Dean suddenly remembered what he told his father, and how he had held his hand. It had just been a show to make Daddy angry, and now…
Dean frowned and Castiel gave him the bottle back, and strangely enough seeing Dean slowly drinking the amber liquid made him feel vertigo, or was the alcohol? Anyway, it pushed him to continue. He leaned his back against the counter, and couldn’t take his eyes away from Dean even when he took the bottle back.
Before you write it in the comments, I don’t think Charlie would do something like that, it was out of character, but I wanted to explain why she wouldn’t judge Dean too harshly.
“Did you seriously expect me to wait for you for hours?” Castiel sneered. “Those two downstairs, Jasper and Sasquatch, they’re your dogs. Don’t think you have a third one here.”
The relief on Dean’s face was very clear, and Castiel couldn’t help but smile. “Don’t joke with this, it’s not funny.”
“Why was it so important for you to remain hidden? Is it really because you wanted to remain anonymous?” Someone asked Castiel.
“Trust me, those can drive someone mad. It’s not just the shape or the color, those are so expressive, when I saw you for the first time in the sunlight it just struck me…”
“Not only, I told you: I’m bi, so I’m a tad concerned. I hate homophobia, conversion therapy and all that shit. It would be hard for them to attack someone like me, but there are people who can’t defend themselves.”
“No. I don’t know what you have planned, but I have stuff to do. Like, you know, packing my belongings.” He hoped he sounded convincing, and considering how Dean shrugged, he thought there was maybe a chance. “Fine. Remember I want to see you tomorrow. You’ll find me at 5 o’ clock before that restaurant again.”
He bit his lip, he knew the answer already. “Maybe it was the fact he had the guts to stand up to me. I’m powerful, and so people won’t really stand up to me, will avoid telling me what they really think. And you have the impression that if you open up to them, they’ll take advantage of it. When I had Sam and my father, it was different, we would tell each other what we thought, but once they were both gone, it was like…Like I was left all on my own and I could never…I could never really take off that mask with anyone. I do my best on the job I know I’m good at it, but that’s all.”
As he went back, yawning and longing to go to bed, he passed before Claire’s room and hoped she wouldn’t be lost as Castiel thought. She did wake up crying the next morning, and Castiel actually found himself wondering where he was for a slight moment and whose arms were wrapped around him. That moment of confusion didn’t last, he remembered who he went to bed with and where he was. But when did he allow Dean to take him in his arms?!
“Well, I don’t know. If things continue like this, I’ll be fine living with him, I must say since he started to change his behavior, he did become more likeable. I think it was since that night, when I forced him to sleep in my house, in the guest room.”
Though he wanted to yell at him, he held himself, people were looking at them, and he just pulled Castiel back toward him. “What kind of party is that?”
by Shakespeare. He raised an eyebrow, was this really what he liked to read? But now that he thought about it, he had been looking at the library with a lot of interest.
The dishes were delicious, he had to admit it, but he didn’t have much appetite. He tried to force himself to eat, though, he would need to gain forces, he would have work, moving Claire to Anna’s place would take energy. Weirdly enough, it dawned on him that he would live separately from his daughter. That he would only be able to visit her from time to time, and hide while doing so.
“I’m not accusing him, I just say if he was one, I would have no idea and that’s because he is a total stranger.” He took a deep breath, looking at the little girl who wasn’t listening to them, but babbling while playing with her toys. “I know sometimes it doesn’t mean anything. I didn’t think her mom would be the kind to abandon her child. And my mother didn’t think my father would be, well…What he became.”
A short silence passed between them, they just stared at the landscape, Castiel couldn’t help but feel a bit of disappointment knowing they would leave, it was incredible to think they had seen dolphins!
“It’s definitely not easy every days! But I must say that I wouldn’t see myself teaching kids either, especially when you told me about some of the brats you got.”
It was that evening that Anna visited him. He had put Claire in bed when she tapped at his door. He felt a knot in his stomach when he saw her but he wasn’t surprised. He let her enter, and they were both unable to look at each other. She sat in the living room, and he took out two beers. They would usually drink when they were in a good mood but tonight would be different.
“I’m not exactly an expert when it comes to long-time relationships. And I haven’t known that guy for long.”
He thought of it. Indeed, it’s not as if anyone could really use that story against him, it wouldn’t be dangerous in Castiel’s hands, and maybe he would understand him better. After all, it could be worse a shot. But it felt like…Like he was baring himself, like he was vulnerable…But if there was one person he could be vulnerable with, it was his husband, right?
The dogs walked around, still roaming around their master who would give them some attention, though he kept looking at his guest. The dogs soon got interested in him and sniffed him without ever showing any sign of aggression. Castiel petted them shyly, and soon figured they weren’t dangerous. Obviously, their owner was still the one he would have to watch out.
He looked over the card again, he had the impression he was reaching something but couldn’t put words on it. He saw Jessica was taking notes on a little notebook. He grinned slightly.
“I’m gonna do much worse than that if you ever get close! You’re not ever coming back, you’re not tormenting your son or Claire again, or I swear I’ll break every bone in you!”
The blue was incredibly relaxing, it felt incredible to be isolated like this on the ocean, with no one to pry, no one to hear. It was like being in their own little world, their own little bubble. As he was gazing at the infinite blue, Cas’ saw something moving. At the way he straightened his stance Dean saw it too. He made the boat take a turn toward whatever moved, and Castiel saw something emerging from the water.
Once they were in, the first thing they saw was two big forms rushing toward them. Castiel stepped back in surprise but Dean crouched. Two pitbulls licked his face and greeted him warmly, and Cas’ remembered that Dean did spoke about two dogs. One of them went to Castiel who started to back away.
“Dean, don’t worry, I’ll be careful. You should have seen me! I was wearing my most prudish clothes and I was putting on my little angel act! All shy and naïve.”
Castiel woke up with his eyes wide open however no part of him could move but his eyelids. Hell, another sleep paralysis! It was rare for him to have those so close. After his mother’s death he would have those almost every morning but as he grew up, it became occasional. Well, it became occasional after he got help. He breathed and remembered he had to keep collected, it became easy with time. He just had to wait for it to pass…
He only blocked or dodged his blow, keeping his energy and focusing on his breathing. When he felt like attacking again, he went at it. Blocking another blow from Castiel, he sent his knee in the man’s kidney, not hitting hard, but enough to make him bend over and twisted his arm behind his back. Cas’ yelped in surprise at this, and Dean’s other arm encircled his waist, pinning him furthermore. Feeling Castiel’s back pinned against his front made him feel a wave of warmth.
“Why not?” Asked Dean before turning to Castiel wo didn’t seem thrilled by that idea. “Let her have a look, a dress for summer could be nice after all. If you don’t like it, you can still say it.”
Claire was also a bit curious about it, she had never been to a wedding, but she was just happy they would now live with Dean and the dogs permanently. It was simple in her mind, Castiel was happy for her, he kinda wished things could be that simple for him.
“Let’s say that I found a solution to make sure I can keep my eyes on you, and to also make the rumors about my company disappear, rumors which I personally hate and which aren’t good for business. You know, you heard of those, you taunted me about it that morning. Anyway I’m pretty sure I’ll enjoy that solution very much.”
Dean hesitated and finally explained: “I have enemies, and I know some of them are trying to get to me. It might not be linked, but I needed to be sure.”
“It’s not that I don’t trust you, but I promised Dean I wouldn’t tell anyone but Anna. He didn’t tell his friends either. We both feared what would happen if the public learned. Just having people know about me now is already…I don’t like it.”
One or two years…It seemed long, but on the other hand, if he could tame Dean, life would be okay. The man had already softened, if it continued like that, it would be fine.
Claire really enjoyed the risotto along with them and overall it seemed like the evening would go the usual way: Dean would work some more while Castiel would read, and then they would talk a bit and go to bed. At least until someone knocked at the door. Dean was the one to answer and he was pretty surprised to see Dick Roman.
“I’m not answering that. And I guess I should be the one asking you something now: why were you so mad because I worked in the garden?”
“Kill you? Well, that could be an option…After all, I would have no problems getting away with your murder. Even if your corpse was found.”
Castiel frowned, wondering what it was all about. Obviously, Dean was in a better mood, though his eyes showed sadness. After they finished breakfast, Dean took them to the harbor and Cas’ wondered what it was about. Claire was walking at his side, he insisted to hold her hand; he didn’t want her to rush to the water and fall. There were a lot of boats, private boats, some were really big, and Castiel sometimes wondered what you could do with those giant things.
He kinda hoped Dean would laugh and tell him he had no wish to touch him, but the man just shook his head: “Well, I don’t exactly want to pass for an exhibitionist, so when it comes to the public, we won’t go further than any normal couple. I don’t intend to molest you.”
Castiel looked at Dean in surprise and Claire looked up as well in expectation. “We’ll take some times off. After all we are supposed to prepare our wedding.”
He bit his lip. Anna didn’t know that much about his past, he didn’t know why the idea of going to a shrink made him uneasy. But well, he could consider it.
“For once I guess we’d agree,” Castiel admitted. Was he sincere? This was the guy who once told him he wouldn’t hesitate to crush people with his power, and now he spoke like he cared about weaker ones. Was it fake? Maybe not, people could be full of contradictions. If he felt concerned about LGBT people being hurt, maybe he would indeed empathize.
Though she was pouting, the kid did come out of the house and once again, Dean wondered what the hell he would do with the girl around. Once again, Castiel took her in his arms and Dean told him to get in his car and ordered his driver to get the child’s seat from Castiel’s car into his own.
On his side, Castiel had noticed the woman who looked upset after Dean Winchester spoke to her. He felt a wave of sympathy for her and went to her.
“Well, one time I had detention and I refused to attend, my dad was called at school. When he came, he was explained everything, and instead of defending me, he asked the teacher to give me twice more detention. When I asked him why, he told me he didn’t want me to misbehave and that it was part of their job to punish whenever I screwed up. He also told me he didn’t like having to ride to school because of me!”
“I’m just a bit sad. Sometimes adult life is hard. There are mean people and others you have to help but you can’t do it.”
He realized he was sitting, with his head hanging before a cold coffee. He was stunned even at such a young age, Claire saw it. He put her on his laps and tried to explain her.
Why did he have to think of that? He hated those memories, why did I have to haunt him now? Maybe it was because of a discussion he had with Jessica yesterday. It had been their third day here and Sam and Jess had showed them around a bit. Castiel had asked her about her family and she had eventually told him that her parents were religious and they had been really upset when she admitted them she was an atheist, but they were still tolerant enough to accept it. Castiel had never been an atheist, but at a point, he was starting to question his faith. His father never knew, but if he had…Simple doubts would have turned him crazy. Maybe that was what made him think of this? Or maybe the shock he had felt after seeing his father some days ago was resurfacing.
“I don’t know if Dean spoke of us to you?” Benny asked Castiel, trying to find something to break the slight awkwardness. “I must say I was blown off when he told me about you. But I can understand why you wanted to hide.”
He pushed Dean away gently but firmly and started to walk away. He would check out on Claire, maybe. Anything as long as he was away from him. Dean grabbed his wrist.
“We can invite you, Castiel’s friends are welcome,” Dean suggested nicely with a twinge of malice the woman couldn’t see. His future husband sent him a short dead look.
They walked toward a store, and Castiel couldn’t help but be a bit impressed, the store looked huge, and yet not much was exposed, it was all neat and soberly but richly decorated. It had some Italian style, and Castiel didn’t wonder why when he saw the brand: Dolce Gabbana. Yep, not the kind of stores he would usually go into. Dean got in first, if Castiel and his daughter had been coming in like this, they probably wouldn’t have been accepted in. A salesman advanced toward them, with a huge smile: “Mr Winchester? It’s a pleasure to see you!”
. He saw him speaking with a smile to some people. That Castiel guy was looking like he was having a good time, when he was actually miserable inside! His apologies had more of a mocking than anything. He remembered the way he had bowed to him the other night. What would happen if he pushed that guy? Would he crumble, would he try to get away, would he just shut up and submit? Only one way to know.
This made the young man smile. He knew that Sam was still scared and upset about what happened, and he had to reassure him again, and he told him about their life together. Well, of course, he spoke of the daily things, how both he and Claire were getting closer and stuff like that. He didn’t tell him the more…Intimate things, like the way they would weirdly flirt during their training or
At least, Bennie, Lenore, Kevin and Marc were also here, and it helped him to ease up. But they couldn’t be with him all the time, and there were moments when he was alone, and he wasn’t exactly sure how to act.
Well, that was the least he could do. He knew Castiel would have no family, but at least Ellen and Jo could come as his guests’, not as Dean’s. His fiancée still had more people to invite, he didn’t know all of them, he knew Anna would be here.
But before Castiel could do anything, the man had crushed it against the call like crazy. Castiel watched in horror as his cell was now on the ground, completely broken and useless. Hell! And this first he thought of where all the pictures of Claire he didn’t have the time to save elsewhere. Dean chuckled.
This made Dean puff in amusement and he released his partner who stirred a bit. Seeing that no one would hear them, Castiel spoke again: “You know that the night you proposed I was going to go to Crowley to ask if I could fight again in his arena.”
“Oh, we aren’t the only ones who knows it, sometimes there are people, but it’s still better than overpopulated spots if you want some quietness,” the young woman told him.
Of course he had a good idea of what Jonathan did, but he didn’t want to guess, he wanted him to talk. Castiel bit his lip: it was hard to tell, but he knew he had wronged Dean earlier, even if it was him, he knew what he had done was low. He owed him something. Dean knew too much anyway to be left in the dark anymore. He approached and sat on the bed, turning his back to Dean.
“I’m pretty sure it’s gonna be a girl, I have a feeling about it,” Jess explained, “Anyway my parents are impatient to know, my mom can’t hold in place!”
Biting got harder and kisses more fiery as they got to the end. That bliss they felt all the while continued even once they were panting in bed, and Dean cuddled Cas’. He wanted to say something but found no words. They remained silent; eventually he understood Castiel was dozing, leaning against him, his arms around him.
“I know, they told me…But I didn’t want to see you beaten, I just thought you would be scared...I’m sorry.”
Castiel shook his head: “Her mother left a long time ago, I raised her on my own. I would have left her with someone else.”
In case you’re wondering how I choose a card, it’s simple, I just took five from my deck without looking, so the choice is total hazard, but I think I got a good pick! I don’t believe in mediums and all, but I do use the technique I describe to help myself sort my thoughts and feelings sometimes since a friend once offered me a deck of tarot cards.
He got out of her room and found Dean in the garden. For once he wasn’t working, he was just looking at the sea. It was a nice afternoon, a few clouds roamed in the sky, it was too far from the sun to cover it, it would just throw some shadow over the ocean, drawing darker shades of blue. He went at Dean’s side and leaned against the wooden rail.
Although it had been a good day, he was happy to be home. The evening was quite relaxed, both of them were a bit tired, but Dean was happy that Castiel already went to fix his outfit, kinda curious to know what he had chosen. Seeing that Claire wasn’t too tired yet, Castiel allowed her to stay up a bit more.
. Curious, Dean went to sit at the bar, a lot of people noticed him, looked at him and whispered: they knew who he was. The dark-haired man didn’t. He watched the little group, but more of all, he watched that beautiful brunet dancing. He was even surprised he had been allowed to enter, they would usually not let guys dressed like this come in. But well, he was very handsome, Dean was glad his bouncer had been generous enough with that one. He was…Entrancing. There was something breath-taking about that man; those dark hair, those traits, but not only. Dean had seen a lot of people who were incredibly beautiful, but he had something else. That way he was moving, as if nothing mattered…He hardly seemed to care about the woman dancing with him, while most men would have tried something.
“I can be very persuasive. Anyway, that’s good, you got it pretty well, some people really have difficulties with this.”
After her dad gave her the small toys he had brought for her, Claire sat on the carpet near the couch and started to play, still looking around in hope to spot the cat. Castiel spotted something on the coffee table: tarot cards. With curiosity, he took those and observed, it looked traditional although he had no idea what it was really supposed to be like. He really understood nothing to that.
When Dean woke up that morning, he had his arm around something. The sensation was comforting, it melted well into his arm, and he could snuggle…Wait…Opening his eyes, he realized he was holding his future husband. Castiel had his back turned to him and Dean was leaning against him, his arm draped around the man’s stomach. What happened? He didn’t even remember doing that! It was probably a gesture he did in his sleep.
You wouldn’t see much of the city from here, mostly the sea and stars, and it felt incredibly peaceful. He felt a strange vertigo as he could think of everything. He was so far away from New York! God to think of how far he was and how his life had changed! That serene landframe and the quiet night gave him all the space needed to reflect over that. Strangely, he wasn’t really worried for himself or Claire anymore. Anyway, if Dean ever tried to hurt him or his daughter, he would fight back. He didn’t know what he would do, but weirdly enough, he had confidence he could do something.
“Well, for a boy, we thought about Jonathan, and for a girl, we thought about Malory, my mom’s name was Lorelei, and yours was Mary. It’s somehow a mix of the two.”
“You wanted me to come here and be your husband, well now I’m investing myself in your house, isn’t it something you should be happy about?”
“She tried to defend you. I won’t be too harsh with her but let’s say she’ll also have to find another job. At least she will stay in the City if she wishes.”
“For wanted guests maybe. Anyway, this is fine, you’ll see.” Castiel started to walk away: “Just be careful of the cockroaches, there are a few.”
“He did. But I wouldn’t hesitate to defy him anymore. He beat me even more, gave me the belt harder, he even called for some friends once to ‘help him’ when I defended myself. But I wouldn’t take it nicely anymore.”
Considering the look of disbelief on Castiel’s face, Dean smirked: “I can show you the list she gave me, you know those people you sent it too. There is Anna, but also one named Zach and Lexie…”
“Look, he told me Castiel was apparently not afraid or in danger, and I believe it. I observed the two of you, and I don’t think your future husband lied only to reassure Sam. However, I’d like to talk to both of you. Or rather I would like you to talk to me.”
As they went out, both Castiel and Claire Were wearing their new clothes and Castiel couldn’t help but feel like they were exhibited. That wasn’t totally untrue, but only he would be exhibited today.
She nodded silently and caressed her belly again, but with no smile. “I understood you were being overprotective, not snobbish. I don’t say I have no resent left, but I don’t want that to linger. I want my baby to know their uncle, and I want Sam to see you.”
“Good evening to the two of you. I think I already saw you?” His tone could have sounded welcoming, but there was a glint of malice in his eyes.
It came out before he could realize it, Castiel couldn’t help himself: “Did I cause your car any damages? I wasn’t aware I could actually break cars with my shoulder!”
Considering Dean Winchester’s look, he knew that little joke wasn’t appreciated. Apparently he didn’t have much humor, time to swallow his spite and pride and try to play nice. “Okay, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to do that, it was really the alcohol.”
A cold feeling crept through him. He didn’t want Castiel to do that or to even think of it! Dean’s expression made him laugh as he realized what kind of misunderstanding just occured.
They both drank again, and Dean was starting to feel the need to embrace him again, they were both leaning against the counter, not touching but looking at each other.
“Mostly by name. I used to fight in Crowley’s arena, so I heard rumors about him. What did he want?”
I initially intended to talk about Veronica Vanni, but I decided this chapter would be more dedicated to Cas's past, Dean will have his own. Don't hesitate to comment, it's always nice to read what you think.
Looking at him, Dean narrowed his eyes and eventually complied: “Okay. Let’s agree on that: in public, we’ll both respect each other. I also want you to act loving toward me, this has to be believable.”
“I revealed you a lot about myself yesterday, I wasn’t joking when I said I told you more than I ever I ever told anyone. You didn’t tell me that much, though. I would like to hear your story, about that woman.”
As the little girl went back inside, Dean felt horribly conflicted. As long as it was just between he and Castiel, it was fine to push the guy around, but now, there was a kid involved and things couldn’t go the same. He remembered the way Castiel reacted once told he would have to go and live with him. Now he understood why his reaction had been so virulent. Hell, that’s why he didn’t want to leave New York at all, if his child had her life here…
“I see…He would probably not have much remorse killing you. But now, that’s only what Dick Roman says, he and Crowley had always been enemies, so he could be trying to use me in order to get rid of an enemy. Or he could be behind it all, but I doubt it.”
Honestly, he didn’t like to talk about that, he hadn’t liked seeing Castiel banged up, it had never been the intent. He had only intended to frighten him back then, but his future husband had been feistier than expected. But now, that was the thing with Cas’: he gave such an angelic impression, it was impossible to imagine he could be dangerous. And hell, he knew how to use Dean’s feelings to his advantage!
“Not really but I don’t think I’ll ever be.” She smiled comfortingly and put a hand over his shoulder: “I’m sure your little girl will be perfectly alright. And in the end, it will be worth it.”
Dean snorted, indeed he didn’t have much hope. “You know, people would find it suspect if we didn’t sleep in the same bed.”
Taking a deep breath, his future husband looked at him with annoyance: “Why do you want to know that?”
Castiel churned, it was almost two months, and yet it seemed like it would be in two days. Dean wished he had a happier reaction, but he should have expected this. It could have been worse. He bit his lip. “You won’t have much to do, except try some clothes. We’ll”
“At a point, I even stopped living with him, Ellen allowed me to sleep at her place, and she would also feed me. I saved some money for my future studies, I knew I wanted to become more than some thug. The reverend pushed me in that way. But when Ellen had to sell her place and leave, I had nowhere to go. I didn’t want to stay with the Reverend, if he had kept a minor with him, he would have been accused of horrible things. And anyway, my father would have searched for me there.”
.” Once again, thinking about Sam was painful. And it stung to think about that guy, he could still see that body moving without caring about other people’s look, simply and carelessly dressed with no try to appear elegant. Yet he still had more elegance than some people wrapped in thousands dollar suits. And his face, that light smile, this square jaw and those fine eyes…Hell, he still didn’t know what their color was.
Getting a bit closer, Dean hoped he would like what he had to offer. Their elbows lightly touched, Castiel briefly turned to him and Dean looked at the sea as well.
“Yeah, I expected that. Take it as a gift for your…Cooperation. I’ll offer it to you.” It was strangely satisfying to say that, to show him he was rich enough to buy things Castiel couldn’t hope for. He realized he loved to impress the man, maybe because he didn’t seem to be the kind to be easily impressed.
At a point, he took a break to drink some water, and Sue told him it was good someone was taking care of the plants.
“You remember everything I told you?” Dean asked brushing his temple and putting a strand of hair back in place.
The memory of that gaunt bedroom still haunted him, the decrepit smell and walls, as if the whole room was sick…
Castiel nodded and grinned sadly: “You know, you might be the first person to hear that much. I usually wouldn’t talk about my past, or just say the less possible. Why the hell am I telling you so much?”
“No, I would have come with you, I have no choice. But I would have left her somewhere else.” He knew this wasn’t good for him but it was pointless to deny, at least he could show that man how much he despised him.
She was still pouting, though. They turned on the lights and Dean smiled, the inside felt a bit homely, it was decorated in a warm and sober style, a bit like their family house.
His mind was better when he left the reverend. He would have to see Dean again today, the man had told him to retrieve him before the same restaurant at 5 pm. Why? He had no idea, but he took Claire with him this time. Mrs Simmons wasn’t here this time and anyway he couldn’t always get her to be babysitted. He wasn’t sure to remember where the restaurant was, but he remembered it wasn’t far from the Winchester Tower. Once he found it, he didn’t see Dean anywhere. Was he wrong? No, it was that place, he was sure Dean was just making him wait just to bully him a bit. It didn’t matter, he sat on a bench with his daughter and read her a little book he took along to make sure she wouldn’t be bored.
“We were just playing in a park, I told my dad I could watch Sam on my own, it wasn’t the first time. Then, as we were walking back home, that car stopped at our level, two guys got out and forced us to come inside. I…I didn’t have the time to react, barely had the time to scream, and neither did Sam, no one had the time to do anything, they just took us and drove away.”
Yeah, he should have expected that. They had that agreement since two days only, and Castiel didn’t feel the same desire he did. Still, it hurt to have him here and not be able to just touch him and embrace him!
Dean snorted and looked deeply at him, almost forgetting his anger for a moment. This guy was either totally unconscious or desperate, he wasn’t sure. Now, it was actually not that stupid to ask for a small price, he probably thought Dean would comply more easily. But anyone would have been tempted to ask for money…
“Well, I’d guessed a bit of intimidation would convince you, I didn’t think you would actually attack them, I thought you would simply follow.”
She bit her lip and shrugged. “Then maybe you could come here more often. It’s not idealistic with therapy, but it would help a lot, and that way you would see us and little Malory often when she’ll be born. And maybe Jonathan if we have one, I wish so.”
Even though he had apparently fight off two of his henchmen, Dean wasn’t scared of the teacher; hell he almost wished he would attack him, it would be a good occasion to kick his ass. He knew how to fight as well, and he had already been in danger. Castiel turned to him again, still shocked after what happened. Dean looked at his open lip and brushed it with his thumb. Castiel brutally jerked his head back, it didn’t hurt, but the gesture was so out of place! Gently rubbing the stain of blood off of his finger, Dean looked at him.
“The Chariot, mostly symbolizes changes and freedom, the danger those can represent or the need for it. It can also point out how you got the reins of your life, or how you don’t.”
“Listen, I’m pretty sure this would have happened one moment or another. Maybe it’s better that he learned now, imagine how it would have been if he had learned later, after months or even years?”
“And as a good father you came to congratulate me, didn’t you?” Castiel’s voice was dripping sarcasm.
“Well, it did go well. It’s funny when I think about it: you can handle an entire class of students but not this?”
At this, Castiel pulled himself away from Dean’s hold, and seized his father by the collar brutally, surprising the old man: “YOU’RE NOT TOUCHING MY DAUGHTER! HEAR ME?!”
Okay, the thing about Ellen will be more expalined in the future. Don't hesitate to tell me what you think, thank you!
“They said they absolutely wanted your spot and that John Winchester’s son was the one who forced you to sell, using threats and all. What really happened?”
Now that wasn’t what Castiel expected. He rolled his eyes: “Okay, let’s admit, you’re not a perv’. I still don’t want you around my daughter.”
“Right now, I don’t know much about Crowley’ business, you probably know much more than I do. I know he has links with the Church of Hope, but that’s all.”
Obviously Castiel was still sleeping, he was breathing normally, and his body was completely relaxed against his. It wasn’t the first time he had someone in bed, but he would rarely hug them. It was like the time he had held him, but this time there was no tension at all. H found himself wishing this would happen more often, when Castiel would be sleeping or awake.
“I did. I don’t want her to ever learn. There are a few things she will never know, and not just about us,” he looked down, a bit thoughtful and for the first time in hours, Dean almost forgot his own feelings. “But parents always keep some secrets from children, and that’s maybe better sometimes and easier. You know it would have put something between you and your brother.”
“I guessed it was much better for him to pretend Dean Winchester took me down before they could, rather than admit I screwed him over by selling to another he couldn’t reach.”
“Oh, the local psychiatric hospital. I would like to be more independent but nothing says I will have enough patients.”
Not only that wish was granted but he also got an ice-cream once they returned to the beach and she looked like nothing could have made her happier than to have vanilla all over her mouth and chin. At his surprise, she had asked Dean to carry her on their way to the beach. He had accepted of course, he just wasn’t expecting the little girl to ask such a thing, Castiel didn’t seem that astonished though.
She gaped at this. Hearing about the marriage thing had stunned her already but now it was just icing on the cake! That meant she would be a mother all of sudden? She started to tremble, and looked everywhere, as if she was searching for an answer.
“Dean?” He turned to her, they were alone in the corridor, but he knew by her face that she wanted them to speak alone. They got into an empty office and she bit her lip.
“Really? I noticed the two of you have bruises, Dean told me someone attempted to mug you, is it true?”
“Among all of us who had long hair he was the only one keeping his short, he said he didn’t like to have long hair coming in his eyes,” she told him.
The thought he had in the club the first time he saw him resonated in his head: How did that guy got in here?
“I’m an English Teacher, remember? I do enjoy words, those can have a power a shark like you shouldn’t underestimate.”
“Yeah, we thought of it, but then that cat came and decided this was his house. We didn’t seek him, he just decided he would live here from now on.”
Cooking together seemed to become a habit, and honestly, Castiel liked it: cooking with Dean wasn’t bad, in fact it was quite fun, he bet people would hardly imagine someone like the head of the Winchester company doing something such an ordinary thing. But it seemed he liked it, in fact, it was him who suggested that once, and they had done it again several times. Things had been awkward before, one of the reason was that they didn’t really know what to do together, except argue or take care of Claire. They would still argue from time to time and take care of Claire, but doing some things together made things feel more natural.
“Well I thought that if we do agree on some things, this situation could be good for you and your daughter in the end. As part of the Winchester family, she will have everything she needs. You’ll be able to send her to the best schools, even if you divorce me I engage myself to pay for her studies.”
“Yeah, that’s pretty much it. He valued hard work, he had to do a lot to build what he did, and he didn’t want us to become lazy.”
It was true Dean was also starting to think about it, at leas thaving a secondary place, where he would be able to visit his brother and Jess and enjoy that surrounding.
Indeed, the little girl was soon awake. Her dad went in the gardens with her after a quick breakfast, while Dean was already greeting some people. He knew he wouldn’t get to spend much time with her, but Jo and Charlie had promised they would watch over her while they would be busy. He found the two women talking together while looking at the sea, Claire was chasing a butterfly, the lovers didn’t even notice them and Cas’ heard what they were saying.
“It’s in the past, and it should stay there. I guess that makes you understand why there won’t be any one of my family during the wedding, except for Claire.”
Castiel looked at him this time. “She is not coming into your house, never! This is the last time you see her!”
“The cops knew kids had been kidnapped of course, my father wasn’t supposed to tell them about the ransom thing, but he did otherwise. He was perfectly sure they wouldn’t let us live even if he cooperated. He was right, it was even worse than he thought.”
Castiel smiled in nostalgia. “She, and some of her friends who took liking on me, taught me to fight. Do you imagine that at twelve, I started to sneak away from my religious father to work at an infamous bar to repay her and see clandestine fights?”
Anna doubted he would. If his best option was his ex-boss, then it meant there was really no one for that little girl. She looked at Claire who was just drawing, lying on the living room’s carpet a few feet away. She imagined having her every days. It could be a great thing to have a child, when she thought about it, but would she be a good mother? And how would she handle that situation? She wouldn’t just have to take care of a child, but hide her from someone powerful. Would she be able to do that?
Castiel rolled his eyes, though he wished he could run away with his girl at the other side of the country but distance wasn’t much a problem for men like Winchester. “I’m not running, don’t be paranoid. I’m just taking her to the babysitter. In case you don’t know it’s not wise to leave a small child alone, so I’ve prepared her stuff. That’s all.”
“I’ll join him, I guess I left him hanging for too long. Don’t overwork yourself, I don’t want my best tech to vanish.”
He took a big breath. Dean really wanted to hug him, but he had the feeling he shouldn’t do it, that he should let him talk and empty his bag.
Castiel observed the whole scene, it was true Dean wasn’t bad with children, but now he had taken care of his little brother. He eventually put her to bed when she showed signs of exhaustion. By the time he came, he understood Dean was taking a shower. The man eventually came back, in plain clothes, his hair wet. It kinda reminded Cas’ of the time at the beach and in that quiet atmosphere, without any child, he felt some kind of warmth. Even the dogs were sleeping in their corner, they were really on their own.
Dean shook his head. “Not at all. In fact it’s something Justice knows about, it’s not about something I did.”
“But I…I got Sam away from his grip, the fact he was struggling like crazy helped, and we ran out of the room. We didn’t make it to the front door, someone was in our way. Before they caught us back, we reached the bathroom, thank god, and we locked ourselves inside. I opened the window and we yelled like crazy for someone to help us.”
And now Dean will have a lot more to worry about! If you wonder, no, Cas’ isn’t in love (yet?) with Dean, but he is starting to feel attracted to him. Don’t hesitate to review!
That was Dean’s first question that morning. Castiel was preparing breakfast for the three of them, Claire was waiting for it eagerly while playing on the carpet with her toys. He had seen Dean was depressed when he came to join the in the living room. At the tone of his voice, he could hear how worried he was.
As h was about to finally sleep, he heard his door open. It made him jolt up, wondering who the hell could be entering his room, when he distinguished his future husband’s figure.
“Fine. I think I would have approached you,” he leaned slightly closer, and their knees brushed. “I would have started dancing with you, making eye contact, just like you’re doing right now…Then, I would have started touching you, nothing much, small and brief. I would have slowly increased it, maybe made small talk, and…well…How would you have reacted? It’s important after all, to be attentive to the reactions you get.”
“Well, it wasn’t easy, but I had to go on, I wanted to become a teacher to have a respectable life. When Anna gave me a chance, it was a relief.”
Once he was back home, Castiel listened again to the conversation which he recorded on his phone. It was clear enough, and if that was broadcasted, Dean Winchester would have problems.
Taking a deep breath, Castiel hoped she would accept. “I came for that. Dean Winchester doesn’t know about her yet, I don’t want him to discover she exists. I need her to stay with someone I trust, and...You’re probably the best choice I have.”
She stopped here and looked at him. “All those cards have a positive and a negative side, none are better or lesser. With what I told you, try to make your own explanation. There are many ways in which those cards could relate to you, but you’re gonna give me your own interpretation, there are no bad answers, it doesn’t even have to fit completely with what I said.”
He had spent the whole day searching for another place to work in. Of course, he sent his application to every school nearby, but he knew it wouldn’t be easy. He also sent it for many other jobs, and hoped he would get a response soon. He also has also one way to gain more money, not a very respectable one, but it would still do for now. He had also spent time with Claire, taking the young child to the park, he decided they would go to the beach tomorrow. After all, he just managed to get a big weight and threat off of his shoulders, he could allow himself some good time with Claire.
I knew I said there would be some action in that one, but it's actually gonna be in the next chapter, I fianlly had to change its structure.
A cold shiver ran through Castiel. Loving? “Yeah, about that…What…How do you…” The man took a deep breath. “About physical contacts. I don’t want to get intimate with you, I’d rather tell you right away.”
Castiel didn’t answer but his expression spoke and his future husband surely liked this answer. He breathed in deeply before releasing a sigh.
Right after breakfast, before he could check his mails, Dean received a phone call from Charlie. The day after the mugging attempt, he had sent her a message to ask her to keep an eye on Arthur Miller’s mails, he had to know who he was working with. She had installed a virus on his computer and whatever mails he received, she could read, and she also had access to his texts. He answered her calls immediately.
He leaned toward him and Castiel jumped away from the seat and from him. He stood up and turned his back to Dean, hands before his mouth, trying to breath. This was a nightmare, and it couldn’t be any more ludicrous! Marriage?
“Well, not just you, though you are a burden for those to eye-candies over here. I’m just saying that nobody will get interested in a miserable school like yours. This is a friendly advice, you should give a bit more of your person, though it seems like the little miss over here already started,” he said while looking at Lexie.
The little girl just nodded, looking at him while playing shy. Her father kissed the top of her head and asked: “Where are we going?”
He was going to see them again…Was Jessica still angry at him? How would it go with Castiel? He would know soon.
They laughed together at this. Dick Roman was indeed worthy of that name, but Dean still had to deal with him. He found the guy sitting at one table and looking at the dancers, eying one in particular. He took his attention away as Dean approached and stood up to shake hands with him.
“He is used to it anyway, and Crowley had no one with him. If he wanted to try something, he would have had bodyguards, at least…Isn’t ?” Charlie added, trying to comfort herself as much as the others.
“You see, your school might get something after all. You know, you could actually follow her example, some old ladies around might actually find you attractive enough. And after all, you’re probably cheaper than the usual…”
“She had to go to take care of something, she’ll be here soon,” Benny replied. “Come on, take a seat, the two of you.”
He prayed next to the little bed, he prayed God that she would be safe, that nothing would happen to her. He asked for forgiveness for endangering her, for his pride.
He showed her a room with light green walls, which was a bit smaller but comfortable. “That’s one will be for your daughter.”
He was proud as he looked around, and a bit sad too. Proud because that place had degraded, a bad management almost sent it bankrupt, and Dean had bought it in time to get it back on trails. Now it was rising again, and it was starting to be a high-ranking club again. But he was also a bit sad because the place had lost some of its charm. Before, there was something truly warm in the club, it would make you feel happy. He had brought Sam here when he had been old enough, he remembered his shy little brother nervous and excited to get in…
“Take it as a show of good friendship. Something is going on, I can smell it, and I simply think you’re the right side to bet on. I simply hope you’ll remember I am the one to trust.”
Ah yeah, thank God he didn’t make much noises. He looked at his phone, and smiled: “Seems like our conference had its success. Tweets and articles.”
“Of course it is. It’s a relationship we kept secret and away from the media, my partner isn’t the kind of person who wants to be exposed. But the recent events made him change his mind about that, and this will be the occasion to introduce him to you all.”
“You never really know what to expect from people. I do believe they like me, but they don’t care that much.”
No employee would have dared to go that far, and he could have told Charlie to mind her business, remind her he was still her boss. But there were times they weren’t in that work-related dynamic anymore. Anyway, he wanted to talk, he needed to.
“Thank God we moved to New York, and I met Reverend Lowry. One day, I told him about it, how praying couldn’t help me about this. It’s him who told me what was really happening to me, and who explained me I had to keep calm during those, that I had to remember it was only my mind, and it worked.”
Eating outside was one of Dean’s habit, it often allowed him to freshen up his mind, and he wanted to take time to think before making any statement, he couldn’t miss that one. He usually liked that streets, it was full of men and women fussing around, dressed elegantly and talking on phone, or carrying important things, half-running through the streets some wouldn’t even take the time to sit to eat. To some people, it was probably a stressful atmosphere, but to him, it was actually exciting. It was buzzing with life, energy, so much was happening at once it was almost overwhelming. He loved being part of that, of that constant challenge. But today, what just happened stopped him from enjoying it entirely. He would just grab something to eat and go back to his office…
It wasn’t impossible, Castiel hardly knew that man, and he had no reason to trust him. But there was something else beneath it, and the reverend knew the young dad was a bit lost at protecting his daughter, probably because his mother had failed to do so, and his father…Well, Castiel’s father protected him the wrong way. As for himself he had been a surrogate a few years, that was all.
He just nodded and looked at his daughter who seemed very curious to see her dad trying out clothes. Then her turn came and she was thrilled when she was actually allowed to touch and even wear little dresses. Choosing something for her wasn’t really difficult; she ended up with a little white dress with light green adornments. She cried when she had to take off the dress because they still had to give it a few alterations to fit her.
Once that was done, he left, knowing Claire would be safe with Anna. Now, the only question was how he would deal with Dean Winchester.
Even though her dad was careful, Dean was pretty sure he was as gleeful as his daughter. They settled their stuff and unlike Dean, Castiel kept his tee-shirt, and he was about to ask him why when he remembered the scars on his back. It was understandable. He had wished to see his shirtless, though, but he was still handsome.
“Yeah,” Dean simply answered, sitting and showing he wasn’t about to help. He already had a bad night! But he wondered what the hell happened earlier. Though he didn’t help Castiel prepare breakfast, he watched that the little girl wouldn’t make a mess. It reminded him of Sam, when they were little he would often take care of him.
“Yes, it really happened like that. He doesn’t beat me, and don’t worry, I could handle him. I don’t know which one of us would win, but your brother wouldn’t have an easy fight.”
“Yeah, I remember that! It’s good, kiddo, I knew you would find something to do. So, you’re really gonna marry my daughter’s boss?”
“But there is probably not many ways to interpret that. I mean, it cannot have that many significations.”
“It’s not you who gave that order, if they have a bit of brain, they know it. I was quite mad at them, I don’t like to see you with bruises either,” he finished on a soft tone.
“Sure.” But would Castiel even care? He thought over it, and it would actually be a good thing to introduce him to Marc, and to his friends.
“How?” His voice was coarse, even though he maintained Dean’s gaze. He had no doubts that guy could kill him indeed and get away with murder, whatever he had in store for him, Castiel would have to consider it seriously.
“That place was made for a family. There isn’t any in this house, not anymore,” Dean stated with some bitterness before going back inside.
Castiel nodded, checking out that Claire wasn’t listening to them. She would have been too young to understand anyway, but he still didn’t want her to feel confused. Lowry took another sip of tea and smiled.
A short silence followed and then Dean remembered something he noticed: “You worked in the garden again, I saw.”
Advancing toward him, his future husband stared at him, there was something almost angelic in his appearance, melancholic and almost out of reality. He slowed stepped behind him and felt an impulse to touch him, to just. He thought of the way he was dancing the first time he had seen him, he had looked out of the world too, and he had been incredibly sensual too.
“Well, let’s say, we didn’t want to attract much attention,” Dean simply explained, looking fondly at Castiel. The latest blushed and decided it was better to get over it.
Castiel frowned, taken aback by that reaction, he surely didn’t expect Dean to be angry because he took care of a part of the house. “You didn’t say I couldn’t. Why is it so much of a bother?”
Their awkward moves grew confident as the lust in each other eyes grew, they basked in that eagerness, in the kisses and the touch, loosing track of time and feeling either limp or burning with energy. They broke another kiss and Dean smiled.
“On that we agree,” Mrs Simmons added, going next to Dean, as some more people danced. “Come on, you’re taking my two sweethearts away to Greenwich Village, you owe me a dance.”
They spoke mostly about sports before leaving the restaurant and going to the beach. This time, Jess suggested to go to a small and relatively unknown beach, where they could be in peace.
“Nothing guarantees that, abusers can pass for nice people easily, I know something about it. And even if you don’t, you could only be a bad influence for her.”
. Castiel said goodbye to his friends and went to fetch Claire. The child was sleeping already, she didn’t even bother to open her eyes when her father scooped her in his arms and crossed the street along with his future husband. They got in and Dean looked around. It was modest, sure, but not bad. There were a lot of books, not expensive at all and old for most, the TV was small, the couch was a bit worn out, but otherwise he had to admit that it was not bad. More importantly it was clean.
Without a word, Castiel left, and a nagging sensation crept through Dean. People would usually obey him, from anyone else, he would have been confident that his orders would be obeyed. But with his stubborn fiance, he couldn’t tell.
Castiel nodded. “I heard, but I couldn’t answer.” His voice was coarser than usual, and he stood to take his daughter’s hand. They went in the kitchen and Dean watched Castiel prepare her corn flakes and orange juice. “You drink coffee in the morning?”
Unknowingly to him, Castiel was agape, because he had also recognized Crowley’s voice, and he wasn’t expecting to see someone from his past. Was he here for him? Would Crowley speak to Dean?
It wasn’t that close, but he guessed that for Dean, it was only in a few weeks as he said. “It’s more than a month. If we can prepare your marriage in a few days.”
Castiel didn’t turn away from the window and didn’t say anything, just shrugged. This time, he was weirdly curious to see what would happen. Dean passed his arms around him, and pressed his future husband’s back against his chest and put his chin on Cas’s shoulder. He closed his eyes and allowed himself to bask in that moment, to know he was holding him, pressing his body against his own. There was nothing sexual, and he didn’t want that to change for now. He enjoyed the simple hug, even if he doubted Castiel did.
Smiling, he hoped that meant the unknown man wasn’t into females. But weirdly enough, it didn’t seem to be like that. He seemed into his own world, and it just made him stand out even more in that crowd. Dean ordered himself a drink and allowed himself to silently watch the man. What was his name? Well, there was only one way to find out.
He would have been less shocked if Dean had punched him, seeing his phone destroyed was nothing compared to that. A cold shiver ran through him as he heard those words and saw the man’s look over him.
He extended his hands and let those slid on Castiel’s waist and started to embrace him by behind. As he was about to press them together, his future husband tore himself almost roughly out of his arms.
“Hey, honey,” he said with a mischievous smile. “I’m gonna do some of my work from home, so we can see each other.”
“It’s really frustrating and scary, isn’t it? Not to know what’s gonna happen, not to know whether or not you’ll get out of this?”
Both Sam and Jess laughed at this but Dean bit his lip, though he was still smiling. Now that he remembered that, his reaction might have been petty. Yeah, Castiel hadn’t been a peach, but he was drunk, he had also been quite a jerk while being drunk in the past.
“Well…I…I must admit it wasn’t only to piss off my father, I kinda wanted to thank you. For what you did.”
A sudden move from the plane startled him and he tensed, not thinking about all this anymore. The little girl growled slightly, kinda sounding like a kitten. Castiel looked at Dean once more and waited a bit.
“I did it when I was asleep, I wasn’t even aware! I told you I wouldn’t do anything to you without your consent.”
“I’m an English Teacher. You always said I was quite an egg-head, well I decided this was the best job for me.”
After a short hesitation, Castiel just shrugged. “Well, I knew Ellen and Jo, and one day, I learned Ellen was selling and moving away from New York. She didn’t tell me why, but I heard rumors.”
“I hate those guys,” Marc finally said. “I know Dean had to trade with them a bit, but I hate them.”
Dean could have laughed at the man’s reaction, he was looking at everything like a child would have, if his clothes couldn’t betray him, then his attitude would; But he didn’t care. That man was with him and people would have to bear with it. Once they were seated the almost naïve look disappeared and the angry, wary expression he was starting to know by heart. There were many people around, yet their table was near the rail, somewhere where they wouldn’t be too crowded. It was better in order not to be heard, there was enough noises to cover their conversation yet no one too close to hear.
“Well, the judgment, I guess that was my lack of judgment when I did that to Castiel…And now the judgment other people will have of me, Sam especially. I did something wrong, and I exposed myself to that...” Taking a deep breath, he went on. “The chariot is how I need changes in my life, and the fool is me, how I…” He wasn’t even looking at Jessica anymore, just at the cards. “Sometimes even though I have my career on the right rails, I do feel lost. Like, I don’t know what else I live for. It’s like I was…Searching for something and I don’t even know what. The Empress, well, I don’t really know, maybe my mother and the fact I miss her, or if you say it has a bad side, maybe it could be Veronica Vanni, the one who kinda wrecked me and our family at a point.”
Lust rose through him like never and he pushed himself off the wall, and almost threw his future husband on the bed. Castiel hardly had time to regain his breath when Dean was on him, pinning his arms down and kissing him greedily, grinding his hips against him. Castiel’s breath itched as they broke the kiss.
“What does he want? I mean, I would have got it if he asked to apologize, even get on my knees, but why punish everyone?”
Eventually, Castiel told other people they would leave before inviting Dean to the kitchen where no one was around. “You want some times alone with me?” he maliciously asked.
“Maybe some of them does,” she replied, “but I bet some other wonder how they can get their way with you.”
The atmosphere in the room was heavy right now. Dean and Castiel both took a deep breath as they looked at each other’s eyes. Tightening their fist and getting into fighting stance, they braced themselves.
On one hand he could have told him this was a private conversation, on the other hand, he really looked like he was suffering. He crossed his arms on his chest.
When he came back, he saw Castiel and Mrs Tidler walking through the living room, and while she smiled to him, his future husband seemed surprised.
Cas’ gave no answer, some time ago, that would have astonished him, but after what happened... Dean sighed and bit his lip: “Okay. I know that forcing you to accept a proposal was wrong.” Castiel nodded in response. “I sincerely regret. I didn’t need to take things that far, I guess I was really going on a wrong path, even before meeting you.”
Dean rolled his eyes but had to admit it wasn’t untrue. Now he thought of everything that happened, the way Castiel got away from him the first night he saw him, looked at him with such distaste…
Dean approached and saw with relief that he was breathing. But why the hell was he completely still? He looked at Dean in a strange way but made no move at all. “Hey, what are you doing?”
Maybe Ellen would take her, but he hadn’t seen her in years, not since she left. He didn’t even know what happened to her, if she was alive or not. Anna? Maybe, but that was still close, what if Dean discovered? But on the other hand, he would be able to visit his little girl that way. And after all, if Dean had his hands full with him and his business, he would probably give Anna no attention. That was maybe the best option, Anna was single for now, she loved children and she had always been fond of Claire. But that didn’t meant she would accept.
Fuck! He gotta be kidding! Castiel in that kind of place? On the other hand, he did fight off his three men, and one of them admitted they only got him because they threatened him with a gun. Yet…Fuck, this seemed completely unlike him to go and fight among that kind of people! Charlie was definitely right, he had to know more about him. He left the wary Crowley here and immediately went back to retrieve them. He found the five of talking together and there was an older woman with them, whose face looked vaguely familiar. As he approached, he suddenly remembered her.
“Yep, he does work out and it’s efficient,” Jess commented with a little wink at her husband which made him giggle a bit and distracting him from his previous thoughts.
Even his few friends, they worked for him and therefore would always be careful around him, Jo, Marc, Charlie…Dear God, he really felt lonely. There was no one he could talk to freely.
Well, not that much, but he hadn’t much to do this evening, so he might as well work on his mundane relationships. He wasn’t very interested in spending time with Bela, her mother and some other people were the real deal. So he put on his suit, not a tuxedo, but a dark blue suit he always liked. He picked up Bela as he was supposed to, gave her black dress an empty praise and went with her.
“It was sometimes after my father’s death,” Dean added. “In a club, I was really down, and Castiel helped me a lot.”
He did phone Father Lowry explaining him he would marry and though the old reverend wanted to attend, it wouldn’t be possible for him. Then he called Anna, Lexie and Zack, asking them to meet him for lunch. Anna perfectly understood what was going on, of course, and she promised Castiel she would make her best to come so he would have support. But Zack and Lexie really were confused and angry.
Was that the reason why he forced him to get engaged? Because he was alone? He followed him back inside as Dean showed him the kitchen, his office, the dining room and the second bathroom. Then he lead him upstairs and showed him around again.
Truth to be told, Dean didn’t like to deal with the mob; he knew damn well that those were dangerous water. Yet no high business in this city could really escape it. You had to find the delicate balance between dealing with them without getting too close. His father had always warned him that it was just like a fire in a cold night. If you stay far away from it, you’ll die from the cld. Get too close and you get burned.
“So, what are you gonna do now? What’s gonna happen?” Anna asked that without even knowing what she was precisely thinking of.
Sorry for the time it took, really, now I hope you'll like it, I must say I'm fond of the last part ^^
“If you’re talking about what I think, I can reassure you right away: he didn’t force me to have sex.”
She really was obvious, that was her problem, he could almost see her brain scheming. Maybe someone more naïve and less experienced would have been fooled, but Dean had seen many women and men like her, the way she acted, smiled and talk…They were all the same, fake and acting, some with more skills than others. But now, that was the counterpart of being rich: you had to deal with that kind of people. But well, he also had interests in that, her family and especially her mother were influent and it wouldn’t be bad to keep good relationship. If she wanted to play the scheming seductress, fine with him, he could also play that game, he wasn’t a stranger to it.
“He did, but I wasn’t really cooperative, I wouldn’t talk much to the doctor, I wasn’t comfortable with him. I couldn’t trust him. It worked better for Sam.”
In the house, Dean was focusing as much as he could on work, he had a lot to do and that was for the best. His mind went back again and again to Sam, and it felt horribly painful, even though he was alone he had the impression to have hundreds of eyes watching him and glaring in despise. He almost wished Castiel and Claire to be back. They hadn’t spoken again of Sam at noon, they had mostly focused on Claire, Cas’ had just asked whether or not he was feeling fine. Dean had kept a strong front as usual. But he wasn’t fine, not at all. He wanted to continue to drown in work and to throw everything away at the same time.
The child looked enchanted by her dad’s voice, and Dean found himself hoping the song would last long.
Cas’ slowly took off his jean jacket while standing up, letting it trail down slowly from his shoulder and letting it fall on the armchair. Dean couldn’t help feel a bit dizzy at this. Cas’ slowly walked to sit at his side, not close enough to touch, though. It became quite clear what he was doing, and Dean knew how to play that game.
“Because my daughter is in the middle. And why aren’t you worse than that? Not that you’ve been a peach most of times, but I imagined worse.”
Dean pushed him outside, and the old man had to grasp the stairs’ rail in order not to fall. “Don’t ever come back.”
“Whatever is happening, try to make it smooth…Claire is getting attached to you, her mother already left her, I don’t want her to feel abandoned again.”
Dean didn’t answer anything, it was painfully true. He closed his eyes, and Cas’ had to admit he never looked so defeated.
“We will leave for California again in some days. To prepare the wedding, and to get away from all this, it will feel good.”
“I’m not that kind. Anyway, this is the house my parents bought when they moved here. The Winchester company was starting to really rise, we weren’t as rich as now, so my parents were proud when they could buy this.”
Looking around, Castiel was quite pleased by the plainness of the décor. It was rich and beautiful but not too much, it was just elegant. The living room had many pictures he noticed, there was a picture of blond woman with two children and he guessed it was Dean’s mother. She looked radiant on the picture, and the two kids so innocent. He guessed the older one was Dean, he looked damn innocent. Who would have thought? It was large but not super huge either and it made him more comfortable. A gigantic place would have been too imposing. He saw a window door leading to an inner courtyard and without even thinking he went to see it.
Ellen snorted and then laughed. “Ha, those sly bastards! No, you really want to know what happened? I was forced to sold, but not by the Winchester. By that fucker, Harvey Connor; you remember him? He was the boss of some mob.”
“The Lover can indicate you’re facing a tough choice between two options, the man on the card her is between two different women. It can also symbolize romantic situations and dilemmas.”
“Jess and I love to come here,” Sam murmured, not wanting Claire to hear. “It’s indeed very intimate.”
“Let’s say I’m feeling a bit nervous before the wedding, I decided we could maybe try to break the tension.”
But then he remembered John did left for cocktails and stuff like that. But now those were related to work. Castiel rolled his eyes: “Babysitters exists. It’s no wonder you got no children.”
Indeed, he was in the technology field, high-tech surveillance systems, computers and phones, and Dick Roman knew how it could be of use. As a casino owner and a mobster, he knew that Dean could give him a lot of information which he could use. They discussed a bit but went in Jo’s office to talk business. No one had to hear what they would say.
As Dean said, Claire was presented to the reporters. She was taken by Dean’s assistant who brought her to her own office, and she would watch her while the two men would speak to the public. Of course Dean was the first to go before the journalists, and Castiel wondered how he could look so confident. Just standing in the back was already too much for him. He started saying that he knew of the rumors that circulated, and assured once again that the man who professed those was getting fired already.
A tap at the door startled him. What was that? Was it Castiel, did h forgot the keys? Was it Sam? That idea scared him as much as it appealed him. He opened the door in anticipation and he was even more surprised. Instead of Castiel or Sam was Jessica, standing here and alone. Jessica? What was she doing here?
H wasn’t much of a good liar, he did his best to be believable. Maybe it worked because neither of them could imagine the truth. It was obvious they were upset, they didn’t think Castiel would have lied, and he died to tell them he never did, to explain what happened. But he didn’t want them to know, he feared they would be exposed. All the grudge and anger he felt toward Dean burned again, his friends were hurt and angry because of him.
“Careful,” Dean growled in a suddenly serious tone. “Don’t ever do something to shame me, got it? That will be part of our deal, since you’ll have the Winchester name, you’ll respect it.”
“Well, I might be a powerful guy, but I’m not the most powerful one either, if I become a problem for them, they will use their power and allies to get rid of me. And that could be in any way possible. I can’t avoid the mafia completely, so if I don’t want them to own shares of the company, I still have to make sure I’m a valuable business partner in their eyes.”
It was a short summary but he could only imagine how scary this was to a kid. “What happened then? Your father took you to shrink?”
“I don’t know how to garden, but Dean never asked anyway. I must say I’m impatient to see how your work will grow!”
Knowing Castiel was waiting for him was quite fun, Dean knew it was immature but there was some malignant enjoyment to imagine him waiting in his office. But now that he was thinking about it, he couldn’t take too long, little Claire couldn’t stay around for too much time. Yet this matter needed to be taken care of.
“I’m not involved with their illegal activities, if that’s what you ask. Honestly, I try to stay away from them as much as possible, but it’s not really easy. Some of them wanted be shareholders of my company, something which I completely refused. However, I do have to make some business deals with them, otherwise, there could be consequences.”
He smiled before getting in, Claire still limp in his arms, snoring very softly. Dean and he quickly found the smaller room for the little girl. As Castiel put her in the bed, he looked at her small form before exiting the room. He could have visited the rest of the house, but he decided to go out instead. He wanted to watch the sea. The house was on the cliff, a wooden barrier around the garden, which was good for Claire’s security. He leaned against it, and just contemplated everything.
Lowry laughed at this. Castiel had told him about it already and he had been glad to hear it. He sighed.
It was painful to admit it, but Dean knew deep down that he was right. Yet there was no way he could admit it, not right now. “And what did you expect? Defying me, that was already foolish, but bringing my brother into this…You did it because you knew it would hurt, didn’t you? You knew that would be my weakness. What did you expect?”
Thankfully for him, Dean and his friends were careful not to leave him for too long, and eventually, he was happy to meet a couple who were Shakespeare enthusiasts and he had with them one of his most interesting conversation of the day. As for Claire, she was happy that other children had come and played along with them, still watched by Jo and Charlie.
“No, I just had someone find your address, may I remind you I send some men to fetch you? Is there something I should find?”
They went in the same college indeed, and though Charlie and he hardly shared only very few common classes, he had noticed the girl, and he had seen she didn’t like him. But when she had asked for a job, he had given it, because he knew she was good at what she did.
“Yeah, a bit.” He gave a little laugh. “It will be my first Honeymoon and travel out of the country. Never thought it would happen like that.” His smile disappeared and he became melancholic again. “I’m going to bed. I hope Claire won’t be lost when she’ll wake up.”
“So what, father? Be ashamed, it’s not my concern, you see…” He took Dean’s hand at the latest astonishment. “We’re getting married very soon, and you won’t be the one to change that.”
He remembered with relief that Dean had promised he would have his own room. It was a guest room, and Dean told him they called it the blue room. He could understand why, the walls were painted in light blue, curtains and the carpet were on a deeper blue, contrasting beautifully with the wooden floor. It was strangely warm even though it was in cold color. The furniture were either natural wood or white, looking pretty modern. Just like the rest of the house, it was plain, and the queen sized bed looked really inviting. He had a pretty exhausting day, and he could have been tempted to take a nap if worry wasn’t nagging him still.
In a flash, images of Sam came into his mind. He might not have been his father, but he had half-raised him. Once again, he felt angry at Castiel, no one dared to talk like that to him!
On the travel back, Castiel could hardly express his shame. Not for insulting that rich ass, in fact he couldn’t help but feel proud at this. No, he was ashamed for doing that to Anna and the rest of the school. Sure, he had been angry at her at first for her lack of pride, but if she had decided to shut up for the sake of her and everyone’s future, he shouldn’t have jeopardized that. What would Lexie say? He hoped Harold Cavanaugh would be nicer toward her.
Their attention was called and they saw three men advancing toward them. They stopped walking, any sensation of tiredness fading away. It reminded Castiel of the night he had faced Dean’s lackey, the way they were looking at them was all the same. But this time those guys were thugs, and Dean was obviously not their boss.
Usually, he would have simply picked up someone else, and got them home, but here he just wanted to find that guy. Did he really moved away just to get away from him? He had never seen him before, why would he do that?
He returned home in a hurry. Anna was still here, she suggested she would make one first travel to her home with some of the stuff alone while Castiel would bring her to the baby sitter, then he would come again and take some more stuff before retrieving her home. He accepted, they would lose less time. He loaded her car with her and she left. Then, he prepared a bag with some of Claire’s stuff for her afternoon with Mrs Simmons in a hurry; after all, there wasn’t so much time left.
The ride wasn’t that long, thank God he didn’t get much traffic. He found the house without much difficulty, and once he got out of the car, he heard loud sounds of music. A party was taking place in a house on the other side of the street, he could see people at the windows holding beers and all. Some noticed Dean’s car, but he didn’t care. He went to Castiel’s door and tapped.
Someone suddenly tapped at the door. They were both startled, Castiel put Claire in Anna’s arms and they went to hide in the bathroom while he went to the door carefully, thinking that maybe it was Dean, standing her and who would see his little girl. When he opened, he saw a young man he didn’t know.
“Guess what Damian did yesterday? Well? You can see on Youtube,” he announced while showing him his phone.
He turned away, and heard the head-mistress ranting at the teacher. He was mad, but when he saw Bela smiling to him, he felt disgusted. Her fake, stupid smile made him want to get out, to just leave that fucking place.
“Wondering why a guy like me would marry someone like you? I admit it’s surprising I could do much better. But I have every interest in that.” He trailed slowly while looking at Castiel up and down. “It’s very simple: I don’t need to marry for money, but for my reputation. Marrying a man would shut up every stupid comment about my company being a nest of homophobic assholes, and as a plus marrying a poorer one would give a good image of me to the public. Of course, I could try to seduce some guy, it wouldn’t be that hard, but it would still take time. Why loose time when I have a very attractive option available right now?”
“Well, I guess I would have discovered whether you like sweet or rough…” They were so close Dean started to lean for a kiss, but Castiel backed away, his cheeks growing warm. “For now, I think I’d better get to bed now. It’s better if I sleep alone.”
Castiel’s eyes widened a bit, then he huffed and gave Dean a glare. “Technically, we do,” he whispered. “And I also want to remind those two women looking at you that you’re not single.”
“If I was to take care of you, I would treat you exactly the same way you treated me, and I can guarantee you wouldn’t like it!”
“That what I really didn’t want at first: having my daughter in the middle of this. But he has been kinder to her than I expected, and she loves his house, his dogs and I think she is starting to like him too. Anyway, it won’t be forever, we agreed I just have to stay with him for some times, I can eventually divorce if I want. So don’t worry too much.”
Something dawned on Dean as they both drank some water. He looked at Castiel hesitantly. “Tell me: did you ever use
“There is a barbecue in the house,” Castiel told them. “We could always use it, the night will surely be beautiful.”
She took her deck of tarot cards from her bag, and he was quite surprised at this. He remembered she had talk about it once, but what was that for? She started to mix her cards.
“It’s okay, you couldn’t have known and I should have held my tongue too. I’ll go and meet him, I’ll try to fix it.”
Yet…Seeing him push his father out like this, it had been pretty satisfying too. Honestly, he could have done it, he did in the past. When his father had learned about Claire’s birth, he had came to visit her, demanding to see his grand-daughter, but Castiel hadn’t allowed him to get near. He hadn’t seen him after, moving into another part of the Queens for that. He knew he could protect his girl from him, yet thinking someone else was here to make sure nothing would happen…
It was quite unusual for him to wake up that early, maybe it was sleeping next to Castiel, or because so much was happening. He wasn’t alone for long, though; Claire woke up a few minutes later and called for her dad, who immediately went to her. They were all together eating breakfast with Jasper and Sasquatch both laid at their feet, their eyes pleading for some food. Dean instructed Claire not to give him anything, explaining it was a bad habit. Then he looked at Castiel, wondering how he was feeling.
“Well, you did speak the truth: that guy could have been raised by apes. I don’t think we would have obtained anything anyway.”
“I’m so happy for you, my dear! I guess I won’t see you much anymore after the marriage, I will miss you and little Claire.”
“No!” Castiel exclaimed hurriedly. “No, we’re not going there, Mr Winchester is just joking. We can’t go there.”
“I have a booboo,” she said in the sorrowful little voice she would use whenever she wanted to be pitied. She showed him a scratch she got that morning on her knee when she stumbled while walking. Her dad petted her hair: “And you didn’t cry, that was good.”
“She is not some kind of butler. She cleans and cooks something for me to warm up the evening, and then she leaves. I’ll also ask her to prepare this room.”
One of the first things Castiel did that morning was to know where the closest local swimming pool was. He decided to take Claire there as soon as Dean left. Dean had left a set of keys for him, which was definitely welcome.
“Should I be jealous?” Castiel asked on a joking tone. This made her giggle, and she shook her head.
“Well…The way you were dressed first, everyone noticed, we had never seen a guy looking so…Not-rich in that club.” This made Cas grin a bit. “There is also your look, you got a freaking handsome face. But what really made it is…the way you danced.”
There were also some people he knew already, and of course those people coming for their school were trying to be as agreeable as possible. Bela was at his arm, she was talking about some gossips. That was probably one of the few advantages of being round her: he could at least learn some interesting things which could be used later. Suddenly, his eyes saw a familiar face and he almost gaped.
“Well, that’s it. You wake up, you’re paralyzed, it can last a few seconds or some minutes.…Being touched by someone can help you go back to normal.”
“When we go to the sea?” Claire asked that, interrupting his thoughts. He was preparing her dinner, she was in her high-chair, swinging her feet.
“You should have left him in peace once it was deleted! Don’t give me the ‘I had to play tough’ speech, you played way tougher than necessary, you could have left him in peace, he had asked for nothing else! Someone really confident and important wouldn’t have cared that much about it! You thought you were showing power, you just showed weakness! And you went way too far!”
Dean was quite annoyed but after all they could handle it. “Fine. Hey, kiddo, you’re coming with us today?”
As he reached the entrance, Dean frowned when he saw an old man facing his future husband. The door had been closed, probably because Castiel didn’t want the neighbors to hear. He had no idea who he was, but he was dressed very plainly, he even stunk a bit. He looked quite sick, though his frame was still broad, he had probably been very strong in his youth. Sickness and age had altered him, yet if a look could kill Dean would have died immediately as soon as the newcomer noticed him. He wasn’t the kind to be intimidated easily, though, and certainly not by an old man.
They did fell asleep like logs. In the morning, Dean almost broke the clock-alarm when it rung, he growled and looked at Castiel. He saw his husband had his eyes open, breathing steadily.
It was enraging because he knew somehow this was true. They had to appear like a loving couple and actually spending the night at Castiel’s house with people who could witness him leave in the morning was a good show. “You could at least leave me your bed, isn’t it what people do for guests?”
“Good Lord, I almost forgot!” They laughed at that. The reverend would visit him during Christmas, and last time, Castiel had offered him a watch, not very expensive, but still good, and the shiny metal had drawn Claire. When they forbad her to touch it, she had thrown a tantrum like hell, and eventually fell asleep out of exhaustion. It was rare of her to do such things, but when she would, it was something to remember!
It didn’t take long for him to make a statement on Social Network, he and Marc thought over it again and again. In the end, it was written:
This made Castiel’s breathing itch, and he felt weirdly nervous. Fiance…Yeah well, it was true, he was engaged to Dean technically. He took Claire in his arms, not wanting her to wander around and put a mess. A small child like her in such a store was like an elephant in a porcelain shop. The man looked at him and his smile was a bit more frigid.
It didn’t really take long to conclude their new deal. He would have to see someone else, not a mobster this time, simply his advertising agent. They would sometimes talk business around a drink, to change from the office’s atmosphere. He still wasn’t here, though, and he’d better have a good explanation! Didn’t matter much however, Dean could still enjoy a drink, and maybe get some companion for the night. He didn’t want to stay alone tonight. In fact, the idea of coming back home to an empty place was making sick recently. He had tried keeping people for longer, men or women, but it never worked. Either he couldn’t get attached, either he realized that they were only here for the money. So he would hardly ever keep anyone for more than a night or two.
“My house is even better, I have two dogs, would you like to come with your dad?” Dean suggested to the girl, actually sounding kind while doing so.
As the man left, Castiel looked at him with confusion. “That guy put his boat on rent on internet, I decided it could be fun to have it for the morning. How about it, kid? You want to sail on that boat?”
The two spoke about Greece, Pacome had only been there at scarce occasions. Castiel sat with another couple of friends, drinking a beer along with them. Claire was playing with Sally and Pacome’s son for now, and he could watch her from where he was. Yet for now he watched as Dean accepted a beer and continued to speak with some people. Others were dancing but Cas’ didn’t feel like joining them for now. As it went on, a Bon Jovi song echoed:
He listened to Matthew Lowry with attention, wondering if he had seen him. The man was getting older, but he still had this charisma and that deep voice and assurance with words. It was something Castiel always tried to learn from him: to be at ease with words, it was him who taught him how powerful discourse could be. His preach was about forgiveness and all the time, while Castiel was holding Claire on his lap, he wondered if he could ever forgive Dean Winchester for everything he did. He would have to live with him for some times, he didn’t even know how long. Could he spend all of it fighting and be angry? Maybe the atmosphere of the church soothed him, but he felt like he didn’t want endless fighting. Yet would he have the choice?
“Oh, I wish I was the one getting married just to try one of those. But then, I probably could never afford it.”
Today, it was more superficial, a bit colder, the warm atmosphere had been smothered by the glitter. But maybe that could change eventually, and at least they still served wonderful drinks!
“Of course…That’s also why I’m happy we agreed on something rather plain. The journalists will probably makes me a bit nervous, and something too big would have worsened it.”
They chattered happily, and when they got to the club, Castiel understood what they meant. It looked like a good place indeed, and the people here were dressed-up more than he was. He had dark jeans, along with a black jacket on a white tee-shirt. Well, maybe it would be alright, it was sober but not neglected. They waited in the queue but thankfully their turn came pretty quickly. As Zach said, the bouncer was indeed his friend and greeted him with enthusiasm. He looked at Castiel up and down and shook his head at first.
“I don’t know, honestly. Maybe it’s a way to avoid the lovers to argue before the wedding, or to make them even more impatient.”
“Yeah, so they can see it. That’s why Cas’ didn’t want to go to Egypt for now, he wanted to discover it with Claire. So we decided to go to Greece.”
His eyes were suddenly filled with that strange melancholic expression of his. Dean put a hand over his. “What’s wrong?”
Dean had told John one day, wondering why instead of defending him like other parents, he would give him double punishment when he would get detention.
He tried to hit Dean’s throat but the man dodged and this time hit him in the side successfully. Cas’ released a gasp and went to punch him again and this time when Dean dodged he kicked the back of his legs again while pushing him with the palm of his hand. Dean fell again and Cas’ grabbed his arm to held him down.
Dean held himself from saying anything, it wasn’t things to discuss before the little girl. He just smiled to her instead: “What’s your name?”
Castiel nodded eagerly. He had taken a few toys for Claire, and she played with it in the office, laying on the carpet while her father and the reverend were talking. Just like Anna, the priest was baffled when Castiel told him what happened. He listened to everything that happened carefully, though.
“Because he had his eyes on other options. So, I’ll try to investigate Crowley, but I’ll keep in mind that it could be bullshit.”
“Not really, I’m not really fond of social networks, I only post things I judge useful, but I keep things private about me as much as I can. I had a lot of one-night stands and I try to be discreet about it.”
Weird…Was that guy really thinking such things about his friends? Well, he wondered what kind of people they were.
“Oh no, you were right. It’s before that, you should have just apologized and let go. You know, if seeing someone bump into his car had so much importance for him, then I can guarantee he is an unhappy person.”
He snorted. “Don’t call me like that, we aren’t a couple. I like to make business with you, but we’re clearly not made for each other. Excuse me, will you?”
"I'm sorry," Dean whispered, burrowing back into Cas' chest. He wasn't even sure what he was sorry for. For the t-shirt? For pushing him away? For not being able to say he loved him back? For making Cas love such a screw-up?
Dean fell smoothly to his knees in front of Cas without a moment's hesitation, looking up at Cas in something that felt very much like rapture, like he was a God to be worshiped. It made Cas want to do all kinds of debauched things to him. And he would—
Dean nodded slowly, not able to look away from where Cas’ mouth was on his skin. The small, not even overtly sexual act seemed obscene when it was Cas doing it to him. He was fairly sure he’d never been this turned on in his life before. He had a single moment of panic, that someone might see them, that Kate might come around the corner, but then his mind emptied.
"I'm well aware of Dean's faults, just like he's aware of mine. He can be the most irritating person on the planet sometimes - all while thinking he's being cute and adorable. We've been friends despite each other's faults for a very long time."
Cas flicked the switch in the bedside lamp. And the room was flooded with light—enough to make Dean blink dazedly while his eyes adjusted. Cas turned onto his back, pushing the covers down below his hips impatiently, not even slightly shy about Dean seeing him like this.
"Fuck," Dean groaned at his words, bucking up against the weight of Cas' body, sliding his hands under the waistband of Cas' pyjama bottoms to palm his ass, wishing he was pulling Cas
"I wouldn't go that far. I knew I'd fucked up the minute I'd ended things with you. I wanted to take it back so fucking much. Sure, she's good at getting me to talk about how I'm feeling, but honestly Cas, you're on my mind so much, I didn't need much of an excuse."
"Not if you don't want to. I might not have known you as a child, Dean, but I know you now and I will protect you from anything that hurts you -
Over Sam’s shoulder, Dean’s eyes met Cas’. He was leaning against the counter, a cup of coffee in his hand and a sympathetic expression on his face. Dean was hit with a moment of complete disbelief that anything could have happened with him last night. It was Cas,
to think you're doing this for Cas. You want to feel like the good guy making the big sacrifice, being the martyr, sacrificing your own happiness for his. But really, you're just shit scared."
"Alright, buddy," he said, putting the food on the table and walking over to the couch, reaching for Cas' hand to pull him up. "You can't eat soup on your knee—you'll end up with third degree burns in places that could really put a wrench in the works for what I have planned for you after the wedding tomorrow."
"There aren't elves in Heaven, Dean," came Cas' confused voice. "They aren’t the most accommodating of creatures - you’d certainly never find one who was willing to perform any sort of clerical work."
A torrent of rain poured from the sky as if someone had just turned a tap. The fat, round drops of water hit the roof of the Impala with a hollow drumming sound, drowning out the purr of the engine. Wide eyed, Dean pulled his arm inside the car and wound up the window, shaking off the drops that had already gathered on his sleeve and started soaking through.
. Because of me and my stupid, selfish, fucked up decisions, he's gone from an Eternity as a freaking Angel, to a few decades as a human being, at most. And now he's not giving up his only chance at the life he deserves just because Chuck has written us as some doomed star-crossed lovers. He doesn't get to ruin Cas' life even more.
Cas put his hand over Dean's where it was pressed against Cas' chest, holding Cas back from him. "Only you would beat yourself up over it. When you're honest from the start, how does that make you a monster?"
"There's no way you're going to Hell. I've made you a house in Heaven, with a Deancave and your own private beach. That's not going to waste."
The sound that Dean made was more of a whimper than a moan, and his mouth replaced his fingers, tasting Cas, stealing his air, kissing him with everything he was feeling.
“You know I’ve got barely any photos of you? I think the last ones I took were when you were dressed all Calamity Jane.”
"I've smited people for far less, Dean. He shouldn't get away with the things he's done. The very fact that he's even
"I have been told that Christmas is a difficult time of year," Cas said, soothingly. "It can make people feel alone when they're not, make us vulnerable to making stupid decisions we might regret."
Leaning over and in an undertone, so that Kate couldn't hear what he was saying, Cas whispered, "You do realise that Claire did all this because she thinks we're hiding a secret relationship and she wants us to feel we can announce it?"
"Then I was seeing this girl for a week or two… Amber, I think her name was? Amy? Annie? Her mom was a real peach—would make us breakfast every morning. I can't remember much else, but I do remember the feel of that crisp French toast between my teeth, and it was nothing like the soggy diner crap you get everywhere.
"Death isn't a rescue, Amara! It's an ending, and he doesn't deserve to have his ending before he's even lived!"
Dean grinned and went down the hallway to the toilet. He was in there for longer than he would normally have been, as he'd had to will his cock to half mast first, and knowing Cas was waiting in his bed for him, it hadn't been the easiest of jobs.
"Look, I'll come join you. I'll have some lovely little tattoos put on my ribs too, and then I'll come meet you. It'll be fun—our first holiday together!"
"When you had your weird little Angel cult, I liked that you had people stationed at the hospital healing people. Just think of all the good Angels could have done if so many of them hadn't been complete dicks."
"Don't you dare," Cas growled, and Dean knew that if they weren't in public, weren't in this room full of Sam and Eileen's guests, Cas would have him pinned to the nearest surface by now. "All the perfect moments we've had together where you could have said them, you are not going to say those words to me because of your father!"
Now close enough to see though the drops of rain, Dean could see Cas properly. He still wore the ill-fitting suit and trench coat that was so achingly familiar to him, but with wings spread out behind him Cas reminded Dean of some giant, powerful bird of prey. The colours on each wing seemed to be moving, dancing across the feathers and changing with the light as they trembled. He'd always thought Cas' feathers would be black, and they were, but now he could see more than just their shadow, he could see that they had a multicoloured sheen, like gasoline on the surface of a puddle. The colours danced and swirled over the surfaces of the feathers as they moved. They looked like they would feel velvety soft and Dean wondered if he could get away with stepping closer and reaching out to touch one, or if the angry Angel in front of him would Smite him where he stood.
“Fuck this,” he growled, reaching up to hook Cas around the waist and tackling him down onto the bed next to him. Cas let out an undignified squeak and a snort of laughter that had Dean grinning down in wry amusement.
Instead he resorted to yanking the t-shirt up, sliding down Dean’s body so that his mouth could brush over Dean's stomach, ghosting over the skin, down to where the line of hair disappeared into the waistband of his boxers, just visible under his jeans.
Dean found his mouth and kissed him, tasting the salt of his tears on his lips. He’d never said it to someone in this way—he didn’t even know if he
Dean shook his head, as if trying to clear water from his ears, and only then did he tear his eyes away from Cas who was steadfastly trying not to look straight at Dean. He had decided to focus on an antique looking dresser in the corner.
Dean had just taken a mouthful of beer, and at that he forgot how to swallow, and choked instead. Beer fizzed up his nose and went down his windpipe. Abandoning the admittedly slightly phallic napkin, Cas crossed to Dean's side of the table, whacking him on the back with a worrying amount of gusto.
"You can claim every other Castiel in every other world out there doesn't love his Dean, but I wouldn't believe you," Cas ground out. "He made me who I am, he taught me what it
Dean sighed heavily, his hands sliding slowly down Cas' arms, until it was just his head resting on Cas' shoulder, with no other contact.
"My point," Chuck snapped, his playful tone hardening, his easygoing smile suddenly replaced with a cruel smirk. "My point is that you're no different from any of the other thousands of Deans out there. You're a clone, a jaded hunter with a death wish, who is in love with a Celestial being who he has no chance of happiness with. You're not unique, your decisions don't mean a single thing!"
"I wonder how Eileen and Kate are doing?" Cas wondered out loud as they settled Gary in place and put him in the recovery position just in case he woke up feeling sick.
As Cas climbed out of the cage and broke through the crowd to get to them, Dean noted that the entirety of Cas' top half was covered in patterns and words, all glowing brightly in pinks, purples, greens and blues under the UV lighting. A large orange and yellow flower had been painted around his belly button and Dean found himself smiling, thinking that it oddly suited him.
A second later Dean was shaking his head, turning away from Cas entirely and leaning against the side with what Cas was sure was a small groan of despair.
The thing Cas didn’t understand was how it had gone so wrong so quickly. Dean didn’t like Kate - he was downright hostile to her sometimes, and at absolute best they tolerated each other for Cas and Eileen's sake. This turn of events was as unexpected as it was unwelcome. It was Kate’s first visit to the Bunker, and after an hour or so of repeatedly assuring her they weren't secret agents or foreign spies (which was ironic considering she was the only one among them without an American accent), Kate had finally calmed down enough to relax and get to know everyone.
