“Dean, stop!”
The uncomplicated normality they’ve slipped back into has Dean grinning with delight. Cas purses his lips against his own smile when Dean places a hand at his waist, leading them to a booth. His gut takes a nosedive in a good and exciting way, like when you’re on a rollercoaster and you can’t wait for the next drop.
“Well…” Castiel puts on a ponderous face, and Dean thinks, un-fucking-believable, “I ordered a milkshake for myself and I assume that…you want to share? I could have just ordered us two. I didn’t know you liked chocolate milkshakes. Are you upset that I only ordered one?”
She glances between Dean and Cas, offering an apologetic smile every time Sam waves a hand and says it’s nice for everyone to be sitting together for once.
They move together gently for a few seconds before Cas pulls away and smacks Dean on his arm, the same place he left his bloody handprint.
“We’re both dumbasses. That’s what makes us so great together!” Dean kicks lightly at Cas’ shoe with his own. “Hey. Can we just—you know you’re the best thing in my life after Sammy. You know I think you’re—that I’d be...well, lost without you. I think a hell many things about you but this is already getting too chick flick moment-y so let’s...you know...forgive dumbass Dean? For all of this?”
“C’mon, Cas. Five minutes ago you were telling me how great I was and professing your big gay love for me with tears in your eyes. You can’t really be that fickle.”
Cas lets out an almost two-decade old breath of yearning. “God, yes.”
“Last time I checked, it’s the afternoon so if I want a couple of beers, I’m entitled to some,” Dean explains, but then, unable to help himself, acidly adds, “also I’m pretty sure both my parents are dead so you’re sure as shit not one of them. Mind your own fucking business.”
Dean rolls his eyes. “Not with that morning breath.”
“Dean. No,” Cas says seriously.
“Sam, I didn’t mean to laugh—”
“Never mind,” he says quietly. “That’s just what I used to think.”
“I’m sorry,” Cas says, squinting, “did you want to be bi instead?”
Fuck, it’s so nice.
“Of course you can, kid!”
sleeping together now. It’s not a big leap.”
“Not like that! I meant one at a time! What’s wrong with you?” Dean barks.
He waves away her sarcasm. “Under what circumstances would you build someone a greenhouse?”
Then Cas’ mouth twitches, and soon it morphs into a shy smile.
“I can’t believe this. I can’t believe you—”
“Your…feelings for me?” Cas iterates cautiously. His mouth is wrenched down like he’s expecting a cruel taunt in return or an acidic remark.
Cas observes him with a soft smile and amusement gleaming in his eyes, rather than the mock-scorn Dean had been expecting.
He exhales slowly, eyes drooping again, and he fights it by blinking rapidly. He wants to keep looking at Dean up-close like this. He’s so close. Castiel is so close he can count Dean’s freckles. Unbidden, his hand drifts up and they trace the sprinkle of little hazel patches on Dean’s cheeks.
“Alright, lets—lets go then.” He takes Cas by the hand and feels his clamminess with a spark of curiosity. Maybe Cas is looking forward to this too. Maybe Cas feels it a bit too. He’s not examined it properly enough yet but Dean’s pretty sure he would very much soar with happiness if Cas was into him the same way he was into—
Dean thinks he’s going to throw up. “You trying to get laid tonight? You’re gonna go out and fuck someone?” he hisses.
She is far too chipper for a girl whose boyfriend has brought a plus one to their date. He had asked her ahead of time, of course, and was indeed surprised to find no pushback on the proposition. With growing apprehension, he and Dean follow her past the living room up the stairs.
“You kissed him though,” Dean finds himself saying.
Unknown number.
Cas whirls his head at Dean as the car rolls to a halt in front of April’s house. “And why have you started calling me that? People are going to get the wrong idea and it—”
“My powers have been failing. I’m not sleeping yet, but I am feeling…tired sometimes. Hungry. Sometimes my back aches,” Cas says wryly.
“I don’t think that’s true—”
There’s no point in any attempt at calming his racing pulse now.
He thinks about how he’s now watching the shape of Dean and wants Dean in any way he can have him—but he doesn’t need it. He wants Dean, but he doesn’t need the entirety of Dean, only the scraps willing to be shared, because this friendship is more than enough.
hurt Cas.” Dean sounds so threatening that the walls go silent for a minute.
“Not as hot as you,” Dean blurts out and it’s odd.
“We like her other music too.”
Dean gapes at him. “We had it annulled!”
“Mildly, yes.”
“Dean! Stop!”
They’re already halfway to the Impala when Dean curses at his phone and frustratedly shoves it back into his pocket.
“So...” Dean ventures aimlessly, feeling naked and awkward and like he wishes hell would open its jaws under him. “Yeah. Um...yeah. For real. No joke.”
Dean falls into their strange domesticated nap like he fell for Cas, slow and steady.
Besides the cursory nod of acknowledgment and quiet hello and good morning, he doesn’t get anything else from Cas. He misses hello, dean. He doesn’t even get that anymore. He doesn’t get any smiles either. Maybe Cas just doesn’t smile anymore, whether Dean is there or not. Maybe Dean broke him. Dean tends to do that to the things he cares about.
“Hmm,” Cas hums, lifting his head away from the cold shelves of the fridge with a curious expression. “Do you often have a beer paired with ketchup for breakfast? I don’t think that sounds incredibly appetising,” he teases.
“And you often promptly, without hesitation, become best friends with any stray child that thinks you are cool? That sounds to me like concerning behaviour, Dean.”
smiling slightly, like he’s joining Eileen now in finding this all very ludicrous.
They’re standing far too close, and when Cas’ hand jerks away from him as well as his backtracking steps, away, further away, Dean wishes he’d kept his mouth shut.
“Phone’s dead,” he grumbles. “You got yours on you? In case Sam or Eileen calls? I don’t want anything happening to them because I’m too stupid to charge my goddamn useless piece of shit phone, or if they’ve been attacked by a monster along the way, or something with Chuck comes up, or even if they get back a little early and we’re not there, and what if they think something’s took us, and—”
Dean’s lips quirk at Cas. He must look very stupid and happy because Cas laughs softly at him and then bends down to press a quick peck to Dean’s lips in a strangely familiar way.
“Don’t say shit like that to me. He’s not—he’s not that. He’s everything to me. I’m allowed to want him around for as long as I can have him!” Dean argues with fervour. “He’s my—he’s my—this is
“Watching me sleep? Pervert,” Cas volleys back good-naturedly.
Scandalised, Cas hides his face behind his hands, shakes his head convulsively, and groans long and hard. Probably trying to banish the memories of when they decided to get hitched at Sam’s bachelor party — because obviously, in their guttered liquor-soaked brains, it would be hilarious to steal Sam and Eileen’s thunder by getting Dean into a store-bought $30 wedding dress and announcing their undying love unto one another at A Elvis Chapel, Vegas, while Cas’ older brother Gabriel filmed the entire thing on his flip-phone.
“Wait, what?” Dean blusters, eyes blown wide. “You’ve seen me with Lisa and—and other girls—“
It’s both strangely the same as kissing a girl, in that he doesn’t feel like he’s doing anything wrong.
It’s like Dean’s not even in the room, or worse, in one but as a child with two parents hovering over him like he doesn’t understand big adult words and big adult ideas. He huffs and crosses his arms petulantly.
“Does it matter?” Cas asks lightly. “I don’t think so.”
“I picked them up at a convenience store on a whim, like, yesterday, Dean,” Sam explains, still sporting that irritating shit-eating grin, like all of this is so goddamn farcical, “if I had special ordered one, it wouldn’t have arrived in time.”
“I have kept my mouth shut for so long because I didn’t want to out you to yourself. Charlie was very clear with me on that!”
The endearment in his interaction with Cas creeps in slowly through the bawling panic, somewhere in between his sixth glass of quickly downed water and a quavering hand that reaches for his first beer.
“So...what, you have a boyfriend now?” There’s a teasing smirk that replaces his genuine smile.
He copies Dean’s charming half-turned grin, inviting and salacious. “Do you want to get out of here?”
“A den of iniquity?” Cas supplies.
“What? I can’t miss my son?” John, however, relents in search of the bathroom. “I need to piss. Turn this gay shit off before I’m back.”
“He’s implying I am censorious and often disapproving of things.”
Dean smiles sleepily, burrowing his face into Cas’ chaos of hair and indulging in a long-drawn inhale.
Cas narrows his eyes at him. He’s not seen the wrathful angel persona directed at him in…awhile.
He had done his best, despite being off the line with a crack in his chassis, to blindly follow his elders’ orders and pursue what had been stapled into his understanding as ‘the norm.’
For the first time in four years, Cas is terrified.
“Of course I do,” he says, mouth wobbling as he tries not crumble. “I just don’t see how this can ever be easy. We can’t keep ignoring everything buried between us and barrel on like a normal couple. Shit, until yesterday, I couldn’t even accept who I really am or how I really felt about you. I’m still struggling to completely—and now, we’re on day one and we’re already fighting, and I just, I—”
“Come on, man,” Dean barrels on with an edge of frustration. “You like Meg but you’re not interested in her like that. I get it,” he nods meaningfully, “and I can’t avoid that yoga studio forever because my floppy-haired hippie brother owns the damn place and I’m his investor. If we tell them we’re together, Meg leaves you alone at our way too frequent group meet-ups and I don’t seem like a dick to Lisa and Ben, just someone that likes your dick.”
Without forethought or due consideration, he clutches Meg by her elbow and steers her into a disabled toilet. It was a surprisingly seamless spin.
“Right, of course,” he says, dusts off his spotless trench coat and gives a perfunctory nod to Sam. This, despite having known the kid since he was helping him learn to read. Dean’s methods had been far too stick-y and not carrot-y enough, according to Cas, though Dean is sure he had used much more eloquent wording.
like they’ve forgotten we were supposed to be having dinner tonight,” Dean amends with a sliver of irritation.
“Dean,” Casiel tries, seeing the pain and feeling sympathetic.
“Lis, look, I’m sorry—“ Dean starts before he’s interrupted by her launching herself at him. She’s hugging him.
“I—um—I’ve not eaten—properly—in awhile,” he stumbles through his confession. Cas starts to look troubled, so Dean ploughs on quickly before this discussion can snowball into something about how badly he’s been doing. “Sammy keeps some cereal in the cabinets if you’re hungry. Or I can get takeout. We could go to a diner?”
"I was valedictorian."
It takes three steps inside the yoga studio for what they’re doing to crash into Dean like a monster truck with loose breaks. He is immensely grateful for Cas’ grip tightening on him, holding them both upright.
It’s followed by a winky face.
“Nah, man. It’s fine. The amount of times Sam’s had to carry me home from a bar is just…ridiculous. It’s almost a Winchester rite of passage. No big deal.”
“As far as I’m concerned, this seems more like a ‘you’ problem,” Cas says in a finalising manner, even injecting finger air quotes,
His brother is approaching them. Sam is approaching them. Shit.
“I never said that,” Cas says weakly, “I’m only...concerned about how to proceed now. You dated Lisa for a short period, but it was enough for her to deduce, albeit incorrectly, that we are...more than we are. I’m anxious over what our friends will think.”
“Okay, well, have you ever heard of alaskan malamutes? Of course you have. They’re a deeper and nicer blue than that. You’d know if you weren’t so oblivious.”
“I thought we were drinking,” Cas says suspiciously.
"Wait, is this like an
“What are you going to do, live with him forever? You lived with him in college, you’re living with him after college, and then what? Are you going to move him into your guest room when you get a wife and buy a house with a white picket fence? He isn’t your therapy dog, Dean.”
“Did—did you hear—?”
“Don’t make light of this,” he warns in his commandeering tone that was very much angelic and forceful. For a second, Dean feels an emotional whiplash and his insides waver with uncertainty.
“That bitch,” Dean complains, taking one step back.
“Of course,” Cas answers, nodding and Dean can see his eyes are bloodshot, “I am always devoted to you.”
When he’s sober, he’s hungover. When he’s drunk, he agonises over the words Cas said. He can’t decide between what he’d prefer; for Cas to have been confused over what in love means, or for it to all be…real.
Cas has to hold a hand up to his mouth to stifle a laugh when they confront a bored girl at the check-in desk whose first words to them are, “two queens?” and Dean splutters.
Cas nods, solemn, like he understands. There’s something scary about that.
“Likely your drool,” Cas says with a playful head tilt.
, dumbass. You and me. Holding hands.”
“You aren’t,” Cas insists as he returns to his side of the bed and yanks Dean’s socks onto his own feet forcefully. “You’re just a warm body, that’s all.”
“Dean, listen to yourself, you’re going to buy a
He’s also probably a little bit on the spectrum because after their kiss, Dean’s not been able to stop thinking about how gorgeous Cas is.
“Don’t ‘Dean’ me. This is just—it’s a little fucking unacceptable, is what it is.”
“Um...no—no—uh...no. Sorry. Thought there was something on your lips for a second. Sorry.”
It's still within the same vein of 'yay the world's not ending and everything can be about Destiel' at least! So yay?
Cas recoils away from him with a shock. The last time Dean has ever raised such a venomous tone to him was way back when they were fifteen and escaping John Winchester.
“Brownie points for
Something in Dean’s fretful tone makes Castiel’s smile gentle from its earlier exuberance.
“You and Cas seem very clingy with each other all of a sudden.”
spikes at the touch. He’s a bit uncertain whether the clouded memory of what just happened is clogged in his brain by adrenaline or a concussion, but right now,
“Why are you here?” Castiel repeats with wonder. “Why are you being nice to me? You’re not usually…nice to me.”
They’ve sat this close before. They
Cas shifts from one foot to another.
“You don’t have to be mean,” Cas murmurs, his eyes sweeping away to fix on the wall behind Dean.
Dean has loosened Cas’ system of being to the point that he often forgets to limit himself and his whims. Most days, he doesn’t try to fit in at all.
Benny smirks at Cas with an air of cool boredom. Their friendship has always been lightly contemptuous and Cas always finds himself returning Benny’s friendly jabs as childishly as possible when he’s intoxicated.
With a courage he commends himself quite smugly for, he advances closer still and skims his nose down Cas’ cheek, finally coming to kiss him soundly at the corner of his mouth.
“I thought you were going out for beers after the job. I don’t have anything planned for us, I’m afraid. Although I must say it’s a nice surprise to see you.”
They tend to a couple more rounds that morning before even his seventeen-year-old body cannot keep up, then she’s hopping up and down into her skinny jeans. She pulls her hair up into a ponytail, whipping up a coquettish peek at him.
“Where
“Alright, weirdo,” Dean snorts.
He needs a drink.
“Go on. I’m not stopping you.” John looks so deflated it makes Cas feel a little sympathy for the man. Cas imagines he would derail off the course of healthy habits and normalcy too if the most important person to him in the world perished in a fire. He imagines his fall from grace to be legendary, were he unable to save his most important person. He looks to Dean, heart racing.
Castiel thinks he might have been a little too touchy, a little too clingy, a little too obvious last night. He’s already confessed his feelings but it’s obviously not reciprocated, and he’d been doing so well in keeping his distance from Dean so as to not make him uncomfortable.
“Okay.” And it is always that easy with Cas.
“I’m emotionally illiterate too,” Dean proclaims numbly as he watches Cas’ back disappear beneath the shirt he dons.
Castiel raises a fist to his mouth and tries not to vomit as he lurches forward with another wave of nausea.
“What the fuck, man? We’re like ten blocks away from where you live.”
Cas is no longer terrified. It’s almost a relief to know for certain that there is zero good to come out of burdening Dean with his feelings. Nothing will come out of it apart from tension and fallout. Perhaps something good can come out of him leaving Dean be. Like the girl behind the bar that Dean looks engrossed in currently.
“What the hell were you thinking? How could you be so stupid, so reckless—“
He feels homesick, but the kind where he knows his home has burned down. Again.
Anyway, this is the final flashback chapter!
Dean’s expression turns dark. “Like what I’ve been doing to you,” he chuckles without humour.
It’s a small smile but it crawls onto Dean’s face all the same. “Yeah. I do too.”
Dean’s knuckles whiten noticeably on the steering wheel. “I was trying to apologise. You’re acting really childish, y’know that?”
Dean licks his lips thoughtfully, giving Cas the longest look of adulation he can spare during a drive in the dark with no license and no direction.
“Frankly, I don’t believe I owe you an answer.” Cas’ voice is cold. It makes the room feel cold too.
Dean bounces his whole body on the mattress so that it springs Cas up and down along with it.
He’s thumbed through another page of his book. He’s lounged too casually on their couch to be even a little invested in what Dean is proposing. He’s paying such minimal attention to Dean that it makes Dean’s skin go all itchy and lips go all twitchy like a tempestuous child’s.
“Heya Jack,” Dean greets too loudly with an overconfidence he really doesn’t feel and plasters on his widest grin. “How you—what’s—what’s hangin’, lil dude?”
He stumbles towards Cas, who has gotten out his seat too, face twisted in pain, and is slowly backing away. “Cas,” he calls, “Cas, don’t go. I’m so—I didn’t mean it.” Then, with a deep breath, he says again what he said yesterday. “Please stay.”
Dean smiles wanly. “Take it from all of this that you’ve always been okay with it? No need for me to start looking for adopted dad number two, is there?”
“Does it really bother you that much?” Then, humourlessly, like he knows this reaction was inevitable, Cas tacks on dryly, “Did you not know?”
“Me?” Cas asks with an owlish expression.
“Fine. Why don’t you tell her to fuck off too just to seal the deal?”
“No, no, he’ll yell at my dad for it—it’ll just make it worse for later.”
“Um...no one has a problem with this, right?” Dean asks, unexpectedly a little terrified.
“That’s my coffee,” he murmurs. “You found my secret girly coffee and you drank it.”
Dean feels stunned. “Are you still drunk?”
“I feel sympathy for him,” Cas says as they reach Baby. “It must be lonely. I’ve been lonely. It isn’t…”
Eventually the anxiety melts under Cas’ adorable snuffles and the weighty arm which falls haphazardly across Dean’s waist at some point in the night.
Eventually, they decide it's better to fall together than apart.
“Cas, you can’t be happy, not sacrificing yourself for me like this. Y’know the first thing I’m going to do after that bitch ganks you for good? I’m going to sit down in that corner over there and I’m going to ignore the world. Hell, I might even lose myself again. That can’t make you happy, man. Not like this. If you love me, you can’t hurt me like this.” He knows it’s not Cas’ fault but what he’s saying, it makes something twitch.
“No, duh. You’d been watching anything but me the entire ride, thought you’d figure out the direction we were heading in at some point.”
He thinks about the many thoughts he’s suppressed, the many Do Not Say Out Louds, and how he’s been lying to Dean for about as long as Dean has steadfastly told him nothing but truths.
Sam reaches something close to stability first. “Dean,” he says, one gigantic hand covering the side of his mouth as his shoulders shake. “It’s because Castiel is not a…very common name.”
For Dean, his rule of thumb tends to be that if he smells bacon, he drifts to it like he’s in some Disney animation where the character floats towards the mist of pie. Lately, when he smells bacon, he knows it’s Cas in the kitchen and it’s a signal to avoid drifting to the source of the smell because another thing that’s worse than Cas being gone is when he does see Cas, and Cas looks right through him as if he’s a ghost.
“Something like that,” Dean mutters, shutting the door behind him with a slam.
“Cereal at midnight? You a shifter? What happened to my hippie health junkie brother?” Dean mocks, then realises his own compromising and very mockable position.
“Are you naked under there?” Dean continues in his hysterical voice, rushing to move the blanket from Cas’ lap.
“No!” Sam squeaks, “I just—you look at Cas like...like...I just thought—I dunno, people at school call you destiel—”
Cas, for his part, looks about as stunned as Dean feels over what he’s managed to express. He, likely as much as Dean, plausibly anticipated a much colder and detached parting. Like last time.
It hadn’t been until the whiskey got them tipsy enough to quash discomforts that they started snickering over nonsense and musing on Sam’s bachelor party.
Bobby looks at him with beady eyes. “You really think I’m such an idjit that I didn’t know about you? The way your eyes always lingered on him…” Bobby scoffs. “Most of us knew before you did. I figured you wouldn’t want to be bombarded about it before you figured it out yourself. Especially not with…”
“So this is all great.” Benny applauds his hands together cheerfully. Dean spares him a wary glance. “You and Cas. Almost too good to be true, isn’t it? You really ballsed up and did it. You’re finally together. What’s the catch?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You do?” he gapes, and it’s kind of both hilarious and adorable. “You actually...you do?”
He drinks the four-pack in under an hour. He listens to his music loudly, like a bratty pre-teen who’s been told they’re not allowed to throw a party.
“Cas?” Dean’s voice has shrunken to timid and afraid. “Cas, I’m—I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to yell...I don’t know why I get so angry.”
“My vessel, I think, is getting…older,” Cas muses. “I don’t mind it too much, aside from the constant need to relieve myself or when my knees start to burn when I run.” He glances down at his body in grimace.
“You sometimes forget to text me.”
bizarre giant voice that booms deep. “Big brother
Cas exhales. It’s soothing. “I told her she needn’t worry, that we weren’t playing a stupid prank.”
Cas has the gall to look sheepish. “Yes.” His shifty eyes turn accusatory towards Dean. “You went along with it.”
Somehow this feels different. Somehow this feels like there could be more.
Then—not so finally.
Dean pretends to whine into a corner before bounding back into Cas’ personal space to playfully snap his teeth at him. Cas belts out a boisterous burst of drunken giggles, shoving him away by his sternum.
Then he goes ahead and orders for them both like they’re a fucking couple—two double cheeseburgers with fries, and a slice of pie, with a chocolate milkshake.
Then one cruel sunbeam of light streams through a partial gap between Cas’ curtains, striking straight into Dean’s right eye.
Well, fuck it, Dean’s not just going to keep silent and brood like every goddamn time he felt something in his life. The world is falling apart, again, and they need each other.
“Of course you’d say that,” Dean snaps, “you’re the one that screwed up.”
“Oh.”
“Your sun is scratching my cornea,” moans Dean. “I told you to get black-out curtains.”
“Dean didn’t want to ask her not to bring Ben. It would have...incensed the issue before he managed to speak with her. He has a good reason, Sam, I promise. We’ll fill you in at dinner tonight,” Cas explains this like a professional actor with careless ease. So far, Dean has only managed to bumble uselessly about like a newborn guppy.
“Sorry, I don’t have any cyanide on hand. How about a light salad instead?”
“Yes,” Castiel agrees dazedly, “angry, like a bear.”
He jumps back, alarmed.
“So we pretend to everyone for a bit. It can’t be that hard. We live together, we’re always together outside work, flirting like twelve-year-old girls for banter,
“I thought you were feeling
He quickly washes today’s dirt and grime and sins off, dries off too, then grabs Cas’ favourite bumblebee boxers from his newly folded laundry out of childish spite. He dons it on and tosses his old pair into the laundry basket.
Her smile drops as she looks between them, but only for a second, and she asks if they want two straws with that milkshake.
Cas inches his hand towards where one of Dean’s rests on his thigh. He skims that thigh until their fingertips brush. Dean immediately unfurls his fingers to let Cas’ slip between until the heat of their palms press together tightly.
Dean sucks in a deep and fortifying breath, then dives.
Cas doesn’t seem to mind. He inches his head sideways and noses at Dean’s neck.
There’s a rolling sickness sweeping through Dean’s body. “Well, that’s fucking fantastic.”
“Hey, don’t talk to her like that,” Sam says without any heat, but weary.
Warning: Brief description of Cas/other sexual encounter (literally in like the first line?)
Sam scoffs. “Yeah, alright. Sleep. Everyone’s dead, the world’s ending, and my brother’s banging an angel man that’s been our best friend for eleven years. Sure. Okay.”
“—you want to be up, yeah, yeah, I get it.” He nips at Cas’ neck once to elicit a yelp. He gets another smack, this time on the cheek.
“Okay,” he says around a mouthful of pie. “I’m’a call you Cas though.”
“I’m not a sugared and mucil—whatever either.”
Dean answers, shuts his eyes as he listens.
To Cas, the conversation has ended.
“Alright,” he coughs, “let’s rock and roll.”
Dean tries to smooth over his prickliness in time for when Cas appears in front of the bathroom door with his own towel in his hand.
“You’ve had a…shitty life. A shitty time, especially for the past decade or so. Fifty, if we’re counting hell, which I think we definitely should. Being treated like that, going through all of that, can make a person act shitty sometimes, but it doesn’t make you a shitty person.”
“Thank you for helping with breakfast. Are you still making dinner tonight?” Cas asks jovially, flipping his expression to unbothered in a motion that’s as quick as wink. It makes Dean wonder what else he is concealing, considering the expert transition at play here.
The information doesn’t move through Dean initially. He sits there, frowns, and then feels his lungs give out when the empty human-less landscape punctures him. His mind does a rerun of everyone they’ve lost and everything goes to black as tears prick his eyes.
Dean sighs and leans into Cas. “Fine,” he agrees dryly, “just—fine. Okay.”
“You say something else then,” Dean hisses back.
“Yeah, yeah, he’s slumped over in a booth, but the barmaid’s giving him lots of water. Wait, you are Dean, right? He’s been talking about you all night, I just assumed—and your number is listed on his favourite contacts—I—I’m sorry if you’re not—is there someone else I can call or…?”
“You—er—shower now,” Dean states the obvious, unsure why immediately after.
“No, no,” Dean says, desperate and begging. “Cas, no. We’re running around in circles here. Tell me what to do. Tell me how to fix this. I just want us to—“ he pauses and forces the words from his throat that doesn’t want to come, “be okay,” he manages.
“Can I ask you a question?” he blurts out, shoulders heaving from his heavy breaths.
They’re still hugging so it’s a little awkward when Cas replies, mumbling against his shoulder, “yes?”
“Yes, I—” Castiel nods, “thank you.”
“No?”
Dean inhales deeply and glances up at Castiel, some kind of determination set in his face. Castiel’s seen that look before. It’s the look Dean gives the monsters he’s about to fight.
Dean’s brain short-circuits. He’s drunk. He’s heard wrong. It must be. His heart jumps and his mouth runs dry and he’s shaking his head like it’s possible to shake something in his mind loose.
Sam looks up gloomily at Cas. “And you?”
“We have Belgian chocolates too. It’s not all French. I’m expanding my horizons, Dean.”
“I can’t believe I’m having to ask this again within a five minute window, but what the hell? Seriously, what the fuck was all of that?
Sam shakes his head while Dean sneers downwards.
Dean can take two steps and he’ll be close enough to envelop him. He’s sober now so maybe Cas will even let them kiss once some time has been devoted to clinging onto each other—for all the time that’s been lost to Dean’s stubborn and uncompromising will.
Dean glowers. He decides to leave it and instead shifts the car into gear, leaving the new spanking sign of Harvelle’s Roadhouse in the rearview mirror as he rolls Baby out the parking lot and onto the dusty roads.
“It was sweet.” Cas pats Dean’s cheek affectionately and Dean has to actively try not to chase Cas’ hand once it leaves his orbit.
He has the door unlatched and one foot out when her hand settles on his shoulder. It’s comfortable there and almost tender. “Claren—
“What a bitch! I hate her! I
makes him chuckle.
“Shall I—um—me too?” Dean fumbles, realising only after his mouth spewage that he didn’t manage to ask Cas with enough words.
Thankfully, Cas comes down the steps alone.
“Dean,” he intones, “I have absolutely no idea what you’re talking about right now. What happened in there?”
“You shouldn’t swear in front of Sam.”
“As they say, slow and stable motions do end up triumphing in running competitions,” Cas says airily, falling back to the couch with closed eyes again.
“Me? What’s wrong with me?” His voice raises and he’s shaking his head in frustration. “He’s the one who dropped this—this unnecessary bomb on top of everything else we have to deal with right now. He’s the one that fucked up our friendship. He’s an angel, Sam. He probably doesn’t even know what it means.”
“Cas, we said we weren’t gonna call each other that in public,” Dean mumbles automatically, though he doesn’t really care right now.
Their kiss ends there with Dean gasping, “no,” and Cas smiling at him, bittersweet.
Her bottom lip is tremors, and he feels a tug towards her when her eyes start watering. “Cas, I—”
“The guy you’ve been rambling on about all night? His freckles, his eyes, his soul?” The man before him is teasing him now, he can tell. Even drunk and still not entirely top of his class in ‘people skills’, he doesn’t miss the amused look the man shares with the waitress next to him.
Cas face heats up into a pale pink blush, and while it’s rare to see Cas blush, it’s rarer for Dean to notice that he thinks it’s pretty. He needs beer immediately, followed by shots.
“Here. Take one of my fleeces. I brought three.”
Castiel’s eyes widen a fraction but he swiftly collects himself. “Winchester?” he asks weakly, regretting it as soon as he says it. He should have ignored that, not think too much of it.
“Didn’t realize it’d be so cold. I’m eleven, dude. I don’t really know how to take care of myself. My baby bro, I’m awesome in that department. Myself, not so much.”
“It did go very well.” Dean’s shoulders slump. “Not so much when I ended up spilling the beans to Benny in the car. I...I told him everything.”
“Bond?”
Once Dean crosses his arms and flares up his furious expression, glare intensified, the three assholes purse their lips simultaneously, stifling their laughter
“I’m not better than anything,” Dean says, annoyed, “and, I had, like, three beers, maximum. It takes a hell lot more than that to take a tank like me anywhere close to tipsy.” As if cosmic intervention had it out for him—which just about explains everything over the past forty or so years—he misses a step down the stairs and almost plants head-first into the grimy floorboard.
This is why he loves Cas, because Cas always makes things better, in any shitty or weird or uncomfortable or unhappy situation. Cas makes things click.
They’ve been this close perhaps a handful of times. Dean’s never felt allowed to watch for too long. He does now.
Dean reckons this is what having a heart attack while you win the lottery feels like. He’s buzzing, with fear, with excitement, and the tiniest bit of nausea.
I will be updating every Sunday unless otherwise noted. :) If you enjoy, please leave a comment! Feedback is so nice when you aren't sure if you're just writing to yourself hah!
They both looked at the photo in silence a minute or so. Bobby cleared his throat and Castiel looked over. “How’s Dean taking it, you being stuck up here?”
"We gotta make time for that later," Dean groaned out. "A handy doesn't compare to-ahh, ah," Dean moaned as Cas changed his grip and slipped a finger down to fondle him lower.
Mary stood, stretching her arms above her head. “Breakfast sounds good, then we three can head back.”
Cas pressed himself as tightly to Dean’s back as he could as Dean fidgeted nervously with the key card. He was already hard, and he knew Dean could feel it under his layer of denim as he gripped his hips with both hands.
made out. They’ve knocked noses, chests, shoulders, and even the most intimate of appendages some mornings.
What was intended as a lighthearted comment makes Cas recoil a little bit.
“It’s not like I went into that relationship with the intention of being buddy-buddy with her kid,” Dean mutters defensively, “but he was cool, and he thought I was really cool.”
“Oh,” Sam drawls, still enjoying this way too much. “You haven’t talked about it yet.”
“But you—you’re—no,” Dean protests, “I want to stay here with you. Talk some more.”
Benny ignores this very important piece of information. “Most importantly, you will not build him that greenhouse. It’s an effortful and thoughtful gesture that implies way more than friendship.”
“Yes. Sam showed me yesterday.”
“You wanna sit down too?” he asks shakily, testing the waters and feeling like he’s about to be drowned for it. “I can scoot over.”
“Castiel.”
As soon as they’re in her bedroom, she starts clawing at Cas’ neck, bringing him down in a smothering kiss that he acquiesces to mostly out of confusion.
“Dean, you’re not getting in my bed without a shower.”
Rolling his eyes, Dean claps Castiel on the back and they start heading back towards the bunker.
Dean doesn’t appear convinced, but Cas turns the corner as fast as he can and presses his back against a wall before an argument can be broached. He extinguishes a shuddering breath before he can exhale it too loudly and shuts his eyes to quiet his surroundings.
It’s scarier than any demon he’s ever met, how quickly Dean’s behaviour can turn from something so giving and kind and playful and wondrously childlike to this blackened ugly thing.
Dean’s peripheral vision catches Sam and Eileen staring on with shit-eating grins and then bumping into each other in their failed process of dispersing.
“Look, we accomplished what we wanted without any blowback...I mean,
He shakes his head at her, signs that
Thank you for reading! Back to Dean’s POV next chapter, I think. I’m happy to hear any thoughts and ideas for what comes next, as I’m still juggling a few ideas in how to best conclude this little fic.
As they head over, he hears Cas sigh. “I was distracted...thinking about something. I didn’t realise we were meeting other people so soon.”
“I’m still waiting.”
, he almost word-vomits. Cas is close enough that Dean can see the vibrations of his shoulders, agitated beneath the guise of calm.
Cas sighs, relenting. Always relenting in the face of Dean. “You’re supremely difficult.”
Cas latches onto this opportunity to flee with enthusiasm. “Of course. Definitely.” He’s already halfway out the booth. “I’m just going to the bathroom first. Feeling a little nauseous. Might be awhile.”
Dean flushes a deep red as the table roars with friendly but salacious jabs.
“Cas!” Sam exclaims, barrelling through the door like the interrupting moose that he’s always been. Dean curses beneath his breath and shuffles further away from Cas.
Dean’s looking at him with furrowed brows and Castiel wants to puff a breath and blow away all the hurt that Dean keeps inside, the ones that sometimes creeps onto his face with a sullen glower. He wishes he could heal the inside of Dean the same way he could—or used to—heal the broken arms and busted legs.
“A couple glasses of water then.”
“Lisa. Heh. Hey.”
She is too.
“You shouldn’t be anywhere but here,” Dean murmurs, “we could die tomorrow and we should hold onto as much time as we can get here, with everyone that we love.”
“I didn’t say anything,” he says, still smirking.
“You do call him by terms of endearment a lot,” Garth pitches with a pensive slant of the head.
“You didn’t though, right?”
“Oh, please, that was a decade ago—”
? This is a terrible school.”
Dean grumbles, “cotton mouth.” He has a cantankerous expression on him that vanishes instantly when his eyes lock onto Castiel’s bewildered ones. Everything brightens when Dean grins sloppily at him.
“I didn’t realise we were doing this so much more thoroughly now,” Cas says breathily when Dean pulls back, his hitch of breath hitching Dean’s. “Aren’t we—isn’t this a little too far for pretend or practice or—what is this, Dean?”
“I have a date.”
Dean’s insides are doing terrifying flippy things and it feels a bit butterfly-like—
“Vehement. Is that your word of the day?” Cas tries to tease, tentative and quiet. One corner of his lips quirk though and it’s enough to launch Dean into grin.
“Dean?”
“Bitch,” Dean mutters, necking his beer in petty protest.
“Oh, I’m so sorry, I was just about to head into—”
“Wait,
“Er—”
Castiel sighs dramatically. “I suppose I’ll take some pie so you can stop being so stubborn and not die of hypothermia. Why is this even necessary of me? How did the teachers not intervene?” he grumbles the complaints mostly to himself with indignation.
The minutes tick by, enough time lapsing for Dean to perspire through his undershirt. His flannel hides some physical remnants of his stress but his forehead is starting to bead noticeably with sweat. Benny goes to turn the airconditioning on for Dean’s sake, and he in turn slaps his hand away and turns the radio off instead.
“I’m sorry she thought we were—”
“Cas.”
Castiel glances down to see Dean pushing himself upwards by Castiel’s thighs, smacking his lips together like his maw is sticky.
“Does this mean I can still join you?” Dean asks eagerly.
(See the end of the chapter for
A rather personal answer which Dean dodges by snorting obnoxiously.
This is likely going to turn out into more than 8 chapters too...
“What?” Dean barks. “Why do you care what people think?”
“Sorry. I suppose my room is free again now.”
This, along with a figure that tumbles through like a toddler in gymnastics training.
!” Dean snarls.
Benny shakes his head vigorously. Does-Not-Compute has evolved rapidly into No-Fucking-Way. “No, no, no. What do you mean?”
What he does is drink a bit more, then trip and totter into the War Room where he’ll be able to see Cas as soon as he comes down the staircase.
“Are you insane?” Dean bares his teeth at her as if he’s turned into an animal himself. “We’re not here to tag-team you! We’re not—we aren’t like that.”
“I’m sorry, say…?”
“Because I’m in love with you,” Cas says straightforwardly, calm and cool like they’re discussing nothing more rousing than the weather.
“I’m not going to forget the mushrooms,” Dean grumbles. “It was one time. Let it go.”
“Whatever you want.”
“The TV is still intact at least,” Cas half-heartedly jokes.
“Hey! Ow. Don’t assault me, asshole.”
“Yeah, that.”
“This isn’t home,” Cas declares.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah?”
Cas harrumphs. “I like them,” he asserts, then grumpily pulls Dean’s hand onto his lap to cover it completely with his other hand.
Cas embraces him immediately and Dean envelops him with such tightness that implies he never wants to let go.
He parts his mouth as if to ask, then smiles darkly as if the ‘does-not-compute’ element of his brain has been overridden by ‘whatever’.
“Sorry, that sounded pretty gay, didn’t it?”
Another groan falls from his parched mouth when he swings his feet to the floor and stands. He palms the wall for support as he putters towards the bathroom, grabbing the towel folded at the foot of his bed along the way.
“In case one gets dirty or another gets wet. I didn’t realise until Mr. Henriksen told me this morning that I wasn’t going to be allowed on the waterfalls.”
“I’m surprised dad’s not come out, banging on the window yet,” Sam titters darkly.
“I know,” Cas hums through the line. “Me too.”
Dean also seems to be the only one that can tell when it’s done out of learnt politeness. He is, however, jealous that despite his falsified smile, Cas does seem genuinely pleased to see Sam, untethered by the webbings of hurt and tension and suppressed strife. Nothing like when he first ran into Dean again after…everything.
“You don’t need a knife for pasta.”
She shakes her head and plucks a Christmas cookie from the tin of goods Cas had prepared for them this morning. Dean loves the fact that he bakes.
Dean barely sees him, though he does hear him talking in murmured whispers with Sam and Eileen around the bunker, hears him in the shower, hears him pottering about in his room, hears him humming to himself as he makes breakfast.
He tugs on the end strands of his hair. The shallow, artificial pain does nothing to numb his horror.
“Dean, this is silly.”
“Heh. She thought we might’ve already been banging too. Ain’t that something?” Dean’s cheeriness fades along his sentence into the welcoming arms of Uncomfortable. “Isn’t that—um—”
Dean breathes a sigh of relief, or maybe he just breathes for the first time since he started on his nowhere plan.
This is not goodbye.
“We will,” Dean asserts, even though he’s pretty sure they aren’t either.
He knows Dean will never reciprocate. He knows this is all he will get and he is thankful for even this crumb of intimacy. Really, it’s not a crumb at all.
He wonders if today is the day his carelessness finally comes to pulverise his best kept secret.
“Asshole,” he slings at Cas playfully, reaching to hold his waist, pull him forwards, and peck him on the lips.
Before he lets himself fall into a fast and effortless slumber, Dean pleads with himself to remember. To please let himself be brave enough to talk to Cas tomorrow.
Dean’s competent response is “bleurgh,” followed by a bleary, “I win,” accompanied by a lazy thumbs up.
Cas is crouched in the corner, his head in his hands.
Apoidea, fine, boys can like bumblebees and honeybees because at least they fall under insects. Insects are cool. Astronomy, also fine,
He’s one step in when Sam calls, far too cheerily, “I have waffles! Who’s hungry?”
“You hate Meg because she’s always taking up your seat next to Cas and flirting with him and sleeping with him,” Benny corrects.
Dean’s heart is hovering somewhere near his navel and Cas is still hovering somewhere near his face still. He surges forward and captures his lips in another tender but brief kiss, before releasing his friend and falling backwards.
A rush of displeasure, trickled with envy, is taking over before he can quash it. He’s afraid it will show, so he faces away quickly before Cas can catch onto anything.
Cas hesitates for a moment before schooling his countenance into one of enthusiasm. “Of course.”
Cas is pulling back much too soon, staring open-mouthed at Dean. He looks either astounded or petrified. Both?
“No, butthead, what’s with him and that weird voice?”
“More like my own stupidity,” Dean grumbles, kicking at a nearby rock and focusing his eyes on its tumble across the parking lot. “Spent most of my life not knowing where my happiness was when I had it by my side all along. Besides, it’s not like that’s the only thing stopping me. Cas would never—” he stops himself, almost forgetting that in this world, Cas does return his feelings.
Dean plunks his head against the wheel. “Shit, I know, Cas. My idea of a human is just fucked up and selfish, grim and shit, and…you’re—you’re none of those things. I’m sorry. I’m a fucking asshole, I’m so fucking sorry.”
“Depends. How much of that did you hear?”
“You were upset with me over the angel tablet. I tried to make it up to you by purchasing some of those eastern-asian magazines you enjoy and some pie. The boy ran out of pie that time and I may have…gotten somewhat aggressive,” Cas explains, unravelling with some shyness towards the end.
Cas’ face transforms from a soft worried look to one that is full-bellied chortling. “Have you given thought to how our friends would likely have a problem lying about something this disreputable, discounting the fact that Charlie especially is a terrible liar?”
“What are we laughing at?” Cas asks pleasantly, popping out of nowhere yet again. It amazes Dean how he can still do that the human ways, without his wings and disapparating mojo. God, he had listened in on to too much of Sam and Charlie’s Harry Potter references.
Surprisingly, highly enjoyable.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m not oblivious, Dean,” he replies, playing on a scandalised voice. When Dean doesn’t rise to the occasion with a quippy retort, he nudges his friend’s knees with his own meaningfully. “I notice most things, like how you seem not very happy right now. What can I do to make you happy, Dean?”
“No—I—now. Wanna talk now. I don’t believe you. You’re not over it.” Dean’s getting really close to the angel now, so close and falling over his feet so much that Castiel—Cas has his arms outstretched, ready to catch Dean. Dean considers lurching forward on purpose.
“It’s my studio, I’ll yell if I want to!” Dean shouts at an instantly regrettable volume. He somehow forgets to lower it when he powers through thoughtlessly with, “you’re also yelling, by the way!”
Dean bounds up like a puppy hearing ‘park’ and ‘walk’, almost runs into Cas in his haste. They exchange brief awkward glimpses while they brush their teeth beside each other, glancing away with mortification each time they catch each other’s eyes. Dean notices with eager pleasure that Cas finishes brushing his teeth in two minutes instead of his typically required routine of four. He’s too giddy to unpack and overthink what that means about Cas’ own keenness.
Eventually, he says, with wariness, “you’ve thought a lot about this.”
The drive is…really fucking pleasant.
“I can’t believe what a big bag of dicks you’re being right now. I’m gonna go find—”
“C’mon, Cas! Let’s do it!”
It’s been a couple of days and 15x18 is still traumatising to me. So that’s the theme for today’s fix-it.
Cas eyes peek open and the way he beams at Dean makes him forget why he’s not ever done that before. Why he was hesitant to do it in the first place.
He had managed to dodge Sam and Eileen up until they had called into his room that they’d be going out for dinner together. Sam had looked discomfited by the idea of leaving Dean alone, but of course, for this purpose, to be able to be left alone, Dean was able to plaster on a false smile and assure everyone that he’s just going to sleep it off.
He looks across to Cas, uncomprehending, and mouths ‘
At April’s doorstep, after ringing the bell, they both face each other with regret and mortification.
“That would be very wrong.”
John chortles. “Very on brand for you two.”
? I’m not the one huddling under blankets at 1AM with my best friend, swearing him to secrecy over watching another telenovela rerun or—or how you wore Rhonda Hurley’s panties that one—”
Shake it Off! You heard it on the radio one damn time.”
“What?” he exclaims at the same time as Sam.
Dean sits up a little straighter, worn. “No, Cas, look—it’s not like we’re getting married...again,” he snorts to himself and receives a puzzled and concerned look from Benny who seems to be picking up on Dean’s end of the conversation.
“I’m only trying to determine the viability of our narrative, if there were to be one."
Dean.
Instead of saying this, he forces a tenuous laugh. “Quoting philosophy first thing in the morning, huh? You know, Cas, I could listen to you talk for hours.” The playful jibe doesn’t come off sounding like a jibe at all. It softens too much into truth. “You’re really clever. I don’t know why you spend so much time with me,” he admits wryly.
Cas nods jerkily and goes to busy himself with whipping up another batch of breakfast.
He can’t say he’s sorry for the last time they’ve talked on the phone when he said naught more than he’d said. He can’t even say sorry for the last time their eyes met in person and Cas left without Dean asking him to not go. All these words, all the regrets, they catch in his throat, and all he can do is say that he’ll listen now. Cas had tried to talk to him, and he was fair in reminding Dean that Dean hadn’t listened. Hadn’t even looked him. Cas isn’t dead to him though, he could never be, and now, the least Dean can do at is look at him. Listen.
He lurches himself forward into a formless Cas, into the goo, begins to babble nonsensically, without plan.
“I know,” Cas repeats quietly. “I shouldn’t have...jumped to conclusions. I was feeling a little sensitive from—well...you know.”
“Yes, assbutt, come brush your smelly teeth so we can...after.”
Benny blinks. “You know what? No.” He spins around and begins a frenetic skirmish with his car door in a pitiful attempt to open it.
“It’s like ten in the evening, so yeah.”
Cas snorts. “I’m sure you’ll come up with something worse someday. I’ll probably go along with that too.”
“Then I’d like to tell you that you look like a vibrating icicle. Aren’t you freezing?”
“Why? Isn’t that what we’re doing? Treating each other’s partner’s like they aren’t even family?” Dean demands, belligerent.
He arches his head and kisses Cas, who responds immediately under his lips.
“I’m more sure than ever on
“Okay, you guys, well,” she fans a hand over her face, “thanks for doing this after my last class and not before. I think I’ll go grab a few drinks with the girls tonight, after all. Call in a sitter for Ben.” She squeezes Cas’ hand and then squeezes Dean’s.
They stare, both equally disoriented and together terrified.
This is what Cas considers his ultimate comfort. He hopes it’s even a sliver of that to Dean in this time.
As soon as the bathroom door clicks shut, Dean is up and scouring through the chest of drawers, haphazardly hurling random articles of clothing into an old rucksack.
Dean scoffs. “If I could have just done it to make sure she didn’t get to, believe me, I would’ve taken one for the team.”
It’s also definitely butterflies.
“Dean—“
“Um...” Dean coughs. “So...bacon. Thought you were trying to make me eat healthier.”
“Oh, um—“ Cas shrugs, flustered. “I’m still not…”
Cas just shakes his head, equally mystified, and shrugs.
“Mm?” Cas hums sweetly.
“I doubt anything you own is clean.”
“God,” Dean shakes his head, his cheeks aching from grinning. He’d forgotten how it felt to grin for a little time. “You’re so friggin’ dumb, man,” he chuckles affectionately.
“What’s hangin’, lil dude?” he hisses at Dean.
He first appears in the playground, shouting at some younger boys with another younger boy tucked under his wing like a baby bird. He comes off toughened, aggressive, but also wildly protective.
Unfortunately, the morning after hadn’t been so chipper with Dean waking up head-first in a toilet bowl and Cas conked out, limbs akimbo, in a vomit-coated bathtub. They almost missed the wedding and Sam’s honeymoon consisted of him assisting Dean and Cas with their quickie stress-fuelled annulment via Skype.
“Dr. Sexy,” Dean grinds out.
“Hello to you to, Dean,” Cas says with some sarcastic undertone.
Cas’ brandishes his trembling but thick and reassuring fingers to lace through Dean’s. He shakes it at Lisa and smiles like an asylum patient off their meds.
“I didn’t do that with anyone. I went on one date. You suggested I moved on from you. You suggested that I, as you phrased, get the fuck over it,” Cas snarls, pacing towards where Dean is slouched in his chair. He leans forward with threat in his face, so unlike the strange but tender Cas that is Dean’s—and much more like Castiel, the strong, thunderous, commanding angel Dean first stabbed in the barn.
Cas even goes in for the kill with a reassuring palm to Sam’s shoulder which manages to sink his inflating ire. A soft look crosses Sam’s face. Dean thanks whatever higher powers there may be, praying that Sam takes his yoga bag and vamooses on along now.
“He’s a nephilim, Dean. He can still hear you even when you whisper.”
, he would have heard this exclamation. “I thought I was the drunk idiot tonight, but apparently you are.”
“Oh,” Cas says, and Dean curves his neck to look at him where—shit, Cas is pretty, but also so handsome, with flushed cheeks and moist lips. He also sees that Cas is blinking owlishly at him, as if in confusion.
“Sorry?”
They startle together, simultaneously alarmed.
Eileen wrings her hands, keeps trying to catch Sam’s eyes.
“You tell me,” Dean retorts, eyes narrowed.
The pressure on his chest increases. Dean almost cries in displeasure, maybe he does, when Cas parts their lips with a loud, wet smack and lifts Dean off him.
“You don’t have to come over,” Dean says grimly, once again wondering how the hell he survived life this long being such a monumental idiot and getting them into this situation. “It’s my mess. I’ll—I’ll go through with it myself on this front. It’s on me.”
“Cas,” Dean chokes, “you can’t—” but he wants, “you can’t just say shit like that, man,” he manages through strained, uncomfortable laughter. “It’s too fucking much.”
“No Taylor Swift.”
“Aren’t we?”
He wanted to kiss Cas. Okay. Let’s start with that first.
Okay um...I did it again. There’s going to be a Part 3 to Cas’ POV. I’ve not even hit 5+1 yet.
“Hey, did Cas teach you that?” Dean momentarily halts his attack on Cas to lean forwards across their booth, sloppy as can be. “’Cause he calls me that word all the time.”
“Cas,” he says again, taking a step forward, “we’d like you to stay. I’d like you to stay,” and with some strength that he’s not mustered up in awhile, he adds, “please.” It feels like he’s leapt off a cliff.
“No! Utterly not.”
Sam giggles to himself. “I guess, yeah. Yeah. A bit. Not let loose in awhile. Always worried about your glum ass.” He eyes Dean, then Cas, then grins stupidly. “Guess I don’t have to worry about that anymore, huh? You two look nice and cosy.”
There’s so much more intimacy for him and Cas to come, and the thought enthuses Dean so much that it bleeds into their kiss. The shy brush, tug, press, and pull of lips, turns into tongues sweeping into mouths and moans that escalate into Dean somehow falling into Cas’ lap.
“I’m not upset,” he laughs spitefully, “I’m ecstatic for you! I did tell you to get over it. Remember? I said that. I rejected you, and now you’re free to do whatever. Didn’t realise you’d get over it so quickly but I’m glad you did, man. Now we don’t have to walk on eggshells around each other with your gay fucking feelings for me. It’s fucking fabulous. I always knew you were just confused.”
“I like being woken up naturally by the sun. When the sun is up—”
Dean faces Benny with a pained expression. “Look, I know it seems crazy, but I—”
“No, because I don’t look.”
“I am perfectly content in my…arrangement with Meg—”
“Do you want a sandwich? Are you hungry, buddy?”
“I cannot believe you forgot to text Sam,” huffs Cas, quickly casting his gaze away from Dean’s mouth.
“Are you asking me or telling me?” Dean responds archly.
Thank you so much again! This has been a really fun and fulfilling experience for me.
The problem is Dean needs to be alone with Cas right now.
“I hate that you lost your virginity to her. I hate it,” Dean rampages on, oblivious to Cas’ growing disinterest in the matter of April. “It should have been with someone else, Cas. Someone that knows how great you are the way I do.”
“Many lines have been crossed, brother.”
“You tell me. You really mean to tell me this doesn’t—that you don’t feel anything after that?” he cajoles with his forehead falling to rest against Cas’.
Dean ignores him. “I don’t want to live without you.”
There’s happiness in just the knowing.
Ellen was as enthusiastic about the finished result of their labour as Dean expected her to be.
A horrifying thought strikes Dean and he is suddenly overcome with an irrational and paralysing fear that he’s misunderstood everything.
“When you go to sleep, who do you think about the most?”
Ash takes a huge bite of his pie and chews it thoughtfully. He appears to come to some kind of conclusion as he shakes his head. “Weird joke, man. Seems like only people with feelings for each other would do something like that.”
Bobby snorts with laughter.
He doesn’t remember pushing his way through the door and stumbling into the next room.
Another time, he’s chatting animatedly with a classmate of Castiel’s named Benny around the high school bleachers. Castiel was only passing by because he got lost. Rebellious too, then.
They hold hands on their way back to the car. Dean’s so grumpy that he doesn’t notice until he has to unleash Cas in search of his car keys.
“No one would believe it. There’s no way. Sam and Benny have known us since we were kids. Charlie and Meg and Eileen since college.” Cas stands abruptly, with purpose, only to pace the room aimlessly. “They know you and me. There’s never been anything between us…and—” Cas stops, frowns, and zeroes in on Dean with a scrutiny that makes him blush. It almost feels like he’s being undressed by Cas’ eyes.
Dean grimaces. At least he’s not mentioned to Benny yet that he’s been making out with Cas like a touch-staved teenager. He reckons that would be the final nail in the coffin of Benny’s sanity.
“I am. Talk to you later. Love you.”
“I heard that, jerk!” He calls loudly as he bumbles down the hallway, juggling his multiple sacks of goods that, Dean would like to reiterate, is ambitious for even a Winchester that size to physically transport. The kid is acting like a lovesick teenager with all this gift-giving ritual crap and it makes Dean chuckle under his breath with a degree of fondness.
“Great attitude from someone that’s overstayed his welcome!” Dean calls after his brother who mutters something resembling ‘jerk’ under his breath. “You never mind that, Eileen, you’re always welcome here! Even after you come to your senses and divorce Sam!”
He gauges this mostly from soaps and telenovelas that he and Dean watch together in Bobby’s basement, once everyone is sound asleep and could never stumble upon them gorging on their collective guilty pleasure. He still doesn’t really understand why he should feel guilty about enjoying what he enjoys. All Cas knows is his friendship with Dean may be at risk were he to refuse shards of what Dean labels masculinity.
Cas awkwardly untangles himself from his position half-perched on Dean.
“Extroverted and attractive, I would say,” Cas sniffs, then assesses Dean again with a gaze that feels too heavy, “and I suppose that’s you, just in a different body than I’m used to.”
It’s a galaxy of rapture just to love Dean Winchester.
“We have everything but mistletoe,” Eileen announces sleepily before they all lumber towards their bedrooms.
“Wait. Have you guys not had sex?”
“Cas!” he hears Dean call. “Buddy, that you? You okay?”
For the third time this hour, Castiel lets out a loud groan. He’s also most definitely closer than ever to becoming human because he’s never groaned aloud with so much exhausted chagrin when he was a fully fledged angel, unencumbered by human emotions.
“Don’t wear my lucky boxers!”
He almost does it.
“Hey, geniuses. One of you looks like an overgrown tree. We can
He hands the mug to Dean and Dean gets half-way up the chair before he realises his...problem hasn’t gone down. He falls back into the seat, stares at the mug, and gulps.
“Dean, be careful, it’s—”
“No!” They burst out together in tandem.
Jesus christ.
Cas harrumphs, but still follows Dean like a waddling baby duck behind its mother, except he’s a lot more graceful and Dean is a lot more wobbly on his bowlegs. “And you think getting drunk will help.”
Cas’ right leg hooks over Dean’s waist and he flips them over in one fluid motion, and Dean erupts with laughter and high-pitched screams of protest as Cas licks his palm and presses the slobbery wet skin onto Dean’s cheek. He presses down, until Dean’s face is smushed against the carpet.
“I think I just want the cocoa. If that’s okay,” he says with a smile.
Jesus fucking Christ.
“You misunderstand. I only meant that I typically go for a more subdued type.”
The comment serves its purpose. Cas’ steps falter and he spins around to give Dean the dirtiest glare Dean’s ever seen on him, so incensed and shaken. It’s something. He’s at least not leaving.
“You know, I’ve been watching you two dance around each other since we were all going through puberty,” Benny continues. Cas’ muscles seize up. “Isn’t twenty-eight old enough to have your bisexual awakening? Or whatever your Cas-specific orientation comes under.”
Dean scowls at him but only half-heartedly. “Shut your face.”
Megalodon.”
Dean shrugs, looks at his feet. He only just realised there’s socks on them. Cas must have put them on him at some point in the night again, half-asleep as he normally does when Dean’s cold feet pokes him.
“There’s some cookies in the pantry too, Jack.”
Ahhh I’m sorry if the angst got too much again. Next chapter WILL be lighter and back to basics with fun interlaced with emotion and happy happy happy ❤️
Dean chuckles. “Yeah. I know, babe.”
No, he responds immediately. He isn’t ready to do anything again. Not right now.
Cas is swallowing his nerves next to Dean, and Dean watches closely to the way his throat bobs.
“I thought you two were already together,” Ash comments, casual and disinterested around his mouthful of pie crust.
“You know, I thought you were better than this, Charlie—but you’re just like every other asshole that thinks Cas and I have something fucked up going on just because our relationship runs deeper than anything. Friends can be intimate, friends can kiss—”
Dean strokes a few fallen strands of hair from Cas’ eyes, noting dreamily that he needs haircut soon.
He’s holding a guy’s hand. He’s fully made out with a guy—practically crawled into his lap like some wanton girl.
Cas grumbles something unintelligible that makes Dean pause to raise an eyebrow at him.
“Not really the point I was trying to drive home.”
“We have been kissing rather vigorously, with tongue, as well as holding hands. You, Dean, have also attempted to grind into my lap, touch me sexually, then proceeded to complain when I stopped you—and you now have a problem with us cuddling because, let me guess, we are two men?” Castiel sighs in a fit of pique. “You can be very dense, sometimes.”
“Um...” Dean is vying for help from Cas again, but he’s now staring anywhere but at them as if he’s intruding on a very bizarre moment.
“I figured we’d start getting into more of a habit of...you know—being a couple.”
They silently get dressed for bed.
“I think that traumatised me more than it did Jack,” Dean whispers.
Dean grumbles his assent as Cas reaches into their medical aid drawer—they have one under Cas’ insistence—and plucks out a tube of aloe vera gel.
“Dean, for god’s sake, it’s one stupid tree bauble!” Sam cries, his calm drilled too far. It erupts with his hands being thrown in the air and him turning to roll his eyes pointedly
He runs a hand through his hair that badly needs a cut, rubs a hand over his mouth, and looks away. Classic nervous Sam gesture.
! I’m—
“Okay, I get it, too much, too soon. It won’t get to that point. It’ll just be for a few weeks until Megatron moves onto her next obsession and Lisa and Ben thinks of me as just their friendly neighbourhood gay studio owner slash friend—”
“Technically, I kissed you—“
“I don’t think I’ve ever heard you say the word shitty so much in my life, Cas,” Dean says with a wry smirk to himself.
“What’s tonight?” Dean asks, feeling his anxiety build.
One would be if Chuck was dancing in the background, snapping everyone away Thanos-style to the tune of Highway to Hell.
Eileen sobers up somewhat, straightening and leaning towards Sam, shushing something loving and calming into his ear which makes him sigh loudly. “Fine,” he says, “sorry, everyone. I’m being—” he grins goofily, “Silly ‘cause I’m annoyed I lost my best teacher today. Lisa asked for time off—because—well, you know why.”
not your charity case, alright? Stop being so fucking nice and calm and logical and—can you just be human for a fucking sec? Can you try to at least pretend like you’re real—and not this—this caricature of some fucking guardian angel? Your whole flawless schtick is really getting old, man.”
Dean has taken up wearing more than a pair of boxers to bed, initially to Cas’ confusion and mild surprise. His refusal to offer an explanation only stresses the crinkle on Cas’ forehead every night that he pulls on a newly purchased set of sleepwear.
She lifts a brow at him curiously. “Your boyfriend called out for you and your first instinct was to hide. Okay, explainable, maybe. I can’t think of a reason as to why you’d bring me in here
“Seems like I forgot mine,” he admits with an equally frustrated look that Dean had been sporting earlier.
“Whoa.” Dean’s laughter becomes fraught with discomfort. “We—er—we didn’t, you know, exactly…”
“No, thank you,” Cas replies coolly. “I think I’ll be fine.”
“What’s mine is yours, hun.”
Dean groans, turning and glaring at his brother. “What?” he snaps.
“Hello, Dean.”
“Ouch. That was catty, Cas,” he taunts, choosing to grin at him to mask the simmering despondence.
Cas huffs, glancing sideaways, expression disgruntled. “It hardly matters what gender they are.”
“And you did it all for me,” Dean murmurs, smiling again. Cas can make him smile so easily when Dean lets it happen.
“Cas.”
“What are you sorry for?” They both say together again, in tandem.
Dean hides his face with his hands and groans. “You’re too good to me. Stop it. I’m always fucking up and you’re always here and—and I don’t deserve it.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean bolts upright and when he manages to look at Cas without his heart racing like it’s at its end days, Cas is beaming at him.
Sam snorts, as if the idea was laughable. “I’ve seen you check out guys’ asses, Dean, and Doctor Sexy? You’re bisexual, man.”
“Because he’s drunk, Dean, and that’s not even what he said. Of course I’m not talking to him. I’m not…talking to anyone but you. In that way.” Cas sighs, unwinds from Dean who misses the contact instantly but also starts to feel cold and resentful.
“Ever heard of knocking, bitch?”
“Mm,” Cas agrees. “You don’t need to console me, Dean. Like I said, she’s not someone I’d cry over.”
“Right,” Dean chokes back. Unconsciously, he wipes one hand down his bathrobe, at the wetness stuck to it from Cas’ damp chest slamming into him.
“Are we still—”
think that they were at least friends. He never realised she was just putting up with him.
“I partook in one date. Not dating. It’s one evening where the partner I shared my meal with didn’t throw spiteful remarks at me and look at me with resentment.”
“I shouldn’t have left things like that. I should have stayed and explained. You know, I really didn’t mean to imply—” he cuts himself off, eyeing his company warily even as they’ve all gone back to ignoring him and having conversations amongst themselves. “Well...you know.”
He leaves the beer. Shuts the fridge door with a firm slam.
Cas chuckles. “Yes, I suppose we do. You don’t generally speak so honestly to me unless one of us can forget the next day.”
The boy combs a hand through his dark hazel-blonde hair. “Well, you should always say what’s in your head.”
is far more conducive to vomit than alcohol poisoning.
The lightheadedness Cas is experiencing from a conversation he’s
“You’re so astute,” Cas comments dryly, picking up his crumpled top from the floor and slipping it on. Dean’s eyes were trained too tightly on his bare chest for him to feel comfortable.
“Let me just...let me brush my teeth first.”
“No, no,” Dean shakes his head, “It’s not—I’m not—it’s just a lot, okay? But we can get over it. We all need to stick together right now.” He knows he’s being too sentimental, eyes feeling wet, but he doesn’t care much right now. “We can get over it,” he repeats, “You can get over it, right? You’re just confused because of our profound bond or whatever you called it. It’s not the same as being in love with someone, man. You need to get over it."
This has been, by far, one of the best and most stressful weeks of Dean’s small life.
“Nothing’s good right now, Dean.” Sam chances a deep look into Dean’s defensive stance. “Except for you and Cas and your secret little looks and the thing with the hands.”
“No, I—this is your place. You were already watching something. You should stay,” he says, resting a hand on Dean’s shoulder to nudge him back down towards the couch. It’s a functional touch, but Dean savours it like a starving man chewing at stale breadcrumbs.
“What?” Dean asks.
“Shit, Cas, that one almost caught my eye!”
“My brother got engaged! Our spirits should all be up! We’re celebrating!”
Dean and Cas stare back at him blankly. He offers them a smile and lifts the mug he’s holding in one hand. “Can I have more hot cocoa, please?”
“Certifiably insane,” Cas corrects.
“What do you want, boy, a gold star?” Bobby asks gruffly.
“He’s finally going back to work tomorrow.” Cas says, setting his book aside on their coffee table. “They said they’ll be over again next weekend if we’re not doing anything. I asked them to stay for dinner tonight but I think they miss being home themselves.”
The pang of Charlie hits again, and it’s a little worse when he’s a bit drunk, so he struggles to hide the frown that crawls onto his face.
Dean puffs on an amused breath and stressfully works his fingers into fists, in and out. “Yeah, I guess not. I’m scared too, if that sounds saner. More like me. Really scared. Like I’m gonna throw up, but I’ve been feeling a lot of that lately so I guess it’s the new normal. Nauseous from my feelings for you and hangovers. Mostly you,” he rambles, bumping his hip into the table as he tries to cross it to get closer to Cas.
“I can’t believe you’d think a rebel angel like me wouldn’t do that to my own boyfriend,” he eventually says, blushing. “Especially when they can be as troublesome as you are.”
Cas huffs but then graces Dean with a small, shy smile once he’s spent twenty seconds pretending to be mildly annoyed. It rushes him with such a surge of affection that he can’t help but reach forwards to brush Cas’ dirty cheek with his own dirty thumb.
“Dean,” and there it is again. He could listen to Cas say his name as he drifts off into death, and he would still be happy for it. “Dean, I didn’t let you kiss me because if…if you do feel that way about me back, I would like you to accept yourself for it first.”
“About…the bauble?” Sam asks, coughing to cover up his bubbling laughter.
“Our secret?”
“Weird, Dean. Really fucking weird. What are you, boyfriends?”
“Shit,” Sam blinks, and he looks like something cleared in his brain as he sits up a bit straighter. “Shit, sorry. I didn’t mean—um. Look, man, I’m just a bit tipsy right now.” He says to Dean.
“I’m not talking about your feelings for the situation.”
Cas steps back too.
“That waitress though,” Dean whistles as they cross the door back into the bunker. “Did you see the way she kept looking at us? Bending over like that. We probably could have tag-teamed if we wanted.”
It’s also entirely different because Cas’ jaw is strong in his hands, and his nose, larger than most girls’, pokes into Dean’s cheek more significantly, letting him know that he’s definitely there. There’s a fine scratch of stubble too, surprisingly pleasurable.
“Not with that morning breath,” Cas retorts, then kicks him once in the groin. Light enough not to hurt but with enough pressure for Dean to wince. Not from pain. It’s, decidedly, from how his stomach flutters now when Cas comes near his crotch.
Castiel nods his assent, patting his jacket—borrowed from Dean—down. He curses too, a habit he’s sure he’s learnt from Dean.
Dean clears his throat dramatically, perches his ass onto the coffee table facing where Cas is sat, and relaunches back into his proposal, “all I’m saying is that it’s the best and least awkward clear out for both of us. I don’t want Ben to think I’m leaving his mom because I’m just—not that into her—”
It’s a brief, bitter thought. He winces at it and banishes the path of that kind of thinking as quickly as he can by following where Cas has scanned his eyes to.
Dean licks his lips nervously, trying and failing not to grin too obnoxiously.
“Oh,” Sam says, floored. “Can we—can we continue this very important talk right after—right after I go throw up?” His eyes widen as if he wanted them to imitate dinner plates. “Oh my god, no! Not like that! I’m just—I’m really, really hungover and I need to be sick because of that—not—not because of—”
Dean harrumphs, balls up the the pair of dirty boxers and throws it squarely at Cas’ head. He pulls them on under the sheet aggressively, holding his glaring contest with Dean the entire time.
His eyes have fluttered shut with a contented exhale so Dean takes the opportunity to drink in Cas, up close. They’ve often been close, too close, personal space too often forgotten even after their exchange in the bathroom where Dean explicitly warned Cas against it.
Cas’ impromptu confession dragged a lot of him and yet there’s still enough adrenaline pumping through his veins that he almost powers through to confess everything to Dean in its entirety.
“I certainly am not,” Cas says, suddenly falling serene and vacant, “and I can also assure you that I am not pining for you because of some kisses. The idea is absolutely ridiculous.”
Cas catches his arm tight though. Saves him from the plummet.
“What’s going on here? Why are you here and doing—that?” He laughs, a bit awkwardly like he’s not in on the joke just quite yet.
Bewilderedness eventually unfolds into a series of nervous thrills.
She laughs tearfully. “I think I just wanted a family. You’re so good with Ben. You’re so good to me, and I—I overlooked a few things I shouldn’t have. You and Cas,” she tugs Cas’ hand into hers. Cas only shares with her a look of terror, which Dean supposes she misinterprets because then she says, “you two shouldn’t have to hide anymore.”
When they park, he lets go and Cas actively distances himself again as they walk side by side in public. It’s both a relief that Cas understands and gut-wrenching that Dean still needs this.
“Castiel.”
“Well—then—” Dean flounders, “none of us should have one with our name on it! We shouldn’t be leaving Cas out like this—or—” he glares at Sam again for good measure, “when you were getting them, why didn’t you just special order one with his name on it? They do shit like that now. Internet—and shit.”
“Guess we’re sharing, honey,” Dean mutters groggily to Cas, discarding his shirt and trousers.
“Of course, my feelings for you,” Dean says as gently as he can. “I know I’ve been—vehement in denying anything between us…”
“Ugh,” Dean grunts, “no, dipshit,” he continues, frustrated. “I meant, why did you stop?”
—and that’s saying a lot, Dean, considering all the bullshit you’ve pulled over the years—this is the
“Cas,” he says, and it’s like a breath of relief.
“I thought we were having dinner tonight,” Dean adopts his critical tone and stares Sam down with a disapproving look, “and you’re here getting drunk after work with your wife. You’re both very mature, by the way.”
“Wow. Um. Okay,” Dean mumbles. “Just feels a bit like your quiet is...an expression of disapproval, of sorts.”
Cas grows into a pale shade of his normal pallor. “Oh, dear.”
“Dean, have you ever kissed a man before?” he asks softly.
“You’re drinking a lot more. You’re not talking to Cas. You camp out in your room like that and the bathroom is the only place you’re allowed to be. What’s going on, Dean?”
“Then nah, I’m not alright.”
“—and apparently she’s our best teacher. Very bendy.”
“No, I just—what I’m saying is we should probably learn how to kiss like lovers not like friends playing a joke—y’know?”
Neither fleece nor overcoat present, Castiel notices with discontent and concern.
The sound of something smashing or combusting. A cry of agonizing pain. Billie’s.
“Sure,
Cas glowers at her. “Perhaps you just aren’t a nice enough person to make an effort for others.”
Three days after ‘the incident’—where Dean has stopped speaking to Cas entirely, bar the occasional grunt of acknowledgement as they walk past each other in the bunker—he finds his loaned clothes freshly laundered and neatly folded, sitting on his dresser.
A muffled cry of protest emerges from where he assumes Cas is, and then he knows it’s where Cas is because first he sees his chin, and then his cheeks, and then his eyes.
Dean bumps his knee with Cas’, testing the waters, and thank god, no spark or electricity or
Castiel smiled sadly and hesitated to add his thought. He cocked his head to the side and raised an eyebrow. “So do those in this life, Dean…You can’t deny good moments in fear of the bad ones.”
Shrugging his shoulders, Dean dared a glance over, his insecurity showing in the way he laughed it off with a half-smile. “Not like I was advertising it. I wasn’t really comfortable with…you know, myself.”
Sam smiled bigger and scratched the back of his neck with nervous energy. “Yeah. Uh, tell Dean to not forget the Spring Mix. He may not eat rabbit food but the rest of us do.”
“She beat him and stabbed him many times with the Angel blade then just as she raised her blade to land the killing blow…many of the new choir rose up and stormed the group. It was quite dramatic…” Debriel added when Castiel didn’t seem keen to elaborate.
“Oh, does your phone not work in the bunker?” Dean said with niggling suspicion inching into his voice.
The room was silent a beat before Dean growled out, “You didn’t finish the story. You left out the part where you were desperate enough for help that you let a random woman take you home. Said woman then had sex with you and tortured you. Then she killed you in front of us the next day. Don’t leave it out on my account…” The uncomfortable silence in the room was deafening before Mary shifted her seat on the couch, leaning her elbows on her knees.
Cas gave Naomi a tired look. “Nothing I do is for you or the other Angels, so I’m glad we have that clear. After what you did to me, what you made me do to Dean….”
dying? What’s going on, Dean?” Cas’ words had the interesting effect of making Dean’s lip tug up at the corners into an amused smile.
Aberia looked again at Castiel with uncertainty. He shrugged as his body slightly relaxed. He answered her unspoken inquiry, seeing the confusion in her face. “Sometimes as a social construct and sometimes purely for pleasure. Not everything has to be done because it is a necessity.”
Dean rolled his eyes and continued packing for him as he huffed out an exaggerated sigh. “Apparently everyone in the bunker has decided we are insufferable and unbearable with the heart eyes and have requested we leave for a few days and get away for a bit.”
“Very well, if that’s what you want,” Debriel looked like he wanted to say more but she nodded her head, and his mouth drew up in a tight line. He sighed and looked to the others, who gave a mixture of nods and noncommittal shrugs which he found unhelpful before turning back to Cas and Aberia. “Then I suppose we have no further reason to delay our departure…Commander…” Debriel clasped Cas’ elbow and he did the same. The remaining Angels repeated the gesture, pressed their fists to their chests and nodded as they ascended the staircase. Debriel stopped and looked down from the top of the stairs. “And if you get into trouble and need our assistance at any time…”
“They’re missing?” Jody said immediately as she picked up on Mary’s words, checking herself for her gun even before getting confirmation.
“Dean, are you hurt? I thought I was too late…” Castiel said with concern evident in his tone. His eyes searched Deans. “Your soul is back where it should be,” he said with certainty before healing the nail marks on Dean’s face. He suddenly realized how close they were and took a step back, leaving Dean leaning against the tree, perplexed.
“No, but-“Dean stuttered out, his cheeks flushing and making the freckles across his nose stand out even in the soft lamp light.
Dean, however, gave out an exasperated huff. “Frozen, Cas. It’s kinda popular, but yes.”
“You need help with the chest piece? Everyone else is suited up and ready to go. We found a few extra Angel blades stashed in the armory. I thought I remembered tucking some of them away after some of our Angel issues before. There were enough for us measly humans to each get one.” Dean laughed softly but Castiel finally turned and his laughter died away. Dean's heart immediately began to race at the seriousness on Cas' face.  “What’s wrong?”
“I’m a captive audience Castiel, if you’ve got a question, ask it,” Chuck spoke over his shoulder as he scribbled, reading Cas’ thoughts.
“How do you come by that assumption?” Aberia said as she studied them together, her brows knitted together in a mixture of annoyance and confusion. “We are traitors to the cause of Heaven in her eyes and the eyes of the other Angels in her charge."
Dean let out a huff of a laugh. “I mean, if you’re comparing numbers, you’re definitely an old geezer.”
out of line? They’re out there doing
Dean unbuckled his seat belt and was grabbing at Cas’ arm in concern before seconds had passed. “Cas!?” The concern in his head was overshadowed only by his anger that Heaven was the one doing this to him.
Castiel shook his head forcefully. “No, it’s nothing like that. Nothing like my connection with you either, Jack. I am not their creator. Much more their teacher. I feel the same for them as I used to feel for my flock. There is a comfort to being around those of my own kind…. but nothing like being home, with you.” He looked to the Winchesters as a whole.
“Your heart is beating so fast…” Cas whispered softly In Dean’s ear as he laid a hand on his chest. "Are you okay?”
“What…” Dean began but Chuck held up his hand and he fell silent. Chuck pointed to the bar, where the waiter was filling their drink order, and held a finger to his lips for silence. As the waiter brought back the drinks, Dean’s stomach growled loudly.
“You’re sure it’s a demon?” Mary asked as they spoke outside the warehouse. The towering building with it's cracked and boarded up windows cast an eerie shadow over the group.
He needed this trip but he needed all of the people he loved to be safe and on the same plane of existence more. He glanced over at Sam, who was leaned against the passenger seat, looking relaxed and relieved. When was the last time they just gone out without a hunt as the catalyst? He had to do better…they all had to do better. This was the only life they got and they needed to have a little fun before they died, because who the hell knew when that would be. He focused his eyes forward at the long stretch of highway before them and decided he would try his best to enjoy their time away. Cas would tell him he should.
Cas hesitated only a moment before replying, “Yes,” in his gravelly tone, even as he swallowed nervously.
Castiel’s frown deepened. “That’s what I’m afraid of. I’m not that important to anyone. He doesn’t need to risk himself."
“Then….then why are you still here?” Dean put a hand on his shoulder then, willing him to look him in the eye.
Cas’ eyes lit up with excitement. “Food and television with my family,” He said with little hesitation.
“This one I wasn’t entirely sure about but thought it was a safe option. I admit your relationship with the Impala…” Cas side eyed Dean who narrowed his eyes and cleared his throat. “with Baby,” Dean nodded his head and Cas rolled his eyes playfully. “Your relationship with “Baby,” Cas said in air quotes this time, “borders on the eccentric. However, I have seen your mechanic skills without any schooling, and I thought you might enjoy tinkering with it in your free time here.” Cas walked into the pulled-up garage door and Dean raised his eyebrows in surprise and appreciation. It had a full wall of different tools, all neatly hung on pegboard, and several bright red tool chests pushed against one wall. It was literally a mechanics dream, with spare parts laid out on a table by the other wall. There was enough room in it to work on two cars at once if he chose. He felt Cas’ eyes on him as he walked around the garage and his hands shook. It had the reassuring smell of grease and gasoline and it brought him immediately back to the times he’d spent tinkering on Baby in Bobby’s yard and in the bunker garage. The nostalgia, however, wasn’t painful now. He had infinite opportunities now…something he was still wrapping his head around.
“Dean, I….” Cas began but Aberia’s voice from down the hall interrupted them. She was calling impatiently for him.
“Nice monologue. I give it a 7 out of 10. I gave extra points for the neat voice changing trick,” Dean said firmly, this voice not reflecting the adrenaline racing through him. He’d been stupid and now he’d pay for it. What was she…not vampire. Big rows of sharp teeth. Shit. He’d seen this before but it’d been forever. Voice manipulation…Shit. Shit. Shit. He shot one bullet into her skull. The force threw her back a moment, but she shook like a dog and came forward again. Okay, a headshot was not going to work. That was his go-to method when he wasn’t sure what would work. She raced toward him, her mouth opened wide. She was incredibly fast and before he knew it, he was pinned against a pine tree, the bark biting into the backs of his arms.
Castiel stood surrounded by every Angel that could be spared to witness the proceedings. That included every one of the Angels he’d been training. He found Aberia’s eyes in the crowd. They locked eyes, her face blank except for a slight tightening around the eyes...and he looked away. He couldn’t let Naomi single her out for anything, and he knew she would exploit any and all weaknesses she could wrap her hands around. His hands were still cuffed, and his wings were held out and away from his body now by two Angels per wing. Naomi had forced him to his knees, but he kept his chin jutted and his eyes up, never showing the defeat she would love to see. His eyes remained sharp as he scanned the room, not knowing what for but forever vigilant and his mind buzzing with possible ways this could end.
“Got it…” Dean said with an anticipatory tightness in his stomach. He put his foot on the gas and made sure to only go 5 over the speed limit.
Dean locked eyes with Cas as he opened them and the relief he felt at the understanding in the Angel’s eyes was palpable. “I love you, Cas. We’re finally on the same page here, you see. No more walls. No more obstacles. No more misunderstandings. You see?”
Mary knocked on the hotel room door. Nothing. She knocked again, louder, as her impatience and nervous energy manifested. Speaking through the door, she let her voice carry. “Dean. Castiel. It’s me. I was checking on you since it’s been a minute…” Still nothing. She pressed her ear to the door and silence was her only answer. She hummed in question and picked up her phone. Still no responses from her text message from five minutes ago. “Where the
Aberia shook her head even as she stopped short at Dean and Sam's interference. She looked to Cas, who had stepped around Dean's attempt to block him, his fight or flight instinct kicking in, as any good human's does in a fight. “I would not sully myself by touching you, so your human can calm down." Her words made even Jack and Mary stand now, watching her with angry eyes. Jack's explanation of disapproval was lost in her continued words. "You were looked up to by thousands of us. We risked our lives to save you, and you threw everything you were away.”
The clerk nodded her head as she glanced down at her computer and tapped several keys before she looked back up, polite interest on her face. “I’ve got a suite with two full beds available for that time frame.”
“Cas, if I’d known asking you to move into my room would turn you on so much…” Dean groaned as he slid his hands up Cas’ shirt. Cas chuckled darkly and rutted up against him, making the smirk slide off Dean’s fade.
“I’m doing my job, like everyone else,” Dean said with a tone that implied he’d repeated this line numerous times.
Castiel smiled softly, averting his eyes nervously as he kept his hands folded in his lap. “You know very well that’s only one part of me…and one thing I never am with you is confident.”
They were surrounded by old oak trees on a small dirt path. The weather was perfect, warm with a soft breeze making the dandelions he saw blow softly. He could hear bird song and the occasional soft buzz of a non-blood sucking insect nearby. He looked around him more and there were what appeared to be fruit trees on his left, heavy with picture perfect apples and pears, and a structure, a house, could be viewed in the gap of tree down the road.
Cas smiled. “You’re the idiot in this relationship.”
Every night, Dean and Benny slept on the ground as close as possible to the fire, waiting until it inevitably fizzled out and they had to depend on their thin jackets to keep them warm. Dean learned to block out the noise of screeching and wailing that came from deep in the trees over time, allowing him to get a few hours of sleep after their light source disappeared for the day. He found comfort in praying to Cas. He had no idea if Cas was listening, but it made him feel safer as he laid there, everything surrounding him engulfed by the dark Purgatory sky, rocks pressing into his back.
” Dean exclaimed.
. Leave it.”
“So, um. When did I fall in love with you, then?” Dean’s mouth was dry.
Benny laughed from behind Dean, clapping a large hand on his shoulder. “I’d say it was a little more than a hookup, D.”
Dean finished the walk to his bedroom.
A blue light shone from the top of a nearby cliff. It was almost blinding, but Dean couldn’t help but stare with relief. They were going home. Cas was coming home with him. Benny’s voice startled Dean, forcing him to look away from the portal. “There it is. You ready, Dean?”
beard off my face.” Dean rubbed at his chin, which was now layered with thick stubble. Normally, he would shave at
“You want to dance?” Cas asked, surprised by the request. Dean couldn’t bring himself to care. He didn’t care what anyone else thought. He only cared about getting Cas closer.
Benny tipped his hat to Dean and began his journey in the opposite direction. Dean could only stand and watch, unable to move.
Dean felt anger well up inside him but pushed it down. He wasn’t letting Cas get away from him. Not again. No matter what it took. He grabbed Cas by the shoulder and held up a hand as though he could stop the conversation from continuing further. “Cas, I’m not leaving you here.”
“You know what, Dean? I’m not doing well. I’m miserable. I don’t know how to be human. I had to learn how to brush my teeth from the homeless man I met on my way to the bunker who was kind enough to provide me with toothpaste. I don’t understand why you kicked me out and then decided to come rub it in my face when I was finally doing okay without you. Do you know how many nights I spent sleeping on the floor of the Gas-N-Sip, crying? Not understanding what it meant to feel emotion strong enough that it caused my eyes to water?” Cas gestured to his eyes, finally pausing for a moment, “You seem like you’re doing fine without me, but if you cared enough to ask you would know that I’m not. So good for you, I guess.”
“Dean, stop thinking.” Cas placed one hand on Dean’s shoulder and the other on his jaw. “Tell me to stop if you don’t want this.”
“What’s going on between you and the angel? Lovers’ spat?” Benny kneeled down next to Dean, who was struggling to build a fire. It rained that day, which meant any potential kindling he could find was soaked to the core and impossible to work with. Frustrated, Dean threw the mess of twigs and rocks to the ground and stood up, staring down at Benny.
me and then go and die on me? I didn’t ask you to sacrifice yourself for me. I didn’t ask for any of this. You said, ‘happiness is in just saying it’, but what if I’m not happy with just saying it? What if I want to have? You said you couldn’t have me, Cas, but you didn’t even ask. You never asked. You should have asked.
The past few days have been nothing but bickering between Benny and Cas. Dean can’t figure out what the problem is. They’d only just met, and Benny had even saved Cas’ life a few days previously. A Leviathan pinned Cas to the ground while Dean was occupied by two others. Benny moved in at the last second to slice the Leviathan’s head off, moments before it tore Cas apart. Dean remembered watching the whole thing from a few feet away, his heart beating uncomfortably fast in his chest.
“I know, Dean. It’s okay.” Cas pressed his palm to Dean’s chest, and a calming warmth spread through his body as it healed. “She must have known that we weren’t actually in a relationship when we first checked into the hotel, but recognized that things had changed after…”
Dean coughed and said, “Yeah, looks great, pal. We should get going, though.”
“Thank you, Dean.”
The clerk eyed them carefully, and Dean felt the urge to break his nose. Cas, however, began stroking Dean’s hip, and it suddenly took all of Dean’s energy to keep himself upright. They were given two sets of keys and made their way toward the elevator.
Dean lifted an eyebrow. “Or?”
Benny had a look on his face that could almost be described as sympathetic. Dean didn’t know what to do with that. A vampire, sympathetic to him, because he’s in love with his best friend who is a man. Or is inside of a man’s vessel. Does that make Dean gay? Dean shook his head. That’s a problem for another day. Maybe he could ask Sammy about it.
“Let’s go on a vacation.”
“None,” Cas responded through gritted teeth.
Dean took a deep breath and closed his eyes. It’s fine. Cas is borrowing his clothes now, and it’s fine. Two dudes can be best friends and pretend to be in a relationship. It’s not like Dean is gay or anything, but he’s totally cool with gay people. Some of his friends are gay.
By the time they were close to Jack’s first location request, Cas was starting to get a little grumpy from the lack of sleep. It was day three of their trip now. Some days, Dean would stop at a motel for them to stay in, but yesterday he chose to drive through the night. Cas stayed up with him, fighting against Dean’s argument that at least one of them should get some shut eye. “Dean, if I don’t stay awake, you’ll fall asleep behind the wheel. You can’t get by on four hours anymore.”
No matter what, though, Cas wouldn’t budge. He complained and picked fights with both Benny
Castiel leaned in and ghosted his lips over Dean’s. Dean felt a shiver run through his body as Cas’ paused against his lips for a brief moment. He felt his brain catch up to his body and wrapped his arms around the angel’s waist, pressing him into the nearest wall and attaching his mouth to Cas’. Cas’ tongue moved across Dean’s bottom lip and Dean opened up to let him in. This was the best kiss Dean had ever experienced. He never wanted it to end.
Dean looked up from what must have been the fiftieth book he picked up that day. He pressed his tongue to the inside of his cheek before answering. “Yeah. It’s still there. Don’t really wanna talk about that right now.”
Dean left Cas for the bathroom. He stared at himself in the mirror. He didn’t look any different. Except… happier, maybe. He looked like a man who finally had everything he’d ever wanted, everything he never knew he wanted until this very moment. He loved Cas. Cas loved him back.
Even though Cas’ reaction was less than ideal, all Dean could think about was how much he wanted to do it again. He wanted Cas’ hands on him, he wanted to feel Cas’ skin on his, he wanted to kiss Cas anywhere the angel would let him. He wanted all of that with Cas. He wanted it to be real.
“We aren’t good for each other. This was a stupid idea. I don’t know why we even thought we could try.”
, to say the least.
Cas gasped as Dean crashed their mouths together, his palms pressing to either side of Cas’ face. Oh, he was so fucked. This was quite possibly one of his worst ideas yet. This was also simultaneously one of his
“Cas, it’s Iris.”
Cas grimaced, but slowly nodded in agreement.
Dean sighed. “Still not a hundred percent, but that’ll happen with demon possession.”
Happy New Year, Cas.
yesterday.”
“These are questions people will ask us, Dean.”
Cas walked the entire 2 miles to the bunker on his broken ankle. When he saw the lot leading up to the bunker, relief immediately washed over him. Suddenly, he felt a vibration in his pocket. Of course, he hadn’t realized his cell phone was still with him. Pulling it from his jacket pocket, the screen lit up to reveal fifty-five voicemails from Dean. Cas approached the bunker door slowly and pressed on Dean’s name instead of knocking. “Dean, I’m outside. Let me in. I’m hurt.”
Dean looked into Castiel’s eyes for a moment before quickly flicking down to his lips. It would be so easy to lean in… but he has to figure some things out first. “Cas… what did you mean by your last message?”
Cas apologized before continuing his work mindlessly, imagining what it might be like to quit his job right now and leave to hunt with Dean every day, so that he might somehow prove his usefulness to the man he considered a best friend.
Sam didn’t expect that. He’d always suspected that Cas might have feelings for Dean, but he wasn’t so sure about his brother. Dean was always so reserved when it came to expressing himself. He barely ever told Sam he loved him. Granted, Sam never really told Dean, either. Sam pushed his hand through his hair and attempted to collect his thoughts. “Do you love him?” Sam asked quietly, avoiding Dean’s eyes.
“Cas, buddy? Does that sound okay?”
Dean snorted. “You callin’ me an old man?”
Dean threw his head back and laughed, choosing to answer Cas by pressing their lips together again. As Cas’ body pressed against his in the front seat of the Impala, Dean sighed as a sense of calm washed over him. Maybe happiness was in the having.
Oh, fuck.
Cas smiled, content to sit in the front seat of the Impala, palm pressed to the back of Dean’s hand, for the rest of the evening. They were soon interrupted by their son though, hands full of burgers and fries with a huge grin on his face. Sam followed soon after with a salad and a water bottle. Dean rolled his eyes at him before shoving a handful of fries into his mouth.
“I don’t want your pity, Dean. Allowing you to pay for this hotel room is more than I should have let happen.” Cas clenched his fists against the side of his jeans, feeling sick at the idea of Dean staying here with him, pathetically human. Powerless. And yet he didn’t really want Dean to leave him again, either.
’. Reid placed a glass of amber liquid in front of Dean. “I don’t know much about it. The police are being really cagey with us. My opinion? They don’t have any leads, but they won’t admit to it.”
Sam and Cas made their way to Dean, prepared for the worst. What they weren’t prepared for, however, was an empty room, with Dean’s chair kicked over and his restraints undone. Sam and Cas looked at each other, mouths open in an ‘O’ shape.
Iris eyed them both curiously before gesturing to the other side of the booth, allowing them to join her. Dean puts a hand on Castiel’s shoulder to help him into the booth before sliding in next to him.
forgive you.”
Dean closed his eyes, savoring the moment. “Me too, man.”
A shriek suddenly cut through the lobby, and Dean’s hand quickly moved to his gun before he realized what was going on. Iris, dark brown hair in a messy bun and wearing water-soaked sweatpants, marched up to the front desk. “This hotel is a disaster!” She yelled, pointing at the man sitting behind the front desk, “My toilet just
There was a knock at Cas’ door. He stiffened immediately, not looking forward to a conversation with either Winchester brother. Sam stuck his head in. “Were you gonna tell me you figured out how to fix Dean? He just walked up to me and asked about getting some pie and I almost fell out of my chair.”
. He wanted to take his time and memorize every noise Cas made, every move of his hands along Cas’ skin, every impression Cas’ fingers left on his body. He needed to tell Cas the truth, needed to tell him the way he makes him feel both insane and completely comfortable at the same time. He broke away from Cas’ lips with a
Cas was still there. Standing right in front of him.
“I only have my eyes on one girl, but she’s gone. And she’s not coming back,” Iris said quietly.
Tears were streaming down Dean’s face now, mouth open in shock as he attempted to process everything Castiel was telling him. There was no time, though. The Empty appeared behind Dean with an ugly gurgling sound. He turned around briefly, chest heaving with fear as he understood what was about to happen. Cas reached out to rest his hand against Dean’s shoulder before moving up to his cheek. Cas felt, for the first time in years, completely weightless. He had been right; happiness was in saying it. Happiness was in knowing Dean understood how loved he is.
Dean flipped the mixtape over in his hands to read what Cas had written on it. Apparently Cas was getting a lot of use out of the rainbow pen set Sam bought him last week, because ‘CASTIEL’S TOP 13 TAYLOR TRAXX’ was spelled out in bright purple ink on the front of the tape. Dean smiled at Cas’ loopy handwriting before clearing his throat and asking, “Taylor?”
“I fucked up, Sam. He kissed me. For real, this time. And I yelled at him. I don’t know why I yelled at him. It was like something came over me. I can’t do any of this relationship shit, I always fuck it up.” Dean felt his eyes fill with tears. He blinked quickly to make them go away.
– bed. “What do you mean, practice?”
The room was nice. He couldn’t deny it, especially compared to their typical motel digs. In the center of the room, however, was the single king bed that has quickly become the most daunting task Dean has ever faced. Vampires were child’s play in comparison to sleeping in a slightly-too-small bed with his best friend, apparently.
The only tape player Dean still had was in the Impala, so he grabbed a jacket and shoved the tape into his pocket. He managed to avoid Sam on his way out, which meant that he avoided having to give a lame excuse for going to sit in his car for thirty minutes or so by himself. He opened the door to the Impala and slid onto the bench before pulling the tape out of his pocket and sliding it into the player. A twangy country beat immediately sounded from the speakers and Dean groaned. How was he going to get through a whole mixtape of
“Wait, there is… There is one thing she’s afraid of. There’s one thing strong enough to stop her. When Jack was dying, I made a deal to save him,” Cas said.
The man at the front desk held his hands up in surrender, trying to calm Iris. He unlocked the door behind him, grabbing a basket of supplies, before following Iris back upstairs.
out.”
“Let’s call it a night, man. We can go down to the bar and get something to eat. Relax a bit.”
Dean looked at the knife, and then at Benny. “You sure that’s a good idea? What if you cut me and you can’t control yourself?”
When they finally reached the motel a painfully silent five hours later, Dean went straight to the bathroom, in part to avoid his brother but also providing him the first chance he’s had all day to brush his teeth. Indoor plumbing is something he would never take for granted again after his stint in Purgatory.
Once inside, Dean sat on the corner of his –
ever feel the same for Castiel, though. Cas knew that. Why else would Dean kick him out of the bunker? Now that Cas didn’t have the ability to heal Dean and Sam or help them fight, Dean didn’t want him around. It made sense. Cas didn’t blame him.
on me. You know I’m bad at stuff like this… so just give me a minute.” Dean cleared his throat. “You told me that I changed you… well, you changed me too. I never had a best friend before you. Hell, I never had any friends at all. Sammy and I moved around so much that I never had a chance. I always thought attachments made you weak. But you… you showed me that it’s the opposite. You made me stronger. You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me. You’re my best friend, Cas.  I don’t want anything to change between us if that’s not what you want, but I… I do want things to change. I love you. I’ve loved you for a long time and I just didn’t know what to do with those feelings. You’re worth it, though. I’ll start writing in a journal and reflecting and shit if that’s what it takes to show you how much you mean to me. I love you.”
“Him. Of all the humans in the world, you chose that arrogant one,” Aberia grumbled as she followed behind him.
“Why me?” Castiel said softly.
“Enough. I’ve made myself clear,” Castiel barked back abruptly. Dean raised an eyebrow and looked between them as Aberia scowled.
The car’s tires crunched under the white rock of the gravel parking lot. Dean pulled in and put the car in park before looking over at Castiel. He’d seemed to increase in pain the closer they got to the meeting location. Cas gritted his teeth behind closed lips, making the muscles in his jaw pop. He turned the key in the ignition and the sudden silence was almost tangible. It was hard to believe that Cas was being all but deafened by a sound he couldn’t hear. They both opened their doors, though Castiel wasn’t as steady on his feet as Dean would have liked. They met at the front of the car and looked around. The park was empty at this time of night, but Cas walked forward with purpose.
Chuck walked around the room curiously, glancing at the full hot tub and the disheveled bed that he pretended to skim his eyes over and not see for all of their composure. He turned back to look at him, still standing within arm's reach of Cas. “This isn’t a process you’ve seen before is it?”
Dean lugged his full duffel bag to Castiel’s room and dropped it by the doorway. Cas looked up from the laptop on his lap and gave an inquiring look. Sleeping in separate rooms was complete torture but they knew they couldn’t be trusted to share and not do anything. It wouldn’t be fair. It was early morning and Castiel had expected Dean to still be sleeping. He'd been sleeping till at least 9am these days and Cas internal clock new the sun had not yet begun to rise.
“Then why would Chuck let her have anything to do with the new angels?” Sam added.
enough for this.
“it’s not a trick.  It’s me. Hello, Dean,” Cas said with a happy smile, his eyes darting around Dean’s face, trying to memorize it after being gone so long. “You’ve grown a beard. That’s new.”
“Well, what can we do while we wait?” Dean turned, hearing the odd inflection in Cas' tone, and narrowed his eyes in immediate suspicion. His tone dripped of false innocence. He caught Cas' eyes staring at him as he leaned over the tub. He didn't feel particularly sexy in his t-shirt and flannel pajama pants but by Cas' expression, you'd have thought he was parading around naked.
Castiel is given a choice for his own happiness, but there is not one easy choice. Dean expresses his concern for Cas and his fears.
Jack nodded his head as well, contained excitement brewing behind his eyes that he was not able to disguise. “I can tell Cas what we're doing if you want. If it would make you feel better about leaving.”
“They fell,” Cas said with a tremble in his voice as his eyes tracked down Dean’s body. “Or so the stories say. If I knew an Angel that broke that law, Naomi removed that memory from me.” Dean was shaking his head before Cas finished talking.
“Of…of course, the rest of your party is waiting,” the hostess said as she lead them to a booth in the back of the restaurant. It was isolated from the main area...far more isolated than either man liked. The hostess let them go ahead of her and she spoke quietly, “The waiter will be over soon to take your drink order,” as she scampered away.
Dean glowered slightly but conceded with an eye roll. “Fair enough.” He tossed the Impala keys on the war room table and gestured up the stairs. “After you then.” Castiel turned and headed back up the stairs with Dean right behind. No one else might notice but Cas had a bit more spring in his step going into the precarious situation with back up. He’d never ask for it, but he could appreciate it nonetheless. As the door of the Bunker closed behind them, it echoed into the quiet of the night and Jack and Sam were none the wiser.
Dean had only seen something like this once before. He and Bobby…alone in that barn…He winced as a loud, whining noise screamed through the room. He couldn’t even cover his ears due to the restraints. “It’s….” Dean began as hundreds of bodies streamed into the coliseum through all entrances. He squinted, confused, as they were all humanoid bodies, but they appeared to be wearing armor. It glinted silver in the remaining sparking lights and sunbeams, and there were….wings…wings everywhere. Wings in every shade of cream, white, and gold he’d ever seen. His brain couldn’t even make sense of it.
Castiel looked up and shook his head. “If you knew me, truly knew me, you wouldn’t feel that way.”
He moved his thumb away and slid in his pointer finger, moving it slowly in a “come here” motion as he rubbed against Cas’ prostate. Cas almost rocketed off the bed and Dean had to all but hold him down, his mouth still locked around his cock. The lights got very bright and Dean winced and covered his head with a hand instinctively but as he stilled his finger, the lights went back to normal and he slid slowly up and off. “Cas…” Dean said accusingly, with humor, as Cas sat up, wild eyed with his hair in disarray and glared at Dean.
“Turn off Netflix and get packing, Angel” Dean said, still bleary eyed from sleep. Castiel could tell he had not been awake long and he could smell coffee brewing in the kitchen. He tilted his head in confusion and closed down his computer, throwing his legs over the side of the bed.
“We’re being kicked out of the bunker,” Dean said as he rooted through the stocked wardrobe that Castiel rarely used and started tossing stuff in the empty duffel he’d brought in his free hand. Castiel watched with confusion as Dean grabbed up garments he’d never worn. Jeans, sleep pants, a leather jacket Dean had thrifted for him in case of undercover work.
Castiel’s eyes were dull and resigned. “Dean…. will you…will you explain to Jack and Sam? I wish I could have said goodbye but…”
“FUCK YOU GUYS! I’M GOING TO EILEEN’S AND I’M TAKING JACK WITH ME!” came the booming, very annoyed voice of Sam down the hall.
“How did I not know that?” Cas said just as softly, his tone no longer accusatory, only full of true curiosity.
Unexpected consequences of Castiel's time in Heaven make his relationships with the other Angels more strained, while Dean hunts with Mary.
As the door closed behind them, Dean sighed. He would have liked to have gone with them and seen Jack’s face at the fireworks. More so than going to some dive bar like in year’s past. A small smile creeped on his lips. He guessed this was as close to being a dad as he’d ever get….and he was enjoying it more than he thought he ever would.
Cas….Dean thought in his head and his stomach tightened almost painfully. I’m sorry, Cas. I’m so sorry….
yourself?” Castiel nodded solemnly, his eyes pulled up from the floor to lock onto his, shame at his confession prevalent in his eyes.
Smiling softly, Dean rubbed the back of his neck with his palm, both in discomfort as well as the need to stop himself from reaching out to touch Cas. They’ve cuddled, they’ve kissed, but Dean still doesn’t know where they stand.
“C’mon. It’ll be fun.” Dean reached out a hand. Cas took it, a shy smile appearing on his face. However, as soon as they made it out to the dance floor, a slower song began to play. Dean could tell it made Cas even more apprehensive, so he reached out and grabbed the angel by the hips, bringing them together. They began to sway back and forth softly, Cas taking the lead. Dean leaned over to rest his head on Cas’ shoulder.
Just let me have this,” Cas begged, pressing open-mouthed kisses to Dean’s neck, “If you’re going to leave again, just give me this one thing.”
Sam held his hands up in surrender, turning to look out the window as they continued down the highway toward their next case.
Dean cleared his throat. It was now or never. “I’ve never felt this way about anyone before, Cas. I’m terrified. I’m terrified of losing you. I’m terrified of saying the wrong thing. I’ve already said the wrong thing, and it will never happen again. I know you probably can’t forgive me for all of the stupid shit I said, but I’m so sorry, Cas. I’ve told you before, you’re better at this stuff than I am. You’re better than being human than me and you aren’t even human, and that’s what I l- that’s what I love about you. I love you, man.”
“Mornin’, sunshine,” Dean said.
You’re back. I got you back. I got to hold you in my arms for the first time in so long. It doesn’t even feel real. I missed you so much. I can tell there’s something going on between us, though. I think you’re waiting for me to say it first. You know I’m no good with words, which is why I’ve decided that I’m going to let you read these letters I wrote to you. So, Cas. I love you. So much. I’m sorry it took us so long to get here. Never leave me again.
Cas seemed to notice Dean stiffening and moved to wrap his arm around Dean’s waist again, rubbing his fingers along his hip in the same way he did yesterday. Dean immediately felt himself relax, reassured by the small motion.
Dean nodded sympathetically. He’s been there more times than Reid would ever believe.
“It sounds like a possible aggressive spirit. About a three-hour drive, so it’s not too bad. I was thinking you and Cas could take this one. Eileen and I are on the verge of a breakthrough with that case we’ve been working on, and I wouldn’t want to leave her hanging.”
“Doesn’t count. Benny’s a vampire.”
Sam jumped up from his seat, tempering his own excitement for Dean’s sake. “I have an idea. Go get the jacket.”
Cas couldn’t help but stare at Dean as he impersonated yet another FBI agent at the scene of the crime. Castiel knew he had strong feelings for Dean. He’s known since he pulled Dean out of Hell. It wasn’t until he became human, though, that he learned of the true nature of these feelings. Dean laughed at something another police officer said, and Cas grinned too. Dean was beautiful. Cas wished he could tell Dean how beautiful he is. Dean couldn’t,
Sam could see a flicker of hope pass through Dean’s eyes for a brief moment, before it disappeared again behind a stoic face. Sam decided not to say anything further, instead collecting various items from the room and placing them on a nearby table. Dean walked over, catching Sam press his finger into some red ink and creating a sigil he had never seen before on the wood of the table. Sam placed the bowl holding Cas’ dried blood in the middle of the sigil. He began the spell, speaking in Latin and holding his hands out above the mess of materials. Dean watched on, unsure if he was scared that Cas wouldn’t come back, or that he might.
“That was… a close one,” Cas stated.
Dean frowned. “Anything else?”
Dean raised his eyebrows and said, “Oh, is that so?” before leaning in again, capturing Cas in another kiss that they both grinned into. Cas was overwhelmed. He never thought, in a million years, that this was how their story would come together. Cas still had a lot to learn about being in a relationship, and he knew Dean didn’t have much experience with it either. He understood now, though, that they had plenty of time to figure it out, and his best friend would be at his side through it all.
Iris gave them a funny look. “What kind of experience?”
Cas stood up and walked over to the bed, handing Dean a piece of paper that had been clipped from a newspaper. “While you were sleeping I looked through some of the articles we stole. It looks like Marisa was in an abusive relationship, and most believe her husband is the one who killed her. There was never enough evidence to arrest him.”
.” Cas felt an immense weight lift off his shoulders as he finally expressed what he had been hiding all these years. He would do anything for Dean, including lay down his life. He’s done it before, and he’d do it again and again. It would be worth it to know that Dean would live a full, successful life, even if Cas would no longer be there to see it.
“My husband was… not a very nice man. You’ve seen the articles now, yes? He thought I was flirting with another man and decided that was enough reason to
Dean rolled his shoulders back to shake the thought from his head as he reached up to close the trunk of the Impala. Cas and Jack strolled up to the car a moment later, arms full of suitcases and backpacks.
Dean couldn’t help but wonder though… if this meant that he was actually ‘into men’, like Benny suggested so long ago. He really didn’t have time for a sexuality crisis right now. They still had to find Cas. Dean pushed the thought to the back of his head, making it a problem for his future self to deal with.
“Love you too, Dean. Now go collect your boyfriend.”
Marisa laughed. “No, she’s nestled in here still,” she said, pointing to her chest, “I’m just in charge right now.”
“I do not know.”
Sam mimed a gagging motion at the display, while Jack looked on with glee. “I didn’t know you and Dad were married!”
Dean’s heart broke for Iris, but he needed more information. “What do you mean Laurel wasn’t herself?”
“I know. I know how you see yourself, Dean. You see yourself the same way our enemies see you. You’re destructive, and you’re angry, and you’re broken. You’re ‘daddy’s blunt instrument’. And you think that hate and anger… that’s what drives you, that’s who you are. It’s not. And everyone who knows you sees it. Everything you have ever done, the good and the bad, you have done for love. You raised your little brother for love. You fought for this whole world for love. That is who you are. You’re the most caring man on Earth. You are the most selfless, loving human being I will ever know.”
Dean winked at him and Cas couldn’t help the small smile that spread across his face. “I can wait until you’re off the clock. I’ll pick you up. What time?”
“What kind of room would you like, sir?” the front desk clerk asked after Dean requested a room.
Dean let out a breath he hadn’t realized he was holding. Cas loved him back. “Let’s get out of here.”
Sam’s mouth fell open and his head moved to the side abruptly like he had been slapped in the face. “He what?”
“Please, Jack. You gotta bring him back. He’s your dad, for God’s sake.” Dean flinched at what he said. Maybe bringing God up right now wasn’t the most tactful strategy.
Cas pressed his lips into a thin line, looking down at the ground. “I am… indifferent to your sexuality, Dean. I simply do not appreciate being treated like an afterthought, especially after hearing your prayers when we were separated. I had assumed our relationship had improved, but I guess I was wrong. I apologize for upsetting you.”
Benny smirked at Cas, obviously looking to start something. “Dean and I are a little more than friends, I would say.”
ideas yet. Cas’ tongue pushed into Dean’s mouth, and Dean’s brain completely shut down. Everything was Cas, Cas,
Dean closed his eyes, swallowing harshly. She was right. He knew she was right, he just didn’t want to admit it to himself. He was scared of whatever this thing was with Cas.
“Fuck you.”
“Cas,” Dean whispered, “Can’t you use your angel mojo and zap us into the right room?”
Dean dropped his head into his hands. He tried to fight it, but it was no use. They kept coming, like an avalanche that continued to grow until it crashed into the inside of his skull. He stumbled out of the bathroom, still clutching his forehead.
Dean started to take some wadded-up bills out of his wallet. “Cas… would you just- “
Dean feels himself deflate at that comment, suddenly unsure why he was so against the idea in the first place. Cas is his best friend. It would be fine.
. Dean was shaken from his spiraling thoughts when he realized that Cas was staring at him.
Cas reached into his pocket and pulled out the beat-up iPod. He plugged it into the cord Dean kept in the Impala for those days when Sam wouldn’t shut up about how Dean never lets him pick what they listen to. A few seconds later, an upbeat, poppy tune blared through the speakers. Dean had to turn it down for Cas to hear him. “What the fuck is this?”
The clerk folded his arms across his chest. “Get the
I gotta find you, man. There’s gotta be a way. Sam’s been doing research on the Empty to figure something out but it’s driving me crazy that I can’t do more. I just want you to know that I’m not giving up. If you were here, you’d be able to help us think of a plan.
Cas stared at Dean’s fallen hand for a moment. “It’s me.”
“One king bed, please,” Cas interjected smoothly, saving Dean from any further embarrassment. Cas wrapped an arm around Dean’s waist, and Dean thought he might completely short circuit any minute now. This was going to be a long week.
“Bed,” Dean managed.
Dean shook his head. “That’s not what this is about. I… want to be honest with you, too. It’s just really hard for me.”
“That’s not what this is about, Dean, although I do question your unwavering trust of that vampire,” Cas looked down at the ground before his gaze eventually moved up to scan Dean’s face, “I have some concerns about the portal Benny is taking us to. I don’t know that I will be able to go through it, since I am not a human. I worry it may kill me if I try.”
Sam cut him off. “Dean, breathe.”
“Dean and I are in an intimate relationship, but we are not married. Although, I would like to marry him someday.” Cas cut Dean off, speaking with certainty.
Dean moved to hold Cas’ face in his hands. His eyes shone with what Cas understood to be relief and quite possibly… fondness. “I love you, Cas. I should’ve told you a long time ago. This isn’t a one-time thing for me. I love you so much.”
Dean sighed, his morning coffee having not quite woken him up just yet. “Hit me.”
“No, really, Dean. There’s a spell we can use to open up a portal. It requires the angel’s blood, which we have right here. It’s almost like Cas left it there on purpose.”
Once Cas had a chance to shower and shave, he walked out of the bathroom with a flourish, showing off his clean clothing. Dean’s pants became uncomfortably tight at the sight, and he shifted in his seat in order to hide it from Cas.
Once he got off the elevator, he scanned the lobby briefly before seeing Cas’ mop of brown hair across from Iris, the woman they met last night. Cas turned around to look at Dean as he walked up and sat in the extra seat Cas saved for him. “Hello, Dean.”
“Get…
“I have a feeling she wasn’t in her right mind,” Dean said.
Dean felt himself choke. “You-” He stuttered, “You can’t just say shit like that, Cas.”
Dean groaned. “It doesn’t matter, Sammy. I fucked it up and it’s over now. Cas will probably never speak to me again after the shit I said to him.”
Cas rolled his eyes, but nonetheless gave Dean an endearing smile. “I already did, Dean. And I’d do it over and over again if it meant I could have this.”
Cas was shocked by this confession, never expecting them to get this far. He always imagined his life with Dean at the center, possibly growing old together but expecting nothing from the other man. Now, the possibilities were endless. Dean, the man he had loved for so long, loved him in return. Cas would spend the rest of his short human life cherishing Dean like a man kneeling at an altar might cherish his god. Cas pressed their lips together, soft and sweet, before responding, “I love you, too, Dean.”
Dean leaned into Cas’ touch before placing his hands on either side of Cas’ face and looked into the deep blue eyes across from him. He paused for a brief moment before crashing their lips together. It was an aggressive, messy kiss. Just like Dean always imagined it.
The corner of Cas’ mouth tipped up. “I saved you some food. I will go get some coffee as well. I wanted it to be hot for you when you woke up.” Cas pushed a large plate of food, waffles included, toward Dean as he stood up.
Dean’s lips parted immediately, eyes going wide. He leaned in slightly, waiting for permission, as though he wasn’t completely sure this was what Cas was asking him for. Cas removed his hand from the doorknob to wrap his arms around Dean’s waist, pulling him in to
“What’s going on? Is Cas okay? What happened?” Sam asked, panic clear in his voice.
Dean and Cas looked at each other, surprise written over their features. Dean turned back to the girl and hurriedly assured her that it was okay before ushering Cas and Iris back out the front door.
“Of course, Dean. Why wouldn’t I?” Cas was smiling at Dean now. Dean couldn’t help but smile back, lacing their fingers together.
Her room was almost identical to their own, except with personal items scattered all over the bed and floor. Two bags sat in the corner, one stacked on top of the other. Dean very quickly realized the one on the bottom was Laurel’s, undisturbed and unused since she disappeared. He let out a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding.
Cas smirked and Dean pushed at his shoulder softly, grinning to himself.
Dean groaned. “I told you. He didn’t make it out of Purgatory.”
“I miss that easy comfortable feeling of being in a relationship that you two have. It’s the simple things like sharing a cup of coffee, right?” Iris said sadly, looking down into her own lukewarm coffee.
Cas’ expression changed from that of anger to one that Dean had never seen on his friend before. Cas narrowed his eyes and took a deep breath, stepping closer to Benny. “What is that supposed to mean?”
“I think I can handle it. I want to make you feel better.”
Cas stared at Dean, waiting for a response. Dean’s lip curled, uncomfortable under Cas’ gaze. “The weird front desk guy is always out there, so we’d have to distract him somehow.”
“You like Taylor Swift?” Dean had to stop himself from laughing. An ancient cosmic being was sitting in his car playing Taylor Swift. He thought he’d seen it all up until now.
“Dean, in order for a relationship to work, you have to be vulnerable. I know that’s scary for you, but it’s Cas, for God’s sake. Cas has put up with a lot of your shit, and he still stuck around. You gotta give a little here, man.”
Dean. Dean definitely didn’t mind.
Cas felt something akin to disappointment, but he couldn’t figure out why. He scanned the candy bar, and once Dean paid for it, he handed the chocolate back to him. “I can’t, Dean. I’m working. It was hard enough trying to find a job around here, I can’t lose this one.”
The side of Cas’ mouth moved upward to give Dean a soft, lopsided smile. “Of course, Dean.”
Benny laughed. “It’s just that all I’ve heard about him from you is that he has the most
Dean looked at Sam sadly. He knew Sam missed Cas. He knew Jack did, too. Neither of them understood what Dean was going through, though. Dean barely understood it himself. “You don’t get it, Sam.”
“Then help me get it.”
If Benny noticed, Dean was being more obvious with his moping than he had originally thought. He sighed before responding, “I’m sick of it here. I want to shower. I want to see my brother. I want to find Cas. And I want this
. The only people he has a consistent relationship with are Sam and his best friend…
Cas was staring off into space, his lips pressed into a thin line. Sam was more observant than Cas had realized. Cas has known about his feelings for Dean for quite some time now. He still had trouble understanding them, though. Sometimes it was overwhelming, how much he cared for Dean. It felt like he might split open with the weight of his desire. Angels weren’t supposed to feel that way, especially about a human, so Cas pushed it away. A problem for another day. He supposed today was that day. Cas shook his head. “What about you? You are his brother. Maybe a kiss on the cheek from you would suffice.”
Sam placed his head in his hands. “I thought he was dead!”
Dean and Cas shared a quick look. before gathering as much as they could between the two of them. As they did this, a loud voice echoed from the lobby.
“So, my husband and I are in town for a few days and stopped here, but we heard that there have been some disappearances recently. It’s making him a little nervous, you know? Do you know anything about what happened?”
“Cas, I think the demon cure might kill him.” Sam said, choking up at the thought. “There has to be another way.”
Back in Iris’ room, Dean avoided looking directly at Cas. The alcohol was wearing off, and the post-drinking anxiety was settling in. He made a mistake. He shouldn’t have kissed Cas again, he shouldn’t have taken advantage like that. Cas didn’t feel the same way. Cas probably thought Dean was still faking it, and that’s why he went along with it in the first place. He tried to focus on what Iris was telling them, but his mind felt like it had been crushed by a steamroller.
Dean rolled his eyes. This is what he gets for asking his younger brother for help. “Bitch.”
“I like to
Dean stepped between Benny and Cas, placing a hand on Benny’s chest to stop him from saying anything else.
Dean winked at him. Cas felt his heartrate increase, the memory of their brief kiss still haunting him. Sam looked between his brother and Cas, a knowing smile on his face. Cas gave him a warning glare. Unfortunately for Cas, Dean saw this exchange. He pointed an accusatory finger between the two of them. “Are you guys fighting?”
Both of them moved at the same time, capturing each other’s lips in a sweet, soft kiss that lasted only a second before they pulled away, overwhelmed. Dean grinned, embarrassed, before pulling Cas back in. What started as a chaste kiss slowly became more urgent, with Dean sliding his tongue against Cas’ bottom lip and eliciting a loud groan from the angel. The noises Cas was making only served to make Dean go even more insane, if that was possible. He grabbed Cas by the hips, pushing him slowly until they hit the wall behind them. Dean paused for a moment before leaning into Cas, their bodies flush against one another. The back of Cas’ head hit the wall, and Dean took advantage of the opportunity to suck as many bruises as he could manage into the side of Castiel’s neck.
“Hey, Dean. I see something over by the river.”
Dean mumbled something to himself, keeping his eyes on the road. Cas rubbed his hands on his face in frustration. “Can you please tell me what you’re thinking, Dean?”, he asked.
“Okay, Dean,” Cas said, before he lowered his voice a few octaves, “I was also… thinking. Maybe we should discuss our relationship in private so that we are prepared for certain situations that may come up. I understand that couples typically have a more physical relationship than one might have with a best friend.”
“About what?” Cas asked innocently, his deep blue eyes cutting right through Dean’s well-crafted façade.
“You want to-
Love, Dean
Smiling softly, Sam reached out to pull his brother into a hug. “Let’s find him, then.”
Iris sighed. “I’ve been better.”
As soon as the kiss started, it was over. Cas pulled back, eyes wide with surprise. Dean started to say something, anything, but Cas was already turning on his heels to close himself into the bathroom. All Dean could do was stand locked in place, his hands that were only a moment ago wrapped around Castiel’s waist moved to hold his own face.
Cas stirred next to him, apparently disturbed by the conversation. His face peeked out from under the covers. “Good morning, Sam.”
“Oh yeah, they’re cool with murder but draw the line at homophobia. Makes perfect sense.”
Dean pulled back after a moment, elated that Cas was finally home, before remembering that he was still pissed.
Cas’ palm suddenly pressed into Dean’s forearm, and Dean opened his hand to allow Cas to interlock their fingers. Dean felt himself stop breathing.
Cas seemed to hesitate before saying, “Dean, since we are awake before Benny this morning, we need to discuss something.”
flannel.
are my best friend.
Dean flopped forward onto Cas, pressing his face into the mattress behind Cas’ shoulder and groaning. “Cas, believe me. That’s the worst thing I’ve ever done, and I would take it back if I could, but Sammy was gonna die. I prayed for help and the angel Ezekiel answered me. He possessed Sam, but if Ezekiel leaves Sam’s body, Sam won’t make it. Ezekiel told me you had to leave. I didn’t have a choice, Cas. I didn’t, and I’m so sorry.”
Cas sighed. “My apologies, Sam.”
Dean froze. “
With that, Sam left Cas alone to his thoughts.
Dean gaped at that. They hadn’t even said they love each other yet, and Cas was thinking about marriage? “You want to marry me?”
“Cas?”
While Dean wasn’t ecstatic about the idea of a vampire and a knife all up in his face, he did really hate the scratchy feeling that came with excess facial hair. Dean eventually resigned himself to the fact that this was happening and settled on a tree stump near the water’s edge. Benny kneeled in front of him and pushed his knees apart to get close enough. Dean watched as Benny wet the knife in the river before pressing it against Dean’s jawline, scraping away the thick hair that had grown uncontrollably over the past few months. As Benny concentrated on Dean’s beard, Dean was watching Benny’s face. He wasn’t bad looking by any means. Dean’s eyes flicked from the top of Benny’s head to his eyes, and then down to his lips. Benny happened to look away from shaving Dean at that exact moment, catching Dean openly staring. Benny inhaled quickly, and shakily whispered, “Like what you see?”
is. Two. If anyone should have a problem with this, it’s me. Or have we all just forgotten that Castiel is walking around in what was at one time my dad’s body?”
Castiel let the silence fall as he felt Chuck all but studying him. He began his sentence multiple times but couldn’t quite get the words out. Finally, he took a breath. “Then you know that I….”
Dean sat in the passenger seat of Cas’ newest procurement, a zippy little blue sedan. It wasn’t Dean’s style, but it was world’s better than the old Lincoln Continental and the pickup truck. Neither had fit Cas. This was better….not perfect, he thought as he judged the interior, but better. He had given an appreciative nod to the newness of it, happy to not worry about Cas breaking down on the side of the road.
Cas’ thumb ever so softly made soothing circles on Dean’s hand as he spoke. “I suppose I can’t, but I believe he’s never been all that creative. He’s rewritten the same stories over and over. I choose to not give him credit for this one.” Dean sniffed quietly in the dark and Cas said nothing of the lone tear he knew Dean wiped away. He didn’t even look to acknowledge it.
Cas traced his thumb over the last two words before looking up at him, blinking back tears. “Thank you, Dean.”
“The birthday boy asked me to stay. How could I ever say no?” Dean turned on his side, facing Cas now.
think if we wait just a few more minutes…” Sam began, his mouth stretched in a line as he bit back any elaboration.
Dean groaned as Cas traced his nose against his length as he awaited his answer. “I do, Cas…Hell yes. If…If you’re sure you want to do this.” Castiel gave out a dark, dangerous laugh that made Dean’s dick twitch. Cas’ warm lips left hot, open mouthed kisses along his length that left Dean arching his back into him needily.
Dean shook his head adamantly, glancing to Cas as he did so. “No. I didn't even know it was possible until Cas told me about what Metatron did to him.”
Cas pushed him forward, pressing him into the closed door and Dean grunted as the air knocked out of him. He got barely a breath back before Cas’ hands were roaming along his side and his fingers were sliding under his shirt. “Please, Dean. Do this one thing I ask. I’ll give you anything you want when this is over,” Cas whispered gruffly in Dean’s ear as his fingers skirted the waist of his pants and Dean groaned. “if you just let me protect you now.”
Aberia was quiet, absorbing what he said and Castiel felt a tendril of hope within him when she asked, “Naomi…. what did she do?”
“What the Hell’s she talking about, Cas?” Dean spoke from behind his left shoulder.
it works because—because think about it. Wouldn’t it actually be pretty disrespectful and maybe even a little homophobic of everyone to call bullshit on it? Why is it so implausible for us to realise our feelings for each other now? Yes, okay, it’s a little late in the game but we’re at the age where we’re ready to settle down now and look, oops, it seems we already have with each other in this beautiful two-bedroom apartment, which, now that we only need one bedroom, is equipped with a spare one for our upcoming child—”
His face flushes with a heat he can’t decipher the source of, but he ignores it like he’s starting to ignore a lot of things these days. He pats Cas on the cheek twice and lingers a moment too long.
“I love you, Dean Winchester, and for the first time I don’t believe it’s a sin…” Castiel whispered into his ear and then he was gone.
“If that’s what you want,” Castiel braced himself and went to stand but felt Dean’s hand wrap around his own and pull him back down in the dark.
Dean rolled his eyes and pressed Cas’ hand harder to him. “It obviously is. Do it,” and Cas nodded once before shutting his eyes, the temptation too strong to argue further. Before him was every memory, every thought, every feeling Dean had ever had. The good and bad, spread before him…and his heart. It was such pure love. For Sam. For his family…for…” Cas gasped then and Dean let out a breath of relief, knowing Cas knew now.
“I can see that…” Dean said softly as he looked over his wounds again. He stopped as he studied Cas’ wings, letting his fingers hesitate above the deep stab wound on the wing nearest him. Many of his inky, jet black feathers were frayed or bent.
-----------------------------------
“I’m hungry. I’m going to find myself some food,” Cas said as he tied the laces of the tennis shoes Dean had packed extra.
Dean pouted, his lower lip poking out in a parody of a pout. “You pick now to listen to me. Okay. Then tell me what you were talking about
Aberia minutely raised her chin and shook her head. Debriel sighed in exasperation behind her. Castiel rolled his eyes to the amusement of Sam, Mary, and Jack. Dean had been behind him and missed it. Cas then looked behind himself and nodded at Dean, who smiled. Dean slipped his own blade out and had it at Aberia’s throat before she could react. She ground her teeth and let out a breath. Debriel stepped forward but Castiel held a hand up and he stopped immediately.
“Just because the Commander rejected you….” Debriel said with a grin in his voice. Sam stole a look at Dean, his mouth a tight line. Dean knew there was a reason he didn’t like her.
“The Commander ordered me to free and protect you and the others instead of engaging in combat….” She growled out, her eyes bright with the urge to join the others.
Dean tugged on the tie, and Castiel took the moment to step closer. “You, Commander Castiel, wearing a dress shirt and tie under your armor. Only you, Cas.” His easy grin turned a tiny bit unsure as Cas stepped more into his space, making his lower back press into the counter behind him. Cas, who was normally a bit standoffish, felt almost predatory, in all the right ways. Dean’s eyes tightened and he lifted an eyebrow. “You enjoyed that out there today didn’t you?”
“Those people aren’t here, Dean. There is no place in Heaven for the likes of that.” Cas gave him a knowing look before Dean nodded his approval, a close mouthed smile forming on his face.
“Read into my soul,” Dean said breathily as he glanced up at him and ran his hand along the kitchen counter.
Dean ran a hand through his hair, letting the adrenaline subside as he walked back to put the gun down on the nightstand. “Hell, both the phones are probably dead.”
Castiel paced the library, his wing wounds now mostly healed. After more convincing by human and Angel alike, they had begun healing them, but they still drug behind him as he paced, the feathers closest to the floor making soft scraping sounds as he moved.  More time was needed for them to be at their full strength again and Cas was not keen on waiting for Naomi to make her move. He clenched and unclenched his fists as he spoke, frustration painted evidently on his face. “She’s calling to me. She knows where I am, and this will not end until one of us is dead. Delaying is not going to gain us enough advantage to warrant risking her ambushing us here,” he growled out while the other Angels lingered around him, having heard this argument much over the last hour. "They would not gain entry easily but if they make their way inside we would be trapped inside as well."
Dean flashed a roguish smile and winked as he said, “What can I say. Angels love me.” He laughed as Castiel rolled his eyes and exited with the others, most of which had stiffened with annoyance at his parting comment. Aberia especially had gritted her teeth hard enough for Cas to hear.
“I’m afraid not. Tanira and Badriel, please hold his arms.” Naomi came forward as the other two stepped forward and grabbed him roughly by the arms. Naomi shoved the trench coat aside and roughly pulled his white dress shirt up before laying a hand on his anti-tracking tattoo. Castiel locked eyes with Naomi and refused to give her the satisfaction of hearing him scream, so he ground his teeth in pain as she burned the tattoo from his skin. He could have fought but he knew if he killed the other Angels he would absolutely be trapped here or killed. He would stay alive for those he'd left behind, and he let Naomi see it in his eyes.
Jack tucked in his lower lip and nodded. “I could be wrong, but I don’t think so. I know I haven’t been alive as long as you but….but when I still had my powers and Castiel was dead…I could hear his prayers, Sam. He prayed every night for God to bring Castiel back to life.”
“Okay, but you wear armor on the regular….I’m just saying…” Dean said with a grin as he pushed his underwear down, revealing himself to Cas. Dean, who had been with more people than he cared to count, felt shyness at this moment he hadn’t felt in some time. It was unfounded, however, as Castiel looked at him with overwhelming love and possession.
Cas went to take a step forward but Dean laid a steady hand on his shoulder, holding him back without strain. Cas ruffled his feathers and leveled a heavy gaze on the offending Angel. “Then I will add you to the lengthy list of Angels I killed who also refused to take their drama off this planet.”
“His father-“Mayr began.
“Only now you know there are less than a dozen of us. Even fewer now that the Empty..” Naomi was cut off as Dean stepped shoulder to shoulder with Cas.
Dean’s anger melted away and he reached for Cas’ hand, which he freely gave. He looked down at Cas then back up to the Angels around him. “I'm sorry. Thank you for everything today. If not for you all…”
Dean let a wave of some emotion Cas couldn't put his finger on wash across his face. “She didn’t…No. No. We’re all good here. You ready to go back to the bunker?”
“Dean…” Cas said as he shook his head. “No. It wasn’t true, what she said. You can’t think that.”
As Dean and Sam walked away from the home of the victim’s mother, Dean shook his head. He loosened the dark maroon tie and shucked off the black dress jacket, chucking it in the back seat with little care.  The dress clothes were a necessity of playing FBI but it didn’t mean he had to like it.  His gut tightened minutely as he loosened his tie. He couldn’t be blamed for associating ties with Cas. If he had the opportunity to loosen that dark blue tie, pull him toward him and…nope. Nope. Now was not the time to entertain that thought.
He was rewarded with a toothy, pleased smile from Dean and his heart felt like it might burst. “Awesome. Not like we got anything going on today, huh? It’s been pretty quiet out there.”
Dean gave him a glare as he ran his fingers along the spine of the books on the bookshelf in front of him absently. “You know what I mean…Sure, it’s great that there are less incidents right now but when has that ever meant anything good? It always meant something worse was out there we hadn't figured out yet. Monsters don't stop Sam. they just get quiet or something worse kills them."
