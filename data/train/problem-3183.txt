“No, you misunderstand me, Dean. I am in love with you.”
"Oh Castiel, that is so beautiful," Charlie says.
“That I am, Cas,” I say with a smile on my face. “How about we go out once and you can decide if you want to do it again?”
Charlie nods and scoots closer to him. “That blonde is Jo, her mom owns the Roadhouse diner in town. Her parents practically took Dean and Sam in after their mom died. The shoulder length haired kid that is Sam. He is Dean’s brother, younger by four years. Dean is very protective of him. That beautiful brunette is Dorothy, she is my girlfriend. The kid with the mullet playing with Dean is Ash, he is dating Jo. Benny is the burly man with the southern accent and Dean's best friend. The guy playing with Benny is Victor.”
“I am going to get you some acetaminophen to keep the swelling down and hopefully it will take the pain away. Now, you need to get some rest before Saturday.”
Sam chuckles at the door, “Dean, he is bleeding. What about the blood screams that he is fine?”
Before leaving, I add, “Thank you for this evening, Dean; it was very nice. I will see you at school.”
Castiel’s declaration of love rang through Dean’s ears as he fought to keep the tears away. But he couldn’t. He didn’t even get to tell Cas how he felt about him before he was ripped from this world. And now the angel would never know the truth.
“The truth, brother,” comes Benny’s southern drawl.
“I am sure that whenever you want to hang out that I will be busy.”
And I am hoping it is enough for a pardon.”
“Yes,” I say. “I will get Castiel to fall in love with me, just you wait and see.”
Looking in the mirror appears to be a mistake because his reflection shows puffy red cheeks and a bleeding left ear. Castiel cannot even recall whether or not Naomi slapped his ear, but she must have for blood to be oozing out of it.
“Lisa and I broke up. She told me that I wasn’t enough for her anymore and she was tired of waiting for me. Lisa even admitted that she has been cheating on me with someone. She left me for him,” I say.
Charlie smiles knowingly at Castiel. “I am sorry we crashed your date then.”
Which always seem to be begging for a kiss.
Castiel does a final check of his appearance, making sure that the bandages are not visible through his shirt before he exits his room and makes his way downstairs.
“I would start by reading the abstracts and note which abstracts seem promising to support your ideas. Then read the full article. Remember that you want to read both sides of the argument, not just one. A good research paper always recognizes both sides of the argument. And it’s important for you to know what the opposing side may say against your position. If you can recognize these and correct or acknowledge them in some way, then you will have a strong research paper.”
I smile, “That sounds perfect.”
“Because if you didn’t you wouldn’t be here talking to me. You would have already gotten up and left or turned me down with a slap to my face.”
For I have nothing but good faith to show.
“But do you want it to?” Dean inquires.
“I am going to go downstairs to wait for him while you get ready,” Gabriel says as he moves from the bed to the door.
I make my way off the stage and through the crowd as the next person’s name is called.
“Regarding?” I inquire.
Oh, won’t you do this for me son if you can
“I have never been more wrong
Another slap across the face. Castiel knows he shouldn’t but he cannot stop himself, “I didn’t chose to be gay, it is just who I am.” That statement warrants another slap.
“Oh,” Cas’ face flushes in embarrassment.
“Yes,” Cas answers.
The brunette sitting next to Charlie, Dorothy if Castiel remembers her name correctly, joins the conversations. “No, the best one is The Half Blood Prince. I like how you learn the backstory of Tom Riddle. But you also learn about the horcruxes and what they are.”
“How about we put some fun into this hard situation,” Ash asks.
“That’s good. So, what do you say to a date?” I ask again.
“For starters, Chuck and Naomi wouldn’t like it,” Cassie answers.
“Thanks again, little brother,” I say. I flash Sam a smile before I bid him farewell. “See you later, bitch,” I say over my shoulder.
“You know I hate you, right?” Castiel teases his brother.
“I will tell you that the church is not my prefered place to be. It is a place that I go when I need to seek guidance, if only because my parents instilled that belief in me. But I know there is no one place that you are better to reach God, the church just wants you to believe that. The truth is that God has touched everything so he is everywhere.”
Applause fills the small cafe, some of the patrons even rise to stand.
“No that is not it.” Jo puts a finger to her chin as she thinks. “Oh, I know now. You are that kid who is always at the church. You go there every night and always help out at events.”
“I already told you, I didn’t want to get in the way of you and Lisa.”
“Are there any restrictions about the other party that I need to know about,” Ash inquires.
“He said that he had other plans but that he would think about it,” Dean answers. “I am hopeful that he will agree and if he doesn’t I can charm him.”
“And why do you say that?”
“It is alright,” he replies. Cas smiles at me and I cannot help but return it. Cas’ smile falters a bit. “Are you getting ready to leave?” he asks, indicating my jacket and backpack.
“I can assure you I did not do anything to Michael, Lucifer, or Raphael,” I state.
“Yeah. There is something about your work that speaks to me in a way nothing else has.”
I make my way through the cafe to a booth and take a seat. It is my preferred seat in the whole cafe because it has the perfect view of the park’s gardens across the street.
“I know. But I am happy knowing that they are happy.”
“And all good things take time, Benny,” Dean whispers back.
“Because my father is the reverend and my mother is in the choir.”
But in a religious household being gay is considered unholy; it is an old and archaic view from the Bible.
I can only imagine how their soft flesh will feel against my hips,
“Fine, if you insist,” I say with some hostility.  “My house isn’t much further.”
“That is really good,” a man with shoulder length brown hair says. Castiel doesn't know him and he supposes he is one of Dean's friends,
“You are so hopeless,” is Charlie’s only response. She shakes her head and rolls her eyes as if the answer is obvious.
Dean deals with the fact that Cas left him on the beach and devises a way that they could go out another time.
Before Cassie can say anything in the form of a disagreement, I change the subject as I start to clean his chest wounds with a saline solution. “I talked with Dean Winchester today.”
“What are we betting for anyways?” I ask for clarification.
“Are you certain he just wants to be friends? Because it seemed like he was flirting with me yesterday.”
“Then how did she mean it, Sam?”
“That I am. But as you can see I am not alone today,” I say as I indicate to Dean. “Dean agreed to accompany me tonight. And am I correct in assuming that you know each other?”
“I do not believe that that is all that happened between the two of you. You were far too cozy with each other. If you will excuse me for a moment, I must go speak with Naomi,” Chuck says. “She may want to see you in the back room to deal with this transgression.”
Raphael snicker reaches my ears. “He really likes that, Lucifer. Just look at the way you have him squirming under you.”
“Maybe my life has just become one of those stupid romcoms,” I retort.
My Love Unrequited is an original poem that I wrote for this story. Castiel is the inspiration behind the poem.
Cas nods and closes the distance between them. Dean’s lips press against Castiel’s in a soft chaste kiss. After a moment they pull apart to look at each other, elation spread across each of their faces. Dean closes the distance between them again, kissing Castiel passionately.
“And what would that be?” I ask.
“Yes,” Sam replies.
“I apologize for that, Dean, but Heaven needs me.”
And know that you are my warden.
“Which is?” I ask.
And maybe Ash is right. When Lisa and I first got together I was happy and felt loved, but things changed. I cannot recall a time when I took Lisa out because I wanted to, not because it felt like an obligation.
“Have you met you?”
“That sounds like her,” I mumble under my breath, hoping that Cas didn’t hear. “And no worries, Cas. I understand that you were working, and I shouldn’t have bothered you with a personal matter.”
Dean is the first to pull away. “Was that alright?” he asks the angel.
“Morning Marv,” Chuck greets. The two men converse in front of Castiel, but he pays them no mind, choosing to greet others that walk into the church, even helping people to their seats.
All that I want for you, my son, is to be satisfied.
“Your love life, man,” Ash states like it is the most obvious thing in the world. “And before you throw a hissy fit, hear what I have to say before you shut it down.”
“Alastair,” I answer, as I look off in the distance, recalling the argument with Lisa.
“What did Cas say when you asked him earlier,” Charlie asks.
“Alright, that's a fair point. But Castiel, what would you say if I told you that I want to stay and get to know you better?”
“You know I would though, don’t you?” Dean asks.
Trigger warning: abuse/mentions of abuse
That is how it is meant to be.
My street comes into view, “You can pull over here,” I state.
“So, you expect me to start a secret relationship?” Cassie questions.
“If you don’t mind my asking, what is in the bag?” Dean asks, nodding to the bag that is by Castiel’s feet.
“I mean he is the youngest of sixteen kids, his parents don’t really pay much attention to him. And the attention they do give him is not always positive. They put a lot of pressure on him and have his whole life planned out for him. After he graduates, his parents are sending him away to a seminary.”
“And what was I to say to you? You are with Lisa, I couldn't get in the way of that.”
“Baby is a ‘67 Chevy Impala,” Dean answers. “She belonged to my father and was passed down to me when I got my drivers license. She is my pride and joy; there isn’t any other car in the world like her.”
“No you weren’t. There is something going on between the two of you. What is it?” Chuck all but demands.
Gabriel silently watches me for a few moments and just when I think he is about to leave or that our conversation is over, he opens his mouth.
I let out a laugh, “I meant I will hear you out. You can ask me anything, and I’ll answer honestly.”
“He is in some of our classes actually,” Ash starts, “calculus and physics.” Ash looks at me. Now that he mentions it, the guy does look familiar. “He sits in the front row and doesn’t utter a word. And he is incredibly smart. I mean, how many people do you know that can complete a complex calculus problem in their head? Even I cannot do that.”
“Right you are, Cas. All I am asking for is a chance.”
It was a hard transition for Dean to leave hunting behind. Partly because he has been doing it his whole life and partly because it made him feel connected with Sam. He has nightmare every night: of his time in Hell, of all the horrific things he has seen happen in his lifetime, or the faces of people he has failed to save.  And it seems the longer he goes without hunting the worse the nightmares get.
“I am just trying to think of how I can justify hanging out with Dean to Chuck and Naomi. They are going to think that it is a date, even if we are just going to be friends.”
“Good.” A pause, then, “I am sure it will alleviate some of his anxiety about the situation.”
“Yes, I have noticed him. I mean how can I not notice someone as handsome as him with his kissable lips, his deep blue eyes, and his dark hair that shines golden when the light hits it the right way.” I quickly glance at Sam. “So, yes, I noticed him in the sense that he is one attractive man. But I never acted on my attraction towards him because I was with Lisa. I pushed all thoughts of him to the back of my mind and pretended that he didn’t exist.” And before I can change my mind I force the last part out. “Because I knew that he was someone I wanted, someone I could see myself happy with. And if I gave myself the chance to know him, I knew that would be the end of me.”
“And how is that a good thing?”
Dean’s eyes move from Gabriel to land on Castiel. A small smile crosses his features as he says, “Hey Cas.” Dean looks Castiel’s attire up and down and frowns, “You might want to change. I thought we could enjoy the nice weather by going to the beach.”
Charlie lets out a frustrated sigh. “Maybe you should tell them.”
I hope it does not offend.
“But what if down the line he changes his mind?” Cassie asks.
“What are you doing here?” she asks as she pulls away from him.
I watch Castiel. And though we are on opposite ends of the hallway and Castiel’s appearance is ruffled, I can see that he is one attractive man.
“Really?” Dean asks.
“So, why are you always there?”
“Not necessarily,” Sam starts, “from what I have heard, Castiel hasn’t shown any romantic interest in her or anyone for that matter. Play your cards right and you might be able to get something useful out of her.”
“It is complicated,” I try to say.
For you already found someone to woo
“I really like The Prisoner of Azkaban,” Sam says with a smile on his face. “What is your favorite one,” Sam asks Charlie.
Baby be a simple kind of man
But hiding a big part of who I am has drained me. And though some part of me knew that my foster family would respond negatively to this news, I hoped for the best.
Castiel shakes his head as he contemplates what to say. “Alright,” he concedes, “I will think about it and let you know my answer before you leave.”
“Cas,” Dean starts, “You are amazing at writing poetry. And I meant it when I said that there was something about your writing that speaks to me. It is deep and personal but that is what makes it so amazing. I think Charlie is right, people would benefit from you sharing your poetry.”
“We could go to his house and invite him,” Dorothy suggests.
“He is part of the Shurley family?”
“Hey Sammy,” I greet.
And I can pretend to be fine.
“It is a little ironic how he wants me to live a normal life and be happy with Lisa. But I can’t,” Dean admits as he prays.
“Home,” Castiel answers tersely.
“Yeah,” I answer, refusing to look at the house Dean is staring at. It is a three story house with at least twenty bedrooms and ten bathrooms.
“You are going to get caught one of these days. Chuck and Naomi are wondering how I am properly taking care of my wounds, especially the hard to reach ones. They know someone is tending to me and are really upset about it. Please watch yourself.”
“Turn down this street; it is the third house on the right,” I say.
Castiel looks at Dean disbelievingly for a moment but changes his features to a stoic mask as he hears Dean’s friends approaching.
And you can do this if you try
“But I want you here.”
I walk through the doors of the cafe, the familiar fragrances of cinnamon and coffee reach my nose, Dean at my heels. I walk to the counter to place my order and smile when I see Charlie’s familiar face.
The thing is I can sweet talk any woman into wanting to be with me, into making them believe that they love me. But when it comes to talking to men, I am a disaster. It is honestly quite embarrassing; when I talk to a man I get all nervous and shy. And that is why I am coming to Sam for advice.
“I can’t.”
“I wasn’t aware that Chuck had any other kids,” I comment.
I smile at her and make my way back to Dean.
“Yeah, that is him.”
“It is no wonder Jo was asking him all those questions about his beliefs. From what I have heard they follow the traditional views of the Bible or as Cas called them the old and archaic views,” Sam states.
“Maybe you can express an interest in the things that he likes, things that matter to him,” Sam says.
“Because I can’t, Dean,” I state.
“You are right,” Castiel says. “I still can’t help being nervous though.”
Castiel watches as the blood drips down from his ear to his chin and finally to the collar of his white shirt. He lets out a sigh, not knowing how he could explain this away.
“No,” I reply.
“Oh don’t you worry, you’ll find yourself
“Oh,” I say as I look away from Dean shyly. “I used to attend private school. The dress code there was slacks and button downs. So, that's all I really have.”
“I am not talking about them, you idiot. I was talking about my little brother,” Gabriel hostility replies.
“Yeah, Sammy. Cas doesn’t deserve to be over there. He deserves to be here, where he is loved,” Dean replies. Dean looks at Jack and gives a nod, “I am ready whenever you are.”
“He will never agree to go on a date with you, Dean.”
Dean makes his move on Castiel. Here is to hoping that this time he is more successful at scoring a date than the last time.
“Yes, why else would I?”
I tilt my head in confusion. “What is wrong with the way I dress?” I inquire.
Sam searches the church for Cas and catches sight of the other man sitting in one of the front rows.
“What time did you say he was coming?” Castiel asks when Gabriel walks in his room to check on him.
I look up to see none other than Dean Winchester handing me some papers. I am surprised to see him helping me and even more surprised that he knows my name.
Before I can say anything Gabriel holds up his hand to stop me. “The thing is, Cassie used to wear his heart on his sleeve and as a result it got broken very easily. The people he trusted tended to either hurt him or leave him. And that is why Cassie is so guarded, he is guarding himself from getting hurt. Or maybe you haven’t noticed. But that is why he is the way he is: dismissive and standoffish. It is why he doesn’t let people get close to him. But for some reason none of those tactics worked on you, you pushed your way into his life, now you need to make sure he knows you are not leaving. You need to make sure Cassie knows that you want to be his friend.”
I hope you all enjoy. Please feel free to leave comments and kudos.
“Hey Cas,” I greet when I find myself standing before him.
“I had no idea. I thought Charles and Naomi only had fifteen kids. But now you are telling me they have another one.”
Silence fills the space between us for a couple of minutes.
“Good morning, Father Charles,” Marv greets.
“Because you challenge me in ways no one else does. And you make me want to be a better person.”
“I told you the other day, I want to get to know you better,” I say. And I am surprised to find that I honestly mean that.
“You used to live on the road?” Cas asks.
Castiel sighs knowing that he is fighting a losing battle.
I am walking in the school hallway when I am suddenly slammed chest first into a set of lockers.
Whoever said that the person who has a hand in raising you showed you mercy was wrong. I have learned firsthand that mercy is a false concept. My foster parents, who have raised me since I was a baby, had no qualms about raising a fist or belt to me.
And understand that I could never have this,
Castiel listens to Gabe’s steps as he descends the staircase and goes back to trying to find an outfit to wear.
“Is it special to you because of the memories you have had in it or something else?” I ask curiously.
“Why?”
I am just focusing on my healing
“Yeah, Cas is the youngest.”
“I will think about it, Gabe. But if I am being honest I do not want to get hurt again. And I know I will be setting myself up to get hurt if I be friends with him. Have you ever tried to be friends with someone you were in love with?”
“Are all of your poems so personal?”
Castiel looks at me with something in his eyes that I cannot place - the closest I can guess is that it’s apprehension. “I will have to think about that. I usually do not share my poetry with anyone.”
The door opens after a couple of moments. Castiel is shirtless and blood is dripping from the fresh lash marks to his chest. And from the way he is standing, I am certain that the lash marks on his back have been reopened. I quickly hurry into the room.
And you can do this, babe, if you try
But you do not know.
And don’t forget son, there is someone up above.
“But you want to?” I inquire.
I smile at the man sitting across from me.
Sam looks at Dean and smiles, “Tomorrow is Sunday, we all know where he will be in the morning. We could meet at the church and form a plan from there. But I think Charlie is right, Cas will be more likely to accept the invitation if it came from Dean.”
Because I am slowly dying.
Castiel’s attention leaves Meg and lands on me. “My purpose is to aid people, not to simply complete the work for them.”
Ash looks at me with a wolfish smile on his face, “Loser has to do the ultimate physical challenge.”
“Cassie, I do not care if I get caught. I cannot just sit by and watch them do this to you. I need to help you in whatever ways that I can. I have tried reasoning with them, but they failed to listen. I cannot sit and watch you in pain. If it is my last act tending to your wounds, then so be it.”
“Of course. Speaking of which, I picked up your work for you today, it is in my room. I will get it for you after I apply your bandages.”
“It is my friends. But I want you to know that I didn’t invite them, alright.”
“There is a big hole in my chest,
“Why are you telling me this?” Dean questions.
Not knowing what to say, Castiel offers a shy smile. Castiel turns his attention away from the man and walks back towards Chuck.
I step down from the stage and return the guitar to its rightful owner. As I walk back to my table I notice Cas is smiling at me.
“Do you have a preferred spot to hang out on the beach or is anywhere fine?” Dean asks as they walk down the path.
A smile crosses Dean’s features but he doesn’t dare to move his gaze from Cas’. “Why didn’t you say anything?”
Oh, be something you love and understand
“How do you not know who I am talking about?” Gabriel questions, aggravation slipping into his voice. “He says that you will not leave him alone and that you are making him uncomfortable. He says you keep asking him out and putting him in a difficult position. So, why? Why do you have an interest in him all of a sudden?”
Dean is still uncertain about his feelings towards the angel. The angel means a lot to him and has impacted his life greatly. But the only love that the older Winchester has experienced is familial love, the love that you have for a brother. If Dean did not love Cas like a brother then what was it he felt towards the angel? Is it something stronger?
“I doubt that,” Dean contradicts.
The smell of blood is still fresh in my nose; the sting from my wounds is still so fresh it is almost as if I am still being beaten. I hold back a grimace of pain. I feel tears prickling in my eyes, but not wanting to cry in school, I blink them away.
I tilt my head in confusion. “Well, I don’t need your help. And I don’t understand why you would help me, even if you thought I was ‘attractive,’ when you have never helped me before.”
When Castiel opens his mouth to speak, Naomi slaps him.
“I know I am,” I say. I move to place some ointment onto his chest wounds. “And that is why I have made arrangements for you to hang out on Saturday.”
Your strong calloused hands all over me.
Dean pulls up in front of my house and cuts the ignition. “Wow, you live here?”
“Hello,” I say nervously into the microphone, grateful that there are many unfamiliar faces staring at me. “My friend Charlie encouraged me to do this. She thought you would all want to hear something that I wrote.”
“Oh, Dean,” Castiel says. “The moment I laid a hand on you I knew you were special. It was when Metatron took my grace that I realized the extent of my feelings for you.”
“She is in love with him,” Sam clarifies. “She may not be willing to give you the information you seek. And she will be mad as hell when she realizes that you’re trying to take him from her.”
I head to the section I indicated and take a seat at one of the desks to make the most of my time.
“Then let’s get going,” Dean says.
“Then why do it at all,” I growl harshly.
“If I recall correctly, I already gave you my answer,” Cas smugly states.
“Alright,” comes Cas’ easy reply. Dean can tell that Cas is smiling by the crinkle of his eyes.
“Because no one ever wants to hang out with me, not without ulterior motives,” I state matter of factly.
“Why is he leaving? He didn’t even go into the water.”
“I still don’t know why I bother doing this. Praying seems pointless. And you haven’t even been answering my prayers, but that is to be expected with you restoring Heaven and all. And who’s to say that today will be any different?”
Dean smiles, “That was a beautiful poem, Cas.”
I have read the Bible, a good many times, and nowhere in it does it specify that homosexuality is a sin. It is all about interpretations. And unfortunately for me I am stuck with the family that holds the old and archaic view.
I try to push Lucifer off and make an escape. But his grip holds firm. Lucifer slams me back into the locker being sure to press his body close to mine.
The walk from the cafe to Dean’s black muscle car is a short one.
“My favorite character is Luna Lovegood,” Castiel says. “I really love how she embraces who she is and doesn’t care what others think of her. It is an attitude that I wish I had.”
“Unfortunately not. I am losing my grace and as such the ability to see your soul. But that doesn’t mean anything, Dean, because your soul is reflected in your heart. Your heart is filled with so much love.”
“You promise you only want to be his friend and nothing more?” Gabriel asks for clarification.
“It is one of the many songs my mom used to sing to me when I was little. Whenever I find myself in difficult times, I hear her soft voice singing those words to me. It is as if I heard her singing to me yesterday, not thirteen years ago.”
A shiver goes through Castiel’s body before he can stop it. Chuck flashes him an evil smile before he goes in search of his wife, leaving Castiel to greet the guests.
Marv gives a small smile. “Yes, I am doing better, Castiel.” Marv falters as he walks, “I want to thank you for the kindness that you offered me.”
Without another word, I open the car door and step out of the vehicle.
“Well, I think it is perfect as is,” I admit.
Castiel acknowledges by nodding in my direction. His gaze never leaves the female and he talks to her as though he wasn’t interrupted.
“And be a simple kind of man
Oh, won’t you do this for me son if you can.
Castiel is at church when Dean approaches him and asks him to attend a party later.
“Thanks, Sammy. That actually sounds like a good place to start.”
Castiel nods. “I will wait for you right here and look for a case.”
And that was the truth. Dean wasn't obsessing over trying to free Sam like he thought he would, he wasn't spending every hour of the day trying to devise a plan to rescue Sam. Granted, Dean spends hour upon hour looking into lore on Hell and how to get in/out to devise a plan, but it has all been futile. And sure there were nights Lisa would find him passed out with a bottle of whiskey in his hand and a open book on his chest. But he wasn't letting it control his life.
“Dean,” Cas says. His voice is far away.
“It will be a couple of minutes,” Castiel says as he climbs the stairs towards his bedroom.
“I am inclined to agree with Lucifer on this one,” Raphael says as he levels Michael with a glare.
“I don’t know. And it is not my job to find out, it’s yours. If you want Castiel to believe that you are really interested in him, then you will do this.”
“Why would you do that?” Chuck interrogates.
“Challenge accepted,” I say after a moment.
It is Ash’s voice that pulls me back to the conversation. “That is who we are choosing, Dean-o.”
I smile, thankful that Dean was not judging me. “Well, I hope this experience is good for you,” I say with honest conviction.
Before I can offer another suggestion, not that I wanted to anyways, Dean says, “I have never been to a poetry reading before, this should be interesting.”
“It does,” Cassie says, and I can hear a small chuckle escape from him.
My name is called to the stage and I panic not knowing what is happening.
“Because I am not good with people,” I answer.
“I can go with someone else, the thing is I don’t want to. I want to go with you,” Dean answers.
Castiel smiles at Dean. “If that is what you want, then, yes. I would love to hunt with you Dean.” Castiel squeezes Dean's hand. “After all, someone has to look after you and make sure you do not do anything stupid.”
And I long for the next moment you say my name
Dean’s gaze falls on me as I admire the vehicle and after a couple of moments I stop my admiration and join him against the car.
“Not to be rude, but you have the biggest mouth that I know. You can’t keep a secret.”
“From a distance I have admired,
Continuation of the date (part three of three).
Another pause, this one slightly uncomfortable.
“Why wouldn’t it be?” I ask.
“Look, I am seeing Cassie later, I can let him know that you want to talk to him.”
“I was thinking we could go to the cafe a few blocks over. They make a good cup of coffee and have wonderful pastries,” I answer.
Castiel rolls his eyes and turns his attention back to the computer.
“Fine, I will tell you the truth,” Dean states as he looks over his shoulder to make sure his friends are not listening. “I feel connected to you in a way that I have never been connected to anyone. And if I am being honest, it kind of scares me.”
It is the big day, Dean comes to Castiel's house to pick him up for a day out together.
“I love you too, my angel, my Castiel.”
“What?” I ask, confused.
Sam smiles at his brother, “Thank you for telling me, Dean. I am sorry if I made you feel as though you had to. I want you to know that I support and love you no matter what. You being bisexual isn’t going to change anything between us.”
“How so,” Benny asks.
“Dean I cannot tell you how you feel about him, only you know how you feel about him.” Sam levels a look at his brother, “I will tell you one thing though, you do not think of him as a brother.”
“He is coming this way,” Garth states, pulling Dean from his conversation with Benny. And Dean is thankful for the interruption.
“So, how long have you been writing poetry,” I ask, hoping it is a safe topic.
“Alright, I guess,” Cas answers.
Dean opens his mouth to speak but pauses because he didn't know what to say.
Dean can see the moment that Castiel’s eyes clear. “Dean?” Dean sees fear flash into his angel’s eyes. “Are you real?”
Dean places the cooler in the sand and approaches Castiel for his bag, taking a blanket out and laying it down on the sand. “Yeah, I was telling Gabe about this one while we were waiting for you.”
“Alright,” Cas concedes. “We can go out. Once. There is no guarantee that it will happen again.”
The sight before him makes him stop to catch his breath. Dean is in the doorway wearing swim trunks and a t-shirt.
I am about to open my mouth and thank Michael for coming to my aid. But Michael cuts me off.
“Why did you choose that song, if you don’t mind my asking?”
“Let me ask you this: before today, did you ever notice Castiel?”
“You make it sound easy, Dean. How do you suppose you will find Cas?”
But that is not what I got. Instead, I got a beating.
“Because he was in need of help,” Castiel states, hoping that is answer enough.
And no matter how much small talk you attempt to make
“Well, for starters he might think you are using him as a rebound. And no one wants to be a rebound, Dean.”
“You can pull over here. I do not mind walking the rest of the way,” I say as I attempt to open the door.
After several minutes of contemplation, Castiel settles for his everyday attire - a pair of black slacks and a button down shirt. He trades his usual white button down for a darker one, though.
“Sure,” Cas says.
“So, you want to go because it is poetry night,” Dean asks. I can hear the hesitation in Dean’s voice, I know it is not an activity that most people would enjoy doing. But if Dean wanted something more entertaining than he should have chosen what we do instead.
Charlie chuckles, “Of course, I know Dean. He is like a brother to me.” Charlie levels Dean with a small glare, “And how long have I been trying to get you to come visit me while I am at work? Don’t answer that. I am just glad that you finally did.”
“I pray to Castiel,” Dean begins.
This is a fantasy to which I clutch,
Dean claps his hands together nervously. “Why don’t we get you home? I wouldn’t want to make you late for your curfew.”
“Castiel,” Marv’s voice calls the young man’s attention. “It is a pleasure to see you again.” Marv places a hand on Castiel’s shoulder and gives it a light squeeze. “Walk with me?” he asks.
“Thanks,” Cassie says after a moment.
“Good,” Cas says with a smile on his face. “And while we are being honest with each other, I should tell you that I have had a crush on you since we met.”
“Wait,” Dean says, stopping Castiel in his tracks. “My friend is having a party later and I was wondering if you would like to come with me.”
“Only if it is the truth, I wouldn’t want you to stroke my ego.”
“There is. And maybe there is an explanation for why he did that. But you would need to ask him, not me.”
Sam notes that he holds himself so stiffly, stiff enough that it must be uncomfortable. And that whenever the other man tries to relax his body, a shudder would work its way down his spine and he goes back to being stiff.
“But shouldn’t we be helping father make his life a living hell?” Lucifer asks.
“Cas, I know I already asked this but I figure this revelation may have changed some things, so I am going to ask again.” At Cas’ nod Dean continues, “Will you come to Ash’s party with me?”
But it was starting to make sense to him now. He could never love her the way she deserves to be loved because he is already in love with someone else, always has been. He is in love with the angel who saved him from Hell.
“You didn't deserve that... You deserve so much better,” Dean prays to Castiel. “You deserve to be happy, you deserve to be loved every minute of every day. And if you will have me, I promise that I will do that for you. I will make you happy and show you how much I love you. Because I do, Cas. I know I have never been able to say it before but it is true. I love you, Castiel. And I need you to come back to me. Because I cannot live without you again.”
But I must behove
I slowly make my way to the stage and search my mind for something that would not make me look like an idiot.
“Alright, Gabe.”
“Technically a song is just a poem played with music,” Cas states.
I smile at Gabriel’s retreating form.
“Why?”
“Was the poem at the cafe about me?” Cas nods. “What about the poem you read yesterday at the beach?” Cas nods. “How come you never told me how you felt?”
“I can give you a ride home,” I offer, not wanting our night to end just yet.
Castiel watches the scene before him and rolls his eyes. Castiel opens his bag and pulls out his book and opens it with a sigh.
“Oh,” is all that comes out.
And before Dean can respond I hastily retreat to class.
And if you do this it’ll help you
“No, it is alright, I can walk home,” Cas replies.
Dean smiles shyly at the compliment. I cannot help but return Dean’s smile with one of my own.
“Yeah,” Gabriel answers. “He said he went out with a friend after he finished his shift at the library. And I know he wasn’t hanging out with me or Meg, so I asked him who it was; Cassie informed me that it was a new friend he made, that it was you. He told me he was conflicted and confused; he thinks you are leading him on.”
“Gabe,” Castiel starts, “my life isn’t worth it.”
“How do we invite him? I don’t have his phone number,” Dean states.
“Not a clue, baby brother.”
Dean looks at Castiel confused, “Who was making fun of you?”
“That is not the only reason I came over here,” Dean states after a moment.
“I get lost in eyes so green -
“I don’t really know, if I am being honest. But it probably has to do with the fact that the water over here is a lot rockier.”
“I apologize for keeping you waiting.”
This poem is really insightful of Castiel's character. He is in love with Dean and is hurt because the man of his affections has failed to notice him. And then the man of his affections fell in love with someone else (Lisa). Castiel was never noticed by Dean, something that I tried to make clear in the first chapter when Dean has to ask who he is. And Castiel is hurting because he thinks that he could never have a relationship with Dean.
“Winchester,” someone calls, pulling me out of my thoughts. I look up and catch sight of a blond man walking towards me. “We need to talk,” the man says with ire in his voice.
Castiel looks at the older Winchester, “You soul was calling out to me.”
“Why do you doubt me?” Cas asks.
“I guess,” I state.
“I am heartbroken
I nod.
Baby, be a simple kind of man.”
“I can work with that,” Dean replies as he walks them to a less crowded area. “No one really comes on this side, so it should just be us.”
Dean looks at the angel confused, “No, I don’t think you ever have.”
Castiel says goodbye to his brother and closes the door behind him. Not long after the door is closed, Dean is dragging him to his car with excitement in his gait, “We are going to have so much fun today.”
And make pictures with my imagination.
“Thanks,” Dean says as he leans against the car.
“Dean, you will always catch my attention, no matter what,” Castiel admits.
“You spend more time there than any other teen. Are you in some religious cult?” she asks.
“Maybe you could take him to do something fun, I am sure Cassie will like that. It will help get his mind off of more pressing things and make it easier for you to talk to him. I will tell him you will pick him up on Saturday around lunchtime. Does that work for you?”
“And what is that supposed to mean,” Jo asks.
“You are nothing if not persistent,” Cas comments.
The Empty had come to take Cas away.
“You really think so?” Benny asks quietly.
Cas nods in acknowledgment before he returns to walking Meg through writing her research paper.
“Well, you do,” Cas says with a smile. “It is the most beautiful soul I have ever seen.”
“Yeah, he is a good guy despite the tough home life,” Charlie says. “It sucks that he only has three people who support him.”
“It is complicated,” comes my response.
“Why the sarcasm?”
“Thanks,” Dean smiles. Dean shifts from foot to foot nervously, “So, what did you have in mind for us tonight?”
Sam rolls his eyes. “So, what happened that you need my advice about?”
“Oh, yes it is. It might not be to mom and dad but it is to me.”
At Sam’s disapproving look, I add, “I am genuinely interested in this guy.”
“The Shurley’s.”
“Well, I don’t know how Dean feels about you, but if it was what you wanted, then yes. You know I would keep this secret for you.”
“Gabe’s right, I will wait.”
“You are a sinner and we would all be better if you were not around.” Another punch to the gut almost has me throwing up my breakfast. But I force it down.
“I would have to say The Goblet of Fire,” Castiel says after taking a moment to think about it. “What would you say yours is, Sam?”
My love will never expire
I am speechless. I did not expect my poem to have such a positive reaction. I take a moment to listen to the applause and accept it for what it is: praise. The applause dies down.
Castiel flips to the page with his most recent poem and flashes a small smile at Charlie. “Just so you know this is in its early stages,” Castiel says to Charlie quietly. “It doesn't have a name yet, maybe you can help me come up with one. Anyways, here is what I have so far.
“And how do I decide which articles to use?” Meg asks as she suggestively leans on the reference desk.
“I am not spending time with you,” Castiel admits. “The only reason I came out today was because my brother told me you wanted to be friends with me. But that is not the vibe I am picking up from you. You take me out and then ditch me when your 'real' friends arrive. I get it, alright. You just brought me here to make fun of me.”
I simply chose the song because I feel like it really relates to Dean's character in this story. I can picture Mary singing this song to Dean when he was younger; it is her way of giving him life advice and telling him he is not alone as she is watching over him. And I feel like for that reason, it would hold a special place in Dean's heart.
“Well there is no more me and Lisa. Hopefully though tonight is the start of me and you.”
Meg is about to ask another question when I interrupt, “At this point, you should just ask him to write the paper for you.”
“What else do you know about him?” I ask curiously.
Dean cannot help but think as he watches Cas walk away. Dean knows that he should follow after Cas but he can’t bring himself to do it.
“That is enough,” Michael calls.
“Hello Dean,” Castiel greets. He reaches for another paper towel and presses it to his ear.
Cas looks over Dean’s shoulder at the group of friends loitering by the Impala. “Why does it matter to you so much that I go to this party? Can’t you just bring someone else?”
The distance between them close again, their lips meeting for longer this time. The empty feeling within Dean's chest subsides and he is overwhelmed with happiness.
Troubles will come and they will pass
As Dean crosses through the portal he recites the spell Jack gave him. A trail of a light blue wispy light appears in front of Dean on the final words. He smiles to himself knowing that at the end of this trail Cas will be waiting.
“Well, here I am,” Dean smiles.
“I see a beautiful man with a beautiful heart,” Cas states.
Dean has been praying to his angel best friend for months but it has all been in vain. Castiel never answers his prayers, never comes to see him. And while Dean understands that the angel has obligations to Heaven, he cannot help but feel empty inside.
“Awesome. Does tonight work for you?”
“Do you want the honest answer or what I have been telling Sammy?” I ask.
Knowing you will never feel the same
“Get off of me,” I grunt. I struggle against his grip for a moment, hoping to loosen it.
It is not an unknown fact that I do not come from a place of money. All my life my family and I have had to work hard for what we have. And truthfully, I do not see the point in spending money on unnecessary things.
“I am sorry but you are going to have to be more specific, I am don’t who you are,” I reply.
I break the silence by asking, “Who was your poem about?”
My heart will still need gauze
“It is just that you and Castiel are so different. You are the popular jock and he is the nerdy kid. You would rather be out having a good time while he would prefer to focus on his studies. The popular kid only ever notices the nerd in stupid romcoms, never in reality.”
“Stop,” I grit between my teeth.
“He knows you want to be his friend, Dean, that much is clear. I mean it is why he agreed to come out with you today, right?” Charlie asks. At Dean’s nod, she flashes him a small smile. “He is just not used to having people in his life that he can rely on.”
And no matter how much I try to be strong
“I can’t,” Castiel says.
A voice pulls me out of my musings; it is deep and smooth and sends a shiver down my spine. “Here you go, Castiel.”
As I play the final chords of the song, applause fills the cafe.
“Alright, I will be waiting over there,” I say as I point to a section of the library not far away from the reference desk. “Come find me when you have the chance.”
“I am pretty sure that I just turned you down. And if memory serves correctly, I turned you down the other day too. Should I slap you in the face as well?”
“Only because you get in your head,” Sam responds.
“With this ache,
“Dude, I didn’t know that your family was rich or that you lived in a fucking mansion.” I feel Dean’s gaze on me and force myself to meet it. “Though it makes sense given the way you dress,” Dean comments.
I shift from foot to foot nervously, “I haven’t decided yet.”
I smile at my friends, glad to hear that at least they had a good weekend.
“What do you mean, what you want is not of import? Of course it is.”
“He told me,” is Charlie’s simple answer. “After we worked on the group project together last semester we realized we have a lot in common and started hanging out. And I would say that we have become friends, Meg begs to differ.”
Dean runs a hand through his hair, nervously. “I get it, you want me to go. But what would you say if I told you I didn’t want to?”
“Oh, I am not really a fan of the beach, is there nothing else we could do instead?” Castiel inquires.
Castiel and Dean’s first date (part one of three).
“We are, but it is getting late and I have a curfew. I do not want to imagine the consequences I might face if I am late; I cannot be late,” Cas states suppressing a shudder.
“The deep rumble of your voice
“Is everything alright Dean?” Castiel asks, worried about the hunter.
“I need to be heading home,” Cas answers.
For me there is no other choice
“You are quite welcome,” I say as I finish tying off the bandages. “But, as I said, bandaging you up was the least I could do.”
“Alright,” Dean says as he searches for the sandwich in the cooler. Dean passes the sandwich to Castiel and takes one for himself.
“Really?” Sam asks after a moment.
Trigger warning: mentions of abuse
“Yes,” Dean answers.
“I can assure you that Cas is nothing like his family,” Dean states casually.
“That sounds a bit wise for you,” Sam says. He looks at me and rolls his eyes. “So, who is this guy?”
“No, don't apologize,” Castiel says, cutting Dean off. “Because I know you don't mean it.  You would rather hang out with your friends than hang out with me, I get it. I was just too stupid to realize it before now.”
“Cas,” Dean starts, “Please don't go.”
“Well, Dean and I were hanging out before all of you arrived,” Castiel admits quietly.
“Definitely The Philosopher’s Stone. You can’t have the rest of the series without the first one,” Charlie says.
“Take a seat, Cassie, while I get the things to tend to your wounds.”
“I can’t,” comes Cas’ reply.
“Alright, but that doesn’t explain why you are there all the time.”
“What are you reading,” Sam asks, indicating the book in Castiel's lap.
“So you say.” Sam watches me for a moment before he clears his throat and inquires, “Why the sudden interest in him anyways?”
“Alright. It looks like we agreed on the terms of this bet. To recap, I need to get Castiel to fall in love with me in six weeks and if I don’t I will do the polar plunge. But if he falls in love with me, you need to do the polar plunge.”
“Yes,” Dean answers.
“Mama told me when I was young
Dean unlocks the passenger side door and I slide into the passenger seat, careful to keep enough distance between us.
“Castiel,” Charlie all but squeals. “I was wondering if you were stopping by tonight. It is so good to see you. I take it you are here for poetry night.”
After what feels like hours, silence finally comes - no cries, no pleas, and no screams. A door at the end of the hallway slams and I know that my parents have left Cassie’s room.
“Remember our bet, Dean,” Benny whispers into his ear. “Tomorrow will mark one week. And it seems that you are no closer to getting him to fall for you than you were when this bet started.”
Charlie lets out a laugh. “Well, I hope you do. I have read some of your poems and they are beautiful. It is a shame you are letting your talent go to waste by not sharing it with the world.”
“It all depends on my motivations for writing and my mood,” Cas starts, “but most of the time, yes.”
I apply gauze to his chest and advise him to hold it for a moment while I apply gauze to his back. Keeping the gauze patches in place with one hand, as I grab a bandage wrap and begin to wrap it around Cassie’s chest and back. When the wrap is secured on Cassie, it looks like he is wearing a muscle shirt.
“Thanks, Cas,” Dean says with a smile on his face.
Baby be a simple kind of man
Charlie waves me over and I go to her without much thought. She makes her way around the counter and pulls me into a hug.
“We have a bet.”
If you are returning to this work, I advise you that a lot of changes have been made. It is probably best to start from the beginning.
“After Lucifer killed you, I was lost. I prayed for God to bring you back and when he didn’t I was devastated. I threw myself into hunting and was always angry, though I suppose I am always angry. But I took it out on Sam and the kid. I was just so lost. I didn’t know who I was anymore. And what I saw I didn’t like.”
Dean helps Castiel stand on his feet, wrapping his arms around Castiel’s waist when Cas stumbles forwards. “Don’t worry, I got you angel. I am not letting go anytime soon.”
Dean lets out a laugh. “You can wear whatever you want. I was just thinking that if you wanted to go into the water that it would be more comfortable to wear swim trunks.”
“I don’t,” Cas admits. “Want to slap you that is,” he clarifies after a moment.
“Have you decided whether or not you are willing to let me read some?” I ask.
“What happened?” Ash questions.
Disclaimer: I do not own or have any rights to the song Simple Man by Lynyrd Skynyrd. The song belongs to it respective owners.
“You bring disgrace to our house,” Raphael taunts as he pounds against my stomach.
And all these shed tears
“Was it cheating playing a song rather than reciting a poem?” I inquire.
Ash leans against a locker and looks at me. “My weekend was alright. I just did the usual, get high and play video games til I remembered I had homework. Quite frankly, I am surprised I managed to get it all done this time,” Ash says.
“Have you tried telling him that?” Gabriel asks with a raised eyebrow. “Because Cassie is under the impression that you want to be more than friends.”
“Because that is what you do when you are attracted to someone and want them to notice you,” Dean replies.
“But how can we show him that people want to be his friend?” Dean questions.
“There is this guy I am interested in getting with and I am worried that I struck out with him before something even started.”
I give my friends a small smile, grateful for their words and friendship. “Thanks, it means a lot to have you two in my corner,” I state.
“I know things have been difficult for you Dean. And I should have come to see you, even if only for a short time,” Cas says as he sits next to Dean.
“You aren’t,” Cas asks disbelievingly.
“Because from where I am standing, he wants nothing to do with you,” Benny replies softly.
“Then how can you be friends with Charlie? You do know that she is a lesbian, right?” Jo questions.
“Yay,” Cassie says with sarcasm.
“I take it this connection is new to you,” Cas asks with a faraway look.
“Yes but why?” Dean inquires.
Dean rolls his eyes, “But you told me you would think about it.”
I shrug feigning like I didn’t care. But the truth is, Cas is a nickname that I actually like; it is far better than the nickname all of my foster siblings call me: Cassie.
“Why? I thought we were having a good time.”
“Of course, you know I am bisexual,” I answer.
“No,” I reply.
Charlie shakes her head, “How many times do I have to tell you he wasn’t lying? Honestly, I don't even think he could lie if his life depended on it. Jo, you need to ease up on him, he was nothing but supportive when I told him I was attracted to females. And he would be a hypocrite if he wasn’t supportive. He doesn’t have the easiest home life.”
“Exactly, that is why I didn't tell you, Castiel. And I keep telling you that you are an amazing poet and need to share your poems with the world. And it is the truth. This prize just goes to show how amazing you were. I know it is not much and you deserve so much more than a $20 gift card to the cafe, but here,” Charlie says as she hands him over his prize.
“And I appreciated you sharing your poem,” I say.
“This is the database we use here and it’s quite simple to navigate through. Type your topic or some keywords into the search bar and a list of articles will appear based on relevance. You can filter the results too. I recommend only using articles within the last ten to twenty years, anything older than that is considered outdated, especially with sciences.”
“I did tell you that and I did think about it.”
"Thanks,  but it's not finished," Castiel says.
“Around lunchtime. He should be here soon,” Gabriel says as he lounges on Castiel’s bed.
“It is I who should be thanking you, Dean. You have shown me what it means to be human and how to love,” Cas starts. “Because I do love, Dean, whether you believe that or not; it is why I failed as an angel.” Cas meets Dean’s gaze, “I love you, Dean Winchester.”
“And I would prefer it if I drove you home that way I know you get home safely,” I state.
Longing for the one person who changed my world, who changed me.
Gabriel, who has been leaning against the door, lets out a chuckle. “That is complete bullshit Cassie and you know it. Just go change.”
“For years,” Cas answers. “Writing poetry is my way of dealing with things; it is a place where I can express my feelings.”
“Cassie, get your ass down here,” Gabe shouts up the stairs.
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel says as he addresses the older Winchester.
Charlie levels Dean with one of her looks before saying, “Do you really need to ask?”
With your relationship and love so true,
Dean waves his hand dismissively. “I know. And I get that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.” Dean sits on one of the beds and indicates for Cas to sit on the other.
“And why do you say that?” I inquire.
“Oh. Well that throws a hammer in things.”
“Yeah, I guess,” Dorothy states.
Oh, be something you love and understand
“I was thinking that you could pick what we do. I want to do something you like,” I say, recalling Sam’s advice.
“I didn’t mention it earlier, but you have a lovely car,” I say as I gently run a hand over the car’s polished frame.
“You’re bleeding. Are you alright?” Dean asks, indicating the blood dripping down Castiel's face and to his collar.
I nod in agreement hesitantly. “I wouldn’t want that either,” I say truthfully, not knowing what punishment I may face if I am late.
“He was upset last night?”
The angel is quite attractive. He has beautiful ocean blue eyes and his perpetual bedhead is adorable. When Cas smiles, Dean’s heart flutters and Dean knows he would go through great lengths to make the angel smile again. Castiel also has numerous personality traits that are admirable – like his selflessness and loyalty. He has a kind heart and is almost always there when Dean needs him. He has become someone Dean has come to rely on.
“Fine,” Cas retorts.
“Peanut butter and jelly, please.”
A smile crosses Castiel’s features as he looks around the area that Dean found for them, it is indeed less crowded than the rest of the beach. “Why does no one else come over here?” Castiel asks.
I rummage through my bookbag looking for the poem that I have been working on.
Dean shrugs his shoulders, “As I said, he is nothing like his family, though Gabe isn’t that bad either.”
“I bet you cannot get someone to fall in love with you in six weeks,” Ash states.
“Dean, have I ever told you that you have a beautiful soul?” Castiel asks.
“Because I can,” I reply.
“So, will you come with me?”
I let my thoughts wander to the evening prior when I told his foster family my deepest secret.
“Don’t worry about it,” Dean says. Dean takes a seat on the blanket and pats next to it, indicating that Castiel should do the same. “You want something to eat?”
“Really?” Cas asks disbelievingly.
“Forget you lust for the rich man’s gold
Lucifer grinds up against me, “You like that, don’t you?” he whispers into my ear.
Cas chuckles into Dean’s shoulder and relaxes into the hug. “Why did you come after me?”
Castiel is standing by the main door of the church and greeting individuals as they enter. Charles is standing by Castiel and going over the sermons that he has planned for the morning.
“Sure,” Charlie winks at him. “Oh and by the way just wanted to let you know that you won the prize from the other day.”
But writing them may help me mend.
I know I do not fit into your normal crew
“Flattery won't get you anywhere.” Castiel looks off at the horizon and just stares at the waves crashing against the rocks for a moment. “Dean, I don't think us being friends is going to work out. Maybe it worked out on paper but not when executed. I just don't think you took into account how different we are. So, thank you for wanting to be my friend. But we just can't, it never would have worked out anyway.”
I catch his gaze and give a small nod. “Yeah, it is. He says he wants to be there for you.”
“That works for me,” I say.
It is around noon when church lets out, Dean and the gang are waiting by the Impala for Cas.
“But what if he doesn’t like who I am?”
Also, Jensen Ackles has a cover of this song (https://youtu.be/hKMbXOwXSdM) if you haven't listened to it, I would strongly recommend because his voice in this song is that of an angel.
“You heavily implied it and that is just as bad as saying it. Not everything in my life is dictated by my father or the Bible,” Castiel states, no longer able to hide his ire. “I am my own person, free to like whatever I want, no matter how much my parents don't like it. I am no different from you, so why are you treating me like I am?”
Castiel nods, “Yes and I should get going, the sermons are about to start.”
“Oh, I didn’t think you were serious about that,” Cas admits.
This fic has been rewritten since it was originally posted.
“Definitely the books,” Castiel answers. “There is so much that happens in the books that doesn’t happen in the movies.”
“We should let him know that there are other people who want to be his friend. I mean, I want to be his friend, but no matter what I say he doesn't believe me,” Dean states.
“Yes.”
“Because you looked like you could use a hand and I am trying to be nice. Plus, I think you are pretty attractive.”
“Thanks,” Castiel responds. He takes a bite out of his sandwich, “This is my favorite kind of sandwich. But I only like it if it is made with jelly, I am not to fond of it with jam; I think the jam ruins it.”
Are like constellations.
Castiel nods taking in all of the information Charlie just provided him with.
“So, I am special to you because we share a connection you have never had before.” Cas asks for clarification.
“I have known you for years, heck, we have even had classes together. And you have never noticed me, never acknowledged my existence. So, what changed? Why do you want to be my friend, or whatever it is you want to be, now?”
“Because that is the place that my parents always took me.”
Cas smiles at me, “It sounds like Sam means a lot to you.”
“What do you mean by that?” I ask.
“I was hoping to use it as an excuse to ask you out,” Dean says.
Dean smiles at the angel standing before him and pulls Cas into a big hug. “Don’t you ever make a deal like that again.”
I recognize that tone in Cas’ voice. It means this is the only chance that I get, the only chance I have to make a good impression rather than coming across as an asshat. “When you are finished with Meg, can we talk?”
We shake on it.
“That makes sense. You must know, there is nothing wrong with the way you dress, Cas. If you like it, then that is all that matters.”
Dean kneels in front of Castiel and smiles, despite seeing the distant look in his best friend’s face. “Cas,” Dean says again as he tentatively reaches out to put a hand on his angel’s shoulder. “Cas.”
“He is going home. He made it clear that he wants to be left alone, for now. It is best if I do not follow him,” Dean says.
I level Cas with a glare, a bit surprised how he can go from being friendly albeit a bit shy to closed off in moments. “There you go again. You know you don’t need to be like that.”
“Thanks,” Cas says with a small smile.
“I would love to read more of your work,” I say.
Dean smiles and pulls the angel into another quick kiss. He needs to go and retrieve his belongings and end things with Lisa before he can move on and be happy. Because Cas makes Dean happy and so does hunting. And hunting with Cas, now nothing could be more perfect than that.
Jo snorts, “Good, I couldn’t take anymore of his lies.”
I cannot help but chuckle at her failed flirtation because it’s clear Castiel was oblivious to it. Cas turns his computer around to show her his screen.
“And be a simple kind of man
When Jack pulls back from the hug, Sam places a hand on his shoulder. “Jack, why don’t you and I go start on making some snacks. I am sure Cas is hungry.” Before Jack, or Cas, can comment on the fact that angels don’t need to eat, Sam is dragging the young nephilim out of the room.
“I didn’t say that you were,” Jo states.
“I like the sound of that,” Cas says with a smile on his face.
Castiel is rummaging through his closet looking for something to wear. “That doesn’t really help, you know.”
“I figured as much,” Sam states. “She was basically implying that because he is religious he believes that homosexuality is a sin, even though Cas says that he is not of that belief.”
“Dean, I have looked upon your soul with my own eyes and that of many others. I can assure you that no soul compares and I am not just saying that. Your soul shines brighter than any other soul, even after it was tarnished while you were in Hell.”
“Normally, I would,” Gabriel starts, “but Cassie isn’t here today.”
“No, there is nothing wrong with moving on, Dean. I am just surprised that you are doing it so soon,” Sam responds.
“Wait, what?” Dean asks.
“Nothing,” I lie, but I quickly follow it with a half-truth, “I just want to be there for him, you know, as his friend.”
I sigh and kneel to gather my belongings that are scattered in the hallway. No one seems to notice the obstructions on the floor or the fact that one of their peers was just being bullied. And it pisses me off.
“Sure, whatever you say, Dean,” Sam says disbelievingly.
Dean nods at the suggestion, “Can’t go wrong with coffee and pastry. It sounds nice.”
“It was my pleasure to help you. I just wish I could have been of more help,” Castiel admits.
“You just need practice in social communication,” Dean states. “Which brings me to the real reason I came over,” he adds.
Dean is in a dingy motel room kneeling in front of one of the two beds (having booked a room with two beds out of habit). Things were difficult for the hunter and his life wasn’t what it should be.
“Well, he wants to get to know you outside the school setting. The best way to do that is to hang out outside of school. Hence why he asked you to hang out with him,” I say.
I watch several emotions cross Cas’ features, Cas opens and closes his mouth several times. And I swear I know what the other man is about to say. But to my surprise, Cas doesn’t offer condolences. Instead he says, “I think it is sweet that you chose a song that is so personal to you. It must have been hard for you to sing it in front of all these people.”
“That probably would help, Cas.” Dean rests one of his hands on top of Castiel’s. “But I shouldn’t expect you to drop everything for me whenever I call.”
“I am so sorry to hear that Dean. I know how much she meant to you.”
Dean could hear his phone ringing but ignored it, knowing it was probably Sam calling to check in on him.
“That must have been hard for you,” Cas comments.
“It is not the life any kid wants nor is it the life I would wish upon anyone. It’s quite difficult to make friends when you are only in places for a short time. Most of my life I only had Sammy. And before we moved in with Uncle Bobby, the longest we ever stayed in one place was a month, two at the most. All I ever wanted was a place to call home, a place for Sammy to have a life. I was used to moving around but for Sam it was difficult, he hated that we never stayed in a place long. But I am grateful for Uncle Bobby, he took us in and gave us a home.”
“But this isn’t about what I want, you know that. No matter how much I want to be with Dean. It could never happen. It can’t happen. I cannot risk it, my life and my happiness do not matter. And you know as well as I that if Chuck and Naomi found out about my feelings for Dean, they would make me disappear.”
“How can it be both, Dean? It is a yes or no question.”
A pair of unforgettable green eyes lock with his blue eyes in the mirror. “Cas?” Dean asks.
“I did,” I admit.
You were never mine.
“We could have a party,” Ash states. “Do you think he would want to attend a party?” he asks Charlie.
“I don’t know, Dean,” Sam says. “But I am finding it hard to believe that you noticed him in the first place.”
“I want you to be comfortable with yourself, Dean. I want you to be able to express yourself freely, without worrying I will judge you. You are my brother and I love you no matter what.”
I smile. “It makes perfect sense, Cas. You said you can’t come out with me, not that you wouldn’t. So, some part of you wants to hang out with me.”
“So, would you be comfortable if the person we chose was a guy?” Benny asks.
Reminiscent of emeralds and grassy fields -
“Castiel Novak,” comes Benny’s reply.
“And what makes me so special, Dean Winchester?”
“I can’t.”
I start to walk in the direction of my class but a gentle hand on my wrist stops me.
“Yes. But they have to love all of you, faults and all, as you said,” Ash replies.
“It was but we managed. I much prefer the life we have now - it is much simpler but full of love and happiness. And that is all I ever wanted for Sammy.”
“Cassie, you cannot keep living for them. You need to live for yourself. Do the things that make you happy. Do what you love. Spend time with who you love.”
“Wait, you are telling me that it was an actual competition and not just a reading. Why am I only finding out about this now? If I had known I never would have participated.”
“Meg, just because we are friends does not mean I will let you manipulate me into doing your schoolwork for you. The best that I can do is provide you with the tools to do the assignment. You need to do the work yourself.”
“I don’t know, maybe.”
You would be the keeper of my heart.
The angel looks at Dean smiling at the hunter, reaching out to place a gentle hand on his shoulder, “I need you too, Dean, more than you will ever know.” Before Dean can stop himself, he is pulling Castiel into a hug. “I love you, Dean,” Castiel whispers to the hunter.
“Castiel, are you going to read tonight or are you just going to be sitting there looking pretty all night like usual?” Charlie teases.
Castiel moves his gaze off of Dean and to the floor contemplating on what Dean just said.
Sam motions for me to take a seat.  “And what can I help you with, Dean?” Sam asks as I take a seat across from him.
I got Cas to agree to go on a date with me. And though I have no idea what we’re doing, I cannot help but feel intrigued to be giving control to Castiel.
“This path that you have chosen is wrong, Castiel. Let us lead you back to the light and maybe God will forgive your sins.”
“Hey,” I greet them. “How was your weekend?” I ask.
Oh, how I could count them for weeks,
Sam puts together what is going on with Castiel.
“Alright. What is the catch?”
“And be a simple kind of man
Some sunny day, oh yeah.
“I don’t --
“Because it goes against the Bible. Isn’t it a sin to be homosexual?” Jo asks.
“Always, Dean,” the angel says.
“Sure, whatever you say, Dean,” Ash says disbelievingly.
“Go out on a date with me, Cas?” I ask, the words spilling from my lips before I could stop them.
