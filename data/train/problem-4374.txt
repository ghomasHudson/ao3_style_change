He hadn’t even noticed the three people shaking their heads at his behaviour.
Finally joining them, foregoing his chair to lower himself onto the towel spread out next to aforementioned idiots, Sam distributed the food amongst them.
Love, joy, happiness and the promise that
“Okay. Whatever helps you sleep at night.” Dean shook his head with a smirk and accelerated.
All the while Dean could just stare at the person before him.
He grabbed his angel’s elbow and led them out the door, leaving it ajar, making the yellow sign swing that hung from the wood, proudly declaring this room belonged to Maura Lillian – a name Sam had suggested and made Eileen cry in the process, consisting of the two mother figures that got taken from her far too early.
Deciding not to disturb them any longer Dean clapped Sam on the arm still wrapped around Eileen, gave Eileen a wide smile that she returned in kind as best as she could while being smothered and turned back to the Impala sitting on the curb. As he slid into the driver’s seat he yelled a quick “Sammy, don’t suffocate your girlfriend!” chuckled at the sight and put Baby in Drive.
“Why – Why would you even say that, all that crap. It’s not fair, Cas!” Dean’s voice rose in volume. Leaving the bottle behind on the floor, he got up and paced around the room in small circles, not being able to stay still any longer. “Why would you say that to me, make up a whole goddamn speech, right after announcing that dumbass deal with this dumbass entity and then… and then just…”
“Did you really think … When you took that deal, what were you thinking? ‘Well I ain’t ever gonna be happy anyway so whatever?’”
place.
Dean huffed a frustrated sigh and rubbed his hands over his face harshly. “It’s not. There’s virtually nothing about that hellhole in any of this shit. I thought the Men of Letters were oh so smart! How come none of their lore says anything about the Empty?”
Dean jumped when his spiralling thoughts were interrupted by the voice next to him. “W-What?”
When the rest of his bottle of scotch was gone so was Dean’s belief that he could find anything even remotely helpful. All the centuries of knowledge and he couldn’t find any way to get into the Empty. At this point he wouldn’t even care for a way out. He just wanted to get to Castiel. No matter how it was done.
The tears didn’t stop though.
But donning the coat now, feeling the tan fabric where he’d pushed the sleeves up, he felt an odd comfort he wouldn’t have understood back when he was still an angel.
He’d seen the movie before; Dean had made him watch it so he was allowed to lose himself in gazing at his face. He watched his expressions change from anticipation – as if he didn’t have the whole saga memorized by heart, Castiel thought as he rolled his eyes – to excitement, to laughter. Castiel found himself falling more in love with Dean each and every day. The way he experienced emotion so wholly even as he tried so hard to deny himself any portrayal of it fascinated the angel. No human had ever peaked his attention the way Dean Winchester had. When he had still been an angel, the interest in the hunter had been mostly curiosity. At least, that’s what he thought at the time. As time went on however and Castiel fell more and more away from Heaven’s grasp, he started to doubt the neutrality to his feelings. When he became human the first time, Castiel had finally been able to put a name to them.
Dean watched them with a fond expression and ignored the concerned look his brother shot him after he pulled away from the nephilim. Of course Sammy had put 2 and 2 together on why exactly Dean would have summoned Jack. Stanford kid wasn’t stupid after all.
Castiel hadn’t come along on their vamp hunt for two reasons. One, he was newly human – again – and Dean wanted him to get used to it first before taking risks. Of course his angel had huffed and puffed and argued but in the end had stayed home. Not necessarily because the hunter had insisted but because of the second reason: Claire had come through town on her way back from a simple ghost hunt and called them up to see if she could swing by.
He stood, paralyzed and could only watch with terror as a dozen or so of the demonic creatures made their way towards him, seemingly not in a hurry. Their prey wasn’t going anywhere so why rush?
The first time they’d went to play minigolf instead of watching a movie – mostly because Dean and Claire hadn’t stopped arguing over whether to watch Harry Potter or Indiana Jones and Sam had put a stop to it by announcing they were all going for a drive, post it notes still partially attached to the Impala’s hood – it had been a disaster. Sam had spent the evening trying to explain the game to Castiel and Jack and was almost knocked out by a golf club when he turned his back. To this day no one remembered if it was one of the beginners; all of them however suspected it had actually been Dean but couldn’t prove it since Claire had been quick to give him a solid alibi.
Been a while since one of us died, hasn’t it? … How fucked up have our lives been that that sentence even makes sense?
Dean’s face, wet from tears he couldn’t remember shedding, changed. Where once grief sat heavily in the lines of his skin, determination now resided.
The passionate kiss they shared in the entryway resulted in all the bar guests letting out Whoops. Or Charlie, Dean figured it was mostly Charlie who cheered them on.
The dress hadn’t fit her at first and Eileen had been sad until she told Castiel about it and he surprised everyone in the room – including Dean who never let him out of his sight for long – when he told her it wasn’t a problem. He was handy with a sewing machine. If Mildred didn’t mind, he could adjust it to fit her.
“Sorry for waking you up,” he signed.
“Well, Sam didn’t turn his alarm off before leaving for Eileen’s and it woke me this morning so I was gonna…” His grin disappeared quickly at the disapproving glare thrown his way. He couldn’t believe he was feeling chastised by an eyebrow. “Put my dirty socks in his drawer.”
Castiel beamed up at him and whispered, “I love you.”
Shielding his eyes against the setting sun’s bright light that beamed right into his face, Dean could only make out the shadowed form of a person until the door closed again.
“I am not lying. I’m not injured.” Castiel glared at him, irritation clearly visible but something else shone in his eyes that Dean couldn’t quite decipher.
Sam made an effort to breathe in slowly through his nose, out through his mouth and after a couple more minutes, his breathing was close to normal again. He sank back into the pillows, bone tired now that the adrenaline left his body and gave Eileen an apologetic little smile.
Castiel looked down at the steaming coffee he was holding as he recounted, “You need to know first that when the Empty took me I had lost most of my grace so I was basically human at that point.”
spray paint?”
Castiel regarded him with a dead expression. “I think I would have punched you. Risen up from the Empty out of pure desire to punch you in the face.”
Dean noticed that Castiel’s eyes shone from unshed tears and leaned over to Kelly. “I didn’t do a whole lot, honestly. It was all Cas. And maybe Sam, too. But really, Cas is the one you need to thank.” The hunter looked at his angel and a corner of his mouth quirked up. “Because he cared about Jack, we did. And rightfully so. Jack is awesome. He’s a great kid.”
They picked up people struggling to find their own kind and told them,
Next to him, Sam went still. Dean glanced at him from the side and promptly did a double take. His brother had gone white as a sheet and looked at him with a mix of horror and expectation.
“Hello, Dean.”
His eyes jumped back up to search the angel’s – well, the former angel’s – for the truth. Seeing only genuine composure Dean gave a small nod. “Okay. Okay. I guess … as long as you’re okay with it.”
The day Dean Winchester’s soul left this plane of existence for good, it was in calm silence.
But watching Dean Winchester play with his baby niece was the most wonderful thing he’s ever been lucky enough to bear witness to.
And he’d proved them right, too. He’d sold his soul so Sam would come back to him; he’d stopped his brother from closing the gates of Hell so he wouldn’t die. Hell, it went all the way back to the fact that Dean couldn’t even go look for their dad on his own. He just had to go to Stanford and make Sam come join him on his wild-goose chase. Drag him away from the life he had built for himself.
One corner of the angel’s mouth pulled down disapprovingly as he grabbed Dean’s left shoulder.
. He breathed out.
The hunter looked down at his hands, shaking where they were curled into fists next to his body. Then he raised his gaze again because he had to make sure Castiel understood what he was saying. “You make me a better man because you hold me accountable when I make stupid decisions. And we both know I make a shitton of those. And then – unlike so many people in my life – you don’t just leave when the going gets tough. You allow me to change for the better. More often than not that takes me a while and I know it’s gotta be frustrating as hell. But you say ‘Here’s where you went wrong’ and then you say ‘Fix it. I’ll be here in the meantime but you gotta put in the work.’”
“That’s Pokémon, Dean. Poke bowls are – nevermind.”
Trying to swallow the anxiety that rose in Dean’s throat like bile, his eyes darted around the forest, looking for some way out of this hell.
So Sam took a deep breath and explained all his worries and concerns to her.
“Don’t you try and lecture me. You’ve done it so many times. I made the right choice, I still believe that. And I would do it again.” The stubborn look had returned to the angel’s face and Dean knew he had to let it go if he didn’t want this to turn into a full blown fight.
Just a year before, he’d have laughed at anyone who dared ask him if he was happy, would have figured they were joking. Just a year before he hadn’t allowed himself to ever even imagine what ‘happiness’ could look like for him. He surprised himself a little when he could honestly answer, “Happier than I’ve been my entire life.”
Castiel regarded him questioningly with a head tilt.
“Dude, why didn’t you say anything?” At Castiel’s puzzled face, Dean elaborated. “You’re human! And that chair isn’t all that comfortable. Especially not to sleep in.”
Sam had made sure the lights were all turning on, had mopped up the dust and pulled off the sheets they’d thrown over the furniture a long time ago. He’d stocked the massive fridge in the kitchen with beer and filled the shelves with whiskey.
Sam – who didn’t faint, by the way, thank you very much – came striding over with big steps and surprise and happiness written on his face and pulled Jack up from Miracle and right into his arms. “Hey, Jack. Welcome home.”
And I would change a lot of it now that I’m older and smarter- Hey, stop laughing, I did get smarter! I would change a lot of it if it meant getting those people back, saving even just one more person.
!” meant anything,
Well, that’s the thing. Castiel had grunted he was fine and stomped right outside when they finally burned the golden locket that tied the spirit to this realm.
Returning back inside after watching Eileen’s red car drive off, Dean found Castiel cleaning up their trash. “Here, lemme help.” Dean grabbed some plates and empty bottles and they made their way to the kitchen.
Sitting down on the back porch, Dean stared at the little screen of the baby monitor he’d grabbed from the side table that showed the little girl and started talking, a far away look in his eyes, “One of the only memories I have of Mom before she died – well, before she died the first time, when I was four – is her singing me a lullaby every night.” Dean scrunched up his nose. “It wasn’t a lullaby, really. It was
We’ll see each other again soon but you better not be barging into heaven too soon, you hear me? You go and you live your life and I’ll be there with you, every step of the way.
When they pulled apart, a growling noise came from their position and all three men looked down at Castiel’s stomach with surprise.
She’d been integrated into the Winchester’s circle of people as soon as Sam had introduced her, but Eileen had found a kindred spirit in Castiel. They’d both started chattering amongst themselves in ASL the minute Castiel had come back, signing words so fast Sam and Dean had given up on following the conversation almost immediately.
“Cas. He’s back.”
Dean’s room was where they ended up. It gave the illusion of privacy even when no one else was in the bunker. Well, except Miracle but he was blissfully asleep in his bed in the library after having dinner and they didn’t want to disturb him.
The plan they’d come up with to work out where the vampires were hiding out turned out to be smooth sailing. A little dead man’s blood, a litte threatening, a little torturing and bingo.
Dean made the executive decision to do everything in his power to make his angel feel better.
Stumbling over the step leading up to the room, Dean had to grab the side of the doorframe for balance and came to a screeching halt there.
Then the angel put down the second stack on the bar top. “And that’s the last documents we still have to sign for the house.”
“As I told you before, Dean. I don’t kiss and tell.” The effect of her reply was lost however when she gave him a devilish grin that answered everything he wanted to know. And more.
Dean leaned in close to the older lady. “So you’re allowed into his backroom, huh? Thought nobody’s allowed in there.” He wiggled his eyebrows at the innuendo.
This time, they knew it was right.
“Missed you? I think that’s a bit of an understatement, Dean,” came the amused voice of Sam behind them.
“I know, Dean. I’m not happy about this either, believe me. But I have no power in the Empty.” Sadness joined kindness and sorrow.
Swallowing down his bite with a sip of his beer Dean gestured between his brother and his girlfriend. “Hey, no gossiping. What’re you two lovebirds talking about?”
“It’s just not possible. I’ve been ahead 10,000 points for years. No one’s ever beat me. I don’t believe you.” Dean smirked at her from where he was lying down on the other couch, Castiel curled up against him, a bowl of popcorn balancing precariously on his stomach.
Castiel looked at the both of them with squinted eyes, none of their answers were to his liking. He let it go though in favour of complaining some more. “And don’t even get me started on the peeing! It doesn’t make sense! Why does it feel like beer goes straight to my bladder?”
A man with a plan.
Claire had immediately taken to the role of a protective older sister though, uncaring that the kid she saw as a little brother in need was more powerful than anyone else in the universe. She’d also, in Dean’s humble opinion, been an awful influence on him, he mused with a fond smile.
“You know you’ll see him again,” Sam nodded with understanding. He was still mourning his brother but deep down he knew it would be okay. He knew they would meet again. He knew Dean was at peace. Not as the abstract concept most people talked about Heaven but he knew exactly where he was.
When Castiel woke up next to Dean’s unnaturally still body a gentle smile found its way onto his face. He kissed his cooling forehead and whispered, “I’ll be there soon, Dean. Wait for me.”
Hiya, Sammy.
hitting the ground in the process. “Cas, you didn’t just watch. You found the locket and you burned it. You made sure Sam and I didn’t get killed. Yeah, sure, we’re a bit roughed up, but we’re fine! We all survived and that’s what matters.”
“He said… Sammy, he said he loved me.” Dean looked up and Sam’s breath hitched. In all his 37 years he had never seen his strong big brother who never stayed down long after he’d been kicked to the ground, look this lost. “He said he loved me and had this whole speech ready and I couldn’t even say anything. I didn’t even understand what he was talking about at first and when the shoe dropped, it was too late. He killed- he
But, Sammy, I did. We did. When I look at you, Eileen at your side and little Maura growing up so beautiful and smart and kindhearted, I sometimes imagine the kid storming out of the motel room and yelling about wanting a normal life. Wanting out. Sam, you’ve done it. Well, normal might be a little exaggerated but happy? Now that, that you have accomplished. I can see that when you look at the little family you’ve built for yourself.
What Sam could believe however – and what he firmly did believe – was that all these things Dean wouldn’t have learned and figured out if it weren’t for the angel on his shoulder. Pardon him, the angel in his bed.
“Okay, dumbass. You listen to me right now. Up until like a week ago, I didn’t even know angels could feel that way. Even after you said it, I kept thinking, ‘Well, he probably meant it in a brotherly kinda way.’ I didn’t let myself think …” Dean paused. “Shit, Cas, this whole communicating thing isn’t easy for me.”
But right now, there was one task Dean couldn’t do alone.
And for the longest time, I was okay with that. Butch and Sundance. I was fine with it.
The anger rushing out of him as fast as it had come, Dean now just felt empty. He could kill monsters and demons and save people but when it came to the one person he needed to save, he couldn’t.
Dean blinked slowly, coming back to the world of the living and leaned back in his chair to stretch his arms above his head. “Research. Why’re you up so early? Even Sam’s not up for another hour for his run.” The word
Claire, Kaia and Alex were roping anyone passing by them into a round of poker with them which had led to several of the Apocalypse World refugees losing a ton of money to them because Dean knew for a fact Claire wasn’t playing fair…
Sam came over to where he’d just finished off his last vamp, wiping sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand and leaving behind a small trail of blood. “What happened to that one?”
Eileen turned back from her boyfriend and cleared her throat. “So I’ve seen the Lord of the Rings box set in your … what was it? The ‘Dean Cave?’”
did a very good job and I’m extremely proud of you.”
So he wrapped him in the fluffiest blanket he could find, got him some PB&J and cuddled him thoroughly while they watched some documentary about bees that Castiel followed with interest as Dean tried not to fall asleep. Miracle did his best from Castiel’s other side, having sensed the distress in the angel as well and wanting to help.
“Quite the turnout, huh?” Somehow Dean had ended up next to his brother without noticing. Looking up and seeing Sam with Eileen hanging off his arm, the heavy weight disappeared for a second. He was genuinely happy for Sam. Seeing the way he’d reacted when they got to Eileen’s house and found her phone and bag on the floor – Dean didn’t know how to get the heartbroken look off his brother’s face and that had terrified him. But now here they both were, smiling widely at him.
Dean took his face in his hands. “Cas, you gotta listen to me. We made it outta there today ‘cause you make a damn fine hunter. You don’t need your grace to help. You just do what you always do, trust your guts and do the right thing. It’s what you did today and it’s what got us outta there. Hell, Sammy and me got slammed around like nerds on the playground and you’re the one who figured out it was the locket and dusted the fucker.” He tilted Castiel’s head and pressed a kiss to his forehead. “Grace or no grace, Cas. You’re helping even if you don’t realize it.”
The hunt had been supposed to be a simple, routine salt and burn. They’d gotten quite a few of those lately, since demons roaming Earth had gotten a bit rare after Rowena had taken over Hell.
Rubbing a hand across his neck sheepishly, Dean let out a quiet sigh when the angel turned to him with an inquiring look. “Don’t even ask.”
The rest of the night had everyone not so subtly asking Jack about his plans for the world and Jack mostly just answering that he didn’t really know yet.
Castiel simply smiled as he raised a hand to cup Dean’s jaw, running his fingers over his cheekbones. “I’ve been alone since the dawn of time, Dean. I want to spend eternity with you.”
They sat together in comfortable silence for a while, content with just watching Ellen and Jo serve guests and strike up conversations with them before Mildred turned back to Dean with a warmhearted smile. “So tell me, Dean. That sunset we’ve talked about all those years ago. You ever get to see it?”
An astonished little
Dean swallowed around the lump in his throat and rubbed his hands across his face before he started, “I know you said at Sam and Eileen’s wedding that knowing we-“ The word still didn’t come easily to him but it felt more natural every time he said it, “love each other was enough for you and that you don’t need anything else. And I agree, like I told you. I don’t need to make it a big thing, especially ‘cause I’d probably shit myself saying all that romantic ass crap in front of all those people.” Dean knew he was rambling but Castiel just kept alternating to stare between the thin silver rings and up at his face with wonder. “So it’s not a wedding ring but I still wanted you to have something to remind you that we’re- That you’re mine. And that I’m yours.”
His face hurt. He’d been smiling the whole evening, talking to people as if everything was fine. Celebrating the epic win they just secured and sharing everyone’s happiness. Dean was happy of course. How could he not be? They were free now. Free of Chuck’s influence, free of having to fight for their lives. Well, until the next apocalypse of course.
Castiel barely had the time to chuckle at Dean’s eloquent phrasing before he was pulled into a hug. They clung to each other, hands fisted into tan fabric and flannel, as if their life depended on it. Dean dramatically mused that for him this might as well have been true.
Some had even died for them, not because they asked them to – they would never do that – but because they considered it worth it.
Dean had tuned out early on, only hearing scraps of what was being said. “Lucifer offered his help … Realized Michael was gonna turn sides … Let Chuck beat us up a bit … Killed them both … Jack absorbed his mojo … Now human … Didn’t kill him though … Now Jack’s God … But don’t worry, Dean bullied him into still coming over for dinner …”
The brothers caught Claire and Castiel up on what they’d missed out on – Claire listening with way too much interest in monster hunting for Castiel’s sanity, as always – before Dean mentioned the rebar thing to them.
And I’ve found that there was more to life than just sacrificing myself for the rest of humanity. That I could save people and not want to die.
As Dean’s brain stopped working and he could do nothing else but stand there with the biggest grin, he got pulled into another bear hug.
Castiel sat down on the foot of the bed and held his hand to the dog’s nose. “Hello, Miracle. You’re quite the beauty, aren’t you?”
Dean just stared at Jack with an open mouth. He’d not expected this at all. He didn’t even know it was possible, to be honest. Before he could stop looking like a fish, Jack put a hand on Dean’s shoulder and lightly shoved him towards the bar’s entrance.
Dean however ducked his head and crossed his arms sheepishly. “Shuddup, bitch.”
Thinking back to the nightmare, Castiel’s voice repeated in his mind,
“Hello, Dean.”
“In that case, I’m proud of
Sam pushed his hair out of his face and grimaced as it came back sticky with some more blood. “Maybe it’s a metaphor. Maybe the tongues mean they’ve felt silenced by someone or something. And the masks … Maybe those represent whatever was oppressing them. Y’know, faceless figures pulling strings in the background.”
Afterwards Dean would neither remember pulling out a chair and sitting down next to Castiel, nor accepting the cup of coffee Sam had to have given him but it must’ve happened at some point as the three of them were now sitting around the war room table as if none of them ever left.
The hunter took a big bite and threw his trash to the side only to grab it again and neatly place it inside the green cooler they had brought over from the car when Castiel raised an eyebrow at him warningly. Sam chuckled.
Across the table Sam and Eileen were bursting out into laughter. Dean once again felt left out and looked around from one to the next, confusion written on his face.
In the meantime Dean struggled against one of his vampires, ducking a punch and pushing him back. He sensed the other one behind him, spun around and used the momentum of it to take his head off. Looking over for a second, Dean noticed another headless body.
The older Winchester got up, leaving the bottle on the table, reaching over the table to grab Sam’s out of his hand and letting it join his own.
Satisfied with his sniffing, Miracle trotted over the bed a little to flop down in Castiel’s lap. “I think he likes you!” Dean proclaimed with laughter in his voice as he reached forward to pet his dog’s head.
For some reason Castiel saw a man in Dean who acted out of love. So out of love Dean would act.
No, they hadn’t even stepped foot into the bunker before like little kids they were pushing each other, elbows meeting ribs hard and arguing.
A hand grabbed for his. Castiel must have heard Dean struggle for breath.
“Not as good as you, apparently.” Dean looked pointedly at Mildred striving out the back smirking.
Jack was supposed to appear soon – knowing him, he’d probably teleport right into the kitchen to steal a piece of the pie Dean had baked yesterday. Sometimes Kaia and Eileen joined as well but both were busy today so in the end it was only the five of them plopping down in the living room.
If you’re reading this, I’m dead.
Chuck was defeated, all the people he had snapped out of existence were back and it was finally over.
He watched Sam’s amusement with a smile before he got serious again. “I know if I were a normal human I’d be devastated at the loss. I’d be beside myself with grieving. But I’m not. I know something most people don’t.”
His question was answered when after a second the speakers which had been programmed to play a playlist of only classic rock – as they should, in Dean’s humble opinion – began blaring
Castiel turned squinted eyes on him, slightly annoyed that he was interrupted not even two sentences into his story. “I did tell you my powers were fading but I suppose there was so much happening that I never really found the time to explain just how little grace was left.”
“Y’know, what I still don’t get is the masks and the cut out tongues. Like, what kinda self respecting vamp does that?” Dean mused as they hit the dark, empty highway. “Thought that sorta signature was meant for Dahmer or Bundy.”
He couldn’t believe it. Decades of pain, heartbreak, sorrow, grief, betrayal, torture, loneliness.
Despite his lack of background knowledge, the bride didn’t have a reason to complain. To make up for his inexperience, Castiel had forced Dean to watch any and all movies about weddings he could find, always accompanied by the hunter’s whining of course, and binge watched
“Tongues ripped out,” Sam finished. Huh. Eccentric vampires with a kooky MO. That was a new one, even for them.
Castiel’s blue eyes widened at the close contact as Dean lowered his head to press their foreheads together. “This okay?” he asked, his voice nothing more than a whisper that blew against Castiel’s chapped lips. There was only a tiny nod that Dean took as his cue to close his eyes and meet his lips in a soft, chaste kiss.
Waving his hand, the sound of wings resounded in the bunker and then Dean was alone again, left to his books. So he sat down and read.
The hunter obliged before he picked up the pile of socks he’d dropped upon his discovery.
After that the hunters relaxed. Most of them had met Jack at one point or another and apparently this was proof enough for them that while his abilities might have changed, inside he was still just the young kid who loved nougat. Besides, he’d been raised by three of their own.
Sam knew who he had to thank for Dean getting better and so he sent a tiny prayer over to Castiel who he knew wouldn’t hear this but well, it was about the principle. He’d just have to make sure to tell him in person later.
Of course it was a wasted effort; he was still human.
Ash just laughed as he moved around Jo and Ellen to make himself a drink.
see terrified him.
Something in Dean’s back made a grating cracking sound in symphony with his kneecaps as he pushed up off the floor to meet Sam in the hallway. He’d really gotten too old to spend the night on the floor, he thought with a scrunched up face.
With a disbelieving shake of his head Dean stepped into the angel’s space and waited silently for him to finally raise his head.
Castiel had obviously not expected Dean to be the one to breach the subject if the genuine surprise on his face meant anything. To his credit though he quickly recovered and his face smoothed out as he nodded and held out an arm as if to say
The man who acted out of love.
There was a tight embrace, there were tears, there were watery smiles.
Sam couldn’t believe his big brother who had hated himself with a passion for pretty much all of his life had finally found out that he was worthy of being loved and found comfort in the person he was.
Even after having been kissed, the angel’s mouth was still curled downwards in a doubtful manner. “Do you really mean that? I don’t … You’re not the only one with trust issues.”
Castiel looked at the floor now, shifting slightly from one socked foot to the other with a guilty look on his face. “Well, ‘want to’ might be a bit exaggerated…”
Sam and Eileen arrived in the Roadhouse together not long after. Dean understood what Jack had said about time moving differently now. It had only been a couple hours up here while apparently it’d been years on Earth. There was the typical Winchester Bro Hug that they usually reserved for when one of them came back from the dead. This time, Dean chuckled, it was the other way around. The both of them were quickly pulled into conversations, much like Dean and Castiel had earlier.
Unknown number.
Their first case appeared only a few days after Castiel came back from the Empty. A vampire nest by the looks of it, bodies drained of blood, though there were details about it that didn’t quite add up.
When Maura didn’t stop fussing around, Dean picked her back up and walked around the room in slow circles, bobbing her up and down on his arm. Castiel heard him murmur something and when he stepped closer, he realized he was humming. “
“Called him what?” Dean asked, his brows furrowed his confusion.
until he heard Sam hurrying down the metal staircase through the thin wood of his door, each step accompanied by a resounding
At the promise of food Dean jumped out of the bed and was at the door before Castiel could even finish rolling his eyes.
“What are you talking about? Dean, it’s me, it’s Cas. I’m back,” came Castiel’s confused voice, sounding tinny through the crappy speaker.
“Not like it ain’t true.”
“No, no, no. This can’t be happening. I can’t do this again. Please.” Dean didn’t realized he was begging until he heard the choked sob as his voice broke at the end of it.
The angel let himself be pulled into Dean’s side again, pouting and muttering something about that son of a bitch not belonging in Heaven all the while.
I told you I was content with our friendship as it was but you decided against that. You don’t get to take that back right now just because you’re a little scared. So am I, Dean.” Castiel stepped closer as Dean took a step back only to hit the hallway wall with his back. He gulped. He’d never liked being at the receiving end of the angel’s death stares. “I don’t care if I die – again – as long as I can have this. Have you. It has been too long and in Sam’s words this has gotten ‘freaking ridiculous’ We deserve happiness. You do and I do as well. So get your head out of your ass.”
Dean chuckled softly before he looked back at his angel who met his eyes for a second and waved awkwardly before turning back to sign something at Eileen.
Peeking at his angel to see if he was finding the scene as funny as he did, he realized Castiel hadn’t been paying attention. Assuming he’d be in for a lecture about the importance of filmmaking, the angel was surprised when Dean’s expression softened and only pressed a kiss to his nose, making it scrunch up.
“By the way, Jody made a pie for you guys that she had me bring. It’s in the kitchen if you want-“
So that’s how they’d found themselves sitting in the pews, inside a small church. Sunlight was streaming in through the stained glass windows high up on the walls, painting translucent squares of colors onto the floor. Tall vases of yellow, orange and red flowers flanked the aisles on either side, leading from the closed doors all the way to the altar that was decorated with the same flowers and matching ribbons.
Dean groaned. This whole pranking stuff had been easier before dating an angel who actually gave a shit about him treating his brother nicely.
When Claire had noticed Dean watching her, she’d looked up with a forlorn look on her face and had raised the bottle, exclaimed “To Castiel” in a bitter voice and knocked back some more of the drink. Dean hadn’t been able to argue with her.
He’d seen a lot of things, is his point.
“Oh, Dean. Of course.” The hunter looked up and took in the fond expression mixed with a sad little look in his eyes. Castiel stood up and sat down in the chair next to Dean’s bed while he settled onto his side, facing his angel.
The silence that hung between them as they sat next to each other, both avoiding eye contact, wasn’t exactly an awkward one but it certainly wasn’t comfortable either.
As the beer bottles accumulated on the table, Dean had become quieter and quieter. Looking over at his brother when there was a lull in the conversation he and Castiel had been having, Sam realized Dean had nodded off at some point, his head hanging between his shoulders in an awkward angle, eyes closed shut and mouth slightly open.
Raising his hand slowly, Castiel gently stroked the soft fur of the adorable animal. “The feeling is mutual. Very much so.”
“Finally got your head outta that ass, boy?” Dean didn’t have to turn his head to know that one was Bobby and simply raised his middle finger in his vague direction, never letting go of his angel.
Sam sat in the passenger’s seat, giving Dean an exasperated bitch face. “She’s got it, Dean. Will you please let us go now?”
Claire trailed after him lazily and raised a hand in greeting; she’d watched the dog while they were gone on a hunt. It was rare for them nowadays to hit the road and deal with the things that went bump in the night – there were enough young hunters to pass the torch to – but a demon had gone rogue and Rowena had called them to ask for – nay, demand – their assistance as she didn’t want to get her new pair of high heels dirty. So they’d gone, found the demon, got teased for their choice in spray paint and exorcised the demon for Rowena to deal with in Hell. The poor dude he’d possessed had been confused and traumatised by the three grown men pointing various weapons at him, but overall he’d be fine.
warmed his heart.
“Jack! I know you’re listening and I don’t care that you wanna be hands off! Get your feathered ass down here this instant or you ain’t gettin’ a Christmas card!” Dean yelled at the top of his lungs at the night sky, thousands of stars glittering above him. As he glanced around, nothing changed. Just a lonely hunter, standing there in the cold breeze, screaming at nothing but the dying grass to his feet.
The next day didn’t leave room for much introspective either given that Sam had apparently invited everyone over for the mandatory “Hey, we survived the apocalypse! … Again!” party without giving Dean a heads up, only telling him about it when he came back home with Eileen in the afternoon, which left Dean to speed walk through the grocery store, picking up food and booze for all their friends while cursing Sam under his breath. Returning to the bunker he had to scramble to get the burgers on the grill before anyone arrived.
“We need to talk.” Dean opened his mouth to speak but Castiel talked right over him. “We need to talk, but that can wait until tomorrow.”
To be perfectly honest, Castiel didn’t know what Dean was saying half the time. The high pitched voice humans adapted when talking to babies was not one of the very many languages he spoke. But it didn’t matter. Seeing the hunter sit on the floor, legs stretched out to either side and roll the bright blue plastic ball to Little Maura lying on the soft carpet two feet in front of him for her to catch it with the most excited of giggles and clumsily attempt to roll it back while he cheered her on was adorable.
He swiped at the screen and yelled “What?” in a voice hoarse from crying before the phone was even pushed to his ear.
Castiel rolled his eyes but smiled warmly. “’She’ is a bar, Dean. I don’t know if a bar can be beautiful. But we did a very good job fixing her up from the dusty pigsty it used to be.
Over his heavy breathing he almost didn’t hear the voice saying his name. He pulled away his hands only to quickly close his eyes against the harsh light flooding the room.
He shrugged it off and rambled on, fists clenched tight, fingernails digging into his palms, uncomfortable pressure where his knuckles had met the wall.
The hunter knew this wouldn’t be the last time he’d hear of these issues but he was prepared to convince his angel of his worth as a human every day if he had to. He’d catch Castiel every time he fell and make him believe what he saw in him.
Waking up he’d immediately figured Castiel returning was just another figment of his imagination. To see him sit there, forehead creased as he leaned over – it was like the rain after months of drought.
She shook her head a little and looked him up and down hungrily. And not the kind of hunger Dean liked to see. “No. I just called dibs.”
Sam rolled his eyes and started randomly thumbing through an encyclopaedia of all things heavenly. “I can see that. What I’m asking is what you’re looking for.”
“Dean?” Dean stopped. Yeah, he knew that wouldn’t work.
“Fuck, man. You’re still here.”
People who once had been their enemies but had unexpectedly become their allies, had become friends. Acquaintances who had casually crossed paths with them came to help when they’d asked – or even if they didn’t – and stayed at their sides.
Dean stumbled into the kitchen with a yawn rubbing his eyes, clad in a Zeppelin shirt that had seen better days, his dead guy robe and of course, the hot dog pants he was so fond of.
The younger man looked down at the head of hair in confusion before catching Castiel’s eyes over the metal railing. Castiel sighed deeply and raised his hands in an exasperated manner. “He found the ring box. Sorry.”
It was over.
Jack grinned at him and nodded. “I will, I promise.” He stepped back and raised his hand for his mandatory wave but something was nagging at Dean. He’d thought about it a lot last night so before he could talk himself out of it or Jack could disappear, Dean held up a hand.
Eyes were staring at him out of the distant line of trees, glowing red.
“Damnit, Cas. You told me I changed you but did it ever occur to you that you changed me, too? You pulled me outta Hell, sure. But after that you stuck around. I know I talk a big game of free will but honestly? You showed me what free will actually means. You showed me that there were things worth falling for, things that are worth turning your back to everything you know for.
For a long while after that, he’d sat alone at the table in the library, nursing a beer and staring at the names carved into the wood.
Dean talked to a spot of dirt on the floor so he didn’t see Castiel’s face darken. His head only snapped up when he heard the furious tone of the angel’s voice. “You listen to me right now, Dean. I know you have an immense amount of commitment issues-“ He didn’t pay any mind to Dean’s protesting
Dean stopped in his tracks as he realized where his feet had led him.
At present time the bunker was filled with people. They’d all come here after the funeral had finished, all eager to get into the warmth.
. He frowned. “Good morning. What are you doing?”
The same hellhounds that were glaring at him, closer now than just a moment before.
For a long time Dean had been sad, frustrated and angry that he hadn’t been allowed to have that.
Suddenly he remembered who he was.
“So, what are you, like the big boss or something?” Dean smirked at her.
Decades of not knowing what was going to come next, one monster worse and more terrifying than the next.
“We’ve done it, guys,” Dean announced, pushing his sunglasses back up his nose where they had slid down. “This is where we peak at life.”
“Dean.”
They let each other go but stayed close together, neither of them wanting to move too far away.
“Dude, come on, just go. I know you want to. Go get your happy end,” Dean smirked at him over his beer bottle.
She lowered herself into the seat next to him and stole his whiskey, throwing it back impressively fast. She smiled at him affectionately.
Alex and Patience had come as well, huddling together for warmth in the cold November air.
Dean had rambled on for a while, his nerves not letting him register that Castiel had been accepting the not very well hidden offer to move in with him – really move in together, into their own place – until he put his hand across the mouth and basically shouted, “Yes, Dean, I want to buy a house with you.”
Dean had tried to cheer him up, singing along badly to the radio, asking him where he wanted to stop for food but gotten nothing but one word answers in return.
A beat of silence. “You … cried? About me?”
It was difficult to make out what shadows were trees and what weren’t but what he
Sam smiled fondly at the picture of his best friend worrying over his big brother. “I know you will.”
They both stared into space for a while. Dean knew they were still tiptoeing around the main subject but he didn’t know how to start.
More shuffling and then Castiel’s face appeared around the half open door. “Yes?”
“D’you really think I was gonna fall for that?” Dean leaned in close to the masked creature with a smug smirk. “I went up against Hitler, Death and God. And I won each time. Piece of metal ain’t gonna do me in,” Dean bragged, shooting the vampire a wink and a grin before he swung his arm back and buried his machete in the wood of the post, watching the head fly off and land in the dirt with a dull thump while the rest of the body went limp as it hung on the rusty makeshift nail.
Weirded out, Dean looked over at his brother with an incredulous face. “Alright, Sigmund Freud. You’ve really thought about that, huh. ‘True crime’s not a freaky fetish’, my ass.”
All three men scarfing down pizza as though they haven’t eaten in days – which really was true only for one of them, the others just acted as if they were raised in a barn, as usual – Sam brought Castiel up to speed on what he’d missed since his spontaneous trip into the afterlife.
, he thought when he heard the familiar first notes of the Wedding March played. Dean had watched so many rom-coms by now that he was hearing the song play in his dreams.
. Who had somewhere along the way exchanged the porn mags for cookbooks and baking magazines. Who drank more coffee now than beer – still unhealthy, but hey, baby steps. Who got a freaking dog because for the first time in his life he wasn’t as terrified of losing his loved ones as he had been once – not because he didn’t care about them anymore but because he cared about all of them enough to leave his pessimistic ‘Everbody leaves’ mindset behind and who at last started to let the love into his heart, slowly but surely.
He was about to turn off the light and leave the room when he heard shuffling out in the hallway. Spinning around and getting into a fighting stance in front of the bed, Castiel pulled his angel blade out of his coat. He didn’t know what he was expecting to appear but it was certainly not the light haired creature that came running into the room and jumped up on the bed without as much as glancing at Castiel.
Around 6pm Castiel took the miniature Impala Dean and Maura were pushing around on the floor from their hands, causing both of them to let out whines that were eerily similar. “You have to go to bed now, sweetheart.”
Dean checked off his mental checklist as he circled around the bar room. The wooden floor was swept, the dark oak countertop had been wiped down, the shelves behind it were stocked with any kind of alcoholic beverages you could ask for – safe for the bottle of vodka Castiel had taken a liking to that had disappeared under mysterious circumstances – the mirror the shelves were mounted on was cleaned.
The hunter slumped into Eileen and let her hold him, a funny sight, considering she was basically half his size.
Jack stared at Dean with something in his eyes that from any other person Dean would have assumed it was pity. But he knew Jack too well to see anything but kindness and genuine sorrow.
Still disoriented, Dean let his head fall into his hands. So much for a peaceful sleep.
“Vamps Anonymous? Awesome.” He stabbed a finger at a page in the journal. “Aha! Got it! 1986, Dad was working a string of kidnappings along route 77.” He kept reading aloud for Sam to mark on the map. “Kids were taken, the adults that were drained had their-“
“But you watched me drink it, just yesterday and I was fine!”, Jack, sitting cross-legged in his chair and playing Angry Birds on his phone, pointed out without looking up from the screen.
He didn’t know how much time had passed, staring at the alarm clock sitting on his nightstand. The neon green numbers seared into his retinas until he could see their image every time he blinked.
“Jesus, Jack, warn a guy,” Dean grumbled before pulling the young God into a tight hug. “Don’t you think I haven’t noticed you dodgin’ family dinners the last couple months, buddy. Just ‘cause I’m dead doesn’t mean I can’t lecture you!”
“Dean, Sam and Eileen are back and they’ve brought food.” That last word always peaked his interest so Dean opened his eyes slowly and stretched his arms above his head. Well, one arm. The other was still attached to Castiel’s fingers. Who still sat in the uncomfortable chair, his unoccupied hand holding a phone. That’s probably how he knew there was dinner ready without leaving the room.
He tried to ignore it but it got louder and louder and didn’t stop so at last he lunged to the floor, ripped the drawer open and nearly out of its hinges and grabbed the phone he almost couldn’t see through his tears.
Dean tried to pull free from the arms holding him with a grunt but no dice. He figured he’d end up like Bella freaking Swan in a matter of minutes so he couldn’t quite keep the surprise from his face when instead a woman walked in.
Castiel gave the arm he was still holding a squeeze, unsure what to say to that.
“Hold on a second, Jack. I gotta say something real quick.”
No hunt gone wrong, no Gods pissed off.
The hunter sighed and continued to stare around the room. Miracle was sure having one hell of a time, flitting around people’s legs and collecting head scritches from everyone. Dean smiled at that. Who’d have thought they’d get a dog out of defeating Chuck?
The hunter pushed the balls of his hands into his eye sockets.
Letting it go and rubbing his eyes, Dean asked through a yawn, “What time is it anyway?”
Next to them, Claire and Kaia held hands, both with unreadable expressions on their faces. White knuckles however were jutting out of Claire’s fist, clearly hurting Kaia’s hand but she held on for dear life for her girlfriend.
So there Dean laid, wallowing in his usual self-hatred, his sorrows and regrets and waited.
Dean felt his eyes well up again. He rubbed at them angrily.
“You know, I have no idea how Dad ever even finished a single case,” Sam wondered on their way to the abandoned barn where the nest supposedly was. “Feels like we’ve always been the ones left to do his dirty work.”
Dean turned his unbelieving face to Castiel and tapped him on the chest with the back of his hand a few times. “We’re gonna be uncles!”
How he’d sacrifice himself for everyone, even and especially for people he’d never met before.
Sam wrapped an arm around his friend’s shoulders and tipped his beer towards Castiel who picked his own up from where it sat next to him on the Impala’s hood and clinked the glass bottle against Sam’s.
Getting through the bunker door turned out to be difficult. Not because of the mechanics of a door – they’d gotten pretty good at opening and closing those. It wasn’t much of a challenge after all, giant dumbass or not.
“Cas? What are you doin’ here? You were supposed to have years left!” Dean took his face in his hands but didn’t stop scowling.
That still left the Winchester’s group of friends who had taken Eileen in as soon as they’d met her.
“How would you have known, Cas?” The question came out muffled through his fingers. “How would you have known that you can’t have it?
“For fuck’s sake, you son of a bitch. I don’t care who you think you are, just stop this! Stop torturing me like this, damnit!” he shouted into the microphone, uncaring if Sam would come running in a minute.
Once the both of them finally caught on to Sam and Castiel’s annoyed faces – please, just let them watch one movie in peace, have mercy on them – Dean settled back into the warm, cozy spot next to his angel. Castiel stopped watching the battle happening on the screen before long to just stare up at the hunter through his lashes.
He was so deep into thoughts that he jumped a little when a warm hand settled on his shoulder. He looked up and promptly stood to embrace the woman standing next to the sofa he’d sat on. “Mildred! How ya doin’, beautiful?”
But seriously, Sam. We’ve been through so much pain and hurt and death and lost everyone and got some people back only to lose them again. We’ve been killed- I don’t even know how many times. But we’ve always come back. We’ve fought each other and lied to each other and parted ways so many times. But we’ve always found our way back.
He squeezed his eyes shut to no avail, Castiel’s face still hovering in front of him. Tears slipped down his cheeks now without him noticing, too caught up in trying to regain control.
“Thank you,” Castiel said after they were done throwing food boxes and containers away and placing dishes in the sink to be dealt with another time.
“Cas.”
At that, his angel pulled him into a deep kiss that only got interrupted by Maura waking up. Dean got up quickly to check on her and when he came back with two steaming mugs, he had a blanket tucked under his arm that he threw over them both as he snuggled up next to Castiel on the garden bench. Only because there was a cold breeze and they had to share body heat, of course.
Dean stood silently for a while, just breathing in and out like Sam had once tried to teach him and focused on the light pressure of the hand wrapped around his upper arm to calm himself down before continuing with something that had been on his mind for a while.
Once he reckoned there were only two steps left before he’d be shish kebab-ed Dean tensed his muscles, dug his heels into the dirt and swung them around abruptly, catching the vampire by surprise and using the momentum to slam him into the metal.
At the affirmative sound somewhere in front of him, Dean continued, “Just wanted to say I’m real happy you’re back. Dunno if I got that across earlier. Guess I was a bit shell shocked seeing you.” His eyes stopped cooperating and slipped shut. “Gotta say, though, I figured gettin’ you back’d be harder. Read through every damn book we have on angels, front to back, twice and still couldn’t find a way. Not even Jack could help me. Really thought …” His words were slurring together increasingly now as he hurried to get the rest of the sentence out before he was dead to the world. “Really thought I lost you for good this time. Wasn’t fun. Don’t do that again, yeah?”
Of course he had never planned to realize the day dream but one night he’d made the mistake of telling Castiel about it.
“Listen, I do agree with the whole lonesome wolf God kinda thing but you’re still…” Dean hesitated but then decided that screw this, the boy deserved to hear it. “You’re still our kid. And I know you’ve been closest with Cas and I know you and I didn’t get off on the best start and there’s a lot of issues I haven’t dealt with but those are on me. Those are mine to figure out and while I do that, you will always have a family here. With me and with Sam. Your room didn’t come with the condition that Cas was here. It’s your home as well. And you can always come back here after you’ve done your God business.”
He dropped his head again, staring unseeing into his lap.
Not realizing what he was doing, Dean jumped to his feet, towering over Castiel. “You what?!”
Dean didn’t bother to answer. His mind had just stopped completely and he was still waiting for it to reboot. All he could do was stare at the angel who smiled amused.
After that, Dean left the two to catch up, feeling a bit like intruding on a conversation as he knew they’d had struck up a friendship back when Kelly was pregnant. So once again he sat at the bar when the door behind the counter burst open.
“Hey, Cas,” he said, smiling at him and closing the door with his foot. “Lemme check over you quickly, make sure Casper back there didn’t get you too bad?”
burned the bacon! I was making pancakes. Which came out perfectly fine, by the way!” The last part she said to Sam and Dean with a proud smile.
He grabbed his wrist before it could make contact with his skin. In a matter of seconds his entire demeanor changed.
There were doubts in his mind, not about his love for Castiel, not even about Castiel’s love for him – curiously that wasn’t what he worried about.
Coming around the table, Sam pulled Castiel up off his chair and into another hug. With a gesture to Dean he quietly told him, “Get him into bed, will you? He hasn’t been sleeping much and the few times that he did … Well, if the yelling in the middle of the night meant anything, they were nightmares. And bad ones at that. Heard him all the way down the hallway in my room.” Sam let go and looked at his brother, eyebrows furrowed in concern. “He’s not doing great, Cas.”
Dean turned this way and that but no one was there.
Sam chuckled as he watched Dean lean forward on his knees, breathlessly gulping in air. “You good over there?”
Sam broke out in laughter across the table which Dean responded to with his middle finger. Then he turned to Castiel again. “I’m just giving you a taste of your own medicine. That’s what I’ve been feeling like for the last twelve years!”
Raising his beer bottle pointedly, Dean responded, “Well, takes years and years of practice but give it some time and beer will go down like water” while at the same time Sam shot him a doubtful look, “Barely felt it? Dude, you were full on wasted.”
It’s the end he never believed he would get but the one he had found himself longing for as the years had gone by.
Finally getting a hold of himself, Dean straightened up and sighed. He smiled up at his angel apologetically. “Yeah. Yeah, I’ll get my shit together. As you said, we –“ he hesitated a second, not used to say anything positive about himself but trying anyway because this included
Dean chuckled, shaking his head a little. “Yup, nothin’ gets people goin’ quite as much as a ‘Hey, we didn’t die! Again! Beer and burgers on us!’”
“Yes, where did you find that?” His angel stepped closer and took it from him to further inspect.
He chuckled.
“Hey, Cas.” Sam got a smile in return. “How’re you doing, man?” He sat down cautiously next to his friend, almost as if Dean would jump out of the bushes to yell at him to be careful and “
And if he didn’t return to his lonely bed and snoring dog that night, it was nobody’s business but their own.
Dean huffed. Oh, the irony in that.
Some of them they’d unfortunately never see again because they weren’t able to come to this place but it didn’t make them any less important.
It’s honestly the least he could do after the angel sacrificed himself for Dean. Again. How many times was that now? He couldn’t recall. What a fucked up thing that this kinda thought was normal in the Winchester household.
So that’s why the hunter ran after his angel to their room, making a quick detour to grab one of the many first aid kits they stored basically everywhere out of the bathroom.
Bracing himself for pain to shoot up his back on the heavy impact, Dean was shocked when it didn’t happen. Instead he fell into a never ending black hole, letting the sweet promise of nothingness swallow him as he finally lost consciousness, the last thing he saw the image of the evil contortion of the man he loved staring after him as he plummeted.
A thought crossed Sam’s mind then and he clapped a hand on his brother’s shoulder. “So, you gonna be my best man if she agrees on this whole thing, jerk?”
“What’re you doin’ with that hillbilly, Midred? You’re so out of his league.”
Sam didn’t know what to say. His jaw hung open in an incredulous expression but he kept quiet.
But Dean knew him too well after over a decade and could see the smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. And he was right, too as the smile made its way onto Castiel’s face when Dean broke out in laughter, proud of his extraordinarily funny joke.
His breaths coming out irregular and harsh, Dean had to lean onto the wall now to avoid falling over.
Okay, true, Dean had kissed many people in his life time and meant little by it. He deserved that. But he was full of determination to make Castiel see he was speaking the truth. Even if it took him a while. So he smiled patiently, his fingers still stroking the other man’s stubbly cheek. “Good things do happen, Castiel.”
Eventually, Maura fell asleep in her uncle’s arms and Dean laid her into her crib gently. As he straightened back up he noticed Castiel stare at him and blushed all over his face. “Shut up.”
Staring after Castiel, Dean couldn’t help but make sure one more time. “It’s … It’s really him, right? It’s Cas and he’s real and he’s here, yeah?”
“Okay,” he muttered, encouragement for Sam and himself. They could do this. Four vampires, two hunter. Easy as cake.
, yes, but it was just so much more.
“Uh, Dean?”
Considering they had been telling the story of how they defeated God more than a couple times, it probably shouldn’t have come as a surprise that at the sight of Jack stepping foot into the war room, everyone kind of just stopped moving. No one here had a great record at dealing with powerful beings after all.
Sam and Castiel sat on either side of him in their folding chairs, laughing at his antics.
“There’ll be peace when you are done.”
So how could he truly be happy?
Castiel’s eyes laid on Sam but his gaze felt like it went through him. It took him a long second to reply, “I’ll be there. We’ll send him off together.”
Now, he knew clothes could have a soothing effect on people. Maybe it wasn’t the clothing itself but the familiarity that came with garments you’ve worn a hundred times, remembering both good and bad things that happened while wearing them.
After several minutes of attention Miracle seemed to have been contented as he pushed up on his legs, gave Dean’s face a quick lick that he was too slow to dodge and jumped down to the floor to leave the room. Most likely in search of some snacks. He took after his dad in that regard.
He hadn’t worn the thing in ages, having found that there was a reason Sam and Dean had favoured jeans and plaid shirts over anything remotely dressy. Moving around in a stiff suit and a long coat had its disadvantages both while hunting monsters and living everyday life.
Sam focused his attention to the last one standing, getting punched once, punching him once before taking his head off as well.
“Whose side are you even on, Judas?”
The sight of his angel trembling, still not looking at him, broke something in Dean. He reached forward and pulled him against his chest,
“You looked peaceful and Sam told me you haven’t been sleeping well so I let you get some more rest.” Castiel shrugged his shoulders, as Dean grumbled into his three days of stubble.
Dean finally pulled himself free, sat on one of the bar stools to hide his shaky legs and smiled as a beer bottle was placed in front of him. “Yeah, well, I guess I found something to stay alive for.”
At that Dean bristled. “What do you mean? I don’t care. I like being alone. After the week we’ve had? I just wanna take a long, hot shower and fall straight into bed.” Dean tried to give Sam a nonchalant shrug but he knew he couldn’t convince his brother that he was fine.
Dean grinned at his retreating brother over the rim of his mug in a way that clearly implied,
. Because we worked hard for them. Nobody can take that away from us.”
“Huh?” Dean was distracted by the blood and motioned to his own forehead to signal to Sam that he should probably try wiping his face again. “Oh, he’s a coat rack now. Figured I’d do some home improvement while we’re here.”
Not even remotely surprising to anyone, it didn’t even take Claire and Jack a week before conspiring against Dean. And so one day he walked into his bar – that should’ve been locked, thanks Sam, for guarding the spare key with your life – and was greeted with the biggest gay pride flag known to mankind hanging from the back wall.
Now looking like he was about to protest, the angel interrupted him once again. “Dean, you’re exhausted. Even without my grace I can see that. You need to sleep.”
Man, he remembered feeling this way with Castiel and secretly being just the slightest bit glad when he couldn’t flit away all the time. Immediately after thinking this, Dean frowned at himself, feeling ashamed to even think this.
Raising his eyebrows at Eileen who just shrugged her shoulders and reached for more chicken, Sam grinned at Dean. “We were just wondering if y’all have been talking at all since this morning.” The emphasis on the word talking left no room for misunderstanding and had Dean ducking his head and Castiel pushing his food around on his plate.
Since the music had stopped, Dean’s sobs echoed through the silence of his room.
“Not like we got like eight people with healing powers on speed dial,” Dean added.
Now, Dean had long since forgiven them – both of them – for it but he also knew that he and Sam had deserved better. They deserved a loving family, people who cared about them and accepted them the way they were. Flaws, issues and all. Who helped them if they needed them, no questions asked.
Now, I know you’ll be sad. I know this’ll be hard for you. But you have a wonderful woman at your side who is gonna help you through this and you have a beautiful daughter who needs her dad and you’ll keep fighting, Sammy. You always keep fighting.
Letting the hand holding the alcohol drop down to his knees, Dean ran a hand over his face again, rubbing at his eyes with his thumb and index finger.
It really didn’t. End in blood, he meant. The people hiding out in the house somewhere in the near distance might have been his parents. They might have done what they called “the best they could” to raise him and his brother and be there for them. But it wasn’t enough.
Dean stayed silent for a second. He felt the same way of course and he’s told his angel before, in a quiet moment, just the two of them. But the hunter still had trouble saying it in front of other people so he only said, “Me too.” For now, that was enough.
“Cas, we’ve been through this whole not communicating thing before and honestly, it’s gettin’ old. Please just tell me what’s wrong so I can fix it?”
He faintly heard his brother yell his name and sat up groggily, rubbing the little sleep he’d gotten out of his eyes. Judging by the pounding of heavy footsteps coming in the direction of his room, Dean figured something had happened. He let his head fall back against the wall with a thump.
There was a proud little glint in Bobby’s eyes. “Someone wise, huh?”
The door flying open, Dean almost got squashed by his brother’s enormous body, just barely able to step back before crashing into him. “Alright, alright, slow down. What is it, Sasquatch?”
He jumped when a hand settled on the crook of his elbow. Dean’s gaze shot over to the chair next to the bed and felt himself slumping over with relief.
“There’s nothing to undermine, Dean. Nothing at all.”
Dean picked up his head and looked over at Bobby who was watching him. “What’re you smilin’ about, son?” he asked, his beard hiding the smile Dean could hear in the familiar gruff voice.
Slowly over the years however, their little family had grown. Somewhere along the way, without noticing, even while claiming that
Castiel looked at the brothers with a fond expression on his face. He hadn’t realized it in the Empty considering he was asleep for the first part and had spent the second trying to find a way out but he’d missed this. The arguments, the well meant bickering between family. He was glad to be back.
And I know this doesn’t take away all your worries but let me tell you something.
Looking to his left he noticed Castiel avoiding his gaze. Huh. Feeling left out of the conversation, his curiosity got the best of him.
Somewhere along the way Dean had forgotten that.
He couldn’t snap out of it until Castiel’s hand slid down to his elbow. Dean’s gaze wandered to Castiel’s face and took in the pained expression that quickly turned into an apologetic frown.
He deflated when Jack shook his head slowly and looked at his shoes as he answered. “When I absorbed Chuck’s power, I guess I also inherited the inability to control anything there. I’ve tried, it’s the first thing I did after bringing everyone back, believe me.” Jack wore a bitter expression as he wrung his hands in frustration. “I tried and tried but it doesn’t work. It’s like there’s this… This wall now that I can’t break through. I even got Amara to try but she can’t get to the Empty either.”
Dean threw his head back with laughter.
To be honest, he didn’t really know why he’d come out here. He could’ve done this just as well in his room but this seemed more fitting. Don’t tell Sam, but Dean did like chick flicks and the occasional dramatic moment and this felt like it ought to be one.
Dean gave up struggling. He let him.
The dark days of loneliness and self hatred were behind him. In front of him, shining as brightly as the laughter drowning out the music, there was only light and unknown eternity that for the first time instead of hanging heavily above him like Damocles’ sword, ready to fall and cut him to pieces, filled Dean with joyful anticipation as it made him excited for all that was to come.
Sometimes you just had to force people into their luck.
“Guys!” The exasperated shout made the two men turn to the doorway in which Sam had appeared, pinching the bridge of his nose with two fingers. “It’s a freakin’ smoothie! Dean, you saw me make it. It’s
Slightly pleased now, Jenny said, “Thanks.”
After all, Castiel did have a thing for wearing the shirts that Dean had worn so often that the fibers had gotten used to his body; that had been washed and dried countless times and had come out of the machines softer each time.
Dean almost looked offended by that. “Don’t you dare think like that! She loves you, you love her, it’ll be fine. She looks at you like you hung the moon! She’ll totally say Yes.”
“It’s really you, right? This time? It’s not fake?”
“I know, Cas. I know. But it’s been years. Decades, even. I’m sure you’ll get your chance to get a punch in, we’ll be here for a while, after all. But you just got here, so just … Calm down for a second.”
At last he looked up. Even after this whole speech, an entire monologue later, Castiel still didn’t look convinced. Looked like he didn’t want to let himself believe that he was hearing right. Dean understood, believe him, he did. But it didn’t help the frustration. He racked his brain desperately trying to come up with different phrasing to make the angel finally believe him, to no avail. Words were hard for him. The right words were almost impossible. He’d always been more of a show rather than tell guy.
Eileen had been excited to see Castiel again. Unprompted she had pulled him into a surprisingly strong hug considering her small size. Then again, she had been raised by a hunter and was capable of holding her own well, so what did he expect?
All of a sudden Dean knew where he was.
would convey exactly what the angel meant to him. It was
Tugging on his hair again, he felt himself become more agitated every second. Eyes darting around the room without taking anything in, he swallowed around the lump in his throat. Abruptly, he flung a hand out, balled into a fist, wincing slightly as his knuckles connected with the solid wall, hard. He stood there for a while, his hand throbbing as it rested where it landed.
In the first rows closest to the pyre however, familiar faces mourned Dean Winchester’s death.
. He vaguely gestured at the man next to him with his hand. “Like that! Just stop it!”
“Don’t pretend as if you care. Besides, we got Cas back, Chuck is gone, everyone who got Thanos-snapped is home safe. I say we celebrate a little.” He shrugged his shoulders.
Barging into the kitchen and seeing the scene unfolding, Dean yelled, “Cas! Don’t drink that! You don’t have any idea what’s in it!”
Dean stopped to take a breath and run his trembling fingers through his hair. The entire time Castiel had just been staring at him out of glassy blue eyes, red rimmed but never taking them off of him.
Dean grinned at two of his favourite creatures interacting. So he’s sappy, what about it?
Jack was a Winchester and if he made a big, stupid mistake, then so what? That was basically a family trait at this point.
The sand would be a bitch to get out of the various crevices of his body but that was a problem for Future Dean, he figured, as he leant over to rest his head on Castiel’s shoulder.
a kid because he’d been thrown into chaos and destruction and murder even quicker than Dean had been all those years ago.
And suddenly, his anxiety and all the thoughts returned and they just flew right out of the hunter’s mouth without filter. “We shouldn’t do this. Us, I mean. You and me. We can’t. In our line of work, this kinda thing always ends badly. Someone is gonna use this against us and one of us’ll get killed over it.”
He slowed his pace down when he got close to the bedroom like he was approaching a wounded animal, wary of scaring it.
And all the alternate universes we’ve gotten thrown in? I mean, hell, remember that time Balthazar zapped us into the TV set of Supernatural? The books and the conventions were bad enough but that? I still have nightmares about that. What was Cas’ name there? Misha? Dude, come on. Nobody’s called
At that, Claire spun around affronted and pointed an accusing finger at him. “
He stepped over to his desk to snatch up the scotch biding his time there. Still a third of the bottle left. Score.
A second later they were gone.
The next time he awoke it was much more gentle.
“Dude, you always get the first shower! It’s not fair!”
As his ears slowly stopped ringing from adrenaline, the sounds of quiet music filled them instead. Lifting his gaze, his eyes fell to his headphones that lay discarded by the foot of his bed, the cable tangled in his sheets. He must have torn them from his head when he’d woken up.
Dean’s voice broke on the lone syllable but he couldn’t care less when Castiel looked up from the table and gave him a small smile.
“Aw!” came the immediate reaction from the peanut gallery while Castiel dropped his head on Dean’s chest, feeling the hunter’s hand reach into the bowl and throw popcorn at all three annoying guests.
When his food was gone and only drudges of his coffee remained, Castiel finally asked, “What? Why are you staring at me like that?”
Castiel looked over at him contemplating. “All day everyone has asked me that.” He lifted his head to look at the dark sky again. “People expect me to cry. They come up to me and are so careful with their questions, so quiet with their voices. I get their reasoning, obviously. The love of my life is dead.” He’d said it with such a dry voice that Sam had to laugh. Castiel went from powerful angel to capable human. He’d basically had to learn the basics of survival again but he’d never truly changed from the socially awkward angel he’d met decades ago.
“You’re not fine, Dean. My calling you put you through pain that you do not deserve. And I am truly sorry for that.”
He didn’t know what a good father even looked like, what the expectations were and how he would make sure the kid would be safe, healthy and happy. And speaking of safe – there were things out there that would try and hurt them and he wasn’t even talking about creepy dudes in white vans who offered free candy. Sam knew the kinds of thing that were out there, he knew the things that went bump in the night. How could he ever possibly hope to keep a kid safe without-
“Maybe they wanna protect their identity? I don’t know, Dean.” Sam stood across from him and pondered distractedly over a map.
The fond eye roll made him smile even wider before he nuzzled his face into Castiel’s neck. Close to his ear, he relented. “I love you, too,” he whispered and felt Castiel’s cheeks move against his head as he smiled before he turned back to Ellen to answer the question Dean hadn’t even heard.
A few moments later his body just deflated. His shoulders folded in on themselves. He continued, quieter now. “And then saying that other crap?” He couldn’t bring himself to address Castiel’s declaration any more precisely, scared of opening up that can of worms.
Shortly after they’d found and bought the bar, Dean had cautiously brought up moving out of the bunker. “It’s just, you know, the bar is a bit too far away to constantly make the drive back and forth. Living closer would just be more convenient and look, there’s a house for sale just a couple blocks down, it’s even close to Sam and Eileen’s neighbourhood.”
“What are you-“ Sam started but was interrupted by Dean pulling him out of his seat by his arms.
“So why’re they wearing masks? They’re vampires. They bite people. With their teeth. Why do they make their own lives harder by covering their faces?” Dean asked standing over the Impala. They’d just talked to the local police at the crime scene who’d showed them a sketch of the skeleton masks the intruders had been wearing and both brothers had recognized it from a similar drawing in John Winchester’s old journal which Dean was now flipping through.
They found the two boys hiding out behind the Impala. Dean quickly threw their machetes into the trunk to not traumatise them any further while Sam ushered them into the backseat. Before Dean slid into the driver’s seat he made an anonymous call to the police about the bodies from one of the cheap burner phones before taking out the prepaid SIM card and breaking it in half.
Of course he didn’t get one.
Dean looked after her for a moment. She put on a brave face for the outside world but he knew she was hurting a lot over Castiel’s death. Earlier he’d caught her in the kitchen downing gulps of whiskey straight from the bottle she must’ve found lying around – it wasn’t like alcohol was hard to come by in the Winchesters’ household after all.
So he slipped out of his room, quietly to not wake his dog and padded over to Castiel’s room. Upon knocking he immediately cursed himself. The angel in fact wasn’t an angel anymore and actually needed sleep. And now he was robbing him of that, too.
Before he could figure out why this place looked so familiar Dean felt a hand on his right shoulder. Backing away and spinning around, he reached for the gun he always carried tucked into the waistband of his jeans but could only grabbed air.
Hunters and those who had retired from it; strangers who had heard about the death of the man who had become an urban legend amongst the new generation of hunters, someone they told stories about in dive bars and came to pay their respect to the man who had averted not just one apocalypse; friends and family of Dean.
The hunter gave himself a minute to catch his breath. He’d been running around the place all day to make sure everything was ready for the grand opening tomorrow. If it would be all that grand, he didn’t know. He knew Sam, Eileen and Baby Maura would come. Jody, Donna and the girls had also promised to make the trip even though Dean told them it wasn’t a big deal if they didn’t, he knew it was a long drive. The two sheriffs had shut him right up.
His route didn’t take him past the war room. He’d seen enough of Sammy’s worried little glances this week, thank you very much.
right now.
“You’re being ridiculous, Dean. It’s perfectly fine”, replied the angel who had just picked up the glass in front of him.
The only answer the hunter could give was an audible gulp as he met his angel’s eyes.
Some of them had a long time on Earth left before they’d join them.
The dry tone of his voice made the brothers laugh.
Looking around the bar room, the hunter could see many familiar faces. Some he’d come to associate with the Roadhouse, some were more surprising. How Missouri and Rufus ended up playing pool together, he could understand. Except for the fact that,
Dean must have dozed off at last, his body finally giving in to the need to pass out because he shot upright disoriented from his shallow slumber when the heavy bunker door slammed open against the wall behind it. He didn’t think much of it except
Now Dean wasn’t stupid. He knew he wasn’t the best role model as far as admitting that you’re hurt went. So naturally he’d come to the conclusion that Castiel must have gotten hurt, hadn’t wanted to appear weak and kept his injuries to himself while sulking in the car.
I’m proud of you, Sam. I’m proud of us. We’ve gotten forced into this so young, we’ve never had a real shot at living a normal life. Saving people, hunting things. That’s all there was.
“Dean?”
He made it in the end. Of course he did, if there’s one thing Dean Winchester was good at, it was burgers and he wanted everyone to know that.
. “We deserve happiness.”
Castiel left soon after, mumbling something about having to inform Charlie and her wife Stevie.
“I can’t just let him go, Sam. I can’t. Not after he…” he trailed off but now Sam’s interest was peaked. Dean hadn’t talked much about what actually went down that day, they were too busy finding a way to defeat Chuck and to be honest he also hadn’t been ready to talk feelings since he was reeling with sorrow after losing Eileen. And after that Dean had shut down any talk about emotions. Not that Sam was surprised.
Dean let his head fall back against his pillow and closed his eyes. He just wanted to escape this reality for a while. Or longer.
Castiel didn’t answer. They both knew they had to talk about the elephant in the room at some point but neither wanted to be the one to breach the topic. And besides, with Sam bursting in as usual at any moment, this probably wasn’t the best time anyway.
Upon noticing Sam’s unmoving figure, Eileen looked up into his face. Freeing her hands from him, she signed, “Is he okay?”
Dean stood in Sam’s bedroom, staring down at what he’d just dug out of the nightstand drawer when he heard footsteps coming down the hall.
Jody and Donna, both arm in arm, silent tears running down their faces stood a couple of feet away.
Finally bringing the scotch to his mouth, he decided to make it worth it and swallowed big gulps, ignoring the slight burn in his throat as it went down. In fact he appreciated it. Any pain gave him a distraction however short it may be.
Nothing changed except for the sun that had been burning high in the sky but was now setting, making way for a moon whose light was suppressed by a thick wall of clouds.
Castiel only shot him a knowing smile.
“Cas?”
He was surprised to find Castiel sitting on the hood of the Impala, looking up at the stars.
The oldest Winchester raised his bottle in salute.
Dean pulled away, his own cheeks wet before embracing Eileen the same way, only a little more gentle considering she was carrying what one day would become his niece or nephew. The thought struck Dean unexpectedly and he pulled away all of a sudden. He looked between Sam and Eileen and back again, his mouth working around the tears streaming down his face steadily before finally he choked out, “I’m gonna be an uncle?”
The silence settled over them again, both brothers sinking down into their own thoughts. Sam turned his head to look at his brother with a fond smile on his face.
He brought the bottle up again, muttering into the glass. “’When you’re truly happy.’ What, so this whole – Our little… Family didn’t make you happy? That what this is about?” Dean scoffed before drinking again. He knew it wasn’t what this was about at all but oh well it’s something he could get angry about and as everyone knew, Dean Winchester’s second most favourite healthy coping mechanism was anger.
Sam stepped inside after Castiel and shrugged off his jacket as he kicked the door shut. “I told you, Dean. It’s all they had left in stock. They didn’t have any red and I don’t think you’d have liked the pearlescent baby blue any better.”
Dean raised an eyebrow but took the bottle with a nod. “Isn’t it like 8 in the morning?”
The dress Eileen had said Yes to in the end was a stunning white number. It was cinched in at the waist and had beautiful lace detailing all around the top part before flaring out in a wide, flowy skirt that ended around her knees.
We weren’t even supposed to find happiness in this lifetime. I know I thought for a long time that I didn’t
“Well since you’re off the market I have to make do with what’s available.” Mildred winked at Ash who put a hand over his heart dramatically. “I’m wounded, Milly. Deadly wounded.”
Everyone settled down and turned to watch the door when the music started up. Dean made a face. He’d suggested REO Speedwagon’s
It was finally over.
swims by!”
“Honestly not that much at all. The Empty is weak but it still had something of a wall up that blocked out a lot. Mostly it was just … feelings that I could sense. Anger, sadness … Grief, I suppose. And defeat. Frankly that was what made me hurry up and try to find a way out. I’ve experienced you in a lot of ways, Dean. But I’ve always hated to see you hopeless.”
“I called dibs on the first shower in the car! Wasn’t my fault you weren’t awake to hear me.”
“Got Mexican, figured you wouldn’t like the poke bowls I was eyeing.”
It was quiet inside the car for a long time after that. Only the rumble of the engine and the soft music playing lowly on the radio broke the silence. Dean figured Sam had fallen asleep against the window so he was broken out of his own day dreams when his brother cleared his throat.
“After what, Dean? What happened?” He didn’t really expect an answer. Acknowledging what he felt had never been Dean’s strong suit. He’d always preferred letting his frustration out by punching something. Or someone.
himself, gave himself up to the Empty for- for me, Sammy.” Dean’s voice broke and he closed his eyes to stop the tears from falling.
Dean walked backwards towards the hallway, gesturing vaguely with his bottle and making an exaggerated grimace that’s supposed to mimic Sam’s. “Whatever, bitch. I’m gonna get another beer. I know I throw a party any time
The older Winchester was eventually pushed off his vamp and stumbled back a little. Having lost his balance, it was easy for his opponent to grab him by the shirt collar and run him backwards.
of this works! You didn’t even give me a chance to say goodbye, let alone say…”
Kelly lowered herself into the seat across from Dean and Castiel. She smiled warmly at them and put each of her hands over one of theirs where they rested on the table. “I need to thank you. The minute I arrived here, Jack welcomed me and I couldn’t believe what a beautiful person he has grown to be. From what he’s told me, that’s all thanks to you two and your brother.” Tears leaked out of her eyes and she didn’t bother to hide them. “You were there for him when I couldn’t and you did a wonderful job. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart.”
He didn’t remember much aside from that but the pain he had been subjected to would never leave his memory.
Sam didn’t recognize too many of them – it had been a long time and most of them he’d only met once before – but a lot of the guests were people he and Dean had saved over the years. Most hadn’t kept in contact but somehow the news of Dean Winchester’s death – for real, this time – had travelled far and fast. Sam recognized Cesar Cuevas, wondering briefly what had happened to his husband, Jesse, and the Barnes twins, Alicia and Max. An unfamiliar man stood close to Max, a hand on the small of his back.
Even Charlie and Stevie had confirmed their invitations even though they’d just come back jetlagged from their honeymoon in London yesterday.
Dean had the decency to at least look a bit sheepish at that for a second, looking down at the offending piece of clothing. “Well, I… I mean, now that you mention it…”
“You did eat like seven slices,” Sam pointed out.
And Dean could do it for hours on end, too. It seemed he couldn’t get enough from his niece. Sam and Eileen of course took full advantage of the fact, giving them a call anytime they were due for some alone time. Dean didn’t mind. In fact, the one time Sam had dared to try and hire an actual babysitter for money, the hunter had shown up red faced and thrown the poor teenage girl out of the house. Castiel had quickly gone after her to pay her the full amount for her – now unneeded – services. And then some for compensation.
“Yeah you’d know all about looking at someone like they hung the moon, don’t you?” Sam smirked down at Castiel who smiled back proudly.
Their daughter looked over at them and gave them both a sad little smile they both returned.
“Hello, Dean.”
now. You’ve done so good and you’re still doing good and that’s all that matters.”
Dean closed his eyes to hide the tears and held his uncle for a minute.
They’d invited Adam over as well but he’d declined. He was still struggling to adjust to life without Michael riding shotgun and had said he’d need some time for himself. Sam made him promise to call them if he needed anything at all. Seemed like Dean wasn’t the only one missing an angel.
As the first hellhound reached him, nothing to see except for a shadowy figure and those damn red eyes, Dean felt the hand around his shoulder again and got pulled back by it abruptly.
The hunter turned away from him to rub at his eyes. He was
The dim lamps hanging above the bar counter, the few tables lining the opposite wall and the pool table in the small adjacent room were all filled with functioning light bulbs.
“Sam and Cas will be along soon enough. Time here … It moves differently. But you should head inside now. I think there’s some people waiting for you.”
Nodding off into a state of half-awake, half-asleep, Dean didn’t know how much time passed as he stayed on the cold hard floor. Night must have gone and passed the torch to morning, he figured, as Sam’s loud, annoying alarm filled the room on the other side of the hallway, a noise that Dean usually gave him shit for.
He flinched hard when his phone rang, loud and high pitched. He ignored it. Whatever it was, it could wait until morning. Dean really wasn’t in the mood to talk to anyone, whether it was a friend or someone who needed him to pretend he was FBI.
– all 300+ episodes of it – in record time.
Glaring at him, Castiel raised his voice. “He neglected and abused you your entire childhood, Dean! You and Sam!” He emphasized that last bit, knowing Dean would be more inclined to listen to him if he brought Sam up but the hunter swallowed his own anger for once.
Not surprised at all at the constipated expressions, Sam chuckled. “I’ll take that as a No.” Then he dodged the napkin his brother threw at his head.
That’s how Eileen knew she’d picked the right person for the job.
It wasn’t as if the Men of Letters hideout would stay empty forever, either. The network Sam had started had an extra category now. Safespots. The bunker now functioned as a place for hunters to stop for the night – or longer, if they needed – gather information and data and just somewhere to rest for a minute.
Castiel didn’t look up from where he was sitting on the bed, one of Dean’s favourite books on his lap. “I’m fine, Dean.”
Out of his seat and around the table before he knew he was moving, Dean vigorously pulled his little brother up and into a big hug. They didn’t say anything. They were Winchesters, no words were needed in an emotional situation like this.
Sam just shook his head slowly and finally forced himself to relax again after Dean had finished his food and no alarm clock began shouting ‘80s rock at him. “Nothing. Just … freaky déjà vu.”
“You what?” Dean pointed an accusatory finger at his angel. “You said you haven’t seen them when I was looking for ‘em! You lied!”
As his lungs started to burn, Dean realized he hadn’t taken a breath since he stopped moving and gasped, his eyes flying open.
