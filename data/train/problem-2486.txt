Sam isn't quite sure if half angel babies can get sick but he's not entirely sure he wants to find out. Of course it's too late now...
Some of the tension seems to leech out of Gabriel. "Thanks." He takes a small taste of the stew, then eats a bigger spoonful.
The sadness, regret, and heartache that pour off of Dean when he speaks of his father or his mother... Castiel wishes he could ease them. But he can't. He can't wish that John and Mary Winchester didn't meet the fates they did. He wouldn't have Dean then. Or Elle. Castiel is selfish, so very selfish. He knows so many sins (Pride, Lust, Greed, Despair, Wrath) first hand now and cannot regret a one. Castiel slides a hand up Dean's back to the bare skin on his neck, and rests his fingers there. "Did he come with that strange name?"
Anna nods. "We talked to Barachiel and Remiel before I came in, and Castiel will speak with Dean. Gabriel probably would have wanted to talk to you but..." she glances out the front window towards Gabriel. "Just give him some time alone. He's... maybe if you two were... he'll come in when he's ready."
“It makes sense,” Gabriel says as Sam finishes up dinner and Gabriel gingerly unwraps a red velvet cupcake.
She spins a bit before falling in a heap at Gabriel's feet and pointing at him from the ground, "You sir, are a spoilsport!"
"Also, 'Butterfly'?" Remiel asks as a rapier hums into existence in his hand. "I don't think I like that."
"What's wrong with her?" Robert's body language shifts as protectively as he is around the two Winchesters.
There's a gasp that could be words from Gabriel and he presses chest to chest so he can kiss Sam, wreck his mouth even more. Sam's hands drag up over Gabriel's back across the spot he know will get a reaction. Gabriel thrusts against him, fingers digging into Sam's hips. He's going to have bruises in the morning and Sam doesn't care. Sam
He’s shouting for Michael before he even registers that he’s doing so. Rushing from the doorway and across the porch. Castiel’s head snaps up when he gets too close and there’s a moment of fear in his eyes before it turns to confusion as Michael appears in the doorway with a gasp.
Dean watches as Bobby bundles Emily into his truck. He’s taking her home, which, shit, might not even be there for long if they mess this up. Remiel and Barachiel are standing in the driveway together watching the tail lights disappear off the road before they both shimmer out of existence. They’re going to get all the human hunters, teleport them when Michael gives the signal. Anna and Crowley have gone to round up all of the angels and demons they talked to this morning.
"Now it came about, when men began to multiply on the face of the land, and daughters were born to them..." Amon's voice echoed in the smoke, and Remiel spun, striking at nothing. "...the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves..."
But then come the times where Dean looks up and Cas has quietly gravitated to the edge of his desk. He always has a question about organization or keeping things, like Dean will get upset if he throws some of that shit out.  Dean always tells him to do what he thinks is best. Mostly because that’s what Dean always wants to hear when he’s given a project.
The pain slides out of Dean, more aches and pains than he was aware of easing under the archangel’s touch. There’s a part of him that wants to tell him off, that wants to tell him to get his goddamned hands off him. But that part is small, so small in the face of how badly he wants his mate and his little girl back.
Crowley awakens to darkness. Darkness doesn't bother him, not normally. There's a warm weight against his chest, and the scent of Anna fills his senses. For a moment, he thinks they're in one of his bunkers, safe, and hidden behind layers of wards.
Dean doesn't say anything; his gaze is fixed on the floor and his shoulders set in a tense line. Dean looks -- shattered, wounded. Like a man that had prepared his home for a flood only to be taken unawares by a fire. "Cas,
be able to do that. He can't remember having a favorite toy. He can't remember Dean playing with toys. Then he blinks again. "Wait, Michael gave Cas the lion?"
Then Cas speaks low and hushed, “This is a very hypocritical situation to be in for someone as adverse to cuddling as you claim to be.”
Oh, oh fuck. Dean thinks about it now. They wouldn’t even have to hurt her for Sam to... Just the thought of it turns his stomach. Slowly Dean nods.
"A kid?" Robert has gone pale and looks like he wants to punch something, Barachiel hopes it isn't him. Castiel is frowning at him and Dean looks a bit shocked and disgusted. Elle reaches over and pats Castiel's face.
"Excuse me?" His voice is way too high and somewhere between panic and pissed off because he's stuck in between a really strange sickening mix of the two and can't get out.
He finds her a few miles off in a barn that's thrumming with poor quality techno and full of kids who are too busy getting drunk or high to notice him. Prudence is an easy find with pink hair and an orange sarong, barefoot and curled up in the hayloft with a teenage couple that probably isn’t going to be prepared for the consequences of this night.
Jo shows up that night carrying bags and complaining about the interstate and her mother and Walmart. Dean looks at her from his desk, over his glasses, until he’s sure she’s done.
"I will not allow her to be needlessly hurt. This is all the promise I can give." He places a kiss of blessing on Mendel's forward. "Now go."
The entire house watches him drain the bottle in one go. Huh, guess Sam was right, angels really don't have to breathe.
Hunter’s had been showing up here and there. Usually with gifts, generally consisting of something someone would get at a gas station. Most were just there to laugh at the idea of Dean Winchester, resident badass, with a baby. Others were quieter, more reverent. Dean usually shooed them off as soon as he could.
know anything. Which is such a pity for you, really," the angel is turning his head this way and that, detached and curious.
Sam pulls his mouth away from Gabriel's and drags in air, trying to pull his mind back together. A difficult feat with the way Gabriel's moving under him.
Gabriel raises his eyebrow, then pins Dean with a hard look. Dean swallows, and wraps his good hand around Cas' wrist. "We need to finish talking," he declares. "Don't let us starve you, Sammy, and I expect you to keep a eye on him," Dean says pointing at Gabriel.
He hopes it's just a tooth, with the way she keeps putting the gold lion in her mouth. Dean's not sure he can deal with anything else today, and today has just barely started. They're so damn lucky she didn't shift. She came close but she didn't shift. Not that it probably matters, the demons know where to find them, and he can't... he can't think about that right now.
"Dude, breathe," Sam says, without thinking, because he's out of breath just listening to the guy. Then it dawns on him, he just told an angel -- wait an
Remiel rolls to the side as the pink box gets flung at him. It misses and strikes the fence post. He has about a moment to reach in between and retrieve his weapon before he realizes that the box is emitting smoke, something thick, choking making it almost impossible to see normally and magically. Okay, perhaps this was going to be marginally trickier than he thought. The smoke was just a feint at best, concealment, he narrowed his senses as Amon giggled. Something high and feminine and wrong.
“I’m not sure where her interest in clothing stems from…” Castiel straightens as he attempts to reclaim his tie.
“You’re going to stop me? You’re practically powerless now and your humans are as well. The thing must die. It is our Father’s will,” Zachariah declares loudly, lifting his hands, a mockery of a preacher giving a sermon.
He’s standing in the kitchen waiting for coffee because coffee makes everything better. Even though he’s pretty sure it can’t cure the feeling of his sinuses wanting to burst out of his face like a baby alien.
The peace lasts for all of ten seconds before Barachiel is flopping down on the porch next to him, grinning like a fool. "Hello, hello."
"I'll go give Dean the heads up you're here," Sam says and Gabriel hears him retreat into the house.
He hears gunshots over the phone and closes his eyes as Abe tugs half the shit off his desk. Finally, after a way too long silence he hears Rufus. “That did it! Way to not drop the ball Winchester.”
She lets the demons come at her, one eye on Jhudiel in case he decides to go for Crowley again. But he doesn't, he watches her toss demons aside like rag dolls, breaking limbs and sending blades skittering across the floor. He's judging her, seeing how much of her power has returned. It isn't going to be enough, not with the smile that spreads on his face like oil, like he knows and has known all her weaknesses from the start. Perhaps she could... She just had to get Crowley out of here. She just had to get him somewhere safe and...
But Sam knows all about throwing yourself into familiar things when you can't deal with something. He does raise his eyebrow at Bobby who doesn't even favor him with a look. So he looks back at Emily. "Mind if I heat up the pot of stew on the stove?"
He wants to laugh because this is... It isn't real. The house is gonna come down around them and he doesn't know where Sam is. He doesn't know what they'll do to Elle, he doesn't want to think about it... At least Cas got out. At least.
Somehow during all his protesting Cas had walked him into the bedroom and before Dean can really start complaining Cas has pulled off his shoes and flipped the covers over him. He waits until the angel leaves because if he really thinks that’s gonna be all it takes to keep him in bed...
Gabriel is sitting on the kitchen counter, which has earned him several glares from Robert. Elle is eating bits of pancake Dean had cut-up for her, while Castiel had dealt with one of Elle's shifts out on the porch. He really needed to remember to speak with Robert about some way to help her control them. Dean happily seems to approve of the pancakes and Gabriel has risen slightly in Dean estimation. He wonders if he should let his brother know that if he really wishes Dean to trust him by way of food that pie would be a more likely substance. Castiel, though, is sure this is more because Gabriel wished to eat pancakes, with chocolate chips in them no less, than for any other reason.
“I don’t think Luc got a chance to make connections like that either,” Sam sighs but looks up as Gabriel stands.
"You explained! You explained all day without actually saying anything! We are not going to talk about..."
Sam climbs into the van, ducking slightly due to his height. The floor of the van is padded with blankets, but Sam would almost swear there were soft mats under them. There are pillows lined around the walls of the van. "Here," he passes over the bowl and the beer, brushing his fingers against Gabriel's wrist as he does so.
Though he's unsure, Castiel loves Dean too much not to nod. Dean shifts against him, bringing their mouths together for a chaste kiss.
Barachiel rests a hand on Gabriel's shoulder, and Gabriel is quietly grateful for his brother. He had
"Sam," Gabriel sighs his name and opens his eyes, hazel meeting green. "Sam, just fucking be a bother, alright?"
"Complete, I can head out at any time. With Zachariah still out of commission things are in a bit of disarray. It should be no problem," Barachiel assures him in their own tongue.
Sam lumbers up the stairs and Dean obediently follows Bobby, pain, exhaustion, and relief at them all being safe for a few hours catching up with him. Castiel is only a step behind Dean, as if he's worried to let Dean out of his sight.
"He called me a moron a few times when I went to check on him, then said the accommodations were horrible and he wouldn't be recommending Hotel Winchester to his friends," Sam tells her.
"Haven't you heard? He's gone. Missing since last night. No contact. No orders..." Amon swings the pink box back and forth.
Gabriel grabs a kitchen towel, tossing it to the other angel. "Horseman's blade. Don't touch it, but it's gotta come out
Lucifer opens his eyes when he hears the rustling of wings. The sun is barely rising over the steeple of the church's whose roof he's perched on. The city below him is silent, everyone slumbers on ignorant of the danger in their midst, they are blind, they are naive, they are content, and for that he hates them. There's a man standing in front of the steeple before him, at least he appears to be a man. He's smartly dressed in a gray pinstriped suit, covered with an immaculate black wool coat. He's young and handsome, androgynous, with pale gray eyes and dark wavy hair. He looks the perfect picture of a young wealthy socialite.
Had his Father, wherever he was, wanted this? All Gabriel can recall is the storm pushing Castiel into his arms.
Sam swallows, his eyes drifting to the Archangel where he's settled in a sprawl, like a puppet with its strings cut. There's a long tear in his sleeve from elbow to wrist, and the collar of his coat is tattered, fraying against the back of his neck, and the fabric looks singed. Sam doesn't want to ask, well, he really
Gabriel unfolds himself from the floor, rising to his feet. Sam's eyes shift from the large tome in his lap up to Gabriel, and Gabriel would like to flatter himself that it's because Sam doesn't want him moving then curiosity.
For one moment, suspended in time, Gabriel is shocked. His eyes wide and surprised, before he dissolves into laughter. "Oh, I like you." He laughs, leaving the kitchen, stopping to pat Bobby on the shoulder twice. "I like you a lot."
"Yeah, I heard how distracted..." Gabriel mutters, his eyes keep straying to Sam's hand, where it's still wrapped around the hilt of the blade he gave him. Sam's about to lift it, to offer it back when Gabriel rolls his shoulder and turns. "I need a walk."
Slowly, he unwraps the chocolate from the paper. When he turns the paper over he see's words written in black ink.
The knife flips again in the air before it's caught and dragged in a fine burning line down the side of his face, dipping down to his throat. He's done, he has nothing more to offer and the angel knows this. The angel was waiting for this. He holds the image of Anna in his head as clear as he can imagine, her bright eyes and that ripple of red hair, like spilled blood on the pillow case. He imagines her frowning, smiling, laughing, the faces she makes in the throes of ecstasy. He hears her calling his name, just talking about houses and music and normal things. How she'd pull his papers or book or cell phone out of his hands and demand his attention. Her fingers brushing over his collarbone, tracing the mark she burned onto him. The last thing she said to him was "Be careful".
The storm resolves itself into the barest form of a person, the giggling shape, no; angel, in what would be its arms.
Sam opens his mouth, and all Dean sees is red. His fist swings before he fully thinks it through. The blow connects with Sam's stomach sending him stumbling back a few steps. Dean expects Sam to swing back, to get pissed. They've done this before. They've never been afraid to trade blows in anger.
“You know you can just go buy coffee, right?” He frowns as he eases into his desk chair and digs around for his glasses.
"She doesn't seem unduly affect by today's events," Cas says softly, bending his head to kiss Elle's temple.
Dean thumbs the phone in a rush because that’s not good. Usually Sam will leave a whiny voicemail and go on with his life. But Dean doesn’t get any words out before Sam’s voice and a shit ton of static greet him with, “De-! Angels! Co- Right now! I-”
There's long silence. "No. Some might not wish to aid Zachariah but they won't move against him. They believe he speaks the will of our Father. Sheep, all of them. Can't stand to think for themselves anymore. Forgot they knew how," she closes her eyes for a moment. "It didn't used to be like this Sam. We were all happy, for the most part."
The kid spins around gaping at him. Gabriel snaps his fingers before the boy - now a girl - starts to scream. Alex is moving his mouth but no sound is coming out. Perfect.
“He doesn’t talk. He just stares at me or Abe and crawls into my bed. It’s getting kind of creepy, I figured he’d ease up by now.” Dean is trying to not fidget.
He starts laughing when Cas says ‘shit’. It turns sort of hysterical after awhile but the angel just holds him and lets him gasp tears into his feathers until he’s wrung out.
Castiel can barely keep track of Dean in the chaos. He knows that Robert has fallen back to the kitchen, he can still hear guns firing and the familiar growling curses. He can barely sense Sam upstairs, still alive along with Gabriel and the other outside. The vessels his brothers inhabit are easy to destroy but their sheer numbers are tearing the house apart at its foundations. Castiel tries to not calculate how long they can hold against them. He tries to have faith. Another group goes down with Dean in the center of them. All Castiel can hear are the sounds of feet and the bright whooshing thrum when they destroy yet another of his brothers.
Bobby shrugs, though he's giving Dean a look that suggests a talking to is in his future. Great. "Just in case," he explains. "Now, Sam you get some rest before you fall over, and one of us has to haul you upstairs. Dean, into the kitchen, and lets have a look at that hand."
Dean nods. "Yeah, okay." He sits down on his bed, watching Sam grab his stuff and head into the bathroom. The baby seems content against his chest, and Dean lies down so they're both more comfortable.
“It was a trap,” Castiel breathes. “They knew we’d come. The place, a fort or a bunker, it’s shielded. We couldn’t get to them. We couldn’t get past the barrier. There’s an army. Angels and demons, and we couldn’t get to them.”
He doesn’t hear the front door open but he feels the warmth behind him before a hand comes and rests on the back of his neck. He knows from the light questioning press of grace that it’s Cas.
"That is so... not... the same... thing," Barachiel frowns fiercely into his jar as Remiel leans back in his chair and unhooks a pocket watch from his vest and silently hands it to Elle.
Remiel whines and pushes against him without doing much. He's starting to tire out at least, maybe if Barachiel just sat on him... But now Remiel is a mess and he's just begging, saying please over and over while Robert is looking at Barach like he needs to fix this
"Est dilectus meus," Dean whispers back, fumbling the pronunciation but meaning every word. It's a chick flick moment but Dean doesn't care. He doesn't fucking care.
"You don't know anything about this? About Lucifer?" Gabriel demands. "How could you miss the mess he's been making!?"
He shoves Remiel up, cups his face and whispers to him; soft words of comfort, nonsense, until he calms.
After a moment Barachiel shushes Remiel, smoothing his hair back before he looks up at the gathered household and frowns.
“Evil Abe,” Dean smiles back because really, those notes weren’t organized at all. “Making me clean my desk. Just for that I’m putting a halo on you and taking pictures.”
"Not all demigod's are like the ones you have faced. Some are like the one that gave her to us. They will not turn away a mortal seeking to protect his child, especially a female child. I..." Cas voice breaks slightly. "I do not wish to speak of this now. Let it keep until later. Please."
"No," Dean whispers, his face gone pale. He pushes away from the wall, moving forward into Castiel's space. The fingers of his good hand curl around the edge of Castiel coat and jerks at the fabric. "You can't take her."
Robert is outside checking the wards and grilling Castiel's brothers on how they'd tightened them up before he turns in for the night. And Castiel would be lying if he didn't admit that the idea of the two Archangels being ordered around by Robert is amusing. Sam is pouring over several old books so that as Sam puts it Robert's home will not be redecorated in chrome. Elle hasn't shifted since morning, but if her shifts allowed Barachiel and by that logic Zachariah to find them...
Which gets Dean out of bed in an instant and once he turns the light on he can see Abdiel curled around Pig with tears streaming down his face. Sleepy blue eyes open when Dean runs his hand over his head.
He trusts Gabriel, he does, but Sam still slips his fingers between them. He runs a fingertip over Gabriel's entrance and finds him slick and open. Biting back a moan, Sam can't help but press inside, just a little.
Sam is breathless when the archangel finally breaks the kiss, muttering, "So pissed..." against Sam's lips before he and Anna are headed to the door.
"Right, the wheelchair." Gabriel says in English and turns to lean against the counter as Bobby looks up, his expression unreadable. "So, are you getting healed too old man? I'm not working miracles all day, you know."
Sam probably makes a bitch face but Dean is too busy watching Cas, watching his body language. Which is kind of like watching the body language of a statue, but he's had his hands all over that body, he knows Cas. His angel had gone all silent fury when Sam had come in and told them Gabriel had let an angel in -- an
"He hasn't stated any intentions? Or maybe left you gifts? Like in common gathering areas?" Anna asks, ticking off some imaginary checklist in her head.
"Raphael's had me watching an angel and a demon prance around in a bloody bookshop for the last soddin’ century! I've not had any new orders in decades, mate!"
He waits a beat, thinking that Gabriel will insist. He knows he's right too, it would be for the best but...
Sam fiddles with the blade across his lap, wondering how his hands seemed to fit into the curve of the hilt perfectly. "So is Gabriel a good thing?"
"All I'm saying is that if you wish to continue to discuss the incident at the gate without coming off as somewhat of a hypocrite..." Remiel trails off as Elle waves her lion at him and burbles something in angelic.
"Well? Did you find their little haven?" Jhudiel asks, making it sound like he's asking about a whorehouse he wishes to burn down.
It means nothing, it can't mean anything, but his words falter for a moment and Sam looks concerned where he leans next to Gabriel. It takes less than a moment for Gabriel to recover, continuing his story of how Anansi asked the raven to take her thread and fly it high into above the earth so she could climb up into the sky. Sam is warm against Gabriel's side and he wants to draw the story out as long as possible.
"Thank you," Barachiel says to no one in particular as he leans Remiel against the couch. He shuffles over on his knees after cleaning all the blood off himself with a thought. He's trying to not look up at Robert because then he'd look guilty and he wouldn't be able to explain why. He feels silly because okay, she sort of looks like Eala, he'll give Rem that, but the hair is all wrong and he can't sense anything that...
It’s dark in the bedroom, save for the moonlight. Dean blinks, his mouth is dry but he can’t remember for the life of him what he was dreaming. Next to the bed in the playpen, he hears Abdiel whimper.
His eyes trail up to the intricate symbols carved above the door, trailing their way down along the wood.
“Uhh, yes.” Crap. He didn’t really think about telling his dad. They weren’t even really sure if his dad would get marks but Dean, Cas, and Abe had theirs and Gabriel did some ritual to alter Luc’s and shit, he should have know...
He'd thought Dean was trusting him again. That maybe he'd listen to why Sam had kept the dreams from him, maybe even forgive him for putting them all in danger.
"It kind of is," Anna nods. "That's a big show of trust. Archangels just don't hand off their blades to anyone, much less humans. Most humans can't even perceive that thing, much less hold it."
"Mate? Mate!? Are you out of your mind? You're tricking me aren't you? This is a trick," Raven straightens up as tall as she can with her arms crossed as Gabriel hooks his thumbs into his belt loops and waits and for the first time in decades, hides nothing.
"What did you do?" Gabriel demands, eyes fixed on Dean. He'd know Dean had put his sticky little fingers all over Castiel, had lain with him... "What did you do, you stupid human?"
Then he pushes his feet into his boots, pulls on a t-shirt, and heads down the stairs. The first thing he notices is that Emily's not on the couch and the kitchen lights are on. Curiously and cautiously, he enters the kitchen only to find Bobby sitting at the kitchen table watching the very awake Emily. Death's blade rests on the kitchen table between the salt and pepper shakers. The young woman seems to be... cooking? Baking?
Elle makes a small "huff" sound, then leans over Cas' shoulder, moving her lion around through the air like it was flying.
“Luc,” Sam grins, he’d been hunting imps with Gabe the last two weeks and hadn’t heard from the kid since before then. “What’s up? Good to hear from you.”
“You think so?” He reaches out as Gabriel presses against his side, his wings rippling into existence and coming to curl around Sam and Luc.
He's a bit embarrassed now. He hasn't freaked out like that since... Well... It's been a long time and he was usually alone or Dean was there and that was still sort of awkward. But Gabriel just nods and tugs him to his feet.
"You never did do things by halves," Bobby finally says shaking his head. "Normal's probably scared of you boys."
That gets dry and slightly forced chuckle from Robert, but it's still a chuckle. "That she would," he says, moving to help Barachiel. "You'd better be careful with her."
Gabriel hums pleased Sam noticed. "Some of them are. I suspect they're very interested in what's going on here."
“No!” Dean blurts because shit, “No. I’m not. I’m just... You had a mate, I didn’t think angels remarried or dated after...”
Gabriel huffed and leaned against the gate. This wasn't going to go anywhere. He could probably chase Remiel off if he had to but that was a dangerous move. If Remiel was provoked he could probably find a way to tear the house apart, board by board. Castiel had the right idea and even though Gabriel really wanted to know everything that Lucifer had told Remiel, he knew that bastard wasn't going to share anything he didn't want to.
There's a small shake of the angel's head. "You'd be more able to hide. There are those that would take more pity on a mortal and his child than on a son of Yahweh," he touches the gold lion Elle cuddles almost reverently.
“The horsemen are going to be the larger problem if we can even get through the shield they have set up,” Michael frowns.
Sam nods. "I'm betting Cas didn't chew on it like she does. And considering that Bobby now has chrome on his ceiling, her fit was pretty epic." That made sense, Castiel giving Elle his favorite toy from when he was little. There's a stab of sadness that he and Dean will never
"Bobby?" he asks, as she carefully presses dough into a pie dish. There's a can of blueberries out on the counter. Okay, she's baking, and yeah, he's seen stranger things.
"Being in a vessel changes thing?" Sam asks, trying to not think of glowing pairs of angels where every single
he's going to come before they even get started. "This isn't just... you know this is more than sex. I don't think I can make this just sex. This is
Dean wakes up to the silence. He stares long and hard at the empty bed and crib. He pulls himself into a pair of jeans and a shirt, and he's putting on his boots when his fingers start shaking. When he goes down stairs nothing is going to be what it was yesterday morning. Dean takes breath to steady himself.
"Kiss?" Elle asks, reaching out to pat the lion. Her hair is still damp from her bath, and for some reason so is Dean's hair. His flannel shirt is draped across a chair, damp spots slowly drying. Castiel wonders if that's a side effect from the bath. He had allowed Sam to bath Elle alone that morning.
It slots into place. Cas talks to his dad every week. How long would it take for his dad to apply for a Justicar position?
"The river was after that debacle with that naiad you insulted. This was definitely later," Remiel says assuredly.
Gabriel is over the banister, not even bothering with the rest of the stairs and stopping at the front door, scanning the mess of smoke. Castiel swallows, trying to govern the fresh choking panic that threatens him. Some small wholly human urge to run, hide, protect his young.
"Go ahead, I don't need the stove top," she turns her head slightly and theres a keen intelligence in her green eyes. "There aren't any fresh apples." There's a note to her voice like she's already taken Bobby to task for the lack of fresh fruit in the house.
Bobby clears his throat. "You gonna stand there swaying until you drop her, boy? Go upstairs and sleep, I think me an' an angel can handle a crib."
He’s finally using dish soap on the baby’s wings when his cell phone goes off. Dean sighs, rubs his free hand on his jeans and yanks it out of his pocket.
He frowns and gives Raven the 'I will so fuck your shit up later for this' look which just makes her beam up at him with those fake puppy eyes she's so good at.
Cas is still rocking against him, hard and hot inside, when Dean resurfaces. His mouth drags against Dean's neck, and his wet, sticky hand is splayed across Dean's stomach.
Cas’ eyes widen and Dean cringes, Sam warned him about being blunt. He’s a breath away from apologizing when Cas reaches out and takes his hand.
"You're an idiot to have thought it wouldn't," Raven snaps at him, twining her fingers in her hair as she crouches down in the mud. "Why were you looking for me?"
It’s dusk and Sam is sleepy. Gabriel keeps scratching his fingers through hair on the nape of Sam’s neck while his dad explains the human school system to him. Cas has slipped off to the library with Bobby despite Dean insisting that no one was working today. His brother and Jo are in the kitchen, washing all the cake off of Abe while Ellen laughs and takes pictures. Luc is folded up against Sam’s legs playing with the e-reader that ‘Grandpa John’ had given him. Sam opens his eyes when Luc pokes him, “Dad, I can’t get it to connect to the wifi.”
She does laugh then. "Things were simpler when I was just Anna Milton. I miss that, but I have Crowley back and I can't resent that," she looks at Sam and gives him a small smile. There's a story there, with Crowley, but Sam knows this isn't the time to ask. "Sorry, you didn't need me unloading on you like that."
Castiel is reading the instructions on the back of the container of Elle's formula, he's mostly certain she does not need it for actual sustenance but Sam informed him that routines can be important in a child's life. "I do not see how making conversation can be considered 'sassing' anything."
Crowley's been a demon too long to let the relief that they hadn't found Anna show. She's clever, his Anna, she'll stay safe and out of her brothers' hands. He would rather her align with Lucifer than have her on the rack. Nothing has broken him since hell, because it teaches pain, it makes you want and hate it, but Crowley knows he would break the moment Jhudiel's blade touched her. Because the blade is only the start of it, because Jhudiel likes hurting the flesh before he starts on the soul. Alistair, would have admired the angel's work.
Gabriel inhales sharply but doesn't say anything. Instead he shifts Elle against him as he gets to his feet. Sam stands as well, watching as Gabriel walks around to the crib on the other side of the couch, and gently places Elle in it. Gabriel lingers there, but it's Sam that walks around, leans in beside him to cover her with a blanket and smooth her hair.
The words, lyrical and chiming, that Cas speaks against his skin feels like a reward. So Dean breathes out Cas' name again. The hand slides away from his cock, only for fingers to hook around Dean's waist band and tug down the soft cotton.
It's apparently the right thing to do, because Gabriel takes a step forward and fists his other hand in Sam's t-shirt and just melts against him, burying his face against the side of Sam's neck. He's warm and lighter than Sam thought he'd be and he lets go of the archangel's wrist to wraps his arms around him because, well, he's already gotten away with this much. It turns out that's allowed too because Gabriel lets out a different sort of sigh, this one sounding more of relief, and presses against Sam as tightly as he can.
The Hunter community flipped their shit until they figured out that no one could make the angels do anything they didn’t want to and these were the first that were sort of on their side.
Elle's crib is empty, when Sam gets downstairs, but he can hear Gabriel's voice in the kitchen and Elle's chiming laugh. He picks his way through the stacks of books and around the couch and chair towards the kitchen. Sam leans against the doorway, watching Gabriel fiddle in a cupboard with Elle on his hip. Gabriel's talking in that lyrical language to Elle, who's waving her lion at him and pointing at the bowl of strawberries that had appeared at some point during the night. She squirms and and reaches, wriggling in Gabriel's grip, and Sam holds back laughter at how exasperated Gabriel looks.
"Never leave home without it or your American Express card," she laughs, and nuzzles his collar bone again.
Sam freezes. His dad can’t do that. Only a Justicar could do that. Castiel tilts his head above him, “Did I forget to mention that your father received a promotion?”
"Me being an idiot again," Sam tells him, not really wanting Bobby to be pissed at him too. Time enough for that later.
"I suspect he will come for you soon. Both your fathers will." Dean Winchester will say yes to Michael, Lucifer will have his vessel, Castiel will be destroyed, the traitors would be punished. Michael will triumph over Lucifer as he should and Paradise will come. This was surely their Father's plan. Michael would not lead them astray.
"Your mate is an idiot," Gabriel snaps and Castiel just nods like this isn't new information. "You didn't tell him about Sam's dreams, did you?"
, and she was ridden by a demon for months. She held a Horseman's blade in her hand. Dean thinks it'll be a miracle if she wakes up sane. But he hopes she does. For Bobby's sake. For the woman on the phone's sake. For the haunted look in Barachiel's eyes when he looked at Emily after Remiel's slurred words in their language.
"Castiel named her," Sam says, because it's important and he might be a little proud to tell someone.
"Did you know? That you were gonna fall?" Barachiel's voice is low, like someone could hear him. "Is that why you... stopped coming around?"
Then Abe whimpers. It’s a soft noise but all of a sudden all of the awe and power just drain out of the guy and his face just crumples as he breathes out, “Abdiel...”
The look on Dean's face is anything but flattering and Castiel frowns as he feels his cheeks beginning to burn. It is an unpleasant sensation and for not the first time since he met his mate does he wish the man would just... "drop it".
Dean wakes up to the sounds of dinner being made and of squealing. He shoves his head under his pillow, it's excited squealing so he's not worried but really, if she's that excited she's going to shift and... There's a low chiming noise and he hears Sam yell and then Bobby starts yelling at Sam... Dean grins. Sometimes his brother is an idiot. He dozes for a a few minutes until he picks up footsteps on the edge of his hearing and a cool hand slides over his lower back.
The next moment happens so fast it blurs. Dean sees Bobby come out of the kitchen holding a shotgun, bloody and missing his hat. Just as the angel grabs Emily and tosses her away like a rag doll. Bobby shouts and the gun goes off. Before Dean knows it the angel is on Bobby and Dean is scrambling to find Cas' sword or Death's blade or
“Gabriel,” the storm thunders and the Archangel dips his head in greeting, “Good, I have been waiting. I have a job for you.”
"Called her a monstrosity," Gabriel growls. "I think he would have killed her even if she hadn't been another glitch in his prophecy. If I hadn't gotten there..."
Besides he’s too little to make an awesome god yet. Right now he’d be Abdiel, guardian of Pig and slayer of jelly doughnuts.
Dean narrows his eyes. "And how would he figure out anything from your empty bedroom? What did you give him a map to Bobby's house or just loudly proclaim where we were staying at?"
Gabriel bristles...no, Gabriel looks ruffled, like a bird puffing out its feathers in annoyance. "I'm not upset," Gabriel hisses.
Castiel supposed that it was a testament to their relationship that Dean didn't immediately discount him when he brought up words such as "belief" now. Of course he still made faces, faces that faded when Castiel spoke next.
Some part of Barachiel, some tiny part thought that heaven should probably have better security. Maybe some guards or wards or something. Honestly, he'd been thrown out of pubs for doing less than this. He made his way carefully through the shining city. That was pretty much the best representation of heaven as anything but light and sound. It was... It wasn't what Barachiel remembered. He remembered the light and laughter of heaven. The glorious warmth. This place was... different. He hadn't been back in years, after Gabriel had kipped off and Anael disappearing to Earth more often than not, there hadn't been a real reason to stay. Everyone got left to their own devices, maybe if he'd bloody paid more attention then Zachariah wouldn't have started this whole damn mess.
They're all eating, or attempting to eat. Even the baby had munched down on a fry, and Cas had cautiously tried one.
Dean thinks maybe he should leave this alone, but he wants answers. Needs them. There's a bigger picture here and he's got a feeling he needs to see it. If just for Cas and Elle's sake. "Y'know it would have been easier to explain to Bobby what the fuck happened out there and why there's a demon in his basement, if I understood myself."
Because this isn't good. That child shouldn't exist and there will be consequences for this, consequences he doesn't want Castiel to have to pay. Castiel is already in love with this - his child. Gabriel almost laughs. Of course he is. Castiel is so stupidly in love with Dean, of course he would love their child.
"I trust you," Dean tells him, then lets Castiel go. He scoops up Elle and blows on her stomach again. It makes their fledgling squeal and laugh. "Go show off your wings, baby girl."
"I'll tell Kali you're being serious for once in your life and to not eat your eyes and I can probably go talk to Ogmios and Athena for you. I dunno about anyone else," she shakes her wings out as Gabriel nods.
Gabriel is sitting on the hood of one of the many junked cars scattered across the salvage yard, starting up at the clear night sky. If he was human he might be cold, but he's not, even though he's wrapped in flesh. The stars are calming.
Or other things... Like... Paintings or sunsets or any of that new age drivel that Lucifer found so funny. Or trying to think quietly about things that weren't family and falling and ex-lovers...
Gabriel snorts again. "Good thing, too. I don't think the humans could take the shrieking. I don't think there's anyone she doesn't like. "
ravens land in Gabriel’s circle, coming up to him in unison and bowing their heads. Gabriel lifts his hand from the dirt, turns it over in supplication and Dean isn’t sure what happens. But Gabriel curls his hand around something that Dean can’t see as the birds fly away, spiraling up into the sky.
“His name is Abdiel. It’s in his Marks. What have you been calling him?” Sam has that ‘oh my god, you’re such an embarrassment’ tone of voice and Dean so did not miss that.
A door opens and footsteps cross over broken glass. He hears the demons shifting, restless and his head flops down when the angel lets him go.
Dean's forcing himself into tunnel vision, into pure hunter mode. He has to. If he even thinks for a moment about how much he has to lose...
He can hear footsteps. Four demons, one angel. Demons that he thought were firmly in his pocket. He should already know everything there is to know about turncoats and betrayal. Well, you learn something new everyday.
Sam doesn't comment on the slip, barely notices it because he knows how Dean is going to take this. He knows what Dean's going to think about Sam keeping this from him. It'll be another lie, another reason Sam can't be trusted
All at once he stands and she flinches and the baby whimpers. He tilts his head and looks at her, like he wasn't aware she was in the room at all. Emily swallows, his eyes are brown. His suit is torn and he starts pacing in front of the door, flipping the blade in his hand. He takes care to keep a wide berth from her and it takes her a minute to realize that Elle's gone quiet. She's sucking on her lion and watching him pace. They both are.
She laughs again, a bright musical thing, "You silly angel, do you think your father would let me make anything he didn't want?" She turns back to the barn, waving her hand at him, "Silly thing, there's still rules and all to follow. Can't make the little ones without following the rules..."
Dean smiles because he can get behind that. But the smiles fades because now he’s got a trio of homeless angels that as soon as some people get wind of... Dean opens his mouth before his brain has a chance to process what he’s saying.
Sam's not sure he'd say it was good. Nothing was ever good or how it used to be, and that was his fault. Mostly. But, maybe...
"You three have been lucky to keep it hidden as long as you have," he tells Mendel softly. "Leave this battlefield to come, either retreat to heaven or find a safe refuge here on earth."
Familiar feeling, familiar pain, wrong voice, wrong eyes, but Gabriel can see the wisps of shadow that follow the angel. Castiel stands above him, staring down with his head tilted. Gabriel can’t feel anything but hurt and confusion. He isn’t sure what belongs to him anymore.
“I’m gonna take a wild guess and say it’s not kittens,” Dean frowns because he’s starting to remember the chatter over the channels last week.
"You dare come before me after failing so miserably? I ask you and the others to do one simple thing, to bring me one empty headed fertility goddess and you are all that's left. Did she giggle the others to death?" The room is filled with the sound of pacing footsteps.
"If Barachiel was a danger do you think Elle would be so calm?" Cas asks, detaching Elle's hand from his tie as he speaks.
"Gabriel trusts him," Sam says softly. "He wouldn't let someone in that was going to hurt Cas or Elle."
Anna stumbles back as she hears glass breaking, the angels on her side of the house have taken to the sky but she isn't so sure about Barachiel and Remiel's side. She's halfway on the porch when she freezes. Dean is hurt, frantically trying to grab a blade he can't reach and Jhudiel...
That wasn't something Gabriel could forget. The shadows of fiery wings dragging on the ground as the spear dropped out of Michael's hand. There was rejoicing everywhere but where Lucifer had been sealed. Gabriel thought that he saw Michael weeping, but it could have been anything, the air was so thick with smoke and blood.
Dean leans closer, resting his forehead against the side of his head. "I know you'll try. But she's... we gotta put her first. You'd be able to protect her better, you'd be able to hide her better."
Gabriel watches Castiel's frown change and deepen. If he were in his true form Gabriel is sure his wings would be ruffled in displeasure. Castiel swings his head around to stare at Dean. "Dean..."
"Other than existing?" Dean asks sharply. The baby makes a sound in her sleep, and Dean soothes her with a hand on her back. Sam gives him a bitchface. "Don't give me that look, you're the one that does all the extra credit research. Angel and human babies aren't allowed, Sammy."
He remembers the Home, him and Sammy only stayed there a week while their dad was on a hunt in another sector but it was shit. It was where orphans and crippled hunters and every thing that had ever lost hope lived. Dean had been lucky after he was hurt he had his dad and Ellen and Bobby to set him up as a Hub.
“Hey Cas,” he goes for nonchalant and tries to jam any surface thoughts he has far away from where they might be heard.
He wants to rail at her, to scream, but he can't. He shouldn't have this, this is dangerous and wrong and... "Stubborn woman," he huffs, cupping the back of her neck as she settles against him, familiar shape, familiar warmth, all the pieces clicking into place though they shouldn't be.
"We don't know, Barachiel. He might be getting orders from Michael." It pains him to say it but he needs to be said.
"Castiel, shit, I'm sorry," he gets out in English. It's tense for far too long until Castiel nods without looking up and now Barachiel wants to explain, he wants something... Castiel was still so young when it all happened, he's still young. Barachiel shouldn't be laying this at his feet. Especially not now, not in front of his human mate and his fledgling and...
They tear the roof off in a cyclone of shingles and nails but before they hit the porch Rem is there. A ringing chime reverberates through the air as he slams his wings out and drags Barachiel and Emily to the ground wrapping his wings around them. Barachiel doesn't know what's happening but he holds onto Emily as best he can and curls against Remiel. He prays.
"Don't make this hard, Sammy," Jhudiel tells him patting his cheek. Then the angel's fingers dig in, force his jaw open. "Open wide."
"Shouldn't someone let Anna know what's happened?" Sam speaks up, edging towards Gabriel hesitantly in a way that speaks of wanting to give comfort but unsure if it'll be welcome. "Wards or not..."
"Zachariah is lying!" The statement echoes, it bounces off of blank walls and very suddenly Barachiel knows exactly how Gabriel was feeling when he showed up at the front gate without a damned idea about anything. "Nothing is under control! Zachariah is fucking it all up! Zachariah is commanding angels! He's commanding bloody Archangels! He had Raphael fucking try an' kill Castiel!"
"Yeah," Barachiel nods. "Looks good, it's just slow going. I think he might be poisoned, but that's fading."
Gabriel just groans and glares. This is pretty much right on the list of the last things he needs right now. "Raven, what the hell?"
Blood is poured into his mouth again. Sam gags against it, fighting as much as he still can. It’s useless. Jhudiel's hand clamps over his mouth, forcing him to swallow. Tears leak from his eyes. "Good boy."
Gabriel, for the first time, wishes that his Father is truly gone if only for the sake of Castiel's fledgling. He sets his shoulders and goes to find dear Prudence.
Gabriel turns his head slightly towards Sam, ignoring his bickering siblings for a moment. "You knew Anna as human right?"
Dean nods, "I can tell you where we saw her last. She might still be hanging around." He grins slightly, "She said something about a party she wished she could invite me to."
"Dead." Remiel doesn't sound like he regrets it but Nuriel wouldn't have been the first brother he'd killed. Or likely the last.
He gets the distressed, "I think you are being very foolish, Dean", head tilt, but Cas follows him the rest of the way up the stairs. When they reach the guest room Dean's claimed, he pins Cas to the door with a hungry kiss.
Robert shakes his head. "After that long with a demon riding her, then an exorcism? Damn miracle she's alive." there's something not quite right with the flow of it as it is"
“That’s normal.” Dean smiles as he drags Pig over and holds it as Abe wraps himself around the stuffed animal. “Do I remind you of him? Is that why...”
A third finger joins the first two, and Dean can do nothing more than try to give Cas more room. The position doesn't allow him much movement, but Cas seems content and Dean's limbs feel heavy from just waking up. "Ah," Dean whispers, eyes closing again, shutting out the world even more.
"Yeah," Sam agrees. "It is better. You know in the Middle ages they thought auroras were signs from God."
"Look," he starts. "She's alright. She's safe. I didn't hurt her. Gabriel didn't hurt her. She's fine. Robert's gonna take care of her, you gotta let me take care of you, okay?"
Barachiel steps forward and slides all the papers onto the table as well, upsetting the owl who flap plops over to Michael. “I went back up to heaven for a bit, from what I gathered up there no one knows that Michael’s kipped off. Zachariah might not have expected him to actually come down here and check out his handy work. He didn’t expect someone to go up there and make a fuss.”
Fuck, he’s really gotta start asking more questions about this whole process. Gabriel is still frowning and Dean thinks he’s had about enough of this.
Gabriel takes a breath, then shakes his head, then sighs. "You're going to pout if I say no aren't you?"
Gabriel closes his eyes, growls, and all the glass in the kitchen rattles. "It's complicated, and you don't even understand half of what it means for Castiel to be with you, so how do you expect to understand this? I'll put it in small words so you can understand Winchester, if Crowley died, Anna would have died too. He's her mate, her other half now, she'd have gone mad with grief or just wasted away."
"Don't mean now. Worst case scenario, when... if things get really bad," Dean feels the tremor that runs through Cas. "You know I'm right. Gabriel said that... Lucifer... if he's not gone, he might help protect Elle if it comes to that. You're his brother."
as kids. A half-angel baby might be a piece of cake for him after them. "Bobby might be able to help us keep her in human form and we’ll draw less attention…”
Cas finishes the library a little before spring. Dean only knows this because he comes out of the bedroom one morning and his desk is gone. He goes down the hall to complain but stops behind Abe’s playpen.
Behind him Dean hears the front door open and close, sharp and hard. Dean strokes his hand down Elle's back.
“Yeah,” Dean says, snagging the corner of the playpen and wheeling it down the hallway after him so Cas doesn’t have a choice to not follow. “I mean it’s probably not as big as you’re used to...”
"Fertility goddess?" Gabriel interrupts, well, that explains a whole lot. He lets the anger seep out of him. There were rituals that were best not thought about...and it was far better if this was an outside influence.
He hears Sam walk across the room, before he comes to stand beside him. Sam's still holding one of the books he was looking at, and it occurs to Dean that Sam must have seen some of the lights from the living room window.
They're suddenly pressed skin to skin, cock against cock and Sam thinks he could come just from this. From the slow steady push of skin and against skin, and Gabriel's cock rubbing against his.
Gabriel had said that the baby could not have been created without their Father's knowledge, but Castiel worries -- fears that this is punishment. To be given this tiny life, whom Castiel finds he is incapable of
Sam had insisted on driving after that first stop, and Dean grudgingly agreed. His hand ached, despite the pain pills he'd popped (and he'd never been so grateful for angel mojo as when they discovered all their gear stowed safely in the trunk).
and... All of a sudden the pieces fall into place. She marked him, she should have been able to heal him, she'd gone and... He'd though it was a fling, something to pass the time or prove she was more cunning, smarter. Something stupid, something silly. Now... Anna couldn't help her
Gabriel turns his head and gazes at Elle, who's happily drinking her bottle in her new highchair. Innocent, and happy, with no concept of what her mere existence has done... Sam wonders if he ever looked like that or if he was tainted beyond innocence even then. "He'll take her and keep her as his own. He might even see it as his due. Something denied to him."
Castiel is quiet as he makes his way downstairs, listening intently to Elle who is in his arms, playing with the collar of his shirt and repeating a story Gabriel told her. The details are familiar but he was quite certain that the inventor of modern vehicles was not a lemur. Nor was the first car named after Gabriel. But he nods politely and decides to speak to his brother about the grand fabrications he's telling his fledgling. Of course it was all very possible that at some point in time Gabriel did indeed turn someone into a lemur and Elle got it mixed up. Castiel frowns slightly, separating fact from fiction when Gabriel is concerned may prove more difficult than he first thought.
"Ah, ah," Remiel holds a finger up. "You know I don't take orders from you, so don't even try. Wipe that purposeful look off your face."
that good?" Dean asks, cradling Elle against his side. Their fledgling looks anxious and scared, in a way Castiel never wanted her to be.
He tries again but can't sense anything beyond the wards. "Well, I assume we aren't waiting for Jhudiel to decide he wants to torture us more or else you should really not be this calm. Really he's quite good at his job, he should send an application into hell for the chief torturer position. I hear there's a vacancy now." He ran through the short list of allies and family Anna had. She'd mentioned Remiel, one of the fallen and lieutenant to Lucifer. Maybe his Anna had pleaded with her brother and gained protection for them. He didn't much like the idea, but if it kept
"I'm not Sam," Castiel says softly, walking towards the bed. He sheds his trench coat as he does so. He's found it... more comfortable to be without it of late. It's odd.
Castiel is rather afraid that Dean will say 'father' because that wasn't what Gabriel was at all. "Gabriel is my older brother. He took care of me."
Anna makes a noise very much like a laugh, sliding her arm around his waist, gently as if he'll break. "I'll protect you," she promises between kisses.
Dean rolls his eyes and rolls onto his side on the bed as his fingers get tugged on, he curls them around the baby’s hand and watches him wrinkle his nose.
Barachiel decides that he is not going to care how much Rem bitches when he's awake, he is considering his condition 'shitkicked' and providing the requisite fussing. Also, that crap at the gate? Sending him inside before the demon showed? Barach isn't stupid. Rem knew. There're gonna be words later. Now that there is a later. Shit. Another inch with that fucking knife and he would have been tearing down to hell itself to get him back. Stupid knife. Stupid demons.
Castiel learns. Gabriel shows him how to fly. How to unfurl tiny wings of shadow and light and just dive, not fall. Castiel flies, and then
He yanks a shirt on and slips down the hall, stopping just out of sight to hear Dean sigh noisily, “How long was this on the net?”
"I do not think he will wish to fight," Castiel murmurs over Elle's head, trying to reassure his mate.
"Yeah, I should sleep." Dean fumbles, trying to not look at Cas or at Bobby who's frowning something fierce.
Silence passes for far too long before the angel lets out a long noise of displeasure. "It looks like we've reached a dead end."
Sam's rolling thrusts are met by Gabriel, who shoves back like it's all he knows how to do. He pants Sam's name like it's a benediction. There are other words, some he recognizes as his name, others slip from his grasp, Latin, Greek, bits of Enochian. Sam responds with Gabriel's name, "Gabriel." "Gabriyel." "Gabrielus." "Gabriēl.". He promises forever, promises his heart, his soul, and Gabriel whispers the promises back into his mouth.
when he takes in the guy in front of him. He’s average looking, in a rumpled suit and trench coat. His hair is dark, messy but then Dean sees his eyes. Blue, like Abdiel.
Sam climbs out of the Impala, and Dean follows. He hates riding shot gun, it feels weird not being the one that drove his baby. Hand still cradled against his chest, he sees Bobby coming across the yard and puts on his best careless grin. Bobby's already scowling, and he probably knows something up given the fact the Winchesters are supposed to be a state away.
"Neither you or Dean are idjits, despite you both acting it some days," he shakes his head. "And if you two don't stop twisting yourself up in knots over what's done and buried, it's going to get you both killed."
"So, we thought that well... something was going on. But Gabriel won't say anything one way or the other."
"I should have taught you to have a sense of humor," Gabriel sighs, shaking his head, "Did the kid come with a name?"
"Oh really?" Dean mutters as Elle wriggles in her sleep until she's mostly in Dean's lap, tossed haphazardly over his leg.
“Really?” Dean frowns, “I thought he smelled like gunpowder but he’d been in the car with dad all day.”
The demon's grin fades. "We've had a change of management while you've been away. Zachariah says it's time to cut down all the lone wolves. Only team players allowed now."
about the lion but he shakes his head and leaves the room. There are a bunch of little things that are adding up now, but he wants to talk to Cas about it. Because if what he thinks is true, Gabriel isn't really just a brother to Cas.
He can't help it, he laughs. He laughs until it chokes out into something desperate and sobbing. He lets Gabriel wrap his arms around his shoulders because he's knows the Archangel won't tell a soul.
He sees the sword spiral through the air, headed to the ground as the world blurs around him and goes dark.
That was... He couldn't... The complications of something like that would... If he... He'd be bound... He couldn't... Barachiel stops, his eyes trailing over the smooth scars across Emily's back before falling to Remiel's finger's, stained red before he nods at Robert. "Yeah, I can."
While Cas has somehow jammed himself up against Dean’s side despite the very clear conversations they’ve had about cuddling.
"Yeah well, Gabriel's a dick, don't get me wrong, but I'm pretty sure Cas will kick the shit out of me if I wake the kid up again."
Which is how he ends up shopping at ten o’ clock at night while Jo watches the baby. This was not supposed to be his life. His life was hunting things and saving people. Not trying to figure out how he’s going to jam a playpen into the back of the Impala.
Elle grumbles into his chest, stirring slightly. Gabriel smoothes a hand across her back to settle her, expression softening.
Castiel starts to raises his hands for the baby then drops them. He fixes Gabriel with a stare, and Gabriel sighs impatiently. "This is different. This is
Barachiel knows he's got that haunted look, that one that he tried so hard to shake after the flood, after Rem's Fall. The one that takes way too much alcohol to get rid of. He plasters a smile on his face and is saved from having to answer his brother by Robert, angry and insistent.
The whole room stares at him where he's very purposefully standing against the wall so he isn't seen out any of the windows.
He gets a hand tangled in his hair and Gabriel's mouth devours his. His hands run down Gabriel's back, sliding into the gap between his waistband and his skin. Gabriel can't seem to keep his hands off Sam's skin. They run across his back tracing things into his skin as Gabriel had done with his neck, Gabriel's fingers digging in between his shoulder blades as if Sam has wings. Those clever hands skim along the top of his jeans, then over Sam's trembling stomach and up over his chest, all the time tracing sigils, runes and letters into Sam's skin.
Apparently, Abe absolutely adores Luc and it’s mutual. Which means Dean loves Luc because anyone Abe loves has to be good.
"What is it?" Sam asks as Gabriel pushes past Bobby into the living room with Barachiel on his heels.
. But it's Gabriel and for all the reasons Sam should have to be wary, to fear this Archangel, this Trickster, he holds his ground.
"Okay, that was a... little weird." Nope, that was actually pretty damn weird. Like on a scale of one to ten that was a thirteen. He was pretty much betting that whatever that was, was not just a safety feature.
did and why you didn't think I needed to know?" Dean's words are sharp again, but not as sharp and bitter as when Castiel first entered the room.
It takes a bit before Sam sees the realization dawn on Luc’s face. Then he’s got an armful of blubbering angel and Gabriel is leaning back with a ‘he does that’ look on his face and a smile. They curl together until Luc stops crying and they send Gabriel to bring back a roll of toilet paper so he can blow his nose.
Gabriel makes a face, like Sam isn't supposed to see it, like he was supposed to be blind to the flinch that went through Gabriel when they shut up the panic room. He wasn't supposed to see how quickly the archangel tore himself away from everyone. But despite what some people think, Sam isn't stupid and to be frank, the idea of Gabriel in his bed in any situation has been prodding at the back of his mind since Anna brought up courting.
Dean sits up completely. Elle is still giggling and is babbling to her lion, making it hop across the bed. "And you want them to see her "angel" form." There's no judgment behind the words.
"I think I have the right to," Dean points out. He's not even angry... he just wants to know. "And Anna's my friend."
Dean knew it was about him... That’s when his brain crashes to a messy halt. Cas likes him and Dean’s pretty sure it wasn’t I like you as a friend. He knows he’s blinking, trying to wrap his head around it because what? Cas had a mate and didn’t angels...? What!?
Castiel wants to say that it was probably Gabriel's intention that she live but that's when things turn frantic again. Barachiel is in the doorway carrying Remiel, the fallen's face painted with blood and Gabriel is behind them, barking at Barachiel to take him to the kitchen. Gabriel shoves the kitchen table over as Barachiel settles down on the floor with Remiel in his lap. Remiel's coat is dark with blood and it smears on the tile floor everywhere it touches. Castiel hears Sam hiss behind him as Barachiel pulls Remiel up and he sees the handle of the knife sticking out of the fallen's shoulder.
Gabriel lets her stagger off, back into the barn to find more couples and more drink. If she'd been following the rules then...
A demon was... "A demon?" Gabriel repeats incredulously. He's had his share of pagan demi-gods and goddesses in his bed over the centuries but he drew the line at demons. He can't imagine any angel, fallen or not, allowing a demon to touch them willingly. And that meant... "What did he do to you?"
The action is so bare and so human that Sam grins, then laughs, getting a smile in return from the archangel. There's something there in Gabriel's eyes, something soft and just the smallest bit devious. Sam knew if he asked that Gabriel would take him anywhere, all he'd have to do was say the word. It's tempting, it's more than tempting, but... But they can't afford that right now. Gabriel is needed here and Sam well... Sam can at least try to help.
Dean holds Elle protectively to his chest as he glares at the newcomer, whose speaking to Castiel and Gabriel in that odd lilting tongue. Elle seems to be listening to them and she's calm in Dean's arms. Calm and quiet, watching the Barachiel curiously as she chews on her lions ear (Dean figures she's going to have a few new teeth coming in soon).
Gabriel knows almost a dozen ways to kill a demon but to heal one? His mind is coming up blank. He can hear Castiel and Dean talking behind him on the porch, quick, hushed words that he can barely make out under Anna's keening sobs and now... Shit, now Barach is whimpering because his sister won't look at him, won't let go of the demon, won't pull back. There's a shift in the air and the sound of chiming glass and then Remiel is there. Gabriel thinks it's been millenniums since he's been glad to see that shifty bastard.
Gabriel unfurls his wings and shoots off to where Castiel is without hesitation - no sigils and signs and hex bags in the world could hide his fledgling from him. It's another one of the horrid little motels the Winchesters seem to have a sad addiction to, and Gabriel takes some comfort in that. He isn't landing in the middle of a battle with all parties being varying degrees of alive. Gabriel enters the motel room expecting to find Dean or Sam injured. He expects blood. He even expects it to be bad.
Dean waits a few moments before he reaches down and scoops up the baby which lets out a ‘meep’. He puts him on the bed and watches him curl up in a ball. Dean is patient and he keeps his emotions under control, his mind blank and even.
Sam swallows and kisses Elle's head. "Sound's good to me. What do you think Elle? Want to try some waffles this morning?"
Sam is only vaguely aware that he's staring at Gabriel's fingers, golden in the light, when Elle burbles something and drops her bottle with a 'thunk!'. Sam lets her pull herself up on his shirt and extends his arm for her to hang on to as she wobbles a foot before letting herself down, hard, in Gabriel's lap. The Archangel winces and Sam closes his eyes trying not to laugh.
He pushes the thought away as he follows the sound of Elle's high bright laugh and Dean's deeper one. He finds Dean and their fledgling in the room he shares with Dean. Castiel smiles fondly watching Dean play with Elle on the bed.
The Archangel in question keeps talking, "Anyway, I ask around and end up chatting to a couple of pagan birds who told me you'd gone Trickster - nice move by the way; fun job, nice perks,” he said nodding approvingly, “They were goin’ on about how one of their lot hit the bottle a bit hard one night and went and made a little angel sprog, and gave it her rescuers as some sorta reward which is what Zachariah was so pissed off about. I put two an' two together and worked out it
Dean swallows, because those blue eyes are looking right at him. He doesn’t know what Cas is talking about, continue what? Talking? Working on the library?
Sam blushes as Gabriel jumps out into the mud, shutting the door behind him. Raven has assumed the form of a skinny girl in torn jeans with a hoodie sporting a picture of a shotgun and the words 'Zombie Repellent', her long dark hair chimes musically with all the trinkets woven into it as she shakes her head.
Dean is moving before he even knows it because that was not Cas' calm voice. That was the "get your gun" voice and he has no problem with shooting something right now.
Castiel lets out a breath and Gabriel bumps his shoulder in silent thanks as he turns and heads back in the house. Castiel watches him make his way past the kitchen and nods quietly to himself as he sees Sam turn and follow Gabriel down to the panic room.
After taking one look at Castiel’s meticulously noted log of today’s calls, Dean can’t help but blink as he slides into his desk chair. Of course Cas has this under control. He should have known. But it’s been so long since Dean had just let go.
The baby is crying again, clearly terrified. Tears stream down her face and her nose is in desperate need of wiping. Dean kisses her forehead, face twisted in anger, fear, and desperation, and for a brief moment Sam sees another Winchester holding another crying, frightened baby.
"He does not seem to have fuzzy buttons, this is true," Castiel agrees, with a smile. He leans closer and kisses Dean's throat, relishing the noise his mate makes and the soft sigh that follows it.
“I don’t like the sound of maybe. Do you even have running water in here?” Gabriel furrows his eyebrows.
She's at him in a moment, sliding into the space where he used to be. He's fast, frighteningly so, he was always so
orders, yeah? Dunno if you got the memo, what with you being all Trickster-like, but when Dad buggered off he put Michael in charge upstairs."
Barachiel sighs. If there was anything to be said about Remiel it was that he was a stubborn bastard when he got a hold of something. "If I look her over, if I
The scuffle on the front porch only lasts as long as it took for Bobby to come downstairs and chew out the two "ijdit" angels that can't seem to get a simple task done.
"He weren't the same after the First war, it just got worse after that. You'd stay away for ages before you left for good, you didn't see all of it." Barachiel rolled the unlit cigarette around in his hand. "You didn't see how bad he got."
The archangel sighed and looked at where the Morningstar was lounging, light glittering about his form.
A blade shimmers into existence in Amon's free hand. It's short, jagged and looks like it's made of bone. A Horseman's blade. Death's blade...
Sam finally meets his eyes and the fear there almost takes Dean aback. Dean -- he's forgiven Sam so much but this is his daughter's safety. Sam's his brother, that's never going to change, but he can't --
"I will," Lucifer grins, coming around the couch. "Although I did expect better of you. Honestly, your world is coming to an end and this is what you choose to do?"
They lay in the dark until Dean stops reliving the worst night of his life. Castiel is rubbing his back and making these low noises of comfort  that seem to slide into Dean, his brain seeming to have a primal sort of recognition of them.
"She had sex with Dean?" Gabriel asks, because okay that was new information. "She had sex with her brother's... and Dean, what decided to see how many angels he could bang?"
They can’t get Castiel off Gabriel for a minute, the other angel shrieking when Michael tries to move him. But then Dean is there and Lucifer balks for a moment at how easily the human lifts and gathers Castiel to him. How easily Castiel allows it.
Anna stands open-mouthed for a few moments. "The new fledgling?" she echos back. There's a flash of horror in her eyes. "Gabriel, please tell me that..."
Dean shakes his head, wondering if he should read something into the fact Cas didn't give him the time down to the second. There was a time he'd have done that. "I'll eat when we're done."
Bobby nods as he enters the house. "Good, 'cause I've got that ol' crib Sam used up in the attic but I didn't keep too much of that stuff."
"Well, Zachariah can go fuck himself. Ordering the Archangels about and trying to kill your fledgling... He was always a pissy little tosser." Barachiel frowns and digs through his pockets until he pulls out a crumpled cigarette, which he frowns harder at.
Which is where he’s hiding now because he hates fighting, his brother and his dad having used up his patience on that forever ago. He’s trying to translate Cas’ notes from this ridiculously old dictionary thing that Bobby sent him while Abe sits in his lap playing with a Rubik's cube that Dean found in his desk.
Dean is whispering harshly to Castiel. "Why do we need him? We can handle this. It's not permanent."
Dean reaches out and brushes his hand across Castiel's jaw, then touches the pendant. "Hey, you'll find him."
Fuck, fucking fuck. That was not what he needed to hear. Remiel is powerful and can be practically unreadable at times but... Jhudiel is just a cold bastard who should have fallen years ago. Gabriel can't imagine that Jhudiel has improved since he's been gone and Michael's been locked up in his tower trying to forget the world.
"She is... She is trying to fix you," he tells Dean and there's part exasperation, part pride in his voice as he steps forward and rubs his hand over her head, "She isn't fully aware of how to do so yet. Her grace is far too young, but once she's older..."
When Castiel is big enough he fights. He fights even when Gabriel doesn’t want him to. Castiel fights even when
Gabriel sighed and opened his eyes, glaring at Sam. "Father got bored and decided to make an angel that couldn't take care of itself and gave it to me. Happy?"
Dean smiles and then winces when Elle whacks the watch on the tray of her highchair a couple of times like an egg.
"Daddy!" Elle lets go of Castiel's shirt to try and walk towards Dean, but winds up falling on her bottom. Castiel is worried for a split second but Elle just giggles.
Dean frowns at the pan in the sink and then at the baby who is making pitiful retching noises. “Aw fuck, I was hoping that was a myth.”
“Sure I like kids,” Jo grins at him, “As long as I get to give them back. Does he sleep in that laundry basket?”
"Do you want a kiss then, cupcake?" Gabriel asks, leaning down to give the little girl a kiss on her cheek. Sam watches out of the corner of his eye as Elle pats Gabriel's cheek. His heart clenches and he wants... he wants...
"Yes, it's very subtle, I mean, it's an old system and not especially meant for humans. Really, we were a bit surprised to see Gabriel doing anything like that. We thought..."
Gabriel fists clench at his sides. "He hasn't just been trying to kill, Castiel," he says in a harsh whisper. If Zachariah hadn't managed to escape, Gabriel would have killed him. He would have willingly torn out his wings and ripped away his grace.
the door yet is that he’d have to move them to work the knob. He's surprised they haven't gotten complaints yet; hell, he's surprised the cops haven't shown up.
Zachariah has kidnapped the fledgling. It’s only a matter of time now before they kill him and end this farce of an apocalypse that they have all been dragged into. The humans are staring at him with open hostility. All but Remiel’s girl, but they haven’t been introduced yet. He doesn’t like it. He turns towards the door, he doesn’t want to be dragged into the house, if they don’t want him here he’ll gladly leave.
What in the...? He spots Sam sprawled out on the couch laughing into his book as Gabriel rolls his eyes. He's sitting on the floor with Cas next to him and they've both got papers with sigils and tiny, tiny, writing spread out over their laps. Cas turns and beams at him when he comes down the stairs.
He tries not to hyperventilate when he realizes that no one has been answering the phones all day until Gabriel tells him that
He runs his fingers carefully over her head and down her back. Gabriel doesn't quite know what he's looking for until he finds it - grace, tiny and new born dwelling under her delicate human skin. He holds an impossibility.
He looks up slowly, registers the grateful look on Gabriel’s face and it’s way too late to try to back out of that.
Castiel looks up to find his brother frowning and fears the disappointment he is sure Gabriel will feel in him. "Dean struck Zachariah before you intervened."
There's an explosion of light outside, something that takes out the rest of the windows and the angels are screaming. Dean spots Castiel pushing his way out of a pile of abandoned vessels and the house is silent for a brief moment.
"Castiel tied himself to you the moment he gave you his mark, Dean. There's no going back on that, no matter how you treat him," Gabriel says finally, but it's obviously not what he wants to say. "Where are our brothers by the way?" It's an obvious attempt to change the subject but yeah, Dean can handle that.
Barachiel takes off his hat and does a half bow. "My pleasure. Heard enough about you, Winchester, you're the highlight of heavenly gossip you know."
It’s all blues and dark wood with glass doors in front of the shelves. There’s a world map spread above his desk, something yellowed and ancient. A rack of scrolls sits under a window that Dean didn’t even know was there. Hell, for all he knows Gabriel put it in.
"I am not in the mood for any of your games. You are outside the wards and exposed, you are being a danger to the fledgling."
Gabriel winces like Sam has wounded him with his words before rolling his eyes. "Thor and I only dressed up like women that
Oh... That is... That is incredibly freaky and he doesn't need to think about someone checking their watch to see the time in hell, because who the fuck would want to know that? Remiel is going to say something, something that Dean is going to react badly to because this is too happy, too much like having a real family and Dean can't... Forty Years...He can't...
Gabriel smiles, then laughs. "Might be." He tilts his head, watching the way the moonlight paints Sam. "What do you think?"
. I doubt he's killed him but he could trap him temporarily. And if there are demons that are listening to him, demons as high on the ladder as Amon then..."
Emily's eyelashes flutter for a moment, and she breathes a word this girl in the here and now shouldn't know. Then just as quickly she falls back into unconsciousness. Barachiel winces. He shouldn't be around her because all the marks and light he and Rem left on Eala are going to start lighting up in this girl and after the day... months she's had...
Remiel pauses, just for a moment, before he sighs. "My secondary orders are to protect the fledgling at any cost."
"I'm fine now," she breathes against him and lets him pull her against him as tightly as he can bear.
"Joking!" Sam backpedals as both angels let out a breath. "But really, what are you talking about? This whole courting thing?"
. He remembered laughter and copper blond hair and the flutter of dyed fabric drying in the breeze. Two sets of hands on his borrowed human vessel, three bodies curled up in furs, the way Barachiel radiated joy like a sun whenever they were all in that tiny house. The time he was content before the Flood, before the Morningstar truly raged, before he doubted, before he fell.
Thunder booms almost directly overhead, the skies opening up. The rain comes quickly and hard. It intrudes upon their nest, leaving Sam shivering as the cold drops hit his overheated skin. He flings out an arm as he arches into Gabriel and grabs a hold of the door pulling at it until it closes. Sam runs his hands over Gabriel's back, spreading the cool water across his almost burning skin.
Bobby sighs and mutters something under his breath. Castiel politely pretends he doesn't understand it.
He knows for a fact that the archangel is on his last nerve of the day and he'd hate to make it worse. But he'd also hate for Gabriel to get impatient and just read what happened out of someone's head.
Gabriel's face stayed neutral though Sam saw the barest ghost of a frown. "Are you looking for a definition of the word or a history?"
Jhudiel keeps telling the story. Yes. They came to save you. Gabriel wasn’t expecting War. So much blood and how he screamed. War is still laughing about it. Jhudiel's fingers clenched in his hair, pulling his head back. "Thirsty?" he says into Sam's ear.
Dean rolls his eyes. "Great. I'd say it was a pleasure but I'd be lying. We've got no reason to trust you."
She's through the air in a second, tearing the angel off of Bobby and sending both of them rolling around the living room, snarling and slashing at each other like animals. She's going to rip his throat out. He's trying to break her wrist but she sinks her fingers into his shoulder and he growls. She shoves her borrowed sword through his side as he tries to throw her off. He's got his hand around her throat and she sees his sword come down.
He takes a deep breath and just goes for it, trying to ignore the fact that this is the first time he’s spoken to his brother in three years.
A silent moment passes, a flash of anger in gray eyes. "Ran. I lost him in Bangladesh, but he was hurting." He looks towards Barachiel. "I was... worried for Anael."
"She can't break it," Dean looks up at Remiel who's watching him with a small smile, "It's enchanted, if she manages to scratch it I'll be very impressed."
The first time Sam had brought Gabe to meet Luc could really be categorized as a complete failure. Gabriel had been ridiculously excited and Luc had been completely terrified. Sam blames himself. He’d only told Gabriel that they were going to see another angel. Not a flock-less fledgling that lived in a house that was one broken window away from being condemned.
Sam blinks for a minute before what his dad actually said registered in his head. He’s pretty sure that was his father’s equivalent of ‘congratulations’.
Castiel looks to be about two seconds away from doing something angelically drastic when suddenly the crying stops. The silence is like a knife and Dean works his jaw, trying to pop his ears. Sam, though, is staring at a pair of
Gabriel sent him up here to explain, he sent him up to be level headed and learn the lay of the land and... "It bloody well is not! What's goin' on, Michael? Is this what you do? Father left you in charge to sit up here and piss about while everything goes to shit? You're telling me that you don't have a fucking clue what's been going on!?"
Dean spends the next ten minutes undressing a baby angel, easy, and then trying to get him to spread his wings, hard. He finally figures out that if he just runs his fingers underneath them, combing through the down, the baby turns into a relaxed pile and is easier to work with.
He doesn't turn when the front door opens, or when the sounds of footsteps make their way over to him. It's Sam, he knows before he even looks up. He can sense him, smell him and right now the boy smells like chocolate chip pancakes and is radiating joy. He grins when Gabriel looks up and then he says, "You're amazing."
"Then how come Zachariah’s calling all the shots?" Sam steps forward so that he's even with Gabriel.
Dean rolls his eyes. "What Sam means is that our motel room became ground zero for a angel cat fight, my hand might be broken, and -- " he takes a deep breath then gestures at the waking baby, "This is my magical angel love baby."
Dean loses sight of Bobby as he uses a discarded angel sword to take out two in front of him. He sees Cas go down for a minute, a minute too long, they're getting past, heading down to the panic room.
She snorts. "You'd rather I let you die?" her voice wavers. He can almost taste the fear, an emotion so sweet but it tastes like ashes coming from her.
"Your brother has withstood many weeks of assault and violation by Lucifer. He gave no information willingly," Castiel says softly. He rests his hand on Elle's back. "And he is your brother, you raised him. He fears losing you. You know that."
"It wasn't true. Just because I had grown did not mean..." Castiel very much does not like this feeling. The hollow echo of doubt and loss. The dark sinking truth of when he realized that Gabriel was simply never coming home.
Gabriel knows the instant Sam lets go of his sword. His wings are out on instinct before he's even thinking about it, tossing angels away like paper dolls. He spots Sam in a swarm of them, off the ground and being dragged away. Fucking flying monkeys... With a thought Gabriel has both his swords in hand as he turns and shouts at Anna to fall back. He lost sight of Barach and Rem after the wards came down and he can only hope that they're holding their own.
