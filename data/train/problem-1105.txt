"I got some acquaintances in the army." Mycroft raised his eyebrows to Sherlock. "I can help you get a Family Dormitory for married military personnel, it’s facilities are much better than the single person barracks, and then you can having a family reunion and get married to her in here."
"Something’s wrong at our home?" John was worried. "Involving with my parents?"
"Relax," John whispered softly in his ear and kissed his ear. "Let me in." He took the bottle on the bedside table, painted some paste on his own hand, and then put them on Sherlock's opening and massaged into it.
John Watson shouldn't have a Victorian beard anymore!
When they finished, they only lay naked without a word. John sat against the headboard to light a cigarette, Sherlock just leant against him and looking at the emptiness. At this moment, the sunlight had been nearly gone, the room with no lights soon would be swallowed by the dark shadow. John smoked, then he put the cigarette to Sherlock's mouth, so Sherlock smoked.
When Sherlock losing in the upside-down world, John’s fingers retreated and replaced by his cock, and thrust inside Sherlock hardly. The two connecting bodies tangled on the floor, John’s pounding draw the momentum of them moving from the doorway to the centre of the room. John buried himself hard into Sherlock, harder and harder in every thrust as if he were going to get into Sherlock's heart, to become one with him. Sherlock braced himself for the pounding, the pleasure made him forgotten the hard cold floor behind him, he only felt the breath and the heat of the man who laid on him, and the dazzling sense of satisfaction because of the deeply connection they were forming.
"I really love you." Sherlock hugged John, their panting chests pressed against each other, intoxicated with the lover's smell.
"Why are you here?" John's voice was trapped on Sherlock's chest, it sounded weak. "I clearly said that..."
Sherlock did not remember when he was asleep, but had a hazy memory of something chilly was pasted to his wound, and the gestures were gentle - it’s John, he cleaned themselves and pasted the ointment to Sherlock's wound, tidied up their clothes, covered them with quilts.
Sherlock stared at him, watching the man he missed for nearly seven years.
#              #              #
The smells in the darkness, smoke mixed with the taste of semen and sex - I think I will remember it, Sherlock thought.
"When did she has her responsibility as a normal mother?" Sherlock snorted and rolled his eyes.
John Watson shaved the Victorian beard but kept a Victorian hairstyle.
Sherlock first heard him personally admitted - he really intended to do so. For Sherlock?
I saw your parents. Even Mycroft's boss came to see you.
"Oh..." who was hiding in the last grid?
It seemed that John would not come.
The car was finally parked in front of the Peninsula Hotel which was full of Christmas decorations, the driver opened the door for them, and Mycroft led to the hotel lobby at once. Sherlock and John were following him but fell behind on purpose, when they had a distance with Mycroft, John hold Sherlock's hand quietly, but Sherlock immediately broke it, and then coldly glanced at John, speeding up the pace to catch up with his brother.
John angrily turned Sherlock over to face him, deadly stared at Sherlock, and Sherlock stared back with a look of disdainful and arrogant.
But when Sherlock getting closer, he found it something was going wrong - it was too much publicity to be parked in front of the front door, and it was simply another black car that Sherlock had never seen, only looked similar to John's ride.
Don't always fell into a deep sleep, like a child.
"She's just a simple girl who teaching in our village's elementary school," John picked a piece of food into Sherlock's bowl while talking about his fiancee Mary who was living in England right now. "Our engagement is settled a long time ago, she is a daughter of a distant relative ."
After midnight, Sherlock still could not sleep, he quietly left the cabin, went up on deck for some fresh air. Some music in the distance attracted him, he followed it to the ballroom door, most passengers were sleeping, only several night owls were inside drinking and dancing.
To be honest, Sherlock never cared about these social etiquettes, but that was what happened to John's fiancee - he needed to consider John's feelings and wills. He respected John, so he should respect his fiancee too. At least John said that he liked Mary and treated her as a family member.
"If it were you, I could let you be the top," Victor whispered.
When Miss Woodhouse shouted the name of Sherlock while wearing a very serious expression, Victor sincerely worried for him.
Sherlock found it a little bit interesting, raised one eyebrow towards Victor.
Sherlock rubbed his eyes sleepily, "Who?"
They just stared at each other, the stunned feelings were all hidden behind their sophisticated masks.
Sherlock had no choice but reluctantly followed Lestrade back to his apartment to take a bath and put on the clean clothes he provided. Under Lestrade’s repeated nagging, Sherlock swore that he would stop
John might just on a whim. The letter might not be sent. At least up to now, the letter has not been sent yet. Sherlock decided to pretend that he did not know anything - John did not say a word to him, so Sherlock should not know anything. That was it, left the decision to John.
A miasma of poverty and despair hung in the air among the narrow lanes of London, people who wanted to escape from the reality using sensual pleasures to paralyse themselves, hooligans took the advantages to steal and rob, it was the messiest time for the society.
"Well..." no, not one person, was two.
Followed by the wedding invitation is to take care of a drunken Harry. She said Clara was deceived by the bad guy and they only get married because he got her pregnant. Harry said it just like she was dating a ghost. She can't understand how the sweet good old days were gone, and her partner disappeared suddenly, only left her in the memories and cannot move on.
Sherlock could fight back an offending speech to insult them as a response, to defend John, but he chose to be silent - because he knew that John would prefer him to shut his mouth up.
The room was quiet for a moment, an extreme level of silent that nearly made people tinnitus.
"No, John," Sherlock smiled bitterly, "you love your country, so you becoming a soldier. You love life, so you saving lives by becoming a doctor. You love your family, your parents, so you will not hurt their feelings. Because of love, you will not betray those things, will not do it just for one person, just for me. If you did that you are not John Watson, and the rest of your life you will not be happy.
"I have." Lestrade nodded. "He is my superior... and my friend. He has always been very concerned about you."
James pushed him over the table, pressed against him, bit his shoulder.
Sherlock frowned at him, thinking about whom James was, but the information he had observed was not much - except that he knew James was misbehaving, and he should be gay.
Tears burst out, Sherlock desperately covered his mouth, to stop crying out, but he could not stop his emotional collapse, he had no way to stop...
Sherlock peeped to John's face, just found a tense expression of contemplation. Sherlock's hand was naturally placed on John's thigh, stroking it, as was customary in the past, hoping to soothe John's fickle mood. But John froze immediately, then gently stopped Sherlock's hand and slightly moved away - which meant refusing.
John just caressed Sherlock's cheek, "I will miss you..." he put one of the rings on Sherlock's ring finger, "let it be a memorial," he put the other ring into Sherlock's palm, and then stretched out his hand, "Would you wear it for me?"
Sherlock gradually accelerating, closed his eyes and let himself lost in the joy of sex. John held his waist, raising his upper body to press against Sherlock's hot and sweaty body. Sherlock wrapped his arms around John, sitting on and riding him, they shagging hard with each other. Sherlock's voice was broken, they fucked harder and harder, John pushed Sherlock down to the bed, leant over him and fucked him into the mattress, Sherlock could only gasp under John’s thrustings, cried out helplessly with his broken voice.
Sherlock turned around and found a blonde, blue-eyed young officer with a sunny smile was looking at him with interest.
"The failure of my marriage is not related to Mycroft. After graduated, we have been just ordinary friends and nothing more." Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "Now we only have a connection in work, he is not my direct supervisor, but count as my superior officer. That’s it."
"I was just too arrogant." John suddenly laughed. "Thought that I could do something for my family, could make them happier. I never thought of a twisted fate..."
#              #              #
Sherlock frowned slightly.
“Really? "Sherlock doubted - besides John, Lestrade might be the second person who would praise him in this world.
"Captain Watson, did you miss your fiancee in the UK?" Mycroft was fighting back. "What a pity you can’t stay together during the Chrismas time.”
Rescuers later saved Sherlock from the disaster. After a week's rest, Sherlock returned to his original life, and the German bombing offensive against Britain lasted until May 10, 1941. After another four years, the Second World War officially ended.
"Deal." Sherlock led Adler to turned with him and then stuck together with her again. Adler put her hands around Sherlock's neck, and Sherlock slipped his hands to her hips, they rubbed against each other especially clinging to the sensitive parts of their bodies, the erotic feelings with their dancing steps embarrassed the ladies and gentlemen beside them.
"Back to England? Why?" Sherlock felt a chill.
They stared each other ecstatically, stabbing and lingering together, creating the greatest pleasure of their bodies. This churning rhythm, the taste of sex, it was fascinated. They watched the other one lost control because of him, and then a white light penetrated the front, they all shot on each other's bodies.
"I'm here." Sherlock finally struggling to get free from the blanket, his face reddened as being baked too long, his hair was messy.
John shrugged, "I don’t think it’s any kind of romantic love, having no intense feelings between us, I like her but it’s more like a sibling-like relationship." He picked up the glass, sipped his wine. "Her parents died early, my parents brought her to our home to live with us, they both adore her very much. After she engaged to me, she can stay there taking care of them by my fiancee's identity. Marrying her is more like a promise and a responsibility, and make my parents’ dream come true as they always want a daughter. After all, I leave home all the time, and my bigger brother is a useless drunk, Mary is already their greatest comforted appearing."
Sherlock heard him turn off the lights, turned his back and soon came the snoring.
Does Mary Watson exist after all? Why all her backgrounds and characteristics overlap with someone I knew in the past?
Road scenery along the way back. John kept chatting with Sherlock, like why he knew the political operation of the British government, what his brother was doing here, and how was their relationship and so on. Sherlock just answered casually, but it was almost the first time he had ever said so much to a man who had just met.
John was so excited with his eyes wide opened, could not help but applauded. "It's amazing! Your observation is awesome! Are you going to be a detective after graduated? I need to be your first client!"
"He is Scotland Yard's Detective Inspector Lestrade, he came to asking me for help." Sherlock still could not stop laughing. "He's having an affair with my brother, so no need to be afraid."
John did not know what to say and stayed silent. And Sherlock just let John deal with it on his own the whole time, had not even tried to say a word for him.
John moved closer to Sherlock, fiddling with his curls, caressing his face, stared at him, "Want some more data?"
Sherlock smirked and did not ask Victor again. He knew exactly whom that person was - Victor crushed on him, he knew it since the first day he entered this room. Probably this was why no one in the school was able to endure Sherlock, only Victor could be his roommate and even chatted with him.
Because I got the same feeling, heartache like stabbed by a knife.
Sherlock’s hand retreated and sat up, looking at the window. Then he saw John, who climbed inside from the window - under the moonlight, John looked terrible, deep dark undereye circles, depressed haggard face, an expression of losing hope.
A lovely blonde woman with a medical background, who worked in the same clinic with John and flirted with him, even invaded Baker Street and smart enough to contribute our case investigation.
"We can move in right now." A gloomy desperate male voice sounded as if he was the Grim Reaper, had been back from hell, and every living thing on earth annoyed him - it was this man arguing with Mrs Hudson.
"But Mary shouldn't have done that! She supposed to be your wife, and she knew that you're alive..."
And marijuana was just the beginning of all the addictions.
"Indeed, many soldiers really doing this, but not included me." John smiled and looked at Sherlock, "I don’t use money to buy sex."
Sherlock pushed the door and found it had not be locked.
A clap of thunder, came around as if there was a huge explosion from the distance, but the feeling of vibration was instantly sensed as if very close. Sherlock still trapped by James's body, he vaguely heard the noise of the crowd outside and the thunder of the water, he opened his blurred eyes, found that James was turning around and looking at the flood quickly got in from the small gap of the iron gate.
"Sherlock," John helplessly looked at Sherlock, his eyes watery. "You wouldn't want me... the present me..." He closed his eyes. "I can't even walk without the cane."
John snapped his hand off and turned his face angrily.
"Great, see you tomorrow!" Sherlock was so excited when he left.
"Yes, it's very helpful for my research, a sex experiment."
Sherlock eyed John as if he was not accustomed to accepting appreciation. "You only serve the military, and now is not during a war, there is no special task, you should remain in the barracks. But you are wearing uniforms in the official car, with medical supplies, should be to visit. Based on the local medicine system is relatively backward, in accordance with my understanding of the political operation of the British government, you are invited out for the local important people is the most probably. The so-called important people, the British government has an interest, nothing more than the local dignitaries."
Sherlock silently put the ring on John's ring finger.
"I had intended to cancel the engagement with her." John's face was gloomy.
"What? This..." Mrs Hudson's sentence did not finish yet, Sherlock had left like a whirlwind.
"Captain Watson," Sherlock whispered his deep voice whistling through John's ear, "to go visit nearby?"
"Do you like Chinese food?"
Their hands still held together, and Sherlock could not help but caressing John's hand with his thumb - just like the first time when they shook hands, he copied the action John did to him.
"I want." Sherlock's lips slid down John's body, he was pulling down John's pyjama bottoms. "I love you, no matter how you are..."
John just hugged him, clinging tightly, buried his face into Sherlock's shoulder and swallowing his tears in silence. Sherlock rubbing his back and stared at the ceiling.
Sherlock just not used to it. "You... seem to be very happy. Don't you think you're offended? Don’t want to shut me up?"
Then John brought Sherlock to a Chinese restaurant, ordered a full table of dishes and taught Sherlock how to eat with chopsticks.
Mary Watson in her wedding dress who shot me in my mind palace.
The car had been driven onto the car ferry which bound for the Kowloon Peninsula slowly - It was the opposite route of Sherlock and John’s first met, and the day now turned to the night, their mood also formed a huge contrast with the previous one - the flirtatious chatting now became embarrassing silence, and the curiosity and kindness now only left to be cold and strange.
" Convenient for you?”
＃　　　　　＃　　　　　＃
During these days, Sherlock lived on the streets as a vagrant and met many of the lowest class of London, those beggars, prostitutes and tramps taught him so many things that the orthodox education would not teach him, like how to make a living on his own. As a result, he was now very familiar with how to use human nature to carry out illegal activities. He crosschecked all the things he learnt from the streets and from the books, complemented each other, that enhanced his ability to deduce on crimes. All this was really funny, much funnier than the boring school education, and let Sherlock's brain fully exercised and no longer depressed in boredom - except at some points, during his free time, he could not find a method to prevent John Watson invading into his mind.
During this period, Sherlock temporarily resided in several places, included air-raid shelters, Lestrade's apartment and also some tattered single apartments (driven out by landlords because of failed experiments every time). He completed his chemistry degree in these years, got a part-time job at a chemical laboratory at Barts to earn his living expenses, and continued to act as a consultant detective at Scotland Yard for free, solved many mysteries for the police.
Sherlock opened the door to the living room, Mrs Hudson and the voice's owner looked up at him.
John watched Sherlock disappearing behind the house door, feeling completely fascinated by the mysterious teenager.
"Of course, it's just in private, in public they are just coworker," Sherlock took John's hand and caressing him gently, in a way that suggesting something, "like us, now we can tell others that we're flatmates." Sherlock smiled at John and wishing it would be their future relationship - lovers in private, flatmates in public.
He knew what could help him stop this, stop his noisy brain and overwhelming emotions - drugs.
"I don’t know. A part of reasons I think, I like you too." Sherlock shrugged.
A whole week passed, not received a note from John.
But that was the case in school, would the sex in the society of adults world still that boring? Apart from the low-intelligence peers and hypocritical wily old birds, would there have anyone whose intelligence matching Sherlock, and could play a sex game with him? Would explore other possibilities?
"This is the principle of leverage, it’s clever." Sherlock practised with chopsticks to pick, push, clip, screw, poke and other usages, John was amazed.
John stared at Sherlock closely and fascinating by his enticing green eyes, his fingertips depicting Sherlock's cheekbone. Sherlock never tried to breathe the breath of another person at such a distance, he trembled and closed his eyes. John saw his vibrating eyelashes, the hand on his cheek started shaking.
The following weekend, John and Mary held a simple wedding at the St John's Cathedral, only a few colleagues of John's troop and two to three senior executives participated. Sherlock presented himself, but only as a passer-by and watched the ceremony in a far distance, watching the groom with his bride accepting the blessing of the crowd, watching his John throughout did not show a real smile, and did not look up to Sherlock even once.
All patriotic, honest, healthy men had been gone to the battlefield. Only left the old and weak remnants, cowards or corrupted elites who could not face the turbulent times, seeking methods to escape. Although Sherlock did not reach the legal age to join the army, nor he was a patriotic fanaticism, he still thought he was useless at that moment, when his brother and John were closely related to the battlefield.
"We go back?"
Sherlock eventually returned to the dormitory alone, gave a proper space to John and Mary to deal with their problems - especially now involved with infidelity, unmarried pregnancy and premarital sex, all were taboos in the society, were very private things, and happened to a girl, so it was unsuitable to involve an outsider such as Sherlock.
He said I killed his other half.
This is an old problem.
He pushed the door, returned to the dark room, did not want to turn on the lights, just lying back to his bed quietly.
Lestrade slumped looked at Sherlock, did not want to admit it but could not deny either, just felt so tired.
Sherlock just gave an indifference sound and looked back to the water, as if the conversation is boring.
It was not the first time that Sherlock encountered this kind of things. In the past, he was extremely disgusted with such activities, only found it unclean and dirty, thought it was a beast-styled unwise behavior. He would wash quickly and sharp left at the time, as he had no interest eavesdropping someone else private affairs. But today, he looked down at himself and found he half- erected.
After recorded the progress of the experiment, Sherlock climbed back to the bed, his fingers lingering caressed John's clavicle and chest, his lips hang around John’s cheeks, nose, tongue and lips, John just half-awake and responded lazily. They were already familiar with each other's body, habits and preferences. Sherlock slid on top and rode his lover, leant over and kissed him, let their bodies softly rubbed against each other. John clenched Sherlock's lovely buttocks, caressing and feeling it. After a few french kisses, Sherlock sat up and slowly sank his body, let his opening wrapped around John’s cock, John groaned with his eyes closed, but then insisted on opening his eyes so he could watch Sherlock, admiring him to fuck himself by John’s cock, slowly and indulgent. John liked to see Sherlock moaned because of him, liked to touch the sweaty body which silvering because of sex, liked to use his palms to slide on Sherlock’s skin when he concentrated fucking himself, liked to depict his body’s curves and textures.
How could you just fell into the deep sleep, and leave me awake?
"I like to be your flatmate." John swallowed and looked away. "But I don't want to continue that kind of relationship now, do you understand?" His voice was fading and trembling slightly.
Mycroft and Mrs Holmes were very happy with this development and jointly decided that they would return to London ahead of schedule. Thus Sherlock would leave soon.
The annoying air-raid siren seems endless. It might pause occasionally, but when the living got back to normal just few days, the siren would ring again and pushed the crowd stuffing back to the shelter.
When Sherlock's chest still undulating and panting, the car came to a halt - at the front of the school dormitory.
“Interesting.” that person turning the book pages, said with a creepy tone, "Hi, I'm James, the same university with you, major in Maths." he turned to stare at Sherlock, with two big and childlike eyeballs.
Mrs Holmes angrily glanced at the frowned Mycroft. And John clenched his fists and bit his lower lip, deadly stared at Sherlock as if he wanted to burn holes on his body by his anger.
"What's up?" Lestrade was unfastening his tie, an unknowing innocent.
"We can pay you a deposit first," the depressed voice replied.
Without the most ridiculous bastard's intellectual sarcasm, my birthday is not the same.
Your heartbeat stopped for a while.
John looked at Sherlock with surprise.
Sherlock nodded slightly. John could not help but reach out into the lovely messy curls, caressing unstoppable.
Maybe being overwhelming by emotions is much easier than defeating by the desperately rational.
Rio put his clothes on and accepted the money, "thank you," he kissed his partner, "call me next time!" he winked at Victor, left the room and closed the door.
Sherlock looked around, finding there was a double-sized bed in the middle of the room, and some simple items of furniture were putting around, the setting just like a hotel room, but more simple. And the place was dark, the sunlight was blocked by the curtains.
"What happened to Mary and the baby?"
"If his family knew about it, how sad they would be? They sent him here to learn, not to selling his body, right?" Victor still murmured sadly, then squatted down to help Sherlock picking his things up and put them back to places.
Miss your voice when you made fun of me.
Mary Watson.
#              #              #
After both of them washed, they lay in the bed again, only covered with a thin sheet, bodies were still naked.
And the fictional Abominable Bride - why with a gun? Why wearing a wedding dress? Why is her image overlapping with Mary Watson in my mind palace? Why did I finally find out that the "bride" was played by multiple women?
"What?" Sherlock stunned.
Sherlock blamed Mrs Hudson with a glance.
John rushed to climb on him and kissed him bitterly, Sherlock endured it with his wide-opened eyes, only unresponsive under the invasion of John’s tongue, completely indifferent. At the end, John could only hug him desperately, used his whole body's energy to imprison him.
Finally, John seemed to be calm down, he wiped his face with his own hand, sucked his nose, pretended nothing happened. Then he looked up to Sherlock, stroking his face, made a plea in a gentle voice, "Would you run away with me? We leave here, go to a place that no one knows us and have a new start - just you and me... "
Sherlock holding the door handle, was about to enter the house, but was disturbed by the horn. He turned and saw the black car was parked outside the fence, the man's silhouette showed on the window gauze,.
"You found him doing business in the toilet?"
However, Sherlock remembered his indifference towards sex. A boarding school was a place which full of young flesh and sexual temptations, it was difficult for adolescents to control themselves. Sherlock felt like he was strolling in the Wildlife Park in everyday lives, seeing the boys became primitive animal beasts which just let the instinct blindly drove them - a bunch of simple-minded idiots that let the hormones dominating their mind, let the lower part of their bodies ruling their heads - that’s why he had been extremely disdained for sex. He concerned his rational mind as his playground where was more interesting than many things in the world.
When I read you these little stories by your bedside, I saw your lip curled. Did you find it amusing when you heard the "sparks" between you and Molly or even Moriarty?
Sherlock shocked that James knew about him and what he liked. "You are... James? How could you..."
"I was so stupid! if I want a prostitute, money can buy it!"
"Yes, I just met an old friend who is looking for a flatmate."
Sherlock sneered, turned back, ignored Victor. A thought was rising on his mind - could make the family sad? It would be a lot of fun - could he have a chance to sell his body, to provoke Mycroft? Sherlock was so excited with the idea running through his mind that could make Mycroft furious, he was so eager to try.
Marry Watson, also my most longed dream, a dream that I dare not to imagine, that even at a fictional wedding banquet, I only dare to be his best man although wearing the groom's costume standing next to him.
Sherlock stared at the distance, mouth like a machine gun when answered him, “You arrived here about a year ago, stationed in the Victoria barracks, is a military doctor. You just went to the Kowloon Peninsula for the local dignitaries visit. It was not your job, but by political reasons, the task was pressured down by your superior, and the patient was extremely troublesome, that’s why you are now full of grievances." Just glanced at the officer's expression, Sherlock satirically smirked and looked away.
"You go first. I’ll be right behind."
Sherlock felt inexplicable - he was never easy to make friends or to be said that he did not have friends - but John was a total stranger who tried to talk to him, and Sherlock did not feel disgusted with it.
"Your apartment recently greeted some British ladies, one or two?" Sherlock eyed the luxury silk stockings which be left in the sofa gap, and then glimpsed the lipstick sticking on the cigarette butts which laying in the ashtray, "Silk stockings belonged to a smoking woman? Or the smoking one is another lady?"
John slumped looked at him. Sherlock gripped John's hand and guided it to the top button of his pyjamas, just as their first time. John was fascinated looking at him, unlocked his buttons one by one, removing his pyjamas, trembled stroked his chest and sensitive pink nipples softly. Sherlock looking at John shook and breathing up quickly.
＃　　　　　＃　　　　　＃
"The same," John said quietly.
Sherlock looked through the clear water and found James. James looked at Sherlock with his eyes wide-opened, his face indignant, but remained a deserted calm underwater. He was like a beautiful specimen, an evil and pretty black spider specimen, was quietly nailed to the ground, slightly shaking with the moving water, as if dancing.
"I can’t." John turned round. "You have no experience at all, and you are too young... I..." He closed his eyes.
Sherlock pushed his hand off and looked at his eyes. "Don’t worry about me, I mean it..."
#              #              #
Sherlock had been thought that they might have a semester of time before saying goodbye, but it seemed that this winter holiday was their end.
"It doesn't matter, I'll find a flatmate as soon as possible!" Sherlock remembered Mike's suggestion and replied perfunctory to Mrs Hudson who was suspicious, decided to find a solution later. "I can pay my half rent first, in a few days I'll find my new flatmate, then he can pay his half!"
They got off, then walked for awhile, here was not so crowded, feeling much better.
#              #              #
Terrible shouts destroyed the quiet night. Accompanied by screams and struggles from hell, there were some painful moaning and nonsense from dreams.
"Enjoy being tied and hit?" Victor could not imagine. "For this kind of thing, shouldn’t wait until we meet the right person, and only do it with that person?"
No matter how the thunder and lightning striking outside, Sherlock was determined to go to the appointment, even when the umbrella had been blowing away from his hands, even when his whole body had been soaked.
Their situation was exactly like this - such a mess.
#              #              #
"What?" Sherlock suddenly remembered the letter that John wrote to Mary to get rid of their engagement - if John had not destroyed it before he got married... "She discovered the letter?"
Sherlock forced the moistening fog to stop, he looked up at the ceiling, hoping those tears would flow back to his eyes. Then he found that John had been slightly trembling, and his chest was wet - John was crying.
People always have a type.
He closed his eyes, put his hand on his lap, and redid how John touching him, feeling more intense. An unfamiliar desire arose spontaneously, the temperature was raising, a lust he never experienced dried his mouth. He let go of his hand, bursting with fear, afraid that he would be out of control just like those animal-like peers. He hesitated, to revenge on Mycroft, he should try this pleasure of indulgence?
"What price did my brother offer you, I'll give you double." Sherlock said to her neck, looked like he was kissing her.
#              #              #
You jumped in front of my eyes must be a part of the plan.
"Are you now a private detective? Why Scotland Yard would find you for help?"
I know it must be a trick or you just found a good solution but couldn't tell me.
I love you - Sherlock knew that John was saying goodbye.
Sherlock was shocked, he never thought of that his John might be unable to come back from this, and at the same time he could totally felt his parents' pain - if he had received the notice of John's death, he could not imagine how would him become, would he lost his courage to live...
"Just want to add a little spice. Let's try once for warming up, otherwise, how could you know which part you'll miss me most when we separate?" Sherlock felt that James's tongue slid over him again, those hands climbed on him and undid his buttons one by one...
"It doesn’t matter, let's have a look."
"Hey!" Sherlock struggled - John would not bite him! But... the gentle hands, which good at caressing, was back. John was the veteran who knew the art of touch. Sherlock closed his eyes to enjoy it, John would touch him in this gentle and seductive way, stroked his whole body and wandered the source of his desire...
"Nothing." Sherlock just turned his eyes and staring at the ceiling.
James who danced for the puzzles.
"A bit weird."
If that's John's image in my mind... Why did he become a "widow"? Who's dead?
"I don’t know. Not enough data to analyse."
"Pain?" John naked squatted on the ground, asked while wiping Sherlock's lower body.
"Of course, they were just playing pretend, they still kept their trousers, and not too many new students willing to do it, mostly would rather losing the game and being punished for doing a push-up.” Victor hurried to explain, paused. "But there was a new student called Rio who was really crazy, nearly crossed the line, and he so enjoyed." Victor blushed. “The senior who was sipped and licked by him, face gone red and panting, trousers went wet on the front. Rio still hadn’t stopped at that point and even unbuttoned the senior’s trousers. Fortunately, it was timely to stop, he did not touch the zipper and pull it down."
Lestrade sat down helplessly, covered his face with his hands.
"I..." John's lips quivered.
Sherlock met Lestrade could be by pure chance, but it could also be inevitable. Sherlock’s extraordinary deduction skills had been famous among the vagrants, different street people came to seek help from him, as a reward, Sherlock asked his clients to provide information to him as the Homeless Network. That was why Sherlock could know where had a crime just happened in the district with the first-hand information, so he could rush to the crime scene and observe the clues before the police had cleaned up everything. As a result, Sherlock became a regular visitor to the crime scenes, he always bluntly ridiculed those police officers as complete idiots and pointed out the obviously huge amount of evidence that they totally missed. Most officers ignored him, not violently drove him out would be counted as good temper. Excepted one, the Inspector Lestrade, he treated Sherlock with an unusual patience, and would even listen to him to change the direction of the investigation.
Panting and groaning - it was too obvious to Sherlock now, that what kind of things these noises meant to be.
"You know, you will miss this," John said while smoking.
"John... " beside those endless kisses, Sherlock used his hands to touch and caress John, plus the friction their body rolling against each other, he needed to turn John Watson on.
Sherlock asked Mrs Hudson if he could move in immediately and decided to go straight to Barts to retrieve his luggage. However, in discussing the rent, Sherlock found that even though Mrs Hudson offered a great discount, it was still too expensive for him to rent it on his own in his current economic climate.
In the following week, they almost had not left the apartment, or more specifically, their bed. School holidays were already started, Sherlock no needed to go to school. During this period, John only left to report his duties in the army twice, the rest of the New Year holidays were spent with Sherlock.
Sherlock was lost in Mycroft’s questions, he suddenly felt thoroughly ashamed of himself - Mycroft was to the point, he surrendered to his lower body now, doing nothing all day long but sex, his mind was wasted. At first, he thought this kind of rebellion could provoke Mycroft and got his revenge on him. But his over-indulgence in it now had long been beyond a mischief, wanting to humiliate others, but the result was just more to be ashamed, Sherlock now reduced as a sex addict, even lost himself for the game.
They went into the market crowd.
He blamed me this time and said it was my fault.
In the following few days, Sherlock always gazed to the railing side when passing by. Every time a car appeared, he caught a glimpse but never was the black car that carrying the significant one.
"Are you confusing to be or not to be Mary's husband?" Sherlock still laughing, "You can choose, no one stops you. You never loved her, why be engaged with her? Her baby is not yours, why should you marry her? If all of this has nothing to do with love, why would it confusing you?”
That night, Sherlock stole back to the school dormitory, lying down without changing clothes, pretended to fell asleep when Victor spoke with him. Nevertheless, he could not sleep at all, his stomach aching with a strange twisted feeling, it was weird, he was never like this before.
John stared at him angrily, his chin strained.
Sherlock was hooked on this psychedelic feeling, which allowed his mind to relax, not thought about John.
John released inside Sherlock's body with a moo, and then fell down on Sherlock’s back, calming his breathing and anger. When John pulled himself out, Sherlock could not help but hiss painfully. John lowered his head to see the swollen wound made by his anger, his stomach twisted of aches, he stroked gently around it with his fingers, and Sherlock trembled with pain.
Killing you is equal to killing me.
Sherlock caressed his back as if doing so would heal a little John's wounds.
"They like the lively atmosphere." John grinned and lowered his voice, "We just exchanged our bodily fluids, would you mind eating my saliva?" He picked a piece of chicken to Sherlock's bowl.
＃　　　　　＃　　　　　＃
"I am so honoured to be classified to the non-boring part." John smiled and moved a little bit closer, stroking Sherlock's arm. "So you think sex is interesting or boring?"
John glared at the laughing Sherlock, his face wrinkled bitterly.
Sherlock's eyelids did not lift as if Victor was transparent.
Then John turned and lay beside Sherlock, falling into sleep as exhausted. Sherlock lay soberly and still dealing with the massive information that squeezed into his head. Those stimulating sensory reactions needed to be categorised and saved into his mind palace. He made a catalogue called "sex" for these materials, he glanced John and then changed the name to "sex with John".
Soon after Sherlock followed his family back to London, Britain officially declared war on Germany, the shadow of the world war shrouded throughout Europe, Mycroft was ridden by the country after that, he was so busy that could be away from home for months, and had no time to take care of his little brother. Mrs Holmes required her little son went to the countryside of Sussex with her to escape the war, but Sherlock could not tolerate the boring country life, slipped back to London alone on the way, and began his vagrant life in the following months.
One day they did not confess, one day they could still pretend, and kept the improper relationship as a game, easy to deal with. But when the confession was told, which meant that they had to face this relationship seriously - to choose between went together or separated. Frankly, it could only have one outcome, because living in this era, living in such a society, they could not go together as lovers.
"I've loved you since the first time you kissed me, the first you entered me." Sherlock kissing John's neck while his hands slid into his pyjamas. "I like to be possessed by you, and I like to possess you too." His prick kept rubbing John's private part until he felt their erections both hard enough while pressing against each other. "But more than that, I love not only your body but the whole you."
Sherlock did not understand, repeatedly thinking about John's words - "I don't want to continue that kind of relationship now", "You knew about the letter...", "a relationship without love doesn't work"... "without love"... The premise was: John had told Sherlock he love him, but Sherlock never made the same declaration; John did not know that Sherlock had read the letter, but if Sherlock had known that before Mary appeared, that John was willing to cancel the engagement for him but still had not said a word, John would have thought that it was because Sherlock did not agree with John's decision; John had proposed to run away with Sherlock after Mary appeared, Sherlock rejected him; on the contrary, Sherlock proposed that they could continue the sexual relationship, saying that's no big deal... Deduction: John thought that Sherlock did not love him, that was why he agreed him marrying Mary; John thought that Sherlock only wanted a sexual relationship, no matter in the past or this moment he kept the same mind; "that kind of relationship" that John did not want to continue was a purely sexual relationship; John still had feelings for Sherlock, that was why he still wanted to keep the hug even though it broke his previous decision... Conclusion: "The same" meant "a relationship without love" - John on the premise that he did not love Mary and Sherlock did not love him, and John's premise is wrong.
Besides no one was here, it had nothing else left.
They just naked laid in the mess, thirsting for the salvation of oxygen, no one could say a word for a long time.
"Gather a family reunion for Christmas is quite normal," Mycroft said it like announcing a national policy by the government bureau.
It was the song which played on the Christmas day, the song that he danced with John.
Sherlock just froze here, could not move in a while.
In the middle of the night, Sherlock was secretly reading a thick volume under the moonlight, by the dormitory windowsill - he was studying the Annals of Crime Archives, the cases he recently studying was all about murders involved love.
"Don’t comment your brother in this way!" Lestrade was suddenly furious, grabbed a vase to throw on the ground. The vase was broken into pieces. "It’s not like that, Mycroft is not like that!"
#              #              #
John like a suffocated person needed Sherlock's lips like needing oxygen, so he just kept irresistibly touching it - but John kept his lips closed and forced himself to push away from Sherlock's passionate kiss at last.
John stared at him hesitantly, slowly approached him while studying his mind. Sherlock did not retreat a single pace, even took a step forward when John stopped.
This day, Sherlock came to the shower at non-peak hours as usual - he just did not like the crowding during the rush hour, the lack of privacy was unbearable and disgusting.
Near the end of the dinner party, the waiter was serving drinks, the lights turned dimmer, some people began to dance on the dance floor.
James's voice was just like a lullaby that totally controlled and attracted Sherlock, cursed him to be a softie, and he had presented a seemingly interesting future blueprint that made Sherlock's boring life have a little bit fun...
"Why can you say that so calmly?"
"You just arrive, don’t know what happened last week." Victor’s voice trembled. "Last week, there was a freshmen orientation party. You know those senior students had been very crazy, this year was very outrageous - they even... told those freshmen... to blow... their..."
"Because it is the first time? Or because of being penetrated?"
Until the footsteps came from downstairs, they came fast.
Sherlock looked at his extended hand a little bit surprised, hesitated for a while before shaking. "Sherlock Holmes. I never guess, I deduce."
Mary just hid her face in hands and shook.
The car then drove into the urban areas, streets gradually bustling, the noisy crowd just coming and going busily.
After that day, Victor did not talk to Sherlock ever again, nor gave him a look. Soon after, he applied successfully to transfer to another room. Sherlock finally lost the only one who was willing to talk to him in school, left only on his own.
"May I?" Sherlock's voice revealed his desire. John could see from his eyes that how much Sherlock wanted to have him, the eagerness was so hot that just could burn anything, it made John’s knees trembling and dried his throat.
James looked at the corner, where the spider web became thicker and thicker, and a black big spider was crawling on it. "A network that is still in an expansion, which connected to all the smart people, can you imagine how interesting it is?" His hand climbed on Sherlock's back again silently.
"Oh, it's so late, I'll leave you two here then," Mrs Hudson said hastily. "I still have the stuff to do."
"John~ " Sherlock still touching his thigh, "You can have casual sex while you’re engaged, why can’t you do the same after married?" He touched John's rounded ass and rubbed it. "Before I leave, we can still do it." His hand wrapped around John's cock and kissed his shoulder.
"Sherlock? Where're you?" a man's voice sounded.
They went along the school fence, intended to sneak away from the back door, otherwise, they would need to fill in an application form and it caused so much trouble. Sherlock stared at the fence as if he had been offended by the rails - yes, the damned Captain Watson hadn’t been hearing for almost a week.
"I am the network." James's hand continued to linger behind Sherlock. "If you join, we'll become the brain of the network. We can make fun of those stupid people as playing a nest of ants, how fun that would be?" He came closer to Sherlock's neck, smelt his smell. "We'll come up with a lot of great ideas, to play with the idiots of Scotland Yard, so much fun."
Sherlock wanted to help in this situation, he got to the doorway and carried Mary's luggage inside, then he stood aside did not know what to do.
John covered them with blanket immediately, then he showed a protecting gesture in front of Sherlock.
Sherlock was a little bit absent - too much, it’s too much of a sudden. He did not know where he is, now what to do - as if this is not a deal? John borrowed Sherlock’s body to meet his sexual needs, he borrowed John's body to do sex experiments, this was fine, this was fair, easy to deal with. But now, what were they doing now?
"What are you trying to imply? We’re really just friends."
"It’s my fault." Lestrade slumped to admit. "I didn’t give her enough love. When a woman can’t get love from her man, she could only find it outside.’
Ah, Mary.
Sherlock smiled and was glad to be back to London soon - that was a funny place. Although he travelled with his brother since he was a little child, running across most of the earth, he’s favourite and most familiar place was always London. It was a lively city, full of things that made Sherlock never bored.
Lestrade sighed helplessly. "So are you coming?"
"Mrs Hudson, we'll be sharing 221b," Sherlock told Mrs Hudson. "Please prepare a lease for us."
Sherlock had a headache and started a little dizzy - what if that weird smell did not come from the aftershave, but a drug...
Heat climbed up his cheeks, neck and upper body, he felt that he must now be covered with redness. But all could not compare to the trembly feeling from his lower body that made him feel so helpless.
"You shagging with me, just to collect data?"
In the dim light, with the lyrical music, Sherlock pressed against Adler with no distance between their bodies in the dance, Adler wanted to break free from him, but Sherlock hugged her very tightly.
Is Mary Watson an enemy or a friend? She shot me at my heart, but end up was shot dead by the bullet which aimed at me...
Sherlock received the hot tea that had just been made by John, sipped silently.
"Will your roommate expose us?" Rio whispered.
Is he waiting for me? Sherlock stopped, confused.
"Mrs Hudson!" Sherlock growled.
#              #              #
"Don’t." Sherlock opened his eyes. "I'd rather you don’t love me." He gripped John's hand and guided it to the top button of his shirt.
"Next time I will visit your new home with Scotland Yard's drugs squad!" the man was standing behind the door now, the door handle being turned.
"It’s so boring. Right?” James glanced at the door as if to know what Sherlock was thinking, his big eyes turned, with an ambiguous strange smile, "Sherlock Holmes, of the Department of Chemistry. There is no puzzle that could make you dance... "
"Yes." sleepy Sherlock looked at Miss Woodhouse and confusing where he was.
I am at Baker Street, just watched the DVD again, which you recorded for my birthday last year.
＃　　　　　＃　　　　　＃
Lestrade was startled, glared at Sherlock with open mouth, and then looked at John again.
When John and Sherlock left, it was so late that already no transports could get back to Hong Kong Island, so they went to a nearby hotel. John violently grabbed Sherlock’s hand and pulled him into the small room, they had not talked since the dinner finished, John locked the door, and brutally threw Sherlock into the bed. Sherlock just snorted, avoided to look at John.
I don't quite like Dr Magnussen and the night-shift nurse who named Janine.
Sherlock cuddled John from behind, pressing tightly against him, hoping John would be warmed by his body heat. "What happened to you?"
"Don’t worry, I won’t invite you to dance in front of my family." Sherlock's deep voice whispered softly into John's ear, provoking the air that made him trembling. "But you lied, you said you never buying sex."
The Holmes family were on board with luggage, even Mycroft decided to withdraw from Hong Kong and returning to London. Since then, Sherlock would have no slightest linkage with this place, even he wanted to find someone to pass a message from him, there would be no one.
"Is here the place where the soldiers like to hang around?" Sherlock stared at the flirtatious ladies they saw frequently on the way and those obscene men who had been around them. "I see, here is Shek Tong Tsui."
The phonograph was playing a slow dance, John and Sherlock snuggling together, dancing barefoot. John was so intoxicated, very satisfied with the arrangement of this two people’s Christmas Ball.
#              #              #
"Yup, you said you don’t buy sex. But why the ladies in Shek Tong Tsui is allowed to do business openly, no one blamed them; while this boy can only go into hiding and do it secretly? Why can’t he do his business as open as the women?”
"It's me." Lestrade's shoulders collapsed. "I couldn’t live up to him." He slumped down again and buried his face in his hands. "I like women too. I thought my life would be easier if I chose the road with a woman." He looked at Sherlock. "So I chose that."
There would be a war? So John would go to the battlefield? The first thing Sherlock could think of was John making him more angry with himself.
The dead blonde in A Study in Pink.
When she reached the door, Mrs Hudson looked back hesitantly, "you two can find me if have any problem, anytime is okay!" she finally hurried downstairs when Sherlock glared at her.
"But eating like this, the food must be chopped into small pieces." Look around at other tables, Sherlock added, "Chinese used to share foods like this? Is it hygienic to share foods from the same dishes?”
Sherlock pouted and went back to the dorm, just wanted to kill Mycroft and Victor a thousand times in his mind. He wanted himself focus to be angry and kept cursing those two bastards, then he would have no time to think about John, to think about the chaotic and unlawful relationship they were having, to imagine they would part in a near future.
"As always, your grades are the best of the class." Miss Woodhouse looked at Sherlock with great excitement, returning the last week's test paper to him, still revelling in the fantasy of vanity that the good performance of Sherlock was a result of being her student. It was such a relief for Victor that Sherlock had not been punished anyway.
James went closer to Sherlock, one arm holding his waist, one hand stroking his chest, stroking his sensitive nipples underneath the thin shirt cloth. His lips lingering slid down Sherlock's shoulder and neck, and the warm moisture of his mouth wandered around Sherlock's ear.
"really?" Sherlock doubted.
As dusk fell, Sherlock walked back to the dormitory, on the way he casually glancing towards to the fence, did not see the car.
"That's......" The officer could not find a word but stared at Sherlock. "Amazing!"
#              #              #
Sherlock had no choice but moved his baggage to Barts temporarily. He stayed in the laboratory at night, and take the opportunity to make good use of the facilities there for overnight study. When he tired, he lay on the table to rest. After a lapse of one week in such a rush, he still had not found a new budget home - there were limited cheap single apartments nearby, and most had blacklisted Sherlock. If he could afford to pay for bigger houses which for two or four residents, he would have a lot more choices, but it seemed too extravagant for Sherlock.
Sherlock imagined his own voice during sex, was it as nasty as him - he felt creepy.
"I am sorry……"
“Yup. Rio was in the Vice-Chancellor’s Office, doing the thing with the Vice-Chancellor!” Victor's cheeks flushed with agitation, his eyes wide opened. "I stood on a table, peeped in the small window on the top of the room, saw the Vice-Chancellor still wearing his suit, but slipped off his pants, lying on the back of Rio and vigorously shagging him. Rio's shirt was pushed to the shoulder, pants by his ankles, his hands tied by his own tie, the whole body was pushed violently on the desk by the Vice-Chancellor. The Vice-Chancellor  hold a long wooden ruler by the other hand." He shrank a bit. "Rio's legs and butt were full of red marks. Just thought about it, I feel pain!"
"Then you are a soldier who has just retired from overseas? A national hero!" Mrs Hudson clapped hands excitedly.
Sherlock stared at John.
"British?" A long absence of the British accent.
John was here. He was inside the car, looking at Sherlock far away.
"Do you really not care about that the rest of my life will be tied to another woman and sleep with her on one bed?"
Sherlock looked at John with his smiling eyes, watched the warmth in John's eyes fading away, and then John pulled back from their connection and looked aside.
"Sherlock." John did not know what was so funny - they had just been broken the law and caught by the police. "Who's he? Why's he looking for you?"
Sherlock coughed for the uncomfortable situation. "I think I'd better leave..." he reached for the door.
Finally, they reached a consensus - Sherlock got to be a university student, and being the Scotland Yard’s "Consulting Detective" at free time, a job title that created by Sherlock. During the war, Sherlock could stay in Lestrade's apartment, as his wife had gone to the countryside to escape the war, a solitary man was easy to find spare space for a housemate, Lestrade could use this opportunity to monitor Sherlock and not let him back to the drugs.
Sherlock gave up to please his only brother a long time ago. On the contrary, he did anything Mycroft banned, the more Mycroft did not want him to do the more he wanted to do it. Mycroft was completely enraged and thought himself incapacitated to teach Sherlock anymore. He sent Sherlock to the most stringent boarding school, hoping that the strict discipline would tame the unruly Mustang.
"No," John turned around, glanced at him and then looked down again. "It's just me, and someone else who wants to rent an apartment too."
"We have another guest." Mycroft looked at the doorway. "Oh, just mentioned her and she’s come.” they followed Mycroft's line of sight, saw a dressed up lady was coming, went straight to Mycroft and smiled to everyone.
Sherlock just left the hateful papers on the desk, made a gesture that looked like he was holding his head to pretend to look down, and then sunk into the sweet dreams.
"Well, I’m glad that you finally made a ‘friend’. I thought your ‘friend’ Captain Watson would be too pathetic celebrating Christmas alone in a foreign land, so I invited him to participate in our dinner, I hope it won’t make you feel presumptuous."
"You really want to do it?"
Hong Kong was a hot and humid place, often had storms, and it was really not a good time to had it now - in the evening which Sherlock and John made an appointment.
James left Sherlock, let him be flooded by the coming water. Sherlock nearly lost consciousness, only felt be surrounded by the cold water, floating around. The cold water made him suddenly awake, he was so weak that even unable to swim, just tried to keep his body soft so could keep himself floating, and beware to avoid obstacles or sink to the bottom of the water.
For a moment, Sherlock wanted so much to join John, to lie with him, to act as this was not bullshit, to pretend it was a viable option. But he smiled weakly and looked at John shook, "no."
He told himself, everything was over, that was very good, this period’s experience would be very useful for his future life. But this experience also was an overload for him, he did not want to run through such a thing ever again, ended it up early was good, saved the time to be upset and wasted. It was just a game, like his brother said, no needed to be serious.
Here is your home. The hospital is not.
"She didn't go to the countryside to escape the war, she eloped with her secret lover."
Seemingly, Mary just found that there was another person in the room, stunned, and then so frightened that she needed to hide behind John. "Ah, you have a friend here? Sorry, I don’t know..."
"Ha, where is my eloquent brother gone? You used to say that your great brain was for doing great things, I just know that surrendered to your lower body is such a great thing?"
"You have chosen, or you will not be so painful," Sherlock said lightly and looked away.
"Listen, Sherlock." John kept looking aside but now finally glanced at Sherlock. "I'm glad to see you again, really." He smiled slightly and looked into Sherlock's eyes. "I'm really gratified that you are safe and sound."
They stared at each other, not willing to turn the eye. John struggled to crush slowly into Sherlock’s virgin opening, it was tight, and he could feel every contraction inside his body. Sherlock could only try to hold John’s back, stroking his arm, and stretching his legs as wide as possible, he had no effort to do other things.
"Aren't you hiding from me that you're back to those habits?" sounded getting closer and closer.
Did the “lover” mean Sherlock? Sherlock was blank in mind. When John turned his back in sleep, Sherlock quickly put the letter back to the envelope and put the envelope back.
#              #              #
To find a flatmate was such a hard thing for Sherlock, but now even that could be settled down so quickly, Sherlock began to believe that God was finally blessing him.
"John Watson." John smiled for the first time, reaching out to Sherlock.
Sherlock nodded.
Sherlock suddenly felt a little bit hot, dared not look at John, turned around and looked out the window.
I received a wedding invitation from Clara, and the wedding will be held in a small, intimate manor. It reminded me of her unhappy marriage with Harry. Their marriage also began with a bright and warm wedding. I was Harry's best man and attended the wedding with a sad smile, as I just broken up with my ex-commander in the army.
The sky was grey and drizzling.
"Glad to meet you, Inspector." John shook hand with him with an awkward, cautious look.
"Bye." Sherlock's voice did not reveal the slightest emotion. He turned to the dormitory doorway, did not turn around ever again.
"Hadn’t tried."
"They're fine. Mary married a British Chinese soldier with her baby and now has a good life in Hong Kong."
Perhaps the most insulting part was that the law equated the sodomy with the bestiality, said that those crimes were equally evil.
"No, this is the first time." Sherlock shrugged as it was not a big deal.
It was this man, John Watson, who brought the sex experience to Sherlock - a brand new experience. Sherlock lowered his head and examined himself, he found John's sperm flowing out slowly from his opening, when he poked it with his finger it flowed out more, but still remained many inside. And the strange feeling of fullness was still here, but the feeling of emptiness after John's departure seemed weirder to Sherlock. He did not find how could it related to his heart, it was clear that there was no direct connection, but his heart felt weird and seemed to be missing something, and it seemed something had changed. When he finished studying himself, he started to study John, carefully looking at the naked man lying beside him, remembering every detail of his body, observing his every hair and every slightly breathing change.
Sherlock snorted.
"Will you go back to England, too?"
"Well, could I skip the secondary school if I go to the university?"
Sherlock felt hugged tightly by someone, which could clearly felt someone's hard erection was sliding against his own. They were both hard and were looking for comfort in the friction.
John withdrew his fingers and pushed his cock into the small hole that he was dreaming of. They stared at each other, fascinated by their lovers’ throbbing expressions, panting together, sweating together, pressed against each other’s naked skins, hearing each other's heartbeats, and let the connected bodies part pounding a breathtaking rhythm.
Sherlock smirked, "Funny."
Waited for an hour and another hour, until the storm stopped, dawn was breaking.
Mary just shook and sobbed.
Sherlock could not figure out what his brother was trying to say.
#              #              #
"How do you know?" The officer asked.
Sherlock found a backup engine room in the depth of the tube station, allowing him to stay alone quietly. All day with a bunch of bored people crowded together, he simply felt him reached an unprecedented limit of disgust about human’s stupidity.
"With your brother?" John's face was even more horrified than had been caught by the police, and Sherlock just laughed out loud.
* We returned to Sherlock's mind palace from this chapter.
"Hello, I'm the flatmate he's going to introduce to you." Sherlock reached out his hand. "Sherlock Holmes."
Sherlock came to Baker Street and standing in front of the door with his luggage, frowned when he glimpsed the "for rent" sign still hanging, thinking he should ask Mrs Hudson to remove it immediately. He knocked on the door knocker at 221b impatiently, but no one responded.
"Mary is not infidelity to you, you said she is a good girl, would not have pre-marital sex, so she was forced to do it, otherwise she would not have the dignity to see you." Sherlock expressionlessly deduced, "Thus, she had been raped."
Who's the abominable bride with a gun? Mary Watson.
"Oh," Sherlock was reluctant to get up and get dress.
There were many mirrors and reflections.
"You had an extramarital affair first, that person existed before you married her - or to be said, your wife is the extra person in your relationship, you in love with that person first.”
Sherlock awoke in his sleep and found John's straw-coloured hair was rubbing his jaw. God, they were snuggling together - Sherlock hugging John tight, one leg resting between John's, and John's face buried under Sherlock's chest, his hand just resting on Sherlock's waist.
"Actually he should thank for me, that I was the one who gave them a chance to make it up." Sherlock looked so proud. "They got together in secondary school, but then broke up and became colleagues later, and often met to exchange information about me. Last year, Lestrade the idiot finally got divorced with his so-called wife, and be my brother's lover again."
"Um," Lestrade's voice showed that he did not believe a bit, but he did not argue with them. He only told Sherlock, "A new case. You go downstairs to me when you get dressed." then he left and closed the door.
That was it. With Mycroft’s help, they could live in the Family Dormitory for married military personnel immediately. Everything was fine. Sherlock turned around and walked away, there was no business for him.
"Your marriage has had a problem since the beginning."
The puff of one student reminded him of John Watson. He began to fantasize that the moaning one is himself. Behind the shower curtain, hugged doing the ulterior affair, he and John Watson.
John was under him with a red face, voicing out an erotic sound caused by his thrusting, Sherlock saw the vulnerable John the first time, through John's eyes he saw the fragility of his soul - for preventing Sherlock's wound worsened, during this period, John let Sherlock be the top, which made Sherlock see a different scenery, he saw the predator John Watson’s weak side. John was not always omniscient, always the experienced one, in the field of sex he might be, but in the emotional field, he was easily injured, he would be afraid and at a loss.
They tried naked swimming in the middle of the night at the Repulse Bay, surrounding by gentle waters under the moonlight, limbs intertwined with water caressing, kissing passionately. After they landed, they snuggled down into the boat on the beach, making out inside the narrow hull. Then they were found by some nosy visitors. They rushed to run away from the scoldings, still naked with full hands of clothes, kept running until they found a corner of the wall where could hide them perfectly, then they burst out laughing. After that, they hid in the dressing room to continue making out. John held Sherlock up with his strong arms and entered him from below. Sherlock could only hold on to the wall behind him and let John kept thrusting inside his body, and John had to shut Sherlock's mouth with his hand to prevent his cries would attract the attention of passers-bys again. They both loved this exciting experience.
"Both maybe, and counting my mother," Sherlock kissed her violently, in the middle of the dance floor, kept kissing while dancing with her.
"Who knows?" Mike shrugged his shoulders and smiled, dimples appeared on his round face. "The world is so big, there must be someone who can get along with you." Then he pushed the door and left.
They reached their climaxes through the fierce shagging. Sherlock could not do anything but laid on the ground with his chest undulating. John still wanting more, he kissed Sherlock's mouth, sucked his neck where he could sense the strong pulse beating, his wet lips slid on his chest leaving watermarks, and then he kissed his abdomen and his pubic hair, gently tasted his soften penis, and then he laid down beside Sherlock finally, stretching his limbs, breathing heavily with Sherlock.
"Sherlock, come up." Mycroft’s emotionless voice spoke from the car.
"Are you connected to that network?" Sherlock found the idea a little fascinating - the ordinary people were so stupid to deal with; if replaced them by the smartest people, how interesting it would be?
My feeling for you was no longer can be saved.
＃　　　　　＃　　　　　＃
Sherlock lied back in bed, leaning towards the heat of John. John hugged him in the sleep and Sherlock clung to him, they held each other tight, kept warm in the winter with each other's body temperature.
Sherlock did not want to see that expression on John's face again. He forcibly pushed John down on the bed, pressed his entire body against him, fiercely glared at John.
"What's up?" Sherlock held his burning face, biting his teeth, and looking up to the detective, he had seen last time who named Lestrade. "Have a new case?"
Beneath the pale moonlight from the window, Sherlock found that John was sweating, frowning and writhing in bed painfully and his sheets were a total mess - he was trapped in his despairing nightmare, could not break free, only could shout helplessly.
"Police?" John looked at Sherlock in panic, not waiting for him to answer, covering his face with the blanket and turning to face the door.
Sherlock found himself and John both like that feeling - they both addicted to thrilling adventures, that’s why John became a soldier and Sherlock was a bad student who habitually played truant - a taboo relationship got their adrenaline going, to challenge the social norms excited them so much and made them more indulgent to this relationship.
Wake up and tell me the truth.
The water level rose very fast, already lost the trace of James. But Sherlock was so dizzy and had no time to think of him, he could only desperately head out of the water and kept breathing. The ceiling of the backup engine room was very high, almost had three floors height, but the water still quickly drowned to the beam, Sherlock struggling to hold the beam, his head nearly touched the ceiling above, if the water level continuing to rise, very soon he would be killed here.
Sherlock trembled under his aphrodisiac staring, as he longed for touch by another person for so long, and the young man in front of him was good looking and not annoying.
"Who is it?" John went to the door and cried out.
"Why?"
Obviously, I just committed suicide. For his safety, I could only commit suicide.
"I shouldn't have done that! I was too arrogant to assume that I married Mary would solve her problem... She cried the first night after married me, she discovered our relationship and she knew I don't love her... "
