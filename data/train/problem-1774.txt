. They go back to Stoke Moran and Sherlock reveals what he, of course, noticed as soon as they arrived: that only the carriage house and the old tack shed are wired for electricity, and that the locations of the female figure seen by Lady Stoner correspond to the effects that could be produced with the suspicious equipment from these two buildings. They present their findings to Lady Stoner.
The only time they ever met on a weekend was a Saturday in early December. John was sleeping in. Actually, he was lying half awake, debating with himself whether Liam Little, snoring three beds away, would stay asleep long enough for John to have a quiet wank. Or, was Liam faking sleep in hopes that John would finally get up so that he could pull the same trick? It had been known to happen. John had not yet reached a conclusion when a tapping at the window caught his attention. He pulled the bed curtains aside to look, and saw a paper airplane—a parchment airplane, really—tapping its sharp nose urgently against the glass. John lifted the sash to let it in, whereupon it stabbed itself futilely against his chest and then dropped to the floor, exhausted.
and realizes he’s almost rocking. So he rocks, back and forth, several times, and then several more times. Sweat breaks out along his hairline.
In his bedroom, Sherlock paces, fingers pressed to lips, his thoughts racing.  These past weeks with John, he could have sworn—but no, mistaken, clearly.  He has misjudged, again,
I spend the ride home thinking about where in the flat I’d like to shut off cameras—not because I’m going to do anything more with Sherlock, but just because the idea of a little privacy is too tempting to ignore. Sherlock is out when I get home, so I get to work checking the camera angles with Blick. The sitting room is the most heavily covered, which makes sense considering that’s where most interpersonal action is supposed to take place. Lots of angles on the kitchen, as well. The downstairs bath has two views, one head height in the shower and one on the mirror. My little bathroom upstairs has one, just a general shot of the room, angled to avoid the loo. (Thank heaven for small mercies.) My bedroom has one, a full-room view that includes the bed. Sherlock’s bedroom has—jesus,
When the gate guard waves Sherlock through, having checked Mycroft’s authorization, Sherlock sits back smugly in his seat. “The keys to the kingdom,” he says.
I must be as quiet as a mouse.  I must be as gentle as a summer breeze brushing the tops of the long grass.
he would have to be unconscious, and the only way to knock him out without raising his suspicion would be to get him to do the deed himself. Everyone knows Sherlock is afraid of flying, but we never knew how he coped with it because the flights were always darked out.  If Sherlock were awake in the air, he would look out the window and see that the geography around his London is all wrong. He’d see the security perimeter, the artificial horizon field projectors. He’d see how his Thames begins and ends at the city borders, a backcountry stream artificially inflated to a busy urban waterway. It would give away the game entirely.
The silence goes on and on, only slightly broken by an occasional rustle of cloth or unintelligible whisper, until, clear as a bell, Sherlock’s rough voice can be heard: “John, oh, don’t stop, my God.”
Sherlock reflects on this homily as he makes his way home. It may be true, but why say it? Why, to him of all people, and now, in particular? It makes him think of John, John saying “it’s not a good idea,” even as his lips were red from kissing. It makes him think of Irene, her brittle advances, so obviously cold and calculated. This message is coming at him from every quarter. But where does it originate?
“Fine,” said John, darting out from under Sherlock’s hand.  His eyes snapped up from where they had been gazing about the level of Sherlock’s chest, and he was struck anew by the strange elegance of Sherlock’s features, the oddness of his hidden eyes.
“You want to get some sleep, now the case is over?” I finish toweling my hair and hang up the towel on the hook on the bathroom door.
“We must get you home and warm,” I said. “But I doubt whether a cab would take us, with you in that state.”
“I’m sorry,” John said, looking up at the picture of Headmaster Snape, which glowered back at him. He couldn’t pretend to understand everything that had happened at Hogwarts during the war, but he had never believed Snape was evil. Seeing his picture here was a strange relief.
“Right.” She favors us with a blinding smile. “Lovely to have met you both. Now get some sleep, and just call me if you need anything else.”
Just wanted to say THANK YOU to those who have been commenting! I don't always know how to respond to short comments, but please know that I love getting them. I'm beyond delighted to know that you're there and having feelings about this fic. <3
“Seen, yes. Felt? No.” His voice is soft. With a finger, he tilts my chin to the other side, observing closely. “There’s something about you, John. I don’t understand it yet, but I think you’re the key to everything.”
“It’s perfectly apparent that you can’t afford to pay a fair share of the rent, which would suggest that this arrangement benefits you disproportionately.  Sherlock is not in the habit of handing out favors, particularly ones as inconvenient as I assume a mundane flatmate must be.  Therefore, I assume he gets something out of you in return.  Tell me, what is it?”
“John’s supposed to be his new bestie, I think he should go after him,” Lestrade says.  The others nod.
“C’mere,” I say, and I scoot down and he scoots up, and he lies back and lets me open that top button at the hollow of his throat. I kiss him there, and he sighs. I keep kissing as I undo the rest of the buttons, all bones and hollows under my tongue, smooth skin under my hands, his dusting of reddish-dark chest-hair angled like a map. We get chest-to-chest again and he shivers, starved for touch.
I give a genuine snort of laughter at that idea. He’ll know with a single glance, know that I’ve left him alone in the middle of a mental breakdown for a one night stand. Even if he really were invulnerable to emotions, the disloyalty in that would be apparent to reason alone. Besides, Irene said I had to stay with him.
I am sorry I wasn’t able to write sooner. There has been a family emergency. I am no longer in Britain. I don’t know when I will see you again, but I am not coming back to Hogwarts this year.
As John made his way to the worktable and opened his book, he wondered whether they were actually going to spend the entire year working on this one potion. But once he read the instructions, he understood. The first step was just to mix up a bunch of ingredients and say a couple of incantations. The mixture would then steep for 99 days, at which time there was another few day’s worth of active work, followed by another long rest. The first step was to measure out a large beaker of honey and then add a pinch of powdered unicorn horn. As he worked, John cast a surreptitious glance at Sherlock’s workspace. It looked like he was working on the same potion, and not some project of his own.
I consider this, consider her. “So what are you really like, underneath all of that? Would you flirt with Sherlock in the real world?”
The few minutes before Greg arrived gave them just enough time to set up a spy camera on the bedside table. Sherlock took his laptop up to John’s old bedroom—now a trifle musty with disuse and cluttered with odds and ends—and settled in on the bed to load up the feed. The camera angle left a little to be desired, but the sound pickup would be good. In fact, even now he was getting some sound from it as John padded out to the kitchen and poured himself a glass of water. He could hear the real sounds of it as well, floorboards creaking and water hissing in the pipes. Ordinary and not.
“He was a frequent topic of conversation,” she said. At this point John was stopped from asking any more questions by their arrival at the gargoyle that guarded the entrance to the Headmaster’s—Headmistress’s—Office.
Sherlock sniffed.  “If you like.  You must see the dilemma, though: even if I had some sort of bird or beast taking up space, it wouldn’t be able to whack me with holly branches.  I’d need an assistant.  Someone I could trust.”
That thought sent a shiver of apprehension through John.  What, after all, was their arrangement?  The stupid earwax thing--what would Sherlock have done if John had flat out refused?  Would he have tried to force the issue?  Would he have thrown John out on the street?  John thought not, but how could he know?  What would happen when Sherlock eventually asked for something that John was not prepared to give him?
I’ve seen Sherlock take drugs before: swallow them, snort them, inject them.  It was a difficult period of his life, and seemed to go on and on.  The public almost rioted.   Lestrade was finally cast to convince to him that he had to get sober, and he did, so far as anyone knew.  But the whole reason people were upset was that the drugs were real.  Mycroft went on late-night TV and explained.
Mercury in the chocolate wrappers—jesus, weird, who comes up with this stuff? Flashing torches, a shout off in the dimness—
My jumper is under Sherlock’s overnight bag, which is lying open on the chintz armchair to one side of the bed. As I pick up the bag to move it, something catches my eye. In an unzipped side pocket is Irene’s phone. The fact that he brought it here with him is enough to draw my attention, and when I look closer, I see…its twin. Two phones. Two identical Irene Adler camera phones.
“Point is, if it’s okay with Sherlock, I’m…more than willing.” John let his legs fall open. In Lestrade’s position, Sherlock would have been utterly unable to resist, but maybe it was different if you weren’t the primary Alpha. He couldn’t help smiling to himself at the thought.
John shook his head. “You’ve heard the rumors. Hell, you know the statistics. Anti-Muggleborn crimes are on the rise everywhere. More and more of our patients are victims of dark curses.”
So John closed his eyes and kissed him. A single, still, unbroken press of lips to lips, going on and on as the train rocked them.
Sherlock is taking bloody forever. I’m just thinking I should go in after him when a young woman comes out — out of the men’s toilet. She has curly gingerish hair, a blazer and a wool skirt and a deerstalker hat on her head.
“Come on,” John said. He lay back to let Sherlock roll between his legs. Sherlock twisted away for a moment and came back with his wand. He murmured a lubrication charm—John’s favorite of the several he knew—then tossed aside the wand and applied his amply slickened hand to John’s cock. After a few quick, delicious strokes, he slid his fingers back, and John moaned as they breached him.
He shakes his head as though clearing cobwebs away. “That’s what Sally and I call it. Mycroft is absolutely opposed to Sherlock getting into any kind of…you know. Anything too intimate.”
potion,” Sherlock said, standing up unsteadily. He dusted the front of his apron briskly, which made not the slightest difference to its filthy state. “That’s the control, I bought it. I’m just try’n’a make a better one so’s I can get more bread’n’honey, guvna. Oh! Did you say Aurors?”
The last room at the end of the hall is just like every other servants’ bedroom: two old, narrow bedsteads without mattresses, one spindly chair, one cheaply built wooden chest, not locked, one small window admitting a feeble beam of overcast daylight, and one intact layer of ancient dust. He’s just turning to go back downstairs when, under his heel, a floorboard shifts and rattles in a very particular way. Crouching down to look, he finds that it has indeed been loosened, probably so that something can be hidden underneath it.
Of course it was too much to hope that I might surprise him. I stand up and step out from around the desk in a single motion, keeping the gun trained on his heart. His hands are up, which is, at least, gratifying.
“Oh do keep up, John. We’ve been working against Mycroft for quite some time now. Sherlock is already beginning to suspect.”
“I’ve been able to protect him from the worst of the bullies so far, but, of course, I won’t be there for him next year.”
So, yeah, when Irene turns up asking for her phone back, I’m less than thrilled. Sherlock fixates on her immediately, solves her little puzzle remarkably quickly for someone who hates planes. She comes onto him incredibly hard. I think she’s trying to make me jealous (which I am, thanks), but I don’t really understand why.
I struggle up to sitting, shoving his hand away, though he’s already withdrawing it. I’m too hot, breathing hard. I’m still wearing my jumper, for Christ’s sake. I pull it off over my head, along with my shirt. The cool air on my skin restores some sanity. Are we doing this? Yeah, fuck it all, we are. He wants to, I want to, nobody can see us. He deserves whatever honesty I can give him, and this, right now, is honest. It’s me. It’s true. But I’m damned if I’ll let him just stroke me off as some sort of payback for the first time.
“God, yes,” I moaned, and then Holmes—Sherlock—was stroking my cock and fucking my thighs together in a quick, sure rhythm that soon had me quite breathless. All his lean strength went into each strike of his pelvic bone against the soft backs of my thighs. He pressed his open mouth to the back of my shoulder, and I knew I wouldn’t last much longer. “Holmes, yes, God,” I panted, trying hard to keep my voice quiet. He grunted into my skin, working his hand on me in a fast, fluid motion, and I came with my eyes squeezed shut, biting back my cries as well as I could. Holmes stilled his hand immediately, but my climax seemed only to spur him onward; he gave a few final, fast thrusts of his hips, and then slowed suddenly, whimpering against my neck as his prick spasmed between my legs, his emission dampening my skin.
He holds my gaze for a long moment. Once he’s sure his message has sunk in, he sits back again, giving his knees a businesslike slap.
Nine minutes since he started inserting it, with no supplementary lubrication allowed or, in fact, required.
He stepped into the center of the circle, and John had little choice but to do as he asked, again striking him all over with the wickedly sharp leaves.  Again Sherlock stood in the circle and produced that outflowing wave, which raised gooseflesh as it traveled over John’s skin, touching every inch of his body as though he had passed through the surface of a pool of water.  The sensation left him strangely dizzy, and he found himself watching dumbly as Sherlock walked toward him and took the holly branch from his hand, tossing it into the fireplace.
“None of it makes any sense,” he goes on, his voice rough and quiet. “But I sometimes feel as though, somehow, I’m not really here. Like I’m an imaginary person. As though nothing I do really matters.”
“Wait,” I say, grabbing for his sleeve, but he whirls, turns my momentum against me, and when I get myself right again I’m facing down the barrel of my own gun.
“He won’t disappear,” Brook says. “He’s still here, trapped in his office—besieged, you might say. But Sherlock won’t notice any difference, because Mycroft Holmes has no choice but to keep playing his part, as long as he has any hope that we might fail.”
Lestrade shrugs. “Brook, one way or another. He says Sherlock won’t act yet, but he’ll believe it, after this. It’s almost over. We’ve lost.”
“So,” Sherlock says, as the helicopter lifts off from the turf in some farmer’s field. “You’ve got questions.”
Before he can answer, a phone chimes—not Sherlock’s. He reaches into a trouser pocket and pulls out Irene’s phone. His expression as he reads it is still—still in the way that tells me he is concealing strong emotion.
, like cramming an aubergine into a buttonhole. But it could be done, he thought. If he were careful.
In the morning—Saturday—Sherlock was Alpha, too.  This was good news, as it meant that he could carry out his plan.
Only, now, Sherlock at home is different, because I’m there.  We chat, we bicker.  I blow my top about the contents of the fridge, he insults my writing.  I compliment his violin playing.  He plays while I cook dinner.  He antagonizes me and shows off to me and sometimes doesn’t speak for hours at a time.  I wonder if more people watch us during these scenes than they used to do, and I wonder if anyone misses that old serenity of Sherlock at home alone.
“Yes.”  Breathless, unequivocal. I get a sudden glimpse of our future, and it knocks the breath out of me, the thought that I could have this, have
This was one area, Sherlock and John had been dismayed to discover, where the Change had not really made much difference. Before the change, so-called “hot” Omegas had suffered from barely acknowledged discrimination. It was common for them to lose their jobs because of their condition, or to suffer from sexual harassment at work when they were forced to make it known. If they did go out in public alone while on heat, they were still technically protected from sexual assault under the law, but in practice it was difficult to get convictions because it was so widely accepted that heat overwhelmed the self control of Omegas and Alphas alike.
“No,” John said quietly. “You want to read the texts? I’ll have him text you, if you want, or call you, even.”
My sprint doesn’t last long—there are more and more people in the street as I get nearer the place. I gradually realize that there is something happening in the street up ahead, a compaction of the crowd. It’s only when I get up close that I see the barricade, armored vehicles blocking the roadway, men with long guns standing on top of them, men in riot gear standing shoulder-to-shoulder on the pavement, glass visors glinting in the early light. I suppose they must be Brook’s men, tasked with keeping anyone from getting through to where Sherlock is. The ordinary people—the extras—are hanging back in a nervous line. They don’t seem to be trying to force any sort of confrontation; they’re just standing there, bunched up as close as they dare to the roadblock.
On the other hand, the naked box was garish enough that one couldn’t simply hand it over. So he gave it to John in the bag from the shop, with a mumbled “Happy anniversary.” John, being no more inclined than Sherlock toward unnecessary ceremony when it came to gifts, wasted no time in pulling the box out of the bag.
“Not after this. We’ve missed our chance. He’s learning the truth right now, in the back of that cab.”
Henry Knight with a gun in his mouth is the icing on the cake; he’ll save a life today, on top of everything. Oh, to be Sherlock Holmes!
“But—“ and this is me. Everyone turns to look. I try not to shift in my seat. “But don’t you think this is worse, in a way? Making him wonder, making him doubt himself? You saw what happened in Grimpen; he was panicking.”
The scripted scene with Mike Stamford needs a couple of takes, thanks to my nerves, but it doesn’t matter, because it’s not live; only Sherlock himself is ever shown live, and you can see that all day, every day, around the clock.  The screen only goes dark when Sherlock is doing something private—which, for Sherlock, just means it’s something the showrunners deem inappropriate for broadcast.  Most people just think it means he’s naked during those times, but nobody really knows.  Then they show an edited version for an hour every night, just the highlights of the day, together with background scenes, like the one I’ve just done with Mike (or whatever his real name is; nobody tells me).
“I can offer you a position as Madam Pomfrey’s assistant. Acquit yourself well there, and we may be able to revisit your application at a later time.”
We’re just kissing. Just standing there lip-locked, and of course he hasn’t really done this. He doesn’t know—except maybe in theory—what to do next. I let my hands alight on his hips, breathe, tilt my head a little for a better angle. He counter-tilts to match and oh,
After John stepped clear, the whole complex pattern on the floor blazed up with a pale light.  Sherlock kept his arms upraised a moment longer, then brought his hands together, not quite touching, in front of his chest.  He inhaled deeply once, then exhaled as he pushed his hands quickly outward.  With that gesture came a wave of--something--that passed over John and outward, making the door creak and rattling the dishes in the kitchen sink.  The circle fell dark once more.
“My fault,” Sherlock said. “Soundproofing charm, keeps noise out as well as in. I’ll modify it so you can hear me coming next time.”
“Sherlock,” John said. “There’s no such thing as de-glowing potion, and what—what the hell are you talking about? Christ, what are you
The car takes me to a stately, old-looking building. At first I can’t fathom what’s going on, until I spot a discreet plaque mounted above the door: Diogenes. Well, of bloody course. I knock on the door, and a butler—I mean, an honest-to-God butler—shows me into a well-appointed foyer. At this point, however, the veneer of a reputable gentlemen’s club breaks down slightly, because the door to the interior is fitted with a security keypad. The butler taps in a six-digit code, in response to which a panel of the wainscoting slides back to reveal a top-of-the-line retinal scanner. He peers into it, the bluish light incongruous in the old fashioned room, and the wood-paneled door makes a series of quiet mechanical clicks, then swings open to reveal a very much not wood-paneled corridor. The right-hand wall is covered with a delicately twinkling substance that I think I recall seeing in the design section of the Times before I was cast, and the left is set with a mind-bendingly expensive unbroken bank of slowglass windows looking out on a dramatic, mountainous landscape. These panes sat for a year in a mountainside slowglass farm, absorbing the rarefied alpine sun that streams into this hallway now, striking prismatic glints from the twinkly wall. It’s beautiful. It would blow Sherlock’s mind, considering that slowglass was only invented a few years ago and hasn’t been introduced into his world.
“Fine,” Sherlock spat, at last.  He took a deep breath.  “John.  May I please collect some of your earwax for a spell I’m working on?  I’m afraid nothing else will quite do.”
Then there are his usual cravings: cases, stimulants. What with one thing and another, he’s almost too distracted to notice that Henry Knight is important. He is a poor, jittery fool suffering from psychotic delusions induced by his childhood trauma. That much is clear. Sherlock is about to throw him out when he says “hound”.
So John told Headmistress McGonagall that he would take the job in the infirmary. She smiled and shook his hand and asked him to call her Minerva, which was somehow the most unnerving part of the whole thing. She didn’t bring up the question of lodging, so he didn’t say anything about Sherlock’s offer, but when Sherlock caught up with him at the Three Broomsticks later that morning, he had made up his mind.
be a bad idea,” Sherlock huffed, sounding offended.  “Getting my own materia mixed up in the work?  That never leads to anything good.”
It was a chilly January night. We had followed a young woman, a Miss Green, whom we suspected of hiding evidence related to the disappearance of a prominent banker, down to the river’s edge. We ducked into the shadow of a coal bin to watch her movements. There was a little wooden wharf there, and she walked out onto it, a penetrating gust of wind tugging at her mantle. Holmes gripped my arm tightly. As we watched she rummaged under her cloak and took out a small object which she clutched in her hand. She extended her arm and dropped her prize straight down into the water. It glinted faintly in the lamplight before plunging below the sluggish surface of the water. Her errand done, she turned on her heel and started back the way she had come, passing within a yard of our hiding place.
“Yeah, which is none.  I don’t think you could pay me enough to do your job.”  I don’t have an answer for this, and she watches me speculatively for a moment before going on.  “You actually like it, don’t you?”
His left hand is still resting against his mouth, the fingers of his right just touching me. His eyes are closed.
John shot out a hand, grasping the wrist that was too close to his head, shoving it roughly away, twisting it.  A cotton bud fell from limp fingers, and his assailant gave a strangled cry--
[ Plot point: John forgets his twig and is kidnapped by one of Sherlock’s enemies]“What does it do?”
Update schedule continues to be funky due my being on vacation. Sorry about this! It should smooth out again in a week or so.
He’s rubbing himself against my thigh; small, slow tilts of his hips, maybe not conscious of it, just rubbing soft cotton between his cock and my skin. I think again of that little dark wet spot, and reach for him. He moans—God,
With my gun in my hand, I’m crouched on a rug behind an oversized antique desk. It feels good to have it with me, listening, waiting.
But then things get rather strange. I get stuck in the lab somehow, card reader’s not working, bright lights in my face, something howling. Pulse racing, palms sweating, and I know it’s not real, I
“I wouldn’t have minded it,” John said. Sherlock’s eyes met his, then slid away again. “So,” John went on, “then we arrested you, and then the war started. What happened next?”
Meanwhile, our physical experiments continue, albeit at a fairly sedate pace. Sherlock’s busy schedule goes some way toward keeping us chaste, and even when we do get a moment, the things we do are so…innocent, almost. I’m careful never to ask anything of him that he doesn’t freely offer, and his desires progress in tiny increments. He wants to be good at things, mostly, wants to perfect his ability to get me off with hands and mouth and skin, as we’ve done before. So he focuses in on details, touches me with the most exquisite care and attention. It’s unlike anything else I’ve ever had. I repay him chiefly by having mind-smashing orgasms; I can’t get within a mile of matching his creativity, so I focus on touching him in ways that have worked before, and in ways that he’s touched me, in hopes that I’m not pushing his boundaries. He seems to like it—rather a lot, actually—but I wish I could be more for him.
He makes an affirmative sound. We lie still for some time. I’m on the edge of dozing when he speaks again.
We catch our fake cab in the grey quiet just before dawn, and Sherlock is already wobbly when he gets out twenty minutes later. An elevator takes us to the roof of the building, where a helicopter is waiting to pick us up. I end up snapping Sherlock’s ear defenders on for him as he passes out in the passenger seat before we even get airborne, his pale Adam’s apple sticking out as he throws back his head and snores.
Finn is not under the Vauxhall Arches, and Old Byron is nowhere to be found on the Heath. In fact, Sherlock sees no one he knows on his whole expedition. What few homeless people he does encounter scurry out of sight at his approach, unwilling to be approached or answer his questions. Can his reputation among them have been damaged somehow? That would be most inconvenient.
John came back to Hogwarts the following year feeling somewhat guilty about his refusal. He resolved that he would try to help if he did see anything going on with Sherlock. Although, he told himself, he’d do the same for anyone he knew was being bullied. As it turned out, though, the matter hardly even came up. Between Quidditch practices and his increasingly busy class schedule, John honestly didn’t have much time to observe the social dynamics of those around him, and Ravenclaws were not all that sociable to begin with. He could have counted on one hand the number of times he ran into Sherlock in the halls, and he seemed to skip mealtimes a lot.
“Well, my friend wouldn’t let me out of her sight if I didn’t get one. Otherwise I’d probably still be locked in a room somewhere.”
I decide to let him off the hook before he gets any more technical. “Ok, yes, you’re right. I’ve never been in a relationship with a man, and I’ve never had sex with a man.”
“If I’d been happy there, you wouldn’t have found me in Croydon. No, I was unspeakably bored. I ran away back to London and started using a false name.  And that’s when I—well. That’s when I started misbehaving. It was a way to make money, at first.”
But I do, indeed, respect Sherlock’s privacy during this difficult time. He won’t be hearing from me.
“God! I dunno,” John said, squirming. “Kind of. But I know it’s just—just chemical. Don’t hurt him, really, I’m sure he can’t help it—“
The next Morning, John woke to the sound of Sherlock clattering about downstairs.  It was just as well he’d awakened early; he needed to get down to the business of finding employment.  Free rent was a boon, but he couldn’t very well live with no income at all, and anyway, he wasn’t sure how long he’d want to stay with Sherlock.
In the Settings menu, he finds that “Wifi Hotspot” is set to “on”. He turns it off, and the IAPHONE network disappears from the wifi menu on his laptop. That, at least, is something. He leaves it turned off, not that it probably makes any difference to whomever is watching.
“You’re quite lucky I didn’t knock you out, you know,” said John.  “I have combat training and post-traumatic nightmares. It’s really not a good idea to wake me up suddenly.”
“More fingers,” he rumbles. His tone registers as demanding, but I’m far too hazy at this point to even tease him about it. I shove two fingers easily back inside him, and he groans luxuriously. The sight of his cock bouncing against his belly serves as sudden inspiration; I slide down between his thighs, and take it into my mouth. I can’t see his face anymore, but I can hear him panting, open-mouthed, as I suck him deep and stroke him from inside, over and over again, without mercy, until his cock is so rigid I can barely close my lips around it.
If he were the sort of person who slept, he would not be sleeping well. He’s been edgy, and not just from the nicotine cravings. (God,
Sherlock scowled in a way that suggested John’s guess had struck close to home.  “It isn’t like that.”
He holds the memory stick out to me.  I pluck it from his fingers, place it in his palm, and curl his hand closed around it with both of mine.  Or that’s what the cameras will see, anyway.  The truth is that I work a very simple bit of sleight-of-hand.  Sherlock, I’m sure, sees it happen, but his eyes give only the slightest flicker toward our joined hands.  The memory stick I give him is not the one he gave me.  I send up a silent prayer that he has decoded the warning in the phone number, that he will be cautious about where and how he opens this particular file.  “Keep it,” I say.  “I’ve got a whole bucket full.”
We’re standing in front of a bank of windows in an ultra-modern loft when we get the news that Mycroft has been arrested.
“Come on, Jack,” she purrs. “Sherlock can survive the night without you. I’ll have you back bright and early. He won’t even know you were gone.”
“I’m sure Mycroft wishes I were,” she says. “But my contract stipulates that my involvement will continue. I’m going to be brought back.”
Inside, I hear Lestrade’s voice coming from upstairs. I go up, and the two of them fill me on the case: a kidnapping. Greg gives me not the slightest flicker of a hint about what’s going on, and then we’re off to a posh boarding school to investigate.
He barely pauses to catch his breath, and then he’s turning in my arms and kissing me and kissing me and
“It isn’t that I don’t believe you would be capable,” she went on gently. “It’s simply that I can’t have a Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor who might respond to a stray hex by blowing something up. These are children, not trained wizards. They are unpredictable at the best of times, and truly dangerous at their worst. One needs a steady head.”
At first, the trial proceeds just as it would in the real world: Sherlock is put on the stand, he mouths off outrageously, the judge has him thrown out.
John (I still call him John; he takes it as a pet name, an intimacy) climbs out of the pool with a soft splash. I do look up at the sound of his wet feet padding on the stone tiles, as John is a sight always worth seeing, trim and tan and glistening in the sun.
Nowadays, casual objectification of Omegas was much less acceptable than it once had been (indeed, it was almost nonexistent among the younger generation), but there was no denying the effect that an Omega in heat could have on any Alphas who caught a whiff of them. John wasn’t in any actual danger—or not much, anyway—both because he was tough and because norms of Alpha behavior had improved since the change. But the few times that he had tried going about his ordinary life during his heat, the distorted attention from Alphas had been disruptive enough to discourage him from doing so on a regular basis. These days, if he had to go out, Sherlock would go with him to fend them off. Sherlock was always Alpha during John’s heats—an effect of pheromones, he supposed—and he took more enjoyment then he probably should have from raising his figurative hackles at any competitor who looked sideways at his…well, his mate, apparently. John’s feelings were more mixed, but that was to be expected.
“I’m a femme fatale, John. That’s my role. If I didn’t play sexy, people wouldn’t be interested in watching.”
“Because—“ and then I stop. It’s because I’m not brave enough. Because I don’t want to hurt him. Because I don’t want to lose him.
“Well, I am,” she says. “Bored to death, really. I think it’s time we put our plan into action, Sherlock.”
“I’d like to live in London, though,” he murmurs, on the edge of sleep. “At least for now. Feels like I’m meant to be here.”
Thank you to the anonymous person who prompted this idea on the BBC Sherlock kink meme! I hope you stuck around for the ending, and I'm sorry it took so long.
“Stand here,” I said to Holmes, steering him to stand beside the chimney. Quickly, I heaved his wet ulster over a rafter to drip and pulled the pallet as close as I could to our only source of warmth. I then set about undressing my companion. He had become listless, and at first did nothing to help me; though after a moment he seemed to come to himself a little, and shrugged out of the overcoat as I lifted it from his shoulders. Jacket, waistcoat, tie, and shirt followed; then shoes, stockings, trousers, singlet and drawers, all soaking wet and cold to the touch. Even in the dim light, I could make out Holmes standing nude before me, his skin pale and cold as a fish. Of course, there could be nothing to inflame the senses in such a grim circumstance. I fell easily into my habit of medical detachment with regard to the human form, and felt no inappropriate stirrings, not even when considering what I was about to do next.
So John was still. Holding John’s gaze, Sherlock gingerly took his weight off of John’s shoulder and, before John could stop him, drew the knife blade across his palm. John saw a flash of deep red blood before Sherlock clapped his freshly wounded hand against the rent in John’s trousers. Then he found John’s eyes again and, as John felt himself spinning away into that blue-green sea, Sherlock uttered three distinct and separate words. John could not have repeated them, afterward, but they sounded ancient and hard as stones.
“It would have worked if it weren’t for all this pheromonal nonsense. We should try again when John’s heat is over.”
And with that, she sashays out of the room.  Her pretty assistant casts an amused look my way as she leaves.
Back at Baker Street, he finds that John has gone out and come back again and gone to bed. John has left him a curry in a bag on the worktop, but he ignores it. He lies down on the sitting room sofa, steeples his fingers beneath his chin, and listens to the traffic outside, wishing he could be certain whether its rhythms have changed. There’s something not right, something he can’t put his finger on, which brings him back again to Grimpen Village and the way he felt ever so slightly out of his depth when he turned his attention to anything besides the case. Even John seemed different there. But different how? It’s inexpressible, inexplicable, and he clenches his teeth in frustration. John, usually so transparent to his insight, is hiding something.
The way he’s draped over me feels like it might almost work. Carefully, I withdraw my fingers, then try to line up his hips, but we’ll never get anywhere like this; the angle makes it too complicated, and I can’t believe we’re getting hung up on fucking logistics when every nerve in my body is—
But tight—too tight, maybe. He makes a noise, and I slow down. More lube, maybe? His face is flushed, a sweaty tendril of hair stuck to his cheek. I force myself to hold still.
They split a cab home from the station. When they get to John’s house, Mary is out on the pavement, walking up and down with Livy fussing in her carrier. Trying to get the baby to fall asleep, Sherlock supposes. As John approaches them, Sherlock sees Livy’s face light up with a huge, toothless smile. John smiles back just as brightly, lifts the baby out of the carrier and hugs her, hugs his wife. Before the cab drives off, Sherlock sees the three of them silhouetted in the yellow light of their doorway as they go inside.
“You’re both mental,” Lestrade said, but he was peeling off his shirt. He shook his head to dash the sweat from his brow, climbed briskly out of his pants, and clambered back up onto the bed. John flipped over, and Sherlock suddenly had a mouthful of him, a soft, hot kiss as John’s body covered him, close and private after seeing so much of John’s back. Sherlock pulled him closer still.
He releases me abruptly, and I gasp a much-needed breath of air. While I’m still waiting for the room to stop spinning, Sherlock swings his legs out from among the blankets and starts rummaging in his bag.
As it turns out, I needn’t have bothered.  Sherlock emerges from his room at 2 P.M., eyes glued to something on his mobile.  He takes his cold plate of breakfast, deposits it on the floor beside the sofa, and goes back to his phone without acknowledging my presence in the slightest.
. But before Sherlock can react, it starts up again, on a slow, thudding tempo that rises and falls in intensity. He bites his lip and holds very still.
I doubt very much he’ll want to keep it. He hasn’t told me much about how the Bond Air case ended—only that he saved the day by guessing Irene’s password after all. He seems just as glad to have the whole thing finished. He’ll be fine with it, I think—not seeing her again. I’d be fine with it, too, if I didn’t know the truth.
“Then I got better at wanking,” Sherlock said, and John laughed, loud and genuine, as Sherlock slid down the bed and set to work removing John’s trousers. He was still giggling when Sherlock took his cock in his mouth, and his laugh slid away into a groan. Sherlock sucked John deep once, just to get his attention, and then pulled off.
“I’ve got a large tower room all to myself. There’s more than enough room for you. Come round and see it tomorrow before you speak to Minerva.”
And on top of all that, there’s the problem of John. He’s grateful that Panopticon—as he has termed the whole situation in his mind—is at least interesting enough to divert his mind from running in circles over that other conundrum. Assuming the two problems aren’t one and the same.
“There’s—there’s nothing, honestly. Why? Has he got you under his thumb?” This doesn’t seem like the time or place to discuss Mycroft’s threats against my life.
“’S okay,” said John, and Sherlock leaned up to make room so that John could take himself in hand. He’d been close already, and it took barely a touch for all of his heat and want and that flayed-open feeling to coalesce again into the sweet sum of their parts. Sherlock moved slowly and deliberately, his cock dragging over the spot that made John leak and tremble, and John was really not going to last either, as it turned out.
The little silence that follows is interrupted by a text arriving on Sherlock’s phone. He pulls out his phone with his free hand.
“Work” is a high-security soundstage set up as a warehouse.  Somebody hands me my lines, Mycroft comes in through a side door, and we do the scene where he asks me to spy on Sherlock for money.  Where I think he’s some kind of arch-enemy or criminal mastermind.  After we’re done, he turns away, as though he plans to just go right back out the way he came.
“Sherlock.” I get my hand in his hair—no pressure, just touching. He inhales through his nose and takes me further in, his mouth a jumble of warm-slick and rough-smooth and faintly scraping edges, imperfect but fascinating, and in any case impossible to resolve into any specific complaint or instruction. He moves—hollows his cheeks—and the jumble gives way to something rather wonderful. Sherlock hums warmly at my reaction and settles in for a good long suck, not enough motion to be too dangerous, just hot and deep and welcoming. All my wandering attention draws inward and inward and down to where he’s taken me inside himself, building and blooming until I’m afloat, floating.
“Yes.” He’s gone pliant, eyes glazed as I kiss him, our fingers interlaced near his head. I kiss his lush mouth, his throat. His eyelids flutter.
“Oh,” he whispers again. His feet find mine beneath the sheets, toes hooking behind my ankles. I push the back of his t-shirt down with my chin, getting his skin beneath my mouth at last. God, he is so warm, his body supple in my arms, his cock such a tender handful. There is heat in my heart and my throat and my groin. Words crowd in my mouth, but I’m not fit to speak, so I just touch him, and he leans back into me and lets me do it. I milk pre-come up from the base of his cock, letting it slick the head so that everything slides more easily. His voice sifts out into the dark: small, subverbal noises.
, and maybe it’s wrong—more likely than not—but he can always say he didn’t realize. He can say John approached him, John wanted it, John held him down and took what he wanted, and how was Sherlock to know?
Through his confusion, Sherlock realized that John was trying to get out from under him, but couldn’t because of the knot. So Sherlock took hold and rolled them both over so that he was lying on his back with John on his chest. John tried to squirm upright, but Sherlock yelped in pain. John stilled, but he called for Greg again. Lestrade had left the room when Sherlock took over. Now he pushed the door slightly open and peered cautiously round it.
Sherlock’s mouth snapped shut, and for a moment he said nothing, but it seemed to John that he somehow expanded in size, the sunlight dimming as he gathered himself.
For a moment, nothing happened. But then a flicker of blue light reappeared, slithering back toward them out of the dark. When it came level with the fronts of the buildings, it bloomed suddenly outward, revealing an entire building where the crack had been. The two buildings on either side slid obligingly out of the way. The new building had once been a car repair shop, from the look of it, but now it was something else entirely. The workbenches were cluttered with all sorts of burners, beakers, cauldrons, bottles, and jars. A smoking brazier stood in the middle of the floor, hanging over which was a large cauldron of dangerously bubbling silvery liquid.
Before we go into the courtroom, Sherlock stops in at the loo. I wait around outside, taking in the imposing architecture of the Old Bailey, which is said to be a perfect replica of the real building. It’s funny that I’ve never been here with Sherlock before, but he generally declines to appear in court for cases that he’s solved, preferring to leave these more mundane aspects of criminal justice to the police.
“Slowly is fine,” he says. But then a knife-like embarrassment comes over him. Keeping his expression stiff, he leaves his tea and takes the laptop into his room.
. Sherlock twisted in his seat, stroking his cock faster. John turned over. Greg kneeled up and moved back out of sight.
“Lovely,” John licks into his ear. Sherlock bites his lip and lets John hook his fingers into the waistband of his pajamas and shove them down and off and away. He bites off a moan as John takes hold of his cock. John looks at him sharply.
“So, it was okay,” John said, pressing his face to Sherlock’s chest. “It was just crazy. I didn’t even know I could feel like that.”
He lay as though paralyzed, stubbornly refusing to take my meaning. After a moment, I wriggled backward. I had no idea what he would make of it, but with his cockstand pressed up between my buttocks, I found I didn’t care in the least. He made a sound not unlike that he had made when I first pressed my hot body against his frozen one, and clamped his arm tightly around my chest. He gave a long, hard rub of his prick against my skin, and then another, and I gasped, feeling how desire drove him onward in spite of his trepidation.
Sherlock wakes up on the sofa. He must have been more tired than he thought. The morning is bright and hazy, and John is in the kitchen trying to clatter the pans as softly as possible, humming something under his breath. Sherlock lies still a while, listening: John slicing bread, cracking eggs, his cat’s-tongue voice rasping around the edges of the tune. Probably doesn’t even know he’s doing it. The kettle boils.
Lestrade had at some point slid off to one side, and now lay with his head propped on his elbow, watching them with a hypnotic expression. When Sherlock looked back at him he blinked and raised his eyebrows, but didn’t look away. John turned his head to face Lestrade, too, resting it on Sherlock’s sternum.
“There wasn’t anything you could do. You were made powerless. And that’s completely fucked up and wrong, and it shouldn’t have happened. I’m so, so sorry this was done to you.”
Greg gets back on his mobile once Sherlock has explained the case. I stick close by him, hoping a for a moment when Sherlock isn’t looking. I finally get it while Sherlock is trying to hail a cab. Greg catches my eye at the same time I catch his. He takes the phone away from his mouth.
And yet. He could be wrong. He feels more and more wrong with each passing day. Panopticon remains unsolved. What if there is no solution? What if Moriarty is merely toying with him, trying to make him doubt his own senses, his own sanity? What if nobody is watching at all? Or if they are watching, could they still be watching him here, far from home, out in the countryside?
The notes probably have no bearing on the case, but Sherlock pockets them all the same, as a curiosity. Perhaps John will get a laugh out of them.
“Not quite as over the top as yours, but it…it has got me going.” John’s eyes are half-lidded, inward focused, his cheeks getting redder all the time.
They hadn’t done anything like this before, of course. Had John ever gone through heat without Sherlock in attendance? He had not. Neither of them had any experience of what it was like to be apart from each other during this time, let alone with a different person there instead. They had assumed that another Alpha could step in just as easily, but what if this wasn’t the case? The biology of heat hadn’t been tested in this situation.
The echoing antechamber offers me no answers, and Sherlock is nearly out of sight. I have not choice but to go after him.
“More,” he said. Sherlock grunted and thrust harder, so close John could feel it, and that was enough to drive him over the edge. John cried out and spilled over, throbbing. Sherlock was only a second behind him, thundering through John’s aftershocks with a loud moan. More kissing—sloppy, unthinking, jelly-boned—and then they rolled and lay together in the warm-rumpled darkness of the bed.
into my mouth. His whole long, sharp frame gets up against me. I drop the dishcloth and fist my hand in the back of his shirt—leaving a damp spot, no doubt, but it can’t be helped.
[ Could make this a convo with Lestrade, instead?]“Right enough,” said Mike, sipping his tea.  “And even that’s not respectable, by their standards.  The really posh families won’t deal with outsiders at all.  They have their own aristocracy, you know, their own lands--”
, I can almost hear him say), but he does turn over, spreads his knees wide, and cocks an eyebrow at me.
“Hm, perhaps that was a clumsy way to make my point, but then, I’m not really all that clever. Not in that way, or in Bach’s way, or in your way. I’m an actor, mainly.”
I’m at a loss for a comeback.  For a dizzy second I consider telling her the truth—that I’ve been bi-curious for years, that Sherlock is a good kisser, that during Sherlock’s troubled teen years I had wild fantasies about taking him away from it all—but Greg leaps in to defend my honor.
Sherlock, meanwhile, kept to no fixed schedule.  He was often out when John got home, no matter the hour of the night, but just as often he was home and awake, working on some intricate and mysterious project.  As far as John could tell, he almost never ate, and slept even less.  He did request that John carry the rowan twig with him, which John did.  He continued to wonder what it meant, often taking it out of his pocket to examine in his spare minutes.  In an odd way, it almost felt as though it brought Sherlock’s presence with it, as though Sherlock accompanied him on his daily rounds.
“Nothing that’ll do any harm,” Sherlock replied.  This had become his standard answer to any such question, but this time it wasn’t enough.
John’s head buzzed with questions, but something sealed his lips--not magic, only a feeling, and not one he had a name for.  Crouching gingerly to unroll the old Persian rug, he noticed that the design--what Sherlock called a circle, though circles were only part of it--was not drawn on the floorboards, but inlaid, an unbroken strand of silver cobwebbing most of the room.
“Sorry,” John said, and then: “Sherlock.” Sherlock, close to him, turned, and John pulled him in for a kiss. Sherlock gave a quiet hum of approval and put his arms around John’s back, and they stood and kissed for a long moment in the dusk.
After a few minutes, Sherlock sat up abruptly. “Stuffy, isn’t it?” he said. He reached for his wand, which had fetched up in a wrinkle of the coverlet, and, with a few brisk motions, pushed back the curtains on three sides of the bed. Then he settled again. John burrowed his face against his shoulder.
I go for a lot of walks. On one of them, a car pulls up next to me. It’s not one of Mycroft’s black cars, just a somewhat shabby little coupe, but when the window rolls down, I see it’s Mycroft’s PA. What’s her name. Anthea.
Confession time: I’m having fun. Even knowing it was all set up in advance, breaking into Baskerville had a certain tension and release to it. I don’t know whether Corporal Lyons was a real soldier, but he was a good enough imitation of one that I enjoyed pulling rank on him. In particular, I suppose I enjoyed doing it with Sherlock watching, being what he needed me to be. He needed me to play the soldier’s part, he took it for granted that I would do it, and I did it. We have a dynamic. I get high on that.
He’s made tea. He gestures me toward a chair—his chair, that overdesigned affair of leather and chrome. I take the offered seat. He pours the tea, stiffly sits down opposite.
It’s not easy trying to seem as relaxed as Sherlock, especially as I’m now realizing that our appearing together is having another effect that I hadn’t anticipated. It’s proving, in the public eye, that my sins have been forgiven. It’s also suggesting something else—something that may or may not be true.
“Are you all right, love? You seem a bit distracted.” Sounds of footsteps coming near, and then he opens his eyes to John’s fingers softly brushing the hair back from his forehead. “Christ, you’re burning up. Can a I get you a paracetamol? Draw you a cool bath, maybe?”
Sherlock lowered his tools and turned to look at John.  John felt that if he could see Sherlock’s eyes, they would be narrowed in suspicion.
“If you like,” Sherlock said, and so he took John around the room and told him what was what. John asked him what he was working on, and Sherlock described his ongoing potion experiments with increasing enthusiasm. John listened, and asked questions, and made suggestions, until he was struck silent by the dawning realization that this was the first time they had actually done
“You might at least knock,” Sherlock complained, laying aside in irritation the newspaper which he had been only pretending to browse.  John looked at him quizzically before turning to see who had come, then had to choke down his startlement at what he saw.  The visitor was a tall man, elegantly dressed in a russet-colored suit that looked to be at least a hundred years out of fashion.  His hands were smartly gloved in gray kid, and he carried an ornamented walking stick in one hand and a...good lord, a
His dark gloved hand darts out to grab the crook of my elbow, pulling me close—not roughly, but snugly. “If I win,” he purrs, “I get to do something to you that no one’s ever done before.”
“God, you are warm,” he said. He shuddered and nuzzled his face down between my shoulder and the pallet, his cheek cold against my skin. I held him tightly, feeling his shivers diminish little by little. My shoulder was going numb from being pinned down for so long, but I ignored it. The smell of his pomade was strong in my nostrils, overlaying the faintly muddy smell deposited by the ungentle embrace of the Thames. The muscles of his back were hard with tension. Our knees bumped together. Hardly ideal, I thought; I parted my legs slightly so that he could get one thigh between mine.
John let out a long half-growl, and Sherlock knew that he was genuinely reaching a new pitch of desperation. “Please,” he rumbled, grudgingly.
“Don’t look so surprised,” Sherlock says, addressing Mycroft. “If John could find you here, surely it was obvious that I could, as well.”
He dressed and went downstairs, to find Sherlock bent over the kitchen table, which was covered in strange paraphernalia: magnifying lenses, glass bottles of unknown substances, a stone mortar, and a number of curious metal instruments.  In the center of it all was a broad disk of slate, on which Sherlock had sketched a few sigils in silver chalk.  Three small bowls were arranged on it, one of them giving off a thick, yellow smoke.
Sherlock is leaned up on one elbow watching me, eyes wide, no doubt wondering if I’m going to push him away again. His skin is flushed pink, right down to the open collar of his shirt.
Sherlock straightened the rug by the mundane method of shoving it here and there with his foot, then had John help him put the furniture back in place.  It was nothing ostentatious: a couple of aging armchairs, some small tables, a desk and chair.  There was a long leather sofa against one wall, but that hadn’t been moved.
“Fine.” He takes the proffered paper reflexively, then throws it on the floor when he realizes he refused it only a moment ago. John, already back in the kitchen, doesn’t react.
“No. Although I understand some people do frown on gambling.” He looks at me in a way that can only be described as lascivious. Of course, he doesn’t know that Lestrade most likely knows what we’ve been up to, but Greg plays it off well.
I take the phone out of my pocket and stand up hand to it over. I watch as he taps icons on the screen.
“Oh my God! Sherlock, what are we going to do? Maybe we can get somebody to do ours after they finish their own?”
“Exactly,” Mrs. Hudson says. “Which is why, as I said, it’s time.” She clinks her teacup down into its saucer decisively. “They’re expecting us this Tuesday at two for prep, and air time is at 8:30. I told them I’d make sure you came.
“John Watson, isn’t it?” The older boy’s voice was smooth and posh, and John realized that he knew him: Mycroft Holmes, a seventh year.
“When would you like to start not needing the other bed?” I nip the skin of his neck, and his breath catches. “Because, you know…now would work, for me.”
So: necessary. And yet so terribly unpleasant to be the one causing John distress. It’s a relief to finally abandon scientific detachment and go and let John out of the lab and explain the illusion. John recovers quickly, pulling himself together with his usual gorgeous strength of will. Sherlock spares a moment to admire it before getting on with commandeering some lab space. If he can identify the compound in the sugar, he may be able to trace its origin, and then they’ll know who killed Henry’s father. He has to move quickly, as there’s a good chance his entering Baskerville has alerted the killer that he’s close to a solution, and it wouldn’t do to have the perpetrator force a confrontation before the proof has been secured.
“Yes,” Sherlock says. Then, more sharply, “Yes. Well, it may have some bearing. We have some leads we’ll be looking into tomorrow morning. May we be shown to our rooms, please?”
“Maybe a bit. But then how did I get away with my crimes?” I can’t resist a little eyebrow waggle, but he’s immune to my infectious excitement. Ah, well.
“My dear fellow,” I interrupted him, turning over in his arms. “You may presume anything you like.” With that, I pressed my lips to his. He met my kiss with a soft sigh, his body relaxing against me. His lips opened sweetly to the touch of my tongue, and I kissed him deeply, heedless of his sleep-sour mouth and stubbled skin. Oh, the pleasure of it! Countless times I had imagined this, torturing myself with fantasies of the unobtainable, but nothing my poor brain had conjured could approach the true experience.
Let us now, as though by a scrying charm, cast our vision into the quarters they share. We see first that the room is round, topmost in the southwest tower of the faculty wing, for Professor Holmes likes privacy, and Watson likes the view of the lake and the open hills, rolling away and away. There is a rumor—an untrue one, though they have never denied it—that they turn themselves into ravens and fly about the grounds on fine autumn evenings.
In early April of 1998, John was captured. He was taken to a dungeon beneath an old castle that belonged to a pureblood family of ancient name. What need had they for their Dark Lord, John wondered, when they already had wealth and power beyond what ordinary folk could hope for? In that place, they broke his wand (oak, eleven inches, dragon heartstring, firm). In that place, he was tortured. In that place, Dementors toyed with him, sipping his soul away drop by drop, so that he would have lost his own name and succumbed to madness, if not for the one thing he still had, the one secret thing they could not find and could not take away: the little vial of Panacea Potion, which he had carried with him for so long that it thought itself a part of him and was thus invisible. In that dark place he drank it, drop by drop, to renew what his tormentors took from him, and so he lived until, on the day he drank the last drop and finally despaired, Voldemort was destroyed at the Battle of Hogwarts. After that, he only knew they no longer came to hurt him, and he slept, and starved, and was finally found and freed three days after the victory.
The conversation moved on to John’s job prospects, and Mike was able to give him a few leads.  John followed up on these as best he could, then did some grocery shopping.  When he got back to the flat, Sherlock was nowhere to be seen, so John passed the evening alone.  He resisted the urge to explore Sherlock’s inner sanctum, the first floor bedroom, but he did snoop thoroughly through the kitchen cupboards, moving things around enough to put away the shopping.  He shifted various coffers and jars of organic matter, some vegetable and some unmistakably animal in origin.  There didn’t seem to be any order to the way Sherlock kept his things, yet somehow he was certain Sherlock would not welcome his tidying up, so he only touched what he had to, leaving the rest in place (although he did pick up and admire, with a certain macabre satisfaction, a quart jar full to the brim with what appeared to be the desiccated eyeballs of goats).  Sherlock’s experiment of the morning was still laid out on the kitchen table, the three bowls now coated with different colored residues, so John ate his bachelor’s supper in one of the sitting room armchairs, gazing thoughtfully at the empty seat opposite.
But Sherlock was in one of these places for a year. I suppose this case must bring back memories for him, likely quite bad ones, but if he’s feeling anything in particular, he doesn’t show it. I see him smiling, though not at me. If we were on good terms, I’d ask him about his school memories, later, when our heads are on our pillows. But we’re not on any such terms, are we.
“So what do you want to wager?” he asks. He’s in his element, a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth, chin tucked into the collar of his coat. I don’t actually expect to win this bet.
,” John moans. “He desires you exquisitely.” And then he gasps and grunts and his weight drives Sherlock down almost back onto the bed. John’s cock pulses hard and suddenly wet inside him, pressing just a hair too far, and Sherlock whimpers with heat and confusion and loneliness.
“It’s just,” said Sherlock, and stopped to swallow, his mouth unaccountably dry. “When we’re both Alpha. Sometimes it seems like you might want—” He waved his hand vaguely rather than complete the sentence.
“Of course,” Sherlock rumbles, leaning into him, and John sighs and shivers a little. Sherlock nips him beneath the ear, and John gives a tiny gasp. “Bedroom, then? I’ve got loads of other stuff in that drawer.”
did he take that cigarette from Mycroft?) He desperately wants to search the flat for bugs again, but now that he knows someone is watching, it’s not that simple. If they see him searching, they’ll know they’ve been found out. Coventry all over again.
“Oh, I see,” said John, beginning to understand.  “You cottoned on that enslaving other sentient beings might not be quite ethical.”
“Okay,” I say, letting his words sink in. Shit. I’d wondered how Irene was able to tell me things about their plans without alerting Mycroft. No wonder he wanted the phone back so badly. “So, you want me to tell Sherlock what, exactly?”
“Sherlock?” he asked, with some hesitation. Sherlock opened his eyes and looked up expectantly from where he was lying on his back on the sofa.
We finish up soon after. Instead of bringing the bill, the waiter tells us that the meal is on the house, and fervently wishes us a “lovely evening.”  Out on the pavement, a little crowd has gathered. Not enough to block the flow of traffic, just a cluster of nervous gawkers. I spot Vanessa standing casually nearby, keeping an eye on things under the pretense of checking her phone. Nobody bothers us.
Anthea drives me back to Baker Street. As I’m steeling myself for another round with Sherlock, I find a yellow envelope lying on the front steps. Breaking the elaborate red wax seal releases a cascade of powdery crumbs, like bread crumbs. Strange.
“Well he’s in trouble now,” Sholto said. “Still, I take your point. I’ll put a word in with the interrogators.”
John thought for the rest of the afternoon about what Mike had said. Teach—the very idea! But Hogwarts…John tried to imagine it. As a kid the lives of the professors had seemed practically unreal. But now, piecing together the bits of his memories, he found that he could form a picture of them: ordinary (if quite skilled) witches and wizards, with friendships and rivalries. Colleagues, idealists, hermits. Perhaps. Perhaps.
Some time later, John falls asleep in his seat on the train. Sherlock looks up from his phone when he hears the change in his breathing. Some people become more beautiful when sleeping, but John Watson isn’t one of those, at least as far as Sherlock is concerned. Bereft of animating spirit, his features are slack and plain. He looks older, not younger. On an impulse, Sherlock coughs loudly and jabs John with his elbow. John grunts awake.
“It just seems like the sort of plan that would be hatched by an egomaniac with no real understanding of human emotions. No offense.”
I’m not sure what any of it means, except for the obvious fact that Brook wants to draw Sherlock’s attention. And oh, he gets that in spades. Sherlock broods intensely on the news of Moriarty’s return. I’ve gotten used to a rather cuddly physicality with him, but now he switches to a purely cerebral mode of being, hardly eating or sleeping, never touching. He’s twitchy and difficult, taciturn, sharp.
I’ve gotten so accustomed to the feeling that everyone is watching us that this almost feels like old times. The food and wine are fine; just your basic nice restaurant sort of stuff. I get filet mignon and Sherlock has some kind of stuffed duck breast thing with dark red sauce squirted around it.
“You are still powerful,” Mycroft said, more quietly.  “Anyone defeating you would gain the respect of his peers.  And they’d have a card to play against the Holmses--”
