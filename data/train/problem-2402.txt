"Did he say anything while he was awake?" Mycroft asked, hoping the answer would help rule out any kind of brain damage. Sherlock had been lucky enough to keep his cognitive and motor abilities intact after Moran's brutal attempt on his life, and he had cheated death on many occasions following that. Though Mycroft's temperament did not allow him to believe in nonsensical concepts like karma or fate, he was sometimes plagued by the nagging feeling that someday Sherlock was going to run out of luck. Perhaps that day had indeed arrived.
“That’s it!” he shouted to the pilot. “Find a place to land!”
Anthea nodded, though she had already predicted his answer and chosen it for him. Hell, an idiot could have predicted it.
Sherlock looked no different than the previous night, with the exception of the ventilator being gone. In its place was a simple nasal cannula, securing a flow of supplemental oxygen to aid the younger Holmes' respiration. Mycroft could not see a portable oxygen canister and thus assumed the oxygen was delivered through a wall connection via a flowmeter. Sherlock's breathing was slightly laboured, but considering the amount of dirt extracted from his airways, anything less than "laboured" would have been a miracle.
Sherlock and John deal with the consequences of their little romp.
“That’s a rather ignorant statement to be making about the place, John!” Sherlock made a theatrically insulted expression. “After all, not all of the Appalachian mountain range is like an excerpt from a shoddy horror film.”
Of course, Sherlock considered. With only three members of their clan - the third appearing to be relatively useless in comparison - killing off anyone within their group would only be a last resort. Still, the massive alpha had been dead serious in his threat, because his smaller companion had finally acquiesced.
Limbs were splayed out like an animal ready to be skinned. Licking the split of his lip and gums, Sawtooth lowered his hand and slowly inserted a finger into the whore. He relished the squeal which escaped the quivering body he had penetrated, as well as the near vibration of pain around his finger. He removed his hand... and inserted two fingers.
"Well, the trip itself wasn't originally going to involve this amount of forest," John said, not without a certain level of exasperation. "Also, the trip wasn't originally supposed to turn into a case."
Mary playfully slapped him on the shoulder, though the blow was a little harder than usually delivered, and John gave a yelp of surprise.
They only circled for three seconds before the three-fingered man lunged forward. John reacted on pure instinct, letting his training take over. They struggled, and the doctor felt the long, broken, filthy fingernails digging into his skin, causing new sores which allowed germs to be transferred between them.
Looking a little defeated, Nasim put his hands in his coat pockets and turned to a nurse.
Despite knowing he would provoke Father's wrath for going against his wishes, Three-finger cared little. He could take whatever punishment Sawtooth choose to dish out for his disobedience. Be it a beating or a week of starving. He could take it. The safety of the clan mattered more.
, he thought to himself.
The woman smiled. “If you say so.” She leaned forward and their lips met. John eagerly carded his fingers through her wet hair, kissing her back.
The sun was setting behind the hills and treetops, and she felt the need to look over her shoulder several times to make sure no one was following her. Even though the place had felt relatively safe in the day, the resort was still in the middle of nowhere, and the darkness made it all the more unsettling. Mary had taken the chance to ask a staff member about the guidelines of the resort’s etiquette, and as expected, Avalon was expected to be anything but a swingers' club. Even so, as evidenced by the men who had approached her, some rule-breakers still slipped through the cracks.
By the time he was finished, he could hear the familiar grumble of the clan's truck coming down the way. Sawtooth and Three-finger had gone off for some errand that One-Eye could not quite remember, but they promised to be back soon, but "soon" did not translate very well for the simple man. Soon sometimes felt much longer, and ideas for what to do in order to pass the time were few and far in between.
Glancing toward the now closed shed, hiding the macabre sight within, John was struck by a thought. He did not want to go back into the shed, never again. And yet…
After all, John had clearly shown guarded interest in the male gender in the past, though he thought he had hidden such interest... but he clearly had not enacted upon it in years. Allowing the doctor to penetrate would be fitting for the transition. The sex had been good, excellent in fact, but as soon as affectionate hands tried to stroke him in the post-coital bliss, he shrugged off the attention.
The huge mountain man proceeded to manually part his lips, as though inspecting his gums and remaining teeth. Seemingly pleased with his findings, the giant withdrew and turned his back on his captive, muttering some unintelligible command to his two smaller relatives. The scrawny psycho took the idiot's hand - the uninjured one - and tugged, first gently and then with growing impatience, as the oaf seemed much more interested in the proceedings involving Sherlock than anything else.
The generator growled on in a room connected to the main space of the cabin, and already Sherlock was thinking about dismantling the thing to somehow gain an iota of control over these filthy, primitive bastards.
“Critton-Owl Hollow Road,” Sherlock corrected him, his tone quite irate. “We did not need to stop for directions.”
COOLEX ANTIFREEZE was printed on the label in bold blue letters, though he could not read or decipher the letters themselves. He knew what the fluid was used for, and what could happen if someone were to drink it. Three-finger experimentally shook the bottle, listening to the slosh of the chemical within. It would be enough. Grabbing an nearby roll of industrial tape, he strode to the bed where the Outsider lay. The little whore's eyes were closed, but he had visibly winced at the sound of someone approaching.
After nearly half an hour, Sherlock finally returned. His dark curls, normally so messy, were plastered to his skull like a helmet, further accentuating his unusual facial structure, and his pale skin was bright pink in spots from the heat of the shower. The most striking thing, however, was that the detective was naked. Unashamed of this fact, Sherlock proceeded to throw his wet towel into a corner.
Yes, we finally have an update! To compensate our loyal readers for the long absence, we will provide you with a longer-than-average chapter. Enjoy!
Sherlock slowly opened his eyes, and it took him a moment to recollect the recent events and orient himself. He was lying on his side on a cold, dry wooden surface, and though he could see absolutely nothing, he sensed that he was enclosed in a tight place with a dank, musty smell. Most likely underground, or at the very least on ground level. His hands were tied behind his back, secured firmly by duct tape, as were his legs, tied together both at the knees and ankles, which left him about as mobile as a caterpillar. A piece of the tape had been placed over his mouth as well, its polyethylene taste seeping through his lips.
His sobs muffled by the pillow, he realized his weeping was not going to be easily stopped when he recognized John's scent in the fabric. Face twisted in despair, he threw the pillow across the room, though it obviously did not break upon hitting anything, so the energy spent gave him neither relief or release. He found another cushion and clung to it as though it provided him the very air he breathed, and he concentrated on his breathing, deep and slow, desperate to think of something else - anything - besides John.
His prey's fear aroused the giant mountain man. It never took much to break an Outsider's resolve. If all else failed, the following would do the trick every single time. Sawtooth leered, exposing his row of misshapen teeth, and lifted his victim off of the hook which kept him upright.
John looked sad for a moment. "If you had, you would have been held back in Heathrow. We would have found out later about our motel room, but at least we wouldn't be here. We wouldn't be in this mess."
Sherlock tried to scream, but it came out as an unsteady wailing. He clawed at his tiny prison, but he was too weak. Struggling now only made the dirt come in, and he did not want to knock the hose out of the opening. He was being buried alive. And the hose... was it to keep him alive until they (they? who were they?) decided to bring him back up? Was it to keep him alive until...
"It's not just about myself, John," Sherlock argued, standing up and entering the bedroom. "You'll starve to death too. Perhaps not as quickly as me..."
What difference did it make? He was not going anywhere.
"What does that look like to you?" Sherlock accepted his cup of coffee and took a sip, but without taking his eyes off the screen.
Sherlock gave the best head. That was an undisputable fact. No one before him had possessed the same skill and technique, the ability to have John fighting back a climax less than a minute into the blowjob. Sherlock's mouth was made for it, even more than it was made for incessant talking.
The mountain man's face pressed against his as he reached at his belt for something, and when the object was removed, Sherlock realized he might just get his wish. An old revolver was cocked in the maniac's mismatched hands, and as it was aimed right between his eyes, Sherlock was resolute to keep his eyes open, to look past the gun and at his killer.
Once his vision had become clear, he began to truly feel the relief of being in a hospital room. However, he was not alone in his thoughts for more than two seconds before he realized he had a visitor. Upon recognition he wondered if he really was in hell.
"We've investigated for quite a while," John noted aloud, not without a little trepidation. "We should get going."
The decapitated corpse had been mutilated to the point that it was impossible to tell if it was male or female. Strung up by its ankles, the amount of dried blood on the floor below it strongly suggested that the killing had taken place in the shed. The body was virtually devoid of soft tissues, further hindering identification.
John hardly felt the sensation of his bonds being untied, and he wobbled for a moment when his feet met the ground. He glanced down at his waist where the idiot had bitten him, and though the skin was not bleeding outright, it had been broken and was now quite red. If the detective and his assistant were to get out of this hellish ordeal alive, they might just die of infection from God knew what bacteria lingered in the mouths of these men.
What if John had simply run off to save his own skin? Had the doctor reached that level of apathy to not care about anyone but himself?
"Yes, sir."
“Yes, yes!”
Sherlock was struggling now, slithering in the giant's grasp like a possessed snake. He had to know what was coming, and the knowledge made him frantic. With his wrists still bound, the amount of resistance he could offer was rather limited, and the strength in his blows, though fuelled by panic, had no effect on his captor's huge, muscular body.
“Not a problem. This resort doesn’t seem to have security cameras."
Mycroft felt momentarily lightheaded when he rose to his feet to exit the helicopter, now safely on the ground, but he was adamant not to let it show. Not to Anthea, and most certainly not to the men - Americans - who were escorting him. Mycroft would have preferred to have been accompanied by his own British specially trained unit, but there hadn't been enough time to pull the right strings, and Mycroft Holmes, a man who valued diplomacy whenever possible, had quickly made the decision to accept the help the Americans offered. He'd been promised "the best out of the best", and although he didn't trust these men like he trusted the ones he'd picked himself, they seemed to know what they were doing. Mycroft appreciated the fact that none of them had made an attempt to initiate small talk inside the helicopter.
Mary swallowed, her eyes distant, and she glanced at her incompletely adorned state.
"Fuck you!" John hissed with such vehemence that the detective actually took a step back from him, visibly startled. "You're no better than they are, you fucking sociopath! You're probably even pleased she's dead!"
“Alright,” she said. “Sleep well.”
Three-finger was still angry when he left the cottage to go scouting, and that anger grew when he was left with time to himself. He wanted to kill something, destroy it, grind it into the ground and tear it apart, limb by limb.
John worked tirelessly for hours, scraping away hard-packed dirt with a measly little carving instrument whose intended use was probably something very different. Still so much better than doing it with his bare hands, though. John had to bite back a cry of triumph when he'd finally managed create a hole large enough for his arm. A few more hours of hard work, and he would have his freedom. He and Sherlock.
"Thankfully, these photos were taken at high resolution. So one would hope that we won't lose much data when we zoom in." He looked back at John for a moment. "It also helps that your girlfriend did some adjustments on the shadowy bits."
"You first," he said, glancing at the hole his friend has spent the better part of the night digging. They would fit. Maybe.
“Alright,” he said, his voice quiet. His mouth suddenly dry, he swallowed and looked up at her once more, not finding those angry, betrayed eyes any less difficult to speak to. “You said it perfectly earlier. This trip wasn’t just to be taken lightly. I wanted to go with you across the ocean because I want to be with you.”
"I'm not crazy, John!" Both Sherlock's voice and face now disclosed his desperation, that he was no longer defensive, but frankly terrified. He grasped the sheet in his lap and held it to his chest hard enough to make his knuckles whiten. Then he began to rock back and forth, unaware of the motion himself. John took the opportunity to sit down next to him.
Mycroft had tacitly accepted that it would be a while before his brother could be returned to London, assuming he ever could. Until he was sure Sherlock would live, he did not want to waste resources.
Sherlock’s face screwed up in confusion. “What the hell are you talking about?”
Trees, trees, mountains of trees… occasional clearings in the seemingly endless forest caught his attention, but they always appeared to indicate nothing of importance. A man with any less self-restraint might scream. Mycroft simply kept searching.
These three twisted men did not believe in anything besides degradation and suffering. John wanted to move, but the raw pain had spread from his right shoulder into the rest of his body, including his three uninjured limbs, rendering them practically useless. He watched the giant raise the shotgun, take aim… but before any shots were fired, the salivating little madman grabbed both his ankles and jerked him forward, thus disrupting the alpha's plans.
"Oh, I wouldn't say 'nothing'," Sherlock countered and finally rose to his full height beside John. "I can discern tracks from three different individuals--"
"What did you do, John Watson?" Mycroft snarled, his posh, public school accent laced with something that could only be described as primal. "I'm going to find out anyway, so you'd do well to remember it's in your best interest to tell me the truth."
"Umm..." John's brow screwed up in confusion as he too intently studied the pixels. Yet he could not see anything even remotely resembling, well, anything. "Branches, leaves... perhaps part of a tree trunk?"
Anthea did not answer. She knew her employer's body language and personality inside and out, and though she had her own opinions about John Watson's validity to Sherlock's recovery, she kept them to herself. If anything, Mycroft likely agreed with her - albeit begrudgingly - that John and Sherlock should reunite. But that was not up for discussion now.
John's brow lifted a little in disbelief. "Considering what he did to Sherlock, I'm a little surprised that you didn't have him done away with."
He woke by the alarm on his phone, finding hospitality's wake-up courtesy call unnecessary, and promptly rose to take a shower. The main windows were sealed shut, of course, but a tiny window in the bathroom had hinges and a screen for ventilation. Mycroft realized, however, that he should have kept it closed. Immediately amidst the scents of soaps and shampoo was a stench, like soggy moldering refuse. Shutting the window despite the inevitable steam fog, he knew the odour had to have come from the supposedly scenic river the hotel overlooked.
The length of the title of John’s book (it’s obviously quite long!) would be fitting for something along those lines, too.
But the list of, shall we say, ‘interesting’ sculptures doesn’t end there. The second one on the list is...
The guy may be the frightened, pessimistic part of Sherlock, but even he has learned that his heart (John) can protect him. (Or maybe I’m just a romantic, too.:))
In other words, John doesn’t want his and Mary’s ‘baby’ (=relationship) to be ‘brought’ on a case. He doesn’t want his and Mary’s relationship to interfere when he’s up and about with Sherlock. He wants his and Mary’s relationship to stay away from him when he’s together with Sherlock. As far away as possible.
So, what we have is the Goddess of Love literally watching over Cleopatra (Sherlock) and Mark Antony (John) and blessing their love and sex life. Nice!
The fact that there are parallels between the show ‘Sherlock’ and s10 of ‘Doctor Who’ has already been discussed. (
(More under the cut...)
We see Sherlock and his mirror Soo-Lin, and the freaking Apollo Belvedere (yellow circle) is looking right over their shoulder to make sure that we really, really get it: Hey, dear viewer, when we were talking about Andy’s sexual/romantic interest in Soo-Lin we were actually talking about Sherlock.
Lawrence was martyred, ie, he died for a higher cause – his Christian beliefs, as personified by the little angel above him in the painting...
If TBB, an episode that’s so important for
They’re talking about the ‘baby’, but what Sherlock means is the potential, future love that John is going to have in his life. Sherlock wants that love to have the name Sherlock.
Sherlock is certain.
Like the one they already chose to include in ‘The Blind Banker’, which we’ve discussed here:
This meta was originally posted on my tumblr (sagestreet) on: 11 March 2017
By the way, did you notice the cage a few moments later?
And that’s possibly the most brilliant part of this whole scene: They were brought on by Alex’s laser surgery!
This meta was originally posted on my tumblr (sagestreet) on: 6 December 2019
pointed out to me (here:
And Mofftiss will be the first ones to adapt 3GAR for the screen, but they will flip it. John will believe Sherlock is deadly injured and show his love for Sherlock.
There’s one other thing I would like to at least mention: Vermeer’s paintings are deeply, deeply metaphorical. I think I counted up to a dozen different metaphors in that last one I was staring at.
So, which one is the ‘murderer’, then? Which aspect of John was it, in Sherlock’s opinion, that made Sherlock fall in love?
So, consider this: Sherlock asks whether John could make a phone call to the ‘baby’. Obviously, this makes no sense whatsoever on the surface level of the text. Babies can’t answer the phone.
Please don’t expect me to go back to weekly postings any time soon. But I hope this little blog post about art (and, ahem, cocks) was a fitting St.Nicholas present to find in your hopefully cleaned boots today, on December, 6th. I mean, come on, I literally gave you a...cock in boots, right?
...and this:
), I had elaborated on this Venus sculpture: It represents the half-hidden, yet also in-plain-sight kinda subtext of the show BBC ‘Sherlock’. (That’s why it’s literally covered in code.)
Mrs Hudson (who has always been a John!mirror) says, “They never come out when I take them.”
There is a light blotch on the cover that instantly reminded me of something. That’s because it has the exact same shape as the
I think it was LSiT (and other bloggers) who suggested that the bust in Magnussen’s Mind Palace could represent Sherlock.
to its left (green circle), the Rome picture above the fireplace ended up in the frame because it’s always there and they just picked this room because it’s such a grand and luxurious space.
is just hilarious.
has already brilliantly summarised some parallels from ‘The Pilot’
has discussed some truly mind-boggling parallels from ‘Smile’
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the humour of a snotty-nosed 13-year-old...or Mofftiss when you really think about it.
(By the way, if you’re into EMP, which you don’t have to be, but personally I’m more and more drawn to this theory...so, if you’re into EMP, this gets even better, because then this sculpture isn’t sitting in Magnussen’s Mind Palace at all. It’s sitting in Sherlock’s Mind Palace. This is how he sees himself! ‘The Muse of the Dance of Love’. Good God! Save me...My poor heart!)
Well, Hadrian was so utterly destroyed by Antinous’ death that he had him deified. I’m not sure John will go quite so far in his grief between TRF and TEH, but it’s pretty close, I guess.
Now is the point where the under 18-year-olds amongst you should probably stop reading, by the way. (Also, the ones who roll their eyes at crude sex jokes.)
And this aspect of John (this intellectually ‘shortsighted’ brain aspect of John) is not the one that metaphorically ‘killed’ Evans, ie, this is not who Sherlock fell in love with. Or so Sherlock tells himself here.
So, while ‘having a bit of respect’ isn’t exactly wrong, treating him like a fossil behind glass would be.
Coincidence?
All three people on the inside are Sherlock.
Similarly, if Mofftiss actually go there with John, that will be their way of telling us, “We’re good at the art of perspective thing. Pay attention to it.” (And it’s obvious that the makers of Sherlock know their art history, as I discussed
Or maybe both interpretations of the metaphorical ‘laser surgery’ (John’s realisation about himself because of James Sholto and John’s realisation about his feelings for Sherlock after TRF) are right at the same time. Who knows...
mean something. But it could also be a coincidence. It’s just an idea.
Hermes is the lord of dreams.
He has been shown with his typical attributes so often that we can’t think of him as a living human being anymore.
I think the Vatican cameo in BBC ‘Sherlock’ is this statue of Antinous, the gay God, in TBB, which we discussed here:
John (=Sherlock’s heart) complains about what Eurus does. Eurus throws the third Garrideb into the ocean, too. And then literally tells John (=Sherlock’s heart), “Does it really make a difference condemning the innocent instead of the guilty...Let’s see...No, that feels pretty much the same.”
I think that’s a brilliant little parallel. And I’m pretty sure that whoever staked out the location for this ‘Sherlock’ scene knew exactly why this tapestry had to appear right at the beginning of it.
Ta-daaa!
), we get a metaphor for John’s dual sexual nature again.
In other words, Howard Garrideb is John’s emotional state, as seen through Sherlock’s lens. Howard, the drinker with the shaking hand, is John’s emotions and feelings (they are obviously not in a good place).
(Thank you
The ‘Apollo Belvedere’ bust and the magnifying glass alone made me almost hyperventilate from a ‘Sherlock’ subtext overload.
What does that tell us about how Sherlock feels about John entering into a relationship with Mary?...Yeah, exactly!
But it could also be a reference to our old ‘dog’ metaphor (remember how I proposed that all dogs on the show are metaphors for homosexuality here (
Needless to say that in ACD’s original canon story, Alex was not the murderer. The murderer was actually called John (!) Garrideb (which wasn’t his real name, he was the killer). Haha! So, Mofftiss thought they could be sly by changing the name ‘John’ to ‘Alex’ so that we wouldn’t catch on quite so quickly. Sweet. They didn’t want to make the puzzle too easy by naming the ‘murderer’ John. But whatever...
While this isn't technically about a painting used in the set design of BBC 'Sherlock', I did, in fact, argue in the last chapter that the sculptures appearing on 'Doctor Who' were deliberately chosen with a 'Sherlockian' perspective in mind. So, I thought I could maybe stick this little meta in here; it seems quite fitting after the last chapter took a stab at examining the parallels between Moffat's two shows. Even if you're not a Whovian at all, I think this painting might give us a little hint that the two shows have to be read as one.
Whenever Sherlock and John talk about the ‘baby’, they talk about their (=John and Sherlock’s) relationship. Whenever Mary and John talk about the baby, it’s their relationship they talk about.
To make sure we get that joke about it being half-hidden, yet also in-plain-sight, the set designers specifically chose the ‘Aphrodite of Knidos’ by Praxiteles (
In the end (at the end of ‘Faust II’), though, this turns out to be wrong: The devil who comes to collect Faust’s soul, which he has desired for so long, doesn’t get it.
What if this is Moffat showing us his ‘self-portrait’? The portrait of a master (metaphorical paint-brushes in hand) who is nearing the end of his journey, too (he will quit ‘Doctor Who’ as showrunner after series 10!). The portrait of a man who has to juggle two worlds, too. Two worlds, two universes: ‘Doctor Who’ and ‘Sherlock’. Two shows that are two worlds for him.
The lions=John
Well, I have just noticed something about said menu. For this, I have edited the original photo just a tiny bit:
it will, this will be an allusion to different perspectives happening simultaneously on the show.
That is incredibly important because it tells us that Sherlock has learned an important lesson here. Sherlock is really, really trying to understand love here. And he has learned that love doesn’t work in a logical way. That both the ‘innocent’ and the ‘guilty’ aspects of John are the same to him. Whether they are the personality aspects that metaphorically ‘murdered’ Sherlock (=made him fall in love with John) or whether they are the personality aspects that Sherlock didn’t fall in love with at first DOESN’T REALLY MATTER.
And we thought the Vitruvian Watson collage was good. Ha!
Remember who the ‘devil’ is on BBC ‘Sherlock’? According to TAB (and according to all the apple-carving in TRF), the ‘devil’ is Moriarty himself.
Lawrence allegedly told his executioners.
Another ‘Venus pudica’. Same subtext.
These are further water-themed (!) paintings (and one landscape). (Yellow circle:
) about the five Sherrinford tasks. Although I think the broader assumption I made in that meta about the five tasks mirroring the five series of the show still holds water. But where I went wrong back then was specifically in assuming that this case was about an actual, real-life murder.)
(Obviously, Sherlock only expects this subconsciously. Consciously, he will only work out that he has fallen in love at John’s wedding when it’s literally ‘too late’=delayed action stabbing.)
Oh, and there’s also a nice shot of the sculpture’s, erm, shapely backside in case you’re wondering:
In other words, we get two (!) ‘Venus pudica’ style statues in BOTH ‘Doctor Who’ AND ‘Sherlock’.
A painting of
In ASiP, John had an actual (!) tan. And Sherlock realised John had been to a war zone (either Afghanistan or Iraq) because of it.
So, Nathan, we are told, wears glasses. He is shortsighted. That’s why he couldn’t have killed Evans.
John is seeing his therapist!
(See the end of the chapter for
In the next scene, Mrs Hudson, too, tells us what to think of John and Mary’s ‘baby’ (=relationship).
Then, as John runs away from the ghost
That’s beyond brilliant, isn’t it? Somebody on that set must have had a lot of fun with these.
And when I say heartbroken, I mean heartbroken about being in love with Sherlock. Obviously. John’s NOT heartbroken about his girlfriend-du-jour. That would be ridiculous!
Do you see how this CAN’T BE A COINCIDENCE? It was filmed like this on purpose.
Scenario A is the simpler one, obviously.
, don’t you think?) So, we know that we can’t be off track when we interpret the lion in the banker’s office in the exact same way: A guardian.
In the patience grenade scene in TFP, we get one tiny little mention of the ‘baby’ which is even sweeter. (And will make you go Awww in a second...wanna bet?:))
But that's not the point!
There’s a painting in the Doctor’s study in ‘The Pilot’ (s10ep1) which definitely didn’t end up there by accident:
It makes no difference which parts of John Sherlock thought he loved and which parts of John Sherlock thought he didn’t.
There is also the fact that there are two riders depicted in the foreground of this Cornwall painting, travelling companions who are perfectly in sync and have something vaguely Watsonian and Holmesian about them, as you can see in this section of the painting:
In all previous seasons we have seen only glimpses of Sherlock’s true self; this episode is a watershed moment in which Sherlock finally realises that John will never leave him and that he can be who he is with John. We’ve seen a lot of the Sherlock’s official side, the public mask, but only glimpses of his emotional inner universe until this episode.
But this change doesn’t occur in a random type of way. Quite to the contrary, the change in meaning follows a precise pattern, and once you see it, you cannot un-see it. I promise.
And John seems really preoccupied with nappies here.
Sherlock (in his coma) is probably experiencing intense, severe chest pain and people are possibly trying to save his heart at that moment, and that pain and panic he physically feels in his body causes a dream about...John entering into a relationship with Mary.
Many metas have been written about Madame Vastra and Jenny on ‘Doctor Who’ and about how these two ladies were created by Moffat as intentional foreshadowing for the eventual outcome on BBC ‘Sherlock’.
You can practically hear Mofftiss cackle with glee.
This scene, right before they enter the Welsboroughs’ fancy villa, is very interesting, too:
I did read, and I loved it. Anyway...TAB is an incredibly multi-layered cake of symbolism, is what I was trying to say. There are layers upon layers in this one, and mine is just one reading among many.)
I mean this beauty here:
This scene tells us that, no matter how fucked-up a heterosexual relationship is (even if it shits all over your life) and makes both participants miserable as hell, it’s still more likely that that one will get the blessing of organised religion than a homosexual one. No questions asked.
Note how the ‘expectant father’ (=Sherlock!mirror) is
Both Sherlock and the dead body=two different aspects of Sherlock (the awake one in his mind palace and the unconscious one lying there)
Remember that whenever the ‘baby’ is associated with John and Mary, it’s their (!) relationship, not John and Sherlock’s, that it codes for.
Well, if this ASiP scene foreshadows Sherlock in an EMP at some point in the show, then the meta reading of this ASiP scene has to extend to EMP, as well.
What can the ‘baby’ metaphor tell us about John and Mary’s relationship?
), I thought we should take a closer look at this bust in ASiP, too.
And if you squint...
And yet they chose this particular one: a statue that depicts Antinous dressed as the God Osiris. Osiris – the God of the afterlife, the underworld and the dead, which foreshadows Sherlock’s “death” again.
Note how the ‘Apollo Belvedere’ bust is positioned right next to the Half-Faced Man here.
Canova’s ‘Venus Italica’ is best known for keeping half of herself covered up. Because Jenny (aka John) hides half of himself? :)
It’s this painting here:
Because...Who says that you have to choose? It doesn’t have to be one or the other! In art, it can be BOTH THINGS AT THE SAME TIME! Both meanings can be true.
And Sherlock doesn’t seem too enthusiastic about the ‘baby’ (=relationship) being born either; he looks rather shocked about the fact. And Mary tries to push Sherlock as far away from her and John’s ‘baby’ (=relationship) as possible.
We know that mirroring on this show doesn’t always work in the Exactly-one-supporting-character-B-mirrors-exactly-one-main-protagonist-A type of way. It’s not necessarily one mirror for one character.
Holy shit! I think I’ve just had a bit of a breakthrough when it comes to that odd Tbilisi hostage scene in TST. (Sorry, sorry, sorry I have to get this one out of my system before I can move on to Part 5 of my ‘Follow the dog’ meta series. I’m so excited about this.:) But don’t worry this one will be really, really short, I promise.)
. (You can find it here:
But what could it possibly mean? How does this pretty still life fit in with the gigantic peacock painting we’ve already discussed (
You do understand what I’m getting at, right? I mean, my meta writing is literally scraping the ‘bottom’ of the barrel now, sorry. You could say that I hit rock...erm, peach ‘bottom’. I would be ‘bummed’ out by it, but somehow I really don’t care.:P
...'The Muse of the Dance of Love’...
The same was done to the famous ‘Apollo Belvedere’ statue. The show had simply cut off its head and used it in 1x02 ‘The Blind Banker’:
Not only is this a man. It is THE man. Any
So, what is this lithe and lissome lad doing in a household of luscious lesbianism?
(As I said, everything about that painting is pure speculation. Nothing is certain there. So, again: I could totally be wrong on this one!)
And it doesn’t even matter if you read s4 as real (I don’t) or fake. It doesn’t matter if you think s4 is all in John’s head or all in Sherlock’s head (as I do). The ‘baby’ metaphor works either way. This metaphor is a perfect switch that, depending on its position, changes the electrical charge that’s running through it, ie, its meaning.
I’m actually astounded by how well the foreshadowing works here: Molly (the John mirror No. 1) is looking at Sherlock beating himself from outside of the room.
This masterpiece is the ‘Venus Italica’ (
That is one whopping statement. A statement of how sometimes you crawl back into the closet AFTER an important self-realisation. Out of sheer panic and fear. You crawl back into the closet after your eyes were metaphorically opened to something.
Suddenly this scene with Molly is so much more desperate and hopeless, right? Molly (the John!mirror No. 1) is holding the ‘baby’ (future relationship) and telling Sherlock right to his face that John would rather have that relationship with anyone but Sherlock.
John might allow that for now, but whenever he takes off with their ‘baby’ (=relationship) he takes his phone (=heart) with him. The relationship is one thing; what the heart wants is quite another, it seems.
Which again was foreshadowed in the same ASiP scene when Sherlock is literally trying to ‘get a reaction’ out of the body that’s lying there. (On the surface level of the text, Sherlock beats this dead body with a riding crop to see if bruises will form after death. But on a metaphorical level, he is trying to get a reaction out of himself, the ‘dead’ body. Just like John is when John is beating him in TLD. John, too, will be trying to get a reaction out of Sherlock in s4: He will try to wake him up.)
tells me that, in China, these lion sculptures are commonly interpreted as guardians. (BTW, our lion above looks a bit like
TBC...
Sherlock did not know exactly what time it was. The cabin was too dark to let in much sunlight, and the detective knew he had lost some time during his bouts of unconsciousness.
"Sexually frustrated divorcee with a mid-life crisis," he informed them. "At least two adult children she's not on good terms with. Recently had a liposuction based on the horizontal scar beneath her stomach, which, I believe, led to some medical complications. As well as stretched the skin of her belly to the breaking point. And she has her home in a proverbial pig sty!"
"I just want to help."
John was about to object but held his tongue when he thought the situation over: did he really want to put Sherlock in charge of a rental car in an - to them - unknown country? Just as impulsive as a driver as anywhere else, Sherlock was bound to at least cross a few speed limits assuming he didn't drive the car into a tree.
"And I just wanted the attention."
Panicked, One-Eye leaned over the pretty pale whore that he had thumped on the head. It wasn't moving. Grasping it by the shoulders, he shook the body a little to wake it. No response. Either his toy was in too deep a sleep to react... or he had broken it.
Sherlock glanced at John, and even though he hardly wanted to take part in the strife between his partner and Mary, he had to admit that John sitting there staring like a dead fish was bloody annoying. He cleared his throat, which apparently jarred John from his uncomfortable paralysis.
"Yes," the woman replied forlornly. She gave a joyless chuckle as she reminisced. "They were celebrating their wedding anniversary and decided to go exploring the woods. We all joked that because they were drunk they were trying to be kinky out there, having sex with the wildlife watching them."
Suddenly he was no longer so sure he wanted to eat at the restaurant.
"My type?!"
"What on earth do you mean?"
"I'm sorry, sir," the nurse spoke slowly, as if she were spelling things out for a child with attention deficit problems. Mycroft hated to think that was how she viewed him. "But we cannot allow you inside the O.R. It's against hygiene protocol."
Mycroft had put his mobile phone on mute to give himself a semblance of peace and quiet, and it was hardly a surprise that he had over a dozen missed calls from Whitehall by the time he settled down for breakfast. He'd have to delegate even more of his work to Anthea in order to cope with the increased workload now that he had Sherlock's care to arrange as well.
Sherlock noticed the emphasis on the word partner, but said nothing in regards to it.
His expression darkened, perhaps reliving a memory. John's squeezing of his hand caused him to look up.
Still, John had not been injured very seriously, at least not compared to Sherlock. Perhaps if he surprised the bony little maniac, he could toss it into the current. It might not kill the hunter, but the river might carry him downstream and thus far away.
"I would like to see him," he finally said.
“In the bag,” Sherlock replied, waving to the item on the floor just a few feet away.
As predicted, Mary promptly threw out John's pillow and bedspread, sending one final indisputable message that she did not want him in the same room with herself. Not that John could blame her.
"Of course," he answered. "We'll leave the contact information with your assistant...?"
John was close to despair, but before he could suffer the full impact of it, unconsciousness claimed him and, momentarily at least, obliterated all dark thoughts and guilt from his mind. It didn't matter anymore if he never woke up again.
"I'm sorry." Sherlock loosened his hold but did not let go entirely. His clammy fingers pressed against the pulse point in John's wrist, and the doctor wondered if he was doing it on purpose, perhaps to check John's stress levels.
“It’s right there,” she said, pointing at a small cluster of trailers beyond the main road, huddled amidst some trees and foliage. “The red one.”
Not only was this pale one smart, he was defiant too. Neither bode well whenever the clan held onto victims as sources of amusement. Even stupid prey could be difficult to control if they were rebellious. One-Eye had only been a few summers old when he happened into the path of a victim who was fighting back like a caged beast and had found an improvised weapon in the form of a barbecue fork. The event nearly cost the boy his life, but instead only robbed him of his left eye, and thus gained him his present name.
"Sarah is your best friend, isn't she?" Sherlock commented as the trailer door swung open. "You said yourself that she wouldn't keep any secrets from you. And we're investigating on your behalf, Ms. Ferguson."
The ending of this chapter is going to be a huge cliffhanger. Just thought I'd mention it. :) Keep the comments going, we really appreciate it!
“What do mean, they don’t serve food here?” John exclaimed the next morning, eyes wide with disbelief.
"The marks, John. Observe!" His long-fingered hands grabbed the doctor's head and turned it back toward the door. "The amount of dust present is consistent with the time the trailer has stood empty. Now look down. If anyone had opened this door after Sarah left, there would have been prior marks in the dust, as the door opens inward. Do you see?"
Mycroft had never believed in miracles.
"Camera..." Sherlock said, panting and making dramatic gestures with his hands. "Sarah's... Found it... by a trail. Pictures..."
No one other than Anthea noticed the soft thump of the elder Holmes' head as it lolled against the wall, nor the twitching of his limbs when he jolted back into consciousness thirty seconds later. She was tactful enough to pretend it had gone by her unnoticed.
"From Sebastian..." he replied, opening his eyes and quickly looked regretful. "From Moran."
"I know, dear," Mycroft said, struggling to keep the judgment out of his voice. He stood up and reached for his little brother's hand. "Let's get you cleaned up then."
"Come on, John!" the detective ground out. "Move!"
Mycroft swallowed down his impeding dark thoughts. A lot could happen in 24 hours…
Mycroft however looked uninterested in John's rant, or at the very least unimpressed.
"No," Mycroft said curtly. He didn't believe that Sherlock's history of drug abuse or mental illness was in any way relevant to his postoperative health status. "Apart from being slightly underweight, my brother is in good health."
The stench of decomposing flesh got worse as they snuck under the windows and to the side of the cabin where a small shed had been slapped together some time ago. The door was fastened shut, but not locked, likely to keep out small scavengers as predators were, as deduced, infrequent in this clan's territory. Sherlock walked right past it, taking a significant look at the path toward the backyard.
He felt Sawtooth enter him, immediately thrusting into his spindly body. He could take it, every plunge. He endured the treatment, as he always had, and listened to the peaceful snuffling and snoring of his brother, who lay blissfully unaware of what was going on. One-Eye had never in his life been approached, and Three-finger was glad for it. Instead, he locked eyes with his father's plaything, and the pleasure he felt at the terror on the whore's face was enough to help him reach a release of his own.
"Cabin's empty," an officer called out through a window. One more piece of the puzzle in place, both comforting and worrisome. The team "ordered" Mycroft not to explore, but he ignored them, walking towards a small shed nearby. Flies buzzed about it.
"Don't panic," John said - not without a little impatience - to his partner before following. Sherlock only sniffed indignantly and returned his attention to the laptop.
Medical staff wasted no time in their response to the call button and arrived within less than a minute. Whilst one nurse attempted to retrieve his IV so that it could be reinserted, another joined the civil servant in holding Sherlock down. The look on her face, more a frown than a glare, was directed right at Mycroft. She was looking to him for an explanation. Granted, the smeared blood on the sheets justified her mystification.
John had been suffering from occasional erectile dysfunction ever since he returned home from Afghanistan. He knew that his problems were psychological rather than physiological, since he had no trouble getting - or staying - hard when he masturbated, and the doctor he had consulted about his fears confirmed the diagnosis. His performance issues were due to a mental lock-up, probably a lingering result from the trauma he had undergone during his military service.
"We're at a nudist resort," he casually remarked upon noticing John's stare. "I suggest we try to blend in."
Another jab of a fingernail and John gave a muffled yelp. He was certain it had been in one of the wounds caused by the awl. Both of the man-child's meaty hands held the doctor's head forward, and his skinny relative pried open John's eyes with bony fingers. He did not bother wondering what filth was being transferred from fingers to eyes at present, not when the giant in front of him relentlessly, furiously ploughed into Sherlock, nails scraping against pale skin and leaving angry red marks.
"I imagine things were more than a little difficult, especially after your father died," he said. He was not pitying, but sympathetic. His opinions of Mycroft notwithstanding, the doctor knew the man still loved his brother... in his own way anyway.
A flicker of the past emerged in Mycroft's mind: an image of home, the home he and his brother knew decades ago. In the fleeting moment of regaining such a memory when the two of them were mere children, Mycroft Holmes responded to long practiced ritual. In a motion unbecoming of a dignified civil servant, he leapt onto the hospital bed and wrapped his arms around Sherlock's twisting body. Though he did not wish further physical harm, he knew he had to squeeze tightly or else his brother would break loose and try to hurl himself off the bed.
“Take it, whore, take it all,” he moaned. Sherlock leaned forward, tugging his assistant’s cock with him and making John cry out.
A thick, heavy lump grew in Sherlock's chest when he heard John practically denounce him, adamantly claiming that the whole thing had been a mistake. Did that refer to their past relationship as well? Did he regret ever meeting Sherlock Holmes? Did he mean so little that John was willing to cast him aside to instead pursue a relationship that had never even made it past the 'dating' phase?
"We've got something here!" It was J. Bening.
No. These were good people. Not everyone in these woods was a sadistic freak. He was safe now. …but Sherlock wasn't.
"I won't!" he growled from between tightly clenched teeth and simultaneously sent his tormentors an eyeful of hate. The mountain men of course ignored any attempts at defiance from their captive, and the skinny one poked him with the fork again, this time marginally harder.
“Sometimes,” he said jokingly. The GPS announced an upcoming exit, and as confirmed by the map, it was the correct one. “Almost there,” he said, changing the subject. “Not far to go once we reach the city.”
He can't keep doing this, Sherlock would think in their hiding places. The horrible thing their father would become from the drink needed to be stopped. But... damn it, Sherlock could not remember. Something about finally trying to face this awful towering man, shouting at him to stop...
"Because she's held on to it. Rich's assumed motive for murdering his wife would be to stop her from leaving. Sarah was not going to leave. If you were going to walk out on someone, would you keep their picture?"
When he finally gave a fleeting glance to the face on the screen, Mycroft's eyes had narrowed in a glare like a stern father who was attempting to get a confession from a badly behaved child.
Rolling onto his side, partly to get closer to the knife, partly to recoil out of instinct, he watched as the skinny hunter staggered to its feet, reeling a little from the impact of the butt of the leader's shotgun against its head. Even with a pain threshold like few other creatures, a concussion was not something to simply shrug off. Still, the maniac hissed and sputtered like a cat, yammering out some unintelligible argument, and stepped forward to once again challenge the giant. But following the blow to the head, the shorter hunter was now the slower of the two, and the clan leader grabbed his troublesome charge by the neck.
He trailed off as he rose to his feet. Wobbling for a moment once more, he put a hand to his forehead. For a second, John expected him to swoon.
"I did," Mary suddenly interjected. "My own camera runs on two double-A's."
Bobbi suddenly looked visibly troubled. "It's really just a bullshit story, Mr. Holmes. An urban legend, a campfire tale, something the kids tell their younger siblings to scare them. I didn't think to mention it, because knew you wanted hard facts, not silly rumours."
A few more seconds of fervent thrashing, and then the squirming body of the young detective went limp from the drug. Mycroft breathed a sigh of relief when he was finally able to let go and straighten himself. Normally he would have been ashamed of his brother's appalling behavior, but right now the elder Holmes could not be bothered with keeping up appearances; Sherlock was going to reach a state of notoriety amongst the hospital staff after this no matter what he said, and Mycroft could hardly blame them. Nurses were underpaid and overworked as was.
Whatever Sherlock was storing in his Aspirin bottle, it wasn't Aspirin.
Sherlock stood still as a pylon, waiting for the whistle of a kettle which was seemingly taking forever. He was beginning to hate the sound of John's voice.
Sherlock's response was a groan and an eye-roll. "Oh, shut it, John!" he exclaimed and pretended to swat his friend in the back of the head. It was the most animated Sherlock had been since last night, and while John knew it probably meant he would go back to being an unthinking arsehole, it was very much preferable to the apathetic Sherlock who didn't even bother looking for clues to a case.
Now the panic had returned. Mary pressed the accelerator down, but the car remained still as a stone and the tires spun in the mud without traction.
Missy froze for a moment, seemingly considering something, and Mycroft was just about to tell her to make herself scarce when she presented her suggestion.
He patiently waited for the Indian to explain further, determined to keep his features impassive and devoid of any emotion.
"Yes, that will do." Mycroft flexed his fingers, his hand feeling strangely naked without an umbrella in it. "I have business to attend to, but I shall be staying nearby. Thank you for taking care of him."
Perhaps I was somehow wrong, Sherlock thought. Perhaps this moronic lump of a man really was able to understand how to violate him...
"I don't need a bloody hospital!" Sherlock snarled from underneath the terrycloth which now covered his face. "John, hook the camera up to my laptop!"
Taking careful steps and keeping close to the ground, he crossed the space between tree and stump within five paces and closed his hands around the handle. He struggled for a second, feeling his heart rate increase, but finally pried the axe loose. The very moment it was in his possession, he ducked behind the stump itself, and he let loose a breath he had not realized he was holding.
The giant grumbled out an order and John felt relief as the smallest let go, landing on the floor again.
The boy considered. The offer almost had a certain superstitious ring to it, as though his brother's bed were a little invisible hovel of protection. Protection from other accidents... from their father, possibly. William wanted to believe he was too old to believe in such things, but the notion was terribly persuasive.
Perhaps it was the pain from the violation and missing tooth combined with a lack of food and water that was muddling Sherlock's brain, or maybe even the despair which was closing about him closer and closer following John's death, but the detective's doubt was becoming ever more powerful. It was snagging its curved thorns throughout his brain and making him wonder... had Mycroft been right? After all, words John had said concerning the importance of tenderness were proving to have merit... far too late.
He did not want to go back. But they would have to. Fists clenched, Sawtooth roared and turned away, taking his fury out on a nearby counter. Plates and cutlery scattered and crashed under his huge fist. The whore shivered and curled up; a weak attempt at protection from the dispersed shards.
The smallest of the three mountain men gamboled out from behind their prey, his movements much like the middle creature, except sped up to a hyper, erratic pace. It hurried over to the giant, who was fumbling with something metallic, as indicated by the sharp clattering noises made in the process.
"If you don't stop, you could hurt yourself," John pointed out. "And I'm not taking you to the A&E again."
John flinched as a scream filled the cabin, and he nearly cried out as well. He had no idea then whether the scream was more out of pain or humiliation, although it was clearly a combination of both. Again Sherlock struggled to escape, even to crawl away from under the crushing weight, but he was locked in the grip of a beast which barely deserved to be called a man, and he was going nowhere.
Sherlock was silent. His expression was unreadable, and John could not determine if he was taking the words to heart, or simply being his usual childish, stubborn self. He would not look at his assistant, so John knelt in front of him.
Sherlock moaned, the sound tapering into a whimper as he shut his eyes. He wanted to be asleep again, oblivious from the truth. He lifted a willowy, shaking hand towards his brother, grabbing at his sleeve and twisting.
No way out. The three-fingered beast before him knew it and grabbed John's neck, baring what few teeth it had and licking the man's skin as though savoring the flavor of a freshly cooked meal.
Sherlock crouched to look underneath the bed, his mouth pursed as he straightened himself.
This time Sherlock was silent. He continued kicking, this time with both feet, his expression blank. The kicking was vaguely reminding John of a child having a tantrum, which was not much of a stretch.
"Just keep digging," the detective said, his voice gentler this time. "Don't worry about me."
"Shh," he whispered. "We must be quiet now. Do you understand?" Mycroft held his grip, surprised at his own strength. After all, the younger Holmes was far stronger now than he had ever been the last time he needed to be restrained into stillness.
Returning to consciousness felt like a tiny taste of hell, the sensation of every fibre of feeling coming back utterly indescribable. At first John felt as though his eyes refused to open - perhaps they did - and when they finally opened, the room was a blur. Before his vision could properly adjust, he made out the steady beeping of an EKG and an unending hiss of a device strapped to his face. A ventilator. The only thought which he could process was that he must have needed it.
“Neither were we,” John reminded him. “We never made it past the sex. And I’m sorry if what we had was enough for you, because it wasn’t enough for me.”
Flaky, red marks left by the mountain man's scraggly, unkempt fingernails now crisscrossed John's arms and shoulders. He tried not to dwell too much on the different kinds of pathogenic microbes that in all likelihood dwelt beneath those fingernails, or if he would live long enough to find out.
"Our suspicions were correct," the younger man said gently. "Rumors have been going around for decades of something being in the woods.
“I can barely wait to be on the plane,” she replied with a wide grin. “we’ll finally be able to spend an entire week together.”
"He got sixteen years for attempted murder," Sherlock interjected. "Added to all those other felonies he'd been piling up for quite some time. The parole board will never accept his request. Either way, Mycroft has a say in things, and he'll make sure it doesn't happen."
The one-eyed creature yelped as it pulled the hand away, struggling at first, as Sherlock was determined to keep his grip. Sherlock was genuinely surprised. Either these monsters had some capacity - however small - to feel pain, or the thing above him was just incredibly annoyed.
"We tried to save it as best we could, but there's too much dead tissue. It would have to be removed below the knee. If we don't..."
"Has he been extubated now?"
"Yes, but suppose we're trespassing...?" John replied, already heading back from where they came.
A life with John Watson that did not include Sherlock Holmes was unlikely to become reality. Mary suspected that if pressed, John would choose Sherlock over her any day. Who was she trying to fool, thinking anything but the obvious? What did she have to offer? She was just Mary Morstan, a boring and mousy graphic designer. Certainly not mysteries and adventure. Or a penis.
TBC...
This will be within your control, he silently told himself. The actual discovery of the property from above had been the difficult part. The rest will be within your control.
"Well, aren't you a charmer!" Mary playfully exclaimed and gave him a mock-slap. "Oh wait! You're just trying to charm my pants off, aren't you, you naughty boy!"
John managed a small, joyless laugh at the thought. He could not help wondering if his friend had gone into histrionics over the fact that the catheter had required shaving part of his head.
Fortunately none of that had come to be. The little man had behaved in a predictably foolish way by returning to the den to rescue his companion. He had been an easy target for the experienced Three-finger, and Sawtooth felt something akin to pride when he thought about his eldest son and his skills as a hunter. He observed the way Three-finger dangled off of the heavier one, not giving it much thought after so many years of behaviour based merely off of impulse. His eldest got the job done, unlike the youngest, and thus had freer rein in the household. And if Three-finger's behaviour caused a few more cries of pain, then so be it.
Mycroft's first impulse was to slap William at the back of the head for his audacity, but he quickly quenched it, not wanting to take after their odious father. He had been rudely pulled from his much-needed sleep and could already feel a budding headache forming behind his eyes, but he would not resort to physical violence. His brother did not respect him, and likely never would, but Mycroft was not going to lower himself to the level of his four-year-old sibling and use his larger frame to bully William into submission. He was not a brute, after all. He was supposed to be the reasonable one. The adult.
"Perhaps they were being watched," Sherlock muttered. "And by more than just the hedgehogs."
Sherlock clung to his brother in a desperate but weak grip as he attempted to focus. The strangely random thought occurred to him that for having such issues with his weight, Mycroft had always possessed very thin, delicate wrists. The consulting detective could distinctly remember those wrists, recall the smell of almond moisturizing cream on them when both brothers were young.
