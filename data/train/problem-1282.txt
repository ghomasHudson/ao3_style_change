“You drank after work because of what I said the previous night,” the detective stated knowingly, and John didn’t argue. There was no point in trying to hide from the brilliant observations. To deny the facts would simply encourage the man to dig deeper into his findings.
“Sh...Sher…” John mumbled, thrusting himself into Sherlock’s hand.
I need you. Hurry. -SH
Breathlessly, he crashed into the mattress and pillow, semen coating his stomach and Sherlock’s hand.
Then, like all the previous times, when it was clear that John was pliant and willing, Sherlock took the attention away from John’s lips to suck seductively down his neck. This was about the time that Sherlock would pull away, leaving John aching without release, cautious that this was the part of their interactions that John had stopped that first time.
John lift his head slowly, his gaze slowly going up to meet blue eyes like his. But they hid something, they were darker than his; both in colour and in personality. He squint before making it form into a glare. She was smirking and he hated it.
“Because I have it myself. How's that for a scar?”
Sherlock's head popped up from the window with a slight smile.
“All love has been forgotten.” Sherlock mumbled as he looked at the pictures of John, Sherlock, and Mrs. Hudson on the fireplace.
Mycroft blinked a couple of times before looking away and shutting his slightly open mouth. He cleared his throat and looked back at Sherlock, who still looked dead and plucked at his violin.
"Wait, that- that was a joke."
“Who on Earth said to let her go?!”
Sherlock barely ate or drank anything anymore and Mrs. Hudson yelling at him to get out of his room to eat something wasn't helping either.
“So, when I tell you, you're gonna go back to Baker Street, get some sleep, eat a proper meal because you obviously haven't in days, and then get your arse back here at twelve or one in the afternoon. Got it?” Lestrade jabbed his finger into the table as he said ‘got it’, which earned him a harsh glare and a huff from Sherlock.
Redbeard.
“Yes, I'm Sherlock Holmes, the consulting detective, and I'm here to look at a cash register to make sure of something for a case.” Sherlock said quickly to the man who was staring at him like he was a mad man with an eyebrow raised. Confusion was colouring his eyes.
“How?” Sherlock asked calmly, frowning deeper than he originally was.
"You wanna see what it is? Who hurt you?" She asked in a voice that was meant to draw him in. John looked back up to her before dropping back to the paper. He nodded curtly.
"John."
He blinked and realized he was already parked at the station. He got out and sighed before looking up at the clouded sky. Once, just once could he solve a case without someone who’s not already dead getting murdered?
“The ink smudge on the paper, obviously.” Sherlock said to a Lestrade that looked very confused.
He was furious. His hands were fists by his sides. His eyes were cold and sharp, along with his breathing. He walked straight, the people in front of him moved out of his way with a worried glance.
"What do I want you to-" Sherlock now revealed his anger by gripping the file and literally tearing it open to reveal its inside contents. "Look at it, you fat idiot!"
Sherlock let out a frustrated growl and clutched the papers in his fist harder, glaring at the door which showed a particularly hated figure.
“WHAT?!” Lestrade exclaimed, slamming his hands into his desk and his eyes flinging open wide. His jaw dropped as he stared at Sherlock, who stared back with a slightly amused face. Lestrade knew he could and would deduce a couple of good deductions.
Seriously, it was three in the morning, the least John could do was wait until five.
“Where's your little army friend? Did he go off to get you a girlfriend?” He teased, earning a glare from Sherlock in response.
Sherlock was sprawled out on his queen sized bed with his thin white blanket sheets carelessly thrown over his drained form. Three quarters of his face was hidden In his pillow and soaked from drool from a used-to-be good night's sleep. His hair was messy and crumpled and his pajamas were lose, his striped bottoms being a little too loose.
Sherlock had gotten mad and grabbed the tape, raising his arm to throw it outside the window, but Lestrade had sprinted back to Sherlock from the top of the stairs and held his arm to prevent Sherlock from throwing it.
John in the recording was on on repeat and he kept chanting the one sentence. Both Lestrade as Sherlock stared at the screen as John’s voice filled the empty and quiet room. Sherlock couldn't deduce anything because the lighting was off. Johns face was hardly visible and only his silhouette told that a man was in front of the camera.
The door unlocked from the inside and the door opened, the cashier coming into full view. He wore a red shirt and sky blue trousers, shoes, and a watch on his left hand. His hair was neat and his face was a little pale. His brown eyes widened when he saw the police badge on Lestrade.
“I've done this before.” Sherlock said nonchalantly with annoyance written on his face. Seriously, how did this guy get a job in the first place?
He stopped when he felt arms wrap around him. He hadn't realised that Mrs. Hudson had turned Sherlock so he was facing her and that his eyes were stinging and blurry. They were probably red and his hands were shaking. Mrs. Hudson held him tightly and disregarded the fruit bowl, toast, and tea on the counter.
There was a thick silence and Molly could feel the tension come back down in mere seconds. His footsteps stopped and Molly strained to hear any indication that Sherlock hadn't left the room that he was in. A silent sigh was heard and a quiet scuff of papers was barely heard from Molly's position. When Sherlock talked she felt guilty for bringing up John.
He had also remembered first time he had been scared to love something so much that he would die for it.
“Oh, okay… Well uh-”
A bloody envelope.
Sherlock looked into the large box for anything else that was in there, but it was empty. After he had began to sob in his bed that one night, he began to laugh and he couldn't stop. He laughed so hard he fell over and almost knocked Mrs. Hudson down with him when she came to check on him from his nonstop laughing. His tears didn't stop but neither did his laughs. It was somehow funny.
Mycroft smiled once again and tilted his head up to get a good look at the papers in Sherlock's hands. He raised his unimpressed and poked the stack of papers that had just been crumpled.
He huffed a laughed and the sides of his lips slightly jerked up. His eyes filled with amusement.
“No! I can't! I just-”
His chest rose and fell slowly as his lungs were forcing oxygen through to keep him alive.
The man said as if trying to reason with him,
The phone cut off and beeping was heard. Sherlock stared ahead out the window with his phone at his ear for a second longer to process what had happened before he flung his body towards the driver's seat. His hands clutched the headpiece of the seat tightly.
"Do what?”
“You threw it."
“Really," Sherlock said and looked back out of his window as the cab took off the Baker Street from Scotland Yard. "Then you're a dwarf, no, Hobbit due to how short you are."
“Yes,” Sherlock sighed and leaned back into his chair, his aching back relaxing. “He would do something like that, but I don't exactly have the right clue as to what it would mean.”
He had also looked at Sherlock suspiciously before he allowed him access when Sherlock had called Lestrade to talk to the manager since he didn't believe that Sherlock was the actual ‘Sherlock Holmes , the guy who solves crimes and can tell your whole life story by a speck of dust on your finger’.
Should I still be alive? Will this ever end and go back to the old days with just the three of us at Baker Street? Will I ever know?
"That one. The rest are irrelevant." Sherlock jabbed at the photo of the blonde and swiped the rest off the desk, where they landed sprawled out on the floor.
“Did you brush your teeth today? Your breath doesn't smell like mint-”
“I got information about the case and the disappearance of John Watson. I had gone to the shop and went looking through the store before heading to the cash register and noticed marks and dents.” Sherlock picked up the file and pulled out the printed pictures he had taken on his phone the cash register and conveyor belt.
in closer.
Sherlocks jaw clenched.
His head snapped back up and he looked down at the floor, looking as if he heard something but debating whether or not he heard it or not. The door then opened and he looked up at the opening, his tired eyes growing into vigilant and sharp ones. He glared at the door that was out of sight from the camera. A man entered and laughed at John with a deep voice, slowly walking up to John, with what Sherlock and Lestrade could guess, a smile. He stopped as soon as he was in front of John, hovering over him. Instinctively, John sat up straighter and glared even harder at the man.
“WRONG?!” Sherlock yelled back questioningly.
“Why do you stare at me?”
“Hmm?” Sherlock angrily hummed with his face in his pillow.
“The cash is in the grave? What could that mean?”
Lestrade groaned and pinched the space between his eyebrows. He hadn't exactly prepared for this, oh wait, yes he had. He knew Sherlock would come storming in here to receive information on the case, but he hadn't exactly expected to be told off by Sherlock Holmes.
Please, if this story is uninteresting do tell me and I'll try to spice things up. Thank you for all who have read and commented on this story so far, it means a lot. Until next time.
Sherlock stared at John, his mind racing to understand what he had just been told. Yes, the cash was in the bag, and? What the bloody gravel was he supposed to do with that?
“Sherlock?”
“She's your sister, not anymore, obviously.” Sherlock replied deeply, the two men still staring at each other and not breaking eye contact.
"As if you'd actually let me go like that. You always want to see me and t gets rather annoying."
She cleaned the kitchen before heading to the loo, making sure to not place his shampoo and body wash bottles out of order. Once she was done she headed back to the main room and looked around. She went to go clean up a couple more places she had missed before she huffed in agreement that her work here was done.
"John."
“You know, I expected you to be a lot more smarter.” The man raised one side of his lip and nodded his head, resembling the way Moriarty did at the pool once. He had the face that said ‘you failed and now he's gone, bummer’.
“Yes?”
Sherlock was murderous.
With that, the man on the other side hung up, leaving Sherlock shocked as he stared at the wall with his phone still to his ear. He jumped and made a startled yelp when someone knocked on the door downstairs. Mrs. Hudson had gone out to get groceries and was gone, leaving Sherlock to answer the door.
What he didn’t have on his desk was a small DNA bag with a strand of hair in it and a straight faced Sherlock hovering over him as he stared off into the distance that was nonexistent. But jeez, Lestrade only wanted a couple of minutes to think without a Holmes breathing down his neck.
“John!” Sherlock panicked and looked around, not noticing his feet were already halfway down the street. “No one's that clever to solve this!”
If 221B Baker Street had any thoughts, all it would be thinking of is how Sherlock had somehow gotten even worse. He stayed in his room and sulked and thought and sometimes allowed a couple of tears out. He had gotten back on his smoking addiction and didn't give any signs of stopping anytime soon. Mrs. Hudson was just glad that he didn't go to drinking or self harm, she didn't think that she- or John- could take that.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock had walked by the cash register with a printed list of what John had gotten and payed for when he stopped dead in his tracks.
“I said I don't know and you heard me.”
Mrs. Hudson came out of her own flat and went into the top floor as Sherlock had just sat down in his chair and Lestrade looked outside the window to check on his car.
“WRONG!”
“How are you?”
'John Watson's PlayTime With His Mind’
He sat down next to John, who was now glaring at Sherlock, and set the tea by his foot. He took a deep breath in and his smile faded, leaving a serious and hard face in it's awake. He intertwined his fingers and placed them in front of his lips, staring and thinking.
She frowned as she looked Lestrade over before smiling. She stood up and held out her hand.
“Look,” the man sighed and put his hand on his hip as the other ran through his brown hair. “I don't know if I could permit that-”
“Sherlock? I got another piece of information I think you'd like.”
"John? What's going on? What's happening?"
“Beautiful day, isn't it? Just like the day when we took him in. We knew you'd come, but surprisingly, you didn't.” The man smirked wider when he saw Sherlock's harder and colder glare and clenched fist.
"Yes! The one dollar bill Lestrade? Don't you remember that?" Sherlock sarcastically cooed to Lestrade.
Thank you for all who read this! It really means a lot. Here's the next chapter for you. Enjoy!
Sherlock rolled his eyes at his brothers reply.
The cab turned a right and Sherlock looked at the rear view mirror before back outside his window.
"Yes." John nodded and looked back down to the paper.
Sherlock gripped the glued flap of the cardboard box and ripped the whole flap off in one smooth pull. Mrs. Hudson jumped with an ‘oh neighbors!’ And Lestrade could hear his heart beating in his ears from the unexpected.
Once the funeral had finished with a prayer and a sad goodbye, the group dispersed and went their own ways. Sherlock and Lestrade walked towards Lestrade's car, Sherlock holding the umbrella above their heads with a tight fist.
“Yes,” She replied, frowning even more to the strange question. “I got an E-mail for her to be released.”
“Seriously, where are your manners?”
Oh yeah, because he was officially insane without John Watson.
"Sherlock.” Lestrade whispered as he stared at the crumbling detective In Front of him. Sherlocks head was tucked back into his chest and he curled in himself.
Sherlock looked up to look at the two rattled people and slightly cocked his head to the side.
His eyes narrowed at the small device.
“WHAT THE BLOODY HELL SHERLOCK!”
“They killed him.”
She's the complete opposite of John.
The cashier was shocked and startled from Harry's outburst. He looked around at the three people standing in front of him. His eyes landed on Sherlock and his eyes widened.
“How are you mister Holmes? How's John Watson?”
“I saw the pictures of the missing people.
“The backgrounds that they had come from weren't the best. Some of them had abusive parents, some had siblings that would sexually molest them, some had parents that would take pictures of them in unfriendly ways. And a couple had abusive boyfriends.” Lestrade informed as he flicked through the files and pictures of the abducted people. He looked back up to Sherlock who was frowning and staring at the wall.
So sorry for the late update, I just needed some time to think and have some alone time. But as promised, here's the next chapter! Woo-hoo! And a little note for after you read the chapter- Don't hate me.... the story is just starting. :P
“It looks like the letters ‘I. O. U’”
Silence bare its way back into the car, making it even more uncomfortable to the two men. Sherlock was still slightly frowning and Lestrade gripped the steering wheel a little too tightly and stared wide eyed at the road ahead of them.
Sherlock stared and reread it. This couldn't be it. There had to be more somewhere! He felt as if he could rip all his hair out of his head. He frowned and sprang up out of his date and paced around. His fingertips were pressed together and were held at his chest.
“What!? Open it!”
“Understand that I just can't handle the pai-”
“This is a clue.”
Yeah, today was tough.
"Don't be stupid."
Mycroft had parked in the front of their flat as Mrs. Hudson thought about her past and what she did with her life while she was cleaning the kitchen. He sighed and looked over the roof of the car and watched as lestrade's head came into view as well. He had a nervous face on and was holding his cup of coffee quite hard.
The screen then went black and silence rang throughout the flat. Sherlock and Lestrade were left to stare at the screen with wide and furious eyes, Lestrade's mouth was wide open.
I'll try to update as regularly as possible. Thank you for reading and I'll be back to you soon!
She had heard about how John had been taken yet again and how Sherlock had reacted to it. She kept sending Sherlock sorrowful looks and small smiles and it was getting annoying to him. Like she wouldn’t have had a mental breakdown due to someone that they care about most in the world being taken again!
“You didn't tell me you left.”
“The cash was in the bag.”
"-but that doesn't mean I like getting them."
Sherlock went to the main camera and watched as John loaded the groceries on the coveyor belt. He greeted the cashier, who greeted him back. A man with brown hair, a sharp face with a little bit of cheek fat. He was a little bit taller than John, about half a head. He was in shape from what Sherlock could tell from the two that were quite far away from the camera.
Lestrade groaned and rubbed his face with both hands. Even as he put his hands down on his desk he continued to groan with his eyes shut tight. His door was closed and his coffee was still hot on his desk as his coworkers scurried along outside. He stopped and took a deep breath in, held it, and groaned louder than before. His computer was off due to a lack of use and the keyboard and mouse had a thin layer of dust on it. He really needed a break from all this chaos.
Man, she is lonely.
“Where's Sherlock?”
“What are you smirking for!?”
Yup. Mrs. Hudson had told Lestrade and Mycroft about his little breakdown. Now they both knew what had happened and how weak Sherlock is. They also now know how much John meant to him, and were now assuming that Sherlock loves him.
“How!?” He yelled and forcefully turned Sherlock around to face him, grabbing the lapels of his coat to force him to the same height as him.
At least, not now.
“I'm not getting anywhere.”
“I did! It obviously shows because i have bruises and scars!”
Sherlocks blood went cold when he heard John laugh quietly.
“I don't know about John's family.” He said aloud, wanting someone to reply. He couldn't help but stare at the picture again. He had told John in an argument that he knew absolutely
He hadn't eaten since Lestrade had forced him to and that was about two or three days ago, and God, don't even get Mrs. Hudson started on the last time Sherlock had a proper bath. She should go up to Sherlock's room and demand him to take a shower, even if he didn't fully wash behind his ears.
“Shut up.”
All of his life he hasn't been able to enforce the rule that sentiment simply gets in the way of the important things in life, such as education and business; not friends and lovers. Sherlock has always been the weaker link in his family, this is why his parents always compared him to his brother and had finally just decided to ignore Sherlock when he was ten. Mycroft had to drag Sherlock into his room at night and teach him the way things were supposed to be, the way things had to be or else no one in the family would ever want him. Although Sherlock took notes and repeated what Mycroft said word for word, he never truly burned it into his mind.
Lestrade was concerned about John way more than he had before. Not saying that he cared about John like he would for a paper clip, but he wasn't as obsessed in finding only John like Sherlock. But after he had watched the video he had changed, and was going to do anything to find John. Including the other missing people, of course.
“Why John?”
With that, he took his tape and shouldered Sherlock on his way out of the room with such intensity that Sherlock was almost knocked off balance. The door slammed behind him and Lestrade and Sherlock continued to stare at the place Anderson once stood; a pregnant silence slowly filled in every corner of the room.
"Must I hire an assistant to take care of you? You're a grown man who's lost his mind. Why must you always upset mummy?"
Rain. Something that Sherlock and John had always loved hearing and watching. They both used to move their chairs to the window, make tea, turn off all the lights, and stare out into the view as the water droplets fell. It was peaceful and silent as John and Sherlock sipped away at their tea.
“What do you mean by John has a sister?” Sherlock ignored Lestrade's irritated glare and slammed the file of the case without its cover lid down onto his coffee splattered table.
“Why are you talking to yourself dear?”
Mmm, let me think about it-
John looked at Sherlock.
But what scared Lestrade the most was that Sherlock had an almost calm face on when he walked in.
Sherlock’s mobile vibrated in his pocket, ruining the moment. He quickly snatched it out of his pocket, John continuing to rub his back in small circles. Sherlock turned it on and read the text.
“WHERE IS IT!?” Sherlock shot up in his chair and before Mycroft knew it Sherlock was inches away from his face. His pale, skinny face looked at Mycroft with hidden emotions, Mycroft obviously knew he was mad because of his outburst, his dilated pupils, his harsh breathing, and his clenched jaw.
"Mrs. Hudson!" Sherlock yelled as he stepped onto his bed before jumping and coming back down into it with a stomp. His bed received a beating that it hadn't deserved due to his frustration.
“The cash register that you were taken at has been cleaned and restored back to normal, you can tell by the one dent on a key-”
“Lonely…” Sherlock mumbled and buried his face into his knees, wrapping his arms around his head in the process.
“Who? Your girlfriend?” She asked.
"He has quite the big nose, don't you think?"
“Get out.”
“Sir, we found something in the house.” A tan policeman told Lestrade before backing away.
“What?”
Sherlock had remembered the first time he had cared for something so much that he'd die for it. He had only been a kid, but Sherlock still loved it senseless.
“Unknown sir.”
The cashier was sitting down in the chair they made him sit in with his hands handcuffed to the table by the metal half circle. He laid face down on the table, unmoving.
“I'm fine Mrs. Hudson. Really. I'll tell you when I'm dying.”
Men and women stood around the grave of the innocent cashier. Well, possibly innocent. Lestrade and Sherlock stood quietly in the crowd as women wept and men sighed. Lestrade frowned and looked at the grave of the young man as Sherlock cringed and shrivelled up when people got too close and bumped into him.
“John was bait…”
"Oh? And why not? Did you insult his weight again?"
It was John's favourite mug.
"No, don't you dare start with me." Lestrade pointed at Sherlock due to him describing him as futile. "I'm not worried about the case Sherlock. Honestly, they did what they wanted to John, what else more could they do?”
“Forget John, save the whole thing instead of just one soul.”
“Do you bloody mind?” Mycroft snapped as he turned around in his chair to look at Sherlock. He shrugged and stared at Mycroft with a bored expression.
The file was gripped by a pale and harsh hand before being ripped open. The cover of the file was no longer apart of the whole and was raised in the air, gripped by a pale hand, and all papers and pictures were out in the open for the man's eyes to take in.
Ah, there's the shock!
Lestrade looked up to Sherlock as his mind processed what Sherlock had just hinted. His eyes lit up as he understood and gestured for Sherlock to follow him. The two went through the halls swarming of people and voices.
He remembered he just held John as he silently sobbed his heart out. He remembered when John kept whispering harshly ‘you bastard’ and ‘how could you, you little bitch’.
Lestrade looked back down to the pictures after he started to stare at his coffee mug. He swore he heard Molly mumble ‘please love me’. As much as Lestrade wanted Molly to just ask Sherlock to date him and confess, he shipped John and Sherlock just a tad bit more.
Once he had John frowned somewhat. Sherlocks chest heaved with each breath and his hair was sticking out every direction. He was paler and skinnier, much too skinnier.
“Coming!” She said as she made her way down the stairs. She opened the door and looked around when she found no one was there.
Mrs. Hudson came closer to Lestrade and peeked over his shoulder to have a look into the box too.
His chest heaved and burned along with his legs. He didn't plan this day to go out like this. Hours ago John was In Front of him, literally giving him the answers to the case. Now he's gone!
As the intimacy between them heated, John couldn’t keep himself from trying to chase Sherlock anytime he gyrated away. He needed that friction now that Sherlock had decided to gift him with, and he was going crazy from the teasing touches that he was afraid to take more seriously.
It was the type of brokenness that had made him unable to return to civilian life after returning from the war. The broken shell of a man that couldn’t get rid of flashbacks and the empty pit of his chest. A brokenness that had him experiencing insomnia and limping from a non-existent injury.
Now that that part of his life had been at a stand still for two years, it was practically unbearable. Now the work wasn’t only tedious, but it was without the purpose he had once used to balance it out with. Even with the famous detective back, if the previous crime scene had been any indication, John was no longer of any use when it came to catching criminals.
John wanted to argue. It felt wrong to just do nothing during something like this. Sherlock didn’t give him that chance. He held his hands in place with a strong hold at his linked wrists. Generally, being held down wouldn’t be an issue since John was stronger, but his muscles were too laced to do much fighting.
Two hours later, pleasantly numb without any of those painful thoughts that had weighed him down through the long hours of work, John pushed himself from the bar stool to stand. Uncoordinated, he fished through his pockets to find his wallet so he might pay, but was having more trouble than he should have had. He swayed on his feet, the room beginning to rock, threatening to put him on his backside, but strong arms had reached out to save him from further humiliation.
She scurried off, leaving Sherlock watching as she went to her manager's office. Really, why and how are people like her hired here? They're what people dread the most about shopping.
"Fine!” Sherlock yelled and stood up with a furious gaze on Mycroft.
“A sister? John had a sister and never bothered to tell me this information? Wow, he must not trust me that much.”
“Yeah?” Johns voice went from shocked to worried.
Sherlock's eyes widened.
“The cash is in the grave.”
(See the end of the chapter for
An empty corpse.
The line was silent on the other side. Sherlock thought about saying something like ‘hello?’ Or ‘Sherlock Holmes’ but decided against it.
Sherlock had enough of Detective Inspectors for one day, oh wait, he was wrong on that one. One after the other after the other had came by Sherlock and stopped him for ignorant information about the case. Some of the questions were about what else he could deduce from the pictures and corpses of some people who had been abducted.
Thanks to that stupid cashier Sherlock was suffering on the couch without John. The man who didn't deserve this. The man who stood up. The man who saved lives. The man who protects. Now he's gone, God knows where, and it's still undecided on whether he's coming back or not. That's up to Sherlock.
Whoa right? I’ve got the whole plot written out so I should be writing more frequently now. Hopefully it drags on and makes sense to people at the end of everything. I really thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy this story so far. If not, tell me and I’ll make sure to make it more interesting. Thank you! K byeeee!!
Mycroft however also knew that he himself was not angered by Sherlock's ways, he remained calm and didn't move a muscle as Sherlock shot In front of his face. He had a neutral face, so Sherlock would understand he wasn't freighted and Sherlock would get even angrier.
Sherlock let out a breath and closed his eyes for a moment. It felt nice to hear his voice again when he really was still John. The man only tilted his head slightly down and flicked his right hand in a dismissive way.
Nailed it Holmes.
Sherlock frowned and looked down at his unoccupied left hand.
“Terrible.”
“Of all things to do, why this? What would he get out of it?”
“Detective Inspector Lestrade here.”
“Lestrade.” She hissed out, making Lestrade narrow his eyes too and his frown deepen.
“And putting people in it.”
Sherlock barged into the room and slammed the door closed behind him, his trench coat flapping dramatically behind him as he strides towards Lestrade.
A head shook.
“Don't say such things of your memory, that won't help you remember anything useful.”
She had dark blue trousers on, short blonde hair that went to her shoulders, a skin tight, yellow green shirt that outlined her flat stomach, with some running shoes on. Her head was down and she slouched in the chair, making it impossible to see her face.
Today, they were at the cashier's house. Yes, the cashiers house.
“No I-”
“I, sadly, have no clue as to what you are talking about Sherlock. I don't know what ‘
His mobile went off in his pocket and his hand darted for it, flicking it open with a flick of his wrist, and his eyes scanning the small screen.
People threw Sherlock confused, angry, sorrowful, and nonchalant glances. He brushed them off as quickly as they were thrown to him. What people thought and said didn't effect him.
“If you don't bite down the STUPID ATTITUDE OF YOURS, YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN THE REVOLUTION, GET KIDNAPPED FOR ALL I CARE, AND HAVE NO MEMORY OF ANYTHING!” Lestrade yelled furiously in her face, forcing her to back up and uncross her arms. Her eyes filled with shock, and what made Lestrade inwardly smirk was the fear in her eyes.
“Because you’re the only person that I know.” John said, still keeping a blank expression on his face since his frown left his face.
“You should eat.”
“I don't know, I don’t know, I can’t do anything. Just ask Mycroft to do the case for all I care! I can’t do it! I’m not the right person so stop coming up to me and asking questions you bloody psychopaths!” Sherlock yelled as he looked down the window and onto the mob of reporters that swarmed the flat.
“How was she- wha- no….!” Sherlock whispered with wide eyes as he looked down at the body below him. The crowd of policemen surrounded him and Sherlock felt as if they were screaming at him. Lestrade seemed to be the only person who wasn't talking at all and just stared at the woman at their feet.
“I'm going to ask you once more Mycroft. Where. is. it?”  Sherlock venomously spat through clenched teeth.
Taken.
“Look dude, I've had enough of you going through shit that doesn't even concern you-”
“What are you doing?” He demanded quietly.
Mrs. Hudson sighed and looked around the box again. She frowned as she found no address from whom it was from or where it came from. Hopefully Sherlock would find this interesting and hopefully it would help his case.
John and the man were chatting as he scanned the items and put them in plastic bags. John payed with his card and when he went to grab the bags the footage went to static.
Sherlock stood back and went back to looking around the room as Molly clumsily lost her grip and fell onto the floor on her back with a soft 'oof'.
Sherlock was breathing so hard that he grunted every time he breathed out and stomping his foot with each step he took.
“Yes, excuse me.” Sherlock said as he shoved the man out of the way to go check on the register that John had been taken at. The cashier had given him a confused look as he told him to go get another cash register to work at and told the annoyed people in line to leave and get another line to wait in.
"Go!" Lestrade barked. Anderson opened his mouth to protest but was cut off again. "NOW, Anderson!"
He was too late now.
He thought.
SHIT!
“You don't know.” Sherlock said.
“If she was drunk why would you let out of your custody!?” John yelled, his voice getting higher and slightly cracking.
“My boys.” Sherlock and Lestrade whipped around on the couch to look at Mrs. Hudson by the door.
The CD.
Holy crap! It’s been two years! I’ve aged two years since I’ve last updated! Don’t worry though, I’ve read all of the comments and honestly don’t think I’ve forgotten about this story. The plot actually begins in this chapter so that’s good! Thank you to all who’ve stayed with me even through this huge gap of updates. It really does mean a lot! But, without further or do, ONWARD FELLOW READERS!!
Sherlock mentally killed himself from those words. What kind of explanation was that?! A knee slapper? And Sherlock was supposed to be the smart one!
And now, the roles were reversed, except Mrs. Hudson was the one holding Sherlock and not John. John had started to make noises as more sobs had came, they sounded like he was laughing, but he wasn't. He wasn't laughing inside or outside. If anything he was screaming and crying.
He yelled in frustration and kicked the tire of the car repeatedly. With each kick he cursed and grunted in anger. How long would this case be? It’s been going on for four months now, more and more people are being taken and here Lestrade is, drinking coffee and kicking the tires of police cars and letting people die. He’d had enough of it and just wanted the man who’s been taking the people to just die already. Lestrade had stopped kicking the car and leaned against it, running his hands down his face.
“TAKE ME BACK TO THE STATION OR MAY GOD BE ON YOUR SIDE TODAY!”
Lestrade only stared shocked. His mouth immediately dried at the awkward position he had gotten himself into. He looked everywhere but Sherlock's eyes and blinked, clearing his throat once.
Sherlock said and handed Lestrade a tape.
“I think that there's a hidden message in the words.”
John smiled at the cashier and said something, possibly ‘hello’. The cashier seemed to say it back because John's smile widened and he replied to the man. The two had a small conversation and the cashier scanned the items and put them in plastic bags. John payed with his card and when he went to grab the bags before a man in a black suit came up behind the cashier and wrapped his arms around from the back before throwing him to the ground. John had been alarmed by this and was about to attack the man before he was grabbed by another one of the men from behind, who had started to drag John backwards. John had struggled and managed to punch the man in the face, he yelped and let go of John, who went to help the cashier who had been dragged out of view.
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock whispered when John began to close his eyes again. “I was so sure that this was what you wanted. No. I know I this is what you want. I’ve seen the way you look at me, and how your body reacts to me. I’ve reviewed the facts from before.” John closed his eyes tighter as he was forced to listen. “But I didn’t take into account your perpetuity towards denial. Well, I did, but I didn’t plan on this causing further damage than what there already was. And for that I apologize. Still, I do believe if you could just accept my attention, then…”
What happened to you? - SH
Like all the times before, Sherlock was encouraged by the sounds his partner made and he pressed into John with more fervor. His kisses because like live bites and his muscles tightened around John passionately tease at the blood that was quickly rushing to his groin.
Yet, days went on. John went to work, came home to a flat that either had a deeply in thought Sherlock or a Sherlock who was in the middle of an experiment. There was a steady stream of cases that came in, some given answers on the spot while others were kicked out because they were boring. Lestrade called once in that time, but the crime must have less than a six because Sherlock hung up and continued on with whatever he was doing.
He was so out of it that he couldn’t even hear the pain in the detective’s voice as he apologized for the third time in three days. “I’m sorry John. I just wanted to protect you.”
But John wasn’t sure if he could trust Sherlock in those matters. Trust ran both ways, and John knew for a fact that Sherlock didn’t trust him.
John himself was an emotional being, ruled by senses and feelings more than anything else. No to say that he wasn’t a man of science - he was a doctored after all - but his motivations and willingness to do anything was founded on what was in his heart. The thought was ridiculously romantic, but it wasn’t like he hadn’t been accused of it before. Sherlock, certainly had accused him with a tone of disgust often enough.
Whatever it was, it was too much. John became lost in sensations, a mess of nerves and rushing blood. No coherent thought available, except the weak warning that this was wrong.
“Sherlock,” John tired again, recognizing the signs of another round of babbling, but this time wasn’t able to keep the man from wanting to protest.
The pints were beginning to fade, leaving John still numb and out of his mind, as well as getting a massive migraine. “I don’t have to tell you anything,” he snapped before Sherlock could continue to list the conclusions he was coming to about John’s behavior. “You certainly don’t tell me everything.”
A quiet tear leaked from his eyes. His vision blurred.
“Obviously,” John murmured, so low that most wouldn’t have been able to hear even from a close distance, but Sherlock did not. There was nothing that could fix John.
He hadn’t been able to stop Moriarty from strapping the bomb on him, putting Sherlock in danger without any way of protecting him. He hadn’t been able to stop Irene Adler from drugging Sherlock and beating  him with a riding crop. He hadn’t been able to stop the country from believing Moriarty's lies. And he sure as hell hadn’t been able to stop Sherlock from taking the fall.
He came out reluctantly when the water began to lose it’s heat, and took his place in his seat. It didn’t take long after settling into the cushions uncomfortably, John could feel Sherlock step behind him, staring intently as he was prone to do. Only this time, Sherlock was unsure, the nerves clear in the air.
“I think I can do the rest by myself.” John hated the way he sounded so unsure.
Against his will, John found himself bringing up his hands to rest upon Sherlock’s waist. The feeling of Sherlock pressed against him was...John couldn’t describe it. Something good. Something a bit not good.
Gray-blue eyes were soft, more vulnerable than John had ever witnessed. It was a mesmerizing sight. “But I was dead, with no hope of coming back.” He seemed to have come to this understanding just that instance, which  was creating a dark churl in John’s stomach. How was Sherlock just realizing this now? “Which makes the waiting a bit more…”
Yet John definitely couldn’t handle Sherlock sounding rejected. Couldn’t allow Sherlock to think that there was no hope left in him, because it was bad enough that the detective didn't trust him, but it would kill John completely if he was left alone again entirely.
Sometimes John was reminded that he was overqualified for his job as a clinic doctor. He had been a surgeon once - a damn good one - and should have been working in an actual hospital where he could actually be saving lives. The problem was, not many hospitals wanted to hire ex-army doctors who had PTSD and shaky hands. Never mind that his hands were perfectly steady when he needed them to be.
“Hmm,” John murmured.
At first John took gratification from the intimacy, but then suddenly it became too much. The kissing, the touching, the grinding. John brought his palms to Sherlock’s chest to gently push him away.
“I thought you would stay here, going about your life as you would have without the addition of dealing with criminals. I thought you would be here for me to return to, waiting for things to go back to normal.” As he spoke, it was clear that he had realized his error in deductions and was ashamed of his miscalculation.
Mycroft raised an eyebrow as he watched as Sherlock slowly slid in his chair and blink when Sherlock stopped, the bottom of his back hanging off his chair and his chin tucked in his chest.
"Darkness."
“You do it, since you're so bloody tall!”
He turned around and punched John so hard the chair John was sitting in fell down and skid.
“I didn’t ask for your input. I want you to read this and find this woman.” Sherlock ordered, his gaze still burning into Mycroft's as he shoved the file towards him.
have finally won.
“And, if you were as smart as me you'd figure this case out.” Mycroft said as he threw a file into Sherlock's chest. “It actually is quite interesting.”
"Based off of her flat she recently came to London but it wasn't her flat. It was someone else's that had unwillingly moved out to make space for her. The hard drive of the computer in the master bedroom was fried, so whatever had been sent to the person living in the flat had been personal and this forced them to comply with whatever Moriarty or she had told them to do. The flat wasn't the woman's style anyways as she seems to like rich clothing such as fur coats and highly priced diamond earrings and rings. She seems to have quite the background judging by the weapons that had been found in the flat and the surveillance hidden in every corner and cranny of the flat, though don't give me that worried look I took them all out. Judging by the colour of the lipstick and the type of perfume she wears she's trying to blend in and become less suspicious which means that whatever she does she's good at and-" Sherlock took a deep breath and gave Lestrade and 'wait a minute' signal with his hand.
And Sherlocks pissed.
The cab came to a stop in front of the department and Sherlock swung open the car door after throwing the money to the driver. He started walking towards the entrance, a serious blank face on. His mask was in place with his anger, and he wasn't a nice man at the moment.
"I didn't do that to you. Someone else did. I'm not your enemy. In fact, I came to show you the truth." She withdrew her hands and reached into her pocket to retrieve something. John sat up straight in a military with and squared his shoulders. He strained his neck to try to get a better glimpse of what she was getting.
This is a hard one, and although the clues were sloppily thrown around they were neatly cut to the point where they could find everything and it would still be out of order. He had remembered when Sherlock first came bursting through his door with the first clue. He had had to change his trousers, not because he had an 'accident' but because Sherlock had scared him so bad that he spit his coffee everywhere. He had a nasty red burn for three and a half weeks.
“No! Since when did I have a sister!” John yelled, his soft and sad face leaving and replaced with a hard and stern one on.
“This is the room that we can see and look at videos on.” Lestrade said as he watched Sherlock look around with a slight frown on his face.
He didn't know he was hurting.
Sherlock came striding out of one car and to the front where Harry and Lestrade were. When Sherlock's eyes landed on Harry he frowned as he deduced her. When he realised she was Harriet Watson, sister of John Watson, he looked back to the door as they kept walking.
Pure hell.
“Sir,” a man said from the stairs, shocked as well by Sherlocks sight. “There's a package.”
“The case ‘The Missing J’.”
“My precious boys. One is gone and the other is suffering.” She said softly and closed her eyes.
The door to Lestrade's office was slammed open, as it had closed behind Sherlock by itself. Lestrade snapped his head to the door and Sherlock mimicked his moves. Donovan was panting in the view and looked just as dazed and confused as Lestrade.
‘Expensive,’ Sherlock thought, ‘Rich man.’
“Locked.” He mumbled and stared at the door. His head turned to his right and his eyes then went to look at Sherlock's door, closed and silent as the soul that inhabited the room.
“That you're not alone-”
Mycroft sighed and leaned forward to get a full look at the insides of the file, which was filled with nothing but photos of a blonde woman. His eyes squint as he spread them out across his desks, Sherlock's foot tapping impatiently.
Slowly, he settled himself away from the bucket with the help of his flatmate. When it looked like John was done with puking out his guts, Sherlock helped him back into bed. “I’ll be right back. Don’t worry.”
He wasn’t aware of such a fact until he was completely naked beneath his flat mate, along with the realization that Sherlock himself was still very much clothed. Following his instincts, the ones that always made him want to give more than he received, he took a hold of Sherlock’s dress shirt, but Sherlock nipped at John’s bottom lip and took his hands in his own to place them above John’s head. “It’s okay,” he whispered into the doctor’s mouth, his words vibrating within his throat. “Let me do this for you.”
That had been clear enough when Sherlock had appeared of nowhere with a cocky grin on his boyish face. Their previous relationship came to equal nothing upon the realization that Sherlock had never truly needed John, because Sherlock had never trusted John. If he had trusted him, he would have informed him of his genius plan to thwart Moriarty.
For he wasn’t using the phrase as the insult as he would normally be using it as, but rather as a term to be used because of a lack of understanding as to what exactly John was going through. He saw the symptoms, had deduced the reasons, and had even come up with a way to fix him. What he couldn’t fathom was the reason why. Why was John affected in this way? Why wouldn’t he let Sherlock fix him like he had before? Why had he felt the desire to go to the pub when Sherlock was waiting at the flat with a cure?
The case had been simple for Sherlock to deduct, observing within the minutes who the killer was. Unfortunately, since the solving the crime had been too easy, Sherlock had taken it upon himself to go after the serial murderer personally, leaving Scotland Yard out of the loop. With absolutely no care towards his own safety, Sherlock chased after the impulsive killer who had a fully loaded gun in his hand and prepared to shoot the second Sherlock was close enough to take aim.
John kept himself from scoffing, but only barely. “Yes, well, just as your said; the pain is all in my head.” He turned further away from his friend, facing the opposite wall.
“Keep your arsehole observations to yourself tonight, huh?” The harsh retort shocked the detective, so used to being called brilliant and wondering after a successful case. His eyes followed John’s angry form as he limped to the bathroom and the door slammed shut.
“Sherlock,” he groaned breathlessly in need as the man on top of him gyrated against him with brilliant rhythm.
After that, everything seemed to rush by. Sherlock had gotten a hold of his pistol, shot the murderer’s hand, and Scotland Yard swarmed the area. The serial killer was arrested. Lestrade fussed over a bleeding John, but then, before he could be questioned, he was being dragged away.
When he had moved himself into the bathroom, he had thought Sherlock would head out. He didn’t. He stood there, waiting, watching, just like he had when he had set John in bed in the morning. Wanting to steer him away, John mumbled, “Thanks for your help Sherlock.”
When his footsteps could be heard going down to their living room, leaving the door ajar, John collapsed back into pillows, closing his eyes against the pain throbbing through his head.
Which would have been welcomed any other day, Sherlock being mindful of such ordinary things, but John was too drained to deal with incompetencies in which his friend dealt with matters not rooted in rationality.
He was hard and leaking, straining for more and weeping at the sensations that wracked the rest of his body. It suddenly occurred to John just how long he had gone without this, without the intimate presence of another, of being brought to such levels of heightened pleasure.
The hurt that John could see in Sherlock stabbed John straight into his chest with the same brutality that the bullet had torn into his shoulder. Had John been the cause of this hurt? How long had John been too deep into self pity that he hadn’t noticed that his friend was hurting too? “It...it wasn’t the idea of you that led me to the pub.”
When he had the ability to open his eyes it was to see a hurt and unsure Sherlock peering down at him, still sitting on his lap. “Did I do something wrong?”
“Yes, well,” Sherlock stuttered unsurely, “I guess that doesn’t erase the last two years. I...I,” he struggled to find the phrase. “It has come to my understanding that my being back doesn’t mean we can just go back to the way things were. That we,...that we have to rebuild what we had.”
Was that hurt in the tenor of Sherlock's voice? Was this a genius pained by what he felt as rejection?
The massage continued, but it was now in addition to lips against his neck. Too lost in the moment, John couldn’t comprehend the breathy whispers that cooled the back of his neck. “You’re going to be okay John. I’m going to make sure of it...I’ll fix you. I promise. Just stay with me.”
Not really hearing the words, John moaned and kept seeking further touch, which Sherlock was glad to help with. He maneuvered John directly under the water, gently leading his head back to wash away the shampoo. When he was sure the shampoo was gone, he moved on to lathering the rest of John. Starting at his chest, he sensually drew circles into John’s skin with soapy hands, slowly making his way down.
It’s far past the time you should be home. -SH Another text lit on his phone, but John ignored it entirely this time.
The problem was, how was he supposed to be fixed this time? Because as much as Sherlock wanted to help, he couldn’t possibly fix John when it came to this. For while he had done a miracle when first meeting John, that miracle had come because John had felt need. Now, though, there wasn’t a thing in the world to convince John he still served a purpose.
Years ago, the monotony of the clinic work hadn’t bothered as much as it was bothering him now. As a broken soldier, it was the only job he could get, and during that time in which he had barely gotten back, he had been wracked by too many other things to worry about the boredom. Then, when it came to a time that he wasn’t broken, he was saving lives by other means. With Sherlock Holmes.
John wasn’t sure when it had happened, when he had decided to talk the trolley here, but he ended up at the pub after work. With little conscious thought, he sat at the end of the counter and ordered a pint.
So John tossed and turned, unable to get away from the painful music that mocked him mercilessly.
In self-deprecation, John stumbled down the stairs, limping heavily and leaning against the wall. Sherlock’s eyes were on him the moment the door was cracked open wider. John recognized the look immediately. Intense, calculating eyes took in all of John, observing, connecting the dots, and filing the information away. Usually, such a look amused John, or even aroused him, but not lately, and definitely not when directed at him.
“Why didn’t you come back to the flat after work? You always come straight here. Or, if you know you aren’t going to, you always inform me where you are going.” He stared at John as if to study him like a crime scene, but unlike a crime scene he seemed unable to come up with anything reasonable deductions.
There was a part of John, still himself after all that he had drank, that felt guilty about not responding. It was unlike him to ignore Sherlock like this, and he could just picture the man going out of his mind. Though he had a tendency of ignoring others, he didn’t take to kindly to be the one that was ignored. Another part of him, however, was entirely affected by the alcohol and didn’t care at all.
“We are going too fast,” Sherlock finished, gracefully removing himself from his lap. There was something in the air that made John think he should explain himself, give further explanation for stopping their...fun. But Sherlock didn’t find further explanations necessary. His expression became once again that stoic mask that he was so fond of wearing. “I understand. Of course you need time. You’ll need to process this information. We can try again tomorrow.”
As much as John would wish it, John knew awkwardly confessed words would do little for their current situation. It would do even less for John’s mental state.
“No?” It was clear that Sherlock didn’t believe him.
He thought Sherlock would agree in his typical cocky manner, but he didn’t. Instead, “I suppose that doesn’t make it any less real.” His silence pressed into the air. Sherlock refused to leave despite the tension. Or maybe it was because of the tension that he stayed. After awhile his baritone voice broke the stillness. “I’m sorry John.”
It was like a reel from a movie that depicted their old life in which anyone peering into their daily routines would think everything was back to normal. Mrs. Hudson certainly thought so given her cute, naive comments about their “domestics”. And John did his best to keep up those appearances, to pretend to the best of his ability that things were in fact getting better and that Sherlock was indeed “fixing him”.
“Of course,” John replied anyways. Because as much as he still didn’t fully believe that this would actually fix him, it was definitely a start.
“Take out?” Sherlock wondered after a time. “Or maybe tea?”
“What?”
There must have been something in his expression or the ways he braced himself, for Sherlock paused momentarily to study John with his defective focus. Whatever he saw led him to declare in his softened tone, “John, you can trust me.”
John shook his head as best as he could against the pillow, tears gathering again in his eyes against his will. He made sure that those tears weren’t evident in his voice though Sherlock probably could tell. “You don’t have to apologize. I understand why you did it.” And he did understand. He truly did. Just as he understood that Sherlock had been through hell while he had been gone, and therefore had no reason to complain about what he had gone through during those years.
“What are you doing?” John asked cautiously, though he didn’t have it in him to take the leg away. Lowering his book, he stared curiously and suspiciously at his flatmate.
Once upon a time, all Sherlock had to do was state in his exasperated, raspy voice that he needed something and John would do what he could to meet the man’s expectations. Obviously, not much had changed in that regard. It wasn’t even a verbal order and John was readily obeying, raising his arms so his shirt could be lifted over his head.
Just barely beginning to wake up fully, John found he had just enough energy in him to sass, “Figured you could decide that much.”
When he had seen Sherlock again, alive and standing in front of him in that restaurant, had been like a haunting dream. That second of seeing him had made John question his sanity, thinking for awhile that he had gone too far off the deep end. It was the only explanation for Sherlock to be standing there, alive and reasonably well, because John had seen him die with his own eyes.
It was ridiculous, John knew, to be reacting this way. Once upon a time the chase would have been exhilarating, and seeing a gun point at Sherlock would have led him to take out his own to shoot first. That was probably the reason Sherlock hadn’t been afraid of the killer, thinking that his partner would be in his right mind to shoot before the killer ever had the chance to pull the trigger. The moment he witnessed the scene, however all logical thought was gone. In less than a second, he could see Sherlock fall and bleed out on the dirty ground, and John would rather die than see that sight again.
John was laid out perfectly for what Sherlock planned to do to him. The genius man above him peppered him with insistent kisses, generously applying small, pleasureable bites and greedy swipes of his tongue, distracting John of the fact that his clothes were being meticulously taken off.
By the time John had caught up to Sherlock, the man had the murderer backed into an alleyway, rallying off his deductions without seeming to worry about the gun pointed at the center of his chest. A second before the shot rang out, John was bull-rushing his flat mate, knocking him onto the hard cement while the bullet grazed his shoulder.
Completely in control, Sherlock took advantage of the needy body under him, playing him as dedicatedly as he would his violin to bring about groans, moans, and other whimpering sounds.
All at once, the thrumming energy that had flowed through his blood, came to a calming stop. His body was putty, lacking the ability to move, but more than willing to let Sherlock mold him however he wanted. He closed his eyes just briefly, drained from the attention, but when he reopened them Sherlock had managed to escape. Before he had the chance to fully begin to lament over being used and left behind, Sherlock then returned with freshly washed hands and a damp rag, preparing to clean the mess from John.
Maybe John should just be grateful that Sherlock was finally being considerate, that he was finally paying attention to someone else’s emotional needs. Mostly, though, it set him on edge. Sherlock was behaving like this for a reason, and that reason had been spelled out quite clearly: John was a broken man, and therefore needed to be treated with kid gloves.
From an onlooker point of view, John was practically a lap dog, following after the genius, waiting to be told what was needed of him. It must have made him look like a pansy the way he endured Sherlock’s insults, dropped everything the man, and tolerated his tantrums. They certainly thought he was head over heels for the man, mocking their relationship.
The smaller man was set carefully into his chair. As John slumped into his chair, Sherlock knelt before him so that they were at eye level. His expression was serious and stern, and if John hadn’t been drunk he would have seen the concern and care.
As he did, he kept his chin on John’s shoulder, often kissing the juncture sweetly, keeping an observant eye on John’s state of being. He was a little wary of being rejected again at the last moment like last time, but it was obvious that for now John was his to meld as he found best.
In his inability to say no, Sherlock had slowly stepped right behind him. Cautious of the way a startled ex-soldier might react, he took a hold of the edges of John’s shirt and tugged upwards.
The detective was surprising god at this. Or maybe not so surprising. He did after all have a perchance of knowing and excelling at the strangest things. He was passionate in the way he pushed into John, grinding against him with just enough force to make John needing to tighten his lips to hold in erotic whimpers. Calloused fingers left barely there caresses upon John’s cheek and neck, and his tongue gently pried past chapped lips for access.
The sudden “attack” wasn’t surprising, for Sherlock had done this plenty of times whenever he deduced John was far too deep in broken thoughts, and John accepted the intimacy in stride. Expected or not, it only took three seconds for Sherlock’s complete attention to melt all sensible thoughts from John.
John, becoming drowsy by the waning alcohol, mumbled almost incoherently, “Don’t need pro’ection.” He closed his eyes, wanting to drift away.
With just the slightest indication that he was awake and aware was enough for Sherlock to loom over him to peer studiously into John’s expression. It was a bit intimidating to have the detective hover him, but the shower had lulled John into a sense of security that he couldn’t deny even if he wanted to.
He could hear Sherlock shuffle about in the living room, but John did his best to ignore outside distractions.
“Sher...Sherlock,” John caught the man’s name in his throat. He knew it sounded like he was begging, that he was begging, but he couldn’t stop himself from doing so.
Then the music did stop, pausing a moment in silence, followed shortly after by light footsteps. The loss of gentle notes settled John slightly, but not enough to entirely allow for him to get a restful night’s rest. Slowly, quietly, John’s door creaked open. Apparently not finding it pertinent to ask for permission, Sherlock stepped towards the bed.
“It’s alright John. Just let go.” So he did.
The only thing that had helped him get over it, to patch up the broken cracks of himself, was meeting Sherlock. Sherlock , who had taken one look at him and had known it all. Who had baited him into a wild chase and miraculously cured him.
The second velvet lips were on his, John lost all rational thought...or at least the little bit of rationality that he had left. A part of him knew this was a bad idea, that he would end up being the fool and getting hurt, but he couldn’t help but melt into the intimate pressure.
Hearing his name seemed to provide the incentive that Sherlock needed because, with a promising bite a lustful thrust, he was on his feet, pulling John up with him. The moment John was standing, lips attached themselves to him again as a lead body crowded into his space and maneuvered him backward into his bedroom. “You’re sure about this.”
Now that John had finally caught onto Sherlock's own emotional turmoil, he was forcing himself to focus on the man that had tried his best these past few days to put the broken pieces back together. “What are you going on about?”
Which left John again to his own misery, though now not only left with horrible images, saddening remembrances, and a deep ache that seeped into his psychology. Along with thinking about the painful complexity of Sherlock himself. It was something that Sherlock had been able to come to such a conclusion on his own, to understand what John was going through. In all probability it meant he was progressing. Maturing. It was one thing to come to that conclusion, though, and quite another to act upon it.
“It’s okay. It’s okay. You’re okay.” Sherlock kept repeating, his voice softer than John could bear. His level of care was flattering, but it was hard to fully appreciate under these circumstances.
Why was Sherlock doing this? What had crossed his brilliant mind to lead him to the conclusion that this was what needed to be done?
He woke up hours later, the headache faded but but not entirely gone, his whole body some, and the strong sense that he hated himself. How could be be so stupid? Losing control like that? What had he been trying to do anyways? He knew he was a light weight, and he knew the consequences of drinking as much as he did.
In fact, had John ever been useful in that regards? Had Sherlock actually needed him, or could the madman have continued to do what he loved without any assistance from him? After all, John thought bitterly, when Sherlock had truly needed to be saved, John hadn’t been able to do a damn thing.
John frowned. “You must have been moderately aware that your absence would have an impact on me.” He had certainly behaved as if John’s life would have just paused without Sherlock - never mind that that was what had happened.
He still had that look of wanting to argue, but in the end he just said, “Call me if you need anything.”
Sherlock frowned, not used to gaining John’s anger quite this quickly. In fact, he wasn’t all that used to John being inhibited. “I didn’t say I was. I’m just saying you usually inform me what you are doing.”
Peering at the text, John pondered about whether or not he should answer. When another pint appeared in front of him, it decided that for him. He set the phone aside and drowned his brokenness away.
“Um, no. It’s just, I'm, I wh…”
“I’m sure you can as well, but that doesn’t mean I can’t provide assistance.”
“Actually,” John groaned, lifting himself from his chair, “I think I’ll just go to bed.” He felt Sherlock’s cold stare at his back as he limped up to his room, his fists clenched against the wall to keep his balance as well as keep his frustration in.
With some sense of care for his own life, but having a far greater sense of care concerning Sherlock’s well-being, John followed on his heels. He tried to call after his friend, but nothing could deter the great imbecile that was Sherlock Holmes.
Those first years spent with Sherlock had been amazing, turning a broken soldier into a doctor made whole.
Sherlock stared straight into him to see if he could decipher what John meant. When he found that there wasn’t a lie to be pried open, he made sure, “To be clear then, you are willing to test my theory?” The theory that Sherlock’s touch would miraculously cure John’s brokenness.
“It wasn’t my intention to get drunk.”
It wasn’t. There wasn’t anything Sherlock could say or do that would convince John that he could be made whole this time around.
Already lost to the fog of unconsciousness, he wished Sherlock would stop playing. The sounds were too damaging to his wrecked heart, broken the second Sherlock had decided to defeat Moriarty on his own.
For two years, that had been the image John had had to fall asleep to, haunted by the loss and his uselessness in saving the one person he needed most. Living with nothing but that last memory, John had been as dead on the inside as Sherlock was completely.
John couldn’t allow to be left alone without the proper release now. Desperate, John gripped onto Sherlock’s hips, not to take control but to encourage the moment to continue. Though he instinctively knew things would eventually go bad, his desires were at a point of urgency that could no longer go unattended.
The ex-soldier found out hard to breathe. Obviously it was still trapped by the lips of a certain detective. What had Sherlock said in the beginning? That this was to “fix” things? To fix John? Did Sherlock think him broken?
Brows scrunched together. “I am talking about this situation that you've placed yourself in because of your insistence that you can’t accept my advances despite the fact that I know such physical intimacy will help in lowering your stress levels and also provide…”
A small, crooked smile appeared at the edges of the man’s mouth, bemused by a slower than normal partner. “What would make you feel better first: tea or shower?” When John took too long to answer, Sherlock decided for him. “Shower then,” he demanded, already moving to the bathroom to get the water heated. “You stink.”
“No,” John mumbled, the touch, however gentle it might have been, roused him awake. The intimacy made the shorter man feel queasy, and he flinched away from the touch when he became aware enough to do so. Oddly enough, Sherlock had a brief expression of hurt flit across his boyish face before putting it behind his typical mask. But John saw it and he couldn’t stomach it. It was all too much. “I’m fine,” he muttered, still drowsy but harsh enough, “You can go.”
In a way, John supposed it was what made Sherlock brilliant and the best that there was in his field. Unlike the mundane people that lived out their days plainly, Sherlock didn’t allow sentiment to get in the way of logic and what was real. He didn’t allow himself to be swayed away from the truth. On the other hand, in time like this, it was extremely difficult to live with.
There was hesitancy, but Sherlock finally moved from the bed and slowly led himself out of the room. The door, however, did not close, even as the footsteps descended.
“I just can’t understand why the prospect of us continuing this would send you into the end of a battle.”
John was so caught up in his depressing thoughts from the previous evening that he  missed the sadden glaze that passed over Sherlock’s eyes. He even missed the defeated tone he used to state, “Obviously I was wrong about my previous actions being able to fix you.”
“Well don't yell at him! It's my fault I didn't put her anywhere safe!”
“I already know that Lestrade! Do you think I'm stupid now!?” Sherlock growled and glared at the DI in front of him.
“Yes, for the millionth time. I have to watch this to understand what happened. I have to know so I can save John and the missing people.”
“Sherlock, stop.” John finally had to push himself into a mostly sitting position. The man was babbling, which only meant two things. One, he was showing off his genius, or two, he was nervous. Seeing as this conversation couldn't possibly be used as a way to impress John, that only left nervousness.
Since that night all Sherlock would initiate were kisses. Granted, many of the kisses that were exchanged became heated when there was nothing more interesting to do in the evenings. But they never turned into more than that. Which, more than just teasingly frustrated, confused John. Based off the first interaction, John had thought Sherlock would be determined to go all the way. After all, that was how Sherlock worked: all or nothing.
The dismissal caused Sherlock to frown. “You are in pain,” he stated plainly as if that were enough for him to be there.
Trust him to be gentle. Trust him to know exactly what needed to be done and when it needed to be done. Trust him to fix him.
Sherlock took the action for affirmation, gripped John’s sides with an almost bruising force and quickly moved them to the bed. Eyes closed, lost in the overwhelming presence of Sherlock, John allowed himself to be manhandled onto his back. He let his senses rule him, wanting nothing but what what Sherlock felt the need to do.
When he got low enough to cause an entirely different sort of pleasure, Sherlock had to pause in silent debate before deciding that John wasn’t quite ready for that, or in the right mind to consent. So he was technical in the way he continued to cleanse the man in front of him, and if Sherlock pressed forward to find friction for himself, he couldn’t be found completely at fault.
Despite Sherlock being a floor below him, John still tossed and turned at night at the images of a dead friend. He woke up in a cold sweat, forgetting momentarily that Sherlock was back in his life. He’d be making tea in a morose state, not remembering that he could make two cups without one going to waste. At the clinic, without seeing Sherlock in front of him, it was hard to accept that it was all real and he would continue to sink into depression. The crime scenes were the worst. Most times John was frozen until he followed Sherlock back to the flat.
When John woke up with a raging headache, he attempted to push himself into an upright position, but the sudden movement made things worse and his stomach began to churn angrily. He got out of bed as quick as possible, but it wasn’t quick enough to get to the restroom downstairs. If anything, it just made his stomach want to rid itself of its contents even faster. Fortunately, there was a bucket near his bed that hadn’t been there before.
“Your muscles are sore. I’m helping you relax them.”
Gentle teeth had found themselves at John’s left nipple, teasing it to hardness before moving on to the right. His free hand caressed his inner thigh, giving attention to every little reaction except for the one that ached the most.
The man leaned into him, pressing himself between John’s legs. “John,” he practically whispered, the sound causing goosebumps to appear on the doctor’s skin. “Let me do this for you.” And he moved in completely, his soft, perfect lips touching John’s.
John also hated the way he couldn’t immediately decline the offer, because having Sherlock helping him take a shower was an even worse idea than them kissing heatedly on the sofa. The problem was, John was suddenly re-imagining that kiss and how much pleasure had racked his body while his flatmate took control of the situation. Then he was thinking about how Sherlock would take control of the this situation, them being in the shower together, naked skin on skin, lost in the steam. John was already becoming flush before anything had the chance to start. What the hell had Sherlock done to him?
Sherlock nodded to agree with the statement, and changed his phrasing. “Why did you feel the need to go to the pub last night?”
It was odd, hearing him reassure like that. Sherlock didn’t do reassurances. They were meaningless - sentiment that did nothing of real value. He just did whatever he thought was best or whatever he wanted with little care to the consequences it had on the people around him, especially when it came to the emotional consequences.
It was a sound that John had missed sorely in the two years that Sherlock had been gone. Sometimes, in the depressing late evenings, alone to drown in his loss, John would imagine the soft notes that talented, long fingers would have played. They would haunt his nights, accompanying the images of Sherlock’s dead body.
Tears continued to fall, wracking the tired and aching body of the worn out soldier.
John could practically hear the deductions about his state. It was a superficial wound. All other pains that John displayed were psychometric, and therefore unimportant. For all his observations, and clever connections, he had never been able to understand the emotions behind motivation. Had never cared to try and understand.
At the sound of John’s voice, Sherlock did stop. His eyes were wide and vulnerable.
Up til then, all John could acutely be aware of was the blood rushing and his heart pound too fiercely against his chest. With Sherlock’s hands in his hair, though, everything felt like he was coming down from a high. He moaned from the absolute, calming pleasure of it and his eyes closed. Unaware of his physical reactions, he leaned into the touch, backing into the firm body behind him.
The music, for all the hauntingly familiar pain that it brought about in moment of an already vulnerable state of mind, was drowsy, and John began to drift into an uneasy sleep, his eyelids too heavy to stay open. He tossed and turned with cheeks stained with tears, sweat beginning to bead out of his pores. The violin’s strings were beautiful still, even to his failing conscious state, but in its beauty, it was heart wrenching.
He should have known that Sherlock wouldn’t keep his observations to himself and let John escape into the safety of a locked bathroom. “I don’t understand why you’re limping; you were barely grazed in the shoulder.”
As soon as he was finished speaking, he pivoted and headed into his room, shutting the door quietly behind him. John stared at the empty space that Sherlock had just left. It was only after the detective was out of sight, giving John the opportunity to gather his thoughts properly, that he was able top come back into himself.
Sherlock apparently had had enough with John’s stubbornness, for before John knew what the other was up, he was kneeling in front of the doctor. Without saying a word, Sherlock took John’s leg and began to massage it himself, kneeling the muscle expertly.
He was about to protest, just a little more than unsettled by the unpredictability, but couldn’t when strong fingers kneaded his calves with the expertise that the man did most things. Rather than speaking, John was too busy biting back a pleasurable moan.
Sherlock, as always had been correct in his observation that John was fine.At the very least, he was in better shape physically than the typical run ins they had with these type of criminals back when John made more of a habit to join his flatmate to a crime scene - more than two years ago. It really was just a graze. He wouldn’t even need stitches. Heck, after cleaning the area, he could probably get away without using a bandaid. Yet, he couldn’t shake the tremble that ran up his spine or keep the psychometric ache in his legs from causing his limp.
“Why did you feel the need to get drunk last night?”
John dropped his head into his hands. Of course Sherlock thought he was broken. He could deduce those type of things. It wasn’t even a new development. John had been broken for years, even before meeting Sherlock.
Yet there he was, his grayish, green eyes crinkling at the edges as if he had played a magnificent joke. If it was real, it was all too much. John’s knuckles formed a tight fist to be pulled back and strung out furiously at the taller man’s jaw. It was the blood on his hand that made John finally accept that his friend was alive.
Then one evening, about a week later something finally became more. John was in his chair watching TV inattentively and Sherlock was perched on the sofa, fingers clasped under his chin. During a commercial, the detective regally pushed himself off the cushions and in an instant was on the doctor. His strong but lanky legs straddled John, diving in for a heated kiss.
So, determined to appease his detective, to hold onto him at least a little bit longer, John answered by closing the distance between them and landing a soft kiss on velvet lips.
It was said like one of his observations, but John took it for the question that it was meant to be. “Yes,” he moaned as his back hit the doorframe of the bedroom.
When Sherlock returned, it was with a bucket, a glass of water, and Advil. John accepted the glass and pill without a word, unable to protest for to thank him. Sherlock didn’t seem to care. He stood by the bed, staring at John with narrowed, studious eyes, seeming to try to decipher a complicated case. It was extremely awkward.
Still, as much as Sherlock thought that this was about trust, or that trust needed to be involved in this, it wasn’t. This was about physical intimacy, about providing an extra piece to their new way of life as a means to bridge the tension that had come between them. So, he simply kissed the man that had him against the door, locking him in place with prominent hips.
He looked down at John, his eyes soft as he took in his flatmate's state, brows furrowed at what he was able to deduce. Awkward, but having made his decision, Sherlock lowered himself to sit at the edge of the bed and caressed the sweaty locks of hair from John’s forehead.
Lips smirked against his skin, which should have been annoying, but was, in this moment, decidedly seductive. “Yes?” The cool breath against his licked, perked nipple sent shivers throughout his entire body. “What is it you want from me?” Unable to form the words, all John could to answer was to thrust his hips upwards in an attempt to find friction.
As he heaved into the bucket, he could make out the sounds of hurried footsteps on the stairs. The door opened and suddenly John could feel a soothing hand on him, rubbing up and down his back in calming motions.
Answer your texts. -SH
John couldn’t hear the word. Couldn’t have the situation spoken to life to that extent. “But you did return. So everything is good.”
Nonsensical sounds were made in response, which only led to further smirking.
John winced as he hobbled up the stairs, ignoring the way Sherlock stared at the back of his head with narrowed, gray-green eyes. It was a look of stoic observation with a large dose of judgment, and John was not in the mood to deal with it. The only thing he was in the mood for was a hot shower to wash away the grit and blood that came from chasing after a deranged detective who was hell bent on cornering a serial killer.
“Shh John,” the other cooed, reaching his lips to nibble at John’s earlobe, putting more pressure on his wrists that were still captured above his head.
John was reading in his usual seat the next evening after work, massaging his muscles every now and then, with Sherlock pacing agitatedly from boredom. The tension between was palpable. They hadn’t spoken one another the entire day, which was on John because he was typically the person who broke the silence of the flat by asking what the detective had done that day or convincing the man to eat. That day, however, John had been too drained to do anything but retire in his chair and pick up a book, acting as if the other man hadn’t been lazing about all day in his robes.
