What he does remember after is the look in John’s eyes upon seeing him, the deep blue therein darkened in disbelief and hurt, the glance at Mary as though to confirm that Sherlock was no mere hallucination. The smash of his fist on the table, make the silver and glass jump and clink.
The ground is cold beneath him and the cold seeps upward into his tissues. “Fine,” Sherlock says stiffly. “Has this been a consistent doubt, or has it come and gone?”
Sherlock nods, agreeing without even knowing where this is going yet. “All right. What about?”
“Already in the toaster.” Sherlock moves away again, putting more distance between them, and John tells himself not to feel brushed off by this.
“No one at all,” Sherlock confirms, his mouth strangely dry.
Later, as they’re sitting by the fire with their books, John tries again. The food and wine and space have settled him, curbed his immediate and intense jealousy at the very concept, and he feels badly for having reacted the way he did. “Can I just ask…” He trails off, waiting for Sherlock to look up.
Sherlock looks up at him, incredulous. “Have you perchance forgotten that whole bit after Mary died and I nearly OD-ed?” he asks, squinting against the sunlight making a halo out of John’s hair in silhouette. “If anyone’s getting damaged goods here, I don’t think it’s me.”
John takes a breath, about to attempt to say something rather emotional, only then he hears the sound of Mrs Hudson’s heels starting up the stairs. He pulls back, exchanging a quick look of horror with Sherlock before scrambling to get himself out of Sherlock’s lap and everything zipped away again, Sherlock hastily doing the same. They’ve only just made it when she appears in the doorway with one of her hoots of greeting. “Anyone home?” she asks cheerfully, blissfully unaware that she’s only just missed walking in on them in a rather compromising position.
“John – ” Sherlock sounds agonised. “I want to – be able to handle this, next time. If there is a next time. I want to know what to do. I know it’s asking a lot, but you did say that you would teach me… would that extend to this?”
“No rush. Whenever you like.” Sherlock pulls out one of the chairs and sits down at the table, pulling over the meal card to have a look. “Do you want to hear tonight’s dinner options?”
another vehicle. He pulls his door shut, waits for John to do the same, then says, “Let’s just drive a little further. I want to see if – ”
“We are in Tyne and Wear in March,” Sherlock points out.
Sherlock lets the silence spin out a little longer, then says, “How do you mean?”
normally eat together, and he’s rather touched that Sherlock actively wanted to come home to him for this. “How did you get home? Did he drive you?”
It’s a different story when he wakes in the night this time, though: as with every other night in recent days, John jolts awake with a gasp, to the instant knowledge that he’s massively turned on and harder than anything, and the reason becomes clear a split second after that. He’s on his back, and Sherlock has turned in his sleep, an arm curled possessively over John’s chest, along with one leg over John’s, and he’s every bit as hard as John is. His body is moving instinctively in his sleep, his erection pressing up against John’s hip. The feel of it is so arousing that he’s got to swallow, and it’s very audible when he does. He turns his head to look at Sherlock, whose head is on his shoulder, face angled downward, his eyes closed, though there are lines between them and at the bridge of his nose. John takes a breath and opens his mouth, not even sure what he’s going to say.
“Ascertain whether or not a safety deposit box has been accessed here in London where the photographs were taken, first off, then go from there based on what we find. Anna is sending over a key to the deposit box as we speak, and they’re meeting us here as soon as they’ve flown over, first thing tomorrow morning,” Sherlock says briskly. “Once we’ve got the key, we’ll go to the bank.”
he’d pled, even as a wet-suited agent started climbing down the rope to him, his eyes locked on Sherlock’s face. And Sherlock hadn’t moved.
Sherlock looks very much as though he wants to say something but doesn’t know what to say, but it’s all there in the intensity of his eyes. Ella gives him a moment, but when he doesn’t find the words he needs, she decides to spare him. “Remember, though, this want has been held back for years, too,” she reminds John. “Suppressed and repressed and denied – it can take some work to unlearn that. To allow yourself to feel it, show it, not hide it. Your family history in terms of how Harry’s sexuality was received, your military background, and even the many comments your mutual friends have made implying that you and Sherlock were a couple when you weren’t, have all entrenched this sense of need to hide and deny it. That doesn’t come undone overnight, even when it’s just the two of you in private. Be aware that that could also come up. And Sherlock, this applies to you, too. You’ve spent years being told and firmly believing that feeling or showing sentiment is a sign of weakness and compromise. You’ve told me that John’s friendship with you puts him in danger, compromises you both. You’ve gone to extreme lengths to rectify that very danger. You will also need to spend some time unlearning that need to hide your heart away, deny yourself the right to love and to show love.”
Sherlock nods. “Okay.”
“Are we going to question the farmer?” John asks.
But since then, John’s gone and encouraged this, hasn’t he? Ragged him about it, even,
John looks at Sherlock, warily ready to spring to his defense if needed, but he’s curious to see how Sherlock will react to this.
that stuff!”
“Me,” John says flatly. “Like I said: all my issues are getting in the way.”
The officer hesitates, clearly wanting to protest, but the words die on his lips on meeting Sherlock’s gaze. “Oh, hell,” he mumbles. “All right, then, one minute.” He reaches for a radio. “Smith, what’s your twenty?” He pauses, static sounding back over the radio. “Smith, come in, please. Do you read?” He frowns at Sherlock, shaking his head. “Could be a faulty radio,” he says. “We’ve got a lot of old equipment.”
It doesn’t occur to John that the question may be slightly calculated. Not just then, at any rate. “Yeah, why not?” he responds, digging out his wallet as the server approaches their table. “I assumed we were.”
The hose fires off another round, plastering the contestants’ clothing to their bodies and Sherlock’s eyes are riveted to John and John alone. The t-shirt clings to his nipples and pecs and abdominal muscles, and Sherlock has the chance to note that even soft, John’s package is substantial. His mouth fills with saliva and he swallows, wishing he could see it aroused. While he feels a bit ashamed for looking, he simultaneously loves the fact that this is giving him a chance to finally see John this way. And yet, he also hates that all of these other people are seeing him, too. They all think that he gets this all of the time – how sad if they should find out that it’s Sherlock’s first time seeing this much of the man he lives with, too.
“Go ahead,” I say, gesturing toward it. “Be my guest! I just – didn’t want you to feel as though you had to.”
I smirk at him. “Since when have we ever concerned ourselves with behaving normally?”
Sherlock looks after him for a moment, silently loving him more than ever, then quickly pulls the soiled sheet from the bed and replaces it as quickly as possible and climbs back into the bed. “Ready,” he says, and John comes out again, switching off the light.
Again, this is received with laughter, this time slightly more nervous, and there is a lot of shuffling of feet. Margaret gives them a wave and a serene smile, but doesn’t say anything.
They get dressed nicely for dinner, both of them wearing suits, and sit down at a table in the corner where Todd and Kyle are beckoning. Kirk comes out of the kitchen to serve the bottle of pinot noir they ordered himself, congratulating them on their engagement, and John squeezes Sherlock’s hand under the table. Their salads are served and John turns to Todd. “So, it looks like things are going well around here,” he comments, and Todd nods and smiles.
John agrees, and they get into the appointed car and go home. They chat a little more about Jeremy and Scott, then John relaxes against the luxurious cushioning of the seat and asks, “What do you want to do tonight?”
Instant worry appears on her face. “Oh no! Is he all right?” Mrs Hudson wants to know.
He’d nodded. “She was rather secretive about her money, too. I always knew she had more than me, but we never really talked about it. I guess I can see why, now.”
John clears his throat. “Well, er, I’m widowed, as I think I said on my form. I’ve got a little girl. It was pretty recent, so… the short answer is that I haven’t got a love life at the moment. Haven’t looked for one.”
John locates said box and has a look. “What about this: it’s a ‘soothing blend of lavender, licorice root, and wildflowers’, supposedly meant to inspire calm and rest?”
“Not that I can detect,” John says wryly. “You’re the perfume expert. This is your field of expertise.”
“True,” Sherlock acknowledges. “I was going to offer to get you to Sarajevo – or wherever else we choose to go – and give you some space to process it on your own. I’m very much aware that you’ve only just woken up and haven’t had any time to deal with any of this just yet. The ramifications of everything that happened yesterday, I mean.”
It all happens in a nanosecond, a nightmare that he’s had thousands of times now – Sherlock sees Smirnov’s finger tightening on the trigger and barely has time to react – “No!” He careens into John, but the bullet has already fired by this point, and John cries out and hits the ground hard with Sherlock stumbling into him. Rage and panic flood his veins. Both Smirnov and the parachuter are advancing, obviously intending to finish them both, so Sherlock reacts on sheer instinct and dives for the Sig. Some part of his brain manages to focus, direct the shots. He hits Smirnov first, in the shoulder, then the parachuter, successfully getting the upper right quadrant of his chest, then throws himself at John, bent over him on his hands and knees.
John had shaken his head. “Did I?” he’d asked rhetorically. “I don’t even know any more.”
Sherlock inhales shakily and nods. “Yeah. You can – ”
At home, however, John is more careful, but Sherlock can sometimes manoeuvre the situation to present John with other opportunities. Oddly, the flirting (if it is that) happens the most when the extremes of John’s character are brought on – the ferocity of Captain Watson blazing in righteous fury, competence and strength radiating from his every pore, or else the oatmeal-jumper softness of John in the heart of domestic life, responsibly bundling away a bag of rubbish before coming to set a cup of tea down beside Sherlock, or draping a blanket across his shoulders and then kneeling to light the fire. Sherlock thinks that he doesn’t know which extreme he likes more, until the day he realises that what he loves best is the very juxtaposition of the two. Sometimes John will switch rapidly from one to the other, wrestling a criminal down to a dirty alley floor, snarling with a knee in the unfortunate’s back, then getting up as Lestrade & Co. arrive to take over, his tone abruptly softening to
What I’m going to do over is the way I said it. You deserve better than me shouting it at you, all angry from across a dark room because you were about to do something idiotically dangerous and I wanted to stop you. You deserve...I don’t know, candlelight and rose petals and specimens of questionable legality and anything that isn’t being distracted at the worst possible time. How’s that for poetry?
Sarah gave him a knowing look. "You might. We're using Sherlock Holmes for the plumber, you know."
“Bizet wrote more than one opera, John.”
“Normal,” Sherlock scoffed. “Where would the fun be in that?” John, still reeling, hadn’t noticed him stand up. “But now that we’re on the same page — how shall we start?”
The small sigh that escaped Sherlock’s lips as he sank to his knees was a reward in itself.
“Ah.” Sherlock felt the color rising in his cheeks. Damn his complexion. “It’s not a terribly good one, I’m afraid.”
“You’ve been unusually quiet.”
You looked so happy before you fell over. I wouldn’t have believed it if I hadn’t seen it. I had hoped, but I didn’t think...

John heard his fingers scrabbling against the wood of the table, felt him writhe beneath his hands, and, God help him, it was brilliant. He went on, alternating between light licks and deep thrusts, all the while squeezing Sherlock’s arse cheeks (
He would have been content to go on like that, would have given a good deal to find out if he could make Sherlock come from this alone, would have given his good right arm (

He had barely closed his eyes when a rustling made him look up. A blackbird was perched low in the branches above his head.
He licked down Sherlock’s cleft, drew his tongue over that tempting hole, doing it again when he felt Sherlock’s legs quiver, and again when he cried out. And after Sherlock canted his hips, obviously chasing the sensation when John had to pause to suck in a breath of air, he pushed his tongue

that they hadn’t seen before.”
Just like that, and there was nothing to hide behind. John had spent the last few hours—or maybe months, come to that—tamping down what he felt on the assumption that his attention would be unwelcome. It had been safer to stay behind the camera, and, frankly, less creepy, because John liked to think he was mature enough to recognize that someone who acted out sexual fantasies for a living wouldn’t appreciate being objectified like that in real life. And now this.

“And so we’re going to have a nice evening in, all watching the same opera through the magic of technology. It’s an elegant solution, and I know at least three of you are going to enjoy it.”
“Of course,” he said, continuing to stroke John with painstaking deliberation, “I’d be more than happy to get back on my knees and finish you off with my mouth, if that’s what you’d prefer.” His eyes flicked downward, and John followed his gaze to where his fingers circled John’s prick, just so. John made a soft keening noise; Sherlock grinned, and pressed a kiss to the corner of his mouth. “I told you I had high hopes, and they were justified – amply so – and I want to take your cock
Molly’s small, pert breasts, cupping them, kissing the soft skin, and rolling one nipple between finger and thumb while she licked the other in time with Sherlock’s ministrations.

He also knew the rabbit had likely died of fright—there were clear signs that it had been handled and released, probably by children unaccompanied by someone who would have known better than to pick up a kit. He knew that the bramble-berries were properly called
In between the shift from kitchen to living room, there were a few minutes for a bit of rest and drinks of water, during which Molly pulled on her coat and Sherlock drifted off to one side without touching his costume. He just stood by the window, bottle of water in one hand and mobile in the other, apparently unconcerned that he was half-hard or that his coveralls might slip off his arse while he was texting.
That is all I want. But I will put that dream—and this pen—aside for now.

“You’re staying with me?” asked the fox after a while. The bird was flying just over his shoulder, and still keeping pace.
“Hush, you do this often enough for me,” said Sherlock, as ever reading John’s thoughts from the set of his mouth and the furrow of his eyebrows. He wrapped the ice pack in the flannel as he crossed the room, then settled on the bed next to John, gently maneuvering his head onto his lap and carefully, carefully putting the ice pack on his eye.
It wasn’t true that John lay awake at night, unable to sleep because of that cock. No, the insomnia was mostly down to PTSD and the crushing uncertainty of the future (his therapist had told him that blogging would help, but he couldn’t do that, not really, not with what he did for a living, his

) coveralls, into his path when she started on the kitchen. Collision happened, mostly between the last bin John was carrying and Sherlock’s armful of plumbing tools and real people clothes.
“You were starting to cite erotic asphyxiation. I was afraid you’d get ideas. I take it you’re glad we’re almost home?”
At least nothing was broken. He raised a hand, elbow and shoulder protesting all the way, and gingerly touched a spot just above his cheekbone. Pain blossomed beneath his fingertips. He didn’t know what else he’d been expecting.
I have harsher words for anyone who condones the events of January 6th and the four years that led up to it, but I'll put that anger elsewhere.
The fox was having trouble.
Good geese, these times are more interesting than I bargained for - and this is speaking after 2020. I hope you are all safe. I hope things get better - no, I hope we can
“And here he is.” John bent low and sniffed. “Can’t smell any alcohol on him. Could be a seizure, possibly drugs...”
“Yes, boss.”
“Yeast. I know a baker who owes me a favor.”
“That...didn’t go badly.”
It was a miracle it didn’t cost John the money shot (though he liked to think that any divine intervention had been aided by his professionalism, judgment, and forty-odd years of experience at Keeping His Shit Together). He did, however, look away from the camera for a split second, catching a brief, heady eyeful of dark, close-cropped pubic hair, nicely defined abdominals tensed with exertion, and - John was fully aware this was a lot for a brief look - those extraordinary eyes fixed on him.
If I can say nothing else, I will say this: There are those who would have it that I was seduced to this cause, for I had once sworn to serve Queen and country. They are wrong. I have long had my own ideas regarding the Ones who would call Themselves our masters. All my companion did was enable me to take action, when I would have otherwise spent the remainder of my life mired in futile horror and despair.
I’m about to take back saying I love you.
This last venture allowed us to proceed at a more leisurely pace than usual, which is, perhaps, why I find myself able to think of more than the work that is in front of me. My companion was content to play the long game, treading the boards for over a year all over the Continent, and the results were better than I had dared hope at the outset.
“Shower’s free!” said Molly brightly, emerging from the bathroom in a cloud of steam and inadvertently saving John both from gawking at Sherlock without a camera to hide behind and from swatting him with the bin for making this shoot harder than it had to be.
“It’s still amazing.”
And, but for the bristles a man has at the end of the day, his chin was indeed bare when he kissed me. He did not mind my own whiskers when I returned his affections, but I like to think that they are less offensive than the ridiculous beard he affects as Altamont.
Now they’re back in their room, and suddenly things feel awkward again. Not terribly so, but enough that Sherlock is certain that John’s noticed, too. John strips down to his boxer shorts and changes into an old t-shirt while he’s in the bathroom brushing his teeth. Sherlock changes quickly, taking John’s lead in terms of attire. He doesn’t own boxer shorts, but brought boxer briefs specifically for this event, and pulls on a t-shirt long enough for modesty. When John comes out of the bathroom, Sherlock goes in and brushes his teeth and washes his face. He uses the toilet, then washes his hands and re-enters the main room with some trepidation.
He’d been weeks away from death, Molly’d said. And yet he still wanted to work. Was still convinced that he could, at least with John there with him. John takes a deep breath. “Are you asking for my opinion?” he asks, just wanting to be sure.
Sherlock looks at him in astonishment as they turn onto Baker Street. “That far back?”
“Hey,” John says, quieter now. “I do want to hear this. I really want to.”
John gives her a grateful look. “See you later,” he says, and then they’re out the door, Sherlock already flagging down a taxi. They fall into it. “Tell me,” John says, his voice a mixture of intensity and excitement. They haven’t had a particularly challenging case for a little while now and he’s been bored.
Sherlock grins. “You do now,” he says archly. “So: take-out menus. Got it. I’m also going to hunt out those tins of baking.”
My chest warms. “Go on, then,” I tell him, and it feels breathtakingly important, just – opening myself to him like this. “I’m all yours for the seeing.” My eyes on his, I bend a little and slip off my briefs, stepping out of them and straightening up again. My cock is obscenely hard now, pointed shamelessly up at his face, my balls swollen and heavy. I’ve always canted a little to the left, and now is no exception. Suddenly I hope he won’t be put off by that.
Sherlock nods, though, not refusing him. “Right at the height of it. I was captured, not all that far from here, though I didn’t know precisely where I was at the time. I was – running. They brought me here. I never thought I would make it out. It’s where Mycroft finally intervened.”
“I disagree,” Ella says firmly. “You said once, within months of having met Sherlock, that he turned your life around, gave you a sense of purpose again for the first time since your return from Afghanistan. Sherlock, you told me at one of your appointments following Mary’s death that your sole purpose since your return from your two years away was John’s happiness – the first time you had ever prioritised something above puzzle solving and casework. You both believe the other to be a better version of himself than the other believes himself to be. You both use superlatives like ‘best’, ‘bravest’, ‘kindest’, ‘cleverest’, et cetera. You see versions of each other that no one else sees, and I think that at your best and healthiest, you do bring out those aspects of one other.”
My hands go to him like magnets, pulling him close first, then right on top of me as we kiss. I’ve never experienced this, either: having someone this much bigger than me looming over me this way. There were a couple of taller women, to be sure, but those times I definitely would have made sure to take the lead, assert my own masculinity, whatever that means. I guess I can admit that I’m a bit sensitive about that sort of thing. It happens when you’re short, and then I was in the med corps on top of it, so people assume you just can’t handle combat or something. Nothing about this is setting off any of those defenses, though. I know he’s totally new to this, writhing against me out of instinct and desire rather than knowledge or prior experience, and it feels amazing. My cock’s been semi-hard since watching the news on the sofa and the feel of his against mine, much more directly than through his trousers and my jeans, is enough to get me all the way hard in seconds. I’m fucking
“That we did. What do you think of the crispy prawn rolls?” he asks and Sherlock agrees, and silently allows the subject of last night to fall by the wayside.
“Nothing. Never mind.”
I ask myself sometimes how I got to this point in my life.
Sherlock nods again. “Okay.” His voice is muffled.
Mycroft gives a smile that’s at least fifty-eight percent grimace. “It’s hardly as though you gave me a choice, Mother.”
Sherlock crawls across the bed and lets John pull him back on top of him and they kiss, and the intimacy of touching this way, nothing separating them now, is exquisite. They kiss for a bit, slowly, savouring the new sensations, their penises rubbing together between them, bodies touching absolutely everywhere. John gets a palmful of lubricant out of the tube he chose and rubs it over them both and Sherlock makes such a loud sound that it alarms him. He pushes himself against John, seeking all the friction he can get, desperate for it, and John moves his hand in favour of putting both on Sherlock’s arse, steadying their rhythm as Sherlock thrusts against him. They’re both panting too hard to kiss now, but it’s okay – Sherlock goes and goes, pleasure curling into every recess of his body. John is moaning without restraint, cursing and saying his name along with extremely vocal affirmations of everything that Sherlock is doing. They’re both moving, John lifting to thrust back against him, but then the desperation spikes, Sherlock’s voice an octave higher than it was, and John gets his hand around both their penises and grips, jerking his fist over their erections. It feels so intensely good that Sherlock can't breathe. His vision blurs for a second and then his body spasms violently and he comes harder than he ever has in his life before this very moment, pumping out jets of hot, wet release. He can’t stop coming, his testicles emptying themselves onto John’s stomach and chest, and John’s voice is high and breathy now. Sherlock is still coming when John’s body jerks and he starts, too, the spurt of his release hitting Sherlock in the stomach, and the sound he makes is low and primal and makes Sherlock’s body spasm one more time.
Sherlock doesn’t know what to say to this. “I don’t know. I just know that I can. I already have. I don’t care what any therapist has to say about it. I don’t care about the shoulds and shouldn’ts of how I’m supposed to feel or not feel. All I care about is you. I don’t care that you’ve been drinking. I don’t care about you not feeling up to taking care of Rosie. None of that matters to me one bit. Only you.”
But there is no time. I do not know how long we have here.
Take very good care, my dears.
Molly and Sherlock’s knees (privately John was of the opinion that there was no way anyone could have remained oblivious to that, but he was in the wrong business to be looking for logic), and Molly was biting her knuckles, with her other hand spread on the vinyl tablecloth for support (not very sexy decor, but easy to dispose of). Then at a signal from Sarah, Irene slid her hands up Molly’s thighs, her red nails vivid against the other woman’s skin as she pushed her skirt up.
“Why wouldn’t I?”
And then that became Sherlock pulling away from them, taking his cock in his hand, working himself with hard, urgent strokes until he came - as Sarah directed - all over the women in front of him.
“Because you can? Look, Sherlock, it’s just because that’s how many squares it takes up in the puzzle. Do you have any letters already?”
) to have a whole day to take Sherlock apart with just his mouth (
“Fairy dust?”
If forced to describe it - and he had been, once, at letter opener-point by a Sarah who’d been editing video descriptions for the studio’s website - John would have to say that it wasn’t an industry standard cock, not as huge as some, but there was something about the curve of it when erect and the shape and proportion of the head that was, well,
“Fuck,” swore John, but that was all he had time to say before Sherlock had him in his mouth again, swallowing around him, and making the most delicious, filthy noises.
“’S fine, I know how he is. Just put the mutual admiration on hold ‘till I hang up, okay? So you’re saying you think Suarez did it?”
“That sounds different from last night’s music.”
This was going to kill John. It really was. He was going to die of Having to Watch Two Women Give Sherlock Holmes a Blow Job From a Distance of Approximately None At All, probably a first in medical history, and then Sarah would bring him back so she could kill him again herself.
You’ll want to know why this matters now, of course.
Well, thought John, that was the attitude one could expect of someone in the middle of shooting a porn film. Look at Irene: she didn’t give a shit that her blouse had fallen open. And John ought to have been able to give no shits as well, this was what he did for a living, only one more day at the office, so to speak, people went unclothed around him all the time, it was the entire point of his - aha - body of work, but here he was, barely able to function because of something he’d seen at least a dozen times before, even accounting for the fact that he’d always found Sherlock approximately as hot as the surface of the sun. He was starting to wonder what had gotten into him today, or if Mrs. Hudson might have drugged the water, when Sarah seized him by the arm and steered him to the corner furthest from Sherlock.
John. The fifth!”
“You got that from just one look at a crime scene photo?”
Finally, after a protracted scene where Irene lay on top of Molly and the two of them made out while Sherlock fucked them in turns (
The last thing he expected or needed was to find the reason for his uncomfortable night lurking behind the stables just after sunrise, in what was supposed to be
If only John had told him to piss off when he deduced his military career from his face and his leg.
John grit his teeth. He reminded himself that this was hardly the most difficult situation he’d ever been in (he’d been through
The fox considered this. He had never felt compelled to seek out human habitation. In fact, he’d gone out of his way to avoid the town these people must have come from, knowing with utter conviction, from both his fox-brain and the ghost of his former self that lived in his head, that tangling with humans meant trouble. “None of that was me.”
He didn’t like to fall back on that excuse (he still limped - psychosomatic, Ella said - though it was better than it had been), but his knee

"...and he ends up snaking the pipes," finished John. Yes, he knew about that trope. "Okay. And we're shooting this, how?"
“Not good?” Sherlock sounded genuinely taken aback, if not contrite, which mollified John somewhat.
“Sorry,” huffed Sherlock.
“I have kids, don’t I? And I take a batch round to the office sometimes. They tell me I should try out for

“Sherlock, I did find some ear plugs. Look—”
"What about him?" Sherlock asked, nodding in the direction of the camera. There was a burning intensity in his eyes that nearly had John making another shameful noise. He was rather more successful at keeping this one in.
It did not escape John that Irene’s lips had traced that very same path today, at Sarah’s direction, but that - well, that had been for
“I hope you don’t mind me hanging around,” he said one morning. “But talking to you reminds me that the feathers and wings isn’t who I am really, and I think that’s important.”
“You could have asked me out for drinks,” said John faintly. “You know, like a normal person.”
“Good. And, Sherlock, I know they’re just getting into the swing of things here...”
Well. Hand. Just the one.
“Trust me, those two’ll give you one hell of a workout.”
“This is new,” he said, curling his fingers around the mug. It was an unfamiliar tea, but not unpleasant.
“The last unmarked package I remember was from Moriarty.”
John shuddered. “Jesus.”
I don’t know why I’m writing this. Logically, I know that if I go back and change things and it works, there won’t be any reason for me to write this and therefore I won’t ever have written. And if I go back and it doesn’t work - same difference, I guess. But just in case, for whatever reason, if I’m not able to tell you myself, I’m leaving this here for you to find.
“Oh, hi, Sherlock. You recorded that confession then? Why didn’t you tell us before?”
“Perfect,” he murmured, drawing his fingers appreciatively along John’s length. “
Sherlock laughed, gamely letting John pull him down onto the bed. The ice pack slipped off to the side, quite forgotten.
“Obviously not. Consider the psychology of the individual and where the medallion was found. Suarez is a witness, not a murderer, and a scared one at that. Be nice when you talk to her. Now, where were we, John?”
“Exactly.”
“Mm.”
“I mean,” John’s mouth went on, taking direction from a heretofore undiscovered sensible part of his brain at the
), from the back and in profile, as he thrust in and out of Molly, John was rather proud of how he was doing.
"Let's give her a turn, shall we?" she said, patting Molly's knee and giving the camera a decidedly naughty wink.
Sherlock’s hand stopped just at the midline of his waist. “Aren’t you enjoying it?”
“Literally everywhere. There’s one in practically every Catholic church, and people carry prayer cards and wear medallions. Like that one there, in the corner, by the crates. I’d say you’re looking for a Catholic.”
John gives him the card. “Bedtime for me, I think.”
After a little, John lifts Sherlock’s face and they kiss, and it’s slow and sensual and incredible. When it eases off, Sherlock puts his face back where it was and digs his arms beneath John to hold him as tightly as he can, and John’s arms are just as tight around his back. This is it, Sherlock thinks blurrily. They’ve crossed the threshold now. They are lovers, and no one can deny it or take it away from them, not even they, themselves. It’s not a distant, unrealistic hypothetical. Their combined DNA is the evidence, there on their very skin.
The bathroom door opens at last and Sherlock lets himself look. John is naked now, too, his erection at eighty percent or so, and seeing it makes Sherlock’s mouth water. They’ve touched each other with their hands and mouths repeatedly, but so far it hasn’t progressed much beyond that – it hasn’t needed to; everything they’ve done so far has been both exciting as well as extremely satisfying, and novel enough to keep them both more than sufficiently entertained. Now, however, Sherlock senses that John intends to explore further, and the thought is breathtaking.
Sherlock has also learned better than to turn down John’s offers of help. He’s learning. Slowly. “All right,” he says carefully. “I was also thinking about making a salad to go with, so… perhaps you could look after that?”
Sherlock sighs. “It’s my brother,” he says, beneath his breath.
And so he does it. Not because he wants in any way for John to go through with it and marry Mary, but because it’s what John wants, or thinks he wants. Sherlock feels certain that, at least in certain moments, it could be more, between them. It could have been more. Perhaps that’s the correct wording. Perhaps if that day at Bart’s Hospital had never occurred. Perhaps if he had never disappeared, lied to John, made him grieve. It’s clear now that John may have forgiven him, but he isn’t about to give him a second chance at breaking him the way Sherlock saw him break at his grave site. John’s choice of Mary over him is the consequence of his own actions. It’s as simple as that.
Mary shakes her head and smiles a little. “Never mind. It’s fine. It’s a compliment on my technique, if anything.”
They unpack a little and John makes them coffee. “How soon did you want to head out?” he asks.
. He can feel the heat of John’s torso through his shirt, against his own, and that’s addictive, too. He can feel himself shuddering, pressing against John to drink in more of that heat, feel John’s heart beating against his own, but questions begin to push their way insistently forward, too. Eventually he pulls away a little to ask some of them. “But where did this all come from?” he wants to know, still confused. “I mean – I know things were better after Culverton Smith, but – was it just coming home again? Or what made you suddenly think to bring it up after so long?”
“Chez Pierre,” he repeats, incredulous. “I thought they had a six-month wait list to eat there!”
I can’t help it. I go to him and take his face in my hands. “I’m sure whatever you choose will be perfect,” I tell him, meaning it. “After yesterday, nothing could ruin having brunch together.”
“Lest I turn my memory of it into something it never was?” Sherlock asks, his lip twisting as he carefully inserts a raw wire back into its feed with a pair of needle-nosed pliers.
John begins to talk about the case they just solved and Sherlock comes out of his reverie to join in until the server returns with their samosas: fully the size of a side plate and piping hot, the server beaming with pride as though he made them himself. Sherlock can smell the cumin seeds and the hot grease of the pastry and his mouth begins to water. Yes: this was a very good idea, coming here.
He was already doing it, running the back of a finger up and down Sherlock’s abdomen through his open coat. Sherlock looked down at it. The touch was arguably miniscule, yet the sensation it was incurring was almost alarming in its magnitude. He’d never responded to anyone touching him that way before. It was not unpleasant. It was far from being unpleasant. Rather the opposite, in fact. His face hidden, he must have nodded.
Sherlock’s lips press together self-consciously, but he nods. “I’ve… missed it, too,” he says, his voice barely audible. “I want to believe Ella that we’re not beyond repair,” he says, his eyes doing a thing that makes John’s gut ache. “I don’t think we are. As long as you still want this.” He hesitates, then specifies, sounding self-conscious. “Me.”
That stops John in his tracks. “Oh God,” he says, a bit stunned by the realisation. “You’re right. She must have known the entire time.” He looks down at Rosie, who is blinking sleepily. He touches her cheek, then pulls her blanket up over her, her bear tucked in beside her. “That’s the last piece of the puzzle. Of course. So she chose her own out, pulled this fake act of ‘heroism’ to punish me over the affair. I’d be willing to bet that Norbury was even in on it. She probably didn’t even fire a bullet. And on top of it, Mary will certainly remember that even in her so-called death, I couldn’t muster the words, couldn’t say that I loved her.”
John feels even less sure of himself. “Er – d’you want me to – ”
John accepts this. He busies himself by running the hot tap and crouching to get his kit out from under the sink for some alcohol, a roll of gauze, and some sturdy medical tape. Next, he wets a flannel, then gives his entire attention to the length of Sherlock’s back. The blood from the cord slashes has dripped, drying in thick, dark tracks, but the cuts themselves are still oozing bright red blood. The damage is worst where the plug end hit. The cuts are the deepest there, the skin jagged and torn. “Just keep nice and still,” John advises, and pats as gently as he can. He’s bracing himself not for the fact that the alcohol will sting Sherlock, but for another round of panic, he realises, and forces himself to relax. The panic doesn’t resurface, however; Sherlock inhales a bit sharply, but apart from that he just holds himself still. Too still, in fact. There’s tension in every line of his body, but John supposes that he must be in pain. He dabs carefully at the oozing cuts, trying to clean away enough of the blood to see just how deep they go. It’s not as bad as it could be, he sees, though the deeper wounds where the plug tore into Sherlock’s back are considerably uglier. John rinses the flannel and starts again. A healthy bit of bleeding of the wounds is good for preventing infection, and the mild heat of the flannel could help with the pain, too. But then he sees something else and his hand stills mid-air. “Sherlock…”
“I’m sorry, Sherlock, but I’m still at work, and we’re very busy today,” Molly tells him, sounding flustered. “I would otherwise. You know I would.”
“Budge over, there,” John says over his shoulder, so Sherlock shifts closer to the wall.
“I’m sure,” Sherlock tells him, and John moves closer still and curls his head forward to kiss Sherlock, still holding him by the erection, his fingers still buried inside him.
Sherlock pauses for a long moment, but then nods, so John leans over and gives him an awkward, side-on hug, one arm around Sherlock’s shoulders, avoiding the lashes on his back, the other looped around his arms and knees all together. Sherlock makes no move to hug back, but after a moment or two, the tension fades from his frame and he relaxes tangibly.
John stops to clear his throat, and Sherlock, recognising that he’s getting emotional, reaches up and puts a hand on his back. John clears his throat again and stops to smile down at him. “Go on,” Sherlock says softly.
“It would, yes,” John retorts, leaning over Sherlock to say it, and Mycroft sighs and subsides, then turns to Lestrade, presumably to vent his complaints to him.
“You’re not. I was early,” Corey assures him. “Thanks for coming. I know it’s weird that I asked.”
“Erm – ” Sherlock reaches into the kit. “Yes.”
Sherlock waves this off. “Take your time.” John goes, and Sherlock looks at the child of the man he loves. “All right, Watson,” he says. “Bath time.”
Irene stares at him. “You’re joking,” she says. “Sherlock. Seriously, tell me that you’re joking.”
“Right,” Sherlock says, nodding obediently. “Of course.”
“I like the way you think.” John grips him tightly and they get to the top of the stairs. “Thanks.”
Sherlock’s lips press together a little. “I know that. And yes. I’m sure. Stay.” He hesitates. “Please.”
“I’m well aware of that fact,” John says tersely. “She’s run off, all right? Sherlock and I are going to find her and bring her back. Can you take Rosie or not?”
John’s chest and cock both swell, the latter twitching visibly against his lower belly. “That might be painting it a bit thick,” he tries, but the truth is that he’s pretty damned tickled by this.
“Got it,” comes Lestrade’s voice, the volume dialed extremely low. Sherlock switches off the audio lest the static carry across the field to where someone, likely Smirnov, is waiting. The next set of flashes comes, twenty metres up. The party on the ground responds immediately this time. “Steady,” Sherlock says under his breath, and John’s hands regrip the Sig in preparation.
Sherlock makes a sound of definite interest at this. “Vindictive,” he comments, with amusement. He pulls out
The rest of the day is interminably long and bleak. He goes for a long walk in the afternoon, hoping against hope that when he gets home an hour later, Sherlock will have returned, but the flat is as empty as it was when it left. Eventually, supper time rolls around and John still hasn’t heard anything. He’s not going to go texting Sherlock again, though, pestering him when he obviously doesn’t want to talk to him. Depressed, John decides to feed Rosie, whom he collected in the late afternoon so that Mrs H could make herself some supper in peace, then puts her to bed and orders in for himself. The thought of cooking for him and him alone is too much. Where
“Scott,” his partner volunteers.
Liz smiles at him. “Drink your coffee,” she says gently. “It’s probably getting cold.”
“See you next week,” she tells him with a smile. It’s a smile that says that she’d be open for a drink sometime, if John ever wanted. Or he thinks it does. Maybe it doesn’t.
– more than fine – and I want him to feel like he’s in control, especially this first time being totally naked with someone, having what really feels like sex for the first time. What happened earlier on the sofa counts, I think hazily, hearing myself moaning out loud, into his ear, but this is different. This is more intimate. This is another line crossed.
He walks away, tears still blurring his vision, his gut churning. An agent opens the door of the helicopter for him and he climbs into its relative warmth. Inside, he takes off his jacket and puts it around Rosie, who is fretting and beginning to cry.
“Sure?” John asks, and Sherlock makes a sound of assent. “Okay, then.” He gives it five minutes, just enough to get his brain sleepy, then reaches for the lamp and sets the room to darkness. It’s good they had the conversation about him staying down here, he thinks, turning carefully onto his side to face the same way as Sherlock without getting too close. It feels legitimised now, almost normal. (It’s good. It’s really good.)
Suddenly a thought occurs to me. “God, I hope Mrs Hudson isn’t in,” I say, and Sherlock begins to laugh.
John clears his throat. “Harry, if you’ll give me your plate, I’ll give you some of this cauliflower.”
Sherlock’s brow furrows a little, the little lines that John’s secretly loved for years appearing at the bridge of his nose. “What – how do you mean?”
John shakes his head. “I’d say I’ve punished you far more than enough.” He sounds bleak.
John nods. “Yes.” He pulls his panna cotta closer and takes a bite. It’s delicious. Liz is a far better cook than he is. “For all of the reasons mentioned. Yes. And we can talk about the adoption thing, as long as I’m still one of her legal parents. I’m not giving that up for anything, ever.”
Mary shrugs. “Dinner and a movie?” she suggests. “It’s date night and neither of us have got dates, thanks to the pricks in our lives, so why not?”
“What?” Jodie looks confused, then remembers. “Oh, yeah – that was the same wedding, in fact. What were their names? It was in Jamaica, a place called Runaway Bay.”
John’s answer is entirely nonverbal, which was precisely what Sherlock wanted. He kisses back with every ounce of his energy and thinks back to the first time he held John on the sofa at Mary’s beige flat, limp and hopeless, then of Ella’s words about them not building a city from the foundations up, but rather rebuilding something out of broken pieces, a city after a war. This has felt like a war zone, with higher emotional stakes than Sherlock ever thought he might have to endure, but they’ve emerged victorious on the other side. Time to plant their banner on the ramparts, then, because Rome has risen from its ashes.
Sherlock started by rubbing it directly onto John and now he’s touching both of them jointly, his hand big enough to wrap around them both, breathing hard all the while. He abandons the tube and moves back onto John. “And now I just… like before?” he asks, and John nods, too quickly.
My mind wanders again. I do not often have the luxury to reminisce, and it is rarer still that I find myself inclined to recall my military history.
"Molly sweetheart, don't change a thing," instructed Sarah, tucking a strand of hair behind Molly's ear. "Let's say that you just came home from your shift at the hospital. Just put on a skirt instead of those slacks, easy access, you know."
This is not a confession. That would necessitate some measure of guilt or acknowledgment of wrongdoing, and there was nothing wrong in ridding the world of one such as he. My only remorse is that we did not strike sooner, and the only sin I will admit to is taking pride in the act.
I suppose if you want to get all technical about it, we’re all time travelers of a sort. Going in one direction at a uniform pace still counts as movement after all. Though that’s not really my point. It’s my roundabout way of getting to the point, which is that it’s...not quite the same for me.
Sherlock’s eyes do something that makes his heart pang. “You
John nudges him; Lucas is just pulling back from the table. Sherlock nods minutely, chews and swallows the last bite of his pistachio macaron, and drains his coffee. It’s now five minutes after one. “Go,” John says quietly. “I’ll stay on – ” he indicates Paul with a jut of his chin.
Now Sherlock does frown a little. “What about Rosie?”
Sherlock is still in bed, which is unusual; he’s often up before John even on days when they’ve got nothing on, like today. At least, if nothing’s come up on the blog. John decides to check his own, as well as have a look at the online news to see if anything’s been reported there. He’ll wait a bit to see if Sherlock gets up soon, and if so, whether he wants to eat together or what. They usually do, after all. He scans the blog first and there’s nothing, but then, the bulk of their cases usually come through Sherlock’s blog. He’ll check that next. He wants to have a look at the news, though, and runs a google search on Sherlock and Corey’s names together, privately wondering whether Sherlock is sleeping better than usual having just had his first real shag. Of sorts. John sees the first search results, but it’s only the online version of the
“It’s a distinct possibility,” Sherlock admits. He, too, glances at the house. “Well, if we’re being played, then the only thing for it is to play along.” He ties the rubbish bag closed again. “Let’s take the parachute,” he decides.
Suddenly the fire alarms go off and the room is filled with chaos, panicked shoppers and diners stampeding for the exits. I wonder uneasily if Horton Ellis isn’t up to something more intricate than we suspected.
, John wrote, still not acknowledging it directly, yet nonetheless implying it. It helps to know that some of the things which Sherlock has done his utmost to firmly prevent himself from hoping for, from even thinking of, much less lose himself to senseless fantasy over, were real possibilities after all. Not that any of that matters now, because John is gone, taking with him any sense of purpose or reason to Sherlock’s existence.
Molly frowns. “No, why would I have? I’m a pathologist, not – ”
“Right. I’ll just check on Rosie and Mrs H and see what’s what. If they’re both asleep, I’ll leave her there,” John says, and Sherlock nods and goes upstairs.
“Okay,” Sherlock says cautiously. “What do you want to start with? Where do we even begin?”
“Scott didn’t eat his breakfast,” Doug says. “We ran into him when we were coming in and he looked like he was in a hurry. Maybe he’s not feeling well!”
Molly can feel the prickliness radiating off Sherlock’s words and knows when to back off.
“And the other twenty percent of the time?” Todd prods. “Do you top those times?”
“No, you didn’t,” Mycroft agrees. “But you understand my current position. I am therefore going to make you an offer, one which I hope you will consider thoroughly before you come to a decision.” He studies John for a moment, then goes on. “If you decide to pursue Mary, I will give you everything needed to aid you to that end: funds. Information. Travel arrangements. Anything you could possibly need or want.”
This is raw, unvarnished honesty, and Ella silently applauds him for it. “Well expressed,” she says, then turns to John. “John? Can you give us your experience of this event?”
“We’ll make it work,” Sherlock tells him. “The conference is over tomorrow. Once we’re out of here, the cover part is over and then we’ll be free. We just need to solve the case.”
Sherlock smiles at him. “We all make mistakes,” he says diplomatically. “The point is that you see her clearly now.”
, he feels that it’s absolutely true. The thought of Sherlock teaming up with someone else makes him feel like he’s been punched in the gut, actually nauseated. It’s every bit as bad as the notion of Sherlock being into someone like Greg. Someone other than him. Anyone. John unwittingly thinks of Irene Adler, then Janine, and the same mixture of hot resentment and embarrassment comes over him. He knows he couldn’t hide his overt jealousy of either one of them, and he still couldn’t now if the subject were to come up. He doesn’t even know what he was doing, that night that he said all that stuff, about Irene. Was he just trying to put Sherlock off the scent? He doesn’t even know. And now with Greg, the other day… it’s not as if anything would happen there, as Greg seems pretty content with Stacey, but the very idea of Sherlock being into someone, especially a male someone, and it not being him – John comes to a dead end street, sets off to the right, and acknowledges grimly to himself that he could not possibly handle seeing Sherlock dating someone. Especially not a man, somehow. He doesn’t know why that’s worse, but it is.
“Sherlock.”
John’s smile has turned predatory. “Do share,” he invites.
The taxi leaves them at the restaurant five minutes later, and it gives them the perfect thing to focus on: post-case dinner at their favourite, go-to restaurant. It’s not only safe, John thinks: it’s actively good. There’s no one else he’d rather be having dinner with, at any time of the day or night. It’s perfect.
“Er – as soon as possible,” John says, wincing a little.
“Here we are,” Sherlock agrees. He turns his head a little and presses a kiss into John’s hair. “Would it be terribly inappropriate of me to suggest that you take me to bed and ravish me? It’s been hours since the last time. Though if you’re not in the mood, considering…”
He doesn’t. Instead, he finds the power switch and turns it off. “It was hidden in his shaving kit,” he informs me coolly. “Now would you agree that the dildo situation is grounds for suspicion?” Without waiting for an answer, he says, imperiously, “Evidence bag,” his arm thrusting the sex toy out at me.
Sherlock makes what arrangements he can in advance. It’s surprisingly easy, given that they’re already planning a large event. They had a quiet Christmas, spending the twenty-third through twenty-sixth with Sherlock’s parents. Mycroft came for the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth only, but was surprisingly well-behaved throughout. Sherlock and John went snowshoeing with Sherlock’s father and all five of them went skating on Christmas Day in the nearby town square, even Mycroft, and later they trooped back inside to the warmth of the fire and hot chocolate laced with liqueur and exchanged gifts. Because of the wedding, Sherlock and John had said they would keep to a strict fifty-pound budget. Sherlock bought John two new jumpers (one navy cashmere, one in finely-knit burgundy wool) and a watch, exceeding the budget by at least twenty pounds, but John didn’t scold him over it. John gave him a shirt in a deep pine green, so dark it’s nearly black, and a newly-released book on the latest discoveries in forensic science that Sherlock had seen in a bookshop one day and exclaimed over, plus tickets to see a rather good violinist play a lot of music that Sherlock particularly likes. John must have reached the budget limit on the tickets alone, but Sherlock circumspectly kept his mouth shut about this observation in turn.
“You don’t need to read it now,” Molly assures him quickly. She knows that this letter will devastate him, if he believes that it truly is from John, and much as she wants their friendship to die a swift death, it still hurts to do this to him. Sherlock looks up at her, not comprehending, so she does it, twists the knife to make him understand. “I’m sorry, Sherlock. He says – John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help…”
, Mycroft? Why did you send him away?”
John doesn’t deny this. “Sherlock
“Two weeks.” Sherlock grimaces a little. “I haven’t forgotten about that.”
and he almost shudders. He clears his throat. “Are you suggesting that we consider it a possible location?”
Sherlock thinks for a moment. “It’s essentially a sociological study. About how different societies are formed.”
Sherlock nods again, obedient. “Agreed.”
“Right. And one of those nutters is maybe going to attack the city’s Pride parade,” John responds evenly. “New York City: I’d imagine that’s a big one.”
“Perfect. And a salad, maybe.” John smiles at him. This is nice. He checks the time. “It’s only just after two now. Why don’t we drink our tea and you can tell me about the rest of the morning, and what you and Corey did for lunch?”
“Oh. No, I guess not,” John admits.
Mycroft winces. “Sherlock… you’ve got it wrong. Redbeard was a
he’d said, his voice low.
John’s face relaxes. “That’s a brilliant idea,” he says. “Music can be incredibly therapeutic.”
“Yes, certainly,” Ella says. She pauses. “I gather dinner that time went well, then?”
Sherlock looks over and smiles. “I might, then. I’ll have a look, see what you’ve got.”
“What!” John is shocked. “Hard enough to leave scars years later?”
I almost feel a little choked up. “Yeah,” I get out. I have no control over what my face and forehead are doing right now.
. He fidgets and kills time until it’s midnight and definitely time to go to bed. He’s been procrastinating in the vain hope that Sherlock might come home before this point, but he hasn’t. And now that it’s come to it, he doesn’t know what he’s supposed to do now. If Sherlock is upset with him for what happened last night, or just needs space from him, then how strange would it be for him if he came home and found John there in his bed? Granted, John’s been sleeping there for three and a half weeks now, but to assume his welcome there in Sherlock’s absence, especially after this day of non-communication, seems a bit much. John looks down the corridor to Sherlock’s bedroom, to the place he never thought to ever be granted access to in the first place and never wanted to lose, and feels it slip away like a mirage. No. It’s patently clear: he cannot sleep in Sherlock’s bed without Sherlock, with everything so unknown and unresolved between them.
Sherlock considers this. “Let’s watch the news. Agreed: in about twenty minutes, I think it will hit and I’ll want to sleep.”
from?”
When he gets back to the flat, it’s half past ten and John is already there. He comes to the top of the stairs as Sherlock starts up them. “Hey,” he says, looking down at Sherlock. “Where’ve you been?”
John shakes his head into the sofa. “I don’t deserve you. I don’t deserve your forgiveness, and I’ll never forgive myself.”
“John,” Ella supplies, and he doesn’t deny this. “Mary, too?” she asks.
Sherlock’s only response is to continue crying, his back shuddering, utterly out of control
John nods. His throat is too tight to speak, but he manages to meet Sarah’s eyes first, then Kyle’s.
“Listen,” John says, very firmly, taking both of Sherlock’s hands. “I don’t want to go back to the way things have been, you at Baker Street and me out at the flat, living separate lives. From here on in, I only want there to be one ‘life’: the one you and I share. I’m in this all the way now, and I want to be wherever you are. I want to come home, if you don’t mind my extra baggage.”
Somehow she pushes herself off the fence and makes for the house, walking at first, then breaking into a run.
Sherlock nods. “I know,” he says. “I – I’m trying to.” He turns and closes the flat door behind himself, then takes off his coat and hangs it up, steps out of his shoes. John watches him numbly, and has the wit to realises that Sherlock is stalling for time, trying to find the right words. He turns back to face John, and his face is set. “Look,” he says, very intensely. “It’s been you all along. It always has been. Since long before I went away. From the very start. It took me a long time to see it for what it was, but – when I came back, Mary was there, and I thought that was what you wanted, so I never said anything. Never would have. When it all ended and you came back, I was only grateful that you’d come home. I didn’t want to destabilise it, jeopardise everything with a poorly-thought out request to have even more from you. So when this came along… I never would have gone for it. It was flattering, obviously, but I wouldn’t have even answered that first text of his. But you kept asking about it, and when you encouraged me to try it, I really thought that you must not have any feelings of – of that nature for me. And when I presented you with my practical issue, of not wanting to look like an inexperienced fool in front of someone like him and you agreed to walk me through it, that seemed very much like a confirmation of the fact.”
“Which is fine, by the way. Quiet is fine, if that’s what you need. But I just want to make sure you’re okay.”
He held up both things. John noticed that a flannel was dangling from the pocket of his dressing gown.
“He may suspect we are here. I would not take a confessed traitor at his word, if our positions were reversed, and it must be assumed that he has a working knowledge of suitable hiding-places in London for the criminal classes.” He must have caught the look of extreme horror on my face, for he left off emptying his pockets and approached the chair where I sat. “Yes, it may have been unwise in the extreme to leave him a letter in my own hand. I wished to obtain the measure of the man, but in doing so I have given him ample opportunity to learn mine. But I don’t think he will pursue us. Not yet.”
“I’ll be happy that you’re happy. It’s going to be a bit like having them over for dinner, isn’t it?”
“Never mind, I’m moving on.
No, I do not dream of glory. That was a younger man’s fancy, and I left it behind me in the hills and mountains of Afghanistan. But I know my companion has taken an interest in bees: he studies them in his spare time, and I suspect that he does not realize how often he speaks of their cultivation. And I have always been fond of the South Downs.

acquiring a meaningful police record, he counted to ten, then to a higher number, then to a number a little higher than that, and said, “Do you ever listen to yourself talk? Because I’m hearing ‘punch me in the face’ in the subtext.”
“I’ll get that chicken from Mrs. Hudson.”
“Hey, John. Nah, that’s all right. Just warn him to expect the CPS to be in touch. They need to clarify a thing or two from his statement about the Amberley case.”
John closed the distance between them and - God, he didn’t know where to start. He wanted to touch Sherlock everywhere, taste him everywhere, and there was so much of him to take in. His lips were at the back of Sherlock’s neck, his hands were smoothing up and down Sherlock’s arms, he was plastered against Sherlock’s back, and it wasn’t enough, of course it wasn’t enough, not when his achingly hard cock was pressing into Sherlock’s perfect left arse cheek.

Yes, I know it sounds paranoid, but I refuse to be the damn butterfly that flaps its wings and brings about the Apocalypse. I’ve learned to be careful.
“As I recall, you liked the dog.”
“Not that I care, but do you know what the clue means?”
“—not the way you send messages.”
Sherlock’s lips stopped abruptly halfway through what would have been a satisfied smirk and his eyes narrowed.
It shouldn't have bothered him that Sarah knew about his little crush. He wasn't exactly discreet - Hell, he
“Yes,” said the blackbird, and he left it at that. He flew away, keeping low betwixt the branches and the fox did not see him again until the next day.
Sherlock had to concede he had a point, especially in the light of his own habits, but it still didn’t fit. “Then how did he light his way? The sun’s just come up and it was a new moon last night. There’s no lamp, no candle, no burnt matches, and I doubt he has a tinder-box. He had no magic to speak of, so mage-light is out of the question. One might argue that he knew his way”—as Sherlock did himself—“but, as you pointed out, he

doing this. He certainly wasn’t shy about egging John on, gasping for more like his life depended on it, and, now that they were on the same page, John was more than happy to comply.
, so you might have been to more than one library. A scholar, maybe?”
I would have gone with him, but he would not hear of it. There was no need, said he, for both of us to dangle as bait. Then he smiled, telling me it would be but the work of a moment, and I was not to worry myself over so small a thing. Had I not better conserve my energies for later?

was devastating. It battered down John’s already feeble defenses far more effectively than any smooth come-hither could have done at that point. It reminded John that he had a say in this, that Sherlock was acknowledging he had a say in this despite the veneer of arrogant pushiness, and, upon further (
"Bloody gorgeous prima donna, you mean," said Molly, with a giggle.
“‘Oh Jesus’ is right. We need all the divine intervention we can get.”
His words perturbed me. I had sensed from him an unusual keenness and intensity in this business with the consulting detective. It was not the air of a predator stalking his prey that I have so often witnessed, but rather that of a tiger who has come upon a rival beast in his jungle: neither will rest until one of them has killed the other.
“A bit.”
“Well, yes. Just. You don’t have to put on a show for me. You’re breathtaking just as you are.” That was rather more than John meant to say. Sherlock preened a little at that. It was a shame that the next thing out of John’s mouth was, “And I’m still not sure this is a good idea.”
“I’m not going to ask –
Sherlock sputtered and stammered, but never got around to actually protesting, while Irene stood in one liquid movement and closed the distance between them.

“Probably.”
The first time I used it since being invalided home was for you. I’m sure you can tell, if you put your mind to it: a little extra time to aim made all the difference with Jeff Hope. You know that wasn’t an easy shot. And I tried like mad after you jumped. None of that worked at all, but you used some trickery of your own there, didn’t you? You can tell me later.
“Mmm, yes,” said Irene, twining an arm around Molly’s waist. “You want him to play, don’t you, sweetheart?”
The other actress rolled her eyes. "Fine, love. Sarah," she said, turning to the director, "we can start without him, can't we?"
good.”
“I don’t mind,” said the fox. Truth to tell, he did mind a little today, but that was mostly because he was hungry and the blackbird was fluttering and bobbing right in front of his nose. Form defines function, but denying the foxy instincts felt familiar. He was almost certain he’d had practice controlling his...his transport.
John shook his head, concentrating on
he hoped didn’t know - or was at least willing to feign ignorance - was mortifying.
“Of course. I want to make sure you’re all right, don’t I?” He flashed the fox a look that would have been a grin on another face. “I got you talking. Call me invested.”
Mercifully, there wasn’t much left to the film after that: just some more sticky kissing, some licking of residual drops of semen off of lips and necks and Sherlock’s cock, and a humorous bit where they all realized that the sink still wasn’t fixed. Sarah called it a wrap at that point and pronounced herself satisfied with the footage, everybody put their clothes back on, and John could breathe easy again, especially when the actors went off to shower. Or at least Molly and Irene did, with Irene going downstairs to use Mrs. Hudson’s bathroom (and purloin a couple of biscuits too, probably). Sherlock, having professed a disinterest in hot water, drifted back to the kitchen where he could be heard texting furiously.
Our goal can be achieved. This proves it. The Old Ones are not so invulnerable as they would have us believe, nor is humanity so weak. The Restoration is possible, and I am willing to wade in oceans of ichor to make it so.
"If you'd taken any longer," Irene said, crossing her long legs and leveling a pointed look at him, "we'd have had to use John."
(See the end of the chapter for
He had left his phone and half-consumed water bottle on the kitchen counter, and he’d amped up his animal magnetism to a solid eleven. Possibly gusting to a twelve.
Sherlock's eyes - impossible eyes, John could never decide what color they were - went to the cameraman then, and the corner of his mouth quirked upwards in a half smile. "That wouldn't have been too bad."
“Oh,” she gasped, all but yanking on his curls. “Oh, fuck, yes! I’m - I’m going to -”
“It has bought us some time,” he said at last. “The London constabulary now thinks that we have fled Albion, and they will not look for us in the heart of the city.”
John ignored that. Sherlock was one to talk about behavior in court, and he’d already promised Lestrade to keep from glowering if he could help it. “St. Clair tried to hurt you, love. I couldn’t have that - just imagine what this shiner would have looked like on your pretty face. I was morally obligated to keep that from happening.”
While Sarah briefed the women and made sure they knew where the caches of lube and condoms and sex toys were placed, John noticed that her eyes were constantly going to her wristwatch, and he couldn't help checking the time every few seconds as well: Sherlock Holmes was running late.
was simply unbearable. John concentrated on the perfectly brewed tea and let out a steadying breath.
. That’s the fifth letter. And I’ll get the first letter for that if I get the last letter of this next one.”
“That would have been a sight,” said Sarah, somewhat wistfully, all but yanking the jacket from his shoulders.
That, however, was not his problem at the moment. If he had to, he’d stay behind to rectify things with a canister of air freshener, but he currently had to contend with was kneeling to get a good shot of Molly and Irene licking up either side of Sherlock’s cock without getting in the way. Then that turned into Irene taking Sherlock’s balls in her mouth while Molly continued to suckle his glans, with Sherlock breathing harshly and keeping up a steady mantra of

He couldn’t think of the last time being wrong had been such a relief.
long way off, I hope, since I am to resurrect Altamont to replace Vernet.”
Oh God. That cock.
“Happy to help.” The blackbird rearranged a few feathers in his wing in the manner of someone who found it awkward to be thanked. “There’s more though. I eavesdropped. Turns out you can do that pretty shamelessly if you sit on a tree branch and try to blend into the scenery. One of them said you raided a hen house, that you killed all the chickens and smashed the eggs in the bargain.”
The fox blinked. He wasn’t hungry now, and, even if he had been, he didn’t think he would have felt inclined to eat this particular bird. It sounded like something—someone—he should know, right along with tea and...tea and
“It looks fine, Sarah,” she said, arranging things in her commodious handbag. It looked like she had a place for everything in there, even a neat plastic bag for her damp towel. “You should have seen my flat when I had my first look at it.”
Molly nodded. She was a cute little thing, given to floral prints and sensible shoes, and if John had met her anywhere else, he wouldn't for a second have believed that she worked in porn. "Two flatmates, one plumber, lots and lots of sex," she said. She was also the sort of girl who was given to religiously reading scripts and manuals beforehand. "And a random male friend behind the camera who doesn't get involved."
“But what? I understand a certain reluctance to indulge one’s fantasies in real life - dreams so often become disappointing once you can touch them. Is that it? Are you afraid I might not be as good as you imagined?” Sherlock was well and truly invading John’s space now, and his next words ghosted warmly over John’s ear. “I assure you, I am
John didn’t need any prompting this time. This, if he could say so himself, was what he was good at. He started by taking in the entire scene: Irene had quite expertly positioned herself between
“Indeed. He will need to exert his little grey cells to the utmost with Moriarty on the Restorationists’ case, and his insight into the Russian situation will be most useful to us, if we are to pursue Black Peter as planned. He may also be able to harbor us for a time, while I cultivate my goatee.”
want?” panted John, half-mad with desire, clutching at the man’s shoulders. “Tell me, Sherlock—God, I’ll do anything.”
"I'll do it a bit messy, okay?" murmured Irene, obediently turning to face the sitting room mirror, hands already twining in her dark hair.
tearing his eyes away from the scene in front of him.
“You have the same taste in music, at any rate. That’s nice.”
hurry!”
“I could hear you thinking. Stop it. The color of your pants is immaterial.” And Sherlock demonstrated exactly how irrelevant they were to the proceedings by tugging them unceremoniously downward to the level of John’s knees.
"Yes, I fingered myself in the shower," said Sherlock breathily, reminding John of the eyes he likely had at the back of his head. "Today's session was singularly tedious – I won't deny that your presence on set was welcome, but it was also
The blackbird became a regular fixture in the fox’s days after that. As it turned out, he had very strong opinions about tea and was flexible on the subject of gingery biscuits. It...helped. The un-foxness didn’t go away, but it became easier to bear, less like it was something he had to shake off.
I remember the screams. I remember one officer who had, against all odds, survived the long dark, though he remained insensate for far longer than I, deathly silent but for the occasional cry in the night. I wonder what became of him.
"And you follow brilliantly." Sarah beamed at him. "Just ad lib into your mike when I give you a nudge."
in any way you want to give it to me. But I don’t think oral sex is what floats your boat at the moment. Am I wrong?”
“It’s going to drive me mad. Mad!”
“I could have. But if you give a man a loaf, you only feed him for a day. Teach a man to bake...”
“Nor is it a morning to be good on, apparently.”
No, that was the horny teenager talking. He had to do his job
I could not tell why I wrote this account at all, save, perhaps, to put my thoughts on this affair in some semblance of order. If it is found on me, it will spell our deaths, and there is nowhere for me to hide it without chancing discovery.
“The vulgar personality he makes you adopt,” I answered without hesitation.
Or Sherlock might have simply been urging him to
“I - I -”

"Well, just like it said in the script - you've read it, right?"
“More awkward than they are already?” Sherlock pushed himself out of the chair and began to stalk towards John, holding up the obviously loosened towel with one fist. “Did you know there’s an office betting pool? They’re taking odds on when you’ll finally crack and give me a good groping on set. Or ask me out for a drink.” Sherlock looked thoughtful. “I’ll have to tell Mike he won that one just now, on a technicality. I believe he has twenty quid riding on that.”
“Not good?”
John harrumphed at being manhandled into comfort, but the black mood was becoming ever so slightly less comfortable to carry. He took a sip of the tea, which was just the right temperature. Sherlock had timed the making of it perfectly.
Not that the singular noun was much comfort when said attractive naked man was having an orgasm, however staged.
“Oi,” she hissed. “You zoned out on me there. Pay attention.”
“Sorry,” he said as the fox emerged, tail twitching with curiosity. He was resting on the ground just in front of the hole, quite thoroughly worn out. “I can’t go in there. It’s being a damned bird that does it. But they’ve gone to a different part of the woods now. You can probably rest easy, though I’d stay put if I were you.”
It could have been for support. Maybe. Sherlock
Sherlock thought they were doing quite well until the two of them found themselves standing next to a dead body.
Until his (stupid, stupid,

And he knew what tea

“I thought you
His mood had not improved by the time he got to Baker Street, though he did try to ease his features into a less baleful arrangement when Sherlock met him at the door to the flat. He didn’t know why he bothered: Sherlock, of course, could read him at a glance, taking in John-as-he-was, from his slippery shoes to his bare head, with one quirk of an eyebrow.
“Mmm.”
That’s true of anything we do, isn’t it, though possibly more so with time travel. So I could decide not to take the Tesco lettuce, but that would leave it for someone’s single mum to pick it up, and if she gets held up at checkout, it makes her late picking up her kids, and her bastard of an ex-husband uses that as one more reason why she shouldn’t have custody, and it’s all my fault because I couldn’t handle a minor inconvenience.
“I can start more than that.”
“Fine. I am fine. Completely fine,” said John, though he suspected the repetition wasn’t helping his case. “Fine.”
!” She all but grabbed the toy from Irene. “I know he takes it beautifully, but that just won’t work for our target audience. Not for this series, anyway. Let’s save that for next time - or at least for Molly. John, are you okay?”
“Um,” said John.
“What?”
“John,” she hissed, though he’d never know how she managed to hiss a name without sibilants, “what the hell is going on?”
John held up his kit in reply. He hadn’t wanted his camera and its accoutrements to get caught in the frenzied throwing of things into bins and had saved it for last.
"Yeah, it's all fine," lied John, at Sarah's prompting. "Don't mind me."
John, of course, had to shoot this from as close as possible without actually resting the camera on Sherlock’s taut stomach. That was normal - terrible, given the state John was in, but perfectly normal given his job description. What was
“You’re lucky.” John laid a hand—gently, gently—on Sherlock’s leg and leaned against him. “I should play it for you some time. Mind you, we’d probably have to be properly sloshed to stand it, but that’d be in keeping with the spirit of the thing.”
It is the immensity, I believe. The impossibility of our task. The awful hugeness of those above.
John tried not to look. He really did. Honestly. But somewhere along the way between making the decision not to look and acting upon it, Sherlock Holmes removed his shirt and something in John’s brain fizzled and died, and all he could do was watch.
Sarah snorted. “Well, as long as you can repress it until the end of filming...”
Which was, oh God, so hard, so
Irene laughed and patted his ribs in a vaguely soothing gesture. “Darling, he did say ‘please’.”
“That’s the idea,” said Irene. She slid onto the table behind Molly, kissed the back of her neck, then leaned over her shoulder to kiss Sherlock too, holding on to his upper arm for balance and rubbing her thumb in slow arcs over his well-formed bicep. (John filled his head with the fact that Mrs. Hudson had incredibly sturdy furniture, and did not think about those arms at all. Or how they might feel under his own hands.) “You’ll try to keep up, won’t you?”
John started. The black mood, still sitting with him, reared up and bit, and it would have been so easy to snap at Sherlock, tell him to get out of his head, damn it, stop trying to be so bloody clever. And he’d apologize for it afterwards, of course he would, because he wouldn’t mean it, he never would, it wasn’t Sherlock’s fault at all that the world was wrapped around John like a heavy, prickly duvet from a seedy hotel that was barely keeping its operating license, and the very last thing he wanted was to hurt Sherlock so carelessly.
“There really isn’t much room on your chair, John.”
“Is it working?”
John craned his neck to look at him. “I wasn’t poking at it. I was...examining it.”
"Actually, you do tell me what to do. A lot," John pointed out.
“Oh, stop it, Sherlock.”
“What are you talking about?”
.” His voice dropped another octave and hit a note that sent a jolt of arousal running up and down John’s spine. “You two - you’ve got to let me fuck you. I need to fuck you.”
“He has little to do with it. Now, you - oh, I have high hopes.” Sherlock let go of the towel, allowing it to travel a fraction of an inch southward, and laid his fingertips meaningfully on John’s belt buckle. “May I?”
“What? Sherlock, you are
No one has come seeking us yet, and we may be able to safely remain here till morning.
“Maybe,” agreed the fox dully. It sounded nearly right, but still missed the mark, and he felt that he should be better at this sort of thing. “Do you know who you were?”
Not literally, more’s the pity, but if that wasn’t what he was up to, John would take his camera apart and eat it. His own fault, perhaps for being so easy to tease, but this was grossly unfair. He’d put up with it from Sarah because she was a friend, and he’d share the occasional pained glance with Molly because that was what you did when co-workers stressed you out. But he was not going to stand being made the butt - aha - of this particularly cruel joke. No, he was going to put on his professional face and keep it there. And he’d do it successfully this time, because few things are better motivators than spite.
“Shush. Not now, and there are no cases in which you won’t be able to say it later,” Sherlock says, but his teeth are nearly chattering in fear, his heart in his throat. The scarf is soaked through. He tosses it away and carefully, carefully eases John out of his coat and shirt. To his vast relief, the actual wound is smaller than he expected, having only just grazed John’s side. It’s large enough, though, the edges of the skin in bloodied ribbons. He presses the flannel to it, trying to hide his fear. “I think I’ve got to give you a local anaesthetic and stitch this,” he says, feeling John’s pulse beating through the flannel to the curve of his palm.
