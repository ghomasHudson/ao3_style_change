“The spell Nick used, to get Lucifer back. It’s the same one.”
Sam’s breathing changes slightly, there’s a hitch in his breath and his hands start tapping lightly on the table.
“I’m sorry,” Castiel tries, but it sounds pathetic.
“Dean…”
Dean can’t look at the body, at the innocent person he knows they should have tried to save. The demon had been toying with the pastor, hopping in and out of the vessel at their leisure. It was firmly in their grasp to return him to his life but… Dean has tunnel-vision. He only sees darkness. He only sees Castiel.
But he’s won.
He doesn’t want to talk about it.
“I don’t understand.”
As sparks fly into the room from the fireplace, Dean reaches to brush his thumb across Castiel’s cheek, followed by another swipe from the corner of his mouth, and a gentle caress on his face as affirmation that he’s
And he really
“Sure,” Dean smiles. “No, yes. I don’t know. I wanted to just hang out, talk to you, let off some steam, go for a drive, grab some burgers… you know?”
Sam has prepared the ingredients and has the spell written down, Eileen, Jody and Claire are ready to fight whatever they need to, Donna too. Alex is hanging back with Miracle, by the map table, just in case.
“Relax,” Dean says calmly, with a mischievous smirk, as he sits up. “Eileen mentioned cataloguing and I can think of a thousand different things we should be doing instead.”
"Hey," Sam calls over as he strolls in, yawning, and Castiel courteously takes a step back. "Jody just called. She's got a werewolf pack that's bigger than she thought and needs a hand. You guys want in? We can leave in the morning."
, I wanted to feel as close to
“I heard your prayers, and I’ve been watching over you,” he says, so earnestly, so unintentionally. Dean feels it deep inside, wonders if Jack knows just how alike Castiel he really is. If he so much as tilts his head, Dean’s going to be a wreck.
There is a pause while Dean chokes down his breakfast and chases it with a beer that he barely remembers bringing to the table and he stares at the scratches and knocks that have marred the wood beneath his hands. He runs his fingertips over them, to just feel something. To feel anything. The wood catches against his skin and he breathes.
“Bobby needs to keep his mouth shut,” Castiel mumbles, with a gentle roll of his eyes. Dean laughs, suddenly, and Castiel feels it like an electric shock as it sparks in his middle. The last shred of grace clinging on jolts in his throat as he looks at Dean, who is looking at him, sincerity and peace and comfort dripping off of him.
They’ve already won their battle.
“I guess angel mojo ain’t all it’s cracked up to be after all,” Dean tries to joke but it falls flat. Castiel just looks at him.
“Yeah, and you’re right for that too,” Dean grins, tugging Castiel into a kiss a little more bruising this time. They kick the sheets back up and it takes another few sunsets before they contemplate moving again.
It takes another half an hour of vaguely listening to the details of what appears to be a vengeful spirit before Dean stands, pulls his keys out of his pocket and declares they’re taking the Impala.
Dean throws his hand out and places it on top of Castiel’s, still lying on the tabletop. The contact sends a thrill down his spine and nausea through his stomach. It’s an involuntary act, but the only one that makes sense so far.
“Jack,” he whispers from his recliner one day. “I don’t know if you can hear me, but just thought I’d say hi.”
, in every way.
“I have a house,” Castiel blurts out, throwing one last disgusted look at the motel before turning back to Dean. “For you. I have a house for you.”
Because he has to come back.
But the thing is: Dean does.
And then: foot hitting the brakes, clutch into the floor, gear shift, full lock steering, and finally… gas, gas, gas.
“Yes,” Castiel knows there is no point in lying but he can’t make eye contact. He can’t look at him. “I’m sorry.”
Still, nothing.
“Right now? I want to go to the beach,” he says, quietly. “I don’t want to only see the ugly parts of the world anymore.”
“And I am with you, Dean. I am. I want him home too. But-”
, if you know
Dean throws some holy water in the demon’s face, but they laugh through the burn.
Castiel stays silent, but Dean can tell he's no longer at peace with what he thought he knew. That once, Dean would have had to have explained the intricacies and complications of romantic love and relationships, but he can see now just how human Castiel has become. He can see how much he's allowed himself to feel, how much he has let in. Dean lets himself acknowledge for the first time that Castiel will understand him, will hear him. And that's terrifying but exhilarating.
Sometimes Dean thinks he is coping. Sometimes, he wonders what Chuck is up to. Is he writing his memoirs? Is he still crawling around by the lake where they left him? Has someone taken pity on him? Sometimes he fills out job applications and fully intends to return them, and sometimes he orders his third pizza of the week and thinks of the freedom he has earned. The freedom that was promised.
He hopes he tried to swim.
Because every enemy has a weakness.
Castiel's eyes widen ever so slightly, and his mouth parts a little with surprise, but not for long before an impish amusement finally takes over his face.
The breeze turns into wind and it picks up enough to hide the sun momentarily. He's in the middle of the road with a 1960's muscle car and the soul he traded his grace, humanity and life for. The sun moves to set as it peeks out from behind a cloud, and as Castiel is bathed in pink and orange light, he feels his grace waning again.
But it’s Dean’s jacket that is buried in the back of his wardrobe. The jacket that he bagged up into an old backpack and buried under mountains of other crap. The one he can’t bear to look at.
“Yeah,” Dean sighs, and refuses to look Sam in the eye. “Except we don’t use Jack’s blood. We use Cas’. He’ll either be able to walk through or one of us goes in, I don’t know. But this is the only shot we have.”
It takes another few hours for Dean to pick up the damn mixtape and find his way to Castiel’s door, mid-afternoon. He breathes, breathes again, rolls his eyes, and finally forces his hand to knock. “Cas? You awake?”
He takes a second to wonder if Castiel will look like that. What if he appears to him like this? Would it be okay? Would he have to find a new vessel? Would that change… anything?
As they pull up the driveway and move slowly towards the edge of the lake, Castiel sends a silent wish to Jack or Amara that they extend him one small kindness. That they gift him enough grace to lose the evidence.
“Okay?” Dean questions, suspiciously. But Sam just nods. Sam gives him a look that borders on pitying and Dean can’t look back anymore. He can’t stomach being seen so clearly.
“Okay,” Sam eventually says, and Dean almost spits out his beer. “We should call in all the help we can in case the worst happens but yeah, okay.”
Sam is in the library, scribbling quickly onto a scrap of paper with at least six books open in front of him and a plethora of plants and ingredients scattered around.
He’s sprawled somewhere in the middle of the devil’s trap, and Castiel is propped against one of the walls.
Castiel who broke free from God and Heaven, and who Dean followed into Nothing on a wing and a prayer just to bring him home.
“You’ve got to be more careful,” Dean pleads. “Maybe you should sit the next few out.”
“Yeah,” Dean agrees, still a little dazed. “I will.”
“SHUT UP!” The Shadow eventually yells and with a click of its fingers, Castiel appears before him the very image of the man haunting every minute of Dean’s existence. He’s lying on the ground and he’s awake and he’s squinting, and he’s never looked more confused.
Dean pauses. Takes a breath.
Castiel nods, understanding. And then, suddenly, and without permission:
Dean stays silent.
"I would have just pulled you out again. Your soul was never damned."
Dean Winchester, who has fought vampires and demons and God himself, can't find enough courage to tell the angel before him that he loves him, and he wants him to stay.
“Were you expecting someone else?” she tries for humour but as with most angels, it falls flat. “You said you needed to ask me something?”
more.
“Dammit, Cas,” he says, gritting his teeth, trying to pray. “Where the fuck are you? Why aren’t you here?”
“I am going to do this spell for you,” he says, stopping Dean from interrupting when he tries. “For Cas, too. You deserve someone that understands you too and god, Dean, it’s so typical of you that he’s stuck in some cosmic realm we stand barely a chance of getting into, but we’re going to try, okay?”
“Rowena’s” she says back, rolling her eyes. “Sam wants to catalogue everything properly.”
“Tell me how to get to the Empty!” Dean yells. He’s already asked five times and the demon hasn’t budged. The answers are all the same: Dean is only human. Dean can’t do anything. Dean is useless.
“If I calculated it right, you should end up where he is,” Sam explains. “We don’t know anything about this place. Cas never really spoke about it in detail but wherever he is in there, you should be.”
Dean waits until Jack leaves before he brings it up with Sam.
But as they make it through, Dean watches the black tendrils synonymous with the Empty and the Shadow knit themselves back together and vanish into thin air, as if it had never been there at all.
” and ended with-
“I’ll bring him back, Jack,” Dean pulls Jack into another hug. “I promise.”
Throughout the whole conversation, Jack gives him nothing, but he has the decency to frown at the mention of Mary. At least there’s something still earthly about him, Dean thinks. There’s still a scrap of the kid left.
Dean's breath hitches and Castiel feels the sway of the trees in the breeze. He feels the cooling air through his feathers and across his face and he stands, away from Dean’s hold. Away from the car. Away from the utter devastation that sits shattered in the very core of him.
He forces his hands either side of Castiel’s head to move his arms away, to get him to open his eyes. He holds his grip on the back of Castiel’s head and refuses to look away.
It has his face but it’s a face he hasn’t worn in many years. He sees the Mark of Cain on the Shadow’s arm and can almost feel the blood on his face as he stares right at it. Castiel’s blood, probably.
“The deal was that he had to allow himself to be truly happy or have a moment of true happiness or something, it’s kind of fuzzy,” a small lie that he allows himself out of courtesy for how this will plague his mind later in the day, through the night, how he won’t sleep or rest until it’s done its damage. He remembers everything with a striking clarity. He remembers the exact moment it started, and he remembers how it ended, and he remembers every word. The scene has taken up residence in his mind and it runs rampant like a plague, like a curse. It won’t leave him alone.
“Everything I know of you I know because of him,” the Shadow sneers, leaning over Dean alarmingly close. “All of his regrets, his pain. It’s all you.”
Dean laughs a little and shrugs. “Nothing much. Just little things, like when I think about how much he’d love Miracle or when I find a cool new TV show that I know he’d spend an entire weekend watching.”
“You’re right,” Jack nods. “I couldn’t do it. I tried but The Empty is beyond my reach.”
“Jack has given me a way into the Empty,” Dean says into his bottle of beer, sitting in the kitchen while Sam clears away the empty bottles. Sam turns around with a start.
The spell is broken. “A little too close if you ask me,” Dean grumbles, stepping out of the vacuum he’s found himself in. “Know any good bars around here?”
“I made some of it,” Castiel admits, cautiously. Dean’s eyebrow raises and Castiel’s soul, gently forming within, moves with it. His grace is moving fast and loose within this realm, leaking into every crack and crevice and it’s simply impossible to have manifested such a creation alone. But Dean doesn’t believe him. And Castiel
Later, Miracle will join them on the dock while they empty bottles of beer and watch the day turn to night turn to day then back to night in no time at all.
“Cas,” Sam says, carefree. Like it doesn’t mean anything. Like the mere
They haunt him.
. And he can’t stop talking. He modelled this Heaven in Dean’s image and yet it is a simple house that is making him crumble. He’s already told Dean he loves him, and he knows Dean understands this Heaven is for him… but the house. He might as well have sent a love letter, sealed with a kiss, sprayed with cologne, and all other references he barely understands from rom-com movie nights after rom-com movie nights (
And with a heavy sigh, the impossibility of something so simple makes itself known.
“Okay,” Dean finally says after what feels like an entire other lifetime. His eyes haven’t moved. “Take me home then.”
“Sounds kind of sappy if you ask me,” Dean manages a smile for Sam’s benefit. Oh, to have the luxury to dream.
“You and me,” Dean says against his mouth, quietly, like a prayer. “Tell me this is real.”
“I felt it,” Castiel says quietly, turning on his side to face Dean fully. “As soon as you died, I felt it so acutely, like my heart was going to jump right from my chest.”
And not for the first time:
“It was a fixer-upper, for sure. You couldn’t have stayed there without a little work doing to it, and I would have done it for you, but it was still a home. It could have been a home, anyway.”
“Good. Mary said as much.”
And shit, he’s so damn close.
Jack snaps his fingers, and the bunker is immaculate once again.
But. Sam is still in the room.
Sam shrugs his shoulders and thankfully, Jack laughs. It’s good that he laughs because Dean’s mind has come back to itself and he’s going a mile a minute wondering why Jack is here. Why is Jack, the new God, stood before them? Why has he finally answered their prayers after weeks of nothing? He can’t help it, he’s not ready to embrace a life where he doesn’t have to worry about cosmic consequences, but he holds his head high and prepares to hear whatever cosmic disaster awaits. Because this isn’t paradise. There’s no way it can be.
“Cas, please,” Dean pleads. “You have to come with me. I need you to come home.”
“Dean,” Castiel starts. But that’s as far as he gets because Dean holds his hand up and shakes his head.
“Oh,” Dean says, barely above a whisper. “That’s… yeah, that’s good.”
“And now I am, you created this?” Dean is nodding, he’s trying to understand, he’s trying to absorb everything, and Castiel knows him, and he loves him, and he sees the brave face he’s painting onto this. He’s watching Dean open the envelope of Castiel’s love letter and drown in it. He wants to fly away, so badly.
As he takes his seat, Dean holds onto his hand. His arm is stretched across the table, but it makes no sense to stop.
“Nope,” Dean lies but Naomi’s disappointing visit is playing like a movie before his eyes.
“We miss you, kid,” he musters a small smile. “I miss you.”
“Yeah,” he sighs in gentle acknowledgement.
Dean’s phone rings, Sam’s name flashing up on the screen. He grabs at it and throws it on the backseat without care.
“You never would have told me that-?”
“He was Jack before he was god,” Dean says, with an air of acceptance. “I figure he’s still in there somewhere. He helped us get Cas back.”
. He only remembers you like
The demon drags the ‘buddy’ out to an absurd length and its mocking, and it hurts.
"I love this," Dean says quietly, with a gentle squeeze on Castiel's hand. Castiel exhales, and grasps at their joined hands with his other. He turns as Dean leans in, whispers a quick "
“Are Rowena’s belongings cursed?” Castiel asks as soon as the door is closed and locked, and Dean has thrown himself back on the bed. “Sam and Eileen are out there!”
Or rather, it works, but it doesn’t work enough.
Dean knows there is something in the network growing and new, young, capable hunters springing up all over the country feeling like it’s less urgent for
“I missed you, man,” Dean admits, nodding his head and finally putting the keys down. “The past few months have been…”
“Thanks, Cas,” Dean murmurs, breathless, as he moves closer, urgently, grabs Castiel and presses his mouth insistently to his. Dean’s hands clamour for the trenchcoat’s lapels and use them to pull Castiel even closer. He feels Castiel try to gasp for breath before he pushes Dean back into the wall he was just pinned to by the vampire, kissing him back just as desperately.
The dots are connecting. The lines are being drawn. They all start with Castiel loving him and they all end with… something.
It’s a disaster.
The Shadow pretends to vomit at the thought and delights in the expression on Dean’s face, the one he’s losing control over. Where Castiel’s last words gave him strength, the Shadow is expertly trained to tear it right down.
And finally: “Why didn’t you ever say anything?”
“Just… stay.”
Dean wakes with a start as soon as he starts to sleep. A glance at the clock tells him it’s 2am and he knows he heard something. He heard something fall.
So what’s the point in all of this?
The trashcans are overflowing, and the scent of day-old cleaning products lingers in the air. The floodlight illuminating the parking lot flickers to life but as Castiel steps outside of the Impala to just breathe, Dean by his side, the light finally dies. He feels Heaven leave him and now he’s truly lost. His arrangement is complete.
He hears him, always.
“I’ll give you the spell if you promise me you’ll let yourself be at peace, Dean,” Jack sounds tired, like this has genuinely agonised him. “We all fought for this and I need you to not waste it.”
“Do you think he would have chosen that? If he knew?”
The engine growls.
There is no good reason why.
The lie stings to tell and he’s sure it hurts Sam to hear it. Because he was supposed to have learnt this lesson. It never did them any good, it never helped their cause. It was only a wedge that was getting harder to remove the more he did it. And yet admitting to Naomi’s visit? Admitting that he asked for help, that he sought out something he loathed and got nothing? It wasn’t worth acknowledging.
“I don’t know,” Castiel shrugs slightly. “But she wasn’t surprised.”
“That looking after a dog will be easy?” Castiel says slowly, trying to understand.
Dean feels sick, he feels cold, he feels itchy, he feels utterly undone. He’s being unmade in this hollow room in this empty bunker before his baby brother and there’s nothing he can do about it. Because Sammy knows what Dean has been refusing to acknowledge and he’s just said it, just laid it out on the table in huge letters for anyone that needs to see it, and god Dean needs to see it.
Every time Sam asks him for more, for a better explanation, he finds himself bracing for impact, but he doesn’t know why. This is Castiel’s secret. And yet his insides scramble and his feet are ready to run because the dots connect themselves and he knows it and Castiel probably knew it, so he can only assume Sam does too.
A breath. Butterflies flying madly in his stomach. And then he remembers that his kid is God now, so he probably already knows. And that’s what confession is, right? Admitting to the things that God already knows and sees so you can clear your record before it’s time to go upstairs?
Castiel says nothing, just spares a glance out of the window to the moon – low in the sky and shining across the water. He gently, finally, pulls the curtains closed because he doesn’t need an audience. He doesn’t need anything but a single minute, just a moment, to breathe. To let himself really feel what Dean is saying. To wish upon the grace he gave up that this is real and true.
There's an angel standing in the middle of the house that he built as a love letter, dressed in the most casual clothes Heaven could conjure. He’s surrounded by photos of his life, Dean’s life, and for the first time he’s not lost. He’s found. He knows what he has been looking for and he’s suddenly drowning in it.
“You sure? You’ve been a little out of it since you got back.”
Lips sliding over lips, warm breath on mouths and chins, foreheads resting gently on another, and his thumb brushing under his eye as he kisses him a little gentler than before, with a little less desperation, but he can feel the want building in his stomach, feel the need growing with every second.
“Do you love him?”
Dean is thrown further away. He objectively understands he’s on a floor, but he can’t see it. There is no difference to the floor, ceiling, walls, anything. It’s all just dark and cold and blank. It’s nothing.
“You sure it’s a demon?” There’s a hope barely beginning to bloom deep in Dean’s chest. When you kill a demon, there is only one place they end up.
“Hello,” is all he says, as he smiles and offers a tiny wave.
And Castiel is staring at him and he’s waiting.
“Dean,” Naomi softens slightly, but it’s barely noticeable. “The only way into the Empty is to die as an angel or a demon, and there’s no way out. Only one angel has ever managed it on his own.”
Up ahead are headlights and the rumble of an engine he knows too well. His wings ruffle slightly, though still unseen, and the aching in his back intensifies.
“I was... I didn’t know what to do when you were gone. I thought I’d never see you again but now you’re here, and you built me a perfect fucking house and
“Cas is my friend, he’s your best friend,” Sam explains, his tone more casual than his body is suggesting. “We’ve done worse for less.”
“You’re here.”
And he hopes he drowned.
Oh. And there it is. Castiel's eyes light up a little with more understanding.
“No,” Sam answers slowly. “She’s busy. I thought maybe both of you could come along?”
“Jack?” Sam questions cautiously.
Until they find a vamp nest in Maine.
“Your grace?”
And that… that’s fair. And Dean can’t argue. And he can’t swallow down the sudden hit of guilt, because he tries not to think about that time, tries not to dwell on being taken in by Gadreel, leaving Castiel out in the cold. Because he doesn’t know how Castiel can even stand to look at him, let alone look him in the eye and tell him he’s the most loving, caring, selfless person he’s ever known.
That Dean did apply for jobs and has attended a couple of interviews, that he does occasionally fix up the locals’ cars for cash-in-hand while Sam and Eileen chase packs of werewolves out of town three states away, while Castiel updates the bunker’s records on heaven and angels and fuck, the Empty. He archives Nick’s spell with Sam’s amendments, and leaves a vial of his own blood with it… just in case.
And finally, he understands.
“We’re wasting time here,” Dean flings open the driver side door and throws himself into his seat. His heart is hammering in his chest, his palms are starting to feel clammy, but his head feels like a whole load of cotton wool. He’s just fuzzy. Bile begins to rise from his stomach and god, why can’t Sam just
He leaves Sam behind, bewildered and confused in the kitchen, and doesn’t look back. This isn’t a conversation he’s having today. This isn’t a conversation he
Because it feels like a cruel trick. It feels like Jack getting his final laugh. And god, Dean deserves it. He feels the guilt every day and he wants to scream when he thinks of how close he was to losing Jack altogether out of his misguided, desperate rage.
“I’m asking Eileen to move in,” Sam says, and then hurriedly: “Properly. Not like whatever she’s been doing until now.”
Only now it doesn't hurt to acknowledge. Before, Dean heard Castiel. he heard him and then he watched him die, the forgone conclusion being that Dean destroyed him. But he sees now just how much he misunderstood.
“Dean,” he says quietly. “This is insane.”
“Well,” Dean uses his spare hand to drink a large mouthful of whiskey. Castiel is jovial, in a sense, but the thought unnerves him. For as much as he knows this is light-hearted, that Castiel has found his sense-of-humour over the years, the fact remains that if he had never spoken, he would never have been happy. It sits heavy in Dean’s heart, confusing the situation. He just doesn’t know what to do with that. Either way, the existence of this deal required Castiel to make a huge sacrifice, and both options were because of Dean. So, he can only offer him a small morsel, something that is absolutely diminished in the face of Castiel’s determination to do right by Dean but… he just can’t give any more without cracking himself open and bleeding onto the table before him. “It doesn’t make me uncomfortable.”
And why is Castiel the collateral damage
He did. And the case is solved, and everyone is saved, but there is a redness around Castiel’s neck that wasn’t there before, an irritation that he keeps rubbing, deeper breaths than usual and it’s impossible for Dean to think about anything else. He drives back to the bunker like a maniac, hoping no one notices the absurd number of times he checks the rear-view mirror. Just in case.
“Wasn’t really a choice. He was the last dog on Earth, found him after Chuck zapped everyone to nowhere, after-” Dean tries to explain but he still can’t say it. “When everyone came back, he sort of stayed with me.”
Because normal went out of the window when it started with “
“Not yet?” Dean is utterly bewildered. “So, you want to, in the future?”
He presses for more gas until it sounds like the clutch is going to give out, and harshly switches gear again.
“Is this going to work?”
The air changes as the sun begins to rise. Shadows from the tall sequoias draw lines in the road. Castiel walks right over them. Heaven can't have him now. He was only ever on loan.
“It’s so good to see you!” Sam exclaims, patting Jack on the back and pulling him into a quick one-armed hug. “So… how’s it going?”
“What?” he asks, as eloquently as he can manage, tipping his glass to Jack’s in an absurd celebration of the impossible.
“Oh yeah?” Dean tries to smile, tries to will away the embarrassment of being heard, of being seen. “See anything good?”
Dean is looking at this angel and his dog and they’ve both got his heart in a grip so tight it’s taken his breath away. He thinks of Jack, of his wish for Dean to feel at peace and live his life without pain, without chasing the impossible constantly. Without assuming his life began with a gun in his hand and will end with a blade through his chest. And fuck, this is it. He’s looking at this angel, and his dog, sitting in a recliner in Dean’s perfectly curated room watching shitty dog programmes and drinking crap beer. He allows himself just a moment to indulge, to think ahead, and he can feel that blade being removed from his chest. He can see his ending rewriting itself and… he kind of wants it. Really, really bad.
"You are still the one thing I want," Castiel confirms. "I think you always will be."
Dean looks around now, from where the Empty knocked his ass to the floor after his third attempt at walking through, and he sees the pity in Sam’s eyes, the unshed tears in Donna’s, the defeat in Claire’s. Jody is crouching next to him, hand on his shoulder, and telling him how sorry she is. That they can try again. That they all just need a break and then they can figure it out.
“Eventually,” Castiel smiles, finally, honestly. “Everyone you’ve loved and lost is here, no restrictions. Your dog will get here, Sam will be along one day, perhaps with Eileen and Jody and the girls. They’re all here and the rest will get here.”
Eileen moves in two weeks later. Two weeks after Dean stood in a pool of dead vampires and kissed Castiel for the first time. Two weeks after everything just snapped right into place and he stepped right on into the paradise Jack promised. And it’s a simple affair – Eileen is calm as she dumps her belongings on the map table and signs orders to Sam, but Sam is mostly flustered. He’s red, he’s anxious, but he has a smile that not even Eileen’s heaviest boxes can shift and for that, Dean wonders if there is a way of making her stay permanently, come what may.
“Jack restored my grace and my wings when he pulled me out of the Empty, gave me a promotion. Gave me everything I needed to make this Heaven perfect, to make it in whatever vision I saw fit, and then when the time comes… I become like you.”
Castiel's heart sings, and his soul vibrates, and when he closes his eyes for a second he knows that they are finally at peace.
“I’ve wanted nothing else for months,” Dean admits with a harsh exhale. “I just wanted to go back to before Chuck, before everything. Just you, me and Sam hunting. Just doing our jobs. It was the last thing I thought about before… well before the next thing I knew I was drinking beer with Bobby.”
at this point, but he hopes he's been clear enough.
“Yes,” Castiel nods.
“What about Jack?” Because somehow, Dean can’t just say what he really means. Even now, with his heart on the floor and any paradise locked far away where he can’t reach it, he can’t just say what he’s really thinking, what really matters. “You want to lock him out?”
The door isn’t locked so Dean pushes it open. Castiel knows the fire is burning before he even hears the crackling. He knows there are photos of the Winchesters all over the coffee table waiting to be framed. He knows there is beer in the fridge and a duvet on the bed, and he knows there are leaflets for take-out services in one of the kitchen drawers. He knows this. And he’s so ashamed.
So he presses on further, braces for impact, grits his teeth, and drives right on through him.
The Shadow throws its hands over its ears immediately and tries to duck away from the noise.
“Sam.”
And Dean couldn’t go in.
Dean cooks breakfast in the mornings, and Castiel runs his hand over Dean’s back as he walks past. Dean says goodnight to Castiel in the evenings, and Castiel holds his hand just a little as they part. Castiel’s hand rests atop Dean’s shoulder when he stands in the library discussing possible cases in the library, his foot grazes his under the table where Sam isn’t looking, hugging him close, hands in Dean’s hair and on the small of his back when he returns home safely. He’s always touching, touching, touching and it seems as though that’s enough.
They burn through two graves before they find the right one, but not before the spirit tries to possess Sam and strangles Castiel. Dean rushes into the room to find Castiel held up against the wall by a ghost he can barely see, slowly losing consciousness. Sam is on the floor, scrabbling around for a shotgun that Dean can’t find. They dropped the crowbars in the kitchen the first time the ghost tried to attack.
He doesn’t know why he still hasn’t.
After months of Eileen living in the bunker, Castiel moving into Dean’s room, and Sam building a new hunter network, Dean finds himself hunting less and less and no one says a damn word about it.
“Hey, we all want him back,” Sam tries to joke, but Dean catches his eyes filling slowly and smiles. “Just be careful, okay?”
“We have a dog now,” Dean grins, spinning Castiel in his arms and pressing a kiss to his cheek. “Come and meet him!”
’s and
He puts the beer down on the side table and looks at it almost longingly.
He still can’t see anyone. He only sees Castiel, arm resting out the open window, watching the sun set before them without a care in the world, his other hand in Miracle’s fur soothing him.
“Stop!” The Shadow tries for a booming voice this time, and just for good measure makes sure to swipe Dean off his feet again. The Shadow throws him higher this time, so he lands harder. The aches turn into breaks, but he’s somehow still got air in his lungs. And so, from the ground, he continues:
“Sure, yes, but what about with Lucifer? The Leviathan?”
"Yeah," Dean starts. He fidgets with the feel of Castiel's trenchcoat under his fingers. "I never expected to end up
Dean sighs. “I don’t know, man. You know him as well as I do.”
“He’s family, Sam.”
He knows Castiel likes to be told he’s part of Dean’s family, he’s not blind. But for the first time, it doesn’t ring as true as it used to. Dean recounts the times he has told people he cares for them, loves them, by way of telling them they’re family and it just doesn’t work for Castiel anymore. When he says it now to Castiel, it feels too small. He feels nervous all of a sudden, uncomfortable even.
He has to bring him back.
“Why didn’t you ask me?”
But whether Castiel is looking right at him or pointedly looking away, it remains a simple fact of the universe that he does love him, and he wants him, and he would do anything for him.
“Then let’s go,” Castiel says, nonplussed, inviting himself along without being asked. It feels like an improvement and Dean wants to savour it.
“Yeah,” Dean agrees. “We should probably talk about that.”
The air stills in the car. It’s thick and it’s hard to breathe, even though breathing shouldn’t matter.
“Yes, of course,” Castiel confirms, slowly, cautiously.
, but I can’t focus on
“Fine,” Dean huffs, giving the television his full attention. “Sorry for caring, I guess.”
“I froze today, seeing the way that spirit had you,” Dean admits, which is somehow easier than saying what he knows Castiel needs to hear, deserves to hear. He pulls his hand back slowly. “I couldn’t see anything but you dying, and I can’t do that again, Cas.”
And he thinks that maybe Castiel understands what a revelation this
But then he hears a calm, low and tempered instruction from his side: “Stay still, Dean.”
Castiel just smiles. “Dean, you are aware that I made a deal with the Empty.”
But he remains on the floor, pulling Castiel towards him, running a hand over his face, and hoping beyond anything that tiny shred of grace has saved him.
know. He can’t
Castiel is gazing at him fondly, sliding into Dean’s space and resting an arm around his shoulders, fingers tangling in Dean’s hair, gently soothing, calming, as they watch over the move. On instinct, Dean wraps his arm around Castiel’s waist and pulls him closer still.
“No,” Sam laughs. “You guys have a ‘more profound bond’, remember? I don’t know if Cas knew what he was talking about then, but he wasn’t wrong.”
Dean can only look at him. Suddenly there’s nothing to worry about. The news of Castiel’s grace restoring assuages his guilt and as it leaves him, Dean can’t take his eyes off of him. Castiel has bruises that he hasn’t quite healed yet and he looks an absolute mess, but Dean can see the spark in his eyes, can see the tiniest speck of angel that has come back to life and he can’t. stop. staring. He wonders, briefly, if this continues for even another minute, just how long he can keep it up without kissing Castiel. But:
But as he folds himself into the Impala, finds Castiel in the passenger seat and Sam already asleep in the back, he finds that he really doesn’t care.
“I need to talk with Dean,” Jack smiles, manages to throw Sam an apologetic glance, but fixes his gaze on Dean. And it’s unsettling. Dean helped raise him, he was there for his first few months when his own mother and chosen father couldn’t be. But the intensity with which he looks at Dean now? It’s bigger than Chuck. It’s bigger even than Amara. Dean wonders if he should be falling to his knees and praying right now.
, he thinks.
He thinks of his dad for a second, what he would have made of it.
“Dean?”
, as he puts his glass down on the table and makes to stand. “Good-” he starts, trying to say goodnight, goodbye…
"How do you know that you can't have what you want?"
But Castiel didn’t walk through.
tears into Dean’s chest and forces his hand to drive the demon blade clean into the abomination sat before him.
“What are you talking about?” Dean is losing his patience and he can feel the anger building in his chest. He doesn’t want to blow up at Sam today. He doesn’t really want to ever do it but, god, not today. Not when they have a glimmer of something like hope ahead of them. “I think I remember burning his body, having a fucking funeral, Sam. I was there.”
Dean feels the moment like a hand gripped tight on his heart, squeezing him to death. He tries to breathe but all he can see is Castiel’s eyes closing, slowly. All he can do is watch as Castiel extends an arm, just slightly, in his direction. His hand is stretched, like he wants someone to hold it. But Dean can’t do that. He can barely move. He just got him back and now…
“A soul. A human soul.”
“Alright,” Dean sighs, content and enthusiastic, after several moments. “Let’s go find a bar that gives you little umbrellas in your drinks.”
“Wait… Mary? You’ve seen my mom?” His voice is softer now and Castiel wonders if the thrill he feels from his middle, if the slight edge on his nerves will ever stop when Dean speaks to him like this.
Dean just blinks at him, completely blank.
“It’s okay, man,” Dean stands and makes for the door, but not before dropping the mixtape onto the side, next to the stereo. “I borrowed that while you were gone, thought you might want it back.”
“What are you watching?” Dean asks, throwing himself down into the other recliner and offering Castiel one of the beers in his hands. Castiel takes it awkwardly, trying not to disturb Miracle who Dean can now see is fast asleep.
“No,” Sam says, deadly serious. “Cas
But Dean is fast after him.
“Oh boy,” Donna laughs, mostly with relief. Dean can see the strain in her eyes, the fear. “That was a close one! Good to have you back, Castiel.”
The thrill of Castiel flirting is still novel and Dean delights in it. He lifts himself from the bed with ease, practically floats to Castiel before pushing him against the door and pressing the gentlest of kisses to his lips, hands resting on Castiel’s waist, pushing his shirt up ever so slightly in their race to touch his skin. “That’s the first.”
"I'm very familiar with unrequited love, Dean," he smiles but he’s not amused. "Humans have been telling tales, singing songs, and making movies about it for centuries. I know I'm not your type."
But the Shadow merely smirks at him. Just stares at him, dreaming up its next manipulation.
“A documentary,” Castiel explains after taking a sip of the beer. He screws his face up a little as he swallows. “Well, that doesn’t taste the same.”
And Dean doesn’t know why he didn’t just kiss him that night.
draped over the back of the chair in the corner. Castiel is painted all over the room, there is no mistaking it. He’s been playing house in his fantasy of the life Dean deserved and it’s
“Not quite,” Castiel smiles, wryly, but he’s mostly nervous. “I might not have had much leverage, but I did manage to get one thing for myself. My negotiating skills haven’t completely dried up.”
Dean acknowledges in his mind how this looks, how it makes him feel. That nothing much had to change to step into this new, romantic territory tells him that he’s been with Castiel for years. That Sam hasn’t commented or noted any difference in them tells him it’s definitely been obvious for years.
, he told John once upon a time. At the time he was proud but now it just feels like a lie. He
It always starts the same – hi, how are you, I miss you, thank you – and it always ends the same – he’s lost, he won’t forgive himself, he needs this, please help us.
But Sam still wants to go chasing monsters, clinging to some idea that this will bring Dean back to life, will drag him away from the books, that this will take away the memory of being healed, grace running through and over his injuries, of seeing a trenchcoat in his peripheral, the sound of wings from many moons ago. But Dean is still only interested in chasing one monster. He just doesn’t know if it’s him or if it’s Nothing.
“I know this isn’t easy,” Sam tries again, impossibly even more gentle than before. “But I don’t understand what happened and I feel like I can’t just move on or grieve. I don’t understand why there wasn’t another way.”
it anymore.
And he just drops it into the air, just says it and lets it hang there. And it’s Dean’s job to catch it, cradle it and send it back with something just as profound, as… romantic. But he’s fumbling because his mouth has gone dry and there’s a slight tremor in his hands and he’s pretty sure his beer is flat and man, has this chair always been so uncomfortable?
It’s when Dean glances into the master bedroom, clears his throat and throws a look back to Castiel standing on the landing, that he really feels it.
“Okay,” Dean says, pulling away. “Let’s go get this son of a bitch.”
being held before him half like a promise and half like a threat.
Sam sighs and twists in his seat to lean against the wall and fix Dean with a look. Dean feels the chill on the back of his neck but pretends it’s not happening.
Until Dean checks the nightstand.
Two weeks ago, Dean walked away from Chuck and started his life. His
Startled, somewhat, Castiel prickles. Because he’s already said what he had to say. And Dean still hasn’t said
“Cas,” Dean says. “Come on, wake up!”
“Dean-” Sam rolls his eyes.
Castiel smiles and hauls them both to their feet. He does it with ease, barely straining, despite sustaining injuries.
“Dean,” Naomi’s business-as-usual voice answers quietly. “This
“Jack’s compromise with Amara was that he could recreate Heaven if he didn’t have to stay here, if he could manage all the worlds Chuck created and keep them balanced, in harmony. With a singular focus on Heaven, he just couldn’t do that. So, Amara agreed when Jack asked to bring me here, but it was on the proviso that I rebuild Heaven, maintain it, manage it. I couldn’t just leave. That wasn’t the agreement.”
That’s when Dean finally whispers, breathless but satisfied: “This is the second thing. 998 to go.”
Dean can’t help himself. “You’re lying. Where. Is. He?”
“To break into a cosmic space that we have no access to or any knowledge about?”
“Sammy,” Dean turns to him, one last time before walking into the unknown. “Thank you.”
Dean floors the gas pedal and tears from the bunker faster and angrier than he needs to. He doesn’t stop until he can’t see the bunker in the rearview mirror anymore, like all his feelings and thoughts are held up in their little fortress. If he just drives fast enough and far enough, maybe they’ll go away, just vanish in the distance as the bunker slides from view.
When he returns to the room with a beer and his laptop, he stops dead in his tracks.
Castiel’s prayer is answered by thunder and a freak downpour he hadn’t seen in Heaven before. Dean runs for shelter, but Castiel stands a minute in the mud. He feels his feet start to sink a little as raindrops fall into his eyes, matting his hair to his forehead. But it’s only when Dean turns back from the comfort of the porch, with a curious glance, that he can force his legs to move.
And Dean just laughs.
They’re silent for a moment. Dean can see a thousand more questions written all over Claire’s face, but he knows he has no answers. None that he’s ready to talk about, anyway. And she knows it too.
“He can’t hear you,” the demon hisses. “He’ll never hear you again.”
for him. He longs for it to be like it was on Earth. He longs for Dean to not be here at all.
That they can remove the shame that floods him when Dean parks the car, steps outside and admires the exterior of an obviously lived-in house.
And when Sam scarpers to his room as soon as they get back to the bunker, Dean lets himself smile, easy and peaceful, free, sparing a glance to the clouds before he drags Castiel by the lapels into his bedroom.
Dean finally notices the ‘documentary’ is some sort of dog whisperer show and takes in Castiel’s hand in Miracle’s fur, gently fussing. And Castiel notices him.
The Shadow.
“Send me a postcard when you get there,” Sam sighs.
Dean collapses back on his bed, hands under his head, smirk permanently painted onto his face. “Really? Mr ‘Dean-is-the-best-person-in-the-whole-world-and-I-want-him-so-badly’ thinks he’s funny now?”
“You think you can take him away from here?” the Shadow laughs. “You think he’ll walk away willingly, with you? He chose this, Dean.
a surprise.”
Castiel’s eyes, bluer than Dean could have ever remembered on his own, fixate on Dean’s face. It feels like an age before he shows even a hint of relaxing, of understanding what is happening.
Suddenly, in the quiet, a lightning bolt hits the floor in front of the rarely used telescope and from the dust, Jack emerges.
But Dean can’t promise anything. He wants to, so badly. He wants to tell Jack he will live the happiest life and find joy in the mundane and get a real job, maybe a house with proper windows and ventilation, perhaps a garden for Miracle. But every time he thinks of it, Castiel is always by his side. And that terrifies him.
He puts the 'your type' in air-quotes with a slight smile and Dean thinks he might lose his mind. Because how does he know? How can he be so sure? The part of him that has been holding this back, for as long as he can remember, knows it would be so much easier if Castiel could just speak plainly and out loud and put it into the world before Dean gets a chance to, before he can muster up the words.
“The man is a pastor,” Sam is both enthused and amused. “I’m not sure he would agree.”
The end of the road arrives quicker than Castiel expects, on account of no such thing existing in this version of Heaven. To the side of the road sits a motel, ivy crawling the outside walls, rust settling into the staircases and railings, water damage staining the doors. The sign blinks above them as Dean pulls the car in and cuts the engine.
“No,” he repeats.
And he doesn’t have an answer that will satisfy anyone.
to have ever.
“He’s listening,” Dean says. “I pray to him too.”
“Cas,” Dean finally chokes out, perhaps desperately, refusing to look away. Castiel meets his eyes and feels the calm leave him. This is it. He took too long. He took this for granted. This is where he is cast out. This is where Dean tells him to leave. This is… “Stay with me.”
“This man says he’s been experiencing blackouts for days at a time and the allegations against him,” Sam laughs a little. “Orgies, excessive drinking, bar fights, murder in dark alleys, and an altar behind the church with blood all over it.”
He thinks he can hear Claire calling after him, but it doesn’t matter.
“I didn’t want anything to change.”
The next day he finds Sam praying in Jack’s room. Dean hesitates before knocking on the doorframe. Part of him wants to run away before Sam sees him, but another part is curious – what does his brother pray to their three-year old deity about?
“Hello, Dean,” he smiles.
“I’ve got a case,” Sam declares, Dean only just making it into the library. Castiel is sat at another table typing on his new laptop. Dean’s just glad to see it being used after having to fake an entirely new credit card to buy it.
“Later. Did you find the grave?” Sam asks, a little out of breath.
And then it stops.
“So,” Dean coughs a little. “How you doing, man?”
“Are you sure?” Sam tries, but it’s not quite enough.
“Yes, Sammy, I’m sure,” he sighs. “You know how I feel about those sons-of-bitches.”
Because Castiel is a soul now.
“Let’s clean this mess up and go home,” Dean announces to the room, stepping out of the tiny space still left between Castiel and himself. He doesn’t look at Sam, but he can hear the barely stifled chuckling, he can see the grin from the corner of his eye as they pick up their weapons, and he hears the contented sigh when Castiel leads them from the room, back to the Impala. And it feels okay. And it feels good.
There’s an internal thread of thought that Dean is trying to push down, that desperately wants to answer the question. It starts with John Winchester and ends somewhere in the general attitude of the world, of the image Dean has worked hard to cultivate, but he doesn’t want to listen anymore.
him, with something he’s never spoken aloud, barely dared to even think about.
“No.”
He sees him in his dreams.
“Yeah,” Jack grins. “It’s me.”
. Dean gives a tiny nod, mouth open, gaping, before reaching for Castiel’s face and pulling him closer, his lips meeting Castiel’s again, quickly and crushing and it feels like nothing he’s ever felt before. Castiel grips onto Dean’s sleeve so tight Dean wonders if he might rip the fabric. But it’s the ease at which this is happening that trips Dean’s mind the most. He doesn’t care that Castiel is an angel, a man, anything, really. He just cares that he loves him and wants him. Years of torturing himself boil down to this simple moment, this simple revelation, and it feels like the biggest win in the world.
“How did you know?” Dean asks, almost accusing. And now, Castiel must speak. Heaven won’t do it for him.
Castiel says nothing.
Castiel pulls back after a moment, dragging his teeth across Dean’s lower lip as he does, and stares at him, searching his eyes for
“He doesn’t care about you, Dean,” it says with a laugh. “He lied to you. He doesn’t love you.”
“So what’s going on, kid?” he cringes as he says it. He’s not a kid, not really. Not anymore. He’s not going to be trying to get Dean to watch Star Wars with him, begging for another chance to drive the Impala, matching his clothes to Castiel whenever he can because he looks up to him so damn much. He’s… something else now.
Dean doesn’t know any other life right now. He has job applications waiting to be filled on his desk, beds that need to be made, laundry that needs to be put away. But it all seems so tiny, so insignificant, in the face of his real purpose.
He’s just empty.
Sam’s incantation was correct, the scrap of the jacket added to the bowl opened the portal, and the black tendrils wrapping around the portal entrance sat in the middle of the library, taunting Dean. Torturing him with the images he hasn’t been able to get out of his head.
seen Mary?”
Days pass and pages turn, and the words all begin to look like Enochian. The Men of Letters knew about multiple universes, they knew how to cure a demon, they knew to ward against God and angels. But they don’t have a single mention of where an angel or demon goes when they die.
Dean only nods and seats himself on the sofa across from the bed.
“Okay,” Dean starts. “Rule number one: don’t ask me for relationship advice. Rule number two: you know Eileen better than anyone, Sammy. You know if she’ll want the big gesture.”
He doesn’t have to ask Castiel to stay.
Research is hard and Dean all but gives up. Beer starts his day. Whiskey ends it. Over and over, between rounds of bacon and burgers and pizza and cartoons and hunts so easy he wonders if the people they’re trying to save couldn’t have just done it themselves. The books lay over the library tables, the kitchen table, in stacks around Dean’s room and in the moments when he’s feeling even just a speck of hope, he might look in them one more time, one last time, just one more read-through…
There is a pause, and a slight huff. But he refuses to look.
“I hope so,” Dean says around a mouthful. “I keep wondering if I did something wrong, but I think it was the Shadow.”
Dean knows how this can go.
White noise fills his ears, and blind rage fills his eyes.
But here, in this utopia of Dean’s own devising, toes in the sand and basking in the heat of a summer sunset, Dean kisses Castiel back and holds him as tight as he can. As they separate, Dean kisses Castiel’s temple and holds him as they watch the sea go out, arms around his shoulders, Castiel’s arm around his waist, and the sun moving lower and lower and lower.
“Eileen and I have been talking a lot lately,” Sam speaks into the silence, cautiously. “About where we see this thing we have going, the future, you know? That sort of thing?”
“Maybe not, but I want to see him,” Dean says, his confidence betraying the chaos beneath his skin. “Don’t make me fight you.”
“I can’t risk taking this from you, Sammy,” Dean tries to smile, tries to make it okay but he can’t. Because it isn’t, really. But what can he do? “She’s in the life, and she’s damn good at her job. And she loves you, man. Who else is going to understand you that way? If you see a future with her you should have it.”
“It’s not much,” Castiel wants to look away. He wants to look at anything, but his gaze has been captivated. “Small two-bed lakeside cottage, like Kelly’s house. There’s a fishing spot out back and a garage, if you need it.”
And he’d be lying if he didn’t say it was starting to feel… comfortable.
Save for Crowley, Dean hasn’t ever seen a demon try to possess an angel. Or rather, he’s never seen a demon burn from the inside out by the sheer will of the grace held inside an angel bursting to the surface. The demon doesn’t burst out into smoke or try to run away. It can’t. Dean feels the grip around his neck loosen and the hand on his shoulder drop completely.
“How?” Dean asks.
“Alright, Dean, enough,” Sam laughs and holds his hand up to stop the conversation. And then, after a moment: “Feels good to win, doesn’t it?”
“Good job, Jack,” Dean prays, mostly to himself. “Are you happy now?”
Within seconds he has a spell, ingredients, and a drive to succeed.
And if he thinks about the last time he spoke to Jack, the last time he saw him, and how he squandered it. He barely said goodbye to his kid. He barely recognised what it would mean.
“But it’s the only way,” Dean finally looks up. “God approved!”
Dean thinks about it. He has no clue. He doesn’t know how to live a real life with a house and a job and bills and neighbours and…
“Yes, it was,” Castiel agrees with a small smile. “But you saved me, again.”
“It’s not far from the Roadhouse,” Castiel continues, trying to fill the silence. He feels awkward. He feels clumsy and impatient and
“It’s okay if you don’t want to go, I can go with Sam,” Castiel offers, failing to understand exactly what Dean’s issue is. If only he knew how dry his mouth had become, how dead he felt inside at the very idea of it. “I want to get back to normal.”
“And if I don’t want to?”
“I wish I had time to tell you what you needed, deserved to hear. I don’t know why I couldn’t say anything but god, Cas,” Dean struggles, and sighs. “I don’t want paradise if you don’t get to be in it too. You fought for this and believed in this so you should be here, with us.”
“Before then.”
. But so misunderstood.
“So, you think my mom knew?” Dean asks, and he still hasn’t moved.
With almost no air in his lungs, he chokes a little and sits a little straighter.
Sam smiles and turns to face Dean. He settles his hands on his lap and Dean knows this will be serious.
“But I have a way that
It feels like an age between the vamp grabbing him and Castiel’s calm request but in reality, it is seconds. And in the next he’s covered in vamp blood, but the hold on him is gone. Castiel stands to the side with a shotgun in his hand, still hot from the accurate shot that has blown the head clean off of the vampire in question, the one that was about to kill Dean. Sam has seen off his own vamp, but it doesn’t matter. Dean hears some quiet praise from Sam, from somewhere behind him, telling Castiel he did a good job, but the words feel hollow. They’re not good enough.
"Yeah," Dean shakes his head with a smile and finally the embarrassment hits. He hides his face in his hands until he feels Castiel's hands over his, gripping them and pulling them down just enough so he can see Dean's face. He's a lot closer than he was a minute ago. Dean didn’t notice Miracle being dumped on Dean’s chair, or Castiel making his way towards him. Dean can see the blue of his eyes so clearly and in Castiel's happiness, they're vibrant.
He wonders what would happen if Famine rolled into town now. Would it be true this time? That’s he’s empty inside? Or would the craving for something he can barely understand consume him until he flings himself into
Dean is halfway through processing how significant this contact is, how much of a potential lead he has in his hands right now, when he cuts himself off and gets to it. Naomi doesn’t want to hang around and neither does Dean.
Sam returns, panting a little. His expression falls as Eileen emerges from the stairs with yet another box.
Awake or asleep, they’re always there. He hears Castiel’s voice as clear as day and every time, conscious or unconscious, dreaming or deep sleeping, it squeezes around his chest like a vice. The tightness has yet to subside.
This dead end has to be the last.
Sam is staring at the elephant in the room and begging Dean to look at it, but the elephant is crushing Dean clear as day in a room with an audience, where he can’t bear to feel vulnerable. He drops the plate in the sink and makes for the doorway.
“You made all this?” Dean asks, after a year or two passes on Earth. He’s gesturing at the motel, at the sign, at the authentic run-down American road-trip experience. And yet he means the very fabric of this realm, this cosmic place.
He smells the rubber burning and glances at the tyre tracks left in the road from the rear-view mirror.
“No,” Castiel smiles, sadly. “That came later, when I was looking for you.”
He wants to risk it for Castiel.
Over the next couple of days, Dean pretends like the conversation never happened. He cooks food, watches TV, shares his favourite horror movies with Castiel, and reluctantly takes him shopping for more clothes when he asks. The trenchcoat stays though. No matter how many different tops, pants or ties he may now have, the trenchcoat remains. Dean doesn’t know whether to be glad about it or not, but he remains painfully aware that the flash of tan fabric in his peripheral is instantly soothing.
“No!” Dean responds, strained. “Bobby mentioned you were around, and I just left. I just drove away from the bar and didn’t stop until I found you and… Cas. What did she say?”
The realisation washes over Dean instantly. It wraps him up and holds him tight. He can barely see, he can barely understand. Why is he interrogating demons and shredding books looking for spells that don’t exist?
“Sorry, baby,” he grumbles, pushing faster, but giving the steering wheel a gentle sweep. A small gesture of comfort.
But now things
“Yeah, I guess you’re right,” Sam says. “Do you think I should ask or just clear a drawer for her and give her a key?”
And something shifts and Dean feels younger and Sam feels wiser and god, if that doesn’t make Dean feel
And so, they do.
“No, Dean, you don’t understand,” Sam tries, but Dean won’t let him.
He kicks off his shoes and revels in the heat he feels between his toes.
“You think he’s lonely?” Dean can’t help but indulge this particular thread.
“You don’t understand,” Jack tries again. “I’m not supposed to be watching over
“I don’t know,” he answers honestly.
“Go on.”
“It’s not,” Dean laughs, and then laughs harder when Sam flips him off.
But then suddenly it’s awkward.
“It’s kind of stupid,” Sam says into the silence. “But I feel like he might hear me a little clearer if I’m in here.”
“That you… you know. What you told me, before-”
"I don't think you can guarantee that," Dean laughs, quietly.
“Cas,” Dean forces out, his voice scratchier than it was moments before. “Hang in there, man.”
He’s scanning the pages of a study on demons, specifically how they die, when the lights begin to flash in the library room. Sam looks up from one of Rowena’s spell books to take notice when the map table begins to flash, and the lights switch to red. Dean immediately grabs his gun and Sam grabs one of the weapons on display. The tables begin to shake, and books fall from the shelves.
“Fine,” Castiel answers immediately.
“It doesn’t matter!” Dean eventually explodes. “My feelings or whatever, none of it matters. What does matter is that he is stuck in the middle of God knows what probably living out his worst nightmares every single day and we might have a shot at saving him, bringing him home. I want you with me on this, but I’ll do it on my own if I have to.”
But mostly, he really doesn’t want to talk about it.
Dean lets out the breath he didn’t know he was holding and presses his forehead to Castiel’s, pressing hard enough to leave a mark. “Never again,” he says quietly. “You’re never doing this to me again.”
Dean nods.
“Really?”
Castiel nods and stands to join Dean where he is trying not to pace. Trying not to sweep a lamp from the table to the floor. “Alright, Dean. I’m sorry, I didn’t know you felt that way. I’ll be more careful.”
Miracle wakes and lifts his head with a slight grumble. Under his paw sits Castiel’s handprint, bloody and stained, but still so clear.
“I’m bringing you home, Cas. I’m going to make this right.”
Dean slams his foot down on the clutch and shifts gear. The gearbox crunches and he presses on the gas before the clutch can scream at him as he raises it. The Impala races forward, dust billowing into the air all around. It’s sunset, and the Impala looks golden, coated in sand and dust and glowing. Dean races towards nothing, the road empty before him and nothing but fields either side.
“But this time we had a deal. Whatever it thought it was getting from me in that deal, it wasn’t going to lose easily.” Castiel is sombre, but Dean has yet to see any signs of regret. Any hints that this probably wasn’t what he really wanted. “The Empty thrives on angelic and demonic energy. My body, vessel, personality, none of that was important. That was just personal.”
of that name finding its shape in Dean’s mouth wouldn’t make him sick. “What happened? How did he summon the Empty?”
Castiel nods, then nods again, then chooses his words carefully.
Dean squirms a little in his chair and hides the way his body forces a smile back. He’s sitting opposite Castiel at one of the tables and accidentally knocks his foot whilst trying to wriggle away from the implications in that one simple sentence.
“Maybe,” Dean grins, taking a sip. “And no, we shouldn’t help. They’ve got this.”
, he thinks, as the headlights flood him and drown him. He can only imagine how godly he looks in this minute - aflame, gracious, celestial. But it doesn't intimidate the person stepping out of the car, leaning on the driver side door as it hangs open and grinning, slightly lopsided.
“Sure does, Sammy,” Dean stands, pats Sam on the shoulder and makes to leave. “Tell Jack I said ‘hi’.”
“Don’t you worry,” Dean jokes, because it’s about all he can do. He’s grateful for the opportunity when he feels like he’s choking. “I’ll be my usual charming, reckless self. We’ll be back before you know it.”
Donna is fumbling around her belt and as quick as a flash, Dean sees a small vial of holy water in her hands.
“And how’s your heart now?”
“Yeah, maybe one day,” Sam confirms.
“Cas-”
And then, Dean kisses him.
But as ever, he waits, and he gets nothing.
None of them can do anything.
“Sorry,” Dean rubs his face with the palm of his hand, furiously attempting to wipe his bad decisions away. “You don’t-”
He gestures between them. The Righteous Man and a fallen angel sitting in the front seat of the Impala, outside of a motel Castiel can barely remember manifesting. And Castiel just doesn’t understand.
“Ask you what?”
“Sam,” Dean sighs. “I can’t explain it, I don’t want to explain it. I just need to try, and I’d like you to help me.”
Sam sighs. So does Eileen.
“This doesn’t seem ethical.”
"I'm so sorry, Dean," he tries for sympathy, and finally presses two fingers to Dean's forehead to try and make it better. But he can’t. Instead, he's overcome by calm and ease, and as he moves gently to lean against the car, Dean's hands rush to hold him. "You seem happy."
He wants to cry, feels the urge building from his chest and prickling at his eyes, but he swallows it down, and with one look at Castiel’s utterly bewildered face, he laughs and laughs and laughs. Sam in the corner, by the shelves, relieved and astonished, unharmed. Dean turns to Castiel, grinning, elated.
Dean jolts from sleep and tries to rub the memory of Castiel’s last words from his mind the same way he rubs the night from his eyes.
He sees Sam shaking his head, resting his face in the palms of his hands, elbows on the table, but he won’t back down.
“Yes.”
“I shouldn’t have gone on that hunt,” Dean says into Castiel’s skin, gripping tight over his ribs.
“No, he wasn’t,” Dean teases in his most absurd voice, wiggling his eyebrows, incredibly pleased with himself and delighting in the disgust that immediately shows on Sam’s face.
With every fibre of that stupid trenchcoat under his fingertips, his chin, his arms, wherever he can physically touch, he feels the universe stitching itself back together in every one of his cells and he knows this is right. This is good. This isn’t a win with cosmic consequences like defeating Chuck or Amara, or even Death itself, but it’s the biggest win Dean is after. It’s the only win he wants. And he never wants to chase it ever again.
And later still, Miracle will join them in the Roadhouse where Dean can look around see everyone he has ever loved and everyone he has ever lost, and then, finally, Castiel will look to the moon, and he will feel the weight of it as it sets, and the sun begins to glow on the lake’s horizon. He will feel the pull of the moon winking at him as it blinks from the sky and he will know what it means as Dean reaches to hold his hand and watch the sunrise with him.
, he hears, but this time he smiles. The sun is high in the sky, the moon is hiding, and his grace now barely a spark in his chest.
Dean leaves his seat and walks a few steps away, head in his hands, gazing at the ceiling.
“I know,” Dean plates the bacon and hopes to… Jack that Sam can’t see the slight wobble of the pan in his hand.
need to keep talking about it.
As Castiel moves closer, the fire roars and the flames lick higher. He steps into Dean’s space, desperate to reach out and touch him, to press his fingers to him and lightly press his grace into his skin, to calm him, soothe him. Give him some peace.
“What made you get him?”
And yet the euphoria he was sure to feel is bittered by the loss of Jack, the temporary loss of all they loved, and the overwhelming loss of Castiel.
And Dean knows why.
“No, but I’m sure he’s not immune to feeling like the odd one out.”
“It is,” Sam agrees with a gentle laugh. “I want to make sure the choices I make include her. I don’t want to plan my future without her being in it.”
“Then go for it,” Dean smiles. “Throw that key in a box, get down on one knee and ask her to join us in the finest, cheapest real estate in all of America”
“I shouldn’t have let the Empty take you,” Dean groans, turning his face into the pillow. “I thought about it so much after you were gone, all the things I should have done. I’m so sorry, Cas.”
, but the only thing Dean can see is his best friend paraded around by a creature so abhorrent to Castiel. There isn’t any justice.
And why does it always have to be him?
He stares right at Castiel… and he nods.
“I know,” Dean mumbles, ceasing his onslaught of affection to rest back on his own pillow and watch Castiel, intensely.
Or if this has just been another pointless endeavour of a man failing to grieve.
“This is about bringing Cas back, right?” Sam starts, slowly. But Dean’s not an idiot. “We’ve lost countless people we couldn’t bring back. We clean up, we move on. Charlie, mom, dad, Rowena… you just can’t do it when it’s him.”
comes down to this.
"Shall I come back later?" Dean jokes, but Castiel isn't feeling jovial. He is an angel, with a promotion. But the second he felt Dean Winchester arrive, he lost his grip. His godly purpose, his divine plan, his heavenly architecture, all utterly meaningless in the face of a soul that deserved to live, clutching at Castiel's faith and refusing to let go.
“Dean-”
“We need to try.”
"Hello, Dean," he finally says. "You're early."
He hasn’t seen a single person since he left the bunker and he’s had no one to listen to but Sam and all Sam wants to know is what happened to Castiel and there’s just nothing but grass and sand and fields and mountains and the sun is setting on the day.
"Cas," Dean inhales, deeply, but the smile never really leaves his face. "Get in, let’s go for a drive.”
Miracle stirs from his place at the foot of his bed and twitches his ears.
“I think it would help you to move on too,” he continues. “Last time he died, you-”
It makes a horrific kind of sense that Castiel would sacrifice himself to the one place that no one had ever heard of, and no one knew about until they got there. It makes a sick karmic sense that Castiel’s final moments have doomed Dean to a mission he can’t possibly fulfil, to a point of no return. It’s almost nihilistic but Dean thinks he deserves it.
Dean joins him in a heartbeat, scrambling to him while trying to catch his breath, reaching to grasp at his face, his shoulder, his arm… anywhere. Anywhere he can find a sign of life.
He throws the demon blade to the ground and leaves.
“Just your regular Friday night,” Dean smiles a little, but it doesn’t quite make it all the way.
They quietly pick up the remainder of the spell ingredients, including the jacket, and take them to room 7b, because somehow it feels right. They’re not rushing. Everything is eerily calm.
Dean can only bring himself to laugh a little. If he doesn’t laugh, he’s sure he won’t hold himself together.
“I don’t understand the way you see me,” Dean starts, swallowing down any instinct to abort the mission and retreat. “But I need you to know… I heard what you said so I know why you do.”
“‘Whatever she’s been doing’ meaning staying here five nights a week and spending the other two days a week in the library nerding out with you?”
Within three days, the Impala is packed, hugs are exchanged, and they take off without a plan or a schedule and only one goal. They’ll be back at the bunker one day, and Dean hasn’t seen his last hunt, but this is the break he’s earned. This is the break he fought so hard for.
He knows it’s not often that their vessels wake up.
This is what Dean has been chasing.
And Castiel does, with wide and confused eyes.
And honestly? No.
“Good luck,” Sam offers and pulls him into a quick hug.
“Dean,” Jack admonishes. “You know I can tell when you’re not being truthful.”
“When he comes back.”
Miracle yelps, throws himself at a slightly-more-awake Dean and nestles under his chin. Dean holds him tight and tries once more to push it down, to focus on the life he has won. To live this life that Castiel died for.
against Castiel's lips, and just holds him for a moment.
“Yeah,” Dean laughs but this time, it doesn’t come from inside. It’s shallow, hollow. It doesn’t mean anything. “It was free but… most of the time I just wanted to do this.”
“Come on then,” Dean bluffs. “Tear me to shreds, it wouldn’t be the first time.”
Castiel wonders if Dean can feel betrayed in Heaven. This place is supposed to be his paradise where nothing can hurt him, where Castiel created an environment that will always keep Dean Winchester safe. Negativity has no place in eternal peace and yet… Castiel looks at Dean’s face, slightly defeated but eyes as bright as he remembers, and he wonders. He wonders if his absence really was felt so profoundly that it latched onto Dean’s soul and followed him into his next existence, whether it should have or not.
“You’ll need that,” Sam says without looking at him, gesturing vaguely in the direction of the blade. “I don’t know how effective it is in the Empty but it’s better to go heavy-handed than not at all.”
Dean grabs at his wrist and pulls him closer, doesn’t hesitate. His arms wrap behind Castiel’s back, the kiss deepening every second. Castiel responds, a hand on Dean’s neck and the other on his waist and he wonders if Heaven has ever seen an act so holy. The fire calms down, his grace completely burned, but Dean catches him before he falls.
to risk it for Castiel.
“I can’t do this anymore, Sammy,” he says, dejected. “Hunting, demons, angels, all of it. I don’t want it.”
Dean is about to turn the doorknob when it suddenly flies open, and there he is. Castiel is wearing one of Dean’s old t-shirts and some lounge pants that he probably found in the drawers. His hair is a mess and it’s obvious that he hasn’t found his way around a razor yet. But he looks rested. And he looks… good. Really good.
“Things are… different now.”
Dean is referring to the unmade bed. The duvet bundled at the bottom of the bed. The robe, hastily thrown on top of the bed. The crinkles in the pillows. The
“Fuck,” Dean is suddenly wide-eyed. “Did you propose or something?”
Castiel is standing on the dock at the lake, looking out over the water next to deck chairs set out for two. There are fallen trees around the lake edge and empty bottles of beer scattered in front of him. His trench coat rests on the back of a chair and Dean’s footsteps are loud and clear behind him. Dean drops his head on Castiel’s shoulder and presses quiet kisses into it, arms wrapped around Castiel from behind.
It takes five more sunrises and four sunsets before Castiel kicks the sheets from his legs, tangled around his ankles, and holds Dean close.
He’s succeeded.
“I never wanted to make you feel uncomfortable, Dean,” Castiel rushes to clarify, placing his other hand on top of theirs, still together. “And we don’t have to talk about it. I never intended to ever have to say anything, but it was the only way to keep you safe in that moment.”
“But you’re not normal, are you?” Dean’s tone wasn’t what he intended, and he regrets his words as soon as he says them, but the point stands. He’s not going to take it back now, no matter how much the hurt look Castiel throws his way makes him squirm. “You’re all out of angel juice! What are you going to do if this thing comes for you?”
“He was my friend too, Dean,” Sam is gentle in his tone, but Dean hears the demand to just stop fucking around. It wouldn’t get to him so much, but Sam asked last week over a nightcap and tried to ask when they first defeated Chuck.
Although Castiel still isn’t really listening to him, but Dean’s not sure he’s even articulating what needs to be heard.
fathom how on Earth, with all that Dean had worked for and won, he would want something so mundane.
. The sky streaks blue and black and the moon is so huge, so vast. It seems to pulse as his grace siphons from him, funnels into the abyss.
That doesn’t sit so easily with Dean, doesn’t settle in his stomach the way he needs it to. But he can give his kid what he wants, one last time. “I’ll try,” is all he can muster but the way Jack smiles back makes it worth the effort.
“Well at least you can stop coddling me whenever I so much as think about going on a hunt,” Castiel rolls his eyes, purposefully picks the beer back and takes a mouthful.
“But you should!” Dean insists, bursting at the seams.
they are, at how expressive Castiel apparently can be – has probably always been – but the thrill of every kiss offers a relief that washes over his anxieties. He spent so long without this easy affection that allowing himself to receive it has made any and all resistance he ever tried seem trivial and nonsensical. “Is this stuff all yours?”
Castiel leans against the nearest wall as Dean circles the coffee table, shuffling some of the photos around: Dean and Sam as children, John and Mary before they were married, Dean and Mary when she came back…
“I know,” Jack squeezes him back. “And you’ll make him happy. He deserves to be feel happy.”
“Jack.”
He didn’t ask him to do anything.
“What are you talking about? Jack stopped you from coming back?”
“If it’s the difference between you being alive or dead, yes!” Dean raises his voice because he’s tried, but he just can’t keep it at bay.
His skin tingles, and his wings itch, as the feathers shed and his grace drifts towards the moon. In a heartbeat, it vanishes from existence and the warm glows of sunrise emerge behind the worn-down building.
“Hey, man,” Dean shuffles across the floor to reach out and grab at Castiel’s sleeve. “Look at me.”
Just as the demon adopts Castiel’s odd head tilt, Donna empties the vial onto the demon’s hand around her neck and breaks free as the skin burns. She runs to Sam, but the demon doesn’t care. It advances on Dean as Sam throws more holy water to deter it. Dean keeps moving backwards, makes sure the demon follows him, and eventually they land exactly where they need to be... if the universe was playing fair, anyway.
“I don’t even know what memory this is,” Castiel says quietly, sitting up from the floor.
Because he’s one of Heaven’s charges.
Dean swallows, hard. And Castiel has to look away for a moment.
“When Jack brought you back and you knew Chuck was gone, why did you stay away?”
“I do, I’m in stupid love with you.”
“Alright,” he says quietly instead. “Let’s bring him home.”
“No.”
“Imagine if we had tried to fight Billie,” Dean continues anyway. “We wouldn’t be here, now.”
Dean shakes his head, but the shit-eating grin remains.
Dean nods, suddenly feeling wide awake. He doesn’t even question the legitimacy of it. “I’ll go get ready, then.” He gestures to his hotdog pyjamas with a smirk, but his heart is hammering in his chest and really, he’d go save Castiel wearing a dress if he had to, but he needs to calm down. He needs to focus. Because this really is last-chance-saloon. All his moping and self-deprecating and desperate need to
He grabs him by the shoulder and shakes him a little, and it earns him a groggy half-smile and a hand gripping at his own. “I’ll live,” Castiel jokes and accepts Dean’s help to stand. Dean turns to check Sam is okay and finds him standing but limping.
Nothing but a curious glance from Miracle where he’s curled up on the other chair when Dean’s bottle smashes into the wall.
“Dean-”
Which means a vamp gets him in a hold, gripping him by his head and trying to bend his neck just so. Dean is struggling, flailing with his blade, trying to get a hit but he’s overwhelmed. He glances at Sam who is fending off his own opponent and he can’t even see Castiel anymore. He’s going to get his throat ripped out. He’s going to bleed out into this vampire’s mouth and he’s going to die here.
“Then how?”
But at that, Castiel does finally look up, sees the amusement on Dean’s face and allows himself a small breath, for comfort more than anything.
Dean nods and looks him in the eye.
He stands in the Heaven he created to wrap a blanket around Dean, and the soul carved from his grace hums peacefully, happily, and finally. He takes in the scent of earth and spice and day-old beer, of peppermint and slightly dirty clothes.
changes.
“Mmhmm,” Dean says and Castiel can feel him smiling. “He appeared at the end of the drive this morning.”
And even later than that, Miracle will join Dean as he drives to a bridge on the very edge of Heaven and brings his brother home.
Dean laughs, tries to break the tension. He’d normally give Sam a big speech, some acknowledgement of how Sam needs to live his life so he’s safe from harm, so he doesn’t suffer the same fate should Dean not return. But he looks at him now, in this post-Chuck world, before this mission that doesn’t really have anything to do with Sam anyway, and he knows he doesn’t need to do it. Sam has Eileen, he has the bunker and a whole host of hunter friends. He’s uniquely skilled in so many different and exciting ways and he has a new determination to live, to enjoy the freedom he fought for. Sammy will be just fine.
“Miracle,” Castiel says, without guessing. Because he knows. Because he looked to the moon last night and he felt the shift, and he wondered if Jack left him just a spark of grace after all.
He’s trying to fill it up with beer and scotch and occasional nights swimming in tears, but nothing satisfies it.
And then he pushes it aside and wonders why Miracle brought it back to him at all.
summoned
“Welcome home, man.”
Castiel can have the room back when he comes back.
“I miss him, Jack,” Dean sighs, brings a bottle to his lips and takes more than he should. “But you know that because you were there last time I lost- we lost him. It’s not paradise until he gets to be in it too. So, if you can do
Dean grips Castiel’s chest, hard, as though trying to reach in and actually touch his heart. But instead, he counts the beats, the impossible beats. Another trick from Heaven.
“All right,” Castiel nods, and Dean finally breathes.
Because it’s still hard to say. He still fears the Empty if he so much as allows himself to even think of all the ways Dean Winchester has imprinted on his life and changed his very being. He still fears the rejection he was so sure Dean would deliver without hesitation.
The room is as sparse as it always has been. The bed is made, barely slept on. The wardrobe empty, personal items never there to be missed and not a single thing that indicates the room has ever been used, let alone occupied for several years.
He whirls around and faces himself.
“It’s different from before,” Castiel smiles and sits on the edge of his bed. “Last time, the Shadow returned me as I was before I died because it wanted rid of me. It was a negotiation.”
He knows all this.
And Sam’s not surprised. He’s not shocked. He just smiles and nods.
"You're wrong," he finally forces himself to say. "You have no idea."
Dean feels like he’s lost a limb. He’s flailing around, trying to adjust, but he has no reason to believe he can. He’s lost so many, his mom, Jack, C… but any semblance of faith that he ever considered himself to have has also vanished.
“Then let’s go.”
“Well, I think he’s great,” Castiel says in a voice Dean has never heard before, as he leans down and speaks directly into Miracle’s fur. Castiel is rewarded with Miracle nuzzling him right back for a moment and Dean… “Looking after a dog will seem simple after an archangel’s Nephilim.”
“Cas,” Dean starts, barely above a whisper, and he knows he has his full attention. Castiel is laser focused on him, head tilted ever so slightly with a barely-there frown nestling into his brow and Dean can see it all. Because he’s right there. “Cas, I-”
As Castiel pulls away from the kiss, his hand travels down Dean’s body leaving goosebumps in its wake, settling between them as Castiel palms Dean through his pyjama pants and Dean’s hips buck to meet him.
“I didn’t,” Dean shrugs, leaning against the car and gazing up at the flickering sign. The sun is casting a glow over him so gently but he’s so vibrant he almost looks alive. “I just wanted to feel normal again. Cas…”
“You know I actually don’t know if we have,” Dean laughs miserably. “We might start another apocalypse.”
“Wait,” he says, quietly. “Please?”
“No,” Castiel agrees. “I would have helped, saved you, if I could.”
“What? How?” he immediately sits back down, his full attention on Dean.
“Guess who just showed up?” Dean murmurs into Castiel’s t-shirt, gripping tight around his middle.
“Got it,” they continue to laugh. “The Shadow would consume you as soon as you arrived, why bother? I’m just looking out for you, buddy.”
But whatever grace Castiel had managed to pull together to heal Dean in the Empty has depleted, so now he sleeps. He settles back into his bland, vacant room, so devoid of personal effects, and promptly collapses into the bed. He doesn’t wake for at least twelve hours, at first.
“And now, assuming you don’t piss off any more cosmic entities and get yourself killed, we’re going to save him.”
“That’s not what Bobby says,” Dean twirls his car keys around his index finger, amusement across his face.
Dean slams his foot on the clutch and shifts gear, immediately pressing on the gas to gain more speed, speed, speed. The road is empty before him, nothing but grassy hills and trees on one side and California coastline on the other. It’s not a trip he ever thought he would take but here he is, car growling below him, Castiel next to him in a loose shirt and sunglasses that they’d picked up in some coastal town in Oregon, Miracle half on his lap and half on the seat, and the smell of fresh sea air flowing through the open windows.
Sam starts hunting with Eileen full-time and Dean spends his days in the Dean Cave – bad television, cartoons, drinking beer, replenishing the beer, cheap snacks, occasional porn, bad television… and so on. But none of it helps. None of it satisfies the need to stop hunting, nothing vindicates the feeling that none of it is worth it anymore.
“You know that’s not true,” Sam laughs it off, but the surprise of the statement and the ease at which Sam said it hits Dean right in the chest. Sam’s right. Of course, he’s right. But it doesn’t make it any easier to hear. “Have you spoken to him yet, about how he died?”
Dean dares to look at him and sees the universe in Jack’s eyes. He sees the millennia of existence, creation and myriad worlds and stars. He sees paradise, and with the smallest glimmer of hope he finally wants in on it.
“I need to know how to get into the Empty,” he says. He hasn’t moved from his bed and he’s still in his t-shirt and boxers. Miracle is still curious, wagging his tale cautiously but overwhelmingly interested. Naomi doesn’t even look at him. She only laughs.
“Fine,” Dean says, but he’s hitting a tone he instantly regrets. He didn’t come here to get angry. He didn’t come to start a fight. “But we dealt with that. Why didn’t you say anything after that?”
“Are you sure we can’t call someone else to do this? It’s just an exorcism.”
Over and over until he wonders if he even has vocal cords left. The Shadow keeps kicking him, hitting him, pushing him, but he’s waking the Empty up. He’s disrupting everything. The humanoid shapes are getting closer, multiplying by the minute. Dean’s body is broken but he only came here to do one thing, so he’s going to do it.
“Great,” Dean mumbles through a mouthful of fries.
Miracle jumps back onto the bed and nestles under Dean’s chin, nuzzling into his chest, but Dean finds no comfort in it.
“Sam’s face looks incredibly red,” Castiel winces sympathetically, as Sam heaves another box to his room.
“No!” The Shadow yells.
“You said you were hands-off,” Dean lies. “And I listened.”
He knows somewhere a tree has fallen to Dean’s will, perhaps a storm cloud forming on the horizon. But he can’t
"You can have it, Cas," Dean says, still unable to offer him exactly what he means. "What you want, that is. If you still want it."
Dean is shaking as he shrugs Jody’s hand off and he’s furious as he walks away.
“I have literally no one else to ask,” his tone chases desperation and Dean has to close his eyes. “Billie, the Empty, Cas, they’re all gone. You’re the only one who knows anything.”
And so, with a heavy sigh, a full hip flask and a trunk full of clean and ready weapons, Dean drags himself to another vampire nest, another pack of werewolves, another vengeful spirit, another, another, another… Sam is thriving, Dean is wilting, the monsters keep on dying. They have absolutely no leads on how to get to the Empty. And so, everything
“I’m sorry because you shouldn’t have to arrive here and find an angel squatting in your house. It’s unprofessional and actually, a bit rude,” Castiel explains, a well-rehearsed apology. One he knew he was always going to make because when has he ever been able to tear himself away from Dean Winchester? “No one else has had to go through it and you shouldn’t either. I just… I missed you. All of you. You and Sam, and Jack, were the only real family I ever had and even though I was stuck
Dean takes the invitation and sits on the two-seat bench across from the bed.
He wonders if it’s going to happen fast or slow, if he can get Castiel out before it happens or if he will have to find his own way.
“What made him happy?”
“I don’t know what you want me to say, Sam.”
He doesn’t want to talk about it.
“I trust you,” Dean eventually says in a smaller voice. “I do trust you, Cas. You’ve had my back more times than almost anyone I’ve ever known, of course I trust you. I don’t trust myself.”
“Dean,” Castiel says, and he means business. He’s not taking this crap and god, Dean knows he deserves it. But if this is the price he’s going to pay to try and keep him safe? He’ll take it. “Are you suggesting that without my grace I can’t offer anything of use?”
Even if he won’t just talk to him.
“I’m going to rip you limb from limb and I’m going to make him remember. I’m going to make sure the only face you see as you die is his. And then I’m going to laugh so fucking hard.”
“I think she would.”
“Dean!” Sam calls from where he is still on the floor and for the first time, Dean notices that he’s hurt. But he’s shoving a tall wrought iron candlestick across the floor for Dean to catch, and as soon as it is in his hand, he swipes at the ghost who vanishes into particles around them.
