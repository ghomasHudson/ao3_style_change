do-over. I never want to forget all the memories we’ve already made, even the bad ones. Just — can we start from the beginning? You and me, in a lab, chasing down the rest of the world.”
John says the last word with an emphasis that feels almost dirty, and Sherlock feels a flutter in his chest once again.
“I want to say something.” He begins, and curiosity begins to gather on Sherlock’s face. John can see the moment Sherlock stops himself from launching into a series of deductions, and he smirks at the sight. They’d agreed that Sherlock had to let John speak of his own accord sometimes, rather than Sherlock deducing everything he’s thinking. It was a challenge for Sherlock in normal situations, but John could tell that today it seemed even harder for Sherlock to keep quiet.
The first flaw in judgment was that she hadn't stayed in bed. Allowed John’s rhythmic breathing to lull her back to slumber and them both to begin the day together. Instead, she had gotten up. Too excited to keep still at the dazzling possibilities in front of her. The steps down to the kitchen to make coffee and eggs. As domestic as those old magazines that her mum used to leave on the table for guests to ignore.
"Hope about…" John prompts, and there is the huff of mild annoyance that is far more in Sherlock's character.
Most of him is ok with this plan. He’s a bundle of PSD fallout and intermittent tremors. The lady dozing away only a few inches from him deserves better than whatever hobbled back from Afghanistan. John can’t even remember her name.
John. God, he longs to see John again. So much left unsaid, so much left undone. All this time he’d been ignoring the spark between them, trying to quash the less than platonic feelings which had been growing inside of him.
If John was able to pull himself out of his own spiraling bout of humiliation, he would have appreciated the novelty of a thoroughly flummoxed Sherlock Holmes. Having a mind palace to store such a memory would be the most wondrous of things, to replay over and over again until John shuffled off the mortal coil. On second thought, John wasn’t the type to be that Shakespearean when he died. Much more of a kick the bucket kind of bloke.
Sherlock laid his hand on top of John’s and gave it the quickest of squeezes. John’s look of concern turned into a much more mischievous expression.
He stepped lightly around all of the broken items on the floor, already knowing that he would get a call from Mummy about the vase. He probably deserved a fair bit of shouting over that. Once he slowly undid his trousers and pushed them off of his hips along with his pants, he saw the broken stitches were not too bad. Considering the amount of bending and twisting he actually did, it could have been a whole lot worse. The bed creaked under his weight as he laid on his side with the area that needed to be restitched easily reachable.
John doesn’t realise that he’s made up his mind until he’s walking back down the stairs, cringing at each creak of the steps under his feet.
Molly wraps her hand around the cool glass and glances up at her friend. Right now, it seems hard to believe, but she trusts her friend, and Irene has been out for years. If anyone knows what they’re talking about, it’s her.
“For you to assume that he would ever allow it to be broken. You think so little of the closest thing he loved before you existed.”
Molly tries and fails not to sniffle into the receiver. She is already rethinking her plan to whine to Irene about yet another time she wishes that the world could be just a little bit kinder. As if Irene is just a shoulder to cry on instead of a complete person.
were the experiments,” Sherlock whispers. “Collections of data and formulas that passed through my life. I have no ill will towards what I learned from them. They were stops along the way. It is
When Philip Anderson finally left this world, he knew the two regrets that would follow him to his grave. The first was that he fought too hard for Sally Donovan, and the second that he didn't fight enough for Sherlock Holmes. Centuries might as well passed through the floor to ceiling windows of his luxury flat. His wife left him in a fury of screams and tears, while his forensics job hung on by a thread occasionally tugged by Lestrade until even that finally broke under the strain.
“Uh — okay. I’ll have to charge you the same amount as a pint.” The barman looks confused but reaches for the cylinders regardless. It doesn’t pay to ask questions in this part of London.
Sherlock never felt so full and content. John's fingers might be of a surgeon, but his cock was what truly had healing properties. With a purr, Sherlock wrapped his long legs around John's waist to press him in even tighter, and the slight sting of stretching was not only spectacular but life-altering. John might as well be rearranging all of Sherlock's DNA to create a different version of himself. Brighter, stronger and with never-ending bravery.
"I need you to look at something," John said, and Philip bathed in the calmness of the request. "Page 221, in the top right corner."
“Right. Sure.” John feels deflated, the solid conviction that he’d held all the way here dissipating into the chilly room. He perches on the arm of his chair, not trusting his knees to remain upright. “But Sherlock, what was that outburst back at the crime scene?”
When Sherlock moved his head so their lips could meet once again, John groaned and sucked at Sherlock’s bottom lip. He held it between his teeth, preventing Sherlock from pulling away. It had taken some trial and effort to learn what caused Sherlock’s memory lapses. But thanks to nearly two weeks of non-stop experimenting, they both had a healthy idea of what the triggers were.
“When we had that argument in the restaurant,” John begins, the memory of it drifting into his mind as painful as it was just yesterday. The day he’d refused to publicly acknowledge Sherlock as his partner, causing Sherlock to leave him in the cab alone and wander off to Soho. . “Back when I was still so stupid and ignorant of your feelings I…”
. This is right and rich and exactly what they both need. Sherlock whimpers and melts into John’s arms, yielding beneath the weight of his body. Sherlock’s captivating mouth is softer than John remembers it, and the taste of his lips has John wanting to carve his initials in the line of Sherlock’s spine with his nails. He gives those same nails a tentative drag and Sherlock practically melts into his arms at the sensation. The shudders begin and end both of them as they try to make it to a bed. John pulls Sherlock along the hallway, stopping every so often to push him against the wall and kiss him again. Sherlock is pliant and soft in every place John’s body connects with his.
After a knock to her confidence, Molly needs to spend time with a friend who will understand what she's going through
There was a tenderness in John's voice that Sherlock hadn't heard until now. A vulnerable edge that seemed only to be available to witness once in a lifetime, and Sherlock was being given permission not just to look but to soak in every single drop. In the back halls of his mind palace, there came the rustling of a page in a file marked
Where is this coming from? Yesterday, they could barely stand to be in the same room as each other, and now they’re making tea and cracking jokes? John sips warily, his eyes flickering over every inch of the detective, trying to figure out what is different. It can’t  have been that simple — one unintended declaration of love and everything was back to normal. John had been up half the night imagining the worst scenarios — Sherlock asking him to move out, or calling an end to this attempt at friendship. His mind had conjured up every situation possible, anticipated every argument, yet he hadn’t considered this.
“Oh, bloody hell. Is that what this is? You’re trying to placate me so you can get on with the case?”
“Hey there, lovelies,” calls out a doorman dressed in tight black trousers and what can only be tangentially called a shirt. There are so many holes in it that Sherlock half wonders how the man had gotten the top on in the first place. “Free shots until midnight if you’re interested in some fun.”
John kept her tone as soft and frilly as the doilies for her teapots. All while the second man she embraced as a son, grew thinner and more fragile. His soldier stance and steady gaze all dissolving into the half-eaten sandwiches and partially sipped cups of Earl Grey.
John paused at that. He stayed, still and silent, eyes slowly tracing over Sherlock’s face, thinking of something to say. Sherlock felt his own pulse quicken, and a flurry of emotions passed through his stomach and chest.
Over the next few weeks, John tries to push the thoughts away; he really does. But now Mycroft has planted the idea, it begins to nestle deep in his mind. It grows and grows until he can’t ignore it anymore, which is probably why he sees it this time. The subtle changes in their reactions; a gradual fall into the Sherlock and John of the past. He notices, because he’s searching for it.
Sherlock can sense his entire body tightening up, but he makes himself relax. Her tricks and wit are both on full display, and he doesn’t need any of whatever this is. He wants to escape, and feels as if he can’t catch his breath.
"John," Sherlock rasped, which was astronomically stupid because, of course, that was John in between his legs. Sherlock's hands were on each side of John's bowed head, gently gripping him as John nuzzled in even deeper. The first actual sensation of a miraculous tongue on the side of Sherlock's shaft sent a jolt up his spine, and the bell clappers broke free from their bowls.
Sherlock stared at Irene, as if that might help him fully digest her question. Unfortunately, it did not, but he still answered with more honesty than he thought possible.
Harry gives a sympathetic pat on the arm that John is grateful for. His head is a mess; there are at least five different things he wants to say, and he can’t decide where to start.
John goes back and forth about telling Sherlock about Mycroft’s visit. The pros and cons are fairly equal, but what pushes John to a decision is the knowledge that Sherlock will find out whether John’s tells him or not. He doesn't need lying by omission to be tacked onto the bevvy of other problems they are trying not to deal with. Unfortunately, Sherlock is a master of not being around when John needs him. Baker Street is empty when he arrives home, and if he had to guess, he’d say it had been empty all day. The hours feel like days as John waits for Sherlock to return, and John feels more like a pining pet than a proper romantic partner.
“Okay.” The sofa would be a great place to segue into something more physical, and at least this way, both of them would be happy. John would have the pleasure of release, and Sherlock would have a few hours to himself to retreat into his mind palace and find something he’d missed.
As if the world needs to remind the two men that problems still exist, there is the unmistakable sound of what Sherlock Holmes is like when he is at his wit’s end. John and Greg race towards the danger without a second thought, because they are the only ones around to deal with a self-described sociopath with a flare for the dramatics.
"Now," John's voice was still soft, almost a whisper, but there was heat in it, "you were saying all sorts of things earlier. Crazy things, insane things, but one of them… well, you said you wanted me to make love to you. Do you still want that? Because if you do, I do too."
John’s eyes are very much the same as they are in human form. Bright blue with shadows of a deep hazel, only now they are perfectly round and huge in size.
“Did you want to get that?” the female officer suggested. “We have no problem with waiting to hear your answer, Dr. Watson.”
Sherlock frowned and leaned down for a kiss that John dodged. His expression became even more deeply wary.
John’s twilight blue mug sat lonely on the kitchen counter; the tea long since drunk. Greg smelled what must have been Indian take away. The remnants tossed in the bin beside the kitchen sink, which meant that John had eaten tonight. Another worry Mrs. Hudson had conveyed earlier on, so at least that would provide some relief. Sherlock’s room was always locked, so Greg passed by it without even attempting to turn the knob. Its contents sealed up like a museum with only one visitor allowed in and out. Even Mycroft hadn’t tried to collect any of Sherlock’s belongings from the room. Apparently
As always, comments, hits and kudos are wonderful things and make the birds sing. Thank you to WritingOutLoud for their beta reading assistance.
"The body was buried in a previous location," he began. "Look at the dirt. It's a fine type of clay used in landscaping. It’s used in domestic gardens, and there is no sign of that clay anywhere in this park. More than likely the killer dug up the victim and placed him here. A homeless man by the looks of his general appearance, but redressed him in better clothing to try and keep us off the scent.”
Sherlock opened his eyes to see John standing next to the bed, holding two plates in his hands. They were piled up with scrambled eggs, crispy bacon and what looked like a well-intentioned attempt at pancakes.
He half expected Irene to be naked underneath the coat, but instead, she’s dressed in a tight purple shirt and fitted black trousers. Yet more items of his clothing. A thousand questions pass through Sherlock’s mind, half of them variants of ‘where’s John?’. In the end, he settles on: “What do you mean, I chose?”
He was questioning everything, and that wasn’t allowed. Sherlock wasn’t allowed to see anyone as something more than harbingers of data. People were meant to be collections of statistics and superfluous details. Yet John was different in a way that caused the earth not to stand still, but to vibrate.
"If this were my flat, with my name on the lease, I'd be redecorating right now. Brain matter is totally
John could tell by the longing glances both Greg and Sebastian were casting to the door that both men were looking for the first excuse to getaway. Without taking his eyes off of Sherlock, John addressed Sebastian.
As to the next steps, that was simple. The solution clicked like a skeleton key finding its home in a rusty lock. Sherlock was alive. Alive and somewhere that wasn't with John. And when John found him, he’d properly kill him with his bare hands. Then somehow, he would figure out what to do next, and John could work with that. Like another leg injury to carry with him day to day with the aid of a cane.
John chuckles. “It’s a film and…you know what? Never mind. It’s too early for this.” He rolls over, punching the pillow and resettling himself. “New Rule, no painting before coffee.”
11 pm: John made his third mistake of the evening in record time by agreeing that a trip to the more rainbow-centric part of London was fine. It was all fine, really. There was nothing wrong at all with being an ally to his out and proud sister that he should have been decades ago. Besides, gay bars catered to bisexual women too, and John looked good tonight. He leaned back to see his reflection in a mirrored wall. Actually, correction. He looked damned good tonight, and tonight was a very nice night to get laid.
"Your sister used to come crying to me about you, Sebby," John said as he folded himself into his chair, pointedly not looking at the man, "still shooting up and catching STIs? How was rehab?"
“I need this, John,” Sherlock muttered under his breath, closing his eyes and leaning back into the wall behind him. “I need to think.”
John hoists himself up against his pillows and blearily glares over at where Sherlock is sitting on the foot of his bed. This time in his dressing gown and holding a small sketch pad.
“No,” Lestrade says quickly, and John hears the squeak of an ancient mattress as Greg appears to be getting out of his bed. “I’m fine for a night out. Been ages since I did anything after nightfall not connected with work. Which pub are you heading to?”
“I’m dying, and John's love is strong enough for me to sense it.” He whispers, backing himself as far away from the corpse as he can.
"No, I don't know," John agreed with a dip of his chin. "I can guess, based on his first comment to me and his Twitter feed. But I don't
John sturdies his shoulders in preparation for further argument, but Sherlock huffs out a breath before glaring out of the window once more.
By the time they got ready for the game, John was bouncing on the balls of his feet in anticipation, and Sherlock had dressed and reapplied his cologne, hoping that maybe John might at least notice the difference in scent from his regular aftershave.
“I would really like that.” John said, giving Sherlock’s hand a gentle squeeze. “We can figure it out together, yeah?”
“My...but you're such a suspicious one…” she sighs, then lifts her arms in soft surrender. “Feel free to search. I highly doubt that either of us will get anything more out of it than friction burn.”
It doesn’t take long for John to flush the substance down the toilet and crawl back into the warm bed, and when he does, it feels as if a weight has been lifted from his shoulders. They’ll need to talk about it more — God, they need to talk about a lot of things — but it can wait. For now, he just wants to stay in the detective’s arms, protected.
“It’ll match our best lead then,” Sherlock grunted back, but he still picked up the tea and took a few sips before looking back at the photos of the Jacob Nelson crime scene. Sherlock’s eyes widened at the photo John’s elbow was rested next to.
When they finally made their way back to Baker Street, after combing the scene within an inch of its life, John mentioned getting takeaway, and Sherlock nodded more out of habit than actual hunger. His mind was now focused on figuring out how Pierce had gotten away with murder while in police custody, or if it was true that he had an accomplice laughing at Sherlock’s idiocy.
Much to his relief, when he floated into the bedroom on his makeshift raft, Sherlock was sprawled out on the covers, grinning up at him, overtly proud of the game of chase they'd just played.
John allowed himself to be brought back into the bedroom, where they quickly realised the sheets were beyond anything that should be slept in. They worked in silence, swapping the soiled bedding for fresh, then John sat with his back against the headrest.
John wrenches Sherlock up to his lips and kisses him with the impact of a barrage of bullets. The ricochet absorbing all aspects of Sherlock’s body and soul and sex with John might be the most extraordinary activity that he has
Italy was wet and warm in ways that reminded John of hasty kisses on summer nights with the women he permitted to cross the threshold of 221b. The ladies were soft in the face and chests and moaned out his name. They also asked very few questions, and only expected a fun night and a hasty next morning.
Harry frowns as she takes back her mobile and zooms in on John and his mystery man. Then she makes a small noise in the back of her throat that John has never heard before. It sounds like something between a gasp of shock and the squeal of a sister who’s just learned a
He sighed and instantly relaxed as soon as Sherlock was against his tongue. The salty skin and the faint smell of soap from Sherlock’s shower that morning eased the tension from his shoulders. Soon John’s only thought, only job, was to feel Sherlock harden and lengthen against his tongue. Nothing else mattered, not the damned redacted information or the fact that both the military and government had let a wanted fugitive slip through the cracks and make her way back to London.
John all but threw the takeaway container overflowing with pancakes onto the table and stepped right into Sherlock's line of fire. He didn't raise his hands or show any fear. He just placed both hands on his hips and glared at Sherlock.
John nods in understanding, that soft look in his face there again, and Sherlock tries to pretend not to see it. Another topic is needed, but before Sherlock can think of one, John clears his throat.
Lestrade called out to the rest of the team, gathering their attention, as Sherlock headed back to the main road. He’d look more over the particulars of this case when the body was back at the lab. Right now, he just wanted to get back into real civilisation.
Sherlock felt his stomach give an unpleasant twist at Irene’s words. He deplored how right she was yet again.
“For someone who only came out a month ago,” I mutter into his ear, “you are surprisingly good at that.”
The woman was wearing a suit and trousers, expensive, but not ridiculously so — money to spend, but not vain enough to care about labels. No rings or jewellery below the wrists and she was wearing flat shoes; not a paper-pusher then. Judging by the apparent size of her pay packet, and the sensible choice in accessories, she was a doctor — a surgeon, if he had to guess.
"Do you want me to have Trent leave your yarn within reach?  Or can I get you to nap a bit?" John asked, though he already suspected that Sherlock had done enough sleeping for the day. And after Greg's warning that Sherlock would try to sneak out and get to the lab, the idea of him being tangled up in yarn wasn't so terrible. Anything to slow him down was a good thing at this point. "I can make tea if the milk won't kill us. I saw the contents of your fridge yesterday… you have quite the, erm, collection in there."
Then he hums, and I quiver. My eyes fly open to witness the vibrations of his throat ripple through me in all the right ways. It takes all the effort I possess to not grab at the bedsheets and rip them clean off the mattress.
“Fancy seeing you here,” she murmured, looking back down at her paperwork. “Lestrade is out on the Darby case if you were looking for him.”
How did he miss it? An accomplice. He should have seen it, should have known. Some of the victims must have been killed by this unknown person, and he should have been able to identify the different marks. Different people had different sized hands, he should have known, should have seen—
"He's really smarter than your other officers, isn't he? Should make him a detective, get him out of the labs a bit more often. Though, he'd hate dealing with people, wouldn't he?"
“Indeed, yes…” Sherlock admitted. He pulled off his Belstaff and placed it on the coat rack in the corner of the room before settling himself onto the long white sofa in Irene’s sitting room. “I find myself in a...questioning mindset for the past few weeks, with no end in sight, and I believe that your insight could be invaluable.”
Sherlock rounds on John and hisses. “I told you that I knew a competent tailor who could make adjustments for my wings by the end of the week.”
Sherlock wonders what else this woman can do, and has done. There is an air of mystery around her that he doesn’t like at all, nor the hint of resigned admiration in John’s recollection of her.
The tentativeness of his deduction feels wrong. This all feels wrong, and yet he had to hear the conclusion. If anything to put an end to the madness inside of his heart that keeps Sherlock awake even when his transport is near its breaking point.
“He lived nearby,” John gasped. “Then that leads us to only a few dozen people who lived in the nearby area.”
“Anything else then?” the older man prompted. The flicker of amusement just there in the creases of those laugh lines. “Grooming supplies? Socks...or...recreational products?”
“I get it, John. I do. When my wife left, I just wanted her around, in whatever way possible. Just, be careful, John. Sometimes it’s not that easy.”
As the hours pass and the sun begins to set, the two women find themselves curled together on the sofa, stealing kisses and feeding each other bites of sandwiches and slivers of cheese. The cats float in and out of the room, seeming to find that their two favourite humans on the planet being so close and snuggled up together is just what they all thought would happen eventually.
“Sherlock is an adult, as you seem to continuously forget. What we do is no one’s business but our own, and despite your needless concerns, we happen to be doing well this time around. So your meddling and threats are not welcomed, Mycroft.”
And, at least with clientele of the daytime variety, both John and myself are well paid for our efforts. Instead, the only one getting anything out of Twink # 7 or with Mr Leather chaps and sparkle vest, is Dr John H Watson. The former president of all things heterosexual is now fully swinging his sizable bat for both teams.
Sherlock spits out the last word with a venom that usually is reserved for his brother's name. John frowns but has no real idea as to where to go from here.
Sherlock turns back to the files, placing the mugshot to one side and rifling through another box. What he’s looking for, John has no idea. He could have sworn that Sherlock had memorised all these months ago.
“Fine...I am, but I can at least handle getting us some water,” John retorts, looking very proud of that fact. A few moments later, he is back holding two cups of water, their contents sloshing around as he hands one to Sherlock before slumping down in his chair and drinking fast.
A high pitched laugh ricocheted through the room. A laugh that was not assisting in Mycroft’s assessment that he might have come a bit too late to save anything left from the void of Sherlock Holmes. A younger brother whose icy stare and heated words still occupied both the crevices of the leather sofa and the chambers of a doctor’s soul.
“These people are not worth making excuses for. All that matters is remembering that they do not define you — you are an intelligent, remarkably funny,” she pauses as she twists the cork out of the champagne bottle with a
“Yes.” Sherlock replied, brushing his thumb over John’s and relishing the feel of the warm skin beneath his. They began walking again, their hands intertwined and their hearts open. As they walked, they discussed their boundaries and needs, trying to determine exactly what their relationship would be. As they moved idly home, something shifted between them, and a love Sherlock never thought he’d feel swelled in his heart.
John was out of the room before Sherlock could say anything else. Usually able to think so fast, his brain had stalled, unable to come up with an explanation that wouldn’t make John hate him. The room was cold, both with the evening breeze and John’s absence. Sherlock shivered, the quickly drying lube becoming uncomfortable, but he found himself paralysed with uncertainty. How had he let himself become so consumed by his insecurity, that he’d ignored what was right in front of him? He couldn’t,
Sherlock stayed quiet for a long time, as if processing all the new information he’d heard. Irene just watched him, not batting an eyelid when he closed his eyes and steepled his hands under his chin. In another time and place, perhaps they could have been friends. True friends, not whatever was going on here.
Sherlock undulated his hips in time to the up and down motions of his hand. His body quivered at how natural all of this was and how remarkably raw John's voice was when truly aroused. With a sultry hum, Sherlock dipped down to touch his forehead to John's. He yearned to document it all. The slight fluttering of John's closed eyelids. The sweet taste of his opened lips.
Sherlock wraps his arm around John’s waist, and it’s enough to pull John out from what is clearly the beginnings of a self-inflicted emotional breakdown. The other voices within the shop are suddenly louder as John’s tunnel vision clears to look over at Sherlock’s concerned expression.
Sherlock felt the splash of John's climax flood him to his core, and he was so close as well, but he wanted to try something that he only read about. He hoisted John's limp form up his arms, with a giggle at the small sound of confusion that left John's lips. Then with a swipe of the extra lubricant left on Sherlock's inner thigh, he placed a hand on John's left arsecheek, pushed a single index finger in John's entrance, and curved in just the right way to press against John's prostate.
Sherlock woke with a start. It took a moment for his brain to re-engage and realise what had woken him—a hand had wrapped its way around his waist. He stared at it for a moment, synaptic nerves firing at a hundred miles an hour, before he remembered the events of the night before. John, in his bed, squirming over the sheets as Sherlock ran his tongue along the rim of his arse, one hand grasped on the hard line of his cock. More memories for the John inhabited shelves of his mind palace.
"I sort of broke into NSY today. Proved to him just how easy it would be to get to him. I didn't drop my visitor pass in the toilets. I simply never had one in the first place. All I needed was his name, a nice suit, and a quick smile. Basic knowledge regarding his disgust towards Anderson helped as well."
Sherlock tried not to take the suggestion as an insult to his abilities, but it was hard to review the same facts repeatedly. It was as if his mind palace was reflecting mirrors in uncomfortable places, with each of the faces his own decorated with an expression of deep disappointment.
“Hardly, Dr Watson. You’re much worse. Cocaine never loved him back.” Mycroft gives him one last glance and slips out of the door, his umbrella clicking against the linoleum floor as he walks down the hallway.
John’s worried face swam into focus, and Sherlock blinked a few times. He was lying on the sofa with his head on John’s lap. The sensation of John’s strong fingers tenderly massaged their way through his curls, and the television droned on in the background.
The coffee hadn't even been poured into mugs before he erupted. The brimstone of John's words scorching Mary's skin and whatever else had the audacity to argue why anything should be taken out of
“I wasn’t with you yesterday.” Sherlock’s brow furrows as if trying to remember what he could have done wrong. Something pulls at John’s stomach, and he swallows the comprehension. Sherlock has never outwardly spoken about his past; the little information John has about pre Baker Street Sherlock has mostly been through off-hand comments from Lestrade or grandiose threats from Mycroft. However, there are times when John can read Sherlock’s past in his behaviour. Immediate assumptions that he’s the problem, or placing John’s needs or pleasures before his own. And, as much as Sherlock can be an arse sometimes, it makes John sick to think of all the ways others must have used him.
“I’m about done with all the sexual frustration I can handle for a lifetime,” I admit. “Do you have any idea how sexy you sound when you’re in your bedroom?”
Cabernet. Vintage, but Angelo refused to name the year. John had had three glasses of it, his smile and laughter growing brighter with every sip. Not drunk, but clearly headed that way. Was that needed? Wine for John to want to be this for Sherlock? To be in between his knees and relishing the feel of a cock in his mouth? No. John was within the bisexual spectrum. John hadn’t drunk anything more than day-old coffee before their first kiss. Completely sober. They both were. More data needed.
“I want—” John lunges forwards and pins Sherlock against the fireplace, grasping his wrists and sliding them above his head. His grip is gentle, weak enough for Sherlock to easily break free, but clearly indicating his desire. His mouth hovers centimetres away from Sherlock’s lips, giving him an out, a chance to safeword; to throw John off and remind him that they closed the door on this particular activity weeks ago. But, to his surprise, Sherlock leans forwards and closes the gap.
His gaze stayed steady on the gravel on the otherwise immaculate dark blue carpeting. His slender magnifying glass shook slightly as Lestrade took another step closer and bent over next to him. Sherlock already knew that the DI was glaring at him for not answering, but Sherlock barely cared.
His dark hair fell in thick ringlets that shimmered in the light, touches of auburn mixed in with the chocolate curls. John had felt its softness against the space between his jaw and throat as he carried Sherlock home and he couldn’t deny how wonderful it had felt. Slowly, he refocused his efforts and moved forward, lifting Sherlock’s head as he started to redo the head dressings. The omega’s mouth opened slightly in a soft whimper as John worked, but, other than the momentary flutter of Sherlock's long lashes, he remained still.
Not for the first time that night, he wonders whether he made the right decision. He still wants to be with Sherlock; he knows he does. A twinge of regret pulls at his stomach. Should he have suggested alternatives than just a complete breakup? Could they have made it work, if John was more open to compromise? No. No matter whether or not Sherlock knew the true depth of John’s feeling, this relationship was doomed to fail, even if John wished otherwise. Because between all the good times, the adrenaline fuelled chases across London, the lazy Sunday mornings, wrapped in sheets; were the moments when Sherlock would dismiss him without a care. John had lost count of the number of times he’d brought up a new interest, a television show he’d enjoyed, or a fun recipe he’d discovered, only to have Sherlock put him down. Say that John was wasting time with silly interests. In the end, John stopped sharing altogether.
“Of course. I think it’s time we pay him a visit, don’t you?” Sherlock reached out for his coat, draped over the lab bench, and stood, disentangling John’s fingers in the process. He pulled the coat on in one fail swoop and immediately pulled the collar up. They were close; he could feel it.
John steps back a little, and Sherlock closes his eyes. All of his concentration is on what John recently said to him in the cottage, and the whirl of sound and burst of dull pain right in between Sherlock’s shoulder blades lets him know that his wings have appeared again.
They don’t take things any farther that night, but when John leaves the next morning to call off his engagement, he comes back. John Watson returns to Baker Street, just as he was always supposed to. And this time, he stays.
“Sure it does,” Lestrade said through a smile, and Sherlock heard the sound of the DI clapping John on the shoulder. “So, you two…? I mean, that was one hell of a scene I walked in on.” There was a crash as a metal dish dropped to the floor, quickly followed by a stammered apology from Molly.
John laughed again. This time much less restrained. Warm and loving. The kind that Sherlock heard after long nights of crap telly with John on the sofa.
“Maybe this was a bad idea.” He says, craning his neck to find the exit. They should just get out of here, forget the whole endeavour and retreat to the safety of 221b. There, he knows exactly who he is, where he stands.
"I thought that I dreamt that," Sherlock whispered, taken aback. A shiver ran down his spine at John's words. His arms wrapped around John and held him tightly as he could.
“No need to do so,” Sherlock said with a dismissive wave of his hand. “There’s no murder here to solve.”
John cleans the dishes in a daze, Sherlock’s last words ringing in his ears. What did he want? Ideally, he wanted everything. He wanted things to be easy, to be allowed to have a partnership without jumping down each other’s throats all the time. But he couldn’t have that, the last six months proved that much.
"John," Sherlock's voice was as tremulous as he could make it, "I love you with my entire soul, but if you don't start fucking me within the next few minutes, I will sue you for cruel and unusual punishment. I know four solicitors who each owe me favours, and I am
“Excellent,” John says, looking and sounding much more like the Captain he was in the army. “Now, what I want you to do is pay close attention to me once I have transformed. I’m fairly small, so try to do your best to watch my wing movements.”
“To a very interesting night,” John chuckles, then throws a small smile Sherlock’s way before taking a very large swallow. Sherlock watches the amber liquid pass John’s lips, realising that this will be an interesting night indeed.
He rummages in his pockets for his wallet, and as he pulls it out to pay, a small box falls out with it. It clatters on the counter, and the cashier barely manages to catch it before it rolls off the other side.
"Stop frowning, or I'll have to make you forget why you're unhappy," John said smoothly, far too pleased with himself and his ability to not bring it up every twenty seconds. "With any luck, once we're back home, I can snog you so hard you forget you have a brother."
John isn’t sure how to absorb what Sherlock has revealed. The gesture is nearly too altruistic and at odds with what he has come to terms with the
With timing that was irritatingly precise, Sherlock’s mobile buzzed with an incoming call. Sherlock glanced at it, before sending it straight to voicemail.
“Sherlock, what was all that — are you smoking?” John stops in his tracks at the sight of the detective, half hanging out the window, a smoldering cigarette perched between his slender fingers. He’s already changed into his pyjamas and dressing gown and it’s wrong that even now, when John has no idea what’s about to happen next, how gorgeous Sherlock looks in his robe. Especially with the backdrop of London behind him in the window.
“And you don’t have to, Sherlock. Asexuality is a spectrum, not a category. Everyone’s different, and that’s okay. But you can want closeness and romantic intimacy without wanting sex. Asexuality and aromanticism are not intrinsically tied, perhaps you are more alloromantic that you previously thought.”
“Lestrade is on holiday with Molly,” Sherlock answered. “It’s most likely Mycroft. I pulled down the camera he’d hidden in the hallway yesterday.”
“Your confusion is understandable,” John continues, his palm now coming to rest on Sherlock’s upper left shoulder, very close to the beginning of the wing membrane. “They get the name from the way that humans used to mistake their large wings for the coat of the same name. Belstaffs are exceedingly rare and occur when a vampire takes the virginity of the human they turn.”
Molly asked the question so fast that Sherlock barely heard it, but she gave him the same look she usually reserved for particularly interesting corpses. Her dark brown eyes had an intensity that Sherlock, on any other day, would admire quite a lot.
Warmth is everywhere at once, and Sherlock can’t decipher if it’s coming from all of the alcohol of the evening, or John’s penetrating stare. The heat of it may melt him into the chair, creating a puddle of a former consulting detective.
"Whatever the hell your part in this is, I don't fucking care," John said. His voice almost as shattered as the remains throughout the room. "Sherlock's alive. He
“I’m fine.” Sherlock spits again, visibly recoiling from John. What had Anderson said to make him so worked up? “I have all I need here. Send me anything else you find that Anderson hasn’t ruined.” With that, he stalks off towards the road, hailing a cab as he walks.
“It’s the bisexual colours, yes…” Sherlock begins before lowering his voice so that only John can hear him. “But this...isn’t the type of belt one wears around their waist.”
Anderson huffs and stalks off, cursing inaudibly under his breath. Sherlock keeps tugging at his curls, red anger contorting his face into unrecognisable shapes. John’s stomach flips; he’s never seen Sherlock this angry before. Not even when he’d accidentally thrown out his three week long mould experiment.
Lestrade put up a hand to stop John from continuing to talk. His mouth was opening and closing, but no actual sounds were coming out.
The key didn’t actually unlock anything. It was just another part of the story. How could John have missed that? The real key had
John observes how the light in Sherlock’s bedroom turns different shades of blue as the night continues to creep across them. All the while, Sherlock lays beside him, occasionally pressing a kiss here or there. Their legs tangle around each other, and John is suddenly hit with how much he has missed these moments. No sex or case to keep them distracted. Only the sensation of being in each other’s arms.
It was like that with John. At least, up until the last hour. That John had accepted him regardless. His idiosyncrasies had been brilliant and extraordinary, yet it obviously wasn’t enough. He shivered at that, though he half excused it on the evening chill. The lights of the nearest club beckoned him with promises of warm drinks and faded memories. He strode towards it with a stiff nod to the couple of people he passed along the way.
“It’s off putting,” John starts, his eyes laser-focused on the last dregs of his pint. “How you make everything you do look so effortless, so...fluid. Can’t take my bloody eyes off of— “
John stares back, not believing much of what Sherlock just said. This is a reasonable reaction, but still, Sherlock huffs an indignant breath. He holds his hand out and John gives him the stack of papers. He’d intended to give John time to read them over, to build a sense of anticipation over the plans he had for the night, but it’s too late now. They’ll just have to take things as they come.
Sherlock wasn’t used to being blindsided. It was part of what came with being a detective. He was built for connecting minuscule clues into insurmountable evidence, so when he came to the conclusion that John’s scent was drawing him even closer to the ex-army soldier, Sherlock physically had to sit down. Breathe in and out until the world became slightly less hazy, and figure out how to compartmentalise the new information.
John moved both hands to Sherlock's arse. Grabbing two perfect handfuls of pert flesh. He kept one hand there, cupping one cheek while the other glided up the line of Sherlock's back. Sherlock was incredibly receptive to every touch. Skin and muscles rippled below his hands or arched into his touch where it was too light for his liking.
CW if you have emetophobia for this chapter. Nothing actually happens, there are just some descriptions towards the end
“Similar location and manner of death,” Greg confirms. “Except this bloke got in a few hits before he was strangled. Defense wounds on the palms of his hands. Molly should be able to verify, but always good to get Sherlock in before we move the body. Stops him from screaming at us later on.”
John met Seb's eyes and nodded once. Together they both let go of Sherlock's arms, and John lifted his weight from Sherlock's legs, though he remained in place in case anything went pear-shaped.
“Why did you change your mind?” John asked. His voice was barely there this time. “What did he do or say to make you want to help?”
“I’ve tried to give you space and the time that you've needed,” Mycroft snapped. "Been tolerant of your vices and overlooked your sexual proclivities."
Propping himself up on one elbow, he met Sherlock's eyes, and in a husky voice, said, "Now fuck me like you mean it."
Sherlock turned a couple of corners until he found himself on Wardour Street. It was busy, usual for a Friday night, the clubs and pubs spilling out onto the pavement with their assortment of colourful patrons. The windows above were dressed with flags; bright reds, oranges, pinks and blues standing proud against the brickwork. He wasn’t the loud type — he’d never been to a pride parade or waved the rainbow flag, but every so often it was a solace to remind himself that this place existed. That deep in the heart of London, there was a haven just for people like him.
"About us like this," Sherlock responds, and he interweaves the fingers of his free hand into John's. "My head feels less noisy when we kiss...goes completely quiet when we do more. But you're aware of those facts."
“It’s exhausting sometimes," Sherlock continues. "I can deduce when something’s wrong, but I can’t read your mind. You actually have to talk to me sometimes.”
People around Sherlock clap and whoop at his insanity, but Sherlock barely cares. His eyes are on John, who is watching his every move with an expression Sherlock has only seen when John is about to call him brilliant or tell him that he is amazing. John’s gaze falls towards Sherlock’s footwork before lifting upwards to his calves and legs, then perhaps other places on the lower half of his body. Sherlock only can guess while in full motion. Or rather, can only hope.
This tit for tat was getting John nowhere, and both of the people in this overpriced sex den knew it. He sensed that he was running out of time, even though technically there had never been a ticking bomb. On his chest or otherwise.
“Yes, licking it is definitely on the agenda. I’m sure you won’t mind. Might even save you a shower, if I use enough saliva. For better scientific results I might have to cover the scar in various substances, too. The internet suggests cream, ice-cream, honey or nutella, so it might be beneficial for the sake of the study to try those first before moving on to other substances such as marmite. I will also make a cast of it in latex and check whether it glows under UV-light.”
Until he met James. James with whom he struck up an immediate friendship very similar to what he has with Sherlock now – and yet completely different. James was .... difficult, although most people would say this of Sherlock as well. In some ways, they are alike. James was very focused on his career. Driven, in both good and bad ways. Often, John didn’t know how to read him. He would be openly affectionate, buoyant and exuberant one day, cold and remote the next. Combine that with John’s reluctance to let anything of his bisexual inclinations show publicly, and James being very careful concerning his public image, too, no wonder they never really managed to work things out between them.
They don’t talk again until they’ve reached their room. John smiles when he sees the lion toy on Sherlock’s pillow, next to a bag containing a collection of yellow jerseys sporting the team logos. Sherlock only rolls his eyes again, but looks pleased all the same, stepping over to his bed and picking up the lion.
To reassure him, John shook his head and laughed. “Of course I want to come, you idiot. Not just to make dad’s big dream come true, but also to see if I can do it at my age.”
“I can still hear you, Victor,” admonishes Sherlock. “And I’d prefer if you could just shut up for a bit and let me think.”
Sherlock shrugs. “This is my second – and last – Tour de France. If I was going to ride, I wanted to ride as best as I possibly could. I came fourth last time, so ...” He shrugs and takes another bite from his lemon tart.
John laughs. “Indeed. Not that I was asking for all the extra excitement, but I can’t say I dislike it. So things are always this dangerous round you?”
He sees Hope bite down on his capsule, then swallow, and even opening his mouth to prove the pill is gone. Sherlock’s mouth fills with saliva. What remains of the pill tastes bitter now. His tongue is turning numb. He feels his heartbeat accelerate as he stares at Hope who shrugs, looking completely unaffected by what he just swallowed.
If Sherlock was expecting something to happen to shake up the peloton, he is proven right. Having just passed through the historic centre of the city of Périgueux with its famous, cupola-studded cathedral not far from the river Isle, and following the climbing road towards the outskirts, the large group of riders is split by one of many roundabouts. Normally, both branches of the peloton flow together seamlessly afterwards in a routine move. Not this time, though.
Victor kicks at a loose stone. “Not in this sport,” he returns fiercely, sounding angry of a sudden. “Not when your career has just taken off. Not when you have so much to lose. Sherlock ... he was so unconcerned when it came to these things. A bit naïve, even. It was refreshing and vexing at the same time, but ultimately, I couldn’t deal with it. Add to that the fact that he was entirely out of his depth, not just with emotional stuff but even more when it came to the physical things. No wonder it ended the way it did.”
“Yes. You’re the most fascinating conundrum I’ve ever encountered. It would take a lifetime to even attempt to understand, and more than one to ‘solve’ you.”
“You always catch the things I’m tossing at you,” said John, still awed by this unique failure. “Most times you don’t even look up. You just catch. Lightning reactions.”
Had John known beforehand how the fifth stage of the 2018 Tour de France would unfold, he might have thought twice about signing in at the start. Two other riders don’t, one due to injuries received during the previous stage, and one because of an infected insect bite and subsequent allergic reaction. Team Speedy’s is still complete, with several riders literally chomping at the bit, eager for winning this varied, unpredictable stage. Everybody expects attacks, both on the flats and particularly on the many climbs. Fears are also high for crashes. The roads in the remote, forested, wind-swept hills of the Morvan are narrow and often rough, the asphalt withered and marked with potholes, bothersome on the ascents and dangerous on the descents. Luckily, the weather is forecast to remain dry, and even though temperatures are again above thirty Celsius at the noon start in the small town of Chablis, long passages of the route are leading through woodland and over hills between seven- and nine-hundred metres in height, meaning less oppressive heat during the latter parts of the stage.
John drew a breath and lifted his shoulders in a shrug. “Guess so. Mine did, and even though I didn’t see eye to eye with them on a couple of things, particularly when Harry and I were teenagers, I had a good childhood. A happy one.”
“Come on, Sherlock, what?” John demanded, and gave an exasperated huff when Sherlock only shook his head, his grin broadening.
thinks Sherlock, reaching for the mug. “Thank you, and no problem.” He takes a sip. It’s still too sweet, but the sugar is welcome. He really needs to eat more and more regularly. And a touch of milk would be good, too. Black coffee isn’t what it used to be for him. How living with John has mellowed him.
The return journey back into London was quiet. Lestrade dropped them off at Baker Street and thanked them. “I’ll keep you in the loop, okay? Thanks, you two. Oh, and Sherlock, be nice to Dimmock, yeah? The poor chap is this close to a mental breakdown.”
Sherlock draws a deep, shuddering breath, swallows twice, then draws back his shoulders and sits up straight. “Yes, fine. I’m fine.”
Sherlock drew back a little, his face still very close to John’s. “I have a mind of simply ignoring him,” he muttered breathlessly.
John’s eyebrows draw together in a frown. “That can’t be very ... satisfying, can it? Can be unhealthy, too, if you do it all the time.”
John gazes from Sherlock towards the living room and back at Sherlock, frowning. “Case?” he ventures.
Drawing a deep breath, “In Iceland, they have special people who deal with Faerie issues,” he offers.
Sherlock inclines his head. “Yes. The situation was a little more complicated than that, as D.I. Lestrade has just explained, but as a summary, the description suffices.”
Daniel and the neighbour boys giggle. “Off into the toilet with you,” says the larger one and deals Sherlock a hard shove that would have sent him to the ground but for the others holding on to him. Together, they drag him down the corridor.
They fall silent at this announcement, both no doubt thinking about the possibility of John still being at Bletchley then. The chance is slim, and they both know it. Sherlock squeezes John’s hand, while John buries his head between his shoulder blades and lies there breathing deeply. Neither of them speaks again, each lost in his own thoughts. Sherlock feels John drift off behind him, while he also battles the call of sleep until at length, lulled by John’s soft, even breaths, the warmth of the body behind him and the delicious heaviness of his limbs, he surrenders.
John watches him as he sits in the back of the team bus with his head leaned back and his eyes closed, headphones over his ears. He hasn’t changed into the tight time trial suit yet, is still wearing loose jogging bottoms and a t-shirt – one of John’s in fact, which touches John and makes him smile. Although tempted to head over and chat, he decides to leave Sherlock in peace. Sherlock has got several hours to while away still – his start time being 16:08 –, and if he can use them to get some more sleep, the better, although John is certain he’s too pumped up and focused to sleep right now and probably analysing the route repeatedly in his mind palace.
He glances at Sherlock and smiles sheepishly. “And then I get shot and almost drown – again– and am sent to bloody Bletchley.”
Stealing at glance at John at his side as he stands and gazes over the South Downs, a smile on his face and the wind ruffling his hair, Sherlock tries to imagine him in forty years’ time. He will be stooped and grey, wearing glasses and perhaps a hearing aid. Most probably he’ll use a walking stick again, or even a walking aid. His shoulder will be stiff and often pain him, and his back will be bent. But his eyes will still be of the same dark, brilliant blue like the butterflies on the Downs, and he will be wearing a lambswool jumper against the cold. And he will tell Sherlock that it was a bloody ridiculous idea to hike up here because they’re both getting on – and yes, Sherlock, you, too, better believe it – but he’ll also smile fondly at his partner – yes, partner – of the past forty years, and indulge his whims as always.
Sherlock ducks his head to hide his blush. “Well, all right, then. Molly and Brenda are hunting for cake at the canteen and have saved a table for us.”
“Try as they might, they just don’t get those baguettes right elsewhere in the world,” John stated happily after swallowing the first bite.
“Yeah, exactly that” returns Lestrade seriously. “As I said before, I’d rather not have the place burn down tonight, or be the setting for another fight. One never knows with two idiots like you and your reckless ways. They run continuous performances, starting in the early afternoon, but apparently Irene Adler is not expected to come on stage before eight. Will you be needing a lift to the station?”
The farmer with the motorcycle courier billeted at his place takes a swig from his ale and frowns at Sherlock. “You’re one of them government boffins, then, as are holed up at Ivy Farm? Never seen you around here.”
John thanked her again, and Sherlock grunted something that sounded vaguely appreciative, his nose in a large book. Katie gave them a tired smile and left. John divested himself of rucksack and jacket, then switched off the ceiling illumination. The room looked less cluttered like that, but cozy and somewhat mysterious since many of the curious occupants of the shelves and boxes could only partly be descried in the small, warm light from the desk lamp. No wonder Sherlock was entirely distracted by all the things, having put back the book only to wander around a little and picking up another.
Sherlock lifts his shoulders in a shrug. “It can only go two ways: either, my legs will be more tired than usual due to said ... exercise. Or the high dose of hormones no doubt still active in my bloodstream – not so much from the sex but from the general condition of being in love – will push my performance into new heights.”
Waking early the next morning, Sherlock hurries in the bathroom and then creeps downstairs. Aunt Mabel is already up and preparing breakfast. Next to the table, a heap of presents are waiting for Daniel. Sherlock adds the one his parents have left with him. It’s a book and some kind of box that rattles when shaken. Sherlock surmises that it might be a repair kit for bicycles. Well, Daniel certainly needs one, as often as his bike gets damaged. Sadly, Sherlock’s parents seem to have overlooked to present him with some brains to actually operate the kit, Sherlock thinks scornfully. But who needs brains and skills when one’s parents do everything for them?
Sherlock is approached by reporters – with Magnussen out, he has advanced to fifth place overall now, behind Moriarty, Baskerville, Ricoletti and Wilkes. The top ten of the general classification are not expected to change during today’s and tomorrow’s stages with all the contenders saving their energy for the second individual time trial on Saturday, the penultimate stage.
“Wassa matter?” rumbles a deep, scratchy voice from the vicinity of John’s shoulder. John turns to Sherlock, quickly kisses his hair, and holds the phone so that he can read the messages once he has lifted his face from John’s t-shirt and opened his eyes. He looks delicious rumpled and actually a bit slow, his brain apparently not quite having booted yet.
Sherlock’s eyebrows arch. He looks somewhat amused. “Didn’t you read the papers about what happened with Janine?”
Sherlock smiles and returns the kiss. “Merry Christmas, John. Let this be the first of many holidays we spend together.”
Sherlock exchanges a quick glance with John who fights down a grin. “Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective. I was asked by Detective Inspector Lestrade over there to investigate these ‘serial suicides’,” explains Sherlock, “and found out that all of the previous victims had ridden cabs to their final destination. It was just a question of finding the right cabbie.”
To John’s surprise Katie drew herself up slightly and looked Sherlock right in the eye. “Well, then, let’s hear it,” she challenged him, looking more amused than worried. John hoped she wasn’t going to experience a nasty surprise.
Sherlock returns the phone to his pocket, rubs his hands to warm his fingers, and tries to whistle again. He calls out for John, too, but again receives no answer. Worry gnaws at him. Is John okay? The sound of the rolling stone ... he hasn’t fallen down on the crags, has he? He’d be looking for Sherlock by now, wouldn’t he? Unless ...
“Nonsense, Mrs. H.,” Sherlock says. “We’ll be fine. You can take over from John when you’re back and I’ve overtaxed his patience with my constant complaining,” he adds with a wink. “You’ll be refreshed after your time off, and ready for tenant-sitting duty.”
Tom pulls off the key from the inside of the bathroom door and grins wickedly. “We should just lock him here,” he suggests. “That way, he can piss and shit as much as he likes. And he can eat toothpaste if he’s hungry. After all, we’re no monsters.”
wants. And only once he is clear, he can consider how to woo Sherlock, if that is what his introspection turns up as a desirable pursuit.
“The scratches on your hand and the twig in your hood tells me you tried that privet hedge over there first, but found that a fence runs in its middle. You then skirted the hedge, found the path between the pool and the tennis courts – red ash on your shoes that spilled over onto the track when the courts’ surface was renewed recently – and scuff marks on your shoes’ tips from where you scaled the wall. A bit of bird shit on the inner seam of your trousers when you straddled it before jumping down.”
“What would you like to drink? Tea and coffee making facilities are in the room, of course, and water, too.”
and spare himself the potential fallout, or lying still and indulging, soaking up every little detail about the weight and feel of John’s arm, the soft flexing of his fingers where they rest loosely but almost possessively over Sherlock’s ribs, about his scent, the tickle of his hair, and the feeling of being held and loved.
“You were rather pointedly glancing at that woman’s umbrella in the luggage rack,” explained his friend. “Wasn’t a big leap.”
“No, you didn’t. Remember what I told you yesterday: you set the pace. And I’m content to follow, as usual.”
John runs a hand through his hair. “Thanks, Molly, for looking after him. You’re right. Things are ... tense between us. I said some things I shouldn’t have said, and then texted some others which might have caused his current state of ... whatever.”
“We won’t. We’ll only ride back to the bunker. The children should be there by now, hopefully with a car.”
“You’re not a professional cyclist, and I forbid you to crash tomorrow. I know the true reason for this.” John pointed at the stretch of smooth, pale skin.
“Well, the Nazis are using questionable science to bolster their claim for superiority,” offers Sherlock. “And don’t believe for an instant that the Germans are the only ones capable of that, or have even invented it. Look at the Americans and how they treated – and still treat – their native population, or even closer to home, regard British colonial efforts abroad.”
“Suicide?” asks Sherlock. Suddenly, Virginia Woolf has become a lot more interesting. Now he remembers why her name sounded vaguely familiar. He must have read about her demise in the papers. “How did she die?”
Sherlock casts a quick glance over his shoulder. The commander is standing with his back to him, his hands in the pockets of his trousers, the sunlight glinting on the gold braid on his sleeves.
“Granted,” Wilcox says from the direction of the door, which now he pushes open completely to reveal him. Her eyes widen when they fall on him, for a moment she seems tempted to turn and run, but then she relaxes again with a sigh and a soft curse.
“Mr. Prime Minister, it’s not for myself, but for a dear friend of mine who sadly cannot be with us anymore. It’s for Jennifer Wilson.”
“I haven’t really undertaken any dangerous experiments since you and Rosie have become regulars at Baker Street again.”
Sherlock sighs, as though he finds it tedious having to explain himself. “I know why people have sex. I’m not an idiot. In fact, I’ve studied it. Quite extensively. The knowledge has been necessary for the work, as sex and issues associated with it are so often motives for crime. No, that’s not the problem.”
“Yes. Could I use your electric razor? You’re right, I shouldn’t attempt shaving with my blade and my left hand.”
Not knowing whether the invitation was going to be welcome, John decided to risk it anyway. “You can join me, you know. Get some sleep and look for a case tomorrow.”
“And you believe the three men you encountered today were involved in these poisonings?” Havers wanted to know of the girls.
“Quite, yes. Seems you got the gist.” Sherlock was smiling as well, suddenly shy and struggling to hide it.
“Pretty much, yes. I don’t think I’ve had a decent Christmas ever since I was nine. Last year was the worst.”
“Not deleted but rather wilfully ignored most of my life,” admits Sherlock. “I wouldn’t have opened the envelope without your permission. I just wanted to know whether you had looked inside.” He doesn’t tell John about his increasing worry about John’s mental wellbeing, hoping that somehow, John would interpret his actions correctly.
“No, I wasn’t,” replied Sherlock in a clipped voice, colour rising to his cheeks. He tried to look haughty and unaffected and failed. “Although I begin to believe that I should have, given your reaction. I take it the offer was a bit not good?” he then asked, obviously trying to hide both his insecurity and his mounting embarrassment. John didn’t know whether it was wishful thinking on his part, but a trace of disappointment seemed to be swinging in Sherlock’s mood, too.
“What an astute observation.” He empties the glass with a long draught, and frowns when a drop lands on his chest. He lifts his hand to wipe it away, but John is quicker, diving down and licking it off. Sherlock groans. He needs to establish some dominance here, or else this is going to be another embarrassingly brief affair.
Ten minutes later, arrayed in a fresh shirt under his waistcoat, the collar of his suit jacket free of blood-stains once again, Sherlock steps out of his bedroom to see that John has cleared away a space on the kitchen table large enough for two teacups, with Petri dishes for saucers. He is pouring tea from the old chipped teapot Sherlock hopes he has rinsed thoroughly beforehand. John has unearthed some teaspoons, too, and the tin with milk powder.
“Lovers’ quarrel, likely,” opines Constable Grant somewhat dismissively. “Had a bit of a tiff with her beau in the car, maybe he broke it up. Girl is stressed and unstable anyway so she escapes to a lonely place and ends it. Seriously, Mr. Lestrade, I don’t think we need to worry too much about this case.”
“I doubt even he’d be that stupid,” puts in Sherlock. He recalls his previous encounter with Moran. “Then again …”
“Bullshit, Sherlock. She may be old and pretending to be a bit confused, but her mind’s still sharp. And there’s something she knows about what happened here in the past, something that concerns you, something that troubles you to this very day. Ever since we took this case, you’ve been strange. You were reluctant to take it out of consideration for me, but lost child or no, I seem to be coping better than you here. Whatever happened here when you were a boy? I can tell that it’s still weighing on your mind.”
“Likely, yes, but we should be able to do that in London, or over the phone. They’ve already taken down the most important facts, and I am confident that they are capable of dealing with the paperwork. They haven’t been entirely dilettante handling these cases. For country officers, they’re rather efficient.”
For once, John doesn’t complain about busy roads and idiot drivers as he makes his way down to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. Concentrating on surviving the London traffic at morning rush hour leaves few mental capacities to dedicate to the haunting vision of Sherlock strapped to a stretcher in the back of an ambulance. That particular image has been branded into John’s brain the night Sherlock was shot, with lurid details added a few days later after he’d escaped from hospital, pulled the stunt at Leinster Gardens, and collapsed at 221B with his heart about to give out (again). Again. How many times has Sherlock’s heart actually stopped beating now? Two? Three?
Lestrade and several armed officers are streaming through the behind Sherlock, while others led by Donovan are approaching from the direction of the living room. Lestrade halts them with a raised hand. “Sherlock, what the hell is going on?”
to talk to Sherlock. She’s been out of sorts since yesterday. Let’s leave them to it.” At this, she deftly takes the bicycle out of John’s hands to deposit it against a nearby tree, to then thread her arm through his, with Jeannine doing so on his other side, and gently manhandling him towards the canteen.
Despite constantly looking out for signs of John’s possible departure, Sherlock misses all of them until the dreaded day actually comes. He attributes this oversight to his state of happiness, and his refusal to let what John and he have terminate. It’s early Saturday evening in late November when he returns from an eight to four shift to find Mrs. Hudson in the kitchen preparing dinner. Her expression falls when she sees him, even though she tries to hide it. The meal looks particularly splendid
John doesn’t hear his reply because they push the door to behind them. Did they shut it properly? Could he still get in?
John stares at him, not quite knowing what to reply. He decides to help both of them by dissolving the awkwardness of the situation with humour. “Well-proportioned, eh? Interesting of you to say that after you’ve seen me naked in the shower.”
He gazes up at Sherlock, clears his throat. His voice is hoarse, though, when he says, “Sorry for waking you. I had another nightmare. Not pleasant at all. Sorry. The walls are really thin, aren’t they?” He looks as awkward and embarrassed as Sherlock feels. He shrugs. “Sorry.”
John shook his head in disbelief. He still hadn’t managed to once more get used to the feeling of being constantly overwhelmed by his consulting detective’s sudden whims.
“No. Somewhat inconvenient, yes, but it isn’t to be helped. Don’t wait up, John. Remember to call your friend Sholto. He wanted to talk to you. Seemed important.”
Which … well … is true. Sherlock has been examined before, in hospital during his illness and by Mike Stamford after his release, and before during his army physical. Yet those were impersonal, medical exams. He endured them and was glad when they were over. Other touches he always discouraged, in the few cases they were offered. And now … how is this going to end? He must learn to control his bodily reactions to John, lest he betray himself and cause awkwardness for all involved. Surely, John doesn’t want to know how Sherlock is pining after him. It would make him feel guilty or downright appalled. Sherlock couldn’t bear either. Keep calm and carry on. Isn’t that what the propaganda poster he remembers seeing in a shop window in Bletchley was suggesting? Well, then.
He shifts so that he is lying next to John and kisses him again. “All in good time,” he tells John as he begins to unbutton the front of his pyjamas, to then run his hand down John’s chest and abdomen, cataloguing the new scars there and not liking the way he can feel John’s ribs more clearly. The man needs feeding up. Sherlock will make sure to nick some extra rations from his parents who no doubt are well provisioned with food, given Mycroft’s influence and their rural surroundings and connections.
“Why is it virtually impossible for you and your underlings to run an investigation in a way that is both efficient and fast?” Sherlock wanted to know, spinning round to face Dimmock with a thunderous expression, the tails of his coat flying. “It’s easy enough to trace the trajectory of the bullet, and yet none of your minions managed to secure the area. They didn’t even search the right place. Now of course what evidence the shooter may have left behind has been destroyed. The area should have been cordoned off right away.”
“Yes, but she was dead, too. No happy ending there. Although dying of hypothermia is supposed to be relatively easy and free of pain.” He passed his fingers over the candle flame, causing it to shiver. “I used to wonder about it, during the winter I was away.”
“Well, if we assume she was a tourist, there are plenty of sights along the river,” said John. “The bridges, St. Paul’s, even the Tower if she went that far.”
Sherlock grumbled something, before he extracted himself from John’s embrace to stalk off into the bathroom. John heard him blow his nose rather noisily and use the toilet. After he had washed his hands and face, he returned to the bedroom and stood next to the bed, looking down at John uncertainly. He looked rather a mess, his face pale and blotchy, his eyes reddened from crying. “Will you stay here tonight?” he asked, with a hint of insecurity.
“Molly knows that before the war, I worked in London as a consultant to Scotland Yard and have some experience with matters of this kind. But frankly, I don’t think she knew where else to turn in her distress,” he then admits.
Sherlock watches him straighten his jacket and approach Molly. She looks surprised when she recognises him, then blushes when apparently he asks her to dance with him. They are too far away for Sherlock to understand what they are talking about, but Molly looks pleased. She looks up searchingly until her eyes land on Sherlock, and she flashes him a quick smile. He inclines his head.
Sherlock nods. “I have an inkling it has to do with Moran and The Woman’s continued association with him. After all, she was driving his car that night.”
Aware of Sherlock’s alert, slightly concerned gaze, he jerked his head, continuing to talk, “Since I’m not a complete moron all of the time, I can tell that Victor’s involvement with this girl rankled you, most likely because you’d gotten used to his exclusive companionship and suddenly he wasn’t around any longer.”
“It’s one thing to be called to this place in the middle of a private viewing of the latest Hepworths, but then to be kept waiting here like the meanest criminal ... It really is an outrage. Who is your commanding officer, sergeant? Who is in charge here?” Her voice is imperious, the enunciation sharp and so definitely upper class that it almost sounds like a parody, like that lady Mycroft impersonated with such great success in an Oscar Wilde play back at school during his final year. Paired with her appearance and her general panache, however, it comes across as genuine. Sherlock has a brief vision of his paternal grandmother on the Holmes side of his family who only wore black as long as he knew her, and regarded all children (and indeed all people) a frightful nuisance. She was also frightfully good at chess. This woman reminds him of her.
“All evidence suggests that, yes. Sherlock managed to put him off his scent after the somewhat turbulent events at Monaco. He lay low in Germany for a while, investigating the hacker-ring at Frankfurt which lead to him getting caught once again.”
“After he overtook me, you mean, after having started eight minutes after me. Cheers, mates. Quiet now, there’s Sherlock.”
“I’ve almost reached you, mate,” comes Sam Carter’s voice from the third car. “Had a hard time getting past the
The underground journey in the funicular, even though it covers about one thousand metres of altitude, passes quickly. Stepping out of the station into a winter-wonderland of brightly lit snow busy with skiers, John is glad about both his new jacket and his sunglasses as they stand surveying the ski-station with its wide sun-terrace studded with wooden furniture, the glacier with its lifts, and the rocky, snow-capped peaks surrounding them. It feels odd to be up here where a cold breeze is blowing and people all around them are dresses for the depths of winter, when three thousand metres below them in the valleys’ temperatures are nearing forty degrees.
Sherlock’s eyes light up. “Yes. Oh yes. Brilliant, John. That’s it. That’s why she seemed so familiar. We need our mechanics to confirm it, but you could be right.”
Quickly stowing the map away, they mounted again. As they wound their way through the heather and bracken, the rain increased. Driven on by a strong wind, the drops seemed to find their way into every uncovered nook. John put up the collar of his jacket against it and huddled into the garment, glad about his riding helmet which at least kept his hair mostly dry. The horses didn’t seem to mind, however, their dense, shaggy coats protecting them.
A thought strikes John as cautiously, they leave the room and head towards the stairs. “Won’t it be cold up there at the glacier? It’s at over three thousand metres, and even though these jerseys and the stuff I’m wearing underneath are warmer than our usual cycling gear, I don’t think they’d be enough for that altitude, especially if we’d going to have to sit around there for a bit waiting for Wiggins.”
He doesn’t wait for the policeman to reply but hangs up. A glance at his watch shows him that it’s indeed almost ten. Mycroft will be getting ready to leave to make it in time for his 10:45 appointment at Buckingham Palace that he’s written down meticulously in the small notebook on his desk. Sherlock smiles.
“Yes. Quite. In the ...,” Sherlock swallows. He feels hot and cold at once, his hands are sweating, “the chemical department. When you are concerned.”
The policemen nodded. Farnham had thoughtfully taken out a small notebook and was writing down Sherlock’s instructions. “What I don’t understand,” said Havers slowly, gazing around the bunker once again, “is how the thing with the kids and the stolen foal fits into all this. Was it a mere coincidence that you happened upon the trespassers, or is there a link between the abducted foal, the dead horses and the three men?”
“You said you’d respect if I didn’t want to talk about it as long as I didn’t do anything stupid,” Sherlock said petulantly.
He licks again, before closing his lips over the head and sucking gently. “Fuck, Sherlock,” pants John. One of his hands appears in Sherlock’s hair, the fingers sending even more hot spikes of arousal through Sherlock’s body and derailing his focus and concentration. No, this isn’t going to take long, for either of them.
. Of course, work was tedious and uncomfortable even then, but one hadn’t been tempted to gaze longingly out of the window at the green expanse of the lawn and lake and the tall trees of Bletchley Park. The view had been grey and dreary, or, depending on one’s shift, dark. Sherlock actually prefers the night shifts, because with his mind constantly demanding distraction and so preventing him from falling asleep most nights, at least at work it’s occupied, and effectively, too.
John frowns, trying to remember what he did at breakfast to get him in such an obvious good mood. “I simply sat and chatted with my teammates,” he says.
“I’ll be careful,” promised John. “There are plenty of people looking out for us. Your brother and his folks, and Lestrade, and didn’t you tell your homeless network to watch out for the bloke when we first received his photo from the Woman? We’ll be warned. And if he’s really got it in for you, or me, or anybody close to us, well, he’d better wrap up warm. I happen to like tigers, and I don’t take kindly to arseholes who shoot them for sport. Them or other endangered species. Especially consulting detectives, of whom I have on good authority there’s only one left in the world.”
“Do you think there’s something wrong with me?” he asks his brother. “All the other children seem to think so. They call me names.”
“Cost several grand a pair,” puts in the man. “They’re from this year’s Spring/Summer collection. Limited edition. Could only get them through connections, but not buy them in the shops. And then they break them and throw them away. Rich people, eh? Don’t look after their stuff.”
“Damn, I thought we managed to hold on to that,” whispers John to Sherlock as they place themselves unobtrusively behind another team-car, the bicycles fastened to its roof providing some cover from the Team Brook Consulting riders and the journalists milling about. Sherlock shushes him impatiently.
“You ...,” he begins, his voice rough. He clears his throat. “You want all this because you ... like me?”
Sherlock drew himself up before subsiding slightly again. He looked thoughtful, and it seemed to John that he was considering his reply carefully – as of course he would, to make sure he wasn’t going to reveal too much information about his inner workings.
now. Meaning if all goes well on the final stretch, we’ll have a fifty-fifty chance of a stage win today. Brilliant work, boys. I’ll keep you informed how things turn out. Kit, keep a cool head now, okay. It’s still a bit of a ride to the finish, and Camenzind is a decent and experienced sprinter.”
“Good, and about time. I could tell you were unhappy and frustrated even before James’ accident, and assumed that either things weren’t going well with him, or that the fact that he kept your involvement under wraps and you at arm’s length bothered you.”
Sherlock turns, glad for the distraction (mainly from his bewildering, unsettling feelings towards the doctor). “Any news? Has the coroner finished his report?” he asks in a low voice, beckoning to Lestrade to follow him into a corner near the bar area where they can talk in relative obscurity while still keeping an eye on the goings on in the hall.
“Which was only polite and wouldn’t have done you any harm, either. Moreover, what are you complaining about? The two ladies were nice, but that’s it. Fit and good looking, yes, from an objective point of view. And they had good bikes. But I’ve been having the pleasure of staring at your legs and arse for the past half hour. I certainly won’t be needing any more visual highlights today.”
The man’s face splits into a gap-toothed smile. “Mr. ’olmes, always a pleasure,” he announces in his practised Cockney – Sherlock knows that originally, Billy hails from Kent. “I ’eard you were in town.”
“The hell I will,” growls Seb, having obviously recovered from his shock. With an angry, forceful gesture, he starts the engine. Ramming it into gear, he accelerates so abruptly that Sherlock has to jump backwards so as not to be hit by the car as it speeds off along the road. Cursing under his breath at his own stupidity
The cameras show Trevor adjust his helmet, resplendent in the world champion’s ‘rainbow jersey’, a white outfit with five horizontal stripes in the colours of the Olympic rings. He looks very calm and collected for somebody who certainly has something at stake in this prologue. A tug on the zipper of his overshoe, a touch to his chest where some good luck charm appears to be hidden – he is experienced enough to not let his nerves get the better of him. And yet ... looking at him, John wonders how superstitious he is, whether he believes in the curse of the rainbow jersey that constitutes that the reigning world champion has a bad year after his big win. Whatever goes on in Trevor’s head, however, he doesn’t let it show. One last little adjustment to his seating, the signal sounds, and he is off. And he’s fast.
Sherlock set the newspapers down and fully turned to John. “I’d appreciate that,” he stated seriously.
John looks at him for a long time. “Always?” he then asks. His voice is gentle and almost cautious as if talking to a frightened animal.
John leans closer to him and briefly rests his head on his shoulder. Sherlock feels his heart miss a beat as warmth floods his body. These unexpected displays of affection still catch him by surprise every time. He snakes an arm round John’s hunched shoulders and draws him close, dropping a kiss on his hair.
to split the group up further. Moriarty and his men are riding along but not attacking – yet. They are on their toes, though, ready to thwart attacks that could cost Moriarty his yellow jersey.
“Don’t even think about it.” John half turns so that he can gaze at Sherlock over his shoulder. Sherlock is grinning. His face is flushed, and he looks ridiculous with his wet hair lank and reaching almost into his eyes. “Are you okay with this, though?” asks John. “Are we going too fast? Would you like me to do something for you? This is marvellous, but it feels rather one-sided.”
At the foot of the next ascent, this time a short climb up to the small town of Château-Chinon, Wilkes’ train has reached the last stragglers of the main field, mostly sprinters or tired
John snorted, dropping his arm to pinch Sherlock’s side playfully and grinning at the sharp intake of breath and undignified wriggle of the other. “Oi, was that a not so subtle hint that I should move myself into the kitchen and put the kettle on?”
John stares at it, swallowing hard. “Cheers,” he manages. Drawing a deep breath and gazing into the round, he adds, “to all of you, really. Today’s been such a hard day for me. I thought about giving up a few times. Seriously. But I’m glad I didn’t, and I hope I’ll manage to stay around for a bit yet.”
“Depends,” replied Sherlock absently. “Unless it was crafted very skilfully, it seems we can increasingly rule out murder.”
“It feels ... odd. Wrong, somehow. As if I’m cheating. On the other hand ... well, I’m glad I won’t have to do any uphill cycling under my own steam today. Tomorrow’s going to be so tough – and as far as mountain passes go, I actually like Iseran and Galibier. Or ... well ... at least I don’t hate them,” he adds with a wink. “Whereabouts are we headed?”
Shortly after, their meals arrive. Sherlock wonders where Mrs. Cook found the fat to actually fry the chips and battered cod, but he doesn’t care. The meal is glorious, particularly compared to the mostly bland, cabbage and turnip-heavy fare served in the canteen at Bletchley Park. His two landladies are decent cooks who are trying to make the most of rationed provisions and the yield of their garden. But this is something else. It’s rich and greasy and altogether decadent and delicious.
She is excited to hear his report, and he gives her a short account. “He seems a good shepherd, your friend,” she says after he’s enthused about sheep specific information he has picked up from Jan. “You have learned a lot already.”
Briefly, he gives Tiltman an account of the handwritten note they found on the deceased’s body and their enquiries concerning its origin, as well as Molly’s findings as of today. When he has finished, Tiltman rises from his chair and stalks over to the window, gazing out thoughtfully while stroking his chin. Abruptly he turns and gives the two aeroplanes a little nudge so that their cords sway and twist, causing the Fokker to briefly collide with the Albatross before their cords disentangle again.
“Do it,” interrupts Sherlock impatiently. “I wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t important and likely related to our case. We will meet you at Scotland Yard.”
jackets, but you are right. They might not be enough, particularly if the sky is overcast and the wind is strong. Let me just check something. He begins to type on his phone.
Victor narrows his eyes at him, draws a deep breath and releases it slowly. “I know you think that I was the one who sold this story to
Laden with shopping as he was John took a cab back to the flat. Already upon reaching Baker Street he sensed that something was amiss. All windows of the living room were flung open, the curtains billowing outwards from the draught. When he stepped out of the taxi and paid the driver he could hear raised voices from upstairs, one unmistakably that of a very put out Mrs. Hudson. He couldn’t make out her exact words, but for her to get that loud and angry meant that Sherlock must have done something to so thoroughly annoy her that tutting and good-natured eye-rolling didn’t cut it anymore. Something monumentally stupid, by all accounts.
A group of hikers is milling around Chanctonbury Ring. They have spread out blankets between the trees and are preparing to picnic. Sherlock loathes them immediately. He can neither see nor hear a sign of Jan or Lightning, and no wonder. Jan doesn’t seem to like strangers, particularly near his sheep, unless for the purpose of teasing them. Disappointment grows in Sherlock. He has been looking forward to spending more time with Jan and his dog, and now they’re not here, or hiding somewhere. Why can’t these hikers just piss off? They don’t belong here.
He need not have worried. They had barely vacated the taxi at the station, with about five minutes to the train’s departure, when Sherlock was back on the phone with Lestrade. They’d managed a quick breakfast at the hotel: a croissant, yoghurt and tea for John and a black, two-sugared coffee for Sherlock. John had packed some provisions for the journey. He’d entertained the faint hope of meeting some of the Italians at breakfast to hear if they’d any news of how Marco was faring, but apparently they were sleeping in. They had exchanged email-addresses, however, and John hoped he would at some point be updated on his recovery.
Sherlock nodded thoughtfully. “I’ll have to do more research on fellatio to decide whether it’s something I might indeed be willing to try on you, but considering that during the activity I am the one in control, I cannot see much evidence of it impending my enjoyment of the act.”
John smiles in return, rubbing the back of his neck. “Looks like all three of us had the same. Actually, I think you should do the talking tomorrow, Molly. You knew Jennifer best, and you were the one who found her.”
Sherlock swallows. “All right,” he replies, and pulls John’s head to him again to resume their kiss. His other hand finds its way under John’s jacket, running over the silky back of his waistcoat to come to rest on the curve of his arse. John makes a low growl of approval and grinds his crotch against Sherlock’s, causing both of them to moan. With a jolt of heat Sherlock realises that if they keep going like this, things will end in embarrassment and soiled trousers very soon. He, Sherlock Holmes, self-proclaimed sociopath with a formerly mostly dormant libido and general lack of interest in and indeed disdain for all matters of sex, is going to lose his virginity to a Naval Officer in a dingy alley behind the Royal Opera House, without said Officer ever even touching his genitals. Does that even count as losing one’s virginity? Sherlock has never bothered to occupy himself with the details. It’s not important, anyway. What is important is that if they keep kissing like this, he is going to climax in the company of another human being for the first time in his life, which should be entirely frightening and humiliating and therefore undesirable. But the other human being will be John, and he won’t mind if Sherlock embarrasses himself in front of him, will very likely follow suit and moreover find Sherlock’s trust endearing, touching, even.
“Okay. So, what do we do now? Wait for whoever is behind this to show up again?” His eyes light up. “Perhaps we should ask your brother for help. His minions could set up some cameras in the flat to—”
He nods for Sherlock to move over and slips into bed next to him, immediately reaching for him. Sherlock comes willingly and with an eagerness that surprises him. This should be more awkward – he didn’t research French kissing during the night, but spent about an hour reading up on Tiffany’s favourite author and his series of fantasy books. He also downloaded the ebook version of
“Yeah, because you were playing with the bumblebees,” quips John fondly. “But now as you say it, I do recall we were chatting about women, and the chap said something about film stars and famous ladies, and ... shit, you’re right. I think he mentioned that Wilcox had tickets to see some beautiful singer one of these nights, and he was somewhat sorry that another of his mates had been the appointed driver to take him to London, and not himself. So you think Wilcox and Adler ...?”
“Sherlock’s er… colleague. Friend, of a sort. Um…” John looked to Sherlock for help, but Sherlock had gone ahead only to be stopped by another police officer.
“Yeah. It was a bit of a mess.” He leaned against the wall and looked at Sherlock. “So… do you have a partner?”
“Sherlock agrees,” John said, a bit too loudly. He cleared his throat, mildly embarrassed. “He says ‘Piss off, Mycroft.’”
“Yeah, but you’re a bloody idiot who was going to take the pill. Don’t lie to me, I heard what you were thinking,” John argued, crossing his arms. God, what did he get himself into? Why would Sherlock do that? It was for his own enjoyment… God, no wonder the man had been a junkie in the past.
John tried not to laugh at her internal commentary, and acted as normal as possible, given the situation. “Hello,” he smiled.
John nodded, and followed the sergeant out to the medical area. “Any special cases I should know about?” You never knew if you had to take into account that your patient could grow wings at a moment’s notice (which had actually happened to him one time, which is why he always asked that question now).
“A wounded soldier has no home in which to tarry, methinks a whiskey-on-rocks relationship with brother Harry,” Sherlock winced. God, he almost sounded Shakespearean that time.
The man smirked. God. Who in God’s name actually smirked? That was more of a movie villain trait than anything. “An interested party.”
John shrugged and headed for the door. His contact chip pinged with a message, as he walked outside.
“ESP. I dunno, probably because he’s been frowning at you for the past couple minutes? Or can you not see that?” John smiled, almost predatorily. “I’ll see you later, Mycroft. Perhaps we’ll have tea. And you can try to invade my thoughts and my privacy again, in a more comfortable setting.”
John could feel Sherlock feel violated and almost flinched at the force of it. “Um, that’s important, er, could you put that back please?”
John frowned, taken aback. So he hadn’t hallucinated? And four days? For blood loss? It wasn’t even acute blood loss, barely enough to pass out over, though he must’ve been injected with something from the fangs. God, sometimes he hated the Gifted. “So what kind of Gift did my patient have? Must’ve been some sort of vampire hybrid, yeah?”
John grinned. “You’re a proper genius, aren’t you.” He took a step towards Sherlock, as Sherlock stood up. “Would you mind terribly, if I…”
Sherlock looked out the window, seemingly distracted. For a moment, John thought he hadn’t heard him, then Sherlock began to speak. “Your posture spoke military, and you were very calm in front of a crowd of distressed people. You have a tan line on your neck and your wrists, obviously not from vacation. Where have we recently shipped off soldiers? Afghanistan and Iraq,” Sherlock ran through his stream of logic quickly, shyly, in a voice that seemed wary.
my team to kill him. I..” his voice caught. John closed his eyes and looked away. God, this was brutal. “And that’s not even a one-time thing. Sometimes I wonder how many people I’ve killed,
“Is that a real skull?” Anderson said in a disgusted tone, picking the skull up with gloved fingers. “That’s awful.”
“Crime scene,” Sherlock said with relish, a manic grin on his face. “You’ve been in the war…” he said suddenly, eyeing John over.
“Mostly looking for a job; the Terran Corps doesn’t supply much in terms of housing. That’s why I’m here, actually. I have some brain trauma so I can’t be in bright light for too long, and I figured this was the best place to go.”
“A mystery’s afoot, I must run, will see you later John, the game has begun!” Sherlock grinned like a Cheshire cat and swept out of the flat.
And their lips met, and it was like fireworks and pure joy and their mouths tasted like mint and their tongues battled for dominance. And John could swear that Sherlock smelled like the sweetest thing in the world and like sandalwood and spices. At least, that was what John would later write in his blog, despite him clearly not having a sense of smell, as previously acknowledged.
“You dog, John. I’d almost forgotten your days in uni,” Mike shook his head. “You always were surrounded by the birds.”
The consulting detective went silent for a moment. Well. He had been silent, technically, for the better portion of the evening, but his mind quietened for a moment.
“Broken limbs, damage to the lungs from gas inhalation… the medics on board are also hurt, but trying their best to keep everyone alive. No one documented as Gifted, except for the night-vision guy, but he shouldn’t pose too much trouble…” he hesitated. “They’ve been gassed with something, and it’s making them violent.” The soldier looked dead on his feet, but they were understaffed enough as it was.
Second floor. Right. Stairs would get annoying after a while, what with his cane and all. He made his way up and opened the door to… well, a disaster of a flat. The walls were covered in different patterns of wallpaper, there were files and papers stacked up all over the room, and there were some frankly… alternative pieces of art hanging on the wall. Ignoring the skull (a real human one?!) John’s eye caught the bull skull wearing headphones. Well. Certainly whimsical.
“Well. You’ve met him. I’m the closest thing to a friend Sherlock Holmes is capable of having. We’re…. enemies. He might even be dramatic enough to call me his
He looked up at the camera and saw it swivel away. Right. Like that wasn’t intimidating. His military instincts kicked in, putting him on high alert. Unconsciously, he straightened his spine and tensed his muscles, giving the appearance of being bigger than he actually was. “This is a bit melodramatic, isn’t it? Who are you, by the way?”
When he got outside, he found a small crowd of residents in their pajamas staring at the building and gossiping to each other.
But just as he was getting to the desk, he was interrupted by a rather rotund man who had been walking down the hall.
Supposedly it was possible for him to rejoin the Terran Corps, but it was such a selective program, what with the trillion or so pool of people to choose from, that he doubted they’d want an invalidated medic. Plus with his current conditions, he wasn’t quite sure if he even wanted to get to next year.
John Watson had been given the chance of a lifetime: fighting for the Terran Corps against the Klons from Jethrin, who had begun invading neutral territory in the Persephone and Ophreides regions. The Klons were definitely a fearsome foe, if not in person. The plant people didn’t really… move. It was mostly their subservient species that moved and operated ships for them, but for plants they were rather invasive.
It’s funny that no one questions him anymore. He’s become something of a legend, so much so that some people call him psychic. It’s absolute bullshit to them, but it’s sort of true, really. John tries not to read people’s minds and invade their privacy, his mother taught him better.
And thus ends the story! It was a lot of fun to write, though longer than I originally intended. (so long, farewell, I'll never write a oneshot). Feel free to bother me on tumblr at lamefluffydragons.tumblr.com
John was confused, until he walked inside and saw the crew, including the DI they had met earlier that day. (Was it only that day? Time moved quickly, John supposed.) The DI was joined by a small crew of three, all in uniform.
“Now look at the camera on the building to your right.” It swivelled away. “And finally, the camera on the building opposite to you.” And that one faced away as well. Right.
“How long have I been here? The guys who were gassed, they’re all okay?” John looked around belatedly, but he seemed to be the only patient.
The man chuckled. “Ah yes, the bravery of a soldier. Bravery is a kinder word for stupidity, don’t you think?” the man paused and narrowed his eyes. “What is your connection to Sherlock Holmes?”
They met up in the lobby a dozen minutes later. John had casually put his gun in the back of his jeans, his bomber jacket covering the bulge adequately. Not that he thought he’d be in danger, but he always felt safer with it closer to him.
John gave a lopsided smile. “That’s one way of looking at it. Probably should eat soon, though, since you brain needs food to run…”
“Yeah sure, and while you’re at it could you tell me again how to take off a bandage?” John asked jokingly. Alex laughed and poked him in his side. “Oh, fuck off, Al.”
“How you’re holding yourself. Also you’ve just come back from a war and I told you we’re visiting a crime scene. It’d be idiotic if you
Mike gave a self-deprecating smile. “Yeah, I know, I got fat. Weren’t you off in the Terran Corps trying not to get shot at? What happened?”
They parted, but only because they needed to breathe. “If giggling was bad while our flats burned down, surely snogging at a crime scene is worse?” Sherlock said between pants.
Sherlock seemed caught off-guard, exactly as John had wanted. He was about to speak when John interrupted.
But no, Erikkson had pulled him down and shot the person hiding in the shack. Oh God, and it was only a young boy.
John rolled his eyes. “You could say that, I suppose. I prefer calling it a hostage situation with the Klon where you offered to use me as fertilizer but I suppose you could call it an unpreferable encounter.”
“You think the killer will come to our door?” John asked, looking out of the front window at the street below.
“Unfortunate as this all may be, I am an interested party, John. I wouldn’t be unwilling to compensate you, if you were to help me.”
A waiter came by with John’s meal and John tried his best to ignore Sherlock’s endless tirade. “Sherlock, silly question, but you sleep every night, right?” It’d be awful to go to bed to such racket.
“Yes, hello John. Mild brain trauma? Perfect. And you won’t even remember if I’m less than cordial to you. Absolutely ideal.” The man clasped his hands together. “And no sense of smell! Why, it’s Christmas! Mike, leave. Importance is about to be achieved.” He spun around from his lab table. “So John, Persephone or Ophreides?” What a stunning deep voice.
With the energy of a man much younger than himself, John jumped out of bed and quickly marched out of his flat, not even sparing a glance to his laptop or cane. His leg twinged slightly, and he hoped to God it would hold out on him at least until he got outside.
Well this could be interesting. John gave one of his heart-stoppingly charming smiles. “Uh, right. Sorry, who are you? And how did you know about the sense of smell?”
“John Watson?” the receptionist called from the front. He nodded to her and got up slowly, trying to keep his center of gravity from freaking out too much. He was dizzy enough as is, what with getting used to gravity again and the brain injury.
Sherlock’s eyes lit up as he opened the door to go out. “A mistake the killer has doth made, I must be gone before the memory doth fade. Pink is important, pink is key, John go find Rachel and then tell me!” With that, Sherlock left in a whirl of black coat, and fled down the stairs.
John frowned and turned around. Sure, there must be a bunch of John Watsons currently living in London, but still.
John held back a laugh. Wouldn’t do to reveal his mindreading talent so soon in the game. “Have you always had it, or…?”
Sherlock’s thoughts were brilliant to witness, seeing the rapid-fire reasoning from scant pieces of information. Even with John’s psychic ability, he reckoned he’d never be able to do the same. It was a bit difficult to pretend to be oblivious the whole time, though. He reckoned he’d have to tell Sherlock soon.
The sergeant grunted a negative and left him at the doors of the medical area. John nodded and set his mouth in a firm line, anticipating the chaos that would unfold in the next couple of minutes. He opened the doors and Alex, the other army doctor, came up to him, looking tired and harried.
“Not really encouraging, I have to say.” John looked back at the building. The fire was probably out by now, but there was still a bit of smoke coming out of one of the windows.
“... well, I suppose my ship got shot.” At that, Mike’s face fell into an uncomfortable grimace, not entirely unlike someone who’s face had cramped after smiling for family photos with the unfortunately incontinent family dog.
They sat in amicable silence in the taxi, John eyeing Sherlock every now and then, wondering if this was all a dream. It was quite a strange and unexpected dream if it was.
John had been working as an army medic who would go from spaceship to spaceship and try and rescue and recover anyone alive, and it was general knowledge that anyone in a red spaceship was medical and therefore not to be shot at. And yet, it was just his luck that while he was docking his spaceship onto another that had seen better days that the entire area was ripped apart by a blaster. He had had few precious seconds to get on a lifesuit, but his first priority had been to get a lifesuit onto his patient. As a result, of course, he was delayed in his own suit, and had suffered a mild brain injury due to lack of air. His suit’s air supply just hadn’t kicked in in time. The PTSD hand tremor also wasn’t great.
“Hm, well I know you’ve just come back from Afghanistan and you left with an honourable discharge. You’ve got a psychosomatic limp, you’re very kind to old ladies and you have no immediate family or friends willing to give you a room to stay in. I think that’s enough to be going on, don’t you?” Sherlock winked.
“I’ll go ahead, Erikkson, you cover my back,” he ordered, marching toward the seemingly abandoned shack. There were tons of shacks to be found in the desert, some filled with explosives, others with corpses. There was rarely anything nice to be found within one. Still, he found that he
Sherlock took out the laptop and quickly typed in the phone number and password into a cell-phone tracking website.
John sighed again and worked his way upstairs. After making it to the landing, he smiled at Lestrade. The DI gestured into the room. “He’s in there, doing his thing. Can I trust you to make sure he doesn’t… oh, I don’t know, steal the body?” Lestrade chuckled grimly.
Mike shrugged and said, “Nah, he’s just like that. Have fun. Maybe you two can live together too, and you’ll be a perfect Marie and Pierre Curie.” With a sigh and a fond nod, he left the room, clasping John’s shoulder on the way out.
“And a bloody awful cabbie.” They giggled quietly together. “We shouldn’t be giggling like school girls at a crime scene,” John pointed out.
“Anderson was visited last night by Donovan, she wears the deodorant of a man. Spare me the details, if you please, I know what happened by the state of her knees.” Sherlock shone his teeth and swept into the house, leaving the two police officers (presumably Donovan and Anderson) more than disgruntled. John just shook his head and followed him inside.
“What do you mean, we’ve only just met!” John was flabbergasted; who was this Sherlock anyway? And how did he know so much?
John had to strain his Gift to hear Lestrade; Sherlock’s inner monologue was deafening. He ignored it as best as he could.
Sherlock raced up the stairs and John sighed. Having a psychosomatic limp was shite. It only really started showing itself when he had returned to London. Thank God, he’d hate to imagine the old man jokes he would’ve heard on base.
“Mm, yes, I’m sure she’s thrilled. Mrs. Hudson, go away. John and I need to prep the samples,” Sherlock said after clearing his throat.
Sherlock was leaning forward even more, then aborted the movement after John leaned back. “Well, you brought your gun, so that’s always useful. And you’re a doctor. Also quite useful.”
The car left him at a warehouse, where a man stood with as much gravitas as a man could have considering he owned an antique umbrella. “Have a seat, John.”
John furrowed his brow and smiled. “Ah,” he hesitated, looking out the door. “I, um, yeah I should probably follow him. Can I get your number so I can send you the details? Yeah, thanks.”
Sherlock snorted. “Your thought process has decelerated, your input was greatly appreciated,” with a sarcastic smile he shut the door in Anderson’s face. John let out an audible sigh of relief.
“Well, there’s fermenting Klon corpses in those bins right by you, which are rather putrid to the average nose. But what I’m more interested in is your medical knowledge of the Klon people, and, of course your experience in spaceships.” The man eyed him surreptitiously, and John straightened up and couldn’t help but puff his chest out a bit.
John frowned. Was he hallucinating? Alex’s mouth hadn’t been moving. Alex rubbed a hand over his face. “Actually... That guy who bit you really put some strange shit into your bloodstream. Never seen the likes before. He started convulsing too, afterwards. He died, but everyone else is okay. I think Lauren is gonna have a limp for a while, but that’s about it. We’re mostly worried about you, mate. You’ve been out for four days.”
“While I was away,” answers Sherlock, watching John’s reaction in the mirror. His expression darkens briefly, as it always does when Sherlock refers to his time abroad. It’s still a sore topic between them. The issue’s never really been resolved, perhaps never will be.
, calm and steady, yet with a tiny spark of something Sherlock finds difficult to place. There is pain there, but also resolve and a hint of wry humour.
“In a moment,” replies Turing, signing to Sherlock, Molly and John to follow him. Together, they weave their way through the crowded corridor. Past the gargoyles, they head towards the stretch of lawn under the mammoth tree.
John licks the shell of his ear, making him jump slightly in surprise and make a low, mewling sound that should be embarrassing but strangely isn’t.
John kisses his hair again, then releases him, looking down at him gravely. “Come on, let me have a look at your leg and your arm, and then you can help me with my shoulder.”
Immediately after, he chastises himself for the thought, even if it wasn’t serious. Burning books ... not good. There have been too many of those occurrences in Germany in recent years. Books, and even people, if the horrors hinted at in Government reports are to be believed. Despite rationing, the danger of rocket strikes and the constant worry for those fighting on the Continent and elsewhere in the world, here in England they are far better off than people elsewhere, in Germany and Russia and even the Netherlands, where a famine is threatening due to the German blockade.
“Indeed there is. The knife that had killed him wasn’t a florist’s knife, though. That was the first clue that something was strange about the ‘accident’.”
“Well, well,” says Trevor, his voice a sneer coated by a thin layer of civility, “the nation’s new little favourite. Not sure yellow suits you, Sherlock.”
“Do you really want me to explain my deduction?” Daniel shakes his head. “Thought so. Come on up. She’ll be ready in a short while.”
Drawing closer and hunkering down slightly in order to catch a glimpse of his face, he could see what had killed Moran: a single shot to the forehead from a small calibre gun. A thin ribbon of blood had run out and trickled down along his nose and onto his lap. The back of the head was hale, no splatter of blood, bone and brains behind him on the wall, but also no blood stains leading up to the bench.
“You shouldn’t be asking,” Sherlock informed him. “Falsifies the data by taking away the element of surpri— ahhh.”
Clearly agitated, Mrs. Suffield manages to get a grip. “Come on,” she says. “I’ll make you a cuppa. I’ll certainly need one."
Lestrade shook his head and grinned. “That was a good one, for sure. Whenever I need a good laugh – and a reminder that he’s human like the rest of us (more or less) –, I look at the photo of him emerging from the cellar with his coat full of kittens.”
Ducking low in the saddle to flatten his body against the wind’s resistance, he tried to go even faster, and managed until another bend forced him to brake slightly so as not to shoot right out of it and take a shortcut down the slope. Veering into the middle of the road to cut the curve, he noticed too late that there was a layer of loose gravel. For a brief, heart-stopping moment he felt his rear tyre lose grip and the bike beginning to slide, but he managed to control it by shifting his balance slightly and withstanding the reflex to brake hard which likely would have caused the wheel to block and slip even more.
“Oh yes, there are hunts. Particularly in the autumn you have to be careful where you tread in the forest and on the heathlands so as not to get your backside riddled with bullets. Next weekend there’s one, down at Hollesley. Not a real fox-hunt, mind. I’m glad they got rid of those, although some of the locals were protesting, even running a petition. Right, here we are. This lane straight ahead leads to my cottage. It’s just a couple of yards, behind those trees. But I reckon you’ll want to see the farm right away.”
John smiled sleepily. “Hope you’re not treating it as messily as you do our flat, letting all your stuff lie around and all that.”
Sherlock hums thoughtfully while wiping his hand on another Kleenex. “I’ve already determined several parameters that could be improved, based on your reactions and my deductions about your sexual preferences. I foresee that we will use this lockdown very profitably.”
“You’re suddenly all tense. We don’t have to get up just yet, despite what your dratted phone says.”
Immediately, the tree stands silent but for the wind sighing in its branches. “Got you,” whispers Sherlock, smiling to himself. Motioning to John, he signs for him to approach one side of the tree, while he takes the other.
“So you don’t countenance striking back at the Germany with all we have, to take revenge for our cities they’ve bombed? Marjorie here lost her house in the Blitz, and my Larry was killed in a bombing raid. If I could, I’d hop on the next plane and bomb the life out of Germany.”
Temperatures are fierce again, but not as severe as during the past days because of the altitude at which Le Grand-Bornand is situated. Humidity is high, though. The air feels electric and full of tension, making the riders skittish and sharp with each other, their patience stretched and likely to snap suddenly. Everybody seems eager to get this stage over with, to enjoy a long, mostly bike-free rest day at Tignes. The weather forecast is worrying, too. Thunderstorm and yellow rain warnings have been announced for the
Sherlock looks up Plattdeutsch for ‘eins’. It’s a letter short, ‘een’. But what if the Enigma operator just typed one letter wrong, and not because he caught the wrong key, but because his mind was distracted by thoughts of home? He returns to his seat and tries it out with a pencil. As far as he can judge, it works. The EINS-catalogue can be applied if one assumes this is what the man wanted to type. The number looks like it’s been spelled ‘eens’ on two occasions throughout the message where there is a high likelihood of the number appearing. The Banbury sheets work, too. There is no instance of letters encoded with themselves. So perhaps it was indeed a ‘Hamborger Jong’ typing in this message. Sherlock is delighted, the thrill of a working crib, the possibility of a solved riddle surging through him. It must show in his face, because Watson gazes at him with a faint smile.
Apparently, both she and the two other women have planned ahead as John and Sherlock and have already donned their evening attire. All three girls have gone to some lengths of styling their hair into elaborate curls and waves, and the case of the shorter, blonde woman, accentuating it with a bow.
Sherlock nods. “So they knocked me out, too, and thankfully didn’t strike me hard enough to break my skull.”
John takes his words for a peace offering. “True. It would mess up these ... Edwardian furnishings somewhat badly.”
John sighs. He hadn’t actually intended to swim, but he follows Sherlock and together they do some more lengths in varying styles. John giggles when Sherlock tries butterfly, flailing in the water like a stranded whale because the pool is so short and rather shallow.
Chaining his bike to one of the stands and leaving his helmet to dangle from the handlebars, he walks round the fence onto the street and gazes up towards the dusty first floor windows. He can see some crates or boxes inside, but nothing else. The building does have a new door that’s even equipped with a letter box, and – this strikes him as particularly interesting – a very recent-looking lock.
Sherlock shrugs, but then nods. He gets up to rinse his mouth. “It’s not over yet,” he calls from the bathroom.
Sherlock takes a deep breath, looking very interested in a fold of the duvet. His lips narrow. “Your text message ...,” he says at length. “It ... unsettled me. You were very open and honest. I had deduced your ... interest before. But to have it written out ... It put pressure on me. I needed time to think. I spent as little time with Victor as possible. He basically wanted to inform me about his plan to leave the Tour, to say good-bye and wish me luck.”
Greg sighs, rubbing the back of his neck. “A good number, and not just British ones. Mostly tabloids, of course, the usual suspects. German
“I’ll try. They won’t be happy, but perhaps it’ll work if I agree to be on call, should they be swamped with flu victims. I’ll send them an email. For now, I hope you’ll excuse me. I’ll have a quick hot shower, and then it’s bed for me.”
Sherlock nods. Underneath a smear of mud where apparently she keeled over and fell face down into the soft clay at the water’s edge, Jennifer Wilson’s features aren’t pale in death, but retain a faint pink flush. Her eyes are tightly shut and her mouth under traces of dark pink lipstick
“Yes. We ... we’ve talked about it. Nothing definite, though. There’s Tiffany to consider, of course. And also ... it’s a big step, divorce.”
“Good evening, Sherlock,” comes The Woman’s voice through the line. “I hope I’m not interrupting anything.” Sherlock sighs. He can almost hear her suggestive leer.
“We’ll likely approach you again with more questions,” Lestrade tells him. “Since the circumstances of her death remain mysterious and questionable, would you please keep what information I have given you to yourself for the time being. You may inform the members of your band like your pianist, but only if he enquires after her. Tell him that she fell victim to an accident. That’s not too far off the truth. Everything else needs to be investigated further. How long are you going to stay in town?”
John sits down next to him, leaning back against the headboard and adjusting a pillow in his back to be more comfortable. “Ah yes. The case, right? Didn’t you want to talk to that reporter? Kitty Riley?”
Mycroft sighs, looking years older despite the warm light of the desk lamp as it illuminates his face from below. “Listen, Sherlock, I’m not pointing this out to hurt you. I am sure that you are aware of how this is going to end. Rather sooner than later, Dr. Watson is going to be reassigned and sent back to sea, if only to keep him out of the firing line of the press.”
“Why did you decide to come and play, then?” asks Hope as Jennifer Wilson steps into the room where she has died in the past.
he runs across the road to find his bicycle. There is no way he can keep up with a roadster, but a quick glance at his watch tells him that the 11:29 to Oxford is about to come through and that the car will likely have to stop at the railway crossing, giving Sherlock time to catch up and then at least try and follow for a bit, to see the direction Seb is heading out of Bletchley.
She cocks her head. Sherlock can tell that his words have intrigued her. He pushed himself off the doorframe and takes a step towards her, planting himself next to John.
Watson takes off his cap and brushes a hand through his sweaty hair. The strands are dark golden, with touches of grey, and show only a minimal treatment with pomade to keep them in place. Sherlock approves, he abhors the stuff. It doesn’t work with his curls, anyway, they’re too wayward even for the strongest pomade. Sherlock is astonished the doctor’s hair draws his attention. Must be the sunlight falling on it.
