Cas hummed in protest. "Dean, we dont have to go anywhere, I can clean us up. " He said lifting his hand above them.
Castiel smiles down at him. He's just too cute, those green eyes looking at him in wonder, his voice cracking with every word, freckles sprinkled across his nose. He leans down and kisses Dean on the forehead. "Dean, I'm sure I don't have to tell you how wildly inappropriate it would be for me to kiss you the way you were asking me. I will tell you this though. You come back and visit me in 6 years, and we can have this conversation again, if you still want to."
Cas doesn't hold back, lettting out the dirtiest moan as he rolls his hips back onto Dean's hand. "Dean!... ungh... more... I ... nnn..need more..... please!"
Castiel placed his hand on the center console as he turned around to look. "Yea, she's out" He turned back around smiling. "Thank you for inviting me Dean. This was really fun."
"What do you want for your birthday Cas?" Dean asked
Castiel bit his lip, holding back a moan "Then you may have me on the kitchen counter" Castiel ran his hand down Dean's chest and let it rest on his hip for a moment, before pushing him backward. "But first, breakfast and spending the morning with Darla." Castiel took back control of his resolve that Dean was very efficiently melting a moment ago. "Now, get out of my kitchen and let me cook."
"Hello Dean" Cas said, his voice still rough from sleep"
Dean simple shakes his head as he softly kisses Cas' lips. "You were incredible"
Dean shrugged, "I've rented the room for a month, I figured that would give you enough time to look for an apartment, which you should. You can stay here, but in the long run, an apartment will be cheaper for you Cas. I asked, the Gas and Sip is only a couple blocks away, so you can walk to work. I'm gonna go get washed up before getting back on the road."
"Come on Darla, lets go check those cookies, they smell like they are ready"
Dean stepped forward and grabbed his arm, turning him back around. "Cas, wait. what do you mean you're sorry?" Dean searched the Angel's face "You have nothing to be sorry for, that was.... awesome"
"mmmhmmm" Cas nods.
Dean licks his lips before whispering "Everything"
Castiel had Dean wait in the room after they washed up while he padded barefoot wearing just his bathrobe to the kitchen and cut a slice of pie. When he walked into the room Dean stared at him hungrily. "Gee Cas, I can't decide which looks more delicious, the pie, or you."
Up until now he had let Dean steer this ride, but now he wanted a turn at the wheel. Dean froze above him as Castiel wrapped his arms firmly around Dean's torso holding him in place. He bent his knees, planting his feet firmly against the bed and began thrusting up into him like a wild rabbit. Dean was making noises that Castiel had never heard before, his eyes rolling back into his head and he fucked him. Using strength he didnt know he would still have, he flipped them over onto Dean's back. Dean instinctively wrapped his legs around Castiel's waist as he continued thrusting into him with wild abandon.
Cas continued to thrust into him as he milked his softening cock, until suddenly his body went rigid... "Ah... ah...uh... Dean" he moaned out, spilling his load into Dean's ass, collapsing on top of him.
"oh!" Dean moaned "Cas... I think we need...." Dean began to protest as the Angel shoved his finger in further, without the assistance of lubrication.
Castiel flipped the lid on the bottle of lube and poured it into his hand, his mouth pulling off of Dean's cock with a loud sloppy pop. He grabbed it with both hands and slathered it with lube. He looked up at Dean who was staring at him, mouth opened, eyes wide. Cas leaned into him flicking his tongue over his lips and into his mouth, kissing deeply, eliciting a moan, from which one of them he wasnt quite sure.
Cas closes the distance between them wrapping his arm around Dean's waist pulling him into him. He presses their lips together as Dean wraps his arms around him. He feels Dean's tongue lick over his lips and he parts them, letting Dean slide into his mouth. His tongue meets Dean's gently at first as he feels his body come alive. He lets out a low moan pulling Dean closer, their cocks rubbing against each other.
Cas looks up at him, popping his cock out of his mouth, running his tongue down the underside as he lifts Dean's leg over his shoulder. His tongue glides over Dean's balls before slowly circling his tight puckered hole. He hears Dean hiss above him and he looks up to check his expression. "Too much?" he asks
"Cas..." Dean mutters as he slowly pulls out of him, his breath ragged.
Dean grips Cas by his thighs turning him over on the bed in a quick movement. He runs his hands up Cas' body, fingertips digging into his flesh as he does. Running them up his arms, raising them above his head. Dean straddles Cas' waist as he reaches for the handcuffs, using them to secure Cas' wrists to the bars of the headboard. "Are they too tight?"
Slowly Dean pushed further in, the warmth of Cas engulfing his cock and this time it was Dean who moaned. He felt Cas tense up and stopped again, this time he pulled back a little, before pushing in again, and he could feel Cas relax around him. He slowly worked his cock in and out a little at a time, until all at once he was all the way in. A moan released between the two of them simultaneously, and Dean leaned all the way forward, shifting Cas' legs to wrap around his hips. He took the angel's head into his hand and pulled him into a kiss. His toungue sweeping over his lips and then greedlily into his mouth. Their lower bodies were still, adjusting to the sensations.
Cas smiles kissing her on the cheek. "Anything!"
When he turned around he saw Cas was still sitting on the loveseat. "Cas, c'mon man, you gotta come over here. Sit on the bed with me." Dean sat up on the bed with his legs crossed, and Cas soon joined him, mimicking how he was sitting. Dean was still trying to decide on a song to start with, frustrated, not able to decide on which one to start with, he decided to just put it on shuffle, let fate or whatever decide, they were all good.
She nods and he goes back to his seat as her eyes quickly scan over his carefully written words. She raises her eyes to look at him and Dean swears the whole class can hear his heart beating inside his chest as she begins reading from the page.
Castiel threw himself back on the bed, no longer having control of his body. Dean popped Castiel's dick out of his mouth, an gripped it with his hand, working it just as fast as his mouth had. with his other hand he pushed up on Castiel's thigh, exposing the tight ring of muscle that was there. Castiel didn't even have time to think about what was going to happen next as Dean worked his tongue over his sensitive hole. Pushing at the tight ring until he gained entrance, and Castiel once again let out a cry of pleasure that filled the room. He could feel himself getting dangerously close, and he didnt want to come yet.
Today was going to be the day, Dean just felt it. He immediately wove his fingers into the feathers, and grabbed ahold of his wing, running his hand, massaging the warm hard bone that was there. He was so lost in the feeling he was getting just from touching them that he almost missed it. Castiel moaned softly, turning to give Dean a look of warning. This was the first time he'd gotten that reaction, hell this was the first time he'd gotten any kind of reaction. Dean didn't relent, he pushed his other hand into the feathers, massaging and teasing the wings, elating in the way they began to tremble. This time the moan was louder and Dean couldn't help but smile.
Dean smiled "Ok, so for the next 53 days, I say that we keep this very low key. I will still come in for our nightly talks, but we'll keep it public. We can do that for 53 days right?"
"that was me projecting my pleasure onto you. I want to make you feel, the way you make me feel." Castiel leaned into him, bringing his mouth to his "can I make you feel good Dean?"
"that, Dean. Is what I feel when you touch me like that."
"Talk dirty to me Cas." Dean moans leaning down kissing him hard as he continues to ride him at a full gallop.
"Yes Mr Novak?" Dean said against his neck, licking and biting the tender skin there.
"Oh Cas..." Dean licked his swollen lips."You couldn't be more perfect." Dean smashed his lips into Cas again, and he met Dean's every move, hungrily.
"Whatever way I desire huh? " Dean asked with a smirk
Castiel's fingers dug into Dean's hips as he tried to hold on. Dean was pounding himself on top of him, his own cock bouncing between their stomachs with loud a loud slap every time it hit. His head was thrown back in complete ecstacy, Castiel had never seen a sight so beautiful in his entire life.
"Hey Cas " Dean replied, taking a step of his own. They were now mere inches from each other.
"So how was Saturday night? You never called me" Dean says as he video chats with Charlie on Monday afternoon.
Cas was about to ask Dean where he was taking him, when the car slowed and turned left, Cas looked up and saw they were pulling into a motel parking lot. Neither of them said a word as Dean pulled into a parking spot and got out of the car, walking toward the door marked OFFICE. Cas watched him through the window as he talked to the young woman behind the desk, and kept his eyes on him as he came back out glancing down the building and then got back in the car. Still not a word was said as Dean moved the car down the lot and parked directly outside room 9.
Cas stands up taking a step closer to Dean. "Dean, do you... have you... are you..." Cas isn't sure what it is he wants to ask. He looks down at the floor, when he looks back up Dean is standing closer to him. "What was happening before, is that something you really want?" he asks, his voice low.
Castiel looked around him, not fully understanding the question. When he looked back at Dean he noticed his eyes were raised, looking above his head. Castiel slowly lifted his head, looking up to the ceiling. Hanging above his head was a small bunch of mistletoe. He snapped his head back down and was suddenly face to face with Dean, who had stepped closer without a sound. There faces were so close that Castiel could smell the beer on Dean's breath.
"So, you have Darla every other year?"
As always comments are appreciated !!!
"What the fuck Cas?" Dean said taking a staggering step.
Cas lifts his eyes and looks into Dean's face, concern written all over it. He can't say the words, so he simply nods.
His mind wandered to thoughts of what Dean looked like standing in the shower, white soap suds running over his firm tan body. His breath hitched as his hand moved over his stomach, down to his increasingly hard dick. He wouldn't lie, he had found himself absently touching his own member quite frequently after that night with April. Even though she had killed him the next morning, she had shown him how wonderful sexual pleasure was. He had never fully understood it before that night. He would further admit, if only to himself, that more often than not, it was Dean's face that he saw when he imagined being with someone. It was the thought of Dean now, imagining him in this shower with him, the image of what he looked like when he came out of the bathroom, that had made his member grow with desire.
Dean's head turned toward him. "Hey Cas. Must've been quite tired huh?" he asked sitting up on the couch, muting the tv with the remote.
"Yes sweetheart, be careful don't fall."
Castiel let out a chuckle and planted a wet kiss on his lips. "You may have to give me just as little while. But yea we can do that again."
"Good" Dean pulled him in for another kiss, soft and sweet. "Wanna snuggle on the couch and watch a movie?"
Did he want this?
Castiel pounded into him relentlessly until Dean was moaning and muttering senseless words under him. Cas could feel Dean start to clench around him "I'm gonna.... oh god Cas.... I'm gonna...." Dean panted "Oh GOd CAS! FUCK" Dean screamed as his orgasm hit.
Charlie shrugs "I don't know, I mean, we definitely had a good time, but we work together, things might get weird."
Castiel walks over to the counter and leans closer to Dean "don't worry, I won't tell" he says with a wink.
Dean shifts his arm, reaching for Cas' cock, teasing the tip with his fingers, which only serves to make Cas' rotate his hips up further, allowing Dean more access to his tight hole. He goes to work on it once again with his tongue, fucking him open with it. "Mmm, Cas, I love the way you taste, and the way your body is just craving it. But I want to hear you beg me, tell me how much you want me to fuck you right now."
"You didn't have to stay, despite what you think, I am perfectly capable of taking care of myself. You should not feel any obligation to me or my well being. " Cas said in a low tone, hanging his head. Part of him was indeed very happy that Dean was here when he woke up, but another part of him wished he would have slipped out while he was still sleeping. Letting go, watching Dean leave him, that was going to be hard. Suddenly Cas felt a heaviness in his chest, and there was burning in his eyes. Great, he thought, I'm going to start crying. He took a deep breath, trying to keep his emotions under control. It was bad enough that Dean thought he couldnt take care of himself, the last thing he needed was for Dean to see him crying too. Cas wasn't used to all these emotions so easily overwhelming him.
"Right, thats what I want for Darla.I asked her if she wanted to go and she did. There's been a couple times when she didn't feel like it and we didn't and if it ever gets to the point where she doesn't want to anymore, we won't. But for now she likes it."
Could he turn away?
The conversation was a little different today as Dean told Castiel about everything he was going to miss about Lawrence. And about his nervousness about moving, and starting a new school, and how Sammy was going to handle the the move, though he supposed being that same was only 9, that he would adjust a little easier.
“Yea, sure Cas, what is it you want to talk about?” Dean felt a twinge in his gut, anxious about what he could possibly have to talk to him about that he wouldn’t want Sam to hear.
"Oh Cas." Dean said and Castiel thrust faster into him. "Oh Fuck" Castiel slowed down, thrusting deep into him "Oh shit" Dean moaned out, wrapping his foot around Castiel's thigh, trying to pull him closer, his head turning back to look at him, biting his lip as Castiel thrust deeper and deeper.
"That you may have given me too many options here" Dean chuckles turning off the vibrator, placing it back in the box, then sets it on the floor. He climbs on the bed between Cas' legs, running his hands over Cas' thighs.
Cas turned and walked down the sidewalk toward the classic black car waiting for him. Dean was standing on the other side of the car, on his phone. When he turned to face him, Cas felt warmth and comfort wash over him. Things had been so hard for him lately, at times he was afraid he wouldn't be able to make it on his own. Even though he hadn't been happy to see him when he'd shown up unannounced at the Gas n Sip earlier, he was most assuredly glad that Dean was here now.
A smile spread across Castiel's face as he in turn held onto Dean's hand.
So what I have done is left it at a point where it's up to you. You can let your dirty little mind take you to all the places you want it to between them, and still have the morning after be as it is given to us, or you can rewrite the story as it happened cononically. You could also let it all be a dream, and not have to face he questions of if they were together for those blissfully sexy hours, why did they still part ways in the morning....
“We are just in another room, same Motel, but we need to talk, and I didn’t think you’d want Sam to be around for it.” Cas took two steps toward him.
Before he closes it he asks Dean which car in the lot was Crowley's, Dean pointed it out, wondering what he was doing. He watches him walk over tot he car, and place a piece of paper under the wiper blade. "What was that all about?" he asks when Cas gets back in the car.
Dean had gone for a drive, he was going stir crazy holed up in that motel room with Sam doing research on their latest case and he needed air. Driving baby had always calmed him, the nice crisp fall air coming through the windows and the low purr of the engine helped him clear his mind. Well clear his mind from the case they were currently working on anyway. As it often did when he was alone, his thoughts turned to Castiel, those beautiful blue eyes, and his lips, they way they always seemed to be chapped. Dean wanted to run his tongue over them, get them nice and wet before venturing deeper into his mouth, discovering the taste of the angel. Wanted to make him moan, he wanted to  feel Cas fall apart under him with pleasure. He thought about how Cas looked with that trenchcoat, how sexy it was, but also how much he wanted to see what was underneath all those layers. Damn, why did he wear so many layers, he wanted to see his muscles move under his skin, wanted to run his hands over his body and make him writhe. Watch his eyes go wide and his face soften as he took him into his mouth. Dean bit his lip, "Damn" he said aloud as he palmed his dick through his jeans.
Dean leaned forward, trapping his cock between them as he continued to Grind his hips against Castiel's. His tongue and teeth fighting of the flesh that covered Castiel's chest as he made his way up to his mouth. Teeth biting and then tongue soothing over his bottom lip before thrusting into his mouth and tangling with his own. "Oh god Cas, I'm so close... you feel so good..." Dean murmered against his lips and let out a dirty moan when Castiel thrust his hips up into him for the first time.
"Top drawer next to the bed" Dean moaned before Castiel shoved him back into the bed.
A few minutes later, Dean walked out of the bathroom, with one towel wrapped around his waist and another in his hand drying his hair. Cas looked up at him, suddenly uncomfortable. Of course he had seen Dean without a shirt many times, he'd even seen him in just a towel before, but not since he became human. Dean was beautiful, Cas had always thought so, but now his body was reacting very suddenly in a way that he was not used to.
Dean simply cannot believe he is sitting here right now. It's not that his "date" is unattractive. Sure, he's a little thicker, balding a little maybe, but those things didn't bother him, plus his Scottish accent was sexy as hell, if only the guy wasn't a complete douche. Fergus "call me Crowley" McLeod was the principal at Dean's little brother Sammy's school, and after Sammy had gotten into a fight with a boy named Gordon in the cafeteria, Dean had been asked to come in. Well, actually their father had been contacted first, but he was off on another bender, so it had once again fallen to Dean to take care of Sammy.
"Please Cas.... fuck! I need you, Cas! Oh... ungh... I need you inside me!" Dean moaned and whimpered, his torso still splayed across the table.
"Oh God Cas... I love this fucking ass of yours" Dean says as he brings his hand down hard on the skin.
"Dean" Cas breathes just before Dean runs his tongue over his hole, slowly pushing inside of him. Cas' back arches off the bed as he throws his head back, fingers still grasping and pulling at the bed sheets. Dean licks and sucks at Cas' rim, his tongue pushing in and swirling around, drivng Cas mad with pleasure. Cas holds his breath as Dean slowly slides a finger into him and when he rolls his hips fro more, Dean is eager to give it to him, pumping and scissoring, stretching him open until Cas is Chanting Deans name. "Dean... please... " He begs, pushing his ass back onto Dean's fingers.
"Where the hell did you go just then?" Dean asks
Dean sets a slow steady pace and Cas is torn between being in complete bliss, and desperately wanting more. He runs his hands over Dean's body grabbing scratching pulling their bodies together. "Oh Dean..." he moans softly as Dean kisses down his neck, leaving little love bites along his collarbone. Dean takes Cas' nipple into his mouth, worrying the already sensitive flesh causing Cas to arch his back off the bed. The shift in his body also enables Dean's cock to graze across his prostate, forcing a shuttering moan out of Cas. Seeingly encouraged by the new whimpering noises falling from Cas' lips Dean thrusts harder into him, nailing his prostate each time. While his thrusts are harder, his pace is still slow and when Cas reaches down trying to grab his own cock, Dean swats his hand away, wrapping his own long fingers around his hot erection, pumping slowly with his thrusts.
I want to say thank you for being such a creep, for it has allotted me the opportunity to take your gorgeous date home. hope you enjoyed your evening, I know I'll be enjoying the rest of mine!
Dean's fingers swirl in the gathering spit at the base of his cock and slowly teases his tight hole, slipping a finger in as he moans around Cas' cock again.
Cas fills Dean's mouth with a cry, thrusting his hips upward, his cock hitting the back of Dean's throat as hot salty cum pours out of him.
Castiel opened the oven and pulled out the apple pie with his mitted hands. He heard the knock at the door he had been waiting for. Just like always, little Dean Winchester was just in time for his pie.
Dean laughs "Ladies don't show up to work on Monday morning with a hickey on their neck" He says, noticing the faint bruise that Charlie had tried to cover with makeup.
"Another, please, I can take it Dean" Jimmy panted open mouthed as he wiggled his ass back into Dean's hand.
"Thanks, but I'm afraid the church may burn down if I step foot in. I'd hate to ruin Christmas for everyone." Castiel chuckled.
"Hello Dean." Dean whipped around in his chair and saw Cas standing there. He hadn't even heard him come in, but there he was, standing not even 3 feet from him in that damn tan coat of his. His face expressionless, but his eyes softly looking at him.
Dean growled into his mouth before pulling their bodies apart. He stood next to the bed and quickly removed his pants, pulling out a packet of lube and a condom from the pocket before tossing them aside. He placed the foil packets of the stand next to the bed and leaned over kissing Castiel once again.
When he turned back toward the counter, Dean had moved closer. "I can't believe how at home you look in my kitchen, and wearing my clothes." Dean came up behind him,  wrapping his arms around Castiel once more and nuzzling into his neck.
He felt the sudden emptiness as Cas pulled away, his hand now in front of Dean's face. "Lick it Dean, get it nice and wet." Dean obliged licking Cas' hand like it was a melting ice cream cone in the middle of summer. Cas pulled his hand away and Dean heard him undo his pants, and Cas sighed as he ran the wet hand over his own hard cock. He leaned over his body again, Dean felt his cock slide between his cheeks as he whispered in his ear "Are you ready?"
Cas sat up in the bed, looking down at his erection and then looking over at Dean realizing he too has one. "you... you dream about this?" he asks, still trying to really grasp what's going on.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dean felt blood rushing south, he liked where this was going "Yea Cas?"
"Hey Castiel, you ok?" Jo asks as she walks by.
Castiel licked his lips and nodded, still not trusting his voice. Dean smiled and walked to the kitchen. He stood there looking at the tree, admiring the handmade ornaments that Darla must have made over the years. He chuckled a little when he found one that Dean himself must have made when he was a child.
"I'm glad she gave me a chance." Dean says focusing on keeping his voice steady, even though inside he was screaming.
"Dean?" Castiel's voice cracked after a moment.
Castiel looked around him, not fully understanding the question. When he looked back at Dean he noticed his eyes were raised, looking above his head. Castiel slowly lifted his head, looking up to the ceiling. Hanging above his head was a small bunch of mistletoe. He snapped his head back down and was suddenly face to face with Dean, who had stepped closer without a sound. There faces were so close that Castiel could smell the beer on Dean's breath.
"Thank you Castiel." She smiled her cutest little smile up at him.
"Whole heartedly" Cas nods.
"Yea Cas?" he says after a moment. He still trying to grasp what just happened. Cas had finally kissed him, really kissed him. It was taking all of his energy not to flip Cas over and take him.
"C'mon Cas, I've had your dick in my mouth, no need to be shy now." Dean said with a smirk, kissing him again. "Out with it"
"No Cas, it's ok. I'm not really tired, still kind of wound up from the hunt. You are always welcome in my room. Even though I don't understand why you find my room more comfortable, yours is the exact same." Dean sat down on the edge of the bed.
Dean feels his dick twitch, Cas really wanted to take both of them? at the same time? When he looks from Cas to himself, the look on his face convinces him that inside Cas is exactly where he needs to be. Dean spits in the palm of his hand reaching down slicking his cock before gripping the base firmly, sliding in closer. He slowly presses the head against Cas' stretched hole and his own cock. -God if he let himself think about this he'd never go through with it-
"nnnoo..." Castiel stuttered when he finally found his voice. He wrapped his arms around Dean's neck and pulled him in for another kiss, this one held a little more passion as Castiel took control, gliding his tongue over Dean's lips before he opened up to him and met his tongue with his own. The kiss deepened as Dean ran his hands under Cas' shirt and up his back, pulling him in as close as he could.
P.S.See you in 6 years!
Dean smiled, seeing and understanding the dynamic between the boys. They knew each other better than anyone ever could, and a part of him was jealous that Jimmy would always be that for Castiel. But he was happy that he now had something of Castiel's all to himself. Both boys walked to the door, Jimmy taking the lead, Castiel not letting go of Dean's hand.
I stared at my phone unsure of what was happening until I felt a hand on my shoulder. My heart leaps as he says my name, I look up at the most beautiful man I will ever know.
"Seriously Cas, are you just going to lay there?" Dean smiled "The water's warmer than that bed."
Dean's left panting when he pulls away, and finally manages to find his voice. "not cats... but it seems like Cas likes it." He says with a smile.
The soft blush already painting his cheeks brightens a little and spreads down his chest. "anything you want baby" he smiles as he kisses Dean again.
"Yea. Growing up we went to church. My family wasn't super religious, but we went on christmas. I just thought that I should at least give Darla he opportunity to see what it's all about." Dean explained.
Dean's eyes lit up. "I can't believe you made me forget pie. I knew you would be good, but damn!" Dean smiled. "Lets get washed up and maybe grab a slice... before..." he winked at Castiel, making him blush and smile.
"You, just you." Castiel paused looking up at Dean, a soft smile pulling the corner of his mouth. "The first night you came into the store, I went home and told Jimmy about you, and I've been talking about you every night since. Jimmy knows me better than I even know myself sometimes. He knew immediately that I had a crush, and he also knew that I would never act on it. After he met you at the store, he came up with the plan to seduce you together. His only stipulation was that he wanted to ride you first, after that, he said I could have you all to myself. I didn't agree right away, I didnt want to share you with anyone, not even with Jimmy. But I just couldn't build up the courage by myself, Jimmy even tried helping me when we were working together and you'd come in. I just, I couldn't stand the thought of you saying no and then not coming anymore. This way I figured, if Jimmy started things and you weren't down for it, he'd be the one you'd  awkward with, not me. I'm a coward, but I just didnt want to lose you."
Dean's head turned toward him. "Hey Cas. Must've been quite tired huh?" he asked sitting up on the couch, muting the tv with the remote.
"Tell you what, we go get cleaned up and then we can spend the day snuggled on the couch"
Dean grabbed his arm, just tight enough to stop his movements. "You are family Cas. Darla is thrilled you are here. Please stay"
Dean leaned down and licked the tip, lapping up the precum that was coating it. Cas tasted like he smelled, like the earth, just after the rain fell. As he pulled his mouth away Cas' hips rose to follow him. Dean let out a soft chuckle. "Yea baby, I want more too, but we gotta get the rest of these cloths off first." he said, grabbing the waist of his pants, and tugging down "Now, help me out here Cas, lift your ass." Cas did and Dean pulled his pants to his ankles before he realized Cas still had his shoes on. He quickly removed them and finished pulling off his pants, which went flying across the room.
Castiel pulled his mouth free, running his tongue along the underside of Dean's hard wet member, swirling it around the top before flicking it along the underside of the head. Dean's eyes were lust blown as he looked down at Cas, watching him as his tongue eagerly gathered the precum that was now leaking out of him. Castiel moaned at the salty flavor of Dean, his tongue flicking back across the slit in search of more. He pressed his lips together and kissed the head of Dean's dick, like it was something precious, because to him it was. All of Dean was precious, and he was so happy to see that Dean was enjoying this as much as he was.
Dean's movement was quick when he pulled away, Castiel's mouth chasing the skin as it moved. Dean took Castiel's hand and quickly slurped two of his fingers into his mouth, getting them nice and wet before pulling them out. "I want you in me Cas. I need you to be in me please!" Dean turned, kneeling forward with ass toward him, he took Castiel's wet fingers and pressed them against his opening. The moan that escaped him was so dirty that if Castiel hadn't already been turned on, that moan would have done it. Castiel pulled his legs up, kneeling behind Dean, his spit slicked fingers working around the puckered ring of muscle, pressing and sinking into him slowly. Dean's arms gave out from under him and he lay forward on the bed, ass up in the air. Castiel continued working first one, then two fingers into him, while reaching under him and playing with his cock because he just couldn't get enough of it.
"If that's ok with you, I would love to go look at lights with you."
-Let's Spend The Night Together
"That's not fair, you know... uhhh... ohhh.... thats the worst thing you can do to me" Cas says straining his head as Dean continues to run his thumb over the sensitive skin.
"that was me projecting my pleasure onto you. I want to make you feel, the way you make me feel." Castiel leaned into him, bringing his mouth to his "can I make you feel good Dean?"
"Go to dinner with me tomorrow night. There is this really great restaurant in Topeka." Mr. McLeod smiles.
Cas stands up taking a step closer to Dean. "Dean, do you... have you... are you..." Cas isn't sure what it is he wants to ask. He looks down at the floor, when he looks back up Dean is standing closer to him. "What was happening before, is that something you really want?" he asks, his voice low.
The conversation was a little different today as Dean told Castiel about everything he was going to miss about Lawrence. And about his nervousness about moving, and starting a new school, and how Sammy was going to handle the the move, though he supposed being that same was only 9, that he would adjust a little easier.
"ANY way you desire " Castiel replied
Castiel licks his lips and moves in even closer to Dean, their bodies almost touching in the dark corner. Dean hears him take a breath before speaking again. "You're gorgeous Dean and I want nothing more than to know what your mouth feels like on mine right now."
" excuse us Sam." Castiel said quickly before suddenly transporting them to the room Sam and Dean had rented for the evening.
Dean shrugged looking back at Cas who's face was flushed, his eyes heavy with pleasure, Dean smiled again running his fingers in deeper. This time he saw the moan on Cas' face before he heard it, Castiel turning his head, blue eyes pleading.
Dean let out a moan around his cock as Cas continued to slowly thrust upward. Dean moved his knees up beneath him, and placed his hands beside Cas' hips, loosening his jaw he looked up at Cas who's blue eyes seemed to be glowing with desire. He nodded lightly and Cas bucked his hips up into Dean, forcing his cock deep into his mouth, hitting the back of his throat so hard that Dean almost gagged and tears stung his eyes, but he didn't stop him, and Cas continued to frantically fuck his mouth.
"That should have been my family, I could be living that life. I would have done anything for him" I told my sister as we sat at the end of the bar. The restaurant we were in was over crowded, and I didn't want to be there. This wasn't my scene, it was late and I wanted nothing more than to be curled up on my couch, hot cocoa in hand watching some drama on neflix.
"I, uh... I'm sorry guys..." Dean stammers, feeling his face turn red, he takes a step back toward the half open door, accidentally pushing it closed in his haste to leave, he slams against the door with a thud.
Before he closes it he asks Dean which car in the lot was Crowley's, Dean pointed it out, wondering what he was doing. He watches him walk over tot he car, and place a piece of paper under the wiper blade. "What was that all about?" he asks when Cas gets back in the car.
Castiel's heart leapt in his chest, he really had no interest in the whole church thing, but if it meant he got to spend more time with Dean, and Darla of course, then he would suffer through it. "I'd love to Dean." Castiel smiled.
"Ok, they're ready, now I just need an oven mitt" Darla reached opened the drawer next to the stove and pulled out a mitt for him.
"So what is Sam's punishment for hitting this boy?" Dean asks
His mind raced with wild thoughts of what was happening, and then his mind clouded and he gave in, kissing Jimmy back and reaching up to pull him closer. He then felt a second pair of lips kissing and nibbling on his neck. He let out a soft moan as his other hand reached out for Castiel and pulled his body in closer to his own.
"D..dean.... ungh.... yes... love my cock in your tight ass... ngh... oh shit... I think I'm... gonna..." Cas' breath came hard and fast as Dean pushed down hard, buring his cock deep in his own ass rotating his hips, grinding down onto Cas. "Come on Cas, fill me up.... Come for me...." Dean says biting on Cas' ear. "I want to feel you come inside me.
Castiel took off his shoes and jacket, and walked into the living room. He was looking at photos of Dean and Darla when heard the sound of little feet running down the hall, turning he saw Darla come running in her Christmas nightgown. "Castiel, Santa's coming tonight! I need to put out his cookies and milk" Castiel chuckled as she ran into the kitchen her hair bouncing as she went.
Dean grabs Cas' shoulder flipping him around, his chest slamming into the wall and even though Cas has turned his head to the side, he cannot see Dean behind him, can no longer feel his touch. "Don't move" Dean growls as he tries turning his head more, a chill of anticipation running through his body. It seems like an eternity before he hears anything, and when he does, its the unmistakable click of a bottle being opened. Cas bites his lip to hold back the moan that builds in him. Another eternity passes as Cas waits the 30 seconds for Dean to touch him, and when he does Cas can no longer hold in the moan. Dean's cool, lube slicked fingers run over his opening, pushing into him with ease. Cas' body adjusts to the intrusion quickly, his ass pushing back onto his fingers greedily in no time. Which only serves to elicit a delicious laugh from Dean in his ear. Cas whimpers at the sudden loss of Dean's fingers, but doesn't have to wait long before he feels the hand one hand on his hip pulling him back, as the other hand pushes down on his back so he's braced against the wall with his ass sticking out. Cas once again tries to look back at Dean and feels a harsh smack on his ass when he does. A surge of pleasure and pain runs through his body and he's not sure how he's able to keep standing as his knees wobble. Suddenly Dean's touch is gone again, but before he can protest, Cas feels the tip of Dean's cock pressing into him, and nothing else in the world matters except this. The light burning pinch of his puckered hole stretching around Dean's thick cock sends chills through his body, and its too much and not enough all at the same time. He doesn't realize he isn't breathing until Dean slides all the way into him and he lets the air that's burning in his lungs out. Dean holds himself still, his thick cock filling him completely, but when Cas rolls his hips, Dean sets a brutal pace. Thrusting in and out of him with such force that Cas' fingers grasp at the wall for purchase, his chest slamming into the wall over and over. The hand on his hip grips him tightly, and Cas smiles knowing there will be bruises left for him to admire. Dean's other hand moves up his back into his hair, pulling his head back, his mouth licking and sucking on Cas' ear as he pants heavily. "Cas" Dean's ragged voice says as he almost viciously fucks him against the wall, making him bite his lip holding onto his orgasm. "Cas" he hears again, the passion leaving his voice, being replaced with concern and a hint of irritation. "CAS!"
Just then Darla came bounding into the kitchen, wearing a beautiful cream colored lacy dress. She swirled around as Castiel stood up. "Darla, sweetie, you look so beautiful."
Dean furrows his brow slightly "So, am I just going to drive aimlessly, or are you going to tell me where you're staying?"
"Yes, get out of here. But you owe me big time!"
The anticipation was racing through Castiel's body and he began to shake as he reached out and placed his hand on Dean's arm. He smiled at him nervously as he closed the last inches between them, their bodies now flush against one another. Castiel let out a soft shaky sigh as Dean wrapped his arm around his lower back and pulled him in closer and took his mouth with his own. His tongue sliding out and over Castiel's lips gently before he parted them allowing Dean entry.
"Castiel Novak hasn't had an effect on my panties in a very long time" Dean says as he finishes his beer. "But, I would be willing to bet that Miss Dorothy from marketing over there is very much having an effect on yours right now."
"I need... Cas... please... can I..." Dean's voice was shaking, as he was still coming down.
When he reached Dean's room he saw the clothes that he had left laying on the bed. Castiel sat down on the edge of the bed for a moment. Trying to wrap his head around the events of the last 12 hours. When he had stopped by last night, he hadn't thought that he would be still here in the morning, let alone everything else that had happened, and most certainly not the promise of what was yet to come this day. He felt his heart swell in his chest, he didn't know that this was what he wanted. Dean, yes, of course he wanted Dean. Those feelings had been developing for awhile, but he thought they were purely physical. Dean was a gorgeous specimen, those green eyes and those perfect lips. The way his tongue rested just behind his slightly parted teeth when he smiled... Oh and those crinkles around his eyes... Not to mention, the man has an amazing ass... Castiel sighed. But these other feelings revolved around Dean as a dad. The way he was when Darla was around, so open and loving. That little girl was his everything, and now he was sharing that part of his life with Castiel. Waking up this morning and sharing in the joys of Christmas morning with them. That was more than he could have hoped for, and he would be lying if he said he wasn't hoping for many more years of it.
Until then,
She giggled and took his hand, pulling him toward the tree "Come see what else I got Castiel" Castiel willingly followed where she pulled him, watching as she swooped down grabbing her gifts and telling him about them. Dean had moved to the couch, it was his turn to watch. When Castiel looked at him, he saw a softness to his face that was reserved for Darla, one of love and admission, only Dean wasn't just watching Darla, he was looking at him too. Castiel got lost for a moment looking at Dean, when all of a sudden Darla squealed. "Oooh! Daddy look!" both sets of eyes quickly moved to the little girl who had a huge smile on her face and was pointing above Castiel's head. He knew in an instant that he had once again stopped under the mistletoe. "Mistletoe Castiel! You know what that means right?" she giggled.
"I find your room more comfortable than mine. I thought since you weren't here, I would just sleep here. But now that your back, I can go back to my room, so you can get some sleep." Cas stood up. "I'm sure you're tired"
"Why?"
"Are you tired now? Do you need to rest?"
Castiel takes a step back. He most certainly wasn't expecting that. "Dean, I don't know what to say. I'm deeply flattered that you feel that way about me. Things will be ok. You will find someone at your new school, who is more apropriate age for you."
Cas has moved a little closer and when the chorus plays for the third time, Cas catches Dean face in his hand, tilting it toward his and starts singing, just loud enough that Dean can hear, "That you will be mine, by taking our time." Cas leans in and brushes his lips against Dean's. When Dean's lips part in a soft gasp, Cas presses into him, running his tongue along his bottom lip.
Dean kissed him again "and again?" another kiss "and again?"
Dean leaned back, arms on Cas' shoulders again and looked into his eyes. He leaned in and ran his tongue over Castiel's lips, slowly and softly wetting them, before pushing further into his mouth and pressing their lips together in their first kiss. Dean moved his hands up to either side of Cas' face and held him there as his tongue pushed and probed, in his mouth.
He had gotten home late tonight because, while only Cas was working, Jimmy had been there too and they held their record breaking conversation at an hour and forty five minutes. In all actuality Dean was replaying the conversation in his mind rather than watching the movie playing on the screen before him. Dean thought he heard a soft knock on the door and paused the movie. Listening carefully he heard the knock come again, this time a little louder. As he got up to see who could possibly be knocking at his door at 10:30 on a Wednesday evening, he heard whispered voices on the porch, he recognized them both. When he opened the door the twins both looked at him and smiled their biggest smiles at him.
Castiel's hands were now wrapped around Dean, pushed below the waistline of his jeans kneading his ass, pulling him in closer. In a smooth motion, after deciding, there were entirely too many layers between them, Castiel moved his hands over Dean's hips, catching the hem of his shirt and running them up the length of his torso, forcing Dean back he pulled the shirt over his head. He took advantage of the situation by leaning forward and taking Dean's nipple into his mouth, at first slowly rolling his tongue over the pink flesh until it was hard, then taking it between his teeth, biting down gently. Dean groaned loudly, grabbing the back of Castiel's head and pulling him in closer holding him there. Castiel opened his mouth wider and succeed hard, running his tongue over the hard nipple until Dean was whimpering. He then moved his mouth to the other, while still tweaking the first with his fingers. It was only after he had reduced Dean to a quivering moaning mess that he moved on, kissing and nibbling his way down his stomach, dropping to his knees before him. He ran his tongue over the skin above the denim waist band, then grabbing Dean's ass and pulling him into his face, Castiel mouthed over the front of his jeans, where Dean's dick was impossibly hard trapped just beneath the denim.
Dean kisses Cas' with a slow passion that leaves them both panting for air when he pulls away. He smiles softly, running his hands over Cas' body. "I've wanted to touch you for so long Cas" Dean says looking into his eyes.
They were sitting another diner in yet another nameless town when Castiel popped in sitting next to Dean, who had just finished his burger. A smile crept across his face as he looks at the disheveled Angel sitting next to him.
Dean bit his lips, nodding his head... only managing to whimper "Please" before Cas stood behind him, unbuckling his belt, and pulling his pants to his ankles in a quick smooth movement. He spread his legs as far as he could and Cas reached one hand around grabbing his hard cock, stroking it fast as he snaked his other hand between his ass cheeks, his long finger teasing the puckered ring of muscle. Dean groaned again, pushing back into the touch, and Castiel pushed the tip of his finger into his ass.
That had been almost a month ago, try as he might, Dean had not been able to convince Cas to listen to a different song. He was stuck on this one, listened to it on constant repeat, depleting the battery, and getting irritated that he couldnt listen to it as it charged. Dean had picked up a docking station, but was afraid to let Cas know, because as much as Dean loved the song, he didn't want to listen to it over and over.
"Cas, seriously, there's no way Nora pays you enough to practically be living there. Besides, you've had kind of a rough night. Let me take you home so you can get some sleep."
"I have no where else to go Dean. You kicked me out remember?" Cas said lightly, but once he said the words out loud an angry fire began to burn in him, and he couldn't stop. "You left me stranded, I've done the best I can, and now you're here telling me it isnt good enough. Well, Fuck you Dean, I'm trying. I'm alone, the world is a cold place, and you, you shoved me out here alone." He hated the harshness his voice carried, but it needed to be said. "Just take me back to the gas station and go on your way. I'm no longer your problem." He shifted in his seat away from Dean and looked back out the window. Waiting for Dean to either say something, or simply start driving again. He did the latter.
Enjoy!
A soft gentle kiss, followed by many smaller ones as he worked his mouth down his jaw, to his neck, then a bite on his shoulder, a soft graze of teeth on his collar bone once again. Moving down his chest his lips grazed over Cas' nipple teasingly. He took it into his mouth sucking gently then biting down just hard enough to make Cas' breath catch as he arched his back up into him. Cas' fingers found heir way into Dean's hair, gently pulling as Dean continued worrying his nipple, until it was sensitive.
Dean shakes his head, "I'm going to do more than that " he says running his hand down Cas' body, pulling his leg up and he sits back. Dean grabs a small bottle of lube, seemingly from thin air and snaps the lid open, squirting a generous amount onto his cock, rubbing it all over before pressing his fingers into Cas with ease. Cas bites his lip holding back a moan. Dean's other hand grabs Cas' chin making him looks at him. "Dont' hold back, I want to hear you" he says crooking a finger and grazing Cas' prosatate for the first time.
Here he was now, in his hometown, had just spent the afternoon with his dear friend and her family, watching the kids decorate cookies for Santa and chit chatting about what was new in their lives. He couldn't help but smile at the wide eyed innocence of the children completely enthralled in their decorating. He thought back to his own childhood, remembering the joy and wonder that came with this time of year, wondering how and when it had all disappeared for him. Normally this time of year was still magical for him, but for some reason, this year he just couldn't get into the spirit. Everything had seemed like a chore, and he hadn't even decorated his new apartment this year, not a single decoration went up.
"Relax Dean" Cas continued to pepper kisses over his neck and lightly ran his tongue over the bite marks he had left.
Castiel couldn't help but chuckle to himself every time he heard the knock on the door, it had all become so routine. Dean would come over, and get straight to work doing little odd cleaning jobs around the house while Castiel worked in the kitchen, making the dough and filling for Dean's pie. And though he had no doubt Dean could have eaten the whole pie to himself Castiel was insistant that he share the pie with his family.
D- peppermint mocha
"OK Dean, Thank you." Cas stood and made his way to the bathroom. He leaned against the door after closing it and let out a deep sigh, earlier today when Dean had shown up, he felt proud of himself for everything that he had accomplished on his own. But Dean was very good at making him realize there was still so much that he didnt know, that he wasnt handling properly on his own. He knew Dean didnt mean to make him feel like such a child, he was just trying to make sure Cas was taken care of. But he was still left with a feeling of helplessness, and loneliness. He was so cut off from everything that was familiar. When Sam and Dean had first found him and took him back to the bunker, he thought that things were going to be ok now. He might be cut off from heaven, but he'd still have his family. But then that was ripped from him too, Dean had kicked him out. Cas cried uncontrollably for hours after that, he couldnt stop, as much as he had wanted to, knowing that it served no purpose, but he just couldnt stop.
Dean opened his eyes, catching Castiel's "Oh believe me, this" he grabbed Castiel's ass and ground his hips into him letting out a low groan "This is very real"
Castiel stopped, turning back to Dean. "53 days, I'm going to be counting."
Castiel stood up, his hand slapping Dean's bare ass once, before he slowly pushed his dick into his wet ready hole. They both moaned as the tip of his cock pushed in. Cas paused a moment, but when Dean rotated his hips, he slipped the rest of the way in, and again they moaned together. Dean was lost in the sensation of Castiel filling him up, thrusting slowly.
"Was it too much?" Cas asks, still a little timid
"What the hell Dean?" Sam said suddenly and Dean snapped his head to look at him.
Castiel sat up as much as he could with Dean's fingers still in his ass and took Dean's face in his hands pulling him forward and kissing him sweetly. "No gag reflex" he winked "Over there" he nodded toward the door "Is a condom and extra lube. I need you in me now" he kissed him again before pushing him back, whimpering at the sudden loss of Dean's fingers.
Castiel opened his eyes when he felt Dean's fingers in his hair, stroking softly. He cupped his face and pulled him in for a tender kiss. "That was awesome Cas." He said softly. "Can we do it again?"
"D...Dean..." he stammers as Cas runs his hands over his ass, pulling him in closer.
Cas' body shakes again as he moans out "ughhhhhh.... Oh Dean....."
Darla had gone back to playing with her cell phone, and Castiel watched Dean as he opened his gift. "I don't even have to look at it, I know its awesome because you picked it out." Dean said as he pulled the green t-shirt out of the wrapping paper. Castiel reveled in the smile that spread across his face as he saw the image of Yoda on the front of the shirt. "Thank you Cas!"
Cas' hands had made their way down to his side, kneading and pulling on the sheets, Dean looked up at him again as he bobbed back down, taking him as deep as he could, the head of Cas' cock resting at he back of his throat. As he swallowed before coming back up he watched as Cas' eyes rolled back in his head and Dean knew without a single doubt that the angel had thoroughly enjoying that. When Dean went to pull back again, Cas grabbed his head and held him there, his hips bucking up into the hunter's mouth.
"Hey Castiel, you ok?" Jo asks as she walks by.
He heard water running in the bathroom and turned back to look as Dean walked out, stripped of his T-shirt and sweats. Cas' breath caught, he of course had seen the hunter naked before, but Dean had never been aware of his presence. There was something  about the confidence that radiated from him now that Cas found completely alluring. The way his muscles moved under his flushed skin as he slowly walked toward him. His beautiful mostly soft cock swaying between his perfectly bowed legs. This sight alone could have made him hard, if he wasn't already, but he did feel his cock twitch with desire. Mine, is all he could think.
After a while, Cas' tears subside and when he feels calm he leans back and looks up at Dean. His heart thuds loudly in his chest as he admires Dean from this angle, and the kindness in his eyes. Cas watches as Dean's tongue flicks across his lips, it happens all so suddenly, Cas hasn't even had time to think, but suddenly his lips are pressed against Dean's, his tongue searching out the taste of him. He feels Dean tense up slightly beneath him, but Cas doesnt relent. This may be his only chance to taste him, to know what Dean feels like in his arms. Dean's leaving him again anyway, so what the hell.
"I dont' care Cas, I need you inside of me." Dean pushed down, the head of Cas' cock stretching him open. He hissed at the burn.
"Castiel!" Darla cried out when she saw him through the living room doorway. He smiled taking off his shoes and walked into the living room. The tree in the corner was beautiful, Dean had the yule log with holiday music playing on the large flatscreen hanging on the wall.
But then years later Cas gets a knock on his door and 20 year old Dean pushes him against the wall and says "I'm ready for my grown up kiss now, Mr. Novak" and then he fucks Cas until they're both shaking and screaming.
Castiel laid back on the counter and let the sensations of Dean's magical fingers take over him. With every thrust Dean was hitting that bundle of nerves and Castiel wasn't sure how much longer he'd last if he kept that up. "Dean" he whined "More, please... more" Castiel pushed his ass back into Dean's hands and hissed when he felt a third and then a fourth finger thrust into him.
Cas moves quickly up to Dean and grabs his hand with the remote in it. "No Dean, please, let it play. I want to listen to it with you again." Cas looks at Dean with pleading eyes.
The gentle pressure of Dean's lips on his cock was almost too much and Castiel couldn't help the twitch of his hips,  seeking more contact.  Dean looked up,  running that delicious tongue over his lips again before hooking his fingers in the waistband of Castiel's briefs, slowly pulling the fabric down, exposing Castiel's throbbing cock a centimeter at a time until it sprang free so hard that it caught Dean in the face. The sudden contact of skin made Castiel's hips thrust again,  effectively shoving his dick into Dean's face.
"Cas..." Dean mutters as he slowly pulls out of him, his breath ragged.
Dean was looking at the floor, unable to keep eye contact with Cas as he had moved closer to him. There was a long silence that hung heavy in the air. Cas got off the bed, and took Dean's hand in his. "Dean, I need you. I don't think you will ever understand how much I just need you in my life. Please stay with me tonight." Cas sighed, lifting Dean's hand to his mouth and placing a soft kiss there. "I'm going to take a moment in the bathroom, and get dressed. I hope that you will still be here when I come out, but I will understand if you decide to go. Thank you for everything you have helped me with." Cas let go of Dean's hand, walked over to the table and grabbed the bag with the new cloths Dean had picked up for him.
"I think I might be in love with Cas." Dean's eyes snapped up to look at his brother as he tried to process the words that had just come out of Sam's mouth. They were sitting at the table in the library in the bunker.
"I wouldn't want to intrude on your morning with Darla. This is special family time. " Castiel started to back away.
"AAHHHH DEAN!" Castiel screamed as his orgasm ripped through him, he thrust himself up into Dean's torso as Dean contained to thrust into him, fucking him through his orgasm. Dean thrust a half a dozen times more and then Castiel felt his cock swell in his ass as Dean thrust in as far as he could, a deep moan breaking over his lips as he collapsed on top of him, heaving heavy breaths.
"53 days" Castiel sighed
He swooped down gathering her into his arms and lifting her up. "I sure do! It means you owe me a kiss!" he teased, sending her into another giggling fit. She puckered her lips and gave him a big wet smack on the cheek. "Well that just might be the best kiss I've had in quite some time" he said, putting her back down giving her a wink.
Cas shakes his head "I'll just tell you to stop if its too much"
"n...no.... more..." Dean moans, hitching his hips into Cas' still pumping hand.
"I knew it!" Charlie exclaims a little too loud, she was on her third drink in the last hour, and she wasn't exactly a heavy weight, especially when it came to tequila.
"Oh Cas, the things  you do to me. *ugn* " Dean moans, grinding his hips back into Castiel. "Can I do them to you?" Dean bites his lip, "Please Cas? I want ... I just want to make you feel good"
"Fuck!" Dean growled. Taking a quick moment to take off his own pants that were still gathered around his ankles. Watching with envy as Castiel fucked himself back on his own fingers. Dean didn't take his eyes off Cas fingers as they pumped in and out of his greedy ass, he simply stepped forward and added one of his own delighting in the sounds that came from Castiel as he hooked his finger finding that magical button on his first try. Castiel's hips bucked up into him as his own fingers pulled out and gripped his leg, spreading them wider to allow Dean full access. Dean quickly added another finger, hooking them with every thrust, grazing over Castiel's prostate.
Cas kisses his lips slowly "Just take control of me so you can have exactly what you want. " He says biting his own lip.
"Cas, you aren't a bother, I enjoy your company." Dean watched as Cas lifted his head, seeing a smile flicker at the corner of his mouth. "Hey, I was going to listen to some music, just to unwind. You wanna listen with me?"
I have been thinking of this story for quite awhile, and while the basis is still there, it went a completely different way than I EVER intended it to. I ran into the problem of desperately wanting to give Dean and Cas this amazing time together, but being that it takes place during an episode, I had to hold to what was actually given to us, hence the reason we start literally in the episode. So as I was writing, I had to keep in mind what happens the morning after the scene I was trying to write. This is more difficult than I had imagined. I couldnt get myself to put it into words that they were actually together, knowing that they still aren't in the show.
"Dean" Castiel panted "too many clothes...  There's too many layers between us.  I...  I need to feel your skin on mine." Dean smiled that wicked smile, and Oh god,  Castiel never imagined that devious smile from all those years ago would be so damn sexy.  He swore he could come just by the way Dean's beautiful pouty lips twisted like that,  combined with the wild fire in his green eyes,  Castiel was lost. He knew that he belonged to Dean now.
"D...Dean....ungh" Castiel whimpered "n... Nn ... need you... Please Dean..." he begged, hitching his hips to meet Dean's thrusting fingers.
"Cas, I'm..." Dean starts, and then looks over Cas' shoulder as though trying to distance himself from the situation at hand. He sighs heavily before looking back at Cas. "I'm sorry, I can't do this. I just can't." Dean shifted, nudging Cas gently. Cas moved off him and sat on the bed, one leg pulled up to him and just watched Dean stand and walk toward the center of the room. Cas knew Dean well enough to be able to read his body language. He knew that Dean was feeling overwhelmed with everything that was going on, and he was having a hard time processing this.
"Could I borrow your ipod? I would like to continue listening to that song."
Cas shyly looked down, "I ... I wasnt sure how much we would need, and I... I wanted to make sure we had enough." Dean chuckled lightly, dropped 4 of the bottles back on the coat and stood to head back to bed. He paused a moment and ran his eyes over Cas' body. He was laying propped to one side, braced on his arm so he could watch Dean. His skin was flushed and there were marks over his body from his jawline down to his hips. His beautiful cock was laying to one side, still soft, but perfect, and Dean couldn't help but wonder what it was going to feel like inside of him. His legs were spread slightly and Dean could see he was trembling with anticipation. He bit his lip, really taking in the sight of his angel.
Cas nods his head and Dean 'tsk's his tongue. "Uh uh, I want to hear you" Deans teeth sink into his ear lobe, "do you understand?" he asks again.
Castiel chuckled, he pulled his fingers out and slapped Dean's ass. "That's my good little bitch, begging for my cock." Castiel reach between Dean's thighs running his hand over his balls and grabbing his cock "Damn Dean, didnt think you'd be this hard already. You  must really be wanting it." He stroked the length a few times before letting go, moving his hand back to Dean's ass and pushing his hips down into the bed. "Gonna take my cock and come untouched? How does that sound? Want me to fuck you so hard that your dick bursts?" Castiel ran his arms up Dean's body, lining his own up with him, whispering the dirty words in his ear. He ran his tongue over the shell before taking Dean's mouth into his own. "You ready for me Dean?"
When Cas' thrusts became erratic and Dean could tell he was close, he placed one hand on his hip and pushed him down into the bed. His other hand gripped the base and began to work his cock with his hand and his mouth focused on the sensitive tip. He could hear Cas' breathing growing more and more ragged, and the Angel's eyes kept flitting closed as he was losing himself.
Castiel's hands began to move up his body under his shirt. Jimmy pulled his lips from Dean's and reality crashed in. Dean stepped away trying to regain composure. He stood looking at these two young men, who were looking at her with nearly identical faces eyes heavy with such passion and couldn't help wanting to indulge in this fantasy. But he pushed those lustful thoughts aside "Ok, guys... you really need to go. We can't do this." He took another step back, away from the temptation.
"By watch a movie, do you mean make out like horny teenagers?" Castiel quipped, then bit his lip, shocked that he had actually said it.
Dean kissed him sweetly on the corner of his mouth. "Yes, but I am so happy for it."
so I am pretty sure theres only going to be one more "chapter" after this... Didnt work on it like I planned to this week, but inspiration came this morning so I just sat and wrote. Hope yall like it... and thanks so much for reading along and encouraging me to write more!
" you shouldn't touch me like that Dean" Castiel stopped right before Dean, his blue eyes burning into him
Darla looked from Dean to Cas "Yea Cas, please, will you stay? We're making cookies for Santa."
"Cas..." Dean breathed out softly. "Please, baby, I wanna touch you."
"well, consider that done Cas, I just fucking came in my pants, from a single touch."
Dean hooked his finger under his chin, tilting it back up, meeting his eyes."I'm not judging you Cas. I would like to know what the deal is though, seeing as I find myself in the middle of it now."
He heard Sam slide his chair out from the table and walk around. He bent over by Dean, grabbing the keys to the Impala. "I think you guys have some things to discuss... I'll be out late."
Dean bites his lip running his hand over Cas' lace clad ass "This isn't for me?" he almost pouts
Castiel smiled "Jimmy is a very greedy bottom, he would never top me. And I've only been with one other guy." he leaned in pressing his lips to Dean's ear and whispered "And while I loved making you my bitch, I wanna see if you can give as good as you get" he nipped at Dean's ear before stepping back, a mischievous grin spread across his lips.
When she heard him stirring behind her she quickly got up and ran over to him with the biggest smile on her face and her eyes full of sparkle. "Castiel! It's Christmas! Look,  Santa came!" she said jumping around.
(I was typing fast,so please excuse spelling errors)
I miss you every day, and I REALLY miss your pie. Seriously dude, you make THE BEST PIE EVER! I hope all is well and that you like your new neighbors, but don't make them pie, save that for me. Because I am coming back to you Mr. Novak. I am coming back and when I do I want your best pie. And I want my grown up kiss!
Their stomachs were slick with precum from Deans dick trapped between them. It was all too perfect, Dean couldnt decide which felt better, his slick cock between them, or Cas' hard cock sliding in and out of him, deliciously hitting his prostate on every thrust. He knew it wouldnt be much longer... he felt the warm pooling in his abdomen.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Dean..."
Jimmy didnt even need to think, he walked over to another shelf and grabbed the movie. He started to bring it to Dean for approval.
"I think I would very much enjoy that Dean." Cas' smile widened.
"Oh, yea... " Cas sat up wildly looking around the room. "Where's my coat, I have some in my coat."
~Scorpions
He turned around as Dean sighed an licked his lips, Cas froze, suddenly really taking in the sight before him. Dean was wearing the kind of blue jeans that hugged his ass and thighs perfectly, his light blue and green plaid button up lay open revealing the tight white t-shirt he wore under it. Cas felt a lump catch in his throat as he tried to swallow.  Dean looking at him when the those green eyes, his eyebrow cocked. If one had asked,  Castiel would not have been able to say why he did it, but suddenly he was on his knees between Dean's, pushing them further apart gently.
As much as Cas desperately wanted Dean, needed Dean. He didnt want to force Dean to do anything he wasnt ready for. "Dean, it's ok. I'm not expecting anything from you. I would still like for you to stay with me, but it doesn't have to anything more than that."
When Cas walked out of the room, he looked around, but Dean was not back yet. Not sure what to do with himself in just his towel, he decided to lay down on the bed and wait for Dean to return. He must have been more tired than he realized, closing his eyes just for a moment, he fell asleep, not even hearing the door open, when Dean returned. Before he opened his eyes, he heard the soft voices coming from the TV, he rolled over and cracked his eyes, the only light in the room was coming from the tv, and he could just barely make out Dean laying on the couch. "Dean?" he asked softly.
"Yay!" Darla exclaimed, coming up next to Castiel and taking his hand. "Are you coming with us Castiel?"
Dean looked up into Castiel's face, he shifted his body, straddling his waist. "Go slow, its my first time." Dean said softly against Castiel's ear as he started to lower himself down, the tip of Castiel's cock pressed against his opening.
*Blue, a bright blue that creeps in slowly, taking over everything I see. There's a slight flutter in my stomach, a shiver runs up my spine as my heart begins to race. The air in the room thickens and it becomes hard to breathe. 'Focus' I tell myself, willing my heart to stop trying to break out of my chest. A bead of sweat breaks out on my brow as the blue looks my way, blood rushing to my ears as they set on fire. For a moment I lose everything, staring back into the blue. I swallow thickly, startled back to reality as a bell rings and other colors come flooding in. The air thins, I can breath again and my heart settles back into its rhythmic 'thump thump' as I regain control.*
There lips were barely separated when Cas grabbed the back of Dean's head with one hand, pulling him back into his mouth, as the other wrapped around his waist, pulling their bodies together. Cas' tongue aggressively pushed it's way into Dean's mouth, and he swore he actually saw sparks as his warm tongue touched his for the first time. There was no hesitation as Dean let Cas take control of the kiss. 'God, I'm such a girl' he thought as he moaned into Castiel's mouth, his own arms wrapping around Cas.
Castiel saw movement out of the corner of his eye and turned to see Dean standing in the doorway just watching. His eyes were soft and a gentle smile played across his lips. Those soft, beautiful lips, and all at once Castiel could feel himself blush at the memory of how those lips felt against his own.
"Dean, what are you doing? Where are we going?" Cas stammers, shocked but keeping up with Dean as he pulls him down the hallway toward his room.
"Praise indeed" Dean says running his hands up over the corset, "You know, as sexy as this looks on you..." He says popping a button open. "I think I'd rather see more of you" he pops another button and slowly unlaces it, loosening it enough to slide down over Cas' hips, being sure to unfasten the fishnets first. He settles back between his thighs, fingers running over the skin on his chest, catching his nipples between his fingers, pinching them lightly. He smiles as Cas lets out a moan. He leans forward taking the other into his mouth, running his tongue over it before sucking hard then nibbling it as he pinches the other one harder.
Dean's eyes went wide when he heard John calling for him. It meant it was time to go. Castiel quickly cut the rest of the pie and put the pieces in individual containers for the trip. when they reached the door Dean stopped and turned to Castiel. "Mr. Novak?" He said, his pubescent voice cracking. "I need to tell you something" He cast his eyes toward the floor. "I... I'm going to miss you"
"I always have Dean." Cas nods
"Merry Christmas!" She exclaimed as she ran around the car to get in.
He looks up at her with wide eyes. "y..You want me to read it aloud?" he stammers
"what's going... " Sam started before Cas interrupted
Cas is a writhing moaning mess, Dean's name falling like a prayer off his lips, breath catching a little as Dean's fingers push into him.
Castiel meanwhile hadn't been able to take his eyes off of Dean's amazing cock. It was seriously the most beautiful penis he had ever seen. Utter perfection, and Castiel absolutely could not wait to touch it. When Dean moved over him Castiel grabbed his thick hard cock as Dean kissed him. His thin fingers wrapping around him and stroking gently. Dean gasped against his mouth, he had obviously not expected that.
"Yea Cas? You want me to fuck you? How do you want me to fuck you?" Dean continued to tease his tongue around the puckered ring of muscle, his fingers ghosting touches over the head of his cock. Dean could feel the Cas' desperation growing, as he begged for more.
So here they are sitting in this nice restaurant, Dean trying not to be disgusted with his "date" and his rude, crass comments. Especially about and to their waiter, a very attractive man with blue yes and dark hair, and the most beautiful full lips he'd ever seen. Sure, he was thinking about how amazing those lips would be pressed against his, and how they would look wrapped around his cock, but he would never state it out loud, especially to the guy. Crowley was a rude pompas ass, and Dean was silently cursing Sam for getting him into this mess. Half way through their meal, after countless remarks, their waiter was changed for a young blonde woman, and the remarks stopped. Crowley didn't have much left to say, and Dean was tired of trying to keep a conversation going with someone who was literally making him sick to his stomach. He set down his fork and excused himself to the restroom.
Dean's mouth hung slightly agape as he looked down at Cas as he ran hands ran up his thighs, his eyes locked on Dean's green ones. Cas could faintly hear a voice on the other end of the phone, but Dean seemed to have lost all interest in the conversation he was supposed to be having. He popped the button on Dean's jeans, and slowly pulled the zipper down. Dean's eyes flicked to Cas' hands and then back to hold his gaze once again.
Castiel smiles, "no rush. take your time."
Castiel chuckled "Yes Dean, again and again, until neither of can even move.... and then we'll do it one more time just for the fun of it." Castiel kissed him deeply, shifting his body to lay more comfortably snuggled against Dean's. They lay their kissing sweetly for a while, when Castiel suddenly remembered... "Pie"
So ever since I watched Season 9 episode 6 "Heaven Can't Wait" for the first time I wondered something... What happens between the scene where Dean and Cas are leaving Nora's house after defeating Ephraim, and the next scene where Dean is dropping Cas off at the Gas and Sip.
"Gee Cas, how did you know she liked those books? they are two of her favorite series. What did you do go to the library and check her records?" Dean chuckled.
"You don't have to try hard" Dean says as he walks to the side of the bed picking up the box Cas had given him. He pulls out the riding crop and smacks it against his hand. It makes a sharp snapping noise that fills the room. "oooh, this should be fun" He teases, running the leather down Cas' leg. "do we need a safe word?" he asks.
He pulls the band of the boxers down, exposing the stretch of skin over bone there, and softly runs his lips over it. Sticking his tongue out, tasting the soft salty taste of Cas just before he sinks his teeth in and sucks another mark to the surface. Cas' hips rise up into him, and dean can feel his erection hit him in the chest. That's all the distraction he needs to pull away from Cas' hips.
"Even without my grace I can feel you Dean. I feel your longing, and I wanted to comfort you. I didn't know that this was what you were longing for though. I could have never dreamed this." he smiles softly.
All Cas can think about is Dean fucking him. He wants him to grab him hard by the nape of his neck and throw him against the wall. To then crash his body against him, shoving him harder into the wall. Wants Dean's thigh to part his as he grinds his body against him, seeking the friction they both desperately desire. He want Dean's perfect pink lips to smash into his dry ones, kissing him brusingly hard, tongue thrusting into his mouth until they are both panting , gasping for air. Cas wants Dean to rip his clothes off and kiss lick and bite his way down his body, leaving a trail of marks that he will be able to see for days. So he can stand in front of the mirror and trace his fingers over them and remember...
"What is it Cas?"
"C..Cas..." Dean moans "More...please...ngh" he begs
"mmmm.... Dean... I like Dean" Cas says in his low sexy voice sending chills through his body. "So tell me Dean, what would you like me to do to you tonight?"
Dean returned the smile "There's a t-shirt and some sweatpants laying on my bed if you wanted to change."
"Yes Mr Novak?" Dean said against his neck, licking and biting the tender skin there.
"Knew what Cas?"
Dean knocks his hand away, catching Cas' eyes with his. "That's mine Cas, as long as I have you like this, you cannot touch. You'll make me jealous, the only pleasure I want you to receive is by my hands..." Dean dips his head back down and takes one of Cas' balls into his mouth, rolls his tongue over it and then pulls his head back, sucking with a loud plop. "or my mouth. Do you understand?" He looks up at Cas again, with a smirk
Cas breathes in a sharp gasp as his body jerks and he bites his lip. Dean drops them on the bed beside them, reaching up and running his thumb over Cas' bottom lip. "I told you, I want to hear you. Don't hold back" his hand drags back down his body, running over his nipple again before he leans forward swirling his tongue over the hot skin, then lightly blows over the wet skin.
When Dean finished his chores he would come into the kitchen and visit with Castiel. Telling him about school, what subjects were his favorite, which ones he struggled with. He'd tell him about his friends, and the funny things that Sammy would do. Then he'd ask Castiel about himself, his family, where he grew up. where he had gone to college.
Dean couldnt help but smile. "Yea Cas, its ok that you kissed me."
He let out another little moan as his hips began moving, slowly in small circles to start, but soon he was lifting his hips up and slamming them back down, spearing himself on Castiel's cock so hard and fast Castiel nearly forgot how to breathe. Dean's soft moans turned into needy desperate ones as he pushed Castiel down onto his back and rode him at a full gallop.
Cas just wants Dean to fuck him, but thats not what he gets.
"that dream again?"
"That's good" Castiel smiled up at Dean, who returned the smile with a soft one of his own.
"Hey Cas" Dean said taking a step forward. Cas obviously was going to ignore what had just happened, hell, maybe he hadnt woken up til after he put his pants on any way. Either way, Dean was more than happy to move on. "Not that I mind, but why are you sleeping in here? Don't you like your room?"
There was a moment of silence in the car as they drove, heading back to Dean's place. Castiel was reveling in the peace that had some over him when he felt warmth on his hand. He snapped his head sideways looking down as Dean took his hand to his own. "I couldn't imagine sharing this night with anyone else. Thank you for coming along." Dean smiled giving Castiel a wink before turning his head back toward the road.
Timid at first Dean presses slowly, until the head of his cock breaches Cas' rim, he lets out a gasping moan at the same time the other men do and he pushes harder, sliding all the way home. Cas' lets out the dirtiest sexiest moan he has ever heard in his life and he leans in biting on his ear as he slowly starts rocking his hips. His cock sliding against his own inside the fallen Angel's perfect ass.
The older him licks at Cas' ear and asks "Which one of us angel?" he asks his voice thick with lust.
Dean looks up at him, "how often do you come in my room at night Cas?"
Once again Dean trails his hand down the length of Castiel's body, slowly, deliberately as if memorizing every inch of him. When his hand reached Cas' cock, he gives it a small amount of attention before slipping further down and teasing Cas' hole once again, and Cas moans, hips raising to meet his gently pressing fingers.
"First things first tiger,  we don't want you going off again just yet" he said reaching under Dean sliding the cock ring into place.  Dean groans,  hitching his hips into Cas' touch,  which warrants another harsh slap on his ass.  "greedy boy" Cas chides him as he smacks him again, Dean moaning even louder.
"oh, shit" Dean gasped and Castiel let go of his hands, shoving Dean's chest into the bed and thrusting hard and fast into him. The sound of skin slapping skin filling the room along with Dean's moans and Castiel's heavy breathing. Castiel took a deep breath and leaned back down, taking Dean's mouth again, their tongues tangling together as he continued to thrust into him. Breaking the kiss, Castiel leaned back, gripping his lower back for leverage as he slowly pumped into Dean's tight ass.
"How bad do you want me Dean?" Castiel murmered "You want me to split you open?"
Dean inched closer, trying to listen to Cas' singing. He had been trying to hear him sing for weeks now. But somehow Cas always knew when he was around, and stopped. Dean held his breath, trying to be as quiet as possible, but today was no exception. "Hello Dean" Dean froze at the sound of Cas' voice.
Dean was the only person who could make him feel safe, even when the world was literally falling apart around them. And especially now that Cas no longer had his grace and was vulnerable in ways he never was before. And even though Dean had kicked him out of the bunker after rescuing him from April without so much as an explanation. Dean was the only reason Cas got up everyday and trudged forward with his now seemingly meaningless, mundane life as a sales associate at the Gas n Sip.
Cas turned and walked down the sidewalk toward the classic black car waiting for him. Dean was standing on the other side of the car, on his phone. When he turned to face him, Cas felt warmth and comfort wash over him. Things had been so hard for him lately, at times he was afraid he wouldn't be able to make it on his own. Even though he hadn't been happy to see him when he'd shown up unannounced at the Gas n Sip earlier, he was most assuredly glad that Dean was here now.
"I don't have time today, I'll take a look tomorrow and let you know" She says walking to the door. "I'll also send you a new list of tasks to be taken care of."
Dean let out a low groan and pushed Castiel back into the counter "What if I desire to have you on this here counter? "
Dean gets more than he bargained for when the twin brothers from the video store show up at his door one night for an impromptu Movie Club meeting.
Dean sighs softly, a smile pulling his lips before his kisses the angel's again. "The lube Baby, its right beside you, take it and squeeze some on my fingers. "
