And Jarvis did mute, and tony went into his shower to clean up. After the shower tony decided to go to bed he sore and tired, and as he lay there he thought of the next encounter with Rogers will be like, what does this mean for him and for Rogers? will things change for the better?. And if sex is the answer then fine he can be a whore, he’s been one before and he can do it again, he’s fine ok he’s fine.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So what you telling me Stark that you went out and got fucked by someone” Steve accuses. He continues “Tell me, are they in your penthouse, you said you came down here to get food we’re going to make them breakfast how sweet” he mock that’s when Tony got mad, despite them not knowing that Tobias is the one who is up in his penthouse, he feels like Steve is disrespecting his son and he won’t allow that.
Once Tony was dress, he went to the kitchen were everyone shared to grab a quick cup of coffee before he leaves. Once his coffee was ready, he took the cup and the smell of strong African coffee beans was beautiful.
“But his attitude is poor and disrespectful, the things he calls me and the others is like bullying, he is a bully” he defended weakly.
“Men un-cuff him” Daniel ordered, the henchmen rush to both sides of the bed and Daniel approach slowly towards Tony and this scared him a little bit. With a sickly smile Daniel spoke “it’s now time for to face centre stage my dear, I hope you’re ready” Daniel grins even wider and with that the henchmen grab Tony’s arms and drag out of the room with there boss being them. Tony didn’t want to go with to the unknown, he wanted to scream, to fight back but he couldn’t act recklessly now. He needed an opening and hope to god that the others will get here soon, they got closer to a door, Daniel opened it and turned to Tony “this is gonna be fun, we’ll for me anyways” he mocks with that smiles again at Tony, which made him shiver in disgust. He opens the and that’s when Tony notice that they are now in a lab, in the centre of the room there’s a chair, that could look like it can be move into a medical bed. There was equipment everywhere scaples, needles, saws everything that would see from a horror movie, it looked terrifying to Tony, he needed to get out of hear and fast.
“Sir is sleeping at the moment, he was quite exhausted after your activities from this evening” Jarvis said vaguely not giving too much information.
One by one all the Avengers got out of the limousine, and the press went crazy screaming their name taking photos of everyone. Tony was use to this, he knew what to do, where to turn and how to smile when it comes to the press. Tony even made sure he got photos with the Avengers and he reassured them when he sense they were nervous, surprisingly the spy twin calm down from this comfort and even Rogers too.
“Ok thank you Jarvis” Steve whispered
Steve wasn’t sure what to think, Fury never spoken about Stark with this much passion. So maybe Fury is on to something and Steve will need to see it too.
He sighed and looked back at his dad and continued “so I got worried and went down here to see what was going on. I.. ur... heard what he said about you and it just made me so angry that he would say such lies about you so here we are” he finishes. Tony was mad but also worries that Tobias expose himself to his teammates but at the same time he was proud of him for standing up for him.
Tony smiled, the biggest smile you’ll ever seen, maybe today isn’t going to be shit, he gets up and brings the phone up to his ear, “Hi Bambi” he simply said yeah to is going to be good.
Hope everyone is having a good day and I’ll see you all soon 😁
A few seconds later a white light wraps around Tony. Thor and Steve were both amazed, but then the light disappears and Tony open his eyes. Thor give a giant grin “Anthony I can sense you have change you did it” he said with proudness in his voice.
There was a slight awkward silence until Rogers speaks, “come on guys let’s go before press start thinking we change our minds” then Rogers was the first one to get out of the limousine.
[Back in the common room]
Tony reach out and manage to grab the handle, then everything went white. The world around him felt warm like he belonged here, he could see into things, the past of sorts. Seeing people fighting, protecting and loving other people and their homes, their world. The things he could see were not from earth but from a different world all together could this be Asgard Tony wondered. He felt power seeping around him, it felt familiar to him, felt like home to him.
“What the hell are you doing in here” he heard himself say.
~~~~~~~~~
Daniel let’s go and pats lightly on Tony’s cheek, “good boy now that is enough question I won’t answer the other it’s getting boring now so I’ll be leaving to prepare for you experiment. And don’t worry darling it won’t hurt much I promise I’ll come and collect you in an hour” he spoke softly so kiss Tony on the cheek. Then he gets up and leaves toward the door.
“Oh ok, but thanks point break I owe you one” he said with gratitude.
Once time has passed the paramedics checked on both Clint and Natasha and also the other agents. Clint was fine just a few bruises and scraps l, where as Natasha needed to go to the hospital to fix her shoulder and the burns on her legs.
Steve felt that annoyance again every time Stark speaks to him like that, like he’s dumb. With a snare “that was not what I meant Stark, I mean what are you in here at this time. It’s 2:30 in the morning, why aren’t you asleep you look like you need it stark or have been binging in the lab again”
He breathes heavily and with tears running down his face he didn’t even realise he was crying. “Why Howard, hmm tell me why you left me and for fuck sake don’t beat around the bush and tell me why you’re in my fucking mind?” He questions to his father.
“Shut. Up. Now!” Rogers warned his face was so close to Tony’s, that tony can feel the heat of Rogers breath.
So here he is now nursing his drinking, god tony so tired he just wanted to forget today but he knows he can’t not with his eidetic memory.
Steve could only shake his head, before he decided the best thing to do was leave before things got really out of hand. He slowly walks out of Thor’s floor without saying a word to him, he continues walking in a daze until he reaches the common room, where Natasha and  Clint are sitting on the couch watching some garbage TV.
Bruce sighs in relief he’s glad that Natasha was ok. Though Bruce immediately blushes as Tony gave him a look. “What?” Bruce said to Tony, “Don’t mind me Brucie bear I’m glad you’ve found someone to keep you company” he slightly teases which made Bruce even blush harder.
Once Tony and Thor parted ways it’s was already 9am, Tony could guess that his son would be up as he is an early riser, god knows why, no way he got it from Tony that’s for sure.
Fury observe the other two, Clint was nodding along agreeing to everything that Natasha said. But Steve, he looked awkward and avoid looking at anyone.
Tony was in his bed room putting on his tux, his suit fitted just right and his beard and hair was styled perfectly. He looked down to his bed were the box that Davis gave him, he probably ask his mom tomorrow about them but for now he just grab the box and place it in his draw which is next to his bed.
~~~~~~~~~
Steve looked at the others behind Tony, Peggy looked furious and to be honest she has a right to be after that whole display. The older man looked angry as well, Steve doesn’t know who he is but he is sure he’s going to find out soon. And lastly he looked at the kid, him as well looked angry but Steve could tell he was sad as well, he that be because he is sad for Tony, his dad?.
Steve grunted down to the floor in pain, Tony stood there shaking and in shock to what just happened. Steve and Tony both turned their heads to see who did it and to Tony’s utter surprise he whispered “Tobias ”.
[two months ago]
“Ok go I’ll cover for you, I’ll talk to you later” she said gently and Tony nodded and left her there.
Fury sighed “what is it Tony?” He ask from what he heard Tony sounded scared he usually never sounded like that unless it’s something actually serious.
“Where are you going, don’t you want to defend yourself?” Rogers snared
The fingers roughly came out of his mouth “ that’s enough” Rogers spat and in one swift move he shoved his fingers into Tony’s hole.
Enjoy
This gala is not only to help SI but to help PR with the avengers too, so tonight had to be perfect no fuck ups.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
“And as for the youngster his name is Tobias James Stark Carter he’s my son, when I was raped a woman forced herself on me and she became pregnant with my child. Even though it was a traumatic experience I never once regret keeping my son he’s the best thing that came out of this” he smiles towards his Bambi and his son with tears in his eyes smiled back.
“Master Thor, is currently in his quarters. Would you like me to ask him that you want to see him?” JARVIS replied, though Steve felt that Jarvis sounded coldly towards him.
Fury raised his eyebrow and to Steve he either looked pissed or amused or maybe both. “Really, and why should I tell you?” He countered.
And for people who don’t know who Bambi is it’s Tony’s son that just a nickname that tony loves to call him by
Once Tony arrive at his penthouse, he thought about going into the kitchen first to make his son a good old fashion English breakfast that his mom use to make for him, he though it’ll be a good way to start the morning before he had the talk with his son.
They both made it to Thors room, “let us in J” Tony spoke, “of course sir” JARVIS replies and the doors slid open.
They sat down on the couch and Tobias turns to his grandmother and spoke “did you see dad?” He ask, Peggy nodded “yes darling he’s going to train with Thor, though I have a feeling that Steve might be joining them” she confesses.
But reality decided to come to him first, as his dad knock on the door and went in to his son room. His dad sat on the bed and cried and told him how sorry he was for telling him about his birth like that. Though Tobias wanted to be left alone and tell his dad to go away, however Tobias can see the pain in his dads eyes and no matter what had been said he wanted to know everything about what happen to his dad and he wanted to be there for him too.
Please feel free to comment or kudos
Chapter I will put trigger warning in them
Tony was too in shock to embrace him and just step back. “Why are you here?” He spoke with some anger in his voice. Howard stops short looking some what sad, he sighs “Well I guess that’s a fair question, your mother and I planned this before my death, I wanted to be here to help you which I failed when I was alive” he spoke and his answer confused Tony even more.
Tony gave a gentle smile back “Hi Megan, yeah I know it’s sudden but I thought I give the old girl a surprise visit. How is she today?” Tony ask nervously.
The trio all look shock at the words that Fury spoke, since when did he like Stark there was more going on here than they thought.
Tony felt so much power running through him it was overwhelming but also he felt sadness that this was the last time he’ll see his dad, he hugs his dad tightly “please don’t go please not again” he cried. Howard soothes him “oh come now don’t cry my son, you’ll be fine I wish I could stay but just remember this I love you Anthony” Howard told him and Tony felt so much love from his father like never before.
“No, not this time you dead ass woods” he mumbled to himself, usually he would run but running away seems to him ending up back to real world. So Tony decided to try a different tactic, he can hear the creature it was coming towards him, “Anthony, oh Anthony we’re coming for you” a distorted but yet a familiar voice spoke.
But anyways Tony motions the Avengers to sit, while Fury, his mom, Tobias and Davis stand.
Thor looked at Steve with shame, of course he couldn’t think of anything, Anthony will never cause a civilian any harm. “ can’t think of any examples then, let’s continue with your other accusations. You say he’s selfish, but yet who was the one to give you a home, food and safety does that sound like a selfish man to you captain” Thor sneered as he moves closer to Steve. “Will a selfish man, build you and the entire team new gear and a new suit so that it will help you in battle. Would a selfish man make sure, all the damages that we and enemies have cause to be paid for by his own money. And would a selfish man defend us and shield us from the press so that we don’t get ask difficult questions, tell me Steven is that a selfish man to you” he panted.
And Tony standing there in shock, with blurry watery eyes, he wondered who the fuck punch Captain America in the face.
Tony was surprise by the last one, he knew Davis from when he was 13, he was the detective on the case and had help the traumatised boy greatly. Then Davis was in and out of there lives, he and his mom knew each other from before. After all Peggy also trained Davis with his abilities like she did with Tony.
[10 hours ago]
Fury sighed in frustration, “both of you leave now and maybe just think about what I said and if your any damn good spy maybe you’ll see what I mean. Captain stay I think we need to talk for bit” he said with a scarily calm tone in his voice.
Thor then smirk, “ oh really, well then it will be easier for me to train you then” he said with glee.
Surprisingly Natasha spoke up next “Clint that’s enough and same to you Steve you went too far” she said with a glare. That surprises Tony, when did she decide to take his side of things.
He doesn’t know what real pain is or how to appreciate what he has, like Clint and the other do. When Clint was growing up he was poor and treated with such violence by his circus family and his own brother, Hell that was how he lost one side of his hearing from the beatings they gave him.
She showed him the photos and they talked about Anthony and the Starks and SHEILD, time went by so quickly that Fury forgot that he had to finish those files that he been working on as soon as possible. it was a shame really, enjoyed Peggy’s company she’s one of a few people that he allowed to call him Nick.
~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~
Tony froze at that moment it’s been decades since he last saw him. Daniel certainly has change, he’s gotten taller, got more muscles on him and he’s got a large scar down his right eye. Daniel finally reach the left right side of the bed, he smiled but this wasn’t a warm welcoming smile at all and Tony felt nervous.
There was silence between them for a long moment, Tony was in a daze, he hadn’t had sex like that before and he had lots of sex. But this was different, it wasn’t love or friends with benefits kind of thing. No it was pure hate mix with lust and fuck was it lust.
“(Sigh) fine let him in J”
He knock on the door and waited for a response, “come in” a warm gentle voice replied.
So you guys want to take a guess who punch Captain America?
“Now it’s not the time for jokes Stark! What hell were you playing at  last night, with that woman, the lieutenants wife no less, do you know what that could cost us. The lieutenant was not happy and the press was sniffing around, and Ms Potts had to deal with the situation herself. She had been stressing throughout the rest of the night, what do you have to say for yourself” Steve rages as he pushes Tony away from him with force. Now Tony would never admit to anyone about this, but he was scared in that moment. Sure him and Steve fight constantly, but this is a new level of anger he never seen before, and that frightened him.
Tony took a breath well that’s one revaluation done now for the rest. “Besides Peggy being my mum there’s something else about our family” he paused for a moment and looked at his mom for guidance, she nod her head as some type of encouragement and Tony continued “ we are part of a group you could say not sure what our original name was exactly called but I.. um, we have this ability were I can see things like people aura. I can see if they are being honest or liars I can sense there feelings with my eyes, I can also track people as well” he looked around the group and notice shock faces excluding Thor of course, but Natasha has a look like she was in thought, Tony had to keep an eye on her as what he was sensing she was up to something.
He sat on the couch for god knows how long, with a probably cold hit chocolate in hand. Tony didn’t what to do, he had so many questions mainly towards Fury.
Thor glared at Steve for a long moment but looks away and let’s go of him in disgust. “You’re the one who doesn’t deserve respect Captain, your not the man I thought you might be it’s disappointing” he said with sadness in his voice.
Fury groans “you know not to call me that no one calls me Nicky it’s Fury ok, Peggy Peggy come back!” But she was gone leaving Fury standing in the hallway. Fury sighed dammit why was he friends with his boss anyways he thought even though he was trying to suppress a smile.
But for now she is more curious on what’s going on between Steve and stark. They hate each other she knows that, but their behaviour has change. They don’t argue as much as they do and she even seen them walk together, but she seen the marks in stark so it’s a given that they are coping with each other in a more different way than a normal person would do, probably Starks idea no doubt.
Daniel click his tongue in annoyance, he knows the deal and he will not fail, he is determined to get what he wants, he will never fail not this time.
Steve nodded and said “I’ll try sir, I didn’t realise you care for Stark this much thought you dislike the guy” he tried to tease. But Fury didn’t see the funny side of it, “listen Rogers, I might not show but I definitely care for him more than you know, and mark my words Captain if I find out that you force him in anyway I’ll make sure you go back into that block of ice and never resurfaced for another 70 fucking years you got that” he threatened.
[Hydra Base]
Tony gave Thor a bitter look “ we are just different people, he wants me to be something I’m not and he hates me for it, which I can’t blame him for I’m what I portray to the press, to SHEILD so I don’t give him a good impression of my self” he said quietly
So with a nod to the wonder twins, the three of them set off to find fury and hopefully find some answers.
“And why should I? Why should let you stay in this team and possibly hurt Tony again, you three seem to like hurting him so why should give you another chance” he questions them all.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was then Peggy spoke up, “Steve, now it’s not the time. I think we all need a break from this and if Anthony wants to talk about it then that’s for him to decide” she said firmly not leaving room for any arguments. The she continues “But now I would like a moment with Anthony of you please leave us for a moment” she spoke firmly.
“Ur Tony what are you doing, I thought you were training” Steve naively said. Tony tried not to roll his eyes as Steve question so instead he bluntly said to Steve “this is the training Steve I need to find my soul in order to gain more access to my abilities. So if you don’t mind just stand next to Thor and zip it for a few minutes please”.
“Hang on I’m almost there”
He quickly put all the items back into the box and stood up “I have to go John I got a gala to get ready too, listen thanks for listening I’ll come back soon or you can always come to the tower any time” he quickly said.
“No Anthony, we need to go somewhere that we won’t be disturb by the others” he simply said, with that Thor lifted his hammer then there was a bright light. Tony had to cover his eyes for a second, but the light vanished and tony open his eyes to discover that he wasn’t in the work shop anymore or even the tower in general. It was a forest, there was a big open space in a shape of a circle and around them are trees, huge trees, Tony never seen anything like it before.
It was time to tell the truth about his past, but will his team believe him?
~~~~~~~
Once everything was said and done, the Avengers went ahead with there plan, Natasha and Clint went out to gather intel about what happen to Mr and Mrs Marks. Davis and Fury went to SHEILD HQ to look through Tony’s case when he was 13, to see if they can find any clues about Daniel whereabouts and his association with Hydra. Bruce went to his lab and looks at the samples that Fury has order his agents to give to him from the crime scene.
“FAIR! you want to talk about fair Stark. You know nothing about what’s fair you were raise with everything you ever ask for, you never knew about hardship or suffering” Steve rage. But then he said something that would change the situation dramatically.
A few minutes later Stark places the two large cups of hot chocolate on the counter. Steve could honestly say that this was awkward, they in silence which felt like hours. Steve didn’t know what say, and judging by Starks looks to him he didn’t know what to say either.
Thor looked at him for a moment, he was surprise how Tony is acting and it quite worried him, but if Tony wants to train now then he can ask his questions later.
Tony suddenly heard the door open again, well that was quick he thought. “When you said you’ll take a second, I didn’t think you meant it literally Steve” he laughed. Tony was expecting a laugh back but instead he got something else, someone else to be precise.
“what are you talking about point break?” Tony ask in a shaky tone. Tony had no idea what was going on, what was thor talking about, he not asgardian.
Clint saw the device and knew what it was “Natasha look out!!” He yelled whilst quickly grab her by the wrist and tried to pulled her when the large explosion threw them to the ground, everything went dark to both of them.
Now Steve tried not to get mad at Tony’s bluntness, he knows this is important to him and what the endgame is when his training is complete, so he nodded and walk next to Thor and waited.
Thor looks up at Steve and smiles “ Friend Steven, how have you been, I understand you wanted to speak with me?” Thor spoke.
Once Clint and Natasha arrived they manage to get Natasha check out quickly, the doctors pop back her shoulder and clean and bandage her burns and cut. The Doctors said that she will heal quickly but suggested to ease from fighting for a week or so until the shoulder heals properly.
That was a long time ago and things have change a lot since then, after he was rape, Tony struggled a lot and didn’t know how to cope. John back then was just a cope trying to help Tony in anyway he can and when time past and after Tony’s not so great coping mechanism. John help him with his training when his mom got ill he was there for him and his son and he will never forget what this man has done for him.
He likes Anthony, but others don’t and he knows why they don’t. Anthony puts on a mask to hide his pain, his insecurities. Thor can see it maybe because he’s a god and his mother trained him to read other beings.
“I wanted to talk you really talk to you but during the Hydra fiasco I didn’t want you to be involved and put you in danger again, so Peggy had an idea that to put a bit of me in that neckless in some what help and speak. But it was suppose to happen sooner but I guess things don’t go always according to plan”.
“Oh for fuck sake, I knew I wasn’t prep enough. Don’t worry yourself J I’ll be fine just need to clean up that’s all” tony replies
So tony sat back on to his chair and listen. Thor took a sigh and then started his tale, “a long time ago my mother love your planet and so did other people from my home, it was developing, new creatures evolved and humans expanded into something more.” Thor started to go on about how earth grew and how the human mind grew along with it. How society change and how religion was created, along with how law began. Tony listen to every thing that Thor had to say he wanted to know, about how thor, his mother and his planet are involved.
“Yeah J please tell him to meet me at my lab immediately” he said as he walk towards the elevator. “As you wish sir” Jarvis simply reply.
“Steve please”
(See the end of the chapter for
Well the whole thing went to shit when they were in the helicarriar. It all went so smoothly at first, Tony and his new bestie were sciencing, the next thing everyone was in each others face. Or more like Rogers was in Tony’s face berating him on how a selfish he was and how he wasn’t a hero, well tony can dish it out too.
There was a pause for a moment until Peggy some again “Why did you sleep with him Steve?” She ask. Steve thought for a moment and to be honest he didn’t really know himself, Yeah Steve thought once it was stress relief reasons, but was that the really reason he can’t honestly know.
The spy twins, Rogers and Bruce are chatting away except for Tony it didn’t feel like he was welcomed in the conversation. Tony felt a large hand on his shoulder, he turn to look and saw Thor smiling down at him “are you alright?” He whispered “yeah I’m good big guy just thinking that’s all” Tony replies.
It was time everything went to plan sure there were some mistakes but they manage to separate some of the Avengers from the Tower, and now it’s time for their final attack. “How long until we arrive” Daniel ask his agent “ETA will be around 15 minutes at the most sir” they replied. Good he thought not long then soon his bot will be his finally, he grins widely to himself.
The next chapter will be about the avengers opinion of stark
As Steve went to sit down he look towards Peggy and her family, he instantly felt guilty again. The looks on their faces wasn’t pleasant they all look distraught about what happened to Tony. “Um Peggy I’m so sorry I wish I was stron.......” he wanted to finish his sentence but Peggy interrupted him, “Steve it’s okay you don’t to apologise, it wasn’t your fault it was them okay not you” she told him firmly but also kindly as well. Steve felt relief at those words, he was glad that Peggy didn’t blame and she was right it was those Hydra scum who did this, but yet he still feels guilty but he can make up for it when he rescue Tony.
Steve gives back a small smile and walks to sit down next to thor. “ I’m doing well thor thanks. I wanted to speak with in regards with Stark if you don’t mind” he said bluntly.
“Sir, it’s 3:30AM. Your currently at the avenger tower in your penthouse, you are safe sir I can assure you that you are not there. Please take deep breaths...” Jarvis continues to calm Tony with his words.
Tony chuckled at his AI, he sighed and looked at the mirror one more time “Well time to rock and roll” he said to himself, he then proceeded to leave his penthouse.
After that we left MIT and went to go to Harvard and study criminal law for the next two years. Now, so far it’s going well and soon he will hopefully pass the bar exam in no time.
So again sorry for any misspellings or bad grammar but hope you enjoy
~~~~~~~~~~~
“Look Steve, I haven’t slept with anybody ok, the person I met means a great deal to me and I don’t like your tone about them so back off” but then Tony thought something else about this situation and grins even though it wasn’t his best press smile. “What is this really about Steve are you jealous that I might find someone who actually appreciates me or is it the fact that you didn’t had a good fuck in awhile?” Tony questions him. But Steve gave a dark grin, oh god why did he had to challenge him, where the fuck is Thor or even Bruce.
Throughout the rest of the night, Tony trained with the help of Thor. Thor taught him how to fight like a warrior and took him to the forest of rebirth to help locate his inner soul.
~~~~~~~~~~
Anyways sorry for any misspellings or bad grammar
Steve woke up in a gasp, sweat sticking onto his cotton shirt, tears coming down his face.
2.......
[two months ago]
Steve sighed he was too tired to fight Stark “ I couldn’t sleep either so I also wanted to get hot chocolate, Peggy once said it helps with sleep apparently, I never manage to try it out as you know the war didn’t provide that luxury. So I thought I give it a try” he said with tiredness hinted in his voice.
“Why are you telling this” He rasp, “because he said to me he was coming for you again, he talked a lot about you. He’s still obsess about you like all those years ago and he knows about ou- your son” she admits, and that panic Tony even more “WHAT!! How? Did you tell him” he voiced with fear. Lily panic “No no I swear I don’t know how he found out, but he told me he knew his name and he knew where he could be found” she told him.
Thor looked at Tony and agreed they been doing this for hours, Tony deserves a break. Thor grab his hammer, then a quick of a flash they were back in Tony’s penthouse like they were hours ago.
But instead of speaking Thor swung his hand that was holding the mjolnir and throw it towards tony and let’s go of his hammer. Tony panic, what was thor doing. He didn’t have time to think, he just stretch out his hand on instinct to prevent the hammer from dropping on the ground which could cause destruction in Tony’s work shop.
“Please, don’t treat me like a fool. Don’t try to defend your actions as that’s just pitiful at best. You want to know who’s the bully one here captain, it’s you, you’re the one who treats Anthony differently then anyone else who lives here, you’re the one and including Natasha and Clint who berates Anthony, puts him down like some dirt on your shoe. You use his body for your own selfish pleasure, but yet do you ask what Anthony wants,  no you don’t you just assume that Anthony would enjoy it or do you just don’t care if Anthony feels pleasure or pain” Thor growls.
“When I wrote that report I thought he’ll be only a consultant at best, he is nothing like a team player and when we go one our mission he ignored our Captains orders. When we’re at the tower, he doesn’t interact with us he ignore us entirely  except for Thor and sometimes Bruce. He’s arrogant, rude, disrespectful and not to mention a pervert when he flirts with everyone. No disrespect Sir but I think you made a mistake with start and I recommend that’s he’s off the team immediately” she finish her long winded rant.
Enjoy 😊
And at that point Steve didn’t really know he didn’t mean to blurt it out he was so frustrated with what’s been going on recently and he just wanted answers. Fury sighed at this mess in front of him, he hoped that Tony would have break down his walls and shown his true self, but he guess these three idiots didn’t give him a reason to do that, so he better go to plan B then.
Hope you all have a great day :)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Jesus fuck Stark, do you know what it is, I swear if this is another prank call I’ll will go to your tower and.....” “Nick please I need your help” Tony interrupted him with a plea.
Pepper sighed, “It’s ok, that happens some times, just call me ok. I was worried about you” she smiled gently to reassure him. Tony smiled back to her, grateful for her patience.
The event was a success as far as Tony was concerned, all the guest were enjoying the gala and speaking with Tony to do discuss business deals which was successful which made Pepper happy. And the guest also talk to the Avengers individually, the gang were behaving (thank god) and manage to impress the people who then provide the Avengers with their support emotionally and financially (which really wasn’t needed, but oh well it was the thought that counts in Tony’s opinion) so overall a successful night.
Steve selfishly wanted to know what is happing now but he didn’t want to scare Tony too much so he just simply said “Um Tony about earlier, I just wanted to say....” “Steve not now” Peggy interrupted him. He was surprise at how Peggy was protective over Tony, he always thought they aren’t that close due to the fact Tony doesn’t talk about her all that much, but maybe that was wrong. “But Peggy I need to...” He was going to say apologies but Peggy shut him down quickly “No you listen here Steven, you don’t give Tony a fake apology so you can make yourself feel better, there’s a difference in between saying all the right things to make someone fell better and being sincere about saying the right thing and right now your at the former so you best just shut up now you understand?” Peggy ranted and Steve could only nod in response.
~~~~~~~~~
AC/DC was blasting around the work shop, until it suddenly stops.
He was one his way to see Thor, but then he stop short as he saw his mom and Steve. “Darling are you heading to train?” His mom asked him, “yes mom, why don’t you go up to my floor and spend some time with Tobias?” Tony said nervously. At this moment Tony would never really admit it but he was nervous around Steve since the incident, he didn’t know how to act around him or what to say around him and judging by what Steve was looking he felt the same way.
The house look the same since the last time he came here, which was around a year ago before the New York attack, he liked it here John look after him here sometimes and even trained him to along with his son.
Steve was pacing in the common room what felt like goes to him, he couldn’t sleep, eat or drink anything, all he couldn’t think about is finding Tony. “Can’t sleep?” A voice appears, making Steve flinch and he turns around there he can see to his surprise was Tony’s son.
Who the hell punch Steve and surprise visitors are here to the rescue.
~~~~~~~~
Not a moment later Tony and Steve come out of the elevator, Tobias notices something very different about his dad “Your auras different what happen?” He asks his dad. Tony smiles “well Bambi it worked” he simply said. Tobias smiles and Peggy moves towards her son “what happen?” She asks, and Tony just hugs her tightly “it’s a long story mom” he simply says to her.
It was getting frustrating that no one wanted to tell him about it, he felt excluded and that no one cared what his thoughts were, so he started to act out. Like skipping school, giving attitude to teachers that didn’t deserve it and getting into fights with some bullies. It got to the point where he used a fighting technique that was forbidden to use in the public eye and he had almost seriously hurt an other student.
The Avengers arrived a little late due traffic but luckily it wasn’t too bad.Tony was nervous this is really the Avengers first time together at an event that Tony usually goes alone. The others were also nervous as this event is meant help with their reputation with being superheroes and all.
But Thor continue, “However, there were other people who fought them with great passion. My mother saw this and she decided without even telling my father to pass a gift to these certain individuals. The gift my mother pass down was to help them see these kind of threats that not any normal human could as you are well aware of” Thor smirk in that last sentence and tony could only just nod.
[6 hours ago]
“Ok... so who’s the old guy and the kid?” Clint asked, right the part of his life god, he didn’t want to talk about this but he has to.
Tony looked at his mom and gave her a sad smile and nodded “I promise mom I try” he responded and Peggy just gave a grateful smile.
Please feel free to comment for kudos.
Tony felt sick he felt like he was back, when he was 13 with Daniel and his gang. It scared him, he couldn’t breath he wanted to get the hell out of there, so he did.
“So what happens now dad?” His son ask, looking up to his dad with his big brown and green eyes. Tony wipe away his own tears and sigh “ well firstly I need to make sure that our family is safe, so I made a call to ensure that your grandma and Mr Davis to come to the tower safely I’m sure they’ll be here soon” tony spoke, he could see his sons eyes widen with relief.
Howard gives a small smile “mostly, I was very much aware in that neckless so for the most part I saw what you got up to in your later years Peggy kept me up to date when she was aware of her self, there was another man who showed me things as well though I can’t remember his name. But what I want to say is I’m very proud of you Anthony you’ve become the man I always hoped you’ll be, you change the company for the better, you became a superhero which I was amazed by you are really something special son” Howard praises. Tony didn’t know what to say, but before he could Howard continues.
Davis laughed at the silly joke “nah I go nothing to hide kid come on I’ll Make us some coffee” he spoke as walked away from the door and back into his house. He motioned tony to come in which he did.
That made Tobias head spin, “what that fucking....ouch” he hissed in pain when his grandmother smack him across the head. “Don’t speak just vulgar language Tobias you are far too young to speak like that” she scolded. Tobias rub his head to sooth the pain “grandma I’m 19 I’m not that little boy anymore. But I’m sorry to say that in front of you” he apologies, “Good” Peggy replies.
“Well this more fun, rather than fighting bad guys and your ‘orders’ were more easy to follow” tony retorted back. “As fun as this was, what do you want to do now?” Tony wondered what this means to Rogers did he want to leave it and never talk about it, does he want to do it again?.
[at the Hydra base]
Also a little warning there will be mentions of sexual assault.
Sure tony is attractive, and he is snarky and intelligent. But no way he is kind like Peggy was.
Tony had to admit it would be good to have the others to have his back, but at the same time they don’t get along. Well mainly the twin spies and Captain righteous. But anyways how would that conversation come about anyways ‘hey guys just wanted to ask if you can help find a man who raped me when I was 13 and hobby the way his is my 19 year old son, let’s chat about the course of action’ come on Tony can do that.
Hope you liked it,
~~~~~~~
“Hey Bambi, I had a feeling you’ll be up, I was going to make your grandma’s famous English breakfast” Tony said to his son with a smile.
Everyone was confused at this point and Clint decided to open his mouth before questions were answered. “What the fuck is going on here? why are is Caps first love here and the director too. Who the fuck is the old dude next to Ms Carter? He shouts getting annoyed at the confusion he’s witness.
Tony chuckled at the nickname that Thor recently gave him, and if he honest with himself he likes the nickname better than any other nickname that he was given in the past. But anyways, he better get ready.
So now that only leaves Steve and Peggy in the common room, there was an awkward silence for a short moment. “I think you and I need to have a little chat, don’t you think Steve?” Peggy said coldly, this sadden Steve he never wanted to upset her or even hurt her. But he did, he hurt her son and he’ll regret that for a very long time.
“Clint told me there has been a fight, Tony what did you do to cause this” he accuses, everyone looked at Clint with a glare. But he responds “hey look guys all I said is that there was a fight between Stark and Cap that’s all” he defends.
“I see, I’m glad you both are alive. I’ll stay here for a while and what I can discover until son of coul and Hill arrive. I’ll come to the hospital once I am done here” Thor told them both, and they nodded and went on there way.
God that was over 30 years ago back when life was a bit more simple. He wasn’t truly mad at Peggy for making him Tony’s godfather,
“Do it now” Daniel orders
“What are you talking about? You, my mom, your death, helping me what are you even saying?” Tony questions at his father. Howard gave him a small smile “I know that you were aware that Peggy was your mom, she told me when you were at MIT. You two had bonded, and even though I wasn’t thrilled because I was worried that you would push Maria away. But I’m glad you knew the truth in the end and I’m glad you now have someone to rely on” Howard’s stops for a moment, and Tony at that point was ready to scold him but Howard continues to talk “ I know that was a pathetic excuse, but I was afraid to tell you myself. I know I wasn’t a good father to you...” “Yeah, you got that right” Tony interrupted.
Tobias gently touch his dads arm, “Are you ok?” He asked. Tony couldn’t speak for a moment he just stared at his son knowing that his Bambi listen to everything Steve has said, and that broke his heart. “Am I ok, the real question is why are you down here Toby?” Tony said, Tobias look down for a moment like he been caught stealing a cookie from the cookie jar. “I was worried. You were taking too long so I ask Jarvis what you were doing, and Jarvis said that you were in a heated exchange with him” Tobias turned his head to look at Steve in anger.
“I just fucked Stark” steve said aloud in an empty room. His room even.
He pick up the picture that was next to the plane, he has keep this photo for all these years, the picture of two little boys been happy in the moment. But that doesn’t last for ever does it. He puts the photo away and looked at the plan his desk, “soon Tony” he whispered “soon you will be mine again, and this time it will be forever”
Anyways I’ll see you soon for the next chapter have a good day :)
“Um pep the light of my life what are you doing here?” He ask her
“Well what can I say spangles you caught by surprised, and here I was thinking your some sweet innocent old virgin” tony snark
He can see how Anthony cares for everyone even though they don’t much care for him and that breaks his heart to see that. So Thor tried to make it better by telling fascinating stories about Asgard and it’s magic to make Anthony happy which make Thor happy after all Anthony deserve happiness.
The man gave a low chuckled “well don’t worry about him, he’s mine to deal with and mine alone just make sure I got what I needed to make this plan work alright” he grunted
Apologise for any misspellings or bad grammar
[At the Crime scene]
“STEVEN” Thor shouted as he march towards Steve ‘oh shit’ Steve thought Thor’s going to kills him, “Thor wait please don’t do something you’ll regret” he try’s to plea but Thor wasn’t having any of it. “You harmed Anthony I told you what will happen if you commit such an act and now you should fell my wrath Captain” he roars and in a blink of an eye before anyone could have stop him he throws his hammer at Steve.
The time has come
And the icing on the fucking cake was good old Fury came back to talk about the super secret boy band which Tony refuse before and what a fucking surprise that Fury brought in a spy “Rushman” who Tony thought was his new PA that Pepper brought in after he hired her to take over as the new CEO of SI. But turns out Miss Rushman's actual name is Natasha Romanoff who works for a super secret government call SHEILD.
He gulped the coffee down as he was in a rush, the cup had been empty he was ready to set off, until he heard Rogers voice “You shouldn’t really drink that down fast it isn’t healthy” he said with a disproving tone.
Without any arguments the two spy’s nodded and left the room. Once they left the two spy’s ponder on what Fury meant, “Do you think he’s right Nat were we wrong about Stark?” Clint ask his friend. But Natasha just shook her head “I’m not sure Clint, but we sure as hell gonna find it come on let’s go” she told him and started to walk off.
On the other side of the states SHEILD fell, a couple months after tony incident, Tony heard that Rogers had a bit of a scrap with Hydra, well who knew they were around. But Rogers stop them and he also learned that his bestie was alive too, damn that must suck for him. Though Tony couldn’t help but get a cold feeling of what.... Daniel told him once (“hail hydra”), Tony never knew what that meant but now he does and that gives him shivers down his spin.
“Sure thing Peggy that would probably be best” he said to Peggy, she smiles at him and then walks towards the elevator which is behind her son. She stops for a moment “your wearing it” she said “um yeah” Tony just said he didn’t know what else to say about it, his mom gave him a warm smile “I’m glad and be safe my Darling I’ll be with Tobias” then she walks away leaving the two men alone.
~~~~~~~~~
The team was shock that Fury would say that to them, “What? Sir why would you think that” Steve asked in a slight panic. “ Because of what I saw out there! I told you all to see Tony in a different light and not judge him as how the world sees him, but yet you failed and now I am pissed” he sneered.
“Oh Mr Stark didn’t expect you to be here today” the receptionist spoke in a gentle voice
“Because I’m sleeping with him” he said bluntly, not really sure why he said that and now he regretted those words.
Though as he went to the kitchen he spotted his little Bambi in the kitchen already.
Tony step out of the elevator and walk in the communal kitchen to grab a quick snack, luckily he hadn’t spot any of the fellow avengers so tony thought he could get away from any grief.
Tony had to defuse the situation before it could get heated, “relax point break, Cap here just wants to see the training” he said calmly. Thor gave him a confused look “Are you sure that is wise?” He asked dubiously whilst looking at Steve with a glare. Tony could see that Steve was nervous under Thors glare, he wants to laugh at how uncomfortable Steve looks it’s a nice surprise he’s not always the dominant one. But anyways, there would be time for laughs later, but now Tony needs to be prepared for.... him.
“So did you plan on assaulting that day was that Hydras training, to beat and rape a kid?” He ask in Fury, Tony always wanted to know why Daniel did what he did and might as well be a good opportunity to find out why. Daniel smirk, Tony could see his pupils dilating which made Tony shiver down his spine. “Why you ask? Well do be honest I didn’t actually know you were going to be there it was a very nice surprise, I was planning on finding you later on but instead you found me” he looks down at Tony and caresses his face which made Tony gag. Daniel continues “I was there for a few months my guardian at the time  was on a mission and he wanted me to tag along, and whilst I was there I met some lovely outcast and we decided to hassle some whores and that was fun Oooo they were fun weren’t they Anthony” he finishes with a dark chuckle.
Tony rolled his eyes and turn to look at Rogers. You know it’s strange for the last couple of days or so Rogers hasn’t spoken to him, fought with him or even touch him he’s not sure he miss that or not.
“Well that got you to shut up didn’t it Stark” Rogers panted
Steve was nervous, he never seen Fury so pissed off about one person especially Stark. He felt awkward and wanted to leave the room one Clint and Nat started to talk, but he had to stay he needed answers. After what happen with Thor he needed to know truth, the real truth.
A few minutes later good old cap strolls in the penthouse, “STARK” Rogers roared, “where the hell have you been, you just flew off and didn’t show up for the debriefing, and you haven’t answer any of our calls what hell do you think you are doing uh are you that board of the mission that you fuck off. Well answer me let me hear one of your excuses Stark” he ranted.
And what he was saying about stark was true he did all these things for the team, for everyone, Steve felt like his chest was tightening and stomach was twisting in all sorts of directions. Could this be guilt Steve wonders.
TBC........
“Good” Fury continue, “I’ve been doing this for a long ass time, and doing this job you meet people, I knew Agent Carter and Howard and in turn I knew about Stark as a kid, you think of him as a spoiled little rich brat but in reality he was much different. I really had hope you would have seen through his mask Romanoff but you disappointed me and it goes to the same to you Barton, and of you come in here to disrespect him again then it would be you who would be off the team and instead would be doing clean up for the other agents do I make myself clear agents, well DO I” he shouted in anger.
Tobias bit his lip in frustration, but he understands his dads reasoning, “Yeah okay” he whispers. Tony looks at his son with sadness, he decide to walk over to him and hug him tightly “it will be ok Bambi” he whispers to his son and Tobias hugs him back.
God she didn’t like stark at all and no one can change her mind.
They had hot chocolate and chatted for a bit about the projects that SI are planning, then a while after pepper had to go and gave tony a kiss on the cheek and she left, leaving tony to in his own thoughts which isn’t good by any means.
Would you like me to show you on the screen?”
Hope you all have a good day 😊
Lily smiled for a bit at his words “thank you for telling me” she simply said. But then she frowned “But this is not why I’m here, I need to warn you about something” Tony frowned “really and what would that be?” He ask.
TBC......
Tony just sighed and got up from the couch and started to walk towards his bedroom, and Rogers was surprise by his action.
[In the penthouse]
But that was then, this was now. Which by the way the now at the moment was in Tony’s bed, he was naked, very naked and his ass was sore, he knew why that was.
“What the hell were you thinking I gave you a direct order, and yet again you went rouge” Rogers accuse
So tell me Stark what was Mrs Marks and you arguing about and where did you go after gala?” she questions him.
Their mouths crash together like waves hitting rocks, it was passionate and yet sloppy. Tony never felt anything like this with anyone before and god it was getting hard to the point it was painful.
“Young Sir is currently sleeping safety in the guest room.
Tony just hung his mouth open, “WHAT! Is that all you got from that, come on I just spilled my guts and that all you could say” he half shout with annoyance. To Tony’s surprise John smiled but it look sad almost “Oh trust me kid I have a lot of things to say on what you just told me but for now let’s just focus on the good things ok” he said gently and Tony just nodded.
“Avengers would you follow me I think we should have a little talk as well” Fury spoke and he didn’t sound too happy about it. He walked out the room and ‘encourage’ the others to follow Nat did without question and drag Clint along with her. Steve was a bit hesitant at first but followed anyways and think what had he done?
“Yes if you could Jarvis” Tony replies back.
He moaned into Rogers mouth, then the kissing stop. Tony tried to case the kiss, but he realised it stop he open his eyes to find a very smug Rogers in front of him.
“I doubt he feels that way now after all I’ve done to him” Steve whispers not realising that spoke. Tobias gives him a weak smile “I wish he did, but my dad will still always love you it’s actually annoying sometimes” he simply said with a small smile across his face. Steve looks at him with surprise “But why would he!” He shouts “I’ve been nothing but a bully to him I’ve judge him so wrong I’ve used him all the wrong ways, how could he ever love me after I have done” Steve argues. Tobias looks at him with sadness “I honestly don’t know, you need to talk to him about it once we get him back home” he simply said, there was an awkward pause between the two of them for minute, Steve wanted to talk ask Tobias question about his life and Tony being a father he wanted to get to know them better and to clear the air there’s so much to say but as of right now their main priority is to find Tony.
Steve and Bruce was trying to fight it the sleeping gas but they are still weak. Bruce could feel himself changing into the Hulk he was ready for it but then a sharp pain landed in his arm he looked down towards his arm and saw it was a tranquilliser dart ‘Stupid humans’ he could hear Hulk scold until he himself drop to the ground.
And also the home that Peggy is in, knows is funded by SHEILD and SI so only the most trusted people can take care of her.
They made it back to Tony’s lab, and Steve took Tony to the couch. “Right so did you want to rest here or back in your penthouse?” Steve ask. But before Tony could answer JARVIS spoke “Sir glad you have arrived back, we have an emergency” Tony and the others were alert at this point “what happened J?” Tony ask.
~~~~~~~~~
It was cold so cold.
P.s i just want to ask everyone if someone could help me find a Stony fic that I’ve been trying to find on here for ages. Story is that the avengers are trap by a villain who has a magic staff that shows a persons past and he uses it on Tony which shows a lot of abuse from his childhood. I know it was completed and it had I think 7 chapters . If you guys know then feel free to comment that would be a big help thank you 😊.
In an odd sort of way they became closer after that, they went out together more often, they went to the workshop together and his dad has even been there for his training they are happy sure they had there ups and down but who hasn’t.
TBC.........
The gala was in full swing, the paparazzi were going crazy outside the gala.
[week after Tony’s birthday]
It happen again the same nightmare.
Now Thor was really piss, he pressed Steve hard against the wall, which felt pain all over his back. Is Steve really that stubborn that he can’t see through is anger to see that Anthony is worth of respect. “ are you serious captain, you want examples gladly. You call him disobedient, but do you know why he does that” Thor waited for Steve to answer, but Steve just shook his head. Thor scoff at that “ it’s because he found a better solution then what you came up with, I class you two as both leaders of this group. But yet we only follow what you said, however if you even bother to speak with Anthony then maybe we’ll form better as a team. Tell me captain if Anthony is disobedient, then how many casualties has he cause because of his actions?” Thor challenge. Steve tried to think and but he got nothing, Starks disobedience has never caused a casualty maybe Thor was right.
See you guys soon 😃
The next item was two large bracelets, they were leather and old. He pick one up, Tony was surprise to feel cold metal underneath so he turned it around and what do you know they were blade. When he was younger his mom told him that there were people who would use these blades to stealthily target the bad guys they were useful, quiet and quick. He never seen one in real life until now and he didn’t know why he needed them, John must of sense his doubts cause the next thing he knew John touch his shoulder as some kind of reassurance “I know you have the armour but they can be useful when the time is right trust me your mom wouldn’t have given you these now if she didn’t have a reason” he spoke gently and yeah he was right he shouldn’t doubt his mom.
Then Fury looked at him directly in the eyes “well then you better be right or otherwise I’ll keep my promise do you understand” Fury said darkly, “Yes Sir” Steve whispers.
Please feel free to comment or kudos
Before Bruce coup continue his ‘talk’ with Hulk, Natasha and Thor enter the room and it’s fair to say Thor did not look happy.
Unfortunately since he was able to he couldn’t try out his new abilities, if he could focus his energy to his arms then maybe he could break free. Feeling defeated he sighs with dread thinking what Daniel might do to him. He needed to know how they found out about his abilities were Hydra spying on them for years or did someone sell him out he didn’t know but god he hope he didn’t get betrayed.
I didn't have time to edit it because I wrote 6K of a How to Train Your dragon AU--which, I swear, is writing itself. The blond Bulky Viking Steve vs. Scrawny Inventor and Dragon-lover Tony was too much for me to resist. Just to clarify, it usually takes me 12 months to write a fic (this here took 18 r.i.p.) but this ... this is absolutely blowing up. I just returned from a 10-mile walk and I walked like a teenagers with my nose in my phone because I couldn't put the Notes App down, THAT'S how strong my 48h brainstorm was!
“From the start it’s been clear that there’s an awful lot of jealousy tying each person in this case, and at its centre, where all the roots lead, is you.” Steve then asked, “How did you find Tiberius Stone? What was his state of mind prior to his death?”
“Serving. What do you really want to do with your life?”
They pressed on. If the men did see them, catching movement while wiping their stained foreheads on their sleeve, they turned their heads away. The room narrowed into a corridor and the noise quieted with each step added between, until they ran into a yellow, heavy-duty door, which had a very familiar name … it was the entrance to Sector 16.
“I can dismiss myself, sir. Just wondering whether you need help adjusting…”
“Because he’s my—he can’t—it’s just not possible. What could possibly be his motive?”
“What,” asked Bucky, gaping at the others, “are you three wearing?”
He set the duster on a console table and took Tony’s bag.
“He must be the most high-handed man I’ve ever met,” Tony groused. “Appallingly bossy. He should control himself. He’s victimizing us all.”
“I did wonder,” he drawled, digging at his pockets, “where my newspaper had gone.”
“You!” Steve cried out.
“Don’t you remember the miners?” Bucky’s voice said from out of sight.
The gathered crowd had parted as the stocky form of their doctor marched past, carrying his medicine bag. Steve closed his eyes. The smell of smoke lingered on his clothes; it made his fears horribly vivid.
Tony picked up the ring, seemingly just to have something, anything, to do with his hands, even if it meant bringing attention to such a controversial object. He started to clinically chip away the thin crusting of blood with a fingernail, almost uncaring of its origin.
“Upstairs,” Pierce directed curtly.
“Get on the front seat,” he said, after a pause.
“Started three pages ago,” Bruce said, not lifting his head that was still bowed over Steve’s palm. “It’s rather fascinating. They’ve come up with a new theory on tissue regeneration.”
No matter the cause, this here was familiar.
Steve saw similar realizations cross the faces of his friends. It did not promise anything good about the origin of the explosion.
“Planning?” he asked, stepping under the porch, laying a casual hand on the rail. “Nope, I’m not planning on anything. There’s been a, uh, significant rise in jammed guns.”
But there’s no answer; the other deputy had been guarding his back, Sam was positive, but now the main street was empty except for him and the thief. Sam frowned in annoyance—it was much less fun showing off without James to show off to.
“I am,” said Ms. Althea.
He mustn’t have been as confident in the future of Stark as he had let on early this morning, thought Tony.
“Bad dreams?” said Bucky, frowning at him from the other side of the face-to-face arranged seating.
“I don’t mean to make things difficult,” he said mournfully.
“Surrender your passport to Constable Lang. For further notice, you’re not to leave the British soil,” he said before he turned away without another word and climbed into the driver’s seat.
Tony could not get his body to form a reply: then a heavy set of footsteps joined Obie.
Tony could no longer stay still with nothing but bitter thoughts for company. Desperate for something to do, for distraction, he walked around his untouched bag, slipping out of the room and strode along the panelled passage outside.
“Your father’s career was an utter
Steve didn’t answer.
“What?” Tony asked suspiciously.
By then, the woman in red had been joined by Stern, who, with a rather enormous leap of liberty, brushed a hand across her back. She did not flinch; she had observed him, too, from the reflective surface of the French windows.
“I—what?” he asked, disconcerted. “Who?”
Steve listened to him babble with a polite, albeit confused, smile.
Five of the men ran towards them. There were too many of them to shoot during a distance such as this: soon, four had reached Steve and Bucky and bore on them, hard. Without pausing to think further, Steve surrendered into the mindset of war as though meeting an old friend: air flowed into his lungs, his heart throbbed with life, all thought obliterated but for these fundamental signals that told him he himself was not yet dead.
No one knew for sure why he
His eyes fell on Tiberius.
“Talk about devil’s luck,” cursed Bucky; it would be a while before the steam powered ploughs reached the summit. Too late, thought Steve, if they wanted to reach the San Francisco in time. How much time would elapse until they reached the city? How much longer would Tony be able to resist Stane? All Steve knew for sure was that Tony had never done what people wanted, and he was not sure if that would be in his favor or against in this case, making Steve all the more anxious to speed over the peaks on foot in he needed to. All his faith had been on the iron horse beneath him, still trembling idly.
“Evil?” Tony said. “You seem to teeter between assistance and assault. Which is it?”
“Harassing
But no key matching the brass of the drawer was found.
One man, who looked unfortunately familiar to Steve, stood up. Wolfgang Strucker, who could often be recognized by his sporting his thin golden-rimmed monocle, cleared his throat and looked down at his documents.
Fury took a moment and sighed, they better be right “ Fine but this is your last chance you understand, no more judgements no more hurtful words you got me” the trio shock their heads in agreements. “Good Agent Romanoff And Agent Barton go and find Doctor Banner and Thor and meet us in the common room” he ordered them “Yes Sir” they both said and walk out of the room.
Steve process the words that Nat spoke of, it’s true that maybe Steve feels a little bit jealous that Thor’s getting more attention than him at this moment in time, he might speak thor about this matter.
Enjoy 😊
“Should we go after those sir” an agent ask, “no leave them let’s stick to the mission” Daniel said.
“Oh right, well that’s seems easy enough you make it seem that it’s going to be hard” tony joke
He repeatedly knocks on door and rings the door bell for good measure. He was about to open the door by force, but the door creek open and inside was Tony’s very sleepy boy.
Once Thor left it was only Steve and Tony, “Right I think we should go to my penthouse maybe we should get Bruce to come up as well, you know safety in numbers and all” Tony suggests.
So so sorry that this chapter took too long to complete but I hope you all like it and again sorry for any misspellings or bad grammar
Silence filled the room, it was awkward at best. Tony feeling all eyes on him but he should say one more thing “As for your question about these two (Tony pointing at his son and Davis) the old guy, his name is John Davis he was the detective who took my case and throughout the years he’s been training me to defend myself and he’s like a father figure to me” he said whilst Davis looked at him like a father would be of his son caring and proud.
Tony was infuriating and he knew when to push Steve’s buttons, which angers him. That what he wants to argue, to defend his actions.
Please feel free to comment or kudos
“Please stop I didn’t do anything... Daniel please” Tony pleads. But Daniel doesn’t stop, he can see him now and both of them are naked.
Tony was too tired to speak to Rogers he didn’t want to talk, he just wanted to forget about today.
Rogers frowned at that statement “no I guess we don’t want that do we, and besides they would think why I would fuck you in the first place. But you’re right I don’t want to out stay my welcome now do I, see you later Stark” and Rogers just slammed the door.
And apologies for any misspellings or bad grammar
Tony could feel a chill down his spine, like someone is behind him, touching him it wasn’t pleasant that’s for sure. But despite it all he didn’t move, he didn’t run. “Well Well well, looks like little Anthony hasn’t run away, ooh what a shame I do like chasing you among other things, hehehhehe” the creature spoke with the most chilling laugh.
They both calm down and look into each other’s eyes, they both didn’t know what to say. There was so much to talk about, so many apologies on Steve’s part mostly “Tony I....” He started but Tony interrupted him “Look Steve now it’s not the time for that, we got more important things to think about and to be honest I don’t want to talk about it” he said seriously.
[two weeks later]
“Jarvis send me up to the penthouse who you please?” Tony ask as he enters the elevator. “Certainly Sir, and May I say that young Sir is awake and was asking for you. Would you like me to inform him that you’re on your way?” His AI asked him.
“I believe sir, that there are some in the common room kitchen” his AI replied. Shit that’s where the others usually go to eat together, damn it now he has to go and get it hopefully he can swoop in and they won’t bother him especially Steve.
Steve didn’t know what to say, everything that Thor was saying was true. Steve tried to think of ways to defend his treatment towards stark but he couldn’t think of one, was Steve really that blind and clouded by anger that he didn’t realise that stark has given him a place of safety and comfort.
[At a Hydra base]
“ENOUGH!!” Fury roared, that brought Steve out of his thoughts and stop the spy twins fighting. They all stand there stunned by Fury’s outburst and waited quietly to wait for him to talk again.
All of the sudden the creature was in front of Tony, it look horrible it was red and black the skin look like it was dripping, it’s eyes where hollow and empty. “What’s the matter Anthony lost your ability to use your legs hmm?” It taunts.
But the twins have other ideas, “Steve wait” Clint said, which stop Steve in his tracks.
Tony sighs what Steve said was true and that’s probably the best idea they could do right now “Your right, fine I stay. Thor” “I know Anthony I’ll be on my way, stay safe you two” Thor said as heads out to the location were the crime took place.
“Wait you’re telling me that you were aware of mom and my abilities?” Tony ask. “I was” his father answered “ your mom told when you start to develop your abilities, she told to leave it alone as it wasn’t my place and for once I listen to her and I’m glad I did god knows what idiocy I would have done if I intervened “ he spoke with some humour in his voice.
Steve was confused and wanted to speak out, but Clint jump in there first. “Hold the fuck up for a second? What is going on here, who are you and who do think you are attacking the leader of the Avengers?” He growled. Tobias wanted to answer back tell him who he really is but just the look on his dad eyes is telling him not to, it could be dangerous.
TBC......
Tony just chuckle with no humour behind it “ seriously Thor, look I know that you and brucie bear are my bros but the rest of the gang are part of the hate tony club. If they found out they’ll think I’m a freak and probably kick me off the team,
Then there was of course tony who added to all the stress, he was nothing but a spoiled little rich bully and Steve hates bullies. They had nothing in common, they fight all the time and tony never get involved with team bonded which Steve is glad but also displeased by it as well. He really doesn’t want to hate tony, but he makes it so difficult not too. Like he thinks he’s better than anyone else and that just piss steve off.
Steve felt he could cry at those words he failed, he didn’t save Tony. He took a deep breath, right now it’s not the time for self pitying he needed to come up with a plan to rescue Tony from this Daniel guy and he needed to do it quickly.
[Hydra Base 8 hours ago]
“I wouldn’t know, only my mother had those answers, but before she died” Thor again gave a sad look which tony felt his heart break. But Thor continued “.. before she died, I told her about you all and the fact you are one of her children, she was interested in you and look through your past, your family. She had this look like i never seen before and told me that your family were different from the rest and it was my duty to train you to help you enhance and master your gift to its fullest” he spoke about his mother with pride but also sadness.
“Just like this, inside me. C’mon, give me another load.”
Strong metal arms wrapped around Steve’s middle. Tony’s voice was calm through the Ironman speakers.
When Jan burst in the door waving around a DVD and calling for a team meeting Steve wasn’t exactly sure what he should be expecting. Certainly, he was not expecting their massive television screen to be filled up with images of Tony Stark and Natasha Romanov entwined in a passionate embrace. Many embraces actually. In many positions. And oh wow, Natasha had been really flexible.
“HAIL HYDRA”
Steve felt his mouth go dry. He thought to say no, throw Tony out of the office and bolt the door behind him. But then Tony’s thumb went back to rubbing circles along the back of his neck. He couldn’t deny that it felt good. He imagined the same pressure on the tired muscles of his back would feel just as good. It was a tempting offer. But he hadn’t missed the sultry tone of Tony’s voice. Steve wasn’t stupid. He knew what a seduction looked like. He couldn’t say he was terribly surprised. Tony had made overtures before, but nothing this direct. Giving him an inch now would lead to Tony taking a mile. If he consented to Tony’s hands on his body he wasn’t sure how far Tony would push things. He should say no. He should…oh! Tony dug his thumb harder into his spine. Steve felt a pop and it hurt for a moment but then the pain and tension melted and left nothing but a pleasant throb in its place. And then his hands were gone.
“Oh. I guess you really do feel good, huh? I’m flattered. I wasn’t expecting you to want the happy ending, but I’d be thrilled to oblige you, Darling.” As he spoke, Tony rocked gently back and forth, flicking his finger at the same pace against the nipple he’d pinched. Steve flushed, ashamed at the arousal crawling under his skin.
“We’ll shower first. I’m not going to take you here, like this. I’ll take you to bed once we’re clean.”
Steve murmured his own “cheers” in answer and drained the glass in one thick swallow. It wasn’t like the alcohol would do anything to him and he didn’t care for the taste enough to savor it. Tony followed suit and poured off two more glasses before Steve could protest. He came around to perch on the edge of the desk, took a slow sip and made a show of licking his lips after. Steve tore his eyes away and drained the second glass. Tony huffed out a laugh.
“Please. Captain America letting someone else take control? Never gonna happen. You’re a control freak, just like me. Except I do know how to let loose when the situation calls for it.”
“You know, that’s pretty arrogant too. To put all this mess squarely on your own shoulders. It wasn’t just your mistake. It’s my job to listen when the people I’m in charge of try to tell me something. We all wanted to do what was best for the team. I was just too caught up in personal matters to see what that was. I was compromised. I can see that now. I should have trusted you to have my back. I thought I could do better if I handled everything myself and I’m sorry. I guess we both need to learn how to share responsibility now and again.”
That’s why he was doing this. The other Rogers was stomping all over some of Steve’s most private thoughts, making a mockery of his desires. The camera zoomed in for a close-up of Steve’s cock as he entered Tony, and Steve realized to his horror that he was starting to get hard.
“Leaving already? But the show’s just starting! I know it’s your favorite. I think you’ll like this version even better.”
Steve whirled back around to see that yes, the two men had started furiously making out on the screen while the woman put that cucumber to a rather creative use. Humiliation flared sharp as Steve turned back to Tony to try to spit out a denial, even as he realized that he would never live this down. In the next second, he choked on his breath when his eyes landed on the tent in Tony’s silk pajama bottoms.
He reached down and cupped Steve firmly through the stiff material of his suit. This earned Tony a sharp intake of breath from Steve, followed by a bite near the vicinity of his ear. Tony finished working the pants open and dropped to his knees with a groan. Steve deserved a proper apology for his share in the fighting after all, and there was no better way to say sorry than with a blow job.
It may have been minutes or hours after they started that the door finally cracked open and steam billowed out, obscuring Steve’s vision. He rushed forward and caught the figure collapsing just inside the doorway.
“I can’t promise that I’ll ever have the answer to that question. But I can make you some other promises. I promise to never lie to you, Tony, if you can promise me the same. I don’t want to fall into the same cycle of love, lies, and betrayal that the other two did. I want to give us a chance.”
“Not anything. Just you. Please, Steve.”
“Don’t worry, I’m not so drunk that I can’t get it up. Although if you’re not in’erested in that I can always take care of m’self in the bathroom afterwards.”
Steve moved aside as Tony pushed his way in. The adrenaline spike from waking was fading but Steve’s heart was still hammering in his chest.
“Tony?”
“It’s more of what it isn’t. This is supposed to be my A.I. self.”
Steve fastened the contraption to his wrist and found a button on the side. The screen lit up with the time and date as he pressed it. So it was a watch.
“Oh, my god.”
Steve pressed a thumb to one of the bite marks from earlier at the same moment he latched his mouth onto one of Tony’s nipples and sucked. Warm, wet splatters fell against his stomach only moments later as Tony keened loudly. Steve pulled away just slightly to tumble onto his side and curl around Tony.
“Steve, you’ve got nothing to apologize for. None of this is your fault. I wasn’t able to stop them jumping through that portal today. Hell, the fact that they even had a portal is because an AI modeled after my brain decided to be evil. So really, this is all on me.”
He stood slowly and reached for Steve’s other arm. Steve told himself it wasn’t disappointment he felt when Tony remained standing rather than join him back on the couch. Tony mirrored the previous motions, from hand to shoulder and back. Try as he might, Steve couldn’t manage to fall back into the blissful state of half-sleep from earlier. Now that he had become aware of his erection he couldn’t put it out of his mind enough to find his former peace. He relaxed further back into the cushions of the couch, ignoring the way it pushed his hips up the tiniest bit. If Tony caught the movement, he gave no indication.
Eventually, Tony drew his hand back down to touch his own chest. He moved slowly, gliding gently in a sharp contrast to the movements of his other hand on Steve’s dick. Steve did his best to keep his own desire down to a low simmer in the back of his mind as he watched Tony adjust to the pleasure that could be felt with just fingertips. He found his nipples and spent long minutes circling his fingertips over them, twirling and lightly pinching until they were hard and reddened from the attention.
“I’m not going to let someone go rooting around in my head on the off-chance that all my precautions aren’t working. Besides, I’m pretty sure I would remember waking up sore the morning after a fucking like that!”
The anger Steve had felt at seeing his counterpart continued to simmer under the surface, redirected at the only target left to him. An army on another Earth. Really?
“Yes, I would. I’ve thought about you like that countless times. Your evil twin wouldn’t have had to force me. So, yes, I’m the one to blame for this whole situation, and I’m so sorry.”
“Shall I continue then?”
Steve mumbled his assent and then Tony swung a leg up and over him to straddle Steve’s ass. Steve started to turn around with a glare, but he was stopped by the first strong press of Tony’s hands down his back. The air hitting the oil over his skin left a trail of goosebumps in its wake. Before he could complain, Tony’s hands were back lending heat. He started slow, hands spread wide to cover more of his flesh, the pressure light. There was a pause as Tony added more oil to cover his entire back and then the pressure picked up. Tony pressed his fingers in deep to rub at spots Steve hadn’t even realized were sore. He inadvertently grunted when Tony reached his right shoulder blade, rubbing at the tense knot he’d found there. He ground into it with the palm of his hand until Steve thought he might be seeing stars dancing behind his eyelids. It hurt in a way that shouldn’t feel this good as that one point of pressure built until it suddenly released with a pop. Steve muffled a groan into the couch cushion as Tony’s clever fingers continued dancing across his flesh.
Tony looked up at Steve with wide eyes as Steve thrust forward until he was hitting the back of his throat. He held himself there and watched Tony’s eyes water as he began to choke then pulled back and allowed the other man a short breath. Steve repeated the process twice more as Tony began to drool. Steve released his grip on Tony, who then dove forward of his own accord to choke himself. Steve waited until he could feel the mix of precome and spit trailing down his balls before he finally pulled away and forced Tony up.
The grin, at least, made a quick disappearance.
Slowly, Steve moved his arm to peer up at Tony. Up to this point, Steve had never been able to get Tony’s expressions to match the video exactly. He’d tried a few times, but had never quite managed to get that sharp possessive smile he’d seen Tony give Natasha over a dozen times. He still wasn’t getting that look now.
“That’s it, Baby. Shoot your load right at my face. Cum for me.”
Curiosity satisfied, Steve gently tucked himself away and glanced around to ensure that they were still alone in the library. He briefly wondered if it would make him gay if he reached down to return the favor with his hand. Guys used to do that sort of thing all the time back during the war. It was the polite thing to do. Besides, touching a dick wasn’t nearly as bad as sucking one. Tony was still the queer one here. Decision made, Steve finally glanced down just in time to see Tony bringing his hand up to his mouth. Steve blinked. When the hell had Tony come? How had Steve missed that?
Rather than waste time with a response, Steve merely reached down to unzip his pants and pull his cock out, glad that he hadn’t bothered with underwear for this. Tony fell gracefully to his knees and made a show of licking up the salty precome that was already gathered around the head. He took Steve in slowly, humming happily as he sucked lightly. Steve let him get away with it for a few seconds then reached down and grabbed a fistful of hair.
Tony’s eyes sparkled with mirth even as he nodded along and agreed to finally put Steve out of his misery.
Tony tentatively reached up and wrapped a hand around Steve’s dick, letting go almost immediately at Steve’s sharp intake of breath and accompanying wince. Lube. Lube would be good, except there wasn’t any nearby and maybe moving to the bedroom would have been the wiser decision. Well, option B it was then.
Steve didn’t pay any mind to the finger the first time it brushed against his hole. Tony usually touched him there during blowjobs. He’d discovered from research on the internet that plenty of straight men liked to be touched there. He wasn’t queer for enjoying having his anus played with. As long as it happened during oral sex, then Steve could tell himself that there was nothing gay about it.
He jumped at the sound of his voice on screen. He hadn’t even noticed the end of the blowjob. But now Tony was bent over the desk, the perfect screenshot of dozens of Steve’s old fantasies.
Tony looked impossibly sad and Steve felt a punch of anger. What business did Tony Stark of all people have feeling pity for Steve. The man talked to his brain tumor for Christ’s sake. Tony continued to cast that sad look around the office.
“No.  You said the other you had always loved the other me. But you never said how you felt about me-me. The new, improved me, I mean.”
Steve tightened his hold on Tony and pressed his lips into the curls tickling at his face. “I’m not. And you’re not just a warm body, Tony.” Tony’s voice shook in the quiet of the night.
He was enjoying his last night in office in comfortable solitude, so naturally it was only a matter of time before Tony came trotting in through the door. The Billionaire came in silently except for his soft footfalls on the carpet, carrying two glasses and a bottle of Dom Perignon.
it became impossible to get, this is top of the line. If I knew you were just going to chug it, I might as well have gotten sparkling grape juice.”
“Yeah. Yeah, okay. What did you have in mind?”
Only Tony could be so indignant while sounding so incredibly fragile. Steve would have to do better to keep Tony from sounding like that. He found he didn’t like the tone at all. Tony offered minimal resistance as Steve grabbed one of his hands and coated it in slick. Tony stared at his hand in wonder with the same expression he’d used throughout the day when exploring new sensations. It was incredibly endearing.
A delicious shiver of heat ran through Steve at the words, there and then gone again. He hadn’t allowed those kinds of thoughts to run through his head. There’d be no point to it aside from compounding frustration. But now that Tony brought it up, it was all he could think about.
Rogers and the Avengers had caught up to them. Steve spun around and made sure he was between their line of sight and Tony. Clearly Tony had been keeping secrets, but Steve would only get the chance to be mad about that if they somehow made it out of this. Dammit all. Just a few more months of planning and they’d have been so much more prepared for a confrontation like this.
“I must be drunker ‘en I thought to be hallucinating a half naked Cap’n ‘Merica.”
Tony reached out his hands, but they went straight through Steve’s legs, not even a hint of touch to be felt. He looked down in misery on his two blue hands.
“Oh sure. If you had known what was going to happen then of course you would have told me. If I had known we’d find definitive proof that your mystery man framed the one-armed wonder I wouldn’t have had to fight you like that. We’d all do things differently if we knew what the outcomes would be in advance. But life doesn’t work that way. You lied, we fought, and the Avengers are splintered down the middle. Now we both have to live with it.”
Several people stopped their walking at the sight of him — Tony felt their stares like something white hot pressing to the side of his face — and he pressed his sunglasses tighter on the bridge of his nose, but before he could veer to the other side of the road, he heard a loud roar, and signs of commotion by the black grille opening to the courtyard of the police station.
Rogers nodded. “I hardly begged you for a fan of the memoirs of Casanova.”
Hope pursed her lips. “He won’t be far.”
“Not directly. It was not my place. I know only what I happened to overhear while serving Mr. Stark. There were some words we exchanged as I let him in the house, but I do not see how inquiries on whether the master was home would be of any consequence to you.”
“Tell me I’m not the only one getting the creeps,” said Natasha from where she was studying the shelves full of books and files at the right corner of the room.
Tony knew he did not only mean the clouds gathering in the horizon.
“But, really,” insisted Tony, “I shouldn’t have ditched you.”
“Oh, hey,” Sam said, relieved, and Steve knew he wanted to change the subject. “Here comes Bruce.”
“Get away from him, Dummy.”
“Well?” Pierce pressed.
Again, Tony did not speak.
“Oh, good. You know this is my choice, right? I may be the only one with kids and I do miss my Cassie terribly already, but. These things, heists and rescue missions…these things are once in a lifetime, man. I got a daughter to take care of, and Mr. Pym happened to promise his blessing if I come back alive.”
Tony’s stomach swooped.
Bucky huffed. “Should have used Stark’s, that’s what I would’ve done. Harder to pin down now that everyone and their mother’s got those—now
“ — uh, sorry, can I take this? This is nuts. It’s like Chinese water torture.”
When they passed through them into a sort of entry yard, their eyes fell upon queues formed in front of three arches housing as many entrances to the factory. They had barely dismounted and joined the nearest one when Steve observed a superior checking his watch by the grilles at the front. Feeling eyes on his person, he lifted his gaze; it glittered with recognition.
is art!”
“You know,” Steve told him, “sometimes I have no idea whether you’re about to wreck our house or kill yourself with work.”
“I do, sir. But, with all due respect,” Steve said, “I still don’t see how we could possibly find something that these …
“Staying the night,” said Rogers, setting his wet hat onto the console by the door. “If you don’t mind.”
“Really?” asked Steve, trying to sound engaged.
Finally, after several minutes of Bucky’s continuing disapproval, an inconspicuous door in the back opened and Coulson stepped in and slid behind the dais.
Tony tore his gaze away from Steve.
“Well, seen that all the criminal activity has somewhat lessened as of late, so … yeah, had to ask Fury’s permission to branch out.”
When he lifted his eyes, Tony’s gaze was on his unadorned hand as well. Steve saw his throat bob.
For a second that contained an all eternity, Steve stared, uncomprehending, at the patch of stones where Tony’s body laid.
Tony looked back at Tiberius in surprise. “No, we didn’t.”
He eyed Tony.
Feeling more than a small amount of irritation towards Pym, Steve had half a mind to turn around and refuse to receive his help, and he would have, had the safety of four others not been on stake. Instead, he watched Pym walk around the room in grim silence. From a drawer of his desk, he drew a key.
(See the end of the chapter for
In front of him, Tony noted with satisfaction the at once unnerved air about Inspector Rogers as the tinny voice of the Superintended went on through the round earpiece, harried in the way one was when squeezed between a rock and a hard place: attempting to please two important members of the gentry at the same time;  the principal magistrate of the district, whose dead son had just been extracted from Tony’s Persian rug; and the son of the generous patron of the police department, and whom they very much wished to hold onto the tradition.
“And if he’s in there? Gonna talk him into handing Tony over to us?”
affection—!”
“Maybe he had mud on his shoes,” said Rhodey.
“It opens,” called out Fury’s voice from behind it, and Steve rushed inside.
“Moving on,” he said pointedly. “Ah, now
“You do that, it won’t undo the damage done. People have looked between their fingers when you’ve let one or two slip out now and again, your belief that even the worst of men is entitled to a fair trial…but I won’t pretend this doesn’t shake our trust in you—and, therefore, this town’s trust in
Tony thought the subject had been closed, but after a silent car ride he was sorry to find Rhodey stealing glances at him over the stone lid bearing his mother’s name, and which now held a fresh bouquet of lilies, along with a slightly wilted vase of blush roses, brought no doubt by Jarvis the week before.
Steve, at last, tore his eyes off the fireplace.
Their office had spent weeks in near silence and had taken to helping people and occasional item across the river. Despite Fury’s assertion to keep on eye on things, criminal activity had hit an all-time-low, as though it might compensate for the chaos of the previous month. Steve was always glad to see the stagecoach, because it represented a connection to the world outside, albeit a scarce and ill-tempered kind. They relished any news about what was happening in America, though the driver was not an ideal informer. He had little time to prattle around since he was now frequently delayed, and they had to be very careful not to ask too much or the man would drive past them next time through.
“What do you mean by that?” asked Jarvis, frowning.
“Sorry?” Tony said. “What was that?”
in my absence.”
She blushed scarlet under her white cap, releasing a little giggle just as the latch clicked shut after her.
“Of course,” Steve replied automatically and watched Tony tap against his chest in so short an interval it resembled a tic.
“Behind the church, didn’t I tell you I saw some battered cans there? I thought it was you. The tin was bent like butter, hard to tell the caliber from the size of the holes. Now that I think about it, it didn’t match any of Tony’s, either.”
“Did you set this up all day?” Steve questioned.
“Damn! He’s paranoid,” Natasha muttered.
“You know, I knew your father. I was sad to learn of his death,” he said, frowning. “He was too young to go.”
He could ask none them. Instead, Tony tucked himself silently in the backseat, and they took off. Yet, after having driven for barely half a mile, the car slowed to a crawl and stopped. Steve, bent low over the wheel, bit his lip, staring at the dark night encompassing them. His straw-blond locks had fallen over his forehead.
He felt as each of them had reached an understanding to wait for some sign, some word, of what was going on outside Leigh’s Creek—and that it was useless to speculate about what might be coming until they knew for certain.
“I’ll put it on the list.” Rogers did so. “Thank you, Jarvis,” he said pleasantly. “That will do.”
“Not to worry,” Coulson had said. “It is merely a formality. We can’t make exceptions, not even for a man of your … pedigree.”
“The only one I care about.”
“Normal people don’t need to buy affection!”
Unbidden, a smile tugged at the corners of Steve’s mouth. He felt played, but he didn’t feel sore about it.
like anyway?
“Who’s that?” asked Tony from the space at large. “Get it, girl!”
For once, Clint had no retort. As Steve watched the man in front of them broke down in quiet sobs, Clint was starting to color. Steve cleared his throat.
86 MARKET STREET
“Wait,
Steve sighed; he had been taking long detours evading the perimeter of the building ever since he promised to Fury to make his divorce legal.
“Yes,” said Tony at once; he was glad to be able to discuss this without needing to get defensive. “Then laid on the carpet—”
It was then that he became aware of his dry throat and remembered some brandy had been left in the decanter in the study. He hesitated; Jarvis would cuff his ears for it … but he was old … and Tony was not sixteen anymore. Surely … surely, he would not be awakened by Tony walking in his own house?
“No, he’s here to grovel,” said Clint shrewdly. “You caught him in the act, didn’t you?”
Shaking off excess droplets, he looked back into the mirror, examining the dark circles under his eyes with clinical interest. He had to admit to himself, though, that he had continued work with a kind of fury, relishing the manual work, glorying in the strain of it, for every hour not slept and every new scar in his body felt like a promise of aptitude to the people that he served.
Although Steve recognized this as a kind of discourtesy, no part of him reared in anger; he took a measured step forward. Now, six feet from the locked door, Stane’s grip on his gun tightened, knuckles turning white. Slowly, very slowly, Stane put his arm inside his vest, coming to protectively grasp the bulb—and Steve knew Stane would fire soon … sensed the anticipation thicken in the air as Stane coiled like a snake—
“That uniform’s really caused you to escalate,” said Bucky. “There’s no time for one-man rescue mission.”
“I can’t believe this,” he heard her sigh in a weak sort of moan. “You should, for a start, be
Steve had not been expecting such an ardent opposition from Clint Natasha’s end.
their Captain.”
It was a sticky moment: Tony had sensed the word
. “He has an innate ability to scent pretense like a bloodhound, no doubt because of his past. Took us years to track him down to a run-down log cabin in upstate New York.”
“Er, guys?” a voice said loudly over the raising volume of their dispute.
Son of who? Were the worker’s parents of a poor background? Steve turned the paper around, but the sentence didn’t continue there. Steve scanned the desk: perhaps the rest of the letter had fallen off its ripped envelope. He peeked under the sheaves of paper, shook several documents and turned over an opened envelope, yet, the unfinished sentence was not carried on any paper or any other surface on the desk.
he asked Fury.
Inside, Steve found Clint and Sam sat close together at the same desk. Clint was manfully assaulting a piece of chewy salt pork; Sam was staring resolutely at the desk. Both seemed a little forced in their conversation with him; Steve suspected he had interrupted them in private talk. They sat there, with only the sound of Clint’s meat snapping off in chunks, until Steve couldn’t take it anymore.
Steve reached the end of the page with a growing sense of dislike—of the sender taking for granted the cooperation of people, even when addressing their apparent reluctance himself. Yet other than his selfishness, he was at lost why Fury had kept it; there were a number of things that would alarm him, had buying and receiving rail bonds as bribes not been so common among the rich; and so, Steve was reduced to staring at the handwriting itself.
There was a series of relieved exclamations at the news and Tony allowed his panic to recede. He straightened a little higher. The old Hammer in front of him strode over to his son, carded his knobby fingers through the bloodied hair, and spoke, “Is the doctor on the way?”
With a start, it occurred to Steve that when Jarvis had spoken of family, he meant there had been a
“I know.”
Steve raised his glass. “Drinks are cheaper, though.”
“Yes? Oh, Colonel Ross.” Tony’s voice underwent a visible modification. “Good morning.”
“Do you know where your husband is at the moment, Sheriff?” Fury barked, abandoning all pretense now. “Your deputies fed me some real thick horseshit about him visiting an ill aunt and that he would be back when she’s better.”
“Hello, Steve,” he said.
“Maybe,” suggested Tony, “he realized last time he only needs to graze someone’s temple to have everyone jump at the chance to tie the noose themselves?”
“Stark?”
“Are — you —
All at once, the fact that the bridge had been burned (and the forge possibly still ablaze), so sorely troubling only a quarter of an hour ago, recurred to Steve now with a disconcerting novelty. The urgency of the situation waved at him like a salvation—a distraction.
“Much, thanks. I was just planting, sir. Petunias, I mean.”
It was the voice of Natasha.
“Should we wait for another train?” suggested Scott as though this was all a rather interesting day trip; Steve wished he would show a little more investment. There were bigger things at stake than a dame.
“You believe there’s a single cause for this?”
Tony sucked in his cheeks; finding it very hard to hold Steve’s gaze just then. “Well, yeah, it’s … it’s … it’s good to be alive.”
“Yeah … all right,” stammered Hammer, gesturing vaguely about, “treat yourself with something from the spread.”
“A split,” said Tony, perfunctorily. “It’s more common than you think, no need to make a big deal out of it.”
Steve pursed lips, feeling as though he had just bit on something very bitter as he watched Peter skid away.
“Are you still checking up on me?” Tony asked. Despite his breezy note, he didn’t look it. Steve could tell that this loss of trust had come as a real blow to him. One night had changed everything.
“For gentry you move quicker than I thought.”
“I can’t believe it,” said Bucky as they had to slow to a walk, hooves clattering. “Even their
[A/N]
… but he had been threatened …
“Steve,” he said around the bite, rising up, “a word.”
Somehow, this show of pride served as a point in his favour, instead of a point of irritation to Tony. It was, perhaps, the fact that despite all his poise, he had a fault.
Coulson’s gaze met his. Then he looked down at his options. “Cavalry it is. Final rank?”
Awkwardly, Tony’s hands not releasing their grip, Jarvis reached out a hand to trail a finger down Tony’s cheek.
Tony was already walking away when Hammer recovered enough to shout: “Though from what I’ve gathered, you’ve enjoyed enough!”
“That’s what she did?” said Natasha. “Idiotic woman. Never liked her.”
Steve had been expecting the topic to come up ever since Clint warned him, but he found himself tensing as he forced himself to look Fury directly in the eyes, noticing as he did so that the patch was definitely Tony’s handiwork, from the quality of the leather to the neat stitching. This did not help.
“It’s Rogers.”
“Taken?” Steve asked him and was surprised his voice sounded so calm as he stepped back into the bedroom. “I don’t think so.”
“Bureaucracy,” Fury replied, shrugging. “Had to tick all the boxes.”
But before Steve had registered…
Let’s go somewhere. A holiday. Do you remember Sacramento?”
It was all on the table now. Maybe that was better. Steve didn’t do well with ambiguous communication. He would rather know the score.
It was easy, once in the shadows of the building, to retrieve their weapons from the pommel bags and from between the folds of their rolled blankets, for the fog had thickened. Steve stared at his own roll, and the army suit from within. Perhaps Stane the kind of man he would rather kill in uniform instead of scrubby jeans … or perhaps the button-spangled front would glint even though the mist … but Steve threw it on anyway, for, after the sweltering heat of the factory, the evening outside felt cold on his skin.
The room burst into loud arguments.
Steve, propping his elbows on his knees, muscles wound tight, gave Fury a peeved look.
“You’re deaf but you’re talking loud,” Tony said snidely. “For your information, violence and engineering are known to be bad bedfellows.”
on that doomed carriage.
“Obadiah Stane arrived on SS France days after, however, we’re still waiting on the confirmation.”
and more about the
Steve heard a noise start; slowly, and then all at once; suddenly so unbearable they clapped their hands over their ears—then, once the high pitch had seemingly filled the whole hall, it reached what sounded like a breaking point—and it gave away to a yowling
“Don’t leave on my account,” he pleaded.
As he crossed the dark street, Sam’s horse looked up from the hitching post, neighed softly, then resumed its dozing. Steve stopped under the porch of Bruce’s house, staring at the chipped paint of the front door, rubbing his throbbing hand, and thought of Tony.
“Then they’d better pick well,” Steve said, standing up with a creak of boot leather and reached to rip off his star.
“I thought about telling you then … but … everything went pear-shaped.” Bruce looked equally sheepish from what Steve saw from between his errant strands. “Sorry.”
“Well, you offered me a nightcap. Then made a pass or two. And dropped like a light around two. Figured I’d let you rest.”
“When I see something gone wrong,” he said simply, “I can’t just sit still and watch.”
“So … can I leave now?” Steve ventured.
No answer. Steve gave the man a none too gentle shake.
“The grapevine works harder than I thought,” said Sam.
“You know more about me than I realized,” he said. “Did you grieve when he died?”
“She’s good security,” he said.
“It was a long time ago. I cannot pretend it has not felt even longer. On that day, they—the whole family—attended a charity ball for Free Hospital. I watched them leave from the front door. Curious,” he said, “how to this day I still remember how they were dressed, how I promised I would have supper ready by eight. They always ate at eight, even if sometimes separately. Still … they never came back. After they had left, a kitchen maid from across the street came running while I was polishing the dinnerware. The way the girl rattled the door I thought—” There was a tremble to his hands that had little to do with his age. “There had been an explosion.”
“Steel,” Fury sneered. “It’s like they’ve forgotten that our best metalworker is missing in action.”
“Avoid touching it—guess that’s the least I can hope for, given your profession.” He stirred his tea. “You know, modern medicine is headed to being less about the
“You,” Steve said slowly, “are fine because Bruce studied at Harvard and had a friend in a new, special branch of medicine they call neuroscience. To tell the truth, it sounds a little shaky to me.”
Steve raised his brows at Fury. “Long name.”
Something was going on. Three weeks ago—it felt like much more, but it had been three, lonely weeks—Tony had told him how much he suffered from having nothing to do. And tonight, for the first time in two years, Tony had come home drunk. What did these things mean?
“In case it’s of any help, this,” he said, bringing forth a silvery key, “was found in Tiberius’ pocket.”
Mystified, Tony climbed over the solid, square seat, trying not to knee Rogers at the back of his head. Without the divide of the back, it suddenly felt very intimate to share the same seat. At a sharp bend, Tony felt himself slide towards him despite the ridged upholstery.
“Thought wrong, then, didn’t you,” he said finally, picking up a winding key and a knife from the mantelpiece.
“Sir, I — yes, sir, but I — no, understood, sir — right away, sir.”
said Tony. “You truly are grasping at straws.”
“Hard to notice under that …
All at once, Stark Industries appeared—not as a structure seen from far, but a mammoth, emerging behind another factory. It’s vast Victorian red-brick façade covered almost two city blocks on its own. Above this, in the immensity of the towering structure, it was all ambition, competition, domination, even lust—for size, power and, always, money.
“Who?”
“Let’s lock him up — just to be sure,” he said, his eyes gleaming with savage triumph. There was an indecent excitement in his voice, the same callous pleasure Tony had heard as he reminded Tony of the inquiry. “The pantry will do.”
Steve trod on his toes because, despite the man’s obvious age, the look he bent upon Clint showed that his mind was not so addled under his a long, worn jacket and washed-out, pin-striped pants.
No, the thing that was bothering Tony was that the last time he had been dealt like this, he had known who was behind it … but he was none the wiser, now … the idea that somebody he had looked into the eyes tonight had secretly been plotting another murder to frame Tony for, was alarming, unsettling…
With that, he took the thief by the armpit. He stomped off, the dumbfounded rustler struggling in his hold, his boots digging grooves into the dry street in their wake.
Rogers simply smiled.
But Steve never did find out if he could have pressed the trigger, for at that moment sound rose from downhill, so large-sounding and steady that that Steve and Stane alike looked around. The air was suddenly full of rhythmic, metallic clicking; behind Steve’s back, a cable car thundered up towards the square. The light of the lamps played at its sides but offered little illumination for the driver to identify the beam laying on the tracks; a scream of brakes pierced the December evening, closely followed by the slow, ominous creak of the grip car listing to the left—until it toppled over, bringing along with it the trailer.
Tony had run to him and set his cup down on the hardwood floor with a thud; he must have seen, too, that the most colorful thing on Jarvis’ face remained a liver spot. But as he gazed upon Tony for the first time in almost two decades, Steve got the feeling life had been breathed into the old man.
See you on Wednesday/Thursday! xx
“Oh boy,” Tony said sharply.
“Tea?” he offered. “No? Ah, I see. This is personal.”
He brushed past Steve, his scowl emphasizing the scar on his brow which cast a severe shadow upon his forehead. Steve clung tighter onto the eggs. One pace, two, three, and then on fourth, the man glanced back, and at being caught looking, hastily turned away.
“How … how did he die?” Tony asked, still looking at Dummy.
“Yes.”
Suspicion risen, Steve observed his retreating back with squinted eyes. Looking back where the man came from, there were shallow impressions on the ground from his boots. Steve trailed them backwards; the little lane along which he was walking curved and joined the main street where the trail disappeared.
“Have you been drinking?” she asked suspiciously, leaning closer to his face.
A sharp ripple of murmurs spread from under the unlit chandeliers to the dimly illuminating windows. Many silhouettes could be seen turning towards the ceiling. Then a glass shattered. Somebody screamed.
“… our best lead, who we didn’t even know we had, was lost right on the eve of investigating Stane? That doesn’t seem suspicious to any of you?”
get the worm.”
“I thought the gentlemen would be in need of refreshments.”
They truly were as black ash, Steve thought, and was visited by a strange, impossible memory—
“Lorrimer rang for him five minutes ago,” said a new voice from the door. “The police are on the way.”
“Never thought I would miss your pining,” Bucky said, breaking Steve’s trail of thought. “This, whatever this is, is worse. Way worse.”
At first, he thought Tony hadn’t heard this either.
. JARVIS!” he bellowed.
“The letter!” Steve blurted out suddenly. “The one Bruce found—it’s from
“Even more reason for you to get out. Thank you, bye-bye. When I want to be saved by a colonist, I now know who to call.”
“You need medical attention,” Sam insisted but mechanically offered his hand for support and pulled Steve vertical again.
This was his chance, thought Steve, who wrenched, legs fighting for grip, ribs smarting, Stane’s armed hand up where the second bullet was fired towards the sky; the third was discharged at half-cock. Steve’s grip on the gun was strong; Stane had to lean back with all of his mass to tug it off. And, when Stane finally tugged it free, it was with such tremendous force that the sudden loss of resistance sent him continuing his motion … and he tumbled down six steps. Steve stepped over Stane’s weapon—landed two steps higher—on his way to where Stane had crumbled in a heap; groaning, a string of bloodied spit creating a bridge between him and the step. His hands felt at his waistcoat, increasingly panicked.
As the weeks had crept on, Steve could not help but notice, even through the haze of his new misery, that Bucky seemed to be taking charge. Perhaps because he was determined to make up for having put Steve through the torturous night of dance; perhaps because of Steve’s descent into torpidity stimulated his dormant knack for leadership, Bucky was now the one at the head of investigation.
Here you see-the four of us,
“Absolutely, my grief is nothing to yours, Anthony. Bearing flowers for your old man? I’m touched, I really am. What a hero, your dad. Should I do my service, too, do you think?”
Sam whistled. “Vanderbilt who?”
Obie remained unperturbed. He sniffed at his half-full snifter and watched the golden liquid swirl in its bowl.
“I saw, well, this is terribly awkward.” She was wringing her hands. “I saw how Mr. Rogers—your husband—locked the door and left. Then, later, after I had slept very little because I was so troubled, I happened to pass by the window again. It was open so I could get some air, but the smell! Why, I thought it would burn my nose right off! Then I saw
Steve didn’t hear the rest, for he was staring at the bottom of the industrial table. Its legs had been
Bucky, who had been taking a sip of water, choked. Sam banged him on the back as Bucky couched, shooting a wet-eyed, alarmed glance at Steve, who now knew the old man’s tale had won over another.
Steve shrugged, but arduously so, because Tony had started to make little noises in his sleep. His body twitched.
“You know what I want when we get back?” he said and smacked his lips. “A coffee. Given how bad it is, I think they soak patients’ old socks in it in this joint.”
“Case proceeding well, I take?” asked Tony, amused, but Steve had already turned his attention back to the neatly scribbled line of names and places in his notes. He did not do any new marks, but simply rifled though from page to page with intention, as though he recalled exactly where everything was located. Tony stayed quite still; he did not want to break Steve’s concentration.
“Is it your job, though?” said Natasha in an undertone. “You’re not the lone gunslinger, Steve.”
“Is it possible someone, an outsider, had pulled Anthony away from the carnage?” Steve asked, feeling mildly sick.
But someone had, someone had succeeded in killing him and had not got caught. The men who had killed Lincoln were supposed to be locked away, if not dead … having acted alone, and without a country-shaking masterplan to destroy America…
Tony had his answer ready.
“Ant—” Bucky broke off into a tremendous cough. “Mr. Pym.”
Still, Steve saw Happy hover as they withdrew indoors. They lead Jarvis to their desks, arranged so that there were room for five chairs in the middle. Showing an admirable presence of mind, Sam rushed to cover the fifth in a wool blanket for Jarvis who seated himself gratefully, leaving Sam, Clint, Bucky and Steve to squeeze side by side on the facing chairs.
It was …
The temperature of the cell might have dropped several degrees along with the sobering subject. Bucky and Sam were angled towards each other, chairs swung around, whereas, behind them, Clint was looking at them avidly. Jarvis’ eyes appeared to be alarmedly swiveling backwards and forwards from one man to another.
“And you had no reason to go near the drawing room windows?”
A murmur rose around the benches. Some of the gathered crowd were eyeing Strucker with pronounced outrage, others with mild interest. Then Steve heard, quite distinctly, from Bucky’s other side, a muttered voice saying, “Bastard.”
“Despite the civil casualties, it was clear that Howard Stark had always been the intended target, suggesting it was done by radical opponents of his new direction in social justice. But to kill the whole family … what an unnecessary waste of life. But Anthony survived, did he not? The problem is, according to every practitioner of medicine and several other scientists, he
“Sorry, sir,” he apologized. “I just couldn’t help but notice today was far more fruitful for you than it was for us.”
“Now that’s a bad idea, if I’ve ever heard one,” said Sam.
“And what kind of man would let a paranoiac Mayor lure him into his megalomaniac schemes to protect the town he lives in?”
“Funny, I’d have thought you were going to want to shake off the shadows as soon as physically possible…”
The jacket looked stiffer and heavier than Steve remembered but it had been collecting dust tucked away in the corner of his trunk, wrapped around his medal for fifteen years.
“Sheriff?” The hallway door opened and bumped into Steve’s shoulder. A harried-looking man apologized, and continued, “A fight has broken out, we need you at the courtroom.”
Over at the belly of the overturned car, Stane went rigid. Although he was too far to see, the suspicion clouding his eyes was easy to read from his more secured grip on the bomb as his eyes roved over the seemingly unchanged expanse.
“Steve!” Sam said in great relief.
“Anything he can get his hands on, apparently. He’s been going on about this … armor he needs to build around us, whatever that means…”
Tony doubled back to the stairs and down to the hall, where there were only two visible, far-apart doors. The one on the left belong to the dining room, the other to the drawing room. However, Tony was privy to one more: hidden midst the panels of the stair’ flank was a door that opened to the forbidden land of Howard. Tony had never entered his father’s workshop here. He pushed open the door, fingers fumbling for a switch.
And sure enough, a figure had appeared in the yard, and as Tony walked briskly towards him Tiberius Stone lifted his slow gaze from where he was leaning against Tony’s Cadillac, which was yet to cool from the ride. He flicked ash off his cigarette, while Tony eyed unhappily the shoe braced on the red hub cap.
“Until Tony,” agreed Steve.
Steve did, but he was not going to help Fury get there.
If you're reading this, you've just gone through a 13K chapter. Whoops. It was either going to be 8K + 5K but the endings didn't quite satisfy...
Then, standing further in the hall, they found him.
“Is this your usual pair of boots?” he asked.
Toomes swiftly wet his lips as all their gazes fell on his feet, looking upon the hobnailed, muddy but unremarkable boots.
Jarvis was laying on a bed near the window. This offered him a good field of vision of the main street below, where he had no doubt caught their approach. He winced a little as he shifted his propped position upon the bed.
Steve had lost track of the conversation.
“As you are aware, Howard Anthony Walter Stark’s last Will and Testament has remained mostly unaltered for several years now.”
At this, Steve exhaled loudly. “I do not know.”
beneficial.”
He rose up again, this time to remove the velvet curtains hiding a patinated frame, and eyed avidly the rather racy picture of a naked man revealed beneath.
“Too busy.” He shot Bucky a look from under his brow and found him visibly skeptical. “Don’t you think it’s a little … soon?”
Steve had been on the point of extracting his notes. Looking as though he had been forced to swallow a lemon, he let it slip back into the depths of the deep trouser pocket again; behind Tony, Toomes almost tripped on his own boots in his haste to take the offered chance to get away.
“The Sheriff?” he suggested in a tone that made it clear he consider it a nice joke. His quiet friend seemed to agree, letting out a tentative chortle. “Hundred dollars, that’s what’s been the wage far back as I can remember. A hero or not, the state can’t be paying him more than fraction of that for his service in war in addition.”
“There is
Sam perked up. “What did his face look like?”
Tony levelled him a look.
“Help!
“Sir — how —?”
were they so slow? Then, they overheard them.
Not one to be outdone, Tony fired, “One more cheeky comment, and I’ll wheel you to a retirement home.” And then to Jarvis’ retreating figure: “I’ve already signed you up for a quilting bee!”
“Forget indifference, I’m officially livid right now. You need to hold yourself in higher esteem than jumping at the first sign of a pretty pair of pleated pants.”
[A/N]
Barnes was staring again. Then he seemed to pull himself together and said with slight effort, “It’s been a few weeks. Unfortunately, I can’t say the circumstances have changed much.”
For a place he had been firmly denied entrance to, it was boring: the thing that best caught his attention was a perforated sheet Tony could not guess the use for.
started Scott but was cut off as Sam and Bucky elbowed their way to Steve’s side. Irrationally, Steve thought that this had not helped in making his newest friend less starstruck; his adrenaline released its hold in the form of a hysteric giggle.
“You were the one warning me against attending that damn party!”
For three weeks, Steve forgot the warnings of his friends. September turned to October and the rains came. Water flowed from the mountains toward the valley, flooding the river. The hills glowed golden with the color-changing flora.
“Steve,” Sam said on the third day, “you’re running yourself ragged. I’m worried about you—we’re worried about you.”
“I’ll leave you to eat,” said Rogers, looking rather relieved as he started to walk towards the driveway. Tony remained standing in the shadow of the trees, gaze fixed on the back of a retreating blond head that was infuriatingly not to blame for this.
Nothing made sense.
“And how long has having them arrested taken you?”
However, he had dropped some snippets: the man had big expectations for a new kind of Stark’s six-shooter about to hit commercial markets. A train loaded full of metal parts on its way to San Francisco had weighted so much that the Half Mile Bridge had needed steel reinforcement. The debate on who should pay for the costs had went to court the week before—where Obadiah Stane himself had been in attendance.
“Will you and your purse be joining us for breakfast?” Sam called from the fireplace.
There was no change of expression in Peggy’s face, though the rather quick shift of her lashes, to hood her eyes, gave her away.
They were truly home now: only a hundred miles laid between them and their house, and that distance now sounded merely a fraction of what it had been a week ago. Steve looked at Tony and saw this realization in his eyes, too.
Here, he leaned over a spindle-legged side table and slapped the needle of a gramophone down, letting the swell of the music fill the room, his erratic brain, his scattered thoughts…
But we will find out soon
There was a long pause no one knows what to say about the situation, until Tobias spoke “what are you gonna do now dad, how are you gonna find him and put him away for good”. Tony looked at his son sadly, he knew Jarvis can help with that and Thor with his training and Bruce with the search like they before when it came to missions. But as angry as he is he would need the other three, they spy twins with there well spying and Steve, well I guess he would do anything to protect Peggy but Tony he’s not sure on that one.
Tony stared for a second before he actually answered, “y-yeah sure I like that very Steve” he smiled knowing this is the first time calling Rogers by his first name. Steve smiles back “great I got get us some drink I’ll be back in a second” then he turned around and went back inside.
“Oh sweetheart, come sit down and talk to me” she said with care. So tony did and told her what happen today, about the mission and what he found. He told her what he was feeling and about what he thinking. It went on and on until tony felt his throat sore and his eyes burn with tears.
[unknown location]
~~~~~~~~
Fury took them in the debriefing room, silent filled the air and you can cut tension with a knife. Steve knew what he did was wrong and he went too far, but he also wants to argue that he wasn’t the only one to blame.
Tony close the fridge door, but kept his head down, he felt a little bit ashamed of himself. He knew that Tobias would ask that question but he just wanted things to feel a little bit normal for once. He sighed and look at his son, “Yeah ok Bambi, come take sit down” Tony said whilst he gestured towards the couch.
“Bucky hang on”
To his surprise, Steve’s had a shock look to his face he but he didn’t seem angry or disappointed. “yes!, I mean yeah of course I’m happy to do that just let me know the time and place ok” Steve replies almost too quickly. Well this is awkward, the silence was not what Tony had in mind he better finish this before it gets even more unbearable, “ok cool, great so urr... I’ll... yeah  right great see you later cap, better go” he said try not to sound nervous.
What do you think of the this? and what do you guys want for the next one ?
~~~~~~~~~
Pepper roll her eyes and huff in frustration. “For god sakes tony, when are ever going to realise that there are people to be considered, today I wanted to treat you to a nice dinner for your birthday I wanted us to have a great time like we use to have before everything got crazy is that too much to ask” She ranted.
It looks very fancy with a velvet chair in the corner of the room, vintage wall lights place in each four corners of the room and a very large oak wardrobe place by exit. The rich dark red paint on the top half of the room, whilst clean white colour paint is on the bottom half of the room.
Like always apologies for any misspellings or bad grammar.
Tony smiled back, then he focus on the task at hand, he took a deep breath then close his eyes, well here go nothing he thought to himself.
“Right so the kid he’s my son, and as you can imagine I was young to have had him” he started, Steve gave a frown at the behaviour that Tony was giving out something was wrong here “how old where you Tony?” He said in a rather kindly voice.
“Very well, make sure our men are ready for the assault” he ordered, “yes sir” the agent replied. Daniel then proceeded to leave, but as he was walking he sees the general leaning against the door “so you got everything ready Captain?” He questions with a arrogant smirk on his face.
There was a long pause for a moment until Howard spoke “Right I should really explain why I’m here shouldn’t I” Tony raised his eyebrow “that would be ideal” Howard chuckles at his son’s sass, yet another first he never really heard his father laugh which look genuine then the laughs he used at a gala or the press.
Stark rolled his eyes again and said “ look spangles, your not wrong ever since that night things became calmer between us, so if you want to fuck my ass again you can meet me in my room. You know we’re that is don’t you cap” Stark finished his drink, then got up from his seat and left the kitchen.
After a second of peace a familiar voice spoke behind him “Ah so you finally made it”. Tony turned around and his eyes widen in shock.
(See the end of the chapter for
Then warmth touch his back, he turned around and saw a white light it look beautiful. He knew what that was and started to run towards it, he needed to catch before it disappeared like the other times. “Wait!” He shouted, he kept running not stopping once he was close he was almost there.
TBC..........
“ hey dad um how am I gonna get to your tower exactly?” He ask with worry. But his dad just grinned at him “Your a smart boy Toby why I’m gonna take you to the tower myself” Tobias didn’t look convince that this was a good idea “I don’t think that’s a smart idea dad” he argue back with a frown. But Tony just laugh “hey don’t sass me kid I know what I’m doing” he vaguely explains, “Yeah right” Tobias mutters.
“My comrades, Anthony’s AI explain there was an incident. Are you both alright?” He ask, both spies nodded “Yeah Thor we’re both okay, Tash just needs her shoulder and burns to look at but nothing serious. As to the incident one of our own was a double agent and an explosion” Clint informs.
Tony looked at everyone he was scared at telling them what has happened in his life. Even though Thor already knows about his past, he was scared what the others would think about, his abilities, his kid and his rape. But he doesn’t have a chose he needs to do this to protect his family and his friends.
Steve’s smiles at the interaction with Tony and Peggy he’s happy that they are a family. But then he stop smiling when he saw Tobias giving him a good old death glare in the corner of his eye, “um listen Tobias I just want to say that....” “your what.., sorry for basically calling my dad a whore, why are you even up here you should just fuck off” Tobias interrupts him angrily, which made Steve feel even more guilty at what he said to Tony.
~~~~~~~
Tony ready to find his soul but what he also gets was a surprise visitor.
But I hope you like the chapter 😊
His mom seems to know what he was thinking and spoke “of you are gonna need their help you know you have to tell don’t you? Are you willing to take that risk my darling?” She said gently. Tobias and Davis seem they wanted to protest about this, but Peggy spoke again “if you think your going to protest then I suggest you stop there, it Tony’s decision” and both of them shut there mouths quickly.
Both the spy twins gave steve an unconvinced look, but Natasha was the one to speak first. “ Steve it’s ok to be a bit jealous, look Stark is known to be a slut and the fact that him and Thor seem to be close isn’t a surprise he does like his men to be pack with muscle” she joke. “I wouldn’t blame you to feel a bit down that another member of our team is also having fun with the spoiled genius. But you got to remember that this is what stark does how he uses his body to get his way in life so don’t take it to heart ok Steve. And besides I know a SHEILD agent that might be perfect for you”.
Tony snorted “yes spangles, yet again I disobey your orders and so what my plan had work we didn’t need to use your plan as that would certainly took up so much time. so you could thank me now or later as you can use up all your free time and at the gym hitting more bags or better yet go find your bestie” tony brag but on inside he was nervous but he couldn’t show weakness not to him.
I don’t want them to hate me more than they already do” tony said sadly.
Tony nods his head “thanks J”, then he turns to his family and smiles, “it’s now or never” he said and Peggy give him a comforting squeeze on the shoulder. Tony turns to the elevator waiting for Fury, Steve and the others it’s now or never was his thought one last time as the elevator doors open.
Please feel free to comment or kudos
“I see, then I won’t say anything to the others, but tony I should stress that you are nothing like you portray to the press and the others should have seen this but apparently not, which is a shame on them and not you” he promise , which tony was grateful for.
Fury turns to Steve and Bruce, “I see that you couldn’t rest for a bit longer then Captain” Fury said. “Yeah you know there’s a lot going on for me to keep still” he replies to Fury, He Director snorted and gave him a nod to join in the meeting.
~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~
“So you want us to become fuck buddies?”
Tony just rolled his eyes “seriously I’m healthy fuck you very much, anyways you better go Rogers you don’t want the team thinking we’re together do we now”
They all looked a Fury and each one spoke why they should stay “Because we are the best you got Sir” Clint said arrogant but true. “ You said I should look a Tony behind the mask and you are right and I saw that today and I want to make it right” Natasha spoke next, finally Fury thought. Steve was next “ I realise today I did something wrong and I hurt Tony and if you give me a chance Sir I’ll try to make that right I promise” he said with sadness and sincerity.
Tony was minding his own business, he was in his work shop upgrading Rogers suit, even they are not besties or even lovers. Tony however still cares about Rogers safety and all the other avengers safety as well, so he will happily make new toys for them and upgrade their armour.
But Clint was the one who spoke first “ um Steve buddy you gotta give us some more details than that” he said with Natasha nodding in agreement.
(See the end of the chapter for
So what do you think, what will Daniel be plotting and what will happen when Peggy and Davis come to the tower.
Bruce felt happy but at the same time sadden, “you’re conflicted” Peggy said, that surprise Bruce “how did you...” “it’s what Tony told you earlier our family has an ability that can see people auras which also shows your emotions as well” ‘ah’ Bruce remembers “oh yes, and your right I haven’t been a good friend to him, don’t get me wrong I care for him I just... well I should have been there for him more I’m sorry” he apologises and looks down in shame.
Of course Rogers wants to see him after the little stunt he done well I was he had to face the music.
And most importantly what was that file that Fury was looking at well you find out soon in the next few chapters
Hello again back with a new chapter, so this one has a consensual sex scene though it rough, hate sex but tony consented. Also side note I’m not great with writing sex scenes so hopefully it’s not too bad.
Tony quiet down his laughed, his son was safe but the danger is still out there, it’s been so long since he last saw that man and he hope he would have never seen him but he guess you can’t get everything that you wanted. He would make sure his son is safe and his mom too, he doesn’t care what the other avengers would think of him because right now his family is all that matters.
Tony and Steve walk to Thors room in awkward silence, Steve wanted to speak to Tony but he just feared that if he said something that could offend him that he would be sent away. And he didn’t want that so he just stayed silent.
They got to the tower into Tony’s penthouse. Tobias was thankful for that as he thought for a moment he was actually going to die, “oh thank god I didn’t die” he breathed out. Tony just rolled his eyes as he got out of the suit, oh don’t be so dramatic Bambi” he tease, Tobias pouted which is cute in Tony’s opinion anyways “if the shoes was in the other foot dad you won’t be saying that would you” Tony chuckle “kid the sass on you is killing me” he tease “And I wonder were I got that from” Tobias smirk.
Hello everyone I’m back
Edit........
Tony gave her a sad look “I’m.... not doing great mom” he said with honesty. Peggy look sad back and tony could see in her eyes that she knew what it is today.
He can only hope that this wouldn’t break him.
He stretch out his hand ready to touch his light, to touch his soul. But! The darkness crept back and lighting struck his head, he lost the light, he was falling no not again.
But something was wrong, tony felt everyone auras and they were all distorted, manipulated into something dark and tony didn’t like it. But why did it only effect them and not him he wondered, then there was an explosion so he had to figure that out later.
First was that fact he was dying from his own reactor, palladium poisoning Ha! What a joke. He was starting to get out of control again, he had that disaster of a birthday party, he drank more, doing a hell of a lot of inventing binges and started to push everyone away even his own son, he didn’t want his Bambi to see him like that, he wanted to protect him even from himself.
“You know Peggy once told me that this neckless was special and had some magic to it” John said pulling Tony out of his trance from the neckless. Tony snorted “seriously magic come on do you really believe that?” He ask. But John just shrugged “you never know” he smiled. Tony felt a vibration from his watch and looked at it “shit” he exclaimed it was 5:30pm he needed to go back to home to get ready for the gala.
Tony turned his head to look at Rogers and simply said, “ I don’t have to defend myself for anything but if you want to join me well please do” he said in a sultry voice if this work than Rogers will jump him and give a good night and hopefully that would help him forget for a little while.
“Well yes Mr Stark, there have been a few people that visit her. Ms carters grandson Tobias, Mr Rhode, of course Mr Rogers seen her a couple of days ago and another visit by a named Mr Davis” she answered back.
“That’s not fair, don’t you dare bring up my mistakes like that. I was ...” Tony cried but couldn’t finish his sentence as yet again Steve spoke up and it just got worse.
Thor gave him a small smile “ I’ve known who you are since the battle of New York, I thought at first you didn’t tell us, because you didn’t know us, but we’ve been a team for a while now and with your abilities we can become stronger but yet you don’t tell us still why?” He ask kindly.
“That’s a good plan, JARVIS can you inform Bruce about this please” Steve agrees, “of course Captain”. Steve then helps Tony to his feet as Tony still felt weaken by he could feel his strength getting back to him. As they both reach the elevator and head up to the penthouse, Tony couldn’t shake the feeling that something wasn’t right about this but he can only hope that they can prevent anything bad form happening before it was too late.
Once Tony was at his sons door, he quietly open the door, as he didn’t want to disturb his sons sleep.
It was Peggy, Davis, Tobias and Tony that was left in the room. The others had left with Fury god knows what he’s going to say to them after what has been revealed.
Tony was confused were are they going “ wait aren’t we going to train at the training room?” Tony ask and Thor just chuckled which tony felt a little bit insulted by.
He told JARVIS to go faster, which his AI comply. He was closer to his sons destination and he hope that his son was safe and I’d anything ever happens to him he wouldn’t know what he would do. “Bambi please be safe” he whispered o himself.
It was three months after tony was born, Fury was in his office going through some files for Peggy. It was relatively a boring day not much going on as for missions and what not which isn’t a bad thing.
Steve chokes on his own spit when Clint spoke. “W-What are you talking about Clint I’m not jealous, jealous of what?” He stuttered.
Tony sighed in frustration he didn’t want the others to know this part yet but you know what they say begged can’t be choosers “Thor please don’t hurt Steve, despite what he has said we need him but I do appreciate your some what overprotectiveness of me” Tony smile and throw the hammer back to Thor like it was nothing.
~~~~~~~~~
Tony looks at Thor for a bit, gets it that Thor is just trying to help, but what if he’s wrong and he can’t do this. Yeah Thor did say it will take weeks or perhaps years, but still Tony’s a genius he should be able to do this.
But the real question is why now? Why did she suddenly appear here of all places and what does she want. “How, w-what are you doing here?” he sneered at her with a shaky voice.
All three of them were eating lunch together. They were all sitting at the large table in the common room which usually every avenger could sit together, but mostly it’s used my them, Bruce and sometimes Thor. But never Stark, which in a way frustrates Steve as he wants to bond as a team, but yet again he’s not a fan of Stark even though they have sex when things get too much for both of them.
Tony was worried that his mom was worse but also was relieved that she might be able to recognise him today. “Ok thanks for letting me know, um has anyone else visit her recently?” He asked.
Oh great, (sigh) why does Rogers have to be like this. Every time they are on a mission, ok Tony can admit that he does disobey Rogers order, but not because for the hell of it. No, it’s because he found a better way to defeat the bad guy, or there is a innocent civilian that got caught in the cross fire. So yeah they are all valid reasons for his disobedience, but does the good Captain notice. Hell no, after the mission, after the debriefing, Rogers will come barging into Tony’s lab, floor or even the common room and what will he do shout at him and treats like a child, calling him selfish and telling to never do it again or he will kick him off the team blah blah blah.
He turned out the director “ What the hell happened?” He ask. “ Well until the other two are here Tony and I will explain and let I remind you Doctor Banner that before accusing someone maybe you should hear the facts first, I thought you know this since you have had similar experience” he chastised and Bruce look down with guilt he was right maybe he was too quick to judge Tony after all Tony has never judge him and he accepted the other guy. “Puny Banner stupid, being mean to Tin man” Hulk grumbles in his head, Hulk always seems to chastised him every time he said some not so nice comment about Tony. Bruce thought it was strange how the other guy care so much about Tony maybe he seen something in his friend that he has yet to see.

Please enjoy and sorry for any misspellings or bad grammar
It’s time for the rest of the gang to share their thoughts about a certain genius, and some of them definitely have very low opinions about the billionaire, but one opinion is the opposite.
Please feel free to comment or kudos
Tony looked at the others, “you ready my merry men and woman” he joke but the others except for Thor didn’t laugh, wow tough crowed.
Anyways hope you enjoy and sorry for any misspellings or bad grammar
“Ouch” the boy cried as Peggy flicks his ear “Behave Tobias, you made Doctor Banner more nervous, I apologise for my grandsons behaviour Doctor please don’t mind him” Peggy apologises. “Oh um it’s alright Ms Carter I’m already use with your own sons teasing as it is he didn’t cause any offence” Bruce assures Peggy.
“Anthony, I can promise you that I won’t allow that and I doubt they will kick you off the team for having abilities, if they did wouldn’t they kick me and Bruce off too and wouldn’t steve be kick off as well for having enhance abilities too” Thor said.
“Yes Captain Rogers” Jarvis replied
“It’s almost time for me to go this was only a one time use so I’ll be quick” Howard vaguely. “Quick at what...urgh” Tony grunts in surprise as he felt warmth wrapped around him. Howard was hugging him and not only that he was glowing “ this is my last gift for you Anthony you finally got what you’re looking for, so I’ll give you a little idea I had for that blade of yours, and with it you can kick Daniel ass for me would you” he spoke with such emotion in his voice.
“Anyways, everyone expect you Tony you al can just walk around and talk to a few people. Let them get to know you and improve your PR, I recommend for you Captain to talk to some of the military men and women they would love to talk you” Steve slightly chuckle at that “will do Miss Potts” he replied.

Tobias was sitting on the couch with his laptop on his lap writing out his thesis for his second degree in in criminal law.
Hello everyone
“ I was wanted to know a few things about Stark that’s all I need some calcification” he said and then process to walk out of the tower.
Steve didn’t want really want to admit that he needed help, back in the 40s men who seek help are sometimes deemed as weak or crazy. But that was then and this is now so maybe it’s time to break that mentality and start a new. “Your right Peg, I got this friend his name is Sam he might be able to help me to the correct help and for what it’s worth, I am so sorry for what i have done Peggy” he said sincerely, Peggy he place her hand on top of Steve’s hand “I know” she whispered and with that they enjoyed a little bit of a moments silence before Steve had to and help the others.
Then everything went black.
John smiled at Tony with fondness and walk straight toward the couch and placed the two cups of coffee he had in his hands down on to the table. He sat down next to Tony then spoke “Why are you here Tony I haven’t seen you for a long time? Don’t get me wrong I loved it when you visit me but I see that something’s troubling you” He ask gently.
That shock the two spy’s, “But Sir didn’t you hear anything we have said” Clint plead.
He needed to try, maybe they were right and Stark was this great guy but so far he hasn’t seen that. Maybe because Stark hasn’t given him the opportunity to see that or maybe because Steve himself has been struggling with his own demons and hasn’t been really seeing and positives about Stark. But god damn it he’ll try to speak to Stark and maybe they can get closer into becoming something civil, god help him.
Fury was sitting at his desk, at SHEILD headquarters. He was reading a file that some nervous agent gave to him saying it was urgent. Now Fury thought it was the same old thing, a Hydra base that needed to be dealt with.
Yay back again with a new chapter hope you like it though it’s a bit shorter than my other chapters.
“You think I’m jealous Stark, please your nothing but a hole to use” he said sharply and Tony wince, he hated when people call him disgusting names to him about this sexual preference. “What’s the matter Stark, not going to snark back have I actually shut you up” Steve mocked as he moved closer towards Tony. Tony however step back, he’s not gonna lie he felt scared he knows Steve would never to anything sinister towards him but he can’t help that feels what felt like when Daniel hurt him. He hoped that the spy twins would realise that this is too far and stop Steve. he looked at them with begging eyes, but they didn’t seem to care. Clint was smirking while Natasha was... well he didn’t know what she was thinking she looked concern which was strange to him.
“Peggy what’s going on? Why are you here?” Steve pleas. Peggy looked at him with disappointment but also she was sadden as well. Why was Steve like this , why did he treat her son so poorly and how long was this going on. She almost felt like it was her fault, if she told all the things about Tony and explain if Steve could just look out for him maybe what happened here might have never have happened.
The man cackles and proceeds to kick Steve in the chest, he grunts in pain and clutches his chest. “Oh Captain, But I am taking him he’s mine and he’s also Hydras now, we don’t need your blood or that brainless mutt anymore” he said cryptically, this confused Steve what did he mean? what are they going to do to Tony?. This is when the man leans down slightly still holding Tony and whispers to Steve “I believe you know who I am?” Steve’s nods he knows that this man is Daniel “Good so you know I will take very good care of my boy, goodbye Captain” he said in a sinister voice as he gets back up he orders his agent “knock him out as well we’re leaving” “right” the agent  replies and they shoot the dart at Steve. He grunts from the sting of pain but he still tries to crawl towards the Hydra thugs “stop” He rasps but it’s too late they are gone and Steve couldn’t do anything he failed , he failed Tony and that’s the only thing he could think about as he falls into darkness ‘I failed’.
Well you’ll find out soon enough see you next time and I hope you all that a good day 😊
“The neckless you’re wearing a part of my conscious is in there, it’s a strange artifact that Peggy has her family for years I guess her kind use it to help guide others or something” this surprise Tony he never knew that his father knew about his moms abilities.
They were over the root of the mountains, they had passed the first summit through a tunnel; Steve could see several more clouded peaks up front as they zigzagged westward to find the smoothest ascent, so slowly that as the daylight began to fail, Steve felt anxiety starting to scrawl upon his skin like a horde of bugs.
Jarvis, smiling faintly, said, “Anthony.”
Tony gestured at his chest heatedly. “This
bored,” Sam said. “Either he’s lying or he’s the most high-strung bored person I’ve ever seen. It’s Tony, though. His moods chance more often than the seasons. Trust me, Steve. All this will be forgotten in no time.”
“Women in this town just aren’t as cheap as Steve,” Bucky scoffed. “And I refuse to lose to a pint-sized city slicker.”
“Until you retired?” Steve confirmed.
Steve breathed out heavily through his nose. The rage was beginning to fade, but it left the energy thrumming in his muscles nowhere to go. He analyzed the situation. For better or for worse he was stuck on this new Earth. Tony knew this environment and the way to get them home. Tony loved Steve; he wouldn’t betray him. But still…
“I do. Promise, I mean. I’ll always be honest with you Steve. I won’t hide things like Tony used to. I’ll tell you everything. And I’ll. I’ll love you enough for both of us until you can say it back.”
Tony paused to refill his glass. He took a larger sip then was probably advisable to buy time before the next bit.
“You wouldn’t either!”
Tony brought his other hand up and held Steve’s shoulders. The pressure was barely felt through the thick material of the uniform. Tony leaned down to speak into Steve’s ear.
Steve knew even as they dragged him off in chains that this would only be a temporary defeat. He knew his purpose. His destiny was still waiting for him and it would only be a matter of time before he was back on the right track. His supporters, the true believers, would never give up. They would come and free their Supreme Leader and then they would cleanse this world of all that was wrong.
Steve cradled Tony in his arms and rocked him back and forth. Tony had warned him of this, that there might need to be an adjustment period while he got used to having a body again. Or for the first time, depending on how you looked at it. Sensory overload, he had said.
And Tony, well. Stark clearly had nothing to be ashamed of. It would seem his reputation had been well earned. Steve’s eyes followed the sweat glistening on his abs. He’d had no idea Tony was in such good shape. It was especially surprising given his illness and the amount he drank. His muscles bulged as he thrust into Natasha on screen. Natasha’s breathless “ah, ah, ah’s” kept tempo as they danced in the sheets.
Steve couldn’t sleep. Everything Tony had put in his suite in the mansion was elegant, plush, and entirely too modern for Steve to feel completely comfortable. The mattress was too soft, the sheets too slippery. Some warm milk and late night television would hopefully be just the thing to help him fall asleep on the not-quite lumpy couch.
