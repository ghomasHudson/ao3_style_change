“Nope.” Castiel sits up, wincing at the residual stickiness on his midsection. “Dean, do you still have that
“Aren’t I though?” Crowley says giddily. “Your grand plan, your hail Mary, was my
Cas is staring at the garden, unseeing now. It’s like he’s been bottling this story up for so long, and now there’s someone to tell, it all comes pouring out. “It was just a cold, at first. Then I found out she’d been coughing up blood, and her fevers were bad, especially at night. The antibiotics we had didn’t seem to help, she just wasn’t getting better. I tried, I tried so hard to keep her fed and clean and medicated, but she’d cough, and her lips would end up blue.” He gulps and turns his face away from Dean. “She went quietly, in the end. I'm sorry, you probably didn't want to know all that.” He wipes roughly at his eyes again.
Yes, he decided, he enjoyed the feeling of being warm. He’d like to be warm as much as possible while in the human world.
Dean watches him nervously for a few moments, expecting him to nope out again, but his arousal spikes when Cas just watches him move his hand on his cock, his cheeks flushed and mouth slightly open. Dean has no choice but to still his hand, willing down the tight, hot feeling in his core. If Cas is gonna keep looking at him like that, all dark eyes and wild hair, this is gonna be over a lot sooner than Dean would like. He wants Cas, has for a long time, and if he plays this right, he's gonna get him.
Mick continued, “But aye, there is a group who play most times. I think most recently Winchester there actually beat the britches off young Ion. Quite a sum of money, I believe."
His roast is fucking awesome.
“I really gotta love you, if you can use words like ‘theoretical knowledge’ before sex and it somehow turns me on,” Dean says, chuckling as Cas joins in, shaking his head ruefully. “Just follow my lead. I’m takin’ care of you tonight, remember?”
Castiel grins again, then puts his hand on Dean's shoulder and says, "Okay, how about you stay in this line, get me a drink, and I'll go find the pie?"
He shakes his head. He'd come to the library rather than hole up in his office, partially because he was more accessible for his students studying for their finals, but also because he really needs to be around people today. He really has no idea how he's gonna last until Friday—the need to get a hold of Dean and do something, anything, with him is making him anxious, and he keeps catching himself checking his phone to see if Dean has texted him.
"You make it look so easy, Doc," Krissy says from nearby, giving Castiel a cheeky grin when he looks over at her. He smiles, noticing she already has one perfect ice rose tucked behind her ear. Castiel had been overjoyed when Krissy had been among the first to enrol in the Institute. She’s a gifted magician, and has grasped elemental magic faster than he’d ever expected her to. Stanford doesn't know what it's missing.
But the letters…He replaced the book on the shelf and picked up the note he’d dropped, taking in Alfie’s curious expression.
After all, wasn’t that all that his father thought of him, too?
"Night Charlie," Castiel says, kissing her cheek and hugging her tightly. "Happy New Year."
Castiel shifts uncomfortably, not sure if his honest approach is a great idea after all. He still doesn’t trust Crowley one bit. “Well, it’s a book about regulatory measures. I thought a law firm might take an interest in such things.”
The conversation transitions into safer territory after that, and eventually, they each order a cheeseburger and Jo hustles off towards the kitchen.
The sight of Cas kneeling there looking down at his hand on his rock hard cock is almost enough to send Dean right over the edge, but he bites his lip and squeezes his hand slightly.
Dean couldn't say why, but the idea of the merman coming anywhere near town filled him with unease. “I hope not. And it was only one time. Haven’t seen him again.”
“Yes, Sir,” Dean said, inclining his head politely. Bobby had spoken with his no-nonsense voice, and even Dean didn’t mess with that.
“I dunno, he won’t talk to me,” Dean said, shrugging. It stung, especially since Jack had begged for forgiveness for all he’d done without his soul, and Dean had fallen to his knees on the hard kitchen floor and pulled the sobbing kid into his arms.
A geometric shape appears between them, three overlapping squares in wisps of electric blue, and when Dean swipes his hand once more and raises the temperate, it glows red-orange, like fire. It’s the elemental magic operating inside his spell, Dean is sure of it, and the squares shift minutely as his hands begin to twitch.
It was quite likely, Dean realised, that Castiel thought him nothing more than a superfluous dandy, getting by on little but the luck of current fashions favouring his looks, at best. At worst, he probably thought him a wealthy rake. Greedy, lazy, spoiled, no more than a pretty face.
As Ellen crosses the room and throws open the window to let the air clear, Castiel drops to the floor beside Dean and feels the side of Benny's neck for a pulse. "What happened?" he asks shortly, noting that Benny's pulse is weak, but present, his chest rising and falling with breath. More worrying, though, is that Benny's magical aura is barely there.
The room was set up simply—a long, well-appointed room with several card tables placed throughout. Perhaps two dozen people were in attendance, men and women, either playing Whist or just observing.
Mick chuckled, along with Castiel. "All that dancin' wears a man out. Although you were lookin' pretty lively out there with Miss Jessica, eh Sam?"
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel rumbles, and Dean feels it vibrate in his chest, all the way to his toes. Castiel is buzzing with power, practically glowing with the intensity of it.
Castiel laughs softly. “I don’t think he’s forgiven us after last time, do you?” High spots of color appear on Dean’s cheeks—obviously remembering the time a few weeks ago when Castiel had been enthusiastically fucking him in the closet, and the magical shockwave from Dean’s orgasm had burst every bottle of cleaning liquid in the room. It hadn’t been pretty, and they’d been in the middle of a complex spell to clean it all up when the janitor himself had opened the door. Castiel was still unable to look him in the eye. He chuckles, adding, “One more class, then I’m all yours for two whole weeks, honey.”
Cas considers, wondering if he could bring himself to put his life into words. Dean had told them to write about something they know, that they're passionate about. Perhaps he could.
Grinning, Dean took a sip of his punch before asking, “And you? Is the home of our beloved Marchioness of Pittville the ‘fanciest’ you’ve seen?”
Anna chuckles, taking a step closer. “Maybe. Or maybe this is when I cast a fireball and knock you on your ass.”
Just a warning in this chapter for a non-consensual kiss, in the context of a demon deal.
“And how’s the school, Missouri?” Castiel says politely, and Dean switches gears, interested to hear this response.
” grin with Hannah.
“I’m sorry, Cas, but I’m going to have to call it a night,” Dean says, halting Castiel’s runaway thoughts.
Dean nods, giving Cas half a weary grin. "Likewise. Azazel?"
. Not diplomatic enough. "But nothing. It's entertaining."
they haven’t paid?”
Winter solstice? Cas wonders if that will be the next time the gate will open.
Dean clicked his tongue, then reached down to grab Castiel's hand where it rested in his lap and yanked it, dragging him to his feet.
“I wouldn’t involve you if I had another choice,” Anna says, more sharply than she intended. Tension begins to grow between them, silence hanging heavy between their half-empty mugs of tea. “I’ll give you anything else, Castiel. Anything but telling you
“I see you’ve made a friend, Dean. Hello, there. My name’s Doctor Azazel.”
Dean looks up to stare at him, chewing his bacon. He speaks around his mouthful. "You're a witch, Cas. Refusing ain't an option."
“Yeah,” Dean says with a shrug, remembering the rush of power, the addictive quality to it. He’s never felt anything like it, and hopefully, he never will again. “Glad it’s all over, to be honest. Where are we now? If it’s not heaven…?”
When Sam turned at the doorway, Dean added, “Kick it in the ass.”
“A...a
Dean bent his head closer to Castiel as he said, “So, have you seen anything unusual so far?”
“Bring Sam to me, Dean. That’s all I want.” The voice comes again, implacable, unruffled.
As much as Dean wants to know more information about the Seal, to understand how a temporary measure has somehow become permanent—impacting their society in ways that may be irreversible—at the end of the day, he values Castiel more than any knowledge he might gain. As interesting as it is, what could Dean even do if he did learn more? It’s not like the council would listen to some twenty-five-year-old mage with a cocky smile and a give-’em-hell attitude.
One eyebrow raised, the boss stands up from his lean and pauses, hand on the doorknob. “See for yourself,” he says with a cocky half-grin, and opens the door.
“Oh my god, you did, didn’t you? Your bond is probably rock solid now, Dean. He’s feeding on you.”
But the meat—the meat is what he’s here for.
Glancing around, Castiel checks out the other people studying in various nooks in their vicinity. All of them are absorbed in their work, with no one looking their way. They could find an empty meeting room somewhere, but he’s sure they all contain cameras. There are strict rules against fraternization in the library. He doesn’t want to cause a scene.
“Well, my uncle’s building is old, I’m afraid, but you should stop by for tea while you are in town.”
“For your parents?” he asks, quietly whispering, and Dean just nods and closes his eyes. He had almost forgotten he had confided in Cas about his family situation, nearly two months ago. He lets an image of Mary, young and blonde and carefree, and John, older and grimer with time, fill up his vision.
?” Castiel has seen a lot of movies at Dean’s insistence now, but the seasonal ones get a bit hazy.
When Castiel joins Dean in the bedroom, Sam is just waking with a snort. He props himself on his good side to look at them, rubbing at his face with the other hand.
The memory of that afternoon is fresh and bright in his mind. He looks around furtively to make sure he can't be overheard as he describes the scene to Dean.
“Yes, boss.”
“I know, right?” Charlie squeals, exhilaration evident in her voice. She looks down and across the field, scouting out their first stop, but Dean is watching Castiel’s reaction as if it’s the most interesting thing in the world. Cas has an expression of surprise, of delight, broadcasted clearly on his face. Dean notices how happiness softens the man’s features, the sober and serious expression temporarily muted by the presence of joy. Dean’s officially staring, he knows that, but he can’t seem to look away. Castiel meets his eyes after a few seconds and offers him a small smile, as if he’s acknowledging how impressed he is with all this.
They hadn’t seen Anael for some time, as she’d been away on another research trip to England to visit Oxford and study the way lay magicians are taught there. It seems like so long ago, yet only just the other day when they had all stood in this very spot, the foyer filled with family and friends, and cut the ribbon to open the next chapter of their lives.
Castiel comes forward, hands wrapping around his back. “If Crowley wins now, that doesn’t mean he wins forever. We write a spell for him, we give him the power, but then, once the bond with Sam is broken, we gather our strength again and—”
Castiel frowned. He’d probably have more luck talking Dean into giving him the amulet than by whatever method Crowley was insinuating. “And what exactly are you planning to do with this amulet?”
“I'm really sorry, Dean… I also have plans for tomorrow already, in fact.”
Charlie falls into step with Cas, asking quietly, “Is it true, Cas? Will Demonside really be drained of magic?”
As they step outside into the crisp air, Dorothy points a finger upwards and sends up a shower of magical sparks in an electrical discharge. Charlie joins her, firing a string of witch lights that dance around each other, spinning as they rise into the freezing air. The girls walk down into the snow, laughing in delight.
“That’s what all the girls say,” he says, throwing a wink at Cas, who huffs a laugh, annoyed all over again. Girls it is, huh. Guess the attraction is all in his head, after all.
That was fine—Castiel was furious himself. He was shaking with it, his anger like a red hot flame in his chest.
Castiel stood in front of his dresser mirror and lifted the gauze covering his new tattoo, revealing the pink skin beneath. Was it his pilgrim’s tattoos that were so distasteful to Winchester? He'd seemed so flustered upon seeing them. He replaced the gauze and turned so he could see the marks on his back in the mirror. Castiel himself certainly wasn’t so fond of them any longer, not after he’d seen the horrors men were capable of. How could God possibly love a race that visited such depravity on one another?
Castiel glances at him as he prepares the antibiotic syringe. “No, but I have a little first aid training.”
Dean stared after him, only now aware of the rapid-fire beating of his heart. What on Earth had just happened? At least now he knew where he stood with Castiel—the man clearly now hated him for his womanizing ways. Well, let him hate. Dean was a free man—he could do as he pleased.
Castiel shivers suddenly, fisting the cotton of Dean’s shirt with an urgency that makes Dean gasp. The nightmare that woke him up—the one he had forgotten—it can’t be—
“Look,
The demon drew Castiel forth with the mere spread of her fingers, his body jerking across the space between them like a discordant puppet. The toes of his boots trailed through the flaming oil, scrambling desperately for purchase against the floor as his path broke the circle protecting Dean. Castiel gargled, an anguished, airless sound, as her hand formed a fist.
“But what now? What about...Miss Masters? The wedding…?”
Castiel leans in for one more kiss, before turning to lead them back out of the stacks. They sit back at their table, exchanging plenty of shy glances and foot touches as they work.
Dean could do nothing but stare at Gabriel, the words striking him and ringing in his mind like a bell. How could they be talking about the same person? Castiel’s letters had been nothing but polite, and his presentation unfriendly since he’d returned.
Castiel reads the email, frowning at the pushy tone. This is possibly the fourth email he's received from Crowley over the last few weeks, not to mention several phone calls. He hasn't even replied to any of them, only saying to him on the phone that he'd consider it.
Castiel didn’t respond verbally, but his deliberate sidestep away from the wooden post at the end of the bed had them both tumbling onto the mattress. Dean felt himself tip forward, pulled down by Castiel’s hands at his shoulder and his hip, and he let out a quick, grinning laugh as he caught himself, hands on the mattress on either side of Castiel.
He hears rustling, and he imagines she might be adjusting her clothing. There's a tightness behind his sternum, but also a traitorous twitch of interest in his trousers.
But at that exact moment someone clears their throat in the doorway. Dean flicks his gaze over in annoyance, and Sam is standing there, staring at them.
Castiel spots Sam right away—he's hard to miss in a crowd, being head and shoulders taller than anyone else in the place. With him are Charlie and Dorothy, and when Sam looks up to wave them over they all get up and congratulate Dean with hugs and shoulder claps.
"We couldn't have. The energy would have blasted out of it, taking out whatever was in its path, and the shield would never be able to hold all of it back. I hoped it would at least scatter some of it, kind of like light through an opaque window."
Dean snorts, unzipping his graduation gown and abandoning it on the floor. Charlie follows suit, and though they’re both still in formal wear, at least Dean can roll up his sleeves and have more mobility. He’s already fantasizing about the day Crowley’s bond to Sam evaporates and him and Cas can roast the son of bitch like a hunk of barbecue. He’s thankful that Sam is back on his feet, but he’ll never forget how Crowley put his brother in jeopardy for his own gain. As much as Dean wants to advocate for the lay magicians, the last person on the planet he wants to help right now is Crowley.
“How is it that Charlie—Lady Bradbury, rather—holds the title and such a wealth of land and property, then? She had no brothers?”
Dean feels something inside him shudder, like his heart is being ripped from his chest, and then he’s crying for the first time in a long time, his brother’s arm wrapped around him. “I just love him,” Dean cries, knowing soon enough he’ll be embarrassed for blubbering like this. Right now though, it feels amazing to let go. “Sam, I just…I just love him.”
“Hey, it’s okay, this was about you,” Dean says with a soft smile. He knows he’ll be remembering this night for a long time to come, and he hopes Cas will as well.
This case was growing bigger by the day, it seemed, and Dean wasn’t sure how he felt about that.
One of Charlie’s eyebrows arched in sceptical silence.
Dean begins to make an awkward exit when Lisa cuts her eyes between Castiel and Dean, standing shoulder to shoulder, and gives them a little nod. “I’m happy for you,” she tells Dean, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear and giving him a smile. Dean’s mouth gaps, wondering how the hell she could’ve known. Castiel looks just as floored…and, if Dean is being honest, a little worried. If Lisa can tell just by the way they’re
“Castiel! Are you just returning? The concert was wonderful—beautiful singing!”
He stomps upstairs and heads straight for a hot shower, first drying his damp clothes before removing them and leaving them in a heap on his bed.
The shop was quiet, and Castiel allowed the peace of it to seep into him.
Turns out, the super clandestine meeting of the underground resistance is just like…most meetings. The group is pretty small, but there are still committees—Recruitment, Public Service, Petitioning, Tactical Analysis. Each group leader gives an update, some short and some long, but Dean finds each of their updates fascinating in different ways. Hester in recruitment has been hanging around arcades, since that’s where eighteen-year-old lay magicians apparently seem to cluster. Neil runs small workshops for the lay magicians willing to try and hone their magic, though the location is hard to nail down. Anael has been organizing protests outside every mage-owned business, which has gotten volatile lately. That’s where Uriel’s come in, from Tactical Analysis, running protective measures and even performing combative spells when the need arises. The rest of the members help where they can, instructed by the committee heads or the Captain herself.
Dean nods and heads out of the small office, his face grim.
, he thinks, still half asleep, and moans as the magic burns through him once again. The last thing he sees before passing out again is the glow of two eyes close to his face.
Dean sighs as he heads for the elevators. “They might discuss it, sure. But will anything happen? Unlikely.”
He walked out into the hall towards the front door, glancing through the door into the main Tea Room, where Alfie was fastidiously polishing the last of the chairs—his cousin did not look up as Castiel passed. The front door opened quietly onto Well Walk, and Castiel made a mental note to find what had become of the bell that used to jingle as customers entered.
It’s not at all surprising when the coordinates lead her into a graveyard, old and unattended by the looks of it. Her eyes are watering as she searches the gravestones, wanting to spot him before he spots her—but no such luck. She walks down a small dirt path, and when she turns around, there’s Crowley. He’s wearing what she’s come to see as his trademark black suit, a welcome smirk stretched across his face.
“No, let’s just teleport to the same place,” Sam insists.
“It’s nothing,” he murmured, and leaned in to kiss her with a fervor that he had perhaps held back from her until now. They had barely begun, their mouths moving together, Dean’s hand carefully cupping the back of her head so as not to disturb her carefully pinned hair, when someone cleared their throat in the corridor behind them.
They'd waited all morning, with Dean constantly questioning whether he's done the right thing leaving Cas behind on his own.
Dean scoffs with exaggerated volume. “Of course there is. Dean Winchester does not half-ass dates. He…uh, whole-asses them.”
“Uh, hey Dean,” Sam mutters awkwardly. “Hey, Doctor Novak.”
“Oh, shit,” Dean says with exhale. The reality of their situation dawns on him suddenly, and despite all the present danger they’re in, he chuckles. Anna looks at him curiously, Charlie peers up at him like he’s lost his mind, but Dean doesn’t pay either of them attention. He centers in on the energy in the center of his chest, the bond that’s tethering him to Cas’ essence, and asks—
“Yeah, but what about lay magicians? They don’t exactly have access to all these books, y’know? The only way they can learn is by doing,” Dean points out.
He takes his time over at the coffee pot, pouring the brew clumsily into a mug and taking a sip before finally mumbling, “So, uh, Cas and I are together.”
The crunch of gravel beneath the carriage wheels announced Dean and Sam’s arrival at Charlie’s home, Middleton House. The building was huge and very square, made of pale Cotswold sandstone with a large Roman frontage, the columns all done up with flowers and ribbons for Midsummer. They weren’t too late; they would’ve been if Sam hadn’t impatiently marched Dean out of the house when he did, but as it was they were fairly on time, and theirs was the sixth carriage in the line of eight that Dean could see waiting in the turning circle of the driveway. He pulled his head back through the carriage window, careful not to knock off his hat in the process.
Ruby’s voice comes from the doorway, sounding smug. “Enforcers are here.”
The possessed partygoers—who had previously bared their teeth and growled unnaturally—were by then standing or kneeling on the floor, looking around wide eyed, some crying, some holding their heads. But all alive.
Enforcers? They'd been expecting the authorities at some point, but how long had they been unconscious for? His joking comment about being in jail may not have been too far from the truth. He gathers the shreds of his energy and scowls up at the enforcer. "Leave him alone, he's done nothing wrong."
Dean detoured down the side of the Winchester home, heading for the back door. He’d hate to think what his father might think about him bringing in random strangers—he hoped by coming in the back door, he’d avoid meeting either him or Sam. He was relieved to find only Ellen in the kitchen, in the midst of preparing an evening meal.
, which he only has access to through some dubious acquaintance. Last night, Castiel had said the Seal was only meant to be temporary, at least according to the book. But then why is it still active? Why are lay magicians like Benny risking their lives everyday just to taste a fraction of the power hidden away behind the Seal?
"Oh," Anna interrupts, relief now clear in her voice as she steps back. "Is that all? What are a few kisses in the corridors going to do?"
“You’re stressing out about this, aren’t you? You know what you need? You need to get laid. Too much stress in your life—you need to let the frustration out.”
“Don’t you think I know that?” Dean shouts, standing to his feet as well. “That’s the problem, dumbass. We both love each other so much that we keep shit from each other just to keep the other safe, and I don’t—I don’t know—I can’t lose him, okay? I’d rather break up then watch him in danger, or watch him—I can’t—Sam, what if he
He darted away from Gabriel, towards and underneath the boat, threading through the dim beams of light filtering into the water. Gabriel raced after him, but hung back when Castiel angled back up to the surface, some way off to the other side of the boat. Castiel kicked his tail as hard as he could and shot out of the water, diving back down with a slap of his tail. He hoped that had been enough of a splash to attract attention towards the oncoming storm.
Sam moved forward to flick the corner of the sheet back from the victim’s face. Recoiling in distaste at the rotting flesh, he looked up at the elder Winchester again. “Your thoughts?”
When Dean spoke, it was in the softest voice I think I’ve ever heard from him. “Hey, Cas.”
Cas makes him feel a little uncomfortable, and he knows he really oughta come clean soon about his extracurricular activities. He’s kept it secret mostly because he’s not sure how dangerous this crew is, and if he brings Castiel in on something, he wants to make sure it’s a good and worthy group. Plus, he knows for a fact that his boyfriend is keeping something from him, too—that mysterious friend who works in the financial district and owns super obscure magical books—so he’s not hurting Cas by keeping this group to himself. Right?
, and then he was still.
“Whoa, whoa… You went close enough to try cutting it? Have you been eating stonefish? They might have seen you!”
Staring at him.
Hannah withdrew their hand quickly, straightening their shoulders, fins flared. “No.”
And after tonight's lesson, Dean might never see him again. The idea of letting Cas walk out of his life doesn't sit well. He doesn't even realize he's frowning as he packs up his book and pens until a deep voice by his desk makes him look up sharply.
“Good,” Cas smiles one of his small, barely-there smiles that Dean loves. “Maybe later, though. I’ve got a paper due tomorrow.” He kisses Dean gently, then gets up and starts throwing clothes back on.
If he could just talk to Dean, just to explain himself, they might still be able to work things out. He palms the amulet beneath his shirt, Dean's magic making his heart ache. He can still feel the bond—he has no idea what the circumstances would be that would cause it to break, but it seems they aren't there yet.
What the hell is happening? He should be failing right now—the magic winding down with a comical sad trombone sound. Instead, the tight magical charge is increasing in a way that sets Dean's teeth on edge. He steps back, keeping his hands raised to try to grip onto the edges of the summoning spell that he’s sure is dissipating, even though the ambient magic seems to only be rising.
“Don’t start that guys, come on. Jeez, it’s bad enough I have to watch you do it at school, but it’s ten times worse after you’ve had a few drinks!”
“Okay, fine.” He bites his lip, his voice dropping. “Dean, fuck my mouth. Be rough, baby, I want you to. Let me make you feel good, so good. Let me swallow down every drop until I have you screaming.”
Castiel dropped his gaze, closing his eyes to try to collect himself.
When Dean comes to, it takes him a while to work out where he is. A room with a bed…oh, an orchard, a shotgun…Castiel. Their mysterious host is nowhere to be seen, although the tray on which he'd brought the food and tea is now missing from the nightstand.
“I know. Me too.” Castiel rubs a hand on Dean’s back in soothing circle. “Looks like we changed the outcome, whatever it was. Prophetic dreams aren’t set in stone.”
He watches the enforcers head around the corner at the far end of the lane, and exhales. He turns to Sam. "Where would Dean have gone?"
The way Cas says it, very carefully and cautiously—as if he’s admitting something that he doesn’t quite want to discuss yet—makes Dean’s spidey senses tingle. He’s heard about an underground, lay-run resistance to the status quo here at Stanford, it’s well-known gossip. Is it possible that Castiel is mixed up in all that?
The other guy—Dean, he’d said his name was, right?—shifts impatiently. “What’re you waiting for? C’mon, I can help.”
With the greatcoat hanging heavy on his shoulders, Dean turned to face Castiel.
“It seems we are,” Castiel says evenly. “Have you ever…?”
On the day of his thesis presentation, Dean spends a disproportionate amount of time in bed, not sure he’s ready to face the day. Castiel had left early in the morning, passing him a cup of coffee and smothering his face in kisses before heading to campus. “You’re going to do amazing,” he promised, a hand smoothing down Dean’s bedhead. “No one knows more about the Stanford Seal than you do.”
Then there's a hand on his shoulder, and Dean's magic washes over him. He turns to look up at Dean with a smile, only to be blinded by Dean's in return.
“We should definitely do that again sometime,” Meg says, a smile in her voice, “although I’ve got a feeling you’re not going to want to. Clarence, who’s Dean?”
“No, don’t stop,” Dean gasps, his hands finally finding a grip in the coat near Castiel’s hips, and pulling Castiel down onto him. “I’m all for a little morning glory.”
Big Bear Lake and the surrounding snowy hills are just as beautiful in the winter as Charlie had enthusiastically showed him a few weeks ago before they'd booked. They’d arrived two days ago to see the two cabins nestled among trees laden with fluffy white, about a hundred feet from each other. The small living and dining space had been freezing when they’d got inside, but Castiel and Dean had made short work of insulating the walls with a charm that should last for their stay here. The fire has kept the room warm and cozy since, with the insulation spell keeping the heat in well enough that even the bedroom with its four-poster bed is warm.
“What are you…?” Gabriel eyes go from wide to narrow as he sees Castiel, interest piqued, walking towards them. “Ugh, seriously? I hate when you two do that freaky little telepathy talk. It’s like your
“Help me, Castiel,” Meg says, her voice low. She pushed at Dean’s coat now, shoving it off his shoulders and helping him to discard it over the side of the laundry tub nearby. She pulled seductively at his cravat, making short work of loosening the knot and leaving it to hang around his neck, as he carefully kept his hands at his sides. He didn’t want to touch Meg until Cas was fully on board, here—she was his fiancée, after all, and he still wasn’t quite sure what exactly was happening.
Sitting beside Dean in The Tea Room, Charlie was dressed in a new day gown of soft lemon, highlighting her fiery red hair to devastating effect where it was curled and piled atop her head. If she had wanted, Dean mused, he was certain that she’d have no trouble snagging any man that came her way with her looks and title. At least until she opened her mouth…Dean had been privy to her painful attempts at demurely flirting like a lady of her station was supposed to do. He’d attempted to give her pointers, but in the end, he’d settled for merely advising her to try imagining that every man she came across had a beautifully heaving bosom beneath their shirt front.
He can feel the blood warming his face just thinking about the man’s low voice and tall, solid frame…along with the crush of guilt. It’s only been seven months since Amelia left, leaving him to look after their baby daughter, but his attraction to Dr. Winchester had caught him by surprise. He’s thrown himself back into college to keep a bit of normality, and without intending to, developed a bit of a crush on his professor. Whoops.
“So this is the library I’ve heard about.” Campbell didn’t bother keeping his voice down, and the Taylors looked up sharply from their books.
“You guys did it!” Jo says when they’re finally in reaching distance, and then he’s pulled into every kind of hug imaginable—a tight one from Ellen, a light squeeze from Dorothy, a somewhat awkward clap on the back from Bobby. Jo punches him on the arm in typical Jo-fashion, and everyone is congratulating him, asking to see his diploma even though it’s just a fake, empty scroll. He looks at everyone’s faces, happy to see them, but then…
Missouri pauses for a brief second before she says, “In a way.” She glances down at something on her desk—a piece of paper Castiel can’t quite see from where he stands. “Between one of your students and yourself, Castiel.”
“Whyever does it matter?” Christian asked, still grinning. “Do you think I could have charged more?”
Laughing nervously, Castiel replies, “You said you wanted to talk.”
Ellen: But we hope you're all okay, and hope this puts some salve on those wounds.
A delighted shiver went through him as Cas also let out what sounded very much Iike a growl. Cas leaned forwards, placing a kiss on the back of Dean's neck, then another more open-mouthed, teeth on the meat of his shoulder. Dean shuddered again as he felt Cas' tongue sweep across where he'd bitten, moving along to suck at Dean's skin. He worked his way down, sucking and then licking at his skin, sending delightful goose-flesh down his limbs.
The man next to him said, “Oh, you’ll know her. She has bright red hair, usually wears a lace cap and a huge, ugly red pendant. You’re not unmarried at your age though, surely, m’lord?”
Except that today, the sea floor was not stable. It rose in a few spots, spooking the herring so that they darted around nervously. No, it was the ropes moving, Castiel saw, as a clanking groan from the ship above the surface sounded. The ropes pulled the edges of a huge net upwards off the ocean floor, coming up underneath Castiel. With a powerful flick of his tail he powered upwards and away from the ropes to avoid getting caught himself, but the herring weren’t so lucky, caught panicking, roiling against the net as it rose upwards to the surface.
“Indeed, Winchester, welcome,” Charles Shurley said, grinning at Dean like they still stood in Parliament. He leaned in, speaking quietly, “It is rather warm in here, though. Please do come in, find a refreshment before you attempt dancing.”
The vicar brought Dean and Charlie’s hands together, speaking a prayer over them before he had them turn so that he could address the small assembly. From the front row, Stevie gave Dean a warm smile, inclining her head gratefully for a moment. On the groom’s side of the church, Dean flashed his brother a grin—Sam looked a little overcome, his face soft as he looked between Dean, Charlie, and the column that hid Castiel.
Damn that man.
Castiel exchanges worried glances with Dean and Sam, then he thinks towards Dean,
He doesn’t want to be here. He longs to be back on his couch with his comfort Netflix and whiskey bottle. But no, he’s gotta do this. He squares his shoulders, and opens the glass door.
He reaches his office door and throws it open, his jaw dropping as he sees the interior.
“Very, thank you!” She already looked flushed, as though she’d started drinking the punch before the guests even arrived. She turned to Dean, her eyes bright as she looked him up and down. “And Mister Winchester, I presume. Very pleased to make your acquaintance.”

“I understand you wanting to save your friend,” Donna begins with a sad lilt in her voice, “but what makes you think you can do what the professionals couldn’t?”
They need to know who is following them now—Croats, or someone else. And if he’s honest, he’s kind of hoping it is Croats. They’ve got enough problems, and he’s not in a mood to be friendly.
Thick, shaking tears traveled down the side of Dean’s nose. He could feel them, clammy and strangely warm on his skin, and he couldn’t care one bit. “Cas,” he croaked again.
Benny shoved past him, heading aft to where the
Sam protested, saying, "I assure you, they're real," but Dean continued to speak over him, raising his voice.
Castiel didn’t know what to make of any of this. He would never have suspected the St. Mary’s group to turn to such violent measures, but who else could have provoked such an attack? For an attack it clearly was, if Dean had indeed seen someone fleeing the scene. Thank goodness Dean had been there to hear the scuffle and smelled the smoke.
Dorothy reaches out to shake his hand with a smile of her own, then Charlie gestures to Dean. “And this is Dean, Cas’...uh, roomie. Dean, Dorothy.”
The trail of bodies across the floor was starting to grow alarmingly, and Castiel wondered whether those people were still alive, and how he and Dean might be able to aid them. But before he could move forward at all, demon smoke billowed towards where he stood. He shouted, “No!” and slashed at the smoke ineffectually, but as it swirled around him, he felt the skin between his shoulder blades burn, like he’d been branded there. A disembodied voice hissed in his ear, and the smoke released him, instead rushing to someone standing nearby. To…
“Look at me, Dean,” Castiel says, incredibly calm considering the circumstances. “It’s just you and me. You and me and our magic—that’s all we need.”
Dean’s heart aches the moment his eyes flutter open, his eyelashes wet. He swears he can still feel the cold air from inside the cabin, can picture the look on Cas’ face as he turned away and left. Fuck…he’s not even exempt from their bond in his own goddamn subconscious. Existing anywhere sucks right now—even his dreams—because Cas isn’t here.
“Get Cas!” he says, knowing he’s the only one here who’s studied lay magic this closely, the only mage nearby who Dean would trust with his friend’s life. “
Blinking in a manner that could have been offense, Castiel chose to answer simply with, “Ahh. So, it was Mister Singer who decided that we should”—
“Well, not to ask the obvious question, but…have you told her?”
"Hey, did you get a new phone?" Charlie asks.
Dean eyes him. “So you’re suggesting we...what? Sell our services to the highest bidder?”
She follows him down a more secluded route, neither of them speaking, until they’re standing in front of a weathered gravestone.
, pulling in the catches and getting them to market after each trip. The money he’d been putting aside would soon be enough for a second ship, and that meant losing himself in work for a little longer.
“I’m defending Atlantica, your majesty. Castiel’s the one you should be asking—he’s chosen to defend a human over the lives of our entire kingdom! He’s betrayed us!”
“You’re staying, right? Sam’s home. Eileen, too.”
Well, that was debatable. Dean stares at him, struggling to get his thoughts in order. “So you’re telling me,” he says quietly, but with a rising anger in his chest, “that while I was busy trying to not become a warlock,
Dean berated himself mentally.
His gaze lingered there thoughtfully, pondering the notes he’d seen penciled amidst the pages as Charlie gave quiet thanks for the fresh tea and biscuits. There was a delightful intelligence hidden in the notes, Dean could tell; but at least in places, Dean felt that they were rather missing the point of the book.
“What’re you playing at, Ruby?” Rosco growls.
Castiel smiles in a more sympathetic way. "I'm sorry, Dean. I didn't realize pie was so important to you."
"But the headaches," Layla continues, "they're still there. I haven't had any convulsions for a while, but…" she looks down.
Stepping swiftly through the tables and past jovial groups, many of which nodded or beckoned, Dean ducked his head and gave an apologetic smile to the world at large as he took his leave, going after Castiel, or at least trying. He took his eyes off the man for one moment, and suddenly his beige overcoat he’d quickly donned was gone from sight.
(See the end of the chapter for
With a splash, the boat was overturned, and suddenly Castiel felt like he was back in the Sea Witch’s lair, cold saltwater in his mouth and lungs. His limbs were heavy, awkward, and he couldn’t locate the surface, let alone control his flailing arms and legs.
A society of lay magicians, here in Palo Alto. A
Castiel looks down at his palm to see a number scrawled across it—Anna’s phone number, he assumes. It’s spelled into his skin, looping over and over as the numbers draw themselves. He smiles.
thing to do, he reasons. He slips his boxers off and takes himself in hand, eyes cracking closed just long enough to put himself back inside the dream—lying on a bed, Cas’ tongue swirling around the head of his dick, his hair tousled and crazed. Fuck, it had just felt…so real, so insanely good, so right. It’s like he can feel the soft imprint of Cas’ hands all over him, can still feel the warmth of his body, hazy as a memory. That’s crazy, pure freaking lunacy, but as he strokes and pants, finally spilling all over his hand and crying out Castiel’s name, Dean knows what he feels.
And now… And now, he trudged back towards the house, his boots pinching his damp feet. He hoped they wouldn't be ruined by the lake water—he had intended to dry off in the sun before getting dressed again. For Dean to come upon him in that manner was not only embarrassing—the look on Dean's face had shocked Castiel to his core.
The boss sighs, swirling the liquid around in his glass. “I just want what you want, Castiel. A society where all magically gifted people are given equal opportunities for learning to use their skills. Surely that’s not too radical an idea?”
When he’d finally managed to get Riot to back off, he noticed the shadow of someone standing over him. Peering up into the corona of light around the person, he drew in a sharp breath.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel blinked, and Dean would have sworn a flush began to build at his cheeks. “I—thank you, Dean. That, uh, that means a lot to hear,” he confessed.
When he steps towards the office door, he realizes the other end of the line is silent for a few moments, and Dean isn't sure if he's overstepped. He's still officially Cas' teacher for a few weeks—Cas had seemed honestly touched that Dean had asked him out last week, but perhaps inviting himself over was just a step too far.
Dean scoffs for a moment, looking straight ahead at the sky. “I have. That’s the scary part. Even though everything is still up in the air, life has never been this good for me. And that’s because of you.” He turns to look back at Cas, his expression open. “Which is why I want you to be fulfilled, too. You wanna teach? Go teach.”
He speaks up, saying tightly, "I'd like to hear Sam's take on it."
Dean and Castiel were still supposed to be socializing with Anna and her flock, so this was a welcome consolation after having to leave the party so early. They walked along the gravel path, gloved hands nearly brushing as their arms swung close. Castiel felt Dean’s presence like a steady heat at his side, as though he were a flower drawn to turn his face towards Dean’s light. He ached to be able to reach out and take Dean’s hand, but instead, snatched it away when they accidentally brushed again.
“Mister Winchester! Apologies,” Castiel said, flushing prettily. “I wasn’t watching where I was going.”
“No!” As Castiel watched on in despair, she moved up to the next shelf, methodically destroying all of his carefully collected artifacts until there was nothing remaining but the most hardy metal objects and broken shards of everything else.
magic works. It’s less about science and more about…”
“Damn. Very well. Next time, perhaps.”
“But…the masks? This thing is freaking annoying.” He pulls the mask back from his skin to let a bit of air in.
The music began and they watched as the dancers moved apart slightly, allowing Lady Donn and her partner to step their spritely way through the steps of the reel that had been chosen. Castiel eyed her as she danced, wondering if she could possibly be the one responsible for the demon invasion. She was eccentric, to be sure, and the odd necklace around her throat was among the most ugly he’d ever seen, but was she capable of such magic as would be needed to summon demons? Why would she do such a thing? The idea was preposterous.
Dean’s sure his face must be bright red, the way it feels so warm. He looks down, avoiding the demon’s dark gaze. “You carried me in here like a little kid?” He glances up to see Castiel frowning as he nods. “Well, thanks, I guess.”
When Castiel huffs a tiny laugh, she gasps, then adds, "Castiel, you didn't. On campus?"
book—when it spoke about the Seal, there was a list of names of the team involved in the research and design. One of the names was Henry Winchester.”
Dean cranes his neck to see Castiel behind him. The first thing Dean notices are his rosy cheeks—they’re red and windburned. He’s shivering in his trench coat. It’s a few weeks early for snow, but the temperatures are plummeting fast. Cas places a cup of coffee from the Witch’s Brew in front of Dean, steam rising through the plastic lid.
“Wanted you for so long, Cas,” Dean breathed against his neck, his words muffled by his refusal to fully remove his lips from Castiel’s skin.
By the end of the lesson he's worked himself into such a nervous mess that he can't even face the thought of speaking to Cas. He quickly wishes Benny a goodnight and hoofs it, taking refuge in the comforting rumble of the Impala as he takes the long way home, cursing himself for being an idiot.
He looks up. Dr. Winchester is standing in front of him again. Cas eyes widen, and he begins to stand up. “I’m so sorry, I’ll take her out of here—”
Sam replaced his teacup on the breakfast tray, leaning over towards Dean until Dean had no choice but to raise his eyes to Sam’s concerned gaze. “If you would rather stay home tonight, we do not have to go to Lord Shurley’s ball.”
“Why is this sounding so much like a goodbye?” Dean says, his voice sounding rough in the night air.
“Monsieur Winchester!” came Balthazar’s heavily accented voice, approaching their carriage immediately. “And Lord Milton, of course, of course,” he greeted them both with a bow. “I shouldn’t be surprised to find you arriving together as always,
He checked around the garden and down the allée for other guests of Lady Donn, but sighed with relief when he found himself alone save for a gardener clipping away at a hedge some distance away. It was bad enough that he'd made such an embarrassment of himself in front of his friend, but for any other gentlefolk to see him in this state, while an honored guest, was unthinkable.
Dean calls out, “No!”
"Keep goin', sir?" Dean drawls, not really sure what he's saying anymore but willing to use sass to get what he wants.
stop Crowley in one fell swoop. Regulating Stanford’s magic in a fairer way is the only way to move forward. She’ll have to devise her own plan to achieve that, which starts with asking her new recruit, Dean, what he discovered behind Stanford’s closed doors.
Bobby stands there, waiting. “John,” Bobby says by way of greeting.
“Uh, Cas? I’m not sure that’s a great idea…” Dean begins, but then Castiel takes a step too far. The mother dragon hisses at him, then moves forward toward Castiel at a run, opening her mouth to fry him to a crisp. Castiel throws up his hands, but then, nothing happens.
“Nothing,” Castiel says, giving him a small smile. He’s clasping the amulet between his fingers, and Dean thinks about how it had glowed just moments ago. All these weird things that happened—floating in mid-air, feeling ripples of energy…it has something to do with him and Cas. Is their bond growing stronger?
He only gets a few steps away, though, before he hears Cas say, “Dean?”
“One sec,” he tells Castiel, though he half-expects the professor to float away and leave, he doesn’t. But Dean is focused on Sam now, who’s slurring his words. Apparently he met “that chick from the water fountain” at a party and they’re both super wasted. Dean curses into the receiver, gets their street address, tells his brother to stay put. He’s only twenty, and Dean isn’t gonna risk Sammy getting arrested for public intoxication.
Dean is the first one to speak, and he’s hushed as though he doesn’t want anyone to overhear. “So you think the Seal is in the middle of this maze?”
Amelia spoke up, interrupting him. "I must bring him with me to Grandport.”
“You—” Dean blinked slowly. “Now? You’re sending me out with him now, on a case? Before we’ve even spoken?”
“No, nothing’s happened. I mean, we might have been close. But the magic, the bond, it’s...incredible. It’s like my whole body lights up when we’re close, like I’m about to—”
“Yeah, the kid’s turning twenty-one in a couple weeks, and the world’s his oyster, y’know? He’s all about books and learning—wants to go study in the city. Dad won’t hear a word of it, of course. But Sam’s heart’s just not in the family business.”
“On Christmas morning?” Castiel asks, as if that’s absurd, which…it definitely is. “Oh, actually, my neighbor said she might drop off a fruitcake.”
Dean nods, but then as Castiel turns back to the woman’s body, Dean says, “Wait. You sure you want to touch these?”
Dean lifts his head and Castiel takes the opportunity to kiss him gently. "I know it's early, but just give her a chance, okay?"
Frowning, Dean wondered why the Runners had chosen to send one of their own, this time—would it not be easier to have the Night Watch attend, as this whole case (a serial killer, Bow Street had it recorded, of course, so as not to unduly shock the populace) was in the hands of the Men of Letters? All they needed was someone to help get the body back to—
Castiel stood back, glancing slightly mistrustfully at the fireplace, but Dean had many years by then to be used to his brother's witchcraft. It had saved his life more than once, and even Bobby approved—of certain uses of it, at least. Like this: long distance communication that otherwise would take hours and a fast horse at best.
“There we go,” Dean chuckles.
“No, no,” Dean shook his head and gestured to the back door. “Mrs Harvelle wants you out of the laundry, and I want to tell you of my adventures in Cheltenham the other day—the parts I wouldn’t say over dinner.”
book had said their affinity would strengthen the more they cast together, and today, it felt like Castiel had a hook in his chest pulling him back towards the campus, made ten times worse when he'd come through the wards to California.
“We’re not really at liberty to discuss the project,” Castiel interrupts. He’s fairly sure Dean’s family is trustworthy if Dean trusts them, but all it takes is one of them to repeat what they hear and the secret would no longer be a secret. “Sorry, Dean,” he adds. “One of our restrictions, I’m afraid.”
“I am indeed,” Castiel replied, nodding a half-bow once again. “Castiel Novak, at your service.”
Castiel clears his throat, blushing. “I apologize, Dean. Bobby sent me upstairs to check on you. Benny mentioned you were in the bathroom, not that you were in the shower.”
Even though Dean's heart was hammering double time already, he could almost feel it splinter at Benny's words. This was his father's pride and joy, the place of Dean’s and Sam's childhood. “No,” he shouted, holding the wheel firmly. “We can still—”
Cas shows him to the bar where he agreed to meet Charlie, and is nearly bowled over by the small redhead as they enter the building.
“And you think
Her eyes light up, but she sighs again. "Okay."
“None of this is fucking easy,” Dean huffs, hands in fists at his side. “Either we make Crowley the goddamn king of magic, or we try and stand up to him—”
Sam shook his head. “It’s only temporary, until I can save enough for school, and for somewhere to stay in Grandport.”
Castiel’s hands pause. “Unless you want to wait until we get home?”
with an unhappy grunt. Castiel chuckles mischievously, but his breathing is still laborious, and Dean can hear the sweet slick sound of Cas fisting his cock.  “If it makes you feel better, I’m close too. So close. Everything is always better with you, Dean.”
But can he?
“You two purposefully ruined that relationship,” Anna says heatedly.
Now, after the anger of the previous night had left him, he realized he still wasn’t sure why Amelia was after the amulet at all. She’d said she planned to bring the amulet back to Crowley herself, which meant that Castiel himself was in danger—and even after throwing himself into the ocean, he found that he had no particular wish to give up his soul to Crowley without a fight.
Castiel is already shaking his head. “I refuse to work at—”
“This pretty face has enough magic to send you straight to hell,” she says evenly.
Dean blinks awake to warm, drowsy sunshine. His vision is blurry, his body heavy with sleep, and that’s probably why it takes him a full ten seconds to realize he has no clue where he is or how he left the library.
"No, staying would have only made things worse. Cas is better off with us far away and you know that."
Instead, his bag swings down to his feet, all his responsibilities momentarily forgotten, and he gathers Castiel into his arms and kisses him.
Nodding, Christian dipped his head and turned to head that way, not bothering to look back at Dean. The conversation was clearly nothing to him, rolling off his shoulders with ease as he strode through the crowd of party attendees, throwing out a greeting here or there, smiling as if he’d already forgotten.
Dean caught up to him, taking in his pale face, and the exhausted look in his eyes. “Safe from what? I can take care of myself, Cas.”
Dean doesn’t trust himself to speak this time, so he nods and thinks,
Cas takes a breath, pausing for a few moments with that adorable crease between his brows. “I thought you were picking something up on the way?”
“Fergus?” she calls, shrill and self-assured. “Stop that right now. You’re going to get someone killed.”
“I dunno, Cas, isn’t shower sex kind of complicated?”
“Hey, Dean,” he says, a soft smile lighting up his face despite the obvious pain he’s in standing like this.
Dean looks back over his shoulder before his hand meets the fridge door, not sure if he just heard the growled word correctly. The demon looks annoyed as he continues staring towards the other end of Dean’s living room, but when Dean stops to look at him, he turns his black eyes on Dean, peering at him with a smouldering intensity that takes Dean’s breath away. The guy really is unbelievably hot, even while he’s still standing there wrapped only in a coat.
"A small piece?" she asks, her eyes narrowed as she places the folded tablecloth on the table. "Well, it happens I have a few samples I had saved for Mister Moseley, but I suppose I could always cut a few more slices…"
Mick snorted. “That does not surprise me. I’d be shocked if Ion Tapping had ever looked at a book in his life after he was done with his schooling. No, he prefers the company of drink and horses to sipping tea, I’m sure.”
All the random girls he’s met this morning fly immediately out of his brain, ‘cause yeah, there’s a casual greek god on-campus and he happens to be Dean’s new thesis advisor.
“Do you teach your freshman students your interpretation of magical theory?” Castiel asks, sounding bemused and curious and a little concerned, but Dean shakes his head.
“I was just, uh…” Dean trails off, pointing back over his shoulder, but before he can explain, Charlie calls for their attention. The orcs are on the march.
“Charlie tells me so,” Dean responded, graciously not mentioning whatever that had been. “I’d challenge anyone to befriend that woman and not somehow end up feeling better about themselves. She’s been working on me since we were five years old, so at least in some respects, I’m remarkably self-assured.”
He’s been at it since soon after dawn. Despite sleeping like a rock beside Sam through most of the night, Sam had woken him up in the early hours flailing around, burning up with fever again. He’d found the dregs of the tea Cas had made for him last night still in its pot on the sink, so he boiled some more water in the kettle and refilled the pot, adding some cold water so it wasn’t too hot to drink. At least Sam had been semi-coherent this time, so getting him to swallow it wasn’t too much of a task. Dean had lain on the couch afterwards, unable to get back to sleep, and ended up getting up anyway when the grey light of day started to filter in.
“Alright then.” Dean eyed the horizon thoughtfully. “A wager on who can reach the lane behind Well Walk the fastest?”
In the middle of the floor there was a pile of burning material—Dean didn’t waste time looking, but knew immediately that they’d be Castiel’s precious books. Dean’s attention was immediately pulled away from the flames, though, by movement on the other side of them.
He runs his hand down Castiel's arm, linking their fingers together when he reaches Castiel’s hand.
Dean looks up sharply. Is he saying…?
Pulling the blankets up under his chin, he closed his eyes again to try to stop the thumping in his head.
"Hey, Cas. All set?"
“Gabriel said something funny? I must’ve missed it,” he says dryly.
Cas draws Dean inside and closes the door behind them. Dean supposes it’s unlikely Sam will come looking for them, but it effectively shuts out the outside world, and also means that Cas can step forward with his hand on Dean’s chest, pushing him back against the door to kiss him with intent.
“The lady I do not know,” he said, trying to keep his manner light, but his heart beat double-time as they drew closer to the group.
Anael shrugs, leading them down another alleyway. “The Captain seems to think it might be beneficial to our cause.”
“Hm? Oh, the book.” Dean’s hand fell onto the volume, and Castiel’s focus was drawn to the strong fingers as they ran over the embossed cover. “Only in the sense that my father’s estate has plentiful game birds at this time of year. Do you shoot?”
resourceful, but only because he had to be scrappy as hell to survive a childhood with John Winchester. But it’s Castiel saying these things, it’s Castiel beaming back at him, so Dean mumbles softly, “I love you.”
Castiel cursed Crowley once again for not gifting him the human’s language as Dean looked him up and down slowly, then said a few words before pushing off the wall and walking to another door across the hall.
“I think you’ve persuaded me of that, Dean,” Cas murmured, pressing a kiss to Dean’s cheek.
“Nope. You were wearing a hoodie and these insanely tight jeans.” Dean tightens his hand around Cas’ hip, dipping his hand lower, past his back, until he’s groping his ass with a firm squeeze. “Such a tease.”
“So, say this was our last night on earth,” Dean says into Cas’ ear, trying to keep his voice light. Inside, though, he’s wondering if that just might be the case. “Is there anything that you…uh, want, that we’ve never…?”
Castiel laughed again, as Dean sprang forward into a surprisingly quick dash around the corner into Well Walk.
“Becky Rosen,” Dean said quickly, fumbling with the buttons on his tailcoat, trying to remove it as swiftly as Phillip had somehow put it on.
Cas huffs out a laugh, rubbing his own face, maybe brushing away a tear? Dean feels all warm that he’s affected Cas in such a way. The guy is so lonely, the gratitude for such a simple act is almost rolling off him in waves.
After sweeping all the broken plates and glass from the floor, Cas and Dean sit at the table with coffee. Dean yawns as he wonders where his moose of a brother is. No point waking the poor guy up, they’ve all had a busy few days.
He reaches for the first one on the pile—
“The Samhain? You night you got into a fist fight?”
? Oh good, he was glad his brother was with Benny already, but now Benny was pointing to the foredeck hold. With a sudden dropping of his stomach, Dean realized what Benny was saying:
Sam let out an ungentlemanly snort of laughter, his hand flying up to cover his mouth. His eyes darted about to check they were still mostly alone, and he turned to lower his empty plate to the dessert table. “Go on and have some fun then; one of us should.”
“Mister Winchester,” Harry called over the hubbub, grinning over the table. “Are our hands so poor we can’t hold your attention?”
Why, oh why, did everyone suddenly want to know about bloody San Sebastián? Castiel frowned. “Yes, I was there during the second siege. It was...an unpleasant affair I do not enjoy recalling.” He clenched his fist beside his thigh, trying to calm the shaking that had begun.
“Thanks,” Dean says, smiling softly. He really needs the caffeine jolt—research is so
“Oh?” Dean asked. “What is that, our amended marriage articles?”
It had been, single-handedly and without question, the most terrifying experience of Dean’s life.
“You like?” they asked, striking a little pose, then continued without waiting for him to comment. “It’s nothing, really. Just trying it out.”
Dean chuckles into his boyfriend’s clavicle. “Dude, understatement of the fucking century.” He props himself up on his elbow, knowing he needs to pull his softening dick out and clean them up, but he has to ask a question first. “Was it good for you?”
“Rosco,” she calls.
He didn’t recognize her—she was pretty, he supposed, but in a plain brown work dress and with her hair pulled back she resembled any other lady in the market about their business. He narrowed his eyes, and when she noticed him looking, he saw her glance at Cas for a moment. Following her gaze, he turned to Cas, but he was still poring over some shiny stone or other.
Castiel turns to look at Anna, still slumped on the floor, broken and silent. He hopes she’s all right—wishes he could go to her. But Crowley stands nearby.
Castiel sighs, running a hand through his hair and shaking out the excess moisture. “Would you like some tea?”
Their eyes remained locked across the dancefloor, drifting and passing close, and Dean couldn’t do a thing to stop it.
"Oh yeah, unlike freaking Sam and Ruby," Dean says, shaking his head.
“Yes. And I know why he’s here. What he wants.” Dean shakes his head sadly. “I’m so sorry, Cas, I really thought we’d lost him this time.”
He pumps harder, trailing the fingers of the other hand under his balls, across the tight ring of his ass. What would it be like to have someone…inside him? Or…or...for him, to fill someone else, to pound into a tight hole, to—
“Come on, Cas, give it to me. I want that big cock of yours inside of me…” he rambled, and Castiel groaned, shifting on the bed to climb up over Dean. He dropped his face to lick a rough tongue over Dean’s chest, over his left nipple and up over the hair to nip at his collarbone. Dean couldn’t wait any longer, sinking his hand into Castiel’s hair and dragging him up to crush their mouths together. “I need you,” he panted again, against Castiel’s mouth.
It's the well. It has to be—the magic is blasting out from it like the sun. The light is coming from a ring of brightly glowing runes and symbols around the edge of a wide, dark hole. Everything else around them is pitch dark, just...empty.
Dean gets back to shoveling earth over the ashes in the grave. “Yeah, it’s a lot nicer now there aren’t dead Croats lyin' around.”
Castiel turns down two wrong alleys before he finally feels the edges of the concealment spell, like a tickle along the edge of his consciousness. He waves his hand over the wall, testing the depth of the spell before he pushes it away. He's not sure, but he thinks he's getting better at feeling the shape of existing spells. Dean had showed him just last week, when he'd helped Cas to find and fix one of their insulation spells in the cabin that was letting a cool draught in through a window.
"I was there, yes," Castiel said and rose, intent on removing himself from the situation. This was not something he was prepared to discuss.
Azazel. The pyre, Sam’s immunity, Dean… He must have fallen asleep at some point during the night after all. Some watchman he makes. He closes his eyes, not willing to face any of it yet, and sighs as Dean runs his fingers across his hair. When was the last time he woke up beside someone? He and Anna had huddled together to sleep now and then when things got difficult, but before that, not since the day he left Bartholomew in Illinois.
“Dunno why you’re both struggling,” he smirks, as they both cast him matching glares. “It’s all about focus.”
“What?” Dean said, disbelieving. “We fit in the investigative stuff where we can, but this is where we’re
He begins casting, trying to focus on the shift of magic as it flows through the air. His right hand is in a tight fist, his left palm flat, and he collides them together carefully. He feels the heat already gathering, and he begins stacking his fingers together, holding the spell in a steady pause while Castiel catches up. The professor is doing some of the most elaborate hand motions Dean’s ever seen, crossing his fingers in an unusual spread, and most of them Dean would swear aren’t in any textbook. Sensing that it’s time to resume his own spell, he forms a scooping motion with his hands and begins to move them back and forth, back and forth, raising the temperature of the room one degree with every turn. It’s easy to warm just one body up, but he’s trying to heat the whole room, and so he doubles down on his efforts. Environmental spells are known to be tricky, but he eventually feels damp and sweaty, though it’s not clear if it’s the exertion of the spell or the rising heat of the room. Castiel keeps casting with expert precision, and it’s distracting how confident and sure his long and slender fingers are. Dean is growing impatient though, not understanding what exactly is supposed to be happening, and he’s two seconds away from dropping his spell when—
“No I’m not,” he argues, though by the tone alone, it’s obvious he’s uncertain.
“What? Why?” Dean asks, looking up in surprise.
Castiel sighed, not sure he agreed. He admired Dean’s optimism, but if he brought the library back to the Tea Room, wouldn’t those who opposed it keep trying to ruin him?
The demon’s eyes are predatory as he stands up before Dean, panting slightly, then before Dean’s eyes, he visibly pulls himself together, straightening his shoulders. He lifts his hand to linger on the side of Dean’s neck for a moment as he draws a deep breath. “Come,” he says, and sweeps out of the bathroom.
he’d enthused. Castiel had bit his tongue at that comment—he’d never thought much of Dean’s father, based on the stories he and Sam had told. In any case, this was the first time he’d got a good look at Dean like this in a few weeks. The jacket showed off the work Dean had been doing in the school gym, and... Charlie was waving a hand in front of his eyes. He blinked and turned to look into her incredulous face.
It soared and tumbled, and Dean was already grinning before it landed, predicting its path.
“Uh, so…” He scratches the back of his neck, his stomach twisted in knots. Cas tilts his head, waiting patiently. “If you…if you want to forget any of that happened, I get it.”
Castiel sat, as instructed, wondering what Dean was going to bring him to drink. The taste and smell of human food was taking some getting used to, but he was enjoying the new flavors and sensations in his mouth.
Dean nodded, not sure if social niceties still applied when one came upon one’s peers engaged in...this. He tried, anyway. “My apologies. I heard a noise and came to investigate.”
“They’ve been known to escape the longer you wait,” Charlie says, taking a large bite herself.
Castiel lifts his hand, bringing it towards Dean’s face, and Dean closes his eyes, knowing that this is it, he’s about to get pushed against the counter and kissed within an inch of his life. But then Cas’ fingertips barely brush his cheek, and he doesn’t feel lips against his… He opens his eyes cautiously.
Castiel 8:13 AM <<
In the middle of their hug, the door swings open and Sam shuts it behind him, chuckling at the scene of Charlie’s arms wrapped around Dean, greasy spatula still in his hand.
like that. His own magic was humming now, responding to the lingering energy he’s just consumed.
He brandishes the tiny sword again, stepping back towards Dean, emphasising each word with a stab towards him. "What. Are. You. Talking. About?"
“Why not? You find this form attractive, do you not?” the demon growls, taking a step towards him as he backs across the room.
“Sam told me you’d been there all night. We’ve got a case to work tomorrow, Dean.”
“I’m okay. Just finishing up before I head home. What time is it there? Midnight?” He frowns at his watch, thinking he’ll have to create a spell to make timezone calculations for him.
“Yes, Mister Winchester,” the valet responded, bowing to them both in turn. “And Lord Milton, of course.”
Castiel’s blood suddenly ran a little cooler. Surely she didn’t mean... "No, Dean would never—"
“We weren’t really trying,” he lies, “we just wanted to show you the hand motions. Now, you all try.”
Dean feels frozen in place, jaw wound tight, still eyeing Castiel and Sam with a stunned sort of fury. But the Captain is right—they need to get this meeting over with, so Dean can drag his traitorous brother and boyfriend into the back alley and ask them what the hell is going on. He stuffs his hands in his pocket, finally breaking icy eye contact with Cas long enough to walk around the edge of the table. Anael sits beside Hester and Dean sits on her other side, at the end of the table and across from Ruby. He really can’t tell who he’s madder at right now, but he knows deep within his bones that he absolutely loathes Ruby. He balls his hands into fists, staring straight ahead at the wall.
“Hey you,” Dean mumbles, rubbing Castiel’s arms and adjusting the zipper of his hoodie to keep him warm. “Been missing you. Or, uh, your face I guess.”
He replies with the grimacing emoji, then adds, "See you soon. Good luck."
“Yeah, I just wasn’t sure how things were going to be after…well, after this morning.”
Castiel wakes to discordant singing from somewhere outside his room. He squints at the light coming through the crack in his door, and it takes him a few moments to connect the noise with the empty side of the bed. He turns his gaze to his nightstand and picks up his phone to check the time. What the fuck is Dean doing up before seven?
Dean makes a sympathetic noise. “I'm sorry,” he says, not sure if he should ask more. He takes another drink to give Cas time.
Cas nods. "And the Croats who injured Sam?"
“Here,” Dean called, getting to his feet and dusting the fibres off his shirt. He glared at Sam. "We’re done here," he said gruffly, and as he turned to enter the main part of the shop, he took a deep breath to try to calm his racing heart.
She straightens up, her sadness turning into an indignant pout. "Nothin'."
“See you tomorrow for breakfast?” Sam asks them, kissing the crown of Jess’ head as she leans into his touch.
“Sorry, Baby,” Dean said soothingly. “Don’t want you trampling any of the locals, now do we?”
Dean has just taken a mouthful when Claire says this, and he coughs so hard as he swallows that he’s sure the milk nearly snorts out of his nose. She’d asked him a few times about a play date, but he’d gently dismissed the idea, since he didn’t know Jack’s dad at all.
Dean just hmphs again. Truth is, he does miss that sarcastic bastard. But what he did, giving his life to seal that rift? It still hurts. So he buries it again, and focuses on the sigils once more.
A few days later, Dean wakes up before his alarm. He’s just had a nightmare, one he can’t seem to remember. There’s no sunlight filtering in through the window, which either means it’s ungodly early, or it’s another stormy day in Palo Alto. Maybe both.
He sighs, trying to clear his head. His oven is charmed to carefully expel dishes as soon as the timer ends, luckily, so he’s not worried about checking on them again. At least for a while. When he finally heads downstairs, Bobby has pushed aside the glass showcases, as usual, and Sam is setting the long table with cutlery.
hangs on the edge of Dean’s lips, but he can’t make himself say the words. Crowley deserves it, that much is obvious. He’s a ruthless, murderous psycho scrambling for power—but is that enough to make him a monster worth killing? What gives Dean or Cas the right to make that kind of decision?
“But the spell you usually use—it’s not working?” Ellen asks, fear in her voice. The nurse shakes her head.
He never listens to the tape anymore these days. The truck he drives now has a CD player, and the battered old tape player he’d picked up at an op shop needs new batteries.
Striding across the dancefloor to join them, now clad in dark jeans and some kind of tan jacket that suits him perfectly, is Castiel. He stops a few feet from Dean, the disco lights playing over the small smile on his face as he looks Dean over, down, then up. “Hello, Dean,” he says, and Dean’s knees nearly buckle under him.
“Everything okay in here?” Dean asks, eyeing the ball of water in Castiel's hand.
“A brandy for myself and my colleague here, if you please,” he said to the barman, who looked first Winchester, and then Castiel, up and down with one eyebrow raised before turning to fetch their drinks. Winchester leaned on the bar while he waited, his eyes landing finally on Castiel. “How are you doing there, Milton?” he asked quietly. “You’ve had a considerable first day, have you not?”
Castiel watches him with a warm feeling in his chest, until Charlie clears her throat.
the same? Was Dean also keeping something from him?
They spend the next half hour or so chatting about life in England, Meg’s research work and the shenanigans of students in both countries. Castiel enjoys the distraction, and he idly rolls a ball of conjured water around and between his fingers, but when he says goodnight to Meg and hangs up, the longing in his chest is back to distracting. He glances at the screen of his phone and his heart swells to see several message notifications from Dean.
He can’t share any of these thoughts with Dr. Novak, though, so he blurts out, “Not that I’m okay with that. I mean, creating new spells is dangerous stuff. Reckless, y’know?”
Dean steels himself. Guess it’s time to meet Jack’s dad. Dean has to admit, he’s pretty curious to meet this guy—the probably stuck-up know-it-all, who had nevertheless taught his kid how to be a caring friend.
“More gentleman than ladies,” Castiel echoed, blinking. “Do you mean…”
Castiel nodded, uncomfortable with the confirmation of what Bobby had told him months ago, when he’d been inducted into the organization. There was no getting away—but he’d at least wait until this case was solved before asking Singer to reassign him away from Dean. He’d have to live with the pieces of his broken heart until then.
He has a point, but Dean wants to explain that he’s clearly on the
“Just pull the water energy in, and visualise the shape of the petals you want to create, like this, okay?” She pulls water into large petals in front of her, while the students look on in confusion.
“Shuddup, Cas, you were invited,” Dean says, voice soft, and Charlie and Sam repeat similar sentiments. Castiel seems to ease into his chair after that, and the conversation steers away from Dean and Cas’ new relationship, all of them fretting over finals in various ways. (Castiel, Charlie, and Dean, grading; Sam, studying.) Later, as a form of payback, Dean brings up Dorothy. Immediately Charlie’s cheeks are flushed—either from the champagne or the news of her new girlfriend, Dean’s not sure which. Cleanup is a breeze thanks to the spelled, self-washing sink, and Dean is stacking up his freshly washed coffee cups when Castiel clears his throat.
“If the fates are kind,” Castiel murmurs, then he pushes Dean away. “Go!” he says, turning to where the sounds of shouting are getting closer.
Kidding. There's an epilogue left, OF COURSE. We couldn't leave Dean or Cas without showing a flash of the future we're envisioning for them. So hang tight, grab your popcorn/tissues/blankets, and get ready to say goodbye to these guys right alongside us.
“Schedule the meeting,” she says dismissively, throwing the hood of her rain jacket over her head. She doesn’t wait for his reply. She steps back into the thunderous rain, walking two blocks before she feels strong enough to teleport back to Palo Alto.
Castiel turns back to the book. “No, there are other signs. Are you able to tell when I’m nearby? I don’t know, Dean, the further away I am from you, it’s like I’m being pulled towards you, just here.” He puts his closed fist on his chest, watching Dean’s look of surprise. “The fact that we made it snow in California—”
As soon as Dean saw the stiffening of Castiel’s shoulders, he knew. He didn’t even need to wait to observe his uncomfortably swift exit from the circle of discussion close by; Dean knew it was coming. Why must people be so damnably obsessed with the war? Were there not enough horrors in daily life as it was? He inclined his head summarily to the group of ladies that Lady Shurley—Anna, she insisted, though Dean felt he didn’t know enough of her for that—held court with, their fans a-fluttering.
Castiel seems to flush under the praise, stepping towards the center of the room. “Only if you’ll join me, Professor Winchester,” he mutters humbly, eyes on Dean, and the butterflies in his stomach return.
Dean snorted. “You worry too much. It’s just a roof.”
His eyes widen as he sees the text is from Dean.
Castiel hesitated before taking it. “Doesn’t it belong to the kingdom?”
Dean nods, deep in concentration. He moves his palms together and apart to cast the manifestation again, alone, and another column of wispy light appears inside the warding.
“Cas, please. If you lost your grace, if you were human again, that’d be fine. But you’d be out there, and vulnerable. We need you to stay here and be safe. For Jack, especially. He loves you, and I…”  he trailed off,
The footsteps stop, and a voice rings out that makes Dean’s blood run cold. “Come out, come out, wherever you are!” The man’s voice is thin and high, young, even. As soon as he comes into view Dean knows he’s a Croat—the red eyes give him away—but he’s just a teenager. If he’s still talking, that means he’s only recently turned, and a fresh wave of hatred comes over him at Azazel’s fucked up chase. How long would this need to go on for? How many people would he murder, just to find him and Sam?
“The gentleman is Castiel Shurley, son of Lord Charles Shurley. He’s been away for some time, studying in Paris, I believe.” Of course he knew exactly where Castiel had been all this time. His letters had been few and far between in the last few years, but he’d also received infrequent updates from Castiel’s brother, Gabriel.
“Did you have any project in mind?” he asks, trying to coax Dean to join him in the conversation.
, but perhaps they can give him some news about the outside world he's been craving.
Rosen was determined that this was the place to be for midsummer, so I kept my objections to the locale to myself. Some of the gentlemen, you see—not the best of them of course, but some of the families from Cheapside and such—they are not able to travel so far for several weeks in the summer, it just will not do, when they are in trade.”
“Well, no,” Dean began, “but there must be some other—”
As they nurse glasses, Castiel tries to stop himself from staring at the
“I’m not certain, though I’m of half a mind to go back and take another look.”
,” Dean says.
“No clue,” Dean says, chuckling a little. “I knew that family was important to me. That I wanted to make things better for people who couldn’t defend themselves. And I knew I wanted…well, I didn’t want an apple pie life or anything, but I did want to find my person. To love someone the way I love you.”
The lightness in Castiel’s chest at those words might have floated him right up out of the ocean and into the sky beyond.
, Charlie!" Dean replies between gritted teeth.
Dean nods, ducking his head down. “Know whatcha mean.”
“Jesus Christ,” he whines, exhaling more and more desperately. “Don’t stop, Cas, fuck, feels so good…” It takes only a handful more before his back arches and he borderline whines, eventually coming all over Cas’ hand with ropes of thick come.
: Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre (1749-1822), French mage and astronomer. A member of the French Academy of Sciences, he was responsible for an expedition to measure the meridian arc between Dunkirk and Barcelona to determine the value of the new measuring standard, the metre. During his astronomical studies, he developed theories and ideas in spherical trigonometry and designed the spherical construct used in elemental spells today.
“It’ll do. Listen, Azazel’s a slippery fucker. Let me do the talking, okay? He might try to get in your ear, but don’t listen to him. He’s a liar and a psycho.”
Bobby saves him the trouble. “Welcome to the coven. I hope Dean knows what he’s doing.” He turns as Dean scoffs. “Come on,” he continues. “The others ain’t here yet but I don’t think they’ll be far off.”
As he crosses the boundary the rain thankfully lets up, but a cold wind still blows, chilling his damp clothes.
On his knees before the hearth, rooting in the weapons bag, Dean looked up and forced a grin toward the frozen flames. “Sammy,” he said, glad to speak to his brother no matter the circumstance.
“Of course we are, Cas. No matter what happens, no matter what they do, we’ll always have each other. I’ll always hold you in my heart, do you understand? No doubts.”
“No,” Castiel says quickly, then feels his face warming with his embarrassment. “I mean, you're not intruding. You're welcome to join me.”
Castiel held up his hands. "If the idea of spending the evening with me is so repulsive to you, perhaps we don't both need to go." He winced at the shocked look that passed over Winchester's face. He hadn't meant the words to have quite so much of a sting.
be the one to give you away,” Charlie teased.
“Incredible,” Dean sighs, arms shaking. It feels like sparks of electricity are shooting up his spine, itching a scratch that feels impossibly satisfying. “Fuck, Cas, you better stop or…”
“Listen you—”
Stepping back a little to rejoin the circle, she said, “Tell me, though, you must have seen many horrors in your time at war. Were you not at Salamanca, where my poor husband met his end, long after the battle there?”
Ellen stands up to gather plates once everyone’s finished, and Dean runs upstairs to bring down his perfectly-cooled pies, making several trips. He’s made so many different varieties that Castiel ends up with about seven or eight slices on his plate. Everyone makes sure to properly convey their enjoyment of the pies after each bite, but even so, Castiel can only take one bite of each before he declares himself fit to burst and has to stop. Dean seems to be watching him carefully for his reaction to each pie, which Castiel finds a little intense, but endearing.
“He sleeps with his students,” Castiel reveals, his voice faint now. Dean shuffles closer to him, under the guise of not hearing him fully, but when their boots brush against each other he’s overwhelmed by a rush of adrenaline.
“The Boss is doing good things for the community now,” Rosco pipes up eagerly. “He has a group of kids he helps.”
He has to fail at summoning a demon.
But Castiel didn’t have time for reunions. “Stop, stop. We need to raise the alarm, the Sea Witch is coming!”
Castiel turns quickly to Anna before she gets any ideas and teleports away.
Castiel nods. “Thank you, Dean.”
Hoping he’d stoked the kitchen fire enough to burn through the night, he dropped the hood over it and took a lit candle up the stairs to his apartment, hoping the kitchen fire had at least sent its heat upwards to warm his rooms. But when he opened his bedroom door, still shivering uncontrollably, the air still felt ice-cold.
Saileen and Destiel, bunker fluff.
Dean scrunches up his eyebrows in confusion, but agrees, wondering what sort of situation he’s about to find himself in. In-sync casting requires their eyes be locked together, watching for slight shifts in each other’s facial expressions as they ready their separate spells, and Dean wants to look away but he can’t. Castiel’s eyes are such a gorgeous shade of blue, his tongue wetting the dry surface of his lips, and it’s entirely too intimate for someone recovering from a stupid crush. But there’s no feasible way to excuse himself, no exit strategy that doesn’t make him look flaky as hell, so Dean just stares back and fights back a shiver.
Amelia’s story didn’t even make sense in the first place. Why would she be here looking for Cas, if he really had been trying to avoid payment? Why on Earth would he go with her?
“Come, let us see if we can sneak away again?” The lady’s eyes were sparkling with mischief, but Dean found himself reluctant to follow her lead tonight.
Blessedly, upon the wrecked chalk of the dancefloor, even Miss Becky stirred.
Interesting.
called him in yet, but closing the door at this point would only draw more attention to himself. He’s frozen, not quite sure what to do, when Dr. Novak’s stunning blue eyes finally flicker in his direction. Dean can’t read his expression, but he looks slightly irritated at Dean, and he whispers frantically into the phone, “I have to go,” before ending the call abruptly. He slides his cell face-down onto his desk, crossing his forearms and looking pointedly at Dean. His button-up shirt is wrinkled, cuffs rolled to the elbow, and his hair looks tousled and messy…as if he’s spent the last hour wringing his hands through it. It’s so close to the wrecked appearance Castiel had in his daydream yesterday, that Dean flushes in embarrassment and has to look away.
“What are you wearing?” Dean uses his huskiest voice, hand stroking his upper thigh.
Castiel returned his smile, saying, “I wonder if you recognize this amulet.”
“Ow! Get off, jerk!” Sam says, muffled underneath Dean's arm, but he pats Dean’s shoulder before Dean straightens up and gets back to his feet. “Did you really expect me to stay put down there when you were heading back into this?”
"That's basically what a lot of my research has been about. Lay magic can be used for beautiful and useful things—it's much safer for healing, for example. But it can be so dangerous for untrained casters if they draw too much."
“So…you're an incubus, huh?” Dean says, then curses internally at the dumb opening. “I’ll admit, I was hoping to come home without a demon at all, so I’m not exactly sure what I’m supposed to do with you when you're not, uh…helping me with magic.”
“Shut up, jerk. You gonna keep watch? Azazel could sneak up in the dark.”
Alfie turned his flushed face towards Castiel, his eyes wide. “Oh no, sir, I would never presume to—”
Dean has a pang of guilt settling in his stomach at that comment, so he just nods grimly. He glances at his watch, wondering if it’s time to go meet Cas, when he sees—
Sam gave a grim sort of nod. “I’ll try.”
“What’s it called again?”
“Of course,” Dean said lightly. “Mister Novak and his scandalous Reading Room aren’t giving you any trouble, I hope?”
Dean gulps, getting to his feet. Cas isn’t wearing the trenchcoat anymore, and the sight is flatlining Dean’s brain. The bowtie at Cas’ throat is blue, and the black tuxedo fits him in a way his old navy suit just…doesn’t. It’s tighter at the shoulders and the waist, and as Dean’s eyes travel upwards he has to force himself to shut his gaping mouth.
The number of his belongings that wound up here, scattered amongst Castiel’s things, was really none of anyone’s business, he figured. But, Castiel was determined that they be as careful as they could; so the most obvious indications of their relationship were tucked away out of sight, and they never arrived at the dining hall together. They were subtle, Dean liked to think.
Charlie was quiet for a moment, before she turned to him with a grimace. “Castiel, may I speak freely?”
“Oh, come on,” she goads, emphasizing each word and flashing him a broad smile. “He’s barely said more than three words to me. Though, that’s all gonna change today. Because you, my idiot best friend, are in desperate need of a wing woman.”
“It was perfect,” Dean reassured him. Turning the lock behind them with one fumbling hand, Dean gripped Castiel’s hips beneath his handsome new tailcoat before he added, “
He stood at the head of the table, managing to get the ladies' attention. “What can I get for you today? I have some fresh queen cakes—”
By this time Sam is panting a little from climbing even a small hill. “I...I think I’ll have to sit down for a little while,” he says, and Cas directs him to a bench seat at the front porch, looking out over the vegetable garden.
“Pays to be the youngest,” Castiel says cheekily, grinning over his wine glass. Gabriel kicks him under the table and Anna laughs, wondering if she’ll have to forcibly separate her brothers by the end of the evening. The three of them haven’t been together like this since she was…seventeen? Eighteen? She was still living with her parents at the time, but that was short-lived after she received her rejection letter from Stanford. Even with all the time that’s passed, spending time together like this feels warm and familiar. Feels like home.
"You are all gifted mages—do not be afraid of what you do not understand! I…" The illusion glitches slightly as Castiel loses his grip on the elemental part of the spell. Crap, he’s forgotten part of the lay connection. His vision blurs—this is too close to the edge. "Councillors Abbadon and Barthamus are having an affair!" The voice booms. Castiel tries to step back in horror, but he's lost control of the spell now. It seems to be taking more from his mind than he wants to offer. "Balthazar slept with five students this year…" The voice cuts out as the exhaustion hits him hard and he falls to the stage with a crash.
This time Cas snorts slightly and opens one eye, peering up at Dean. He’s looking out over the valley, something wistful in his expression.
He smiles as he watches her run down the hill to the crossing attendant, her bag bouncing on her back. He can't wait until he's able to spend more time with her. Ever since Claire came to live with him, he's felt pulled in two directions, between her and keeping the café running. The complex finances involved with hiring staff have been all that’s holding him back from getting some more help around here so that he and Charlie don't have to break their backs every day.
In the morning, though, Dean wakes up alone in Cas’ bed. He heads downstairs to make coffee, but doesn’t find Cas until he goes outside.
Charlie grinned. “Condolences. She does seem to be very pretty, and very...interested?”
Castiel huffs out a laugh. “Is that so? Well, you earned it, I guess.” He smiles.
Hence, the two students, currently pinned against the wall by their wrists. The shorter girl has her back to the stone, her hands held to the wall next to her ears by strong, glowing elemental bonds. As Castiel eyes the taller guy, he realizes these are the two students he’d caught making out in the Mechanikos foyer earlier in the week. The guy’s wrists are in front of him as he stands on the left side of the door, but he’s looking over his shoulder at Castiel, flushed with embarrassment as he peers through his long hair.
“Cas!” he hissed, whisper-shouting through the gap.
Crowley snapped his fingers again, and Dean recoiled as something flew at his face. When he reached up, something spongy and wet was over his mouth and nose, and he struggled to breathe, but he still watched in horror as dark tentacles sprouted from Crowley’s waist until he resembled an octopus from the waist down. Crowley pulled on thin air, and Dean was dragged forward onto his knees and across the sand until he pitched, face-first, into the water.
Castiel got to his feet, crossing himself as he glanced up at the crucifix hanging behind the church’s pulpit. He tugged at his cravat, trying to let a little air at his neck—St. Mary’s was crowded this morning with the influx of seasonal visitors to their country homes, and the stone building held in summer heat like a potter’s kiln, even this early in the day.
Dean looks up from the book of warding spells he’s been trying not to fall asleep on for the last half hour. “Huh?”
Castiel turns quickly back to Dean. “Now’s our chance. While he’s busy.”
Mick sighed. His Irish accent was lilting; Castiel had always found him pleasant to speak with for that reason. “My lady wife’s mother has taken ill, and her sister lives here in town. Somehow I was convinced to bring them both to stay and take the spa waters. An entire load of codswallop if you ask me, but Castiel,” he paused, leaning in slightly, “no-one’s askin’ me.”
They share a smile as they separate again, then Dean says with a cheeky look, "Let's go before I drag you inside."
Suddenly the collar of Dean’s flannel is feeling entirely too warm. He’s never really been called out like this before, even his brother uses jokes and jabs to make criticisms a little easier to swallow, and he’s not sure if he respects this guy or wants to punch him.
“Those are things you might want soon,” Charlie offers, looking at Cas and nodding in a conspiratorial way.
Dean huffed out a sigh before he continued. “Look, all I’m asking is that you eat your fucking lunch. After that I’m gonna go try and find some work, so that I can get us another boat and you can get your money for fucking college. That okay with you?”
The growling, hissing,
Castiel asked a polite question about the estate, and Dean took a moment to take in the room. There were many familiar faces, both from Balthazar’s club and Dean’s own personal or business acquaintances. Nothing, yet, was raising any red flags.
"You think there's something to that?"
“Hannah! Come on, I’ve gotta get through a whole year of working with the guy!” Castiel says, mock serious but ending with a grin.
Butterflies…motherfucking butterflies are fluttering around in Dean’s stomach. He’s used to Cas being a lot of things—smart, kind, bossy—but outwardly flirty? He’s never made a call so quickly in his damn life.
Dean nods sympathetically, but knows without a doubt that
“Sure, kiddo. I’ll wrap up an extra one.”
“I heard the soldiers sacked and burned the town afterwards. Must have been some loot to be had, eh?” Colonel Ketch’s face was twisted into an ugly sneer, and Castiel knew, had Ketch been there, he would have been one of those riotous infantrymen, drinking and killing their way across the town, grabbing women roughly as they screamed…
Castiel tilts his head, his smile bright, eyes filled with something that looks pure and sweet and hopeful. “Thank you for putting that into words, Dean. It’s exactly what I was trying to say.”
The younger lady lingered as Castiel watched them hurry off along the lane, stepping closer to him for only a moment. “I’m sorry for your loss,” she said lowly, before hurrying to catch up to the other two ladies. The two of them had their heads close together, chattering quietly.
“Good,” Castiel murmurs, cuddling into his side again, going back to stroking his fingertips across Dean’s skin.
Sam curses under his breath. "A fire? You don't think…?"
Naomi reached behind her, into a satchel hanging from her shoulder. What she brought out made Castiel flare every fin—Triton's conch lay in her hand.
Dean snorted indelicately and adjusted his coat, running his white-gloved hands down the fabric and preening slightly.
The thought hits him, and he grins. Standing up and already gathering lay magic to him, he heads into his bathroom to begin casting.
Cas had high spots of color on his cheeks and was currently looking away over the terraced houses of town, towards the ocean, now barely visible in the twilight. When Dean followed his gaze, he saw lightning dancing along gathering clouds out there.
Dean’s mind is buzzing, stuffed so full of apprehension he can’t find room for anything else. It can’t be a coincidence, can it, the two of them sharing yet another dream? But this one didn’t unfold like they usually do—it didn’t feature a sexy rendezvous, for one thing. It felt grim and real and terrifying, and Dean’s blinded by the overwhelming fear that it was prophetic in some way. If the dream is right, someone they love just might die today.
A small smile played around Bobby's mouth for just a moment, before he said gruffly, “Don't thank me yet, boy. There's a lot to do.”
He waited a full ten minutes more, before he heard the soft knock at his door.
Now, laying amongst Castiel’s fine duck down pillows, the weight of a warm, heavy quilt covering him to his chest, Dean had plenty of time to admire the spacious attic apartments. The walls were deep red above polished oak paneling, and the dark wood of the floor was dotted with rugs woven with similar shades. Most of the furniture was heavy, fine oak that matched the room exceedingly well—Dean was fairly sure Michael had ordered it made to fit, as he was almost certain that Castiel wouldn’t have cared much about the color of the carved scrollwork on the secretary desk under the window. The room was very pleasant, though, to Dean’s mind.
Castiel’s eyes widened, taking in Dean sitting beside him, before his shoulders slumped and fell. He looked defeated, turning his eyes down to the stones at their feet. “I suppose it was foolish to think that I could hide the extent of my weakness from you for much longer,” he confessed to the toes of his boots.
Of course, Dean wanted to see Castiel healthy again, more than anything. But he couldn’t lie to himself; selfishly, he wanted Castiel well so that they could be together as much as possible, away from the town on Castiel’s days off and hours after closing, hidden from prying eyes when Dean could slip away from his father and Sam.
“Hell, yes!” Dean says, swooping in to plant a kiss on Castiel’s cheek, then takes his beer to the table.
Sam is still asleep when Dean and Castiel let themselves into the annexe. Castiel quickly crosses to the kitchenette to fill a glass with water, rinsing the taste of sick from his mouth.
And in the centre of it all, Dean Winchester stood, surrounded by both men and women, the life of the party as it seemed. He threw back his head in laughter at something the man beside him had said.
“What…the hell just happened,” Charlie says, eyes wide, staring at them like her mind is on the verge of collapsing.
“The chancel lamp…the eternal flame,” Castiel explained quietly. “It’s a tradition that Catholics share with Jews. We—they, uh, always have a light, near the altar. An eternal flame. It’s a lamp of oil, by most teachings.”
"I'll get your drink," Dean says, standing up and heading for the door. "Sam, better start from the top."
He stares down at the paper for a few moments, trying to refocus on the topic for this set of grading, but none of the words are making sense. His magic is rising, buzzing with Dean's proximity.
“Dean, could you help me cast the manifesting spell?” Castiel asks, making Dean look at him in surprise.
"Pleased to meet you, Doctor Novak," Inias says, stepping towards Castiel with his hand outstretched. As Castiel shakes it, the rush of Inias' magic flows over his hand with a pleasant, warm tingle.
“Relax. He’ll be fine. See, he can breathe.”
Castiel frowns and steps closer, his hands falling to Dean’s waist naturally. “Like what?”
“Exactly…‘okay’ is not what I’d expect from someone specializing in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in Spell Deconstruction.” Castiel plants both feet back on the floor, leaning closer to Dean. “The mechanics of magic are—methodical. Precise. Infinitely complicated.”
Castiel grits his teeth and holds tight to the spell. “Just do it—I don’t know how long I can hold it for!”
The blaze in the kitchen hearth was burning dangerously low, since he had not stoked it earlier as he ought to. He did so now, his hands shaking as he added an oak log to the fire, managing to prop one end on the fire-dog so it would not smother the existing flame. It took some effort to pump the bellows to get the fire burning brighter, and by the time he was done, he was covered with a sheen of sweat, despite the prickly shivering in his limbs, and his head ached abominably. Certainly a chill, then.
Dean didn’t miss a beat, but he was immediately wary. “Why on Earth would that be?”
“That was not on purpose, I swear,” Castiel whispers, sounding desperate. “We don’t keep in touch very well, and I wanted to tell him in person. That’s all.”
Castiel saw the first person possessed, watching with a sick fascination as the demon smoke poured through the shattered window and descended on a man nearby—Castiel couldn’t see who it was behind the man’s mask as he convulsed for a moment. Partygoers around him backed away, their faces aghast, but when he became still and turned to survey the ballroom, his eyes completely black, one of the ladies screamed, shattering the frozen horror of the onlookers.
The next class takes place on the night of an unseasonably early cold snap. The evening is cold and crisp, and Dean's sure the wind is blowing straight through his heavy coat as he walks the short distance between his car and the college building.
Castiel's own chest tightened at the thought of causing his best friend pain, the man he loved. For he certainly did love him—was
Outside the campus is enjoying a rare, partially sunny day, though the air is still chilly and the wind strong and gusting. Dean walks down the hill, waving at classmates and professors and students as he passes, wondering if there’s anyone on this campus he hasn’t met by now. By the time he reaches the outer doors of the library he’s running late, though he figures Castiel will excuse him this time, since he changed the location last minute. And if not? Well, who cares. Dean sure doesn’t.
Frowning, Dean spooned his ice cream onto his tongue, barely tasting it.
“It was a terrible circumstance,” Castiel interrupts mildly, trying to diffuse the situation. “But perhaps we should all focus on the task at hand?”
“What? You said that to Uncle Sam when you were talking on the phone to him!" she replies indignantly.
Then Dean’s eyes drop back to Castiel’s and his eyes widen even further. He asks, “Cas?” and reaches out one hand to hover near his forearm.
Castiel swiftly inclined his head in a bow. “Just speaking with my landlord.”
Cas puts the board book back into Claire’s little hands, wondering how he had ever thought this was going to be a good idea. She lifts one hand to her face again, rubbing at her cheek. And of course, she starts to cry.
“I believe so,” Anna replies, nodding. “I just wanted to make sure you were prepared.”
"No." Layla's interruption doesn't just take Castiel and Anna by surprise—others in the room stop their chatter and turn to look at her.
Ellen paused in her forceful kneading for a few moments, then started again. “Young Sam seems quite taken with his new lady friend,” she said lightly.
He turns to Cas, the horror presumably showing on his face for Cas to look so worried. “I haven’t told you everything about how we got here from Kansas.”
“Someone had to be sent, so I volunteered. I only want to restore the balance in magic, that’s all.”
Castiel dryly noted as much also, as he stood beside Dean, gazing down at the oh-so-familiar display of the woman stretched out awkwardly on the dockside in front of them.
He is so totally fucked.
“We’re back here?” Castiel asks in dismay as Dean walks along the edge of the space, keeping away from the tree in the center.
“Don’t ‘Charlie’ me—I did cheat you out of a dowry, so it seems only fair you got a gift of value. Though I know full well you won’t be keeping that for yourself.”
Balthazar picks up a bottle of wine and pours himself a generous glass, followed by a second without even asking Castiel. “What’ve you got here, Cassie?” he asks, eyeing off the plate Castiel has just placed on the table, next to a flat platter of butterfly cakes with fluttering wings, and a large tureen of soup that bubbles away, despite not being anywhere near a heat source. Castiel can sense the spell low inside the pot, though—he wonders if it's a new one of Ree Drummond’s. The Pioneer Woman is a genius, even if she must know someone on the inside at the Council to get her spells sanctioned so quickly.
This time, the left path dips downwards a little and widens, while the right hand fork narrows considerably. “Should we take the wider path, do you think?”
Missouri agrees, her eyes still wide with wonder.
Castiel stares at him. He swallows the mouthful of candy, his mind already sharpening at the taste of the sugar. “You just saw this spell for the first time, and you managed to analyze the structure, find a problem with it and fix it, in the space of a few minutes?” Castiel beams at him, wondering how he ever underestimated Dean—he’s clearly a gifted mage. “Dean, that’s brilliant. Please don’t apologize.”
Sam wrinkles his nose at the filthy state of the coveralls Dean is wearing. “I’m okay, feeling a lot better. Good job out here. It almost looks back to normal.”
Dean had no idea which way was up. It had been dark under the ocean, and despite the fact that he could somehow breathe, the idea that he’d been dragged down here by an octopus-man to meet a scary-looking mermaid with a sharp spear was almost more than his mind was willing to handle. Seeing and recognizing the
As the carriage crawled forward, Castiel adjusted his waistcoat for perhaps the hundredth time and wondered if it might have been faster to walk from Great Queen Street.
Slipping his tongue into Castiel’s mouth, he realizes that—now that he’s had a taste, there’s no way Dean is ever gonna get enough of this.
Castiel nods. "Keep your head down for a few days, okay?" He steps back and teleports himself back to Palo Alto, to the hallway outside the door of his apartment.
“I see,” Castiel replied.
There are deep slices all over the man's arms and legs. There's also a deeper wound somewhere under his shirt, hence all the blood. He breathes in short gasps, looking around the room with panicked eyes.
“I’m sure. Not sure I could sleep right now, anyway.”
Had he been the one to break Cas’ heart, at the river? He hoped he was reading Gabriel's insinuations correctly, because it would be dreadfully embarrassing to have got this wrong, but the more he sat with the revelation, the more an idea crept up on him. He had always loved Castiel. As a friend first, a brother, even. And then, something more.
Exhaustion pulled at the edges of his mind as he worked out how to work the switch on the light stick beside his bed, but he found it almost impossible to relax. It was all so different from the sleeping nest he shared with his siblings in Atlantica, so far away from here. The air above the water was so still inside this structure, no ebb and flow of currents or sounds of the oceans. Instead, some creature made sounds outside the window, and a person spoke loudly in another house nearby. He could faintly hear the ocean beating against the shore from here, and he tried to take comfort in that as he fell into an uneasy doze.
“Yeah, yeah. I just wanted to tell you that I’m in SF for a week or so. Thought I’d come see you for Christmas.”
“You’re watching that without me?” I asked. “It’s my favorite!”
It’s closer to nine o’clock by the time Dean is sitting behind the wheel of the Impala, fingertips thrumming as he idles, waiting for Cas to come down. He’s fighting the urge to park and go knock on his front door, but that would make this less of a casual friend day and more of a romantic excursion, and he’s trying his damndest not to ruin things by rushing them. He’s half-convinced that Cas is more affectionate with him now because of their affinity, so all those hand-holds and elbow brushes and small gasps of contact can be easily explained away. Their shared magic is powerful, there’s no denying that. But there are other times that Dean wonders if it’s more than that, if his crush isn’t quite so unrequited—like when Cas stares at him with something that looks like longing, or when he texts Dean cute little things throughout the day. If Castiel were anyone else, Dean would’ve made a move by now…but this isn’t just anyone. This is someone who matters to him, and the thought of being rejected by Cas makes him feel like an anchor has been dropped inside his stomach.
Cas hears a short scream, and a woman—the one from inside, hurries away, adjusting her clothing as she ducks back through the back door, scowling at Cas on her way past.
After what seems like a long, uncomfortable minute, Castiel can’t bear it any longer. “Look, I’m not really sure what I’m doing here. Dean said you might have answers for me, so if you could just tell me what last night was all about, I’ll leave you guys to it.”
“It’s just a scratch,” Cas replies stubbornly, waving him off. “Besides—when did you learn a healing spell? They only teach medical magic at the PhD level.”
When Ellen comes back in, the small kitchen really starts becoming crowded, so when Dean glances at Castiel and motions that they should get out, he gladly follows.
and a sickening crack, Castiel was forced back against the wall on the other side of the alleyway, his head smacking back against the bricks with a sound that made Dean’s jaw clench.
“What is this?” Naomi hissed, her fins practically vibrating with her fury. “These things are human-made."
“Good,” Castiel murmurs, shaking his own hands as though they’re full of excess energy. “That was just a warmup. Now try something else a little more complicated. I’m going to cast too, and we have to start together. No matter what happens, don’t stop your spell, okay?”
He glances back towards Cas, who catches his eye and raises his eyebrows in a “you done?” kind of a way. Dean nods back to him, smiling despite himself, as he nods his head towards where the car is parked on the opposite side of the parking lot.
“Cool.” Sam gives him an appreciating smile. “Thanks, Dean.”
“Thinking of my face, were you?” Dean asked with a smirk.
“What an excellent moral compass,” Crowley says, oily and sardonic. “Well, come along. I need to show you something.”
He'll have to put his Dean-related freak out on hold until later tonight when he can work it out, maybe in the shower. Instead, he lets his curiosity get the better of him, and hits
Recognition dawns inside Dean’s brain, putting two and two together for the first time. He had no clue Jess, aka Jessica Moore, was the daughter of Professor Moore, a quiet middle-aged man who had been missing for months. Her dad only taught a class or two since his position as administrative head of security kept him preoccupied. His disappearance had been hot gossip all semester, but President MacLeod had assured them she was working tirelessly to assist the police in their search. If Dean had known Jess had been dealing with the absence of her father on top of her heavy coursework, he would’ve…helped her somehow. Been a better and more involved teacher. But the professor has been located now, and his return home is all that matters.
Inias shuffles nervously. “Novak and Winchester have a high affinity—so high that they’ve formed a profound bond. It’s very rare, only a handful of powerful—”
“That’s what I thought too. But the you I saw in the mirror had on your usual getup—the suit and trenchcoat. But you weren’t wearing that at the festival.”
“To what?” Castiel asked, his eyes on the wall ahead of him, tugging his cravat clear of his clothes with swift, practiced movements.
“You are fucking smitten,” he says, stating the obvious as he gloats. She crosses her arms and sighs, looking like her thoughts are somewhere else. “So what’s the problem?”
Dean shifts his grip under the corpse’s shoulders. “But you said the bees were what kept the farm going! I should have led them away from here.”
Why the hell is he talking to a cat? He wonders if this is how crazy cat ladies are born—one day a cat adopts you, then you start losing your mind.
He closes his eyes against the empty park, turning back to leave. He drinks from the bottle again, willing himself to get the fuck over it as he stashes the bottle back inside his bag and heads for the waiting Uber.
Cas follows Dean into Betty’s Rock ‘n’ Roll Diner, allowing the door to swing shut behind him with a cheerful jingling. The place is bright and busy, with cheerful music barely audible over the chatter.
Dean nods, placing the book on the desk. "I saw they'd approved it."
Against his own better judgement, Dean’s eyes skimmed across Castiel’s rather fine frame. “Have you been inked before, Castiel?” he asked. He doubted it—Castiel seemed like good money and fine breeding, and hardly the type of man to be found around docks or prisons. But the conversation was already awkward, so Dean grabbed whatever straws he could.
Dean swallows, his throat dry. “Then we’ll leave. I’ll pack up, take a happy pill and board a ridiculously long flight so we can make your dreams come true, okay?”
Dean smiled and nodded a greeting to Charlie’s lady’s maid, Stevie, before moving on into the ballroom. No doubt he would see Charlie later, when her duties as a hostess were less onerous.
(See the end of the chapter for
Within, Castiel lay in the bed, the quilt pulled up to his chest. He was still a little pale and drawn-looking, but his eyes were clear as they tracked Dean’s entrance.
platonic, but still.
Dean turns his head. “What’s funny?”
Castiel wonders who she’s picked for her “team,” but it’s probably best he doesn’t know before Thursday. More secrets, more risks. He desperately wishes it could all be over already, but whatever is coming will come, and all he can hope to do is protect Dean and himself from whatever the outcome might be.
Lady Bradbury smiled a knowing sort of smile as she nodded to Castiel.
Dean shrugs one shoulder. “You obviously got on okay without me there the last couple of days, or would have if I’d actually had a working phone, anyway.” He grimaces. “I found a little cash in my stuff yesterday, so I can find a motel, I guess. Or I’ll go back to Bobby’s, although when I was there yesterday his spare room was full o’ books and crap, but I can crash on his couch.” He shovels a mouthful of pie into his mouth.
“Your friend from the other night? I don’t know, I didn’t see the guy. He was still asleep when I left this morning.”
"Wait," Sam says, pointing a little to the left. "I can see the van—there, on the drive, up near where it disappears under the trees near the gate."
Charlie accepts the new beer from Dean, taking a long swallow before she says anything. “I’m in.”
Sam hooked his arm under Dean's shoulders and hoisted him up to his feet. “The ocean, huh? Let's get you home and let Pam have a look at you, okay? You can worry about your merman later.”
Cas doesn’t turn around as Dean walks across the grass towards him. He doesn’t even turn to look at him as he stands nearby, keeping a distance between them this time.
(Details for content warning) To skip, read up to where Dean and Cas are in a rowboat, surrounded by fireflies. They're tipped out of the boat into the river. The water's only shallow, but Cas still panicks after his recent experience in the sea.
There’s only a link inside and Dean clicks it. It takes him to one of those oversaturated, trendy news sites, and the title of the listicle is “10 Signs You Have No Idea What the Hell to Write for Your Graduate Thesis.” Dean snorts and inserts the iconic gif of Judge Judy giving someone an absurd eye-roll into his reply. But before he hits send he hesitates for a moment, wondering if he’s being too casual with Castiel, if he’s about to get reprimanded for being cavalier. But Castiel is the one who sent him the article, right? He’s the one who saw it and thought of Dean.
Castiel huffs a short laugh. “No, no. It’s not the teachers. You remember I told you about the thesis student I got assigned?”
Castiel didn’t look away, either.
Castiel’s forehead crinkles with worry. “It is quite concerning. It seems there are some roguish characters trying to get the university’s attention.”
, is…
Benny chuckles again. “We might not have no
Castiel nursed his cup, not sure how he felt about this information. Sometimes he believed he saw a softer, gentle side to Dean, especially when he was with Charlie. Then he would hear about the hunting, or the womanising, or the cards, and Dean was once again a foolish dandy.
He raises his hands, willing the demonic energy to rise from the amulet he wears around his neck. “Demon, I have invoked you. Do you agree to be bound to me?”
Castiel sighed. He’d mentioned the rent increase to Alfie, but hadn’t told him how dire the situation was, hoping he’d be able to perform some kind of miracle before this day arrived. “Mister Campbell has come to collect our rent. He…he wants tea.” He added the last dish of blackberry jam to the tray and left a worried Alfie to it, fighting down his own worry.
“Hello, Dean.” Castiel’s voice flows into his receiver, deep but relaxed, and Dean pictures him wearing a cozy pajama set and sitting in a leather recliner. He has no idea if that’s correct, obviously—he’s never been inside Cas’ apartment or seen him in non-public attire.
“You’re not old enough to be drinking that, are you?” he asks, reaching for the bottle.
Dean sits back a little on Cas’ lap to give himself better access to Cas’ belt as he continues to kiss him, then fumbles with the button on his jeans until Cas pushes his hands away with a huff.
Castiel bristles. “It’s fine, Dean. My spells haven’t let me down yet.”
Damn, now Dean’s really getting uncomfortable in his jeans. He reaches down to palm his crotch, groaning a little at the pressure there.
"Here," she says. "Try this and tell me what it tastes like."
“Sure, okay,” Dean murmurs, looking apologetically around the table.
The reporter turns at a commotion behind her, and Zachariah Adler appears from the doors of Archimedes Hall.
"Hello, Dean," Cas says.
He hears a sharp intake of breath from Dean beside him. “Cas, what’re you doing?”
She looks away to pour a glass from the fizzing bottle, waving her spare hand around the kitchen as she speaks. “Help yourself to a drink, sweetie. Just leave your food there with the rest.”
“Like you’ve done the last two nights?” Dean says cheekily.
Dean lingers outside the door, looking uncertain until Castiel pulls him into a deep kiss.
Dean’s forehead wrinkles in confusion. “Uh, you okay? How much wine did you have?”
Dean’s brows furrow as he takes this in. He glances over at Cas, alternating between staring at him and the road. “What options? The only option we’ve got is to wait for graduation, right?”
“Lord Milton,” the watchman greeted, apparently knowing his peerage better than Dean did, damn it. “Good to see you back in London, Sir.”
The other thing that feels impossible at the moment is getting said boyfriend to put his phone down and
“Honestly, in the light, I didn’t catch the change in Sinclair. If you hadn’t tried to alert me when you did, the fight may not have gone so well. So...thank you, Castiel.”
?” Castiel demands in utter horror. “She knows better! I’ve told her every consequence, made them all read every case study—”
“What’re they doing?” Castiel says lowly.
. Thank you, Nikki <3
“Dean?” Ash prompted, with the air of someone who’d asked more than once.
present in Cas’ voice, makes Dean speed up his hand. “Think about spreading you open, about being inside you, hearing you scream—”
Castiel nodded begrudgingly, before turning to swim right out of the room and back towards the entrance to the home cavern.
“Well, that’s a long story, but I’ll give you the short version since I’m just waiting for Sam to come before I kill you anyway. Y’see, I’m on a mission.”
Dean shrugs one shoulder. “Maybe? Fucker might do anything, I really don’t trust him at all.”
They smiled at each other secretly. Dean was pleased with himself; Castiel seemed much relaxed since the beginning of the set, much less on edge—though his eyes still moved around and settled immediately on Lady Donn once they straightened up, Dean noticed. As they should.
He'd circled back to the pond, allowing the hunter to stoop to drink as he dropped to the ground to stretch out his legs. The water had looked cool and inviting, so on a whim, he'd shed his boots, stockings, coat and waistcoat and dived in, as he’d done countless times on the peninsula in streams and rivers there.
and the storm—it’d been two weeks now, so everyone did. Dean was sure he must be beet red.
“Can’t remember,” Castiel sighs sleepily, though his voice is still laced with slight panic. “But I was sad… Really sad.”
Castiel can't help but keep looking over towards Anna, still lying unconscious. Worry starts to take over—he hears Victor speaking but the words are muffled, and a chill creeps over his arms and up his neck, making him shiver.
Castiel withdrew.
Cas gets through Thursday without fuss. He goes to work for the first time this week, managing not to fry the elevator or any of the other electronics, and although he feels restless and prickly, he doesn’t overload. When Dean isn’t at home when he gets back that evening, he tries not to worry. The guy probably just got caught up with Bobby or something.
Castiel shook his head, and surprisingly, he laughed as Dean stepped back. “Try not to get cracked around the head and leave me to fight alone, next time,” Castiel threw back, grinning as his chest heaved in precious air.
John peered up at him, still scowling. “Where’ve you been all week? You’n Sam, always off swannin’ about somewhere, I never see you anymore.”
Gabriel rolls his eyes. “If you can’t feel the bond, you’re either dumb or insecure. Since my baby bro wouldn’t put a claim on a doofus, I’m thinking it’s the latter, right?”
Castiel looks between the two professors, trying to keep his cool despite his hammering heartbeat. "Where exactly was I seen to use lay magic?"
Novak doesn’t say anything for a few moments, his mouth opening and closing. Eventually he puts his glass down on the coffee table in front of him, and reaches up to rub at his eyes with his thumb and fingers. “Crowley, while I agree with your ideals, I’m really not sure that doing this in such an underhanded way is the best way to approach—”
Bobby steps back, and his eyes turn to Cas.
Castiel clenched his fists around the bandages he’d wrapped around them, gritted his teeth and stepped in towards Dean to throw an uppercut. Dean blocked him easily, sidestepping and moving around him to his left. Dean feinted low, but Castiel was ready for him, blocking Dean’s punch towards his face.
“Her husband was a prisoner of war,” Castiel said suddenly, sounding utterly horrified. “It happens, that we can’t get our boys back, or they pass before they are reached, sometimes—a tragedy, of course, but surely she can’t hold us responsible for—”
"I saw you," Pam says heavily. "No doubt. The fates do not lie."
Dean pulls back at that, resting his forehead against Castiel’s and taking a few breaths. “What did you do that for? Felt so good…”
He’s had to dive head-first back into lesson plans for his first-year classes for the coming semester, while Dean supposedly gets back into working on his thesis when he isn’t over at Castiel’s place—although he’s started staying over more nights in the week to save himself the commute. Castiel is perfectly happy with this arrangement—he loves having Dean in bed beside him early in the morning, warm and inviting, more often than not with a hard length pressing against him and sleepy kisses to his skin. They haven’t replicated their levitation act, but not for lack of trying. Yes, he could get used to this.
The words linger with the smile on Castiel’s lips as he drifts to sleep.
Castiel couldn’t help a small chuckle at that. “Tomorrow morning will be soon enough, thank you. But if you wanted to go and fetch us some more of those little lemon tartlets, I should be able to hold the fort while you go and visit her.”
“Maybe just a touch,” she says dismissively. “Most of the students who’ll be drinking them wouldn’t recognize it.” She points to the next shot in the row. “Drink up. Next one’s my favorite.”
Any other time Dean would have rolled his eyes at the Frenchman’s theatrical tendencies, but he didn’t waste the time. Instead, he pushed straight at Castiel’s elbow, pointing to an open area of floor right under a broken window, the same one that had admitted the black cloud of demons that were now picking off dancers and wallflowers in equal measure, one by one.
Castiel's sister, now Lady Anna Shurley of a wealthy estate in Buckinghamshire, was currently leasing a house with her husband near the river in Twickenham, not far to the west of town.
Footsteps retreated, and Meg gasped again, clenching tightly around Dean. "Oh! Oh!" she cried as she collapsed down on Dean's chest, but she was pulled up again presently and the linen pulled back from Dean's face.
J certainly lived in town or nearby, and was certainly well-educated enough to be widely read, on top of all the other fine qualities that Dean was discovering in his mind. So there was a good chance, he figured, that J was somewhere in this room.
“I just want to see if I’m right about the magic flow here,” Castiel explains, mirroring his position. As their eyes lock, Castiel draws in a breath at the jewel green of Dean’s eyes in the bright sunlight. Dean gazes back at him for a few moments, before he looks down at their hands, briefly.
“Well, I doubt it could ever truly be level. We might not have to rely on lay magic anymore to cast spells, but we still have no resources—no access to education,” Anna points out. After everything she’s been through—forming the resistance group, assembling her own coven, making deals with Crowley and Rowena and nearly dying from them—nothing had prepared her for the aftermath. There’s no clear path for the next step towards equal rights, and she feels a little lost right now, wondering what her future will look like.
Castiel was bristling, scowling at Crowley. Maybe he wasn’t quite in Crowley’s pocket, or at least not anymore. He called something out in his own language, the musical tones making Dean wish that he understood it all over again.
And into the hand of a man, walking out of the waves.
“I…need to head to the restroom,” Castiel murmurs. “Can I meet back up with you?”
“But we’ll hardly get the chance to be alone
"Yes sir," Dean agreed. He
Blinking dazed eyes and staggering, Castiel stumbled. Just a momentary wobble from the shock, but enough for the man to turn his attention from him and crack his elbow into the side of Dean’s temple while he was distracted.
This time when Dean comes, Cas leans down and kisses him through it, the heat of his mouth sweet as fire consumes him all over again. Magic is flowing into him, out of him. Swirling around inside of him and between them. This time he doesn’t pass out, despite lying in bed bonelessly.
Dean snaps his fingers, an excited grin on his face. “I’ll clear the brambles from your forest place, with the walls. You got like a machete or something?”
They carry the other bodies down from the garden and lay them beside the first victim on the dry grass—the corpses up on the drive will have to be dealt with in a second pyre, Castiel realizes. He locates a wheeled cart in the back of the shed, and they load it with wood, having to make several trips from the large firewood pile stacked against the back wall to bring enough.
Castiel shrugs, looking sheepish. “I could spell them to be more precise, but my father taught Gabriel and I this method when we were kids. I enjoy thinking of simpler times, though my skills obviously leave much to be desired.”
Dean walks over with his serving plate of potatoes and carrots. He eyes Patience and Jack, then asks Claire through a mouthful of vegetables, “What’s she doin’?”
"No, that's not how it…jeez, I keep forgetting how little you know." Dean shakes his head.
