John grinned and led Sherlock out to the bathroom. He started the water, looking for some extra towels before stepping in. He wasn't kidding when he said the shower was tight. There was just enough room for them to both stand inside with a centimetre between them.
"Well, you're still as sexy as when we first met," Sherlock said and smiled. He locked their lips together again and pulled back to rest their foreheads together. "I love you so much," he murmured.
John panted heavily with the force of the orgasm, nearly collapsing on top of Sherlock. He kissed him back, mind still only half working, so he had no idea what Sherlock was saying before they kissed again. He rolled them onto their sides and pulled out of Sherlock so that he could pull off the condom and toss it away.
John's jaw dropped at the sight of the theatre. He had seen on the telly once or twice people who had put a theatre in their house, but in person it was even more impressive. He followed Sherlock down to the DVD closet and looked through the choices. "I...I don't even know. I don't think my mind is working well enough yet to pick. This is fantastic!" He turned to Sherlock and kissed his cheek, wrapping his arms around the other boy's waist. "Why don't you pick? Surprise me."
Sherlock followed John into slumber and was sleeping peacefully until a few hours later when he started to dream.
"Nnnngh, John..." Sherlock groaned and tightened his grip in his boyfriend's hair. His heart was pounding and his hips bucked up, showing his impatience.
John flushed a little, as snogging in the car reminded him of their escapade in the limo at Sherlock's birthday party. He quickly shook his head, not wanting to dwell on it and then have an awkward erection to deal with. He leaned into Sherlock's side and closed his eyes.
John put his free hand on Sherlock's shoulder as they started to move. "Neither will I. I'll never get tired of anything about you." He pressed his ear to Sherlock's chest, listening to his favourite sound.
No sex that he had ever had before could even compare to this one moment. John rocked into Sherlock's hand, the friction of his hand and cock driving him wild. With his hands now free, John could explore Sherlock's body, hands roaming over the smooth skin.
Sherlock groaned and rolled his eyes, but as soon as he looked at John's face he caved. "Fine," he sighed dramatically and smiled, "but only because you're so adorable when you beg." He kissed John on the nose and headed out the door, chuckling.
Mr. Tabling nodded, "that's certainly true. I have another question for you." Sherlock clasped his hands together and waited. "Have you ever done any recreational drugs?" Sherlock cleared his throat and nodded, "yes... I have." The defence lawyer stood and walked towards the stand, "so, it's entirely possible... that you may have been hallucinating when this so called 'attack' happened. In fact, it may not have ever happened at all... there are no witnesses. Are we just supposed to take the word of a druggie?"
Sherlock waited as patiently as he could, but soon found he couldn't anymore. He decided to help John and started working on their trousers, growling as he fumbled with the buttons and zippers.
John grinned back, feeling better, "good." He kissed him again, slower this time, but with the same feeling. Sherlock was so precious to him, he hated to think of how many things might have prevented them from meeting. He wrapped his arms around his lover's neck to hold him close, wanting him to know that nothing could ever make John change his mind about those three little words.
John tried to be reassured by Sherlock's words but he was still incredibly nervous. He kept a tight hold on Sherlock's hand, only letting go to wash up in the incredible bathroom. He looked in the mirror, doing his best to fix himself up to look presentable, then followed Sherlock down to the dining hall. As with everything else in the house, it was also huge and beautiful. There was a long table, set with fine china and silverware. Another chandelier hung above them and all around the room were cabinets of crystal figures and paintings hanging on the walls. Swallowing, John gripped Sherlock's hand for support.
John slumped forward onto the seat, warmth spreading through him with the heat of his lover's release. He panted, staring into the mirror at the two of them, and smiled wryly. "God, yes it was...We look good like this," he said, taking in their flushed, sticky with sweat appearance.
Sherlock was about to tell John to hurry the hell up when he felt his lips enclose the tip of his arousal. "
John relaxed, kissing Sherlock back. He was glad that he had gotten through to him. Now if only they could avoid these problems in the first place. John smirked at Sherlock's question. "Of course. I wasn't going to leave letting her think she won. As if she ever had a chance."
John took the seat offered him and grabbed a few pieces of toast and some bacon and eggs. He turned to look at Sherlock, frowning when his father said that he was actually screaming from the nightmares. He swallowed what was in his mouth, and put a hand on Sherlock's knee. "You can call me next time," he said softly. "I don't want you to have to go through that alone."
John chuckled. "A little while. He's out of practice." Already he couldn't bring himself to open his eyes again, they were so heavy.
The next morning, John woke before Sherlock, smiling when he remembered all the best parts of the day before. He started kissing Sherlock's neck slowly, letting his lips linger for long periods in one place before moving.
John was dying. He must have been because he was sweating and nauseous and lightheaded. Not to mention, he was trapped at the altar, so his nervousness was probably obvious to the billions of people that were sitting in the pews. He chewed on his bottom lip, ripping it to pieces before realising that he would have to kiss Sherlock with those lips later and he shouldn't ruin them. Instead he started tugging on his jacket sleeves, desperate for anything to distract him from how nerve-wracking this was.
Sherlock smiled and brushed his fingers across John's forehead. "As are you, love." He leaned forward and kissed the other boy softly on the lips. "I love you so much," he murmured.
your fault that your mother left. That was her choice and there is nothing you could have done to stop her. You have a wonderful father who loves you and cares about you and you have me and my family too. The fact she couldn't accept your sister for who she is... Well, it's not right. But don't you go blaming yourself for any of it."
Sherlock moaned around John's cock and took him all the way to the back of his throat in one go. After he felt his lover's arse muscles finally relax, he pushed his finger in and started working it in and out. He went slowly at first, then sped up a little and after a few strokes he added a second finger and started crooking them, trying to find John's prostate.
Sherlock decided on one of the new films his father just got in. He grabbed the DVD and put it in the player, then walked out and shut the door behind him.
Sherlock hummed in content, "so, what can we do to occupy ourselves for the rest of the day?" He ran his fingers softly through John's hair and closed his eyes.
Sherlock returned the kiss with equal fervor, grasping tightly to the other boy's shoulders as he thrust in and out of his body. He wrapped his legs around John's waist, pulling him closer, needing him deeper inside of him. He wanted to be completely surrounded by his lover and he pulled away from the kiss several moments later, gasping for breath.
John kissed Sherlock's chest and closed his eyes. "No, you won't." He yawned a little. Today had been rather exhausting.
Sherlock tried to throw off John's hand on his shoulder, still asleep. "No... I don't want to, you can't make me!" He yelled and kept struggling. "Leave me alone...
Sherlock looked up at his lover and started sucking harder. He brought a hand up to grab one of his arse cheeks and squeezed it, hoping the added stimulation would bring him that much closer to release.
John shook his head, taking Sherlock's hands away. "No, I'm not taking any chances. You'll be in more pain than pleasure, and if you move the wrong way your stitches might open." He took one of Sherlock's hands and kissed the palm, then kissed each fingertip. "Don't worry, you'll be better before you know it."
John nipped Sherlock's ear lobe and tugged. "You are. No one could ever pleasure me like you do." He squeezed Sherlock's cock and started moving at an erratic pace. "Fuck...I'm getting close..." he warned, trying to angle to Sherlock's sweet spot before he came.
John squirmed and laughed under Sherlock's kisses. "Hey, c-cut it out!" He grabbed Sherlock's face and pulled him up for a long, slow kiss. "I love you more than that," he whispered against his lips.
"Nothing was said beforehand? He just... pulled a gun on you?" Sherlock cleared his throat and Helen looked back at him, "What?"
Sherlock smiled against the top of John's head, "I love you too, John Watson," he murmured. He closed his eyes and nuzzled closer to his fiance, knowing he would only have happy dreams with his lover in his arms.
"I recall you doing very well dancing with me at my birthday party, you have natural rhythm, that's all it takes." Sherlock turned John so they were facing each other and moved in close, grinding their crotches together as the music continued to play.
Sherlock groaned and narrowed his eyes, "bloody tease," he mumbled. He cracked a mischievous smile and grabbed onto John's hips. He swiftly stood and wrapped John's legs around his waist, then started spinning in the middle of the field, laughing loudly and smiling wider than he ever remembered doing before. This was just perfect.
"Da...I sort of lied to you this morning on the phone. Well, really I left something out." He knew he was starting to ramble and he tried to get his thoughts together. "The thing is, Sherlock is my friend, but he's also... He's more than my friend. He's my... boyfriend." He bit his lip and looked up at his father, trying to read his expression.
Mr. Watson looked warily at John as he spoke. "Now, lad, you know that won't get you anywhere fast."
Sherlock smiled back and gave his fiancé another hug before pulling away. "Let's go grab some lunch, yeah?" he said and stood, holding out his hand for John.
John lapped at Sherlock's neck, tongue gliding over an older mark he'd left there. "Figured you'd think that." He started sucking a new mark in place just below it. He was glad that they were already naked, because his hands had full access to Sherlock's gorgeous pale body without fumbling with clothes. He ran his hands along his lover's chest and down his sides.
Sherlock managed to sit next to John during the rest of their classes and made sure to tease him relentlessly with lingering touches and whispered flirtations.
John could barely think by the time it was over, and only just registered that Sherlock was licking his hand clean. He pulled his fingers out of himself and laid back with a groan. "God...That was incredible..."
John squeaked and dropped the bags as he was picked up. "Sherlock!" He wrapped his arms around the other man's neck and held tight, laughing. "Carry me to bed, husband?" he said with a cheeky grin.
Sherlock released his lover's hips and slid them down his thighs. He pulled off and immediately reached up to grab John's hands, pulling him up and into a standing position. Once he felt like his fiance was stable enough, he took his cock into his mouth and down his throat again, pausing when he had it all the way in. This time, he clasped his hands behind him and looked up at John, silently telling him he had control now.
John grinned and moved back to where he was. He mouthed over the center of Sherlock's chest and then moved towards his stomach. Here he left sweet kisses all across the width, very gentle and feather-light. His hands were roaming Sherlock's legs again, smoothing over the soft skin.
John was nearly crying in pleasure. He had thought it was great before, but without a condom he could actually
Sherlock whimpered in pleasure and began rolling his hips down onto John's talented fingers. "John... oh, John..." he murmured and felt his cock twitching against his stomach as his fingertips grazed his prostate. He was shaking in anticipation of what was to come. Craving the feeling of John inside of him, taking him over completely and loving him in the most intimate way possible.
John laughed, pulling Sherlock up to kiss him. "Come on, let's play something else. This is fun." He really didn't get a chance to do this much anymore, not since he was in primary school. And it was fun to do something new with Sherlock.
John sniffled a little and swallowed down the lump in his throat. "Thank you," he said and snuggled against Sherlock. "I can't imagine life without you now," he admitted against Sherlock's neck. "I've never had another person who was so important to me. And I'll never leave you or let anyone take me from you, nor you from me."
"That was only a few days ago, if you think about it." John made a soft sound, arching towards Sherlock's fingers. "Don't distract me while I'm riding. I don't want you to get hurt." He started the bike and took off from Sherlock's drive, heading for home.
Sherlock smirked, even with a blush forming across his face, "thank you, John... However, I don't think that is a proper name of a size." He chuckled and turned to pull on his sleep trousers, staying bent over with his arse turned towards John for a bit longer than necessary.
Sherlock chuckled, "I know, I don't want you to go either, but you have to." He smirked mischievously and put his lips up to John's ear. "If you don't get up, I'm just going to have to make you..." he whispered huskily.
"Mmm, Sherlock..." John moaned and let his head fall back, eyes sliding shut. He brought a hand up to thread through those gorgeous dark curls, pulling a little, and pressing in closer to his lover.
John stroked Sherlock through his climax as his own approached. The feeling of Sherlock tightening around him and the sounds and movements as he came finally brought his own release, crying out his fiancé's name. He poured out deep inside of Sherlock, the rest of his body trembling with the force of the orgasm.
John couldn't help a sound of his own. Watching Sherlock succumb to his minstrations was incredibly hot. He moved his hand faster, pumping the entire length and trying to get Sherlock to moan like that again.
It wasn't Sherlock himself that had caused his father to get upset. It was the fact that Sherlock was a boy and his father had been through so much already because of Harry liking the same gender. Any boy that he might have brought home, or even just telling his father that he fancied boys, would have given the same results.
Sherlock felt anger rise in him and he closed his eyes, "they need more evidence of how bad Sebastian is? How violent and...
John chuckled a little, stepping out of the car and taking Sherlock's hand. "Why, thank you." Together they walked up to the door. From outside the tuneless pounding of bass could be felt, and there were lights on in the backyard where most of the voices were coming from. He took a deep breath, preparing himself for the inevitable meeting with drunk peers.
Sherlock gasped and pulled John closer, reaching his free hand back behind his lover. He leaned down to lock their lips together in a wet kiss. His tongue reached out for John's and stroked against it as he slid his fingers up and down the other boy's crack teasingly.
He couldn't help laughing at Sherlock's childhood pictures and he rubbed his fiancé's back good-naturedly. "Come on, Sherlock, you were adorable. Look at that cute little mop of curls."
Sherlock beamed as tears came to his eyes and he held John close, giving him gentle, loving kisses. He pulled back after several minutes and held up the hand that the ring was on, turning it over and looking at it. "It looks wonderful on you," he said and smiled. "When do you think we should make the announcement?"
Sherlock moaned and started working on John's tie, loosening it and pulling it over his head. He bucked up into the other boy, his breath coming out in pants. "Oh God, John..." He pulled his fiancé's shirt out of his trousers and slid his hands underneath, digging his fingers into the skin of his back.
"What? You mean we have to...move?" John felt his heart shatter. He couldn't be away from Sherlock, he just couldn't. This was all his fault. If he hadn't instigated, he wouldn't have gotten hurt and Moran wouldn't have beaten him like that.
John gasped and cried out, his hand only barely muffling it as he finally climaxed. His hips went wild into Sherlock's mouth, spilling out hard and fast with the amazing sensations.
John blushed a little, shrugging. "It's easy when you have someone to be brave for. I would do anything for you, anything you ask me to, anything to protect you." He leaned up to kiss Sherlock tenderly. "You make me brave."
"Go on... pick something out," Sherlock said, sitting down on the ottoman. "I want you to model for me," he said, lowering his tone and winking.
John swallowed, remembering the conversation, and his cheeks went a bit pink. He hoped that Sherlock wouldn't be upset by that, he was just being stupid. "Well...yes, I did. But that doesn't mean that I would have bullied a gay person if that's what you're implying. I don't agree with picking on people."
Sherlock wrapped his arms around John's waist and kissed him back tenderly. He smiled as he pulled away, "I wrote it for you..." he said softly and blushed. "You're such a wonderful person, so... beautiful. I just had to write a song to show you exactly what I feel for you. Words just aren't enough."
John returned the kiss, finally relaxing completely under the touch of his lover's lips. "Don't worry. Mycroft's got nothing on you." He wrapped his arms around Sherlock and held him close. "I'm glad to be yours, and wouldn't want to be anyone else's." He pressed his forehead to the other boy's, closing his eyes.
John smiled and returned the kiss, feeling better. He thought for a moment about what they could wear. It wouldn't be a formal party, that was for sure, but he wanted to look semi-decent considering this was the first real high school party he'd been too. "I've got nothing. Any ideas?"
touch him. Let him be the one to touch you first. If he reaches out for you, approach very cautiously, any sudden movements could snap him back into this. Don't mention the episode
John waited until all the boys had turned the corner, keeping a stern eye on them, before bending down next to the boy. He could see his body trembling and felt even more angry at the boys for their behaviour, but pushed it away. He needed to help this kid, whoever he was. "Hey," he said quietly, and gingerly rested his hand on the boy's shoulder. "Are you alright?" He seemed so helpless, the way he had laid there and accepted the beating. There was no way that he had done anything more than be in the wrong place at the wrong time.
"W-we were at Mary's party," he said. "And we were alone, and he was...we were getting intimate. And we were saying things and I said...'learn your lesson'. That's what set him off. Then he ran and I found him crying like usual and I tried to snap him out of it but then he just..." John remembered the blank look on Sherlock's face, the limpness of his body, and he looked at the heart monitor.
John listened to Sherlock and could hear the depth of emotion in his voice, which matched the emotion in his eyes, and he felt his heart warming. It touched him that someone cared so much about him, and John found his eyes watering as he stared back into Sherlock's bright blue eyes. "I would do the same for you. You're the most precious thing in my life," he said, voice a little choked.
Sherlock nodded and frowned. "About the attacks... From before I met you." He held John tighter and rested his cheek on the top of his head. "It was awful..." he whispered and shivered.
Sherlock fisted the sheets on the bed and bit his lip harder as he felt John's teeth on his cock. He nearly cried out when his lover's finger finally penetrated him, but somehow managed to keep quiet. He wished he could convince John to have sex with him tonight, though the likelihood of that was pretty much non existent.
John was extremely lucky that he was alive. The way Moran had pounded on him... He could feel the nightmares coming on already. He looked up at Sherlock, just glad to be able to see his face, and be with him.
John sat down next to Sherlock, resting his arms on the bar. "I don't know. I guess seltzer water is fine for me. I try to avoid drinking." He hadn't mentioned much about Harry to Sherlock so far, but now wasn't the time. He didn't want to spoil the mood with stories of his sister's descent into alcoholism.
John nodded. "That's right. Nice to meet you," he said. He couldn't help but notice the small amount of contact between them as they walked, but he didn't mind. At least the boy, Sherlock, seemed comfortable enough not to walk at a distance from him. They made it to the bathroom and John led Sherlock over to the basin, turning on the water so that it would warm up a little. He got some paper towels and wet them, reaching up to clean the blood from Sherlock's face. His skin was so pale it made the crimson stand out that much more, and John shivered a little, feeling a strange sense of de ja vu. Shaking his head, he asked Sherlock, "What did you do to get them so riled up?"
much about it... I want you to pin me against the wall and feel the water sliding over our bodies as you pound into me."
Sherlock hummed in content and leaned into John's touch, "I'll have to give you a private dance later... I was thinking about it while I was on the dance floor." He closed his eyes and sighed, "I love you, John."
Sherlock studied John's face as he looked at the mansion and judging by his expression he seemed embarrassed, but why?
would be very easily heard. It was bad enough that his father looked at him funny that morning, probably because of their wanking session the night before.
Despite Sherlock nudging John to the side repeatedly as they played, he still managed to win. Sherlock backed away and sighed, "I totally just let you beat me," he grumbled and put on a fake pout.
He had put on his nicest outfit, which wound up being just a jumper with a button down shirt underneath and some jeans. His father was home from work, and John was surprised he had managed to get off for something like this. But he was glad. He wanted everything to be perfect tonight, and having his father there was a big plus.
Sherlock gasped and smiled, "I learned from the best," he smacked his lover's arse and walked past him to the bedroom.
"Scarves should be fine. I don't want to hurt you." John moved to Sherlock's hips and held him still, smirking. "Not yet, my love." He nudged Sherlock off of his lap and stood up.
John chuckled, and shook his head. "Sherlock Holmes, you are still as insatiable as when we first met." He pulled his husband (oh, he loved that word) into his lap and wrapped his arms around his waist. "But we're not doing anything. I want to save it all for tonight."
He led them through the front door, not expecting the welcome that they received. As soon as they started down the hall, the entire school broke out into applause. Sherlock almost felt tears come to his eyes and he smiled, gripping tighter to his fiance's hand.
Sherlock almost stood up, almost ran over to John to hold his hand, but he didn't. He stayed put and looked over at John lovingly, doing what he could to support him. He mouthed 'I love you', hoping that the other boy saw him as he continued to speak.
The man smiled. "That won't be necessary. But please do hurry to change as Master Holmes will be here soon."
At lunchtime, they met in the cafe and John walked off to grab them both a drink. While he was away, Sebastian approached the table and sat across from Sherlock, glaring at him. "You better stay away from John, freak. I know what you're trying to do. You're trying to corrupt him, make him a freak like you, but that's not going to happen."
Sherlock set his phone on his bedside table and snuggled deeper under the covers. His pillow still smelled like John and he clutched it closer, imagining that he was in bed with the other boy again.
yours." Sherlock moaned loudly and reached back to grab onto what part of John he could reach, digging his nails in. "I... I want so badly to be the best you've ever had," he gasped.
Sherlock was trying to figure out how to get out of the situation he had currently found himself in. He had made the bad mistake of provoking the rugby team captain and was currently backed up against a wall by a group of angry players. He knew what was coming, he'd been beaten up before and he knew there was no sense in trying to get away. It was also unlikely that anyone would be coming along to intervene, because all the professors were gone for the day and he had no friends, so he closed his eyes and waited for the first punch.
Sherlock chuckled, "that's only because I have such a great student. This wouldn't be nearly as easy if you weren't so good." He smiled and continued to rotate the beaker. After a few moments, he leaned down to whisper in John's ear. "Now... there are a lot of other things I could teach you that aren't at all appropriate in a classroom setting," he said with a smirk and nipped at John's earlobe.
John turned his head to find Sherlock looking at him, the last of a blush fading from his cheeks. He must have still been a little nervous with John and he couldn't help a soft smile. The thought of spending the night was tempting, he hadn't slept over at a friend's house since he was in grade school. "Sure, I'll stay over. I'll just ring my father after dinner." John looked up at the ceiling and put his arms behind his head. "So tell me something, and sorry if this seems rude, but I'm really curious. How does your family have all this money?"
John took deep breaths trying to calm his pounding heart. He couldn't think of anything to say to describe such an amazing experience so when Sherlock spoke he just said, "Yeah, that." He chuckled softly and shifted so that he could bury his face in Sherlock's neck, and he trailed soft kisses over the area that he could reach. "I would never think," he said against his skin, "that you were a virgin only a few days ago. You're a fantastic lover."
Sherlock continued to roll and grind his hips, bringing his arms up around John's neck. "I've never given a lap dance before," he murmured, "you should feel very special." He alternated between rolling his hips in perfect circles and swaying them back and forth, continuing to please his lover with each movement.
He began to kiss and nip at the skin of his collar, and over towards his shoulder. His hands smoothed all along the front of Sherlock's body, tracing the contours of his muscles and ghosting over the remains of bruising from the day before.
He ducked his head and blushed, extremely embarrassed over the entire display. When dinner was finally served, he relaxed a bit, taking a few bites before just pushing the rest of the food around on his plate.
"It's not your fault, it's mine," Sherlock murmured, still looking out the window. He didn't mean to make John feel
"/Shit/," Sherlock breathed and couldn't help but buck his hips against his lover's. "I can't believe... how horny I am on a regular basis now. The things you do to me, John... /God/, you're just entirely irresistible."
"Sherlock, listen, please," he said right in his ear. "It's John. It's just me and no one else. You're safe, you're here with me. I love you." He tried to hug him, afraid that Sherlock would shake him off again.
Helen crossed her arms in front of her chest and raised an eyebrow, "kind of? You 'kind of' told him? John..." She sighed and rubbed the bridge of her nose, "these are the kinds of things you need to tell me! If you threatened him... they'll try to make it seem like self defence. You didn't actually
John let out a sigh of relief when Sherlock didn't say anything or have any sort of reaction to what he had said. He pressed on, and answered the next question. "Sherlock wasn't in because he was still recovering. I was eating lunch and Sebastian came over to me with some of the boys and started to pick on me. There was a bit of back and forth and then I was on the ground with him on top of me, punching me until I blacked out." He took a few deep breaths, almost able to feel the pain again.
"Hey!" John flipped over, spluttering, and swam after Sherlock. He dove under the other boy and popped up in front of him, splashing him quickly and then diving away.
Helen smiled reassuringly at John and reached out to pat his hand, "you did good, John. That will be all." She motioned for Sherlock to bring his chair over to the table, which he did as fast as he could. He sat down and hugged John before turning back to Ms. Rodin, grabbing the other boy's hand and lacing their fingers together.
John swallowed, imagining himself in Sherlock's arms, being touched everywhere. He knew what his fiancé was trying to do. Two could play at that game. "I would bury my face in your neck, and kiss you there. You have such lovely skin there, so pale and smooth."
John really didn't want to have to leave Sherlock either. So when he asked if he could stay the night, there was no hesitation in his answer. He looked up and smiled softly at him. "Of course. It'll be good for both of us." He pulled away enough to start leading Sherlock towards his bike.
Sebastian chuckled, "Aw, come on, John! We're just having a little fun!" He said and smiled, holding his hands out in an attempt to calm John down.
"Sherlock," John said, waking further. "Come on, lovey. You have to eat something." He wiggled out of Sherlock's arms and stood up.
to ever find anyone." He spoke with a bitter tone in his voice, swallowing down tears and feeling his heart clench. He'd been called many things by his peers: freak, faggot, arsehole... none of them even remotely as positive as what John just said. He smiled gratefully down at him, "thank you for thinking so, though," he said softly.
John swallowed and kissed him back, taking the comfort happily. "I know. I know we are." He put his arm back to where it was, holding Sherlock close to him, relishing in their closeness.
A few girls surrounded him, all looking and smelling like they had been drinking since that afternoon. "E-excuse me," he said, trying to push his way out, but they held their position.
Sherlock looked up and smiled tiredly. "Hey..." He tried to stand and almost fell, having to grab onto John's shoulders to keep himself up. "Sorry..." he mumbled and looked down at his fiancé.
John just caught Moran leaving as he was coming back and rushed over to the table. "What happened? Did he try to hurt you?" he asked, concerned. He wished he could have been there in the moment to tell him to back off, but Sherlock seemed unscathed.
Sherlock squeezed John's hand reassuringly and led him to the head of the table where his mum was already seated. "Well, Sherlock... Your brother told me you had a friend coming to join us! Hello dear, it's so nice to meet you! I'm Sherlock's mother, you can call me mum if you like." She smiled brightly at John and gestured for them to have a seat. Sherlock pulled a chair out for John next to his usual spot.
John watched for a moment, mesmerised by the fluidity of Sherlock's moves. For a boy who was all sharp lines and angles, he sure knew how to make himself look like he was made of liquid. But he was soon snapped out of his reverie by a crowd circling in, cheering as his fiance stole the show with his dancing. John had to fight to stay near him, and even then he was stuck behind the innermost layer of party guests.
Sherlock smiled and wrapped his hand around John's on his chest. They spent the rest of the day like that, curled up on the bed together. They talked about everything and exchanged kisses every now and then.
"Oh...God, yes," John moaned out, head lolling back to give Sherlock all his skin. "You're very bad, Sherlock. And I have thoroughly enjoyed all of the blowing you do." He took Sherlock's arse in both hands, giving it a firm squeeze.
Sherlock groaned and reached one of his hands up to tangle in John's hair at the back of his head. He opened his mouth willingly and plunged his tongue into his boyfriend's mouth.
"Going to eat something for me, darling?" John asked with a grin as he took Sherlock's hand. He squeezed it lightly as they walked towards the counter to grab trays.
Sherlock turned his fiancé towards him and leaned down to peck him on the lips. "So..." he wrapped his arms around the shorter boy and pulled him close, "what should we do while we wait?"
John groaned again, tightening his grip on their cocks, swiping hard over their slits. "Me t-too...Oh /fuck/..." He was shaking as he bucked his hips and cried out.
Sherlock took John's hand and stood, wrapping his arms around the shorter boy and kissing him quickly on the lips. "It'll all be okay, love. I'll be there for you no matter what happens, okay?" he smiled reassuringly and cupped his boyfriend's cheek before leaning down and pressing a kiss to his forehead.
"Me?" John couldn't help it, he got angry. Did Sherlock really have so little faith in him to think that he would betray him that way? He let go of him and stood. "You honestly think that after everything we've been through that I would blow it all by doing something stupid like that? In case you didn't notice, that girl is insane!
"Hello, boys! I'm just cooking, should be done soon," his father's voice said from the kitchen. John smiled. His father had been in much better spirits since the 'promotion', and John got to spend more time with him now that he was only working one job.
Sherlock pouted and followed John out the door, staying silent. He grabbed his jacket from his room and threw it on, shoving his hands in the pockets. He opened the car door for John and got in on the other side, looking out the window as they drove away.
Sherlock wrapped his arms around John, "Mmm... Yes, I'm gaining weight too. Soon you won't be able to put your arms around me." He kissed the top of the other boy's head.
Sherlock smiled and nodded, "I love you, too John... more than anything. I am so lucky to have you." He grabbed John by the back of the head and pulled him in gently for another kiss. When he pulled away to breathe, he smiled weakly. "Did you tell her off?" he asked, resting their foreheads together.
Sherlock laughed, "yeah, looks like it." He caressed John's face and smiled, "I love you so much. I can't even express to you what I feel for you, John. You're the most wonderful man," he murmured and leaned in to kiss him.
John let out a sigh of relief when Sherlock seemed to realise that he was gone, but in the next moment he was pushing his way through the opposite side of the circle, and leaving John to be closed into a large crowd as the circle morphed back into a lump. "Shit. Sherlock!" He tried to push towards where he was going, but someone grabbed him and spun him around, making him lose his direction.
John pushed in further, knowing by Sherlock's movements that he wanted him to. He added a third and final finger, burying them as deep as he could inside of his lover.
Sherlock's eyes went wide and he swallowed thickly, "Can... can we get another chair for John?" Helen bit her lip and thought for a moment, but nodded and asked for another chair.
"Twenty-seven," Sherlock said. Helen had turned towards the other lawyer once he had spoken, but after hearing Sherlock again, she turned back. "What was that?" she said, her brow furrowed.
John thrust his fingers, smirking as he realised he was giving Sherlock a show. When he couldn't take it anymore he pulled his fingers out, sitting up and climbing into Sherlock's lap. Body shaking a little, he lifted his hips and hovered over Sherlock. He lowered down slowly, feeling Sherlock penetrate him and he cried out in delight. "Oh...oh, Sherlock,
Sherlock hummed, "yes, I agree... But it's you that makes me hot in the first place," he said and chuckled. "We can start looking for a flat soon... Oh, that reminds me. Dad said that we're meeting with the lawyer on Friday after school. Do you want to spend the weekend with me again?" He hugged his pillow closer and buried his face in it.
John gasped when he finally saw where Sherlock was bringing him. He could see everything. Big Ben, the Eye, the city with all the lights. "Oh, Sherlock..." He put his hands on the railing as he looked out, tilting his head over so that it was leaning against Sherlock's. "It's amazing." He finally pulled his gaze away to look sideways at his lover. "You're amazing."
John," he whispered and pushed his hips up slightly. He wasn't sure how long he could stay quiet at the rate things were going. John was being such a tease and he was /so/ hungry for more.
John could feel himself getting closer, and he knew that Sherlock was probably right around the same place. He pushed Sherlock back into the bed so that he could more easily angle his thrusts and started going harder, aiming towards Sherlock's prostate. He moved his lips up to Sherlock's ear and tugged on the lobe with his teeth, barely able to hang on to wait for his lover to finish.
John knew in the back of his mind that tonight would wind up being their first time; he knew it from the moment that they started this in the candle-lit room. And he was perfectly fine with it. He wanted to make that connection, the ultimate form of showing his boyfriend just how much he loved him. John kissed him back with the same fervor, slipping his arms under Sherlock to lift him slightly and get closer.
Sherlock laid on his back and chuckled breathlessly, resting his arm over his eyes. "I take it you enjoyed yourself then?" He smirked and crawled up towards the head of the bed, pecking John on the lips before collapsing on the mattress beside him.
Sherlock sighed into the kiss, grateful for the touch of their lips. He looked up at John and gave a lopsided smile, "really?" Of course he noticed how fascinated his lover seemed to be with his hands, but he didn't realise how much. "I think it might help if you talked to me... I want to keep trying," he murmured.
John was lying on the couch when his father came home in between his first and second shifts. He was absently flipping through the telly, and his father plopped down near his feet. John smiled, sitting up. "How was work?"
Sherlock smiled, "later darling, I love you too." As soon as John left the room he ran to his closet and pulled out a large chest. He pulled his necklace out from under his shirt and unlocked the chest with the key that hung from it.
Sherlock leaned up to press a kiss on the back of John's neck, "you are so amazing, I love you so much," he whispered and slipped a second finger inside of his lover. He began scissoring them as he nipped at the other boy's earlobe, breathing heavily against it.
"Sh-Sherlock!" John said, a little more firmly. Oh, God, his husband was going to get him off in a plane. In front of all these people. He swallowed and closed his eyes, trying to focus on something else and force his body not to react.
Mr. Watson hadn't even noticed that he still had a hold of Ms. Rodin's hand until she pulled away. He cleared his throat and put the hand she had been holding to the back of his neck. "Not a problem. Really..." He looked off awkwardly in another direction.
Sherlock could hear several people in the pews sniffling and caught a glimpse of his mother wiping her eyes with a handkerchief as he finished speaking. He felt tears come to his own eyes as he smiled brightly down at John.
Sherlock laid there all sprawled out beneath his lover and his heart was pounding. He looked up at John with lust darkened eyes and licked his lips. It was more arousing than he thought it would be, being in such a vulnerable state, but he supposed that was because it was John that was in control right now. Had it been anyone else, he wouldn't have enjoyed this nearly as much.
Sherlock let his eyes flutter open and he smiled down at John, "hello there," he murmured and stretched his legs a little. John grinned up at him. "Hello." He shifted a little, but everything was still sore and he groaned in pain. "This sucks," he said. "What time is it?" He looked around but there wasn't a clock in the room.
He shook his head and sighed, he really needed to stop this, it was getting ridiculous. He was acting like a girl. Later that afternoon while lying on the ground, looking up at the clouds, he found himself dozing off and fell into a deep sleep rather quickly, dreaming of his and John's future.
Sherlock chuckled softly, but stayed still as John returned the attention. "Now who's the sap?" He let his fiancé kiss every inch of his face and slid his hand down John's side. He touched every inch and slid around to his back, wanting to touch every part of his lover's body.
As soon as John's lips met Sherlock's again, he kissed him desperately, channeling all his feelings into it. He let out a soft whimper and rocked his hips back onto his lover's fingers.
Sherlock swayed along to the beat, leaning in to whisper in John's ear. "You're such a good dancer, I don't know why you were ever nervous."
John cried out, pushing his fingers into Sherlock further as a response to the hit on his prostate. He ground into Sherlock faster, moving to rest his forehead on Sherlock's shoulder as his body started to shake. "So...so close, fuck..."
John spent the entirety of his waiting time just thinking in silence. All he wanted was Sherlock, to know that he was definitely alright. Alive. When the nurse came out he let out a breath that he hadn't realised he was holding, and jumped up to follow her back.
John shivered at the feeling of Sherlock's breath and wrapped his arms around his lover's waist. "Sounds good to me." He slipped his hands down further to Sherlock's arse and squeezed.
John let go with one hand do reach down and grab his balls, rolling them with his palm. "Yes, Sherlock, come. Come for me!" He groaned as he came ever closer, knowing one more move in the right way would do it. "Fuck,
John let out a relaxed groan as he was freed from the rest of his clothes, but soon returned to little whines and whimpers when Sherlock wouldn't touch his aching erection. He writhed at the lack of friction, trying to catch Sherlock's lips at least once.
John returned the embrace, closing his eyes in content. "You're very welcome. You deserved it." He pulled away to finish rinsing and then shut the water, stepping out to get towels. He wrapped one around Sherlock and took one for himself.
Sherlock was kept in the hospital for the rest of the week and he was released that Saturday. He insisted on John coming home with him and his parents agreed to let it happen. He got settled in his room again and was currently wrapped up in the blankets with John's legs tangled with his own as they exchanged kisses, touching in about a million different places as reassurance that they were both alive and okay.
amazing," he said and smiled. He pulled his fiancé in close and rested their foreheads together, sighing happily.
John understood Sherlock's silent desire and he pulled his finger away, reaching it up for Sherlock to suck on. He honestly felt like he could have fully fucked him right then and there if he hadn't just been sucked off himself.
"Sherlock doesn't eat much," John said, pushing his own food around on the plate. Mr. Watson just nodded a little. John now felt like he couldn't finish eating either and he bit his lip. Should he try to explain to his father what had really happened? Would he say that Sherlock wasn't worth the trouble and tell him to stop seeing him? He couldn't risk that.
John followed Sherlock out of the limo and into the castle, the same castle where Sherlock's eighteenth birthday was held. Many of the guests had already arrived and greeted them with hugs and handshakes, all with wishes of congratulations.
John sighed, pulling Sherlock into his arms. "It's alright. Though I wish you had, because then maybe I wouldn't have been stupid enough to follow Mary." He pulled back to wipe his fiance's tears.
John knew what this was. Getting him used to not having Sherlock right next to him as he was questioned. He smiled reassuringly at his fiance, and then sat in the chair Ms. Rodin had indicated.
Sherlock followed him, straddling his waist and managing to latch onto his tongue before it retreated and chase it back into his mouth. He kissed John deeply for a few moments before moving to his jaw and kissing his way down his neck. He moved further down until he swiped his tongue along John's nipple and winked up at him before pulling the duvet over his head.
John's heart broke. He had made Sherlock cry again. Leaning forward, he kissed him softly. "I know. And it would kill me to be apart from you for so long. But I can't accept money from you, not that kind of money." He rubbed a hand over his face. "I'll just have to figure something else out."
He managed to get away and searched the crowd for John, still unable to find him. He called out his name a few times before asking a couple people if they saw where he went. They pointed him in the direction of the house and he thanked them before running off to find him.
John looked up when Mycroft entered, but was immediately intimidated by the look on his face. He shrunk back as the elder Holmes yelled and tears formed in his eyes. "I-I didn't...I mean, I don't know...This has never happened before when he had an episode. Please, Mycroft, I would never hurt him. You have to know that." He felt so guilty already, but now he was scared of what his fiance's older brother would do to him, and he closed his eyes, tears spilling over.
John let his mouth fall open and stroked his tongue along Sherlock's. He wrapped his arms around Sherlock's waist so that he could clutch the other boy's arse and pull him in.
Sherlock's parents joined them shortly after they were seated. Sherlock's mother was dressed in a two piece grey tweed suit with a pink chiffon blouse and had her salt and pepper hair pulled back in a loose bun. His father was tall and slender, much like Sherlock was and his hair was completely grey. He was wearing a black blazer with a dark blue button down shirt and black dress pants.
John was watching Sherlock during the entire ride home with one eyebrow raised and a smirk. He knew what Sherlock was trying to do, so he decided to try to foil that plan. He scooted close on the seat and leaned over so that his lips were right up to his fiancé's ear. "Something wrong, darling?"
John cried out with each thrust as his whole body was rocked with pleasure. He looked at the mirror again, seeing that Sherlock was staring at them in the glass, and he found he really liked the picture of dominance they created. He pushed back to meet Sherlock, wanting him deeper.
John was glad to see Sherlock waiting for him at lunch and looking to be in as good of spirits as he was that morning. He sat with him once he got his tray and grinned.
John happily returned the kiss, murmuring, "I love you, too." against his lover's lips. He didn't even notice as Hamish looked back at Ms. Rodin, the faintest pink dusting his cheeks.
Sherlock smiled up at John with tears in his own eyes and pulled him in for another kiss. "And you're mine," he whispered and kissed him again. He grabbed John by the waist and pulled him down on top of him so he was straddling his hips. He kept their lips connected, swiping his tongue along the other boy's bottom lip.
Sherlock bit his lip and blushed as well, because whn John mentioned them falling in love, a lot of people in the court "aww'ed". Even the judge smiled at what John said. When he got to the part where Mary lured him away, Sherlock clasped his hands together nervously.
Sherlock swallowed as fast as he could, licking and sucking until John was limp in his mouth. The increased suction on his own cock brought him that much closer and as he pulled off he cried out John's name as he found his own release.
John kissed Sherlock deeply, wrapping his arms under him so that he could bring Sherlock up. Their fronts were flush together, his lover's cock pressed between their abdomens. With each movement of John's hips, he made sure that Sherlock got friction.
Sherlock walked to the witness box, taking deep breaths. The usher stood with him as he took the oath and soon he was seated. Ms. Rodin approached the stand and have Sherlock a small smile before beginning. "Sherlock, tell the court when it all started."
Sherlock whimpered and bit his lip, trying to stay as quiet as he could. It was becoming increasingly difficult to restrain himself from just crying out. He started whispering his lover's name like a prayer, bucking his hips up into his hand.
John kept thrust up to meet Sherlock coming down, and he moved his lips right next to Sherlock's ear. "You're so fucking hot like this," he breathed, knowing that Sherlock liked it when he talked during sex. "I love feeling you clenching around me. I love the way you say my name." He reached down to tug on Sherlock's cock, swiping his thumb over the slit.
John followed Sherlock inside and up to his room, then through to the adjoining bathroom. He slipped out of his trunks and stepped into the shower with Sherlock.
Sherlock shook his head, "no... John said... He cares about me, he... He's falling in love with me." Sebastian let out a loud laugh, "You hear that boys? Freak here actually thinks John cares about him!" The other players started laughing loudly along with Sebastian.
Mycroft nodded, "exactly. So, that's why it's so important that you follow my directions. I'm sure you probably understand now." He smiled warily at John and then back over at Sherlock. "I do care for my brother... and I understand him because I've been there. Of course, I never had to deal with quite as... damaging situations, but I did have my own."
John shook his head. "I'm fine. I don't want to stop." He smiled at the two Holmeses and then turned back to Ms. Rodin. "Please."
Sherlock let John go, but kept his face close to his ear. "Yes, John. I'm right here, I need you to wake up, okay? Just wake up for me, love," he murmured softly.
"I simply wanted to remind you that your birthday gala will be coming up soon. Next Friday in fact." Mycroft said, door still closed. "Shit..." Sherlock mumbled under his breath, "tell them I don't want one!" He shouted. "Now, Sherlock... It's your eighteenth birthday, do you really think mummy and daddy would agree to cancel this year?"
Sherlock smiled into the kiss and cupped his fiance's cheek, "I care for you more than anyone, John. And I will
Sherlock took a few minutes to calm down but when he finally did he pulled back enough to rest his forehead against John's, "sorry..." he murmured, "bad dream." He smiled weakly and reached up to wipe the remaining moisture from his eyes.
Sherlock mentally corrected himself. He could see the evil smirk on Sebastian's face and cringed as his leg reared back, ready to kick him in the gut.
"Then... he undid his trousers and pulled his... penis out. He forced my jaw open and told me to suck. When I kept my mouth closed... he nodded to the other rugby player, who came up behind me and put a pocket knife to my throat. I was so scared..." he whispered, still keeping eye contact with John and shook his head slowly.
John didn't know what to expect when Sherlock gave him that smile and in the next moment he was being lifted. He squeaked and wrapped his arms around Sherlock's neck, holding on as he spun them around. John laughed as he clung to Sherlock, nestling his head on Sherlock's shoulder.
Sherlock hugged John back just as hard and kissed every part of his face he could reach. "We did it..." he murmured, happy tears running down his face. Ms. Rodin smiled and took Mr. Watson's hand, "It was my pleasure. Always good to see a monster like that put behind bars." She kept holding Hamish's hand long after was necessary and finally let go with a blush on her face, "sorry.. um..." She patted both boys on the back, "you both did so well," she said.
Inside the room, John felt tears welling in his eyes again. He took the chair that was closest to the bed, gingerly taking Sherlock's limp hand in both of his and kissing it. And to think Sherlock had said this wasn't the first time he'd been like this. John closed his eyes and bowed his head, keeping hold of Sherlock's hand as if he might disappear if he didn't.
"Go ahead and start without me, I'll just grab us some clothes and change real quick," Sherlock said and smiled back at John. He pulled his shirt up and over his head, tossing it into the laundry bin.
Sherlock held John while he calmed himself down and when he got on the bike behind him, he hugged him tightly and kissed the back of his neck. "I love you," he murmured.
John couldn't believe the size of Sherlock's room. Even with the furniture, it was spacious, probably as big as the whole downstairs of his flat. He wrung his hands together as he looked around, in complete awe of everything. He felt so ridiculous now. Sherlock wouldn't want to be friends with someone who was so below his status. When Sherlock grabbed him, John couldn't even look the other boy in the eye. "It's nothing, I just..." He cast his eyes down further and flushed. "I'm not anywhere
John closed his eyes, trying to imagine that his hand was Sherlock's mouth. It wasn't warm enough, not wet enough, but it would do. "Fuck, yes...I would hold you in place and fuck your mouth so hard. And then I'd flip you over and I'd lick your arse hole." He squeezed himself harder as he stroked.
John made sure that he had everything in order. His gift to Sherlock was wrapped nicely, he had his mobile in his jacket pocket, and he had polished his engagement ring so that 'The Girl' would see it easily and know that Sherlock was his. He heard the knock and nearly jumped to the door, opening it to find Sherlock there in his suit. And his mouth dropped open a little.
John grinned, putting his face in Sherlock's neck. He kissed and sucked and nipped at his lover's pale skin, wanting to work him up before he touched him. To anyone who was looking, it would seem John was just using his husband for a pillow.
Sherlock groaned and let his head fall back on the pillow. He was shaking slightly from the anticipation of the pleasure he knew was coming. He continued to roll his hips down onto John's fingers, trying to get them deeper.
John nodded emphatically. "You should feel it from my end," he said with a lopsided grin. He looked down at the floor and grabbed the tie he was wearing before. "I think this is the best we can do right now," he said, handing it to Sherlock before slumping back again. He didn't want to move an inch. Actually he didn't think he could.
John kissed him back, letting Sherlock keep his movements going while he focused on what he was doing to his backside. He finally slipped a finger in, thrusting slowly in time with their moving hips. His other fingers teased around the rim of his entrance, and then he slipped in a second finger.
Sherlock sighed contentedly, glad the rumble of the engine drowned out the sound. He was almost sad when they approached his massive driveway, loathe to give up this closeness to John. As they pulled to the front of the mansion, he could see Mycroft peeking out of the window of the third story and hoped he would stay up there for the duration of John's visit.
Sherlock sighed and pulled away, "fine... If you insist." He stood and walked towards the door, calling out for Mycroft. Then he closed the door and 'accidentally' knocked off a cup of pens that was sitting on the table next to the door. "Damn," Sherlock said and bent over to start picking them up, making sure his arse was pointed straight in John's direction.
"Ohhh..." John moaned and pushed his hips onto that long finger of Sherlock's. His lover's words only added to the ache between his legs and the desperation for more. "Yes...Yes I love it. I feel so full with you inside me. You own me, Sherlock. Please, please fuck me..."
, John... If you were here right now, I'd put your thick cock into my mouth and take it in as far as I could, all the way to the back of my throat." He bit his lip and adjusted the phone so it was pressed between his shoulder and his ear, leaving his other hand free.
John whined when Sherlock pulled away and nipped at his bottom lip. "One day when we're completely alone..." He moved to grab Sherlock's ear lobe in his teeth. "I want you to fuck me so hard on this couch that I can't see straight."
John starting pumping his hands down as if Sherlock was doing the movement. "Yes, oh, yes! Oh, Sherlock..." He bucked his hips up to meet and tightened his hands. "I'm...using both my hands to pretend it's your-
No one was there to save him like he was for Sherlock, and he was way outnumbered. He struggled as much as he could, tears pouring down his face out of his control, but his head hit the ground one too many times as he was being punched and soon he was falling away into blackness.
John kept Sherlock's hand through the ride to school, and walking into the building. They were greeted by smiles and waves that John was still getting used to. He went with Sherlock to his first classroom and gave him a kiss before he left. Really, John didn't want to leave Sherlock alone. He had a bad feeling that he might start having flashbacks and if John wasn't there, no one would be able to snap him out of it.
John whined as the sudden cold hit him. "Bloody git. Fine, I'll get up." He rolled off the bed and stretched before smacking Sherlock's bare arse. "Too bad we don't have extra time. Taking a shower without getting turned on is going to be difficult." He walked into the bathroom and turned the water on.
Mycroft clasped his hands together and looked over at Sherlock, "my brother and I, and you may have already noticed this, are very different from everyone else." He quirked a smile, "we always thought of ourselves as turtles, with our brains being our shells. Whenever we feel threatened, we hide away, losing ourselves inside our minds. What made it different this time is that he ran away..."
John enjoyed the film, and by the end wanted to turn to Sherlock and start talking about it. But then he saw that his fiance was asleep and he smiled softly. Giving him a kiss on the temple, John scooped the other boy up and carried him back towards his room.
John returned the kiss, melting against his husband. The day had been perfect so far, and it wasn't over yet.
"What?" John didn't understand and he felt a bit stung. Had Moran and the others said something to Sherlock while he was gone? "I didn't do anything with her," he said, trying to turn his face to meet his eyes.
"Mmm..." Sherlock hummed in agreement and turned John's face to the side to kiss him languidly. "I love you," he murmured against his fiance's lips.
in the shower. That will have to be remedied soon." His eyes fixed on a drop of water running down the centre of John's back and he leaned in to catch it with his tongue.
John returned the embrace immediately, holding Sherlock close. "You don't have to keep thanking me, love," he said softly, pressing a kiss to the underside of his jaw. "It's what I'm here for." Though he didn't know exactly what Sherlock was thanking him for, he had a feeling.
John whimpered and clung to Sherlock's shoulders, digging his nails into the wet flesh. He was absolutely right; the scandal factor was pretty hot. He rocked his hips in time with his lover's hand, but the friction through his swim shorts wasn't enough. "P-please...more, Sherlock..."
It took all Sherlock had in him not to sprint the remaining few metres to join his fiancé at the alter, but he managed somehow. When he finally made it, he grabbed onto John's hands and squeezed them, giving reassurance as well as trying to get it. He smiled widely down at him and mouthed 'I love you' before the minister started to speak.
"I was so scared," Sherlock sobbed, still clinging to John. "I didn't... I didn't want to do it anymore, but he
"I know," John said, groaning softly as he kept moving his hand on both of them. "God...I just can't stop myself..." He rocked his hips, their cocks rubbing together in his hand.
John blushed furiously at Sherlock's deep voice in his ear. He swallowed as the other boy pulled away. "Sherlock... you don't make it any easier you know. You know just how to get me riled up." He stopped by his bike and turned Sherlock to himself, pulling him down for a rough kiss.
"God knows that's not one second too soon..." the judge said under his breath, nodding in acknowledgment to John and Sherlock before standing and walking out.
Sherlock moaned loudly at all the combined touches. His entire being was focused on how good his lover was making him feel and he could sense himself getting closer to the edge with each thrust. All he needed was that one extra something to push him over.
Sherlock walked them both to the table and let go of John's hand to pull out a chair for him. He took a seat next to him, his mother on his other side.
Mr. Watson didn't look fully convinced, but he shrugged a little. "It's been known to happen sometimes. He used to heckle his older sister from time to time until she chased him around the house and tackled him down."
Sherlock took the offered hand and smirked, pulling John's naked body flush against his own. "Mmm, that just means we get to be closer," he said with a wink.
Sherlock watched in awe as John's cock twitched between them and come spurted from it. The feeling of his lover's muscles clenching around him and the sound of him orgasming brought him to his own release. "
John took a deep breath. That conversation had made him so angry, but he couldn't get upset, not now. "He came up and asked me where Sherlock was, referring to him again as 'the freak'." He knew that the people in the courtroom would be even more sympathetic to them if he showed them how terrible Moran was to Sherlock when he hadn't done anything. "I told him that Sherlock was at home thanks to him, and he lamented that he didn't get to finish what he was doing." He was getting angrier with each word he spoke and he tried to get a lid on it.
Sherlock nodded and smiled weakly up at John's father, "yes, I suppose that's true." He kept a hold of John's hand and reached with his other one to gently brush John's hair away from his face. "I'm here, love," he said softly, tears running down his face. All he could do now was wait patiently for his boyfriend to wake up.
"I'm really sorry. But I want to introduce you to the boy I was with," John said, breaking away. That seemed the best segway into this. "Da, this is Sherlock Holmes."
John couldn't believe how hot this was. He wished he could get hard again, because this was perfect wank fodder. Sherlock writhing and moaning like this...
"I never thought I'd say this, but... thank goodness for my big mouth," Sherlock said and chuckled, nuzzling into the top of John's head.
John stood face to face with Sherlock, moving up a few steps so they were at eye level. "Hey," he said with a grin. He had thought that Sherlock would have swept him up and kissed him by now. But then he noticed the slight tenseness to his posture and he rolled his eyes fondly. "Come here, you." He pulled Sherlock into his arms and kissed him hard. He couldn't do this at home but he didn't give a damn what the people thought at school.
He gave Sherlock's hand one last squeeze before releasing his grip and standing up. With a deep breath puffed out through his cheeks and squared shoulders, John walked up to the witness stand and stood behind the gate. He could do this. For Sherlock.
"When you arrived back, was Sherlock fighting back? Was he trying to get away?" Helen asked, looking over at the boy in question for a moment before turning her attention back to John.
Sherlock leaned in and locked their lips together as he untied John's trunks. He slipped his hand underneath and started stroking him again. His tongue slid against the other boy's and he groaned as his hand moved along John's aroused flesh.
John twisted his hand on Sherlock as he started to pound harder into him. "You... Fuck, you are incredible." He started biting Sherlock's pale shoulder, leaving small marks everywhere his teeth went.
"I know, love," Sherlock murmured and grabbed a pillow. "Just think... once we're out of school and off to Uni... We'll never have to sleep alone." He snuggled into the pillow and sighed. It was a poor substitute, but what could he really do?
"Sebastian dropped the gun and ran," he said, voice still a bit choked. "And I called for an ambulance..." He pressed a finger to his own wrist, just to feel a heartbeat, pretending it was Sherlock's. "Then I held Sherlock...u-until he blacked out," John continued slowly. "I thought he had died." It was nearly a whisper, and he didn't know if anyone had really heard it.
John was glad to see the smiling face of Ms. Rodin on the other side of the stand, and he felt himself calm a bit more. He took a deep breath and began. "It was a Friday," he started, deciding to be as detailed as possible. "I had just moved into town a week before and I had joined the school rugby team. I was walking down the hall after class had let out and I saw the boys surrounding someone, so I went over to see what was going on."
John started moving faster, moving one of his hands down to stroke his own cock. He still marveled at the fantastic feeling of not having a condom between them. It was a bit more rough, but it really made them able to
John slept happily through the night and woke the next morning to the gentle caresses of Sherlock's lips. He smiled and kissed him back lazily when they finally landed on his lips, only to groan at the prospect of going to school. "Do we have to? I'm happy right here," he said, snuggling into Sherlock further.
John pouted a little as Sherlock got up and then started buttoning his shirt up. He stepped out with Sherlock, shaking his head a little as he watched him fumble with the buttons. "Let me," he said, and nudged Sherlock's hands away to start doing the buttons himself.
John thought back to that day, trying to remember what dumb excuse Sebastian had given him. "He said something like, 'Freak thinks he's better than us'. That's how he refers to Sherlock." He felt a flare of anger at the thought and squeezed Sherlock's hand again, perhaps a bit too hard.
"Hey..." Sherlock said soothingly and kissed the tears away, "it'll all work out, you'll see. He just needs some time to process everything. You can stay with me as long as you need to, don't feel like you're a burden, because you're not... okay?" He smiled lovingly at John and cupped his cheek, leaning down to kiss him softly on the lips. He wished there was more he could do, he felt so helpless and hated seeing John so upset.
John felt a bit better when he saw Sherlock smiling. At least he didn't seem too upset about John's stupidity before. He followed Ms. Rodin out of the room, immediately reaching out for Sherlock's hand as he was afraid he was in for an earful. When they got to the room, he flinched at the yell and flushed again in guilt. "I was under oath. I couldn't lie." He looked down at the floor, feeling ashamed.
Sherlock was about to say something back when saw someone in the hallway with them and froze... It was Sebastian. "What are you doing here?" he said through gritted teeth. Moran laughed, the sound of it causing shivers to run down Sherlock's spine."I thought I'd just pay you two a visit, see how you were doing," Sebastian said and grinned evilly.
Sherlock watched him with narrowed eyes until he closed the door behind him and sighed, "let's go back to my room," he said and pulled John to him, wrapping his arms around the shorter boy's waist, "I'd quite enjoy continuing where we left off," he whispered huskily and smirked. He kissed John softly on the cheek, "don't worry, though. Only kissing tonight," he reassured him and began walking down the hall to the stairway.
Irene raised an eyebrow, "oh really? What made you change your mind so quickly? You're only what... 17? You've hardly seen enough girls to make such an important decision." She smiled and cocked her head to the side.
like a dog." He leaned forward suddenly, tossing the other boy on the bed and following him down. Sherlock joined their lips in a firm kiss before letting him go and rolling off the bed. "Come on, I know you're hungry," he said and held out his hand.
"So the ambulance arrived and the paramedics were able to revive him," Helen said, trying to reassure John as well as continue with the story. "I have nothing further, your honour," she said and smiled at John again before taking her seat. "Your witness, Mr. Tabling," the judge said to the defence lawyer.
John felt guilty for not remembering these things, but he was certain that that was the last of the evidence that would make John look like the one who started it. "Then they all jumped on me and beat me unconscious."
"Sherlock pushed me away and got...hit instead. Sebastian ran off after that and I called for an ambulance. Luckily we made it in time and they were able to save him." John let one of his fingers trail to Sherlock's wrist, feeling his pulse, and it calmed him.
"John!" Mary ran towards him and tapped him on the shoulder, "a few people said they saw him running for the pool house, let's go check there." She led John over and opened the door, "Sherlock? Sherlock, are you in here?" she called out, walking through the house.
John carefully climbed into the bed, moving around the various wires hooked up to his boyfriend, and he laid down next to him, hugging Sherlock back. "It's okay. I'm right here, and I'm not going anywhere." He rubbed Sherlock's back, trying to calm him down.
John could tell Sherlock was getting desperate and he smirked, finally moving his mouth to his throbbing cock. He took just the head into his mouth, sucking lightly. He knew it would drive Sherlock crazy, but he wanted to see how long Sherlock could last like this.
John went back to Sherlock and leaned into his side, putting an arm around his waist. Mr. Watson smiled faintly at the two of them. "I understand, son. Like I said, if it were anyone else I wouldn't approve. But you have shown such love for my boy, even to the point of risking your own life. I don't think there is a way that anyone could keep you apart. Just promise that you'll keep taking care of him."
"Oh..." Sherlock gasped and was caught between wanting to buck up into John's mouth and push back onto his finger so he rolled his hips forward and then back, trying to let his boyfriend know that he wanted it all.
John kissed him back, leaning into his fiance's touch. "I love you, too." He laid his cheek in Sherlock's curls, closing his eyes. "Think we can squeeze a nap in before dinner? I'm exhausted."
"I know, trust me," Sherlock said and raised an eyebrow. He bent down slightly so John could reach the top of his head better and almost purred at the sensation. "Mmm... feels good."
Sherlock slipped out of his trousers and turned to face John, "Usually, yes... Although I don't really eat that much. Tonight was the first time I've had anything since... Hmmm... Tuesday?" He turned to grab a couple shirts from the drawer and turned back, still standing there in just his black cotton pants. "What size shirt do you wear?" he asked John.
Sherlock lifted a hand to John's chin, tilting his head back up to meet his eyes. "I still love you, John. I made some mistakes before we met, too. We've all made mistakes. I can't blame you for trying to fit in, I've tried to myself." He smiled and leaned up to kiss John softly on the lips.
," Mycroft growled. He looked over the boy in the chair, scared and vulnerable, and sighed. "Listen... I know that whatever happened, you didn't mean to do, but I need to know. That's the only way I can get him out of this." He spoke softer and grabbed a chair to sit next to John.
"I love you too, John," Sherlock whispered against his skin, "so much." He continued to kiss John's throat and face in between words, "I... promise... you... I... will... protect... you." He pulled back and looked deep in his boyfriend's eyes, stroking his face. "I will do anything,
John laughed, but there was no happiness behind it. "Me? You're the one who got shot." He cupped Sherlock's face, willing him to keep eye contact. "Help is on the way, Sherlock. Please, just...keep your eyes open," he choked out. It couldn't end this way, it just couldn't. They still had so much they were supposed to do together.
John ruffled Sherlock's hair with a grin. "Aw, my sensitive Sherlock," he said through a laugh. As Mrs. Holmes left, he grinned up at her. "I really love your mum," he said to Sherlock when she was gone. "She's so sweet."
John took a deep breath, trying hard not to bark at her to leave. Swiveling his stool around he grabbed Sherlock's hand while at the same time putting his free one out to shake Irene's. The hand with the ring of course. "John Watson," he said with an overly-bright smile. "Fiance is the correct term actually." He couldn't help lifting his chin a little in pride at his ability to use the word, especially to deter this girl from touching his Sherlock.
John let his hands travel down to Sherlock's waist, opening his belt and trousers and slipping them down. He pushed them off onto the floor and then pulled away from his lover's lips. When he saw the faint shine of tears in the corners of Sherlock's eyes, he smiled softly and kissed them away. "I love you, so much," he breathed." You're my heart and soul. My entire world."
Sherlock scrunched his nose up as John licked it and chuckled softly. He took a handful of cake and smashed it in his husband's face. He laughed at John's expression for a little while, then leaned in to lick the side of his face. "The cake is good," he said cheekily and grinned.
John was breathing heavily, trying to calm down before people started thinking he was having an attack or something. He looked at Sherlock and nodded lazily, a wry grin spreading over his face. "You are one bad boy, Sherlock Holmes," he murmured, catching his lips. "My turn now."
John could feel Sherlock's emotions in the way he was kissing, so he tried to channel his own back to him. He wanted to reassure him that nothing was going to separate them, and that he cared about Sherlock so much. John hated to see Sherlock so worried that he was going to turn around and leave. He knew that he had a lot of insecurities so it would take a while for him to solidly convince Sherlock that he was here to stay. But that was alright with John. He would keep trying until the end of time.
Sherlock nodded and squirted some lube out onto his fingers, then placed the bottle to the side. He grabbed hold of John's knee with his clean hand and pressed one of his slick digits against his lover's entrance, massaging the muscle until it gave way and he could finally slide his finger inside.
John whimpered, his head falling back in ecstasy. Sherlock knew just what to do to get him all worked up. He could barely speak through all the sounds the other boy was evoking from him. But he did managed a soft moan of his lover's name.
Sherlock wrapped his arms around John and placed a gentle kiss on his temple, rubbing his back until he was able to calm his breathing. "So beautiful," he murmured and smiled happily.
"I have heard the accusations... and the evidence. And I have come to a decision." Judge Riddle said, looking out on the crowd. "I find the defendant, Sebastian Moran, guilty of all charges. I hereby sentence you to whole life order, starting immediately..." The crowd cheered and Sherlock let out the breath he was holding.
