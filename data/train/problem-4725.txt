Don raised his eyebrows, not bothering to hide his skepticism. "Pretending for a second that I believe you, which enemy?"
SI would have been desperate without this deal, though, so Tony had shoved his unease to the back of his mind, smiled across the table at his audience, and done his level best to make explaining the data on various powerpoint graphs and spreadsheets sound vaguely dirty. He'd discovered long ago that anything could sound suggestive if you said it with the right intonation.
He fired his jet boots and threw himself at the control panel, ignoring the sounds of Doom struggling back to his feet and the screech of rending metal that was Steve or Thor destroying the final Doombot.
"James?" Sharon asked. She had one hand on the back of his neck, the kind of touch that spoke of intimacyx.
Steve shoved the memory of Tony huddled in a hospital bed, his eyes fixed on things only he could see, out of his mind, and resisted the impulse to give the downed man a good, hard kick in the ribs.
Hank had assured them all that this was supposed to happen, that the antidote took time to work, but after twelve hours of watching Tony sleep, Steve wasn't finding that particularly comforting. But then, Hank had less reason to worry.
Cap stared at the doctor, drawing himself up and folding his arms across his chest. "Tony can control electrical equipment with his mind. Think about how much damage he could do if he thought you were attacking him."
Tony frowned, clearly thinking about protesting, then sighed. "I can't just sit around doing nothing."
"I wore that costume, too." Clint sounded so indignant that Steve had to smile through his crushing embarrassment.
Cap and Tony had always been close, but they hadn't used to have quite so many silent exchanges of glances, or surreptitious little touches that they obviously thought no one else saw. When Cap and Sam exchanged in-jokes or old-friends-who've-worked-together-for-years short-hand, it was mildly annoying, but no different than watching Clint and Hank snipe at one another. When he did the same thing with Tony, it felt oddly uncomfortable, as if Wanda were seeing something she shouldn't.
As the police cars pulled away, Steve surveyed the wreckage of the Mansion's lawn and wriggled the fingers of his right hand as the numbness slowly faded from them. His shoulder was throbbing now, the heat of bruises already gathering under the skin.
Stark Industries' green energy research was now going to be carried out in partnership with the Department of Energy, with half the project's funding being provided by the American taxpayer. The government officials he'd been meeting with had been men he'd never seen before - not surprising, since for the first time, he hadn't been dealing with the DoD - and so they had been able to get directly to the business of the meeting, without having to spend a good fifteen minutes on the ever-popular topic of "oh my God, you really have been turned into a woman!" first. One of the Department of Energy scientists, whom Tony suspected hadn't been exposed to any media other than technical journals in years, had even called him "Ms. Stark."
"That's a nicely restrained summation, Mr. Rogers, but there must have been more to it than that." Ben turned to Tony, his eyes serious. "I spoke to you after Mr. Rogers' death, Mr. Stark. I came in to this interview expecting to hear that the two of you had been involved since well before that point."
"Tony?" he said tentatively. Tony might not have responded to the doctors, but maybe he would react to a familiar voice.
Tony was leaning sideways against the couch, hair disheveled and eyes slightly dazed. There was a dark bruise on his left cheek, which had been slowly shifting from red to purple over the course of the evening, and he visibly winced every time he tried to straighten up too quickly, but he looked more relaxed than he normally did.
"It's Dr. Strange," he said, his voice strained. "He says that he has Wanda Maximoff with him. He says she wants to talk to us."
Enough. Thor stepped to the side, pulling his reflection away from hers, and forced himself not to rub at his ear. Loki had bedded everything from giantesses to stallions in order to further her ends, he reminded himself. She was not truly interested in him, not in that way. Not like Amora. "Your friendship comes at too high a cost, stepbrother."
"You like  jazz," Steve pointed out.  He'd kind of been looking forward to this, to  the chance to go out somewhere with Tony, now that they were officially  together.
Steve narrowed his eyes, his gaze never leaving the center of Tony's body mass, and said, with dignity, "I decided to forgive you long before I started sleeping with you."
She drew her gun, stepped to one side to avoid the shots even a blind agent would know to fire at the open doorway, and kicked open the door.
"Right," Tony agreed. He picked up a small tool and made a few minuscule adjustments to a piece of circuitry. "Maybe if I add more shielding..."
There was nothing to be gained through timidity. "As you will no doubt plan to betray me," he agreed.
Sam borrowed Redwing's eyes for a moment, using the falcon's vision to look through the top floor windows. There was always a moment of disorientation when he did that, as the world came into sudden, startling clarity. He'd occasionally wondered if this was what it was like for nearsighted people when they put on glasses.
"It didn't match your suit." Jan smoothed his lapel, then gave it a little pat before letting her hand drop. "Navy blue doesn't go with black. And you make a very attractive doll."
Problems didn't go away just because you wanted them to. Eventually, you always had to accept that they were there, and deal with them.
"To remake the earth in his own image, preferably killing or enslaving everyone on it in the process." Wong said the words with faint disgust, as if he'd encountered entities like Chthon far too many times to be impressed by them any longer. "Unfortunately, he's powerful enough to do it."
"Don't feel sorry for her," Barnes mumbled into his hands. "She gets her jollies by torturing people. I should know."
His armor was dead again.  It must have shorted out when the billboards blew.  Steve fumbled with almost invisible metal latches, trying to find the manual releases, because Tony would be pissed as hell if he used his shield to smash them open again.  It felt like hours before he felt the first catch come loose.
The more recent versions of the armor were more powerful and offered more protection, but there were times when he missed the flexible metal he'd used in the earlier designs. The arms and legs of the armor had been cast in single pieces then, with no need for joints, and it had simplified the construction considerably. It had also made the suit lighter, which meant that it had
Tony had given up long ago on the idea of Steve returning his feelings - by the time he'd realized that what he felt for Captain America was more than just lust for his phenomenally attractive body, Steve had already started his endearingly ineffective pursuit of Sharon Carter - but part of him couldn't help savoring every touch, every bit of time he got to spend with Steve alone, just the two of them.
"I know," Tony groaned. "It was inexcusably stupid of me. I was... distracted that time. This time, I have no excuse."
"Clint," Carol said patiently. "When he brought me in from the airport, we were talking about my book, and mistakes all of us have made, like me and the jetliner incident, and Clint and Natasha, and that time Rhodey beat Tony up, and he told me a little about what he was doing right after he came back from the dead."
Steve's body was flush against his, radiating heat like a furnace, and he could smell the sweat on his skin, the clean scent of the soap he used. It made him dizzy for a moment, suddenly hard and ready to turn this sparring match into something else entirely – and then Steve jabbed him in the ribs with the elbow of his free arm, slammed a heel into his shin, and yanked himself free.
"You wanted to talk to me?" Tony asked, as he followed Wanda along the hallway to the kitchen. She trailed one hand along the wall as she walked, over the scuffs still left in the plaster from construction; it would need to be repainted once all the work was finished.
Tony's smile was real this time, crinkling the corners of his eyes, though the shadows under them remained. "I'll hold you to that." His eyes flicked over Steve's suit, and the smile turned amused. "What have you been doing to your tie?"
Still time to fix things. Steve's panic ebbed slightly, as he realized that Tony was right. Steve might have screwed up, but there was still time for him to do the right thing.
Pepper raised her eyebrows. "After six years of working for you, it takes a lot to surprise me," she said dryly.
He’d be very surprised if Hellrung hadn’t already heard it from Carol several times over, but just because she still resented him for stealing her boyfriend didn’t mean that Clint had anything against him.  He had never even met Hellrung in person.
“There’s no magical damage.  I wish I could fix the rest,” she nodded at the bandages covering his torso, “but I can’t directly manipulate reality anymore.”
was a slow poison on top of everything else. Steve took a final step, closing the gap between them, and laid one hand on the cool metal of Tony's arm. "You need to let the paramedics treat you."
Barnes leaned back in his chair, shoving the map away from him in disgust.  "Three quarters of a century, and I'm still doing Nick Fury's grunt work.  I'm more skilled and experienced than any agent on board this ship except Natasha — who I helped
"Then you might have bothered to tell me when you got pregnant, since it majorly impacts the process of changing you back. Not to mention that all the bloodwork I've already done on you is useless now." Every test Hank had run had indicated that Tony in female form was completely infertile; he shouldn't even have been menstruating or ovulating. Obviously, Hank had missed something vital.
Tony took a step closer to him, until he could feel Steve's body heat through his clothing. It was probably wishful thinking, but just being near him seemed to make Tony's headache fade a little bit.
St. Margaret's Cathedral was directly below them now, looking as benign as any of the hundreds of churches in the city. The tree planted in its small scrap of churchyard was already a winter-bare skeleton, giving Jan a clear view of the side of the building.
Tony shook his head, seizing on the distraction with, not relief exactly, but something close to it. "No. I'll be wearing a tuxedo or suit of some kind, whatever Jan decides to inflict on me. In black, not white, before you ask. She's apparently designing it to compliment Steve's mess dress."
There were forty-six new messages in his in-box. Tony scanned the titles, and deleted everything that wasn't from Pepper or Sal or marked "urgent." CNN and the other major news stations were mercifully free of footage from the Meridian now; naked pictures of a recent American Idol winner had surfaced on the Internet yesterday, and no one cared about Tony Stark and Janet Van Dyne being hospitalized anymore. The pictures, to Tony's semi-expert eye, looked photoshopped, but that hadn't deterred
"No," Sam said shortly, responding in kind. "There's no lift here; I'd need to climb something and jump to get airborne."
Tony's hands slid under his shirt, cool against his skin, and his touch was suddenly anything but soothing. "Of course not. I don't actually enjoy being in pain."
Thank God he hadn't gone to a SHIELD psychiatrist. Dr. Faustus had been able to program Sharon Carter into shooting Steve, despite being both his friend and occasional lover for years; she didn't even want to think about what he could have done to Hank.
"We're not discussing it. She's leaving." Apparently, Tony hadn't had his fill of working with manipulative scum who wanted to destroy them. One would think he'd have learned, by this point, that there were some people you didn't want to get into bed with, no matter what they threatened or how persuasive they could be.
Hank went obediently, stumbling slightly. He kept staring at Jan until Sam had yanked him out of sight around the doorframe.
The map's hundreds of tiny block and lot outlines blurred for a moment, and Tony closed his eyes, blinking them back into focus.  The fine print was almost dizzying, and trying to read it made him feel vaguely sick.
"Actually, he's six foot two," MJ told him. "I used to play pool with him. Luke Cage is a lot taller."
The fact that she’d nearly destroyed Times Square, and possibly the entire city, would weigh less with Miriam Sharpe and her supporters than their political agenda did.
“You need to get your head together. Got it. I kind of did the same thing for a while.” Clint could relate to that. He still had only hazy memories of those first few weeks after coming back. "That hat's too big for you," he added.
Everything between then and now was one long blur, only a handful of moments standing out with sharp clarity.
"You used to play pool with Captain America? For real? What does he look like under the costume. I bet he's hot, right?"
Hank tensed, clearly readying himself to shrink just enough to get out of his restraints and throw himself at Doom.  Jan shook her head, and watched with relief as he visibly forced himself to relax again.  Hank wasn't always good at subtle signals, and didn't always listen even when he was aware of them.
"Wanda!" Jan landed lightly on the floor, growing to full size as her feet touched the wooden floorboards, and rushed forward. "What happened?"
"Although... I could feel Wanda's power, when she threw hex spheres, and when she created that spell circle at Mount Rushmore. Maybe Chthon is hiding."
"Took Jan and Hank?" he echoed.  There really was a disturbing amount of blood covering Sam's costume.  He thought of Bucky's SHIELD uniform, the night Sin had caught him with her poisoned dagger, and of Sharon's face and hands covered in bright red blood, so much blood, all over her skin and clothes and tipping the ends of her hair when she bent forward and it brushed his face, and was that why Doom had needed to drain that man of blood like a slaughtered animal?
They had a security breach. Don changed course for the communications room, walking as quickly as he could.
Tony turned his face into Steve's hand, closing his eyes. He wasn't looking forward to three nights spent alone. "I don't know why it keeps getting up on our bed," he said. "It's supposed to be Jarvis's." The cat probably kept jumping up onto the bed because Tony had invited it up there, one night during the SHRA hearings when Steve had been far away in Washington and Tony had been unable to sleep. However, there was no way he was going to admit that, particularly not to Steve, who seemed to be involved in some endless, petty war with the cat, which had begun sleeping in his shield and gnawing on its leather straps.
"No," she hissed again, through gritted teeth, as her knees hit the stone floor. She could feel sweat breaking out along her spine, hear her teeth grinding together.
Hank wrinkled his nose ever so slightly -- he was of the opinion that all ice cream ought to be either chocolate or vanilla.
Steve wanted to say, relief leaving him almost angry.  Instead, he tightened his grip on Tony’s hand, and said, “You have one broken rib and one fractured one.  The spear sliced clean through the first one and nicked the second.  You were lucky, though – it didn’t hit your liver and only nicked your lung.”
Tony sagged back, defeated.  It wasn't fair; all he really wanted at the moment was to lean into Steve's side and close his eyes, or maybe just lay down, but he'd gotten used to not doing what he wanted  a long time ago.  "Fine.  I need you to send me all the data from the mansion's systems, and keep us" he jerked his head at Wanda, "updated on everything the rest of you are doing and anything you find out.  And I'm not staying here more than twenty-four hours, no matter what the doctors say."
Everyone seemed to be talking at once, then, raised voices overlapping and blurring into one another.
Steve took a step closer to him, until they were standing only inches apart, close enough to feel Tony's body heat and smell his aftershave and the faint metallic tang that the Extremis had given him. "They shouldn't have printed those pictures. The rest of the article was justified, mostly, but those were private."
Both men had substantial business holdings in both China and several African nations, and SHIELD had been trying to get the extensive arms and heroin smuggling ring they ran shut down for months through legitimate channels, with no success.
"What sex pollen?" said Clint, loudly enough that Steve winced and pulled the phone an inch or so further away from his ear. "Are you even listening to me?"
Rhodey snorted. "The next time you open a conversation with 'Rhodey, old friend, can you do me a favor?' remind me to say 'hell no."
Chthon had only a toehold here, but given time, given the weight of human minds and souls that would press into this church every Sunday and Wednesday to worship, unprotected and vulnerable to his influence, his power would grow, feeding not on their faith, but on their darker emotions – anger, fear, anxiety, despair, all the chaotic and disordered states of the human mind.
If this was Vision's preferred reading material, then it was no wonder he distrusted his own and other people's emotions. They needed to find him something where the characters didn't all have ulterior motives.
Given the deeds they had been willing to admit to, given that he already knew they possessed no honor, how much worse must these unknown things be for Hank and Tony to be ashamed to speak of them?
He brought his mouth down on Tony's hard, his tongue demanding entry, his fingers digging into Tony's arms.
It always felt like she ought to be banging a gavel on the table when she said that, though the current team line-up was much less prone to shouting fights and arm-wrestling matches in the conference room than some.
At a civilian hospital, he would have had to argue or beg to get the details of said surgery out of the medical staff.  Not here.
The cat, curled up on the back of the couch, rearranged himself with a creak of leather and settled back into position with both of his hind feet shoved into the back of Steve's neck. A slight prick of claws warned that he would be displeased if Steve attempted to either move or push his feet away.
“They’ve finished evaluating your teammate,” he said, to Carol.  “Ms. Maximoff is being allowed visitors now.”
Was it an impossible standard? She had been making progress, she knew, and she'd been certain that with enough work, she could attain the kind of control that seemed to come so effortlessly to Strange, regardless of the fact that her powers worked differently.
Steve frowned. "I wouldn't describe that version of your Wasp costume as 'half-naked.'" He felt a rush of quiet gratitude over the fact that they weren't talking about him, his costumes, or his past sexual conquests anymore.
"Like I said," Nick went on, as Steve took the paper and quickly scanned its contents, "we know she wants revenge. What we need to know is what she thinks she's doing, and who she's doin' it for."
Surely Strange had to know this was happening? A magical event of this magnitude taking place practically on his doorstep would be impossible for him to miss.
The blood still smeared across his shield decided him.  Whatever Chthon or the spear had done to Sam and Wanda, it wasn’t physical, and it wasn’t going to kill them in the next few minutes.  It couldn’t.  Not when there wasn’t a mark on them.  Tony, on the other hand…
With all this weight on his shoulders, Steve never left room for relationships to made a priority. That was, until he met Peggy. Margaret Carter was a strong character, with a spirit filled with kindness. He quickly found himself enamoured by her presence, and – for the longest time – believed that she was the love of his life.
At least, that’s what he told himself, despite the fact that he is currently standing opposite Stark Tower, trying the will his legs to move forwards, but to no avail. He’s too afraid. What will Tony say? Will he even recognise Steve? Will he have him kicked out? Deep down, Steve knows the answer to the questions at hand, but he’s not exactly packed with rationality at this very moment.
His lover releases a soft chuckle, that never fails to have Steve’s heart stop every time he hears the beautiful sound.
The one who’s life drained away right before his eyes, after saving the world without a moment’s hesitation.
"We better," Tony said. The armor's mechanically synthesized voice sounded nearly the same as always, but not quite. Jan wasn't sure she would have noticed it if she hadn't been on a team with Tony for years, but it sounded slightly lighter, as if the voice it was distorting were higher pitched than before. "I have a board meeting next Tuesday."
"Positive," Tony forced out, through gritted teeth. He hated having studio make-up artists poking at his face and messing with his hair every time he had to appear on television for something, and the past twenty minutes had been almost as bad.
He set the earring carefully on the bedside table, then reconsidered and tucked it in his pocket where Patton couldn't get at it.
He had a point, but still... "Maybe you and Beast should talk to the rest of the X-Men before you publish any of it, just in case. Or to Jan. Or anyone who's not each other, Tony, or Reed Richards."
The main nurses' station was nearly deserted, probably because of all the poisoned people, but he managed to catch a blonde woman with a clipboard just as she was leaving. "Excuse me, ma'am, could you tell me where Tony Stark and the other Avengers are?"
"What happened the last time you guys met?" Tony asked, as he spun sideways in midair to avoid Atlas's giant fist.
Tony swatted Steve's hand away and glared up at him.  "I forgot for five seconds during an emergency situation while I was half conscious," he snapped.  Purple and grey sparks flickered at the corner of his vision for a moment, and he blinked them away.  "Sue me."
When he heard Jarvis's voice coming from around the corner, he winced again, and considered slapping a foot over the biggest scratch.
Call SHIELD, then.  And Strange, to warn him that they'd lost the book.  Maybe he'd actually be able to do something about it this time.
Tony was buttoning his own shirt back up when Steve arrived, fingers on the button one down from the top. He was a lot... smaller.
Steve nodded. "It looks like it's been infected for days, and it took too long to get it to stop bleeding."
"That's... pretty accurate," the doctor admitted. "Mr. Stark's vital signs are steady, and his pulse is elevated -- all of the victims' pulses are elevated -- and the EEG shows considerable brain activity, which is a good sign under these circumstances. We haven't figured out why he's non-responsive, but it's not unique. Several of the victims are; the ones that aren't trying to stab themselves or the medical staff."
The trio wait with bated breath, as they witness Steve’s form disappear. It takes an entire second for Banner to comes to his senses; pressing unknown buttons with his working arm.
“What? Want me to polish it for you?” Sam chuckles, never once taking his eyes off the enticing gleam of the sun reflected off the surface.
Steve thanks the man; moving over towards the few chairs they have in the lobby, in case of days like this where the place is heaving with visitors and busy workers.
“Was the endless rambling in that memory?” The other smirks, prompting the blonde to rolls his eyes in adoration.
He can’t think of anything more perfect than standing next to his short lover in the home that they escaped to after the first incident in New York. Witnessing Tony risk his life, all over again – especially after he died right before his very eyes when he defeated Thanos – was almost too much for Steve to handle, yet he let it happen since he made a promise to Tony; he’d help against Loki, but then he’d destroy the suits so he could live out the rest of his life with Steve.
Yet, something was preventing him from taking that first step. Tony had Pepper, and Tony might not believe that Captain America – who turned up in his building out of the blue – would want to be with him. At this time, the two are complete strangers. There’s no way that he would believe a word Steve says, and will call Fury to have him sent to a mental asylum.
No, Peggy wasn’t the one. His heart beats for someone else; the one who questioned his every word, the one who turned down his authority, the one who awakened Steve’s naïve mind to endless knowledge and possibilities with a mouth fowler than that of a drunken sailor.
Banner looks at the object in his hand, nodding in agreement with the strange request, as the couple stand together – wrist pieces synced up and ready to go – when Bucky decides there’s something he needs answering.
Sam’s eyes widen, looking between Steve and Bucky as he tries to comprehend the words. The long-haired brunette gives a pleased nod of confirmation, whilst Steve takes his place beside Tony once more; their hands linking together out of habit.
"I could do much better than just erase your checking accounts," Tony said, after a long moment of silence.
It hadn't been the source of the training he'd objected to, but that fact that they hadn't had a choice, and that there had been no way to be sure of what the government planned to use them for. And recruiting children was... Steve frowned, and shrugged, uncomfortable now. "I was twenty-one when I signed on for it. I was already an adult. I've seen what happens when you put kids in costumes and send them into war zones." He wondered sometimes what Bucky would be like if he'd had a chance to have a normal childhood - he'd had that taken away from him long before the explosion.
Wanda was shaking her head, eyes still on the book. "Not hear," she corrected Sam, the words quiet. "Feel. Everything else in here is just art, or old scientific instruments. This book has real magic in it." She shivered visibly and rubbed at her arms, and for a moment, Steve thought he saw glints of reddish light play over the tattoos on her hands and the back of her neck. "Chaos magic. Dark magic. Chaos can be a joyful and creative force, but whatever's in this book is destructive, malevolent. Like he is. It's..." she looked back at the book again, hesitating, then looked away, "it wants to be used. I can feel it waiting."
"Stark said you'd say that." Sam shook his head, and stepped forward into the room, reaching gently for Steve's arm. "He knows you better than I thought. Here, let me see. Where does this thing fasten?
The quinjet lowered itself slowly onto the mansion's lawn, grass flattening out around it from the force of its exhaust, a slight wobble to its motion that meant that Tony wasn't flying it.
The emergency room was a little less crowded than when Clint had first come in -- the car crash victims had been seen to, and several of the people with the flu were gone, too. They'd probably taken one look at the huge crowd of potential poisoning victims and given up and gone home.
Jessica and Simon had been the first of Carol's lovers in a long time whom she could allow herself to get a little rough with, whom she didn't have to worry about accidentally hurting, but there were more ways to hurt someone than simply leaving too many bruises during over-enthusiastic sex.
"Maybe I should have," Peter said. "Maybe I was just being a wuss and ignoring my responsibilities. Reed and Tony didn't hesitate."
"Am I supposed to be intimidated?"  His mask was just as expressionless as Tony's faceplate, but it seemed even less human, despite the open mouth slit and the glimmer of his eyes visible through the eye holes.  "I grow tired of you."
Tony touched one finger to the little white plaque. "John Dee," he read. "He was fascinated by angels and demons. He spent years trying to contact angelic powers; he wanted to ask them questions about theology and natural philosophy."
The police arrived several minutes later, and looked less than pleased to see Hyde; this was, after all, his third arrest in the space of two months, if the aborted escape attempt Steve had halted a couple of weeks ago counted.
"Which means she's probably performing it now." Steve had shifted into a combat stance, his weight on the balls of his feet and his jaw set with familiar determination. "We need to track her down and stop her."
"You've had people mess with your head before," he said, after a moment. "And, well, let's just say you've gotten around."
"I hope so." The assistant curator shifted her grip on the manuscript box, grimacing slightly, then added, "I'm skeptical about this 'curse,' but the exhibit has been plagued by bad luck since it began, and one of our conservationists swears that it whispered to him when he tried to assess its condition. He's not usually a man given to superstition."
He took a deep breath, trying to nerve himself up. The thought of what he was about to do wasn't as frightening as he'd expected, though the circumstances could have been better.
Steve had just managed to wrench his hand free and duck another of Doom's punches — unlike last time, he'd managed to avoid being either hit or blasted thus far — when the man's cape began to writhe and twist, snaking up to wrap around Clint's neck.
"One would hope." One of Jarvis's eyebrows twitched. "Tony had several suggestions for improvements to it. I managed to dissuade him, however, so it should still be safe to use."
This was the dark secret Hank and Tony had concealed from him, that their actions had actually been motivated by more than lust for scientific knowledge and base treachery? That made no sense. Why conceal that which could serve to justify their actions?
"An accident," Steve agreed. "Which wouldn't have happened if you hadn't been fighting him to begin with."
One of the SHIELD medics – a woman who looked vaguely familiar – was prodding at Clint’s torso and checking his pupils, easily thwarting his attempts to prevent her from removing his mask.  Her partner looked as if he were preparing to strap Clint to a backboard.  Surely that had to be just a precaution.
He wasn't angry anymore, just tired, his head aching from the aftermath of too much emotion. "That went well, don't you think?" he asked Tony.
She could come back later. It would give her a chance to shower, change clothes, relax for a while after hours of flying. She could sit around with Jan and rant about exes who thought they knew what was best for you and were distractingly sexy when they were angry. Jan had dated Tony once, so she ought to have experience in that department.
"Actually, I've been meaning to talk to you." Pepper waved at one of the chair by the desk, adding, "Why don't you come in?"
There were moments when Steve doubted that, but saying wouldn't do any good. Neither would getting angry, which was impossible anyway when Tony was touching him that way.
"He still hasn't let me see the other three Star Wars movies," Steve said absently. The New Avengers had argued about that once, Tony and Peter insisting repeatedly that there were only three real Star Wars movies, and watching any of the others would be sacrilege.
Wanda had turned slightly to face him, giving Clint a view of her profile. Any moment now, she was going to notice that he was in the room. Then he would have to say something to her. "I didn't know mind-control was covered at all."
"Oh, would you mind?" Wanda set up straight, feeling a rush of something almost like relief. She couldn't discuss her worries about Tony and their lack of progress in breaking Loki curse with Strange or Clea, not when Strange was already quietly but visibly irritated at their inability to break the spell. It was woven closely enough into Tony's body that simply snapping it by brute force might hurt him, and of course, now that Tony was pregnant, any further interference with the spell that kept him bound into a female body was out of the question until the pregnancy had been safely ended.
Tony nodded, and did his best to squash the panicked little part of his mind that was already wondering what he was going to do if they couldn't. How was he going to explain this to the media? To Pepper and Happy and Rhodey? To his date tomorrow night?
Replacing the men who had been guarding the warehouse would be yet another inconvenience.  Better to allow them to return to Latveria with him first; it would be easier to dispense justice without American law enforcement interfering.
"Norman Osborn?" Peter guessed hopefully. Fate was never that ironically kind to him, but a guy could dream.
Either Tony had been desperate to get to New York as soon as possible, in order to spend as little time as possible as a woman, or Clint had been really, really desperate to get rid of them. Or both.
How could they have been so stupid? That first time in the gym, and then in Tony's lab, he should have- he'd assumed that the fact that the supersoldier serum made him immune to most viruses meant that they would be safe. Tony had insisted on protection after that, but only as a formality, because it 'feels wrong not use anything. I always use protection, Steve. The last thing my public image needs at this point is a paternity suit.'
Jan shook her head. "I wasn't drinking for that. I was drinking for the picture they took when I was dating the bass guitarist from Urban Camouflage."*
, he'd said carefully, and the deliberate phrasing had been a red flag that while Tony might not have been ordering assassinations, someone else might have been.
Sam grinned. "Well, that's one way to do it. I always hated those things. I swear they put up more of them every year."
"I know what you mean," Steve said, with feeling. "And no. They're still refurbishing it. Very slowly and carefully. They've been slowly and carefully refurbishing it since 2001."
"I will skin her slowly," Doom muttered to himself. If SHIELD did in fact possess the Dee manuscript, they would guard it all the more closely now that Sin had so spectacularly tried and failed to seize it from them.
Hank had nearly gotten the entire team killed before he'd snapped out of it. Tony had nearly gotten himself killed before he'd managed to snap out of the drinking.
"Just being back here helps. I hadn't realized how much I had missed this place. I ought to have come back here before, not gone to Magneto."
"I'll  go put on a shirt that doesn't have oil stains on it," Tony said,  making it sound like the concession it was.  Disheveled and  grease-stained was a good look on him, and he knew it.
"I was just... there are tests I have to run. So I was, um, running them." He was babbling. He always babbled when he tried to talk to Jan, these days, even over the safe distance of a commlink. Once, he had been more comfortable with her than he'd ever been with anyone.
It wasn't entirely true — Red Skull, from what Tony understood, had been a far better strategist than his daughter — but those also weren't the only options. "If she's spending a lot of time around powerful sources of chaos magic, she might be hearing anything. The security guards at the museum said the manuscript she tried to steal whispered to them."
He would apologize to Clint later, Steve decided. Right now, he was going to go down to Tony's office, on the off chance that he'd already arrived and gone directly there. And given that Tony's employees seemed to need him to hold their hands for everything, it wasn't impossible that that was exactly what had happened.
"Little?" Hank started to grow, the size change surprisingly fluid considering that as far as Tony knew, he hadn't done this in over a year. "You're the one who's been running around calling himself Goliath, aren't you?" he snarled. "Let's see how you hold up against the real thing."
"Two of my exes are runway models and one is a designer." Tony's voice was wry again. "I avoid fashion week."
Tony’s eyes blinked open, dazed blue slits.  It took him several seconds to focus on Steve, but then his lips curved in a smile.  “Oh,” he said faintly.  “The world didn’t end.  Good.”
— and you," he waved a hand at Sharon, "and he's wasting our time with this.  Someone in the Latverian embassy has to know where Doom is, and those who don't probably know who does.  At least one of them has to be willing to talk."
J.J. Jameson would throw a screaming temper tantrum, but Steve wouldn't have to be the one to listen to it, so at the moment, he couldn't bring himself to care.
Tony  was talking to the bartender, and only someone who knew him very well  would have been able to read the discomfort in the set of his shoulders,  and the way he kept looking away.  A tall, blonde woman in a very  low-cut dress was standing next to him, leaning towards him with one arm  resting on the bar, which was probably calculated to give someone  standing where Tony was a perfect view down the front of her dress.
Putting her hands over her ears or trying to shake her head to chase Chthon out wouldn't work.  The wards on her hands and neck itched and burned, like tight bands over her skin, and as she and Tony drew closer to Times Square, a dull glow began to seep through the back of her gloves.
Sin slid the edge of the knife gently along his skin, almost a caress.  "I think I'll send your head to Carter and Barnes in a box.  Rogers', too."
Tony shrugged slightly. "So I'm going to have to try not to use it for anything but running the armor for a few weeks, until we figure out a solution. I know this is a bad time to have me running at less than full capacity," he went on, not giving Steve even a moment's pause in which to respond, "but we got by before I had the Extremis. I can function just fine in a fight without it. I won't be able to monitor data from the cathedral or the NYPD or anything else continually like I've been doing but that's what we have Hank for." Another practiced smile, and his fingers tightened gently on Steve's arm before letting go. "Maybe it'll even keep him busy enough to stop walking around muttering to himself about genetics and Nobel prizes; working on the storage unit for the book kept him out of trouble for a couple of days."
Sam was beating at the symbiote with his wings and free hand both, yanking violently on the tongue still wrapped around his wriSt. Steve punched it in the kidneys, a hard jab that Tony could tell he pulled only slightly, and it howled, but kept its hands firmly locked around Sam's throat.
The nearest monitor screen showed Clint rolling his eyes in high-definition close-up. "Forget the tests. Cap's not down here right now to kick your ass, so Jan and I are going to have to do it. She can run a basic level training simulation just as well as you can."
Hank had insisted on bringing over the entire contents of his lab at Stark Tower himself, claiming that he didn't trust anyone else not to screw up the calibration of the equipment, drop his shiny new three-dimensional molecular modeling unit on the floor, or burn or poison themselves with his supplies. Tony hadn't argued, even when Hank had brusquely turned down his offer of help, as well as his offer to recalibrate the lasers in the modeling unit to produce a greater degree of precision; he could empathize with Hank's reluctance to let other people interfere with his equipment. He'd only enlisted Hank's aid in moving a few piece of his own workspace because there was no way to get the anti-gravity hoist for working on quinjet engines out of Stark Tower's basement
Harkness waved one hand, as if swatting a fly, and a tendril of blood-colored smoke lashed out at Jan, knocking her out of the air.
"I kind of went looking for Wanda, and then I found her, hiding in this little town, with amnesia, and kind of, um, left her there. After sleeping with her." Clint mumbled this last bit in a rush, still intent on the widening hole in his jeans.
Tony's shoulders, seen from behind, had a relaxed set to them, no sign of the tension that had been there this morning. For all that Steve had hoped to get him to rest and recover from AIM's poison, a chance to play with the War Machine armor would probably do him almost as much good as actual rest.
Tony loved him, and now he knew that Steve loved him  as well, and if he wanted to lean against Tony in public, or put his  hand on Tony's thigh or his arm around Tony's shoulders, he could.  So  he put one hand over Tony's, on top of the table, and squeezed it  gently, and slide the other onto Tony's leg, just above the knee.
What if he stayed trapped inside his own head, with whatever demons were in there with him, forever?
Doom would be waiting at the other end of the teleport, there to rant at her for her failure. Let him; she would have other chances, and the more he treated her as like an idiot child, the more he would forget to watch for treachery. Burning him alive after she obtained the spear was going to be very satisfying.
It wasn't the time to debate this; not now, not while they were both exhausted. "You could have hurt someone," Steve admitted, hating to give Tony's guilt more fuel but unwilling to lie, "but you didn't. You saved people's lives," he repeated, letting some of his frustration leak through. "You know you did."
"Take heart, my friend," Thor said, clapping Tony on the shoulder again. "At least your child will be human. I'm sure he or she will be a most powerful warrior, as well."
"I'm not helping, am I?" Carol asked. She sighed. "This sounds awful under the circumstances, but it's been nice being back in New York. The LAPD isn't really sure how to deal with superheroes, and all those riots didn't help. Plus, half the people on the street see superheroes and SHIELD as some sort of auxiliary to the cops after all that riot control Jen and Ares did, so they're not disposed to look on us kindly."
Pounding Atlas into the ground had been deeply satisfying, though. Payback, Hank supposed, for the time he, the Man-Ape, and Ultron had trashed the West Coast Avengers' headquarters. Hank had been basically useless, then, letting Tony fight the three of them on his own until reinforcements showed up.
Ben nodded. "I imagine they didn't. Mr. Stark said you'd been involved since shortly after the Helicarrier was blown up last spring. That was immediately after your return from the dead. Did that-"
"Hello, Morgan," Tony said, giving his cousin a bright, false smile and not bothering to disguise the contempt in his tone; he hadn't bothered to pretend there was any real affection between them since the second time Morgan had lent his assistance to a supervillain trying to kill or discredit Tony. Morgan had displayed a distinct lack of concern when Stane had taken over SI, had in fact fallen all over himself trying to suck up to him.
"Didn't seem important," Steve repeatedly, slowly, his voice very calm. His jaw tightened. "What if you'd panicked and hurt someone? What if that gas had been poisonous, and there'd only been a limited amount of time to give you an antidote? You passed out inside the armor." His voice increased in volume as he spoke, the facade of calm crumbling until the least few words were almost a shout.
Loss of control wasn't something Tony seemed to cope with well - control over his sexuality, his body, his company, his technology. Over, well, everything.
Mojlnir lay on the floor several yards behind her, transported along with him to a spot just close enough to be taunting, but far away enough to be completely out of reach.
She'd already asked about Pietro, even though just the thought of what Strange might say had filled her stomach with a sick, hollow pain, but he had been able to tell her nothing, offering only the vague reassurance that Chthon had probably not been able to possess him the way he had Wanda, and that he'd likely been able to influence him only while he'd been in close physical proximity to her. Did her brother still have his powers? Had he been one of the lucky ones who'd been spared, or one of the people her spell had destroyed? Even if he had been, it didn't mean—his powers might have been restored last night, when she had ended the spell. His mutation was primarily energy-based, like hers, like Magneto's. It had been the people with major physical mutations who had died, and the mutants with flying powers who had been airborne. Unless Pietro had been running over water. He did that, sometimes, just to show off, or for the sheer joy of running as far as he could without needing to slow down.
Steve had also been secretly sucked in, though he hadn't really understood some of the jokes; there were times when it was easy to forget that he was from another time, and then there were times like that, when you remembered that he had missed the entire cold war. Steve...
Over Tony's shoulder, she saw Byrne enter the restaurant and exchange a few words with the maitre'de, who gestured at their table. "Put your game face on. The press is here."
He ought to be; they had been lucky today, despite Tony's slip-up. No one had been seriously hurt, not even the people affected by the toxin. A.I.M., unfortunately, had used a timed smoke bomb to release the formula into the air, so they'd been denied the dubious pleasure of helping the police arrest Headcase twice in one month, but compared to A.I.M.'s last poison gas attack, this one had been easy. Should have been easy, if he hadn't been so tired, hadn't let himself get distracted.
"What?"  Peter asked.  He'd just essentially announced that he knew what Matt  slept in.  Surely none of them could actually think…   "I only know what  he sleeps in because there was this one time when we'd been fighting  Tombstone and Matt had broken ribs and a concussion and I was helping  him get ready for bed because he's blind and stuff and the concussion  was screwing up his bat sonar thing."
listening," Clint said, with a kind of accusatory triumph. "Loki's the one who turned Tony into a girl."
Sin was lying limply in the center of a ring of shiny, half-melted asphalt.  Sam was still down, and Clint, and Tony… god, Tony.
Loki, for once, ignored him. "Traitorous witch!" he shouted, stabbing one finger angrily at Harkness. "We had a deal! You've been planning to stab me in the back all along, haven't you?"
"I didn't think there was any point," Steve said. The paramedics closed the ambulance's back door, shutting Tony away from sight. "We were fighting. If it was me, changing those codes would have been the first thing I'd have done." The problem was, even when things had been at their worst, Tony hadn't thought of him an enemy. Steve couldn't say the same about himself -- he
"I'll see you in the morning." Wanda turned to go, then hesitated, adding, "Between myself and Bobbi, we should be able to put together a full set of clothes for you. I'll leave them outside the door to your room."
"We  could always go home, and I could put the shirt with the oil stains  back on," Tony said, glancing over to give Steve a suggestive smile.
He started to roll back to his feet, and Steve kicked his legs out from under him. "The police have this entire building surrounded," he said. "You're not getting out of here. Why don't you drop your weapons and come along like a good wannabee Nazi thug?"
Thank god Wanda and Chthon hadn't used those particular memories against her. They could have, so easily. If the whole thing had gone on a little longer, another of Marcus's dopplegangers might even have shown up, drawn there by deliberately created bad luck and altered chance.
Steve had always been able to beat Tony in unarmed combat, but previously, Steve's only real advantage had been skill and training. It hadn't exactly been a fair fight, but it had been close to one. He hadn't truly thought about the difference Tony's new smaller size would make, or rather, he had thought about it, but only in terms of how it would affect Tony's fighting abilities, not how much easier it would make it for Steve to seriously hurt him.
The feel of Tony's body pressed against him was like an electric shock, jolting Steve into an awareness of what, exactly, he was doing.
"Isn't that the city councilman who wants to ban feeding pigeons?" Sam's voice was dry. "You think we should go rescue Tony?"
He reminded himself firmly that however much Harkness might look like a fragile old woman, she was actually a powerful sorceress who was trying to kill them all, and fired twin repulsor blasts at her.
"I'm just glad you called someone at all," Steve told him. He couldn't think of anything else to say, couldn't think of how to tell Tony that he could always call him. He wished he
Foreign governments became difficult to work with when one was required to murder their officials, and while Doom would hopefully soon be beyond the need to worry about such petty details, that happy hour had not yet come.
"I could have told him that," Hank said. "In fact, I think I did." He sounded more like his old self than Steve had heard him sound in, God, almost two years. Was it being in a lab, surrounded by people he felt comfortable around, or the fact that he had used his size-changing powers again without losing control and without disaster striking?
What kind of lens and development technique had the photographer used to get that good a resolution in dim light without a flash? Peter would know, he thought.
In the armor, as he'd demonstrated more than once since returning to New York, that didn't matter, but he couldn't always rely on the armor.
So he was letting it drop, Steve guessed, waiting for Thor to slowly come around when he saw Tony being a good teammate, trying to work with him, and generally not being a mad scientist. Try hard enough, be smart enough, plan well enough, do things right, and success was inevitable – it was virtually Tony's motto, along with the assumption that if he wasn't successful, it was his fault for not foreseeing whatever had gone wrong and preventing it.
Regardless, he wasn't going to miss the opportunity to boost circulation with front page pictures of Captain America's wedding, and neither was any other major news outlet. It was enough to make Tony seriously consider eloping to Vegas, except that a) Steve would refuse and b) Jan and Jarvis would both kill him.
Neither of them spoke for what felt like a very long time. Clint stared at the patch of wall just above and slightly to the left of Wanda's head. She wasn't looking directly at him, either.
"I think this may be a subtle message that normal people work from nine to five, not eight to seven, and you should consider leaving earlier today." Pepper was examining the PDA again, but Tony could hear a faint hint of satisfaction in her voice, and wondered who's idea the early reservations had actually been.
Steve  could feel his face heat.  He still wasn't used to the idea that they  could mention that they were together so openly and casually.  Ending  the secrecy had been Steve's idea, but it was still… new.
"I suspected that you were avoiding me, but I didn't think you'd actually tell Pepper not to let me in." Steve sounded slightly hurt.
Tony's bizarre obedience lasted just long enough for Steve to get him out of the shower and dry. Then he began insisting that he ought to leave.
"I'd say you were lucky," he said. "There's no permanent damage from your ordeal. As far as Dr. Pym and I can tell, you're fine." He smiled at Wanda, and at Clint, over Wanda's shoulder. "Your brain patterns are normal, your blood work is normal, the genetic scan shows no alterations. You've lost about ten pounds, but that's not surprising considering the circumstances. I doubt Chthon bothered to feed you that often."
Loki stared first at Doom, then down at his hand where it touched hers, staying silent just long enough for Doom to begin to fear that he had overstepped. Then she met his eyes, a cruel smile on her lips. "This plan of yours has merit, Victor von Doom. You have ambition, you lust for power. And, of course, you plan to betray me and rule alone." She leaned down, until her lips were inches from his mask, and purred, "I like that."
Did he remember being dead? Or had he just stopped being at all, after Odin had severed him from Thor, and come back when the Big Guy did?
"What were the two of you doing in the Helicarrier's morgue that you had to turn the cameras off for?" Clint sounded far too interested, his eyebrows raised questioningly. He hissed as Sam elbowed him in the side, and took a step away from him. "I was trying to lighten the mood."
They all wore little nametags on their lab coats, slips of plastic-coated paper with the logo of their imaginary shell company stamped on them. No SHIELD badges or insignia, but they were branded with the enemy's mark as surely as those who wore SHIELD's uniform. They took SHIELD's money, worked to further its goals, and shared in its guilt.
"I'll understand if you can't be together with me anymore," Tony blurted out. "Now that I'm a man again. I'm not going to force you to try and have sex with me like this, not if you don't- I know you love me, but if you're not comfortable with-"
Hank pushed himself to his feet, moving like a badly controlled puppet, and staggered over to the controls for the energy grid.  He half-collapsed against them, fumbling with something Don couldn't see, and then the energy grid flickered and vanished, along with Jan's cage.
Carol didn't – in fact, she made an effort to shut the front door as gently as possible, before flying away to find something acceptable to hit.
Steve's eyes went automatically to the smooth, unmarked skin of Tony's chest, though he knew that wasn't what Tony was referring to; they were both missing a lifetime's worth of scars, now, and while Steve occasionally missed the small imperfections he'd grown used to in his own appearance – the scar where he'd torn his knee falling off a fire escape as a child, the smallpox vaccination mark on his arm that no one who'd grown up in today's world had – he didn't miss Tony's scars at all. "No," he said, willing it to be true. "You won't."
"Tony is... all right, isn't he?" Steve asked, as it belatedly occurred to him that he hadn't even stopped to wonder about Tony's wellbeing in all this. Who knew what kind of effects a physical change that drastic could have on someone?
Steve was dead. Had been killed while she waited obliviously in Transia for orders from the thing that controlled her. If she had been there...
"You know we're not doing that anymore," Rhodey said, and the irritation was clear this time. "We were barely doing that in the first place; the trainees were only to be sent into action as a last resort." He frowned, and paused for a moment, adding, "I'm pretty sure Baron von Blitzschlag was trying to set up some kind of under the table black ops program with some of the recruits, but he's gone now, and I can personally assure you that none of those kids are going to do anything more dangerous than put out forest fires in Colorado until they're eighteen. Trust me," he looked up at Steve, meeting his eyes directly, "there's already been one lawsuit, and we don't want to give any more parents a reason to sue us."
"There wasn't as much negotiating as you might think," Jan told him. "When it came right down to it, Steve Rogers just wants the same thing we do, to keep people safe."
"This isn't about principles," he said shortly, blue eyes boring into Tony. "This is about not relying on people you know you can't trust."
She hadn't thought about who her American tourist might actually have been, hadn't wondered about the life he'd had before appearing practically on her doorstep. Hadn't thought about his dead friend one way or the other.
Actually, it might, but pointing that out would be even less helpful than Hank's morbid predictions.
He knew the others didn't trust him out in the field anymore, not until he'd proven his ability to handle the stress of superhero work and stay stable, and rubbing it in wasn't necessary.
"I think I can manage that." Tony's voice was still completely devoid of animation, but Steve thought there might be a flicker of wry humor there. He turned to look at Don and Hank, giving Steve a view of the back of his head. "Thank you. Both of you. For, um, letting me keep this out of a hospital and therefore out of the press."
From Jan’s expression, she had already heard this explanation, and didn’t like it any better the second time around.  Even scaled down, her face was eloquent.
"Two months ago, that's what we all thought about Tony," Clint pointed out. You didn't just write your friends off, not if there was still a chance that there was anything left of them. "We've gone crazy or gone to the dark side before, some of us. Hank got so bad he had to be kicked off the team, and he ended up in jail." If Hank could fix things enough that Jan could forgive him, then there had to be something Clint could do to make up for this. There had to be. If he'd actually done anything. "Natasha started out working for the bad guys. There's that time Rhodey flipped out and had to be taken down by Tony. And, hell, there's you and Tony, with the drinking, both of you came back from that."
'No more mutants,' taken literally, could have completely halted evolution, going by what Sam remembered from high school biology. Or erased most of the human population from existence — just about everybody had some kind of mutation, from blue eyes, to sickle cell disease, to cats with six toes.
All the giant electronic billboards blew at once, the noise swallowed by the painfully loud scream of sound that seemed to come from inside Steve’s head.  He jerked his shield arm up automatically, and then—
She was around Sam's age, with well-defined muscles in her arms that probably came from hauling manuscripts around, and mid-toned, coppery skin, and had shown no sign of Dr. Thomas's tendency to talk down to them all. Between himself and Hank, Sam had gotten the better end of the bargain.
Tony swore.   Of course it had felled Strange; it had done so before.   They should have planned for this.
He'd only seen Tony look that utterly broken twice; once in a nameless hotel in the Bowery, when he'd been trying to commit suicide with a bottle, and again in the security camera footage of Tony's 'conversation' with his body.
They were rebuilding the mansion, rebuilding the team, but if Tony wasn't there to do it with him...
Chewing through the vital circuitry inside a Doombot's head and torso was a suicide job, but a colony's soldiers were expendable to a certain degree.  They went willingly, trusting Hank's assurance that the Doombots were a threat to their nests, and, incidentally, filled with something good to eat.
Wanda shrugged slightly, feeling faintly guilty for no logical reason. "I know," she said, "but he's helped me gain more control. I needed that. Still need it," she corrected herself. Strange's ritual magic was more formal than the magic she was used to - her hex powers had always been much more intuitive, coming as they did from a mutation rather than years of study. Learning the principles and methods of ritual sorcery had increased her own control over her hex power by a measurable amount, though.
He'd always tried to use charm to turn business negotiations to his advantage, even in the very early days when he'd still been figuring out how to do it successfully - eye contact was key, but it had taken a while before he stopped having to remind himself of that - but somehow, it had felt slightly uncomfortable this time, in a way it never had before.
Thank God for the internet; he could do a good two-third of the work he usually did in his office while sitting right here in his lab at the Avengers Mansion. Some of the board members and prospective large-scale customers might be irritated that he'd emailed them back instead of calling their cell phones or secretaries as requested, but an email was vastly preferably to no response at all, and he hadn't been off the radar for long enough for people to get suspicious yet.
"Because a couple of months ago, you and Tony were barely even talking to each other, and now you're getting married," Sam said, and kicked Steve's foot out from under him, releasing his ankle just in time to let him fall flat on his back. "And that's not even touching the part where he started out as a guy."
Rhodey frowned. He wasn't making any move to come further into the room, as if he felt he didn't have any place intruding. "I'm so tired of doing this," he muttered.
Sometimes it even worked. Maybe this would be one of those times – maybe Thor would eventually come around as Tony proved to him that his apology hadn't just been empty words.
Steve didn't say anything, but his jaw tightened a little; Clint wasn't exactly his favorite person at the moment, either, though knowing Steve and Clint and the way their perpetual contest of friendly one-up-man-ship worked, he'd get over being annoyed fairly quickly.
"You should be aiding me, brother," Loki spat, snatching her cloak free.  "Or do you wish to see what should belong to Asgard in the hands of Chthon?"
He was already sitting upright, one hand pressing at the ache behind his eyes, trying to wake up enough to focus on what the mansion's systems were telling him, when the building's intruder alert went off.
"I think Steve can handle you arguing with him," Jan was saying. "It's good for him. And accepting Loki's help isn't out of the question as a last-ditch solution, but I don't think things are that desperate yet."
"I had one last-" Clint started. Don gave him a look. He could be almost as intimidating in this form as he could when he was Thor. "Right. Tetanus shot."
One of the benefits of having a significant other who gave more money to the Metropolitan Museum of Art than many people earned in a year was that the dinners, special exhibition previews, and private showings that museum sponsors were invited to generally included a 'plus one.' That was, for significant others who were free to broadcast their relationship to all and sundry without ending up on the front page of every newspaper in the country, and probably a few international ones as well.
Steve had missed sparring like this. The two of them had practiced together on and off for over seven years now, ever since Tony had first come to him and asked for lessons on how to defend himself, since his "bodyguard" had been framed for murder and Tony had handed the armor over to SHIELD. If Steve hadn't already been almost certain that Tony himself was Iron Man before that first lesson, he'd known it without a doubt by the time it was over.
Tony dropped his guard, lowering his fists, and actually rolled his eyes. "Yes," he said. "Now you have a hundred pounds of muscle mass on me, instead of just fifty. Come on, you've always been stronger, faster, and better than me at this, and you always will be. It's not like the ability to kill me with your bare hands is something you've only just now acquired."
Tony was barefoot, holding a pair of black, strappy shoes in one hand. He - she? - was wearing a slinky black dress that fell to just above the knee, its high collar covering his chest but leaving his entire back bare.
He sat up straighter, then slumped forward and leaned his elbows on his knees again when the position failed to be any kinder to his bruised ribs and sore shoulder than his previous one.
Thor shook his head, and remained standing, his hands folded behind his back. "I was not hiding," he said primly. "I was seeking out my treacherous kinsman in hopes that I might be able to induce him to reverse what he has done to you."
"I've always wanted to be able to do that," Tony said, sitting across Steve's hips and smirking down at him. "You're right; it is fun." Then his eyes narrowed. "Did you let me do that on purpose?" he demanded, leaning forward menacingly and setting one arm across Steve's throat.
"No," Strange interrupted, holding up a hand to cut her off. "You cast the spell while possessed by Chthon, with his power amplifying your own. To completely undo it, you would need to channel Chthon's power again."
"I said I'd dance with you somewhere public," he went on. "How could you think I'd want you to lie about us?"
Tony, eyes still closed, turned his face into the touch, and Steve realized suddenly how close they were standing. Tony was only inches away. All he had to do was lean down a little and-
Steve was standing in the doorway now, his shield in hand. From the look on his face, he was about to throw Loki's offer of 'aid' back in her teeth. Don beat him to it.
And while the Avengers might present a united front to supervillains and to the media, under the surface, the damage done during the fight over Registration still lingered.
Clint's hand didn't waver.  "The last three robots didn't do so well against it.  For all I know, you're a robot, too."
"Agatha is chasing me," Wanda blurted out, slapping with both hands at her long, full skirt, which was smoldering faintly in several places. "She tried to drug me. I don't know how far behind me she is."
Moving automatically, she sprang forward and planted one foot on Loki's cloak, pinning it to the ground with her weight, and kicked at the dagger in Loki's hand.  The knife went skidding across the street, and Wong snatched it up, immediately turning to slam the blade into the joint of Doombot's shoulder.  It sliced through the metal as if it were cheap tin, as easily as Wolverine's claws.
Clint's usually bright costume was dull grey-violet with dust, and his gloves were scuffed and torn — he'd been pulling people out of the rubble under the fire fighters' direction despite not being trained for it beyond the usual superhero's basic knowledge of rescue techniques. She forgot, most of the time, that he had no powers, not even Steve's minimal healing factor and enhanced physical performance. Clint never let the fact that he was eternally outclassed by almost everyone around him slow him down.
He was a fraction of a second away from contact when a bright flare of light whited out his vision; it snapped through his body like an electric shock, the hair on his arms standing on end, and then he slammed hard into a female body too tall and solid to be Sin's.
Doom hit the ground with a clatter of metal on asphalt, but he kept his grip on the spear.   "Too late," he mocked, rising to his feet and kicking the shield out of the way.   "I should apologize to Sin.   It appears she did her job after all."
"We need to drive him out of there," Carol muttered, low enough that Jan wasn't sure she was intended to hear it. "Get rid of him. Maybe we
Sam nodded at one of the ambulances, and Steve turned to see Tony, strapped to a stretcher with an oxygen mask over his face, being loaded onto it.
He was sitting on the floor in the far corner of the shower, back against the wall and knees drawn up to his chest, his head resting on his folded arms.
"All right," Clint said, pouring himself another glass of soda, "so who's turn is it now? And can I just point out how lame it is that we're playing a drinking game with diet soda?"
“Don called in.  Hank’s in stable condition at the Bellevue Hospital Center.  And Hill says they’re having Spiderman and Luke and the others brought up to the helicarrier.”  She dropped into the chair next to Steve’s, waving at him to sit down as well, and stretched her legs out in front of her, wincing a little as she straightened the injured one.  Carol had a lot of leg to stretch out, most of it bare, but no one in the infirmary bay gave her so much as a second glance.  “It’s a good thing Chthon was more focused on his end goal than he was on killing them.  It sounds like he just bulldozed through them and didn’t look back.  Or Sin did.”
He took it off manually, not using the Extremis, and let the gold under-armor drain back inside his body. He didn't want to look at it.
That actually almost made sense. It was disconcerting when magic made sense; the fact that it sometimes followed logical patterns and sometimes didn't was even worse than if it were entirely random, because what logic it did follow couldn't be relied upon.
The blonde throws a quick glance towards Tony, before he’s unzipping the bag and dragging out his famed blue, white and red shield – crafted by the one and only Howard Stark. He gives it a content look over, running a gentle hand over the smooth metal, before offering it to Sam.
Well, if Sam wanted to play rough... Steve didn't even bother to roll back to his feet; he simply thrust one of his legs between Sam's and brought him down that way, then lunged for him. "You know that doesn't matter to me," he reminded Sam, once he had him securely in a hammerlock.
He tried the override code again, despite knowing that it was useless, and forced himself not to panic at the idea of Tony slowly suffocating inside his helmet because Steve hadn't been able to figure out how to remove it.  The Extremis wouldn't let that happen.  Tony had stopped breathing for over half an hour once and been fine afterward.
Sam could have shot him, but he wasn't sure what exactly the Doombots' weapons did to human flesh.  The level of damage they'd done to the walls, floor, and ceiling gave him unpleasant visions of fist-sized holes burned through muscle and into bone.
The armor, Tony decided, could wait. "Sorry, Shellhead," he murmured to the half-completed pile of parts on the workbench and floor. "I'm afraid you come in second this time."
"Why do you think so many magical artifacts are made of gold? I've never thought about glass, though. The crystalline structure in most gemstones amplifies and focuses magical energy, but glass isn't really a crystal."
"Fine. I will." Wanda stepped aside, pointedly moving out of the path to the door. "Don't break the door on your way out."
Don wasn’t sure what Thor had been planning to do with her if he’d been able to drag her back to Asgard in chains as he’d hoped to.  He wasn’t sure Thor knew, either.  After the destruction of the Ragnarok, he’d been unwilling to kill another Asgardian, and for all that Loki herself had rejected the label, Thor still thought of her as an Asgardian.
"They were probably just too polite to say anything," Tony told him, smirking. He put one hand on the small of Steve's back, steering him toward the banner that proclaimed
It struck Steve suddenly that he was kneeling on cold tile while Tony sat on the floor of the shower with water running over him, and that this probably wasn't a normal way to have a conversation. It probably said something about his life that it didn't seem unusual.
This one had been taken at the museum showing the week before last, a close-up of himself and Tony. They were standing only inches apart, Tony frozen in the act of smoothing down Steve's tie. "Steve Rogers and Tony Stark share an intimate moment at the opening of a Metropolitan Museum of Art special exhibit," the caption read, but the words, and their implications, were unnecessary. The picture alone was damning enough.
"Damn it," Steve swore, his hand dropping back to the bed. He grabbed a fistful of the sheets, crumpling them between his fingers. He had no idea what he was supposed to do.
Tony still had a small red mark on the side of his neck, left over from earlier this evening.  It was the only visible bruise on him.  Steve brushed a finger over it, reassuring himself again that he could feel Tony's pulse, slow but steady.
The lost time hadn't alarmed him then, unimportant in the face of everything else; it was only looking back that he could see how fucked up he'd been.
She gave him a long, level look. Peter glanced around warily, making sure everyone in the vicinity was looking the other way, then held out his right hand and sent a thin strand of webbing at the corner of her clipboard.
"She's what?" Steve frowned, and half raised one hand toward his shoulder, reaching for a shield that wasn't there. "How do you know?"
He should have had the spear months ago. Would have, had Strange not thrust his overly-long nose in where it was not wanted. If he did not have it by the equinox... The dark forces would not be aligned properly for another seven years, after that.
"Steve!" It was Jan's voice, something about it sounding strange. "There's some kind of airborne toxin in here. Everyone's going crazy. Panicking. I don't know." She was speaking quickly, almost babbling, voice shaking. "I- Oh God, we can't use force, they're civilians. And I'm compromised. Just- send someone." There was a shrill, drawn-out scream in the background, and the communicator cut off abruptly.
He could hear the ring of Thor's boots against the floor and felt the edge of Steve's shield brush his armor as the two of them drew even with him, blocking Doom's exit from the vault.
When she'd confronted him, he'd sneered at her and said that they had two other Avengers and Wilson's capture was immaterial to their goals.  "To your goals, Victor," she muttered, "but not to mine."
"I'm not acting any differently than I always do." He hadn't been, had he? On the other hand, Rhodey was an attractive guy, so maybe Tony had been flirting. He'd been trying to break the habit in Rhodey's case, but it had been an automatic reflex for a long time.
Out of all of his teammates, Hank Pym would be the one he ended up chained up next to.  Don sighed, and rested more of his weight on his bad leg, trying to take some of the pressure off his arms — his arms and shoulders were starting to ache almost as much as his bad knee, but anything was preferable to the sickening pain that came when he put any weight on his injured leg.  "I'd really rather not find out, since it's my soul, too."
This was all... Clint felt like he was missing parts of the conversation. They'd both been mind controlled, she was sorry she'd slept with him, she wasn't sorry she'd slept with him; she'd wanted to, she hadn't wanted to. He tried asking about one of the parts he was mostly sure of. "So... you don't want me to leave the team, then?"
The center of gravity for the armor was off again, not to mention the internal dimension. They'd needed to be scaled down slightly to accommodate the loss of five inches in height. Now, all the modifications Tony had made needed to be undone.
"You can run it after you eat," the Wasp interrupted. "Tony has many admirable traits, but that thing where he locks himself in his lab or a machine shop for days on end without eating or sleeping isn't one of them."
The thin place in the dimensional barriers was no longer confined to St. Margaret's - it surrounded Sin now, and the tentacles of energy were stretching through it, almost solid.   One of them was reaching out toward her, pulsing with dark energy like a heartbeat.
"That... wasn't what I was worried about. Well, until just now." The possibility of 'coming back wrong' hadn't even occurred to him. Clint shook the thought off; it was better to not to wonder exactly how Wanda had brought him back, especially since she herself couldn't tell him. "I was kicking the cat out of Tony's work room and found this." He fished the crumpled and ragged-edged piece of paper out of his pocket, and held it out to Don. "It's some kind of prescription scrip. Is it something we should be concerned about?"
Strange took a step forward and allowed the Cloak of Levitation to float him gently down to the street below. Behind him, Daredevil climbed down the building façade like a cat-burglar, dropping the final ten feet in an acrobatic jump that would have done an Olympic gymnast proud.
Steve had missed Tony while he was gone -- he kept thinking of something he wanted to say to him, or needed to ask him, and then remembering that he wasn't there. It was like reaching for his shield only to remember that he was wearing civilian clothing and didn't have it with him.
"No." Carol turned a page in her book, not looking up. "I think it's hiding somewhere. I haven't seen it since yesterday."
"I believe I've said this before, but you are meddling in forces beyond your control."  Strange's disembodied voice seemed to come from everywhere at once, and then he and Wong stepped through the flames behind Doom and Loki, Strange's cloak billowing and twisting around them, untouched by the fire.  "The power within the spear will incinerate you," he continued.
Sin jerked abruptly, her knife blade thankfully pulling away from his skin, and for one brief moment Sam thought that Jan had gotten loose and come at her from behind, or that Hank had come too again and summoned more ants.
