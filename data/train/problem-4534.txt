For all the bouncing around the country he’d done as a kid, Dean was fifteen the first time he’d seen the ocean, and there was always something frightening and enthralling about the expanse of it, the limitless horizon.
“Dean,” Cas says again, softly this time, more gently than he’s said anything to Dean since the night he walked out. “We have eleven hours and,” he checks his watch, “forty-five minutes. We don’t have time.”
“I’m sorry for what I said, too. With the siren,” Jack says, his voice getting stronger as he goes. “I didn’t mean it. I don’t believe you want to hurt me.”
“Are you staying?” he asks, and holds his breath.
“No!”
Sam sighs. “You know there are caveats to that, right? You’ll be okay if you don’t hit your head again, or break your leg, or put too much stress on your knee. You walked away from that, and nobody was real sure how.” He pauses and swallows hard. “We don’t have to kill ourselves for this fight anymore, wasn’t that the point?”
“This is an afterlife, Dean. They don’t die unless someone kills them, and they’re the alpha predator here.”
Dean barely has time to react to Cas calling his name, before the creature is on him, all horns and fucking teeth. At least they’re apparently smaller than urban legend would have it. He’s on the ground, trying to wrestle out from underneath it when Cas gets a hit in with the knife and draws its attention, giving Dean a chance to fumble for his gun.
“My grace is fading anyway,” Cas says, "it doesn't seem to matter whether I use it or not. Might as well be
Well, there’s no time like the end of the world.
Castiel takes a step forward, close enough to touch. He wants to touch; he always wants to touch, but it’s an even more intense desire since Purgatory, as his grace gets weaker.  As time gets shorter. “Dean. He made me promise not to. He’s determined to go through with it, if it’s the only way.”
“Did he say that?”
She finally says, “I don’t...think I want to get involved.”
“I’d forgotten,” Cas said.
. He knows Cas does, but not what that
Oh he did, did he? Dean’s looking forward to his future of obsessing about what
Dean nods and drops his forehead against Castiel’s shoulder, tightening his grip.
. I can hold my own as well as you can.” He shakes his head, looking to the side and not quite meeting Dean’s eyes. “I made sure of that,” he says, more quietly. “You don’t have to worry about me.”
“Not talking much. Embarrassed. But he’ll be ok.” Then he clears his throat, answering the unasked question. “He didn’t sleep with her.” Dean lets out a breath he didn’t even know he was holding, flooded with relief. That would have been...well, he doesn’t want to think about what that would have been.
Sam sighs, and drops his head, probably so Dean won’t see him blinking away the wetness in his eyes, though it’s definitely there.
They both start using Kennedy, Eileen’s mother’s maiden name, and that’s weird to get used to, but why shouldn’t they? Maybe the Winchester family curse breaks if Dean’s the end of line.
Castiel looks away. Dean's right. It is unfair. But the harm is that Dean won’t believe there’s another way, and Castiel doesn’t want to fight.
, Dean” every time Dean asks how he’s feeling.
They get through about two days of business as usual. That is, they get through two days of finding bupkis, before Dean declares that if Sam and Jack get a break, so do they.
They don’t really talk about what’s next until Cas forces the issue.
Seeing Cas out of layers always knocks Dean back a step, and he feels particularly unprepared tonight.
“Cas,” he gasps, clutching at Castiel's shoulder and trying to push himself into a sitting position before flinching and dropping back onto his back with a groan.
They step through the portal, the quick static shock of if giving way to the sharp chill of Purgatory. It's colder than Castiel remembers, but he should have expected that. He’s come to understand angelic grace as a kind of insulation that dulls physical sensation and creates a half-step remove from human emotion. He’d thought he was pretty in touch with his feelings, for an angel and all things considered, but now, with what’s left of his grace flickering like a candle flame, everything from cold to emotion to the passage of time feels dizzyingly personal and immediate in a way he hasn’t felt since his brief brush with humanity.
Dean will take that. “No, you stay here and wait for Sam and Eileen. You’re probably still a magnet for those Leviathan bastards; I can stay under the radar on my own. Sam has Rowena’s books; he may be able to figure out how to keep the rift open longer if we need it.”
“Some kind of contagion?” Stevie asks.
It hadn’t been any kind of a choice at all.
“I mean, not tomorrow. I figure eventually you gotta get back on the horse, right? Just...carefully.”
“Yeah,” Dean says, and turns back to the window, though there’s nothing out there except the occasional blur of headlights cutting through the downpour. They’re in a motel in the middle of fucking nowhere, in the dark, in the desert rain, Jack and Cas in one room because Jack won’t even look at Dean, and Sam and Dean in another, left to ponder how they’re both too broken to even let a fucking siren get close. It’s probably supposed to be a metaphor for something. Shit.
They hadn’t heard anything from or about Chuck in over a month. Billie was radio silent. It was one case, to blow the dust off. One standard, run-of-the-mill monster case to maybe feel something like
“I thought you knew,” Dean says, still quiet, but his voice echoes in the stillness.
Dean loves the bunker, but sometimes he’d give anything for a window to stare out of, for something to look at besides the walls, or Cas, or this room Cas has somehow, at some point turned into something comfortable and homey. Fuck it, they’re doing this. He gets up and paces to one corner of the room and then whirls around to look at Cas. Cas is still sitting on the bed, watching him steadily with wide, questioning eyes.
“I don’t suppose we can just look for a Leviathan cemetery, huh?” Dean asks.
“I’ll try not to.” And he means it - they could both stand to be more careful. He didn't survive literal hell multiple times, God, Lucifer, demonic possession, and all the rest of that shit to get ended by a teenage poltergeist in Utah. That's just embarrassing.
Right. Because the “we” in the last half of that statement was Sam and Eileen. Still weird.
That’s...probably not good. But it was a routine case, Dean’s still in pain, and Castiel's grace is tapped out. A defiantly optimistic part of him is hoping that by morning he’ll also be rested enough to finish the job and get Dean fully back on his feet, though a larger part of him isn't sure he's fully coming back from this one. He feels like an emptied out husk.
Cas glances at him sideways, wide-eyed and caught, and then gestures to himself, chagrined. “Celestial being. Super hearing. We
Everybody’s human. Everybody
Dean’s still clinging to him a little, just as tight, shaky where he stands, and it’s so clear to Castiel now, everything he missed, years thrown into sharp relief. He’s not sure how he missed
“I don’t know.” He’s been trying not to think about it too much; they'd had bigger problems. Though now he has to admit it's one of the big problems; he knows that his grace fritzing out in the middle of a fight could end up being a significant problem all on its own.
Dean meets Cas’s eyes in the mirror and says, “I think we should get that looked at.” He waits for a protest, for the accusation of being overprotective. If it was him, he wouldn’t bother. If it was Sam, he still might not bother, and Cas no doubt knows that. They have access to antibiotics in the bunker that would probably take care of any infection, but he doesn’t like the heat coming off of Cas’s skin or the sweat starting to bead at his hairline.
“Never.”
, that he somehow claimed for himself in spite of all the cards stacked against them, he owes to Cas and he gets that now, fundamentally, with a bone-deep clarity that is settling in over the shock.
. It had taken him a hunt on his own and a week of sitting by a river with a fishing pole trying to meditate to sort out the threads of that.
Dean says what they’re both thinking, when Castiel takes down the werewolf standing over him and pulls him to his feet.
What? Like, Dean can’t salt and burn a ghost on his own?
Also, Dean has no idea how to answer that loaded question. He sighs, pushing his plate away from him. He thinks about Cassie and Lee and Lisa and Cas; how they were all so uniquely complicated. “It’s exciting in the beginning; something just clicks into place with a person and you know they’re important. But then it’s about someone knowing you - like,
okay?” he asks, easing himself down on the side of Cas’s bed next to the table. Cas starts, and looks up at him, a little caught. That’s still weird too. Dean never really used to be able to startle him.
He was never certain, before, if time passed the same in Purgatory as on Earth. Even with angelic senses, he’d lost so much sense of time in the endless sameness of the days. Dean had complained of the impossibility of telling the time by the angle of the sun with the way the hazy, directionless daylight seemed to fade in and out. The days never shortened or lengthened, and the temperature never changed except for the added chill at night. It hadn’t really mattered then, but it matters now.
“Cas is just worried.” Dean doesn’t know why he’s getting defensive.
Cas looks up at Dean sharply. “I don’t...think I can really tell Jack how to be human when I haven’t figured it out myself. If he wants to hunt, he will. I’d rather he was trained and with people we trust, wouldn’t you?”
Stevie is suddenly very interested in whatever is on her phone.
“Thanks, Alan,” she says without looking up when Dean enters. Alan backs out of the room.
“Dean,” Cas starts, but Dean waves him off and heads for his room, the DVD credits still playing.
“I just mean…”
“For what?” Dean asks, cautiously, and Jack looks at him, a little disbelieving. Dean’s pretty sure he learned that expression from Cas.
Sam and Jack come back to the table right before the food comes, and then they distract themselves with eating to make the awkward silence less noticeable.
“Should I talk to him?” Sam asks. “We’ve been there. I know it can feel...violating.”
Well, jokes on all of them, because hodags are real, it turns out. Who knew?
Castiel edges closer to him out of that protective impulse he’s never really able to bury, especially not on a hunt, and especially not
“Yes, but it’s a clumsy analogy,” Cas says. He’s touching Dean now, fingertips light on his wrist, trailing up his forearm. Dean closes his eyes against it and breathes. “Really, I compared knowing you to revelation. To seeing and understanding the full complexity and beauty of the world for the first time. To being able to
Cas nods. Dean closes his eyes and sees Cas letting go of his hand at the portal; Cas stepping out of a different rift, glowing ugly against a night sky in Washington, with an angel blade in his back.
Cas hovers around him as he gets to his feet, and Dean can feel Cas watching him as he limps back to the car, a low ache in his right hip that he knows is going to turn into a nasty bruise over the next few days.
There are other things angels aren’t supposed to feel.
Jack nods, thinking. “And you want to sleep with them.”
“Hey, Sammy,” he manages to croak out trying to push himself into sitting position, and then slumping back on the pillows when he’s hit with a wave of dizziness.
Dean interrupts him with a squeeze at his hip. “No more talking.”
They make sure no one with blood on their hands touches George Anderson’s body before it’s cremated, and they send the kid with Stevie back to the bunker and Rowena, when he seems willing to go.
. The thrill seekers I can forgive for some stupidity, but how did you guys not know that?”  She’s just looking at them, a little lost, and great, now everyone is bewildered.
So it’s like this: He loves Cas completely, but also enough to let Cas make his own decisions.
Dean swallows. “Morning. Vampire hunting?”
“Yeah, I’m not sure what we would have done with him, honestly.”
“Because it’s out of your control? Because you still don’t think you’re worth sacrificing for?”
Dean can’t sleep and he finds Cas reading in the library. They sit in companionable silence until the sun comes up.
Dean pulls Cas over to where Stevie is still watching from the hallway. “What’ve you got, Cas?”
He should be asleep too; this fragile, human body needs it. But that’s the thing about returning from oblivion. Sleep doesn’t hold much appeal.
There’s something nagging at him too, worry for Cas, and a weird layer of guilt over how much he doesn’t want to go back to the bunker and whatever it is Sam is building there that’s objectively pretty great but that Dean just can’t seem to fit himself into. He thinks about just staying gone, for a while, and that’s weird too. Dean’s never been the one who leaves.
Both let down and relieved, Dean just nodded and took the whiskey when Cas pushed the glass back toward him.
They’ve got their hands on him, holding him back and pushing him to his knees. Years of mistakes come rushing back. The apocalypse. Heaven. Leviathan the first time. Naomi. Jack.
Once Dean has managed to stand on his own, he insists he can shower on his own and limps off toward the bathroom. Castiel gathers the rest of the spell ingredients together on the table - that’s for tomorrow, hopefully with Sam and Eileen back and Dean and Castiel both somewhere closer to fighting strength.
“You can’t be serious,” Cas growls, jaw hard and eyes flashing.
Jack is looking down at his plate, pushing a pancake around in a puddle of syrup. “What does it feel like? Being in love for real?”
says. Of course she does. Sam goes to tele-therapy twice a week now, so that’s a whole thing.
Cas goes home with a woman from the bar. Dean did not anticipate this, though maybe he should have.
“Nothing is funny,” Castiel says.
They haven’t done this since...well, since before everything went really bad. The last time, they’d had Mary and Jack here with them. Dean swallows hard and takes a sip of his beer, blinking against the sudden sharp pressure in his eyes.  They are
And then Dean and Cas are alone in the bunker for an unknown length of time, which Dean probably should have given more thought to before agreeing to this.
“And you were gonna leave without telling us too?” Dean asks, something resigned in his voice and the twist of his mouth. That’s even worse.
He wasn’t worth it, of course; he’s never been worth a damn, but if Cas thinks he is, if Cas thinks he’s worth that level of devotion, of
Of course, he also doesn’t actually ever put guests in it.
“How did you…” Dean starts, but Cesar waves him off.
Tied to a chair and bleeding, the siren had fucking winked at him, tossing her blonde curls and looking so, so young - not really like Claire, but not

It feels petty and small, and huge at the same time too. Angels aren’t supposed to get their

“You didn’t choose it,” he says instead.
“This isn’t right,” Castiel says, and Dean turns to look at him, rolling his shoulder back and studying the woods behind him.
“And you think we would let him.” Dean says, slowly, his face closing off as the pieces click into place.
gets them fucked with.
“What?” Dean asks, amusement and relief in his tone, dropping his eyes in something like embarrassment as Castiel drinks him in. Castiel just shakes his head and leans in to kiss him again.
“It’s been six months. I didn’t
Or maybe Castiel is just a coward who doesn’t want to be there to see the look on Dean’s face when it does.  Maybe all of the above
It would be so easy to let this catch fire, just here on the library table, and decorum be damned, but he
“You’re okay with this?”
He drums his fingers against the table and then tries again. “Did we start hunting again?”
He wrests his hands free so he can pull at Cas’ tie and the buttons of his shirt. Cas finally stops kissing him long enough to shrug out of his dress shirt and tug at the hem of Dean’s henley, pulling it up over his head. Cas steps off the bed long enough to tug off his dress pants and underwear. Dean wants to watch that, but he doesn’t have time to look his fill; he barely has time to struggle out of his jeans before Cas is back on him and they’re kissing again. Dean moves up against the pillows at the head of the bed, pulling Cas after him until Cas is draped over him, holding him close, holding him down and secure. His hands are everywhere, cupping Dean’s face and throwing sparks where he trails his fingers up Dean’s side.
Cas seems pensive, rubbing one hand up and down Dean’s arm, soothing. It’s a long moment before he says, quietly,  “I promise you, as long as I have a choice, that’s what I want too.”
Sam sighs and knocks his knuckles against the table next to his laptop, screen glowing blue in the darkness of the room. “No, of course not,” he says.
Except Dean knows he looks like shit, still bruised and haggard, where Sam seems fine - eager and even hopeful, like they aren’t ramping up for a suicide mission. Again.
Dean drinks about three cups of hospital vending machine coffee in the waiting room. It’s been awhile since they’ve had to do this - the benefits of both the bunker and having an angel on-call. He’s rusty at both managing his hospital-related anxiety and the blustering charm it takes to sell their weak-ass lies about what actually happened.
Dean shrugs. “Yeah, I’m just saying. For a guy who wanted out of the life so badly, this is the opposite of that.”
better than I was. I’m just thinking.”
“Great,” she says, nodding decisively. “Here’s my card.” She points at Cas. “You come back tomorrow. And call me if the infection spreads.”
Inside, the house is light and airy, intentionally rustic, with wide exposed wooden beams in the high ceiling and brightly colored rugs covering the sandstone tile floor. They enter into a wide living room with a hallway running off to one side. The far wall is entirely windows, with a view of the pasture where it curves around back.
“It’s in Montana.”
“Heaven to start with; try to track down Michael. Go from there.”
“You’ve seen a hodag?” Dean asks, trying to catch up.
Cas shrugs. “He told me.”
“I do know about all of these movies, Dean.”
“I love
But there’s also been something grounding about the hum of someone else's presence in the room and the physical exhaustion of actually spending his days
When he chances a look at Dean, Dean is just gaping at him. “Cas, you saved me. Maybe made it possible for us to save everyone. I don’t..”Dean starts, and then stops, breathing deep and closing his eyes, before opening them again, and focusing all of his attention on Castiel’s face. Castiel shudders. “Are you telling me,” Dean says, quietly, a little dangerous, “that you just gave up your grace, gave up everything,
“No, that’s fine; we don’t need to put you out.” He makes quick eye contact with Dean and then looks away.
(“She just wants to
Rowena pulls her braid over her shoulder and looks up at them before cutting her eyes to the bar, all long eyelashes and shadows. For a second in the low light her eyes flash violet and she looks like the Queen of Hell and then it’s gone, a trick of the light. She winks at them and downs the rest of her drink, sliding out of the booth and straightening her form-fitting black dress.
Dean nods and sets off through the trees.
“How is he?” Sam asks, and Cas shrugs, eyeing Dean warily.
“Dean. Dean, can you hear me?” Sam is saying. Dean registers Sam’s death grip on his right hand and the IV in his left arm, and then, as the fog clears a little more, his left leg, elevated in a sling.
Castiel was the one who had left the others when he couldn’t take it, pleading exhaustion, and he had felt Dean’s eyes follow him out of the room.
“I like what you’ve done with the place,” Dean finally gets out.
Cas sighs and moves away, back through the adjoining door.
His weakened grace hasn't yet done much to impede his angelic strength, but there are so many. It occurs to him that the last time they were here he still had his wings, and that's probably what saved him then. They push him into the clearing toward the portal’s wavering light. They aren’t even trying to take him down, just drive him back, back, until he’s standing in front of the Leviathan leader who is still wearing Dick Roman’s smirking face. There's a crowd of Leviathan at his back.
Dean leans against him heavily and drops his eyes. He says, “Just your phrasing. I know you wouldn’t leave me here, but you have to admit, you leave a lot.”
“Hey,” Dean says.
The doctor glances up, pushing dark hair behind her ear and looking him up and down, and then blinks at him with wide, disarming brown eyes. It’s a little terrifying.
Dean’s not sure when the bunker turned back into Hunter Headquarters. It must have been gradual, but people are in and out and back and forth until what it feels like is that he wakes up one day and finds Bobby and a cluster of faces he only barely recognizes around the kitchen table. Jody and Claire are in the gym teaching Jack and another teenage boy he definitely doesn’t recognize the finer points of vamp staking. Rowena’s in the library with Patience going over meticulous spell setup, now that she’s as limited to elaborate rituals for spell casting as the rest of them. Dean just wanted a fucking cup of coffee.
Cas pours himself a cup of coffee and slumps down in the seat across from Dean, making a “go ahead" gesture. His hair is a mess, and he’s in one of Dean’s old t-shirts; something in Dean’s gut clenches. They stare at each other for a moment, and then Dean breaks.
Cas stands up from the bed and advances toward him until Dean finds himself backed up against the wall. There’s still space between them, but Dean can feel the heat of Cas’ body, can feel the thud of his own heart in his chest.
And if they make it through, Dean will do next thing - whatever that is. Keep breathing. Love the people he’s got left, with whatever pieces of himself he can patch back together. He owes Cas that much.
Dean breathes out harshly. “Oh, kid. I know. Me too. Chuck played us all.“ He takes a breath. I’m sorry too.” He doesn’t feel like that will ever be quite enough, maybe for either of them.
“Dean…” Sam starts, once Cas is gone, but Dean just shakes his head.
It’s not that anything is
Cas answers the door in his shirtsleeves with his tie loose and Dean nearly chokes. He has
Jack moves around him, following his instructions. When he’s got everything combined, Dean hands him the bowl with the dry ingredients and a fork, showing him how to whisk it all together. They work mostly in silence.  Dean turns toward the griddle when it’s hot enough.
“Where are the Leviathan?” he asks.
Since Jack and everything after, Castiel hasn’t known what to do with this deep anger, hasn’t known where to put his grief, visceral and achingly human. That night in the library shattered something between him and Dean and he feels like he’s still picking shrapnel out of his skin. But there were wounds below that. Both of them have scar tissue layered over scar tissue.
“It doesn’t matter. I wouldn’t
They pass on Cesar and Jesse’s contact info to Sam and Eileen and head for Denver, another haunting. Cas is quiet and contemplative on the drive.
that obligation - something he never wanted to be to begin with - they’ve generally had some pretty radical differences of opinion on how that should be handled. Cas loves him and sacrifices for him, and for Sam and Jack and the world, but he doesn’t stay. It’s always something, and Dean’s always turning around and getting blindsided by Cas’s best intentions. (Case in point: the narrowly dodged bullet of the deal with The Empty, what the actual fuck.)
Dean knows why they’ve fallen into this configuration, with Cas always at Jack’s side. It’s been like that since Jack got back to the bunker, even before this misadventure. Dean gets it - Cas is fiercely protective of people he loves and everything with Jack still feels impossible and precarious. It feels petty, but part of Dean always wants Cas on his side of the table, and they had just been getting back to normal.
Cas looks up at him then, something both apologetic and defiant his gaze when their eyes meet. “Dean, I made a deal. Me for Jack.”
“How was it?” He asks. He’s not jealous, not really. He’s proud a little bit, in a fucked up, self-defeating kind of way. Cas deserves human experiences, and this is part of that, if it’s something that he wants. So Dean’s not jealous, but he is terrified, that it
His head feels better, and it’s his left leg that’s fucked, so he takes Baby out for the first time since The Accident. Sam goes with him on the pretense of brotherly bonding, but probably really because he still doesn’t totally trust Dean behind the wheel. That’s annoying, but Dean doesn’t fight him too hard; he doesn’t mind the company.
Dean stands under the spray until the water runs cold before he accepts that it’s not going to scald him clean. He lies in bed for two hours before he accepts that he’s going to see Lee every time he closes his eyes, probably for a long, long time.
Cas smiles, wry and not really amused. “I’ve been tired of that for a very,
The mood in the room turns fast, and they’re glaring at each other over the library table.
He goes to the bar by himself and puts the work in anyway. An out-of-towner smiles at him just right over their beer (never a local, not in Lebanon) and he goes back to the woman’s hotel room or the bed of the dude’s truck, parked out an old dirt road. It’s fun in the moment, but it doesn’t last, and he drives home in the Impala feeling hollowed out.
“I’m not much of an angel. My grace has been at half-strength for years and is growing weaker, and if Metatron wasn’t lying when he took it for the spell, I have a soul now.”
“Yes. Dean…”
“Can’t sleep?” he asks.
“Oh, yes,” she says. “Rebecca Fischer.” She holds her hand out and Dean shakes it warily.
His heart beat before. He breathed before. But it was different. There was a redundancy to those human responses of his vessel (of his body - it was his even then) when his grace threaded through him, when there was still part of him that felt separate from blood and bone and breath.
“It’s not demons,” he says. “There are no demons.”
He wakes up alone in the clearing at the foot of the portal with the grass flattened around him and Leviathan dead on the ground, oozing black into the dirt. He’s got Leviathan blood on him and it smells like oil and rot.
want to go back to the bunker. If we go back, will you stay there?” Dean hesitates and Cas takes his hesitation for what it is.
(Billie had said, “it’s your funeral,” with a nonchalant shrug and disappeared with a crack to the air. Dean was pretty sure she didn’t used to have sound effects, but she’d gotten increasingly dramatic over the years.)
That should get them what they need.
“What?”
“Everything. I once spoke every language. I remembered...everything. Or thought I did. They reprogrammed me in Heaven so many times, more than I knew. I’m not sure I knew what was real.” And wow, does Dean know that feeling. He’s still not sure, even now, how much of the path of his life was Chuck, or how much of what and who he is is the weapon John Winchester fashioned in the quest for revenge, or even how different those things are, in the end, cause and effect spilling out through the years. Has he ever made his own choices? He hopes so.
“You’re not.”
“But?”
Cas clinks his glass, and gives Dean a snarky half-smile. “I told you it wasn’t possession”
“I know. Maybe we need that.”
“No fucking clue. Billie didn’t seem to think so.”
Sam clears his throat. “Eileen ran into some trouble on a haunting case out in Virginia. I’m going to head out that way tomorrow to help her out.”
“No, I don’t.”
Sam doesn’t have a case for them, so Dean heads for the coast. They cross the bridge into Galveston Island just before sunrise. Dean buys them both cheap gas station coffee and drives to the water and they sit on the hood of the Impala as the sky starts to glow orange above them.
“Are you okay?” Cas asks, eyeing him warily from the passenger seat, and Dean shifts because he can’t really get comfortable with the pain shooting up his right side.
, but he also doesn’t like the expression on Cas’s face.
“I’m sorry,” Castiel says again, after a moment.
. I got this.”
He breaks the kiss to tip his forehead against Cas’ and says, “I love you,” because he has to follow Cas’ confession up with something, even if it’s weak in comparison. He may not have the poetry or the words, but he has just as much devotion to back it up.
Dean clears his throat. “I’m fine. Watch the movie.”
in every way.” He takes another deep breath.  “I meant, I love you. And I thought you knew.”
He wakes first in the morning to Cas’s fingers curled over his hip, and he lies there for a moment, just breathing, before the smell of coffee calls him to the kitchen and he leaves Cas asleep.
I love you.
“I like him, your guy,” Jesse says, glancing at Dean out of the corner of his eye, still something a little questioning in his tone. Not prying, just curious.
He doesn’t sleep.  He should have known better than to try.  He also doesn’t leave his room until around noon, and when he does, Cas is nowhere to be found, which means he doesn’t really want to be found, but they’re in a good place, last night notwithstanding. Cas would tell him if he was taking off.
sounds like witchcraft, boys. You all didn’t touch anyone, did you?”
“I just mean…” Dean cuts himself off, because he’s not sure what he means. Explicitly, no, they didn’t. But they
Dean’s head whips around. “For what?” There’s something so cautious in his voice.
Dean knows that too. They don’t even have time for this conversation.
Dean texts Sam and tells him not to follow. He grabs the Purgatory blade off the hook on his bedroom wall and almost staggers under the muscle memory of its weight in his hand.
He never had a moment in Purgatory before when he didn’t feel watched, but now everything feels unnervingly quiet and still. He shakes his head. “It shouldn’t matter. They’ll come to us.”
Castiel gives him a weak smile. “Hello, Dean.”
"Oh, well, if
If Cas thought. Not thinks. They had a shot at a future, a real one, a  better one than Dean ever knew or let himself hope for, but that’s over now. And when he lets himself sit with that - if he even gets a chance to when this is all over - it’s going to break him for good.  But he owes Cas more than to let that happen now.
Dean honest to God laughs, which is probably not the most appropriate reaction, but that’s where Cas wants to go with this? Does he
“Yes, there is,” Cas says, pushing the laptop over to Stevie.
It should have been any of the rest of them, and the siren had tried. She went after Sam as the medical examiner (because of course she did; coincidence, Dean’s ass - this case had way too many callbacks) tough and smart and sweet, with a nerdy fascination for old books and a story about a haunting she’d seen as a little girl to explain why she was open-minded and willing to roll with their weirdness. And Sam, too guilt-ridden and self-loathing after Eileen and Rowena, had shut down every advance.
The house is like a haunted mansion out of a horror movie - dark and foreboding; old and in disrepair. The poltergeist comes at him where he’s standing at the edge of the stairwell and flashes out just before he swings the steel bar, and then in again with enough force to shove. The banister gives, and he has enough time to register Cas shouting his name before he hits the ground three stories below and everything goes black.
The motel is their usually flop, a ways off the highway past the nicer Days Inns and even the Motel Eights. His back is already protesting the last few nights on the thin mattress and after a night of grave digging and the ghost encounter, his hip is not going to thank him in the morning.
Castiel sighs, but rearranges them to get one arm under Dean, careful of the side he's still favoring, bringing the other down to cover Dean’s fingers. Dean relaxes against him in the darkness, squeezing his hand. Castiel feels some of his own tension evaporate under the soothing rub of Dean’s thumb against his hip.
Dean’s presence behind him before he sees him.  It’s strange, he always thought that ability was an artifact of his angelic senses. Of course, Dean is there now. Castiel isn’t ready yet.
“Hey, you two,” a familiar voice calls out of the darkness. “Fancy meeting you here. Now don’t be shy. Come out or we’ll have to come get you.” Castiel can’t see his face from here, with the way he’s backlit by the portal light, but he knows Dick Roman’s voice too well. Beside him he feels as much as hears Dean’s sharp intake a breath and the way his body goes tense and tight.
Cas may not believe him, but he lets it go. He withdraws his hand, but not far. If they were on a couch and not these chairs with inconvenient arms, Dean is pretty sure they’d be pressed up together, thighs and shoulders touching.
They had two options - Billie’s way or Amara’s way, Death or the Darkness, mutually exclusive choices because if Amara’s way failed, there was no guarantee Jack would have enough juice left for Plan B. In the end it had been Jack’s call, and Dean had been guiltily relieved that for once it didn’t fall to him or Sam.
in his voice. Cas tugs him to his feet without letting go of his hand.
Cas closes his eyes again. “I just mean...I assume this is what people mean when they talk about phantom pain, phantom limbs. I can still feel it.” His hand hovers above his breast bone. “But I reach for it and nothing. Obviously. When the ghost threw you, I went to heal you, and then I remembered. That’s all.”
Dean pushes forward, kissing him again, deep and slow. Cas lets himself be moved backward, and then spins them around so he can walk Dean back until the back of his knees are against the bed and then they’re tumbling down onto it. Dean’s on his back, Cas still holding one hand up above his head with his other on Dean’s face, jaw, throat. Dean breaks the kiss to turn his head and press his lips to Cas’ palm, and then get his other hand under Cas shirt, the skin of Cas’ back hot against his fingers, and pulls down to get rid of every inch of space between them.
“Not good enough. I need you to say it. And then maybe in eleven and a half hours we have a conversation about the rest of that shit.”
what that’s like? Boy, does he ever.
Dean isn’t dead. He’d know. That's always been simultaneously the most comforting and terrifying element of their bond - the low-key ache of Dean’s longing he can feel through the tendrils of his grace and how he feels it like a gut punch when it’s snuffed out. Dean isn’t the only one who sends out those waves of emotion. He can feel it from Claire sometimes. Sometimes from Sam. But Dean’s the only constant, this humming on the edge of his awareness, vague and wordless most of the time. They’ve never talked about it. He doesn’t know what it means. Before he’d been human, he’d never really wondered, and since then he’s spun in circles over and over for years trying to put words or context to what they are.
“I know. I know he did. It’s not your fault.” He doesn’t know that he wants to know what else Cas said about unhappiness, and he knows why Cas took the deal, can’t blame him for doing it, not for that piece.
So when he had to stop before he collapsed, with his back against a tree and the darkness closing in, when he wasn’t being pulled forward by pure momentum and uncertainty crawled back in, that was when Dean prayed.
“Sam and Eileen can take care of themselves, Dean. Just sleep for a few hours. If we don’t hear anything, we’ll track them down tomorrow.”
“About the shaving cream?”
“I’m fine, Sammy,” he says. “I know I’ve been saying that, even when it wasn’t totally true, but I’m really going to be okay. You can stop worrying so goddamn much.”
“You need to rest,” Cas says. “That might make it easier.”
Dean watches her go. “She’s going to eat him alive,” he says, low in Cas’s ear. Cas laughs and leans closer. Over his head, Dean catches the eye of a brunette at the bar, but turns away when she smiles. His old definitions of “fun” seem like too much work.
“Yeah, no one said you had to.  No one said you had to come last time either, actually, if I remember how that went down.”
“I’m fine,” he says. “It’s not a big deal.”
It’s a night for honesty, right? “Come with me?” Dean asks. “Sleep if you need to, or just watch over me, I don’t care.”
the life. I married a hunter. I’m not gonna go stalking Djinn for fun or anything, but there’s good to be done. We can take what the Men of Letters were trying to do, and make it better, more nuanced. I mean, we have friends who are werewolves. My therapist is a shapeshifter. One of my best friends is a witch. Saving people, hunting things, the way we were raised...it’s not black and white. We know things other people don’t know, and...we really have something to contribute here.”  He sits back in his chair and says, more gently, “You know, this doesn’t mean you have to do anything, right? You have a choice too.”
It’s unnatural, cosmically wrong for angels to be in Purgatory. He felt it before and he feels it now, like a film on his skin, the way this place wants to expel them both. Dean had been so sure the portal would work for both of them back then, and of course he’d been right. It had just seemed unnecessarily cruel for Castiel to ever confirm that when it hadn’t mattered, after.
Cas sleeps in the next morning, and when he stumbles into the kitchen after Sam leaves on his run, Dean is waiting.
“I know what you meant. I’m not
Then Sam drove the knife in - the knife they’d cut Jack’s arm with and covered in his blood. Dean stood there, reeling.
So, Dean and Cas have kind of been in a weird place since Purgatory.
The vampires come out of nowhere, and they don’t go down easy. When Dean has the last one backed up against a tree, Castiel reaches out to still his hand.
.” His fingers are still digging in tight on Dean’s arm.  Dean’s watching Sam’s face closely; he sees Sam’s eyes widen slightly when he really looks and takes in the bloody handprint on Dean’s shoulder; he sees the bob of Sam’s throat as he swallows down whatever else he was going to say.
Garth and Bess come to visit, and Dean makes burgers and pie from scratch. They break out a few bottles of what he assumes is good wine from the old Men of Letters cellar and sit around the table for hours, just talking. Dean goes to bed after midnight, feeling warm, and full, and hazy, and still a little lost.
.  Dean’s right; they are so stupid.
Cas smiles a little sadly and casts his eyes down at the sand. “It’s fading, you know.”
Dean makes a joke about taking out a vamp nest and Cas
He  knocks on the door of Cas’ room. Or, more accurately, he knocks on the door of the guest room that he once offered arbitrarily when Cas was human before the Gadreel mess and that Cas now uses on the rare occasion he wants to put a door that locks between himself and the other occupants of the bunker rather than spending his nights haunting the library. Dean usually respects that and doesn’t seek Cas out there. He doesn’t like being in there anyway much; all these years and it still feels too transitory and impersonal; it makes him anxious.
Dean gapes. Cas starts, “What’s…”  She holds up one hand cutting him off.
“It probably would have worked for me before. Purgatory doesn’t want angels in it anymore than it wants humans.”
Fucking
“Dean,” he says, low and soft, and moves over to the bedside, hesitantly laying one hand on Dean’s forearm. When Dean can see him better, in the lamp light, he looks even worse than Sam did, pale and washed out.
Cas smiles, a little wry. “You’re not the only one tired of staring at the walls of the bunker.”
And well, there it is. Dean’s been waiting for that. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
He says, “Sure, Sammy,” into his beer and waits until Sam leaves the room.
Dean said, “Cas, no. That wasn’t…”
“They spring up when Leviathans die. Not right away, but within a few hours. Leviathan blood and Purgatory soil, I don’t know. I didn’t think much about it at the time, running for both our lives and all that. But. What else could it be?”
“Okay. Yeah, that makes sense.”  Dean shifts, fiddling with the placemat and the corner of the notebook Sam left open on the table
and it’s enough. Nothing about that has changed, Dean has always been enough. Castiel hardly gave up
He’s hovering. He knows it. He knows Cas is annoyed, mostly because Cas makes no secret of it, waving him off with an “I’m
Cas...Cas is maybe the only one who isn’t hovering. He’s
Cas ducks his head. “Formerly, but yes. It’s nice to meet you.”
“What?”
like possession, and Stevie backed me up. Right, Stevie?” He looks up at her expectantly, and she’s just looking back and forth between them.
“No,” Dean says, bitterness coloring his voice. “I’m not even surprised that’s the catch, though I’m a little surprised it hadn’t occurred to us. Now that you’ve said it, of course.  Of fucking course. Why would this go any other way? Cosmic beings and their cosmic agendas. Fuck.”
has always had the potential to be whatever Dean wanted it to be.
They haven’t really talked since the siren.
Dean looks down and clears his throat. “Yeah, well, it’s okay if you have fun too and don’t worry so much about him for a night.”
Dean’s not sure he’s good now, but collectively the people he loves are, which was really all that ever mattered. All night he’s been trying to avoid saying how weird it is now that the story’s over and they’re living in the epilogue, which Dean wasn’t supposed to be here for and seems to suck at. The crisis is past, which he’s grateful for, but he’s also great in a crisis. He’s apparently not as solid in the aftermath. Which is a thing that he’s learning now because this is the first time he can remember when there hasn’t been a crisis. If your whole life is a crisis, does that still constitute a crisis? Self-discovery is great.
Sam shrugs and squints and his computer, making a quick note in the open notebook next to him. “Nasty vamp nest, out in South Carolina. Jack and Derek want to go, but Jack’s still a little shaky without his powers and Derek’s so new. I trust Claire and Jody, but we still need to get their confidence up.” Dean does not say
And Cas
Dean chuckles, looking down at his whiskey and swirling it in the glass. “You can hear what I’m thinking?” He’s never been sure where exactly that line is or how much intention on his part it takes for Cas to hear him. That would make this easier, he supposes.
he can do at this point is take down Chuck and save the others or die trying.
now. There’s a conversation abandoned half-way through, an unanswered question hanging in the air, and it leaves him with this unsettled feeling, even when Cas is smiling at him warmly across the table or squeezing his shoulder as he brushes by. Dean put about half his cards on the table in Purgatory, but there are a few more to play. Cas’ cards are already out there, probably, but they’ve never made complete sense. Dean’s never been totally sure they’re playing the same game, and it leaves him on edge; a constant state of waiting for something he can’t quite bring himself to name.
Cas?” Dean doesn’t like the shake in his own voice and swallows hard to tamp it down.
It’s not so different, except that everything is different. He was over and he was done, and he was at peace, and now.  Well, now here he is, alive and breathing with the rhythm of his own heart heavy in stillness.
Sam shrugs with his whole body. “Yeah. Kinda.”
When Dean and Jody find them, they’re wasted and pouring through journals trying to identify the symbols on an old wooden box Dean wouldn’t open for all the booze or money in the world.
“Okay,” Dean says. There’s a shake in his voice and he swallows it down.
Dean just nods and looks down at his beer.
Sam smiles tightly, and squeezes his hand even tighter. “Maybe don’t try to move.”
Maybe wanting to be worthy of that kind of devotion has always been a lot of pressure and vaguely incomprehensible, somehow both more and less than he wanted, and way more than he deserved. So just for a moment, just long enough for Dean to torch his own life, it had made a sick and desperate kind of sense that it might all be Chuck’s game, in the end.
“One thing, Cas. Or two, actually. You can’t talk like you’re not coming back. And answer your fucking phone when I call you.”
That’s logical, and Dean hates it anyway. Jack’s as headstrong as Claire, in his own way - less openly defiant, but way more likely to just nod and smile and then do whateverthefuck he wants anyway.
He stops by Dean’s room after to check on him. He’s not surprised to find Dean still awake and staring at his laptop. Castiel hovers in the doorway, and Dean looks up, turning to push the computer aside. He flinches with the movement where it pulls at whatever damage still lingers, and Castiel tamps down the guilt over not being enough this time.
The point was saving the world. Living through it was always just kind of a nice-to-have. Sam won’t like that if Dean says it out loud. “What?” He says, half-smile, one eyebrow cocked, a mask of bravado Sam sees straight through. “Hunting’s a day job now?”
, he’s going to lose it again, but that’s going to happen anyway, and maybe he owes them too - the truth, or some approximation of it.  They were Cas’ family too.
Dean spends another month in his room, avoiding most of the bustle of the bunker. He watches movies with Cas. He asks Sam and Rowena polite questions about the artifacts they spend their days digging out of the storage room and lovingly cataloging. He teaches Jack to play pool.
They take down a Rugaru outside Shreveport and walk away without as much as a scratch. Dean feels triumphant, and hyper aware he shouldn’t be so grateful to finish a hunt unscathed.
Dean had thought he was going to die here once. Castiel had thought he was going to live. It’s true that those things were a very different undertaking.
She flinches, but smirks up at him, defiant, and hisses out, “Wouldn’t you like to know?”
Rowena and Jack go to the fancy bakery to get a celebratory cake while the rest of them are at the courthouse, and Jody and Donna bring the girls down that night. Cas manages to limp into the kitchen to participate and complain that the fondant flowers taste like rubbery disappointment.
Jesse smiles softly and intimately, looking down. “It’s what Cesar wanted. For so long I didn’t know how to want anything except revenge. He could see a way out when I couldn’t, you know? But I promised him this, and he was right to push for it; it’s amazing.”
“Okay, Alan.” Dean says, taking at the guy’s name tag. “For me? Why?”
“Dean,” Cas says through clenched teeth, “please shut up.”
? Does he
Or, that’s not quite true. He has a list of things to say. He just doesn’t know where to even start.
Dean dreams of fire, of darkness at the bottom of the ocean, of Mary’s eyes, of the imprint of wings burned across the dirt, and wakes up shaking.
“What?”
Dean squeezes his arm again and drops into the chair next to him. So close, still close enough to touch.
Castiel understands.
Physically, he’s getting there. He goes to his doctor like he’s supposed to and she says things like
Dick laughs. “Two against…” He looks behind him, seeming to count, and then shrugs. “A lot. And some vampires in the trees behind you. I like the odds.”
Dean shrugs. If the rumors are weirder than the truth then he doesn’t really want to know what people are saying. “Honestly, probably. It’s been a weird decade, man, I don’t know what to tell you.”
“I’m sorry,” Jack is saying, “he made me promise, he said it wasn’t anything we had to worry about now, he said….” and Dean holds up one hand to stop him.
They spend a few unpleasant nights running around the woods in the dark before they find it, if by “find it” you mean, “get attacked out of nowhere.”
“You do that. I’ll call Rowena.
“Well, you are in the gym a lot. That makes all of those things worse. You get used to it.”
It’s...different. There’s a soft knitted blanket on the bed in a deep forest green. There are stacks of books on the desk - research books from the library, yes, but also a tattered copy of Slaughterhouse Five and a hardback copy of the full works of Shakespeare - where did that even come from? There’s a picture of Claire on the shelf on the wall, and one of Cas and Jack together that Sam took and Jack used to have in his room. Cas must have had a copy made at some point. And there’s the mixtape, on the shelf next to the photographs. Dean inhales sharply through the sudden surge of emotion.
Cas is back in the exam room for about 45 minutes, before a nurse comes out and makes a beeline for Dean.
“No.” Cas cut him off abruptly, looking up with something desperate in his eyes. “No,” he said again, more gently, squeezing Dean’s hand back when Dean made a move to pull away. “Whatever you’re going to say, tell me tomorrow.”
. He’s saying
They never did finish what they started in the library, and Dean hates himself a little for how much easier that conversation seemed when they were staring down the barrel of a loaded gun.
“Okay,” he says.
“I bet that was fun to explain.”
Dean chokes on his coffee.
that went down tonight?”
Sam sighs before he grudgingly sends them the info. “Dean, come back for a while. Or just take a break. You guys need it.”
Dean nods. He doesn’t like to remember much about that time, but he remembers every second of that reunion.
“I know,” Dean lies. He knows damn well from personal experience that you absolutely mean what you say on siren venom. It’s missing context and nuance. You don’t mean it quite the way it comes out, harsh and angry, words like barbs wielded to wound, but all those feelings the siren dredges up are pulled from an honest place of vulnerability and pain. So Jack standing there with that knife, full of human anger, as though using his angel powers didn’t even occur to him, saying, “I’ll never forgive you” and “I have to do this because I’ll be safe with her” and “this is the only way I’ll ever be safe” -  that came from feelings that were real.
so hard.
“Yeah, seems to be. We’re okay at the moment.”
“He’s gone, kiddo,” he says, as gently as he can. Before this,
“Maybe it wasn’t Chuck,” Sam says.
It was a lot, for a first human day.
He lets it pass this time too, because even here, in the intimate dark by the lamplight, he’s a coward.
Dean kisses him, just a press of their lips together, hand tight on Castiel’s jaw. Castiel freezes for a minute, struck by the enormity of this moment, too stunned to respond. But then he feels a slight hesitation as Dean starts to pull back, and that can’t happen. He leans in, catching Dean’s mouth more firmly, and feeling Dean open up and melt against him. Dean’s fingers slide around the back of Castiel’s head as he pulls Castiel against him more tightly.
The way back is a battle, everything they’d been expecting from the beginning and then some. Purgatory throws everything it has at them, except Leviathan, and it feels like a trap, or calculated attacks. Leviathan are the only ones here capable of that level of strategy and interspecies cooperation.
“I said, I’ll take the hunt.”  He does his best to sign that last part, because he’s trying.
The rift sizzles and spits, like water on a flame, a jagged red scar cut through the room, bleeding unnatural light. Dean can feel the heat it’s giving off from here.
“Dean!” He calls into the darkness. No answer. He stumbles back toward the tree line.
been through this.”
or they would have found it already, but he owes Cas that much. He owes Cas, everything, really. Everything in his life that is 100 percent
By the time they get back to the portal, the flowers have bloomed from the Purgatory soil watered with Leviathan blood. Castiel gathers a few. They’re shades of black and eerily delicate. They smell like iron and rot.
“You leave it too,” he says and climbs into bed still in his jeans.
“We’ll see.”
“Okay,” Jack says, stepping forward to the counter, keeping just enough distance so that their shoulders don’t brush.
And now here they are, staring down a rift to Purgatory. He’s not sure he can stomach going back there alone. He’s pretty sure he
“What’s the damage?” Dean asks; he’s sure he’s not going to like the answer. He can’t feel much of anything except vaguely floaty, which probably means hard core painkillers masking whatever he’s gonna get hit with when they start to wear off.
, really. Things are better than he ever would have hoped. It’s just that he never really thought this far ahead.
Dean scoffed. “Wow, you’re not pulling your punches tonight, are you?”
stay with us. With
Cas covers Dean’s hand with his own. “I’m okay, Dean. I’m just thinking.”
“Was it Billie?” Sam asks. Dean shakes his head.
Cas doesn’t look particularly comforted by Dean’s words. He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath, and then reaches for Dean’s hand. Dean’s anxiety kicks up another notch because as much as he does feel like Purgatory cracked some kind of wall between them, their history of physical contact is still mostly limited to someone dying or returning from the dead. He lets Cas wrap their fingers together and squeeze.
He gets off the floor and he texts Sam to tell him he’s alive and Billie’s gone. Sam texts him back to tell him everything he already knew. It was Chuck after all - it always is - and the others are gone, their friends and family snatched away in an eye blink. Sam’s a smart kid and must have caught the “I” in “I’m alive.” His next message just says they’re headed for the bunker and for Dean to stay put. Where would even go, alone?
, every sound in the distance a threat. There were no benign forest creatures in Purgatory. Dean always felt watched.
But tonight he pulls Dean with him down onto the bed so they’re wrapped in each other’s arms face-to-face and Castiel can study the freckles on Dean’s face in the lamplight. Nothings’ different with his new human vision, except that everything’s different, isn’t it?
? “And I know we have bigger things to worry about.” Dean knows that’s true, but in this moment, he doesn’t feel like it is. “And now, you’ve been so uncertain of everything,” Cas continues. “What any of it means. What’s real, what’s Chuck, where it all comes from. Do you still think Chuck had something to do with the siren case?”
Cas is silent for a long moment. Too long. When Dean dares another glance at him, Cas is staring at the ceiling.
He finds Cas in the library when he’s not even looking for him because that’s how this works, Cas underfoot now when all of Dean’s coping mechanisms are so fucking frayed he doesn’t trust himself to open his mouth without saying something else he’ll regret.
He knows Sam and Eileen are worried. Jody and Donna are worried. Jack gives him a wide berth most of the time, even now, and Dean and Cas are caught in this tense holding pattern, like the pressure drop before the storm breaks. Dean feels like everyone’s waiting for him to snap or do
There’s no hex bag. They go back through everything from the previous scenes, and there’s nothing there either. There’s nothing tangible, really, to indicate witchcraft - no spell remnants at the scenes, no sigils -  and when they get Rowena on the phone again in the morning, she’s less convinced than Cas is.
“Thank you,” Castiel says, "I'll let you know as soon as I find anything." He moves to turn away when Dean leans forward to grab his forearm, pulling him back around.
Dean nods, and then looks up at Castiel, cocking his head to indicate the t-shirt and sweatpants he’s wearing, stolen from the laundry room, and his wet hair. “Since when do you shower. Or change?”
“For what now?” Dean asks, voice muffled where he has his head tipped against Castiel’s shoulder, sounding mildly put out in a way that makes Castiel tighten his arms around him.
Cas slips into the room, careful not to open the door too wide, and eases himself onto the other side of the bed, up against the headboard.
(“It’s a slasher flick, Cas. There are tropes.”
“Not like this.” There had been quiet moments in Purgatory, both when he was alone, and later, with Benny and Dean. They’d had uninterrupted hours. But this eerie silence is too complete. It’s weird that he would feel better if he did feel watched. “We need a better plan.”
“You’re buying,” she says, “don’t wait up, boys.” She pauses, and turns back to them, narrowing her eyes. “And maybe -
. Dean, personal hygiene is
Donna and Jody bring the girls down and Claire, Kaia, and Jack take a bottle of whisky and sneak into the archives to play a drinking game they’ve dubbed “curse roulette” with the objects that haven’t made it through Sam’s inventory yet.
Dean says, “We’ll be back soon, Sammy,” and maybe means it.
“Kiddo, I don’t think I’m the right person to ask about that at all.”
“I'm sorry," he says. "I didn't want to worry you until I knew more."
For a while there, after he lost his grace, he sat in his room and stared at the walls, and Dean was a little afraid he wasn’t going to get up again at all. Then, when he finally did, he got all the way up and went to the gym until he learned to throw a punch with new human muscles and to the shooting range until he could hit a bullseye and now there’s jogging. Dean doesn’t hate it, but it’s a whole new world. The normal clothes, the flex of Cas’s bicep, the line of his throat as he swallows - it all still hasn’t stopped doing weird things to Dean’s insides.
When they find the place, it’s a sprawling adobe ranch house with a porch swing swaying on the front porch, overlooking the pasture land. A little black cat uncurls itself from a bed next to the door and wanders over to twine itself around Cas’s legs; he bends down to scratch behind its ears.
except his dad and Sam, and if he thought no one could annoy him as much as Sam can, he underestimated Castiel, former angel of the Lord.
“Awww, Castiel,” Dick says. “You know how this is going to go. You’re going to say the spell, and you’re going to let me and a few of my friends in. It’ll be like old times. And then - maybe - we let Dean Winchester live. I’m not so inclined to after the last time we met, but you do me a favor, I do you one. A little quid pro quo.”
“Dean. Tell me tomorrow. When this is over.”
“I didn’t know,” he breathes out.
They’re all men, all the type of guys with a reputation for being able to take care of themselves.  None what Dean would call good people, based on the data in front of them.
“Definitely ghosts, though?”
He is not unhappy. That would undo so much. He is not unhappy to be back. He is not unhappy about the joy on Jack’s face or the relief in Sam’s, or about the way Dean folded him into his arms and buried his face against Castiel’s neck, exhaling wetly against his skin and clinging on. He is not unhappy, but he is lost, slammed back into existence and physicality (blood and bone and breath) and he also doesn’t know what happens now.
Cas sighed. “For what it’s worth, I think Jack made the right choice, and I think you were right to let him. Killing Chuck...I was willing to try when it seemed like the only way, but this way at least we maintain balance. God and The Darkness together.”
Dean scoffs. “Sure. Because I caught you.”
“I’m sorry.”
Cas says, “Okay. I’m thinking of how to explain it to you so you’ll stop being stupid.”  He pauses, choosing his words, and Dean waits, heart racing. “Some angels, for a long time, saw humans as a trap. And you were, in a way.  We were supposed to love you, but distantly.  We were supposed to see the beauty of humanity, but not...individuals for the most part.  That wasn’t always how it went. It was hard not to be curious. Some angels spent more time than they should with humans. Some formed friendships.  Some more. It was forbidden, of course, but,” Cas smirks, raising an eyebrow, “you don’t have to forbid things no one wants to do. You met Ishim. And you knew Gabriel.”
Dean threads their fingers together and stays close as they make their way down the hallway. There’s the same urgency to his touch that’s been there since they got back from the Empty, like he’s still a little afraid Castiel will vanish on him again, but Castiel gets it now, understand what Dean’s been saying for so long with everything except words, and holds back just as tight.
Castiel steps out of the trees, summoning as much of his grace as he can. He can't sustain it, but he hopes he can give them enough of a show to be intimidating. The wind picks up, and some of the Leviathan around Dick shuffle back, just a step behind their leader.
He hasn’t had a moment alone with Dean yet. Sam and Michael were there in the Empty, and then once they were back, really back, Jack was there too, and Eileen, and Bobby, Charlie, Donna, Jody, Claire. The whole of his human family, relieved and alive and wrapped around him.
He doesn’t stay up waiting, but he stays up
Of course he’s fine, but it also hurts like a motherfucker. It’s the kind of thing that’s happened to him probably hundreds of times, and it’s an injury he’d have shaken off at twenty, but that now he’s going to feel for weeks.
They’re about to start the third one, when Cas goes for his phone again and Dean reaches over him to snatch it off the arm of his chair.
Mother
Dean rubs his hand over his face. He doesn’t know why this is so hard; why it’s
, like a switch flicking off, they explained the plan. He’d said Cas was lucky his power had been so low to begin with, and that an angel at full power could never have survived something like that. And Dean had spent another week sitting by Cas’s bed feeling sick until Cas finally blinked open his eyes and asked for Dean by name.
“For ever leaving you.”
.  But he also doesn’t know. When Cas says, “
, and now they just have to figure out how.
Dean huffs something that sounds like a laugh that turns into a groan when Castiel accidentally jostles his ribs. Castiel gets one hand on the side of Dean’s jaw to tilt his head up and get a look at his face. His skin is ashen and there’s a mottled bruising along one side of his face; his eyes are bloodshot, but at least they’re focused.
“It’s like drowning in all of the worst parts of yourself, every worst impulse you’ve ever had, and not being able to stop it. I know we’re headed for a shitstorm eventually, and I know we’re going to do what we have to do. There might be some no-win choices coming because that’s how this goes, but here, today? I’m not sorry we’re not going down that road, man.” He huffs a laugh, dry but not entirely without humor. “‘I’m glad you don’t have it, whatever that means for the future. We got Sam and Eileen out safe. So yeah, I think I’m mostly okay.”
Dean pulls away first, with a reluctant squeeze to Castiel’s shoulder. “Go, if you have to,” he says, voice thick. “I’ll stall until I hear from you.”
He slows a little bit, softening the dizzying rush because Dean at this point pretty clearly isn’t going to do it. He pulls back, easing it with softer kisses, a brush of lips like a promise. “I love you,” he whispers again, and again between kisses, until they’re standing still again, wrapped in each other’s arms, Castiel’s forehead pressed against Dean’s temple, just breathing each other in.
Dean thinks angels have a limited emotional range, but that’s not exactly true. They feel things strongly - grief, fear, righteous anger. Love. But they do feel them differently -  distantly, and on a larger scale. In Heaven, there’s a cause or a mission or a charge. An angel might love humanity in the abstract, or grieve the necessity of a war, or be angry at the demon rampage over Earth or the corruption of Heaven. It’s not supposed to be
Dean just shrugs because, sure. It’s not exactly true, but it’s not
“You’re surprised?” Castiel watches the line of Dean’s spine, the curve of his neck, the hitch of his shoulders as he almost visibly collects himself. It’s not the kind of thing anyone in this bunker tells each other, and they both know that.
-  to have a little fun yourselves?”
“I’m telling you now,” Castiel says.
In the morning, “fine” is definitely not the word Dean would use. He finds Cas in the bathroom, poking at his shoulder, where it’s starting to swell, red and angry.
From there it’s quick, once the dots are connected, a straight line from Eric’s first wife’s “suicide” to his estranged stepson currently living with his aunt and uncle out in Rincon. When they track the stepson down, they find a wiry, nerdy, nineteen year-old kid with his mom’s old spellbook, a deep hatred of his stepfather, and absolutely no fucking clue about the extent of his power. He hadn’t even known the spell had worked for sure, much less the ricochet effect it had.
Like Dean would question it. Close e-fucking-nough. The closest Dean’s ever gonna get. Even if what they are now is all they ever are, he’s on this ride until Cas gets off.
If Chuck’s going to  manipulate everything they touch anyway, Dean wants it to be a straightforward fight. He’s tired of guessing at the subtext of his own life. He’s just tired.
“I don’t know, boys,” she says, tinny through the cell phone speaker. “No hex bags; no other signs of ritual. It sounds like it shares a lot of the symptoms of the attack dog spell, but for someone to do a spell of that magnitude over distance with nothing to ground it and make it contagious? That would take a lot of raw power, and we’re talking naturally occurring raw power. I don’t see how anyone operating on borrowed power or a deal could have that kind of strength left. Do you know how it spreads?”
Now he’s drinking in the library at 3 am. Solid start at this humanity thing.
Dean knew Cas was just grumpy because he
. Did you ever see a flower in Purgatory? Anywhere?”
; they’re
to stay.
By eight or nine months in, at night, in the pitch dark, he was pretty sure Cas was dead. He never said it to Benny, since he couldn’t leave without knowing for sure. He wouldn’t think it to himself during the day, because that’s not how you keep moving. He didn’t even really think it at night, but the prayers became confessional and more personal, a way of keeping track of himself in the endless rhythm of Purgatory. He kept talking to Cas because it was the only way to hold on to hope until the sun rose again.
Jack says, softly, “The deal.”  And there it is.
,” Castiel says desperately. He knows, with a sudden and settled conviction, that he wouldn’t have, for better or worse, for Heaven or Hell. He’s not proud of that, exactly, because Dean wasn’t wrong that the stakes are world-endingly high, but he’d have stayed and he’d have torn Purgatory apart. They have that in common. Dean taught him to be human. What does he expect?
He gets off the floor and he heads for the library and the lore. There’s nothing there. There’s not going to be
Dean’s at the bar with Cas and Rowena. Rowena’s three drinks in and predatory with it, making eyes at some hot asshole in a cowboy hat at the bar. Cas is matching Dean drink-for-drink and lilting a little against Dean’s shoulder, warm and sweaty where they’re pressed together.
It’s not a long way back, but it’s a difficult one. Dean is conscious and moving, but barely, and Castiel feels about as human and worn down as its possible for an angel to feel and still be an angel.
Neither of them has a handle on mortal human alcohol tolerance, and they both drink too much and all the time. Dean doesn’t say anything because he might be a hypocrite, but he’s a self-aware one.
It’s a powerful pull. And he’d been into Nick even before he got the venom in him. Nick had given him an out with the whole brother angle, probably to keep him from fighting it too hard because his repression ran a lot deeper back then, but desire of all kinds had been part of it. “But I thought I did, or at least that I could. It’s not real, though. It’s like being hypnotized, brainwashed, and some part of you knows it even while it’s happening. You felt the shift, right?  How quickly everything changes?”
“Okay, one, you should ask Sam what’s entertaining about serial killers sometime because he loves that topic, and two, these movies are a cultural touchstone. It’s important. ”
Sam pauses for a moment and then says, “I think...maybe I just wanted a choice? I’m
So no, Dean does not
Dean’s plans for the future have always been pipe dreams and bravado. He kind of abstractly wanted to live through this - whatever Cas or Sam thinks or accuses him of, he didn’t want to die; he just expected to. Deep down, he never believed he
Fucking sirens.
The Empty sleeps. There is no devil now, there is only Hell’s benevolent Queen. There is no God now, there is only Michael, against all odds softened by the Pit and transmuted through loving just one human man.
. He does the exercises for his leg, and practices sign language and tries to fight down the empty gnawing in the back of his brain that drove him back to hunting to begin with.
. You see me in ways that make me feel sliced to the bone. You looked me in the eye in Purgatory and told me you heard my prayer and I didn’t have to say it, and
parts two and three. “And then they come back.”
“Of course not,” Castiel says.
this now, and he wants so much more, wants to strip Dean naked in every way and watch him come apart under Castiel’s hands. He’s spinning, a little, with just how much he wants, and with the knowledge of being wanted back.
, and you still think…” he cuts himself off  again and rubs a hand over his face. “I shouldn’t have asked that of you, and you
Dean wants to say “for everything,” but that’s both too much and a cop out at the same time, just like when Cas said the same thing to him right before the fall. The question isn’t quite a trap, but there is a right answer there, something Cas is looking for, and if Dean ever really knew what that was then he can think of quite a few things over the last decade that would have gone differently.
“Jack is
It’s hesitant at first, Cas giving Dean a chance to set the pace, but when Dean shudders against him, pulling Cas in by the waist to deepen the kiss, Cas presses closer, dragging his hand up Dean’s wrist to cup his jaw, and tangling their fingers together with his other hand. It’s eager, but still soft, so gentle, in a way Dean really isn’t expecting. He always figured if this ever happened, then years of pent up frustration would take over, but it’s tender,
As an angel, Cas could be passive-aggressive, petty, and sarcastic. As a human, he has lost any angelic restraint he once had.
counts as coercion, but fine. “Yeah, why does it feel even harder when it’s someone else’s sacrifice?”
“We’re good, Cas,” Dean says, but there’s something he doesn’t like in the way Cas shifts in his seat and the way his breath hitches. There’s an undercurrent to this conversation that feels like it has the potential to drag him down.
Conveniently, he finds both coffee and Cas in the kitchen, luckily without Bobby and crew. Cas is leaning against the sink with a bottle of water, in a tracksuit, sweaty from a run. He wears tracksuits now, and he runs, possibly more than Sam does.
Castiel flinches. He was going to leave a note. He wasn't sure yet what it was going to say. "I’m telling you now,” he says again. “And…” he hesitates; it’s a lot to ask, but “...I need you to not tell Jack that you know.”
“Oh.” Dean’s thrown a little by that, and kicking himself. This is Cas’s first hunt since...yeah.  He should have checked in more, not thought so much about himself. They haven’t really talked about it, at least not since Cas got out of bed and decided if he was going to be human, he was going to do it well.
He can blame Cas, a little, for thinking what he thought, but only a little. He can blame himself more, but what’s the point of that? He owes it to Cas not to fall into the pit of self-loathing now, owes him that too, and that might be the barometer he’ll be using for everything for the rest of his life.
, where his ambient and instinctive awareness of Dean had once kept him moving for an entire year.
Sam shakes his head. “No, it’s just…”
“No,” Cas says, quietly, glancing at Dean out of the corner of his eye, and then looking down.
That’s all. Just things they happened to have lying around.
“Fucking perfect,” Dean mutters under his breath, staring out at the forest. They’re in a clearing, and not much is visible beyond the dense tree line. Castiel watches him scan their surroundings. Dean shifts, almost unconsciously, to a defensive stance and hefts the weight of the blade in his hand, tense and poised for a fight, already recalibrating for the hypervigilance of Purgatory.
They discharge him after surgery to remove most of his broken knee cap, with crutches, a knee brace, a referral to a doctor in Kansas, a physical therapy protocol, and several types of medication for the headaches.
Castiel pulls him closer. “I have
“How do you know? You don’t know the difference. I don’t think I ever really got used to it the first time.”
“I’m fine, Dean,” Cas says, swigging the whiskey Dean sets next to him on the counter.  They have real antiseptic now, of course, but you can’t drink the antiseptic, so whiskey is still a key part of the process.
Dean gets that none of his jokes are going to land. “Hey,” Dean says again, turning his wrist a little, so Cas’s hand will slide down his arm and their fingers brush. “Thank you. You probably saved my life, for about the millionth time.”
For the second time tonight, he reaches down deep, pulling from a well he's terrified is empty. His grace fizzles at his fingertips, sputtering before a weak spark finally catches. He watches the skin in Dean’s side knit back together until Dean inhales sharply and opens his eyes.
And so after they found Cas, when it turned out he’d heard everything anyway, Dean locked all that shit
if that’s not the most romantic thing Dean has ever heard in his life. It should probably be terrifying. The fact that Dean is still actually kind of convinced that there’s no way Cas loves him more than he loves Cas is evidence of just how far gone he is.
“I’m here,” Castiel says, and Dean nods against his shoulder.
“Leave it,” he says, not meaning for it to sound harsh, but it comes out abrupt in the silence.
“I know. I do too.”
want you here.”
in this situation?”
The silence of the bunker in the early morning hours is a silence Castiel knows well. He has spent so much time here, like this, with only the hum of the generator for company while his family sleeps.
Dean scoffs and waves him off. “I don’t need a baby-sitter, Sammy. You stay here and manage the hunter army. I just need to get out of here for a bit; send me the info while I pack.”
He flushes when he catches what he said, but Cas just rolls his eyes. “You let him drive the impala, Dean. I think you’re the fun dad.”  He pauses and purses his lips. “Also, I think we may have a skewed definition of fun.”
Dean looks back, and whatever Cas sees makes him flinch away.
“I don’t know,” Dean says. “Maybe. Sometimes. If they’re paying attention.”
it meant it didn’t need to be a secret, so he still had a few things to learn about life in the Winchester family.
“Nope, no, we’re done here. Don’t talk to me about the internet; I don’t want to know what you found,” Dean says, and he flees for more pancakes.
which is 1) unhelpful and 2) just about all he’s capable of anyway. He’s been reactive for so long, hanging on a knife’s edge of desperation and limited choices, that he’s a little afraid it’s all he’s ever been capable of.
Dean flinches, and Cas eyes him cautiously. The Empty Deal is the other thing they don’t talk about. Cas knows he knows, but it’s never felt like a good time to really bring it up. It hadn’t ended up mattering in the end, so Dean hasn’t known quite how to explain the way it eats at him, the knowledge of the narrowly averted crisis festering under his skin. It makes him wonder what else he doesn’t know, and whether he’ll have any warning the next time the rug gets ripped out from under him.
; Chuck’s gone -
And it’s not that Dean doesn’t know Cas loves him. He has been paying attention for the last decade and change. But Cas is also impulsive and opaque. He has his own agenda and obligations, and even when Dean
Dean tries to smile, but he’s a little afraid it comes out as more of a grimace. “Me too. Did you at least get the poltergeist?” He means it as a joke, something to lighten up the intense way Cas is just staring at him, but Cas stiffens beside him instead.
Apparently not, because Cas is leaning against Baby when Dean gets to the garage about an hour later. He’s wearing one of Dean’s old flannels rolled up to the elbow and the jeans he bought on the last Walmart run that hug the curve of his thighs. Dean’s not sure how you even find jeans that fit that well at Walmart, but that’s what happens when you let Rowena come shopping. The effect is something Dean is still adjusting to.
She makes no secret that she thinks they’re a couple of dumbasses, and she wasn’t even swayed by the Winchester name since she’s not really that plugged into, or impressed by, the hunter community. She knows her hodags, though, and she’s been a wealth of information that Dean passed on to Sam.
Dean steps back from carving another X into a tree. “I wish we had Benny,” he says. Castiel does too, actually. Benny had been difficult, and his camaraderie with Dean had left Castiel on edge with something he hadn’t understood at the time and now recognizes as jealousy, but he’d had an innate sense of direction in this place, born either of time or of actually belonging here.
“And then they die again. It’s a thing. Trust me.”
Which, fair.)
Dean swallows thickly and lets go of one of Cas’ hands to reach up and rub at his eyes. His fingertips come away wet, and he doesn’t know when he teared up again. All of his nerves are scraped raw. He drops his hand back onto the table, and Cas takes it again, his eyes wide and searching, waiting for something.
It turns out he doesn’t have a chance to decide.
tired of deathbed confessions,” he says, stepping back into the room. They stare at each other at each other and Castiel blinks first. “I love you,” he adds, helplessly, cutting right to complicated, twisted up core of it. He’s said it before - they’ve both said it now. He’s not sure what Dean will let it mean, or what he himself even needs it to mean. There are intricacies of human emotion that still leave him reeling, but he likes the warmth he sees on Dean’s face.
“What deal?” Sam asks, voice tight, and Dean lets Jack answer that one.  He was there, after all. Jack explains haltingly, providing more context than Dean was given in those few, life-altering minutes - the Empty infiltrating Heaven, the fight. The deal. The temporary reprieve.
“No. Slow us down, maybe.”
“Hey bud, you missed a spot,” Dean said, reaching out hesitantly to brush at the smear of shaving cream on Cas’s jaw, then leaning in with a little more confidence when Cas didn’t pull away.
“Yeah, it’s nothing. I’ve had way worse.”  He cracks a smile in Cas’s direction, but it falls a little flat when Cas just scowls at him as if to indicate just how low
“If he wants to be.”
Cas shrugs. “It’s a milk run.”
“Okay, but don’t you fight enough monsters?”
Turns out, when you fall three stories, knock your head on a marble buffet table, impale yourself on a rotting piece of broken wood, and shatter your knee cap, recovery is slated to take awhile. Dean’s not sure if he’s unlucky that he managed to somehow hit that fun combo or extremely lucky that he’s not in a coma, the rotting wood missed any vital organs, and the doctors say there’s a good chance he’ll recover most movement.
Cas nods and Dr. Fischer’s face shutters a little. “Good,” she says, then shakes it off, back to business.
Cas tilts his head in an echo of the way he used to look at Dean when he didn’t get a reference or was trying to work out why the weird humans say the things they say, but there’s something so raw in his eyes that Dean has to be the one to look away. “For what?” Cas asks, like a dare, and waits.
“Right,” Dean says and pushes himself out of his chair to go find coffee and maybe talk to Cas about the Jack thing.
“You mean the helplessness, while you just wait, and watch? I do, actually,” he bites out, a little mean. “Welcome to humanity, buddy.”
Dean takes a deep breath, and then a plunge. “What did you mean when you told Jack angels feel love differently?”
Castiel is a hypocrite.
Navigation is difficult in Purgatory. It looks like an Earth forest on the surface, if colder and strangely empty, but there’s a repetitiveness to the landscape upon closer inspection. Like Heaven or Hell, it becomes an undifferentiated maze that makes it difficult to find your way unless you know what you’re looking for. And they don’t, really. Dean is carving X’s into the trees as they pass to mark their path. Castiel is carefully watching for any landmarks, and carefully watching the time.
? Why?”
happy before coming for me. I didn’t tell you and I asked Jack not to tell you. I know your and Sam’s history with...deals. It didn’t seem like an imminent threat at the time.” He raises one eyebrow, sardonic and self-deprecating. “It still doesn’t. And if Chuck gets his way, we may not live long enough for it to matter, but you deserve to know. It’s not fair for you not to know.”
, Dean thinks, but no one says.
“I can heal that,” Cas says. He nods to indicate Dean’s temple, and Dean reaches up, prodding just below his hairline where it’s still tender, a low ache that’s in the early stages of building to a migraine.
“So the first person to touch the victim who has taken a human life is next in line,” Rowena summarizes. There’s a lengthy pause, and then she sighs. “
“I don’t…” he starts, at the same time as Cas says -
, and Dean feels like he’s going to shake out of his skin.
“Feel more what?”
“What’s got you all antsy?” Dean finally asks. “Spit it out.”
Dean fiddles with Cas’ phone. “We all missed it. And maybe we shouldn’t have been thinking more outside the box, but we all expected it to go after me next. We all thought it was Alexis. How could you have known?”
However, the wound in his side is infection free and healing cleanly. Getting impaled by a rotting piece of wood was, quite literally, the least of his problems, so he’s got that going for him. No one appreciates that observation either.
“Hey,” Sam says, not looking up.
Castiel does, and when he crosses the room Dean slides over to one side of the bed. There’s only the one pillow, but Castiel is surprised when Dean pushes it over to him and tugs on his arm to get him to lie down. When he does, Dean rolls toward him, sliding one arm over his waist to they’re pressed up together, Castiel on his back with Dean’s head on his shoulder.
“Does it hurt? You’re not sick again? I’m sorry I didn’t...” Dean breathes out harshly and looks down, tapping his knuckles against the closed laptop. Castiel has things he wants to say about the last few months, and things he still wants Dean to say. He doesn’t know what to do with the Purgatory confession. That's the kind of thing they usually just let slide. He's not sure he can do that this time, but he also doesn’t want Dean’s guilt. Guilt has never really helped either of them.
Dean makes a
stop him if you wanted to. I don’t think any of us can, if he’s committed to it. But yes. I think it would kill you to do it, but I think you would do whatever you had to. But I’m not gonna let it get to that point.”
The harm is the blow to morale for Dean and Sam when they can least afford it.
“It’s nothing with Chuck. And it’s nothing we have to worry about tonight. But I think you should know.” Cas pauses, collecting his thoughts. “Do you remember, when I came back from the Empty, I told you I annoyed an ancient cosmic entity into letting me go?”
They reached for the glass at the same time, fingers brushing against it. Cas moved to let go and push it toward Dean, but Dean kept a grip on his hand, tangling their fingers until Cas turned toward him, curious.
They stumble back through the woods to the car, Cas leaning on Dean’s shoulder, and Dean muttering under his breath about
“I’ll let you sleep.” Castiel turns to go. He probably should sleep too, actually. He knows where the sheets and the guest rooms are. He doesn’t really want to. He hasn’t really had to since he was sick with the stolen grace, and while he hadn’t minded it as a human, as an angel he doesn’t like it. Angels don’t dream and the loss of consciousness and missing, wasted time leave him disoriented, but with his grace this depleted, he knows his body needs it.
“Yeah, if I didn’t know better, I’d say possession,” Stevie says, closing Cas’s folder, and sitting back in the booth to cross her arms over her chest.
“Hey,” Dean says. He reaches out, hesitantly, and puts one hand on Cas’s knee. Cas’s jeans are caked with graveyard mud. “I’m okay. I’m pretty used to getting banged up by ghosts.”
between them is starting to seem truly possible now, when happiness is forbidden and it’s already too late.
These are the kinds of questions that keep Dean up at night when he’s not already being kept up at night by the end of the world. Sometimes he’s not sure which he prefers.
“You just have to roll with it.”)
to argue with it. It feels like a betrayal not to get up off the damn floor and see this through.
Dean shrugs. “Sure, maybe; there’s a direct link between the victims, and in some cases the only link is physical proximity. But then why does it only jump to one person at a time? You’d think with a contagion we’d have an outbreak.”
“Hey,” he finally says. Cas hmms in his throat, both an acknowledgement and a dismissal. The scrape of a turned page is louder than it should be in the silence. Dean beelines for the whiskey.
. Cas comes in with another round of beers and distributes them before settling back on the floor, leaning against Dean’s chair. Dean squeezes his shoulder in thanks, and when he turns, Sam is just watching them, carding his fingers through Eileen’s hair. Sam quirks an eyebrow when their eyes meet, and Dean turns back to the movie.
, of course. Dean wonders, sometimes, if there’s some vestige of his angelic senses left, some instinct inside him that still feels whatever pull used to draw him to Dean’s side, because whenever Dean does actually
Cas shrugs. “But it seems like a lot of work for someone you’ll never see again. I don’t really understand the appeal of having that kind of intimacy be so fleeting, when you don’t know the other person and can’t really tell them anything real. I was curious. When I was an angel, I didn’t really understand what you get out of that type of liaison, though you seem to enjoy it. I thought maybe I would feel differently now.”
Dean makes eye contact with Cas, who just shrugs, also looking bewildered.
Sam softens, and leans forward a little. “Dean, you don’t have to hunt. You don’t have to do anything. Eileen and I aren’t really hunting, and I’m not in any hurry to get back out there, but I think someone still should. There’s still work to do.There’s still so much we don’t know about this place - the records, the artifacts. Now that there’s finally time to go through it, I just… I want to
There are good days. Dean is
Gee. Wonder where he got that.
They end up at a diner in a town that’s little more than a wide spot in the road on the Kansas/Colorado border. The diner itself has seen better days, all cracked linoleum and creaking vinyl, but the the coffee is serviceable, they have a bacon cheeseburger, and it gives them a minute to stretch their legs and get a little distance. Dean will take it, even if Sam makes a face at the “salad” options.
Dean gets one hand under Castiel’s shirt (it’s Dean’s shirt, he’s in Dean’s clothes, after all that mess of the Empty, and even that sends a thrill through him now).  Dean’s hand is a brand against Castiel’s bare skin. His other hand, still on Castiel’s jaw, is a demand, and Castiel wants to demand right back, demand everything he thought he could never have, that is now somehow miraculously already his. He doesn’t have much experience with this, but he doesn’t really feel like he needs it, not here with Dean pliant against him, everywhere they touch sending sparks through his new human senses.
Who didn’t...
The consensus is that if anybody DID see anything, it was these two guys who live on a horse ranch outside of Mesilla. They’re quiet, keep to themselves, but they seem to be who you call when you have questions about livestock deaths, either from sickness or animal attacks.
, and isn’t that surprising - but right now he just wants Cas against his lips and under his hands, moving relentlessly between his thighs.
He swears he can feel the echo of the old scar on his arm underneath the bloody handprint.
“I hope you’re not regretting your choice already,” Dean says, something dry and a little pained in his voice.
“Maybe not. But I should have told you.” He holds up one hand when Dean starts to interject. “And I know you forgive me, and I accept your apology too,
“What happened? Where’s Cas?”
, specifically.
“You need to rest. I healed the worst of the internal bleeding and the blood loss, but I know…” he trails off.
“Are you okay?”
Sam holds up his hands in surrender, gracious in his overall victory.
“Chuck, then?”  Sam reaches out to put one hand on Dean’s forearm, and Dean lets him, takes a breath in the grounding touch.  He shakes his head again. He can’t. He
He pushed them all as hard as he could, through exhaustion and pain and walls of monsters, because if there was a moment when anything was quiet or still he couldn’t even talk to Cas to distract himself, even though Cas was
Jesse squints at him for a moment, and then a broad smile takes over his face as he leans in the door frame and crosses his arms over his chest. “Dean Winchester? Well, I’ll be damned. If you came out here for that chupacabra, I’m afraid you wasted a trip. We took care of that a few days ago. But why don’t you come on in?”
“You’ve always told me I should make it more my own.”
It feels a little like closure, too, the good kind, a step forward. It’s just that Dean’s never really trusted closure. It never really works like it’s supposed to - after all those years and all that pain, Chuck is just gone; Heaven and Hell are sealed, it’s
“Can’t. Don’t know how anyone else
Dean pours himself a cup of coffee and blurts out, “Did you know Jack’s going vampire hunting?”  before taking a sip.
“I did.”
knowing you, not getting in your head and fucking around in your memories and trying to be what you want. It’s them really seeing you, and wanting to be with you anyway. And you see them for who they are and want to be with them anyway. You’re safe with them, and you trust them to be there for you, you want to be there for them.”
If Cas ever goes home with anyone again, he doesn’t do it where Dean can see.
“Dean,” he says, and waits until Dean looks at him. “For what it’s worth - that day at the portal. Confronted with a situation like that now, I would make a very different choice.” He doesn’t say “I’m sorry,” because he’s not, exactly. He’d done the best he could at the time, and other than protecting Dean, penance had seemed like the only right option. It had seemed like
She leans against the sink with folded arms, eyes darting back and forth between Dean and Cas. It doesn’t strike Dean as a very doctorly pose. Then she sighs.
Dean takes a deep breath and doesn’t move his hand. They stay that way, drinking coffee and staring at the limitless horizon as the sky lightens.
“I know, but I…” Dean starts, at the same time Castiel says:
it now, watching the shift in Dean’s face from concern, to disbelief, to dismay.
wanted to leave you.”
And they’re alone in the bunker for an unknown amount of time. He pushes up on one elbow, leaning down over Cas because it’s barely early afternoon; the day stretches out before them, and they have plenty of time for the fancy stuff. Cas leans up for a kiss, and they’re off again.
“Do we?” Dean asks, and he’s being sarcastic, but also honest. Angel hearts aside and all the best intentions, Jack’s still a wild card. May always be a bit of a wild card.
When he looks over again, Cas meets his eyes, and this time neither of them looks away. It doesn’t feel anything like normal, but at least Dean can see that Cas means it when he nods again and says, “We stay together.”
“What?”
“Cas. How can I help?” Dean is trying so hard. Castiel can see the struggle, the part of him that wants to argue, pushed down so that this parting is as gentle as it can be. It makes Castiel ache.
“Okay, then. Tell Sam to find us another case,” Cas says, and turns back to his lasagna.
“It probably would work for me,” Cas says, quietly.
“We don’t both have to go.” Cas’ voice is tight, and when Dean turns toward him he’s watching the rift too, fists clenched.
Dean spends all his time on research until his eyes itch and blur. It’s not his favorite part of the job under the best of circumstances, and he can feel himself getting short-tempered and impatient. Cas is back and forth between the bunker and heaven and tracking down angels on Earth, but he doesn’t turn up much. He finds Anael where she’s gone to ground, working at a boutique tea and herb shop for the kind of people who wish they were witches and stealthily keeping up her healing business on the side, but she knows even less than they do. He tries to find Michael and Adam, but they’re in the wind, unlikely to be found unless they want to be.
And he’s pathetically grateful for it in the week that follows, since it means either Sam or Cas is with him most of the time. He feels guilty for the amount of time they’re spending perched at his hospital bed, but he selfishly doesn’t want them to go.
He pours more whiskey into his glass and drops his forehead against the hotel room window with a thud. Behind him, Sam is drumming his fingers on the table and clearing his throat, like he’s gearing up to say something he thinks Dean is going to react badly to. So he probably is.
It looks pretty much as described - a victim that looks like he had his eyes burned (fine, no demons, but goddamn), a perpetrator huddling in the corner and shaking, lashing out at anyone who comes near, looking pale and drawn, and bleeding from the eyes.
He doesn’t know everything the future holds, but if it’s just this, it’s enough. Dean was always enough, but this is more.
"You can't be serious. Like I'm not worried about everything, all the time?  Like it wouldn't worry us to wake up and find you gone?"
“You’ll live,” Sam says. “Though they weren’t totally sure until the swelling in your brain went down. You scared me, Dean. And you
They’re all Winchesters, after all.
Dean does, depositing Cas in the back seat and breaking a bunch of traffic laws to get back to the motel. He’s tempted to go to the hospital then, but his hunter instincts override the frantic impulse. They look a mess, and hospitals are too many questions, even if this is Cas’s first major human injury, and he’s looking woozy in the streetlights, getting blood all over the back seat of the Impala.
Sometimes the bunker feels huge and echoing. It’s possible for Sam and Dean to go days without really seeing each other, and Dean knows from experience that that’s still possible even with four people in the place.
Dean may be back in the fight, but that doesn’t mean he’s not going to call this what it is. They still can’t win this, but sure, if there’s a chance they can make a difference in the losing or take Chuck down with them, then they wouldn’t
Their patient zero, Eric Bond, had always been the outlier of the victims. Definitely a dick, but the kind of dick who was a lawyer for criminals rather than outright being one himself.
“Yeah, it’s fine,” Dean echoes, and pops open another beer.
“No, not in words. But I’m sensing some turmoil.”
“Good for him,” Cesar says and Dean laughs.
Cas has relaxed a bit, since Sam has been true to his word and is keeping them updated at regular intervals.
. Jack mumbles something and heads for the bathroom, so Dean and Cas are left sitting across from each other in the booth, not really making eye contact.
“I know. They were part of Metraton’s brain dump, but knowing is not the same thing as seeing.”
used to it. Needing to manage things like appropriate amounts of sleep and the effects of low blood sugar apparently did require a learning curve, but it set off a twinge of guilt all the same. He’d never really forgiven himself for the first time.
Dean sighs. “Yep. That could go wrong." He pauses and then asks more softly, "What can I do?”
Dean had to laugh at the despondent look on Cas’s face when he turned around.
Dean shudders, one hand pushing into his side. “How much time do we have?”
“What is it?” Jack asks, but Sam just looks at him and shakes his head and Jack falls quiet again.
He trails off then, and Castiel thinks it’s over, or he’s passed out, but then Dean’s voice comes again, more softly.
Dean walked into the bathroom to find Cas wrapped in a towel, staring at his reflection in the mirror speculatively.
“I’ve loved you for a quarter of my life,” Dean says, into the silence, and tries not to flinch, saying that out loud for the first time. “You’ve known me for the cosmic equivalent of less than five minutes. That can’t carry the same weight. I’m not doubting you. I’m not questioning that you want to be here.  I’m not questioning that we matter to you, that you,” he swallows, “love us, but...”
It comes out in a rush. They stare at each other for a moment, and Castiel can’t hear anything now over the rushing in his ears. Then Dean draws another shuddery breath.  He’s still looking Castiel right in the eye, pinning him here in this chair in the dark of the library.  Dean says, “I love you.  Of
It was clever of his family, really. He’s proud of them, all of them - his human family and even his obnoxious brother, because Michael came through. It was a good plan - wake up all of the angels, break them out, repopulate Heaven, and then lock it down, leave Earth to the humans, finally. At last.
wasn't lying, there you go." They stare at each other for a moment, tight and tense. Cas opens his mouth like he's going to say something else, then snaps it shut again, closing his eyes and looking away, seeming to brace himself. Dean braces himself in turn.
. He saying, again,
“No. I’m not in pain. I don’t feel sick or even physically weakened that much beyond...it’s like I reach for my grace and I feel it but I can’t… I feel more…” he trails off again, out of words to explain the way his grace just won’t respond, the control and effort it’s started to take to do things that were once as natural as blinking or breath.
“That’s pretty much what happened. But the entity wasn’t happy about it. Not then, and not later.” Cas sighs, looking down at the table where their hands are joined. “Then, when Jack died, the first time, and I went to find him in Heaven, there was a fight. Jack was part angel and part human. Both Heaven and the Empty wanted him, and the entity invaded Heaven. It killed a bunch of angels before it caught up with us. It had a claim on him, and it would have taken him.”
“Good,
in Dean’s eyes, and then, nothing, nothing, nothing until the infiltration of the Empty and this, choosing Dean again, because he always will.
Castiel turns around and the Leviathan are on him.
“Why did it even work?” Sam asks, either ignoring the tension or just powering through. Dean’s starting to understand how Sam’s managed a lot of the last ten years by just pretending he doesn’t notice things. “He’s all powered up, and we know siren venom doesn’t work on angels.”
By wordless agreement they turn back the way they came.
“Goddamnit,” Dean swears, turning to drop the whiskey bottle onto the table with an audible thud. “He just wasn’t going to tell us?” He asks more quietly, with his back to Castiel.
“I know. It was logical. How could we have known the siren wouldn’t find it worthwhile to go after you?”
Cas stiffens and drops his hand. “We do,” he says, evenly, staring at the wall, “but he’s still half human and I guess that was enough.”
“Do you care?”
“I like what you’ve done here. This is...I see why this is what you all wanted.”
, Sammy.”  And he didn’t, or at least not intentionally, though admittedly he hasn’t done much of anything with any real intention for a while now. “It’s a ghost, right? Salt and burn. I’ll be back by dinner.”
again.
And if it also means that Heaven and Hell are sealed now, that the whole universe is “closed to the divine” (according to Donatello) and that every demon was spontaneously exorcised (good) and every angel left on Earth had their grace burned out of them from the inside (not good), well. No one told them that part, but cosmic consequences. Is there any other kind?
the comfort food, and the beer, and the television, and the computer, and then making him eat vegetables. Sam gets mad, and then sad, when Dean’s too resistant; he says, “Jesus, will you just let me take care of you for once?” and Dean doesn’t have an answer.
Dean knows Cas is annoyed he didn’t wait for backup, but he also figures partly the problem is just that they’re constantly tripping over each other. They’ve never really spent so much extended, unbroken time together. Dean’s never actually spent so much extended, unbroken time with
Cas stares at Dean and the whiskey and rocks glasses he’s balancing and then just shrugs and gestures him into the room.  Dean comes to a dead stop in the middle of the room and sits down hard on the chair next to the bed, dropping the whiskey bottle on the bedside table with a sharp clang, and trying to remember the last time he was actually in this room.
Cas huffs a disbelieving laugh and drops his head to rub at his temple. The gesture is so simple and so human that Dean has to swallow around the lump in his throat. When Cas looks up, his expression has softened into something like resigned disappointment, which might be even worse than everything that came before. “I know,” he says. “But thank you for saying it.”
“Not in those words. But look, that last case was a blow, I know. For him, and for all of us.” Dean knows that’s less true for Sam than for the rest of them, but Sam gets points for tact. “He needs a little space and to get his confidence back. He needs to feel like we trust him to handle himself.”
Dean’s breath eventually evens out, and Castiel curls even closer, closing his eyes in the darkness, and letting himself sleep.
Castiel got everything so wrong. He did not anticipate that he would be the one doing the soothing in this conversation, at least not like this. He squeezes Dean’s hip in reassurance.  “I won’t,” he says, “Never on purpose, not ever again.”
When Dean gets them back to the motel and gets Cas’s shirt off in the light, it’s not as bad as he thought. He’s patched up worse, on Sam and his dad and Bobby. Even on himself in a pinch.
Touche.
There are some things Castiel has been trying not to think too hard about, since Purgatory - how Dean is committed to demonstrating that he trusts him, how hard Dean is
It’s still not quite the right question, but Dean’s terrified of asking the right questions. What if he still doesn’t like the answers?
, but Castiel hears it anyway.
Dean laughs a little at that realization and takes another swig of his beer. “Well, anything he told you is almost definitely true.”

, you know?  If I can help coordinate, and if there are resources here for other hunters, it just seems like that’s a good next step. Mia says that it’s good to have work that feels valuable, and I just feel like...we didn’t have the hunter community growing up, but it is a community and maybe we should have. Maybe we’d have been less isolated. If I can help give that to people now, I think it’s what I want to do.”
Cas sighs.  “I’m just saying.  He was interesting. I liked talking to him.  Maybe I should have known. Maybe I should have seen that he was particularly appealing to my interests, and that’s on me, but I wasn’t even thinking about kissing him. That’s not the kind of thing I usually…” He trails off, seeming frustrated. “I don’t always pick up on human romantic...signals in the moment.”
“I’m here to help,” Cas says. “I’ll see this through.” He squeezes Dean’s shoulder again, and then he’s gone.
He should have known better than to try to sleep the night before the big fight. It wasn’t his first last night on Earth, but he’d never really been able to relax on the cusp on something like that. There were too many what-ifs in his head - all the ways it could go wrong, and the uncertainty of what would happen if it actually went right.
“That was fifteen years ago, Dean. A lot has changed since then.”
They get through two movies, and Cas is engaged, at least enough to spend most of the movie questioning the judgement of every character on the screen, but his phone is on his other side, and he’s checking it periodically.
means.
Night falls like a curtain, shutting out the light. Castiel digs the flashlight out of the front pocket of the duffle, keeping his knife held at ready in his other hand, and they move back toward the portal, shoulder to shoulder.
“But I remembered a lot.” Cas glances up at Dean. “Too much for a human mind to hold, it seems. It’s strange what’s right on the edges.” He reaches one hand to rub at his temple and then drops it next to him on the car near where Dean’s hand is resting.  Their fingers brush lightly.
“Hey. I’m glad you’re awake.”
“I’ll be there the entire time, Dean. I can keep an eye on him. But we have to give a little bit of room to help, and to feel like he’s part of this team, not just someone we have to protect.”
They’re sitting on the porch, staring out at the desert, the sky lit brightly with stars, clear and endless, in that way it only is this far out west and away from the cities. It reminds him of the ocean, a little, in the way it feels like you can see forever.
(Dean said that to Cas, once, and Cas, newly human and still sweating out the fever of his burned out grace, had just blinked at Dean blearily from the nest he’d made of every spare blanket in the bunker and said, “Your life has been very challenging, and I don’t think you have a normal definition of ‘easy’,” before passing out again.
They go in as Fish and Wildlife Services since, thankfully, there haven’t been any human attacks - just goats, and cows, and the occasional horse. At first it seems like nobody’s really seen anything, and the locals are assuming these are wolf kills. It’s one of those times when Dean figures they’ll have to be careful not to run into the actual Fish and Wildlife Service officers.
“No,” Cas says, smiling softly, seemingly oblivious to Dean’s internal turmoil, though there’s something concerned in his eyes, when he turns to look at Dean before gazing back out over the water. “I feel so much more now, more deeply and more immediately, and maybe that’s the trade. I regret how it happened, but I’m at peace with the outcome.”
“Cas. Wait.” He turns back around. Dean’s just watching him, like he’s deciding what he’s going to say. “I’m so tired,” he finally says. Castiel waits as instructed. “Just..in every way and of everything, I'm so tired." He pauses, and then breathes out harshly and continues. "I’m too rung out to talk tonight. I won't say anything right. But I know we should. And I’m also too tired to pretend this,” he gestures between them “isn’t what it is.” He’s staring at Castiel a little like a challenge, and Castiel doesn’t totally know what to
“I know that, but why would anyone go
Cas sighs again. “Dean, I'm not being...flippant or rash.
“Do you want company?” he asks quietly. Dean can only make a slight affirming noise, afraid to move too much because any movement at all threatens to exacerbate the pain. He doesn’t, really, want company in general, but it’s okay that Cas is there, offering silent comfort. Cas turns toward him and puts one hand on Dean’s shoulder, rubbing his thumb back and forth, a calming, grounding pressure, until Dean sleeps.
bar is.
.  (Cas doesn’t eat, but he sure does leave coffee mugs everywhere). It’s kind of reassuring though, the constant, visible, kind of annoying reminders of his family around him, even if they are still treading carefully, talking about Chuck, and whatever Jack is watching on Netflix, and not much else.
Castiel nods. “Anything from Sam?”
Dean looks over at Cas, pouring through his notes on the laptop. “Cas thinks touch, and he’s probably right, but it always only affects one person at a time, and it’s not the first person who touches them after, and there’s not necessarily a connection other than proximity.”
Cas shakes his head. “No. I didn’t. I would have, I think. But I didn’t.” Dean squeezes his knee, not sure how to respond. Team Free Will, right? They’re such a fucking mess.
When Dean turns back around, Castiel forces himself to meet Dean’s eyes. There’s anger there, and pain, and something that looks a little like desperation too. That’s the conversation Castiel really didn’t want to have - the one about how this already was their "other way," about how they’re running out of options and they’re running out of time.
After everything went bad, but before it went nuclear, when Dean was spiraling, Cas looked at him and said, “we are real.” Dean still doesn’t quite know what that means or which way is up, or how much of their heads and histories have been fucked with, but there are things that he can choose. He can choose what he believes in. He can choose how to react.
Claire reminds him there are no demons anymore, and assures him they know better than to actually read the symbols out loud.
They had a run-in with a ghoul outside Atlanta a week ago; they’d split up to do recon and when Dean had a break in the case he went out to the cemetery alone when Cas didn’t answer his phone fast enough, leaving Cas a voicemail about where to find him. Everything worked out fine, minus a few more mild bumps and bruises, but Cas has been snippy with Dean ever since.
The worst thing about that year was the nights.
“How is he doing?” Dean asks, to break the silence. Only Cas has really had any time alone with Jack since everything went down.
Sam smirks at him. “I’m just saying. I’ve been on the receiving end of that kind of worry, and it can be a lot. I know there are things we need to figure out, but let me do this. Let him do this. Eileen, Jack, and I can handle a couple of ghosts.”
