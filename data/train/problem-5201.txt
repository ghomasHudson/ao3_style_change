Tony glanced in the direction of the sitting room. It hadn’t occurred to him before that he didn’t know what kind of wedding Steve might want. They hadn’t planned on a wedding for a wedding’s sake, so it hadn’t seemed important at the time, but this wasn’t exactly something they’d do together twice.
“If it’s so little you’re not sure,” Tony murmured, drowsy in his afterglow, “it’s not serious, Steve… feel fine, I promise, babe…”
Steve’s mouth twisted around the impulse to correct the use of ‘prostitute,’ but tried for a more subtle way to address it. “His accountants would be aware if he regularly employs high-end sex workers. Do we have access to his financial history?”
“The premiere? That’s what you’re thinking about?” Bucky muttered, clearly unimpressed. “Steve, you know how long it takes me to compose a tweet. Now the whole world is going to have an opinion before me. You couldn’t have given me a heads up?”
Orfeo trailed off in silence, not unlike a man struggling to find his way through a haze. Tony watched him patiently, avoiding glancing at distractions like his watch or his phone while he gave Orfeo time to clear his thoughts.
“I’m nervous of asking you this,” Graham said to Miriam through quiet laughter. “But don’t you have a similar story where you met an American man in Cambridge?”
From a hazy distance, Tony thought he heard someone calling his name. Did he care? He sniffed and turned away from the sound, crowding against the firm warmth pressed against him. The smell was familiar and reassuring, and as a gentle touch eased him back to restful calm, he found himself naturally drifting further and further from consciousness.
The man let Tony balance against his arm while unlocking his door, and it took him a minute to realize Mr. Perfect was patting Marple with his free hand. He shrugged inwardly; at least one of them enjoyed Mr. Perfect’s love today.
Steve folded himself into the passenger seat in the squad car left for them. Tony watched as Steve tried to get comfortable, but the car simply wasn’t made for someone his size. He could either sit so his hip dug into the center console, or so his shoulder pressed into the passenger side window, and neither felt particularly comfortable. He never once complained, but Tony wasn’t blind to his discomfort.
,” Steve clarified with intentional enunciation. He took Tony by the shoulders and guided him to sit on the bed before he fell over. “What’s your earliest tomorrow, eight-fifty?”
“Broke contact?” Steve echoed in disbelief. “Contact? You call that—I haven’t touched you yet, what was that, Tony?”
Clint grabbed two cutting boards from a shelf near the grill. He put one board and a knife in front of Steve, and sat down with his own on his side of the table. “Alright, then we’ll put you to use: you wedge potatoes and slice onions. I got the rest.”
Their parents were good people and thankfully got along, but they rarely agreed and were even less helpful. You didn’t ask them for input unless you already knew what you needed and only wanted them to feel included.
They came to a meeting point for many of the different tunnels serving the city where there was enough space for the Scraps to have made camp. The smell was much worse here, but not with the smell of the sewers; Tony had felt himself growing numb to the stench of refuse after all this time walking over it, but now the large quantities of unclean human bodies, fresh garbage, and cooking meat almost brought Tony to his knees.
Tony glanced away from the menu to watch Steve. Tony had picked the restaurant, something well recommended that they could enjoy in town before taking a cab to the hotel. The restaurant staff had been kind enough to open the French doors to the balcony on the second floor so Tony and Steve could have a clear view of the river and the town without sitting on the patio. Although foot traffic along the patio was minimal, Tony would rather pay to avoid sitting where anyone could walk up to them or take their picture.
“I have to go,” Steve choked out, then quickly hugged Tony’s jacket to his chest. “Jacket. Drinks, go.”
“The movie starts in twenty minutes,” Steve said as they walked out to the elevator together. “We won’t have time for dinner before the movie. Will you be alright?”
“What—what are,” Tony tried to say, clearly aware enough to know Steve normally wouldn’t be so forgetful but too groggy still to form complete sentences. “I’m, I’m up, Steve, I’m—what’s up?”
“It’s a short about a kid who rescues a duck egg on his way to school, and on the way the egg hatches in his pocket. He can’t get rid of the duck because it imprints on him, so he tries to raise it secretly instead.”
Tony fingers curled into fists around Steve’s hair, pulling and pushing in turn, torn between wanting to make it last and make it good for Steve, too, and his rapidly mounting need to come. His resistance only lasted minutes, and all too soon, he was pushing Steve’s face down on his cock as his hips thrust up without abandon, pounding his cock into Steve’s hot, willing mouth until his hips snapped off the mattress with the force of his orgasm, filling Steve with his come.
“Sweetheart, if you only knew how happy you make me,” Steve whispered with tears gathering in his eyes.
mad, it won’t exactly get any better but maybe it’ll be easier; actually, you know what? I can just leave—”
“That’s not how this works,” Steve told him, then pursed his lips as he reconsidered. On second thought, he said, “That’s not how
He had so much to do! He needed clothes appropriate for a law firm, shoes—a briefcase! But most of all, he needed to call his ma and share the good news. They talked the whole drive out to the Beauty Oasis, where he talked Sam into leaving the shop for a few hours in Erin and Paulette’s capable hands to join him for his first serious law student shopping excursion.
“You are on site: the car is within a hundred yards of where you’re standing,” Tony informed him. “If you can’t get it out of there, radio back and I’ll blast it remotely. They cannot get their hands on that tech, do you copy?”
So much for leading the team, Steve mused ruefully to himself, but outwardly he nodded in the affirmative. It was, after all, better than anything he’d come up with himself and to the point. All he had to do was pull himself together, avoid all classic signs of anxiety or suspicious behavior, and try not to think about how there was a very real possibility that his closest friendship in this crazy new world could be irrevocably damaged if he said (or did) the wrong thing.
“Or you could put the phone down on speakerphone and let me eavesdrop,” Tony suggested in a conspiratorial whisper, making no effort to hide how amused he was. Steve snorted quietly and rolled his eyes to himself, but said nothing. Instead, he thumbed speakerphone on and put the phone down on the island counter to help Bucky unload his loot on the table.
Tony shot him a look and tried to brush his jab off. “Your job is serving booze, my job is knowing when someone’s trying to hide something. Bruce Wayne is hiding something.”
“Not just any flowers, Pep: special flowers that made Steve smile like it was Christmas or, like, like the flowers regularly volunteered at soup kitchens on weekends and still came home to rub his feet after a long day. And on a day when I’m away? That’s no coincidence, no fucking chance—”
“Not at all,” Steve said tersely, struggling to smile for him. “Come on, I’ve got a surprise for you.”
“Twenty life sentences, because of you. I dreamt of your pretty face every day on the ice, of pulling your pretty eyes out of your skull and snuffing your life out by pissing on your brain.”
“Do that again, pet,” Steve asked, as if there was a choice. As if Tony could have denied him. Tony squeezed his muscles around the full length of Steve’s cock again, holding it as long as he could. The come filling Tony’s ass seeped out, dribbling around Steve’s cock and down the crack of Tony’s ass.
“Private or privates? Cause for Stevie—” Bucky snickered - and held his M&Ms out of reach in a miraculous save when Steve swung around and smacked him in the face with a couch pillow.
“He’s only ‘better’? You’re practically glowing, pal. What kind of magic dick does this Steve have?”
“I said, right, Tony?” Bucky brushed off without so much as blinking. “Steve isn’t the most confident baker, he doesn’t just watch the Bake Off: he studies it. And I’d say it’s paying off. Don’t you think Steve’s big, robust buns would be great for any filling? Tuna or chicken,” he added a beat later almost as an afterthought, hooking his thumb back towards Clint.
“Where am I?” Tony had mumbled drowsily when Steve lifted one of Tony’s legs to rest against his shoulder.
“Professor Nigel Brandon recommended you for a current vacancy in our department,” Sam explained, exercising somewhat more patience than his counterpart. “If only half of what he says is true, the next ten minutes will be very good to you.”
Tony outright glared at their therapist, his fingers balling into fists against his knees, and for a moment Steve braced himself to grab him in case Tony tried to take a swing at Dr. Odinson.
“It’s for you,” Steve told him, and smiled to himself at the way Tony’s eyes grew wide with excitement. “I wanted to apologize for, you know. Earlier. If you wear that sort of thing.”
Steve blinked slowly and stared into the middle distance as he listened to Tony and Channing share a brief exchange that ended with a kiss. It was clearly a
“No, Tony—please,” Steve promised, walking towards him to close the space between them, but Tony stumbled back, not letting Steve anywhere near him.
“A real gentleman,” Tony promised, or at least that’s what he guessed judging by the way Steve laughed and listened attentively to his friends, didn’t shy away from eye-contact, and exuded a relaxed confidence with every delectable, well-defined muscle in his body. (Or, what of it Tony could see through his fitted Henley anyway.) “Great listener, even better story-teller.”
“They’re going to eat me alive,” Steve confided to the holographic projection of his husband later that night. Midnight was well past Steve’s bedtime, especially after such a tiring day, but since their wedding they hadn’t gone to bed without talking about their respective days. Tony’s vibrant holoprojection was so detailed and clear that it was easy to imagine Tony was cocooned in blankets and smiling back at him from the other side of bed when in reality he was in their bed at home in the palace.
“Paleontology?” Tony asked rhetorically, then shook his head. “I’m not looking, if that’s what you’re asking. I’m not interested in moving. Nothing beats this city.”
“In his defense,” Steve said once he had both of their attention, “I recognize that I have no experience.”
Steve hummed as he finished his last bite and washed it down with some Coke. “Won’t happen to you, Buck. You got me.”
A car pulled up in front of them, and before taking her ride, the young woman hugged and kissed Tony goodbye. He watched her go with a fond smile.
His only memory of the blast was the weightlessness of flight, and in the next heartbeat, his pain was no more.
For a long, quiet moment, Steve couldn’t bring himself to look away from the ring in its new place of honor. He bowed his head over Tony’s hand and pressed a kiss over the back of his hand.
Out of the shadows emerged unsavory men and women. They looked as if they were made from the darkness, with their dirty teeth and bloodied knuckledusters.
What had started as a plan to make a short video for Steve had turned into one of the hottest goddamn
“Fuck you,” Tony glowered, looming over Steve and pressing his fists against his hips for the added intimidation factor. He glared down at him in silence long enough so that Steve might observe just how upset Tony was with this whole situation. Then, in the same tone of anger, Tony muttered, “You hungry or something? I raided Kraft services.”
The video was taken in the dark, and fear pounded in Steve’s chest on high alert. It was too dark to make out anything but vague shapes, though Steve could make out some movement now and then in the silence.
When it was all said and done, neither of them moved. Steve should probably be heading in to take a shower, and Tony could have gone to his room to do anything he needed, but something about being silent together was really soothing Steve’s nerves and frustrations from the day.
“Whatever, boss. It’s your future divorce,” Sharon muttered, following his lead without another complaint.
Screw Paris, Rhodey was right, the tree house was perfect. Tony snatched up his phone and navigated to the bookmarked reservations page.
A part of Steve didn’t want to make it that easy for Tony to become important in his life again. Tony was a good man and an attentive friend, but Steve cared about him too deeply to act casually or treat him platonically in person. Even now, nearly a year after the fact, Steve couldn’t trust himself to put the breaks on if he saw Tony face to face. Tony would only have to smile at him to wrap Steve around his little finger.
All except Tony, of course, who cut a clear path through the bullpen to the conference room and stood on the threshold to announce himself with a loud knock on the open door.
“The house is big enough, Bruce, it’s not like my mom would throw my shit out just cause I haven’t visited in a few years.”
Steve stilled mid-hum with his teeth teasing at Tony’s nipple. He picked up his head and gave Tony a flat look.
Tony suspected few, if any, could ever muster genuine compassion for Women. He doubted he ever could himself.
Maya Hansen was a tall, beautiful woman with flawless skin and downcast eyes. On the outside she seemed to have everything going for her: a figure most would kill for and clothes so expensive even Steve, with his years of exposure to the designs of the rich and famous, had to take a second look.
Safe to say, Steve was their all-around biggest fan. He followed both the blog and their Twitter account, and if he had gone through and anonymously answered a few fan questions in his spare time, who could blame him?
“Does Preston’s account keep a record of his matches?” Bucky wondered, “or maybe their conversations?”
“Ahoy, land crabs!” someone called from the dark, “haven’t ya heard of the saying, ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’? We have no beef with your kind. Turn around now and nothing will change.”
“Carrying water home?” Tony asked rhetorically. “We will direct the water directly into the house: it will not be a pump, but a spout, and from it fresh water will fill any sink or tub. You will never have to carry water again. And, if you wish, build a fire under the bathing water such that you always have warm showers, if you wish it.”
“Do you have any plans for the weekend?” Jane asked, bouncing on the balls of her feet in her excitement. “Because if you don’t, we could do a double date! Maybe go bowling?”
He let Tony lead the way, and he did his best to ignore the unexpectedly domestic building they were walking into, if questionably shabby. They trudged up the stairs in silence, until Tony led them down the hallway to a door with a new welcome mat.
“Boy, that’s brisk—did you press the button? No? God, what good are you, girl?” he chided her playfully as they jaywalked like all self-respecting New Yorkers. His rotten little cotton-ball of perfection happily pranced ahead of him, so proud to lead the way with her toy lifted high. She was so pleased with herself, greeting the morning regulars like old friends she’d known since her days as a waddling pup bouncing along the trail chasing Tony’s shoe-laces.
Natasha shook her head, while Steve tried to will away a blush. “Um, no,” he said, glancing at his partner. “We can take some now?”
Steve didn’t look that convinced. “Do people announce engagements anymore? I thought only old world people did that.”
“Hey Steve,” he said, swaying a little on his feet before moving closer. Steve didn’t have the heart to offer a handshake, and he didn’t have the emotional buffer to offer a hug, and Tony’s nervous energy only worsened without a clear invitation.
“I know that look, Tony,” Steve warned him, biting his lip in an effort not to outright grin about it. “The kids’ll be back any minute—”
“Just call me when—call me when you can?” Tony’s voice sounded much closer, and Steve could only assume he’d been taken off of speakerphone. “The minute it’s done, Steve.”
“Tony?” he murmured, pushing himself up. He rubbed at his chest, pressing the heel of his palm against the mounting pressure choking him.
Dr. Odinson nodded and scratched some notes down for his reference. “To be clear, you have not been in a relationship in which you trusted your partner for eight years?”
The Boston Gazette was folded to the sixth page, and in big, bold lettering under the fold Steve read the shocking social gossip of the day over photos of himself and Tony, side-by-side.
. Days, weeks, maybe even months ago, Brock had planned this moment. How many nights had they spent together after Brock had decided Steve wasn’t good enough? How many times had Steve reminded Brock of how much he loved him without knowing the reply he got in return was a hollow lie?
“Pretty sure it’s one of the best moments of my life, ever,” Steve continued as he slowly lowered them into the warm, bubbling hot tub. He settled comfortably with Tony in his lap, positioning them so Tony had a direct view of Central Park through the floor to ceiling windows.
“My mommy says all penises are funny looking,” Arlene informed Tony, matter-of-factly, clearly happy to be educating Mr. Tony about something again. Tony had to cover his mouth to keep from outright laughing.
It was close enough to the truth that he suddenly couldn’t breathe without crying, the relief of saying the words he’d dreaded for so long overwhelming him to the point of tears. “I miss you so much,” he kept rambling even as Steve pulled him against his chest and held him close, gently cupping the back of his head so Tony felt held and supported in every way. “I’ve never been so happy, Steve, I’m so fucking scared. I don’t know—I don’t like this, I don’t like—”
The helicopters were not fast enough to pursue, but in the end it didn’t matter. Rhodes had reached the right people in time to shut down all movement in and out of Machtberg fast enough that they caught up with the twelve men who abducted Tony before they crossed the border.
“Mine,” Tony heard a deep voice rumble from all around him, and his eyelids fluttered open in an impossible act of obedience. Through the haze of spiraling desire Tony stared up at the god that was his Steve.
“I feel unwell, Steve Rogers,” Tony choked out while trying not to breathe. “The smell of, of burning cannibalized meat.”
“I might know something about what you’re talking about,” he replied under his breath, “and it’s all thanks to this man I found who listens to me, respects me, and who never lets me forget what it feels like to be loved.”
“He lives in the building, you know,” Bucky said into the awkward silence left by the highly skilled people who had no idea how romance worked. “We could get killed any day. Why are you wasting time? Tell him how you feel.”
“If you would just—” Steve shut up abruptly, setting his jaw and wringing his hands on the wheel. Tony watched him like a hawk, waiting for the truth to spill out of him now that he’d gone as far as to raise his voice, but it seemed Steve stuck the landing and managed to calm himself again.
Before he could think of a meaningful response, Tony seemed to remember why he was there in the first place and he spun on his heels to grab a stool - not for himself, but for Steve.
“Clint, Steve looks upset,” they heard Tony’s voice calling from not too far away. “Why are you upsetting Steve? Dad already gave him a shovel talk, you can stand down.”
“Did I do good?” Tony mumbled under his breath once he could see and hear Steve again. Steve smiled in surprise  - how he was still awake enough to speak after all he’d been through was a mystery. Clearly, the answer to his question was so important to Tony that he needed to hear it before allowing himself to rest.
,” Steve jolted in bed and his back arched with one sudden, firm flick of Tony’s wrist over the tip of his cock.
“Not an option, Rogers,” Tony said with more bravado than he felt. “No man is too rich to escape justice.”
“Nothing’s going on, you said it yourself: it’s the diet,” Tony insisted, but Steve only shook his head.
“If you do, watch out for the alcohol,” Bruce tacked on to Thor’s suggestion. “Academics are rampant alcoholics, and they kinda set the mood at conferences.”
“Please, please, could you give me one more chance to show you how much you mean to me?” Steve said then, lowering his voice in deference.
“The final prize is a box of Australia’s own double-coated Tim Tams!” Georgie promised with a big smile, then with a mischievous glint in her eye, she shrugged and said, “or, whatever sweets we can scrounge out of Karl’s lunch box.”
What Thoreau did in Walden Tony would do in his own home, and he had no intention of getting up until Steve came home.
Dusk was fading into night when Steve pulled up to the old barn. Had they been in Manhattan, it would have been too early for any deserving bar crowd, but in this part of the world, the designated parking area was already so full that there was barely room to turn the truck around.
Steve rolled his eyes and replaced the lid. He got to the door just in time to see Tony with his fist raised to knock, wearing boxers and a t-shirt.
“You didn’t hear his accent, Steve, god, his accent,” Tony moaned under his breath, sounding drunk on his pleasure. “Imagine someone’s put your head down and fucks your ear with a condom made of velvet and silk… and he was so, fucking,
Tony watched his flustered man scurry away with a proud smile. Distracted to the point of incoherence wasn’t quite what Tony had expected when Sarah let it slip that Steve’s first crush was Disney’s Aladdin, but he would take it.
Steve understood Bucky’s concern—really, he did. He personally thanked his security detail for their unwavering professionalism through the scare. He felt so bad about the whole mess that he resisted Tony’s whispered invitations to stress-test the backseat of the vintage Rolls he’d hired for a summit in London, or sharing his jet for their joint presentation in Sydney.
Rhodey’s words caught in Steve’s mind like a flare, and he immediately looked up at Tony. Tony looked paler, and he wasn’t meeting anyone’s gaze: he stared down at the bar top with unseeing eyes, clearly off in his own thoughts.
“He’s back on Sunday,” Tony told him, deliberately ignoring the first question. “How about you? Miss your empty flat? Does it miss you, too?”
The skeptical Lieutenant frowned at Tony’s reported solution. “Captain America is fairytale hokum told to fearful children and wayward adolescents.”
“Maybe I wanted someone to get into my pants, did you think of that?” Steve countered, though he posed the question more out of curiosity than anger. “I’m tired and sore and in pain, maybe an hour with someone in my pants would, uh, cheer me up. Did you think of that, genius?”
Steve set his jaw, and quietly counted backwards from thirty before he started shouting at his date.
“Stephanie is cursed herself,” Natasha whispered, fighting to speak without letting her teeth chattering from the cold. “You—you cannot break a curse if you are cursed.”
There was a knock at the door as Jane announced herself. “Lieutenant Tony Stark, Lieutenant Bruce Banner informed me of what vexes you. May I be of assistance?”
“Alright, then if that’s good for now… the lab isn’t safe until morning if you want help studying. Educate me in the potential power of cocks, Steven.”
Howard snickered behind his morning paper. Maria clearly had no compunction about laughing in her son’s face. “Oh, my sweet child. You still believe that old wives tale?”
“Visual? Sex isn’t visual,” Steve answered on impulse. “That’s porn—pornography. I don’t, that’s not my thing, Tony, I, sex is about a growing closer and learning about each other, building a physical connection—”
With a smug grin and an unfriendly salute, Hammer led his team to an unoccupied conference room. They shut the door behind them to cut off any interference from the police officers and set up their war room.
“But without this man’s sperm the child in question wouldn’t exist,” Brock replied, doubling down on his earlier argument. “Why should his contribution be less important than Swinney’s?”
I can now happily (uh) say that, if enough people like it, there is definitely further to go with this one. After all, Steve's only just gotten Tony registered as his, and his new toys haven't arrived. Just saying.
It was a small, intimate space, but that meant they didn’t have booths or corners to hide in. Instead, the hostess hid them in plain sight in the corner seat at the window where Tony could sit with his back to the wall and remain unseen by pedestrians and other patrons entering the restaurant.
“This is Natasha Romanov, another associate with the firm,” Hawley said in introduction. “Top three in her class and former editor of Harvard Law Review. You’ve probably seen her lurking around campus doing my research. She will be taking the lead on this case.”
It wasn’t long before Stephanie was brought before Chief Talia. She explained again how her curse would be lifted when a Chief of her kin was honor-bound to her, and how, once the curse was lifted, she would be able to bear a child for the Chief. A daughter. She explained that in return for helping her find a Chief to wed, Stephanie had promised to have Clint’s curse lifted, and grant both men protection.
Tony gave him an odd look, but whatever he was thinking, he kept to himself. Steve watched him go, and it wasn’t until Tony was out of sight that Steve’s smile dropped from his face and panic took over.
“Thank you, Flora,” he said sincerely. “Let me talk to Mr. Rogers, and we’ll see if it’s possible, alright?”
The man slipped into the cab with him just as the elevator doors were closing. All too casually, he placed himself between Steve and the control panel to prevent Steve from pushing the
So when by chance their helicopters intercepted a small aircraft traveling to Machtberg at high speed, they took notice. After a failed attempt to make contact with the private passenger jet, the helicopters turned formation and opened fire. The jet was still too far to fall in the line of fire, but the hostile reception was enough for the plane to change its course and avoid Machtberg altogether.
Steve ducked his head before anyone could see his smile falter; before the guy could congratulate himself for getting under Steve’s skin. He only needed a second to regroup and remind himself this was his first day at law school, and nobody was going to ruin that for him.
“That’s part of the problem, I might have lost it,” Steve admitted sheepishly. “Just got back from a business trip and a few things are missing.”
“Ta mee breearrey shen,” replied Torin, swearing to honor Brigid’s chief priest as was asked of him. With his promise, the Mayor offered his hand to Ean. “Irree.”
Steve’s hands closed like two vices around Tony’s ass and spread him apart until it nearly stung. Bared, exposed, and trembling with excitement, Tony could only cry out as Steve licked and sucked on his furrowed hole until Tony could feel the excess drool and saliva trickling down his crack.
“You’re not the boss of me,” Tony groused, but he eyed that water bottle, because if he thought about anything besides the fact that Steve hadn’t mentioned him, or asked about him, or even called him, he’d probably realize he was kind of thirsty.
“Okay, but then why is there American soil in a random square?” Steve wondered, “or is ...I mean, I thought I knew US history, but I don’t remember a battle of Trafalgar between America and England.”
Mirroring Tony’s behavior, Steve found himself sitting up and growing more alert. The night was still too dark for him to be able to see much farther than the car’s headlights, but as Tony slowed in preparation to park, he thought he could make out the general outline of a solid structure in front of them. But if this was the house, there was no sign of life: no lights were on, and beyond the sound of the wind and wilderness around them, Steve could hear nothing to suggest a family was awake, waiting for their child and his partner to come home.
“I am not as generous as you, my love,” Tony hedged before daring to accept Steve’s suggestion. “Would you forgive me if I won?”
Steve pressed away from the wall and turned Tony so he faced the free-standing bookshelf. It brought them a few feet closer to the main aisle of the balcony, just enough that Tony could even peek over the railing if he made an effort. Steve guided Tony into a wider stance as he jerked Tony’s jeans down past his ass, leaving his cheeks fully out on display. Tony gripped onto the metal ledge of the bookshelf he was facing, and desperately tried to remember that he couldn’t lean against it, that he’d somehow have to push back to meet Steve’s thrusts if he didn’t want to topple the shelves and announce their presence with a terrible scene. But Steve pulled him back by his hips until Tony balanced on the balls of his feet, his ass turned up for Steve.
“I hope Vargas gets a shot in before Bond kills him,” Tony grumbled with feeling. Not that anyone believed it; all Q-branch analysts remembered their first dance with an operative they’d like to smack around, and for many of them, that dance had been with Bond himself.
“Thank you for joining me,” Steve replied in a whisper, turning to better face Tony so that they nearly stood nose to nose when Tony relaxed down on his feet again. “Would you like a ride home?”
Tony glanced from Bruce to Fury, and when neither of them seemed willing to answer the Captain’s question, Tony tried. “We are what is left of the New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey after the earthquake of 2021.”
“BAD DOG!” he shouted, sprinting after her without any hope of catching her. “MARPLE! Marple! Get back here!”
“But then, people started coming up to me,” Steve continued, his expression warming as a smile curled his lips. “People who didn’t even know what team I played for; they probably hadn’t seen a game in their life, honestly. A woman told me her gay grandson had cried when I got transferred to LA. Then all he wanted for Christmas that year was my jersey. I lost count of how many people I met in the first week alone who wanted to talk to me and thank me, Tony, people of all ages. And people kept showing up, to every open training, to every game.”
Steve chuckled at Tony’s momentary pang of parental embarrassment and absolutely took advantage of it by cuddling him for comfort.
“Well, alright, sure, but there’s nothing I can do about that right now,” Tony eventually said, then urged Steve on to the nearest chaise lounger. Distantly, Steve heard the a door open and close, and the voices of two chuckling men filtered from the way they came. The dogs whined quietly around them before three of them trotted back towards the front door, compelled to go greet their master.
“I have to get someone on this right away. Stay here,” Steve said by way of excusing himself. He shouldn’t leave Tony alone in a room full of evidence, and he shouldn’t let this one potential lead go to his head so quickly, but protocol did not feel half as important as rallying some junior detectives to start a preliminary look into Antonovich.
Tony leaned up on an elbow, and with a gentle touch, stroked Steve’s stubbly jaw while he spoke. “You know,” he whispered, still panting softly as he caught his breath. “Between you and me, I wasn’t sure you’d still… you know. Want me like you did before. I don’t really look the same.”
“I’m going to stretch you open on my cock, sweetheart,” Steve promised him with a deep, predatory growl in his voice. “I’m going to finger you wet and fill you with my cock, hold you down and split you open against this couch until you sob and beg and streak this couch with your come.”
Of the three machines Steve had acquired for him, Tony’s favorite was the one that took him from behind. Sometimes, when he was left there too long, his knees ached even with the padding, but it was the only machine that had a second attachment with a suction cup to milk his cock while he was being fucked. Practically speaking, he was relieved that his ejaculate finally counted toward filling his quota of canisters, but in practice, it was all about that silky, slippery tight sleeve milking his cock for hours to distract him while his ass was continuously fucked open on fresh canisters.
Unlike Fran the little Pomeranian, this time the assistant carried a squirming, long-limbed boxer puppy with a square nose and big, curious eyes. Tony stood up in his excitement to take the dog from her, but once he sat down, Steve shuffled closer so they could both marvel at the excitable balls of energy they never expected to play with today.
“Don’t be so dramatic,” Maria said with a roll of her eyes, and she turned to walk back out to the sitting room where they’d been preparing to have the ceremony. “I got him hanging up the flowers, come see him yourself when you’re dressed!”
In the far corner, to Brock’s right, Phil looked red around the ears. Steve couldn’t tell if he was embarrassed, irritated, angry, or sunburned, but he didn’t look that happy.
“Rhodes, you disobeyed a direct order from your king. I should not have to repeat my husband’s command,” Steve said in tight-lipped anger. “In seven hours, he and I will retire and I need the Iron Legion to be well rested.”
With his arms casually crossed in front of him, Brock watched as another car pulled up and two more cops stepped out with two more batons.
“The window, it’s open,” Steve whispered, and after a few moments, Tony’s eyes focused enough to see Steve running his hands along the window frame looking for something.
“You might want to take that up with her,” Maria said, then smoothly changed the subject. “Remember when Hansen said she was a graduate student at MIT?”
Steve didn’t notice Fury marching into the office with Natasha at his side, filling Pierce’s office with his lieutenants and Scraps. He was too busy trying to keep Tony's attention and offer him comfort while furtively searching for the bullet wound that continued to stain his hands and clothes red with Tony’s blood.
With a wretched sob, Tony suddenly stretched out flat on the mattress, breathless, irritated, and unsatisfied. “Please, my love,” he pleaded. “The world has had you long enough. For me, Steve, please. Come home.”
Tony had changed since they’d arrived from the airport, and Steve couldn’t help but stare. After the mild fall in LA, Steve had enjoyed the endearing sight of Tony bundling up in multiple layers of thin sweaters and doubling up on scarves for the New York fall weather. But the Tony on the other side of his door didn’t look like the shivering little caterpillar in tortoiseshell glasses he had warmed to in Manhattan. He had blossomed into a handsome, devilish rogue in a black leather jacket, denim jacket, heather grey t-shirt, and dark blue jeans.
Tony grunted quietly as consciousness returned to him. Someone was shaking his shoulder. “Tony? Sweetheart, I’m back.”
“Once this is over, I will come for your life,” she whispered to him in a promise. Icy chills ran through Tony’s veins; it was the happiest he’d ever heard 006 sound. “Not you, you understand, but everything that gives your life meaning. Your family, your friends. Your lover will watch you burn.”
The rest of the day passed quickly and without added obstacles. As people noticed he wasn’t doing anything out of the ordinary, they started to lose interest in pointing and staring after him. By the time Steve and Maria finished their last class and grabbed dinner, they only had the six o’clock meeting with Hawley left for the night. Maria offered to skip her bi-monthly Feminists Against Capitalism meet-up to keep him company, but since it had all quieted down, Steve assured her that he’d be fine. He would just head over to Hawley’s offices early and get some reading done in a conference room before their meeting.
“Be silent, Steve Rogers,” Tony said under his breath while Bruce was not yet far enough away to be out of earshot. “The risk is too great, I will not allow it. I descend first.”
“Okay, so, I know it’s totally ominous and obnoxiously cliche, but: we need to talk,” he said up front. “You should sit down.”
“Then prepare to learn a whole new level of second-hand embarrassment,” Steve warned him with a fond smile, brushing Tony’s happy tears away with a gentle touch. “I called Peggy—”
Carol looked from Tony to Rhodey and back again. “He’s making a good case,” she told Rhodey quietly. “Steve’s never left the country, and he loves all of those things.”
“Pardon me?” Steve said, gently touching the man’s shoulder for his attention. The man jumped in his surprise and spun around to see what Steve wanted.
“We’ll go easy on you instead, how about that?” Karl offered, and luckily Steve was too distracted with his armful of tiny and enormous puppies—one of which took up loads of space and wanted to hide under his armpit, and the other who was fearless and dedicated to climbing him like the man mountain he was.
“But, he’s not normal,” Tony insisted. “He—he can talk about art and history and science, but he can’t talk about his family for ten seconds?”
” he grunted under his breath, staring up into Steve’s eyes. He knew those eyes, and all at once it occurred to him that it didn’t matter any more if it was a man or a Woman in his arms; whoever this was, Tony would not be letting go if it killed him. “Stephanie?”
Steve could have teased Tony for hours just to watch him. The lean, cording muscles of Tony’s neck and shoulders, his spit-slick lips bitten red with the effort not to make any demands on Steve, the sweat already gleaming over his flawless tan skin—spellbound, Steve drank in the sight of him gulping down air only to choke into silence when Steve pushed into him with two thick fingers. The strong muscle of Tony’s rim pulsed against Steve’s fingers, and as Steve thrust his fingers into him to the last knuckle, he saw Tony’s jaw go slack and his eyes roll back in pleasure.
They traveled together by night and slept by day as they had agreed. Tony and Stephanie walked on foot, while Clint trailed behind them with all of their supplies over his back. In the final hours before dawn, Stephanie would blow into a whistle for her dragon. Neither Tony nor Clint could make out any sound from the whistle, but no matter how far they had traveled in the dark, the dragon would always find them, and she would always come to Stephanie. Every day, Stephanie slept under the protective wing of her dragon, while Tony and Clint curled up under a tree together to sleep nearby.
Steve tried smoothing his expression as he caught the water bottle, but by Bucky’s unimpressive glare he hadn’t managed to do so. He lifted the corners of his lip in a smirk and took a swig of his water. As he did so, his eyes caught onto the date on his watch.
Steve scanned the room, but couldn’t find Tony anywhere. “Does anyone have eyes on Tony,” he said walking toward the others.
Tony walked to Miles’ bedroom and turned on the light in there. He silently approached his bed and sat down at the edge of it. His hands slightly shook Miles’ sleeping body. He smiled fondly as Miles curled up closer to Snuggles and seemed to turn his face into the pillow to avoid the light in his room.
And something that far removed from dirt, would take an incredible time to get rid of blood stains. He still didn’t know why they had white towels in the tower with as much dirt and grime the Avengers seemed to rack up.
“Look there better not be another time,” Ryder stressed. “But if he does have an attack where I’m not available just talk to him and get him to listen to you going on about just small things. Adjective and noun is just one mindless conversation, but it’s simple enough that your brain is confused as to why this new information is being sorted in, so it takes the times to address this new onslaught of thoughts while storing away the thoughts that were brought to the forefront causing it anxiety,” Ryder explained.
“And then to that I would probably say something like you were the very first thing I was terrified in this brand new century. And that was because I found out to me you were love in its simplest forms and I hadn’t had that since Bucky and my ma.”
“You’d make a great father by the way. Miles really loves you and it’s really cool that you adopted him,” Steve admitted, bringing to mind Ryder’s previous words.
Tony simply hated that it took him being in this room and the fact that it was taking longer than expected. He forgot how well Ryder was at lying and manipulating a situation.
Ryder reached into his briefcase and pulled out a party invite. “I figured, since you all live together you wouldn’t need multiple invites. I will give you further details as the day approaches. If you have any more questions, just let me know.”
“Nope, you can’t make promises in my dreams,” Tony slurred, his voice tilted with a type of lightness that Natasha found haunting. “Promises are never kept so we don’t make them in my dreams. No promises, no promises.”
and had woken up in the middle of the second movie and decided he was going to bed. Clint was next saying he had to get up early to do a little more gift shopping. Natasha followed Clint jokingly saying she need her beauty rest.
Isa smiled softly at Steve, but with a certain harshness said, “You are a good man inside who wants the best for the little men. The Accords is exactly there to help the little man…so for the love of all why are you so hell bent on not signing?”
“Well then quiet down your whole lost puppy look,” Sharon offered. “Who would have thought that Captain America would have a crush on Tony? Man if I could go back in time and tell little Tony that would be amazing.”
Tony, however, was never one for silence. And there were things he wanted to get off of his chest, things that his therapist told him he should say aloud. Tony debated with himself and felt his heart pressing tightly against his chest.
Tony hoped that this was going to end the way he wanted it to. There was a reasonable sense of doubt that Ryder may just claim he is Isak. Then with the way Tony is leading him to believe that he truly misses him, then he may come to Tony one unsuspecting day and reveal himself.
“So I’ll repeat myself again. Don’t make me do it three times. Take off your shirt for us Tony,” Ryder leered eyes growing dark. “Stand up and take off your clothes.”
“Well,” Tony stuttered off. “Things are changed. I pardoned Bucky for goodness sake. Why would I put something in the Accords-?”
“Hey my dedication allowed me to win this game.” Tony bumped his shoulder into Steve. “And reveal my secrets? Never. Steve you’ll just have to find your own strategy.”
Eventually, the time came for the weekly movie night. Steve had insisted on bringing back movie night from before they all broke apart, so this was the first day they were having it again.
Steve came in two long strides and stepped between Tony and Ryder. Ryder laughed something deep and dark. He managed to clap his hands together in the cuffs.
And he kept talking, just pushing Steve closer to grabbing the nearest object and slicing his tongue on it so Ryder wouldn’t ever be able to speak again.
“Yes, I’m going to take care of you until you get better bambino. Then you can come back here and play with your friends.”
They all took the elevator up to the conference room where Fury was supposed to have been waiting for them. The ride was silent and tense with nerves. Once the elevator dinged, they all stepped out and quickly faltered with who was waiting in the conference room.
“Fishes,” Miles said back to him. “Lots of fishes there. Uncle Rhodey said the one swimming too fast was like you.”
Steve laughed unamused. “I thought that I could stand up for everyone and show compassion. I didn’t show compassion for you Tony. I just…I was tired of knowing that people’s pain was because of me…and maybe that is also why I was against the Accords. I knew I would see people’s pain in relation to my actions, but I know it isn’t fair for me to brush that aside.”
“Yes, he actually has quite the eye for architecture. I believe if he weren’t so occupied with mischief, he would probably be quite the household name in the world of architects.”
“So anytime he’s able to get some rest even if for a little bit, I’d like for it to be uninterrupted. Ryder can call him later.”
“No one touched me,” Tony whispered to himself, his hands still not wanting to check and see if Cali was telling him the truth. He didn’t feel any particular pain…but he also couldn’t really feel his body right now.
In between Steve’s sobs, he kept uttering how he was going to kill him and that grew to Bucky’s discomfort. Realizing that Bucky had tensed up, Steve pulled away and looked at Bucky.
“Yeah, it is. I just want my family back. I’m sure you understand,” Clint said motioning toward Bucky, who had remained silent during their whole conversation.
“Now just why on earth would I tell you that?” Miriam laughed. “I don’t see you offering me anything in exchange.’
“I do know,” Sam said, startling Bucky who hadn’t known Sam had re-entered with a bag of crushed ice.
Steve hated how he just swept over Steve and didn’t seem to mind. Steve had never met someone so unbothered by anything. Steve had never once been in the presence of someone like him, a true psychopathic person.
Ryder’s eyes briefly scanned over where Bucky’s hand had been resting on Tony’s upper calf. Bucky discreetly placed his hand back in his lap, hoping to himself that Ryder wouldn’t get upset. He had only been living here barely for a day. He didn’t want the Tony’s boyfriend to get upset at him even if Tony had seemed to be genuinely welcoming.
“Please don’t,” Tony winced just imagining the time Mama Rhodes visited him junior year after Rhodey snitched on him for not having left his room in a month.
“I would be happy, if I was a hundred percent certain it was Ryder’s body that died. And even if he had truly died in that car crash I must be honest, I’m a little disappointed I wasn’t the one that put an end to him.”
Tony felt tears spring into his eyes and an abundance of joy fill his heart. At the back of his mind there was a fleeting thought of Ryder, but the joy pushed it aside. A sob broke through his chest and he hunched over himself. Karen quickly went to him and gave him a hug.
“I don’t have time to be fucking angry. I don’t have time. Because every time and then Rogers will see me as some unforgiving asshole. I mean how can the Merchant of Death not forgive someone who was fucking brainwashed, huh? How can the Merchant of Death be holier than thou?”
“Because I’m…you know why Pepper. He’s all American goodness and sweet apple pie and I’m Tony stark,” Tony mumbled against Rhodey’s chest. “I’ve lived my whole life knowing that I would never be good enough for someone like him. I wasn’t good enough for you.”
were just gone,” Tony rasped. “But hey you didn’t mean to. My bad I should have thought about that small little fact.”
“It’s a long story,” Phil murmured tiredly. He looked at all of the Avengers and motioned for them to sit down. “Perhaps I’ll tell you later, when things have cooled down. But please take a seat.”
“Has anyone said anything in the group yet?” Steve asked as they made their way back to the Tower, where hopefully Pepper and Rhodey were still keeping Tony out of.
“Please don’t push me away. I don’t think I’d know what to do if you did,” Steve whispered, leaning down to press a kiss against the crown of Tony’s forehead.
“You know if you had as much passion for fighting me right now as you did for loving Tony then maybe you’d be with him,” Bucky drawled, while kicking at Steve’s side.
“Let me know if it ever gets too much and I’ll take a look at it and make adjustments,” Tony told him.
“Merchant,” Tony finished, knowing the word that he had given Steve as a sign of showing he was getting uncomfortable in the interrogation room.
“But a young Tony didn’t know that. Our Tony didn’t know that until nearly over a year ago. He’s had that added guilt on his mind for years. How long did you know?”
Those Ryders existed in two different spaces in Tony’s lifetime, but they were still the same person. And it wasn’t easy to deal with that. In fact, it wasn’t something that he thought he had to deal with until his therapy sessions with Dr. Sana.
Tony looked at Peter for a few seconds. Peter held the phone between them and let the ringing feel the silence in the room. Groaning Tony reached for the phone and answered it.
By then Miles had woke up, due to the noise coming from the video. He blinked open his eyes and few time and looked around. His gaze settled on everyone around him, before he saw Peter. Immediately his face brightened and he bounced excitedly in his seat.
“Do you know anything about the CMPNY?” she said licking her lips. At Natasha’s and Steve’s blank expressions, she continued. “It was a group built in opposition to Hydra. CMPNY was founded by Howard Stark and Evon Clerak. Later Howard Stark was the main operator of the group. CMPNY existed mainly to study the restructuring of epigenetics in accordance to the serum. Howard wanted to see if there was a chance that people with the serum could have heritable changes in gene function without it changing their genetic code. So then you wouldn’t have to have people getting the serum, you would just have them passing down this trait.”
Ryder’s chest heaved up and down and he pushed Tony away from himself, though not in a way that brought attention to himself. His body practically vibrated with fury and he felt the need to physically express his anger. A body came barreling into his. Before he could even remember that he was in the presence of others, his hand swung downward at the body.
“Trust me I know,” Sharon said solemnly. “One time Tony came to visit me, while I was training to become a SHIELD agent. I remember he came unannounced one day because he had been inspired by something. I had my whole freaking assignment laid out on the floor and he didn’t even notice because he was so focused on explaining whatever schematics he had worked on. I had never been so nervous in my life, because of course at that time I didn’t want him to be involved.”
“I am not your caretaker. You can go out and get plums yourself. I have told you this many times. You can’t keep giving me a list of things to get at the store,” Sam growled lowly.
Steve’s grin grew hungry as he flipped Tony’s body upward, so that now Tony’s thighs were straddling either side of Steve’s hips. Tony hissed then settled as he did a slow roll on Steve’s hips. Steve ran his hands invitingly up and down Tony’s thighs.
Tony shook his head, bringing his knees even closer to his chest. Steve looked around and saw the fallen blanket on the floor, right next to a puddle of vomit. He immediately took it in his hands and placed it over Tony’s shaking body. The shaking continued, but the chattering of his teeth remained constant.
“Your baba cannot function without coffee. It gives him his super powers,” Natasha teased watching as Tony began to literally inhale his coffee.
Tony looked back into the eyes, which he found comfort in and one who’s in the past looked on with weariness. Tony wondered whether Steve sometimes compared the look of distrust that Tony once held in his eyes with the way Tony felt he was looking at him now.
“Natasha! Could you have like given us a warning,” Tony shouted pressing his hand, that wasn’t occupied with holding Steve’s, to his chest. “Like you know my heart condition isn’t that great.”
Pepper then came into the room with her phone clutched in her hand. “The hotel staff wasn’t employed tonight. Ryder told them he had his own employees that would be able to handle the event. I asked if I could get the information for these employees and they said that they hadn’t received any information. Everything was done through Ryder.”
“Oh, no that is not what I came here for. I just…I am you could say an old friend of your husband’s. I was recently in town for a business trip and decided to come visit him,” he explained, dismissing her concern.
Steve shrugged his shoulders and admitted, “I know…I know I’m still just trying to view therapy not as a form of weakness or punishment.”
Tony woke up with a start, his breathing harsh and ragged. Dots swam in his vision. He blinked once, twice…before everything started to clear up. He couldn’t stop the chattering of his teeth or the shaking off his fingers. He looked around at the walls and then to the closed door. His breath picked up.
Tony felt his chest tighten and his breath escape from him completely. He was enraptured with everything that she was saying and felt that any movement, any speech from Tony could disrupt things.
“Bye Agent Eva! Bye Mr. Eric!” Miles said waving to the two leaving guards, who had turned back and offered Miles a wave and a smile of their own.
But those bruises marred all over his body and the slight burning in his throat all pointed toward otherwise. He blinked his eyes open trying to clear away the wetness that was starting to form. He shouldn’t be crying. After all was said and done, Ryder had apologized and offered that he would try for him to accept Miles.
Tony exited the car and left the safety it offered. Tony pushed open the gates and went inside the cemetery. The grass beneath his feet crinkled at each step from leaves from fallen trees that had not been raked yet.
When they entered Miles’ room, Tony first went to change Miles into his pajamas, which Miles easily allowed. However, when Tony tried separating himself from Miles’ hold, he found he couldn’t. The small child had wrapped himself completely around his father unwilling to go.
All three boys voiced their disagreement over this arrangement, but was promptly silence by Principal Davis clearing his throat.
“Natasha can you do me a huge favor and watch Miles for a few days. I know you have to get ready for your mission coming up soon and if you have to leave early or aren’t available I can get in touch with May. But Ryder is right I did promise him and I hate to leave a bad impression on Ryder’s parents,” Tony rambled. “It just slipped my mind.”
Steve frowned and reached out to Tony’s hand that was playing mindlessly with his napkin. His fingers slowly interlaced with Tony’s and Tony brought his attention back to Steve.
Tony grew lightheaded from where this conversation was going. He knew that kids picked up on things, but had he really been letting his son see what was happening to him. He didn’t want those problems to be public for Miles.
He knew what he wanted, but he couldn’t dare say it aloud. If he said it aloud, that would change things. He needed to remain steadfast in his decision even if it caused him physical and emotional pain. Tony deserved this much. He didn’t deserve Steve becoming some…homewrecker. Steve had suffered many blights to his image as of late, but he would not become a homewrecker.
Thanks again to everyone who commented, gave a kudo, and left a bookmark. You all continue to make my day :)
Steve laughed as Tony took a sip of his coffee. Miles settled into his seat picking food off of anyone’s plate that was near him.
“Well, it seems as though my boyfriend can answer his phone,” Ryder snidely answered back. “You’ve been ignoring my phone calls. Look I know you have every right to not talk to me for like a day, but two days? Come on Tony act your age. And that whole you’re sick bull shit was cute. Tell Peter I’ll be looking for his Golden Globe nomination.”
Tony's talk will happen in 3 parts. This is "The Talk" Pt. 1. I would like to say it won't be as heart-wrenching as the "I apologize in advance for any tears shed" series, but ummm...
Steve, himself, had no doubts that Isak was not who he claimed to be. He had all been so ready to tell Isak he knew that he had planned all of this, it was all to convenient. Also he had some prisoners changed informants of the CMPNY that told him the CMPNY was still receiving instructions. That could only happen if someone in charge was still telling them what to do.
“Really? Pretty sure I am already ruining the kid,” Tony teased, though it lacked any humor. His eyes dimmed slightly. “I mean I pretty much am my father’s son. Even you said so.”
“Oh, that was just Ryder saying that he had been called in for an emergency surgery and won’t be back until early morning.”
“Tony do not put words into my mouth. You know that your time at this orphanage has proven that you can take care of twenty children at a time. I am just worried you may not have the time. The pneumonia Miles has right now isn’t contagious so you’re fine in that aspect. It’s just I heard the Avengers were coming back pretty soon and I know you’ll be dealing with them.”
“Yes, you, sir, and Director Fury are still the only ones have full authorized access to the switch. Would you like for it to be activated, Captain?”
He didn’t need to. Steve would have accepted the handhold no explanation needed. Steve squeezed the fingers once more. He allowed himself a few seconds to stare at Tony’s face, before the day’s events caught up to him and he realized that he had become just as tired as Tony looked.
Tony grinned and held onto Steve’s waist. He tugged his pants down and Steve gave a breath of relief. His own hands reached out to run over Tony’s neck, settling on the pulse point there. Tony’s breath quickened, fingers tightening on Steve.
Before Tony knew it, his body was lifted and turned to the edge of the bathtub. His arms were held tightly behind his back by Eva. Luka grabbed a towel and placed it under Tony’s knees then placed a hand on Tony’s back.
But if Tony indeed wanted to change rooms, Steve would gladly pack everything onto his back and do it for him. Steve was just about to grab Tony’s desk chair and pull it by Tony, when a knock came at the door. Steve’s shoulders went tight as he turned sharply to the source of the sound, breathing out with relief when he only saw it was Bucky holding a bowl of soup.
His eyes focused lazily on the ceiling above him. He had grown to find interest in the most minimalistic things within these four walls that housed him for however long he was under Ryder’s care…control. He would try counting every now and then, going through different schematics and even refreshed his mind on his senior dissertation he did at MIT just so his mental space wouldn’t be blocked by those four fucking walls.
The acid burned in his throat. Tony looked at him worryingly and then his eyes widened. Steve forced himself to close off his expression, so as Tony wouldn’t feel the need to comfort him. He didn’t want Tony to know how much he desired to know everything, but also feared knowing what happened under this tower and all the other places the two had ever been alone.
“Look, I know we have a lot to talk about. And I am honestly so sorry that I haven’t been answering your calls. But I’m at the carnival right now. So I’ll have to call you back. I’ll make it up to you I promise,” Tony answered hoping that Ryder would accept his apology.
“No, no,” Tony quickly stuttered out. “Ummm, here. Just be careful. And if he starts coughing too much take him to the trash can. He probably just needs to get some mucus out.”
Steve immediately stopped what he was doing and Bucky slowly turned around. “You’ve got to be kidding, right? It’s almost time. Tony should be coming here soon,” Steve muttered.
“It is such a mighty and wonderfully appealing morning dessert,” Thor proclaimed. “Aye Bruce! Is not the pop tart an amazingly crafted breakfast meal?”
Peter let out a breath of air shakily. “I don’t want what I’m saying to make you feel bad. That’s not my intention. I’m just angry and not at you.”
She broke off and sighed trying to gather the strength to continue. “It was three years into their relationship, when I first saw the hand shaped bruise on his neck. I didn’t ask. I figured they were up to some kinky shit. Then the bruises increased. I asked him and he said he was fine. He said I had nothing to worry about. I asked him again a year later, when he was in the hospital for a broken collarbone,” she trailed off.
Steve turned watery eyes. “From the fact that Bucky killed his parents. And Natasha I wanted to tell him, but I figured it wouldn’t help. His parents were dead nothing would have changed that. I didn’t know he…I didn’t know he would have felt so strongly about it. I thought eventually once everything was cleared and Bucky had gained some semblance of normality then I could explain everything. But I didn’t get a chance to because Zemo showed a tape.”
“At that moment I knew. I had the validation of Captain America on my side to make any and all things I had justifiable. Besides Howard had already planted that little seedling of doubt…”
“Clint you so whined. He whined for three hours, saying, Oh Nat I’m so bored. Oh, just save me from this boring dungeon. It was amusing for the first 30 seconds, but then he continued. So I figured like a child he would appreciate going to some amusement park or something.”
When they finally sound the location, they hadn’t wasted anytime in going. The Avengers and SHIELD agents were there. They had entered the building, an underground space in the heart of a woody area some thousands of miles from the tower.
“But that’s okay. I love you and that’s enough for you. Well I am off. I’ll be back before you know it,” he leaned down and pressed a kiss against Tony’s cold back.
Steve rubbed his forehead. “It’s just easier for me to write things. I can just place all of my feelings on there.”
Tony arrived at the table and sat beside Ryder who had brought another seat to the table. Ryder had been talking to Pepper and Rhodey. He appeared slightly uncomfortable as Rhodey talked to him, until Rhodey broke out into a smile and patted Ryder’s shoulder. Pepper rolled her eyes toward Rhodey and said something else to Ryder, then turned back to talk to Sharon.
“Oh, that sounds fun. How was the school program?” Steve asked resting his back against the couch Bucky was sat on.
Steve turned to him and immediately knew what it was, heart thrumming inside of him with a mixture of excitement and unbridled nervousness as a constant reminder of what he was planning tonight.
“But do you think it’s acceptable to try and break up Ryder and Tony?” Steve whispered not sure if he wanted to hear the answer. He wanted to fight for Tony and had a renewed strength running through his body. He realized that his time wallowing could’ve been spent getting closer to Tony. He was never one to run away from a fight. He shouldn’t have let this been the time he lowered his defense and walked away.
“Just stay. Can you just stay for a moment,” Tony whispered as though ashamed he was asking this of Steve.
“Good,” Karen said. “Now will you be staying to help us taken down our thanksgiving decoration and put up our Christmas decorations?”
Tony’s eyes widened before he quickly schooled his expression. “Yeah, but I decided I’m not the type to just lounge around and do nothing. So it was either my lab or this meeting and since I’ve been putting this off forever, I can’t neglect it anymore. But I’ll be back soon. Just give me three hours then we can do all the relaxing we want.”
Harley crossed his arms and pouted, slumping back in his seat. “Not funny guys. This is a serious dilemma I am now having to think about.”
Ryder looked at him expectantly, head cocked to the side as if in amusement. Steve internally scoffed over how there was no inch of remorse on Ryder’s face.
Exhaling slowly, he didn’t outwardly express his gratitude for the strength Bucky and Clint were grounding him in. However, his smile which had the tense lines removed away from it was enough sign of gratitude for the both of them.
Cali’s breath caught in her throat. She had asked Ryder why Miriam hadn’t showed back here after her shift, but Ryder had waved her concerns off saying she probably took on another shift.
“Your brother,” he repeated again, “Was in a relationship with Tony Stark, yes. It was not a healthy relationship.”
“Yeah, clearly someone who plans on putting pasta in a dry pan knows how to cook. You do know you need to add water, right?” Bucky muttered taking the pan and adding water to it. “Then you have to let it boil. And I remember you burning the broth, when we were kids. It was broth Steve.”
“I’m actually surprised I have some concealer left, seeing as though a certain someone has been stealing mine,” Natasha said raising an eyebrow. “If you wanted to play in my make-up you could have just asked.”
“Like I was saying,” he continued as though Steve wasn’t mere seconds away from chocking him to lifelessness. “You’ve probably read up on Tony and noticed he was kind of troubled as a kid getting up to all types of nonsense.”
“I know for a fact Clint probably told you to say that, didn’t he?” Tony asked.  “I like to say that the other team should be disqualified, since they were bribed.”
Steve rested a hand on Tony’s back and rubbed smooth circles. Tony’s knuckles whitened as his grip on the counter tightened. Steve continued rubbing his back and then slowly with his other hand removed Tony’s hands from the kitchen counter.
The two found themselves passing Miles’ group. Peter, Michelle, and Ned were filtered in between the kids. Peter being in the back turned toward Tony who had just walked toward them.
“You’re shaking,” Steve whispered as if afraid he was breaking the silence that he and Tony had created for themselves.
Tony’s breaths puffed out and filled the silence of the room. Steve hummed in the back of his throat as he continued the repetitive motion of running his fingers through Tony’s hair. A few more minutes passed with Tony completely still.
Thanks again to everyone who commented, gave a kudo, and left a bookmark. You all continue to make my day :)
“Welcome to hell,” Ryder repeated Steve’s worked back to him, a lisp forming from the broken tooth that was now also cutting into his lip. “Now, dear Captain I don’t suppose you would be the one greeting me to my descent. Though I must say it is a nice surprise.”
Looking at the time on his watch, Tony ran a hand over his face and sighed. It had been two weeks since the Accord talk with the Avengers had went down the drain and two weeks since he had taken Miles back to Karen’s. A sharp pain entered Tony’s chest as he remembered Miles’ face as he handed him off to Karen. Miles had been healthy, probably healthier than he had ever been before. So it was time he went back. He had done what he said he would do.
Tony wasn’t sure what to expect, after Ryder told him he had made some dinner reservations on Saturday. He had told him he was merely making up for the interruption of Tony having to leave their date early. At first Tony had wanted to decline the offer in means of separating from Ryder. He had intended on breaking up with him, but it seemed every single time Tony started with, “We need to…” Ryder interrupted saying he needed to go into a shift or some emergency surgery.
Feel free to comment, even if you just want to write "why." So I am going to go into a nice little cave and hide only popping out to read and reply to comments and update the next chapter because well...
“I would hope that he’d trust us enough to come to us…that’d he know we love him and would do anything to take care of him. I mean we’re family. So I’d like to think he would,” Rhodey said as a frown made its way to his face. “I don’t think I could handle the idea of Tony keeping something bottled in.”
“This is something that your heart truly desires,” Steve inquired. “Something that without it you would feel lost?”
Tony chewed at the insides of his cheek and looked at the papers scattered across his desk. “They came back.”
“Let’s stick with the two months thing, yeah? By then Pep and I can help you plan everything the way you want. Goodness knows we’ve spent the last few months doing the same…ouch! What the hell Pep!” Rhodey shouted as Pepper’s top of her heel connected with his shin.
“Look I’m fine. I’m just at the park with Miles and Peter. I’ll probably be back in another hour or so.”
That stupid fucking proclamation. Ryder made sure to tell it to him almost daily as though repeating it enough might make Tony believe it. Tony almost had. He remembered a few days ago…or was it yesterday?
Tony’s eyes widened and his mouth grew dry. Steve can’t love him. That’s…that’s a huge problem. Is this a joke?
Clint had raised an eyebrow in amusement and spoke around an apple saying, “Always knew he wanted to draw you like one of his French girls.”
“Because I can’t seem to let myself let him go entirely. I keep holding onto this childlike fantasy that I could save him. I don’t know something like the prodigal son, returning home and all that yeah. So when he showed up in what seemed like forever, I thought maybe it had all changed. I thought…I thought he was on his road to redemption and the first stop was me,” he exclaimed.
“But then Cali called me, saying that you all had come to save you and that I should leave. So I hightailed it out of there. I didn’t too much mind being on the end of a witch hunt. I knew you weren’t the one who was trying to leave. They just took you.”
Tony was looking tentatively past all of them to see if she had arrived. He had made sure she knew when to arrive, but maybe he got the times or dates wrong. Tony only prayed he didn’t. He didn’t really want to have to discuss the Accords by himself.
Well, today Tony didn’t feel like being a proper adult. Sam must have seen the slow acceptance in Tony’s eyes because he rocked his foot back and then tipped it on Thor’s Lego building making one side of his wall collapse.
Bucky came into the gym, watching as Steve clumsily re-wrapped bloodied knuckles. He stood a safe distance as Steve stood back up and threw the rest of the medical wrap onto the floor. With his back turned, he hadn’t noticed the presence of Bucky in the gym. Bucky realized Steve must really be out of it for him not to take notice. For a few more minutes, Steve angrily punched at the bags growing more and more incensed. At one particular punch, the bag broke apart and crumbled to the floor.
“Michelle. Nice to meet you Mr. Stark. I would apologize for Peter’s rambling and lack of an appropriate grammatical sentence structure, but I assume you are used to that,” Michelle dryly said slightly amused by Peter’s flailing.
Ryder rubbed his bleeding wrists and stood up from his chair. He staggered a bit, but quickly found his balance and as soon as he did Steve landed a punch straight into his abdomen. The punch reverberated in the room and Steve was certain that he had broken at least two ribs.
When he had first come in today, he was disheartened that he wasn’t met with Miles throwing himself into Tony’s arms. He wondered if he had been adopted. He wanted to push down the happiness he felt, when he realized that he hadn’t been.
“And what of the Tony Stark? He just faded into the background with his new little boy toy Ryder Deaver?”
“Tones, you alright? What’s the letter say?” Rhodey inquired, reaching out to place a hand on Tony’s shoulder.
Clint had been happy to see her though, so there was that. Natasha narrowed her eyes at Wanda, searching for something. Then her expression smoothed out as she went back to talking to Steve.
“I only have my suspicions,” Clint admitted with a casual shrug of his shoulders. He brought the finished sausages and the warm buns to the table, then sat down to fix himself a hot dog with mustard and relish to continue his earlier train of thought.
Tony spun the laptop around to confirm what he remembered before answering. “It keeps a record of everyone with whom he still has a mutual connection, but I’ll dig and see if the company has a log of matches where either or both of them unmatched.”
“I swear,” Steve promised with no less devotion than on the day of their wedding. “For me it will only ever be you, mein Schafes.”
“A stallion in his prime, no less. And raring to go,” she added with a smirk, eyeing the noticeable bulge in his jeans. “Boy, you did good—”
Before Steve had a chance to insist that he didn’t need more pleasing or teasing, that he just needed four minutes to fuck Tony into spiraling ecstasy, Tony guided Steve’s long fingers to his tongue and into his mouth.
, and Steve balked so fast he nearly fell out of his seat. He scrambled to his feet in outrage, suddenly needing to put space between himself and
Steve had noticed the smallest signs of fatigue on Tony’s face, but somehow he’d forgotten to give himself a second look. Had he really become so pale?
Isa paused as if allowing Steve to speak, but Steve knew she did not desire for him to say anything at all.
Pleased with Tony’s suggestion, Peter nodded. Tony looked at the three of them, before heading down to his lab.
She was punished one time for leaving a scar coming from a broken bottle piece on Tony’s leg. Ryder had not been too happy about that. Ryder had put some aloe on it and kissed the healing scar, while banishing Miriam. Tony’s mouth opened to thank him, before it quickly closed. Miriam hadn’t been there since. Cali told him it was because she went to the hospital. And the way Tony was with time right now, she could have possibly only been gone a few days.
“It’s okay, go to sleep,” he whispered to Tony leaning down to press a kiss against his lips. “I’ll be here, when you wake.”
The memory coldly circulated in his mind as he tried paying attention to the news. He only managed to focus on it because they were mentioning the Avengers’ return to America.
Steve observed how the lines in his face slowly softened and the tension around his mouth eased up. Steve tried to ignore how watching this made the tension in his own shoulders relax.
Tony tried thinking how much of a risk it would be to run and realized with fear that it’d be too much of a risk. He had no methods of protection. He was bare and vulnerable and Ryder knew all of this.
Steve nodded as if seriously considering this. “Of course I’m on a time frame. How many do you think I can pull out of you tonight? Want to break a record and try five? I’m feeling extra generous and a little pent up, since we haven’t had a moment to ourselves in a bit.”
“Sir has been in here for little under an hour,” FRIDAY announced. “Would you like me to lower the volume, so you may approach?”
So Miles suddenly turning to Steve in hopes of getting the fruit snacks was not surprising. Tony shook his head at Miles.
Steve shook his head, still trying to understand what Bekah was saying. “Yes, I understand wanting to make a difference globally, but you can do that here close to your children.”
“Tony,” Natasha interrupted. “I would love to go to the orphanage with you and meet my little admirers, though I’m not certain there’s much to admire about me anymore.” She added the last bit to herself.
Tony had gotten used to rough sex. He had just thought Ryder liked it like that and Tony would eventually get used to it.
“Yeah, okay,” Tony said looking up at Steve, wanting to tell him he didn’t have to pretend like he needed him.
Bucky settled into his seat and closed his eyes. He figured Ryder just needed to be assured that Tony wasn’t trying anything with him. That was something Ryder certainly did not have to fear happening. But he understood that some partners just needed the reassurance.
Pepper left because he could never be enough…or perhaps he was always too much for her. He couldn’t blame her. They’re still great friends even though they don’t see each other to often. It’s fine.
“Hey…no why are you saying that as though…Tony what’s going on? I need you to tell me where you are. Tony.”
Tony still felt the phantom touch of Ryder’s hands on his reactor, then it shifted to being back in Afghanistan, then it transformed into Obie’s hands reaching for him, then it altered to someone who was unnamed reaching for the arc reactor with cold hands and stabbing the space below it, then it became Steve pressing the shield into his chest.
“Seriously, I mean it wouldn’t be the first time that you adopt a kid without me knowing,” Ryder growled. “I mean who knows what you might just do next!”
“Oh, we know. We are fully aware of your former battles with the bottle,” Miriam said opening the bottle up. “Which is why this is going to be so much fun. Now open up Mr. Stark,” she said pressing the bottle up against his lips.
Tony smiled warmly and patted Harley on the shoulder. “Of course Harley. Look I’m sorry I left unannounced. I should have set things up so you could still see your mom, while I was away.”
It looked like Bruce had made something quick for Tony and left what was remaining on the table. Thankfully, there was enough of it that it ceased the thrum of hunger resting in all of their stomachs.
Harley seemed to understand him. “Yeah, a lot of people seem to love doing that.” He looked at Steve once more. “You can really go take me to see my mom?”
“Hello? I’m here as well,” Sam said. “Steve I’d actually be helpful. Those two would more than likely suggest that your wedding colors are beige and silver.”
“Lab incident. Get used to seeing my face like this, though I assure you I’ve been told the marks add to my ruggedly handsome good looks,” Tony said.
“And whose fault is that, might I ask? I know you have the answer,” Isak explained crossing his arms over his chest. “Eva you will not have to prepare an additional plate for our guest. He is leaving.”
The two of them laughed, linking arms together before exiting the restaurant. Pepper pinched the bridge of her noise, as she whispered to herself, “And they think Rhodey is the good influence. Fools, I say. Fools.”
Jack reached out and held him down, taking patches out of his pocket and blindly putting them on Tony. Rene held him down, forcing pill after pill down his throat. Tony scratched at her neck, but Rene seemed immovable. She opened his mouth and didn’t care if he tried chocking up the water that she was forcing down his throat to make the pill go down. She looked at him angrily, as though he was deserving of this punishment.
“What the hell do you think you’re doing!” Tony demanded to know. “Where have you been? You’ll give people heart attacks—”
As Jane listened, her exasperated look calmed into a gentle smile. Tony knew it was friendship and kindness, but a deeply insecure part of him still continued to whisper,
And as she tucked a lock of her hair behind her ear, Steve saw it. The six carat rock - Brock’s grandmother’s ring. The ring that belonged to Steve.
“If you be my bride, I will break the spell on that ass,” Talia agreed, “but men are becoming more difficult to find, Stephanie. These are healthy men. Could one of them not make you with a daughter?”
Tony followed Steve into his room a few minutes later. He’d arranged a tray of food for him, with the burger Clint had made for Steve, along with a cinnamon roll, a cup of coffee, and a glass of water.
“You self-righteous, egotistical faggot!” he bellowed in his rage, and every head in the office turned in their direction. Steve was the last to turn and face him, and his was the only expression that was indifferent to the whole fanfare.
Tony shrugged in an expression of absolute ignorance. There wasn’t much he was unaware of, but this was new to him. “That’s a new concept for me, okay? It’s scary. The point I’m trying to make is, if I say no and insist on paying, I know there will be a part of you and our relationship I’ll never see. I will do the scary thing to learn about you and us,” he finished, saying it as clearly as he could. “I don’t want to know your fantasies to spice up the sex life. What we have is great, and if this was it for years to come, I’d consider myself the luckiest guy on the planet. But, it’s not just sex. It’s about you, and getting to know you. And if you need more time to trust me, that’s fine—”
“Why’s that? You can fix anything,” Steve pointed out. Tony’s downturned lips quirked up in a little smile.
“This is some spooky shit,“ Clint whispered under his breath, but Tony couldn’t stop staring all around him. He had never seen trees like this, and he certainly had never felt this way before. The clouds were not only a blanket on the earth, but it felt safe, protective in a way, a blanket to hide them from the terror and predation of Women.
A burst of loud, cheerful voices flooded the audio and Steve watched as Tony’s gaze lifted to something beyond the phone and warmed with a smile. Moments later, Lila made her way around to embrace her Uncle Tony in a tight squeeze. When Tony explained whom the recording was for, Shuri popped into view, and together the girls waved and wished Steve a good morning before informing him that they were taking Tony’s phone away so they could eat.
Steve couldn’t stomach looking at him. In the moments when he had been sprawled, hapless and concussed on the theater floor; when Tony held him and helped ease his pain with gentle fingers and laughing words; when he had woken up after a night of attentive care and medicine at his fingertips, Steve had dared to imagine that Tony was different.
As the words came out of his mouth, he wished he could shovel them back in. What the hell was that, ‘you’re a good dancer’? He cringed with his entire body, and silently prayed that someone nearby was on that level of Jumanji where the animal stampede comes through so he could have an excuse for running the hell away from everything happening in his life on this phone call.
They would have gotten away with it all, too, if it wasn’t for the long line of purpling hickeys blooming down the back of Tony’s neck. Tony hadn’t spotted them in the mirror and Steve had been too worked up the night before to resist. He didn’t even get to wish Rhodey a good morning before he was frog-marched back to his room where his stylist could clean him up.
Steve hauled him off his feet and bodily threw Tony over his hip. With a shriek of gleeful surprise, Tony landed on his back, bouncing and laughing and reaching for Steve impatiently, and Steve wasted no time stalking after him on his hands and knees. Whispers of laughter still slipped past his lips as Tony pressed up to kiss Steve senseless, and the moment he could, Tony wrapped his legs and arms around Steve’s body to urge him down, eager as he was to feel the pressure of Steve’s mass weighing him into the mattress.
Steve’s chest stuttered as he tried to take a deep breath, his breath audibly rattling in the quiet hall. “What? What does that—what happened?”
“Would you two knock me up! We have no time to waste,” Tony all but shouted at them both. Beside him, Steve groaned.
“Think about it, Stark,” Steve said as Bruce caught up to them, huffing and puffing out of breath. “Why haven’t we found Rumlow yet? How did he get away from us at the museum? Where is the only place Pierce’s surveillance doesn’t reach? And, where else will he find people desperate enough to overthrow New Yorseylvania?”
That one heartbeat of doubt was all it took. His attacker kicked him in the gut with steel-toed boots and wrestled themselves free.
Between the helplessness of his position that left his body open to any abuse and Steve’s skillful touch, Tony’s lukewarm interest quickly grew into hard, breathless excitement. His head fell back against the padded bench, luxuriating in the long, fat fingers filling his ass and unraveling his defenses with such blatant expertise. It was embarrassing how quickly Steve could bring him off, how easily he could reduce Tony to some primitive creature no more civilized than a working animal.
“‘s not easy,” Steve slurred in his defense, but instead of putting his head back down to indulge some more, he crawled up in bed to stretch out beside Tony. “Hi.”
“Although Mr. Rumlow makes an excellent point,” he started a little hesitantly, “I have to wonder if the defendant can be compared to Swinney at all. Swinney made one donation and kept track of it, so I have to wonder: did the defendant keep a similarly thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?”
Clint seconded the idea with a considering nod. “Yeah, and then he’ll be all, ooh, Steve, your roast beef hero is so long and filling—”
By the time Steve caught up to Rumlow, the villain had circled around the compound and taken an older man hostage.
“Hi everybody,” he said with a big smile. “Harvey, looking sharp, I like those shoes; Yuan, I’m loving those bangs on you, you look spectacular! Arlene,” he added, when the little girl shuffled to him in a hurry, shy but eager to hug him. He smiled and gently patted her back. “Always a pleasure. How’s your mother’s practice?”
One day after a fortnight of travel, Tony and Clint woke in the early darkness of night to find that Stephanie had already gotten a fire going and had started their first meal of the day.
“I’m sorry, Ms. Hill, but,” she said in a gentle tone before turning her attention to a bewildered Steve. “Mary from Whittaker’s office is on line three, she needs an answer from you. I told her you were otherwise engaged, but she’s insisting—”
Steve couldn’t even bring himself to acknowledge her. He looked at Brock, horrified. “You know her?”
Whenever he looked at the scattered crowds they passed, Tony thought of Bucky’s words. There were so many children everywhere he turned, children of all ages. Not many looked healthy, and even fewer looked happy, but they were huddled with their parents in their hovels.
Tony would know without Steve having made a sound: he'd know what it means to punch into metal like that. He'd be so angry with Steve; impressed, but so angry. The second Steve has his belt and has given his speech, Tony shepherds him out to the locker rooms, and throws everyone - including the medic - out. But once they're alone, he wouldn't say a word. Tony who always talks a mile a minute and is never slow about telling Steve what problem he's got, wouldn't say a word. Steve would probably be scrambling to explain himself and tell Tony why he had to, or why it was worth it, or offer any kind of explanation for defying his manager's call, and the forceful shove into the lockers rattled him almost as much as seeing Tony drop to his knees at his feet, wasting no time pulling Steve's cock out of his shorts, letting his balls hang over the elastic all pushed up and swallowing him down before Steve knows what's happening.
When they inevitably crossed into the Eastlands where Clint had first escaped the clutches of the tribe’s Chief, they were captured almost immediately. The Women came upon them in the dead of night, and Stephanie had not yet called her dragon to them for their nightly rest. Clint’s ears lay down flat in his sudden terror, and while Tony did what he could to stay close to the fearful donkey and assure him that the Women would not separate them, Stephanie placed herself between them, determined to shield them from the warriors even though she was unarmed herself.
Listen, I like Rumlow (and Rumlow/Sharon) about as much as you do (maybe even less!). We'll be back on an even keel after ch. 3, I promise.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Are you doing this on purpose?” he complained, giving his mom a warning look before turning to glare at his dad and brother. “This is fun for you, embarrassing me in front of Steve?”
“No, I’m alright, detective. I’m okay,” he promised in a hurry, not that Steve bought it. “I’ll, I just need to go home, I think. I’ll be fine.”
“So what happened that you’re free today?” Steve asked, changing the topic before the silence became awkward.
Tony’s ‘final preparations’ sounded really touching at first, and out of morbid curiosity, Steve almost wanted to read what Tony had written for him.
Distantly, Steve heard as the guards called it clear and left the office the way they came. He waited until he was sure their footsteps were lost to the elevator before easing himself and Tony back down. When he stepped down onto the floor, he reached for Tony’s thighs to hold him in place, or at least to encourage him to stay. Just because they were in the clear for now didn’t mean he was willing to let go yet.
what to tell him, which meant Tony wasn’t likely to hear the truth yet again. Quickly, he got to his feet and returned to fix them tea; he couldn't stand to see that calculating look on Steve’s face again. Every time he brought up the ring Steve either evaded or gave him a general answer, and Tony couldn’t take it anymore. Who was so important to Steve that he always had to keep their ring warm against his skin? Nothing was that precious to Tony except for Steve’s old dog tags; he never left the house without them. Was there anything of Tony’s that was even half as important to Steve as that insufferable ring?
On one hand, Steve figured that was less scary and marginally reasonable, if you squinted. “You’re a disaster,” he muttered back at Tony instead, trying not to smile about it.
The speech itself had been easy. He’d never admit it, but even after all these years, being a part of the commencement at his alma mater still filled him with awe. Scandals and mistakes aside, those kids looked at him like he meant something larger than life.
On the far side of the lab, Tony was hunched at his desk. Clearly, he was in software mode. Steve continued to move in the nearly-dark, not wanting to scare the life out of Tony with a sudden flare in the dark by turning on the lights, but the closer he got, the more he wondered how he should announce himself. Wasn’t this how murderers approached their victims, creeping in the shadows?
Tony didn’t have two brain cells to rub together for a coherent response. His brain was melting and dribbling out of his ears, but it was okay, the way Steve held him, used him, cherished him was worth it, and it was only in the scant seconds when Steve pulled away that Tony roared his disapproval.
“Or detecting,” Bucky dropped in a stage whisper, and Rhodey fished a peanut M&M out of his snack jar and lobbed it at him. Bucky, predictably, caught it in his mouth.
“You think I’m leaving you in an empty apartment with no food or help? I’m offended, Steven,” he muttered, though he looked anything but offended. “Come on, give me a grocery list and I’ll—”
“Steve, you’ve got it all wrong,” Brock interrupted him to say. “I just don’t want to see you get your hopes up. I don’t want you to get hurt.”
Before Steve could ask what he was doing, he saw Dummy come prancing around the corner, making a beeline for Tony.
“It is,” Steve confirmed, gasping softly when Tony’s tongue rolled over the head of his cock. Both he and Tony knew that he wasn’t going to come again anytime soon, so Tony’s efforts were now only for Steve’s pleasure. Steve smiled down at him and murmured praise to his pet, brimming with pride.
- which is more often than you think,” he told the audience ruefully before turning back to Stephen and speaking over their laughter. “He talks about you at least twice an hour—and I’m talking the director’s cut. You basically have a standing invitation every Christmas and anytime Steve gets the flu, wherever we are.”
All too soon, Steve pulled his fingers free, leaving Tony's twitching, gaping hole exposed between his spread thighs. Close to his first orgasm in weeks, Tony nearly shouted in frustration, but Steve wouldn’t let him have it. All he did was adjust Tony’s position and rub slow, soothing circles over his lower back.
As soon as Steve noticed that Tony was still there, that he was having an emotional crisis, he'd rush down to him, crouch down with him and try to calm him down and convince him it wouldn’t be as bad as with Vanko. They're going through so much more to catch cheaters now, this would be a clean fight. But Tony all could see was Steve's battered face, his crushed hand, and Steve would have no way to respond to that, not with words. So he would cradle Tony's face in his hands, carefully and slowly talking him off the ledge, pressing little kisses into Tony’s hair, his face, working his way to Tony’s lips, until soon he'd be cradling Tony's whole body in his own, enveloping him completely and kissing him softly, slowly, showing a completely different side of himself than yesterday's fierce lust.
“That is no rash, Steve Rogers,” Tony said with the confidence of a man who finally knew what he was talking about. “That is your code tracer. All citizens of New Yorseylvania are code traced, it allows us to monitor citizen locations and biolink vitals at all times.”
Tony listened attentively, but he didn’t have an answer to offer after Steve’s little speech. Instead, he watched Steve with a soft smile, studying his face as if he was afraid he’d forget it too soon.
Attendants helped them with their outerwear and provided them with indoor slippers to keep their feet warm, and Steve had to stop one young man from running off with his wool coat before he could fish his new favorite ornament out of the inner pocket. The attendant took the ornament from him with a promise to safely take the ornament to the kings’ drawing room.
“Is there a reason you got eight of them?” he wondered, and Steve huffed a laugh that ended in a groan of embarrassment.
Steve smiled a little to himself, and instead of thanking Clint, he reached for the nearest sweet potato. They worked together in silence for some time, until the spicey smell of the cooking sausages started to fill the air.
Steve’s touch was so light that it took Tony a moment to recognize it, but when he did, he reciprocated by resting his hand on Steve’s knee.
Before Tony could make his case, Steve clapped his hand over his mouth and gave him a warning look. Tony didn’t even have the time to be angry before the office door opened and two armed security guards walked into the room.
Those were words Steve had only ever heard in his wildest fantasies. As warm and cozy as they were right now, he could easily have shoved Tony right to the floor in his excitement to read the latest Stark Adventures smut.
A variety of framed artwork decorated the scant wallspace available between the arched, floor to ceiling windows, everything from vibrant oil paintings to charcoal sketches of figures in motion. Healthy plants of all shapes and sizes added an inviting warmth, turning the unnaturally attractive apartment into a home.
“Hey, don’t underestimate gummi rings,” Tony accused even as he had to pinch his lips in a firm line to keep from giggling at Steve’s befuddled expression. “They’re sweet, flexible. Stackable!”
“I’m not asking you to wait for him, Steve. He wouldn’t want you to, either,” Rhodes said before Bucky or Steve said anything else. “It’s not fair, and it’s a shitty situation. I get that, Steve. I just know something of what you’re going through,” Rhodes finally explained, a little more quietly. “And I wish I’d had someone to tell me it wasn’t anything I did wrong. And I was just a best friend who was too black. Howard didn’t want me alienating future investors.”
As if he had heard the sudden roar of insecurities in Tony’s spiraling thoughts, Steve chose that precise moment to turn and notice Tony standing awkwardly in the entryway of the office, staring at him.
“I made it,” Tony said simply, plugging Steve’s USB in and waiting for it to connect. “Graduation project, actually. Hey! Looks like you lucked out, Steve. It’s not dead,” he added with a big smile. “Got the key on you?”
“I hate to break it to you, sweetheart,” Steve teased back, still snickering to himself. But whatever he thought of the octopus tentacles, he did what Tony told him to do; he even picked the biggest one off the plate. “Guess you had to find out some day. I’m afraid you’re in love with a smartass. It’s terminal, no cure.”
“There has been an attack on the Kingdom,” he told Steve as they both watched the recent footage of six military jets taking off from Eisenturm. Like most of the military’s technology, the fighter jets were of Tony’s own design. “I can’t reach Rhodes or Natasha. Pepper’s last text said that Lila is safe.”
Loose-limbed and naked but for his swim trunks, Steve should have been the worst distraction imaginable. But as much as Tony wished he could join his husband in the hot water and powerful jets, Steve’s presence was also a comfort to Tony’s impatient excitement. He could work and at any minute glance up assure himself that Steve relaxed peacefully, assure himself that Steve was contended and smiling.
With a turn of his hand, Steve shifted Tony’s position ever so slightly, and with the next thrust, his cock grazed past Tony’s prostate. It was a cutting spark of pleasure, but not enough to give Tony that deep satisfaction; with every thrust, Steve drove Tony mad with pleasure, leaving him panting and hungry for more.
“Boy, did I bring you into this world just so you could die when your horse trips in a gopher hole?”
Steve stared for a moment, impressed and somewhat taken aback by Tony’s unexpectedly cheeky playfulness. “You’ll have to earn it, Stark. In my time, we would say the fastest way to a man’s heart is through his stomach. Feed me well,” he added in a low, intimate whisper, “and you’ll be my world.”
“Yes!” Tony cried with the ecstasy of a man who had been reminded of his will to live. After 276 minutes of shitty, repetitive conversations, that was arguably the most satisfying sentence Tony had heard in the history of his thirty-year-old life. In the history
Steve laughed, blushing despite himself. “We actually do have exciting plans coming up for the holidays, I think we’ll be fine. We finished up the house in Portugal, so we finally have a place big enough to host family and friends for Christmas. We’ve been wanting to do that for a long time, because usually we spend a few days with my parents then go to Mexico with Tony’s. This will be the first time we’re all together in one place, and we’re inviting our close friends, too—we’re really excited.”
It was the work of seconds to confirm that Hansen’s age on her license had been changed to make her one year older.
Banner got them an address out in Yonkers. When they matched the address to DMV records, they found the resident to be a Richard Dunn.
Mrs. Hansen told them how she’d only guessed about the cheating, but it wasn’t until one of the women he’d hired grew a conscience and called her that she knew for certain. The sex worker had seen a family photograph in the husband’s office, and told Hansen later that their daughters reminded her of a childhood photo of herself and her baby sister. That memory had inspired her to come clean with Mrs. Hansen the next day.
They had stared back at him as if he’d said he was feeling fluish with a spot of polio. As if he had personally insulted them by admitting he was a man who was free to sow his wild oats indefinitely but chose not to. The indignity!
“They won’t let us fish around in their membership data without good cause, not with their elite clientele,” Steve sighed, scrubbing his hands over tired eyes. Once he’d regrouped, he stole a quick, instinctive glance at his partner before turning back to Tony. “If you can connect any of the victims to these other websites, I’ll get a warrant for their data.”
“And stop staring at me,” Steve drawled even as he watched Tony with such adoration, as if nothing else mattered. “I feel like we’re inside of a Disney movie. Belle’s gonna come around the corner singing about the price of eggs any second.”
The night was spinning out of control, and Steve didn’t even have a hand on the wheel anymore. Before he knew it, he and Tony were marching out of the theater in the giant’s wake.
“Not connected enough,” she corrected, gently but clearly honest. “They’re business socialites, Steve. He’s their only son, they want him to be with someone who benefits the company.”
The soft whimpers and gusting moans quickly became louder and more frequent. Steve recognized the sound of Tony’s approaching his orgasm, and like a well-conditioned partner, his body responded instinctively. He swept his big palms up to Tony’s hips and all but lifted him off his feet until Tony was arching his back on tip-toe. In his new position, every thrust of Steve’s cock grazed Tony’s prostate, and Tony’s eyes rolled back as the heady, intoxicating combination of Steve’s punishing, powerful thrusts and the electric waves of pleasure flooded his senses.
Sharon glared up to the sky and took that brief moment to brace herself before grabbing her boss by the arm and towing him a little further away from the nice bar they had agreed to meet up at. There, in the nascent shadows of the alleyway, she tried to explain.
Tony wet his lips, chasing the memory of Steve’s lips on his while considering his words. “Check-ins are good,” he agreed, tracing the rounded tip of Steve’s ears with his thumbs between playing with his hair. “And you, you’ll do the same for me?”
She handed him a drink, then sat down in the swing with one for herself, and settled a big photo album in her lap.
She dangled the keys he wanted along with a pretty little pout. “Turned to ash in Brazil. But I have the keys?”
“Due to the numerous hijacked and disappearing planes in the mid-21st, our thoughtful leader Governor Alexander G. Pierce deemed the risk too great to passenger life and unaccounted collateral damage. We are safe here,” she added, though after a short pause she quietly added, “but sometimes, I wonder if it would not be worth the risk to see the stars.”
The candid collection had a special place in his heart, but the posts from events like the Cannes film festival or award ceremonies like the Golden Globes were special, and few and far in between. After all, Google and Getty Images made those professionally orchestrated photos easy to find. But Steve appreciated IBD’s choice to curate posts with the more intimate and less circulated snapshots you couldn’t easily find otherwise, like the instances when Steve’s hand rested a little lower than usual on Tony’s hip, or when Tony had stretched to whisper something in Steve’s ear and a well-timed camera captured that glorious second when Tony’s ass well and truly was the highlight of the evening.
Tony barely had time to yelp before Steve lifted him into his arms, pivoted to the left, and jumped into bed. They landed in a tangle of limbs, Tony on his back halfway under Steve’s bulk, laugh-giggling in his surprised delight. Steve crawled even closer, until he could nuzzle into Tony’s soft throat and Tony’s body was almost entirely under Steve.
“He didn’t know there was a swimsuit component,” Clint told Steve without any regard for the faces Tony was making.
“Always,” he promised, and with a smirk of satisfaction, he lifted Tony straight up so Tony could wrap his arms and legs around him.
Halfway through the movie, none of them were good for anything besides laughing, drinking, and snoring. All of Steve’s calls went unnoticed and unanswered.
“Whatever, give it to me,” Tony said in sprinting words and placed his left hand in Steve’s. “I want it, Steve.”
Steve melted into him with a soft whimper of feverish excitement, but just as he was getting into it and had both hands rucked up under Tony’s sweater, Tony pulled him away by the hair and pinned him with a heated look.
“Thor?” he called through the door as he knocked obnoxiously. “Thor, open up, it’s Father Christmas, I need you to come out here and be a good boy at work!”
Steve, and before he knew it or had the chance to prepare, Steve eased the dildo out of him and slowly pulled out.
“I haven’t accepted,” Steve said in calm, measured words. “I don’t know if I’m right for the job. Rhodes has been on the team longer, and Barton can see everything, from anywhere on the field, he’d be great—”
“They won’t find me here,” Clint promised, but Tony was already on his feet and running to the east-facing window. He pushed the shutter out just enough to peek out over the horizon. The night was dark and the wind treacherous; nobody would be foolish enough to approach his little cottage this night.
“What?” he asked, then, preemptively annoyed, he guessed, “you introduced him to Sam first, didn’t you? Damnit, Steve—”
“Stark, call for backup,” he said to Tony without so much as looking at Pierce. “I’ll be across the street.”
Steve walked away from his desk and his unfinished salad to help get the kids back on track. “Alright, everyone, yes, we have a surprise visitor. I know it’s exciting, but that doesn’t mean we’re not going to get back to our multiplication tables again.”
“Not as memorable, but they’re interested in second dates. We count them as wins,” she summarized. It sounded simple, but Natasha fell quiet then, mulling something over with care. Tony didn’t push, giving her the time and space to find her words.
Tony must have noticed that Steve wasn’t enjoying the absurdity as much as he was, because he cleared his throat and wiped the tears of laughter from his eyes. “Looks like we’ve got a second chance, babe,” he said, his voice a little hoarse after all that laughter. “You sure you want to marry me?”
“You wanna ride the bull, darling?” Tony teased, leering up at Steve through his lashes. But by now, Steve knew better than to take his exaggerated behavior seriously.
“Hey, you okay?” Tony whispered, his brows creased with concern. “You look like you’ve seen a ghost or something.”
“Not really, but my brother gets tickets through work sometimes, and he’s more of a Knicks fan,” she explained, “I just moved here from Tennessee a year ago, and we’ve got the Predators, but not anywhere near where I’m from, you know? Besides, it’s not like here,” she added with a secretive smile, gesturing around them as if to encompass to full arena. “This is so cool!”
“It’s Laura’s family recipe,” Clint said with a proud smirk, not bothering to look up from where he was folding a whole jar of mayonnaise into the other ingredients. “You’ll love it or I’ll shoot you.”
For all that he loved him, Steve couldn’t bear to look at him another minute. He got up and threw the cloth napkin in Brock’s face, then stormed out of the restaurant and their relationship.
Tony released his arms and guided them under the blanket. He left Steve to rest for a minute or two, and when he came back, Steve’s senses filled with that familiar lavender scent of the anointing oil. Tony cradled Steve’s neck in both hands, and with the firm, steady pressure of his thumbs, he worked the tension out of Steve’s neck and shoulders until Steve was no better than putty in his hands.
“Unforgivable,” he murmured in agreement against Steve’s wet lips. “You should take off your shirt so I can see how wrong she is.”
If he was going to spend this damn weekend missing Steve, then he could make damn sure Steve knew what he was missing in return.
Eleven years in the business, and Steve was still making rookie mistakes. Did he communicate openly about his insecurities? No. Did he reach out for help from friends and trusted allies? No.
“I’m sure there are nice stories,” Steve said diplomatically, and to his right, Tony perked up at his attempt to steer the conversation elsewhere. “Or,” Steve added, “perhaps, less suicidal?”
“Just Sam left?” Steve asked as his phone buzzed in his pocket with a vengeance. It sounded far louder than any other time it vibrated, and his friends gave him odd looks until Steve gave in and checked his phone.
He watched her saunter away, a fantasy coiled in the masterful sway of her hips. Unlike him, Romanov was allowed into Q’s control room without delay. 006 always got what she wanted.
Unfortunately, the only game Marple liked better than chase or fetch was keep-away. Even a decade of track didn’t hold a candle to a dog whose wishes had come true, and with a particularly elegant leap, she dove into the woods and took off.
Steve chuckled quietly despite his attempt to look upset by Tony’s nonchalant march through a downpour. “Warm up first,” he tried to say without returning Tony’s smile, “and maybe later you’ll get lucky.”
“Did he have any defensive wounds?” Steve asked as he decided underwear were overrated and pulled on his jeans anyway.
“Four-hundred and thirteen homes will be available in Southern California by May,” Steve told him from memory, “I couldn’t get a clear answer about the schools up north. They’ve had trouble with the weather.”
Tony sucked and salivated over Steve’s thick fingers like a man possessed, and once Steve wrapped his free hand around Tony’s heavy, aching cock to jerk him off, it was only seconds before Tony’s whole body seized around Steve with a violent climax. Tony’s moans and drool spilled out in equal measure over Steve’s fingers and down his forearm, and Steve curled his fingers in Tony’s mouth, stuffing it full and leaving Tony panting for breath as Steve continued pounding into him through Tony’s body spasms and involuntary clenching around his cock, until finally,
“Now get out of here before it gets too hot,” Steve said, even taking a step back into the house, as if Tony was more likely to leave if Steve stood further away.
Some people dreamed of sleeping in a bed with stacks of Benjamins, and others would covet the chance to tumble into bed with their favorite models or Hollywood A-lister. Then there was Tony, who could sit in his personal rooftop jacuzzi overlooking the Manhattan skyline and comfort himself with the idea that Steve was only running late from his lecture. Tony’s phone was an arm’s length away, and any moment it would buzz to life with an apologetic text from Steve, who would apologize endlessly for not being there to personally undress Tony for their bath at the end of the work day, and promise Tony a kiss for every second he was late.
“Give me one of those waivers,” Steve said without hesitation. “Tony, I’ve loved your writing for as long as I can remember. If my stupid college humor gets me a nod in one of your books, I’ll sign anything you want.”
“I will not. I will be no trouble, I promise,” Tony whispered uncomfortably, glancing at Jim, Natasha, and finally the camera before he caved and stared down at his own hands. They looked dry and bruised, and Steve ached to hold them in his again.
It took Tony a moment to focus on Steve’s gaze, but when Steve finally saw Tony’s attention on him, and he could see the understanding in Tony’s eyes, Steve lined his cock up with Tony’s hole and plowed into him, burying himself to the hilt. Try as he might, Tony couldn’t maintain eye contact, and Steve watched from only inches away how Tony’s eyes rolled back and his head thumped back against the wall.
They took a Lyft to Steve’s Chelsea flat on the the embankment. Steve left Tony in the sitting room to stare at the six front-facing windows overlooking the Embankment Gardens and the River Thames beyond while he tried to scrounge up something worth eating, or whatever normal people did for house guests.
“What we had was serious, Pookie, but it’s a college romance. Gender isn’t the issue, but I need to marry someone… someone more refined.”
He tried to keep his distance at first, but Steve wriggled his way closer and slung a possessive arm over Tony’s body. “Stay,” he murmured in his sleep, nuzzling into Tony’s hair, and who was Tony to deny him? There was nowhere else he’d rather be.
While Tony eagerly rolled and arched up for more, distracted by his instinct to chase Steve’s touch and tugging more insistently at Steve’s hair, Steve wrapped his fingers around Tony’s cock one at a time, his touch so delicate and gentle that Tony didn’t feel his touch until his cock was guided against Steve’s spit-slick, closed lips. Tony’s body responded like a live wire, and he choked on air as Steve rubbed his lips around over the head of his cock, spreading his spit and the precum well before breaking the seam of his lips to slide the first inch of Tony’s cock into his mouth.
Bucky adjusted his sunglasses using his reflection in window inside TD Bank, much like he had another dozen times in the past twenty minutes.
Practice was as good as he could have hoped for on two hours of sleep; adrenaline made up for a lot, but he’d need to work on his sprints later, and by the time they hit the showers, he was dead on his feet. Barely conscious of anything happening around him, Steve went through the motions of rinsing off, getting dressed, and scarfing down three substantial helpings of lunch at the cafeteria before jogging across campus to his communications lecture.
Tony rolled his eyes, but he said nothing. He stepped away briefly to shrug out of his jacket and toss it over the nearest piece of furniture, then he kicked off his shoes, too, for good measure.
“If you don’t think my personal hero would be safe in my hometown,” Tony started to say, quite serious in his tone. Like a charm, Steve’s hesitant little smile shone, and he watched Tony settle back down in bed, his body curved just so to casually leave space for Steve to move in close beside him.
“God, don’t remind me,” Tony shuddered involuntarily. “I’m never forgiving you for setting me up with him, I hope you know that. All I want is a regular guy, it’s not that complicated. Someone who’ll randomly bring me pizza and squeeze my ass now and then. Is that too much to ask for?”
“Are his walls any good?” Clint asked with deadpan delivery. It took Tony a second too long to understand what he meant. “This whole sharing an air vent thing is—”
A quick search on his phone provided more good and bad news than he’d imagined, but he picked up his muffins, plugged in the address, and started on his way. Five quick minutes later, Steve stood in Harvard Square in front of the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter. Even though the volunteers couldn’t give the food to those staying with them overnight, they themselves were allowed to have the muffins, and Steve’s night was made infinitely better by seeing the surprise light up in their smiles.
“Tell it to your pants, man,” Clint snickered, then with another obvious once-over of his brother, turned back to Steve and said, “you should’ve seen him in his prime. He—”
“Everything is okay, I promise. We can go back to bed,” he said as Tony’s phone buzzed back to life. Tony turned his unblinking stare from Steve’s face down to his own phone, and without a word, he held up the screen so Steve could see. The number was foreign, and putting the pieces together, Steve figured +46 referred to Sweden.
They were trapped. Whatever this great Sorceress was, wherever she was hiding, Clint was powerless to flee. Tony sat on his back like a drugged sack of potatoes, and he would undoubtedly fall to the ground if Clint moved too quickly.
“I’m convinced he was alive when he was alive,” Steve agreed after some quiet reflection. “But I’m not convinced he was alive the whole time.”
“That’s good,” Tony agreed, happy to stand on the curb with his hands in his pockets to wait for the their lift. Some time passed before he looked up at Steve again and said, “You didn’t have to pay for the whole session, you know.”
“I’ve been thinking, and well, there’s no doubt we're having a lot of fun. These have been some of the happiest years of my life,” Brock explained in steady, tactful words. “But next year I’ll be at Harvard Law, and things will be different. It’s a completely different world. The pressure will be greater, my family will be there, and I’ve realized that it’s finally time that I take steps to grow up and make serious choices in my life. They expect a lot from me; I plan on running for office some day.”
“Is it possible to be this lonely?” Bucky wondered between bites of his second hot dog. “Do you think it’s a permanent condition or it happens to you when you’re not paying attention?”
Somehow, that only made Steve feel more hopeless. All that time, when Steve had begged Tony to talk? When he had told himself Tony’s weird behavior was the stress of his thesis defense? If what Rhodes said was true, Tony had lied to his face all along.
Of all the problems to have before seeing your ex for the first time in ten months, what to wear shouldn’t be one of them. In the end, he pushed past all the
Tony could watch Steve undress twelve times an hour without growing tired of it, and now, after a particularly long, frustrating day, it was a dream come true. He waited for Steve to sit before wading across the small hot tub and sliding into Steve’s lap, reclaiming his earlier seat.
“...but you hate me,” were the first words out of Steve’s mouth. “Why would you—that would ruin your internship, too.”
Clark chuckled quietly to himself with the reminder of old, happy memories. “He’s a different Bruce around you. I think it’s who he could have been once, maybe.”
It was just enough of a distraction that Steve felt less anxious walking into the captain’s ambush meeting.
A hush fell over the precinct as the detectives turned as one towards the holding cells to eye the grimy drunk leaning his weight against the bars.
“You’re right,” Steve said, before Tony was out of arm’s reach. Tony turned back to watch him squirm. “I’m usually the one who has to have it together, but that’s… either way, I’m sorry. I wish I’d gotten you white flowers now, but please. They are a gift.”
Nothing about this final job sat right with Tony, and he clung to Steve instinctively for protection. “Is it them?” he wondered, glancing pointedly at the other masters. “Are they fucking me?”
“In the attack,” he said quietly, and Tony was struck by how young he seemed. “I was certain I was gonna die. I thought I’d never see my family, my Éliane again.”
“To keep one’s domicile even safer, yes, Steve Rogers,” Tony said as the doors to his home slide apart to allow them in. Tony gestured for Steve to walk in first. “Most other silver class transactions will only require your palm print.”
There was a long pause on the other end of the line before she spoke again. “Son, I know that sounds reasonable,” she confessed in a suspiciously gentle tone. “But some things we need to know early on—”
“Could he not have been a contender?” Thor wondered in a hushed voice even as he packed Bruce into the cab. Tony only glanced at him while he was in the middle of explaining Bruce’s address to the driver.
Steve launched himself at the stairs, taking them three at a time to make it to their floor in record time. Bucky had a head start, but the elevator doors were closing just as Steve tore into the apartment.
“Wisdom is wisdom, doesn’t matter who said it,” Steve countered with a smile in his voice. “But yes, if you must know, it’s adapted from Gandalf. Cops read, too, you know.”
Tony leaned in close, chasing Steve’s lips for another kiss. “Mbire needed a second opinion in his lab, we lost track of time. I tried calling,” he added, and sure enough, Steve blushed in response.
He hit the Mail button next and got to work. His fingers flew over the keyboard with a mind of their own, and Brock’s grin continued to grow as he realized at every turn that all of this futuristic shit was coming naturally to him. It was as if they’d designed everything in this world to be intuitive to him!
They sat together for what could have been minutes or hours. Eventually, Tony helped Steve to the master bath. He got the water in order while Steve undressed, and as he turned to leave so Steve could shower in private, Steve reached for his hand. Tony didn’t hesitate to follow.
The next thing he knew, Tony’s world consisted of the spicy, comforting smell of Steve’s cologne, he was floating in a warm cocoon, and he felt happier than he had for as long as he could remember.
“Not a date,” Peter yawned. “And it was good. I’ll tell you more about the day tomorrow. But I’m tired so I’m sorry to miss movie night, but maybe next time.”
“I got addicted because it felt like the only way to get over what I saw was to be high. Everything that I saw down there it was a lot,” she laughed dryly. “But I don’t regret it and I could have stayed longer, if I hadn’t have had Harley when I did…I think I just might have. And I know I can’t really go back to the army right now, but I still want to make an impact, while I can. I’m still only 34.”
Natasha worried her bottom lip between her teeth. Ignoring Tony’s cries and weak pushes, she gathered him in her arms and pulled a misplaced towel. She leaned him back against her chest and looked toward the door waiting for someone to come in and help her because she’s lost.
“I’m not a child Natasha. I know how to put the straw in the juice cup,” Clint said, but still taking the offered drink.
“And then she told me how she didn’t want me near the kids and all this other mess. And I get it. I really do. I told her I had retired then I wind up in all of this giant mess,” Clint groaned. “I tried explaining it to her, but she keeps telling me reasons why I should have stayed. And her reasons make sense.”
The few minutes spent in the kitchen passed without speaking. All three men had been worn down by the day’s events and just looking at them anyone could see that they were a few moments away from falling asleep from their spot in the kitchen.
Steve wracked his brain for reasons and when he came to one, he really wanted to slap some sense into Bucky.
“Yes, we can. They said 650 Legos for each person. They never said we had to work alone,” Bruce slyly said, turning to Sam and Thor.
But seriously he could have at least adopted a healthy kid. And if this was honestly a ploy to get Tony back home, which Ryder was fully aware it probably was, Ryder was going to have to do better at separating Tony from the recent additions to the house.
He had some things to say to Tony just as much as Tony probably wanted to say some words to Steve. But Steve had listened to Pepper and he felt going forward he would try listening to Tony.
Seeing how far they’d come since the end of that Civil War and Accords fiasco mixed with Ryder…to now being able to sit opposite one another and confide in each other was a nice change.
“I’m sure he would be much better at this than I am. Look I’m saying this all to say, it’s going to be hard losing someone you love, but you’ll have memories that you can look back on. You’ll be able to live for your mom. Don’t stop seeing her because of what some doctor said. She isn’t gone yet. Spend as much time as you can with her.”
Steve wiped his mouth again. He stood on shaky legs, helped up by Clint’s outstretched hand. Steve took it gratefully and nearly had to lean on Clint for support. Clint did the same. The two left the restroom, ignoring the curious glances they got from the guy washing his hands.
“Look Harley, as long as you are respectful and kind to Julia I am certain that Natasha won’t have any issues. Besides your mom raised you right and you’re an amazing young man with a good head on his shoulders. As long as you treat Julia with the utmost respect and love she deserves, there won’t be a problem,” Steve instructed.
“I didn’t know it then, or maybe I did, but that was the day everything started going downhill in our friendship. If I had known how much of a suck up he would have been to Howard, I would have cut off that friendship immediately, but I hadn’t. I wanted to hold onto my friend as long as I could. I waited too long to figure out Ryder wasn’t my friend. I mean Steve I literally had people telling me…and it’s only now when looking back I realized…” Tony broke off his sentence and closed his eyes.
Ryder leaned back cock slipping out of Tony’s mouth. Tony tried inhaling a large breath of air before Ryder pushed his hips forward again. His breaths came out in heavy spurts as Ryder continued moving against Tony’s chest.
“And it was true. You all weren’t my soldiers, just like the Commandos just weren’t my soldiers. In way you all easily became my family and maybe I allowed that to happen so fast because I needed some ties to this world. I needed to feel like I was gaining something, instead of feeling like I was losing everything to the point where I was losing myself”
“No, we’re going to have some fun first. Seeing him immobile like this, it isn’t fair that we shouldn’t get to partake in this fun.” she explained. “I’ve heard around that Tony Stark loves water.”
“Back in your day?” Tony laughed. “Also I’m not a little Stark and what happened to silent winter soldier thing,” Tony said. “And to be frank you’ve never seen what my lab looks like so…can’t really be a fair judge of what lab accidents do to my face.”
He was annoyed with himself for being so greatly affected by something as simple as a closed door. It was easier when there was someone in here with him that he knew. However, he was alone and it was getting dark. And hospitals were so cold. They always remained cold as though they wanted their patients to have a constant reminder that they were close to death.
Peter’s jaw clenched. “We don’t know how, but Miles apparently snuck out of his room during nap time, when we had the agents over to debrief them over the mission. One of the agents made a rather rude comment in which the end statement was saying you were more than likely dead. It took us awhile to console Miles.”
“Tony!” Steve yelled, trying to break through Tony’s panic. Then softer he said, “Sweetheart. Stop, you’re hurting yourself. Sweetheart, come here. Don’t…don’t scratch your throat. Give me your hands, please.”
And so Tony looked at Steve through half lidded eyes, wetness gathering like an ocean. Steve stared at him, not wanting to tear his gaze from Tony’s. Tony brought his hands up to Steve’s cheeks, eyes following his own hands’ movement. He ran his fingers alongside his jaw, then his ear as though memorizing everything, should he never be given the chance to do it again. It worried Steve slightly, the delicate care in which he did this as though Steve would ever leave.
He then went to the bathroom and still no Miles. His heart began to erratically pump and no reason was entering his brain. Perhaps his fear, had shut down the fact that he didn’t even ask FRIDAY to let him know where Miles had run off to.
Tony’s words were interrupted, when Steve bodily threw Tony over his shoulder standing up. “And here I was thinking that would be enough. But of course, I should know my brilliant genius needs a few more motivating factors to turn that inspiration portion of the brain off for a few hours.”
Tony raised his shoulder. “Hmmm, what can I say America has a thing for a clean-cut virgin type heroes.”
This came two months later than expected b/c honestly this epilogue was supposed to be a sweet 1k ending to wrap things up.
He was allowed three hours of alone time, before his door creaked open and a tired Ryder came in. Tony looked up from his StarkPad and smiled warmly at Ryder.
“No,” Steve growled, standing even taller over the man. “How many times has Tony asked or pleaded for you to do something and you didn’t.”
He remembered nights spent in that room, his own hands clutched tightly around Tony’s pillow as Natasha ran her fingers through his hair, her own eyes unable to close for sleep. He remembered Clint, after calling to check on his wife and kids, crawling into Tony’s closet and making a makeshift shelter in there composed of his clothes and other various items Tony had somehow mistakenly put in there…they once found a toaster amongst his shoes.
He hated how Tony immediately thought that Steve needed him to change to get him to stay. He wanted to tell him that everything that Tony was remained perfect. He wanted to tell him that his passion for his work was invigorating. He wanted to tell him that the time he spent working was inspiring because it encouraged him to work just as hard.
Peter hadn’t seen the two interact until everything went down, so he really had nothing to compare to. However, Natasha would sometimes find herself reflecting on the closeness everyone else shared before things went down. Then she would quickly bring herself back and pretend as though she hadn’t said anything aloud to Peter.
Ryder’s eyes followed the action and Steve felt the need to drop his crossed arms. Lamely he crossed his arms behind his back and ignored the noise of disappointment escape Ryder. Ryder shook his head.
He looked at the time on the clock Steve had brought to his…their room not too long ago. Tony had teased Steve over his old man clock, to which Steve had shyly blushed and teased back with saying he could teach Tony how to read one.
“Yes. The Accords allow her to access help, develop her powers, and provide therapy for all the trauma she has experienced. We do not want to restrict her powers. We do not want to criminalize her. So in order to do that she has to work with us. We need to alter her image and make sure she is not perceived as a threat. We need to do this to make her safe,” Isa explained. “You understand, right?”
And it wasn’t even the small things that Tony did for him that he should’ve thanked him for. He should’ve thanked him for always updating his weaponry, without even asking for anything in return. Hell he should’ve thanked him for being the main reason they were all pardoned and allowed back entrance to America. Clint brought his head down to stare at his lap, thinking of all the times a thank you fell on his lips, but was never brought to Tony’s ears.
“But I…I told them it was okay. They didn’t have to be scared because I wasn’t. We didn’t have to be scared and if so we had each other,” Peter said, voice catching in his throat.
“I know. It’s just a question that’s been circulating around my mind a lot, after she got together with you.”
Tony had told Steve to create a personal message system, but Steve told him the one he had was phone.
“I…ah perhaps I should have started with what I followed you here for. So everything you read in the letter is true. That was me saying everything I wanted to say the moment I came back here…everything I wanted to say only a few months after getting to know you,” Steve explained. “But I felt I couldn’t. You were everything I thought I could never have. You were brilliant, sarcastic, kind, selfless, insightful, and confident.”
Tony raised his eyes at the kid and Miles smiled sheepishly trying to cough discreetly into his stuffed penguin. “Yes, you are. Stop running or I will have to pick you up.”
“Hey, can I talk to you outside on the balcony for a second,” Steve whispered not loud enough to hear over the carol of children.
He wiped at his cheeks, a little embarrassed by his display of emotions but looking up at Peter he could see he wasn’t the only one affected by it all.
She came upon her husband, lying in a hospital bed blank expressionless eyes looking at the tv in front of him. She ran to him and wrapped her arms around his shoulders.
Steve frowned, but followed wordlessly as Bruce led him to the conference room where the rest of the Avengers, excluding Clint where. Fury and Coulson were also in the room, sitting beside one another. Natasha’s face was set in a grim and Thor seemed just as upset, arms crossed firmly over his chest.
Somewhere along, Steve realized he was no longer talking about his mom or Bucky, but instead about Tony.
“So maybe we just move forward slowly. I can’t trust you fully right now. I can’t really trust the team, but I know for the world we need each other. Maybe I’m losing my sanity or maybe I’m being selfish in wanting things to go back to normal.”
“So maybe we can take this as a starting point to rebuild. We both made mistakes in our past. It will be hard to get over it, but we are a team.”
“No, sweetheart we won’t be gone. Tony we’re here and we’re going to help you now. Okay? Will you let me pick you up?”
The word desperately clung to his lips, not ready to let go of its grasp quite yet. Steve told himself it was to not have Tony talk about something he may not be ready to discuss.
Miles looked at Peter who was still focused on his sheet and timidly leapt out and went toward the offered snacks. Ryder conveniently poured the orange bubble gum balls into his small hands.
Pepper smoothed her hands over his hair and he leant into the touch, the only good touches that he had received in the past few days. He blinked back the tears, feeling his eyelashes heavy with teardrops. Pepper moved back and sat in her seat, Rhodey soon followed her lead.
He would never admit it out loud, but he had hoped to see Miriam’s face as her sounds of laughter transferred to screaming.
“Please, I just want to see my kids. I honestly don’t know what you want from me. I am deeply regretful that your friend experienced such pain, but it isn’t due to the cause of my own actions. I would never hurt anyone in my life. I have never laid a hand on anyone, not my wife, not my children, and certainly not a man I have never personally met,” Isak explained.
Anyways thanks for all the comments, kudos, bookmarks, etc. you make me want to continue writing even when I would rather take a nap lol :)
“Did she call you and say she’s the better sibling because she never forgets things like that,” Bucky teased stepping forward to Sam.
He settled back easily into his chair and pressed call. Bringing the phone up to his ear, he listened to the thrum of the ringing vibrate in his ear. He was foolish to think that Rogers wouldn’t actually be a problem. He doubted that Miles was even sick. And honestly it was just like Tony to pick the one sick kid. He hadn’t wanted to say anything to Tony because he still needed to act as though he was truly trying.
Steve didn’t, but only soothed his hands over the back of Tony. That was the moment, Tony’s body decided to repel all the acid that had been building up in his body. Tony kept throwing up, despite his mind telling his body not to. All through it Steve hadn’t let go.
Everyone around him often complained of his early morning habits, even though they were of course never disturbed because Steve made it his mission to be as silent as possible in order to ensure he wouldn’t wake anyone up.
“I don’t know,” Steve said. “We don’t have to pick up, if you don’t want to. We can just stay here for a moment. It’s whatever you want.”
The man stared blankly at him and furrowed his brow. The woman repeated her question. The confused glare increased.
Tony was calming himself internally to stop the thunderous racing of his heart. The first piece of glass being taken out with a tweezer barely registered in Tony’s mind because he was so focused on staring at Steve’s face as his serious gaze was directed toward Tony’s hands.
“Yes, it was. I was taken and yeah…kidnapping. But I’ve gotten over every single kidnapping before. I was kidnapped once when I was four. Dad of course didn’t pay ransom, figured it was just some teenagers asking for money. It wasn’t.”
Couldn’t Ryder see he was struggling? He felt his head grow light and dots swim in his vision. He wanted the hand back on his back because it grounded him. He wanted it off of his chest. He didn’t trust that hand there.
Because all of a sudden came the clarity that Tony had been waiting for. He wanted this…this safety, Steve, his family for all the years he would have left blessed on this world. And so he raised his hand and swiped a thumb across Steve’s cheek brushing back the wetness and the dirt that had collected there.
“Sorry he heard Mr. Stark was here and wanted to come out of his bedroom,” the nineteen-year old volunteer, Jaime, said. “I tried reaching him, but those little legs have some speed on them. I can take him back to his room now.”
Tony coughed and struggled for breath. His body shook with tremors. Afghanistan. Dark. Alone. He couldn’t stop those tremors or stop the whine coming from the back of his throat.
“Would you prefer to know the answer?” Steve questioned back, closing some of the remaining distance between the two and sitting opposite of Tony who was now perched against the headboard.
“Do you have food? I’m starving?” Bucky questioned trying to lessen the ever growing tension in the air.
“Look Steve I’m tired of fighting. I’m tired of feeling empty and feeling like I am purposeless. I can’t keep going to sleep feeling like there’s a missing part of me that I lost in the past year. I know you feel the same.”
“What’s this I hear about going to the lab? Oh, are we blowing shit up. Please tell me we’re blowing some shit up. I haven’t done this in forever,” Clint exclaimed. “Let’s go now.”
“Sleep well Tony because when we get to the estate we are going to have so much fun and I would hate for you not to be awake,” Ryder sang.
But it would be better if Steve walked away, just so he would see how…see how Tony doesn’t exactly know.
The door creaked open. He stopped with the knife pressed tightly against Isak’s neck.  Beads of blood followed the blade of silver and Isak’s eyes lifted to the person who had opened the door. The look of amusement and sexual interest lit up his eyes, before cooling down into a passive expression.
“Oh?” Natasha grit. “You don’t just say oh. How could you not know Miles is allergic to oranges? He has been here for nearly half a year and I’m pretty sure Tony has everything that Miles can and cannot eat posted onto every surface of the kitchen.”
He stepped outside the shower, quickly toweling off, and threw on a pair of sweatpants and a loose t-shirt. He didn’t even chance looking at the mirror, knowing that he looked tired beyond belief. But damn if it had not all been worth it.
“I am sorry sir. I had assumed I didn’t need to reply, seeing as though you had already answered your question,” FRIDAY cheekily replied.
“But I’ve been blessed with so many things Tony like you can’t imagine and I don’t deserve a fucking inch of it. And maybe I’m selfish for wanting to take in the world’s mistake of giving me some good stuff in life. Tony I’ve done so many bad things in my life.”
Tony didn’t like how all of a sudden, he was surrounded by nearly eight girls all wearing mischievous expressions. Sophie seemed like the ring leader of whatever mission this was, until Julie came by and stepped in.
“Peter,” Tony quickly inserted before Peter could be given the chance to continue rambling. “Thank you for your concern. And trust me I’m being cautious. I have far more to lose than I ever had before.”
Natasha was just about to respond, when she heard footsteps. She straightened her shoulders and moved that her body was covering Tony’s completely. She only relaxed slightly, when she saw who those footsteps belonged to.
Ryder led him into the hotel venue and directed him to a ballroom. As if knowing of their arrival, the doors opened and in it revealed one of Tony’s greatest nightmares.
Natasha wrapped the towel tighter around his shoulders. She sighed in relief, shoulder slumping from released tension. “Yes, we’re all here. I’m sorry it took us so long.”
“Oh, you think I didn’t keep tabs on you?” Isak scoffed. “I have to in order to make sure as far away from me as possible. Unfortunately, it didn’t work this year.”
“Hey, I can walk by myself,” Tony argued, having a little bit more life into his voice. “Put me down.”
There were no arguments, but they were all gathered here tonight listening to Nathaniel’s comedy, Christmas carols, eating food, and just talking with one another. Tony was finally relaxing when he felt Steve tap him on his shoulder.
Sam raised a brow. He looked to Thor then to his building. His brow furrowed and he looked at Tony slightly. Tony caught the mischievous look and briefly wondered if he should intercept what Sam was planning. He knew he should, it would be the proper adult thing for him to do.
Wanda closed her eyes in concentration. “I can’t…I can’t feel him at all. Usually, I can, but it seems like he’s blocked me. Vision they didn’t tell me there were people who could block me from entering their mind.”
He exited the classroom amidst whispers of them talking about Tony. Even their professor had tried discreetly getting a view of Tony. Tony poked his head in and waved, before closing the door behind them.
Tony paused in his story, mouth tilted in a sad smile. “It’s funny, you know. I know right now he’s a bad person, but when I think of how he was the one who first taught me how to drive…well I don’t know I can’t…couldn’t help, but to reflect on it fondly. It’s messed up isn’t it?”
“Where in the world have you two been? I’ve looked and could never find you and well I just assumed Thor was somewhere in Asgard doing some royal godly stuff or something,” Tony waved. “But why are you two here together?”
“Three months into finding Bucky. I looked into the Winter Soldier and had a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent do some research before deleting any evidence of me snooping. And that’s when I found out.”
“That was an accident,” Ryder stressed. “It was an accident. In the report they even said it was not my fault. The accident was not my fault. Why do you keep insisting that it was? It wasn’t. It wasn’t.”
“Just let me check that everything is good to go. Then you can get Harley and we can leave,” Ryder said. “Meet you two both at the front desk say at a quarter till ten.”
His body began to convulse and he began to dry heave. Heat rolled off his body into the air, making it nearly insufferable to breathe. He felt the corners of his eyes start to warm. Every image surrounding him became distorted and it seemed as though everything was blurred. No solid image could be surfaced into his mind. He felt that weight press up against his forehead.
Well, he didn’t need much words to get his point across. Plus he knew that Ryder would just thrive if he were to engage. His power had often been in his ability of manipulation through language. Of course now he was having to deal with someone who would not so easily be entreated to how masterfully he corrupted the human language.
“Steve I may have been brainwashed for years and some things I may have forgotten. But I did not forget your face when you were lying or the face you make when you’re talking about someone you like,” Bucky teased.
“Thank you. You know I am all for originality. I mean after all I am Tony Stark,” he said trying to inflict every bit of confident arrogance he could into that statement.
Peter went into the kitchen with Miles and Tony came over to sit on the couch Steve was sitting on. Steve watched as Tony stretched out on the couch and turned toward Steve.
There are not enough excuses or even the most sincerest of apologies that could make up for this 7+ month hiatus. So I shall not bother you all with that, after all you came for a very much overdo update. Needless to say I am thankful for your patience (and also really nervous for the response of this chapter. I feel literal butterflies in my stomach) and hope this chapter is thoroughly enjoyable because I truly enjoyed writing it.
Something must have given away in her expression because the next thing she knew there was a sharp exhale from Rhodey and the sound of Thor breaking the chair’s arm handle, he was sitting in.
So I am deciding to let Harley's mom live because I have an interesting story-line with that. Also good news Ryder's vindictive ways will be exposed at the latest by Ch. 20! So we don't have far to go before the reveal :)
“I’m glad you’re helping out. The kids really like you there. Though I am hoping that maybe you just stop having secret meetings with your little black widows. I’m pretty sure last week, one of your little spies hacked into my phone and downloaded videos of black widows.”
Steve needed to start coming up with ways that would occupy his time, until Tony would be allowed back into his lab. That was one of the promises he made to the hospital staff, in exchange with letting him take Tony home early. He had promised he would make sure Tony wouldn’t be doing anything too physical or requiring extensive energy for the next few weeks.
“And I’m going to therapy. That helps. Steve look it’s not all going to go away in a few weeks and I’m sorry if you thought that. But look I promise you that nightmare on the couch was not because of you. You just have to believe me and if you will just actually listen for a-”
“You’re good with them you know,” Steve said as they took a sit in the waiting room. Natasha smiled softly. “No, really. Those girls truly love you and admire you. I mean I can tell by the throbbing in my back, where one of your little black widows threw a toy at me.”
Peter quickly silenced whatever Miles was about to say. “Okay, Miles. What did we say about being quiet?”
“A dog circus show isn’t the worst thing,” Karen defended herself, leaning back in her chair and taking a sip of Tony’s orange juice.
“That looks really good,” Peter said as one chef began mixing his ingredients together. “Though I would do without the licorice.”
The two children laughed at Tony and shook their heads. Tony tilted his head backward. “That’s it I’m being betrayed by my whole tribe. I give you all my love and as soon as the next bright thing comes along I am pushed to the side.”
“Bucky still doesn’t really talk to me. I get that he’s recovering. So I know it’s a lot, but Tony…those ties have been cut. I sent a letter and a phone and not once did he use it. I was trying to protect him from the news of Bucky killing his parents, when I should have been protecting him from me.”
It wasn’t fair how everything in this room was just so damn perfect. Every time Tony closed his eyes and woke up everything was placed back in their respective place. It annoyed him and it terrified him because he had no idea how long he was here, if nothing ever changed.
The man looked dazedly at Cali, before nodding his head. Cali remained for a few minutes, before having to head back. Wanda looked at Steve and nodded her head. Steve grabbed a nearby sketchbook and listened to Wanda as she relayed what she saw in the man’s mind.
Tony sighed aloud. “I know, which is why after this I’m taking him to the park so he can run off some of his energy. I mean we’ll probably stop to get something to eat because it’ll probably be Miles’ lunch time and I know Peter will probably be hungry.”
“That’s really good that first he felt comfortable enough saying that to you and then being able to say that to himself. Means that he’s probably been out of that relationship a while without ever realizing it.”
“No, I’m actually leaving with Bucky to stay at Sam’s,” Steve said hoping that Tony got it without ever actually saying it.
Peter turned toward Steve and raised his eyebrows, when Clint said lover boy. “Lover boy,” he mouthed to Natasha.
Steve looked at Bucky. Bucky nodded his head. “It’s true. Steve we have watched two hours of this. We need a break.”
He pulled the hospital gown and his fingers trembled as it fell easily off of his shoulders. He could see the hand shaped bruises leaving trails all over Tony’s body, some of which rested near his hip bone and disappeared underneath his boxers. There was scrapes at his knees as though Tony had tried crawling away and the carpet had burned them. There was the obvious weight loss, the way Steve could see Tony’s ribs as he inhaled.
Tony smiled and looked behind him as Steve walked away. Ryder immediately settled his hand on Tony’s lower back and steered him away. He wanted to say so many things and he wanted his hand to press so hard on Tony’s back that it left a bruise. He wanted to scrape his nails at the soft flesh of Tony’s hipbone and remind him that his body belonged to him and him alone…Steve had no right to go around making dinner for what was his.
“Tony, I apologize for my behavior tonight. I truly do. It was wrong. I just sometimes I get fearful that I will lose you and disappoint you. You are the greatest mind of all time and you are here with me and that makes me feel special. However, it also makes me realize how much it can all go away,” Ryder said as he continued walking in the hallways.
The kids laughed and tried mimicking Marley’s voice, to which she rolled her eyes and stated that, “This accent is a level of high standing.”
He then sent off a text to Pepper who reminded him that she needed him at the office for some meetings he couldn’t miss and that this time she meant it. She had said she’d told Happy to not drive him anywhere else besides SI, no shortcuts or anything.
He looked down at Tony and began to run his fingers through Tony’s hair. The humming trailed off into quiet breathing and for a second Steve thought that Tony had fallen asleep, before Tony turned his face upward to look at Steve.
She picked at them and then looked at Steve. Her gaze was haunted, but there was something loose in her shoulders. She hadn’t looked as tense as she did before. Though she still looked as though a burden bore heavy on her back, it didn’t seem to stretch all throughout her body, like it had before.
He quickly leapt onto the floor and looked as though he was taking off his shirt. Miriam raised an eyebrow at the bathtub then to Tony. Miriam shook her head silently and motioned the two unfamiliar faces forward. The familiar face stood back.
“I couldn’t even depend on myself to bring him back home. I am the leader…I’m Tony’s…I’m his…I have to be the one to help him because I didn’t even do anything to bring him back. All I did was wait on the sideline, until Wanda and that guy were able to bring a location. And even then Natasha was the one who found him. I did nothing.”
“Thanks, umm thanks for coming to get me,” Tony said as though he was thanking someone for simply picking him up from the mall…like someone had went out of their way to find him.
Tony’s eyes followed the two as they playfully fought throughout his lab, DUM-E and U each coming to either Sam’s or Thor’s defense.
“You don’t have to talk about it, but…I just…I’ve thought about it and I can’t figure out why you didn’t come to us before and tell us about Ryder. I mean I know that abusers can manipulate you into making it seem like you shouldn’t tell anyone. But why didn’t you come to Rhodey and I when he did something to you the first time? Did we do something to make it seem like you couldn’t come to us with something like this,” Pepper inquired.
“Now that I agree on,” Steve exclaimed. His head tilted to the side to look at the clock and saw it was nearing the time to get the kids up and ready for school. “Looks like we wasted a lot of time. Few minutes? Where?”
“Exactly! It’s like Tony’s not even in a relationship. I’ve tried asking him you know about dates, but silence. You know how much Tony likes to talk.”
Steve wanted to argue the same about Tony. He had sent a letter and a phone, but Tony hadn’t called. He wanted to tell Pepper he tried, yet he couldn’t deny that right now he felt like he hadn’t tried at all.
“Tony I have to warn you Miles hasn’t taken to you leaving him back here all that well and then with you not even visiting,” Karen said glaring at him. Tony shifted at the spot feeling guilty. “Even when Peter came last week Miles didn’t want to play with him and Peter is Miles’ favorite person besides you.”
“And you probably like a greedy whore just kept asking for more didn’t you. And I don’t know why I’m still here. I should have left you a long time ago, but I had hoped that you would mature. I had hoped that I being around would change you for the better,” Ryder remarked as he caressed Tony’s cheek.
Just as he was getting up to approach the man, a doctor came to the man and led him away. Steve silently hoped that the doctor would be offering good news. Struggling to lose sight of the man’s face, Steve tried picking up the magazine. Maybe the details of whether Jennifer was back on the market or not.
Natasha walked toward the doctor, who looked pained. “Ms. Romanoff and Mr. Rogers I am sure you can understand what I had to do.”
Isak lifted one shoulder. “I cannot presume to know about my brother’s life as I have told you previously, I did not keep up with the man. Sure, I had hoped that he would change, but I had hoped he would change far away from me. However, in saying this I am deeply apologetic for whatever pain my brother caused your friend.”
Natasha was startled by the hazy blank expression of Tony. His body shook so violently Natasha was briefly scared that he may shake his body into a near convulsion. He shook his head back and forth as Natasha stepped closer to me.
“You know Tony and I. We’re complete opposites. Ever since the day I met him we would clash. There was something refreshing about that because ever since I woke up everyone wanted to treat me like someone to worship. And I hated that. They wanted me to be what the stories were. And it got tiring of having people need you to be something above the normal person. And Tony saw that. He didn’t treat me like someone whose ground that I walked on should be kissed.”
Miles at this time had woken up in Tony’s arm and leaned forward. He narrowed his eyes in a fashion that Rhodey recalled as
Ryder actually began to look fearfully at him, hearing the way Steve’s voice had deepened and his stare had deepened into this cold glare.
After nearly two weeks of taking care of a recovering Miles, Tony could no longer use him as an excuse to avoid the Avengers. While he was worried that Miles still had a mild case of pneumonia for two weeks, Tony used this to spend time with the child and not the grown children downstairs. However, once Miles had slowly gained back his energy and appetite Tony realized he couldn’t hide with them on his floor forever.
Tony shook his head, deciding that he wasn’t about to disagree with Pepper right now. The three of them continued talking, until Rhodey did have to leave to make it in time to his PT. Pepper soon left after, once she was certain the boys were only a few minutes away. She didn’t want Tony to be by himself because she knew how much he hated hospitals, especially when he was the patient.
“Alright, I’m coming. I’m coming,” Steve said as he was dragged away by Harley who was insisting time was ticking. “Can I please kiss Tony goodbye.”
He hadn’t talk to his ma like this in years, instead choosing to do it inwardly in passing. He wondered if his ma was disappointed that he had forgotten her in all of the mess that he had found himself in.
“What’s going on in that head of yours,” Pepper greeted back, moving to sit herself in the chair besides his bed. “Also this is for you. I know we’re above the age where stuffed animals are appropriate, but I couldn’t resist. If anything, you can always give it to Miles.”
“Harley! You can’t just leave every single time you start losing a game. That’s unsportsmanlike conduct. Sometimes you have to lose, to know how to win,” came Steve’s voice.
Tony wasn’t getting this. Okay, just rip it off like a Band-Aid. He hated the maker of that expression.
“I’m not mad at you over the Accords…that’s fuck….” Clint struggled with himself for a few seconds. “I shouldn’t have even fought in a war that didn’t concern me, but I did and in that I lost all the good things I never deserved in the first place. I lost my wife and kids. I lost the Avengers because we were fucking broken. I lost my brother,” he rasped looking at Tony.
“Yeah, I’m fine. I don’t know guess I’m just a little tired, but nothing that some food won’t cure. Also fruit punch is definitely a child’s juice. We could have at least gone for grape juice. Oh, or white grape juice that’s the best.”
“Sorry,” he apologized, thinking the reason for Bucky’s tension was because of him sobbing onto Bucky. “I…I didn’t mean to just unload on you like that. I don’t know what happened.”
“So come on, prove to me you can go head to head with me. You like fighting so much, yeah? So fight me.”
“And I know I’ve said this many times, but it begs to be repeated since none of you are getting it through your heads,” Ryder said, taking a cursory glance over all three of them, “Tony needed this. He needed someone taking control again and since you could not fulfill that role I stepped in.”
“I know that when you were with her, you would write down things that she would say because you loved her and you trusted her. You trusted her words because she lived through them. And then when she started forgetting you would remind her of the words she spoke to you so she could remember. You had a book full of those quotes. Then it was taken from you wasn’t it?”
“Don’t leave,” Tony rasped his hand rubbing his throat to calm the roughness in it. “I didn’t notice FRIDAY put on one of your boring history documentaries. Must have been so boring it woke me up, but it’s also boring enough for me to go back to sleep too.”
Suddenly, Steve’s phone began to vibrate in his pocket. He took it out and looked down at the screen.
“You look like someone’s pulling your teeth,” Pepper chuckled as she situated Miles on her lap. “Listen Tony, you know what your heart desires. If at the end of the day you feel weightless and your heart is singing in your chest, because of Steve then feel hopeful and pursue that hope.”
He clawed at his chest, trying to find some way to open it up so he could breathe. It didn’t make sense, but it did. He just needed to find a way to breathe, but he couldn’t.
“Why did you bring them?” Tony said pointing to the journalists. “Also what is this all for? Ryder I would much rather not to be surrounded by…goodness how many people are in here? What are we at, maximum occupancy?”
Tony pushed at Steve’s chest and tried to further the distance between them. “Let go of me! Let go of me! I said no touching! No more touching. Stop,” he cried tears now running freely down his cheek.
He didn’t notice the other Avengers moving around them, their faces tired yet joyous at the same time. Their voices were muted against the backdrop of Steve and himself. Tony stepped closer and felt his hands reach out to rest upon Steve’s chest, as though trying to make sure his heart was still beating.
“Would it help it, if you knew? If you knew the answer to whatever question you wanted me to answer,” Tony whispered, his own eyes having a thin sheen of water over them.
Tony looked down at him, knowing that with the right twist of his hips he could completely unravel Steve’s hopes of going slow. They could save that for the last one, but right now he was in charge and if Tony’s hips were determined to grind downward in a quick pace that Steve couldn’t help but chase…well Tony was always a strong competitor.
“Well, everything has to be placed in its original order. All blocks must be separated by color. Each group has a limit of 1,950 Lego blocks,” Natasha instructed.
He made sure to include sapphire that was nestled in a thin band in the middle of the ring. It was almost like a stream of the ocean had found its place in this tiny piece of grounded earth. He ran his fingers over the cool metal and looked at the tiny words inscribing the middle of the ring.
Steve bit his lip and looked at him. “Would it help you, if you were to tell someone? If I asked you, and you were to answer…would it…would it help?”
“Out of all the days,” Pepper rolled her eyes. “Okay, Tony clean up. Fingers better be sparkling. Go shower and be back down here in 30 minutes.”
“This is great Peter. Truly,” Steve commended, blinking away the tears as he started to move the car.
“It’s just that I think it’s aces to be able to court my fella,” Steve said and Tony wished for nothing, but to see the mischievous glint that Steve got in his eyes whenever Steve gave back what Tony gave.
With promises of coming back tomorrow the two began to leave. He stopped Peter just before he left, “And Uncle Tony sounds good, kid.”
“As you all know this Gala is meant to allow those within our line of work to come together, have a good time, enjoy some entertainment, and raise money for the Maria Stark Foundation. For those new here the money going toward programs that help orphanages, give resources to underprivileged areas, improve the education of all children, and more. So thank you all for joining me for another year.”
“Fury, if you do this you can only pray that they don’t kill you for this,” Coulson argued, trying to speak sense into Fury. “Come on, don’t play with fire.”
Before Tony was even able to break off a piece, Clint came swooping by and took the plate from Tony.
“I don’t know how to feel. I feel numb inside Steve,” Tony whispered, finally. “I…I think of Ryder and I feel nothing. I know I’m supposed to hate him, but Steve I don’t feel that in my heart. I feel empty like…like there’s nothing there.”
He had for a moment honestly believed that Ryder was taking him to meet his parents. Then that moment was quickly gone, when he realized that the ride to the airport was much shorter than the ride that they were on.
Ryder looked down sadly at Tony. “Poor Tony. You always have such high hopes, but it’ll be a domino effect. Steve will be the first to leave.”
“Miles what did we tell you? You have to stay in bed until you get better,” Karen sighed. “You won’t get better unless you rest.”
“So I thought I would finally try being good and maybe the world would forgive me and give it all back to me, but it fucking didn’t. It fucking didn’t,” Clint hoarsely cried out. “Laura wouldn’t answer my calls and in turn wouldn’t let me speak to my kids. I was basically a criminal hiding in Wakanda. I wasn’t an Avenger. We weren’t Avengers. And I was fighting against you and I didn’t know why.”
“Oh, I’m sorry. I’m Ingrid. I’m here with my family. I don’t want to sound like a creeper, but I was looking and wondering if maybe you would be interested in having dinner with sister. She couldn’t believe that Tony Stark was here at the same beach, so I figured I would be the brave one to ask on her behalf. She’s had a crush on you for ages.”
She had a friend…well as close a friend as the Red Room would allow that hadn’t dealt well with the abuse suffered from the Red Room. And when she had found Tony sitting by himself in the bathroom, staring blankly at the wall, body curled around the toilet her mind was brought back to finding her own friend…though their states of consciousness were far different.
“How are you feeling about that kid,” Tony questioned brushing back a strand of hair that had fallen on Harley’s face.
A few minutes later Miles had cleared his plate and Steve was wondering what they should do until Tony woke up or whatever they were doing in that room was finished.
Peter shrugged. “I…well I mean it’s nothing you need to like worry about, but um there were some kids at Karen’s a few weeks ago that might have heard Miles talking to one of his friends. He heard he still slept with a night light and
To any other observer, it would be hardly noticeable. But Tony had picked up on those slight alterations in his expression. He had too. Those changes in expressions, often saved him from the hard press of a palm going against his cheek.
“No, I have to make up for it Bucky. I can’t…I have to be enough this time to protect him. It has to be me this time,” Steve told him sternly.
“FRIDAY make sure you put a note aside for me reminding me to buy more of Natasha’s make-up and replace it,” Tony stated grabbing his phone and heading out of his bedroom.
“I know the instances that drove you to take on this persona of your brother, but you should have no fear. You know I will always have your side, Ryder. I just need you to trust me. I can make all of this go away, but you need to let me know,” Tony tried again.
