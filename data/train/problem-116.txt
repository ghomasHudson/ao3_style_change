"You're talking about that self-help book again, aren't you?" Sherlock raised one eyebrow challengingly, and saw John nod.
room has been transformed into a guest room, not yours. Yours hasn't changed one whit since you moved out. What happened to all of her childhood mementos? Packed up and locked in the cellar? Or were they taken directly to the dump?"
"How was your holiday?" Mrs Hudson asks gently and from her contrite expression, John can see that she already knows the outcome. He nevertheless gives a brief summary of the events with Sarah. "Well, I've never really liked that woman," she replies, and purses her lips as if she had bitten into a lemon.
John's eyes snapped tensely to Victor, who was leaning against the sink with his arms crossed, glaring silently at the intruder.
The man being addressed remained silent, tilting his head as if he were taking in a particularly interesting show.
"Oh my God..." John broke off and rubbed the back of his neck in an attempt to collect himself. "She... she also said that the responsible party had been caught."
John blinked in irritation a couple of times, trying to understand the intention behind her words. "You want to hear it from me?"
His skin was covered in goosebumps and icy-hot shivers ran down his spine. The arousal that collected in his groin was so concentrated he could barely endure it anymore, until it discharged with a ferocity that Sherlock had never experienced before without a knot. He felt every microsecond of John swallowing around his cock, wheezing as he grabbed breaths in between through his nose. He continued to stroke Sherlock's hypersensitive gland until the last ripple of his climax had faded. Only then did he withdraw his fingers and let go.
Sherlock sat up to help John struggle out of his t-shirt, then tossed it carelessly off the bed. John's jeans and underwear followed moments later. He interlaced their fingers, pushed John back down onto the sheets, and kissed a trail from John's shoulder down to one of his nipples, which he then suckled between his teeth, nibbling it gently. John's breath caught. He arched up toward Sherlock, moaning softly and clasping Sherlock's fingers.
"Now I remember! You're the partner of that detective, that Sherlock Holmes! Wow, what a coincidence that I ended up with you! I'm a big fan of your blog!"
When the door to Victor's adjacent bedroom opened, he turned onto his side again to hide the bump in the blanket.
Sherlock does as he's told and opens his eyes, turning his head towards John. He nods curtly as if to make John understand that everything is alright. His lips are trembling.
As much as John would have liked to replace Sherlock's hands with his own, to kneel before him and take his damp erection into his mouth – there was no way in hell he was going to ignore page 64 of the manual.
The ominous cocktail Moriarty had concocted was now flowing through John's body, setting off unknown chemical reactions in his cells and nerves. Had Sherlock signed the death sentence for the man he loved?
sister! – so little that you wouldn't tell me something like that? I thought you'd lost your best friend, which is bloody bad enough, but not your lover! John?!"
Sherlock felt a flutter of pride in his chest, and it was reflected in his smile. He flew down the stairs ahead of John and onto the street, barely waiting until John had pulled the door shut before flagging down a taxi and climbing inside. As soon as John had slid into the backseat with him, he gave the driver the address and launched into a brief rundown of the details of the case for John.
Sherlock hails a cab and sits in the back seat. He seems to be nervous, continuously fidgeting back and forth. His fingers drum endlessly against his chin, while his bloodshot eyes scan the outside world. He looks very tired, John thinks, and decides to try and get Sherlock to go to bed as soon as they return.
Of course the tradesmen were well aware what the impetus had been for the express order. And yet hadn't Sherlock always made it clear that he didn't need John for anything? Therefore, he clenched his teeth, ignored the lecherous grins, and concentrated on his meal.
He watched the ashes on the end of his cigarette glow as he sucked on it, and blew the smoke up into the morning sky over the Thames. He carelessly tapped his fingers against the filter, flicking the ashes over the turquoise railing, then watched as they were carried off by the East wind, and smiled.
"I get what you're saying. It's... weird. We haven't actually known each other that long, and yet we've had this connection between us for a few years now. A connection that we... didn't want to deal with before... or weren't equipped to. But..."
. With a few clicks, he finds a discrete website for erotic supplies. Said product is a black vibrating butt-plug in the form of a droplet with a T-shaped base. Two motors, one in the bulky end and one in the slender base can be operated individually and are thus capable of stimulating both prostate and perineum with various types and levels of vibration.
John tried to breathe evenly, tried to blink away the tears that came unbidden to cloud his vision. Frowning, he scrolled down to the last message.
They stood there in silence for a while before John gave himself a nudge, squared his shoulders, and turned around to leave the cemetery without saying good-bye.
He pushed his pants down past his hips with feeble hands, kicking them off his legs. Then he tugged at his t-shirt but couldn't manage to get his arms and head out before he was flooded with a hot wave of lust that made him shiver. He was overly aware of the way his anal sphincter squeezed together as if grasping for something, only to come up empty and relax again to release more moisture. The air in the bedroom was heavy with the fragrance of omega essence, which served to further cloud his mind.
Countless minutes pass during which they lie next to each other and enjoy their newfound intimacy. John’s nose tip nuzzles Sherlock's cheek and he looks at his pensive his face, gets lost in the watery blue eyes. As John tries to manoeuvre himself into a more comfortable position, Sherlock clings even tighter to him, pulling him inexorably closer to his own body. "Don’t go."
John looks up and tries to recall the context. His brain is not quite right. A small smile haunts Sherlock's lips as if he understands very well what's going through John's head. (Bloody hell.)
John looked up in surprise. Of course he knew that alpha-omega bonds were sometimes dissolved, but it was extremely rare. He'd never actually met an alpha – much less an omega – who had dissolved their bond.
A few seconds later, the two men arrived at the door to the office to which Mycroft usually retired when he visited the club. As soon as they entered, Sherlock saw that they were correct after all. At least partially.
Sherlock's orgasm had set off a chain reaction. The muscles contracting around Victor's cock and the relentless stimulation of his prostate swept him off his mental feet, sending small shockwaves down his spine with tendrils zinging all the way out to his fingertips. Simultaneously, he felt Ryan pulsing inside him as he pushed in hard and came.
Sherlock rolled onto his back and groped for John with insistent fingers. John immediately reappeared over the omega, and surged back inside his red-hot body in a single fluid motion. Sherlock wrapped his arms and legs around John as if he couldn't stand to have so much as a single millimetre of space between them.
John shook his head and turned to face Sherlock, blinking at him in confusion. "There was a time when I always heard 'Punch me in the face' when you were speaking, but it was usually subtext."
"Are you all right?" one of the shop employees asked. She stood in the doorway of the shop, watching John with a grimace. She looked as if she were about to be sick any moment herself.
Sherlock couldn't help noticing that John was avoiding any more intimate parts of his body, not even trying to seek a path underneath his layers of clothing to establish skin contact. That was probably because of their previous conversation about Jean-Baptiste and Hector Martin, whose relationship appeared to have been far from consensual and healthy.
Some time passed, during which Sherlock couldn't hear anything at all. His own breaths and heartbeat were his only company. The buzz of the electricity in the wall. Occasionally a car passing in the street. A bird chirping.
After a good, hard look in the mirror – his eyes were bloodshot, as was to be expected, and his face dotted with feverish red blotches – Sherlock spun around and joined John in the kitchen, battling a sense of frustration. He shoved his hands into the pockets of his dressing gown and looked down at the table, head lowered.
Sherlock set the phone he'd been reading from on the nightstand and examined John's back, the outlines of his muscles visible beneath his t-shirt. He pushed himself up into a sitting position and waited tensely for John to say whatever it was he needed to.
"No, no, really, no," John protested. He was just reaching for the side of the frame when Victor held up a mirror in front of him.
"John?" he said, as if to chase away the mirage. But it didn't disappear. "You came..." Sherlock whispered between two frantic breaths, as his alpha took in the scene before him.
They bought themselves some fizzy drinks and looked around for somewhere to sit. Since their usual spot underneath the chestnut tree was already taken, they spread out on the lawn across the way and continued their discussion. Curious, Victor observed the other student. He was wearing that awful jumper again and had his attention on something elsewhere. Victor followed his gaze and found a lecturer standing in front of a statue with three of Abigail's classmates, talking animatedly with them. Victor couldn't tell from that distance whether he was explaining who the statue was of, or whether their conversation was on another topic entirely. He could also do little more than guess which of the individuals had caught Charlie Brown's attention.
Sherlock had no idea how long his internal battle went on, but in the end he lay shaking in bed, soaked with sweat, and wishing for nothing more than a large dose of Seven...
"So..." John ventured, sucking his bottom lip in between his teeth as he cast about for the right words. "Does that mean... erm... it's none of my business, of course... but... have you had... you know, since..."
Several tense seconds passed before Sherlock had collected himself enough to continue speaking. His voice was raw with grief. "He left something for me before he was taken away. A letter." John immediately thought of the box that Mycroft had mentioned to him, and knew that whatever Sherlock was going to say next had to do with Redbeard's death. Still, he wanted to let Sherlock tell the story himself.
"Sherlock's alive. He's in a safe house outside the country, but based on what this letter says, I need to assume that information regarding his location has ended up in the wrong hands," Mycroft explained matter-of-factly without so much as batting an eyelash.
Many, many, maaaaaany thanks to our wonderful translator SwissMiss without whom this story wouldn’t exist in English – certainly not in this quality! Bella and I are so very grateful for all the work you’ve put into this and are really happy to have made a friend! All the best, many hugs and kisses to you!
long, generally," Sherlock responded lazily, unwilling to separate himself from his alpha. "This here... is... more."
Sherlock's pulse was racing and his heart was pounding painfully against his ribcage. He watched in increasing panic as Anthea held up her phone, turned around, and revealed another person in the frame. Detective Inspector Lestrade.
"Good... It's good to see you," John said after a time, during which they did nothing but stare at each other.
Love? Love was an illusion. A euphemism for a biochemical process that took place without input from the individual and faded over time.
Black spots danced before his eyes, and he kept sucking in frantic breaths, worried he was going to faint. The panic made him hyperventilate, and he realised that his face was damp with tears. He roughly swiped at his eyes and cheeks with the balls of his hands, and scrunched his nose. Finally, with a sense of relief, he found the card he was looking for in the furthest corner of the trunk, and held it to his chest so it wouldn't slip out of his trembling fingers and flutter to the floor.
Lorraine rang a short time later to ask where John and Sherlock were. Apparently Harry wasn't back yet, so their parents had no idea about her confrontation with Sherlock. John decided not to discuss what had happened over the phone, which would only dredge up a boatload of things they had no solution for at the moment anyway. Instead, he apologised to his mother and said he had an upset stomach and preferred to remain at the hotel.
Distracted by all of the orders coming in, Victor kept losing sight of the two of them, but he still had to grin whenever he saw how Abigail never let up with Sherlock, kept pulling him in closer as if she'd reserved his services for the entire night. At some point, however, Sherlock did manage to tear himself away and escape to the loo, muttering an apology. Abigail used the break to go over to Victor at the bar and order another drink.
John wasn't even man – to say nothing of alpha – enough to die on the battlefield. No, he'd become the victim of a radicalised teenager on his day off.
John watched with both fascination and confusion as the group stood there in a row waiting, flanked by two beefy armed betas. They were all young and naked, aside from the bite protector. And there was something else they had in common that was impossible to overlook: arousal and lust, coupled with hopelessness and fear.
It wasn't even as if the powerful alpha of the pair had died in the line of duty. No, a blow-out on the motorway had killed his omega instead, transforming James Sholto into a grief-stricken figure. John couldn't say what strings the alpha had pulled to be allowed to return to the front, or whether he might even be driven by a secret death wish. John could empathise with the latter only too well.
"I'm sorry, John. I didn't know you'd take it this hard. I didn't think it through properly. Please forgive me."
Sherlock felt the muscles in John's arms tighten to keep him from moving and tried to make some logical sense of John's words.
"If Moriarty's alive then... and one of his cronies has taken over his business dealings... what in the world does he want with me? Why send me this letter and why in this format?" John asked, clearly vexed. He could not for the life of him fathom a reason for why he should suddenly be so important. "And what's the point of the message? Who are the liars? Who's Snow White?"
After Cilia had also withdrawn for the night, Sherlock went into the guest room. He changed into his night clothes, cleaned his teeth, and got into bed. Although he was tired, he didn't feel like sleeping yet, so he decided to read for a while.
Slowly, almost reverently, Sherlock slid Victor's jeans past his hips and pushed them down his legs until they pooled in a heap at his feat. Using his nose, his lips, and the tip of his tongue, he nudged Victor's erection beneath the last layer of material before shoving his hands inside and finally removing Victor's underpants as well.
"Ah. Yes..." Mycroft fell silent for a long moment. John would have liked nothing better than to know what was going on inside his head, but he waited patiently for a possible explanation for the rest of the letters. When Mycroft returned to the present, he gave John a speculative look. "Sherlock was always the more sensitive one amongst us," he said, and John didn't know whether that was a criticism or simply a fact. Mrs Holmes had said much the same thing the other day.
Sherlock sighed and let go of the hem of his t-shirt, which he had been about to pull over his head. "What is it now?"
John kissed his way lazily down Sherlock's neck, dug his teeth into the sensitive spot underneath Sherlock's ear, and breathed in the other man's familiar scent. Sherlock inhaled sharply and grasped a handful of John's hair, pulling him closer, as John's fingers slipped inside Sherlock's open shirt, stroking his warm skin.
"He... gives us away. Lends us out. That's happened to three of us so far, but... I think he'll do it with all of us sooner or later. As soon as another omega draws his interest." She gave Sherlock a pointed look.
"Of course," the man said with a casual shrug. "Go change and jump in. There are enough people here for everyone to have a partner. The changing rooms are over there." He gave John an encouraging smile and went back inside the office, where he sat down at the desk with a sigh. John could tell right away that the elderly man was in pain. Likely an issue with his hip, probably caused by a fall.
"It must be someone who read the article and thinks it's a lark to play a sick prank on me... Someone who... someone who..." A heavy shudder ran down John's spine, making him shiver and fall silent.
But John had overcome all that now. Nothing was going to make him renounce his love for Sherlock just because it didn't fit into some people's image of the world.
Some of the energy was released through the semen that spurted across the bed, yet more through the animalistic sound that wrenched itself from his throat. He felt as if he were falling, at the same time confident in the fact that John would hold onto him.
John sighed silently to himself. Four months had passed since they'd last seen each other. John had kept his promise and sent Greg a message to make it clear that he wasn't angry any more, but they'd never got as far as a meeting. John tended to reply to Greg's texts in monosyllables as often as possible, so as not to give him any false hopes.
"Right here is totally okay, Sherlock. Get down on your knees," Victor ordered him smugly and watched as Sherlock obeyed the directive after only a brief hesitation. He covered the remaining distance on restless legs and lowered himself to the floor between Victor's feet.
"No? All right, I can plump that up a bit. Shall we say another thirty thousand?" He opened his cheque booklet, uncapped his pen again, and had already started to fill in the required information when John's fist slammed down on the desk. Mycroft paused.
A jolt ran through his emaciated figure as if it had been struck by lightning. Eyes uncoordinated and clouded. Hands burrowing amongst sheets and tubes, seeking something to anchor him. Almost simultaneously a frantic beeping, an alarm going off.
On the one hand, they were happy that the status of omegas in society was being rethought in the wake of their experiences. But at the same time, they often felt misunderstood and exposed, especially when their former way of life was regarded with distaste or even disgust. In addition, they became even more afraid of those alphas who were against such societal changes, rather than less. The fear of venturing out alone on the street and finding themselves in a situation without an ally present was such that they withdrew more and more from public life.
Instead, he sent a 'Happy Christmas' to a number that had been disconnected for months and drank a glass of whisky when the expected error message arrived.
What had begun as a lucrative business for Sebastian had soon turned out to be much more. With increasing frequency, he heard sad stories of oppression, maltreatment, and abuse at the hand of the alphas. Stories that he had his own experiences with, his own alpha being just as cruel and sadistic.
"That's no problem at all. As you can see, my omegas are occasionally quite inattentive themselves. They should have brought something by now... William, would you mind terribly taking a peek to see where my dear Amalia has got to? She'll give you something to drink. You'll find the kitchen by going through that door over there and keeping to the left."
Sarah was wearing a cornflower blue summer dress and sat with her legs crossed when John arrived at the cafe. A cup of coffee and a glass of water stood on the table in front of her. She folded up the newspaper she was reading and set it aside, greeting John with a kiss on the cheek. A hesitant touch that could barely be called one.
"Oh, Sherlock..." the man sighed. He was wearing a hat and overcoat and carried an umbrella in one hand, as if he'd rushed to this room immediately upon setting foot in the house. His eyes passed coldly over John on their way to the omega.
Although they'd already spent so much time in bed together during the heat, this moment felt even more intimate than anything previously. Perhaps precisely because it wasn't a heat. Nonetheless, the moment hadn't arisen out of any true feelings they had for each other; it was only down to the influence of that idiotic experiment. If anything, Sherlock's attempt at playing guinea pig would probably drive an even larger wedge between them. But that had been the purpose of the whole thing, Sherlock thought and sighed in resignation.
Sherlock hummed a confirmation and slipped his hand underneath John's t-shirt, moving it in circles on John's back. It must have been long past midnight by now, but John wasn't sleepy. His right thumb kept caressing Sherlock's waist and his lips brushed over every bit of skin they could reach. John slid down off Sherlock and turned onto his back, pulling Sherlock with him. He pushed Sherlock's shirt off his shoulders and tossed it aside.
When they both finally pushed aside their plates, their stomachs filled and sated, Angelo emerged from the kitchen once more and set two plates of tiramisu on the table and refilled their glasses. Sherlock, who had just finished his story, smiled up at the man, awaiting a comment to verify his tale.
He barely remembered staggering home from Kensington, not regaining conscious control over his actions until he found himself kneeling on his bed, in his flat, in the throes of the first of a series of orgasms. He was clutching his jumper to his nose, inhaling Sherlock's scent. His climax hadn't even completely ebbed before a sense of despair set in, making it hard to breathe. He gasped and curled up on the mattress, hugging the jumper until his cock hardened again and the agony began anew.
Following a cool exchange of greetings and congratulations, Anthea Holmes led John and Sherlock into the generously proportioned living room. If she was in any way surprised by John's presence, she didn't show it. Little Archie sat on the floor, cheerfully tearing discarded wrapping paper into tiny pieces.
. Sherlock's blood and John's saliva combined in his mouth to a chemical cocktail that would seal their bond.
The appointment with the clergyman took longer than John expected. He wanted to find out all about Henry's future godfather, and went on at length about the duties that would fall within John's responsibility.
"I'm sorry I offended you. I was young, naïve, and didn't realise that I could hurt other people with my deductions."
"What makes you think it was murder?" DI Lestrade asked as he examined the reports and photographs of the boy that were scattered across his desk.
Victor nodded and pulled on his leather jacket. He was uncharacteristically quiet. John sighed softly and clapped his hand on Victor's shoulder in a feeble effort to cheer him up.
John frowned for a moment, nonplussed, but forcibly relaxed his expression a moment later and nodded his understanding. Of course their third son had also had an unusual name; it must have made his school years awful.
John felt anger gathering in his gut. He wasn't going to let an omega push him around like this. For his part, Sherlock didn't seem to have noticed the shift in John's mood, as he kept chattering on like a train barrelling obliviously down the track.
"It's fine. Everything's just as it should be, believe me. Neither of us was interested in becoming better acquainted with each other. We simply wanted to ensure our freedom as individuals without being subjected to the laws of nature. It's all fine," Sherlock assured him as he put on his overcoat.
"He was last seen in Venice. We suspect he's moving south. Of course, he may simply be trying to obscure his trail. My people have him under constant surveillance, but I can't guarantee he'll stay there for long... We should move as quickly as possible."
Trembling with worry and anger at Mycroft's non-reaction, Sherlock glared at his brother, not daring to push him and possibly chase him away. After all, Mycroft was the only one who would bring him information. Having to rely on him was... bothersome. A sense of helplessness spread through Sherlock, and he took a shaky breath.
in the long run. And John secretly doubts that they would be able to simply return to the status quo.
"Oh." John gazes after his landlady and chews listlessly on his last piece of apple cake. He washes it down with the remaining tea, then begins to clear away the table and does the washing up. Earlier Sherlock had said they would return the files to the Yard together. John doesn’t understand why he’s suddenly changed his mind. He has a hard time believing Mrs Hudson's version of Sherlock’s caring thoughtfulness. Instead, his assumption that Sherlock is embarrassed about what happened between them is more likely. (We were not even in the same room!)
mistake." Victor pressed his lips together dejectedly and stared down at the coffee table between them, awaiting John's judgment.
Sherlock flinched a little at the touch, but rather than pulling away, he leaned ever so slightly into John's hand.
"My dear guests. My friends!" he began in heavily accented but exacting English. "I am very pleased to see so many of you again today. As you all know, your pleasure with the omegas is included in the price of admittance. So choose the one that appeals to you the most. If you want to share one, or bestow your favour on more than one, you are likewise more than welcome. There is no need for fighting. There is enough for everyone. Have fun, let off your steam. But please, do not attempt to bite my darlings. The protector is made of titanium and is indestructible in any case. All that you will do is damage your precious teeth. Aside than that, you may do whatever your heart desires. But..." And here, the man grinned conspiratorially and winked at the assemblage. "Do not leave any permanent injuries."
!" Sherlock gasped out loud and whirled around to face Mycroft, but his elder brother already seemed to have arrived at the same conclusion. He hastily grabbed his phone and leapt to his feet to follow Sherlock.
Without a second's hesitation, Sherlock pushed his nose into John's neck and inhaled deeply. John's own special scent washed over his senses, settling like a soothing balsam over his overwrought nerves.
Sebastian lifted his shoulders again and looked off to the side, as if he had to think about the question before answering it. When he looked at Sherlock again, however, he looked anything but uncertain. "It's easy enough to find drugs that can manipulate omega biology these days."
Sherlock wiped his greasy fingers off on a paper serviette and turned to face John. "I think it's important for Harry to get into a treatment programme. But that won't be easy as long as she doesn't think she needs help. I'm afraid she's not at that point yet. As for your parents... Maybe your mother can work a couple of hours a week until your father's fit again. And maybe you can help find a good doctor who can actually help him."
Sherlock dragged himself up, then sank back down onto John's lap. Again and again and again, until he felt as if he would fly apart. John moved with him, guiding and supporting him, thrusting up into the hot, wet channel whenever he hit the right stride, and alternately caressing Sherlock's hard nipples and weeping cock.
"So we meet again," Ryan said smoothly, glancing over at Victor as he packed his papers into his briefcase. "To what do I owe the honour?"
Sherlock lowered his arms and rolled his eyes dramatically. "It's no wonder at all that your omega's left you, as dull as – "
John sat beside him wearing only a dressing gown, with Sherlock's calves on his lap and one hand resting on his foot while he held the self-help book for alpha-omega couples in his other hand and skimmed through it. Once in a while, he grunted as if agreeing with the contents, but Sherlock felt too relaxed to ask what passage he was reading.
It wasn't until later that he found out his father's death throes hadn't lasted longer than three days. He had been ill for many years already, growing slowly weaker. There was no cure. It had been his last wish not to die in a hospital, but to spend his final moments surrounded by his family.
The omega let out a loud gasp and circled his hips. After a few moments, he adjusted to John's thrusts and started to ride him with purpose. It only took a few seconds – John wasn't sure whether Sherlock's anus had relaxed at all yet – before the omega's muscles tightened up and he came for a third time. This time, only a few drops of semen dribbled out of the tip of his cock to mix with what was already on John's stomach. The erotic aftershocks in Sherlock's groin barely diminished, however. John could feel every millimetre of the muscle ring stretched almost painfully around his erection, as if the orgasm were never going to end.
That morning, the urge to be close to Sherlock became so strong that John went to lurk by Sherlock's half-open bedroom door to watch the omega sleep for a while. Sherlock caught him right away, however, and inundated him with a barrage of ridiculous – if technically correct – deductions before he could make his escape.
"Naturally," Sherlock fibbed. "It completely obscures an omega's scent. Even during a heat, the pheromones can be minimised to such an extent that they're virtually undetectable. Not even by an alpha who has scented the omega before."
John wants to at least have an idea of the sex toy he's supposed to control and therefore googles the name
John stared at the silent house and kept opening and closing his fists to get the trembling in his body under control. He took a deep breath, feeling at the same time as if he were suffocating.
"All right... fine. I'll still be discussing the plan with Anthea first and make a decision as to who will bring you to Sherlock. Anthea will show you to the library so that you can find something to occupy yourself with rather than damaging any more furniture," Mycroft commented dryly, albeit with a hint of a smile on his lips.
"Marcus," Victor corrected him, smirking. He was apparently enjoying the fact that John was picking up the story again and wanting to know more.
"You're not serious..." Victor said. He managed to grab Sherlock's wrist before he could take flight in panic. Utter confusion was reflected on Sherlock's face, making Victor swallow thickly. The realisation that a complete innocent was hiding underneath the young man's arrogant shell made him feel horribly guilty all of a sudden. It also awakened a sudden interest in him that he hadn't reckoned with.
John squared his shoulders automatically as if to confirm her assumption. "Correct... I started with wrestling, but I've also had a few lessons in tae-kwon-do, karate, a little judo... hm... I've also done a little kickboxing, but I'd like to improve my technique."
Some nights when his whirling mind prevented sleep from coming despite his exhaustion, John snuck out. He would sit down in the sand on the edge of the camp where the sentries rarely patrolled and stare up at the sky. The infinite breadth of the firmament with its countless stars, which he never would have been able to see in such plenitude back in London, filled him with a sense of humility. At the same time, they fed his dark thoughts, the shadows and worries that lurked inside him.
Their hunger for each other barely ebbed. They stroked warm, damp skin, held each other in their arms, and didn't stop kissing until exhaustion won the upper hand. They lay beneath the cover, intimately entwined, enjoying the closeness they'd had to do without for so long.
After one more sip, he set the bottle down and let his gaze wander across the desk. That strange letter still lay there, the one he'd come across with Victor a couple of days ago. The scant lines had been typewritten. Obviously one of the old models with type bars, which was indicated by the irregular margins of the letters. Some of the letters had sharp edges or notches because the typefaces had been scratched after years of use and the marks had transferred onto the paper through the ribbon.
John let go of Sherlock's leg so that Sherlock could put both knees down on the mattress again, and buried his free hand in Sherlock's untamed curls. He forced Sherlock to turn his head to one side so that John could see the omega's profile.
"It's completely different with alphas and omegas," John asserted, fixing Sherlock with an earnest look.
"A few months after you left London. I was exhausted all the time but couldn't figure out why. After going back and forth with myself over it, I went to see Mike Stamford because he's familiar with omega medicine, and asked him for advice. My blood panel came back normal, but he saw the bite mark and asked about it."
When they entered the room on the second floor, John checked once more whether Sherlock really wanted to sleep with him.
"Are you completely mad?! Tiger tried to kill me! He bloody poisoned me. If the police hadn't found me in time and taken care of that bastard, I wouldn't even be standing here, got it? Your fucking
There was a half-filled water glass on the table, along with a white rectangular box. Something was stamped on the lid. Sherlock ran his fingers over the edges of the design and turned the box toward the light.
"Is it? I wasn't sure... You weren't in my room, and I..." Sherlock stopped speaking and moved closer to John's face.
John lay very still; only his hands moved as he continued to caress Sherlock's bare back, tracing the shapes of his bones and muscles.
It was with mixed feelings that his eye fell on Ryan, who was kneeling at the head of the bed, stroking Sherlock's hair and upper body and murmuring soothing words. Victor would have liked nothing better than to chase him out of the room, but his touches actually did seem to have a calming effect on Sherlock. Victor impatiently tried to filter the other man out and concentrate on what he was doing.
John shook his head indulgingly and leafed through several pages of statistics before setting them aside and reaching for the medical reports he still needed to sign.
More than once, he was tempted to toss their entire deal overboard and ring Sherlock. Even though he couldn't be with him and was forbidden from putting his arms around him, from holding and protecting him, John at least wanted to know how he was doing. But he forced himself not to give in to the urge, instead chasing one orgasm after another – without ever achieving any lasting relief.
John gazed wistfully at Sherlock, who had his nose buried in John's pillow and his arms wrapped around it, a placid smile on his face. He then gathered up his clothes from the floor and went into the bathroom to get ready for work.
that John saw and heard him. Perhaps has deliberately provoked the latter event (Of course he has, you idiot! Why else would your phone ring at three a.m.?!). And now Sherlock intends to...
When they are done with dinner, John wishes Sherlock a good night and goes upstairs. The staccato of his heartbeat vibrated in his throat. At the top of the landing, he pushes the door open, anticipating a completely devastated room. He hesitates for a couple of seconds before entering.
"You can't possibly be serious?" he asked once he'd collected himself and wiped his damp eyes. "I should instruct DI Lestrade to only involve you in cases where your imagination can't get the better of you. Or perhaps best he not involve you at all anymore."
"I've found the male omega. Look here." Donovan tilted the laptop toward the open side window and looked up at her boss.
"Look at me," Victor commanded, opening one button after another, slowly and carefully, without looking away for so much as a second. "Put your hands on my shoulders."
John stopped at a stall, and the shopkeeper gave him a friendly smile. The older beta gave him a pensive look, then picked up a tea blend which she held out, prompting him to take it. He accepted the small container and sniffed it, still lost in his own thoughts. The scent of honey and wildflowers hit his nose in a rush. Memories of London, summer rain, and dark curly hair had him closing his eyes for a wistful moment.
John withstood the urge to go over and ruffle Sherlock's unruly curls and headed instead for the kitchen, where he boiled some water for tea. When it was ready, he returned to the living room with his cup and sat in his chair, where he watched Sherlock paging through a file with complete absorption. Now and again, he would rub his lips with his fingers and let out some indefinable sound. If he had noticed John by now, he didn't show any sign of it.
. An oxygen mask. The feel of a needle piercing skin, delivered to his brain in a fraction of a second. First cold, then a seductive warmth slowly working its way through his body, quieting the trembling.
After finishing the last corner of white bread and tossing the packaging material into the bin, a quick peek at the clock told him that he still had enough time before the afternoon consultations began. He withstood the urge to take out his phone and send Sherlock a text. Something like that wouldn't be appreciated.
As it turned out, Mycroft was anything but pleased with the name that Anthea had given to the hospital staff. He had wanted to give the child a Holmesian name – a traditional name – but Anthea had at least taken that liberty and in doing so instigated a silent war that she could only lose in the long run. Mycroft could have easily changed the name, but in a moment of weakness and guilty conscience had signed the affidavit and ended the discussion forever.
His other senses were enhanced too. He could see more, was able to enumerate the various nuances of colour in John's blond hair and recognise the brown speckles in his blue irises, even from a distance. He noticed the curve of John's narrow lips, his five o'clock shadow, the film of moisture on his pink tongue whenever he licked his dry lips. Over and over and
"It's so good to see you!" she cried, depositing a kiss on Victor's cheek. "I was already afraid that you were doing a pub tour on your own and we'd never find you!"
"John—" Sherlock tried again. He picked up the small plastic container and set it on the coffee table, his hand shaking.
needs?" she inquired. Despite the perfectly friendly nature of her tone, the words fanned the flames of a deep-seated anger inside Sherlock.
. He slackened his pace and ran his hand over John's taut, sweat-damp back muscles, observing the way his hole was stretched obscenely around his erection, how his cock kept dipping inside that incredible heat.
"So you think that's how relationships between alphas and omegas work? That there's some requirement they be like that?" Cilia surmised in a gentle voice.
"John..." She let his name roll around on her tongue as if it had a peculiar aftertaste. "Does this mean you and my brother-in-law are now ready to lead a traditional alpha-omega relationship?"
The first several minutes passed in a fog, a flare of heat that left both alpha and omega breathless in its wake, dripping with sweat and insatiable. Their lips were kissed raw, and red tooth and nail marks that they bore like badges decorated their skin. Fingers caught in tangled hair, held fast, squeezed, pushed, drew together, caressed unceasingly, almost desperate. And in between it all words of endearment, praise, and desire.
Sherlock smiled and braced his arms on his thighs, holding his comparatively enormous fingers out to the baby. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Mycroft get up.
"You can smell your breath a mile away, John. What's all this in aid of? Do you want to drink yourself into a coma?" Victor asked archly, setting the bottle down on the desk with more force than necessary. He leaned back against the desk with his arms crossed in order to prevent John from retrieving the alcohol.
John returned his gaze with the same amount of intensity, but refrained from touching him – as if he sensed that Sherlock was still too upset to allow any physical contact.
She shrugged and rubbed at a spot that might have been either chicken curry or Earl Grey until it disappeared. Satisfied with the result, she straightened and turned toward John. As soon as she registered his pinched expression, she grabbed for the handle of her cleaning bucket to maintain her balance.
The man nodded and signalled for John to follow him. He placed one finger across his lips and indicated a brass sign on the wall calling for silence. John had to swallow down a laugh: the entire situation was simply too surreal.
"The last time I was here," Sherlock began without turning around. "Do you remember what we talked about?"
John smirked with one side of his mouth as he scooped the contents of the pan onto the two plates he'd got out before.
She was about to close the door when John stopped her by sticking his foot in the gap. "Please, wait. I know he doesn't want any contact with me, but... could you at least let me know how he's doing?"
"All right..." Sherlock wiped the remaining wetness from his cheeks, contrite, and snuggled back down into John's neck.
"Yes..." Sherlock agreed, tugging at his clothing in order to get his jeans rebuttoned. He took a tissue out of his pocket and handed it to Victor, who accepted it with a word of thanks, so that he could mop up the worst of the mess. When he'd taken care of that, he took his cigarettes out of his jacket, opened the pack, and took one out. After he'd lit it and taken a deep drag, he passed it over to Sherlock and rolled down the window.
With an iron grip, he dragged Sherlock back up to standing by his neck and shoved him backwards into his bedroom. As soon as John felt Sherlock's legs touch the bed, he stopped moving and increased the pressure on his throat a bit more.
"Why didn't you tell me that from the start?!" John demanded, slightly surprised at how calm he sounded even after hearing that news.
"Never mind! I've never wanted children," Sherlock said with a dismissive flick of his hand. At the same time, it hurt that he had never so much as been in the running.
Sherlock barely flinched when the beta took hold of his free hand and guided it to his crotch. Underneath the thick jeans material, Sherlock could feel the firm contour of a burgeoning erection. Wiggins' grin broadened.
Victor pulled away from Sherlock, smiling cryptically. "Hold on," he growled, reaching into the car to open the back door and get onto the back seat. He patted the spot next to him invitingly. "Come on, come here..."
"Well... just let me know if you need anything from me." With these words, John takes his teacup and pulls a book out of the shelf, goes back into the kitchen and sits down at the table. Maybe, he hopes, Sherlock will manage to sleep for a bit.
"No, wait." Cilia grabbed John's arm with surprising strength and ran her hand up it. "Please, go and get her. I'm certain I'll be more at ease if Bill's with me."
Neither he nor John could have known that this bond would take on such dimensions. They'd both entered into it to gain the maximum amount of freedom in this absurd society; freedom which was otherwise constantly being undermined by their biology. They'd wanted to outsmart Mother Nature, and instead had put themselves into checkmate.
"Don't say anything. I don't want to know. Not now. I only want you to understand that it's not all about you. We were both naïve to think we could enter into a bond and not have there be any consequences. That's what makes me so fucking angry. And then you go and think of nothing the whole time except how bloody hard it is for you as an omega. Did you ever stop to think it was also torture for me?
Tears prickled behind John's eyelids again, but he blinked them away, let the air out of his lungs in a short burst, and leaned over to deposit a single kiss on the scar. He rested his ear against Sherlock's chest and listened to the steady beating. To the life that still resided in his body. Sherlock's arms encircled him, stroking his head and back.
John was listening to the dull thudding in his chest. Even if there wasn't any sign of Sherlock in the room anymore, he still would have liked to see it, if only to see how much room Sherlock's spirit had had to develop, or what it was like for him to look out the window. But he didn't want to cause Mrs Holmes any more grief. John's fingers touched the marks on the door frame, tracing the grooves. He laid one hand against the door and sighed.
John swallowed hard and refocused on the woman across from him. His head felt heavy and empty, even though he could clearly see the thoughts and memories etched into his soul. He nodded barely perceptibly, made a sound of agreement as if to say he'd understood what she wanted from him. Before he spoke, he took a deep breath, trying to infuse his reply with as much calm as possible so that his voice wouldn't crack.
After Mycroft had waited several miserably long seconds, he entered another number and stared at the screen as if he would be able to force a response from the person he was trying to contact.
Nonetheless, Ryan Walters, the visiting professor from America, had the undivided attention of every single person present. Abigail, who recognised Sherlock as being her flatmate's lab partner, knew that he actually had no business attending the literature lecture. He wouldn't get any credits for the course, which must mean he was here purely for personal reasons. Of course, it might well be that Sherlock was honestly interested in East Asian poetry, but Abigail had a good eye for men who were mainly interested in members of the same sex.
John, who had just lifted his teacup to his lips, set it back down on the tray and sighed. "Looks that way."
When he heard something gurgling, he opened his eyes and looked down. The usually crystal-clear water was clouded with red and black eddies. The roiling increased until the entire lake was bubbling and steaming.
Sherlock pulled on a pair of the Latex gloves he always carried with him before touching the card. The lower edge of the card was stained with some coffee spots, but otherwise it was in pristine condition. Lord Moran's name and address were on one side, along with his telephone number. When Sherlock flipped the card over, his eyes widened. The following words stood there in a broad, flowing script:
"My coat..." Sherlock murmured, but didn't protest any further. Abigail fetched it and helped him into it.
Sherlock shrugged his shoulders dispassionately. "Yes, we agreed not to have anything more to do with each other after bonding, and I'm the last person who would want to rob you of your freedom. But forming a bond with you only transferred me from one prison to another – and I'm sick and tired of it!" Sherlock tore his arm away with more force than necessary and glared daggers at John.
The smell of printer's ink filled his nose when he curled up on the floor, trying to find something to hold on to, and started to sob.
John licked his lips hungrily as he took in the sight of Sherlock in the gentle light of the afternoon sun. His creamy white skin, contrasting so beautifully with the dark leather of his armchair. His bare legs, dangling on either side of the armrests. His long fingers holding his slim omega cock, jerking it rapidly up and down.
The elder alpha mustered John from head to toe with an expression of disgust on his face, as if he had a particularly ugly insect in front of him. Then he turned away, shaking his head.
"Of course. I'll want to know what you find out," Sherlock said with a nod toward the detained omega. "And whether he's truly capable of such an act..." he added in a lower voice. He said good-bye to Lestrade and walked back up the lane to the spot where he'd left John with the injured beta.
Sherlock looked down at John with a nasty smile. "You can stop lying, John. I know you've had sex with other people, more than once. I had a front-row seat every time: I felt what it was like for you to drag one of those brainless betas back to your quarters. I felt it whenever you were aroused by other omegas and wanted to bond with them."
"Oh fuck... not on top of everything else," John grumbled with exasperation when he recognised his sister's car.
Nonplussed, John widened his eyes but promptly took his jacket off. "All... all right?" His confusion was unmistakable, but he complied and started unbuttoning his shirt.
He would have needed another hand to stimulate his own cock. Instead, he had to make do with frotting against the mattress like an animal. It provided just enough friction to crank his arousal up to eleven, yet not quite enough to come.
His own erection slowly began to fade as he attempted to convince his body to give in with cautious up and down motions. His eye was caught by the spark vial standing on the edge of the nightstand, as if inviting him to use it. He'd wanted to save it for when John came home, but it might make more sense to get past this most difficult part with chemical assistance, and hope that he would be relaxed enough when the time came to accommodate John's knot. He really didn't want to take two doses; after all, he didn't even know how he would react to the first one.
When a tentative knock sounded, Sherlock's head darted up in relief. But it wasn't John standing in the doorway: it was Mrs Hudson. The elderly lady peeked in through the gap of the partially open door. Her eyebrows were drawn together with worry, and she took in the scene before her warily. She held a slim book in one hand.
"I assume he's gone to work," Sherlock stated, clearing his throat lightly. There was no reason to worry his landlady just because his alpha might have finally buggered off once and for all.
John squared his shoulders and approached the omega, who was still standing in the middle of the room looking at the floor, making no move toward him.
When Sherlock looked up and stretched his neck, Victor met him halfway. Their lips touched gently. Sherlock searched Victor's face, his eyebrows drawn together.
The tastefully furnished guest room was larger than John had expected. Midnight-blue wallpaper with black designs graced the wall. A narrow Chesterfield sofa in leather of the same colour stood in front of a small wood-burning stove in which a cosy fire was burning. The main attraction, however, was the antique canopy bed that stood proudly at the head of the room.
Thereafter, the mood had cooled by the minute, until John thought he heard ice crunch in her every word. At first, John didn’t dare open his mouth again, but soon, he completely lost interest in even trying. Of course, that was another thorn in Sarah’s side and they had one hell of a fight, which eventually ended with John changing the booking of his flight for an exorbitant sum and returning to London four days early.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and crossed his arms. "You're really not the brightest, are you? Rape, sexual assault, unwanted bonds – that all happens all the time and the military's always covered it up. The actual reason is the risk which alphas might be exposed to.
Of course John understood that this situation was new for her, and might even be scary, but he hoped she would find pleasure in the act and not see it simply as a cumbersome performance of some duty. He would at least try his best to make the experience as beautiful and pleasurable as possible. Even though he was nervous himself and the whole thing didn't quite sit right with him, he was an alpha and needed to exude a sense of strength.
"Yes... it's the only thing I can bear to have on my skin during a heat," Sherlock replied as he admired John's naked body. His tongue darted out to moisten his lower lip, just before he caught John's gaze wandering over Sherlock's body in the same manner. Their eyes met a moment later, and Sherlock turned away, his face flushing.
"I'm expecting a visit from our neighbour. She has a five-year-old daughter and I wanted to give the book to her. Fairy tales are such an enrichment for children, don't you think?" Mrs Holmes asked with a smile and took a sip of her tea.
"There!" John cried, pointing to a row of black skips standing next to a metal gate. The man from the window was just pulling himself up onto the lid of one of them, preparing to climb over the wall. He looked back over his shoulder with panic in his eyes, slithered over the edge, and dropped down on the other side.
Lestrade leapt to his feet and offered Mycroft his chair, simultaneously signalling to Donovan to bring in another one. "Detective Inspector Lestrade," he introduced himself, uncertain whether he should hold out his hand for the other alpha to shake or not.
The thought flashed into Sherlock's mind like a lightning bolt as soon as he caught a whiff of the man's scent, infused with stress and fear.
"I'd go slow... dip into you slowly, giving you all my attention... enjoying every centimetre... the shaking of your limbs... your inability to get away from me... your sweet moans and whimpers... I'd take my time, lots of time... as much as I want... keep thrusting into you, over and over... deep and slow, until you fall apart... until you submit to me completely... beg me...
His fingers trembling, John traced his way across Sherlock's warm, moist skin until he could grasp his slender omega cock. White hot and stiff as a rod, it jutted out at a ninety-degree angle between Sherlock's thighs. Moisture had already gathered at the crown and spilled down the shaft before seeping into his pubic hair.
"What in the world – !" Mycroft struggled to rein in his anger and maintain his composure. He took two or three deep breaths and looked up at the ceiling before shaking his head wearily. "I should contact John right now and ensure that he comes to stop you from killing yourself."
"I told Mike I was looking for an alpha yesterday, and today he traipses into the lab with one in tow. That can't possibly be a coincidence. Or as my brother says, the universe is rarely so lazy."
John took a deep breath, swallowed past the tightness in his throat, and dropped the button into the bin next to the desk.
"That's terrible!" Only the immediate proximity and scent of his omega were able to keep the anger fomenting in John's stomach under control. "I don't understand how anyone can treat someone they love that way."
With an uneasy feeling, Sherlock started the video again, staring at the screen, in which his elder brother's reflection was visible.
But they hadn't been together back then. Sherlock had been the one who suffered the most from their soul bond because he'd felt it every time John was with someone else. How could John resent the fact now that Sherlock had moved heaven and hell to escape the torture?
"Notting Hill..." he murmured absently as he opened the car door, then gave John a mischievous grin. A spark of adventure twinkled in his eye. "Interested in a little outing?"
Anxiety but also excitement coupled with a kind of electrical tension lay in the air. He could practically hear the omega weaving a spell over his alpha with gentle words; feel the way they stroked John's arm. Goose pimples marched across Sherlock's body, triggered by the phantom touch.
Their eyes met. And held. Held fast to each other in mutual turmoil as time seemed to move slower and slower. Everything around them becoming background static.
"Have you now?" Sherlock cocked one eyebrow and looked at John with an expression of mild interest. But the omega couldn't fool John. The tension emanating from Sherlock fairly made the air around him vibrate.
He spent a lot of time with her on the wards as a matter of course. But even outside his on-call hours, John found himself enjoying the nurse's company more and more. He liked the way she kept trying to tuck her blonde hair behind her ears, as if she weren't used to having such a short haircut. He liked the little creases that formed at the corners of her eyes when she indulged in a belly laugh, and the way she looked at him when she thought no one was watching. And he also liked the fledgling butterflies in his stomach whenever he was around her or even entertained thoughts of her – which was starting to happen more frequently.
The equality that was supposed to exist according to the law was nothing more than a myth. As soon as an omega hit puberty – if not sooner – he or she would be sent to a segregated school. The same thing happened to alphas, to be fair, but their schools were intended to prepare them for higher education and well-paying jobs, while omegas were encouraged from the beginning to settle for the fine arts or an education which would prepare them at best for working as an assistant in the lowest ranks of the hierarchy.
John glanced at the report and reluctantly shook his head. "Of course it depends on the size and weight of the individual, but... no, I don't think so. However, that amount would definitely have knocked them out within half a minute at most."
John still couldn't comprehend it. He couldn't believe that the information had been kept from him. That Sherlock hadn't attempted to make contact with him.
"Oh really?" John asked, his voice barely more than a low whisper. "You've done a bang-up job of avoiding it all day. Why now in particular?"
A short while later, Sherlock was writhing on the sheet. Three dripping wet fingers glided effortlessly through his sphincter, brushing his prostate almost as an afterthought. He didn't care to stimulate the sensitive nerve bundle too much at the moment; after all, the point of the exercise was to stretch his muscles.
A hefty clap on his shoulder almost knocked John off-balance. Victor gave him a sidelong grin and motioned with his head toward the house. Mr and Mrs Holmes's two-storey home was painted coral red, while the window and door-frames had been kept a simple white. The natural wood of the front door created a pleasant contrast along with the dark green of the many plants in the front garden.
Trying to find the familiar blond mane was like looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack. When he finally found Victor – barely three steps away – John hardly dared to blink. Without letting the figure out of his sight, he exhaled forcefully through his nose, pushing the feeling of trepidation out through his lungs, and grabbed hold.
Cilia looked enchanting in her floor-length silken nightdress, her hair hanging loose in soft curls tumbling down her back. On the other hand, her getup made her look so much like a maiden dressed for a ritual sacrifice that John was torn between laughing and making a break for it. In the end, he just hoped that the omega didn't see herself in that role, because he hated the thought that she might feel she was being forced into anything.
There was no response. Sherlock swallowed down the panic that rose in increasing waves inside him, forcing tears into his eyes and cutting off the air he needed to breathe.
Sherlock swallowed down the anger that crept up his throat, already burning on his tongue. A biting comment would only ensure that he was left alone, at worst, and not be able to find out anything about his current situation.
John shook his head, impulsively taking Sherlock's hands in his and giving them an encouraging squeeze. To John's surprise, Sherlock didn't pull away, just watched him expectantly.
Sherlock came. His body surrendered, his nerves quivering against the onslaught. Pure ecstasy washed over him, sweeping his body clean for the span of several fleeting seconds. He felt his cock twitching against his abdomen and the wet bloom of his ejaculation. A whimper escaped his throat.
Cilia was sitting on the bed again, her hands folded in her lap and her toes digging into the fluffy throw rug on the floor. She jumped up when the two alphas entered the room, and flung herself at Bill. She enfolded herself in Bill's arms and buried her nose in the crook of Bill's neck.
"I quote: 'You're mine, Sherlock, you belong to me. I'll rip your heart out of your chest and replace it with mine. We belong together, Sherlock. So many years... so many years... you're going to burn, and you're going to love it'," Mycroft read off in a calm voice from a piece of paper which he returned to his breast pocket when he was finished. He looked down at Sherlock where he was sitting, apparently waiting for a reaction, but Sherlock simply had no idea how to respond to those words.
A short while later, another form of pain lanced John's heart when he saw tears welling up in a pair of cornflower blue eyes.
Sherlock reached over and placed one hand over John's and held it tight. "I love you, John, and after everything we've been through, I can't imagine anything about that would ever change. But..." Tears pricked beneath his lids and heat spread under his collar and scarf. "There's no guarantee that will always be the case... is there?"
"Maybe something came up," John murmured absently. "Delayed landing, problems with his luggage... maybe he even missed his flight."
Hardly a blink of an eye passed before all hell broke loose – or at least that's how it seemed to Sherlock.
Victor was only familiar with many of Abigail's classmates by sight, so there were quite a few new people he had to meet. He welcomed the distraction. He wasn't comfortable with the uncertainty and wallowing over Sherlock. Thinking so much about a guy, wondering whether there were something more between them... those weren't the kinds of thing he had control over.
Curious, John looked around at the surroundings. There were no more than a handful of vehicles standing on the gravel lot: two other military vehicles – one German and one American – along with a few civilian cars. The closest other buildings were several hundred metres away. John spotted two security cameras perched above the six-foot gate. One seemed to be positioned to film the parking area, the other was pointing at the entrance. The building stood illuminated by the low evening sun, displaying no indication of what was inside. The back of John's neck started to prickle ominously when his group stopped in front of the gate.
It was awful that people like his father and Phil continued to uphold and fan the flames of that fear. That they questioned other people's identities despite it being absolutely none of their business.
The old man nodded mutely. As soon as his wife had left the room, he leaned forward and took a biscuit, shoved the entire thing into his mouth, and chewed it happily. "She's so scatter-brained, my wife is, but she also happens to be a genius. I can never hold my own with her. I'm rather simple-minded, myself. But she's also... incredibly hot," he said, giving the two men a meaningful look.
The previous day, Sherlock had taken his temperature and found it to be slightly elevated. He didn't feel sick, though; on the contrary. Excess energy surged through his muscles, making them twitch nervously. He wanted to do something, wanted to tidy and cook and
"What are you talking about?" Sherlock asked irritably. He pushed himself up on his elbows and turned his head far enough to give John a venomous glare.
The three surviving omegas had been examined, had their medical needs attended to, and then brought to the Yard for questioning regarding what had happened at the club, and perhaps even find out a name, as the other one without an ID was the deceased. Lestrade didn't know yet whether she had died of an overdose or been the victim of an act of violence.
"Ah…" There was so much contempt packed into the one small syllable that Sherlock wouldn't have been surprised if his brother had whirled around and leapt at his throat. Instead, Mycroft merely cleared his throat, squared his shoulders, and stared at a spot on the wall underneath the bison skull.
John slowly straightened up and wiped his mouth. Now that his stomach was empty, he felt surprisingly good. In fact, better than good. He felt downright euphoric; almost high.
Sherlock passed John the autopsy reports for the two omegas. Rather than waiting for the doctor's reaction, he went into his room and fetched a folder out of his dresser, which he brought back and set on the table as well. He looked expectantly at John.
He wanted to run off; to push John away and jump out of bed; to curl up in a corner somewhere and make himself small. His anxiety over all of these feelings welling up inside him was starting to scare him more than the emotions themselves. Rather than giving in to his initial impulse and fighting his way to freedom despite their connection, he nestled his head in closer against the crook of John's neck, wrapped both arms around his neck, and dug his fingers into the hot, sweaty skin there.
John moved threateningly toward Sherlock, who reflexively retreated until his knees hit the arm rests on the couch.
With one hand, Sherlock reaches for John's head, but he stops himself immediately, startled again. "I… I'm sorry," he whispers between heavy breaths.
"I hope I haven't forgot anything," Molly said, pushing the front door to 221B shut with her foot; in one hand she held a bag and the other was balancing a box.
"And you need to understand that your incompetence is an insult to your profession, Dr Wat– Whittaker!" Sherlock snatched up the paper with a fierce scowl and stuffed it haphazardly into his trouser pocket before leaving the clinic.
"Of course we'll be needing two!" Sherlock had cried before tearing John's duffle bag out of his hand and carrying it upstairs. The space hadn't been used in a while, so it was dusty and crammed with all sorts of junk there wasn't room for downstairs – but that wasn't Sherlock's problem.
He drank a few sips of the amber-coloured liquid directly from the bottle, then set it down on the coffee table and dug his phone out of his pocket. He rolled drowsily onto his side, pulled his legs up onto the seat, and scrolled through the menu. The last few messages Sherlock had sent him were still in his inbox.
What the hell was that supposed to mean? John couldn't match the rhyme to any fairy tale either. But here at least there appeared to be an obvious mention of Mycroft. Or some Mike. Was there a connection between 'W' and Mycroft? What was Sherlock warning them about ? What had Mycroft done? If only there were a date on the letters...
Sherlock didn't know what irritated him more: the fact that John was speaking about him in the third person as if he weren't there, or the implication that he only needed a little practise to be a good cook – a role that Sherlock had absolutely no intention of taking on. He was just about to launch into a biting retort and suggest that John hire someone if he didn't want to cook himself, when a toddler's voice rang out in the hallway.
Sherlock responded to the offensive with just as much enthusiasm, if not more, and kept whispering, "John," between their lips as they met, dipping his tongue into John's mouth and nipping at his winter-chilled lips.
It took a prompting motion from Victor's head before Sherlock finally moved. His hands on Victor's thighs, his face pressed against his crotch, he looked up at Victor.
"Insecure!" John scoffed with a chuckle. "Sherlock may be a lot of things, but insecurity is definitely not an attribute I'd ascribe to him."
Mary gave John a pointed look, and John sighed quietly. He picked up the folder and pointed at the picture of the letter that was addressed to him instead of Sherlock. It was hard to believe it had only arrived that morning. It seemed like forever since then.
Sherlock was right. He was nothing more than a poor excuse for an alpha. No omega in the world would want someone like him. Especially not such a proud, independent person as Sherlock. Who was he kidding?
There was so much more he wanted to say. Such as that he also felt better when Sherlock was near. That he was constantly thinking of his omega. That it had always been like that. Ever since they'd bonded.
"Doctor, please. And I believe you already know William here?" John's fake smile intensified. It became obvious now that it was bitter, a mere facade.
Sherlock made a sound of agreement and rolled reluctantly out of bed. He would have liked to spend more time in the warm bed, but the chances were fairly high that they would be back soon enough. Making certain that John's eyes were glued to him, Sherlock walked around the bed, nude and without a lick of self-consciousness, and went to the door that led into the ensuite bathroom.
The air in the glass coffin was already hot and stale. The heavy aroma of the white roses did its part to further cloud his mind. Sweat ran down his face, catching on his eyelashes and dripping off his chin. The rational voice in the back of his mind tried to calm him down and remind him that an increase in muscle tension would only use up oxygen faster and rapidly reduce his chances of survival.
"You may show him you're fine with sharing a bed with him, but do you also make him feel that his nature is desirable to you?"
"Wait here," Sherlock said, after getting up and walking around the coffee table. He went into his room and opened the bottom drawer in his dresser, where he rummaged around amongst the papers and folders he kept there until he'd found what he was looking for. He returned to the living room and resumed his seat. At the same time, he set down between them the bundle of letters which Anthea had bound together with a violet ribbon and given to him many months earlier.
His half-hearted excuse that they weren't that kind of couple was dismissed by the omega with a flick of her wrist and an affronted huff that reminded him a little of Mrs Hudson. According to Cilia, everyone enjoyed getting presents, and in the end John understood what she meant.
He watched with keen interest as his omega extracted a cream-coloured, padded envelope from the wad of invoices, circulars, and newspapers and eyed it suspiciously. Eventually, Sherlock let out an impatient huff and flipped the missive around so that John could take a look as well. The document was addressed to the two of them in an elegant hand, although there was one small detail that immediately caught both of their attention.
"Are you trying to set me up with him? Did he resent your little prank so much that you're trying to make up for your mistake now?" Walters asked, clearly annoyed, as he searched Victor's blue eyes for an answer.
Mycroft sighed as he leaned back in his chair, although he appeared anything but relaxed. The rigid line of his shoulders, the deep crease between his eyebrows, and his twisted mouth became even more prominent when his eye landed on the letter on the table. His overall posture telegraphed what a catastrophic event this must be.
Shorty, a dark-skinned, two-metre-tall hulk, had picked up a petite omega, who seemed downright puny in comparison. His enormous cock protruded from his trousers. The erection, as big around as an adult's lower arm, appeared grotesque next to the dainty girl. John turned away in shame when Shorty yanked the omega onto his lap and rammed mercilessly into her. Her scream of pain made John's blood run cold.
John watched with a sense of melancholy as the man walked briskly away. John hadn't been in Afghanistan long before meeting Eric. They'd hit it off straightaway, and the good-humoured soldier had eased John's adjustment to life on the front. There weren't any deep, meaningful emotions involved, but they joked, teased and tormented each other until camaraderie turned into flirting. The friendly needling, winks and unintentional-on purpose touches probably would have gone on forever in the same way if Eric hadn't found out three days ago that he'd be transferred today to continue his tour at another base five hundred kilometres further west.
When John and Cilia finally stepped out of the sacristy what felt like hours later, the omega gave him a gentle bump in the ribs with her elbow.
"Yeah, the fridge is empty and I still owe Mrs Hudson for yesterday's breakfast. It's warm out, the sun's shining... Come on, it won't take long." The volume tapered off for the last few words, as John moved away from the door, apparently putting on his shoes.
John regularly cursed his primary* gender. If only he hadn't been born an alpha. Betas had it so much easier. They were free of all the social and biological burdens and conventions, could do whatever their heart desired.
In a futile attempt to warn John, Sherlock tugs at his blond hair and presses his other hand against John's shoulder. But John just ignores it, pushing Sherlock's arm aside and clasping his wrist. A jolt goes through Sherlock as he throws his head back and arches his back.
Yet wasn't that precisely what he had attempted to do? Hadn't he wanted to silence that part of John that seemed to be dogging his every waking moment, in order to finally have some peace?
Shaking his head indulgently, John followed him into the next room. Not too long ago, Sherlock's diva attitude would have infuriated him. But now, he found it downright endearing – at least sometimes. With a smirk on his face, he poked and prodded at Sherlock until he could sit down on the couch with his omega's head resting in his lap. He began to comb through Sherlock's hair with both hands until the tension drained from his body.
"You're… so much more than I ever… allowed myself to hope for," Sherlock managed to get out as he angrily dashed away the first salty streaks from his face. "And I was so… frustrated… because I sent you away, and – "
Jean-Baptiste stood in the front hall with his arms crossed, his hips leaning against a dresser, and shot his visitors a disgruntled look.
He clapped his hands once, made a half bow, and withdrew in the direction of the bar. As one, every alpha in the room stood up. The beta group were the only ones who remained seated, following the spectacle with open fascination.
"Are you all right?" John asked, having focused his attention back on Sherlock the moment Mycroft left the room.
It was like being sucker punched. Was John not even alpha enough for Sherlock to satisfy him during a heat?
"Hmm..." Victor said slowly. "You've caught me. It wasn't really my number. I wanted to get Sherlock's goat. You know, the freshman auditor sitting in on your class."
The dark curls rustled as he shook his head, and John needed to suppress the urge to bury his fingers in them and card through. Or maybe that's exactly what he should do? His omega was clearly under stress, and it would definitely calm him down if he... But before John could turn the thought into action, Sherlock flopped onto his back and blinked up at John.
Mycroft nodded indulgently. "He's at the end of the hall, the room on the right. Oh, and Sherlock..." Sherlock paused, the door handle in his hand, and turned to face his brother. "It's nice to have you back."
John's fist landed hard against Victor's jaw. Dazed, he bumped into the desk with his hip but was able to maintain his balance against it. He was just barely able to evade the second blow by twisting away, but John followed up with another immediately. A fraction of a second later, Victor lay on the floor with John looming over him.
What would Anthea need? Did she have something already packed for an upcoming hospital stay, or had she planned to have the baby here?
John ran out of the room in a panic. He raced down the hall and the stairs, almost stumbling when he took the last three steps in one bound. His left knee protested with a crunch when he increased his pace, teetering to catch his balance. As he ran through the entryway, he scanned it for some kind of defensive weapon, grabbed a glass vase off a side table, and rushed into the study.
Mrs Hudson, the elderly lady who lived on the ground floor and rented out the first-floor flat to Sherlock, had pointed out that there was a second bedroom upstairs that John could use, if they should need two bedrooms.
John paused what he was doing and looked in Sherlock's direction. "Er... yeah..." he said slowly, as if he were only now realising what was going on. He sheepishly scratched behind his left ear. "I'll go have a shower."
He reached down for his duffle bag, tossed in the few items of his which lay around, and finally went back to Sarah, who was now sitting on the couch. He crouched down in front of her and clasped her hands, which were folded in her lap.
Sherlock started at the sudden proximity and let his eyes dart from Victor's eyes to his mouth and back again. He noted the small scar on Victor's chin, hidden underneath his five o'clock shadow. A silver crescent. It might have come from a fall or a fight. Sherlock fixated on it so as not to blatantly stare at Victor's half-parted lips, which were coming closer and closer. He smelled Victor's own personal scent, which reminded him of cotton and sunshine – and was anything but unpleasant. He'd already begun to feel the heat of Victor's body before they'd touched. Now the temperature seemed to be increasing with every millimetre.
"Precisely!" Sherlock stopped in front of the desk and put his hands on his hips triumphantly, but Lestrade still had no idea what the hell he was talking about.
Frowning, John entered the weakly illuminated room. He wasn't surprised to find Mycroft sitting in his usual three-piece suit behind his desk, his posture impeccable, no trace of fatigue on his face despite the fact that the sun wouldn't be up for another couple of hours.
"I'm giving you two more hours, Sherlock. Then you're finished for the day and you're going out with me," Victor declared solemnly and handed Sherlock the cup of coffee.
"I need to taste you... pull back on your knees," John growled. When Sherlock complied, John bent over and spread his arse cheeks. At the sight of his moist hole, John's mouth started watering and he had to swallow thickly.
"Uh... no, not necessary. He... uh... just needs to rest and a bag of ice," John says,  finishing with a little cough, but he doesn’t even consider shutting down the intensity of the app. Looking out of the window, he realises that they are no more than three minutes away from Baker Street. He pulls a few notes from his wallet, which he hands over to the driver as soon as the cab stops. Somehow, he manages to manoeuvre Sherlock out of the cab and to steer the trembling figure across the pavement. He unlocks the black lacquered door, directing Sherlock inside and upstairs.
"No, drop it. I don't want to talk about it." Harry parked the car with a jerk in the narrow driveway of their parents' house, and reared on John with a furious expression. "Actually, I don't want to talk to you at all. Especially not with your little omega hanging around."
Bill nodded and quickly stood up to fetch John a cup of water. She held the straw to his lips to make it easier for him to drink, supporting his head with her other hand.
"Hey, hey. Sherlock, please look at me." John tenderly crooked his finger under Sherlock's chin and lifted it up. "Of course it doesn't have to hurt. It just needs thorough preparation. An alpha penis is... well... big. But that's what foreplay is for, and lube – lots of it! As well as a lot of time and patience. Why are you even asking?"
John pressed his lips firmly together in order not to burst out laughing. Greg's spaced-out expression was simply too delicious. He was about to give Victor a fond pat on the shoulder or brush a wisp of hair out of his face, just to see Greg's reaction, but decided against it.
"A threat?" Sherlock drew his brows together fiercely and gave the woman opposite him a suspicious look.
John held the door open so Victor could walk out with his bag. Together, they went to the aforementioned desk, where an orderly had already assembled the needed documents, which he handed to Victor. Victor thanked him briefly and stuffed them in his bag.
John sighed and tightened his grip on Sherlock, running his hand over his narrow hips and the slope of his arse. The adrenaline from the day was still rushing through his veins, making his head buzz and his body hum as he reacted to all of the stimuli. He grasped a handful of curls in one hand and tilted Sherlock's head slightly so that he could deepen the kiss.
Mary looked up at Nigel with a smile, then addressed the group. "Yeah, all right. Well... I was born in London, but I only moved back here recently after working for three years in Cape Town. I'm still amazed how much has changed in the time I was gone. I've been doing taekwondo for seven or eight years, and I wanted to get back into training again as soon as possible in order not to fall out of practise. So... if there's anything else you want to know about me, just ask."
There was dead silence in the room. Walters' eyes flicked nervously back and forth between the two students before he chuckled briefly.
Images of John in an erotic embrace with a faceless omega flooded Sherlock's mind. Feeling angry and betrayed, Sherlock tossed and turned in his bed, barely able to get enough air into his lungs. His muscles were so tight he could already anticipate the soreness that would come later. He flung himself petulantly onto his other side and tried to block out the images.
"Ahh, there he is. Did you lose track of time gossiping?" Lord Moran inquired, apparently without so much as the slightest suspicion what his omegas might have revealed to Sherlock.
The empty teacup clattered when John slammed his hand down angrily on the desk. It took a concerted effort for him to push down the burgeoning fury inside him. As had been the case so often recently. Incomprehension, rage, grief, despair.... that's all he was left with. His gaze wandered disconsolately through the living room where he and Sherlock had spent so much time together.
Sherlock sighed loudly, giving free rein to his irritation and frustration. That was unusual. Victor normally knew him to be much more reticent. He had to grin. Apparently Sherlock's style of dress was a form of rebellion against his family.
"After seeing that article, I didn't expect we'd meet tonight, John. Maybe I still had hope, but..." She shrugged. "I'm a realist." Whatever that meant. "I just wanted to see you at least. See if there were anything I could do to help. This must have been a horrible day for you."
In order to prevent any new conflicts, all other alphas had been forced to vacate the entire open-place office space until the Lord had been brought into the assigned interrogation chamber. Besides the five betas, Donovan included, Sherlock was the only other person present. He kept himself off to the side, although he knew that Moran and his lawyer would notice him immediately; if nothing else, his omega scent was especially prominent inside the Yard.
"Thanks." Footsteps rang out in the hall outside Sherlock's room, but John's lighter steps stopped suddenly. "Which one was Sherlock's room?"
The omega clapped both hands over her mouth and looked at Sherlock in disbelief. It was clear that she regretted having spoken so openly with him. Richard was also in shock, running both hands through his short hair, grabbing on and pulling as he turned away and murmured, "No, no, no," over and over.
Sherlock lifted one eyebrow sceptically and gave John a stern look. "Are you implying it's my fault that you nearly bit my landlady's head off?"
Sherlock's heart was racing, the air burning in his lungs as if he'd just run a marathon, and every fibre of his body was signalling overexertion and exhaustion. Yet at the same time, he felt more complete than he ever had in his life. Complete and unified with his other half.
One hand dug into Sherlock's hip and the other encircled his throat, forcing his head to one side so that John could reach the bite mark. He sucked hard on the scarred skin, biting down – not hard enough to draw blood, but the tooth marks would certainly be visible for the rest of the day. The bite and possessive grip sent adrenaline coursing through Sherlock's veins. He'd imagined several scenarios, but never that John would react this way.
"According to Donovan, Moran won't get anything more than a warning and a fine that will be set by other alphas, who of course will think he's right and judge that his behaviour was appropriate. Appropriate! It's not fair."
Resignedly, John groans and drops his head onto his crossed forearms on the desk. "Sherlock ... you can’t keep cracking my password!"
Fear constricted Sherlock's throat when he looked at the half-used vial on the coffee table. If he paced himself with it and allowed a little of John to seep through, he might be able to make it last for two weeks. That wasn't much time to find a new dealer...
"As well as can be expected given the circumstances, I'd say; no better than I was," John said, and tightened his grip around Sherlock's waist before lifting his eyes to meet Sherlock's penetrating gaze. He realised there was much more to say on the topic of Victor Trevor, but this wasn't the right time, even if he didn't want to keep what had happened between him and Victor secret from Sherlock forever. All of those thoughts must have been written all over John's face, if he was interpreting Sherlock's expression correctly. When had he ever been able to keep anything from Sherlock?
"John…" Sherlock said in a low voice without looking at his alpha. "Wouldn't you… wouldn't you like to… trade me too? For another omega? One who's not so… ungrateful, selfish, and… and arrogant?"
John made an inquisitive sound as Sherlock handed him back the bottle and leaned over for a welcome kiss. John placed one hand on Sherlock's nape and returned the kiss before brushing his nose against his pale neck to breathe in his omega's familiar scent. Sherlock also nuzzled into the crook of John's neck and inhaled deeply.
"Then what makes you think Bill would? Or that she would even have the right to? I'm her partner, her omega, but I'm not chattel."
Sherlock angrily slammed his fist down on the table, making the dishes clatter and the tea in his cup slop over the rim. Just then, John appeared in the doorway, a smudge of toothpaste at the corner of his mouth, and gave his omega a worried look.
"Oh!" Victor paused in surprise. He was holding an envelope between his index finger and his thumb. He examined it, enthralled, before turning it over and showing it to John. It was an unmarked, yellowed envelope whose top edge had been cleanly slit open with a letter opener. A silhouette of a bird in flight was printed in black ink in the top right corner.
Sherlock pushed himself up and drew his knees in so that he could sit. "I need to know what the other omegas' relationships with their alphas were like, and whether they were also mistreated."
Sherlock nibbles at the inside of John's thigh, kisses over the hip joint and pauses for a moment. Breathing heavily, John looks down at him, sees Sherlock peer closely at him. "By the way, I meant it the other way before... when I said that I didn't mind...", he explains quietly and licks tentatively at John's erection. John sighs then gives a breathless chuckle.
"It's also not very fun to be nothing more than a plaything, but that's exactly what we are. And that's what you'll be too once he gets his hands on you. Do you really think he'll give you back just because your old alpha wants him to? Oh no, Augustus will bond with you the first chance he gets, and then you'll belong to him. He's wonderful at first – gentle and affectionate..."
"Hmhm," Cilia said, regarding John with a sympathetic smile. "I'm sorry to have to say this. But for the fact that he doesn't want to be an omega, he seems to be doing an awful lot to restart his cycle."
As soon as the words left Moriarty's mouth, Anthea rotated the cylinder of the revolver and held the muzzle to the back of Mrs Hudson's head. Mrs Hudson flinched fearfully when the metal came into contact with her skin. Tears welled up over the edge of her eyelashes and rolled down her creased cheeks, soaking into the gag.
A small furrow formed above Sherlock's nose as he gazed at the table, deep in thought. Finally, he nodded and disappeared into the bathroom.
"You're right, you couldn't have known. I didn't expect anything like that either; otherwise I certainly wouldn't have agreed to the bond. My main purpose was simply to be accepted as a full-fledged member of society with all of the attendant rights and privileges, and to be allowed to join the army. That's why it seemed like the perfect solution to bond with an omega who didn't want any kind of relationship. But… something changed, Sherlock."
As Sherlock glanced over at John to reach for the article of clothing, he couldn't help but notice the remarkably large bulge at John's groin. The same one he'd felt just a few minutes earlier against his buttocks as he'd been led toward the bed, groggy with pain, in order to –
Sherlock hesitantly placed one hand on John's upper arm, but John shook it off. He hadn't even noticed Sherlock stand up and approach him. He hurriedly distanced himself by moving to the other side of the room. He couldn't stand to be that close to Sherlock right now, couldn't even look at him. He was too afraid of what he might discover in Sherlock's face.
"I thought so," John said, rolling his eyes. There was a reason for all the nightclubs and bars in Soho. "I meant a little more precisely."
Sherlock's heart rate sped up in a rush and adrenaline shot through his body, making him gasp. His brain informed him at an uncharacteristically slow pace that he'd just poisoned John for no reason at all.
He inhaled with a hiss when the needle pierced his thin skin. Did he know that the cocktail was probably too much for his emaciated body?
Sherlock swore silently and ran back to the phone. He tried his brother's number once more, staring tensely at the old-fashioned device as if he could charm it into summoning Mycroft on the other end. After the third ring and another scream from the omega in the next room, he gave up and entered the emergency services number instead.
Creamy white semen erupted in two, then three spurts onto his flat stomach, and there was nothing in the world that could have kept John in his seat. He lowered himself between Sherlock's spread legs and licked the ejaculate off his quivering skin.
John immediately kisses him again and sighs pleasantly against the other man's mouth. Kissing Sherlock is so much better than John ever imagined. At the same time soft and firm, yielding and demanding, curious and teasing. Gently, John tugs at Sherlock until he finally turns towards him completely and pulls himself onto the bed.
John bites down on his lips so hard that he almost makes a pained sound. His body is completely confused. On the one hand something similar to anger simmers in his stomach because his roommate is apparently having sex in his room. (Is anyone else in there with him? For God's sake, please let him not be having
"What are you doing here?!" Abigail asked in a whisper. "Sherlock's not even here today," she added unnecessarily.
fun with me!" Sarcasm. "Not as much as you could have had, but... I can’t force you to... like me." Sherlock spits out the last word as if it tasted particularly bad. It wounds John and his stomach contracts painfully.
Sherlock listened intently as the footsteps receded. He waited until he was certain that the alphas were far enough away before entering the break room and looking around. He didn't find anything out of the ordinary that might give some clue to the odd conversation, aside from the empty coffee cup which had been left on top of the rotating lid of the dustbin rather than being deposited inside. Indulging some instinct, Sherlock stepped closer and saw that a slender calling card had been stuffed inside the plastic cup.
"To answer the door! Mrs Hudson isn't here, which you cannot have failed to notice," Sherlock stated, glaring down at John with a flash of annoyance.
Sherlock pursed his lips and whirled around so fast that his dressing gown billowed up behind him, and stormed back into his bedroom.
John's hand hesitantly settled between Sherlock's shoulder blades, a red-hot weight through the layers of clothing.
Bewildered, Sherlock took a step closer to the couch, his laser-sharp eyes taking in the sparse furnishings. The seat cushion bore an indentation that showed someone must have been sitting there until quite recently, although it was no longer warm. John had probably gone to the loo or stepped out to find something to eat.
"I'd... quite like to know how you met Sherlock," John finally said, his eyes fixed on the plastic bottle filled with ketchup that stood in the middle of the table.
Outside, pedestrians were walking past in thick coats with their collars up and their hands inside warm gloves. Many of them were carrying full bags with logos from well-known shops. The first Christmas presents. There was a pervasive aroma of cinnamon and baking, eggnog and roasted chestnuts. It hadn't snowed yet, but many of the shop display windows had been decorated with spray-on fake snow. Strings of lights and Christmas tree ornaments did the rest. Everything glittered and twinkled like a Christmas market. Christmas songs had become a constant background accompaniment that followed him everywhere.
John would have liked nothing more than to know what it had felt like for Sherlock, and what he thought of their union. Had it also been the most earth-shattering, the rawest sex he'd ever had in his life? Did he think the second round would proceed in a similarly fervent manner? Had John been too rough, or had he stimulated Sherlock in just the right way? And would the next phase of the heat begin soon?
John's eyes widened in surprise. "Renew our bond? That's…" He kissed Sherlock again, this time on the mouth. "Really?"
"I went back and forth with myself on whether to tell anyone about it, but finally decided not to. I did speak with Sherrinford about it, but he maintained it had just been a phase. He said he hadn't intended to kill Redbeard, but when he saw how much damage he had caused, he got the message and developed a guilty conscience. He did stop doing it, but I could never be entirely certain whether he truly regretted what he'd done, or whether the fact that a guilty party had been found held him back; after all, a fresh wave of dead animals would have undoubtedly led to further questions."
Bill breathed in synch with John until he'd calmed down enough not to hyperventilate. Only then did she place John's phone into his trembling hand.
"Bloody hell!" John hastily pulled away from Sherlock, grasped his upper arms, and forced him to turn around so that he could look his omega in the eye. "Why? Why would you do something like that to yourself?"
"Oh, of course, I see... Yes, I know who you mean. Mr Holmes is extremely intelligent. It's nice that he's interested in topics outside of his major," Walters said, trying not to let his discomfort show over his inaccurate reading of the situation. There was a definite note of disappointment in his voice.
Sherlock took out the two sheets of paper which were inside and unfolded them. The letter was handwritten – which shouldn't surprise him, after all there was no reason to assume there were computers and printers readily available in an active warzone. It was the first time he'd seen John's handwriting – angular and a little careless, as was to be expected of a doctor. It wasn't uniform either: some letters were written in two or even three different ways, while others always looked the same. The letter contained several spelling mistakes which John had firmly crossed out and either written over or corrected alongside. All in all, a fairly ordinary letter.
, he would read him the riot act. Hopefully, Sherlock hasn’t emailed Sarah ... Pouring additional oil onto
Sherlock inhaled sharply in surprise when John found a sensitive spot on his lower back and dragged his tongue over it.
"Well then! I'll see you next week, John," Mary said and waved to the two of them before turning around to join the group that was just leaving the gymnasium.
But Victor hadn't deigned to respond. Neither to the first message nor the next two John had sent in succession. One angry and hurt, the other resigned and apologetic. He felt both guilty and used. After all, Victor had given Kitty Riley a very in-depth interview and blurted out all kinds of stories about Sherlock that John hadn't even known.
All the words John had gone to such effort to compose crumbled to dust when Sherlock casually deleted John's number – as if the bond hadn't left any impression on him at all. Nothing in his behaviour indicated that the omega was anywhere close to being as affected by the situation as John.
The combination of adrenaline and sheer lust catapulted John to the edge of orgasm so quickly that he grabbed a handful of Sherlock's curls to steady himself, performed a couple of perfunctory hip thrusts, and bit down on the heel of his right hand to muffle a loud shout as he spurted down Sherlock's willing throat. Beneath him, Sherlock let out a series of jittery whimpers and ejaculated onto John's bare shin as he came.
Sherlock clung to John and buried his face in the crook of his neck. His heart was beating so hard all of a sudden that he thought he was having a panic attack. He felt his throat constrict and tears pricking at his eyelids, but something stopped them from spilling out and providing an outlet for the stress that had built up inside him. Short, gasping breaths burned in his lungs. The cool air seeped in underneath his clothes where John wasn't touching him, intensifying the confusing sense of being adrift.
John put his arms under Sherlock's knees and placed his hands on either side of Sherlock so that he was both supporting himself and holding Sherlock's legs open. His piercing gaze bored right through Sherlock, sending a shiver through his body that he couldn't explain.
"Could you at least ring him and let him know I'm here? I don't have a number for him, unfortunately, but there's a matter of some urgency that I need to discuss with my omega." John hoped that the subtle reference to hierarchical structure would prompt a favourable response from the other omega, but it seemed to have just the opposite effect.
Upon hearing a dark rumble, John looks up. The sky is heavy with thick, grey clouds promising a shower soon. (Fantastic.) John rushes to the nearest store and enters just in time for the first drops to hit the ground. Surprised, he realises that he has landed in an Indian restaurant. One of the waiters looks over at him and asks him to sit down. John nods and orders a chai. The smell of garlic and curry, honey and coconut milk is in the air.
Sherlock twitched his shoulders again. "It's not important now. You're going to be the child's godfather and you're good friends with the parents. It makes sense that I should finally meet them after so long."
During the long, lonely night hours, John attempted to increase the intensity of his orgasms, despite knowing that it would be impossible to reproduce the ones he'd experienced during the heat. Still, he masturbated every night – at least once fast and hard. It was as if the heat had also increased his libido, which had fallen into a slump before. He tried to stimulate himself with porn flicks and memories of old flames, but any images he managed to conjure up always morphed into the form of his omega, writhing and twisting beneath him in ecstasy.
Intrigued, the omega took a step closer to John, thereby reducing the gap between them – whether consciously or not.
Sarah had acknowledged John's announcement with a melancholy smile. Things were still a bit awkward between them. John hoped very much that their relationship would normalise with time.
A leather-clad foot tapped against John's ankle, wandering up to apply gentle pressure to his calf. John tore his eyes away from the window and moved them onto Sherlock, who was watching him with a one-sided smile.
"You're changing jobs?" John asked, surprised. "What happened to your London job? And your flat? When I last visited, things were going so well for you."
Sherlock sat down across from the young man, with nothing but the metal table between them. The chain between Sebastian's handcuffs was threaded through a ring mounted on the tabletop. His hands lay flat on the cool metal surface. His fingernails were red where they had been chewed down to the quick, and several scratches – both old and new, all likely self-inflicted – marred his pale skin. He looked exhausted, almost tormented – which wasn't surprising given the circumstances.
"I'll get us another," Victor said and got up. His hurried departure looked a little bit like running away. John folded his arms and watched as Victor went to the bar and placed his order. While he was waiting, a man approached him and said something, smiling, then gave him a quick hug; apparently an old acquaintance. They exchanged a few words before Victor was handed two bottles, which he brought back with him.
Sherlock's imagination returned to the image of him riding John. The way his cock would stretch and fill him, completely stuffing him. Hard and hot inside. The way it would gleam wetly, anointed with his essence, drilling relentlessly into him, triggering innumerable nerve endings and setting Sherlock on fire. The way the knot would expand at the base, bumping against his hole over and over, spreading it open bit by bit until it overcame the last natural barrier and slipped inside. The way his muscles would swallow up the knot and clamp down with a burst of pleasure when the hard-packed flesh pushed against his prostate and filled in every nook and cranny inside him.
"You mean more to me than my physical urges, or some alpha ideal that's been cooked up by society, Sherlock."
Something still bothered John about the whole thing, however. If Mycroft was right and three of the letters had reached Sherlock in Florida, then Sherrinford must have known where his little brother was at the time. But Mycroft had maintained that he hadn't been aware of Sherlock's whereabouts, and said that Sherlock had kept the letters secret from him as well.
Sherlock opened his mouth to retort, only to close it again and cross his arms defensively over his chest. Why should he give Victor the satisfaction of putting his hurt feelings on display?
Victor grinned and took a sip of his beer when he saw the look of panic reflected on Sherlock's face when Abigail deposit a kiss on his cheek. A simple gesture with his bottle sufficed to let Sherlock know there was something to drink waiting for him in the kitchen. Nodding gratefully, Sherlock separated himself from the hostess and followed Victor.
Sherlock grumbled vaguely and threw himself melodramatically onto the couch. He rolled onto his side so that his nose was all but pressed up against the seat back, drew his legs in, and pulled his dressing gown tightly around his body.
John put his hand over Sherlock's and squeezed it gently, drawing Sherlock's attention. He tried to give him an encouraging smile, but Sherlock didn't seem to be fully present.
Sherlock sighed as he dropped his backpack and leaned back against the broad trunk of the chestnut tree in front of the natural sciences building. He tugged at the zip on his jacket to catch some of the cool autumn breeze. His heart was still racing in his chest. Anger and shame jockeying for first place. Useless emotions, wholly inappropriate in his estimation. It had taken him days to muster the courage needed to take the next step. To allow Ryan Walters a brief glimpse inside him. And now this.
. Until Sherlock came with a shout, virtually absorbing the entirety of John's knot inside him. The contractions of his internal muscles pumped John dry and made him come so hard that he left red fingerprints and scratches on Sherlock's milky-white skin from his unrelenting grip.
"You can tell me anything, son. Is it..." She made a vague gesture toward John's lower body. "Can you not... anymore? Because of your injury?"
"Never thought I'd live to see the day you said that," John said, chuckling. "Put some warm socks on, the flat's quite chilly. I'll turn the heat up – or would you rather a fire in the hearth?"
Another hot flash together with a strong contraction in his groin sent Sherlock into a state of erotic tension. He planted his feet on the mattress and thrust his pelvis upward, only to find neither resistance nor relief. He angrily slammed his hands down on the bed and tried to sit up in the hope that a change in position would help. But just the opposite was true. The increased pressure on his anus made him gasp for breath even as the fingers of his left hand reached under his t-shirt of their own accord to wrap themselves around his engorged nipple and pinch it hard.
After they'd eaten, Anthea took her omnipresent mobile phone out of the inside pocket of her blazer and scanned the screen. She nodded and stood, picked up the tray, and walked toward the door.
With a sneaking suspicion, John looked the omega over more closely and fancied he detected an underlying alertness in his otherwise calm looking expression. In addition, he caught a whiff of the stale scent of doubt and distrust, almost completely obscured by the aromas of countless Italian seasonings swirling around the room. And it seemed to be coming from Sherlock.
Someone screamed out in the hall, trying to scare off his demons. Or the vultures. He jerked, looking around like a deer that had been startled out of the underbrush. His dilated pupils crowded out the dull blue. The frantic throbbing of his carotid artery was clearly visible in his thin neck.
. There was no point in trying to fight his very nature. The alpha had arrived and wanted his omega. Now!
Instead, he tried to act as relaxed as possible. Self-confident. Unshakeable. Peter finally agreed to partner with him. After warming up, they did a few exercises as directed by Shari. They switched off practising kicks and punches with the assistance of punching bags. John got a few tips on his posture and technique, but there was no actual fighting.
"Okay," Sherlock said. They fell silent for a while, each lost in his own thoughts, accompanied by the quiet ticking of the kitchen clock. "Listen, I... erm..." Sherlock's fingers nervously traced a dried-out coffee stain on the table. "The thing with Walters..."
Afterwards, he had a long bath, shaved carefully, and thought about what he should wear that evening. He decided on jeans and a white shirt, intending to complete the outfit with a dark grey blazer and blue tie. Together with the dark-brown leather loafers, he would look both fashionable and casual. For the time being, however, he made do with a t-shirt and a warm jumper in place of the jacket.
"God, I've missed you..." he panted, gazing into the face of his omega, contorted with pleasure. His bottom lip was caught between his teeth, his pupils so wide that barely any of his pale irises was visible. Hot breath wafted across John's face as he hungrily licked his lips.
Sunshine landed on Sherlock's face. The aromas of sweet pastries, vehicle exhaust, and crowds of people washed over him. Alphas, betas, omegas. No one seemed to be clocking him as a potential victim. In fact, no one registered his presence with anything more than a curious look. No one except ... John, who stood beside him waiting patiently for Sherlock to finish processing this initial foray.
Was he trying to drop a hint that he was going to try to woo Sherlock, as an unbonded alpha? Was this seemingly friendly conversation a subliminal threat? An indirect attack on John's territory?
Hoping for a confirmation via eye contact, John glanced up, but the couple was still kissing, oblivious to anything else around them, their tongues wrapped around each other. Bill had pulled down the top of Cilia's clothing so that her breasts were exposed. Her hands were kneading the soft mounds, playing with the rosy buds. Cilia moaned again.
Victor nodded at Mycroft, somewhat nonplussed and unsure what was expected of him. But when he saw the look in Mycroft's eye, he quickly realised what game Sherlock was playing. Mycroft's attention rested on him, cool and stiff, and Victor felt as if he were being virtually dissected.
The doorbell to 221B rang as soon as John stepped out of the bathroom and into the kitchen. It was exactly a quarter past nine in the morning. He listened with one ear as Mrs Hudson came out of her flat and opened the outer door, exchanged a few words with someone, and laughed lightly. Probably the postman, John thought, and poured boiling water into the teapot. He went to the refrigerator, which was clean and well-stocked – a state that John still hadn't got used to – and took out the milk. When he heard the knock on the door, he whirled around.
"I see that you've given the whole thing a great deal of sober thought, John. But is this also something that you want, William?"
The paramedics were just arriving from the other end, rushing to the victim who lay covered with Sherlock's coat. As soon as they took over from John to tend to her wounds, he stood up on wobbly legs. His adrenaline was all used up at this point too, and he shook out his cramped, blood-smeared hands. He turned around and saw Sherlock, a smile of relief brightening his face.
Sherlock sat down next to him and sighed as he wrapped one arm around his hip. "They never asked you for help, did they?"
Unfortunately, Augustus Moran's death claimed one final victim: Anastasia didn't survive either. In her already weakened state, without the support of Seven's effects, her body couldn't handle the rupture of the bond. She died in the hospital, the same night as Augustus and Sebastian.
John swallows hard, takes a deep breath, and finally kneels between Sherlock's propped legs. His heart thunders in his chest as he spreads some of the colourless gel on his erection and smears the rest between Sherlock's buttocks. For a more comfortable angle, he shoves the other pillow under Sherlock's hips, grabs his knees and puts his legs over his shoulders. Pressing a few tender kisses on Sherlock's shin, he grabs his own erection at the base and strokes himself a few times, making his glans touch Sherlock's most intimate body parts. A shiver visibly runs through Sherlock when it touches his cock, testicles and perineum.
It ended up taking them nearly two hours to arrive at their destination, since the road had only been partially ploughed. It was frustrating. John was so full of nervous energy he would have loved nothing more than to get out of the vehicle and run the rest of the way, if it had made any sense to do so.
Sherlock walked down the narrow corridor. There were additional doors, two on either side, which presumably led to other offices. He opened the last one on the right and entered the exclusive waiting room where John had gone to lie down. But John wasn't there.
Sherlock bounced faster, pressing his forehead against John's and eliciting a moan from his alpha's lips. The urgency inside him suddenly kicked up a notch, pushing him harder and faster no matter whether his body was ready for a knot or not.
John reached for the shirt, slipped into it, and buttoned it up. The black material draped coolly across his skin. He couldn't say what the cloth was, but it looked expensive. The sleeves were a little long for John, so he rolled them up.
"I wouldn't know what to say about it anyway. The case is on the back burner for the time being. Moran will continue as he has been, and Sebastian, Anastasia, Amalia, Richard, and the other two will eventually succumb. And who knows how many other om—"
John angrily shut off his phone and slammed it down on the nightstand. Enough was enough. If there was something John didn't need, it was relationship tips from a certain Victor Trevor.
Molly took care setting the box down on the table; a faint sound of glassware came from inside. She then opened the box, lifted out several coloured glass vials, and lined them up. Finally, she took a USB stick out of her trouser pocket and put it on the table next to Sherlock's hand. Her eyes remained locked on Sherlock the whole time, trying unsuccessfully to garner his attention with nothing more than her presence.
"Never mind, let's not let it ruin the mood. Fortunately, the rest of the family's all gone over the holidays so Cilia and I could be alone. Come on, John. I can hardly wait to introduce you to my better half."
"Oh! You're absolutely right," she said and leapt up – insofar as that could be done with her bulging baby bump.
The simple idea of Sherlock writhing naked on his bed, at the mercy of the constant stimulus inside his body, triggers such an intense desire in John that he has to close his eyes and compose himself. When he opens them again, he pushes himself away from the table and goes into the corridor, leans his head against the wall right next to Sherlock's door. He’s very careful not to make a sound. With his thumb, he swipes over the regulator and raises the vibration level.
He should find the notion repellent that he was doing it for John, but instead it gave him a pleasantly warm feeling, coupled with a desire to have John there.
"Moran's plane landed over two hours ago. They must have informed him of the situation by now," Sherlock said, glaring at the phone on his desk with heated impatience.
Sherlock nodded pensively. John had shared a few things with him about his time in Afghanistan, but certainly not everything. Physical scars were something that others could see and take the measure of, but psychological scars were more difficult to categorise. They might stem from experiences the soldier never spoke of, things they couldn't put into words. Demanding that they open up and share their burden was probably selfish and served the interests of the other person more than the one who was suffering.
The screech of his chair rang painfully in John's ears as he pushed it back to stand up. John made haste to stand as well, reaching for Sherlock's arm. "Sherl—" But Sherlock had already turned around, and left the room with his head held high.
"And this is Mary," Nigel announced, dropping his arm over the woman's shoulders and pulling her in with a friendly squeeze. "Tell us something about yourself."
Afterwards, John couldn't explain exactly how it had happened. What he did know was that his anger had gained the upper hand, immersing him and his surroundings in a cloak of red fury. One second, he'd been staring at Sherlock, grinding his teeth, and the next he'd grabbed him by the throat with an enraged growl and pushed him up against the wall. The force of the impact brought Sherlock to his knees from his former superior position, and he now stared up at John, his pupils wide with shock.
Blood shot into his cheeks when an uncontrolled sigh escaped him. He leaned into Victor as if someone had given him a shove. Of their own accord, his hands summoned the courage to touch Victor, to explore him. Fabric and heat and hair. Sherlock's fingers ran around the collar of Victor's t-shirt, balancing on the hem without touching skin, as if on the edge of a cliff. Then the leap. The play of muscles and tendons under his fingertips, here and there the jut of a bone. Sherlock imitated Victor's grip on the back of his neck, burying his fingers in Victor's blond mane of hair.
John gasped for air and strengthened his grip on Sherlock again – this time, however, to anchor himself and not to stop his omega. "Sherlock..."
Sherlock let out a humourless laugh and mustered John with a combination of disbelief and fascination. "You really think the government doesn't allow unbonded alphas in the military in order to protect omegas?"
"It was fantastic. This time, and the first time too. I didn't know if it would be the same every time. Now I do. It's good... very good … but different each time. I simply didn't have anything to compare it with."
"Sure. What could be wrong?" John retorted, lifting the bottle to his mouth. A single drop dribbled out to wet his lips. He frowned, irritated. "Sorry, I think that was your beer. Wait, I'll order you another."
The brief stroll was undertaken in silence for the most part, although the atmosphere wasn't unpleasant. It was more like a relaxed sense of togetherness. Still, John snuck sidelong glances at Sherlock from time to time, looking for signs of any discomfort. Fortunately, his omega didn't appear to be anxious or insecure at all. Just the opposite: he held his head high, his hands pushed deep into the pockets of his greatcoat, and kept up a brisk, confident pace close by John's side as they walked down the street.
Victor snorted derisively and gave his head a slight shake. "I was there. But when I saw how many people were there, I left. What was the point of such a circus? All those rubberneckers and police... was it really necessary?"
Mycroft was still standing at the door next to Lestrade, speaking more animatedly than ever before about some recent political events on the world stage that Sherlock had never heard of, while Anthea was nervously wringing her hands as she observed the two alphas.
Mary wrinkled her brow, looking utterly bewildered when she saw that it was a London number. Nonetheless, she wasted no time entering the digits and held the phone to John's ear when it started to ring.
