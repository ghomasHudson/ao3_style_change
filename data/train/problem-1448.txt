“You missed almost two years of her life.” Rosie. John knows what he’s saying but he drives the point home. “You’ve lost a lot of firsts, and she’s truly – objectively - the best child on the face of the planet.”
“Even in my mind palace, he’s getting further away.”
Sherlock Holmes stays at Baker Street all day, every day, moving through the hours by following instructions as he’s given them. When Mrs. Hudson tells him it’s time to eat, he doesn’t blast holes in the wall. He doesn’t play violin over the sound of her voice until she leaves in a huff. He doesn’t shout, doesn’t ignore her, doesn’t even refuse. Sherlock just eats when he’s told he should. They take all their meals together, in his kitchen. He goes to lay in his bed at 10 PM and gets out of it at 6 AM, whether he slept or not. The dark circles suggest not, but Mycroft’s idea of putting cold medicine in his dinner was vetoed and they can’t force him to sleep.
The detective gets closer to the phone with interest, asking John directly for permission to run off and solve the case. "Can we?"
“I don’t think so. Do you?”
Sherlock stares at nothing in the quiet space, a hand coming up to fuss with his bottom lip before he catches himself, letting the arm fall back to his side. There are experiments on hold, waiting for his return. He ends up turning on his heel instead, flopping down into the leather seat with his standard impetuous flair.
It’s one of their little games. Mycroft takes in the eyes that are damp but not bloodshot, skin flushed but not marked. All his muscles seem to be in working order. No list.
“Join me?”
Greg hears the words anyway, gripping the folder hard and keeping his arm out. “It’s an 11,” he says. Sherlock stares at it. Please. When the weight is gone from Greg’s hand, he takes a deep breath. Shiny black curls shift as Sherlock’s head turns to look through the papers, trembling fingers going still as they press against the photographs. Greg just waits.
The man rolls his eyes at Sherlock’s critique and blatant misnomer, and then a quiet voice is heard.
He follows the call to find Lestrade in his office, stepping through the open door with a lifted chin.
So they go.
After a moment to recover – all he’ll spare - he orders Donovan to keep Sherlock out if the detective appears, even if she has to shoot the man. He calls Mycroft, one shaky hand balling into a fist as he uses the very last bit of his bearing to make sure his voice doesn’t break.
“No, but it’s accurate,” Sherlock says with a smile.
Lestrade pulls the invitation out of his desk, sliding it into a pocket and glancing around to make sure he hasn’t forgotten anything. Donovan pokes her head in the doorway as he circles the desk.
"We've got a call from out of the city, a task force that wants to work in our jurisdiction - with any help we can offer,” she adds.
“My own blood has turned on me,” Harry sighs, accepting the hug from her wife in condolence. Sherlock’s playdates with the toddler usually involve trivial and non-hazardous studying at the park, but anything’s better than being forced to bathe, eat, and sleep normally. Rosie and Sherlock agree on that.
Mycroft hears music again at Baker Street and replays the bug recording, just once.
“It’s poison. Get Molly to check the blood for thallium. Rare, but likely. There’s no murderer but he works somewhere that should be checked for leakage problems during smelting. The other employees need to be evaluated as well,” he says, speaking as he watches John step up to the body and finally look it over. “Barely a two, George.”
Donovan, Anderson, and Greg are all silent, watching them – watching Sherlock – work without a single protest. No one’s making jokes, no one’s whispering about the latest rumor they’ve started about him being a murderer. They’re all watching Sherlock, just waiting and following instructions. He’s gotten used to it, the silence that followed him after John’s supposed death. They walked on eggshells and in their silence realized that listening to Sherlock actually worked, so they began to do it all the time. John doesn’t know that but he’s catching up. Slowly.
"The nerves," John says, getting a little hysterical. "You aren’t antsy, you just want to act clever again. God, it's like you think I'm stupid."
"Of course, of course. Forgive me.” John huffs, the exasperated sound interrupted by a distracted hum from the detective. “It would be fun though. Something to calm the nerves."
“Find Sherlock. Now.”
“Did you say she painted her nails?”
“I know, Sherlock, they told me,” he sighs. “Trying to break me, I suspect.” He stares with the same eyes as always, but it hasn’t been always for a long time, and Sherlock has to turn away from the scrutiny. “Why do you think that’ll scare me away now when I’ve gone through far worse with you?”
“Why’s he looking round like that?”
Molly emails him the bloodwork, telling Greg to call if they need someone to stay with Sherlock at any time. The body is John.
"Shit."
“Baker Street first,” Sherlock says. “I need more than my emergency kit if this is serial.”
“I’d give it two – split the difference,” Greg bets, calling for clean-up of the flat and organizing contact to other employees at the factory.
Sherlock puts the vice back in its hiding spot and goes downstairs to set the tray down on a nearby table, stubbing his used cigarette in the sink. He doesn’t need it right now. Mycroft gives him an exasperated look when he stops by and sees the stolen item on display, and the memory makes Sherlock smile a little.
“That’s right,” Harry exclaims - a little too impressed, in Sherlock’s opinion. Everyone knows that he wears a funny hat. “He came to say hi.”
, she thinks, setting them in a stack by the window, the titled one on top.
“No, but they’re the only people in the world that could manage to keep the truth from us. Do figure out who it was, Mycroft. You shouldn’t be too harsh though, they’re probably higher ranking than you.”
“Sherlock, honestly - it’s been three months. I know you don’t intend to live the rest of your life like this. A Holmes can do better. You can, you’re not a fool.”
“There isn’t one.” Sherlock lingers, then faces away again, playing the note as though Mycroft doesn't know it already.
“Piss off.”
“Eurus would like to see you. She’s been asking since your first absence at our family meetings.” Sherlock doesn’t answer, playing a song that Mycroft remembers hearing before the Watson wedding. “Is that a yes?” No answer again, nor to the next three questions Mycroft asks.
“Ten quid says it takes them a month to figure it out.”
John looks a little amazed, and the detective knows that the expression is a combination of disbelief at Sherlock’s admittance of attachment, and disappointment - likely in himself for his involuntary absence. “I can’t take you from her or her from you because I already have once and I won’t let it happen again. The only way to ensure that is to let everyone assume you’re dead, and you can have a normal life with your sister and your daughter. Therefore, you cannot work with me any longer.”
“Yeah, he’s Sherlock. He wears a funny hat.”
“Hand it over.” The shoulders twitch, weak breaths grinding to a halt. “Sherlock, give me the damn list.”
“John, Harry says this is your last chance to back out. I imagine she thinks it’s funny to say a thing like that.” Greg hears Sherlock’s voice fade into observant curiosity, probably registering the fury on his partner’s face. “Lestrade. Theft or kidnapping?”
He opens his mouth but nothing comes out, closing it again as Mrs. Hudson lays a hand on his back. “Rain’s on the way. Let’s get you home.”
“There isn’t one,” he hears, the thick voice almost laughing. Sherlock sits up enough to look at him, amusement fading as he sees how pale Mycroft has become.
“Yes, obviously. I don’t want you to get shot on today of all days.” John’s disgruntled sounds are muffled by his attempt to juggle the phone and grab his jacket off the stand, following Sherlock to the door. “Maybe Rosie can stall.”
Sherlock’s hand pats the fabric of the seat, looking away once Mycroft has deduced his sobriety. “Most people would get rid of it,” he says, not bothering to clear his throat or his face of tears.
He stays at the grave after it ends, freshly turned dirt telling him something - about the source, the soil quality. Right now, it’s just dirt. He crouches, hands pressing into it as though he intends to dig, but a firm grip on his arm stops the fingers from curling. It’s Mycroft, staring at the top of Sherlock’s head as he doesn’t look up.
Back at Baker Street, Sherlock takes off his coat and moves to the window, turning to lift his violin. He starts to play, no longer needing the sheet music to keep his thoughts on track. If someone asked, Sherlock would say that he feels fine.
Donovan lifts the man from his seat and moves him out the door, prepared to find evidence based on the deductions.
“That’s not objective at all.”
Sherlock enters, curling up in his chair and staring at the empty one across from him. Greg holds out the file, begging with that extended arm for it to be accepted. He wants to do something for Sherlock, for John, and this is all he has to give. Please, just take it. The tab of the folder is labeled - the first and last name of the victim so it stays organized in their cabinets. Sherlock’s eyes see it for just a second but it makes him look up at Greg, not saying that they’ve done this one before.
“I can handle it, I swear. You said he had his what hacked off?” The detective grins, lifting a glass to his lips before he continues the story. Clara returns from daycare with Rosie and she runs straight to Sherlock with a toothy smile.
John is frowning.
“The smell,” Sherlock murmurs, answer on the tip of his tongue when a voice shouts his name from outside the interrogation room, disrupting his thought process. It sounds like Lestrade - and considering that Sherlock wasn’t supposed to actually talk to the prime suspect, he takes the distraction as a sign to leave the room. The usual commotion of the floor ceases to exist as the inspector calls for him again, eyes finding his back and whispers dropping into silence throughout the rows of desks and officers when he passes.
Sherlock moves to sit down in his chair, instrument cradled in his lap. Much to his delight, John does the same, settling in as Sherlock just stares at him, hiding the smile he can feel twitching at the corners of his mouth. The doctor’s head tilts a little and he pats the arm of the chair in an awkward stall. “How are you?”
“Do you know the difference between an A-sharp and a B-flat?”
“Yes. I certainly would, but when has my opinion ever factored into your decision-making process?” He accepts tea as Mrs. Hudson arrives from downstairs and hands him a fresh cup. Both of them are surprised as Mycroft takes the weight off his feet, turning to lean back against the side of the sturdy chair. Sherlock’s voice is quiet and glued together.
“Hello, Detective Insp-”
“Angelo’s, I think,” John says, pushing to his feet. It’s not until their voices are muffled by getting into a cab outside that Donovan speaks, snapping her co-workers from their mutual daze.
Mycroft corrects him. “It’s ‘Am I not’, Sherlock.” The man’s gaze moves away from the wall and the older Holmes almost steps back. He’s confronted by eyes that tell him Sherlock knew it wasn’t grammatically correct - he just didn’t care.
“For God’s sake, I don’t understand why you’ve gone mute. You used to talk even when he was away, I don’t see the trouble now. Just imagine he’s out for milk.” The violin cuts off as Sherlock turns his face, only enough to stare at the accent wall to their right.
“Look again.”
It’s another run through London, chasing people that do their best to escape the famous detective duo. They arrive at Baker’s Street, still laughing from the rush of cornering the suspect and dodging Greg’s debriefing all at once. Sherlock trips over his own feet, catching himself on the top step but deciding to roll over and lie down instead of recover.
“From that, I know that you’re not only aware of the affair but organized the whole charade because her secret lover is
“Piss off.” Sherlock’s eyebrows knit together. “God, you really are an idiot. Glad to see some things haven’t changed.” John stands up, taking the violin from him and setting it back in the case, then pulling Sherlock into a hug. “Just bloody stupid.” There’s not enough time to return the embrace before John steps back, crossing his arms to look immovable. Sherlock just thinks he’s being stubborn. “I missed you as well, you know. Seems like we’re just going to have to look out for each other a bit better.”
Greg assumes he’s talking about bloodwork, the only piece missing from the report. “Two hours. I asked them to rush it.” Mycroft nods, setting the papers aside and standing up.
“You’re not going to believe this.”
“If your heart was cut out, you’d have a hard time forgetting it too.” Anderson shuts up after that, Greg watching their detective circle the body and wishing Sherlock would talk a bit more as well.
He takes his time looking around while he’s down here. The lack of dust along the baseboard tells Sherlock that Ms. Hudson has swept recently. There’s a bit of shoe polish on the edge of the step underneath his head, a sign that Mycroft has done something at work that requires long conversations filled with near-apologies. The door to the kitchen is shut, meaning that some of his things have probably been mysteriously tidied during their excursion. The way John’s looking at him says – no, that can’t be right.
When Greg arrives at 221B, his gut heaves and he swallows it back, heading upstairs. It’s quiet, and he finds Mycroft on the floor with Mrs. Hudson, the latter crying as she cradles the upper half of an unconscious Sherlock. Greg remains standing because he’s not sure he could hold it in if he sits down now. He has a job to do. For John. Scotland Yard’s file is moved to Mycroft’s hand, the older Holmes spending more time than necessary reading it. Greg sees him flip back and forth, clearly trying to comprehend the reality they’ve found themselves in.
Greg follows the body to Bart’s, his mouth twisting with the force he’s using to keep himself together. Molly’s delighted and surprised smile upon seeing him crushes the professionalism Greg has left and she understands all too quickly, eyes watering before the body arrives. The form under the sheet on the table that’s wheeled in is too short to be Sherlock.
“Adrenaline,” Sherlock offers, staring at the baseboard and the steps underneath him and anything but John. “Cardio exercise can introduce endorphins to the system that may make one feel light and impulsive. Probably the root cause of our excessive laughter as well. Completely understandable under the circumstances, a whim that is no fault of your own.” He swallows to stop rambling. “Consider it forgotten.”
“Right. You can just chuck it out of the mind palace.”
When that’s brought back, Sherlock grabs a bag nearby and begins shoving everything into it, leaving Greg startled as it’s pushed into his hands. Then the man moves to his violin, picking it up with a soft exhale and pushing the bridge upright from where it popped loose under the strings. He rests it back in the case, closing the lid and sitting down in his chair. The bag feels heavy in Greg’s hands.
"Sherlock, there is a room full of people waiting for us."
“I’ll check on it,” Greg says, closing the door as the driver makes to pull away. Once both vehicles are gone, the detective inspector makes a call.
“The British government,” Sherlock says, turning to his brother. Mycroft stares back in confused disbelief.
John gets the room’s attention once more while he’s busy staring at the victim’s hands, setting them down before pulling off his gloves. There’s a small smile lifting his cheeks as he looks up at Sherlock. “Mee’s lines – well done.”
Sherlock still doesn’t answer.
“You’ll be in trouble for this.”
secret lover, a woman that you intend to run away with at the first opportunity.” Sherlock leans away, watching the suspect glare in revealed honesty.
“Good,” Sherlock says, watching John fidget some more. “I’ll start.” The movement stops, out of surprise or worry, he doesn’t know. “I fear an apology is not enough in this case, but you should know that I’m sorry. My behavior is the sole reason they abducted you and kept you like a prisoner. They wouldn’t have hurt you if it weren’t for me. Because of this-”
Mycroft leaves.
“Hi,” Rosie says, eyes darting away as she looks around at the toy mess. “If you- Do you want to play with us?” Sherlock nods, watching her walk around, bringing things back to him and waiting for him to respond. He says ‘good’ and ‘yes’, listening attentively as she starts to get used to him again.
Sherlock can hear John coming up the stairs, just as he saw him on the street outside only moments ago. It’s John’s first day home from the hospital and he’s already begun to wander around London. The detective waits, continuing the song on his violin.
“Yeah, not a good time to insult me, Sherlock.”
Sherlock is talking with Greg and Harry about the recent deaths in the neighborhood - Harry encouraging him to continue while Greg is trying to stop him.
There’s a voice through the speaker, distinguishable in the quiet apartment. Greg isn’t entirely surprised.
“A bit,” the detective echoes, incredulous and unconvinced.
“I mentioned that,” John says. “It’s not a good excuse to a five-year-old.”
Mycroft finds his brother at 221B, the violin playing a sonata created by Eurus. As soon as his foot lands on the top step, a cacophonous sound echoes through the flat. If Mycroft is hearing correctly, that was the sound of a violin falling to the floor and crying out in protest, which means that Sherlock has deduced why he’s here. He opens the door, closing the space between them as Sherlock wavers, falling to his knees in Mycroft grasp without registering his presence. When his brother starts to scream, the older Holmes closes his eyes, unable to cover his ears as he keeps his arms in a vise around Sherlock’s upper half.
Finally, the four of them broke the kiss, panting.
“I only was pretending…nnnnnnnng, John, if you keep doing that…”
He nodded, unable to talk.
"Thank you very much, Geena, for everything. We have given you a lot of work".
Mycroft hawked and fit his tie. Molly looked around, trying to guess what was happening.
"Come for me, honey," grumbled John, increasing, even possible, the speed of his thrusts.
"He's not the one we're waiting for," replied Stephen.
"Ready?"
"Okay," he finally said, almost tentatively. His cock throbbed again as a slight chill shook his body, which did not go unnoticed by the smiling detective, who lazily placed his hands behind his neck.
Lestrade raised his eyebrows, not understanding.
In the group, Mycroft, his vest unbuttoned, his tie loosened (one more hour and it would surely have ended tied around his head) was panting and jumping with the music, trying to keep up with the rhythm. Next to him, Molly Hooper and Irene Adler, both dressed in black leather, completed the dancing chorus trio.
John laughed. He loved his enthusiasm. He felt immediate sympathy for him, heightened by Sherlock's deductions. Peter reminded him quite a lot of the detective, although, fortunately for him, Peter had been graced with a little more social skills than Sherlock.
"You love him."
Lestrade heard the connecting tone and took the phone from Mycroft's hand.
"I knew the only possibility was that John would accept the mission first. You'd go after him without thinking."
Thor tugged at Peter's web. John turned to Everett and Thor, smiled, and took his hand to his forehead in farewell. Thor raised his axe in a farewell gesture.
“Are you going to meet him? Can I go with you?
"He hasn't shown up for days, and I want to see his brother, Mycroft Holmes."
Sherlock sighed. He should never have left his Belstaff in Baker Street.
"You are not doing badly. And the bedroom?"
"So," John continued when they break the kiss, looking at each other tenderly. "From now on, anyone, man or woman, who calls him a freak or similar, will pick his teeth up off the floor with his or her broken fingers. Got it?"
"I need exact coordinates for the spatial-temporal GPS," asked Bruce.
"I can't find John" was his only response.
“Can I ask you something?“ finally said Lestrade. ”You don’t have to answer it if you don’t feel for it.”
"But he was worried. He wrinkled his nose while talking to me".
"Pint?" asked Greg.
"If you need help and can't talk..".
"That is just what my friends call me."
"They're for Daddy and Papa when they come on Sunday."
"Of course. I'm improving your blood circulation. Just relax and enjoy," the detective replied, lowering his tone, caressing his inner tights again. This time his fingers almost reaching John's hips, while his throbbing cock tried to escape from his pants.
"Nothing dangerous. I promise. Nothing explodes, chokes, or stinks."
"We saved what we could. All in William's room burned. Books on the shelves, on the floor, papers... all burned like a pyre. In the basement, these were in a library that Mr. Holmes built so the boy would not end up buried among books. Fortunately, when the fire started, William was in the basement and not in his room or the attic laboratory. The cellar had a direct exit to the garden because Mrs. Holmes didn't stand him and Victor running around the house the whole day".
“You killed John,” the loathing clearly noticeable in Sherlock’s voice. “How could you? You murdered John!”
John chuckled, observing the sleuth looking at their flat windows as a shipwrecked would look at the lifeline.
"Stand up! – requested Mike, and the rest started clapping.
He was so focused on the memory that he didn’t sense the man approaching him. A second after, the world got black, due to the hit on his head.
“See you in the press room.”
"Time to go," shouted Sherlock from the truck, waving his arms to get his attention before Mycroft could add anything. "We got a message from Aunt Lori," he said mockingly.
"Ha, ha," mocked John, bending over to kiss him and shuffling his hair, "not in your wildest dreams."
“Enough! Everyone shut up and get into the car!” Donovan ordered. She was starting to understand Lestrade's exasperation when she and Sherlock engaged in endless taunt duels.
"None of you will go to jail," replied Sherlock, giving each of them one of the papers Bill had been folding. "Ask for DI Lestrade and give him this note. They will let you go immediately."
"Look, Martha," began Molly in a persuasive tone, "I will get some tea, and we quietly talk about it before doing anything, okay? I wouldn't want to have to pick you up at the station".
"Yeah, sure. And Eurus drew that because I was his favourite brother" replied Sherlock sourly.
"You can rest assured," Sherlock said, "Rosie will be well looked after. Virtual tea".
The detective returned to Baker Street and, after assuring John for the umpteenth time that he was well, and staying with him until the doctor was reassured, went to sleep. John went to work after stopping by Mrs Hudson's house to make sure Rosie was all right. And there he left her, sleeping blissfully, just like her father.
"The two of you," Sholto bellowed to Mycroft and Lestrade, giving each an automatic gun, while the veterans took machine guns and assault rifles, "do not leave my side. The rest, move!"
The man meditated for a second.
“Since he is doing your job, you should be more respectful with him.“ John grunted.
"Quantum entanglement," cried Tony through the wind's hooting "in quantum physics, entangled particles remain connected so that actions performed on one affect the other, even when separated by great distances. Our Sherlock and the others are connected by it. This is how he knew where the other is".
The loud, frustrated groan from Sherlock's mouth almost made him feel guilty when he rereleased the detective, once more propelling him towards the ceiling.
"Come, love," panted John "Come for me. We want to see you come".
"He stared at me, upset, and said:
"Congrats John," smirked Sherlock dropping himself on the couch and picking up one of John's medical journals. "Now, you've got an archenemy."
"Here we part," he turned to Mycroft, who was typing on his phone, "All set?
"No, no, you don't understand. It is you who are going to confess that you were the author of all these extortions, deaths, embezzlement and whatever other charges against me..."
Both of them walked where Sherlock and Lestrade were.
Stephen, for his part, looked at him, waiting for him to continue. He would have wanted to talk, but his voice wouldn't come out. He looked sideways at the door, thinking  about  creating a portal and run away from there. God, he was terrified.
"Sherlock, please," replied the detective, shaking her hand. John narrowed his eyes, looking at the Russian spy.
Sherlock's breath hitched when, instead, his hands ran along the skin of the back of his thighs, where they met the arsecheeks, slowly addressing towards his hips. Sherlock giggled and moaned, trying to avoid the arousing tickling sensation, even more as John's hands softly caressed the skin on his hips, reaching his groin, almost, almost, almost, almost touching his cock, but neglecting it at the end.
John nodded while chewing. Living in London was great, but from time to time, they needed a break from the hustle and bustle of nature, especially now with Rosie.
The kitchen was in the same state. Sherlock removed all appliances from where they were fitted, torn off cupboards doors, and scattered all their contents on the floor. The walls had the same holes from ripping out the wiring and searching for electronics. The instruments that Sherlock used for his experiments were broken and scattered on the floor. From the unplugged refrigerator, a nauseating smell was doubtless from some part of a body decomposing due to lack of cold.
"You'll have to ask Papa about that. It's him, remember?"
For a second, Sherlock wondered if it was possible to die from too much pleasure. He couldn't think anymore. Seeing stars, he screwed his eyes shut, his toes curled on the sand as John's fingers picked up the pace, turning Sherlock's moans to screams of ecstasy as the orgasm hit him, spreading throughout his entire body, his hands grabbing the rope like a lifeline, as Jonh kept rubbing his prostate and thumbing the tip of his cock through his orgasm until soft mewls of discomfort escaped from the detective's lips.
"Why can't we kill them?" asked Tony, frustrated, looking around. His scanner was not picking up anything, as F.R.I.D.A.Y. testified. He swallowed when he saw himself as a child, at the age he was when Bucky killed his parents. The boy cast an accusatory look at him.
"She lied," replied the detective.
"He would shoot them both before they hit the ground. He's too fast. And since he is in a dimension that is not his own, we don't know what will happen," grumbled the Sorcerer Supreme.
Lestrade gave her a slap that she dodged, laughing.
“I didn’t know you were jealous as hell.”
"Just long enough for the plane to leave Afghan airspace," Sherlock replied, pulling his phone out of one of his trouser pockets and scrolling the messages.
"And it leads to nothing but filling this place with ghosts."
Moran smiled coldly. Sherlock was scared. Though he tried to hide it, his eyes were desperately scanning the place, looking for a way out, and he was testing the ropes that restrained his arms to the back of the chair. The more he looked around him, the more terrified he got. Because Sebastian worked hard in reproduce even the last tiny detail of the basement where they raped him. The colours, the lights, the armchair, the table… the only difference, the chairs, but it would quickly change. Sebastian knew very well of the devastating power of memories, which could break a prey quicker than any threat.
Mycroft nodded.
"Can I make a bet?" asked Lestrade.
Lestrade shrugged.
“So maybe she could find a way to leave me some clue about where they were going,” said Sherlock entering the dolmen. He produced a little flashlight from his pocket and, getting down on all fours, he combed the inside of the dolmen with the light. In one of the corners, he saw something glowing at the light. He focused it with the light and frowned.
"So some of the gifts may be poisoned, be careful," joked Greg.
"That's it", said John, chanted by Anthea. All of them dropped to the ground, and Donovan caught Mrs Hudson, who staggered dangerously.
John told the detective to get in front of the table, and he got behind him, glued to the detective's body so he could feel John's hard cock against his ass. The doctor took Sherlock's hands, put them on the dough, and showed him how he had to stretch it, then pick it up to extend it again.
"What else haven't you told me?"
"Happy Valentine, John" Sherlock gently rubbed the bottom of a glass of water on John's forehead, who groaned in relief while throwing a murderous smile to the detective, for how ironic the statement sounded in his situation.
Bart nodded.
"It's true, it's true, he bought it from that estate agent... what was it called... Les Châtelons?"
"Aaaaaaaaaaaaarg" he roared, helpless and frustrated when Mycroft tried to stop him again, making his boyfriend jump back a bit.
"Your turn", John said Mike "how do we defuse the bomb?"
The elder Holmes raised his eyebrows, puzzled.
"Mycroft..."
"I need you inside me, John," begged in a purr the detective.
"Is Rosie going to throw rose petals while Sherlock enters the Wedding March rhythm?" mocked Greg, trying to cheer them up.
John smiled, then got serious.
"Do you have a pool?"
“Are you drunk? That case never was settled, as none of these”, he gestured, covering the lots of file boxes behind him. “I was dismissed after the fifteenth victim, remember? I’m sure you do. You didn't hesitate a second in running to the Chief Superintendent, ensuring you were much more capable of solving the case than the poor, clumsy Lestrade. And you got my position. After all, that was what you always wanted, since the day you arrived at the Yard, “ he spat.
Mycroft removed the safety catch.
The mercenary didn't reply not daring to look into John's eyes.
"What is so funny?"
Donovan felt the anger overwhelm her. She was a Detective Inspector, wasn’t she? She retained the door.
“Ryan?” repeated the first one, this time in a more worried tone.
John waited. The detective never talked about his rehabilitation therapy, and the idea of Sherlock talking with a therapist was almost science fiction for him.
Leaning, he traced a path of soft kisses over the doctor's jawn until he reached his mouth and, sticking his tongue out just a bit, gently caressed John's lips, making the doctor pant with the touch and the sound of Sherlock's soft whines.
They melted back into an embrace, John letting out a sob from time to time, Sherlock softly humming a song, stroking the doctor's hair, trying to comfort him, rocking their bodies gently, both letting go of the sorrow, anguish, loneliness and pain of those days apart.
When the door closed behind them, he turned to Stephen.
“I’m not sure if I could fix it this time, John” wailed Mycroft “This is very serious.”
"So?" Sherlock was getting impatient. "Has Anderson infect you all with his stupidity?"
"Well.., Strange is gone…"
"On a wide range of naughty and pleasurable possibilities."
At his signal, the group of mercenaries opened up and made way for a tall, huge and strong man that limped slowly toward them. Sherlock opened his eyes in fear realising he was his torturer in Serbia. His arms, neck and face were disfigured by a multitude of scars from cuts, burns and blows and his right eye was covered by a patch.
“Do you want me to hit you with it so you realize it’s real?” he pulled the book out of her hands. “Now, leave me alone. I’m really enjoying it. This Sherlock Holmes is brilliant.
John smiled widely. It was great to be the brilliant one from time to time.
"Can Milo sleep in our bed?" asked Sherlock a bit later, as the three of them approached to one of Mycroft's car, followed by the two dogs, happily trotting with them.
"Yes?" Lestrade picked up the phone without hardly letting it ring.
The detective put on a pair of black boxing inner gloves and fitted the bandages around his wrists, then took a double back gun holsters from his backpack, buckled it to his chest, and loaded two automatic weapons onto it. He started up the motorcycle, twisted the throttle accelerating to the maximum, and headed for the dune. The motorbike climbed up effortlessly and flew out the sand. Sherlock jumped up, fell on the sand, and slide down the dune at full speed, his eyes fixed on the motorbike. Once he reached the rocky ground, he ran to the cabin.
"Oh, yes. Somehow it's a Pirate's book. Dread Pirate Roberts and so, remember?" he gave his voice a deep, hollow tone as he recited the passage from the book "
"Thank for coming back to me." whispered John, his voice muffled by Sherlock's body.
He was still hanging on by his wrists. They sent him back with Bill and the others, hoping the pain would make him give up. When they left him in, they dragged Jonas out. If they couldn't force John to call, their captors would get one of the others to do it. But they were all turning out to be just equally stubborn.
"Mr. Holmes, good to see you," said the man. Sherlock scowled at him. Rosie looked at him in surprise. The man smiled, and his eyes filled with wrinkles.
She chuckled, shooshing him to get him out of the lounge chair. While he slept, she and Bart picked up everything, and all that remained was Sherlock's sunbed, which she closed and carried under her arm.
“See love? You could do it”.
John sighed in despair. He knew that there would be no way to change his mind.
"Don't separate yourselves," warned Stephen.
The sentence "Mediocrity knows nothing higher than itself, but talent instantly recognizes genius" appears in "The Valley of Fear". Actually in the book it's Watson who says it, but I thought it was a great way to praise John and to explain why he saw in Sherlock what anyone couldn't.
"Prove it. Or I won't let you come."
The man obeyed.
"You will find him," Bill reassured him.
“What is human micro… micro?” asked Rosie.
Sherlock let out a moaned cry and grabbed the base of his cock to prevent him from coming, the taste of John's come still in his mouth, intensifying the feeling of the dildo against his prostate.
Rosie opened her eyes, delighted.
"But you wanted to come. You have been bugging me the whole day to let you come. So… here we go".
"Presumptuous," retorted the doctor getting even closer, rubbing his cock in the detective's ass.
"That increases its sensitivity," he grunted between gasps.
He sighed, noticing how his stomach shrank at the thought of the coldness with which he had said goodbye. He feared this was the end of their relationship. Lestrade had never let him down, until now. The DI was going to break up with him. There was no other explanation.
He looked at Sherlock, a bit concerned.
"I know. You won't lose him," assured Mycroft, trying to sound confident. "John loves you, is extremely strong, and very bad-tempered. All of which will help him get through. Before you know it, he'll be nagging you about this mess you've made at the hospital.
*******
The woman raised an eyebrow, staring at him. Sherlock wondered why he felt like a child again in front of her, and knowing well that look would mean  problems if he replied, closed his mouth, turned around, and fetch John and Rosie. After more than twenty long and unnerving minutes that Rosie took to say goodbye to her new friends, the three of them lined up on the sand towards the house, while, behind them, the sun began to disappear on the sea.
"hmmm, I see, you mean good cock sluts get a reward…….." teased John, looking him straight in the eye. The detective blushed slightly and nodded, "Maybe later, now we have to prepare lunch."
"Moriarty", declared Sherlock.
"Sherlock, look at me. I can't get near you; I can't get near Rosie. I have a fever, and I keep sneezing and coughing. Can you explain to me how we're going to celebrate anything when I' m like this?"
Both chuckled, and Tony rolled his eyes. That looked like an alumni meeting. Natasha came up to him.
"Tomorrow, when we return to London, perhaps everything will be easier for him."
He looked fondly at Sherlock, who raised his head and looked back at him. John frowned as he saw the detective's eyes sparkling with tears.
He gasped, terrified, when, while advancing towards Sherlock, the Serb produced a stick with sharp metal spikes at the end.
Lestrade looked at him in amazement. Mycroft looked at him, impatient.
“Oh! Thank you very much for the book! It is an honour to meet you!”
"I will, I promise," he replied in a muffled voice, unable to look at him, his face still sunken in John's neck, breathing in that scent that always soothed him. "I just need a little more time. You just worry about getting well, okay?"
Watson scowled at him but turn to Sally and both went to the car.
"Criminals' days are numbered," assured John, bumping his mug into Peter's.
“No, but it’ll give me time”.
Donovan chuckled.
"Is this why you came back?" asked Lestrade puzzled. "For a drawing?"
"Great. Great. He has a brother. Great," ironized Stark, raising an eyebrow.
"Good night, Bumblebee."
“I got depressed, feeling so bad… I didn’t find anything to help me to keep on waking up, coming to work…, all seemed senseless to me. One day, at the tube, someone forgot his book on the seat. I took the book, sat there and started reading. I got hooked. And the invectives Sherlock Holmes threw to the Yards… I pictured him throwing them to Donovan and Anderson, and, it’s silly, but I felt better. As if Holmes were cleaning my name…, doing justice or something like that.“ He smiled, a bit embarrassed and looked and John. Surprisingly, he found understanding in John’s eyes. He nodded unnoticeably.
Sherlock shook his head.
"Imagine my hand in your cock, like this, feel my hand in your cock," moaned John. He stroked upward and slowly stroked back down. Sherlock held a whine low in his throat. His brain instantly recreated the feeling, and it was as if John were playing with his cock. His mind retrieved the felling of John's hand around it, and oh, it felt so good even only in his imagination….
The holidays had gone by at full speed. Mornings on the beach, swimming, walking along the shore, reading and resting on the deck chair, Rosie playing with her friends, John joining their parents for a while in the afternoon at Rosie’s request, and Sherlock joining them from time to time. In the evenings, they traveled around the island, hiked in the mountains, and watched breathtakingly beautiful sunsets ... a vacation so typical and far from their daily lives that had been almost unreal.
He and Sherlock spoke almost daily if the situation permitted and, if not, the doctor sent him a text message to let him know he was safe.
Donovan nodded.
"But what on earth are you doing?" asked Mycroft.
"ohhhhhhhhhhh, god, yes, god, yessssssssssssssssssss, John mmmmmmmmm" Sherlock moaned loudly, "please, touch memmmm, somebody, plesssssssssssss."
Because, in fact, every morning, at eleven, traffic went from minimal to non-existent, the few passers-by disappeared, and even the activity in supermarkets, shops, warehouses, and the rest of the businesses that were still open slowed down a little. The only exception was the hospitals, where the fight against the virus continued relentlessly, but even the sick who were already recovering seemed calmer during those two hours. In short, it was not known why, but the city, at that time of the day, became a ghost town.
Sherlock lowered his head.
"Steve, no!"
"All of them."
“But…
"Don't forget the glass," John reminded him, without taking his cock out of his mouth, the vibration of his voice making the detective tremble even more, as he cursed between his teeth, tensing his body, trying to control it.
"It's starting!" clapped the woman "this is from the first day, but they've left it as an introduction."
"Luckily for us, my little brother is always at the top of the list."
“What?”
"It takes a lot of energy to dissolve inter-dimensional boundaries, and the universe tends to hold on to it. But your alter ego and Ross could be anywhere".
The other men stared at both of them, hesitantly. Even trapped by John, the detective still scared them. John walked backward, pulling the detective to a large, heavy table. Sherlock climbed on it and laid down on his back as John took out his shoes and socks and stripped him from his shoes trousers and pants,
"Okay, and the code to defuse the bomb?" asked Bill. "How the hell did you know that?"
Sherlock frowned. They have talked before about John bottoming, and they even tried a couple of times, but John backed out at the end, frustrated and worried. Sherlock didn't want to push him. In John's mind, he knew that it was one thing to acknowledge his bisexuality and another to accept that he could enjoy being fucked by Sherlock. His body wanted it, but his head wouldn't allow it.
The detective dropped into bed, relieved.
"I... I want to talk to DI L… Lestrade" stammered the man.
"Here you can play all the time you want," she promised, making the girl's eyes light up. "What do you think?" Irene asked, standing at the door.
"I was tipping on my computer about our last case. It was summer, the seventeenth of July, and Sherlock was in the kitchen, embedded in some of his experiments. Then he asked me if I had anything scheduled for the twenty-five of November!" John smiled with the memory. "I didn't pay close attention to him, but I remember muttering that I was free. He kept on with his experiment. Five minutes later, he said that, as both of us were free, it would be the perfect day for getting married, based in only God knows what calculations or deductions he had done."
"Go away," ordered the detective without lifting his head from the ground.
"You already know the story," protested John.
"Gentlemen, these are your new uniforms. In those rooms," Mycroft gestured to the doors, "you can shower, shave, and you'll find your shoes. Do your best. You must be flawless. I will check you, and I am warning you: I'm a very demanding man".
"Don't you dare," John snaps, anticipating Sherlock's response. There's a long pause, and he has a feeling that they’re communicating with their eyes, both waiting for the other to cave. Apparently, the doctor is close to losing, Sherlock’s voice thrilled as he takes his advantage.
Sherlock thinks about that. Not entirely unique, given John’s history. But to the detective, it’s novel enough that he has to contribute significant brainpower to figuring out the next course of action. He said he would forget, but it seems that the door to his recent memory is locked – his own mind turned against him to preserve the feeling of warm lips on his own, the graze of fingertips almost tilting up his jaw when he failed to react. He can still smell John’s cologne, see the flush of his face so close and feel the ragged exhale of the doctor still catching his breath.
“Baker Street it is.”
Sherlock can feel the steady breathing of unconscious sleep against his throat, hands twitching to clutch a bit tighter as he hears the paramedics arrive, reality asserting itself again. It takes Lestrade’s hand around Sherlock’s bicep to get him out of the way, watching them check the doctor’s vitals and set up the gurney, finding that his state is more likely due to fatigue and other conditions rather than a life-threatening emergency. Sherlock hears it all pass through his ears but nothing sticks. He follows them in a daze, his eyes following John’s face whether it’s blocked by a person’s back as they work or visible between neon vests.
“Sherlock,” Mrs. Hudson tries. He looks right through them. The man goes to the window, knocking on the side of the pane until he hits hollow, pushing that square back and reaching down into darkness to pull out vials, also unlabeled. They go on the table as well. A ceiling tile above the kitchen table comes down, revealing taped syringes and lighters.
“I could not bear losing you twice, John Watson. I wouldn’t ask you to abandon your position if I wasn’t sure that it’s for the best.” He nods, having said his piece.
John looks close to arguing, then he just sighs, leaning back in the chair. “Yes, I would.”
Sherlock plays the piece created for Him for her, opening his eyes at the end to see Eurus’ head tilted, staring at the wall. She’s weeping, but her expression is less sadness and more understanding. “Oh.” He nods, playing it again as they wait for Mycroft to arrive.
Harry is shocked to see him at the door, something he can understand without using his deductive capabilities.
Mrs. Hudson finds that Sherlock will join her for a walk around London on occasion, and as grateful as she is for the company, she hopes that one day he’ll refuse.
"Absolutely not."
The phone rings once and he hears a careful breath, one that means John is fighting to remain calm.
They’ve lost John. If they aren’t very, very careful, they’ll lose Sherlock too.
“Sorry, what’s going on?”
“And that may be a good thing. For now.” There’s a slight creak as Sherlock rests his head on relaxed arms. When Mycroft peers around the corner of the chair’s cushion, he sees that swollen eyes have closed again, Sherlock’s jaw clenched with troubling force. Grief is a process.
In the end, it takes four and Ms. Hudson wins the pool.
On a sunny afternoon a few weeks later, Mycroft finds Sherlock kneeling on the ground and slouched over John’s armchair, forehead resting on his intertwined hands. The visual is accompanied by a broken sound that reminds Mycroft of two things: rooftops and crack dens. Since they are in no way near the top of a building, he leans down to his brother, already fuming.
“Yes, we do. Family as well – your parents and Mycroft in the front row.”
“Find him.” Greg hangs up, stuffing the phone into a pocket and squeezing his eyes closed. “Shit.”
“She has to live here, Sherlock. Don’t give her nightmares.”
The inspector is still there as Sherlock wakes up, watching the detective open his eyes easily - as though he had just shut them to think. Mrs. Hudson reluctantly releases the man as he pulls away from her to walk toward the wall of books. Sherlock clears a shelf, setting everything on the floor and pulling the wooden slab free only to turn the shelf around, sliding out a long panel and dumping the contents on the table. Greg frowns as he sees the compression band and several unmarked bags of assorted pills.
“An hour.” There’s a delighted whoop and the sound of rustling fabric, likely the detective changing jackets. “Sherlock, do you hear me? One hour. One.”
“Oh, that’s comforting. I’ll make sure to mention it to our closest friends and family when they ask why I’m at the altar alone.” There’s a sharp knock on the doctor’s side of the line.
John smiles, animated by the detective’s delight at giving chase. His pulse thrums with anticipation and he pretends not to notice when Sherlock’s fingers graze his wrist to check for a heartbeat. They slide over his open hand and lace with his own, settling on his knee as the car begins to move.
“Sorry. Taking care of a toddler doesn’t leave much time for cleaning.” Sherlock can tell that they spend a lot of time with Rosie, enough that they really don’t have plenty of time to do anything else. Overcompensating, he supposes, for being all she has left. “Clara’s gone out to the shops, but you’re welcome to stay until she gets back.” She turns away, calling out for her voice to reach further into the house. “Where are you, little monster?” Rosie laughs from a nearby closet, poking her head out and shrieking as Harry scoops her back into the hall. “Easy, easy. We have a guest.” The girl looks up and up, so small compared to Sherlock. He crouches.
Greg gets called back into work and he leaves with an excessive huff, letting them know that he’ll see them next weekend for Rosie’s birthday party. Sherlock waits until they’ve put the girl to bed to take his leave, accepting the light hug that Clara offers while Harry just waves with their empty glasses and whispers her goodbye.
“I am the British government. You truly believe I’d go that far over petty family squabbles?”
“The point-” Sherlock stops, like he can’t be bothered.
Sherlock wrestles with the thought and loses, the sound of a door slammed cutting him from his memory and back to the present. There are strong footsteps, moving fast back up the staircase. He’s already at the door by the time John’s cleared the turn, barely opening it in time for them to collide.
Molly rushes into her connected office, Greg watching through the glass until she turns away, shoulders shaking. With a resolute breath, she walks back out, her hand settling on the edge of the cloth and lifting it away, air rushing from her like there’s no room in her chest anymore. Greg stays with her, waiting for the report - and for Sherlock to come in with John at his side, teasing them for their tears.
No - wait … Sher Lockholme? There’s an extra S?
It would give them structure. It would soothe their demons.
"Three days," Sherlock admitted, embarrassed at the confession.
- IDIOT! - He leaned back into the room. John's head coming up again to greet him. As if on a string. He hadn't gone too far then ...
Every instinct in his makeup was claiming that Sherlock was HIS.
And his talent
“John,” Sherlock pulled away just to ask. The question must be important. “Will you take Moran down with me? I … I can’t do this on my own. Not …  not now,” he stated humbly.

Would you care to join me instead before we all make our way back to Jolly Old England?” His hand clamped down on Victor’s shoulder. A few policemen were making their way over to put the petty thief in handcuffs. Sherlock smiled as he waved them away.
Hands deep in Sherlock’s silky curls. Sherlock’s own on pressed into the wall and one on John’s shoulder, grasping a handful of his shirt as if it would somehow keep them from floating away? As Sherlock now began instructing
And it had been important. To both of them. To mark it.

He looked around, noticing the archaic wall mounted device.

The tune shifted, and he was swaying now, waltzing towards the window with Vivaldi at his fingertips. Eyes still firmly shut. But listening. Hearing John’s movements in the kitchen behind him as he played. The shuffle of feet as John took off his shoes. Rested against the counter to watch surreptitiously.

“Nothing alike,” Sherlock sobered the air around them, by correcting John. Harshly.
The waiter now turned to John. Pulling off his thin rimmed glasses and picking up a napkin from the table - he dipped it in John’s glass of water and then wiped the clearly penciled in moustache from his face.

. That Sherlock could cause a miracle to happen. And come get him out. Take him home. Brush him off. Check him for wounds.
Sherlock never stopped for anything. Not when he was focused.
"Yes you did," John finished for him, "you already made three separate dishes, knowing you. Backup plan! Or you wouldn't be out here so calmly, instead of running the ship!" His eye wandered to the doors of the kitchen behind Sherlock’s side of the booth.
"Yes, John, anything ... !"
She had shown the same patient kindness to him when he needed the space, over the last few weeks.

Sherlock hesitated.
It's not that easy ...
An invalided soldier with prematurely greying blonde hair, a limp, and a penchant for flipping off cab drivers …
… “ he turned to look john in the eye … “
He stopped spewing sentiment long enough to put his head in his hands.
Which reminded him …!
He had left some of his own behind in his wake. He had not been able to bring himself to return.
Laughable.
John slumped against the ceramic tile.
John smiled, “‘Course. Anything. Anything I can do, to help restore Sherlock Holmes to the world where he belongs. I am yours ... to use as you will, Sherlock.”
“Because John, he wanted to win. And as long as he was alive, he could still potentially call them off … So …” he spun around shrugging as he did so. Like it was a given. The solution. One had to shoot oneself …
Sherlock twitched with anger.
Against the throng of people …
How many times have you read it?
“Sherlock …” he paused, searching for the right words, and putting his hand on top of Sherlock’s where it rested on the table … “ I don’t know why you did it ... or - for that matter - how?? … you bloody managed it … but …  you’re alive! You’re breathing! And I …” John was really trying not to get emotional. Not here. Not in public … “I don’t need to know

That Sherlock
And then ...  Sherlock began repeating the words he had spoken out loud back to him.
February.
Catch you next time!
Thump Thump ...
Smiling like a fool …
. That time. He knew taking John tonight would be different.
John Watson had answered truthfully. There was no other place he would rather be, than with Sherlock Holmes. Even if it was to end this way...
Her eyes had glittered, as she accepted.
Sherlock was thinking on John's words. On the implications of just how soon ...  John had truly fallen for
Then remarking, "Sorry. How did you ...? Know?" Curiosity.
“You seem a bit uncomfortable, John?” the man asked after a moment, “did you want to go somewhere else? A bit more private?” That flirtation again. Downright lewd honestly. Not even a hint of charm.
Conspiring together, no doubt, about how they could further torture the wedding party with minutae … How far
And did not reply.
John grinned at the playful tone in Sherlock’s voice. He looked up, remembering the waiter - and laughed it off casually. Releasing the youth from his uncertainty, "thank you, yes! Just being an idiot. A few moments would be great ..."
Sherlock caught it, before it hit the floor.
On the eve of his
to do … ? He checked his notes.
in a moment ... Sherlock realized why …
Or replace them...
Sherlock’s other hand slipped out from underneath where it lay, and he used two fingers to press on John's pulse point. Between the radius and ulna - he noted, medically -
"Not interested?" he straightened up, looking Sherlock squarely in the eye.
Nat seemed relieved to be talking to the fellow soldier.
Mike Stamford had been correct. Sherlock had never believed in love at first sight.
The realization of what Sherlock had also meant, hit, and it lit something inside John. Warmth. His pulse racing. He adjusted himself in his seat and decided to pursue Sherlock's train of thought, momentarily. But for now, he should probably find out what Sherlock was dealing with here? That kept him on lockdown. If he was going to be able to offer his help in any way ...
John said. And flipped the menu over harshly. Reviewing all the drink options carefully. He may need a few tonight ...
-   a heap  -
A steady marriage.
John deflated.
- he deduced, glancing down at John from out of the corner of his eye. Amused.
Lestrade looked a question back at Sherlock, and then back to John with a hearty smile and laugh as he waved. His eyes glittering.
. He clearly did not care, or feel the same way as John.
A note came back almost immediately, as John was digging in. He nearly had the entire dish polished off.
Sherlock clarified for him, "which was it -

But John was already pushing away from the counter, coming towards Sherlock. His eyes unreadable. So dark and hooded in this harsh kitchen lighting.
them properly. Their pupils blown wide. Like bottomless pools of clear water, ringed in darkest blue.
Almost a month of Fridays had come and gone. John was feeling every inch of the walk that had taken him from the Surgery to the Landmark. But he had needed the room to clear his head. Sherlock's voice was breaking in more frequently of late. And not always in character.
I am unavailable.
Perhaps staying at this hotel, so near the airport, had been a bad idea. But then, he had hoped that if by some chance Sherlock was leaving today - they might at least accidentally cross paths?
Barefoot on the linoleum ...?
Sherlock took a moment to respond, and John was afraid he might have gone
Sherlock  had not even
A handshake offered more to life ...
Ages?? Really?
He decided it was best to take a day off, to himself. To
Both satiated. John curled up at last, wrapping the duvet around their bottom half in the darkness. His head was resting more on Sherlock’s arm than the meager pillow beneath them … so he adjusted to the shoulder area. Hoping it was not too uncomfortable for Sherlock. He would have to rectify this situation
He stopped himself.
“I’m sorry, Signore,” John could hear him softly saying over his shoulder, abject apology written in his words  … “but your card has been declined.” On that last word he threw the offending piece of plastic across the table to land in Sherlock’s lap. Drawing out a gasp.
"Sherlock, don't -" John tried to will him back, "- bother!"
John had needed the boost in confidence to have a friend -
Oculist is hardly a word
“Three,” Sherlock repeated, “I did what I did, to save three people:
"Have you even eaten? Sherlock!!! How many days has it been!?!!" she tutted about him.
That thought was immediately shattered though;
Even after that. He had left. He was Angry.
John needed it.
Rumor has it
John scribbled a hasty note, and flagged down a waiter to run it into the kitchen for him:

"Still there?" She asked, clearly befuddled, "Oh! You mean Sherlock's things. 'Course dear. Couldn't bear to see it moved." She was pulling something warm and delicious out of the oven. John could smell the butter. "Mycroft came slinking in one afternoon, tried to bring some men up, and I put paid to him! Told him I had my rights as a Landlord and Sherlock hadn't paid his bills, so the stuff would stay until I decided what to do with it. Besides, I knew what Sherlock would want done with his stuff - and I doubted Mycroft would!"
John got the impression that

The hotel manager began scanning through the registry.
This was what he had been missing.
“Dunno? Just sounded like a romantic place to run off to?” Mike shrugged, “you were always a bit of a romantic, if I recall!” He waggled his eyebrows at John, and had John laughing again.
Sherlock seethed.
Mike just made a ‘well-there-you-have-it!’ look in response. Opening the window between them and finally giving the driver their directions.
A headstone amongst the many that were not
John was glad to know that Sherlock was still being of help to a world in crisis.
In which, there is a jumper ...
“Not yet, you berk!” John chided, pointing at the garment. But Sherlock wouldn’t let him take it off?
But John Watson felt none of that anger in his case, nor the righteous vindication in either argument.
why … but ... he could just feel it ...
It was a look Sherlock often gave John, but John had never felt so much pleasure from it ... and perhaps, because - Sherlock now knew why John had held himself like this
like a stranger?
At the end of it.
Sherlock dismissed it.
When he had seen
But John was also turning to look at Mike now ...
In which John spends half his life feeding Sherlock ...
He tore at his jacket and dress suit. Stripping his garments and unbuttoning his shirt throwing it in haste ... to breathe ... just breathe ... !!! He felt his shoulders wrack with it. Shuttering in on himself as he crumpled to the floor, sobbing. Heaving breath after violent breath. His exposed back leaning against the cold doorframe like an earthquake victim, sheltering from the inevitable disaster. Even as it descended, unimpeded to wreak havoc.

Like a child at being found out. At playing hide and seek.
It was not something Sherlock would have expected. It’s quiet comfort.

“Hey,” Mike tried to calm him before he pulled some of it out, “I get it. I’ll take care of it.”

He had killed the woman after all.

Of course, Sherlock would remember word-for-word what had issued forth from his mouth on a fucking stupid whim.
He turned back into the room once he had the teacups in hand.
"Afraid you'd bolt?" the cabbie's words stuck out to John, now - wondering
The early morning hours had a few more creaks and thumps and shouts that melded into the hubbub of the city that just won’t sleep …
He himself had felt so empty since the war. Like a balloon that might float away into the sky at any moment, if not tied down ...
were not something the genius had many of, the way Sherlock had spoken. There were clearly one or two, but all seemed very much
“Hey, Mike?” John asked, hoping his voice landed on casual, and not on ‘hey-my-entire-life-is-riding-on-the-possibility-of-something-stupid-and-entirely-crazy-right-now’. He already felt like a nutter, and didn’t want to taint Mike’s response. How readily was he considering going after this Holmes fellow …? After one night of talking? Texting?
Hesitate.
And he decided.
He decided ...
Soothing John’s nerves.
He blinked. Had somehow expected his returning? He blinked again.
He was killing time.
I know a good thing when I see it!
Sherlock asked him.
this Doctor Strange had sent her to him? But it seemed a ridiculous question, and so he kept it to himself.
Outline and all.
--<>--
grateful for having made that Hotel choice.
Sherlock was berating himself, unnecessarily, it seemed.
He almost wanted to say 'Thank you', in reply
He wanted to yell! and scream!! ... at someone ...
All looked right with the world?
"Is that it?"
“Yes?” Suddenly you can’t breathe properly, waiting for the words that will come next …
John could not see how he had kept himself from doing this years ago? The colossal strength it had taken, he should win a medal! He should win all the medals! This was heaven!!!
Imagining their fingers touching ...
The bartender looked at him, smiling. Trying to hear him over the noise. “Good food?” John was saying a bit louder now. The man handed him a flyer.
," he looked at the waiter then, and he knew he had a desperation in his eyes, "please?"
His face was inches from John's own. His body betraying him, even as his heart wanted to hold. He was keeping himself back from pressing any part of him closer to John, but feeling the energy sing between them.
Since this was a really long one!!!! I have uploaded one chapter, the next recording will be several again. Just a heads up!!
And John could only watch in horror as he fell.
“Sherlock Holmes?” he at last managed, as if clarifying a fine point. John cleared his throat and held the device to his ear. Listening as it merely echoed his own pulse. His heart was beating so loud …
He had let himself in through from the street, silently. So as not to disturb their little tête-à-tête.
*** 💘 ***
You literally
He wondered -
Thump Thump ...
He tried to put it back to rights.
John stuttered in his thoughts. Two sides warring with each other in this. "SHERLOCK!!!" he was yelling into the crowd. And they would not let him through. He was being pushed back. Sneaking through as a kid to see the corpse one more time. A crowd had gathered around and they all wanted to see, and they were pushing him out of the way ...  others were pulling him away ... dragging him from the gravestone … pulling him hard by his hands, his hair..  and a very alive Sherlock being buried in the open grave before that cold black stone ...  "NO, no, NO!!" John was yelling as they manhandled him, “you can’t bury him!” and carried him off ... "SHERLOCK!!!"  pulling at him …  leading him ...  away from the body ...  a breathing body ...
“Mr. Watson, not Doctor. “
Sherlock gave him his phone.
"… oh God, yes."
Sherlock raised the right corner of his mouth.
Sherlock got up and down, taking out almost the whole of John's cock as his body went up and sitting on lap again as he went down. The bar allowed him full movement, moaning hard when adjusted so that every time he went down, John's cock hit his prostate.
"There is no other way? You control time. You did it once." he asked, his voice full of hope and sorrow.
"Don't worry; we are well protected."
Mycroft swallowed, wondering how he had been so foolish as to be caught in such a crude trap. Naked and unmoving, he could only appear indifferent to the man who walked around him, gazing up and down at him, brushing slighting his fingers against his skin.
"There, sir."
“Of course you should do it!“ Assure Lestrade. “You...
He looked back at Mike.
"Fuck, God, Sherlock," John whimpered. "Faster, faster."
“Yes, I was the DI before Donovan.”
"Detective Inspector, could you call Sergeant Donovan and ask her for a copy of the arrest warrants?"
Just as Sherlock tried to wriggle away from the stage, John grabbed him by the arm.
The little girl nodded, excited by the idea and run to the next tent, trying not to make a sound. Sherlock went to the others, waking the rest of the child. Soon all of them were wearing their pajamas, jackets and boots, shivering with cold, but they didn’t have time for more. The kids were doing their best to be silent, though some of them couldn’t give small excited shouts, quickly silenced by Sherlock. He picked up his backpack.
"It's a property of the surface of a liquid that allows it to resist an external force due to the cohesive nature of the water molecules." answered the girl, as casually as if she were answering her favorite color.
Sherlock opened one of the cells and pulled out a large drawer that was in it. He opened it and started throwing guns and automatic rifles at Sholto and the others. He stopped when he reached John.
Sitting in his armchair, head in hand, dressed for the funeral but barefoot, was John. He did not attempt to turn around when he heard the door open, he didn't move an inch. He continued to stare at the violin, which, since Sherlock's death, had been the only occupant of the detective's armchair.
“Everything has been cleaned and restored” Mycroft reassured him.
"You don't have to be ashamed for it," whispered John in Sherlock's lips, kissing him, both swinging slightly back and forth. "It's hot to make you coming that way," his hardening cock highlighting his words.
Sherlock shook his head.
He, Sholto, Jake, and Pete got into one of the cars, Mark and Rod in the next. In the third car, only the driver was traveling.
At that moment, they heard the sound of several trucks approaching. Sherlock frowned.
"I'm sorry, I..."
"Told you."
John's moans got more intense, his breathing accelerated, and Sherlock knew his orgasm was approaching. But how the hell…
Mycroft groaned softly, and Greg twisted the nipple slightly.
Donovan smiled naughtily.
"She exaggerates," mouthed Sherlock, taking advantage of how the cook had her back turned.
But then, from the canopy to protect himself from the sun, he observed John and Rosie's happy faces while building a sandcastle, both kneeling on the shore, patting the mud to give it the desired shape, discussing the height of the battlements or deciding where to put a seaweed that Rosie found attractive. At that moment, seeing them radiant with happiness, the sun, the cream, the sand, the people, the jealousy, the discomfort, and the burns, all it was all worth it.
“Your books have saved my life.”
“My cleverness…”.
Sherlock startled when John entered the flat, slamming the door with all his strength.
But it wasn’t a finger precisely what he was going to use with Sherlock.
“So I guess you know you should apologize for something more.”
John chuckled.
and the children?” repeated John, his tone rising. “And what about you?
"And he hung up before I could ask him anything. I called him back, and he didn't answer the phone. I think he was about to die of embarrassment. But I decided I had nothing to lose and went to the date. And, well, I discovered another Irene. More docile. And she discovered another Molly. More authoritarian. And I'm not going to say any more".
“I couldn’t John” he whispered “I… I’ve never told anyone... And I hoped not having to…, but it was devouring me, and I was afraid of... losing you”
Rosie nodded, disappointed, and frowned again.
“But you can find them. If someone can, it’s you. You are Sherlock Holmes, remember?”
"I'm going to make tea, would you like some?. It was very kind of you to help me up. I wish everyone were as nice to me as you are," the landlady spoke softly, though glaring at Molly.
"Yes, but
Lestrade wiped away his tears and stared at his boyfriend.
"We don't want to bother you, brother."
He looked back and forth across the deserted street. The last time and he wouldn't go back to that house. The sooner it was over, the better.
Sherlock stirred up, uncomfortable, and dismissed the apologies with a wave of his hand. John, for his part, didn’t seem to accept the excuses.
Sherlock gulped, his eyes filled with tears.
The doctor got into the jacuzzi and pulled Sherlock in, the perfect warmness of the oiled water caressing them.
John would love to play with him some more, but he would come if he kept doing it. After a few seconds to regain his self-control, slowly let Sherlock sit on his cock, opening it up inch by inch.
"Captain, you are insatiable."
“Sherlock is right. You are a terrible liar”.
"Who the hell are you?" asked Tony, "You are communicating through an Avengers private line."
Rosie hugged Molly, squeezing her tightly, resting her head on Molly's shoulder, scared, but trying to be brave, like her parents. The pathologist, noticing this, was tempted to take Rosie with her. But the risk was too high.
"You are a genius, Bruce," Steve praised, slapping him on the back.
Sally pushed the dildo inside him another inch, as John started stroking himself, looking at Donovan fucking the detective's ass. Sherlock rolled his eyes, stubbornly clenching his teeth to hold his moans as she sank another inch, and another, until, with a hard thrust, she buried the whole dildo inside Sherlock's ass.
“unnnnnnnnnnnh” groaned Sherlock “… don’t…. stop…. aaaaah”.
"The Four Seasons?" Mycroft mumbled with clenched teeth. "What tiny part of your useless brain worked out the idea that my brother would play The four Seasons?" the British Government spat the words as if Vivaldi was some kind of disgusting bug. He turned to Lestrade. "And these are your best people?"
"Of course, we have a pint pending, all the chairs taken, this time".
A couple of hours later, Greg and John got into the DI's car. Lestrade settled down in his seat and lokked at John for a few moments.
"Dr. Watson! Wow! I am an absolute fan of your blog. That's so cool! I love the way you write. It's fascinating! And the best part is the unsolved cases!"
"I'm sorry, Doctor Strange, please continue."
The detective woke up, blinked several times, and kissed him back. Without breaking the kiss, he rose slowly to a sitting position. John sat down next to him.
John decided to give him the last straw. When he started this little game, he didn't think he would enjoy it so much. He turned the phone towards the detective's face so that he could read the screen. Sherlock clenched his fists.
“There you could find four of the eight prisoners escaped from Belmarsh Prison,” explained in a tired voice. “The rest are in a dolmen around three hundred meters away in that direction.”
“Fuck you? Interesting proposal…” teased the doctor.
"No. But I'll give you a hint instead. Since you are sooooo smart, you wouldn't need more. Codes aren't numbers, but letters. Same, but different."
"I know, I'm his landlady, that's why I want to see his brother."
"I don't know what you're talking about."
John's hand went through his crack. His medium finger brushed between both buttocks, without parting them, while the index and ring fingers caressed the glorious globes. Sherlock moaned louder, waiting for his hands to reach his cock, but he ostensibly ignored it, as he did with his testicles and perineum.
"No, not an argument," answered the DI distractedly, making some of them giggle a bit, others coughing to conceal the giggling.
"Not only enjoyed. It was amazing. You were amazing. It has been liberating, different, reassuring, overwhelming... You were perfect, love".
John swallowed with difficulty.
"Oh, god," sighed John, grabbing his abdomen with his right hand, "I thought I couldn't be able to laugh again."
"I do." Thor raised his hand.
"To the John Watson's ex- male lovers Convention? No thanks", he replied, pretending to sound bored and nonchalant.
"I know, but Sherlock is not the only one who cares about you" Lestrade started the engine, a bit hurt.
"You… you are... you are..."
"You shot him at point-blank range," accused Clint.
"Agile, I mean, agile."
Lestrade could not blame the older Holmes for being angry. They both decided it would be NYS officers who would keep an eye on Sherlock and prevent him from fading away. The detective was so mad with Mycroft that if he saw one of his agents' cars near his flat, he would most likely shoot it with a grenade launcher.
"You really don't know? The great Mycroft Holmes doesn't know?" He let out a cold, evil, mocking laugh. "What a great truth it is that when the student is ready, he beats his master."
He stood, growling so loud that Sherlock took a step back, and before the detective could know what was happening, John grabbed him by the arse, pushed him up, and banged him to one of the bookshelves. He kissed him fiercely, nibbling his lips, making Sherlock whine, his mouth leaving red marks along the detective's neck.
Until now, when Mycroft told him his agents found him, he didn't hesitate twice. He had a chance to bring him back home, as he should have done after the ambush.
Greg couldn't stop laughing.
John pulled the duvet down a little, so he could look at Sherlock’s face. He enjoyed contemplating Sherlock while he was sleeping, his face relaxed, his lips softly muttering words in his sleep, or slightly parted while breathing.
“Ten? It’s not possible. There were only four victims.”
"Me? Drinking"
Anthea laughed willingly.
John stood up, raising Rosie with one arm, the girl hanging around his neck, her face pressed against his shoulder, holding him tightly. The doctor looked at the dominatrix.
They remained silent for a bit until John noticed the detective's mood began to fall under the weight of memories.
He remained silent for a while. He then talked in a whisper.
“Do you know what happens when you give sugar to children?”
Sitting in front of the journalists and feeling completely stupid, Lestrade regretted had listened to his team when they asked him not to involve Sherlock in the case, assuring that they could solve it with the same efficiency as the tall and pale detective. A month later, he had four victims at the morgue, press pressuring him and his superiors yelling him at the phone the whole day.
It had been a long and strenuous two-weeks case, and John missed several days at work during it. Two days later, John took a twenty-four-hours shift and returned home at ten o'clock in the morning, longing to go to bed, just as Sherlock was getting ready to leave to Scotland Yard to help the DI with another case.
"It's none of your business."
"It was audio editing. I… I was…wanking, "affirmed Sherlock, "and I did it to… well, creating the mood".
"Sherlock Holmes," he took out a credit card and gave it to the receptionist.
Then, he opened his mouth and gave off a guttural grunt that reverberated down his throat. A few minutes later, the big male reappeared from the forest and imitated the sound, making the female fallow deer and their babies to slowly left the children and join him in the woods, slowly disappearing from the sight of children. Rowan waved his hand, saying good-bye to them, and the kids imitated him, as well as Sherlock. Once they were out of his sight, Rosie and her friends burst into screams of joy, excitedly commenting all that happened since they left the camp in the night. Sherlock ran to them and hugged Rosie so hard the girl barely could breathe.
John woke up on a settee in the hotel lobby next door. A kind looking lady was staring down at him. "There we are! How are you feeling, Dr. Watson?" she was plastering his hand - had he cut it, somehow? And then taking his pulse, "back into normal ranges, I see. Glad of that! I think you had an attack back there. Stress induced. Are you feeling okay now?" She was looking at his eyes for dilation levels, waiting - he realized - rather anxiously to see how verbose he would be. How lucid. Ah. He might have had a stroke for all she knows? Better put her mind to rest then ...
I couldn’t be happier. These past few weeks have been the most fulfilling of my life. Knowing that you two are both safe, and sound, and whole, and
their first meeting.
He was to pretend his phone wasn’t working.
John nodded. Shrugged.

home.
Not early. Not late.
He was home.
When someone wrote to 221b, asking the detective to help them find a way to explain their bad decision to their family - to protect themselves from the onslaught of public opinion and personal duress - John had thrown the letter away. Mostly unread. He had no solutions for
“Intuitions are not to be ignored, Mike. They represent data processed far too fast for the conscious mind to comprehend. What we call 'Love at first sight' is simply a complex series of calculations our brain has processed based on the chemical, auditory, visual, and olfactory senses it has taken in. All dissected by our subconscious mind and tallied as a good fit
They were both a little breathless. Panting.
He did it anyways.
Like an axis had been shifted. And true north at last found.
Even if it meant nothing to Sherlock. It meant something to him.
"That's enough to be going on, don't you think?" He nudged. As if to say, ‘

She peeked at his notes. What do we have so far?
It also clearly solidified two things;
John covered his face with the crook of his arm and tried to keep himself silent as he let it all out.
As he passed; a great disappointment -
Then again,
John was still silent but his eyes were glinting now that he was closer and Sherlock could really
Always a step behind.
Waiting.
As the wedding drew near,
The world opened its eyes.
It sent a tsunami of thoughts and emotions down John's spine to hear it again.
There was no point in telling her

Liquid courage extended to visual tethering as well, it appeared … but he didn’t know how to end that statement? Question? Betrayal?
"Oh - here? Use mine?"
He at least, felt happy to get THAT off his chest, and promptly stomped his way back out of the restaurant and into the waiting night. Reputation intact.
I wish the air might catch you here
betrayal!!! … How John had rolled with laughter!” Her eyes were smiling now, and it did Sherlock a world of good to see it.
A mop of curls in a tight white suit brushed past John just as he was thanking the now empty counter. At least the man had checked for him?
Sherlock’s intake of breath, and pained eyes, told John everything he needed to know.

He could get lost in them
John leant against the wall. Accepting its roughness through his thin shirt as a ground to reality. Holding his wet jacket in the other hand - crumpled - and not caring in the slightest.
Though one more look at John, and he immediately found Mike would have to wait. His mind was preoccupied with a very different desire to kiss right now ...
He shook his head.

John then looked over at Mike, confused.
It couldn’t be. He shook his head.
Did that mean that he knew what John wanted? Had wanted? … Still wanted?
She winked at him. Acknowledging his request.
John nodded. Resigned. The wind was picking up and making the boat seem like a good idea, in either case.
Had Sherlock Holmes actually just
And then
John was here.
"Glad of it," she was saying, gathering up her things to go, "just you take it easy Dr. Watson? Perfectly understandable. You've been through a lot. Get some rest tonight." She was up and off without a name or a handshake. John didn't mind. He wanted to crawl into a hole.
"Again?" Sherlock asked. A small smile playing on his face now.
Things we thought lost in the fire of S4 - may not be the end of these two! (You know who we mean)
And then ... his tongue slipped out, and he licked John's palm. Watching John shiver with pleasure. John could almost see the wheels turning. The thought of, '
Sherlock nodded then. Relieved. Resting his head atop John’s.
The man sat up straight. Kicking his shoes back and relieving John by redistributing his weight firmly across all
He was still focused on Sherlock.
Everything he had built it upon ... crumbling.
John realized. That John

Haha, where r u?’
Didn’t he?
“I had you monitored closely, for obvious reasons … after the fall. At about thirteen months in, they dropped all of their surveillance efforts …  Your grief was … convincing.” Sherlock winced at the words as they came out, as if visibly pained by the admission. And yet the fact remained …
John took Sherlock's proffered hand and gripped tightly to it as he lifted him back to his feet.

Meanwhile John was standing there, arm outstretched. Looking rather self-conscious as Sherlock approached and loomed over him to accept the device.
Sherlock sat in stupefied silence,

Mike patted him on the back roughly. Gruffing away a bit of something stuck in his throat ... making another apology;

Sherlock released a breath, the shock of the pair of them. Both knew?
Misguided.
John could go home now.
John sat up in bed. He

He had popped in here once with Sherlock.

Sherlock smiled a sad, half-smile at that remark, and looked up at her now. Trying to give her his full attention.
And Sherlock could not wait to witness it.
and found it had died overnight.

Coffee was followed up with a light dessert. Again arriving before John could open his mouth to ask for the menu. A lovely tiramisu that tasted sinful and made him really wish he was here with a date. At that, he felt the misgivings in his mind as a certain ghost rewarded him with remarks:
"I'll drop him off at The Landmark after we've processed this lot, and taken a full statement. Might be a bit," he said to John, apologetically.
John was offering, immediately.
Marriage changes you. As a person. But there is no reason to say that the change can’t be welcome. Healthy even. Everything living grows. Everything living changes.
lost the reference page for this. Sherlock is Lit series. Probably Jane Eyre or something ... haha.
He felt high.
"Sorry. It's in my coat," Mike shammed, perfectly.
Sherlock nodded as if he had him there. Grinning at the way John could read him.

But this?
He held the cup in his hands,
pair. No one would blink twice at their being seen together. No one would hint that the other had married up - or must have a 'winning personality'.
John grinned from ear to ear. Seeing the softness in Sherlock’s eyes before him … such openness to ask for such a silly thing, had cost him dearly … he could tell. And he had never heard anything so beautiful in his whole damn life.
Sherlock looked up then. A bit of the old light back in his eyes as he silently praised John for being so astute …   He was sizing John up. And perhaps calculating the risk as well.

John's eyes widened in dawning realization, of what he was saying. Confirming?!
And he pulled the bow across the strings

Their thighs were pressed together hip to knee, one leg threatening to overlap his own, but holding back, for some reason. And his hands, Sherlock’s beautiful hands were hovering around John's waist tentatively, as if unsure what to do …

There could not have been two spoonfuls of sugar in this, or else the hospital cafeteria was burning a worse than usual brand of dark roast.

John's feet ached in a good way. His hands on his knees as he caught his breath. The alley chase was like something out of a daydream ... not something he had ever expected to have the pleasure of again.

Serbia and Italy had been a cake walk compared to this.
Adjusted his scarf;
John was in awe.
Sherlock seemed genuinely surprised by John’s admission. And looked up at John as if he had given him much more than this battered old flip phone with a cracked screen.
John still did not turn. Except to try to face even further away. He picked up the bag of tea and unwrapped it. Picking at it. Tearing it open. He fumbled, and dropped the tea bag between his feet.
John stopped in his tracks. Glaring at Mike.
John swallowed the lump in his throat. There were some things he had liked about that Sherlock. No mask. No lies. No hiding. He had come out into the light. And said anything. Did anything. That came into his head.
Smiling as they took each other closer. Stepping into the warmth of each other’s arms and hungrily taking their fill. Hands reached up, feeling their way into Sherlock's curls. Tugging gently. Sherlock's own wandered into John's robe, brushing his hands across his smooth chest and ribcage and into his soft tee ...

He’d finish the second part of that question easily! “Oh, I don’t know! Why did you go after Moriarty without me? Without including me in the plan? Huh?! … Let’s see …  Why did you lie to me, to get me away from Bart’s??! WHY DID YOU BLOODY JUMP OFF A FUCKING ROOF IN FRONT OF MY EYES??!!” he was wagging his finger in Sherlock’s face. His angry grin plastered to breaking point on his cheeks, eyes glinting hard, “I liked that trick, especially! For me was it? Hmmm??! Nice. Very nice trick, Sherlock - very expertly EXECUTED … “ John was livid! The fucking gall of the man … to ask HIM to … “No! Sherlock! You don’t GET to ask the questions. Not anymore ... we’re not
"She's four years old."
However, there was a time when that alleyway became almost his home, and its inhabitants were practically his family. Until he met Lestrade, and the DI helped him to put it all behind him.
It was now or never.
He shrugged nervously. Mycroft smiled fondly and squared his jacket over his shoulders.
Sherlock, all rage, fury, and adrenaline, took a few tenths of a second to realize he ran out of ammunition. He threw the guns down and ran into the cabin.
The detective breathed in sharply, undoubtedly fighting the urge to explain it.
"This is for driving me mad all these years," Greg teased as John, a bit recovered from his powerful orgasm, stood and went to the nightstand table, opened a drawer, and rummaged from something inside it.
John blinked as he heard those words in his head. It was the first time he had allowed himself to say it openly. Before, he had always drowned out the thought before formulating it. But somehow the soft, shy touch of Sherlock's lips broke down his defenses.
“They rose from the dissection tables,” she panted. “They were DEAD. How could they move?”
"Told you. Murder".
He couldn't do that to John, not again, not on his wedding day. He rolled until he laid on his side, sobbing quietly, the weight of grief barely allowing him to breathe.
"The team will be here shortly," she announced.
The sentence Sherlock wrote and the therapist had in his office is from the writer Mehmet Murat Ildan.
"Brilliant," mused John, and the others chuckled as they watched Sherlock and Tony swell up like a turkey.
The doctor started coughing, and Sherlock stood up.
Sherlock was effectively about to do it but refrained himself. Instead, he ate his bad mood altogether with the pasta. Once he cleared his plate, he stood and walked away from the camp, disappearing in the darkness.
"Are you two smoking?"
When John recovered himself from his intense orgasm, he took one of Sherlock's nipple in his mouth, his tongue rolls over the nub, smiling at the way Sherlock arched his back, his hips bucking, as the doctor gripped the detective's glorious arse, squeezing the cheeks. John nipped at his nipple lightly before releasing it. He blew against it, smirking again, and Sherlock's breath hitched sharply, galloping rapidly towards the impossible orgasm. John noticed he was about to come, separated his mouth from Sherlock, who whined pitifully.
"Mr. Holmes is not here."
Once they unbuttoned their shirts, they slowly let the jackets fall over the other's shoulders, slipping down to the floor, and then they did the same with the shirts
"And how is this possible? I mean, time cannot be compartmentalized", Everett frowned. He looked at Strange shyly and lowered his gaze.
The sound of a distant bark reached them and, barely audible, a rumour they couldn’t define.
"John" alerted Lestrade, taking him out of his thoughts pointing to one of the plane's screens, where several TV announced a special statement related with a government member.
Sherlock nodded desperately. "Please let me come; I need to come, please, please, please," he almost sobbed. His tone told John he was close to his breaking point.
The doctor dipped his hand in the flour and spread it on the table, from left to right, sprinkling the detective in his wake.
“You’ll do, I promise.”
Setting the camp together was another game, since the tents provided by the school were pop-up models, so they only had to throw them in the air. Even Sherlock seemed to enjoy it, and John loved to see his husband running from group to group, helping the children to fix the tents to the ground, his cheeks blushing from the effort, the excitement, and the fresh air.
Even deducing John gave no interest in their blatant attempts to flirt with him, nor was he attracted to any of them, Sherlock could not help but wish with all his strength that they burned themselves out under the sun and disintegrate.
“Because you haven’t answered me yet.”
“When we came here," started Sherlock, hesitantly," I wasn't sure how coming here would affect me, the memories it would bring but... is like… facing it with you and Rosie by my side made it less painful".
"I told you not to read it until I was dead" he finally achieved to hiss between clenched teeth, blushing furiously.
"The two people connected by the red thread are destined lovers, regardless of place, time, or circumstances. The red string might get tangled or stretched, but it can never break".
They walked behind the assistant who took them to the airport's VIP area, safe from the onlookers' glances. None of them broke formation as they headed for the small hangar where Mycroft's private plane was waiting for them.
"Major, this is DI Lestrade."
"We have to go back."
"My husband built it to hide the black money from the drug," explained Mrs Hudson, "I searched the entire floor for months without finding it. The same day Sherlock came to see it, a couple of days before meeting John and moving here, he found it and gave the money it to me. At first, he used it to hid drugs, but soon he stopped. With John, he didn't need them." She shook his head, sad. "It was when John got married Mary and left Baker Street that he started using it again to hide them".
John bent down and kissed Sherlock tightly., taking his cock slowly from Sherlock and inching it inside again, as Sherlock moaned in Johns's lips, his cock getting hard again with the slow fucking.
The doctor waited until he remained still. He pulled the detective's wet fringe from his forehead and kissed him gently.
He bent over to kiss Rosie on the cheek and walked out of the room onto the terrace. Sherlock wasn't there.
Greg pushed him into the white Rolls-Royce Phantom Mycroft chose for the wedding. If Sherlock wanted to be as inconspicuous as possible at the church's arrival, his brother achieved the opposite.
Before Sherlock could respond, a tall, somewhat chubby woman in her sixties appeared at the door and threw herself into the detective's arms in a burst of excitement.
“Chinese? We can take away and have dinner at my hotel.”
"Save Rosie and John" mouthed Sherlock before Mycroft disappeared in the car, along with the rest of the men.
“No, we don’t. We are going to show our daughter how
"Give him a blanket, he is in shock," Molly said in a mocked tone.
He took the little white box out of his backpack and put it on Sherlock's coat pocket. His werewolf's nature allowed him to beat Moriarty's spell on himself.
They went slowly down the hill, crouching behind the little bushes, watching for any movement. They went down to the foot of the building and entered it. Apart from mats on the floor and dusty cups, they found nothing else.
"Since Stephen can't create the portal, we could do it artificially, I mean, without magic or time control."
Sherlock got up from the chair.
Sherlock threw his head back as much as the bookshelf allowed him, his mouth wide open though no sound came out of it, gasping for air, feeling so delightfully full.
'Don't you dare.'
John burst out laughing.
Thanks for your kudos and comments! They are really appreciated.
"Make the call."
"John!' protested Sherlock as John laughed, amused to contemplate his whitened curly hair and the flour on his blue dressing gown.
He shook his head, incredulous.
"I don't know how to shoot, but I want to help," she said.
"That's what we're going to find out," said Natasha. "Can you recreate it?" she asked Stephen.
Sherlock took out his shoes and walked to the shore, plunging in the sea until the water reached his ankles. John and Rosie mimicked him. He frowned a bit, closed his eyes, and slipped into the last room created in his Mind Palace, where he kept his childhood memories that reappeared after his meeting with Eurus. Most of them were in brown, grey colors, scrambled, and scattered thrown on the floor. Others, arranged, were turning into more bright colors.
"Or better, I should sink your head in the sand, tie your hands tied behind your back and let you here, letting those who were devouring you with their eyes fuck you."
"New age nonsense," snarled Tony.
"Where did you get the cab?" she asked, shocked.
They looked sideways at Peter, who frowned, watching them and trying to keep a low profile.
Lestrade knew she was right. If they weren’t able to stop the detective, he would kill a man in front of more than ten Scotland Yard officers.
"Ok, but don't go again."
"You're wrong, detective. Money is always the problem."
He watched Mycroft. The elder Holmes regained his proud air. He ended his tie, stretched out his shirt cuffs, and waited patiently on his feet, hands on the lectern, to be given way, as if Clay were to announce the Christmas campaign instead of going to destroy him, along with Sherlock. Because, after that, the Holmes would be history.
The Avengers met Mycroft. Sherlock, Stephen, Tony, Steve and Natasha go back to John's wedding day.
"For not letting me fuck you before... you know how wonderful your arse is? God, I could come right now..."
"When Sherlock called me from Sherrinford and told me that…. he loved me... It was harrowing for me to hear it, most knowing he and John were… starting his relationship, something that obviously Eurus ignored. But, somehow, hear him saying what I have been waiting to hear from him for so long…, even knowing he loved John and wasn't real …, somehow it set me free, like if a spell was broken. It's mad, I know, but…, and then I fell in love with Irene" she smiled, blushing.
"Did you bring a shoulder infiltration?"
"But... what about Merlin?"
“On behalf of all of us, I wanted to thank you for our best camp ever. John, you were fun, made us laugh a lot and we truly enjoyed being captains. Sherlock, at first we thought you didn’t like us, you were weird, grumpy and elu..., elu...sive. But when you were alone with us, you started being funny also, you fought the bad guys and took us to see the fallow deer”.
"He probably will be dissecting some disgusting body part," supported Dimmock.
"In a few days I will let you destroy it," promised the doctor.
John wrote one of the dedications so many times repeated. The readers would kept it as a relic, but for him they were only empty words. At first it was not so. Before being famous, he put his heart in every book he dedicated. But that night, after more than two hours chatting with readers, signing and listening to the same stories, he felt himself incapable to do it. He smiled at the man and handed him the book. Lestrade did not move. John looked at him, questioningly.
Mrs. Hudson nodded.
Someone cut the rope that held his ankles, and he fell to the ground with a dry thud. John, still dizzy from the lack of oxygen, clenched his teeth to drown out a groan. After so many hours with his hands tied behind his back, the pain in his shoulder was almost unbearable. But he could not suppress a cry of pain, when one of his captors grabbed him, forcing him to move. He staggered about to lose consciousness from the pain in his shoulder. He felt untied and reattached to the pole. John was on his knees again, physically and mentally exhausted, his wet clothes clinging to his body, his head swirling with thoughts. He threw his head back, banging on the pole.
“Nooooooo, Daddy! Friends’ camp!” She looked at her parents, exasperated.
Lestrade chuckled sadly. The Holmes and their defense mechanisms.
Still angry, Sally nodded. She liked Anthea asked her to be part of the group.
"Don't worry. We are here to help you. Are you all right?"
They both laughed.
"Okay, your parents are going to let you adopt a puppy, right?" Rosie nodded, excited. She was looking forward to her birthday to do it. "So imagine you go to the kennel and you find the dog you've always wished: handsome, intelligent, sexy..."
Angrily, he took his laptop and traced Sherlock's phone. He wrote down the address, and soon, the motorcade was again on its way, though. John's mood had become tempestuous, which didn't go unnoticed for Lestrade, who shared a cab with him and Mike.
Mycroft loosened his tie and popped the first button on his shirt, puzzled for the first time. Somehow, that woman climbed up on the pedestal from which he was looking at the world.
"Whenever you're ready, sir."
Sherlock smiled back and looked at Mycroft, standing alone, a bit apart from both couples.
"Martha, we don't want to bother you if you're busy..."
He stop talking and turned to look at Donovan, who approached them with a determined step.
Mycroft bit his lower lip.
"That is past. It's time for you to see yourself as you truly are".
They opened the door to the flat and stormed in. The flat was dark. Sherlock, aware he was being watched, had covered the windows with thick blankets, except for the strip where he was seen from the window.
So he decided to protect himself for suffering again, for losing again, even prohibited everyone from talking about Anthony. He was shattered. The only consolation he had left from all this was the knowledge that he had avenged Anthony's death. And now, seeing Clay, all those feelings exploded inside him, so intense that the pain became physical.
Rob and Patrick, uncomfortable wearing the ties, were pulling at their collars, which Mycroft immediately reproached. The rest seemed comfortable with their clothing, although they kept looking around to make sure they didn't rub against it, trying not to spoil the suits.
"Is something wrong with Mr. Holmes?" Peter whispered to John. The doctor turned and saw Sherlock sitting in a high chair, eyes closed, fingers stapled under his chin.
"Did he fire the cannon?" asked John, amazed.
"You shouldn't come with me. It could be dangerous."
"You already did," John mused faintly, drinking avidly. "I'm fine," he assured, trying to calm Sherlock down, to vanish his gesture of fury, rage, and despair that only came when someone dared to hurt John.
They both stopped. Greg scratched his crown.
"I won!" she shouted in excitement, jumping under the canopy. "Wow! It's huge!
"I… I don't know what to say. I never thought anyone would be happy because I was born".
"About the wedding."
John pulled his cock out of his mouth, causing a strangled pathetic "no" from him.
He went to the kitchen to organize the food and felt Sherlock’s arms embracing him.
The man emerged from the shed, a great piece of cheese in one hand and a gun in the other, which Sherlock recognized as the ones used by the prison officers in the High-security prisons. The fugitive looked around, searching for his mates, and, angry, called the other one.
"And I will choose the bridesmaid dresses."
"Did you change your mind?"
Sherlock simply hummed. He hadn’t been so exhausted in his whole life.
(Henry V – Act 5, Scene 2)
(See the end of the chapter for
"He would panic and insult the guests, shoot the flowers, or whatever similar."
An agonic yell of pain echoed through the castle, and then other, and other.
Greg lowered his head and didn't say anything, regretful. It was all his fault. How could he have slipped out of his mouth like that? When John came into the bar, he had no intention of telling him anything. He just needed the company of a good friend to have a couple of drinks, criticize Mycroft and wait for the anger to dissipate to decide what to do. How could he have been such a big blabbermouth?
. But, somehow, it sounded like a lie to him.
"But I didn't count on meeting Sherlock either," he smiled, and the others chuckled.
"WHAT?" the elder Holmes' roar echoed across the square, "but how could anyone possibly have detected it? And flight control?" New incredulous silence. "Why do we have a Secret Service? Why is everyone so incredibly incompetent?!!!!" he yelled.
"There's another code, then."
“Your appointment with Mr. Watson. He hates waiting.”
There was a maddening laugh from Clay. The bastard was enjoying it all. He heard Lestrade grunting something and the sound of a loud punch with a muffled groan from Clay and a new laugh.
"I'm sorry..."
"Let's go. We won't be able to hold them for long," urged Stephen with an echo, as his versions folded back on themselves.
"I don't know if, in this case, it's grounds for celebration."
"Yes, chasing an impossible love instead of looking at my true feelings. I was too afraid to be sincere with myself. Until I met Irene".
"Because you were never scolded. As you were littler than me..." Mycroft replied in a sappy tone
"Doctor Watson!" cried Peter.
"Mrs. Hudson was right; you are a reptile," snarled Sherlock, panting, sitting astride his brother again.
Sherlock ignored Tommy and focused again on his phone, hoping the kid left him alone. But, an instant later, he had the five C Captains in front of him, and the rest of the kids’ eyes fixed on him.
But, above all, because, at the beach, he turned to the most jealous consulting detective in the world.
(King Lear – Act 1, scene 1)
John sighed.
He wanted to scream, to cry, to curse, to smash that bloody place. Instead of it, he remained silent, almost motionless, forcing his brain to keep working, searching, analyzing, trying to beat a fear that strangled his heart, leaving him breathless.
. Believe it or not, it exists. Each word is accompanied by a page number, line number, and word number. I hid it in Anthea's house while she was at work, and told her where to find it in the papers you found."
Sherlock could see the gambler debating with himself internally. He surely needed the many for paying his debts, but he wanted to live. Sherlock pressed harder the barrel against his head.
John bowed his head, menacingly.
Sherlock hid his face in his hands, shaking his head.
The title attracted Rosie's attention.
"Someone is trying to communicate through the private line," warned FRIDAY, suddenly, cutting Bruce.
"They were always taken before you arrived. They were afraid you could realize they were watching him. I got scared, I didn't know what to do, what they wanted, so..."
"No…" started the receptionist and closed her mouth, not knowing how to deal with that stubborn woman.
"Who are they?"
He walked up to Everett and unlocked his handcuffs. With a quick movement, he grabbed the gun the detective had left on the table upside down and pointed it at his head.
“Come on, Mycroft, don’t spoil the moment” berated Donovan, flushing when the British Government turned to frown at her.
The detective shook his head. Then nodded and shook it again.
"It's strange. I don't remember a lot of the things Bart y Geena said about me while being a child, but, somehow, they echo inside me. They are familiar and unknown at the same time, and it's a bit bewildering".
“Mr.”
"Don't you dare compare your life with our daughter's, you fucking piece of shit" he growled murderously and Clay, on the other side of the phone, instinctively took a step backwards.
“No.”
John looked at him, frowning.
"That we could go, but not come back if the portal closed. We would be trapped in that universe forever. Even worse, if the opening were to fall apart as we crossed it, it would tear us to pieces, and I assure you it would not be an enjoyable death.
"It will be just one week. We will talk every day, you, me, and Rosie. I know the terrain. I'm going with my old army buddies." He took Sherlock's chin and raised his face. "It's going to be all right. Before you know it, I'll be back."
John giggled, rubbing his eyes, tired.
"So does he, with the Sling Ring. I'm going to ask Clint!" he shouted, running off to find the archer.
Both vehicles stopped a few feet away from them. The drivers, two Pashtun men, got out and approached Sherlock.
But what got him completely mad was the feeling of the detective's throat in his glans every time he got as deep as the detective could manage, all mixed with the vibrations transmitted by Sherlock's moans, whines, and groans of pleasure, increased when John rolled his hips or changed his pace, making him contorting with lust and suck him even deeper. Greg cried in delight with the low vibrations that run across his shaft until his balls, panting and melting in Sherlock's mouth, his own orgasm building quicker than he wished.
Rosie looked at her questioningly. The old woman laughed.
“Nooooooooooooo”
"You're going to bring them home as Mrs. Hudson asked us. Let's go".
"I had forgotten what this fucking hell is," Pete grumbled, setting foot on the dry, rocky, and dusty ground of Kandahar; the rest grunted to prove their agreement.
"Take me with you," asked Bill.
She closed her eyes, about to cry with relief, pressed the button, and waited to open the door until she saw the driver through the peephole. He was wearing a large cap, and a big scarf almost covered his face, probably due to a bad cold, since he was coughing hard.
“Hey,” he said softly, sitting at his side and giving him a caring tap with his shoulder.
"Nobody loved me that way before. Nobody. Nor my parents, not any of my former girlfriends of boyfriends" he gazed at Mike "Nobody." he repeated. "Thanks to the love he brings me, I healed inside. And found the reason to change, to try to be better. I stopped drinking, and I started going to therapy to manage my anger, my aggressiveness, and all the shit I kept inside me. I'm still on it" he smiled sadly "Listen to me. I am even able to express my feelings now, though it keeps being hard".
"How's the kid?" asked Mike.
"A chimera. They know we are here,' replied Stephen, looking at the body lying on the ground, a creature with a body formed by various bits of a lion, a goat, and a serpent.
Sherlock groaned.
A minute later, Rosie appeared, wrapped in a blue sterile surgical gown so long that it reached her feet. The sleeves had been folded several times to fit her little arms and ended up in hands wrapped in sterile gloves. She was also wearing a high protection mask with a filter that covered all the lower part of her face and a surgery cap decorated with different colored flowers.
Without warning, John placed his hands on Sherlock's head, pushing him over his cock so that Sherlock had to take almost the entire length into his mouth. He jerked his hips up quickly, and Sherlock gagged, a bit surprised by the sudden movement. He swallowed a couple of times, breathing deeply through his nose until he could control his gag reflex, as John taught him.
"Not as much as with you," both chuckled.
Anderson twisted his head furiously.
"You have ten minutes."
“I…” the only consulting detective in the world, looked for a convincing excuse to avoid to go to the ramble.
"God, I love the Avengers."
John grabbed Greg's hair and fucked hard the DI's mouth, who moaned, gagged, and choked, feeling John's cock deep in his throat, lost in the sensation of being fucked by John's cock, of being used by him. Finally, with an animalistic groan, the doctor came on Greg's mouth, his copious cum oozing from the corners of Greg's lips as the DI tried to swallow as much as he could, sucking hard John's cock until the doctor grunted and took it out from his mouth, and leaned on the table, gasping for air, his cock still hard.
He looked at her with complete bewilderment.
"Bastard," moaned the doctor.
Lestrade backed off a bit, breaking the kiss. Mycroft blinked, embarrassed.
Molly spotted Lady Smallwood approaching them in a fast-paced through the corridor and slapped her forehead loudly.
They heard the girl trotting down the hall until she appeared in the camera. Molly gave her the phone.
"Everything. Spoil it. Failing, not being enough."
"Selling is a repulsive word. I prefer transaction or exchange."
Sat in front of him, there was a man, wearing a blue robe and a red cloak with a strange medallion hanging from his neck.
This time John found it curious. Usually, his visions of Sherlock were static, and he rarely smiled. But he assumed that, in his subconscious, he knew that the detective was grateful to him for coming to his defense, even though it was too late.
He knew the man pointing him would relax the pressure of the gun in his head if he thought Mycroft was scared. When it happened, with one swift movement, Mycroft spun on himself, grabbed off the hand holding the gun, twisting the man's arm as he elbowed him hard in the stomach, while, with a quick and robust stroke, he broke the man's arm. He howled in pain, and Mycroft grabbed the gun. Panting, he held it firmly and pointed it at a surprised Clay.
The DI jumped when he felt John's other hand closing around his cock, but soon he lost himself in the pleasure of being stroked by his calloused hand. His cock was already leaking, and John stroked him fast and hard, rubbing his thumb over the head of Greg's cock to catch the drops of precome and sliding his hand back to the base of the shaft, stroking him up and down.
But you know the Holmes. He deduced something was wrong and left after in search of his fiancé. He found him in an alleyway, dying. Clay shot him when Anthony threatened to expose him. Anthony died in Mycroft's arms, waiting for the ambulance. Broken, Mycroft found Clay and killed him. Sherlock managed to survive after a month and a half in the ICU".
"You can get in line."
"Who was the long-suffering teacher? Mycroft?"
"Come by any day at three o'clock in the morning." smiled John.
“How did you find my cottage?”
Suddenly the doctor started slamming into the detective at a brutal pace, making Sherlock howl out with pleasure every time John’s cock hit .his prostate, the doctor thrusting even harder, hitting Sherlock prostate again and again. The detective’s howls reached new levels when John started stroking his cock, grabbing it firmly, at the same pace as his trusts, making Sherlock’s eyes roll back, his mouth open, losing in the drowning pleasure of John’s tireless and relentless cock,
"It's been a long time coming, John. I'm not the man you knew anymore".
But, contrary to what he always feared, with Lestrade, the pain and the guilt did not destroy him, the sadness did not devour him. Instead, the gentle touch of Lestrade's hand, the firmness and softness with which he held his hand, his soft loving tone, helped him to cope with all that pain. Surprisingly for him, he felt relieved talking about it, finally being able to let Anthony go.
“I haven't asked you, archivist.”
"Two things. One, you hate legwork. Two, you forgot the letter?"
"Can you imagine Sherlock if he arrives, and I'm not there?"
"You're not going to leave me alone, are you?"
Sherlock covered his mouth with his hand and surrounded the dolmen, calling Rosie out loud, but he obtained no response.
She smiled.
He exploded, every inch of his body overflowing with pleasure, seeing the stars literally. The final screamed "oh John!" was so loud that el doctor was sure it had been heard it in London.
"Don't worry, we'll take care of him," shouted Bill Murray from the top of the flight deck, closing the plane's door.
The detective feared it woke up forgotten feelings towards any of them. Any of those men were much easier to bear than he, without his emotional rollercoasters, his traumas, his sulking, his...
"Who?" his brother asked.
"Admiring the views," answered Sherlock.
“Yes, but you don't look where you step.”
"Rosie was relieved to hear from you, but she knows perfectly we are hiding something."
He strongly inhaled the sea's smell, watching the sunshine over the sea. They had really been lucky with the weather. Sadly it was their last day there.
"We are the resistance!" shouted Molly excitedly, making the other three women laugh. "Credit is yours,' she pointed to the landlady, 'if you hadn't sat down, we would have been kicked out of there. Poor receptionist, I thought she was going to have a heart attack".
"We will go to Switzerland. Once there, Mycroft, Lestrade, and you," he pointed to the homeless, "will pick Mycroft's plane, so that his cronies will perfectly detect it in the secret service. It will take you to Lyon and then by car to the castle. We" he gestured to himself, John, Sholto and John's army mates "will get there undetected. I will explain the rest on the plane."
"Mummy, Mycroft is driving John crazy with the wedding," complained the detective as soon as he heard the receiver pick up the phone.
"Sherlock, I'm…. I'm going to..." he grunted, his orgasm getting near and near and... stopped before reaching the point of no return because the detective took his cock out of his mouth.
