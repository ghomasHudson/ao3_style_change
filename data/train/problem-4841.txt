But those days were becoming less frequent.  He had a lot of days now where he didn’t think of any of those things.  Now, he thought about drawing.  About gardening.  About grocery lists, and dinner plans, and the kids at the hospital where he volunteered, and the psychology classes he was taking at the junior college two towns over.  He thought about Natasha and Bruce coming up for the weekend, and Sam telling him about the pretty barista who wrote her number on his cup and the date they had on Friday.  He thought about Rhodey and the FWB thing he had going with Maria Hill, and Steve was pretty sure he wasn’t supposed to know about that, but Tony liked to talk, and they all knew it, so why would anybody tell him a secret they didn’t want everyone in their group to know about, huh?  He thought about Wanda and Bucky--
"Or maybe the simplest explanation is the correct one. He had pages of notes on Steve and his PTSD-related drug use.  He gave those to the local police. They arrested a drug-dealer in your town who says he might have dealt to 'a guy like that' when they questioned him."
Tony knew what he was looking at.  He stood there and looked at it himself a lot.  Sometimes, when he couldn’t sleep, he’d come down here and look at it for an hour or more, imagining Steve’s face, his hands, his eyes intently narrowed as he pencilled in those lines, shaded, used his finger to smudge the charcoal a little to produce the shadows under the Bentley.
Steve held him closer.  He had taken a lot of comfort from Tony, but he repaid it during moments like this.  Steve was thinner now, but no less warm, no less strong and protective, and for Tony, his arms meant safety.  His arms meant security.  His arms were the place where Tony felt most vulnerable, and yet they were also the place in which he felt the need to shower Steve with warmth and peace and gratitude of his own.  Was that the essence of true love?  That wanting to take and take, yet needing to give?  Greediness and generosity all rolled into one.  Tony had certainly  never felt anything like it with anyone else.  Never wanted to feel it with anyone else.  Never.
He kissed her cheek, and protested when she said she was going to go cook him a real meal. “We can just go out, Mom,” he said. “You don’t need to-”
Tony pictured him sitting at his desk, his tie loosened a little, wearing a white lab coat.  He was probably at home in the Sanctum in jeans and a hoodie, but the white coat image made it easier for Tony, so that’s what he went with.
He was standing near the front door, hands clasped loosely behind his back. Sarah sat on the arm of the couch. She was wearing sweats and one of Steve’s father’s old, faded t-shirts that she only wore to bed. It was huge on her, hanging down almost to her knees, but even in such casual attire, she still held herself with a dignified tilt to her head, her shoulders up and back, sitting like a queen on the arm of their ancient sofa like it was a throne. Her eyes were on Howard Stark, calmly assessing. At the sound of Tony’s voice, both turned their heads to look at him.
He turned and started out the door, but he only made it two steps before Tony was latching onto his arm.
Ross’ stay at The Raft wasn’t official, then.  His was to be an off-the-books imprisonment.  One that only a handful of people knew about.   Even without drugs being pumped into his system on a daily basis, a year in The Raft would be hell for a man like Ross.  Especially since he was being put into isolation.  Only two other men had stayed in that cell.  It was practically factory-sealed.  Just for him.
Beneath him, Tony felt Steve’s breath quicken. The sensation spurred him on, making him move faster, harder, lifting them both higher and higher, reveling in the sound of Steve purring his name again and again and again. Tony assaulted his shoulder with his mouth, sucking bruises on his skin, coloring him a dark purple that would fade in minutes, but while it was there, made that elemental part of Tony’s brain shout
Thad cleared his throat, folded his hands across his middle. His back was against the headboard, his legs outstretched and crossed at the ankle. In spite of his casual posture, he gave off the impression of a man fully in charge. “Steve,” he said evenly, “how long are we going to pretend this has nothing to do with that Stark you’ve been hanging around with?”
“I can get dressed,” she said, scrubbing her eyes with the hand holding the shark. They were still glassy with sleep. “I’m really fast.”
By the next morning, Tony knew what he had to do.  The fact that he had actually known about two minutes after Steve told him about the light, and he just suppressed it, pissed him off.  But he’d do it.  For Steve, he’d do it.
He took her to her next appointment with the oncologist, and they worked out a plan of attack. Surgery first, followed by several rounds of chemotherapy. The tumor was small--they had found it early, thank God--but it was best to get on it asap.
Sam tipped his bottle toward him in agreement.  “He always felt responsible.  For me, for Nat, for Wanda.  She looked up to him--we all did--but for her--”
Steve panted, his legs shaking, barely able to hold him up. Tony added a finger alongside his tongue, curling it just right, just enough to make Steve whimper and moan in a brazen way that made Tony’s lips curve against Steve’s skin.
Tony tossed his briefcase onto the couch and sat the flowers on the table. “Yeah. My last meeting got cancelled, so I just decided to come home.” He started across the room, and Steve retreated a step. He glanced at his easel, and reached down for the sheet that lay at his feet.
.  The trust and closeness that he and Tony had to have between them when they were in battle, had brought them closer than they would have ever been if they had just met on a street corner and struck up a conversation.  Didn't it? Would they still be the same now if they hadn't put themselves so completely in the other's hands in those life and death situations so often?
He got out of the car and stretched, his back popping. The birds were loud. The breeze through the leaves a soft murmuring like a lover’s sigh. It smelled like apple blossoms and wildflowers--like springtime--and Tony thought about bringing Morgan up sometime soon. What it would be like if the four of them came up together. Had a picnic lunch in the meadow. Dodger chasing Morgan around afterwards while Steve lay with his head on Tony’s stomach, watching the clouds drift across the sky.
Tony’s heart sped up now while Steve kissed him. He felt it thumping in his chest, in his pulse points, and he had a sudden, intense urge to climb up into Steve’s lap and just keep going. Damn the time, and damn the surroundings. He just wanted to press against Steve--his
He turned abruptly back toward the Tower.  Wanda would be in town by nine.  Shift change was at eleven.  Rounds right after.  By one, things should be settled and relatively quiet.
Tony sat on the bumper of the car.  In his head, he heard Howard squawk with anger, but he ignored it.  He was getting better at the ignoring part.  He reached out and took Steve’s hand.
Tony put his arm around Wanda’s shoulders.  “No way, Rogers.  We’ve got way too much to talk about.”
A powerful wave of homesickness for Jarvis rolled over Tony as he flipped the lights on in the garage.  Both for the man himself, and even for the AI version Tony had created.  He tried not to think about it too much, now with Vision gone, but having even a virtual Jarvis had been a real comfort to him over the years.  He missed hearing his voice.
Steve kissed him again. Softly. Gently. “But we always rushed that part, Tony. We had to. If we wanted it at all, we had to.”
The third time was a little different.  He changed his technique, going against the grain, a little slower, a little more careful, a little more thorough.
was waking up. In fact, he could barely believe that he had just spent the last ten minutes practically groping Steve Rogers, and making plans to do...something...with him later tonight. He leaned against the wall. His hand was shaking, threatening the rest of his coffee, but he couldn’t stop it.
And then there was the man himself.  He was asleep alone in the big bed, and while he was sleeping more on the right side, his hand was outstretched toward the left, reaching even in his sleep to where she would ordinarily be.
Steve looked down at his feet. He chewed his lip. He didn’t look up, even when Howard stood and stepped around the desk toward him. “I must admit,” Howard said, “you have grown into a fine-looking young man. You seem honest. Pleasant. You’re obviously hard-working.” He laughed a bit. “If I met you on the street for the first time, I would most likely not have any issue with you, at all. I might, in fact, have held you up as an example to my son.” He cocked his head in a way that reminded Steve forcefully of Tony, but instead of being endeared the way he was with Tony, the gesture left him cold. So very cold.
Tony turned on his side, pulled the blanket over his shoulder, and slept.  It was dreamless.  That was a relief.
Steve shifted in his seat, turning a little to look at Tony closely. Part of him wondered if Tony was making fun of him, but it was a small part. As much as he liked to tease, Tony wasn’t mean-spirited. He’d never take something Steve said and twist it to hurt him. “Really?” he asked seriously.
Steve didn’t make it easy.  He tightened his grip, pulling him closer.  Tony laughed under his breath.
Steve was being pulled away.  His hair fell over his forehead in a tumble.  Tony thought he had never looked more beautiful.  “It was worth it.”
Tony took full advantage, kissing, licking, sucking tiny bruises onto his skin, tasting the tantalizing flavor of his sweat.  "It's sexy on you too," he murmured. He let his hands roam over the chiseled planes of Steve's chest, his stomach. "My silver fox."
“‘Cause it means you don’t trust me.” And Steve’s voice said that hurt him more than anything. Tony hated himself in that moment.
He had, of course.  Dozens of times.  Hundreds.  But to Tony, it always felt like the first time.  "I don't think so."
Tony put his free hand high up on Steve’s chest. He dipped his finger into the notch at the base of his throat. “Try ‘Tony, will you stay?’” he said. “It would probably work.”
whatever Clint said and letting it go. He wasn’t. He knew he wasn’t. That wasn’t him. He wasn’t a jealous guy. Never had been.
“I didn’t mean that like it sounded,” Steve said.  He spoke slowly now, carefully, as if choosing his words with the greatest of care.  He still hadn’t raised his head, though.  He looked at his lap.  Tony longed to see his eyes.  They were exquisitely expressive and said the things his voice never would, but he was denied that for now.
He started out the door and Steve stopped him with a hand on his hip.  The touch was light but insistent, the meaning clear:
After dinner, he washed the dishes. It was a small chore. There weren’t very many dishes to wash. Someone had told him once he could save time by using paper plates and tossing them when he was done, but he didn’t do that. He had the time to wash. He had plenty of time. If there was one thing he had in the evenings, it was time. Plus, he didn’t like the idea of the waste. Or the loss of trees just so he didn’t have to spend ten minutes washing a discount-store plate.
“Nothing, really,” he muttered, and it was the truth.  Nothing had happened.  He’d stretched out in one of the two twin beds with the window open…
His employees were happy, and that made him happy. If that made him a fool, then at least he was a happy one.
tea with him.  This was better.  Touching him was better.  Kissing him was better.  Steve seemed to think so, too.  The tea hadn’t made him
“We’ll think of something,” Tony said, and there was a smooth promise to his voice that made Steve feel slightly weak in the knees. “Are you ready to go?”
Tony lifted his head and guided Steve’s mouth to his.  It was soft, sensual, sweet.  A perfect kiss.  A perfect moment.  “Think about that, okay?”
His eyes flared in sudden frustrated anger.  His fist was lightning quick, brutally hard, coming down on the arm of the chair with a crash.  “I hate this fucking thing!” he cried, his voice filled with savage fury.
Tony adjusted the cloth on her head. “You sure you’re okay? You’re looking a little peaked,” he said, and he heard Jarvis in his voice. That made him smile.
Steve fetched a deep sigh. In it, Tony could hear his frustration, his pain, his resolve. He wasn’t coming home. Tony heard that too. Steve wasn’t coming home. He seemed to hear a careless breaking sound then. His heart, falling to the floor. That's all it was. Just his heart shattering on the ground.
“Did you call me because he’s in the hospital?” Pepper asked as he walked her to her car.  Happy was still her driver/bodyguard, but she’d given him the afternoon off.  Word was, he had a lady-friend.  Pepper encouraged him.  Everyone deserved something good after what they’d been through.
Tony kissed him again, his tongue gentle and caressing.  “You’re not dreaming, baby,” he said.  “You’re here.  I don’t want you to think about that other place anymore.  That part’s over.  You’re here with me.
Steve looked down at Jack’s hand on his arm, and when he looked back up, Jack didn’t look away. He held Steve’s gaze frankly. He really did smell good. And he wasn’t bad looking. Seemed nice. And he was interested. He said so. Nobody said they were interested in the army. They couldn’t. And it had been a
Both men jolted.  Steve’s shoulders came up, snapping to attention, his jaw clenched, fire and fear burned in his blue eyes, darkening them.  At the same time, Tony’s fingers flexed, and he found himself on his feet, waiting for the suit to appear around him.  They locked eyes and Tony read his own thoughts on Steve’s face.
They hadn’t seen each other since that night. They had talked on the phone, and texted back and forth, but they’d both been too busy to get together, and Tony missed him. Missed his eyes, and his smile, and the way he quirked an eyebrow at him sometimes to punctuate a thought or a sentence. He missed him. He wanted him and he missed him.
And then he was in her arms, and she was clutching him close, and her breath was on his neck, her voice on his ear.  "He's okay," she said. "They said he's going to be okay."
Ross held it in his hand, looked at the chicken-scratch writing spelling out his name on the front, his return address, Steve’s name and address in the top left.  There was even a stamp on it.  Tony’s good, sweet, conscientious man had put it on the envelope himself that morning, marveling at the fact that he didn’t have to lick it to make it stick.
He knew he was being a hypocrite.  He’d stayed out until almost midnight only a few days ago, but he couldn’t help it.  Steve could stay out late if he wanted, but he had to say something.  He had to tell Tony
Pepper nodded almost imperceptibly, laid her cool hand against his cheek, then called, “Stephen?  Will you come here, please?”
Tony knew he shouldn’t, knew they were skating on thin ice now, but he could not resist another kiss. He couldn’t resist feeling Steve’s mouth on his one more time. “I’m so proud of you, baby.” Steve ducked his head, smiling a little. Tony had never called him that before today. It felt good coming out of his mouth, though. It felt right. Tony sighed, contented and happy. He flicked his hand at his books. “Do you still want to study?”
Tony looked around warily in the headlights’ glow.  Everything seemed to have taken a subtle, stealthy step, throwing the entire house off-kilter.  “Steve?” he said, and took a step into the living room.  The headlights only penetrated so far.  After a few steps, the entire cabin was lost in an abyss of shadows.
Steve found himself smiling back. He knew this was messed up. He knew. He just couldn’t seem to help it. “And it’s Steve.”
Steve shook his head without lifting it from Tony’s shoulder. “No,” he said. “It’s you, Tony. It’s all you. You’re everything.”
He knew he sounded stupid. He could hear it in his own ears, but Tony didn’t laugh at him. Didn’t even crack a smile. His face stayed serious. “Do you want to go for a ride?” he said, and his voice was serious too. As if he was asking Steve for something life-altering. Like a kidney. Or for the rest of his life.
They both turned expectant eyes on Bruce.  He looked skeptical, almost uncomfortable in spite of the soft woman in his lap.
Strange stepped toward him.  “Captain, no.  You can’t.  You’re right in the middle of your treatment.  You can’t leave.”
Tony kissed him again, and pulled him into a tight hug so he could whisper into his ear. “Baby, please don’t worry about that, okay? I love you. I want you with me. If it would make you more comfortable to move somewhere cheaper, then we can, but I don’t want money to be the reason that we don’t get to be together. Okay? I don’t want that outside stuff to affect us. ‘Cause it doesn’t matter. Not really. Does it? When you really think about it, does it matter if we live here, or in Brooklyn, or out in Queens or whatever? What matters is us. You and me. That’s what matters to me. That’s
Steve settled himself on the old black leather sofa against the wall. He spread his books on the coffee table, and situated his laptop directly in front of himself. He sat a couple of notebooks right next to the laptop, and laid three sharpened pencils on top of them. It had the air of ritual, and Tony, who stood watching, knew that was exactly what it was. Steve had always had his rituals. Going back to his Captain America days. They all had back then. Seeing Steve setting up his work station with such solemnity and formality tugged at Tony’s heart in a way nothing else did. Not that he wanted to go back to those days--he was happier now living this quiet life with Steve than he had ever thought he would be capable of--but the nostalgia was intense. The memories that nostalgia brought back, even more so.
Thoughts of Natasha flooded his mind as he walked.  Battle-bloodied and bruised, dancing in a red dress and slinky heels, lying in his bed in his old green Army t-shirt, kicking his ass in the gym.  She’d believed in him, held him, helped him, tethered him, and given him wings to fly.  Other than Bucky and Tony, she was the one person he had ever truly claimed as his own.  She was his.  She’d always be his.  A part of him.  Another piece of the puzzle that was Steve Rogers’ heart.  And Bruce was waiting for her, and Steve would give her willingly and happily, but he would never let her go.  Not completely.  Never completely.
Tony laid hold of the handles again and pushed the chair down the path that led to the dock.  Long grasses whickered against his jeans, against the chair’s wheels.  Across the lake, one lone boat bobbed on the water, a solitary fisherman.  In July, there’d be speed boats and jet-skis and kids playing grab-ass on the beach.  Not here, this was private, but near here, near enough to see and hear.  Far enough so that they wouldn’t be disturbed, but close enough so that they wouldn’t feel isolated either.
The tape sat on the little table next to the punching bags.  Steve grabbed it and began winding it over his knuckles.  As he did, he thought of the feeling that had slammed up his arm when he touched Stormbreaker.  In a way, it had been very much like the feeling he’d had when Tony had bandaged his hands so long ago.  Raw, powerful, hungry.  He remembered wondering what it would have been like if he had slid his arm around Tony and kissed him.  He wondered now if he had gripped the handle of the axe, would he have been able to lift it?
“And I’m calling bullshit,” Tony flared back. “I mean, look at you!” He threw his hand out to where Steve stood in the water, that cool, clear water that Tony had been looking so forward to enjoying himself, and now couldn’t because Captain Stubborn had decided to be here in all his hot, beautiful, bare-chested glory--and by
,” he muttered, and pressed his mouth to Steve’s shoulder blade again. He kept it there while he breathed his way back down, letting his heartbeat return to something resembling normal.
Tony glanced at Nat and Bruce.  He had gone to her side, and she held his hand, their fingers twined together.  Steve had liked to do that, too.
Even here, at this party in Stark Tower, that had the best security systems outside of the United Nations building--and he could hear Tony in his head saying, “The U.N.
Steve didn’t mention it.  He just drank it with a little glowing ember burning in the pit of his stomach every time he did.  Tony’s kindness was something that was easy to overlook, but at the core of his being, behind the bravado and snark, it was what defined him.  What made Steve love him.
Steve nodded, just giving himself over to Tony for a while. Just living inside his skin for a moment. Tony kissed him again. And again and again. Dozens of kisses, softer now. Sweeter. Gentle against his closed eyelids. Lingering over his mouth and the pulse-point on his throat.
“I don’t really know,” he said into the phone.  “Could be a week, could be a month.  I wish I could be more sure, but I just don’t know.”
She looked down and those startling blue eyes opened.  Zemo had said there were flecks of green in them, but Natasha had never seen them.  Over the years, she’d been more than just a casual observer of those eyes, and they were as perfectly ocean blue as they’d ever been.
Strange sighed, a funny, considering look on his face.  Steve wondered if he could read minds and the blush got redder.
Steve held him until Tony kissed him one last time, then sat up. Tony followed him. He didn’t let Steve go completely, though. Instead, Tony began running his hands over his body. He started at his head and dragged his fingers through Steve’s hair. He tugged it a little, then moved down to his cheeks, held them in his palms for a moment, then slipped them down to his neck, his shoulders, his arms. His face was serious, eyes dark. While he touched him, he muttered to himself. Even sitting so closely, Steve didn’t catch all the words he said. Just bits and pieces. Things like, “Yup, okay.” And “Uh-huh. Still there.”
Tony knocked his knee against Steve’s gently and shook him by the shoulders.  “Just so you know you don’t have to do it
The building was the same.  The same graceful stone and metal that rose high up into the sky.  The same solid base.  It gave off a regal, ethereal air, like a dream that was rooted in reality.  Steve got off his bike and looked up at it.  He hadn’t been here since he’d been back in New York.  He never thought he’d be back here again, but here he was, a bag in his hand, almost like that very first day years ago.  He’d thought he’d had it bad then, with all the worries and baggage he’d carried from his other life, but that had been a sweet oblivion compared to this.  He almost wished he could go back in time and tell that other, younger him to stop being such a baby.  Things got worse.  Things always got worse.  Things
Tony thought about calling him again, but decided not to. He’d be seeing him soon, but it still didn’t feel like it was soon enough. He could not fucking
, he mind cried, and Tony shot to his feet.  His knees popped, the sound loud in the tiny metal room, and he laid hold of Steve and yanked him backward.
they?  True, there had been no touching aside from Steve’s clandestine handhold, and the occasional brush of shoulders as they sat next to each other or slight touch of their fingers when passing something back and forth either in briefings or at the dinner-table, but
Tony pressed his lips to Steve’s chest.  It didn’t have to be a kiss.  Not if Steve didn’t want it to be.  “Probably not.  I’m an old dog.  No new tricks for me.”
“No. He’s been fully vetted. There is no indication whatsoever that he’s involved in Stane’s business. He’s exactly what he appears to be--an orphaned kid who is staying with his godfather until he goes away to school in the fall.”
famous,” Tony said, slipping back into his usual tone of voice, part challenge, part brag, part flagrant flirting. “It’s so famous, people know it on three continents.”
“With Peggy?” Steve asked.  “Just that one kiss.”  He laughed, and the sound was pleasant, a nice laugh, untainted by pain.  “And we weren’t exactly alone.  Or in any kind of position to take it further.  If nothing else, Hydra was one hell of a cock-block.”
“Wait.  Doc.”  Tony followed him out the door.  The guy was tall and took big strides.  Tony put on a burst of speed and jumped in front of him, grabbing one hoodie-clad arm.  “Wait.  Please.”
Beneath the table, Steve felt a light pressure against his ankle and Tony gave him the smallest of winks.
“Are you sure he said Howard Stark?” he asked, the fact that he had asked his own mother almost that very same question three days ago, not lost on him.
“His plane had to make an emergency stop in Tulsa,” Pepper said when she called to give him the news. “He can’t be here until six.”
What was happening in my head was WAY darker than I decided I wanted this to be. There's still going to be a little drama and angsty stuff, but nothing like I was thinking. I'm trying to make this a little fluffier than some of my other stuff. Anyway, hope you enjoyed, and I'll see you in a week or so with chapter 3. Loves to all!
“Don’t count him out yet, Stephen,” Pepper said.  “I’ve seen him win with only his king, a rook, and two pawns left on the board.”  She looked up at Tony, the firelight catching in her eyes, making them shine.  “Remember that, Tony?”
Tony blinked, rubbed his eyes.  “Ross?”  he said.  “Are you here to tell me about our savior, Jesus Christ?  Because if you are, can you come back in about four hours?”
Steve took Tony’s hand again and squeezed it, then turned his face toward Wanda and Strange.  “What do I do?” he asked.  In word and deed, Steve handed himself over to them.  The simple trust he put into them all took Tony’s breath away.  Only Rhodey had ever trusted him so much.
“You come see me, okay?” she said into his ear. “You’re always welcome, sweetheart. Always wanted. Okay?”
pick your Legos up?” he said, trying hard to keep his voice under control. He’d stepped on one of them already, the little peg of death drilling into his bare foot like a rusty nail, and while he technically knew he could put some shoes on, he didn’t think he should have to do that. That wasn’t the way they did things on lazy Saturdays in
He thought about some of that stuff while he had coffee with a couple of people after the meeting. They weren’t friends, but they were
Tony stood by the window and looked down on the beach.  He wasn’t that high up here, but the entire wall was glass and the view of the water and the sand was breathtaking.  If you liked that sort of thing.  Tony was immune to its beauty.  The vodka helped with that.  It numbed everything.  Every thought, every action, ever feeling.  That was good.  Who needed to feel anything, anyway?  Feelings were for the weak.  Stark men were made of iron.
Tony grinned back--the same old Stark grin.  “About that pizza…” he said, listened, then gave Steve a thumbs-up.  “That sounds great, Frank.  We’ll be here.”  He ended the call, tossed his phone onto the couch, and shrugged.  “Pizza in an hour.”
Steve leaned forward in his seat.  His broken arm pressed against the edge of the metal table.  It must have hurt, but he made no sound, showed no pain on his face.  He looked deeply into Tony’s eyes, the blue piercing his own chocolate brown.  “That’s the one time I won’t wait, Tony,” he said.  “I’ll follow you.  I’ll be right behind you.  I swear.”
Tony released his shirt and slid his hand down to clasp Steve’s fingers briefly. “Coffee is a good place to start,” he said. “I like coffee."
“It’s okay,” Tony said, still standing, the officer behind him looking at them both now, unsure, his youth winning out over his training for the moment.  “Baby, it’s okay.  Everything’s going to be okay.”
For a moment, it was everything Tony had hoped it would be.  Steve’s eyes filled with a great, heaving relief, his body relaxed under Tony’s hand.  His mouth curved into a smile and his hand began to rise, meaning to touch Tony, meaning to pull him into his arms.
Steve didn’t watch them go, but he knew they had. He waited until they were gone, until Sam was quiet, and Wanda was easy in his lap. He waited until Dodger had flopped down on the floor near the television. He ran a hand through his hair, then crossed the room and settled on the floor next to Morgan.
He came toward Mr. Stark and Howard extended his hand. “Steven,” he said, smiling, “it’s good to see you.”
Steve hummed in contentment, finally easing completely into Tony’s arms, going pliant against him. “Good,” he said.
“Oh.”  He leaned his head back against the wall.  “That’s good.  Fury was right to contact her.  I wasn’t sure.”  He fidgeted, scraping paint off the brick with one short thumbnail.  “At least one captain can get things done.”
Tony scratched between its ears.  The cat purred with contentment.  “You’re just pissed he outranks you.”
Steve lay back, and Tony eased himself down beside him, curled up next to him. He kissed him, then lay his head right next to Steve’s on the pillow. They were both sweaty, sticky, a mess, but Tony was too exhausted, too content to just lie here with him for a little while to care. He ran his hand through Steve’s hair in a gentle, possessive way. Steve closed his eyes and hummed out a breath. The corners of his mouth ticked upward in a tiny, satisfied smile.
"I do not," Steve said, and pulled out of Tony.  He was gentle, he always was, and Tony didn't even seem to notice.  That bruised his ego a little. No matter how gentle he was, Tony always
He padded down the hall, thoughts of coffee and plans for a new suit for Peter dancing in his head.  Fuck sugarplums.  What the hell was a sugarplum, anyway?
Tony reached into his pocket with the hand not holding Steve’s. When he brought it back out, it was holding a little silver box. Steve frowned in concentration as Tony put it on the table and slid it across toward him.
on it. He just decided to let it go. Focus on other things. Leave the dreams of love and home and family to those who could handle it. To those who actually had a shot at getting it someday.
He’d been living a pretty solitary existence for the last couple months. He had a very definite routine. He got up in the morning at five. He checked his e-mails and messages, took his vitamins, did two hundred push-ups, then went for a run. It was a short run--only five miles. He’d calculated the halfway point from his apartment the morning after he moved in, and now he ran to exactly that place, turned and ran back. He never ran it fast. Never as fast as he could go. It was actually more of a leisurely jog for him. He usually clocked himself at about nine minutes per mile. It took him forty-five minutes. He could have gone much faster, but he didn’t. He liked the cool morning air on his face too much to take it too fast. He generally spent most of the day inside after that, so he relished this time out in the open air. He felt like it replenished something inside of him. He didn’t want to rush that.
“Don’t you yell at me, Rogers,” Ross said crossly, but something flickered behind his eyes at the sight of the steel in Steve’s own.
!--but he felt too good.  Lazy and satisfied.  He’d finished himself off with Steve’s eyes, hot and intense, on him, and when it was over, he’d pulled Tony into his arms and kissed him deeply.  It had been quick and efficient and good, made better by the weight of Steve’s regard, and he still felt too mellow to fight.
“With your mom,” Tony answered. “She came this morning and took Morgan and Dodger out.” He shifted around until he was lying more fully on top of Steve. He kissed him again. Again. Small kisses that felt like fire even through the fabric of his shirt.
So, no, he shouldn’t have looked up. He should have been paying closer attention to Josh, to the words he was saying, to the hand on his thigh, moving upwards a little at a time, moving toward his cock with every second that passed. And he
Steve gasped in pleasure as Tony did things to him with his lips and his tongue.  It was loud in the enclosed room.  He put his hand over his own mouth and slumped bonelessly against the wall, letting Tony have his way with him.
He bowed his head, long dark hair falling in his eyes.  His hand--his human hand, the one made of flesh and blood--hovered just above Steve’s chest.  “I don’t know what to do,” he whispered.
come and pull him away, but that other part, that other little part that had been waiting for him, rejoiced.
Steve shrugged. Tony was transfixed by the flex of muscle that happened when he did that. “I probably won’t be doing it again any time soon, I’ll tell you that.”
Sam laughed. “If you’d asked a year ago, she probably would have said no. But now? Yeah, Steve. She thinks so.”
Took a few liberties with Peter's graduation and stuff.  Oh well, I've been taking liberties since this whole thing started!
“Hey buddy,” he said quietly. “Miss me?” Dodger gave a little yipping bark, and Steve laughed. “Shh. You’re gonna get us in trouble.”
Sam raised an eyebrow expectantly. His own face was unharmed, but his clothes were dirty. His shirt was torn and missing a button.
.  He remembered how he had lain back down on the bed and listened to Tony’s breath even out and deepen as he slept.  He remembered how he’d closed his own eyes, unafraid of the nightmares because there was something about this situation that felt so very safe.  He remembered wishing Tony was closer.
Steve lowered his head onto Tony’s shoulder, and Tony cupped the back of his neck.  Outside, he heard a car pull up.  The sound of voices.
First Bucky, then Peggy, and now all these years later, here he was with a new team, new friends, and the cycle was starting again. Because after Sokovia, Bruce was gone, and no one had seen or heard from Thor since then either. Was it any wonder Steve had become so obsessive about keeping his eyes on the team?
“Okay,” Tony said forcefully. He knocked Steve’s feet aside and grabbed the front of his t-shirt in both hands. “Get over here,” he said, pulling Steve toward him. “I want you to keep talking. I want to hear everything you’ve got to say, but I need to touch you while you do, okay? I can’t listen to you say stuff like that while you’re all the way over there.”
Tony lay back and grabbed his cup of coffee. He drank it. It slid down his throat, hot and good, and he swallowed, feeling the warmth of it bloom in his stomach. He looked fine on the outside. He was a master of that. He could look fine even when his insides were lighting up like fireworks. And they were doing exactly that right now. Exploding with his love for his daughter, exhilaration at the thought that she liked Steve so much, euphoria--fucking
"People tell each other things all the time,” Tony said, drifting over to touch the items laid out.  He petted the towel, dipped his finger into the shaving soap and rubbed it between his fingers, then with a delicate touch, lifted the razor.  He opened it and the bathroom light caught the blade, making the keen edge shine.
Tony laughed and put his forehead against Steve’s shoulder.  “What am I going to do with you two, huh?” he murmured.
Sarah kissed his cheek loudly, then nodded toward the dining room. “Go on. Take him his coffee. I’ll make breakfast.”
Peter laughed, then craned his neck, looking through the crowd.  “Did Captain Rogers come with you?  I thought he might.”
Steve shook his head immediately, his eyes never leaving their intertwined hands. “No,” he said. “No. I wouldn’t do that. I wouldn’t have put you in that position. It would have been selfish.”
But this time, along with Tony’s text saying, “COME HOME. I WANT SEX.”, there was also a missed call from an unknown number, and a voicemail message.
He dropped Dodger off at his mom’s house, then went to his meeting. He didn’t talk. He didn’t feel like talking much, but it comforted him to listen to other people’s stories. He had talked before, of course. Had sat, looking at his hands, while he talked about being a young, sick kid. About how his father had died. About being lonely and scared all the time. About how someone had come into his life and lit it up in a million different ways. And about how his own insecurities had been the catalyst for that someone to no longer be in his life. How he had driven him away. How he had then
Steve rolled his head until his lips found the soft skin of Tony’s neck.  He kissed him once--or twice.  “Don’t worry,” he said.
Steve looked at his watch again, then looked anxiously up and then down the street. He didn’t see Tony. He didn’t see any of the three cars he drove.  He didn’t see any of his suits, or his stupid t-shirts, or his sunglasses, or the reading glasses he wore when they sat in the diner looking at menus like they always did, in spite of the fact that they invariably ordered the exact same thing every time they went there. He didn’t see his hair, or his arms, or his hands, and Steve thought--no,
I am working on the back half of this chapter as we speak. I will seriously get it posted ASAP. Thanks for reading and being patient with me! Loves to you all!
Steve laughed. They all laughed. Steve could tell Tony’s laughter was forced, but he didn’t say anything.
“What are you doing?” he finally asked, as Tony moved on to his hands, touching each finger in turn, going from knuckle to nail, then turning each to inspect his palms.
Sam sighed. “We’re way too into this superhero shit,” he said, and Steve gave him a grateful smile. “Although,” he went on, turning his eyes to Tony, “
Tony put his hand on Steve’s chest, curled his fingers into his shirt. “I like your house,” he said quietly, tipping his face up, his other hand slipped up Steve’s arm to the side of his neck. He touched the cords there, loving the smooth slide of his muscle under his thumb. He urged him down with a gentle touch, and Steve came easily, willingly.
?” He laughed again, and Tony’s stomach clenched in on itself. “And maybe you don’t think any of that matters right now, but give it a couple years. Live without for a while. See how long you last.”
“Hey,” Tony said sharply. “Hey, you need to stop. Stop talking about what you can give me, Steve. I don’t care about any of that, and you know it.” He grasped Steve’s arms. “Baby. Baby, you’re all I ever wanted. And, it’s not like you’re the only one who’d be working. I’m going to be working at SI after I graduate. I’ll have plenty of money. More than we could ever even spend. You wouldn’t even have to work if you didn’t want-”
“Tony?” he breathed uncertainly, and Tony nearly swooned with the force of his relief.  He rested his head against Steve’s shoulder.  It seemed too heavy to lift.
She trailed off and Steve nodded.  He’d known what her answer would be before she said it.  She loved Steve--they loved each other--but Clint was something else entirely.  Steve understood that, he always had, but that didn’t mean it didn’t hurt.
“Maybe,” Tony murmured, and his voice sounded as dazed as Steve felt. His fingers were still on his cheek, rubbing across it. Steve’s lips felt warm. Tingly. Like Tony’s skin had held a slight electrical charge. Maybe it did. Maybe that’s why Tony kept touching it. Maybe he had felt it too.
assumed, then I got in there and realized we hadn’t talked about it.”  He smoothed his hand over Steve’s chest, feeling the muscles underneath the soft weave of his sweater.  “And I was afraid you thought I’d brought you here just for,” he cocked an eyebrow, “nefarious purposes.”
He awoke some unknown time later to someone shaking his shoulder gently. Tony muttered something in his sleep, burrowed deeper into Steve’s chest, and was silent again. Steve could feel him breathing against him, and he tightened his grip on him unconsciously, not certain if this was part of a dream or reality, and not wanting to let go no matter which it turned out to be.
Steve bit his lip, but said nothing.  He was being torn apart from the inside out.  Hitler?  God, was that what he was in the eyes of this man?  The idea made him sick with rage and fear.  He didn’t want to go.  He didn’t want to be in a cage with this man as his jailor.  But he thought of Tony.  Of Natasha.  Of everything.
“Sure.  Eleven, it is.”  Tony drummed his fingers on the table.  Excitement was building inside him.  He was ready.  “I love this plan,” he said.  “I’m ecstatic about this plan.  I loved it a year and a half ago when Nat and I came up with it, and I still love it now.”
That most of all.  The fear that he’d last seen in Tony’s eyes as the shield came down, shattering the arc reactor in his chest, putting out its light.  The fear he’d seen as he showed Tony his dark side, at last.  And the realization that his dark side was too dark.  That his dark side was an ebony pit that no one could bear to look into.  That there were things in that pit that were restless and writhing and desperate.  The realization that Tony was right to be afraid.
“In case you’ve forgotten, Thaddeus,” Fury said.  His voice was loud but calm, his lone dark eye ablaze.  He was not used to being overridden.  “Captain Rogers never did sign the Accords.”
“Alright,” Tony said, and nudged him with his shoulder. “Good. I’ll meet you at your locker after last class, okay?”
“I’m sorry, baby,” Tony went on. “I’m so sorry if I made you feel like that. I wasn’t thinking that at all. All I was thinking was that I hated his fucking guts and couldn’t stand to listen to him anymore.”
They walked back into the living room, watching the snow fall on the city outside.  It was beautiful.
Natasha came to his room sometimes, but more often they met in the training room.  They didn’t talk about much while they sparred, but she was even more quiet today.  She seemed anxious.  She was more aggressive, but sloppy in her technique.  Steve took her down twice.
, but Steve surprised him. He lifted one shoulder again, “I don’t know,” he said. “Kinda. In a way, I guess.”
Tony put his foot on the floor and leaned forward, grasping Steve’s wrist in one tight fist. “Yeah, well, I know
. Like I did back then. And itchy. Like there was sand. ‘Cause there was always sand. In everything. All over everything. We called it Moon Dust.” he laughed shortly, the sound jarring in the enclosed space. He looked at Dodger. Ran his fingers over the top of his head, and repeated the words, softly. Quietly. “Moon Dust. Like it was a joke.”
She must have sent it to both of them, because all of a sudden, there were tiny tears in the corners of Clint’s eyes.
“I’ve really gotta have an answer here, guys,” the cop said. He was an older guy, sixty or so, and he looked both weary and amused by the situation. Like he was watching an episode of his favorite tv show that he’d seen a hundred times before.
Steve had his eyes closed.  His head rested against the seat-back.  He’d fastened his seat-belt like Tony had told him to do.  “Sounds like he knows you pretty well.”
“My god, you are so beautiful,” Tony mused. Steve flushed with both embarrassment and happiness, and Tony chuckled softly. “Oh, I know,” he said, running his hand gently over Steve’s face--his cheek, his chin, his mouth. “I know you get a little...flustered when I say that, but baby, my god. My god, I have
He called her number from memory. He’d seen Bucky call her a lot, and it stuck in Steve’s head, filed away with Mr. Barker’s and the pizza place he and his mother had ordered from so many times over the years.
They got in and Tony keyed the engine to life.  It rumbled pleasantly loud.  He’d installed a top of the line stereo system, but he didn’t turn it on.  He buckled his seat belt.  Steve didn’t.  He never did unless Tony told him to.  Seat belts hadn’t even been a thing in Steve’s day.  Steve always claimed he forgot.  Tony thought it was more of that battlefield arrogance.
Now she lifted her head, and she lifted it high, looking Steve in the eye, and the pride in his own face was brilliant, blinding.
Lavish. It was the only word that fit. Waiters in hot rod red shirts walked here and there balancing huge trays of champagne and delicate canapes. Chandeliers dripped crystals, women dripped jewels. Music from a string quartet played continuously, people chatted, laughed, groups of beautiful men and women forming and re-forming in the swirl of a sequined skirt, the flash of a diamond cufflink.
Steve pitched his voice lower, but kept staring, his blazing eyes locked on Ross’.  “I said I’ll go,” he repeated.  “To The Raft.  I’ll go.”
He kissed Tony’s hand one final time, lingering with his lips on the base of his thumb, then took it away from his mouth. He didn’t let go of it, though. He kept holding it in both of his own, and when Tony had to steal it back to down-shift on the turns, Steve took it back again when he was done, and when they stopped at a small country store to buy drinks and sandwiches, Steve held it in his as often as he could. He ignored the offended looks a couple of people in the store gave them. They didn’t matter. What mattered was that Tony didn’t let go either. What mattered was that Tony called him ‘baby’ when he asked him what kind of sandwich he wanted, and if he wanted mustard or mayo. What mattered was Tony. The light he gave off. The warmth. What mattered was that it belonged to him again.
Tony moved past him and went to Sarah. He dropped into her arms, and Steve saw out of the corner of his downcast eye the way she caught him just the way she always caught Steve himself. She held him, rocked him a little unconsciously, and he locked his arms around her neck, holding on tight.
Tony took a deep breath. “Next time you have a day like today, you’ll come to me first. Okay?” Steve looked down at the mattress, and Tony’s hand slipped into his hair. “If you want to be alone or whatever
Steve’s face went carefully blank.  “Oh.  Jeff.”  He nodded.  “That’s great, Tony.  I’m happy for you.”
Ross took his hand, patted it in a consoling way.  Tony’s own fingers tightened around it involuntarily, clamping down as the pain pulsed through his muscles.  Ross looked at him, his eyes cruel and cold, as they considered the dying man before him.  “But maybe this is better,” he said.  “If he’s as in love as you seem to think, maybe this is perfect.”  He chuckled.  The sound was huge, grating in Tony’s pounding ears.  “Or maybe not.  You weren’t his first choice, were you, Stark?  Not if what Mr. Zemo told me was true.  It’s actually
“Well, first, you get better,” he said, “and you enjoy the rest of this vacation.”  He tilted his head.  “Unless you’re still planning on going back to New York tomorrow?”
Steve leaned against her, and she ran her hand through his hair again. “Thanks for letting him stay with you, Mom.”
But, of course, he didn’t ask her those questions. Not now, not when he was just barely home and they had three days together. Especially since she was right--the time they did have never seemed like enough. Not to bother her with this. With stupid questions he already knew the answer to. Things he had figured out over the last two years, but hadn't admitted to himself until he decided to really get serious about getting sober eight months ago. That was when he finally stopped worrying about it so much. When he stopped thinking about it all the time. When he stopped looking at couples on the street and thinking,
Tony put a tentative hand on Sam’s shoulder. “What about you?” he asked, chewing his lip. “You’re going. Do I need to make up with you, too?”
He got to his feet and started to pace. Sam had promised he’d be here as soon as he checked on his own patients at the care center where he worked, and while Steve had been anxious for him to show up before, now he was nearly frantic.
“I know you will.”  She started away and he put a hand on her hip to keep her near.  “Nat,” he whispered, not quite meeting her eye, “thanks for last night.”
Tony coasted to a stop, and Steve opened the door and got out. He looked around at the tall trees, the meadow of wildflowers just getting their full bloom in this late-May morning, the sandy beach, the dock leading out into the lake itself. Steve didn’t think he had ever seen anything quite as beautiful in his entire life. He’d been out of the city a few times, sure, but this felt like another world. A quiet, peaceful world that was sacred and soft around the edges. A world where no one hurt, and there were no wars that needed to be fought. No angry, condescending parents. No worries, no fears, just a chance for harmony and the gentle lapping of the lake on the beach.
Rhodey raised his hands.  “I’m not.  You just looked like a wounded collie when I drove up and I couldn’t think of another reason why.”
Bucky ran a quick hand over his face, his eyes.  “Anyway, I just wanted you to know that I don’t worry about him anymore.  At least not about him being happy.  I don’t have to.  ‘Cause you’re worrying about that now.  Right?”
He wasn’t sure what roused him from sleep, all he knew was that he was grateful.  Asleep, he couldn’t feel the heavy, sweet weight that was Steve Rogers encompassing him.  Couldn’t feel his arm around him, his leg over him, trapping him in the most divine way imaginable.  Couldn’t feel Steve’s breath on his neck, slow, steady, even.  Couldn’t revel in the riot of happiness that existed inside just to be waking up in this bed with him still sleeping peacefully beside him.  That hadn’t happened in a long time.  Too long.  So, whatever had woken him was now his new hero.  His new best friend.
Steve watched him go. Watched him walk to the car, watched him climb inside, watched through the window--even though he couldn’t see through the tint--watched as the taillights flared, then watched as the car pulled away, down the street, dragging its shadow behind it. He watched. He watched until it was gone, then he wiped his eyes, thinking of the feeling of Tony’s lips pressed against his. The feel of Tony’s fingers entwined with his. Thinking of how good that had felt. Thinking that he wished he could have done it again before he left.
Tony smiled a little, his face growing thoughtful. “You think so?” he asked, tightening his grip on Steve’s hand.
“Nebula was able to give us some insight.”  Rhodey gestured to the alien/robot Nat had talked about.  Steve wasn’t one hundred percent sure which she was either.
Tony hadn’t realized Howard had followed him away from the party until he felt his hand on the back of his neck. He started when he first felt that touch, then eased when Howard squeezed him with a comforting sureness.
Tony crouched down in the corner, his legs suddenly too weak to support him, and wrapped his arms around himself.
here.” He turned back to Steve, a complicated look in his eyes. They were surprised, hurt, and something else. Something that looked hopeful--almost hungry. “What is he doing here?”
Tony could not resist any longer. He lifted Steve’s head and kissed his mouth deeply. Steve’s tongue slipped against his in a tantalizing dance, slow and sensual. Tony drew it into his own mouth and sucked it a little, making Steve moan in the back of his throat.
, it's sexy," Steve muttered, but he lifted his chin a little, giving Tony easier access to his neck.
.” He cocked an eyebrow. “‘Cause I don’t want to be the one to catch hell if they find out I let you get on a bus and fall asleep and end up in New Hampshire, or something.”
“Doesn’t sound like he’s much of a boyfriend,” Steve said softly, letting his fingers tighten and shift on Tony’s hip. “Leaving you here all alone with a scary guy like that around. He shoulda stuck around. Kept an eye on things. Made sure you were taken care of.”
They did. He’d driven here enough, both when they were together back when they were kids, and then alone in the years between then and now. He did it a lot. Every time he came to the city. He never stopped, but he drove by, gazing up at the fourth-floor window, thinking back to old times. He knew it was masochistic. He knew. But he couldn’t seem to stop himself from doing it.
Quiet spun out between them, heavy with feeling and a million things both said and unsaid.  At last, Steve broke it.
Tony turned Steve’s palm to his mouth and kissed his wrist.  There was blood there, outlining the bracelets of fortune, but he did it anyway.  He would do it every day, every hour, for the next hundred years if he could.
Which one moved first? Was it Tony’s hand that found its way onto Steve’s inner thigh and began to stroke it subtly? Or was it Steve’s lips that brushed against the side of his neck? Softly. Just soft little touches of his mouth? Did it even matter?
Steve frowned at him for a minute, then shook his head, a tiny smile appearing and disappearing in a flash. “Okay,” he said.
“No,” Howard said and held up his hand. “No, Steven, please don’t apologize. It doesn’t matter. The party doesn’t matter. I-”
the words “I love you”. Even if he felt them more and more every day, he didn’t say them because it was too soon and he didn’t want to scare Tony away. He didn’t
Tony placed his finger on the frame of the picture on the wall. His eyes were drawn once again to that black cut-out shadow. “We could talk about this.”
Steve sighed, giving in.  It was easy, that giving in.  Maybe too easy, but that seemed to be the way of things when it came to Tony.  “Okay.  Okay, fine.”
“Do you really think so, Tony?” His voice was worried and hopeful, and Tony felt his heart ache with love for him.  Heightened as it was by their shared madness, it nearly brought him to his knees.
Tony laughed at the tinge of panic in her tone.  He’d missed it.  He’d missed her.  So much.  “No, Pep, I’m okay.”
Tony dropped his head onto Steve’s shoulder. Made a disappointed groaning sound in the back of his throat. Steve laughed softly.
They wound up back at the Avengers Compound.  Those of them that were left, that was.  Rhodey, Bruce, Thor, Natasha, himself.  There were others that hung around or that they were in contact with.  Thor had brought a foul-mouthed little raccoon-like creature named Rocket with him.  T’Challa’s general Okoye, Carol Danvers, a friend of Fury’s, but of the original team, his friends, his
Tony guided him through it, showing him with soft touches and whispered words how it would be between them, how it would always be.  It was excruciatingly slow, excruciatingly sweet, like heaven, heaven having Steve here with him like this.  Heaven having Steve above him, around him, inside him.  His heat, his scent--good old Skin Bracer, byyy
Steve didn’t have to look for Tony. He was everywhere and drew Steve’s eye like a moth to the flame. He was with Pepper tonight, and if the constant touching meant anything, she had come as his date and not his employee. A more casual viewer may not have noticed the difference--Tony touched everybody--but the delicate way his fingers lingered on the small of her back or brushed her hair aside so he could whisper in her ear spoke volumes to Steve.
They looked at each other, then Natasha was suddenly in his arms, hugging him fiercely, and kissing his cheek. Tony tensed, startled, then hugged her back just as enthusiastically. He was surprised, but very happy. Very, very happy.
Dodger wagged his tail again. His tongue hung out of his mouth, grinning at Tony in a happy way that Tony might would have found cute--okay, fucking adorable--if he hadn’t been on the bed.
. She’d been reading it herself this morning, and Steve picked it up after she’d fallen asleep and kind of fell down the rabbit hole. It was a little weird--very fucking weird--but he was enjoying it, turning pages with a rapidity that didn’t happen much with the books he usually read, when a voice above him said, “Hello, Steven.”
When he opened his eyes, they fell on the bars on the man’s chest.  Steve straightened immediately, snapping to attention as naturally as the guard had done in his cell.  His tour had ended decades ago, but he did it anyway.  The bars on the man’s chest meant “colonel”.  “Colonel” meant respect.
“Did you call me?” Tony asked, pulling out his phone, even though he knew he didn’t have any calls. He’d just checked. He checked the second he woke up. He always did.
Steve’s tears finally over-spilled his lashes as Natasha broke their kiss, and she took him into her arms.  He put his face into the crook of her neck, his strong arms around her tiny waist, and held onto her tightly, as if she was his only link to the world, as if she was the only thing keeping him grounded.
Tony put his hand on Steve’s cheek and drew him forward.  He kissed his mouth soundly.  “Baby, it’s perfect.”
“I wasn’t right,” Tony snapped, his voice sharper than he intended.  He stopped, took a deep breath, calming himself, and began again.  “I read Howard’s files.  Hell, I read
account,” Steve grumbled.  “Did you ever think of that?  Christ, Tony, not everything is about you.”
Tony came back to the chair.  Steve stiffened when he took the handles but didn’t say anything.  Baby steps.  They went down to the lake and sat for awhile.  Steve sat in his chair and Tony perched on the edge of the dock, his legs swinging a few inches above the water.  They didn’t talk much, but Steve put his hand in Tony’s hair and ran it through his fingers absently.
Tony felt his chest go tight, his heart constricting with love. “Why didn't you talk to me then?” he asked. “Why are you barely talking to me now?”
He reached out and touched Tony’s fingers.  It felt like he was reaching not only across the couple of feet that stood between them, but across the years, as well.  Back to that night when he’d held Tony’s sleeping hand in his.  There had been so much possibility in that touch, so much promise, and even though a lot had changed between them, he hoped--prayed--that had not.
“No,” Steve said. “No. This is perfect, Tony. This...this is for us. July can be for family, but now? I want this to be you and me. That’s how it started out, right? Just you and me?”
Her eyes flitted around the room again, restless, searching. Steve admired and appreciated it. He knew she was trained as a spy, but she had a soldier’s eye. Like called to like, his mother would have said. The thought that his mother would have liked Natasha lit a warm fire in his chest. He leaned closer still.
Tony saw them in the Mess Hall, identical scoops of army-grade slop on their metal trays, rain coming down outside the tent, turning the camp to soup.  Blake shocked to see Captain Rogers at a table alone, doodling on a napkin while he ate.  Tony saw him standing indecisive for a minute before thinking, “What the hell?” and sliding in across from Steve.  Tony saw Steve look up, surprised but smiling, putting his drawing away while Blake chatted to him.  Tony saw Steve listening, nodding amiably at the kid’s stories.
“Stop telling me what I’d be thinking!” Tony shouted and jumped to his feet. “God, is that the kind of person you think I am? That I’d be so wrapped up in all that shit that I wouldn’t be happy being with you?
Tony slipped his arm around Steve’s waist and pulled him closer, until they were pressed together, his other hand still on Steve’s cheek. “What can I do?” he asked.
It was still cold.  Mid-February was always a sodden, frozen bitch of a time in New York, but under the cold, existing just beneath the surface, was the promise of spring.  It would be here soon.  It’s rampant, verdant, green energy revitalizing everything.  He’d missed it last year.  He had been here, but had spent most of March holed up at home trying to rid himself of February.  And then he’d given up.  Given up on Steve, given up on himself, given up on
And for the first time in months, he was starting to worry. He was starting to have those ‘What-if’ thoughts again.
Only two or three more chapters to go! Thank you all so much for the love you guys have shown for this story. I wasn't sure how it would be received, but you have all just made every chapter better by giving me your own perspectives on them, so seriously--thank you! I love you all!!
Tony sat on the edge of the tub, then slid backward. His back banged into the far rim, and he hissed in a pained breath.
Steve chuckled and leaned back against the arm of the couch. His t-shirt pulled taut against his chest, and if Tony had not been so distracted by the task already at hand, he would have been more than ready to start another task. A very hands-on task.
“Is there something I should know about you and the bagel-guy?” Steve asked. He was still touching the button, toying with it, and looking at Tony from under his long lashes.
Steve put his hand on Tony’s hip. He slipped his thumb underneath the hem of his t-shirt and touched the smooth skin there. “You look better than you did when you were seventeen.”
The shocked looks they had received when they first came to town had tickled Tony pink, but after the initial surprise wore off, nobody seemed to care much, and that tickled
Tony nudged the pizza.  “Have some of this, first,” he said, his voice a bed-ready whisper.  “You’re starving, remember?”
When they parted, it was Steve’s turn to sigh. Eyes still closed, he took in a deep breath, then let it out again in a shudder. Tony’s hand was still on his neck, his other still held firmly in Steve’s.
His mind tried to conjure the image of Bucky.  The image of him falling.  The image of him on that freeway overpass, his mask torn aside, his eyes cold and dead.
He thought of the resentment and animosity of their first meeting.  The almost grudging respect that came next.  The fragile friendship.  The hidden, unspoken tenderness.  The one-sided attraction.  The love.
Steve’s face wrinkled into a disappointed little frown. It was a double-edged sword, that frown. Because despite how sad it made Tony to see it, he thought it was absolutely adorable. Something that was half-pout, half-tease, and Tony was afraid he could get very attached to that. Might do things just to bring it about, not only so he could see it again, but so he could make it up to him afterward. Take him out. Buy him pretty things. Get down on his knees and beg for forgiveness.
Tony laughed. “Oh. So actually ‘dumb stuff’,” he said, and casually rested one hand on Steve’s knee. “You know, we were talking about that once in California in my Physics class. We figured he’d have to travel almost the speed of light--like six hundred-sixty
Tony struggled, trying to wrap his mind around what was happening.  For a moment, he thought he might have chased his still-long-gone shoe down some freaky rabbit-hole where up was down and down was up and Pepper was wearing Stephen Strange’s t-shirt because of...some reason Tony still couldn’t grasp yet.  Then he wondered if Stange had put some kind of hex on him.  He was like a witch, right?  Maybe he and Lord Voldemort hung out on the reg and he had spelled Tony into just
“Good,” Bucky answered.  “That’s good.”  He glanced down at Tony’s feet, at the name he had almost spelled out, then, using his own toe, added the last letter.  E.  S-T-E-V-E.
Part Two of chapter five. Just a hit of fluff...with a hit of angst. Because you can't have one without the other! At least not in one of my stories 😉
Tony put a hand on his chest. “Stand down, Captain,” he said. “My guys have got it handled. Let them do their jobs. God knows I pay them enough for it.”
Tony drew in a deep breath.  Ross’ words were concentrated poison.  They were designed to break him, to wound him, to bring him low.  Ross was a brilliant tactician.  He could read people.  Find the chinks in their suits of armor.  And even though he was wearing a hand-made Italian suit on the outside, Tony had always worn a suit of iron around his heart.
Steve snapped immediately to attention, and clapped his hands together. “Okay, everybody," he said. “Dinnertime.”
Steve squeezed him back, loving that he could do that. It seemed like a long time since he’d hugged his best friend. “Thanks. Tell her I appreciate it. I do. But.” He shrugged, and Sam nodded.
Tony closed his eyes.  Bowed his head.  Hatred, clean and unabashed, washed over him.  He was sick with it.  Delirious with it.  “You need to get out of my house,” he said quietly.
“Yes, it was,” Steve answered, and now he did pour some whiskey into his glass. He downed it easily, and wiped moisture from his bottom lip. “I wasn’t paying attention. They were my responsibility, and I let them down.” He gulped another drink. “I got that kid killed.”
Tony had been moving against him, grasping him with his hands, touching him with his lips, pressing against him, but now he took a step back and hung his head. He let it fall onto Steve’s chest with a harsh sigh. “Oh Steve,” he muttered. “Why’d you say that? Huh?” He stepped back, clenched his hands in fists against his thighs. “Why?” he repeated, and a tinge of anger charred the edges of his voice. “Why’d you have to mention him? We were doing so fucking well.”
“There we go,” Tony said, and even with his eyes closed, Steve could hear the satisfaction in it. “That’s what I was after.”
“Yeah. For something.” He shook his head and eased down onto Steve’s lap. “There’s always something.”
Strange sighed.  "Thaddeus Ross," he said.  "It looks like Thaddeus Ross shot him in the stomach and left him to die."
Tony gave him a slow, secret smile. “Yeah, that’s it, Rogers,” he breathed. “You’re not memorable at all.”
“Now, I’m starting to worry a little, too,” Bruce said.  He looked at the plans hovering around them, and used his own hands to expand the image.  “This, Tony.  This is beautiful work.  But, it shouldn’t come at the expense of everything else.”
“You take care of me,” he said simply.  “And not just feeding me and clothing me and making sure I take a shower, although, Christ knows, you’ve done all those things.”
The voice was Tony’s on top, but underneath, it was Natasha’s too. And Sam’s. And the kind, motherly waitress from the diner, and his boss from the factory a long time ago, who used to bring enough food for Steve to share when he noticed Steve never brought a lunch to work. And it was Steve’s voice too.
it. And his hands were his greatest tools. He knew that. They were more sensitive than any calibration device known to man--at least when it came to Steve Rogers. He would trust only them to this task. He would-
He crossed his legs, pinching the crease of his suit pants expertly to preserve it even while he sat. “Tony’s at the MIT campus right now,” he said.
Tony started back toward the kitchen, just assuming Steve would follow. He was right. “The best things come to those who wait,” he said over his shoulder.
Steve turned his head on the pillow.  Tony’s lamp was still on, and Steve squeezed his eyes shut even tighter to compensate.  “Wha-?” he muttered, and at least that was part of a word.
Nat rubbed his shoulder consolingly.  “Come on now.  Don’t be sulky.  Or I won’t bring you a souvenier from Majorca.”
Steve saved him.  Like he’d saved him a hundred times, maybe a thousand, since they’d met all those years ago.  Like he’d saved him in every possible way.  He didn’t have to.  He could have just stood by and let Tony flounder, trying to tell this familiar, unknown girl who this tall, blond, nerdy, pig-headed, sweet, gentle,
“Still,” he pressed and cast an uncertain eye down to where the kid stood. “I was a jerk. I need to make it right.”
It was smaller than the one in the Tower, but that same manic energy still hung in a haze around this room.  Steve was still amazed at the things he saw when he came in here.  Still excited and interested and frightened by all the things that began as only flashes inside Tony’s complicated, wondrous mind before finding their way down to his hands and made into reality.  It was still, even after all these years, difficult for him to conceive of--the sheer magnitude of things Tony could do--but it made him proud.  Proud and happy to think that it was his man who was capable of that.  His man who could create such brilliant things from nothing.  His man.
Tony pulled his car to a stop in front of a high-rise building, and they got out. Steve stood on the pavement, looking up at it. It was huge, graceful, beautiful, nothing like the fourth-floor walk-up he and his mother lived in, and the nerves he’d felt earlier came rushing back.
Tony took his jacket off and laid it aside, then took his tie off and unbuttoned a couple of buttons. He kicked his shoes off. It felt good doing that here, in Steve’s space. It felt like something he should be doing every night. He hoped that would be the case. He prayed it would be.
Steve turned back, looking at the guy who had spoken. The guy in the seat across from him. “Um. Yeah. I guess.”
Howard was home when Tony got there. He was sitting on the living room sofa, a glass of Scotch by his hand, glasses low on his nose, tie pulled down, shirt-sleeves rolled up. It was as casual as Tony had ever seen him look. It was his Sunday, dress-down look. Tony had seen it his entire life.
Steve and Bucky leaned into each other, their laughter raucous and carefree.  Tony shook his head and stalked away, mumbling something about irresponsible assholes as he went.
Steve sighed and sat back. He didn’t feel guilty--never guilty, not after everything this man had said and done--but he felt
He pressed four on his speed-dial, groped the keys out of his pocket, dropped them, then picked them up with hands that shook like leaves on a quaking tree.
He kissed the top of her sweet-smelling hair and brushed it out of her eyes with absent affection. “Yeah, peanut?”
for forty-whatever-but-who’s-counting years?  And how could he exist now knowing that was a possibility?  That pouty little whine, that frown?  How would he ever be able to get out of bed again?
“It was perfect, Steve,” Tony said into his chest, and pressed closer into him. “It was so fucking perfect.”
Tony pulled a chair out and threw himself into it.  He scrubbed his hands over his own face and looked up.  “So?  What is it now?”
He came up out of sleep a few hours later.  He squinted his eyes and looked at his watch.  12:01.  Christmas was over.  That was a relief, too.
And then he was down the old, familiar rabbit-hole of self-doubt and fear, with Howard right there in his head, agreeing with every bad thought he had.
Steve smiled at him, brushed his fingers across his cheek like he'd done with Morgan. Tony hated how disappointed and resigned that smile was. He appreciated the fact that it was there, though. He really did. “Happy birthday."
The rest of the team had left earlier, so Steve and Tony were alone.  It was dark in the alley, mostly quiet.  A couple of kids on a date rolled an occasional ball down the far lane.  They threw gutter-balls almost exclusively, then groaned or high-fived at the worst ones.  The boy’s eyes were bright, the girl’s color high.  They laughed a lot.
Tony paid no attention to the sounds of Bucky’s broken sobs or the murmured words of the other two people there with him.  He said his name again--”Steve”--tasting it on his tongue, trying to make it last, and held him tighter, afraid to let go because once he did, that would be the end.
?” Tony asked, and looked up at him. It felt like a shark’s look even to himself. Probably because it was. And did he care that every time he looked at Steve, it was with a hungry, predatory look? Not one single bit. Especially if it brought out that blush that he remembered so well--loved so well--from when they were kids. Just like it was doing right now.
“FRIDAY told me.  Where are my keys?  Ah.” He scooped a set off the table he’d sat on to bandage Steve’s hands.  “Ready?”
Tony looked at the image of Steve sleeping on his bunk.  That worried look was still on his face, and it was driving Tony to distraction.  He wanted to touch those lines and soothe them away, kiss those parted lips until he slept soundly again.  “I’ll tell you what he wouldn’t say,” Tony said.  “He
He left Howard standing there. Left him to gather Morgan up, slip her into her jacket, and rush out the door. He left him standing there, and he didn’t see how much those two words affected Howard. How much they shook him. How much they meant to him.
Steve chewed his bottom lip.  He didn’t meet Tony’s eyes, kept his own cast down.  He didn’t pull away from Tony’s touch, but did not respond to it, either.  “You left me there,” he said in a voice that was barely even audible.  “At that hospital.  You left me there.  After you
Tony shook his head a little, dismissing it.  “So, if you’re not armed, I guess you didn’t ask me out here to kill me?”
Morgan smiled, giggled a little, the sound like the twitter of a bird. “Steve’s not little,” she said, shaking her head, and Sarah laughed.
, his brain supplied helpfully. “I’m sorry,” he managed. “I don’t understand why you’d want to do that?” He gave the last word a little uptilt in inflection, turning it into a half-question.
in his chest whenever he saw Tony wearing his clothes. Something that felt a little covetous. A little primal. Something that beat within his secret heart, saying
Tony pushed off his chest and slipped silently across the room. Steve watched as he put his eye to the crack between the partially-closed door and the jamb. “Holy shit,” he whispered, incredulously. “He
“Just because you’re not my boyfriend anymore doesn’t mean I’m going to stop loving you,” he said. “You know that, right?”
some fucking someone else doing it. No, that wasn’t in the plan. That wasn’t the way things were supposed to go. Not the way they were supposed to
“Will you stay with me?”  His eyes gazed up at him timidly.  “I don’t want to be alone like last time.  It was cold.  And dark.”  His mouth trembled.  His whole body trembled.  “I was scared.”
“Hmm.  I just don’t know why you wanted to cover it up in the first place.  You don’t cover the Mona Lisa, Steve.”
And as much as he adored her and missed her, he kind of wanted to mope for a while. He thought he’d earned a good mope.
Howard left and Steve went back to work, but he didn’t think about what he was doing. He didn’t have to. He just let his body do what it needed to while his brain ran over the situation. And no matter what point it brought up--Mr. Stark, the company, the art itself--what it was really thinking about was Tony. What he would think about this. If he’d like it. If it would make him proud.
“Throw some over your shoulder,” Steve said automatically.  Clint looked up, surprised, and smiled sadly.  He pinched a bit in his fingers and threw it over his left shoulder.
Her eyes drifted shut, then popped back open. “Go home and sleep,” she said, lifting a finger to point at him. “I’m serious.”
“That’s not why it’ll always be just you, baby,” Tony said. “It’ll always be you because you’re my everything.” He kissed Steve’s neck. His shoulder. His cheek. Everywhere he could reach. “You’ll always be my everything.”
Steve opened his eyes in the shadows.  “I’m coming, Tony,” he said, and even though the context was all wrong, the words sent a jolt of hot desire through Tony’s core.
“Um,” Steve said again. He hated the way he sounded. Like he was some damn kid himself. He wasn’t. He was twenty-five. And while he didn’t care much about what he saw in the mirror, he knew he wasn’t
Tony smiled and kissed his forehead again. He’d never get tired of that. He knew it. He knew how sappy it was, but he couldn’t care less. “Well, I like how that turned out.”
Steve sighed, put his hands on Tony’s thighs, stroking them, drawing circles on them with his fingertips. “Too much time on my hands,” he said. “Too many sleepless nights. Too much nervous energy.”
. I just-” he sighed harshly, “I need you to do that for me too, right now,” he said. “I need you to say everything
Steve laughed.  His eyes crinkled at the corners.  Tony’s heart fluttered again, and his stomach did a happy little roll.
Steve shrugged, that disappointed, resigned smile on his face intensifying for a moment. “I’ll see you in the morning.”
Steve put his hand over Tony’s, holding it against his cheek, and stepped into him. “Yes,” he whispered. “Please.”
Steve shuddered in his arms, holding him tightly, his head buried in Tony’s neck.  “Me too, Tony.  Me too.  Remember that, okay?  Please?”
They climbed the rest of the stairs, and Steve opened the door at the top with a twist of his key. Tony followed him through the door, helplessly remembering every other time. The first time. The last time. All the times in between. His eyes scanned the room, and just like Steve’s had done, they fell on Morgan’s photograph immediately. He brushed past Steve and went to it, making a punched out little sound in the back of his throat. He raised a finger and traced it along the frame.
Tony gestured weakly in the direction of the party. It was a big one. Glitzy. Music playing. People--Tony probably only really knew one in ten--eating, laughing, drinking on the company dime. “But-”
On days like today when he couldn’t go into the treatment room with her, he’d sit out in the waiting room with his book and his headphones. He had almost given up the smoking--for Sarah--but around the three-hour mark, he would start to get a little antsy, and head down to the cafeteria for a cup of coffee and a muffin. He’d tried the almond poppyseed, but couldn’t get over the strange, oily feel of it in his mouth, so he went to the blueberry. That one was a little better, although he thought they were playing pretty fast and loose with the word “blueberry”. Sure, there were blue pieces in the muffin, but he was pretty fucking sure they weren’t blueberries. He still ate it though. Fake blueberries were better than none at all.
Steve laughed.  “Thank god for Bruce.  He finally bit the bullet and threw them out.  I don’t think anyone else dared.”
There’d been a pre-Thanksgiving fundraising gala for the homeless of New York, and Pepper had talked him into going.  She hadn’t had to talk too hard.  It had been a cause Maria had always championed, and he liked to keep up with it.
“Baby,” Tony whispered, and rubbed his cheek against his own shoulder to wipe away the tear that had escaped his lashes.
No one noticed the small group of people on the hill in Central Park.  There was no reason why they would.  They were away from the crowd, and there was only three of them.  No one noticed the way one lay on the ground or the way the other two knelt above him, whispering urgently.  No one noticed that one of them was dying.
Sam pointed toward a closed door. “There’s the bathroom. Take all the time you need. We’ll make sure Morgan’s okay.”
, that Steve would see him and walk a little faster like he always did when he saw him, putting that little jog in his step that wasn’t quite a run, but was most definitely faster than a walk, just so he could get to him quicker. No, he didn’t admit that was the reason, but it was.
“Since when?” Tony snapped. He was over being unsettled and starting to get pissed off. His business? That was a fucking joke. “You’ve never given a shit about who my friends are before. You never cared who I went out with, or who I hung around with. Why is it all of a sudden your business?”
Nat pulled out of his arms, and that pulled Steve back into reality. He smiled at her, breathed out a little laugh. “Wow,” he said. “God, you look great,” he said.
“Fine,” Ross said.  “Make it quick.  I have another appointment at noon, and it’ll take three hours to get there from here.”
“Okay,” Tony said.  “But I’m here.  And Fury’s not.  So, let me give you a ride, okay?  No strings attached.  No agendas.  No expectations.  Just a ride.  Okay?  Let me do that.”
Graduation came and went. Sarah cried. She sat with Sam’s mother, the two women holding hands and crying together. Howard stood in the back. He didn’t cry. Sarah hugged and kissed Steve and Sam, then left them with Sam’s mother and found Tony in the crowd.
Steve watched him go, watched him reach Josh’s side, put his arm around him, talk to him. Steve watched. He wished he had another drink, but he didn’t order one. He just watched Tony instead. Just like he said he would. He watched him trying to smooth things over with Josh. He watched him start to sway a little, moving Josh with him until they were dancing the way Josh had wanted. Slow at first, then faster. It was a fast song. Steve had never heard it before. He didn’t keep up with what was popular in music. Not since Tony. Tony had been in charge of that. It had been his job. One of them, anyway.
Steve lifted his head and gazed up at Tony’s face, eyes filled with a yearning adoration. Tony bent to kiss his mouth. It was just a brush of his lips, and while Steve wanted with all of his entire being to yank Tony into him and deepen it until they were both panting, he didn’t. Couldn’t. Because Tony wanted him like this. Soft. Serene. Still. He could do that. He could do whatever Tony desired.
Sir Purr opened his eyes, glanced once at Steve, then hopped lightly down from the table and left the room.
Steve’s tongue slipped out of his mouth and touched his upper lip. Tony sighed again at the sight of it. He shifted in his seat, suddenly very aware of his nerve endings. “Um,” Steve said, “how ‘bout my house?”
She gripped his chin with her fingers and shook his head a little. “Stubborn,” she said in a sweet, warm tone. “Just like your father was.”
Tony stared after him, then reached out and picked up the can of Coke Steve had abandoned on the table. It was still half full. He held it in his hand, then looked at Clint. He looked as miserable as Tony felt.
He raised his hand now, and knocked on Tony’s door. Dodger was at his side, sitting on his haunches, tongue lolling out the side of his mouth. He’d thought about leaving him with his mom, but he decided to bring him instead. If they were going to be in each other’s lives, Tony would have to get used to Dodger sometime, and there was no time like the present.
