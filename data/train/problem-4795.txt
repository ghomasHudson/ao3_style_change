"You know," said Tony, panting and staring at Steve's very boring ceiling, "I'm an SI citizen. I can get you in, set you up with an interview."
Tony came out of his fugue to the smell of greasy diner breakfast, overlaid with the bright chlorophyll green of midrange nutrient shots. He put on his best pleading face, the one that never worked on Pepper but usually did on Happy, and asked, "Can I have one of those? Get the taste of chlorophyll out of my mouth."
"You gonna pee on me or something?" asked Steve, eyebrows going into his hairline. Last time he'd had an offer like that, he'd had to pay for a whole new bedding set and heal up for two days. That guy had been an asshole, though, and Tony didn't seem like it.
Tony chuckled. "Real food takes time. I trust you'll make sure to get me to take the time. I will be very happy to be bribed with sex."
"Absolutely," said Tony. He brought up a comm line and said, "Pepper, I'm taking him up to my suite for dinner and afters, can you send up a companion contract? We'll adjust the boilerplate, so just fill in some starter numbers. Yep, I was almost done reviewing the proposals when you brought me my treat, and I'll get the last few before we go." To Steve he added, "Get a snack from the bar over there, and bring me a coffee? I've got three more proposals to quick-read and either kill or shoot up the line."
They all nodded. "We're doubles, yeah. Okay, that suits us. We'll have at least one more stop before SI, so we can switch off."
Tony waved him off. "Who has time? Hiring a companion is easier, and you know, if you renew enough times it'll be a long-term relationship whether or not I'm paying you."
SI lived off those edge-case innovations, but it thrived because Pepper was there to tell people No when Tony always wanted to say Yes.
"I guess I wouldn't leave me alone in here, either," said the john with a laugh. "Oh, uh, Tony. Your file said Grant?"
He trailed more notes after the first -- the benefit of having a price-hiked luxury pet trade outside of SI, a note to engineer something good for the truckers, to keep vets on staff, and even have a bring your dog or cat or tiny dinosaur or whatever to work day. He had a feeling Pepper had known he'd like this one, she usually put something fun on the bottom of the stack.
Steve shook his head. "It all looks great," he said absently, looking at the crags outside, an artificial cliffside that had plants and even wildlife clinging to life up with the humans.
They glanced at it, shot him a look of surprised gratitude, then nodded. "Of course, pumpkin. You all squared up with the boss?"
Steve knew that hiding out in a truck stop strip mall in between claves wasn't going to work out forever, but he only had to dodge the HYDRA bounty on his head while he put together enough cred for an entree into SI clave. With a body jacked by the late Stark himself and full of Erskine regen serum, he'd have something to offer them, even if he had to go back to fighting again.
"I'd already decided on SI, if they'll have me. I met Stark once, years ago. Seems like a good enough omen, them being first on your list." Steve stood up and gave a little shimmy of his hips as he slid his jeans down to reveal his naked everything. Underwear was a specialty item in his line of work, and Tony hadn't requested it.
Steve felt that smile down to his toes, but he had another bite anyway, tasting the food before he answered. "I guess it won't, at that."
"Of course, Steve." JARVIS sounded warm but Steve couldn't guess why, without a face. Pleased, amused, affectionate? Who could tell with AIs.
"Yeah, sounds good. You really aren't too worried about me disappointing you without a trial period?" Steve waved his hand at the contract, which JARVIS popped up was for 6 months, renewable by both parties, no further trial required.
They were silent for long minutes, just taking in the quiet evidence of life beyond the corps and creds that ruled the globe now.
He ate three blue plate specials, and palmed a 250-cred chip to be a tip, as thanks for feeding him while he'd lived here he past few months. With Tony's token, he could afford to pay it forward, just as the man had said.
"That...would actually be so much help," said Steve, sagging with hopeful puppy eyes to rival Tony's. "I didn't think it was that good of a suck job, though, so why?"
"Not gonna make me cook?" teased Steve, looking at Tony through his lashes. "It's part of the chip, so I know some basic stuff."
"Good, great. One down, two to go!" Tony sipped the coffee and dove back in, pulling up the next proposal. This one was a joint proposal from bioengineering and HR to breed small pets, turning an expensive luxury into an affordable morale-booster for his own citizens. He stamped that one a big yes and added that he wanted kittens, too. Letting HR do its own proposals with the other departments had been a stroke of genius on Pepper's part.
Steve was just tugging on jeans, thinking about whether he wanted to sit down for the blue plate special or get a shot of the green and spend some time jacked in himself, when his client light bathed the room in blue and red and purple.
"Don't you know all of us on the strip have some dream to shoot for? Only mine's not too big, just a spot in a clave and good solid work. Even sex work if that's what that they need me for, I don't mind it, really." His hands were huge but deft as he helped Tony undress, and the weapons check was barely noticeable with all the groping to distract Tony's attention.
"I'm definitely gonna live up here," said Steve, unable to even play coy while watching Tony look at his quirky robot with exasperated fondness. "We'll learn to spoil him together."
Well, second to last. Last was always some thorny problem, a scientist they weren't sure of, questionable ethics, stolen patents, or once someone who was proposing they go full HYDRA and kidnap experimental subjects from outside the clave. He sighed and read the abstract, spotting at least three sketchy things about it before JARVIS even pulled up the red-flagged list of bullshit waiting inside. It wasn't criminal enough to get the researcher's citizenship revoked, but it was enough to get them flagged for further investigation. And, of course, to kill the project.
Tony gestured and the wheel spun just as if he'd grabbed a real, old-fashioned carnival prop and given it a spin. "The minions union voted for it, so, yes."
Steve tapped into his chip and brought up a little blush, loosened his stance up further. "I am. Or I was, I guess. I've got an invite to SI clave, and I'm hoping to relocate."
"Finally got somewhere to go," said Steve with a shrug. Elna was great, but he wasn't dumb enough to hint at his windfall, other than the goodbye tip. "If I can get there, anyway."
"I'll add some fancier cooking skills to my new chip," said Steve. "I, uh, have more than one slot..."
"That's mighty generous of you," said one of the quiet ones, voice rough. A smoker, probably meth lites, but most of them didn't smoke in their cabs. Steve's enhancements wouldn't let him be affected by the secondhand smoke, but he hated the smell.
A different set of highlights appeared, and Steve thanked the AI absently as he read through the choices. The elevator doors opened and Steve looked up and out over the tops of clouds, floor-to-ceiling windows showing just how high up the spire they were. "Wow," he said, stepping out. The holos politely followed him to one side, careful not to block the view.
"I, uh. I'm getting an idea," said Steve, going over to help move plates to the table. "Hey, buddy, you're a good old bot, aren't you?"
"Nah, there's a whole ecosystem in the curve of the tower. Not much that's very big, you know how rare that stuff is, but Pepper's been working on a few purchases in between my, by which I mean her, art collection." Tony's mouth ran like a water shower, a steady flow of information that was easy to turn on and bask in and forget everything else.
He clicked the com on, looking at the tech-fuzzed image of an attractive rando wearing enough tech to buy this entire strip mall. "Can you give me a minute to grab some breakfast?" Steve said, before his brain caught up to his mouth. He did not want to lose this john, not even if the guy wanted weird kinky shit that Steve would charge an arm and a leg for but put up with for that cash boost.
Tony sighed and pulled up more of the pet proposal, a whole range of animals and the cost to get started, flagging his personal top three and making a few more notes about care, feeding, and medical. All the SI citizens got health care gratis, and he'd be stupid not to extend that to the pets when it would all feed data back to the project. Anyone with a pet would get a food allowance for it, and the few people who didn't want one could get some other small luxury with the extra cred.
An awkward silence settled between them. A silence no one knew how to break. Clint and Wanda was busy glaring at Tony who was trying his best to ignore them. Natasha, Sam, and Rhodey didn’t know how to bring back the civil atmosphere. Steve looked sad and brooding. Peter, Scott, Shuri, Wong, and Strange felt awkward and imposing. Vision was impassive. Barnes looked like he rather not be there at all. T’Challa feigned a look and air of authority but he too was a bit lost. The Dora Milaje just didn’t care. They were just there to look after the King and the Princess. Maybe prevent a fight or two.
“Yeah. What can we do to defeat him?” Sam asked. A defeated look enveloped the prince. A look that horrified the entire room. Not once had Thor looked like that. Especially not before a fight. He’s the type who would recklessly and bravely charge head on, no matter who the opponent is. Anyone but Thanos, it seems to Tony.
At that moment, Tony decided. He wanted to offer Thor hope too. And everyone else. Even if that means he have to reveal his other self. His secret.
is what making really him so agitated. Not the Accords panel. Not the threat. Not the potentially world ending catastrophe.
“We’ll talk after, okay? Just for now, I want you to know that I love you. You don’t even have to say it back. I love you, Tony Stark. I really fuckin’ do.” The last bit of his sentence was laced heavily with his Brooklyn accent that it caused warmth to travel throughout his body. Fuck. Hearing the guy he’s been in love for years with say that he love him back is making him dizzy and light headed. This is something that he’s been wishing and hoping for. Now that it’s actually happening, Tony isn’t sure how he’s supposed to react or what he needs to say.
"Go and prepare the medical bay for what you need. Have everything ready in an hour. You can start the procedure after the meeting is done." With that, the Princess of Wakanda had left the room.
“Listen here, Stark. Steve is my brother. Not by blood but by choice. I will do anything for that guy. If that includes killing you for hurting him, so be it. If you so much as look at him bad, I’ll make sure no one finds your body. I will break every single bone in your body and rip your insides out. I can kill you in so many ways, some you wouldn’t even dare imagine. So be careful. Tread lightly, Stark. I’m watching you.” With that, she left with a satisfied smirk on her smile.
“I will only say this once so listen good, Stark. If you hurt Stevie, I will use this arm to hurt you. Either to break your bones, snap your neck, or better yet, to rip your reactor out of your goddamn body. Ya hear me?” His Brooklyn accent was prominent during the last bit of his statement. The genius visibly shuddered as his eyes widened in real, genuine fear. Tony nodded, too scared to come up with a snarky remark or even formulate a proper response. Seemingly satisfied, the super-soldier gave his hand one final hard squeeze before he let go and stalked out of the lab.
Though, no one can match the guilt their captain is carrying. Steve was quiet throughout the press conference. He did visibly flinch when the billionaire mentioned his name. His stomach dropped when he heard the genius’ voice crack at his first name. His heart ached when said genius corrected himself and called him Cap instead. He recoiled in his seat. The fact that a simple mention of his name can cause that crack and lose in composure tells how the super soldier is still a sour topic to the billionaire.
He always thought that he’ll be reduced to nothing but a stuttering fool when finally faced in front of the super soldier. With his hard to conceal feelings of love, hurt and betrayal for Steve, he thought he’ll be the one to be stammering and floundering with his words. It turns out that seeing the big and usually strong super soldier fold in on himself and splutter like he’s immensely afraid to hurt him, like he’s fragile and breakable and one wrong word would be enough to do just that. Well, it set him off. He’s pissed off. That ship sailed a while ago. Steve didn’t deserve to treat him like he’ll soon break by just being alone with him and talking their feelings out.
“Good. I’m glad we had this talk.” Sam gave his shoulder a tight squeeze which was supposed to be reassuring but Tony wasn’t comforted. Not one bit. Feeling suffocated, the genius gave him a shaky smile before walking away with his coffee in hand. He used both of his hands to cover and hide the fact that they were shaking. As he was near the door, Sam called out.
"There's a few claves that always need workers," said Tony, reading off some data on his glasses that JARVIS had helpfully provided, and sending back a couple of silent queries about open spots in his own clave. "Sorry, you probably didn't need any of that."
Steve was the one who kissed him this time. "I'll find you. Dunno if I'll stay, but. Being yours sounds better than this, and that's what matters, right?"
Tony's brain was still swimming with the data, with JARVIS's voice keeping him posted on the Roxxon activity and the visuals on his glasses running a hundred other numbers past him, some of them straight into his various chip enhancements to be handled on a subconscious level. He managed something like intelligent conversation, but until he dumped everything he was holding, he'd be too much up in his own head to make any kind of decisions.
The photo next to it was an artistic nude lit in antiquated bi flag colors, not that Tony minded. As long as he could get his data sent, the rest was just gravy.
Steve stood naked for a few long moments, letting the last hour settle in his mind, from the money to the sex to the offer he'd been given. The token looked genuine, and it alone would save him thousands, maybe tens of thousands of credits. The chips that the john had tossed so carelessly as a tip were even more, enough between it all to ensure a real start, even if things didn't work out with Tony.
"I like the not-chip parts of you, too," said Tony automatically. He shrugged. "Let's order up tonight, you can impress me with your kitchen skills later. Get a lacy apron with a bow right over your ass."
"If that were true, sir, you would certainly eat less from the replicator," said JARVIS. Snark, at least, Steve could recognize anywhere.
"I have become rather more than I was back then, sir," JARVIS said silently, and then added out loud. "It is good to meet you, Mr. Rogers."
"No time," said Tony with a shrug. JARVIS popped some data up in his field of view. "You're worth recruiting. Your escorts sent me good reviews and a request to get on your client roster, if you end up in business for yourself again."
"You could've told me," said Steve wryly, shaking his head at Tony. Pepper had escorted him up personally, giving Tony a wink and darkening his office windows before showing herself out again. Steve watched her with a dubious expression.
"Yep," said Tony. He stood up, trusting JARVIS to lock up his data while he got himself squared away and tugged Steve up for a kiss. "If we don't get along, I'll just put you in the companion's suite and waive exclusivity. It'll be a fun scandal, and you'll still get paid."
"All right," he said to himself, to the room he was about to leave. "All right. Pack, make sure everything's paid up and shut down, and get out of here by nightfall. I can do that."
Steve went over and helped, wanting his hands on Tony and not, for once, just to check for hidden weapons or biotech. "Don't you know all of us on the strip have some dream to shoot for? Only mine's not too big, just a spot in a clave and good solid work. Sex work if that's what that they need me for, or whatever else, I don't much mind, really."
Tony shed his suit coat and tie, coming up beside Steve to roll up his sleeves. "I like to remind myself that nature's as worth preserving as people. Plus, Pepper made me do it."
Tony stood, finished re-dressing, and got into the hidden pocket of his jacket for one of his personal tokens. "This'll get you all the way to my office. We'll work things out from there."
He made himself leave, get in the car, and peel out into the heavy flow of traffic, putting it in stealth mode and letting FRIDAY, his personal driver, take them to SI the fast way. Sometimes Tony liked the thrill of driving himself, flying himself, doing things the old-fashioned way like soldering and coding and piloting, but right now he wanted to replay the last hour of his life while his mouth still tasted like sex and kisses and Steve.
"The Wheel of Food. JARVIS invented it for when I'm indecisive, so right now it's tuned to my preferences, but he'll learn yours and take them into account. I'm told it settles a lot of lunchtime disputes down among the minions."
They waved for him to sit, and he indulged in another cup of coffee on their bill while they finished up. Elna looked pleased when they came by to freshen everyone's drinks, and Steve was very glad he'd given them a good tip. SI corp truckers wouldn't even covet his token, so that was one less worry.
Steve looked properly gratified at the offer, and made the chip vanish into the hidden compartment that Tony had clocked onto with his enhancements the moment he walked in. "Well, if I didn't have somewhere else in mind, I'd offer to just follow you home for that."
His glasses informed him he'd tipped the guy 11k, which was honestly irrelevant. He'd make billions off the data he'd just sent off, if he could get home intact to do something with it. 16K for a quick jack-and-suck was nothing.
Steve gave him a slow grin and a once-over. "For you, absolutely. You're as pretty as the shine of white ice in a data desert."
Fortunately, this jack had high-speed options, real ones, and JARVIS could sheath it all in ice so black no one would even know there was data traveling into SI's mainframes.
Steve shook his head, but he kissed Tony again anyway, those big hands framing Tony's face like he was something precious. "I don't think that's gonna be a problem, honey."
It had been a good business for him since he went both, or all ways, and actually liked getting to exercise his libido and provide pleasure as a service. It was better than killing people, anyway, and that had been his only other skill to speak of.
"And for you?" asked Tony, producing actual credit chits like he belonged in this shitty little strip mall. "How about 5K for the package?"
Tony chuckled. "First AI I ever built, and he refuses to upgrade his chassis. DUM-E, this is Steve. He's maybe gonna live up here with me."
"That's her way of telling me she forgives me for stopping to recruit you after the data transfer," said Tony with a shrug. He stood and spread his arms out, knowing the view behind him was impressive. "Welcome to SI."
Tony slipped the work back into its own lane and closed those processes off from conscious thought, smiling to see Steve bent over his own datapad. JARVIS informed him that this one had been assigned to Steve permanently, and that Steve's phone, ident, and other amenities were already waiting in Stark's suite.
Tony waved. "I'm wired up like a Christmas tree. JARVIS will hook you up, there's only a few things verboten. No assassin chips, please."
With this week's rent already paid, 5K was enough to get him into SI territory and set him up with temp space until he could figure out what citizenship costs were. "Well, if I didn't have somewhere else in mind, I'd offer to just follow you home for that," said Steve, making the chip vanish.
"Man, I bet a pet would love this view," said Steve, feeling a bit like a dog himself as he spotted some small mammal and his brain shouted SQUIRREL! "I always wanted one, but that's like wanting to fly, except these days it's easier to get wings."
In no time at all, Steve found himself in front of the man himself and holding a contract worth more cred than he'd ever seen in his life.
Tony paused to brush a kiss over that lush mouth. "Paying it forward. Plus, I wasn't lying. SI always needs good people, and I've got a good feeling about you."
"Yeah, we do," they said. "I'm Liam, my partner's Jinx. That's Mel and Sal there. We mostly got standard parts, if that matters."
"You like him, J!" said Tony, smiling. "Good thing he does, my whole penthouse is his to rule, and us merely his subjects."
"You're the best," said Steve, giving their hand a chivalrous kiss with a wink over the top and the tip underneath. "I'm all done, if you'll introduce me?"
The man moved into the room, taller than he looked, and grinned. "I really do have to use your jack first, if you want to go get food?"
"It's fine, you said you had work," said Steve. He leaned in and kissed Tony's hair, soft and warm, more affection than Tony had expected from a companion but not unwelcome. "Pepper sent in an aide with the contract, I'm looking it over while you work."
The smile he got back was surprisingly genuine; the guy must not have activated his sex work chip yet, or else he just really liked feeding people. Either way, Tony made quick work of both the food and the negotiation: he had the cred to make this guy's week, and saw no reason not to use one of the clean chips he'd brought with him to pay for this kind of thing. Well, more for the data than the sex, but he did like sex and never minded paying a professional for their time and service.
Steve laughed. "I'm sure she appreciates it." Elna led him over to a group of four truckers wearing SI jackets and hats. "Our Steve here is looking for a ride to SI. Any of you got space?"
"There's a few claves that always need workers," said Tony, staring off into those glasses of his while Steve got him out of his shirt, belt, shoes, and socks. "SI, of course, hm. No one wants to work for HYDRA, that's why they kidnap. SHIELD's not bad, very loyalist, though. They'll put you through some shit for citizenship. SWORD's worse, honestly, but if you want spacers they're the best." He blinked and shrugged. "Sorry, you probably didn't need any of that."
Steve chuckled at that, folding down to his knees and getting to work on tuning up Tony's equipment. His lips were as plush as they looked, that lower one perfect for resting a cockhead against, for Tony to run his thumb over and then lick for taste of them both under the green of their shared meal. He leaned back on his hands after Steve gave him a sultry-reproving look that went straight to Tony's balls, spreading his legs to give the man room to work.
"Sure, sure. Come on up, then." Steve buzzed him up, not bothering to put on any more clothing or even do up his pants. He wanted a chance to have that guy's fussy little beard tickle his balls, or at least to have the guy's wallet fill his tip jar.
They all turned to look at him, then. "You're the Jack In guy!" said one of them, grinning now, teeth glinting with wiring. Most truckers had their mouths wired up to minimize their cranial implants; Steve had seen them deliberately spark the wires to say awake, too.
Heyyy~ Hope you liked this! I was actually planning on making this a one shot but mehh. It just evolved to multi chapters. This may range around 20-30k? Anyways, thank you for those who are still with me! Hope you'll stay till the very end!
, whatever that means.” The red head spy asked. The official group glanced at each other before they settled in looking at Tony who knew most of the situation. Seeing that he won’t escape talking, the genius cleared his throat, which made him the focus of everyone.
“You need to try harder for Steve, Tony. He’s probably the best thing that will ever happen to you. Don’t waste this one chance with him. Okay? He deserves better.”
“N-No. Don’t call a-anyone, Fri. Just t-tell Pepper I couldn’t come t-to the meeting today. Tell anyone who asks t-that I can’t be interrupted today. I d-don’t want to see anyone, FRIDAY.” The genius said, dashing back to the safety of his lab.
“Hey, guys.” As expected, it was Sam Wilson who first offered the olive branch. The veteran must have sensed the growing and building tension in the room.
The Accords were revised and rewritten. After Tony had pretty much renounced and questioned them years ago, the UN had decided to revisit the Accords. They discovered a few sections that were not there during the writing and official meetings. That sparked an investigation which later on lead to the discovery of Ross’ hidden agendas with the Accords such as his delight to human experimentation and irrational hatred of Inhumans and mutants. He was fired and imprisoned. The Accords were written to be more friendly and lenient to heroes and mutants. It became a middle ground that both sides can agree on.
The super soldier thought, his longing gaze followed his tracks as he approached Natasha and Clint, the latter being the most injured of them all. The red head was supporting the archer’s weight as he swayed dangerously on his feet. Natasha slowly laid him on the ground as Tony knelt on his other side. He performed the basic first aid for concussion and checked for other injuries. While he did so, the others were slowly nearing and closing in. Both wanting to know Clint’s condition and also seeing Tony up close.
"Okay. Look. Whatever I'm about to say cannot in anyway leave this room. Am I clear? We'll be incinerated otherwise if someone tells on me. Okay? Okay—" The archer obviously took the engineer’s words negatively.
“What do we have here? The Earth’s Mightiest Heroes? Defeated by mere HYDRA agents? To think that this is all what it takes?” The Sokovian said, his accent heavy, his tone smug and pleased. The predatory and ravening smile on his pale face was enough to make any civilian shiver in fear and dread.
"That's too high a price!" Wanda protested loudly. She looked around the room, searching for someone to agree with her.
Tony was in the middle of screaming when the door of his lab slid open. He only heard a few heavy thuds of steps before he was engulfed in a pair of large, warm arms.
“This base must contain a lot of top grade secret because the place is heavily guarded. It’s a wonder how the villagers didn’t notice anything.” The former Winter Soldier said
“I get Spider-man and T’Challa being unavailable but why aren’t you coming?” The counselor’s tone wasn’t accusatory but rather a curious one.
The new information made the Avengers a bit wary and suspicious. This was a bit unusual for the panel.
“Iron Man! How nice of you to grace us with your presence-” Zemo snapped out of his daze as his eyes lit up in a predatory manner. His eyes suddenly glazed over with something close and resembling manic. He approached the armor and attempted a conversation before he was cut off.
"Maybe. And we're in the right place too. Wakanda is the most technologically enhanced country in the world. I'm sure with their help, we could extract the stone from Vision successfully." The engineer said, his eyes drifting to both T'Challa and Shuri who immediately nodded. The Princess also took that moment to contribute.
The media backlash was as expected. They received backings and support from the LGBTQ+ community and pretty much the majority of the population were okay with superheroes being publically out. What they weren’t okay with was who exactly was included in the said relationship. Specifically, Tony. Nobody is really okay with the idea of the most prominent playboy billionaire despoiling and corrupting the national icon. There were petitions and articles that came out about that. It enraged the super-soldier when he found out about it. Pissed him enough to attempt to march the compound’s door down and rain down hellfire on all unfortunate reporters that would be stupid enough to approach him. Tony was able to calm him down after promising wonderful rounds of sex.
“Punk.” There was no heat between their exchange which made Steve marginally better. They were bantering. Just like the old times.
“I know it was from Bruce because the message was made and sent using his personal coding and signature.” Was Tony’s easy reply. He knew that some of the Rogues are mad at him. Some of them actually blame him for their time at the raft. Barton’s snipe was something he expected. Along with Wanda’s glares.
They stopped in front of a large door that the genius assumed would lead to the council room. Standing in front of it, Tony swear he can feel his heart drumming loudly in his chest. That one door is literally the only thing that separates him and Cap. He’s going to see him after almost 2 years. The billionaire’s not sure if he’s ready. Unfortunately for him, his companions seem to realize this as well.
“Mission?” The genius asked, turning back to his work. He was currently in the middle of making a prototype for SI in his workshop when the archer decided to drop down from the vents.
“Boss? Would you like me to call Captain Rogers?” That snapped him out of his daze. The genius glanced up, terrified.
“I have a meeting with General Phillips a few days from now and then with the Secretary of Defense next week and the week after. I can’t really cancel and reschedule those.” That made both veterans chuckle.
The arrival of Iron Man had put the Avengers in an incredible advantage. With the armor’s weapons and repulsors, FRIDAY and Falcon’s input, they were managed to push back the HYDRA agents. From what seems like a hundred, they were reduced to about a quarter of that. Seeing that they were losing, Zemo had his men prepare an escape route.
Seeing Zemo now, free and well, sparked a deep, vicious hatred in him that he would have been horrified at any other day. A side of him that he didn’t know he possessed. In front of him was the man who took Tony away from him. Steve wanted nothing more but make him pay for every pain he caused him. Them.
“Captain, do not attempt to talk to Iron Man.” He was cut off when he heard an Irish female voice on his comm. FRIDAY, Steve’s mind supplied.
"Thank, God. I thought I'll be subjected to another lengthy lecture again. I swear. That lady can scold someone's ear off." The genius exhaled. A memory of the last scolding he got from the old lady made him shudder visibly.
“Spacecraft? Shit. Are they friendly? Did they initiated contact? Sent a message? Declare intergalactic war? Anything?” He was frantically typing on the technically advanced flat surface, as his other hand reached out to press the Avengers button to call an immediate Assemble.
The team traveled to Catalonia, Spain that night. They were using the Avenger jet, the most advance and state of the art jet aircraft in existence which robbed off a good 2 hours from the expected travel time. The jet was amongst the things that Tony Stark had generously left them two years ago, alongside the Compound, some new weapons and other important things, like funding, that are needed to assure that the Avengers can continue on with their work.
“How’s Clint doing?” The Captain of the team asked as soon as he saw the red haired spy enter the debriefing room. The somber and solemn expression on the woman’s face was enough to tell that it wasn’t good news she’s carrying. That effectively created a grim atmosphere around the room as most of the occupants slumped further on their seats, worry displayed on their faces.
“I’m sorry, my friends, but this is a battle that we might not be strong enough to win. Thanos is simply impossible to kill.” The God of Thunder said, causing dread and disbelief to swim around the room. He had on such a lost and beaten expression. It was unbecoming especially for someone so courageous like Thor. His mood effectively sucked out the hope on everyone else around them. Tony, while feeling a bit uncertain, refuse to give up just like that.
“Woah there, Big Guy. Aren’t you being too pessimistic? Let me tell you, Point Break, that isn’t really doing our already fragile team morale any good.” The genius asked, raising an eyebrow at the demigod.
Tony shouldn’t really be surprised when he stumbled upon Natasha on his way up to the dining area after being locked up in his workshop for 3 days straight. The billionaire was a second too late to realize her presence so he failed to hide the gasp from escaping. The assassin didn’t say anything about his reaction but she did raise an eyebrow at him.
The email listed a few tech and blueprints that he needs to do by the end of the month. Analyzing the list, he found that they weren’t much of a hardship. Things he could do in a week’s time. Satisfied that it wouldn’t affect much of his time, he opted to close the email when the bottom part caught his attention.
"Now that's dealt with, what do we do with Thanos?" Rhodey asked. Tony felt his gut twisting at being reminded of the Titan.
Clint, Scott and Sam were now being held down by them. They were struggling immensely as they tried to restrain. Vision and Wanda were being targeted most aside from Steve and Bucky.
Tony shouldn’t really be surprised. Natasha and Steve always did have a familial relationship. Somewhat a brother-sister type of bond. It was only natural that she would give him the shovel talk. What he should be surprised about is the fact it took her this long to give it. It’s been two weeks, almost three, since they announced their relationship after all.
“Everything.” That made the genius take an involuntary step back. His earlier rage had immediately simmered down as shock and confusion made its way through his system. He couldn’t possibly be hearing this right? Either he’s hearing things or Steve’s lying. That’s got to be it because there is no way that Steve would mean-
“Is everyone here?” The Colonel jumped immediately to business. Their small group had ventured through the majestic and luxurious halls of the Wakandan Royal Palace, heading towards the main council room. The insides of the castle was even more beautiful than the outside. Yep. Annabeth would seriously kill him for not inviting her here. And Percy would just stand back and watch him suffer, cackling like a maniac instead of appeasing his wife. Same can be said for his brothers and sisters.
He was pulled out of his reverie when the crowd of reporters that had been haggling the guests with questions suddenly swarmed towards the entrance of the hall. He frowned curiously and glanced in their direction, trying to see what had piqued their interest.
Tony smirked and pulled his hand back finally. Steve didn’t know why that left him feeling a little empty inside.
He was lost in thoughts of the old days, galas with the Howling Commandos after raids, music playing, Bucky going around flirting with all the available ladies...Peggy… He sighed. That chapter of his life was closed now. He needed to accept that. In some ways he had. He just had yet to move on. He didn’t know how he planned on doing that.
That’s when he noticed the manila folder sitting on the counter. He narrowed his eyes at the intruding file, his movements careful and calculated as he picked it up and opened it.
A tap on his shoulder had him spinning around in surprise, the fight or flight mode he instantly fell into nowadays in control when he came face to face with the very man he’d been staring at moments ago.
Steve tugged a bit at the collar of his suit. The suits of the 21st century were tighter than what he was used to. That or someone had gotten his measurements wrong when SHIELD had this tailored for him. Either way, it was stuffy and unpleasant. Much like the event itself.
“Uh yeah. Then...I guess you can call me Steve,” he said in return, and he felt his lips twitch unnaturally. It took him a second to realize that it had been a smile. He wasn’t sure how long it had been since he’d done that without it being forced.
Every other week on Thursday at 12:00 P.M. sharp, a SHIELD agent would come by to see him. They would ask him how he was adjusting. Fine. They would ask if he was finding everything alright. Yes. They would end by asking if there was anything else he needed. He would simply shake his head instead of asking for his life back like he wanted. He knew SHIELD didn’t have that kind of power. No one did as far as he knew.
“Well, Steve, I have to get back to schmoozing some money out of our potential co-benefactors. I think having Captain America at my side might be an asset,” he hummed, waving at the waiter who handed him his own cut crystal decanter of whiskey.
While he sat there, he would draw. He’d picked up a leather bound sketch book at a small shop on one of his earlier outings along with some charcoal pencils which he carried with him everyday. He’d sketch what he saw, capturing still images of the always moving world around him.
He’d stroll around the city streets, keeping to the side so as to not be in the way of the many busy-bodies that buzzed around in a rush to get to places Steve didn’t know. He’d discovered an outdoor café during one of his excursions and had included it into his routine, stopping there for a sandwich and a coffee everyday for lunch. He always sat at the same table, in the same chair with the same view. It was a construction site for a building taller than any around by the looks of it. Steve found the construction site to be a staple in his life. Everyday something would have changed about it. Grown. It was the only thing in Steve’s world that changed. The only thing that grew.
“Besides. These things are typically less excruciating in good company,” he said, waving his shades with a careless ease, hooking them on the collar of his shirt.
His feet took him to the bathroom, and he showered himself off in less than five minutes as he always did. Water bills were more expensive now too. Everything was. And since SHIELD was currently taking care of his financial needs, or so he’d been told at the briefing he’d sat through, he wasn’t too fond of overspending money that wasn’t his.
He’d ordered himself a whiskey that he didn’t plan to drink (it was more for show anyway) and slunk by the bar, trying to stay out of everyone’s way. He might have been physically stronger than everyone in the room, but he felt like a little kid from Brooklyn right now. Like anyone of these people could run him over and not even see that they’d done it. It wasn’t exactly the same though. This time he didn’t feel like he had the confidence to go up against any of them if they did.
There were over a hundred people and their plus ones milling around the gala hall. Every single one of them was dressed black tie formal, as was the dress code, and held themselves with an heir of superiority that made Steve squirm in his skin. He didn’t belong here. Surrounded by people that clearly had more money than they knew what to do with, representing an organization he wasn’t familiar with.
“Captain Rogers, if I’m not mistaken? It’s a pleasure to meet you. Tony Stark,” he introduced, holding his hand out to him. Steve blinked a couple times dumbly before realizing he hadn’t moved, and shakes his hand firmly.
His five minutes were up and Steve dutifully turned the water off. He stepped out and toweled himself dry before changing into the standard issue sweat pants and white T-Shirt that Shield provided him a couple pairs of. He picked up his takeout from where he’d set it by the front door over to the kitchenette on the right side of his apartment.
It was then that the man’s red tinted  sunglasses came off, revealing rich chocolate eyes that he remembered on someone else that had been just as captivating…
He’d stay at the café for hours, watching the people come and leave and pass by. He’d watch the cars on the road buzz with impatience as they inched along in the city traffic. He’d catch a word or two of conversation, even though he wasn’t actively trying to eavesdrop. He’d watch the construction of this mystery building continue on in front of him. He could probably find out what it was they were building. But he felt the mystery, the wait was a large part of why he was so intrigued by it.
Steve was caught on his every word as he addressed the crowd and introduced himself. Tony Stark. Lead benefactor of the Avengers Initiative. Howard Stark’s son. It felt like a blast from his past and something brand new at the same time. Steve’s grip tightened on his crystal decanter, loosening immediately when he felt the cut crystal start to splinter.
Steve heard a small, low laugh, and didn’t recognize it as his own until Tony smirked in response and cocked his head towards the rest of the attendees.
Not an option then. Steve set the invitation back in the Manila folder and set it down. The gala was only a couple days away. Fury wasn’t stupid. He knew he wouldn’t have been doing anything. Steve resented that he’d become that predictable. He sighed and started to unbox his takeout instead.
The world was moving around him as fast as it had ever been. As fast as it had been everyday he’d sat in that café and tried to capture it.
“Please, call me Tony. If we’re going to be working together soon, we may as well be on a first name basis,” Mr. Stark—Tony said.
After they left, he was alone till they visited him again. He was relieved they never asked him how he spent his days. Routine was more or less his specialty, and he stuck to the one he’d established religiously. He’d wake up at 5:00 AM every morning, brush, shower, dress, eat a bowl of oatmeal, and catch the 7:00 AM train to go to Manhattan. Staying and exploring Brooklyn was a bit overwhelming still.
He would leave the café when the construction was done for the day, his still world safe in the pocket of his jacket. He’d stop by a small restaurant to pick up his daily order of chicken breast, mashed potatoes, and broccoli before catching the train that would take him back to Brooklyn, arriving in his apartment at 7:00 P.M each day.
The man that walked through the grand double doors moved with an easy grace that made it seem like he was in command of the whole crowd. Everyone’s eyes were stuck on him as he greeted guests and reporters, letting them take their pictures and ask their questions without being fazed. His energy was infectious as he jogged up the steps onto the stage and grabbed the mic off the podium that Fury had stood at earlier when the gala started. Fashionably late then. Somehow, Steve felt that this man never arrived at an event on time. But it wouldn’t matter to him because the event didn’t start until he got there.
“I have to ask. Do we have a time limit? I mean, there’s not really much to go on with these reports but previous sightings. Searching for a lead may take a while. A week if we’re lucky. If not, it may last a month, even more. I figure that you don’t want us to lurk around Europe that long, especially if most of the Avengers are going.” The red head spy asked the most anticipated question that had bothered everyone in her team since they received the mission report. The panel exchanged looks through the screen before the Sokovian leader answered.
Tony let out a shaky breath as he slowly slid down from his stool to the hard, tiled floor. He labored his breathing, trying vehemently to calm his raging heartbeat and growing fear. He felt the panic attack trying to surface as he clawed at his tank top harshly before settling to grip his arc reactor that was peeking through the hole of his tank.
“Huh. Well, funny that. I can actually give you not just one, but two Titans that were defeated on the same day. You know what? I’ll do you better. I can even name one God, well.. Goddess that was put back to sleep after being beaten.” A beat of silence followed Tony’s declaration. A long stretch as everyone waited with batted breaths. All of them looked at Tony, waiting and tensed. Though, they were all confused.
“He’s definitely concussed. He’s barely responding at all. He also have a few bruised and cracked ribs. And from the looks of it, he has internal bleeding as well. A few broken limbs too and a sprained ankle. We’ll need to bring him to the hospital. Wilson, Romanoff, carry him to the jeep.” The genius declared, moving unto Wanda who was closest to him. She startled but made no further move to step back or away. Tony immediately set to work, expertly cleaning the bullet grazes before swiftly wrapping her arms with bandage. He done it under record time that the others needed to blink to process it.
“Will you surrender peacefully or would you rather do this the hard way?” Came the impassive, cold voice of Iron Man. It used the flat robotic voice that can send a shiver up anyone’s spine.
“Do we have an approximate count of HYDRA agents?” Steve asked, looking at Sam who nodded as he brought up a screen which displayed Red Wing’s findings.
“They did, Boss. A message was sent directly to one of SI main servers. A message I believe is directed to you personally.” The billionaire’s breath hitched as he analyzed the message that FRIDAY had conveniently displayed in front of him.
“Just to be clear, sir. We’re to investigate the suspicious dealings that are happening around Southern Europe. Find out every detail necessary, including who they work with and their motives. If confirmed that they are HYDRA or any large group similar, we engage and stop them immediately. Is that correct, sir?” Steve asked as he browsed over the report which mostly contains sightings, past locations and pictures. Seemingly satisfied, the US President leaned back on his seat and gave him a firm nod.
“Regardless, Stark and I never had a romantic relationship.” The super soldier made clear. The light atmosphere once again turned somber as the Press Conference carried on.
“New mission for the team. Apparently, there’s suspicious activity going on somewhere in Southern Europe. There’s a few gathering of suspected HYDRA agents going around that side of the continent. Also some suspicious cargo that are being transported across countries. There’s not much to go on about it, to be honest.” Rhodes explained with a shrug as Sam looked over their leader’s shoulder as he read the mission details.
“Yes. That’s my name. Don’t wear it out, kids.” Came the snarky reply that everyone seemed to have missed the past years.  Despite the dust and dirt on their faces and the tiredness of their body, most let out small smiles and breaths of relief.
It has been almost 3 years since the public proclaimed superhero ‘Civil War’. Tony Stark announced his retirement a week after that whole mess, announcing the end of the Avengers as well. Not long after, he disappeared without a trace. Many assumptions and theories had been made surrounding his disappearance. Amongst the favorites were him being kidnapped, or that he eloped with some unnamed woman, or that he’s dead and SI had covered it up. With the Earth’s Mightiest Heroes disbanded and scattered, the crime rate had almost doubled in number. The World Security Council had been running themselves ragged trying to contain the chaos.
“You’re the best, Tin Man! Thank you!” And with one big, sloppy kiss on the cheeks, the blond went off. He left with a happy skip on his step. The genius can only roll his eyes and smile a little. Though, that smile was completely wiped off when the archer poked his head back in not a minute later.
“Also, if I may interject, please refrain from causing too much property damage. We are aware that it is almost inevitable but please try to minimize and control it. I don’t think I need to remind you this but I will still say it anyway. Always prioritize civilian life. Keep the fighting away from large or populated areas.” The current president of Italy said, his brows were furrowed. His tone sounded almost concern which didn’t really surprise anyone as the Italian leader was always a soft hearted person. A firm leader but a soft person.
“He must have a good reason for doing so.” The ant themed hero threw out, though his tone indicated hesitancy.
As if a beacon of hope, Iron Man’s arrival sparked a fire in the Avengers. They all started fighting even harder than they were before. The miracle in the form of a man in an almost indestructible armor drove them to work better and stronger. It ignited something in them. It’s almost as if something snapped in them.
“Then why here? In a quiet countryside? This doesn’t seem like an adequate place for a hideout. More of a retirement plan than anything.” The archer snarked.
“You’re asking me what I think you deserve, Tony? I think.. No. I know for a fact that you deserve everything. The world. The universe. You deserve everything good and wonderful the world has to offer. And I’m sorry that you didn’t get it. It’s fucking awful and shitty. What happened to you.. Because you deserve the world but the world does not deserve you.” It was probably the complete and pure rawness of Steve’s voice that got to him. Or the genuine and softness in his azure eyes. Or the complete honesty of his statement. Whatever it was, Tony was almost reduced to tears. He bit back a sob as he looked at Steve who had chosen to metaphorically strip himself bare in front of him. This was the first time he had seen the super soldier so open and exposed. He had always been the kind of person to set up walls and barriers. Since the day Tony met him, he had never seen him this vulnerable.
coming here. ETA is 5 minutes. You can ask him then, Agent.” That made Steve jolt in surprise. He was starting to lose hope of seeing the genius again after learning that he’s not in the armor. Not piloting the suit and just sending it for FRIDAY to control is way of saying that he doesn’t want anything to do with them-
“Those were Cap’s exact words. Those were the two opposing sides during the media dubbed ‘Civil War’. Accountability and oversight or our right to choose. No side were wrong in this. It’s purely about opposing belief. The Rogue Avengers are not bad people. They don’t deserve the title fugitives to begin with. They just can’t live the life the accords are promising them.” Tony motioned one of the organizers for a bottle of water. He drank a few sips before taking a deep breath.
Clint, Natasha and Wanda were already settled at the back of the jeep. Bucky didn’t even hesitate to jump in next to them. That left Steve with no other option but to sit at the front, next to the genius.
“Zemo.” Was the one word reply of the Captain, his voice dropped down to a cold, furious tone, almost a growl, that none of his team had really heard before. They threw their leader confused and hesitant side glances.
Logically, Steve knows that he was to blame for their fall out. While Zemo had a hand in it, he was the one who kept the truth from Tony in the first place.
“Zemo’s escaping!” Steve yelled over the comms. Falcon responded and made an attempt to follow the aircraft but it just switched targets and started firing at him.
“A trusted source? I don’t have any intention to offend the panel but how are you sure that your so called source is to be trusted?” The red head inquired, her back straightened at her leather seat as she searched at the faces of each panel member for any inkling of doubt or apprehension.
invincible Iron Man? I’ve been catching up for the last 2 years, you see. I know that he retired and left. He disappeared without a trace. Such a shame that
“On that note, I will not be withdrawing the funding and donation of the Maria Stark Foundation that are directed to any Avenger cause in the past, that includes property damage funding, rescue operations, financial supports, reconstruction and medical assistances. Those will continue. The difference is that the scope of the Foundation will be larger and more global. It will not be solely just Avenger related. This time, it will be directed to all kinds of tragedy, incidents and emergencies. This aims to help a far greater amount of people.” There was nothing but sounds of writing, scribbling and camera flashes around him. Tony took a few breathes before continuing.
Tony stayed in his lab for the next two days. He only resurfaced when Steve and Barnes’ left for their weekly walk in Brooklyn. They always leave the compound on Thursdays to walk around their neighborhood just to reminisce and see the sights. They would leave early in the morning and usually come back after lunch. Sam would sometimes tag along but those were really rare occurrences since he didn’t want to intrude on their moments.
They were all gathered at one of the Palace’s lounge room in Wakanda, simultaneously agreeing to watch the press conference that Tony Stark had called for not one hour ago. The conference was being broadcasted live on almost all news channel around the world which means that the content and purpose was important. Most likely about the future of the Avengers seeing as more than half of the team are on the run and are fugitives. It’s only been a week since the break out from the raft and the world is still constantly asking what’s going to happen next.
“Sure you are. Steve’s the dad if you’re wondering. You guys are the parents of this dysfunctional family.” That remark actually caused the usually cool and collected billionaire to blush. His face and ears hint at a pale shade of red.
HYDRA used this as their advantage as they became more aggressive, using their numbers to overpower the Avengers. Not long after, majority of the team had been injured, some grave and worrisome. Clint is barely conscious, leaning heavily against Natasha as he reluctantly replaced his bow with a gun to keep fighting. The red head was supporting his weight, also using her gun to keep the agents off of them. The right side of her stomach was bleeding, probably due to the bullet that grazed her not so long ago. Wanda was using her magic to knock out as much agents as she can but she was struggling immensely due to her concussion. She was blown away and hit a tree when the second bomb gone off. She also has a few grazes from the few stray bullets that flew past her defenses.
“Miscalculated during my sparring with Clint. He taunted me by bringing Stevie into it. Pissed me off. I broke something when I landed on it but I won so..” The World War II Hero’s voice rumbled but his tone held a certain sharpness that made Tony uneasy. He hummed in acknowledgment and proceeded to work on his arm quietly.
The genius felt a sting at the corner of his eyes as fresh tears started gathering. He has been crying for almost two hours straight now. Not even crying. He was weeping and sobbing. Oh, and drunk.
“You do realize that in order for that to happen, we need to both survive. Right?” was his muffled reply as he laid his head on the crooks of Steve’s neck, inhaling his scent. With the lack of space, he felt the rumbles of the blonde’s chest when he chuckled.
Hope you guys liked it! I don't have a fixed schedule of updates, really sorry about that. Also, our midterms are just around the corner so I don't when i'll be able to write again. Most probably after. I will also update Alamort around the same time i'll update this. Hope you'll wait for that. I love you alll!
The Avengers lost a vital member of the team and its showing. What’s worse? The gap he left behind was too big for someone else to fill.
“You did have no luck with the dames back in the day, punk. And apparently, you suck at wooing fellas too.” Barnes barked out a laugh. A real genuine laugh. Steve’s lips automatically turned upwards at that sound. God, it was the first time he heard him laugh like that again. The last time was during that party with the Howling Commandos before they journeyed to the Alps.
"Nah, that's Pepper. And I let some of my R&D heads have veto power over their own areas of expertise. I'm really only king of my personal domain. Keeps me from losing perspective." Tony pulled up the next proposal in the line and scanned the abstract, letting JARVIS plop the relevant data straight into his brain once had context. It was an edge idea, minimally viable unless they could hit on the big eureka moment the proposal suggested was just around the corner, so Tony flagged it maybe and tossed it over to Pepper. Some departments could afford to try out the weird ideas, but others were already too close to their budget cap to add in one more.
His bag had been discreetly shuffled away, likely to be thoroughly checked for contraband before being delivered to, well, wherever. He'd half expected to be shuffled off the same way, but instead, here he was on the way to Stark's personal quarters, a whole penthouse apartment full of whatever it was rich CEOs needed all that space for.
The bed wasn't neat, because it was also the only place to sit, but it worked for truckers, and, apparently, Tony, who plopped right down and pulled out the sleekest rig Steve had ever seen. "I won't be long, get me a green shot, too?"
Steve shrugged. "I can work while you guys drive, assuming you're pairs." Driving used to be a loner job, but corp trucks were targets, and it helped to have a second person to man the guns if it came to that. Cheaper to pay for an extra driver than lose the whole shipment, usually.
"I can order up," said Steve. "Perk of the room." The cube-rooms were rated for business and residential, and they weren't all or even mostly selling sex like Steve -- there were hackers and crackers, mechanics and off-license wetworkers, and even a couple of fortune tellers, though one of those also sold sex with your future.
That surprised a snort out of Tony. "Well, that's a new one. But you're at a truck stop, I'm pretty sure you can find a ride."
"Good arm candy is hard to find," said Tony with a shrug. He dug into his food, looking pleased as he chewed, swallowed, and took a sip of his drink. "The rest, well. If you actually find your bedroom duties onerous, I'd prefer you opt out. I can pay someone who likes it easily enough."
Steve shrugged. "I'm good either way. I've got a very talented tongue and I can use it on most any of the mods I've seen, except the one guy with the spikes, and we found a way to work around it." He winked salaciously.
"You are gonna do just fine with SI," said Tony, eyes, roaming over Steve's body. "You're practically built like the poster boy."
"So, what do you feel like having? I can get anything, usually I make JARVIS pick. Oh, uh, that's my main AI, I built him when I was fourteen."
"That's fair," said Steve. He knew that a high-end companion was considered more worthy of a man like Stark than some normie, and if Stark married it would be for the good of the corp and clave. The problem was, Steve wasn't a high-end companion. "Can I get an upgraded chip through you? My companion chip is fine for truckers but it seems like you'll need me for more than comfort and pleasure."
"More than you'll ever know," said Tony with a sigh. "Use it or don't. You'll understand when you get there, anyway." He resettled his glasses and checked himself for everything from viruses to bugs, finding that he was clean of anything but a little spit in the expected places. "Thanks for the service, it was worth every cred."
"Of course. I'd never hurt you that way," said Steve, sliding out of the booth. "I even ran the deep-clean cycle, the whole room one."
Steve laughed, as he was meant to, which led Tony to hope he hadn't activated the chip yet and was still just being the earnest guy Tony had first met. Not that he minded the benefits of the sex worker's chip, or really it sounded like Steve had a full companion's chip if it gave him cooking skills, too. But he liked it when people laughed at his jokes for themselves and not their programming.
"I will have a selection of data gems sent up for you to choose function and setting, sir." JARVIS's voice almost sounded like laughter, which made Steve smile. A sassy AI seemed like a good sign that he wouldn't hate it here.
He wasn't sure which way he preferred to sell his body, if he was honest. Selling sex to truckers wasn't as bad as he'd feared, when they were all just looking for a quick fuck-and-connect, to jack into his body and then into the secure hard line he paid a premium for. He liked sex well enough, and he'd gotten good at it, enough to make it enjoyable for everyone when he wanted that, or quick when he wasn't in the mood.
Today was apparently one of those usual trips when Sam didn’t come, Tony realized, as he saw the man in the common room when he entered for his morning supply of coffee.
Tony’s aware that he just revealed centuries’ worth of secret but he can’t worry about that now. It wasn’t just his world that’s in danger. The whole god damn universe is at risk of being destroyed by a Mad Titan who wants to play God. He’ll be damned if he let him get away with it.
Being reminded of the genius was such a hard thing for Steve. They used to be so close before the whole civil war happened. They were friends. Close friends, in fact. They spent so much time together. They would go out for lunch, sometimes dinner. Breakfast wasn’t an option because Tony wasn’t a morning person. They would go to museums or watch games. They bonded so much after that Battle in New York. Steve was utterly devastated and horrified after Siberia. He couldn’t really blame Tony for reacting the way he did. In a way, he did betray his trust. He lied by omission.
Constant monitoring of the threat to friends' lives was the only thing similar to the obsession in which he invested after his abduction. He didn't care so much about his own life, because he knew that others cared about it, but he would never forgive himself if his loved ones were hurt.
The boy sighed, left his jacket and shoes as far away from their "guest" things as possible, and headed for his father's office. When he had the last corridor to pass, he heard something that made shivers ran down his back.
Enough. Enough thinking about Steve. It won't change anything anyway, and thinking about him was horribly painful.
"Master Stark, you have got on the phone four missed calls from Mr. Rhodney and eighty-six from Miss Potts."
Stark nodded, glad to know that there was no sign of the reluctance Barton had given him recently. He turned to Coulson instead:
"I wanted to include him in project A, but Fury said he had to think about it. That in its current state Banner is too unstable to make such decisions. Unfortunately, I had to agree with him."
As if that wasn't enough, Rogers muted the sound every time the ad spot started. There was absolutely nothing worse than having him so horribly close, hearing his pencil scraping against paper and his breath...
Tony didn't know what to do with himself. He took a strategic position on the edge of the sofa and tried to focus on the screen of his tablet. The fact that Steve was doing exactly the same at the other end of the sofa (but he was using a notebook and a pencil) did not lift his spirits.
He glanced at his watch; it was only four PM. Maybe he could still find Bruce in the lab. Then (including the appearance of his new crush) he could count this day as a triumphant one.
"Meanwhile I'll face Coulson," the boy replied, smiling at the very corner of his mouth, which didn't foretell anything good.
"You probably won't enjoy it, but you will lose your scholarship," Steve finally said, coming closer to him and leaning his hip against the edge of the desk, forcing Tony to look at him. At least he tried to force him, only he didn't succeed. "Fury also suggested confiscating all your... wonderful devices."
"Last year I was kidnapped by a terrorist group. They tried to force me to build a weapon for them, but I managed to escape. That's all."
"Don't be so modest. Everything you do is unique," Pepper snorted, almost bursting with pride. She behaved just like an older sister, whose younger brother just learned to ride a bicycle without training wheels. "How's the armor?"
"The mutations have stopped, Master Stark. Atrial fibrillation as well. Adrenaline levels are still high. I noted contact with the voltage from the stun gun invented by you, sir."
Well, he was wearing an idiotic superhero costume, but he definitely wasn't the worst Tony could see. Contrary. Golden, combed back hair, blue eyes, firm jawline, and sharp cheekbones. The navy blue costume, reminiscent of a uniform rather than kitschy spandex, only emphasized the unreal perfection of the man waiting at the door.
"So, listen," Pepper began, finally getting to Tony, hidden in the shadow of his favorite tree. "His name is Steve Rogers, he is twenty-one years old and he has the rank of captain, he grew up in Brooklyn, he likes sport, literature, old films, Frank Sinatra and painting. There is no girlfriend, and although several candidates have already applied, he has no interest, so maybe there is a chance..."
Pepper and Rhodey looked at him in horror. It wasn't his father's behavior that worried them, just how Tony would handle it. Well, it wasn't the first time he was after a sleepless night, so it couldn't be that bad.
"Jarvis, I left Coulson's project on the desk. Could you upload it to the database and prepare a list of necessary items?"
On the way to the laboratory, he also caught a coffee machine and took the two largest with all possible additives (he affectionately called it fuel, which always made Bruce laugh). Armed with that, he went to visit his friend.
"How's it, Agent Coulson?" Fury asked. He didn't have to speak loudly. Everything around him died down immediately.
"Do you want me to turn an impact stun gun into an arrowhead?" He asked, looking up from his sketches. "How much time I have? And if I am allowed to know where such an order comes from?"
The office door was slightly ajar, allowing a streak of disturbingly bright light to escape into the corridor. Maybe he shouldn't bother them now? Their hushed laughing voices were so unambiguous... On the other hand, they should have closed the door, and besides, Father wanted him to come in, right?
"I thought you wouldn't ask," Steve laughed and gave Tony an enchanting smile with the power of turning knees into cotton.
The chances that anything will flourish between young Stark and Rogers have dropped to zero. Tony did absolutely everything to achieve this: at school, he hid in workshops and laboratories, and at home, he didn't stick his nose outside the door of his rooms. It was a pity that he couldn't see Banner as often as he would like, but he explained the situation to him and hoped that his friend would at least try to understand it.
"He will hurt you," Tony whispered. With every moment everything burned more and more. Didn't Steve see that? "He always hurts everybody. He didn't do it on purpose, but no one was ever happy with him for more than a few weeks. And I didn't want him to hurt you."
He wasn't looking for anything odd. There was no need for that. He immediately turned his eyes to the painting behind which the safe was hidden (yes, it was very clichéd, but that was the element of a joke), and he groaned in horror.a
He laughed so loudly and so honestly that Stark stopped understanding anything at all. Torn from the Rogers' magnetic influence, he jumped from the sofa and tried to escape, but Steve quickly grabbed his wrist and pulled him closer. Tony struggled and pulled away for a moment, but finally gave up.
