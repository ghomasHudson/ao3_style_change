Dean chuckles a little, feeling flustered under Cas’ fond gaze. Cas looks at him like this all the damn time - even after they fight, sometimes
Claire’s leg heals up perfectly, but she sticks around a few days more. She doesn’t care much for gardening but she loves smashing shit up with Dean in the unfinished rooms. She’s good at patching up walls, bad at painting corners, and has extremely strong opinions on Dean’s taste in music. Dean knows that Jody’s has been her home for a long time, and that Claire spends every night holed up on FaceTime with Kaia, so he savors his time with her with the knowledge that it’s only temporary.
Dean slams his hand onto the countertop. Cas’ hand jerks in his grip.
, or as normal as they ever could be.
Then there’s the house.
Somehow, they found peace.
“We’ve finished our room.” Cas informs Jack. Dean catches the excitement in Cas’ voice and listens in again. “Now we can start on the third bedroom.”
“The color.”
finished the room, even though Cas hasn’t picked up a hammer or a sander in months.
“Hey, handsome,” Dean says brightly. Cas regards him with a blend of warmth and wariness, as he always does when he knows that Dean wants something.
It wasn’t until they all left The Bunker that Cas had gone quiet.
Cas says no.
Two almost finished bedrooms. Except, unlike The Bunker, there’s no Dean’s room and Cas’ room. It’s
“You’ll live.” Cas replies breezily. Dean knows this is Sam’s fault somehow.
Slowly, they pulled themselves together again. Dean stopped looking for hypothetical cases and stopped dreaming of pulling monsters apart with his bare hands. Cas made friends with the old ladies that frequented the grocery store and found that he preferred sweaters and soft fabrics to button-ups and ties.
.” Dean turns his head away from the road just enough to give Cas a little glare, hoping it conveys just how adamant he is about
“Where are you gonna go?” Dean asks, expecting Sam to go on some long-winded monologue about some city they’ve researched to hell and back.
“When I die and go to Heaven,” Cas says, and Dean feels like he’s swallowing glass at the thought. “Jack has permission to restore my grace if he feels the need for another angel. Until then, I’d like to stay as I am.”
Fatherhood makes Cas lighter. Once Dean knows to look, Cas laughs all the time. Dean doesn’t think he’s ever felt anything better than the first time he says something stupid and watches as Cas looks down at the table, shaking his head, and laughs.
Cas had saved Dean’s life with the knowledge that he would not survive it himself. He went willingly and with a smile on his face, secure in his belief that Dean did not feel the same way, but also secure in knowing that he’d never have to find out either way.
Cas thrives, and Dean takes to falling asleep with a bottle of whiskey in his hand.
“I wrote ground beef, not ground turkey!” Dean tosses the package at Cas, who catches it effortlessly. “And I damn well know I didn’t write down
After dragging Sam back from Stanford, Dean didn’t ever think he’d know how to let Sam out of his sights again without feeling anything but debilitating guilt and worry.
“You’re damn lucky I don’t keep a gun on me anymore.” Dean says, and pulls Jack in for a hug.
“Oh, fuck you!” Sam laughs, flinging a leaf of spinach on Dean’s pizza in retribution.
The inside was a different story. Peeling wallpaper, half finished renovations, water damage, the whole nine. Sam and Cas had blanched at the sight of it, but Dean harassed them about it for a few days, and eventually they saw his vision. It turns out retirement agrees with Dean. They now have a completed living room and bathroom, a semi-functional kitchen, and two half-finished bedrooms.
“I don’t want you to thank me, Cas.” Dean grits out. “Thank me for what? I knew I should’ve gone with the kid to get you. I don’t give a fuck about keeping the peace. I would’ve
Dean hadn’t been back to the basement since Cas was taken from him. Knowing Cas could no longer hear him through the walls, Dean had gone back in, destroyed anything he could get his hands on, and screamed and screamed and screamed.
“I’m very happy.” Cas assures him. His eyes light up, a little mischievous and a little cocky. Dean perks up immediately. “Why don’t we go to bed now, Dean?”
“I like having her here.” Cas admits. He leans closer to Dean, titling his head up so Dean can kiss him quick. “I just don’t want her to be in pain. I don’t want any of you to be in pain.”
It’s still too quiet.
“It’s too quiet now.” Cas complains, almost whiny, leaning back against the passenger’s seat. “Don’t you think so?”
Cas gives him a wide berth at first. He takes to being human effortlessly. Unlike the times before, there’s no adjustment period or resentment. Sam teaches him how to make basic meals, and Cas sets off the fire alarm twice. Cas goes to the store by himself and comes back with new clothes in different styles, cycling through them to try and find what he likes. Jack spends extra time in The Bunker, checking over Cas to ensure there are no side effects, and getting Cas’ opinion on the goings-on of Heaven.
“We should get a cat.”
So Jack came back to Earth with Cas, and Cas came back to Dean without his grace.
, having his son running around Heaven and Earth by himself.
“Well, as long as you’re happy, Cas.” Dean says. He means for it to be a joke, but it comes out a little too sincere to pass off.
Instead, Sam says, “No idea.”
“I like many colors.” Jack says contemplatively. “Can I pick more than one?”
Sam and Eileen’s home is outdated and smaller than Dean and Cas’, but still spacious and warm. Sam calls it a starter home - whatever that means - but it’s close enough to The Bunker and came with a big yard and a garden off to the side, fenced in so Miracle can’t destroy it. Dean and Cas helped them paint and remove wallpaper, and Sam and Eileen have slowly been filling it with furniture and knick knacks. There’s a room in the back with magic supplies that Sam wanted to keep close, and another room filled with books and artifacts that were either too useful or too dangerous to leave behind.
“You shouldn’t eat these, Dean.” Jack says solemnly. “Sam says you’re too old and that they could clog your arteries and kill you.”
“Dean,” Cas sighs, looking up at him with his hand propped underneath his chin. “I know, despite everything you’ve seen, you struggle to understand why I gave up my grace so easily. I would think our years together made it clear that there was no happiness in being what I was. Being powerful had its benefits in battle, in hunting, but that’s not my life now. That’s not me.”
, Cas had said. He showed Dean pictures of idyllic towns, of bustling cities. Cas likes mountains, and forests, and lakes, and anywhere with lots of green. Cas thinks they’d like the snow.
“I didn’t want to make you uncomfortable.” Cas admits, dropping his voice to match Dean’s. “I don’t want you to feel like you owe me, Dean, or that things have to change. I want to be here, with you and Sam, as your friend. As I’ve always been.”
” Cas interjects, teasing now. “I do enjoy a road trip.”
Cas comes in with his arms full of grocery bags, shooting Dean an unimpressed look when he doesn’t get up to help him. He lays it all out on the kitchen island, and Dean starts rifling through the bags to see what made it home and what didn’t. Dean’s grocery lists are immaculate, but Cas tends to go rogue.
The Empty give you back. Or better yet, I should have found a way to destroy it, whether Jack wanted me to or not.”
“I want them to change.” Dean says. “You understand, Cas? I want them to change.”
Dean has hobbies. He’s perfecting his recipes, for one. Hell, he’s even reading more now. He has a goddamn library card.
The Bunker has become Sam and Eileen’s little Hunter’s Headquarters. Hunters come and go, filling in the empty bedrooms and lending helping hands. Sam and Eileen only ever stay if they’re too tired to drive back to their little house just outside of Lebanon. Dean wasn’t looking, per se, but he happened to stumble across a property close enough to Sam to warrant frequent visits, but not so close that he felt he was hovering. The farmhouse was idyllic from the outside - wrap-around porch, lots of land, and a garage big enough for a second car if Cas ever felt inclined.
You can’t beat the classics, Sammy.”
, Dean, Trader Joe’s.”
grew these zucchinis, even though Cas hates when Dean stomps around their garden and disturbs the plants’ peace. Dean gives Cas a hard time because it’s too much fun to just ignore it, but he loves the sound of it. He loves that the old couple from the property next door leaves Thank You notes signed
“I was born in Kansas.” Sam shrugs, taking a sip of his beer. “Doesn’t mean I need to stay here forever. We had fun in California, and Eileen wants to check out Washington. Maybe we’ll even head East. We’ve never really gone anywhere without having to hunt. Isn’t that the great part about all of this? We don’t
Cas’ nose scrunches up when he laughs.
Cas is wearing a dark blue sweater. It makes his eyes look almost eerily clear and bright. It’s not quite a V-neck but it’s low enough that Dean gets an eyeful of collarbone. He was going to ask Cas to move his damn fertilizer out of the way, but suddenly Dean is angling towards something very different.
“I love you, Cas.” As soon as Dean says it, he understands how Cas was able to die with a smile on his face. It’s a freedom he didn’t know existed. “I love you, of course I love you. How could you even think I didn’t?”
Dean and Cas both jump, Dean almost losing his footing and braining himself on the countertop. Dean grumbles out,
two more episodes before Cas comes back in.” Dean grumbles. He lets Sam pull out all the ingredients for the homemade pizza even though he knows where everything in the kitchen is.
Jack knows how to restore Cas’ grace.
“The Bunker?” Dean asks, though he knows they rarely go anymore.
to know what’s coming. We just get to choose.”
Dean brings Cas’ hand up. The redness on his knuckles has faded, the skin now only slightly pink and tender looking. Dean doesn’t look away from Cas as presses his lips there, watching as Cas’ expression wavers between shock and confusion.
“I -” Cas clears his throat again, still focusing his gaze elsewhere. “I apologize, Dean. I never thanked you properly for your role in bringing me back -”
For the first time since Jack brought him back, Cas laughs.
whenever Cas leaves them a basket of fruits and vegetables, or when Dean takes them a pie.
“I love you.”
“Have fun!” Sams says earnestly, pretending he’s not just as engrossed on the
Cas missed Jack. Jack, who was still technically a toddler but also a celestial being of which the universe had never seen. Cas didn’t miss being an angel, but he missed healing Dean with the touch of a finger. He felt listless and useless and, like Dean, was unsure of his place in the world when he wasn’t fighting or caring for someone else. He spent hours alternating between reading books he already had memorized and staring out the window. After Eileen gave him his first plant, he spent hours out in the garden, preparing soil and planting anything he felt was viable to grow.
“Yeah, well, you know Cas.” Dean looks over his shoulder and through the window, where Cas and Eileen are signing to each other on the couch. “He wants to live by a farmer’s market. He thinks Kansas is too flat, and Claire got it in his head that he’s gonna love Trader Mo’s - ”
about?”
Cas takes it all in stride. He learns to heal in his own way.
Cas helps when the whim takes him. He’s good with his hands, but his interest in construction is minimal. He’s passionate about paint colors and in bothering Dean about finishing the spare rooms for the kids. It’s a big house, and Cas insists on giving Claire and Jack their own rooms, but they’ve compromised on completing the main bedroom and one guest room first.
“So we’re thinking of testing out the East Coast. Somewhere with lots of trees that change color in the fall, and all that shit. Vermont, maybe, or upstate New York.”
Cas’ nose scrunches up when he laughs.
It occurs to Dean then that maybe Cas is
“I love it, Claire, thank you.” Cas says sincerely. She lets him hug her then goes into the main bedroom to place the toy on Cas’ nightstand, where Dean knows it will stay.
just as Cas delightedly says,
She places a Grumpy Cat plush in his palm. It’s almost identical to the one Cas gave her years ago, the one she keeps in her duffle bag.
It isn’t the first time Sam’s told him this, but Dean still feels an acute sense of pride that he doesn’t try to shirk away from. It’s been hard fucking work, but they’re all
Dean means to say,
room. It’s Dean’s side of the bed and Cas’ side of the bed. The second room is for their
Alarming amounts of packages begin appearing at their doorstep. Claire insists it’s all things to decorate her room, and then once Jack gets wind of it, packages start appearing in his name too. Dean doesn’t know what the hell Jack needs USPS for when he can literally conjure up anything, but he keeps Jack’s packages in a pile in Jack’s room for when he visits.
“But I don’t mean to make you think staying in Kansas is a bad thing!” Sam tacks on quickly, a worried crinkle appearing in his forehead. “You and Cas have done such a great job on the house, and you both seem so happy. I promise, Eileen and I are going to visit all the time. Like, so much you’ll get sick of us.”
He never expected to see Dean again.
“Hunter or not, kids break their bones. It’s basically a rite of passage.” Dean says with faux-seriousness. He takes Cas’ face in his hands, running a thumb along Cas’ lower lip. “Let her mope in bed and eat too much junk food. It’s good for her.”
Dean leaves it there, basking in the feeling of the oven-warm kitchen and in Sam’s easy laugh. In the knowledge that Cas is probably outside, smiling, eating a strawberry fresh out of the ground.
Dean stands a little straighter. He takes a tiny step forward, still not entirely in Cas’ space but close enough that Cas starts to look nervous again.
The Winchesters - not for the rest of eternity.
“It’s just empty nester syndrome, Cas.” Dean says. He has no idea that means, but it’s what Sam told him. “It’ll pass.”
, Cas.” Dean turns the tap off but doesn’t let go of Cas’ hand. His thumb brushes against the reddened knuckles. “You shouldn’t have sacrificed yourself to save me. If you hadn’t been trying to save me from Billie,
“Oh, for the love of - you don’t even cook, Cas!”
“Hello!”
For Sam and Dean, it only took moments for Jack to zip Cas back out of The Empty.
“I told you hobbies would be good for him.” Sam says with a little grin. “Soon
they’re fighting. It makes Dean feel embarrassingly vulnerable, knowing Cas knows every part of him and looks at him like that anyways.
“Dean,” Cas repeats, a bit more urgently. “It was my choice to make. You and Sam do not have a monopoly on sacrifice. I chose to die, just as I chose to give up my grace. It wasn’t just to make The Empty happy, or to make things easier for Jack. I
“Are you worried that I’m not?” Cas asks, a hint of concern evident on his face.
Cas and Jack assured them that they talked it over, that it wasn’t an impulse decision, but Dean has
Dean’s never been good with his words, but Cas is all about communication nowadays, so Dean tries his best.
“Once you and Claire have your own rooms, you can decorate them however you’d like.” Cas continues. He pulls out one of the many paint swatch samples they have lying around the house, placing it gently into Jack’s hands. “It can be any color you want. Once the walls are finished, we can take you to Kansas City. They have wonderful furniture stores there.”
gonna force her to keep her ass down for a while.”
, losing his grace.
Cas can no longer heal Dean with the touch of a finger. He can no longer hover his hands over Dean’s body and let the glow of his grace seal a cut, or knit a broken bone back together. Cas gets colds now. He comes back from gardening with tiny cuts along his arms and legs. He gets sunburnt across his nose once, which Dean can’t stop looking at until it heals, oddly enamored by it.
Cas jumps when Dean makes his presence known, still not used to being snuck up on. He hits his knuckles against the fresh coffee pot and hisses at the burn of it. Dean moves automatically, running the cold water on the tap and grabbing Cas’ hand to stick it under the water.
“I have allergies!” Dean protests, and Cas and Claire roll their eyes in unison.
made dinner, even if Cas just set out the plates.
Dean huffs out a little laugh at the thought. A few years ago, he never would have imagined this could be his life. Kneading pizza dough in his brother’s house. A burgeoning garden in his own backyard. A
“So why are you avoiding me?” Dean asks, voice only a few notches above a whisper.
When Jack is still young (well, younger) and takes everything they say as the Gospel Truth, he catches Dean sneaking Fruit Loops out of the pantry. They’re snatched out Dean’s hands before Dean’s even got the damn box off the shelf, Jack staring at him with a grave expression, Fruit Loops clutched to his chest.
Dean puts the food away while Cas and Jack do their usual routine. Cas leads Jack to the window seat and Dean tunes out when they start talking angels and afterlife, no longer interested in whatever goes on above or below them. Rowena runs Hell with an efficiency that no one can doubt, and Jack is still learning, but has run into minimal road blocks in his own Heaven renovation quest. The angels are just happy to have someone capable in charge, someone that actually
“We said we’d make dinner.” Sam says impatiently. He takes the remote with him when he walks into the kitchen.
need to get some hobbies.”
Dean looks over his shoulder again, a little embarrassed by Sam’s overjoyed expression, and manages to meet Cas’ eye inside the house. Eileen notices Cas staring and turns around, seeing Dean through the window. She smirks, turning back to Cas and signing something Dean can’t see.
“You avoiding me, Cas?” Dean says gruffly.
“Oh,” Dean says softly. It’s not that he was expecting a hard no, but he wonders, sometimes, how an angel who’s travelled the ends of the earth could be satisfied in Kansas with Dean for company.
Cas speaks perpetually in
This close to Cas, Dean sees the color rise in his cheeks. He hears the little clearing of the throat, and notices how Cas seems ultra focused on not looking at Dean.
Dean has never seen Sam so happy and well adjusted. He and Eileen have a perpetual glow that comes with being healthy, in love, and unstressed. Sam doesn’t look at him with constant concern, doesn’t ask Dean if he’s okay all the time. Dean’s settled into retirement better than he’s ever settled into anything. He takes baths with epsom salts to ease old injuries, and he only stays in shape because Cas (and Jack and Claire and Sam and Eileen) insist he needs to stay healthy. He and Cas go for jogs, or walks if they’re too tired. Sex is its own form of cardio, though Cas insists it doesn’t count. They’re all
“Sammy,” Dean laughs, reaching over to clasp a hand on his brother’s shoulder. “You don’t have to worry about us. Whatever you choose to do, I’m happy. And besides, I think we might be finished with Kansas, too.”
They run into each other often, as people do when they share a house. At first, Dean assumes Cas is mad at him - as mad at himself as Dean is, it’s the only thing that makes sense. Cas’ sentences taper off when Dean walks into the room. They both barely manage to stammer out anything more than a sentence to each other, and always part ways awkwardly. It’s not until Dean is sober, bumping into Cas in the kitchen, that he considers Cas’ behavior could be anything but anger.
episode as Dean is.
“I love you.” Cas says it with as much conviction as he did the first time, and Dean feels like Cas just shattered him all over again.
Dean does think so. Jack comes and goes as he pleases. According to him, he comes around all the time, but time works differently for Jack than it does for the rest of them. Sam and Eileen come over once a week - more if they run out of monsters to delegate hunters to, which happens more and more often now. Sam has done away with John Winchester’s zero tolerance policy, so sometimes all it takes is a stern warning and quick magic lesson to stop some young witch from cursing the townspeople. Claire’s taken to dealing with the less diplomatic cases, and likes to drop in on Dean and Cas’ in her spare time to eat them out of house and home and do her laundry.
“Remember what Sam said, yeah?” Dean continues, reaching a hand across to thump Cas lightly on the chest. “You just need to get some hobbies.”
Dean hadn’t taken Cas becoming human well. He welcomed the familiar, all consuming anger, but for once he hadn’t had it in him to try and push it onto Cas, or Jack, or even Sam. He had stewed in anger and guilt on his own. Cas’ return had brought with it the briefest and most intense joy Dean had ever felt, but Dean still dreamt of all the ways Cas could be taken from him. He dreamt of Cas saying,
Sam and Eileen take turns maintaining the garden. They grow their own fruits and vegetables, and herbs that the neighbors think are for cooking but are really for spells. Flowers spill out all over the yard, and Cas may not have his grace but he still has his knowledge. He can name any plant with minimal inspection, and advises them on placements and how to care for them properly. Eileen gives Cas seeds to take home, and Cas plants them all with heartbreaking care.
“We do like it.” Sam smiles, relaxed in the cushioned outdoor chairs that Cas had to convince Dean to buy. Cas has expensive taste. “We’ll still do it, you know? We’ve been working this whole time on getting a good system online, so really, we can do this from anywhere.”
Cas blinks in surprise, brows furrowing, but he doesn’t even consider it before he says, “Of course I am.”
bacon.”
Sam says this one night over beers, when it’s just him and Dean on the porch of the farmhouse. Dean chokes a little on his drink, wiping off the mess with the back of his hand.
“Did you ever?” Sam teases, and Dean knocks into him hard with his shoulder. “Okay, okay, watch the pizzas! But seriously, man, Cas is doing great. You both are.”
Cas hums, contemplating this. In the dim light of the bedside lamps, Dean barely catches when the corner of Cas’ lip quirks up a bit.
“Wow, you really have talked about this.” Sam says with a little shake of his head, grinning. “So tonight, is that what you wanted to talk to
“Are you serious?” Sam asks. Now it’s his turn to look at Dean with his eyebrows up by his hairline. “You and Cas talked about it?”
It takes years for Dean to notice this. Mostly because Cas never really laughs. He chuckles sometimes, and Dean doesn’t remember when exactly Cas started smiling, but he smiles often now. When Cas is annoyed at him, he always tries his hardest not to smile at Dean’s jokes, but his lips always twitch the tiniest bit anyways.
Cas will say yes. How could he not? All Jack had to do was wave his little hand, and there Cas would be in all his glory. A full-fledged angel again.
“I want to buy some land.” Dean says. “I want to build a house from the ground-up. Maybe after I’ll even get a real job. I’m a simple man, Sammy. I want a big bathtub, a garage for Baby, and Cas at the door when I come home every night.”
And Cas, who wouldn’t even let Dean have an accent wall in the living room, just smiles and says, “Of course, Jack.”
“Cas’ll talk your ears off about it.” Dean starts heaping piles of cheese on his pizza, trying not to be offended by Sam’s own careful cheese placement. “Hell, I don’t even understand what he’s talking about half the time.”
“Great minds, or whatever bullshit.” Dean says, and Sam clinks their bottles together again. “I guess we’re all ready to move on.”
“You know what else is great?” Dean smiles up at his brother, sliding his pizza onto a baking sheet. “My pizza. Just wait until these babies are done and no one wants to touch your sad little excuse of a pizza.
Instead what comes out is, “Are you happy?”
Dean is a few years past pretending that details like this don’t matter to him. He thinks about it for the rest of the day, and then all that night, and then just about every day after that. He’s five seconds away from putting on a clown nose and acting even more of a fool just to see it again.
, Dean, he said
Cas smiles very gently, finally looking Dean in the eyes.
Dean prefers to not talk. He’d rather kiss Cas stupid and have good, quiet sex - because they’re both terrified of what would happen if Claire overheard them. But he knows now that sometimes Cas just needs to hear that things will be okay. He thinks back to all those times he left things unsaid and then resented Cas for not reading his mind. He’s not that person anymore.
“We sure sounds like a lot of people, Cas.” Dean interjects. Cas throws him a look, but doesn’t respond.
, being with Dean. Sharing his bed, and sharing a life, and compromising on movie nights because Dean’s taste is stuck in Westerns and 80s movies, and Cas has moved on to foreign language films and period pieces.
“You know, Cas,” Dean says one night. They’re side by side in their bed, Cas reading over a book on medicinal herbs. “Sometimes a broken leg can be a good thing.”
“Dean -”
The Empty was glad to be rid of Cas. Not since Gabriel had another being annoyed The Empty so much. It was the principal of the thing, though. Heaven needed angels, but The Empty was not one to give up souls. Castiel, Angel of Thursday, and Jack’s father, was the bargaining chip.  Jack could have a few angels, even a demon or two, but there would be no more interference from Jack
“Eileen is going to show me the garden.” Cas says from the doorway. Dean nods vaguely, not looking away from the television. “She says it’s attracting many bees.”
For Jack and Cas, it was a little more complicated.
Dean had to fight against feeling guilty again, wondering if Cas was now regretting his decision or if Cas truly did hate the farmhouse that much. But Cas had assured him that neither was true, and tried his best to explain to Dean how he was feeling.
Cas squints at him in a way that clearly states,
Dean rolls his eyes and looks over at Cas again, “
“I don’t want you to have to fight, Cas.” Dean says. He lowers himself to the ottoman so he can look Cas in the eye. “That’s not what it’s about.”
He doesn’t say it back.
would have happened.”
going to be the ones going to your place for garden tours.”
“You know,” She says with a smile. “Since
“I’ve already been everywhere, Dean.” Cas says, then smiles. “If I truly wanted to visit someplace different, Jack could take me. Just as I was able to transport you when you’d allow it. Of course, if I could get you on a plane, we could take a vacation - ”
a nice color, but Dean plans on giving it at least three business days before giving in and buying it.
won’t get you a cat.”
Sam and Eileen went to Paris a month ago. Before that, they had gone to California to be tourists in San Francisco. They took Cas with them that time, and Dean could’ve driven them there if he really wanted to go along, but there was something about Cas’ quiet excitement about going on an airplane as a human that Dean didn’t feel like interrupting.
“Cas. . . You don't need to go anywhere. All these things that happened should not rest on your shoulders.” Dean moved his thumb over one of Cas’ scares, tracing it softly.
“Who did this to you and why? Also why aren’t you healing this wound yourself?” Cas sighed, he knew Dean was going to ask him what happened. Of course, since he didn’t want to be kicked out, he was going to tell him the entire truth.
The Winchester looks over at the broken angel waiting for him to continue.
“Cas is that you? . . you sound awful.”
Cas decides to look over at Dean with longing eyes. He hasn’t seen him in what felt like forever, and he really wishes it was under better circumstances, but alas. It wasn’t.
“If I just helped you. . . If I just cared more about you. . . These problems could have been avoided.”
“I can’t ever fix what I’ve done and for that. . .” He pauses. Trying to stop the tears from spilling over his eyelids. He takes a shaky breath, as he looks at the man that he loves the most.
“Dean, I’m sorry,” he looks down at his worn hands, “I know I have overused this word to the point that it probably means nothing now, but I don’t know what else to say.”
“I just wish I could have helped you more Cas.” Dean embraces Cas into a hug, which causes Cas to gasp at the sudden movement.
“I wasn’t always there when you needed it, which caused all of these things to happen.” Dean’s eyes soon became misty, which caused them to shimmer as they stared into Cas’s  melancholic eyes.
“Cas, w-what they hell are you talking about?” Dean puts his hand on Cas’ shoulder, and uses the other to rest under Cas’ chin so he looks up at him. Dean can see the edge of the tears on his eyes that threaten to spill. Cas speaks, his voice breaking a bit.
“I wish. .  I wish I would have told you how much I loved you sooner.” Cas stops moving out of awe. Never in his life would he think Dean Winchester would ever say those words towards the angel. Cas moves out of the embrace, keeping his hand on Dean’s shoulders so he could make eye contact with the hunter. Dean’s face was littered with a few stray tears, that Cas decided he would wipe away.
“Please Cas. Please don’t leave me. We need you. . .I need you.” Those are the words that break the dam. Tears pour out of the sapphire eyes.
“And for that, I feel like it's my time to say. . . Goodbye.”
“No matter how many times I think I can fix something I always make it worse, and in turn you and Sam have to fix it.” His eyes become foggy with a small layer of tears.
“I really thought this time I could make everything right again. . .But we all know that never seems to be the case.” Cas looks at Dean with mournful blue eyes.
Dean sat in the bunker waiting. It had been a couple hours since Castiel had called him, and he was starting to worry about the Angel. ‘Why did he sound like. . . he just woke up? Angels don’t need sleep, so why had it sounded like he was sleeping?’ Suddenly the bunker door opened, startling Dean out of his thoughts. He saw the pale man walking down the stairs clutching his stomach and slowly making his way down the stairs. Dean was staring wide eyed at the raven haired man. “Cas?! What the hell happened to you?” Dean quickly got to Cas and helped him so he wouldn’t fall over.
************
Sam smiled softly. “Well, you did say you needed a break, Dean. Summer is in full swing, no better time to go, if you want?” he offered.
The bill stacked up as the pile of equipment at the counter kept growing. Dean seemed unfazed, even though Cas was worried that Dean would object to the cost when the time came.
“You got that right, chief. Joanna is cut from the same cloth as her mama. Did you see her back at the camp? Fought like a demon. Slit that Alphas throat like a pro.” said Benny, smiling wistfully.
He looked at the map on the wall again. Willing the pattern to reveal itself. He was missing something, it niggled at the back of his mind, but try as he might, it would not come forward. He needed more information. He needed sleep.
Cas sounded cautious.
“I'm absolutely certain that I can.” he said just as seriously. He smiled as Dean realised he'd been tricked.
“Pffft, you're a....transparent....dude.....shut up!” said Dean, indignantly.
Snagging a handful of flatbread and bowl of stew, Dean dodged Ellen as she snapped a cloth at him crossly and ducked into the radio room where Charlie was elbow deep in radio parts with a frown on her face, her tongue poking out as she concentrated on soldering something that looked complicated.
“Yes, terrified actually.” Cas said, turning to his side and propping his head up to look at Dean.
Sam grimaced. “Ew, too much information, Dean.” he griped, pissed off that Dean had beaten him to it again.
Santa tried to reassure Jack, but Jack was already calling out.
Tonight, Dean stayed awake on his own. The other Omegas had fallen asleep not long after sundown. He turned his face back to the window and brought his knees up to his chest wrapping his arms around his legs, he allowed himself to think about Sam. Had he escaped? Was he even alive? If so, was he trying to rescue him? These were not thoughts he allowed himself when around the others, it was too dangerous. Amy had taken a punch today for crying over her little boy. Dean had snapped and tried to intervene, but it had resulted in Amy getting an even more severe beating while Dean was held back and forced to watch.
Cas murmured gently in his sons ear and kissed his head gently. He looked over and met his husbands eyes with a look of pure guilt and shame.
“The rational part of me knows that he did it to fuck with our heads. Only he called it “training”. He told me right from the start that he was going to break me. If we'd have been there much longer, I think he would have. I'm trying real hard not to let that bastard win, Cas. So, I might be weird about it sometimes, but don't ever let it stop you from tryin' either. Because I know you ain't like him.” he said shakily.
Dean shrugged, bringing his shoulders up so high they touched his ears. “Nah, I'm good.” he paused to burp into his hand. “Whatcha readin'? Anythin' good? Bobby's got some good books, man. Gets 'em from all over. He don't want the knowledge lost, or somethin'. He's bin collectin' 'em his whole life.” he said, gesturing wildly towards the bookshelves that lined the room.
Later, while Amy was being helped to bathe by Jo, Charlie had tried to talk to Dean. Trying to reassure him that Amy hadn't meant what she said, that it wasn't Deans fault. But Dean couldn't shake the guilt. Deep down, he knew that it was a punishment designed by Alistair to break the Omegas, but he couldn't get Amy's hate filled glare out of his mind. He had just shaken his head at Charlie and walked away to lay on his bed, his back to the room. None of them spoke for the rest of the day.
“I'm just glad you felt able to come to me. You don't always take affection well. I worry sometimes that I'm coming on too strong or that I've upset you.” said Cas quietly.
Cas nodded, trying desperately to hide a smile as Dean staggered over to the chair and collapsed into it.
Cas huffed a laugh. “Okay then, what do you suggest? I never want to make you feel uncomfortable again. It will be easier once..
“I’m scared, Cas. I’m so fucking scared.” Dean said, his voice cracking. “When Lucifer-” a sob escaped and he took a moment, trying to get himself under control.
“Uh, tomorrow.” Cas answered, fiddling with the strap on a backpack hanging from a carabineer.
Cas pulled out, still holding Dean around the waist, he tossed the condom off the edge of the bed and guided Dean down onto the mattress, curling up underneath him so Deans head was on his chest.
“What happened?” said Sam, a half smile on his face and beer halfway to his lips. Dean looked up from cutting his chicken in decidedly smaller pieces than before “Yeah Dad, I wanna hear this” he said eagerly.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cas broke the hug first, although his face showed that it was reluctantly. “I suppose we'd better get on the road. I promised Jack pancakes and it's almost nine thirty. I didn't mean to hold us up for so long.” he said, looking guilty.
“Yeah, gettin’ warmer too.” Dean commented, gesturing to the cloudless sky. He was running out of small talk.
He saw a listing for a place called Mary’s kitchen and smiled. It promised good old fashioned home cooking. It sounded like their best shot at dinner tonight. It had a four star rating on the info guide and he hoped he could get them a table at such short notice. He walked into his room to get his phone with a grin.
Cas approached him, leaning in close, he whispered in his ear. “Besides, if you are going to brag, I’d better give you something better to brag about.” before walking over to meet Sam, snagging one of the room keys and walking over to one of the room, letting himself in.
“I know who that is.” Cas rumbled from the other side of the curtain.
“I'm worried about you Dean, even before last night. You won't tell me what happened to you at that compound, it must have been bad for you to have a nightmare about it that stank out the whole house and almost caused an Alpha brawl! I want to help you, you're my brother and I love you. Let me!” Sam ranted angrily.
. He was pretty far from fine and lying about it was destroying the family he was desperate to keep together.
The brothers ran at each other, slamming bodily against each other so hard that they went down in a tangle of limbs and yelps, ending up on their knees in the dirt.
Jo woefully attempted an innocent face “Oh, sorry. Am I stepping on your toes? Just say the word and I'll stand aside.” she said smartly.
“Yeah.” Dean said, nodding his head.
“Hey, little bro.” said Gabe, the smile softened. “Looks like I can't call you that any more, huh? You're all grown up. How'd you get so tall anyway? I could develop a complex looking up at you like this. You should kneel, or something.”
Dean sighed. His head was throbbing. He laid it back against the headboard and closed his eyes. He hadn't been able to deny even to himself the sheer level of attraction he'd felt the moment Cas had stepped out in his new clothes.
Sams recovery had been slow, Bobby had only enough medical knowledge to get Sam back to the homestead, his long term recovery needed more know how than Bobby possessed.
“Let’s get some coffee made. It’s a shame there’s no bacon left. But Sam showed me how to make oatmeal?” Cas offered, moving over to where they had set up the little camp kettle.
Dean gripped the pillow in front of him and took a deep breath as Cas climbed back on the bed, pushing Deans legs apart to make room for himself.
farming incude...”
“How about Jo?” said Dean, shifting a little to test his range of movement.
“Yes, she's a Beta. We are quite close, except for when she constantly nags me to take a mate. It's...complicated.” said Cas, frowning.
“You like that?” Dean asked.
“I won't go without saying goodbye. I promise.” said Cas, leaning in to Dean's hand in his hair.
Claire crossed her arms and narrowed her eyes. “I can see that, dumb ass.” she said snarkily. “When did this happen?” she asked, pointing between them, her face like stone.
Cas lifted his arm and twisted slightly to look down at the scar. “No, not bad at all. I would say I've had worse, but that wouldn't really be true.” he said, dropping his arm and shrugging.
Sam nodded, slightly ashamed, but grateful. With tears in his eyes he grasped Bobby's hand and squeezed. Bobby squeezed back and then slapped him on the shoulder before standing and swiping his own watery eyes manfully. “Okay, I'm gonna heat up some water, so you can freshen yourself up and get changed.” Sam nodded and wiped at his tear streaked face.
After a minute or so, she sat up with tears in her eyes and shook her head.
“What? But I can't even drive.” said Cas, looking confused.
“This is excellent. No signs of infection, the skin is knitting together wonderfully and the stitches can come out in a couple of days.” she said, reaching into the bag on the table.
Benny also took an interest when Cas began to incorporate some sort of martial art into his exercise, Jess had forbidden any sparring for the time being, so Cas performed a few Katas and battle drills by himself until Dean too found himself following the movements. Before long, everyone except Bobby and Ellen found themselves on the lawn after breakfast each morning, learning the precise but fluid movements that Cas used.
Bobby frowned “One question?” he gruffed, sounding wary.
“Yeah okay. I think it's time for bed for my white knight. You alright if I call the others back in?” he checked with Cas, who nodded gritting his teeth.
“What's going on?” whispered Dean to Benny.
Jack forgot about the tears and babbled excitedly. Telling Santa about he and his Daddy making and icing the cookies, even though Daddy had to help Jack with the icing because it was really hard to get it on the cookie and he hardly got any on himself at all. But Papa had to help him in the bath because he got some icing in his hair and he doesn't get bubbles in Jacks eyes like Daddy does.
Dean shrugged. “It is Christmas, after all.” he said with a wink. “Now, kiss me under the mistletoe like you mean it, you big dork.” he said, looking above them to where the mistletoe hung from the ceiling.
“Not here, not now.” Cas said, shaking his head. “We have no supplies.”
Dean frowned “What the fuck? Just.. What the actual fuck?” he said dumbly.
“I wouldn't count on it.” Cas mumbled giving Dean a look that said he thought Dean was crazy for even suggesting the possibility.
Claire broke the hug, wiping the tear from Cas’ face and then wiping her own. “Yeah, Jack, I’m not mad, I just have to look out for Cas. The dork needs someone to.” she said, grinning over at Jack, who looked a little relieved, as did everyone else.
“Why Sammy, you would help your Alpha to beat your helpless Omega brother? How could you?” said Dean, laying it on thick.
big.” said Charlie, assertively.
“It's okay. Sam and I used to get mistaken for a couple all the time.” Dean chuckled. “Just a matter of time before it happened to us.” he joked, trying break the sudden tension in the room.
Arriving back at the Bunker, Mary greeted them with smiles and hugs. Giving Dean an approving look as he slipped a hand into Cas’ as they walked through the bunker corridors towards the kitchen where Mary had put together a dinner of frozen pizza, cheesy garlic bread and sodas.
Dean looked at Sam in confusion. “What are you doing? I need to sweep in here.” he objected.
Dean took a moment to explain the next part of the plan in a hoarse whisper “We're going out through Alistair's quarters, it ain't pretty and stinks real bad, so don't touch nothin'.” He smiled and looked at Cas who suddenly froze and turned wide panicked eyes at the group. From the corridor they could hear voices.
Dean watched his husband and son as they swayed, mortified that Jack had been so upset at what he had seen.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ushering the group into the kitchen, he followed them in and then shut and locked the door.
He knew keeping silent wasn't an option any longer. He just had to hope they understood.
Cas turned around, his face betraying the pain he felt. Dean felt like shit for putting that expression on Cas’ face.
“Yeah, and wanting a fresh start.” said Amy, running her hands through her sons hair as he slept next to her and smiling.
“Grab some supplies, things we can eat and drink on the move. We are going to have to put a great deal of distance between us and this place before we can stop. It'll be light soon, so hurry.” whispered Cas. Dean nodded and motioned for Jo to help him.
Cas breathed a sigh of relief and smiled. “I was in charge of keeping the clan supplied with food and medicines. Basically all of the farming and trading. As an Alpha I was also expected to serve as protection for the clan. We were trained to fight from when we were children.” he said blandly.
“Something smells good.” said Dean from the doorway, he looked a little sheepish.
Breaking out into sobs, Dean looked broken. Cas acted on instinct again, pulling Dean from the chair onto the floor and into his arms. Cas tucked Deans face into his neck and stroked Deans back and neck whispering “You're safe” over and over again as Dean sobbed heavily and clung to Cas' torso.
They were both helpless with laughter, made worse when Bobby stepped out on to the porch with an annoyed expression and a muttered “Idjits.” before rolling his eyes and going back inside.
“Good evening, brothers. I have confirmation that Azazel led an attack on the River clan, he was identified by an Alpha that lost his first-born Omega to a raid by Azazel on a settlement he lived in previously. The River clan managed to deter the attack, with no casualties. Which leads me to believe that the rogue clan may try again, on one of the other plains clans or even here. It's also possible that it was an attack designed to test the River clans defences, in order to plan a real attack with a larger force.” He paused to look around the room, eyes hard and cold.
“You're mated? Since when?” barked Dean, who was now frowning.
Cas looked at Sam gratefully. “I do. I would like to know how you feel about Dean and I beginning a romantic relationship. I would not want to upset you. I love you both, although with Dean it-”
Dean looked surprised as Jess climbed into the back with him and Cas and Jo sat up front with Bobby.
Mary shook her head. “Why exclude him from seeing you heal? Knowing he had a part in it? It’ll make you stronger, having his support. Asking for help is not a weakness.” she reminded.
Cas looked surprised then gave Dean an honest to goodness
Deans eyes were dry and beginning to itch, the book he was reading supposedly had an easier way to trap a variety of monsters, but he was finding it difficult to get past the dry text to get to the really useful info. He sat back and rubbed his eyes, then rubbed his sore neck and shoulders with a sigh.
“I'll do my best. I swear, I never meant any harm on you folk. I just wanted a fresh start. That's all.” said Benny, arranging the rabbits over the embers in order to cook them.
Dean grimaced. “It don’t feel like it.” he grumbled.
“I'm fine. I just splashed my bandages, that's all.”he said to Dean and then looked at Ellen guiltily “I may have also spilled quite a lot of water. Sorry about that.”
Dean sighed heavily. He stepped towards the angel and opened his trench coat wide, looking him up and down him critically.
“No. Well, partly. It's worse now, but it's always been there, Cas. I'm just so angry all the time.” Dean admitted.
Cas chuckled. “Don't worry, I'll help you.” he reassured as they left the room.
“We'll see.” he said quietly.
“Use the pocket watch I gave you to check his heart rate every 15 minutes, if it goes higher or lower than what I told you earlier, wake me. I'm going to bathe and get changed, then I am going to take a nap. I mean it, any changes, wake me.” said Jess tiredly to Ellen and Amy. She smiled softly at Sam and then left the tent with Sam just behind her.
“I know, son. I'm damn near climbing the walls m'self. I've got the whole network looking, but whoever took Dean isn't advertising it.” Bobby adjusted his hat and sighed. “Garth has agreed to move his distillery operation here, so he can help man the radio and look after the place if we get news. The boys an idjit, but he's got something about 'im.” Bobby huffed a laugh at Sam's incredulous expression. “C'mon, the boy grows on you. You can't deny it, I saw you hug him back yesterday” said Bobby, smiling behind his beard.
“Thanks Bobby.” Sam's voice was wobbly as he continued with making breakfast, managing to rescue an edible meal out of the mess he and Jess had made while they tried to gather the courage to tell Bobby that they were mated.
Cas paused outside the door to the dorm, the wide keyhole made it obvious which key was used for this door. Sliding the key in and turning the lock, he paused as Dean tapped him on the shoulder. Turning around, he realised Dean was signalling for himself to go first. He nodded and shuffled back allowing Dean to open the door and step in before him.
Cas shook his head. “I can’t swim, Jack. I also didn’t bring anything suitable to swim in.”
“Awww! Thanks man! I'm so glad Dad didn't listen when I asked for a pony instead of a brother.” joked Dean as he sat at the table. “Asshat.” said Sam, grinning at his brother as he too sat down.
Comments and kudos are accepted here.
“Good morning.” Cas rumbled. His voice impossibly deep.
so.” he said gravely.
“C'mon, let's pack up and get ready to get the fuck out of this shithole.” groaned Dean as he heaved himself up, slapping Sam on the shoulder.
“Okay, but I swear, Sam. This is just between us, okay?” Dean said, his throat thick.
Dean frowned “Is he alright?”
“I'm good. Couple of bruises, but that's it.” she assured him.
Cas nodded. “None taken.” he said hurriedly. “Okay, whenever you are ready, Dean.” he dropped to one knee at the side of the bed. “I'll send you to sleep for two hours, I can also help you sleep tonight and for as long as you need me to.” he promised, his eyes soft.
It has come to my attention that someone has stolen this story and is posting it on Wattpad under the user name of Shaygirl1D, as their own work. Don't do that, it's a shitty thing to do. I've reported it.
“Cas, lemme stop you there. I have no problem at all with you and Dean. I love you like a brother, dude. I just want you both to be happy. I admit, I’m scared that you’ll both get hurt, but mostly I’m just really happy.” he said, pulling the angel into a hug that would have hurt a normal human.
“Sure, just be careful with my Baby.” Dean warned, making Sam roll his eyes as he climbed into the drivers seat.
“I told her already... knock it off! I'm asking him!...Anyway, as I was saying, I told her already, but she wants to hear it from you, it's okay if I bring a few people back with me, until they get on their feet, right? They got no place else to go.” said Dean, as Charlie wriggled impatiently.
“I dunno- I can’t-” Dean stammered, flushing with embarrassment.
“You will, after.” Cas promised.
This chapter is mostly fluff, but a set up for some future chapters. I have the next 4 or 5 chapters outlined.
A look of understanding crossed Deans face. “I get it. I think I do anyway. Your clothes are part of you and how you see yourself. That's cool, I'm the same with my car. But,
“Don't need to, I just know. But I get it, you don't know him like I do. If you want I'll call him now if you need to hear it from him yourself. I promised I'd fill him and Sam in anyway after we made camp. So, now I know what the plan is, I can tell 'em.” said Dean, smiling widely and standing.
he said, his voice low and angry.
I'm sorry that it's been a month, my laptop decided that it fancied a new career as a paperweight. It didn't even die a heroes death, it just keeled over as I edited another fic that I'm writing.
“I can always push her out if she gets stuck.” Cas assured him.
“Dude... I didn't know... I didn't know they were in there... I swear... I'm so sorry! Please, please don't kill me.” said Sam, simultaneously begging and trying to hold back laughter and failing miserably.
Cas groaned quietly and Dean gripped a little tighter.
Dean shifted from foot to foot looking down. “Well, we figured you'd want to get there quick. It'll make it easier for you to ..uh..come back too. What with you bringin' Hannah and all your stuff. I left the radio in there so you can still call us and let us know how you're doin'.” he stuck a toe in the dirt “Y'know, if you want to, 'cause we'd worry about you otherwise. He said, avoiding Cas' eyes.
Sam nodded. “So, where's Cas now?” he asked, nervous of the answer.
Dean smiled. “That’s great, Sammy. Bobby would have liked that.” he said genuinely pleased for Sam.
“Eww! Dude, just, no.” laughed Sam leaping further out of Deans reach onto his bed and throwing a balled up t-shirt at his brothers face. The t-shirt unravelled mid-flight revealing a pair of used underwear that draped themselves over Deans shoulder, whilst the t-shirt struck his chest and dropped to the ground.
John stood there patiently in the fading light, knowing he had taught his sons better than to open the door before checking.
The sounds of soft breathing were the only noises as one by one, the group fell asleep.
Cas looked miserable. “I'll feel uncomfortable not wearing my own clothes.” he confessed, looking at the floor.
Right? If you had asked me before that moment if I was straight, I would've said, hell yes. But now, I'm questioning everything.” Dean said miserably.
Benny said nothing about their conversation. He knew from his own experience that Castiel was probably trying to find the right words in order to tell his story, whatever that was.
“Caring for people is an admirable trait, it's nothing to be ashamed of. As I said, I just wanted my arms free. Now we've established that, you are free to fuss over me as much as you wish. I have no other objections if you wish to indulge in your “instincts”. I rather like being fussed over if I'm being honest as well.” Cas chuckled with a twinkle in his eye.
“I think our best bet for fishing, is real early in the morning.” Dean said, returning to the fire and raking over the coals again. “Probably a good idea to set up the tackle tonight so we can just grab the rods and go after breakfast.” he said, hissing as he pushed the foil wrapped potatoes into the coals he’d raked over.
Traditional genders no longer mattered. What mattered was whether you could breed or not. Secondary genders mattered, whether you were an Alpha or an Omega.
Sam reeled as if he had been slapped. “Given the fucking choice, Dean will always choose to put himself last, Cas. We can't let him! I won't let him!” he hissed angrily, his hair flying wildly around his face as he shook with anger.
“Dean, I-” Cas began to protest.
“Do...it.”
The camp was set up efficiently, the tiny fire was banked low, giving off heat but very little light as the sun began to sink below the horizon. The entire group were gathered, wrapped in blankets and propped against various boulders around the fire-pit in what had been a tiny inlet before the river had been diverted and dried up hundreds of years ago. They listened as Cas told his story, only the occasional sharp intake of breath disturbed the quiet as he described the original mission with his clan brothers, the betrayal, the massacre and then faking his death in order to gather intelligence undetected, to bring down Lucifer's clan, he explained that although he hadn't gone into the compound with the intention of rescuing the Omegas, he had found he was willing to risk discovery in order to save them. His conscience simply wouldn't allow him to leave them. He added that it was unlikely his mission was now compromised, as anyone that had gotten close enough see him was now dead. He felt confident that no-one would know he had even been there. It would probably be reported that the Omegas had escaped on their own.
Benny held his hands up as if to surrender and nodded.
“Cas, I need time. This is new for me, I'm gonna be honest with you about everything, okay? We'll take some time, just you and me. See if we can figure this thing between us out. I've already figured a few things out. Like, I've probably been attracted to you for longer than I thought.” he admitted.
Finally succeeding in throwing Dean off, Sam tackled his brother, knocking them both onto the disgusting carpet, where they wrestled until both were exhausted and coughing.
Benny let out a nervous laugh but sobered quickly as Cas glared at him coldly. “I probably made it sound worse than it is. It's not a bad thing. It's about the war you are gonna be fightin'.” he said nervously.
“You may need glasses if you insist on reading some of these books.” Cas chided mildly. “Also, these chairs are not made for men of your stature, both you and Sam have to hunch over and it puts tension into your neck and shoulders.” he said, glaring at the offending chairs as if he was considering smiting them.
“Hey, this guy is gonna be the judge instead, okay?” Sam yelled, receiving twin answering yells to the affirmative.
“I've got a lot to think about.” he said, chewing his lip.
“While these are cookin', I can try to explain, if you're ready to listen.” he said quietly, he kept his eyes down and shifted uncomfortably.
Sam was thrilled for them, even picking Cas’ pocket to steal the keys to his truck so Cas would have to ride with Dean for the drive back. The fact he was beginning to feel nauseated by them was only a tiny part of it. Sam was just a big old romantic, really.
Jack had already decided to take an extended stay with Jody in order to get away from the tension at home. Dean had screamed and pulled his fist at the kid for no good reason and Cas had intervened, barely restraining himself from putting Dean through a wall judging by the look on his face. Jack had been bundled off the same day and Cas was splitting his time between the bunker and Jody's until things calmed down. Dean had been horrified when the red mist cleared. Cas had forgiven him, but wouldn't relent and let Jack come home just yet.
“I just want to start by saying, I have not lied to any of you. My mission is to destroy Lucifer. My clan is the only one who has the numbers to take him down. What I have not told you, is that my clan is little better than Lucifers. Although they don't raid, my clan trades Omegas. I don't agree with it, my brother Gabriel didn't agree with it. I have been ostracised for my beliefs that matings should only be true. That Omegas are equals, not property. It is why I have not taken a mate. Gabriel left the clan years ago because he couldn't get them to change. I have also decided to leave the clan, but only after Lucifer is destroyed. Above everything, he is a very real threat to every clan within his reach and I need my clan in order to make sure that what happened to you, never happens to anyone else.” Cas refused to look up from staring at the table, no-one else said a word.
“Looks like a Chupacabra. Nothing more dangerous than that, I promise.” she reassured. Dean relaxed again.
“Okay Sam, I want you to drink as much of that water as you can. Sip it, don't gulp it, or it'll come right back up.” he handed the flask to Sam and wrapped the blanket loosely around his shoulders.
Cas looked at Sam who nodded. “We can do that. We don't need to go looking for a fight when the bad guys aren't breaking down the door.” Sam agreed, his voice a little strained with worry for his brother and knowing that he would have to stop hunting for a while too, or Dean would feel obligated to continue.
“Bobby? Bobby, it's Dean. You there man?” the static fizzed for a second before a voice replied
Cas sighed and looked down into Deans face. “Well, of course I mean it. I told you, you're wonderful.” he smiled softly as Dean's face broke into a grin.
“So, you see why my mission is so important. If I have to work with my clan, even though it's repugnant to you, to save anyone from going through what you went through, I'll gladly do it, for the greater good. Lucifer may be my half brother, but I am not like him. Nor have I even met him. Don't forget, he killed my parents too.” he finished quietly, still staring at Dean.
“Good.” Dean said, reaching across to the rail where several t-shirts hung. They were mostly plain, but some had prints or designs. Dean grabbed a couple of each of the plain ones and laid them in Cas' arms.
You. Are. Welcome.
Dean nodded and closed his eyes.
Sam stopped eating for a moment and looked thoughtful. Then he shrugged.
“Okay, but my legs feel like rubber still, so just give me a minute.” Dean agreed, then yelped as Cas picked him up, carrying him to the lake.
“I'm not sick, or dying. Just processing.” Cas said, not sounding very reassuring to Deans ears. “I'll admit, I'm not fine. But I will be. I just need time.” his voice was deeper than ever.
Chapter six! I have a feeling you'll like this one....
With a sigh, Cas continued, “Well I wasn’t supposed to let Metatron out of prison, so when the angels found out. . . They attacked me. As for my healing, I have no idea why it isn’t working. I’ve been. . . sleeping lately, and as you know angels don’t require sleep. I'm guessing since Metatron used some of my grace to close heaven, my powers aren’t restored all the way.” After giving Dean his explanation, Cas looked up at Dean with sorrowful eyes. “I’ so sor-” Cas was cut off by Dean standing up out of his seat. “Damn it Cas,” Dean silently said to himself. Cas was about to say something, when Dean put a hand on his shoulder. “Cas. . . I’m not mad. I just wish you would have come to me sooner with this. Especially since you don’t seem to be at full power still.”
“I called to see how you were doing. Sam and I haven’t heard from you for a couple of weeks.”
Dean has had a rough time trusting Cas ever since he tried playing God, and devoured all the souls in Purgatory. Dean always knew he had his reasons for what he did, but he always believed he could have found a better and less reckless way for a solution. The events that took place that made all the Leviathans walk the Earth again happened a long time ago, but Dean still struggles with the fact that Cas would go behind his back and work with Crowley. To this day, Cas still struggles to make it up to Dean, but that thought will always linger in the back of Dean’s mind. Never to be forgotten.
Castiel was taken back a little at this. He for sure thought that Dean would have been furious for how irresponsible he has been recently. First he betrayed Heaven and worked with Metatron, and second, those same angels he betrayed attacked him.
“Of course Cas. But you know you don’t sound too good, are you sure you don’t want me to come and pick you up?”
“I’m fine Dean. . . just a wound. Nothing I can’t handle.”
“Okay but if anything else happens, you call me.”
“No offence Cas. . . But you sound awful. Are you sure you’re alright?” At this point Castiel was conflicted. Should he really tell Dean how he is? ‘I mean yea Dean will be able to assist me, but he seems to have a full plate at the moment. Maybe I’ll meet up with him in a little bit.’
“you know Dean? Can I stop by the bunker later and tell you in person, instead of telling you over the phone?”
Cas has always been a very loyal man. He’s very loyal to Heaven and his father. He’s always thought that human life has always been very precious, and should be protected at all costs. He’s only been close to a few humans in his time. Dean and Sam Winchester. Despite Dean and Sam being flawed and having a difficult time accepting Castiel in their lives, he has always done his best to be there for them and help them out in dangerous situations they get themselves in. He tries and he tries. Out of the thousand of years of existence, Dean was the very first person he ever said ‘I love you’ to. That phrase still sticks with Dean to this very day.
Dean, being a huge influence towards the people's lives around him. He is a good brother, and especially a fantastic friend. Although Dean can be blunt at times, and quick to judge, he will always stick by his friends side. Even though Dean has lost the majority of the people in his life, he always comes back to something Bobby always reminded him of, “Family don’t end in blood.” To this day Dean still lives by that motto from a man that was more of a father towards him than his actual father.
“Cas that’s no excuse, I would have dropped whatever I was doing to come and get you! You were in no shape to drive. You could have had an accident.” Dean gave Cas a worried look, Castiel returned him one. With his knees starting to give out, Dean picked Cas up bridal style and moved him into his room. “Stay here, I’m going to grab something for your wound.” Without hesitation, Dean quickly moved to the bathroom and grabbed the first aid kit. ‘ What did Cas get himself into?’
“I-I'm sorry for not telling you Dean. . . I didn’t want to seem like a bother.” The blue eyes shifted to look at Dean’s green ones.
“I just feel like it’s time for me to leave you, and Sam. You obviously don’t need me. . . I don’t do much besides mess everything up.”
Finally after a while of silence, Dean decided to break it, “I’m gonna ask you something. . . and I swear if you lie to me, I will kick your ass out of this bunker. Do you understand me?” Dean glared at Cas when he said this. “Yes Dean, I understand.”
“Dean?” He pauses before he continues, making sure he uses the right words so he doesn’t accidentally set Dean off.
“Alright. Goodbye Dean.” Cas hung up his phone, and slipped it into his worn trench coat pocket. Castiel started to feel a slight bit of regret lying to Dean like that. He should have just told Dean he was wounded. . . Wounded to the point that he couldn’t heal it. Cas was still confused why he couldn’t heal a minor wound.‘Maybe I’m just tired,’ he tried to convince himself. Cas gathered all his belongings, and headed out to his car. Sometimes. . . No, all the time Cas wishes he had his ability to fly, even though he believed driving was peaceful and quite relaxing, flying could be really convenient at times. With a long sigh, Cas opened the door to his pile of junk, that was his car, and slowly entered it.
