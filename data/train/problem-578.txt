Sherlock’s deep laugh echoed off the tiled walls, practically filling the entire room. “Consider that payback for these ghastly shorts.”
Perhaps it was the atmosphere, with the single candle on the table, and the dim light fixtures hanging from the ceiling, it was a far more intimate setting than some of the other places they’d gone. The seemingly knowing smiles Angelo was shooting them each time he stopped by to check in weren’t helping matters either. Also not helping was just how good Sherlock looked, a crisp blue shirt that perfectly complemented his eyes, under his ever present fine suit, his artfully tousled black curls that John knew for a fact took ages to get the ‘oh they just happened to fall like this’ look. Sherlock always looked good, but in the aforementioned candle light, he looked… well, he looked even better. He certainly looked better than John by comparison. Even with the bit of product on his hair, his best navy jumper, and the jeans that Harry once joked made her worry would turn Clara, John knew he’d never look close to being on par with Sherlock. Not that he had to look comparable to Sherlock, he didn’t have to look ‘worthy’, it wasn’t a date after all. Not a date, definitely not a date.
“Calm down John, it was just a little something to help you sleep. You were halfway there already, we just gave you the finally kick.” Leah’s tone placating. “And don’t you feel better?”
Sherlock remembered the wedding, and the pain of having to watch John dance with Mary. That night, he thought that it could get no worse, that he couldn’t possibly suffer anything worse; but here he was again, and this time it was worse.  He could see John dancing with some new, faceless woman, smiling, laughing, holding her close. This future Mrs. Watson wouldn’t be a not-so-ex-assassin, only using John as a pawn to settle an old score; she’d be the real thing. She’d be permanent.
“I’m sorry, but because of his state, visitation is restricted to family only at the moment. You’re going to have to wait until Mr. Holmes in a more stable condition before you can see him.” Dr. Cook explained apologetically.
Part of the ceiling had collapsed, and there under a fallen beam was the man in the coat. His dark hair was covered in dirt and ash, and on his face, a mix of soot and blood.
“Sherlock,” John said slowly, as if testing the name, testing how it sounded. “Why do they call you Sherlock?”
“But that protein has a completely different name,” John countered, “so no one should get their functions confused.”
At this, Heather blushed, obviously embarrassed by the past few minutes of conversation. “Yes, of course. Let’s head over to the steps and get started with a set of stair climbs.”
still here because I have twenty minutes left of office hours. You can head over to the Yard and I can meet you there when I’m done if you want.”
Sherlock felt his stomach twist. The way John’s eyes shone, the skin around his eyes crinkling as he grinned; John really was… he was stunning. “You’ll have to tell me what she does this year.” He said, swallowing hard.
“I don’t know about settling, but something tells me the frequency of the late night pacing is going to take a dramatic decline for the next few months.” John mused, glancing over his shoulder at the man himself who was obviously trying to make it look like he was tuning them out, but the small smile on his face gave away the truth.
“It’s very clear that you two get along.” Mrs. Hudson smiled. “But that’s not what I meant. I meant that Sherlock’s always been alone, and he’ll deny it until his last breath, but he’s always been so lonely. He retreats into that mad brain of his like a protective cocoon, and having you here, having a… friend here, I think it will keep him from getting lost. I don’t want you to feel like I’m putting too much responsibility on your shoulders,” she added hastily, “but I can already tell that you’re good for him.”
As Sherlock ate, John filled him in on everything he had missed from the hospital until he recently woke up. His deductions were correct; he had two cracked ribs, in addition to the extensive bruising, sprained wrist, and swollen knee and ankle. He had also apparently gifted the A&E doctor with a rather unfortunate nickname that John found rather amusing – though he tried to deny it. There was more John wasn’t saying, that much was obvious, but Sherlock wasn’t going to let it bother him, he’d figure it out in due time. At the moment, Sherlock was just going to enjoy sitting with John, listening to him talk.
“Nah, I’m really not. I’m just a stand in.” Molly smirked. “And I honestly can’t wait until my services are not longer needed, and I can go back to being your in at Bart’s and occasional study buddy” she added with a tired laugh.
“Good. Now fuck me!” Sherlock commands. In one swift motion, Sherlock removes John’s shirt and pushes him towards the bedroom.
“It wasn’t nearly as charming as you’re probably picturing.” Sherlock mumbled, his face feeling suddenly hot. What was wrong with him? “Except for the few times I convinced my mum or dad to call in with an ‘anonymous tip’, nobody listened to me.” He sighed. The Yard really did waste an unbelievable amount of time by ignoring him, he was – nearly – always right. “It wasn’t until about two and a half years ago that I met DC Lestrade when I was hanging around a crime scene, a carjacking. Apparently I looked suspicious, so he questioned me a little.”
With tea in hand – reheated and transferred from ceramic mugs to paper cups – and heading for the door, Sherlock slipped one hand into his jacket to run his finger along the small velvet box he had been carrying around in a hidden pocket for the past week.
“And John, the man I’m meeting, he’s my partner full stop. Personally, professionally, all of it.” Sherlock knew he sounded ridiculous, bragging about having a boyfriend like he was a teenager, but Christ did it feel good. It felt good to finally show Theo that he wasn’t a freak, that he may be slightly different than most, but it didn’t matter, he wasn’t broken, he could still find someone who –
Receiving amorous looks was not a new concept for Sherlock, but there was something different about this man. Usually when someone at a club looked at him with interest – and this man was clearly interested – they almost always tried to approach him, but this man didn’t. He seemed content to just stand by himself, and take in the scene, take in Sherlock, but not engage. He was interested, but wasn’t making a move, why?
“Fantastic.” John should be more bothered by Sherlock recounting his career ending injury, but he couldn’t help it, it was simply fantastic.
“Again, not true.” Sherlock protested. “I spoke to Mike’s girlfriend at length. And I promised that Alec guy I would pass on his regards and phone number to Molly. You can account for him being trustworthy, correct?”
“You are?” John asked, he sounded nervous, he sounded unsure. How could he be unsure? How could he not know how much Sherlock wanted him, how much he…
“But we only have to look at a thirteen hour time frame, probably less. I just need to look for anyone who lingered behind the kiosk. I can find him… find them”
Sherlock moaned and grasped desperately at John, mind unable to form proper words, something quite rare in and of itself. Grinning, John climbed on top of him, his knees on either side of Sherlock’s hips, his hands caging Sherlock’s head. Holding himself up, and away from Sherlock, John dipped his head down to capture him in a hard kiss, forcing Sherlock’s mouth open and diving in all teeth and tongue.
They laid there for a while, kissing slowly, John buried deep, Sherlock running his hands along John’s back, growing used to the fullness – the amazing, heart stopping fullness.
“Yes, yes. I should probably let Richard know how everything went anyway. Silly man’s probably going spare not knowing, and he’ll insist on knowing every little detail.” She chuckled and shook her head. “Holmes men!”
“Why is it that I don’t find that very hard to believe, that with you, London is a battlefield?” John smirked. Not immediately opposed to the idea, excellent.
“The invitation grants you a guest, so you should have one.” It hurt to even say the words, but who was he to deny John something – someone – he wanted? “This doesn’t seem like the type of event you’d wish to attend alone. It’s fine. It’s perfectly fine.”
Sherlock was still, he wasn’t responding. What the hell had he been thinking, jumping Sherlock like that? But just as John was about to pull away, about to think of some excuse, any excuse, it was like Sherlock read his mind, his fear – which John wasn’t entirely sure he couldn’t do – and suddenly John felt Sherlock’s familiar arms wrap around his waist, and Sherlock’s familiar hands splayed against his back. Sherlock was pulling him in closer, tilting his head, parting his lips, and kissing him back. Dear Jesus, Sherlock was kissing him back and it was like every first kiss, every goodbye kiss and kiss hello, every reunion kiss, every good morning and goodnight kiss, all wrapped into one, but better. It was like no kiss he’d ever experienced, and he never wanted to kiss any other living soul ever again, because how could it ever compare to kissing Sherlock Holmes? John felt Sherlock melt into the kiss, and John allowed himself to melt too, their lips meeting over and over again. No, no kiss could ever compare to kissing Sherlock Holmes.
“No, it’s just… extensive.” Everything all laid out was quite something to take in, and when he thought about it, Sherlock didn’t think Molly had never actually seen him in full case mode.
When John wakes the next morning, he is alone. Cleaning up the only evidence he had company last night in the bathroom, John looks in the mirror to see if he looks different, he certainly feels different. Truth be told, John had never actually had sex with a man before. He always knew that he’s attracted to men as well as women, he just hadn’t really met a man that really sparked that kind of need in him, so he just stuck with women. That is, until last night, and as a result, he had the best sex of his life.
“But he brings you in on cases?” This was amazing, Sherlock was… he solved crimes, solved mysteries, as a hobby. “Amazing!”
“I have a hard-enough time saying no to you over normal mundane things, after everything you just said, do you honestly think I’m even capable of saying no.” John sighed, then forced himself to look serious. “Although, there is one thing I need to know before agreeing to anything.”
“Just a little bit,” John smirked, “But only because I knew you’d lose track of time, and I didn’t want you feeling bad that you missed your own party.”
Shit! The pilfering waiter had joined the ‘discussion’ at the bar, and it didn’t look like he was taking too kindly to Sherlock’s accusations. John sighed as he hurried over to prevent Sherlock from being murdered yet again; honestly, he couldn’t leave the brilliant idiot alone for one second. It should probably bother John that that fact only made him start falling deeper.
Sherlock mumbled his thanks when John handed him a plate and they settled into their meal in companionable silence. Whatever it was John made – some sort of creamy thing with chicken, rice, and peas – it was delicious.  John shrugged off the compliment, saying it was his Nan’s recipe of throwing what you had into a casserole dish and baking for an hour. With a shared smile and small chuckle, the quiet resumed, and they tucked back into their food. Or at least John started eating again, Sherlock found himself watching John, thinking how best to say what he wanted to say next.
Now it was Sherlock’s turn to stare. Only his mummy and daddy ever called him amazing, or said what he did was amazing. No one… no one ever thought he was amazing.
Lestrade finally came through for him the following afternoon; a private nurse discovered her elderly patient dead, and quite a few of his valuables missing from the house. According to Lestrade, there were no signs of a break in, other than the missing stuff. And because of the weather, the nurse couldn’t visit in person over the weekend, but called to check in on her patient several times a day, and didn’t understand how anyone could have managed break in, let alone do it in such bad conditions.
As if reading John’s mind – John still wasn’t convinced he couldn’t – Sherlock’s eyes snapped open, locking onto John’s. Then, without warning, John found himself being grabbed by the waist, and pulled almost flush against Sherlock.
“Tomorrow morning? I see no problem with tomorrow morning.” So he was only looking for a distraction for the night, excellent. “The name’s Jack, by the way.”
“Oh, right… Do you have a boyfriend then? Which is… which is fine, by the way.” God, could he sound any more like the ‘
“Pretty weak, but he seemed to recall everything that happened to him, knew who you were, so that’s very good. He was in some pain, so I turned up his morphine. He was probably only wake for five minutes total.”
“So, what do you think?” He asked, arms out stretched, turning to give Sherlock a three hundred and sixty degree view.
As if in slow motion, John watched as the nurse pulled the breathing tube from Sherlock’s throat, and with one final buck, Sherlock collapse back onto his bed, back into unconsciousness.
“We have no real reason to be concerned,” Dr. Cook said, trying to sound reassuring, “and we don’t believe his brain function has been compromised, but I just want the scans to be sure.”
"Terrible, unthinkable,” Sherlock finished for him, taking John’s face in his hands to claim his mouth for a proper kiss.
Wandering around his flat, John is surprised by how much he had become accustomed to Sherlock’s things. Gone are the random ‘barrowed’ police files, Sherlock’s textbooks, the assorted clothes, and his ridiculously expensive soaps. John’s flat feels empty now; without Sherlock, John feels empty. Walking into his bedroom, that’s John spots it sticking out from behind his bed. One of Sherlock’s scarves must have been overlooked. Blue cashmere with a slight checked pattern, it’s one of John’s favorite, one of Sherlock’s too. John should probably return it to him, but he can’t bring himself to part with it. Holding it up to his nose, John can still detect Sherlock’s smell, and everything he’s feeling crashes over him again. Clutching to the scarf like a lifeline, John gives in to his sorrow, and lets himself cry.
No, no, no, John couldn’t have that. They were making progress, Sherlock couldn’t shy away now. “Right,” John smirked, taking a step, closing the distance between him and Sherlock, “well I think you need to work on your routine.”
“No tea; the only thing you ‘just need’ is some sleep in an actual bed. It’s nearly half eleven anyway.”
Sherlock just nodded. Strictly speaking, it may not have been John’s escape maneuver alone that him off balance.
“Well, in terms of frequency, married sex far outstrips both dating sex and engaged sex. At the rate we’re going, I think they’re going to need to rename this place ‘The Holmes-Watson Honeymoon Suit.’” Sherlock grinned.
After twenty-six minutes of pure agony – during which John could think of nothing but Sherlock alone, bleeding out, and him not being there when Sherlock needing him – the cab finally pulled up to the A&E. John threw the driver some cash, not even bothering to check to see if it was the correct amount, and ran straight into the hospital.
Sherlock’s head popped out of changing cubicle, the curtain held tightly shut blow his neck. “It was a stupid idea, I shouldn’t have agreed in the first place. I’m not doing it.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, but swallowed the pills with a swig of water all the same. John really could be ridiculously stubborn at times. But it wouldn’t hurt to humor him, and Sherlock found the pain far more uncomfortable than what he was used to.
“I’m not exactly sure I understand why they’d think that,” John said eventually, “but I guess you know him better than I do.”
They sat still for a few moments, accommodating to each other, when Sherlock began to move. It was slow at first, a gentle rolling of his hips, as if he were searching for the correct angle, the right position, searching for…
“Theo, Theo Fuller.” Theo said, still smiling, and extended his hand towards John. He let it drop when John made no move to reciprocate. “Listen, I meant no offense.”
It was during Sherlock’s second full day in hospital that Dr. Cook ordered he be taken for a PET and CT scan.
At this, the man chuckled, but there wasn’t an ounce of humor in it. “Ah, yes. The bravery of the soldier. Bravery is by far the kindest word for stupidity, don’t’ you think?”
Sherlock felt John’s hand on his chin lifting his head to look up. John was… John was smiling. It wasn’t his amused smile, or his placating smile, or his accommodating, humoring smile. John was smiling his soft, overjoyed, loving, ‘for Sherlock only’ smile.
“No,” Sherlock chuckled, “I always knew they weren’t real and so I’d just let myself enjoy them while I could.”
Sherlock didn’t respond, but he did narrow his eyes, so John continued, “It’s alright to take things easy for a little while. You did kind of have an entire house fall on top of you only a month ago, a burning one no less.”
Neither John, nor Sherlock made any comment when they woke the next morning, John just got ready for the day, and Sherlock went out to the living room and his cold case files. It was as if nothing had happened, nothing had changed. But something had changed. After that first night, Sherlock started coming to John’s bed more and more often. The first few times after that first night, Sherlock would come in under the pretext of needing to say something or to ask John a question, but eventually the need for pretext fell away.  It wasn’t every night, and it was never for anything more than sleep – they resolutely avoided the topic of what had happened between them that night in Carrows – but every few nights John would wake to find Sherlock lying next to him, often times holding onto a small bit of John’s t-shirt. John didn’t mind, if that’s what Sherlock needed to feel safe, John – and his t-shirt – would be there for him as long as they were needed. If it just so happened that the first thing John saw in the mornings was Sherlock next to him, well that was just an added bonus.
Nurse Leah said something else as she exited the room, but John had already stopped paying attention at that point. He couldn’t take his eyes off Sherlock’s face. He looked so peaceful, and though he was right there, he looked so far away.
“Just because you two started out like… that,” Mrs. Hudson said, breathing hard through her nose, “doesn’t mean it can’t become something more. And you clearly do want something more with John.”
“It is amazing, isn’t it?” John chuckled softly. “But spending time with others is good too, if only to remind us how great you and me time really is.”
Sherlock continued to lick and suck at him until John started to soften and slip from those now red, swollen lips, those perfect lips.
confused frown, back on his face. “Told me, I mean. You said you’ve wanted to kiss me every time you’ve seen me. Why
“You’re welcome.” John smiled, he really did have a lovely smile. “Now get some sleep. I’ll see you in the morning.”
“Fine,” he huffed, he couldn’t let her know he didn’t mind helping her out. “Just hold on a moment, there’s something I need to do.”
“There’s absolutely nothing to worry about. The antibiotics should take care of any possible infections, and his pain meds will help him sleep. He should probably be out for another few hours.” She said reassuringly. “Now I’d suggest you get back in your bed and get some rest, you have a bit of healing to do yourself. How is your pain, do we need to adjust your medication?”
“Yes John, I know. I’m not going to actually strangle you.” Sherlock rolled his eyes. Honesty baffled him sometimes, a lot of the time.
As the weeks wore on after that Sunday in the library, Sherlock noticed that things between him and John seemed to shift. John would invite him to go to the café with him after class on Tuesdays, when they both had a couple hours free, and Sherlock found himself accepting. They talked for longer and longer after – and sometimes during – their Thursday night lessons. And if they happened to spot each other on campus, they would smile and give a little wave. Sherlock would actually smile and wave at another human being, willingly.
For the first time in ages, Sherlock’s mind failed him. He wracked his brain, but couldn’t think of one reasonable, guaranteed way to get John to see him. He couldn’t very well show up at John’s flat or at his clinic, smile, shrug, and say
Sherlock’s lips were… it was like before, but… better. It was so much better. Before, when Sherlock had kissed him, it had happened so fast that John didn’t really get the chance to process it, to concentrate and really comprehend what was happening before it was over. He’d thought about it afterwards, he’d thought about it a lot, trying to remember and recreate every feeling. But now… Sherlock’s lips, from which passed some of the quickest and sharpest words John had ever heard, were so unbelievably soft, no hint of dryness or any chapping. Sherlock’s lips were warm. For a man who looked like he was carved from marble, Sherlock was always warm, so alive, so human. Sherlock’s lips were plush. Sherlock’s lips were perfect, as if created to be kissed. Sherlock’s lips were… Sherlock’s lips were… were… still.
Thanks again for taking the time to read. And a very special thank you to everyone who took time to comment and kudos, you make writing worth it!!
“Huh.” Sherlock thought for a moment. “It’s just that I’ve never made a friend so quickly before. Good.” He added with smile.
Shit, shit, shit! He’d done it, he’d really done it this time. He did the one thing he was fighting so hard not to do, he’d driven John away.
John looked genuinely surprised by this, surprised that other people were put off by Sherlock’s… well, Sherlock-ness.
Sherlock stiffened as John felt himself graze the small bundle of nerves buried deep within Sherlock. “
The walk to Molly’s uncle’s office took an eternity. Had the hallway always been so long? And it was so deserted. All the times he’d been there before, he’d pass at least a couple people, but at the moment, there was no one. The only sound was the click, click, click of his and Molly’s footsteps echoing off the walls.
Sherlock was just about to craft a strongly worded ‘fuck off’ text, when he felt a familiar pair of strong arms wrap around his waist.
Then there was the nagging worry that John knew, that he had somehow deduced what was going on in Sherlock’s head and… other areas. Ever since that night and their conversation the next morning where they decided to forget anything ever happened, Sherlock had caught John looking at him every so often, only to look away as soon as Sherlock noticed and looked back. He was probably afraid Sherlock was going to jump him or something equally as base. But John had absolutely nothing to fear; as tenuous as it was, Sherlock still had some level of control over himself. He did have access to showers and the locked privacy of his own bedroom, after all.
“Fine.” John said with a resigned sigh. Bill was a stubborn son of a bitch, it was better to just go along with him.
“I’m here, I’m right here.” Sherlock chocked, clutching John’s hand in his. “John, look at me! Keep your eyes fixed on me, I’m right here!”
It wasn’t long before the kisses turned urgent, and the sounds of moans and panting filled the small room. Sherlock’s hands were fisted in the cotton of John’s t-shirt, and John’s were tangled in Sherlock’s curls. Every movement, every gentle tug to his follicles was like a shot of electricity through Sherlock’s body, he was on fire, every nerve was firing at once, screaming out for John.
His senses had only just begun to return, when John felt Sherlock’s hand on the back of his neck, and he was being pulled down into a hard, uncoordinated kiss. Mouth thoroughly claimed, John rode out the rest of his orgasm with Sherlock, his thrusts slow and careful, so as to not aggravate their already oversensitive bodies.
“I really don’t. I think I need you to explain.” Sherlock smirked, suddenly feeling puckish. Oh dear lord, he was feeling puckish; what the hell had John done to him?
Christmas break is next, so the next chapter is going to be a little different, but I hope it works.
“So how are we channeling this new-found freedom? Have you given any thought to other types of relationships, maybe thought about dating?”
“Well, I was way up here, and you looked like you were having a good enough time by yourself, way down there on the dance floor.”
“Please, like you don’t know what you’re doing,” John smirked, stepping just a bit closer, “showing off that long neck of yours, showing just a hint of collarbone. Maddening,” he hummed.
“You’re kind of strange, you know that, right?” John chuckled, but there was no malice behind it. He was teasing him, like friends do to each other.
“You – uh,” John said, clearing his throat and breaking the strained, uncomfortable, hateful silence, “you said something about figuring out who is sending those threats to Mr. Mccullough?” Sherlock could have kissed him. He wanted to kiss him.
“I’m inclined.” John chuckled and pulled a chair up next to Sherlock’s bed. “And you chase people into abandon buildings that blow up, so you might be interesting too.”
“And that constitutes a romantic relationship?” Sherlock said flatly. “And here I was thinking I’d just made a friend. I can have friends you know.”
“He’s probably just gone for a coffee. We can just wait here, I’m sure he won’t mind.” Molly said, taking a seat on one of the threadbare chairs. Sherlock didn’t have time to wait, and instead left the office, and walked across the hall to the mortuary.
“Then it’s a date.” John beamed. “Now don’t keep those mold cultures waiting! I’ll see you tomorrow.”
“Seriously, John, I can’t tell you how happy I am that you’re moving in. Sherlock really needs this.”
“Yeah, well it would have taken the top spot,” John scooted forward with a sigh, and curled his hands around Sherlock’s hips, “but then earlier today, I asked the most brilliant, most handsome, most wonderful man in the world to be my husband. Then, by some miracle, he said yes. I just can’t think of anything that could top getting to spend the rest of my life with him.”
“Anniversary? It’s not our anniversary, our anniversary is in May. I know it is, I made a point of making a note in my calendar. And I know I put down the right date because we went out to dinner, and afterwards I remember thinking that I really really liked all the anniversary sex we had.”
“You had the words ‘Skype with Mum and Harry’ written on your hand the day you tried talking to me again. Plus there were a few brochures for various sobriety programs sticking out of your bag, along with an envelope addressed to a Harry Watson.” Please don’t let this be the thing to drive John away. But he wanted to know, John asked to be told. “I was just assuming you don’t refer to your father by his first name, so Harry must be a brother. Older, because well, his drinking is serious enough that you’ve looked into programs, and you’re only twenty years old.”
“Ok, the two of us against all of Scotland Yard. You thrive on this stuff, John Watson. Don’t try to deny it.”
“Ok, now I know no one would ever say that about Sherlock voluntarily.” Theo’s condescending snicker ripping its way through. “Come on, how much is he paying you to be his ‘boyfriend’ and sing his praises?”
John furrowed his brow, eyeing Sherlock suspiciously. “Am I attracted to both women and men? Yes,” he said slowly.
Sherlock smiled, and took John’s hand to slide his ring back in place. “You do have a point, I guess,” he laughed. “Alright. I, Sherlock, take you, John, to be my lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold, and to give myself completely to you, now and forever, because not even death will part me from you.”
“I still don’t understand what we’re still doing here.” Sherlock whined, throwing back his head. While being with John was better than being alone by a mile, better than anything, that didn’t mean he didn’t still get bored. “Lestrade has some cold cases for us, but he’s refusing to deliver them. Let’s go pick them up.”
“Then fine, we’ll wait to get a bigger flat.” Sherlock sighed, and draped his arms around John’s shoulders, pulling him into a deeper kiss. Yep, the brilliant git was utterly powerless.
It was the same thing almost every day. Twice a day a meal would slide in through the door, and twice a day he’d be escorted to the bathroom. Occasionally John would find a dull razor, and would be allowed a wash, but it was cursory at best. He never got truly clean, his face remained covered in uneven stubble, his hair got tangled. The lighting was one thing that did change. Sometimes the single bulb burned around the clock, and at other times, John would be plunged into darkness for hours on end. There was no pattern, no way to predict when it would happen. It was all part of the plan to disorient and confuse him, John figured.
“I’m in no hurry. I’ll stick with the bus, thanks.” There was no way he could take the driver – bodyguard, hit man, hired muscle – one on one, but perhaps he could outrun him.
“Oh wait, but we don’t need it for that.” He quickly added when he finally caught Mike’s meaning. “I told you before, Sherlock and I, we’re not like that. Really.” God, if only they were like that. What he wouldn’t give for them to be like that. “We’re just friends.”
“Ok everyone, I want you all to give a warm welcome to a new student to your grade, William Holmes.”
“Because,” Sherlock smirked, dropping his voice a register, knowing exactly what it did to John, “I’ve made love to my best friend, and I’ve made love to my boyfriend, but I have yet to experience what it’s like to make love to my fiancé.”
moments. Plenty of people he knew or had known, popped into his head during those moments. It didn’t mean anything. And the fact that Sherlock may or may not have popped in more and more often as of late, well, that was just because he spent so much time with Sherlock. It wasn’t like he… he couldn’t… he….
John had never been this uncomfortable in his life, and that included the time in secondary school when he walked in on the rugby coach getting
fuck you.” He growled. “No, I’m going to take you apart bit by bit, leave my mark on every last piece of you. And then, and only then, will I put you back together, with me completely ingrained within in you.”
John had never seen Sherlock act so reserved – almost shy – around other people. It was obvious he was nervous about being there, maybe it wasn’t such a good idea to make him come out. But John wanted Sherlock in all aspects of his life, he didn’t want him thinking he was ashamed of their friendship, that he viewed Sherlock as somehow separate, a secret.
Respecting other people’s privacy? Keeping mum and not exposing deeply personal matters? That was not the Sherlock Holmes he had come to know. John would have laughed, but that would have only cased Ella to ask more questions, questions he didn’t care to answer.
John returned a few minutes later with the heated wrap, which smelled strongly of oatmeal, and it felt… amazing. Perhaps it was the combination of the pain meds kicking in and the heat, but Sherlock’s muscles immediately felt more relaxed, and the soreness started to ebb away. Sherlock may have even let out a long sigh that to some sounded more like a moan. At that moment, Sherlock didn’t really care, he just let the heat sink in, and the relaxation spread throughout his body.
“God yeah. Let’s get out of here.” John said, looking at his watch. “I know it’s a bit early, but I haven’t had anything since breakfast, and I’m absolutely starving. I say we go out to dinner, celebrate this thing finally being over.”
And coincidences seem to abound, because two months later, Sherlock takes a case investigating an assistant manager for West Ham United. So what if John has supported West Ham his entire life? And so what if the case requires them to attend a game that happens to fall on John’s 22nd birthday? A case is case, no matter how fortuitous the timing.
God he loved it here, losing himself in the beat, the music loud enough to drown out his thoughts, the constant ebb and flow of people around him, none of them really caring who or what he was. Nobody needed answers; nobody was depending on him to be right, to be fast, he could just be. And after the last few days, the demands, the nonstop running around, Sherlock need to just be, he needed the sound, the movement, the distraction.
“Absolutely,” John grinned. “Visiting your parents, seeing where you grew up, your childhood bedroom, that sounds fantastic.” And then John was kissing him again.
Breathing heavily, Sherlock slips off John and rolls to lie next to him. Tying off the condom, and throwing it in the bin next to his bed, John grabs his discarded pants and starts to wipe up Sherlock and himself.
“Oh yes, absolutely.” John grinned. “But I do have one condition.” He said leaning back – though not entirely out of Sherlock’s arms – so that he could look Sherlock in eyes.
“Yes there is.” John said, pulling Sherlock’s hands away from his face and bringing them to his lips, gently kissing his knuckles before guiding the still shivering detective over to the couch. “Talk to me. I promise, you can tell me anything. Is this too much? Are we moving too fast?”
Well ok then, it looked like John and Sherlock becoming an item was going to be beneficial to him after all. Love sure was grand.
“Once your doctors give you the all clear, then you’ll move to stage two, which is a more intensive twice daily therapy schedule.”
I just want to thank everyone who has read, kudo'd, and commented on this story. It's the longest thing I've ever written (I added about 5000 more words as I was editing!) and I really enjoyed writing it, so I really hope you enjoyed reading it.
“I’m sorry, but there can only be one visitor in the recovery room at a time, immediate family only. You’ll have to wait.”
The rest of the evening passed easily enough. The prospect of two boxfuls of cases seemed to be enough to distract Sherlock from his convalescence, and John was just happy to eat leftovers and study for his orthopedics mid-term in the relative calm. The calm, however, was not to last very long because there was one more subject to be broached, and John was not looking forward to it.
It was the early morning hours of Sunday – several hours earlier, John had sent Harry a text letting her know he’d be staying at the hospital indefinitely – when Dr. Cook stopped in again to inform John that a more private room had been arranged for Sherlock
John watches as Sherlock sweeps around the office, examining the victims desk. His movements far too graceful, reminding John of the other ways in which Sherlock’s body can move. Lost in his thoughts, John doesn't realize Lestrade has joined them, or that Sherlock has started talking again. Quickly clearing his mind, John focuses on Sherlock’s words.
Because of the way the bullet entered his shoulder, in conjunction with the infection, John’s dominant hand is rendered completely useless for trauma and battlefield surgery. So, just over nine and half years after hugging his mother and sister goodbye, John returns to England with a shaking left hand, a limp, and a complete lack of direction.
“I see, and that is all?” He asks, receiving only a quick nod from John. “And do you plan on continuing your association with my brother?”
“Are we together? If you mean are we frequently within proximity of each other, then yes. If you are inquiring into whether there is some sort of romantic or sexual entanglement between us, then the answer is no, we are not
John stood in the doorway, watching as their handful of guests milled around the Holmes’ backyard. He and Sherlock had decided to keep it small, just close friends and family, and since neither of them were church and reception hall kind of people, they gladly accepted when Sherlock’s parents offered to host. Well, it was more they didn’t argue when Mrs. Holmes insisted on ‘throwing her baby boy the wedding he and his John deserve.’  Mrs. Hudson and Mrs. Holmes were already in their seats with handkerchiefs at the ready.
“And yet you’ve been to visit him every day since he’s been in hospital, and I believe you have plans to return tomorrow. Tell me, might we expect a happy announcement by the end of the week?”
“Oh excellent.” Mr. Holmes grinned. “Thank you so much, Constable Butler. We all very much appreciate it.  Now I think it’s about time we get out of your hair. Come along, Sherlock, your mother is worried sick about you.”
“About fucking time we met Mr. Thursday Night!” Jason Zardari – captain and attacking midfielder – could be heard yelling over the sudden explosion of whoops and hollers from the table.
“Any fun you may have thought I experienced during our acquaintance, was simply a result of me being under the influence. With the amount of illicit substances with which you plied me, I would have found a nail being driven through my foot, fun.” Sherlock snapped. Oh, it felt so good to get everything off his chest. For years, Theo’s final words to him followed him around, made him question himself and doubt himself. It took three stints in rehab, two relapses, and an overdose, to finally get clean. And it took one utterly
Anyone else, and Sherlock would have probably refused point blank, but Molly wasn’t nearly as thick-headed as the rest their peers, and well, her uncle did work in a morgue and Sherlock would have to be a fool to jeopardize that kind of connection.
Well, have a good weekend and I'll see you again on Sunday. Oh, and if you're trying to think of something to do to pass the time, you could, I don't know, maybe leave me some of those lovely comments and/or corrections. Totally your call, I don't care, whatever *cool guy finger guns*
"Not really no.” John admitted, and feeling a bit uncomfortable, focused on the waterfall in the corner of the room, instead of on Ella.
Not only had the man seen him, but now he had stopped dancing and was making his way towards the bar, towards John.
“You saw?” The man stepped further into the room, though not up close to Sherlock’s bed. But still, he hadn’t run out the door, so that was a good sign.
Sherlock’s eyes remained closed when they reluctantly parted some time later – though boring, breathing eventually become absolutely necessary – and those perfect lips were gorgeously kiss swollen. John couldn’t help himself and let out a breath of laughter as he rested his forehead against Sherlock’s.
John was still smiling, he wasn’t annoyed. He was laughing even, teasing but in a nice way. Why wasn’t he fed up by now? Last year it only took the other kids ten minutes to make Sherlock an outsider.
“You really don’t.” Sherlock took a few deep breaths, attempting to regain some semblance of control. There was no way around it, he had to come clean.  In for a penny… “I’m going to be very clear; I am not, nor was I ever, in a relationship with John Watson. He is not my boyfriend, he was never my boyfriend. I had only met him the night before, he was just a…” God he didn’t want to finish that sentence.
Well, he had almost nothing, there was one option. It was completely absurd, so feeble and laughably transparent a child could see through it. But if John didn’t quite hate him entirely, he may just appreciate the absurdity of it, appreciate Sherlock’s efforts. It was stupid, it was a risk, and it could be over in seconds, but it was worth it, John was worth it. Sherlock had to at least try.
"Good.” John said. “Really good.” It was true, he honestly couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt this good; before Afghanistan, that was for sure. And it wasn’t just a passing good, he wasn’t just having a good few days. It wasn’t a bright spot in a sea of grey. No, he was feeling consistently good. He wasn’t seeing the world through rose colored glasses or anything, there was still the grey, but it was as if the grey didn’t really matter all that much, because the good was just so… good.
Sherlock lifted a hand, stopping a passing cab instantly; not an easy feat since he did it while balancing on crutches. “Chinese works. I think I know just the place.”
I probably should have said this earlier, but if you guys have ANY questions at all about what's going on in the story, please feel free to ask. Yes the story is written, but I'm editing and changing things as I post, so it'd be great to know if I've dropped something or made something unclear. I'm always looking for ways of improving and making sure this is the best final product it can be!
“A double hotel room. You weren’t listening, were you?” John sighed. “Michelle and Andrew’s party is in the evening and Sherborne is over two hours away; it’s just easier to stay the night and return home in the morning, or… or afternoon.”
Once he finished dressing, John left the bedroom to find his discarded coat and gloves, and caught sight of the rest of the flat. Sherlock’s warning was clearly warranted. The kitchen – off of which the bedroom was – looked more appropriate for cooking meth than cooking food. The table was covered end to end with lab equipment, and stacks of petri dishes growing all manner of things, John didn’t want to look too closely. The sitting room wasn’t much better, though stacks of papers and books, instead of organic matter, covered a desk, one of two arm chairs, the floor around a couch, and a coffee table. The décor was… interesting, a touch macabre, with  a cow skull wearing earphones hung on one wall, a framed picture of a skull hung on another, while a human skull sat on the mantel next to a daggers stabbing several letters. The man did like his skulls.
“A shot?” Sherlock said incredulously. Had they been transported back to secondary school? It was as if Lestrade was trying to set shy, awkward Sherlock up with the cute new boy in class. Ridiculous.
He had just turned the corner onto his street when he stopped dead in his tracks, because there sitting on the steps directly in front of his building was Sherlock. It couldn’t be him, there was no way that Sherlock Holmes was sitting and waiting in front of John’s building. John’s misery had finally gotten the better of him, and his mind and eyes were in cahoots and decided to play cruel trick. But just then, Sherlock turned and there was no mistaking those dark curls, or those focused blue-green eyes that seem to hold John and not let go. Not a hallucination then.
I wonder what both Mrs. H and Lestrade see between John and Sherlock, that John's missing. Your guess is as good as mine. But it's a bit weird, don't you think?
It was probably for the best that Lestrade cut him off, Sherlock didn’t want John’s first crime scene marred by petty – on Sally’s part, not his – insults and bickering. John was bound to learn how the Yard, save for Lestrade, viewed him sooner or later, and Sherlock preferred to put it off for as long as possible.
Once the food is finished, and their battle ends in a stalemate, they leave the restaurant. Neither wanting to leave each other just yet, they start aimlessly walking.
“I usually am.” Hummed Sherlock, still coming down from their most recent round of frankly mind-blowing, mind altering, love making. “What was I right about this time?”
“Yes,” Sherlock nodded, “we need to go home. I suddenly find I am feeling very amorous, and very much need to get my fantastic boyfriend divested of his clothes, and in a horizontal position.”
“Just take a seat. I’ve already let Mr. Holmes know you’re here, and he’ll be out of his meeting in about five minutes.” Mr. Holmes’ personal assistant led Sherlock and his mother through the back corridors of a nondescript building, on a nondescript street, to his father’s office.
was; but another part couldn’t get enough of seeing how Sherlock’s mind worked. “Go on.” John said quietly, he had to know.
“Don’t worry about that, I don’t need them back right away. Actually, you can give them back next time, preferably after you’ve giving them a wash.” Teaching Sherlock self-defense was one thing, he wasn’t about to start doing his laundry – even if they were technically still John’s clothes.
It was all rather domestic. Waking up with another person, bantering in bed, making plans for breakfast.  Strangely, Sherlock found he didn’t seem to mind.
Jack moaned around Sherlock’s cock, his tongue swirling from root to tip. Jack was toying with him, letting his teeth graze along Sherlock’s shaft before suddenly swallowing him down completely, all the while never breaking eye contact. It was all Sherlock could do to not buck, to not thrust, to not force himself as far down Jack’s throat as possible. Jack’s hand traveled slowly up Sherlock’s bare chest, his fingers burning trails of pure ecstasy as they went, and Sherlock was on fire. He hadn’t felt anything quite so good since… not since… Every muscle tensing, Sherlock felt as if every single cell in his body was screaming.
“Hmmmm, no. Pining’s bad, Pining’s very, very bad. No pining,” mumbled Sherlock as he stalked across the room to loom over John. “I say we put all thoughts of horrible, horrible pining out of our heads, and we test out this bed, see if it’s up to our standards?”
“Sherlock.” John said quietly, looking up at him as he entered to room. John was sat on his bed in a pair of boxers and a t-shirt, his back against the headboard, a book resting against his bent knees. Sherlock had never seen anything more beautiful in his life.
“Come on Sherlock” John said, stopping Sherlock before they could exit the main door and step out into the cold January air. “I don’t have a game tomorrow, and this will be the last free Friday until the Championships at the end of the month.”
“Sherlock! Oh god, Sherlock I don’t know if I have any condoms!” John groans when he’s finally free of his pants.
“I can do that, it’s fine. You go sit down, and then I’ll check your leg. Forgive me if I don’t trust your ‘I’m fine’ assessment.” John didn’t sound annoyed anymore. If anything, he sounded amused. Maybe Sherlock humiliating himself was enough to get him to stay.
John shook his head. “You’re not doing anything wrong, not from where I’m standing.” And then there was no more distance, no more separation. John’s hands were gripping the lapels of his jacket, and John’s lips were on his.
. But that was only John’s wishful thinking. “When do you think you’ll be ready to go again?” He asked, those intoxicating eyes staring deep into John’s.
“God forbid I put on clothes.” John giggled, pulling Sherlock back down onto the bed. “No, I was thinking more along the lines of us getting room service. I’d only need to put on a dressing gown to open the door, then it’d be back to au naturel.”
“Of course if you leave now,” Molly pipes up, an exhausted edge to her normally sweet voice “I might not be able to sneak samples to you after Dr. Pieterson kicks you out of the morgue. And who knows if Greg will be willing to let someone in on his future police work, who so callously abandon his party.”
“Oh and Sherlock, don’t think I didn’t hear you two last night. There better not be any new scratches on my floors, or new dents in my walls.”
“John, please,” Sherlock scoffed, “if they need me on a case, which they always do, they’ll hardly turn you away. You’d be my medical consultant. Two consultants for the price of one, they’d be idiots to say no to that.”
“Good!” Mrs. Hudson visibly brightened. “Now I think you two should go back upstairs and start a fire or something to keep warm… In the fireplace!” She added.
“Before they get here, I want to tell you, I lo-” But before John could finish his sentence, the nurse hurried in and began checking John. Sherlock was thankful he wasn’t the one hooked up to a heart monitor, as he was pretty sure it would have spiked, or possibly flat-lined, at that moment.
“Simple,” Sherlock said as he peered through the small window in the door, “we wait until the hallway is empty, and then calmly make our way towards the lifts, and proceed to the lobby.”
And then they were lost; partially clothed, t-shirts abandoned, grinding against each other, moaning and panting in each other’s mouths. He didn’t know how it happened, but Sherlock found their positions reversed, mouth still thoroughly claimed, he was straddling John, John’s hands on his hips, dipping into the waistband of his jeans, guiding him down as John thrust up against him. Sherlock didn’t care if they were overheard, he just let go and let the overpowering
"It’s back to my parent’s place in Aldershot. It may not be as idyllic as your Christmas at the country estate, but it’s nice too. It’s the one time of year Dad puts forth some effort.” John sighed. “And Mum always finds a way to make it special each year. Every year she decorates the Christmas tree yard with a different theme. Like last year, she staged a battle of little plastic trolls against aliens; another was four little pyramids of oranges. Oh, and one year she made an entire pipe cleaner village.” He smiled, getting lost in the memories.
John’s exclamation seems to have an effect on Sherlock, as he begins to pick up his pace, abdominal muscles tensing. Sherlock’s thrusts become erratic, and without warning Sherlock is coming across their stomachs, John swallowing Sherlock’s yell as he cries out. John feeling his own climax build, rolls them over, and with a few fast thrusts, his orgasm crashing over him, his release mixing with Sherlock’s.
, with Sherlock, I’d be happy to pay you a meaningful sum of money on a regular basis to ease your way.”
Sherlock couldn’t say how long he tried to place the new evidence, or lack thereof, but he had started pacing when he heard footsteps approaching the door, clearly Molly.
The train pulls out of the station, and the platform soon empties, leaving a lone figure half hidden behind a pillar, still watching the now empty tracks.
“Wow, he must be something for you to be thinking about him all week.” Sarah smiled. “You much really like him.”
John wasn’t sure how long he stood there stock still, stirring at the empty air when his best friend had just been, it couldn’t have been more than a few seconds, when he heard it, the earsplitting shriek of a man yelling. As if struck by lightning, he was off, running faster than he’d thought possible towards the ledge.
“So soon?” John chuckled, already climbing on top of Sherlock and situating himself between Sherlock’s legs, nothing separating them but a terrycloth towel. “And here I thought I’d gotten all of that all out of your system during the honeymoon.”
“Please, Mr. Watson. I’d prefer it if we could sit.” And for some reason, though he doesn't want to, John finds himself sitting across from his kidnapper.
Cliffhanger! What's going to happen? Am I going to be nice, or am I going to throw a monkey wrench into things? You'll just have to keep reading to find out! >:D
Shit! Why did he say that? He had made things awkward. Now John was going to turn out to be just like everyone else, though maybe he’ll be more polite about severing ties with Sherlock ‘The Fairy’ Holmes. He knew it was too good to be true.
Sherlock merely chuckled. “John, you have astonishing musculature.” And continued to planting kisses along John’s back, branching out and kissing said muscles.
“You’ve been dateless and not dancing for a whole eleven minutes? Now that is criminal! Your date is clearly an idiot, ditch him and come dance with me.”
“It’d be easy enough to use a fake name to rent a safety deposit box well before the robbery,” Sherlock added. “Just store some documents or valuables in it for show. Then make trips to the box every month or so, before and after the theft, to develop a pattern.”
“Mr. Watson, please.” Lestrade said quietly. “We probably wouldn’t even be investigating if it weren’t for Sherlock. He found all the inconsistencies, he brought them to us.”
Just because John and Sherlock don’t notice or acknowledge how they've changed, doesn't mean others haven’t. John thinks only after her first date with Greg, has he’d seen Molly look as excited as she does when he shows up to the lab and spends the afternoon helping Sherlock. When Sherlock shows up with Molly to watch one of his football games, Greg’s
I want to apologize in advance if the format looks strange, I have very limited formatting skills. I hope it's not too distracting.
“That, and PC Andrews took a sample from one of the notebooks left on John’s desk.” Butler then produced a second piece of paper, clearly some of John’s biology notes. Apparently PC Andrews was smarter than Sherlock first thought.
“Oh don’t be ridiculous,” John said, letting out a breath of laughter, “of course you have a heart. You have the most amazing heart.”
“That’s good to know. But no, like I told the guys when they were taking the piss at roll call this morning, why would I pass up an opportunity to ride in a brand new F-Type, for three hours on a coach with those smelly bastards?”
“I appreciate you warning me, but I am a doctor.” He knew what to expect when it came to post operative patients, the IVs, the wires, and tubes. Sherlock was lying just on the other side of the door, John just wanted to get to Sherlock.
“I’d rather stand, if you don’t mind,” John replied, straightening his back and involuntarily assuming parade rest.
Fifteen minutes and several ‘just one more for the road’ kisses later, Sherlock was making his way up the path to his residence hall, feeling lighter than he’d ever felt in his life. He had kissed John, and been kissed by John; they had touched and held each other in ways Sherlock had only ever dared dream of. But best of all, he had a date – an honest to god date – with John Watson the next day. If he didn’t know it was impossible, he’d have said he was floating about two inches off the ground, Sherlock was nothing short of elated.
” It has been a couple of years since John last sucked a man off – not since… well not since Afghanistan – but he clearly hadn’t lost any of his skills.
And so we've reached the end. They of course lived happily ever after, solving crime, being ridiculous, and most importantly, being in love!
And later that night when Sherlock crawled into John’s bed once again, if he lay down a little closer than usual, hugged BuzzBee just a little tighter, neither he nor John thought to make any mention of it. Sherlock felt safe, protected, and so no matter what happened next, win or lose, at least he had that. He laid there for a while and watched as John slept, enjoying the closeness they shared – even if this was the only closeness they’d ever have – until finally sleep pulled him under as well.
Sherlock seemed taken aback but this, apparently unused to people not falling over themselves to be near him, John thought. Well, John Watson wasn’t ‘people’
“Alright, Sherlock, that’s enough, I you need to stay calm.” Lestrade murmured. “Sorry about that.” She turned, addressing Mr. Watson. “I’m heading the investigation into your son’s disappearance. I’ve actually gotten to know John a little bit over the years, and I want to assure you that finding John is my number one priority.”
“Why Sherlock Holmes, are you saying you think fate wanted us to meet?” Sherlock could hear the grin on John’s face.
I just wanted to let anyone who may be interested know that I've just posted the one-shot sequel / second epilogue to this fic!
“As if you don’t already know. I’m sure you paid one intern or another to follow me and deliver a full minute by minute report.”
“And that was him? She hired her ex-brother-in-law to blow up some of her flats all for an insurance pay out?”
“And is she right?” Sherlock asked. “Am I the one for you?” He already knew John was it for him, his ‘one’, but he’d never…
“You know,” Sherlock said, dropping his bag on one of the chairs, “this place kind of reminds me of that inn we stayed in after you won your championship game, that first year we met.”
“Oh, it was excellent!” Sherlock beamed, ecstatic to finally talk about a case with someone who wanted to hear it. “It started off as a simple suspected stalking. The police got nowhere, so they directed the girl to me…”
After three weeks, John is feeling good and feeling content with life at 221B and with Sherlock, then a black mood sets in.
I loved writing this, and I hope you enjoyed reading it. I'm almost done with the short one-shot sequel/epilogue to this (and it is a one-shot this time), so I hope to post that in a couple days.
I've been at a conference for work for the last few days, and I am bone tired. I actually nodded off while editing this chapter (not because this chapter is boring, I'm just that sleepy.) If there are more typos than usual, now you know why. (And feel free to point them out)
“I thought you said that the majority of Scotland Yard were idiots.” John countered, one eyebrow raised, a smile playing on his lips.
“What? Oh, yeah, he was just behind me.” John glanced over his shoulder to see the detective inspector approaching, still a few meters away. When he looked back, Sherlock was still there, still grinning, John could breathe again.
The rest of the ride passed in silence, but John could feel the man watching him the entire way until finally they pulled up in front of John’s flat.
John got into bed, and for ten minutes just sat with his textbook propped up against his knees. He couldn’t concentrate, he’d try to read a paragraph and the words would slip from his mind. Why the hell was Sherlock being so obstinate? Why couldn’t he see that John was just trying to help him? Sherlock had to be the one to do this, John couldn’t go behind his back and do it for him – even if it would be for the idiot’s own good – but he just wasn’t budging. John was just starting to come up with other approaches he could take, when he heard the creak of the floorboards outside his room.
John couldn’t help but laugh. For the first time in nearly a week, John was genuinely enjoying himself. It felt good.
“Really?” John let out a humorless laugh. “Because I seem to remember my phone being out in your sitting room. So tell me, how did it end up in here?”
“I saw Michelle turn a look at me several times while you were speaking with her.” He said, once they had settled into a gentle sway to the music. “Anything I should know about?”
Oh excellent! There were still a few hours until the physical therapist was due, that was more than enough time for the two of them to get into Scotland Yard’s system and see what was going on with the Lambeth Bomber case. After he destroyed the bugs Mycroft no doubt planted. Maybe they could look up some new cases too.
“I don’t skulk!” John just lifted an eyebrow. Damn him. “Anyway, after he realized I had nothing to do with the theft, or abandoning the car, I told him my observations, and he actually listened.”
“There was someone the other day who might have had an interest, and I thought about getting their number, but no. I just… I just couldn't bring myself to ask, I don’t think I’m ready to start dating again just yet. I just got ok with making friends again,” he added with a self-deprecating chuckle.
“I have a phone. If you wanted to talk, you could have simply phoned me, on my phone. Clearly you could have found the number.”
“Oh yes I do.” John forwent peppering every inch of Sherlock’s body with kisses – with the way Sherlock was whining, there was no way he’d last – and took him in completely to the base.
“No need for anything fancy,” John shook his head. “I’m fine with lowkey and causal. How about Chinese? I’m kind of in the mood for maybe some hot and sour soup.”
Soon after Jim Moriarty made his entrance, a tall, well muscled, gun toting man who just screamed 'ex-military’, appeared at his shoulder. It took only a nod from his boss, and the man shoved the butt of his gun into John’s gut, sending him falling backwards, and wrenched Sherlock away, manhandling him out of the room. Sherlock could still hear John yelling for him, as he was marched into a second room and forced down and restrained in one of two chairs. This must have been the room where John was beaten, and it looked like it was Sherlock’s turn. Only after he was strapped into place, the man disappeared, and Sherlock was left alone.
Sherlock could feel his mind atrophying with every passing second as he flipped through the channels, searching for something – anything – to occupy him while he was trapped in bed with a bulky metal cage around his left leg. What passed for daytime entertainment painted a very grim picture of the state of today’s society. Then there was Lestrade coming to “check-in” on him and take his statement, then not even bothering to tell him about any new cases, or at the very least, bring him a laptop or new phone – his was damaged in the fire. And the pain meds were absolutely no help. Sure they dulled the pain in his leg and torso – not fully since he wasn’t allowed ‘the good stuff’ –  but they also made his head feel fuzzy, and did nothing to end the unending, all-consuming boredom. Honestly, this was almost worse than being crushed and trapped in a burning building.
“No, no. It’s… It’s fine. I don’t mind.” Sherlock mumbled, moving to close the space between him and John, vividly remembering that night on the gym floor, feeling every bit of unspoken tension from the last month and a half, from the last year.
John nodded, humming absentmindedly as he took a seat. “I guess, but she seems nice. Is she your girlfriend?” He asked. Sherlock did sound a little rude and dismissive of her, but that could have just been him tired as a result of his injuries… or he was just kind of a crap boyfriend.
John takes a deep breath, “I’ve given it a lot of thought, and I’m going to join the army to serve as a combat doctor.”
“That’s the spirit! Now what about her?” Bill asked, pointing to a short, pretty blonde with a pixie cut, laughing with her friends, “She’s your type.”
“Plenty of other stuff we can do that doesn’t require condoms.” Sherlock breathes, still hovering over John.
Without another word, John quickly pulls Sherlock towards a shabby looking row house, and through the door of the second flat on the left. Before the door is even fully closed, Sherlock has John forced up against the wall, mouth attacking John’s, as his hands start working at John’s belt. Never known for idle hands, John starts on the buttons of Sherlock’s unbelievably posh shirt
“But it’s still light outside. I’ve never had bedtime when the sun is still out.” Sherlock pouted, swaying a bit on his feet. He had slept the entire cab ride over, but like the six foot toddler he was, was insisting he ‘didn’t sleep’ and ‘wasn’t tired.’
“John’s not… he’s not my boyfriend.” Sherlock clarified quickly. Why did he just do that? It was true, John
Despite what he tried to claim, it was clear as day that Sherlock wasn’t entirely fine. When he closed one of their cold cases, he always seemed to want to fidget and hobble around the flat for a bit, probably to let off the little burst of adrenaline he got from a solve. Sherlock should have been bouncing off the walls after solving a fresh murder – Julia Stoner’s stepfather was the head of a cosmetics company and was slowly poisoning her by way of tainted ‘test samples’, all in the hopes of getting her inheritance before she wed her fiancé.  Or he should have started testing the samples John saw him nick, but instead, he hadn’t moved from the spot on the couch where John left him, his head was thrown back against the back of the couch, his eyes were shut tight, his teeth clenched, and his hands hadn’t left his left thigh. Sherlock wasn’t fine, he was clearly in pain.
“What else happened?” John asked, he could tell by Dr. Cook’s tone and language that there was something she wasn’t telling him. His nightmare wasn’t over yet.
“Then I’ll tell you what I told you last time, I’m fine. Now leave me alone.” Sherlock scowled. John was honestly surprised he didn’t stop his feet like a toddler, the stubborn sod.
“Uuh, breakfast. Breakfast is boring. Plus I don’t have anything in.” Sherlock grumbled, slumping down.
“Ok, I think we’ve tortured Sherlock long enough. I can practically hear him sulking from here.” Mr. Watson said loudly, pulling the curtain open again.
Sherlock wasn’t sure how Mycroft knew about their occasional sleeping habits. He wouldn’t have put it past the git to have installed cameras in John and Mike’s flat. But it shouldn’t matter that Sherlock sometimes shared John’s bed. John’s bed was soft, and it was far better for his recovery than the couch. Most of his injuries had healed, but his ribs were still tender after all. Anyway, it was all completely innocent, there were no ulterior motives behind the arrangement – at least on John’s end – and Mycroft needed to learn to leave well enough alone. Sherlock could only imagine the upheaval if Mycroft decided to drop his little funny innuendos around John. Doing them a favor or not, Mycroft was a nosy, overfed, misinformed, arse.
“Too late, I know now.” John beamed again. Anymore of that and Sherlock was afraid his heart would skip an unhealthy number of beats. “So I expect to see you at the game tomorrow!”
As John and Seb struggled, the butt of the gun flew backwards, and Sherlock’s ribs exploded in pain; but even as the air was knocked out of his lungs, he still hung on. His arms tightened around Seb’s neck; squeezing as hard as he could, not hard enough to kill him, just enough to cut off the oxygen to his brain long enough to render him unconscious – Sherlock knew his strength. He could feel Seb’s muscles tensing, his windpipe constricting. Any moment, Seb would be out; any second and John would be free. Seb started to slow, his movements turned sluggish. Just… a little… more.
If John didn't know any better he’d swear he entered the place with royalty. Angelo himself came rushing to great them as they stepped through the door. He seats them in “the best seat in the house”, the front window with the L shaped seating. Clasping a clearly uncomfortable Sherlock around the shoulders, Angelo explains how Sherlock got him off a murder charge. He leaves them with a promise that everything is on the house for Sherlock and his friend, absolutely beaming at the word friend.
So you know how case files and human spleens put Sherlock in a good mood (and a non-bored Sherlock puts John in a good mood)? Well seeing lovely comments from even lovelier readers, puts me in a good mood. And when I'm in a good mood, I'm less inclined to re-write this story and do things to keep the boys apart or make them upset. You wouldn't want me to make John move out, would you?
“Yes, right.” Sherlock said, clearing his throat. “John has agreed to move in with me, making me happier than I can say, so we wanted to invite you all over, and pretty much rub your noses in our happiness.”
“Come on Sherlock; let’s give the Watsons a little privacy.” Mrs. Holmes finally said, guiding Sherlock, who had inexplicably found himself back sitting on the side of John’s bed, back over to his side of the room.
“Which you’re sure is desirable when it comes to food?” John repeated, chuckling. “You try to act like your above it all, the normal demands of being human, but don’t think I don’t hear your stomach grumbling.”
They spent the final bit of time before Meredith the physical therapist’s final check talking about Baker Street, taking bets on how many times Mycroft was going to try to butt in – John said once a week, Sherlock said every time one of them breathed funny – and what they should expect of each other as flatmates. Soon enough Meredith had given Sherlock the go ahead, discharge papers were signed, instructions were given – that’s when Sherlock started to get antsy – follow up appointments were made, and they were out the door and in a Mycroft provided town car headed for Baker Street.
John didn’t even wait to hear if Lestrade had any updates, the moment Sherlock handed McCall over – or rather, stopped pinning McCall and allowed some PC to take over – John dragged him over to the stairs leading up from the bank, and forced him to sit. Just because Sherlock looked alright at first glance didn’t mean he really was. The man was astonishingly good at ignoring and hiding when he was hurt… Well, to a point he was, John just happened to be better at seeing through the mask. John needed to be sure, he needed Sherlock to be alright.
