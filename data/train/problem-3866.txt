"Go for it,” Jimmy said. “I want to feel it."
okay. And so he pressed up, and kissed the only two people who'd ever had him at their mercy without making him feel helpless.
"Yeah. I am. I'm getting old, Sammy. I know it doesn't seem like it, but I was in Hell a long-ass time. I'm tired of being alone, and he doesn't care that I'm damaged goods. I love him. So does Cas."
Maybe they could make this work. Maybe it didn't have to end badly.
Sam."
of this place you're staying?"
It was only a split second. The image was gone, but the chill in the air lingered.
"I... Yeah..." Dean sniffled slightly as the crying threatened to start up again. At least he was past the weird laughter. "Thanks. I wasn't... it was kind of a surprise, to be honest."
"It - " Dean tried his best to explain. "It’s not that. I like this, I just... it's stupid. You're going to think it's stupid."
"Just remember the no choking thing. I can't deep throat and trying is just going to end up with a lot of vomit and me crying in a corner not knowing how I got there."
Dean stopped. Jimmy didn't mean the gas station.
Their shifting caused Cas' cock to push against something especially fun. Dean gasped.
Dean's hands came to rest on Jimmy's back. Out of curiosity, he sought out the spot that had such an effect on Cas earlier. Jimmy hissed in a breath, arched into Dean's body, tightening fingers into his hair. Every one of his muscles felt hard, and then soft. Well. Except the one. That one was still pretty hard.
He felt a little stupid even saying this.
Jimmy nodded, rubbing his face, smoothing his hair. "Right. Sure, yes. Castiel, I'm running kinda hot, can you... bring down my body temperature, a little? Is that a thing you can do?" Fuzzed out eyes, a sigh of relief.
else touched us like this, Cas would just... so much smiting. Fifty foot radius."
Cas' thumb came down to play with Dean's bottom lip, the one currently stretched around his cock.
"The way I feel about you…” said Jimmy. “This is new."
“Glad I could help.” There was a warm fluttery feeling building in Dean’s chest. “There's a lot to be afraid of out there. Shouldn't have to be afraid of who you are." Dean put his hand on Cas' knee. “I'm glad he has us, Cas. I’m glad I have you guys too.”
He brought one shaking hand almost to Cas' hair. "Please?"
Castiel looked at him. Then the space between his eyebrows crinkled.
Castiel's arms felt safe around him in a way he'd been afraid they wouldn't. The hand on Dean's neck felt heavy, and moved over his back and shoulders, kneading into the muscles in a way that felt diagnostic more than therapeutic. Dean didn't know if that meant Cas could see everything he'd done written on his soul and was still willing to touch him. Or if maybe he just didn't know. Either way, Dean found the thought reassuring.
"I'd ask how you got good at this - but I think I have a pretty good idea."
And some point, without realizing it, he got a few stray tears in his eyes. Not a lot. Cas silently kissed them off his cheeks and out of his tear ducts.
"Your scenarios were beautiful. And tempting. My vessel does not think I did his any justice."
"Yeah?" said Sam. "And what are you going to do about it? The only one here who hasn't broken and done terrible things is
"Vessel. If you begin to apologize, we will be here until Death is our only company."
A clear invitation, should he choose to take it.
Dean said something entirely unintelligible. He made himself wake up a bit more. "Don't gotta impress me, Cas. I'm good." A pause. "Not squishing you?"
hurt. But I want you to hear me say this, Castiel. While I can talk to you like this. You feel so good inside me."
“He can wait his turn. Right now I get you all to myself." Dean claimed Jimmy’s lips in a way that made it clear exactly how serious he was about that. Careful not to pull, he got a solid grip on Jimmy’s hair, and used that to direct things. His kiss wasn't rough exactly. But it certainly wasn't gentle. Jimmy made a sound against his mouth, and arched his whole body up. Dean broke the kiss, but kept his hand where it was.
Jimmy sat back on his heels, and seemed to forget about the lube for a second as he just looked at Dean, thighs apart, relaxed in Cas' arms.
"Yes."
But Cas could of course teleport, and blinked right into shotgun. Dean should have seen that coming.
“Jimmy. You don't... He was so
"Cas? You're amazing. I don't know what I could do to deserve you." Dean's hands started at Castiel's hips and made their way upwards until they could coax the coat off those beautiful shoulders. "I'm sorry I laughed. You did exactly what I asked." Dean decided not to explain that there was just something about the serious look on Castiel's face that made the whole situation so much funnier.
"Yeah," said Jimmy. "And I'll be there as backup, so."
Sam laughed. "
– and hung up.
Castiel sat on the edge of the bed, with Dean in his arms as he unwound around him. Dean was sitting on Cas' bare thigh for a moment, before there was a hand at his shoulder, another on his ribcage, carefully lowering him down to a space between Castiel's spread legs. Castiel's hand was there too, leaning Dean's cheek against his inner thigh. And he was very, very hard. Dean licked his lips.
"I'm weirdly nervous."
He closed his eyes and told himself that the world was already ending, it wasn’t like he could make things much worse. A hand came around his back, but Cas stayed quiet. Dean held on and took slow breaths and tried to tell himself he was allowed to have this.
Dean changed his approach
"I'm fine. Promise. Wide awake." Dean’s argument would have been stronger if he hadn't been partially asleep in Cas' arms. But this was important. "Jimmy's probably still freaked. Need to tell him... ‘s not his fault."
Dean gentled, smoothing his hand over Cas' side like a cowboy calming a horse. "It's okay buddy."
"No. That one's fine." Another headboard flashed through the back of his mind. One with metal shackles. Modern. Stainless steel. Like a fancy kitchen.
Jimmy took a second to just smile. "Better believe it, Dean Winchester."
Cas pulled him close and held him steady, keeping him still with those immovable arms.
"I know Cas is invulnerable and everything, but he got hurt somehow. You don’t have to talk about it, but you'll let me know if it gets worse? I know I’m paranoid and overprotective. It’s my job."
Dean nuzzled against it affectionately, leaving open mouthed kisses along the length of one side. Cas made a pleased, humming sound.
Castiel touched the skin over his shoulder, and then very deliberately lined up his own fingers with the handprint.
"Cas, I can't make sense of that."
Dean was still held in balance between them, and couldn't see what was going on exactly, but he could
Jimmy's hand was on his shoulder again.
Dean flopped onto the mattress. Made a noise that sounded pained before shifting enough to get his feet on the bed. Then he starfished out completely, not looking as he slung an arm haphazardly across Jimmy's body, pressing his face against the sheets. Trench coat. More trench coat. Chin. Dean made a muffled noise that conveyed the idea
"Still respect me in the morning?" he said.
Dean exhaled in relief.
"Let me know when you figure out the
"Same." Dean blinked a few times before hiding his face in the pillow again.
"Yeah..." Jimmy was talking on his exhales. "You could hurt me, if you went too fast, or deep, or wrong. But you won't. I know you won’t. Every time you move your fingers even a little. Totally new feeling. Intimate. That's the word I was thinking of."
"... staying at the Stardust Motel in El Dorado, Kansas. Do you need the address."
Jimmy stilled, closed his eyes, took a few calming breaths. Gently, he slid his fingers out of Dean.
. With more dirty, less dancing, obviously. But the same deal. We’ll have him dancing the horizontal mambo in no time." Dean could picture it. Him behind Cas, carefully correcting his technique while “Hungry Eyes” played in the background. Touching him a whole lot more than was strictly necessary.
"So what you're trying to tell me. Is that Castiel. Is somehow. Our prison daddy."
Dean just shook his head. One hand still covering his mouth, the other wrapped around his middle.
. But he’d told Cas he needed to ask. Couldn’t immediately contradict that, that wasn’t fair. Dean wasn’t sure what he needed but at least he knew what he
"Okay. Um, Jimmy can hear me too, right? I know I keep asking but I'm still kind of confused."
Cas pulled blindly towards him and kissed him, hard and deep, opening him up. Fingers twisted into Dean's hair. And Dean himself was soft and pliant, a warmth melting through every ache in his body. Cas took the momentum from the kiss and used it to straddle him, pushing Dean back and down into the mound of pillows. Dean's limbs were heavy, and in the total absence of pains he hadn't even noticed he felt, he could have sworn he was floating. He meant to say something. It just turned into another soft, sleepy noise of happiness.
Jimmy nodded, and began to purposefully slow down his breathing.
about things made it harder to stop thinking and just
"You know that’s not a right way for me to think."
"The problem isn't guys is it? You were fine with me." Jimmy closed his eyes for a second, and said low: "Give us a minute, okay?" His eyes opened, and looked at Dean. They were blue like Castiel's but they weren't Castiel's.
Jimmy's eyes fluttered as his embarrassment started evaporating. "I should know this. It's not like you haven't been with this body before, and it's not like I wasn't there..."
"Yes. Yes, so much still good."
“It just... kind of hit me, is all. Just this idea that - I get to do this. I'm allowed to do this. With my... my husband."
"Dean Winchester. You have given me a name. You have made me myself. I have remade you, and you have remade me. There is no vow I can give that I have not made before. There is nothing you would ask for I would not give you."
Dean shuddered.
“My vessel also loves your arms and shoulders. There is a lot of material that involves you pinning him to the floor."
"It's not his fault, Sam." Dean felt better. Safe. They were going to clear this up.
"It's... the idea of both of us interacting with his true form at once. He's not used to you. You’re really… I don’t know,
Dean was loving it. "Touch him. I know you wanna." He wasn't entirely sure which one of them he was talking to. It didn't really matter.
Jimmy moved against his throat. Then very, very tentatively, brushed a kiss in the spot he'd been nuzzling.
and then it wasn't fine. He left their foreheads touching. "I
Dean was starting to get worried. He was – No. He didn't even want to think the thought directly.
"Yes." Sam's voice was tight and controlled. "Dean I - I'm glad you're talking to me.
“You need to look at yourself in a
Dean leaned in slowly, and captured Castiel's lips in his best wake-a-sleeping-princess kiss. He drew away, only to leave another gentle one at the edge of Castiel's jaw. And another at the juncture of his neck and shoulder. At last, he brought their joined hands to his mouth, and turned then to kiss Castiel's wrist. "I think you might be the most beautiful thing in the universe."
"People make mistakes. You tried. That's all anyone can do." This wasn't just about Jimmy. Even if Dean wasn't going to admit that.
? Desire, love. But also... intention and force."
"Touch him, vessel."
"Always. Don't want anyone else. Just you."
. You're getting screwy on me. I'm fine. I'm safe.” Over the phone, he heard Sam draw a breath. “Cas rebelled against heaven because he didn't like the way the other angels were treating you. He
"You're lucky it’s not loaded."
"I guess that's true. You know I wouldn’t say no to your mouth. Or to your fingers. Or tongue. Or - well, eventually your dick, but it’s looking kind of big right now. Need to work up to that. Mostly, I just want
Cas lifted Dean up higher, and bent his head to close his lips over just the head of Dean's cock, one indulgent taste, before lowering him back down.
Maybe the shower wasn't the best place to do it. Dean felt light headed. And a lot less sure of himself now that he wasn't dreaming.
Jimmy was slowly coming back to himself, small movements and tiny noises. He opened his eyes, and looked at Dean. Rolled in close.
Jimmy beamed. "Might've worn them if I had them."
Dean was suddenly very aware of the fact this was Cas. And Cas was shirtless. Straddling him. Dean had thought about this. He'd be lying if he said he hadn’t, but he had expected it to be sexy. Instead, it was breathtaking. Dean could feel how small he was on a cosmic scale and yet Cas was
“Yeah, what he said,” Dean retorted, jerking a thumb at Cas. Then he pulled a scowl. “Hey, wait a minute…”
He put his elbows up on the dock and pulled himself up a bit, the better to see his friend.
is on. You like this show.”
“Alright, I’ll try that,” Cas agreed, and they resumed their lovemaking. Within a few moments, Castiel’s voice joined Dean’s in a chorus of grunts and moans, the vibration in his throat traveling up Dean’s dick and driving his excitement higher.
“And now he’s trying to help mom. Tryin’ his ass off. He kinda grows on you…”
Too much. He’d said too much. “I’m sorry.” More silence. He wondered if he should tell Dean about the second demon. Give up and change the subject.
“We need to get Jack—and Mom—back here first,” Sam interjected.
“Ok, so, what’s the plan, guys?” Sam butted in. “We’ve got at least one sleeping bag in the trunk, a couple of space blankets…” he reached under the seat to rummage a moment, “feels like two bottles of water… and I’ve got a box of granola bars in the back. Dean, you’ve got what—half a sandwich here?”
Dean frowned.
“Yeah. Yeah you are. I get the feeling you’ll be an even better one now.” Then Dean grinned. “You and your little mini-me. Spock and Baby Spock.”
Come on, Dean—Jack’s never been swimming. It’s a perfect night and we’ve got this place to ourselves. Not to mention we’re all nasty and could use a rinse.” He turned to look at Jack and grinned. “C’mon, let’s go.”
He didn’t know how long he’d been in a sort of altered state, when Dean’s voice broke through.
Cas lifted his chin, but still didn’t look at Dean. “I was wrong. I didn’t know that syncing with you would make such a difference. But it did.” Cas turned to him then, and looked at him hard. “I didn’t just feel your junk, Dean. I felt your heart. And you felt
Dean pulled Baby up in front of their ground-floor room. Cas hadn’t even moved while Sam registered at the office, which had Dean more than a little concerned. He slid out of the car and opened Castiel’s door a little too fast; his friend had been leaning against it, and nearly tumbled out into his arms.
“I’m not drunk enough for this,” Dean muttered, then sighed, hand on his hip. “But I don’t wanna wait that long.”
It was Dean’s turn to be amazed. “You’re
Dean’s brows raised a little higher. Was he surprised? Or had Castiel not made himself clear? He decided to take another tack, leaning closer and looking at Dean intently, willing him to understand.
“Except I’m down for the count right now. Can’t bounce back like I used to, but we can try… hey…” Cas had wrapped a hand around his dick, fingers tingling icy-hot, and suddenly he was back in business with another stiffy. “Wow, you should bottle that.”
Castiel was
They’d both laughed, but Castiel had realized that he indeed loved
to save his ship and crew from crashing to Earth, sacrificing himself in the process. Spock says a gut-wrenching goodbye as Kirk is dying in the decontamination chamber. Kahn crashes his ship into San Francisco but escapes the wreckage, and a grief-stricken Spock goes after him with a vengeance. Cas never tires of watching the Spock and Kahn fight scene, but…
For a moment or two, nobody moved or spoke.
That was all in the past now. And while the future did not exactly look bright, there were lights again. Dean had forgiven Castiel, and he found that he could forgive Dean, too. And now Jack was here on a mission from Billie to save the world, he had his soul back, and it seemed that Dean was possibly even pleased—might even forgive him for what he’d done to Mary.
“Hey…” he murmured back. “It’s ok… don’t be sorry. What can I do?”
Cas seemed to be thinking the same thoughts. Dean glanced over to see the angel striding up beside him, feet crunching in the gravel.
father. Jack may age or not; if he does, I’d like to age with him. I’d like to grow old with all of you.”
Cas turned frightened eyes to his, the corners of his mouth tugging down, and Dean was suddenly desperate to fix him.
“Dean,” Castiel growled, “if I weren’t here, would you crawl into that sleeping bag with Sam, or would you just fall asleep and die there at the wheel?”
“Minor… Listen, you’re not…”
“Dude, we’ve had this conversation. You’re my best friend. What about
through him like lightning. Oh,
Cas took the notebook and marched out into the living area and over to the porch door, unlocking it.
Castiel realized that Dean’s thighs were trembling. “Are you cold?” he asked, snapping out of his reverie.
Cas’ legs began to sink, and he kicked a bit, propelling himself away from Dean, who grabbed his hand to stay him… and held onto it. Castiel opened his eyes and looked up at Dean, and the connection sent a jolt of
!” Dean crowed.
“Dean,” Cas breathed in between kisses, “Tell me what you need. What can I do for you?”
“You both have very proportional genitals. I just want to be clear,” Castiel said, looking from one man to the other.
“Fuckin’ hell,” he muttered, wide-eyed, and vanished into the restroom.
Castiel’s fingers ghosted softly over the top of Dean’s, and Dean could feel the angel’s body beginning to relax in his arms.
trance, when a billboard loomed out of the gloom ahead.
Dean muttered to himself, incredulous.
“Even if… y’know… you came back for Jack. I don’t care, I just…”
“Yeah,” Sam chipped in. “Thanks, Buddy.”
Dean swam over and stood behind him, chest-high in the rippling waves. “Step down Cas. You can touch the bottom here.”
” Dean growled. This was
“Does it still?”
now can you? Come now, Castiel and I made an arrangement, and you all got what you wanted. You live, boy. I see you even found your soul. But Castiel’s happiness called to me—and now he is mine. That was the deal.”
He glanced back again. No, he hadn’t been imagining things—and Jack hadn’t stopped. What the hell?
So he simply gazed at his friend—taking the sight in hungrily. Cas was beautiful laid out before him in the moonlight, throat open, chest bared, fingers relaxed, dick… wet. Dean’s mouth filled with saliva.
The only radio station that came in featured an overwrought meteorologist ranting about the blizzard of the century, warning every soul in the listening area to stay off the roads.
“Rest then,” Dean said. “Here…” and he grabbed Cas by first one ankle and then the other, wrestling his friend’s boots off.
“Why?”
He took care of business as fast as he could and fled the building, glad to see that Sam was still picking out just the right banana in the deli section. Maybe he’d have a minute or two to put this thing to bed and get the angel’s dick out of his head. Mouth. Whatever.
Jack smiled back and they started for the car, feet sloughing through pine needles as Dean checked himself and made sure he still had his knife and his .45 with him. Just as they reached the trail with the wooden stairs that climbed toward the road, a long howl echoed from the lake.
Castiel sighed, turning his gaze out the front window. “Dean, when you leave Las Vegas, do you leave your winnings behind?”
Dean finds a tick in the worst of places, and Sam is no help. Thankfully, Cas comes to the rescue.
Dean glared. “Just give ‘em to me, bitch.”
“It’s the Empty. I made a deal and it’s come for me.”
“Hey, whatsa matter?”
The angel grunted uncharacteristically, lifting a hand to his head. “I think so,” he answered.
“Oh. The talk about sex. Yes.” Jack visibly relaxed and smiled again.
He was going to make Cas cum so hard, and he couldn’t wait to watch that cock blow its load, and see what Cas’ orgasm face looked like.
Dean pulled the keys from the ignition and opened his door, the wind catching it and nearly tearing the handle from his grip. “Ho!” Stepping out into the snowy ditch, he promptly sunk to his waist. He looked through the car to see Sam do the same on the other side, both of them trying to manhandle their doors closed again.
“You are strong, young one,” the Empty sneered at Jack, while Dean and Sam watched wide-eyed from the floor. “But you can’t destroy
“Gonna have to, aren’t ya?”
“Perhaps I did,” he replied, squinting in the darkness at all their shadowed faces.
“You don’t need any equipment, buddy. Just go have fun. Make sure you pay attention to both of ‘em—that’s key. You’re gonna have four tits and two clits to work on, and that’ll keep you plenty busy.”
stop Michael?”
Castiel felt it was now or never.
“That time Ramiel stuck you and we all thought you were gonna croak in that barn, you… you said you loved me. You loved all of us…” And suddenly Dean recognized the emotion of that moment, the thing that had swelled in his chest that night, that he’d pushed down, terrified of losing it. Of
“Very much.”
“Hell, no!”
Dean snorted, his head hanging down.
but there was no more burning grace, no more devouring cold… and no more blackness. The Empty had gone.
Just knowing Dean was willing to kill the boy had been dreadful—and then to suffer Dean’s all-consuming anger and rejection for days after Jack died... it was enough to bring the angel to his proverbial knees. Enough to send him away from the only family he had left. Nearly enough to send him back to the Empty, if he could have borne the thought of giving an ounce of satisfaction to the ghastly Keeper.
Dean took the love scene as a cue to head out to the kitchen for another beer, leaving Sam, Cas and Jack still lounging in Sam’s room in front of the tube. Things always felt a little too steamy in that windowless cell when the sexy times heated up onscreen. Like watching porn with your kids. Awkward.
“So how many vamps do you think are in there, Cas?” Sam asked again.
. Hey, Cas…” Dean turned from his brother to keep from killing him—turned to look at his secret weapon in the back seat. “Can you… y’know… mojo us back on the road?”
“Well I
“Well, it ain’t. Most of the porn you see is just actors getting paid to act out some pervert’s fantasy. Real life is different.” Dean sat back and held Jack’s eye. “So listen. Most women don’t want to be treated like they’re in a porno. You need to respect them and ask for what you want like a gentleman. Sometimes they’re gonna say no, and you say ok. Sometimes they’re gonna say yes, and then you gotta be ready.” Dean leaned forward and pulled open Sam’s top drawer, fishing out the box of Trojans he knew his brother kept there, because he’d snaked a couple. He tossed the box at Jack.
“Perhaps all this individual masturbation is unnecessary,” he suggested gently. “You and I… while our bodies are still young enough, perhaps you and I could find some release and contentment together. I would certainly be willing to try. More than willing.”
Castiel couldn’t help but smile, a flush of warm energy enveloping him. “I love you too,” he replied, and stepped into the hall, closing the door softly behind him.
“I’m guessin’ there were never any twins,” Dean growled flatly. But then his tone became soft, almost pleading. “What is it you want from me, Cas?”
“No. It’s been very quiet. I see one demon at the moment; he seems to be waiting for others to show up.”
Cas swallowed loudly, and then they both seemed to go boneless at once. Coming back was slow; it all felt too good. The breeze through the window caressing his skin, Cas’ thigh under his cheek, the warmth of Castiel’s body close to his and the angel’s fingers spread on his hip. His well-used dick. He lifted a lazy hand and ran it up Cas’ flank. He could get used to this. “Still with me, buddy?”
Sam stifled a laugh, eyes twinkling. “Guess the truth is out…”
They crawled back inside the car snow-covered, wind-burned and half-frozen. Dean’s fingers burned and tingled as he fumbled with the keys and started the ignition again. The air blasting from the heater was luke-warm, but it felt like a desert wind compared to outside.
And the whole Lucifer vs. Michael thing… he didn’t even want to think about the implications if they couldn’t nip it in the bud. Would the archangels be looking for Sam and Dean’s meatsuits again? What could Cas possibly do to help? Each time he’d tried to go up against an archangel, it ended very poorly. Dean couldn’t watch it happen again—he just couldn’t. But when Cas was on a mission, there was no stopping him from martyring himself, or worse.
Sam climbed out into the blizzard, and they both watched him stagger back to the trunk against the wind. Dean cringed to think about how he was going to have to take everything out back at the bunker to dry and clean it. Snow and guns—not a good combo. He really should be back there helping to hold the trunk lid—but Sam’s orangutan arms seemed up to the task. So what was taking so long? Finally, Sam had stowed the shovel and slammed the trunk again, and Dean could see him floundering back to the passenger side with an armload of sleeping bag. He was moving pretty slow…
“I’m thinking…” he still stood very close to Castiel, keeping ahold of his wrist, and his eyes wandered over Cas’ face and down his chest. “I’m thinking I wanna know what it is you’ve been watching all these years that you think you wanna do with me,” he growled softly.
, for Chrissake, and this time he wasn’t covered with a swarm of bees.
A million questions popped into Dean’s head. “Why are you singing? And
Jack asked, excitement in his voice. He stopped and turned back toward the cabin.
Little Dean felt rock solid behind his zipper. Little Dean had an endless supply of bad, bad ideas. Amazingly, Big Dean’s heart seemed to be game right now to try them.
Jack sighed, standing up straight and backing up a step. “What I had to. The Empty can only take demons and angels.”
Dean stared at him wide-eyed, startled. “I’m thinking…” Then he shook Castiel’s left hand off and grabbed his wrist, pulling him back and into the corner of the laundromat where the vending machines hummed next to the restroom door, and the two of them were no longer visible through the big plate glass windows that fronted on Main Street in Lebanon, Kansas.
“Where?”
Dean had planned to make it back to the bunker that night, but they’d only logged about two hours in the Impala before the Motel 6 sign loomed up from the side of the highway, and he found himself heading up the exit ramp.
“I want it to be pleasurable for… for all of us. And I’d like to know about your equipment.”
“Dean?”
“You shoulda let Cas go,” Dean chastised. He turned again to see Cas laying his fingers on Sam’s cheekbones, and Sam gasping, startled at the electric icy-hot current warming his skin. Sam raised his hands and grasped onto the angel’s wrists.
The thought of falling into bed with Dean sent a frisson of electricity through him. “Dean…”
“Yeah, well, that’s as far as it goes anymore. Do you know how long it’s been since I’ve been laid?”
“You can see Jupiter?”
Castiel was beginning to find the bickering frustrating. It certainly wasn’t helping them to focus, and he was having trouble following their logic now. “What does having the biggest dick have to do with any of this?” he piped in. “Just because Sam’s penis is larger doesn’t mean he’s a better fighter. It seems irrelevant.”
“Hey, don’t bother with that,” Dean said, stepping toward Cas and grabbing his elbow. “C’mon, just… come out of here. I’m tired. Let’s go…” He suddenly wanted nothing more than to rewind, to try again, to just show Cas that he could be there and be supportive and unselfish—and not make everything about him and his dick.
“I think I will be.”
They seemed to be driving right into the storm, snow falling thicker and faster. Drifts were beginning to form across the highway, the Impala plowing through each of them with a satisfying
Dean glanced over at him, did a little double take. Castiel smiled. Dean’s mouth crooked up at the corner, his eyes shining.
“Peace and long life to us all.”
“Well, I’m feeling attracted to girls right now. But when you have sex with Castiel, is it like the pornos? You don’t need to use a condom, do you?”
“Yeah, ok, so I was wrong that time. But I’m not wrong now. You’re afraid, and you’re letting it get the best of you.”
Sam typed.
“Do you?”
“Hey, every kid does it. No great shakes.”
“I can’t exactly claim credit,” Cas said.
“Take a couple of those. You gotta know how to use condoms, and you gotta use ‘em every time. If you don’t, you’re liable to knock a girl up, and I don’t know what happens when you get knocked up by a Nephilim, but I can’t believe it’s good.”
If Sam said anything at all, though, he’d probably say something along the lines of “Jesus, you two, get your own room already.” Cause Sam, like everybody else human and otherwise, already thought they had a “thing” going on—even if he rarely alluded to it.
Castiel frowned, confused. “Why would you want me to make your nose fall off?”
“Shoot.”
Both brows went up. Sam surreptitiously leaned forward in his chair and sent a side-eye Jack’s way. Dean had to suppress a smile as Sam leaned back again, his expression a mixture of amusement and slight horror, which mirrored his own feelings.
“It was what any of you would have done, if you could,” Jack observed. “It was only logical.”
He’d gone way past the point of no return, and he wanted Cas more than he could ever recall wanting anything else in his crazy life. He wanted to show Cas just how much the angel meant to him, in every man-love way conceivable. Even if that shit had felt inconceivable yesterday.
Castiel’s penis seemed to suddenly be taking up far too much space in his pants. He squirmed, trying to adjust himself and relieve some pressure. Across the street, a second shape moved behind the curtains. “You really liked that, then,” he murmured into the phone. “The penis inside you. It felt good?”
“Shit. Shit, shit, shit.”
Cas allowed himself a smirk. “I will certainly be able to kick
The coldness began to creep slowly upward, now at his ankles. He was pinned in place, helpless to move. His grace had no escape either, and it began to swirl about inside him, slowly, moving earthward like water being sucked down a deep, dark drain.
Sam grunted. “Can’t stop sh…shaking…”
“You were wrong… in the barn,” Castiel said, his tone implying that Dean might just be wrong again, “I wasn’t going to heal. I was dying.”
for Chrissake. Dean was still riding high on having his angel back in the Impala, where he belonged. Although it would have been nice if The Big Empty’s douchey cryptkeeper had sent him back juiced up instead of at a quarter tank—like he was when he died.
“And I would very much like to revisit the experience,” Cas said, adding carefully, “someday… when you’re ready.”
“No more fuckin’ monkey business tonight,” Dean slurred into his pillow. He said it as much to his dick as to Cas, but Cas replied solemnly.
“Hey… you ok?” Dean reached into the back to grab his brother’s shoulder, as the angel helped him to sit up.
Dean gave up protesting and sighed again. “Thanks, pal.” Castiel’s eyes sparkled in the dark, glowing so faintly. Cas’ hand relaxed on his shoulder, lying heavier, his thumb playing over Dean’s collarbone and leaving a tingling trail.
Moments later, tucked back cleanly into his jeans, he slumped in Castiel’s lap, doing what could only be described as cuddling his best bud. Cas rubbed his back, his body warm and comforting (and rumbling like a Harley), and Dean drifted, so sweetly satisfied. He could fall asleep right here with his head on Cas’ shoulder, except…
OK, he told himself, so the dude is not two years old but looks 17 and maybe he’s learned about spanking the monkey already… or maybe this really is the first time he’s discovered pocket pool.
Then Castiel’s warm hand slid inside his flannel, flattening against his t-shirt, over his sternum. The angel’s fingers spread out. “Breathe,” Castiel instructed.
Dean opened his lips around the smooth head and ran his tongue down the veined shaft as he took the whole damn thing, plunging his face into Cas’ lap, gulping greedily, reveling in the taste of warm skin, salty fluid, the brush of Cas’ coarse hair against his nose. Sucking hard he slid up, then down again, humming lustily, feeling Cas’ fingers slide over his scalp.
“Oh…” Dean felt gobsmacked. This was so cool. He was making his angel sing!
“Months, man,” Dean answered for him. “Months.”
feel better. He took a few deep, slow breaths, and tried to forget about the goosebumps on his skin in the chill of the room, to forget about the dull headache in his left temple, and the throbbing in his jaw. He tried to concentrate on Cas, and how good it was to still have him close.
“Did it work?” Dean asked breathlessly.
Dean blinked. “Eat one…” Then he burst out laughing, realizing what Jack meant. It seemed to lift the gloom that had settled in the room. “No, man, you… you roll it on your dick for protection. You gotta leave a little space, and… hell, I think there’s a diagram in the box. You take one to your room and practice. Read the directions.”
Dean had seduced and enchanted him so thoroughly and easily without even trying—from the moment Castiel had first seen him in Hell. Over the few short years they’d been together, the angel’s devotion to the “Righteous Man” had only grown exponentially—leading him to forsake his brethren, his Heaven, his life and his God just to be close.
“Listen, I… I know you’re my best friend and maybe this isn’t a great idea—Chuck knows it’s not a great idea—but sometimes I look at you and you’re standing so close to me and I just… I just wanna drag you off to the nearest horizontal surface and get freaky. I just… you do something to me, man. I feel all kinds of ways with you…”
“No, Dean. If I send enough grace through your testicles to kill the tick, I will also render you sterile.”
Dean nodded, smiling a wistful smile that Castiel didn’t quite understand. Until Dean looked pointedly at Jack, then back at him. “You’re a good dad, you know that?”
“Mmm,” Dean hummed, and Castiel could picture his pursed lips, his steely, calculating look off into the far distance. Dean was determining how much to tell him. “So where’re you picturing yourself in the sandwich?” he finally asked, returning a question with a question. “Are you feeling like a slice of bread, or the bologna in the middle? I mean, I guess there are many ways to be the bologna, but…”
“To hell with that!” Jack said, his eyes blazing blue and now
” Sam said with a wink. “Or perhaps you need another swim after that
“Well, duh… you know I ain’t talking about something I can’t see. I don’t mean your grace, dude, or your ‘true form.’ I mean your… your
“You don’t believe me…”
Sam sighed as if all life were leaving him, reaching a long arm down between his legs to drag out Dean’s raggedy box of ancient cassettes.
“It can be our secret. But I refuse to forget. Last night felt… precious to me,” Cas finished softly. Something flickered across his face, and Dean thought he looked sad—just for a moment.
“Give it to me.”
“Uh-huh. Well, that would take some special equipment which I don’t happen to possess. But I s’pose a guy could improvise. Or go shopping.”
“Wait!” Sam cried. “Hold on, Cas!”
Sam yanked the door open and Dean was left blinking dumbly in his seat.
“But he’s not…” came Jack’s voice, before his face emerged from the shadows.
Cas hummed in his throat. “I believe I did. But no one’s going to get cryogenically frozen this time.”
“So you wanna do what Sam and Jack are doing? Learn to float?” Cas turned his head toward their voices, carrying across the water from the other side of the dock.
“Of course,” Castiel answered, turning to Dean with a smile—though inside, he felt a human twinge of anxiety. Questions posed in this way often began an unpleasant conversation.
“That was another joke,” he lied.
“Yes?” He turned around again.
he texted.
Dean sighed. He drained the last of the beer, and reached over to set the bottle on Sam’s dresser. It was gonna leave a ring. He wished he’d brought another one in.
“I’m sorry,” Castiel repeated. Gently and reverently, he cupped Dean’s left buttock in one hand, and sent a soothing wisp of grace into his tailbone and up his spine. Dean stopped shivering and sighed, and Castiel could feel his taut glute release a bit.
“I mean all of it. Porn in general. It’s not real.”
Cas climbed in slowly and lay down on his back with great care, wincing as if he were prostrating himself on a bed of nails.
“What happened?” he heard himself breathe.
Castiel stayed there, against the wall in the corner, taking stock of himself and the situation. He felt good, blood pumping vigorously through his vessel, his penis pleasantly engorged. He loved it when Dean touched him and stood close. He loved seeing Dean’s soul glow at his attentions and feeling the energy along their bond. He still felt Dean’s desire, even through the restroom wall. Dean had not really said no. Everything about this encounter felt like a yes. A little smile tugged at his lips. This
“Like I told Sam, I was raising his heart-rate by stimulating his heart center.”
“Me neither.”
“I’m gay for you, too, Dean,” Cas assured him.
One way—a particular favorite to imagine—involved skillful anal lovemaking, during which Dean would be reduced to a moaning, quivering, orgasming ruin.
Castiel often accompanied Dean to the Suds Bucket. He found he liked this simple chore—sorting the clothing, spraying the stains, operating the machines, then taking the clean clothing out of the dryer and folding it carefully again before putting it back into the baskets. It was a satisfying and peaceful task with a beginning and an end, and it was another way to care for his friends. Touching each article of dirty clothing reminded him of time spent with them, and what they had accomplished or endured or enjoyed on that particular day—whether it was blood from a successful vampire hunt splashed across Sam’s shirt collar, or mustard from a cheeseburger on Dean’s favorite blue jeans.
“Shit… oh, shit…” Sam was hissing through his chattering teeth. With a flick of his wrist, Cas mojo-ed the door shut, but not before the car had lost every iota of heat remaining inside.
“So you, uh… you’re feeling warmer?” Dean butted in.
“Evidence for our next hunt.” Castiel stood up and randomly opened a bureau drawer, pulling out a notebook. He flipped it open—it appeared to be half full of journal entries. It must have belonged to the shifter.
Cas tightened his grip on Dean’s shoulder. “Came back for Jack? Is that what you think?”
Dean sighed, glaring out the front window again. Sam and Cas droned on.
“I’m sure Sam is a fine swimmer,” Cas said tightly.
useless, and I’m not throwing you away.”
Cas writhed beneath him as Dean kissed his mouth, his neck, his chest, feeling Castiel’s hands on him as he dipped lower, sliding down between the angel’s legs, glorying in skin on warm skin.
Cas leaned forward, over the seat, his face close to Dean’s. “Dean, your ears are frostbitten,” he said softly.
“You checking for leeches?” he called.
Dean pulled him back in. “You said you wanted it. I want it. Sam sleeps like a damn rock. Let’s do it.”
“A large diving bird,” Cas chimed in. “Rather prehistoric—one of the few birds with solid bones. That allows them to…”
“What was
Sam yanked open the back door, barely managing to hold it against the gale, and shoved a sleeping bag and a space blanket into the back seat. He was swearing a blue streak, gasping and clumsy, and Cas reached out and caught him by the forearm, dragging all 6’4” of him through the back door and practically into his lap.
“Alright. Dean?”
“How did you do that without killing him?” Sam asked.
He pulled away from Dean and stumbled from the room, away from Sam, from Jack, from the TV paused during a beer commercial. He walked down the hall, through the War Room, up the stairs, his boots ringing on the steps. Dean called to him, following behind, but Castiel couldn’t stop. He was not an angel anymore. He was human. A soulless, graceless human.
“If the car hits the ground, and we don’t get back on the freeway, we’ll be buried in a snowdrift in no time,” Sam observed.
But, oh, it felt so good. Cool and refreshing liquid bliss, slipping over his bare skin. He surfaced slowly and groaned, letting himself float for a moment. Letting all the sweat and gore and residual angst slip away into the water.
Someone finally appeared in the living room window of the house he was watching. A single lamp glowed, and a man came into view, walked to the window and drew the curtains shut. But not before Castiel saw his disfigured, demonic face. At one time, Cas’ grace would have been sensitive enough to detect a demon in the same city. At one time, he would have been powerful enough to fly into the house and smite all the demons into dust with a simple wave of his hand. At one time…
“This good?” Dean mumbled to the back of Castiel’s head.
fault?!” Dean bellowed.
“Ah. Oh… Oh Christ, I’m gonna…”
to the next level. But then Cas had laid his cards on the table…
“Whaddaya doin’?” Sam inquired, squinting bleary-eyed at him.
“You ok, man?” Sam asked a moment later through a mouthful of banana, the delicious aroma of three coffees wafting through the car from the steaming beverage holder in his lap. “Ready to go?”
“Then find a damn radio station.”
“Jack ok?” Dean asked.
Cas could also picture the three bodies writhing together, panting and sweating, Dean wracked with pleasure as the slippery rubber penis penetrated him, hitting just the right spot, while his hard cock…
Like “Angels We Have Heard on High,” Glory Hallelujah singing?”
It almost looked like Sam was going in for a lip-lock, but he must have just butted their foreheads together. “We love you, man. You know that, right?”
Dean tried again, his heart pounding. Why was this scarier than a vampire in a dark alley? “Look, it’s ok to whack off. Everybody does it. But you do it in private. Not you know, like, in front of your dad. Dads.”
“Wait a minute, Dean… hold on…” Sam held a hand out to stay him, gaze toward the water, and Dean recognized the thousand-yard-stare that meant a big idea was incipient.
A cold beer would be perfect right about now, he thought, though he probably ought to down a bottle of water first. He turned to look back into the dark cabin, seeing Sam’s flashlight bobbing his way. “You comin’?”
“Sam… your body temperature is dangerously low,” Cas observed.
“Ready to meet your maker?” Cas read aloud.
Castiel blinked at him, and the look on his face reminded Dean of their night at the brothel—their first “last night of our lives.”
Dean bumped his forehead back against Castiel’s. So close. He could smell the angel’s sweet breath, feel its warmth on his face. He had turned to kneel on the seat, and Cas’ body pressed up against him at the thigh; they were holding each other’s shoulders. Dean let his left hand drop down Castiel’s bicep, kept the fingers of his right hand in his friend’s hair; he knew he should feel awkward about this embrace, but he just couldn’t bring himself to pull away.
“I expelled his grace,” Jack stated matter-of-factly.
Cas watched him listlessly, and when Dean stood and tugged at the lapels of his trench coat next, the angel shrugged slowly out of it—with Dean’s help. Then the suitcoat. Dean laid them both carefully over a chair, and when he’d turned back to the bed, Cas was already pulling his legs up and curling up on his side, face to the wall.
Dean sighed. “Well, worst case scenario… yeah.” He watched Jack open the box and take out one of the foil packets, fingering it thoughtfully.
“Like flying?”
“Jack, are you alright?”
Dean squinted back out the windshield in front of him, into the whirling snow. There were no more tire tracks to follow, no tail-lights ahead of him. Occasionally the howling wind blew fiercely enough to reveal a glimpse of pavement, before the snow quickly covered it up again. At least he was still on the highway and not heading across somebody’s back forty—but that was not going to be a given much longer.
“You’re tired. Would you like to lay your head in my lap and sleep?”
Next thing he knew, he was quaking, gasping, and opened his eyes to see Jack still hovering over him. He blinked up at the boy, confused. He could feel Jack’s hands on his face… he could
They both clambered out, dripping, Dean feeling too exhilarated to be chilled. Cas made to retrieve his clothes, but Dean turned him around and pushed him toward the shore. “Hey!” he called over his shoulder to Sam and Jack, “We’re going for some towels. Be right back!”
“I did feel it. I climaxed already.” He smiled in the dark. “It was very nice.”
Cas nodded and smiled, and Dean smiled back.
Castiel then hovered a finger over the tick without touching Dean. “Come out,” he commanded.
Castiel rubbed his fingers together. “I destroyed it.”
“No!” he cried, his face contorting in terror. “Cas, NO!” Darting forward, he grabbed Castiel’s hand.
Dean sighed heavily, adjusted the machete in its sheath on his hip. “Ok, fine.” He reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a little plastic case. “I’ve got the pick set. Ready?”
“How’re you gonna pick the lock
“Yeah, but I need your help,” he said, jerking his head at the door.
Cas really has been watching too much TV, Dean decided.
“No… you didn’t let me finish. I was going to say… or in the presence of love.”
“Or chicks… well, unless you’re all naked, I guess… or anywhere else you’re not alone. It’s just not cool. Got it?”
“I must, or you’ll become feverish. Let me go now,” Castiel said firmly. Backing away, he took Sam’s arms and brought them down to his sides.
Dean grinned, happy to have pleased his friend. “Hold on now—gonna take my hands away and you’ll be doin’ it all yourself. If your legs start sinking, just kick a little.” He slowly pulled his hands back, like a magician,
Castiel’s eyes widened, his half-hard cock twitching in a way that might have been highly arousing, had he been human.
“I… uh… it wasn’t so…”
Are you purring?”
. We are best friends.”
Dean’s pulse leapt again. “Yeah? You would?”
Dean stared into his friend’s eyes; they always held an odd, faint glow only visible in the dark. Just enough to remind him that Cas wasn’t human. Tonight, though, he seemed more human than ever, his heart pounding beneath Dean’s hand.
Castiel sighed. Dean was always changing the subject when conversations began to evoke emotions. Dean knew by now that Castiel really didn’t care how many looks ladies gave him.
“What sort of equipment?”
What he been thinking? Skinny dipping with Cas? Whose idea had that been?
Castiel pictured the lunchmeat that Sam refused to eat, but that Dean liked in a sandwich with potato chips inside. “I’m not following you,” he butted in.
Cas squinted at the bathroom door, listening to Dean grunt and groan and curse. “What the… c’mon you little bastard... FUCK. Aaaugh,
“Yeah, well…” Dean stood up and walked over to one of the washers, which had ceased its spinning. A light flickered on to signal the cycle’s completion. He yanked the door open, and Castiel stood and pushed a cart over to him. Dean grabbed it with a grunt and started flopping wet clothes into it.
“Ditto.”
Kirk,” Sam replied, grinning. “You’re Uhura.”
Clearing the post, the Impala tobogganed gracefully into the ditch—throwing up a spectacular snow-white explosion—and came softly and gently to rest against a barbed wire fence, its strands illuminated in her headlights.
“For the best, perhaps…”
Dean bellowed in exasperation, snatched the shovels back, and fumbled the trunk open again, his fingers numb inside his leather gloves. Damn it, he hated it when Sam was right, and hated it worse when that meant a course of inaction. Shovels stowed, he turned and wallowed his way back to the driver’s side door. The small trench the Impala now sat in was beginning to fill up already.
“The hell,” he complained, looking over at Sam, who was stomping and shaking himself like the Yeti he was and yanking off his hat and gloves to fling the snow onto the floorboards. “We’re gonna have a lake in here.”
Dean barely registered their clothes coming off, then he was bearing his friend down on his beloved memory foam bed in a tangle of naked arms and legs. They had some unfinished business—a debt Dean needed to pay—and he intended to make good.
for the way that the brave characters Spock and Kirk—different species from different planets—nevertheless shared love and trust and a bond that was unbreakable. And they always triumphed in the end, whether that meant saving one man or an entire universe.
Yeah, ok, dumb idea. Dean sighed.
“You mean the cartoons?”
Cas lowered his hand, and Dean could see that the Impala had sunk a couple feet below the surrounding snowbank.
Sam groaned but knew better than to argue.
“Yes. I hope I wasn’t too vigorous.”
“Because it seemed important to you,” he replied. “I want to know.”
“Any time you want my help, Dean, I’m here.”
And Dean did.
“Dude, I’ll be fine, I can handle big and ugly.”
“No way!” came another agitated yell. “Aaaugh, no… no, no no. Sonofabitch. Goddammit!”
“Dean…”
“We need to get in and out of here fast,” Sam whispered, his face half-hidden in shadow.
Dean spun on him. “You got something you wanna say? Come on—I know you’re dying to say it!”
A moment later, Sam and then Jack appeared in the doorway. “Holy shit!” Sam cried. “What is that?!”
?” Dean snapped.
“Gonna make you feel good—show you how it’s s’posed to be done,” Dean said. Even though he’d never actually
This wasn’t good at all. Jack saved his life, and he remained with the people he loved—but how could he protect them now? He was powerless, and at the time they needed him most. It seemed an even crueler  fate than he’d nearly suffered just moments ago. Instead of falling asleep forever, now he would watch the end of the world helplessly from the sidelines. Win or lose, he would simply be a liability in the fight.
Cas frowned. “I’m concerned, Sam. You need to be warmed right away.”
. Do you think they issued uniforms?”
while bathing wantonly in his presence. As time went on and his allegiance deepened, he often found himself performing submission displays spontaneously around Dean—dropping and quivering his wings in abject adoration. Shameful behavior for a warrior of God, perhaps—but he’d dispensed with feeling embarrassed after the first few incidents. No one had ever noticed. And it pleased him to love Dean so. He even allowed his contentment to bring on song at times; with his family together relaxing in the bunker, he would sit alone to the side, gazing at Dean surreptitiously and vibrating like a purring cat. He was surprised Jack seemed not to hear his soft melodies of love and worship. Or perhaps he did not know what he was hearing, having never been to Heaven. Singing such holy songs to a human amounted to angelic blasphemy, but Castiel was beyond caring.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Awesome.” Dean clapped him on the back, still grinning, butterflies in his stomach, and walked up ahead to unlock the Impala. He couldn't stop grinning all the way home.
“Mmm.”
“Is that bad? Is it… is it wrong? I can’t believe I’m telling you…”
Sam sighed, leaned over the side of the bed and rummaged in his bag until he found his first aid kit, then sat up and handed it to his brother. “Have at it.”
“On my…” Oh shit. “When the hell did you get ahold of my laptop?”
Sam pulled an extreme bitchface.
Jack blinked. “I… I think so…” he said slowly. But he looked confused.
“Yes, it… it’s fine.” Cas took a slow step toward him, then another, let his bare arms float to the surface, looking down at the water beading on his skin.
“Energizing your heart center and raising your heart-rate,” Castiel replied matter-of-factly. “The increase in blood flow to your extremities will warm you.”
“I desire
The water stopped, but Dean’s expletives did not, and Sam turned his head and hollered, “You ok in there?” Castiel noted a small smirk on his face.
“Dean,” Cas was saying. “Dean…”
“Yeah… yeah, that’s what I mean.”
“You’re
“Nothing Dean—I want nothing from you. I just want to help. I know you have needs and desires and I…”
“Where the hell are we?” he barked, fingers tightening even harder on the wheel. “How far to the next exit?”
and then losing it. Now it filled him to bursting, nearly closing his throat, flooding his eyes with tears. “I didn’t tell you I loved you back, buddy. But… but we do, we all do,
They tried for a few moments to suck each other’s lips off, until Dean suddenly heard Jack’s laugh and remembered they weren’t alone. They needed to be alone. He pulled away, struggling for a moment to stand, keeping hold of Cas shoulder. “Hey,” he said, “Let’s go to the cabin.”
“It ain’t pain I’m worried about.” Dean looked around the room, squinted at the curtains—Castiel knew they were closed. “Alright, let’s just do this. Do you want me to…” He looked at the bathroom door, then the bed. “Fuck it.”
Jack nodded proudly. “Yes. I’ve been watching all the sex I can. There are so many movies on your laptop!”
soul?” Dean said.
“Find a goddamn
“Yeah, I think we’ll live.”
Dean slowly closed his mouth as his thoughts finally coalesced again, like a flock of starlings settling back onto a wire. He scratched his head, cleared his throat, tried to ignore the sudden knot in his gut. “Uh, so… Cas and I don’t have sex. It’s not like that. And, yeah... if you take a dude to bed you better use a rubber too, ‘cause you know… diseases. You gotta read up on STDs.”
Dude, did you just Han Solo me?”
The angels had all been warned about it. Millenia ago (in Earth time), Castiel had been warned, too. Humans might call the stories legend at best, gossip at worst, but there were instructive and titillating tales in Heaven oft told of the ones who’d been tempted and become lost. Beguiled. Debauched. Seduced by human souls. Castiel had listened with half an ear, never thinking it would happen to him, yet now here he was: One of those cautionary tales himself.
“Nowhere,” he answered, and it came out more plaintively than he intended. “I’m going nowhere. I…” He turned from Dean, trying to gather himself. “I’m so sorry, Dean,” he moaned. “I know… I know this is bad. I never intended this. It’s not what you need right now.” Dean grabbed his shoulder and spun him around, easily overpowering him. He was forced to look into his friend’s eyes. “I will do everything I can to assist you,” he blurted. “I’ll do anything you ask. I’ll try my hardest. I know it won’t be much, but…”
want any of what Sam just had. He didn’t need to start gushing and pawing at Cas like the drunk girl at the roadhouse. If Cas put that magic heart mojo on him, he had no idea what might come out of his mouth. Or maybe he did… that was even scarier.
“Buddy, I love this… Oh, God… you’re amazing…” Dean babbled, his heart trying to crawl from his mouth.
Night descended, and with it the temperature; the Impala soon grew dark and cold as a tomb inside, buffeted by the northwest wind. Dean fidgeted with everything he could reach, wishing his winter coat were warmer, listening to the wind howl with one ear and to Sam and Cas with the other—discussing the ingredients in the spell they needed to open the portal. They’d been over it a thousand times. They had the blood of a most holy man, and Cas had somehow located a fruit from the Tree of Life. Now they were concentrating on Solomon’s Seal. Was it the actual signet ring of the ancient king that was required? Or perhaps a simple pentagram or Star of David? There was also the flowering plant of the genus
“Never mind.” He waved his hand, took a shaky swig of his beer, then leaned forward, an elbow on his knee. “And never mind what you saw on my laptop. That’s some weird shit—it’s not real.”
you do with the Cartwright twins?”
“Gathering evidence,” Cas called.
cold, the wind cutting through his thin dress shirt. He wrapped his arms around himself, and felt Dean’s hand land on his lower back—just like earlier. But this time, rather than simply being aware of it, he
A moment later, Dean caught up, his hand landing on Cas’ shoulder. Castiel was glad it was dark, so he couldn’t see the disappointment on Dean’s face. So Dean couldn’t see the emotion on his.
“Ugh… ok. Uh. So… weird shit was happening and you were making me say stuff, and I got a little out of control, y’know? So… I… I’m sorry if I took advantage and I don’t want things to be awkward, and I’m hoping we can just forget last night happened. Y’know?”
“While I appreciate you trying to spare me regret, Dean, I do have a mission. It’s important that I do all I can to fulfill it, and that means protecting Jack.”
“This is different. I am not
“I am too…”
Jack didn’t want to talk about STDs. He frowned. “You don’t have sex? But I thought when people love each other like you do…”
“I shouldn’t do this again, Dean. You and Sam need to rest.”
But as soon as the thought formed, it flitted away like a bird. He felt light—easy. Friggin’
“God? Really?” Dean sat up straight; this could only mean one thing. “Cas, is Chuck back??”
you touching my nutsack? It’s on the backside, in my tween, like practically up my ass, and I can’t fucking see it no matter what fucking yoga position I pretzel into on the freezing fucking floor!”
Cas smiled to himself. “Yes, of course.”
Cas smiled wanly, dropping his hand. “You trust my opinion on this?”
Dean pulled him tight and pushed him against the nearest wall, feeling six feet of bare skin pressing back against his. “Right here, buddy,” he murmured.
“Yeah, try to keep the snow outta there—shit’s gonna rust,” Dean interjected.
“No, not really,” Castiel said. “I’m just… drained.
“Another time,” Cas mumbled into the bedclothes.
“Yes. Yin and yang.”
?” Dean demanded.
“It’s what you’ve heard referred to as the Heart Chakra,” Cas continued. “I suppose that besides warming, a side effect of my treatment was that Sam felt his heart open, and experienced feelings of love and gratitude.”
Castiel arched his neck, eyes searching for the moon and finding it, and Dean felt his body rise, buoyed by the lake. “There. Now you’re floating. Just relax.” Dean stood and held him there, hands on his warm skin, barely supporting him. He watched Castiel’s lips part, eyes reflecting the stars, reflecting the moonlight sparkling on the water all around him. He let his own eyes drift down the angel’s body: the rivulets of water trickling off his chest, the dark coins of his nipples, navel just disappearing under the little waves, which rippled over his dick playing peek-a-boo above the surface. Damn. He jerked his eyes back to Castiel’s face, but Cas hadn’t noticed him looking. The angel was too busy stargazing.
Something told him he should be the big spoon tonight… but there was Sam in the next bed, and his pounding head, and… maybe Cas just didn’t want to be touched.
“That’s not even close to accurate,” Castiel observed. Then smiled. “It’s well over 250.”
At least this time, he didn’t think his friends were in danger.
Cas squinted up at the branches overhead. “What if they feel like it every night?”
Cas could see Dean’s scowl even in the dark. “So??” He always had to be contrary.
Castiel detected a note of sarcasm in Dean’s thank you, which was delivered with a glare.
“No. No not at all. I love it. Please continue.”
“Dude—
“Stop it now,” Dean ordered. He inserted himself between Castiel and the sink, and put both hands on Cas’ shoulders. The angel was trembling. “Listen to me.”
Jack regrouped and tried again, but again to no avail.
A post-hunt family skinny dip leads Dean and Cas to dive into the deep end.
“Ok, so…” Dean reached out and placed a hand between Castiel’s shoulder blades, “I’m gonna help hold you up, and you’re just gonna lay back in the water, ok?”
… not
slip in first?”
Cas turned to look at him, eyes wide, then stepped down. He looked a bit surprised to find himself on solid ground. Dean grinned. “There, see? Nice, huh?”
“Hell, why didn’t I think of that?” Dean exclaimed, and stepped up to his friend. “C’mon, can you just touch my nose and make it fall off?”
Dean leaned back in his chair. Goddamn, they grow up so fast. “You’re welcome. Any questions?”
“No, that’s ok, I’m going to grab the blankets and stuff out of the trunk.”
“Yes.”
“Of course, Dean,” Cas croaked, but didn’t move.
Jack met his eyes again, this time with an expression of mild dread. “What’s the other important thing?”
know, it would stand to reason that a larger man generally has a larger penis.”
Cas’ mouth quirked into a tiny smile, his eyes drifting closed again, and he lifted his hands to place them over Dean’s, where they pressed against his body. He let his head tip back a little.
“Oh my God, I can’t… stop Cas…” Sam pleaded. He seemed to be having trouble breathing.
Dean stood up again, holding the towel in front of him, then tossed a grin back over his shoulder. “Consider that payment for services rendered, Doc,” he teased, then disappeared back into the bathroom.
“Sounded like a loon,” Sam answered.
. Telling
Dean’s breathing increased, his eyes finally lifting to Castiel’s. Cas felt he could lose himself there, in their green depths. But he didn’t stop talking.
The phone in Castiel’s pocket vibrated, and he pulled it out to see Dean’s name and number lighting it up. He composed himself quickly, lifting it to his ear to answer. “Dean. There are demons here, but I still don’t have a count.”
Would the best avenue of approach be one of the heart? Or was something more carnal in order? What would Dean find irresistible?
Dean hissed.
Cas turned his head to look at his friend, heavy against his side; soon Dean would be drooling on his shirt. Just days ago, Dean could hardly look at him or speak to him, and now… now he was given this grace, this trust. With Dean’s heart open once again, Castiel could go back to basking in the warmth of his favorite soul. Dean’s love made Castiel’s energy burn so much brighter. Just like… well, just like God used to. Only God had never fallen asleep on Castiel’s shoulder.
, Dean,” he ground out lowly, “just tell me about the equipment.”
“You mean you just… so he…” Dean babbled.
Dean sighed, turned from Cas to fix Sam with a glare. “Ok then. Shovels are in the trunk. Let’s go, Bumble. You too, Hermey,” he tossed back at Cas.
“We decided to take a break here. C’mon.”  Dean offered Cas a hand as Sam pulled their gear from the trunk. To Dean’s surprise, Cas kept ahold of the hand even after Dean hauled him to his feet, and they walked slowly together into the room, while Sam held the door open.
Dean glanced at Cas for the 95
“Oh my God, what are you, my mother? Next you’re gonna tell me your dick is bigger.”
“Ok. Thank you.” Jack looked up at him again. Were those whiskers growing over his lip?
“Yo.” His friend turned his attention back, focusing those green eyes on him, propping his elbows on his knees.
Dean grasped Castiel’s arm and pulled him to his feet, staring at him hard. “How d’you feel?” he asked.
“You got this.” Dean gave him a patronizing smile. “I’ll take the next shift.”
Dean hoped his bitchface wasn’t too severe.
“Dude, c’mon,” Dean urged, and his voice sounded high and strange.
He turned his head and looked over at the angel beside him, curled on top of the bedspread. Castiel’s disheveled white shirt glowed in the dim light, his dark hair tousled against the pillow. Dean rolled to face his friend’s back. How many times had he awakened back in the bunker to find the angel in his bed? Castiel was always the big spoon, nestled fully-clothed and warm against Dean’s back, a protective arm around him, or resting on his shoulder. Sometimes Dean didn’t remember how they got there, but when he did, he always recalled roughly the same thing. Dean would be miserable, well into a bottle of Jack, full of self-loathing and loneliness and longing, when Cas would appear at his bedside. There would be words, sometimes shameful tears, but it always ended the same way. The first time, Dean had simply grabbed Castiel by the arm and pulled the angel down beside him. “I need you,” he’d blurted, then rolled over and dragged the angel’s arm over and around him like a blanket. Castiel not only allowed it, but stayed with Dean most of the night, only leaving after healing Dean’s morning hangover with the gentle press of a finger.
ass.”
“Cas?”
“What…
He let out a whimper, and Castiel let go of one ass cheek to cup his face and bring him in for another hot, wet kiss. “It’s alright, Dean,” the angel soothed. “I know what you need. I can help.”
His reaction caught him quite by surprise, and yet…
“Not happening!” he heard Sam yell from the other side.
needs and desires?”
Still squatting, Dean spun on Castiel. “How the fuck do
Castiel shook his head and sighed at his own vanity. His wings were now tattered, his grace dimmed, and he wasn’t even sure he could assume his true form completely any more. He felt like a mere wisp of his former self at times.
“You’re the best.”
Sam raised his head and glanced over.
Now here he was, inhibitions missing, Cas’ rather magnificent cock filling his fist, in his face, a bead of precum oozing from the tip and glistening in the moonlight from the window.
To Dean, they didn’t have a “thing,” since they weren’t bumping uglies, and isn’t that what a “thing” boils down to? Or maybe they just had a different sort of “thing.” He and Cas were close buds, of course. But there was more to it than that, he had to admit. So why hadn’t they ever messed around? Sure, Cas had guy parts, but that hadn’t generally been a deal-breaker for Dean. And sure, Cas wasn’t really Dean’s “type” when it came down to dudes. But. On nights when he was half drunk and lying under Castiel’s arm, it was sometimes all he could do not to grab Cas’ hand and shove it down his shorts. That was when he told himself he was just drunk and any warm body would do for a loser whoredog like himself. He told himself not to ruin a great friendship by using Cas as just that warm body. He told himself Cas was an angel. He told himself Cas was above that shit and might get pissed. He told himself Cas was off limits, and deserved better. Deep down, he knew it was all bullshit (except maybe the very last part), and if he nutted up, he’d admit that what he really wanted was to have Cas up close and personal in his bed every night. And maybe, once a week or so, banging him senseless, if that wasn’t too much to ask. He suspected that Cas wanted some version of that too.
“I’m sorry,” he said, brow furrowing. “Apparently I can’t.”
had the profound bond with him. He’d never even had to share that with Sam—and he was used to sharing everything with Sam, including toothbrushes and underwear (whether Sam knew it or not). Sharing Castiel with Jack—even if Cas hadn’t changed the way he looked at Dean or came running to help him—just felt wrong.
“Alright,” Jack said without hesitation, and tucked his head down on Castiel’s thigh, curling his thin body into the middle of the sofa and plopping one socked foot into Dean’s lap. He heaved a contented sigh, and Castiel felt that might just be the loveliest sound he’d ever heard. He reached down, smoothing the hair off Jack’s forehead, marveling at its silkiness, and noting the weight and warmth of Jack’s head on his leg. It was so good to have him so close, to give him this tenderness. He stroked the boy’s head a few more times, then rested his hand carefully on Jack’s shoulder, watching as his boy… his son… the most powerful being on the planet… fell asleep in his lap.
Cas thought fleetingly about the future Jack had shown him, and everything he hoped for all of them, despite the terror that likely lay ahead. He lifted his chin and gave the only logical reply.
“Mmm,” Sam purred again. “No one’s ever called me wonderful… This feels pretty wonderful… This… you should bottle this…”
Jack scowled, clutching the box. “I would never knock a girl…”
!” Dean yelled back. A second later the door opened and Dean stepped into the room, hair dripping and a towel around his waist. Steam rolled out behind him. “I have a tick,” he declared.
Dean scowled, pulling his hand back. “Why not? Thought you were feeling this.”
Dean finally pulled away, his curiosity overcoming his lust momentarily. “Cas… is that
“Why?” Dean watched Cas pause the movie, then slowly get to his feet and follow Sam out the door, and couldn’t help but smile at his confusion.
—you think I’m asking ‘cause I
“No. I mean, I’m a little freaked out, but I’m fine…”
“DSB?”
“That’s too bad. I think my cock is the perfect size for your lovely ass. I think it would fit just right and stroke you in all the right places.”
It occurred to him with a sinking feeling that he’d offered several days ago on a hunt to have The Talk with Jack, but hadn’t followed through yet. He’d done it with Ben (though Lisa had already given the kid her own version), and he’d also done it with Sam, because God knew it hadn’t been the first thing on John’s mind. So maybe he qualified as an old pro at this—but that didn’t make it any easier. Why the hell did it have to be him
Cas ran a hand down Dean’s arm. “That’s not all, Dean. I think we’re syncing…”
Jack was here, Sam was here, Dean had welcomed him back—they were a Family again—and perhaps, with Billie on their side, they even had a chance to win this fight. They had hope, and they had love. It was all he could have wished for, and he was… happy.
Cas was trembling, for God’s sake, and his shorts and Dean’s sweatpants didn’t prove much of a barrier to
The space blanket wasn’t helping much, and it was taking all Dean had to keep his teeth from chattering as his muscles convulsed and his body shook. But despite the cold and his earlier joking, he didn’t
“Uh…” Dean was taken aback. Dude kinda had a point. Shit.
“Yeah,” Dean replied. “OK. For a bit.”
Perching on the edge of the seat, Cas closed his eyes; Dean held his breath. Cas opened his eyes.
Dean released him, his heart plummeting. “Go? You mean leave? Dude, I just meant…” He slumped back against the sink, ran a shaky hand through his hair.
Humans can be surprisingly alluring, Bethezriel had said to him, as they watched several young human slaves bathing in a river together one day. “Their souls are a piece of God—whom we all long to see. So bright, so beautiful. And sometimes, that soul combines with the body in such a way as to be very enticing. You want to take a vessel, to get closer, to experience matter in the way they do. But once you have a taste of human pleasures, you are likely to forget who and what you really are. You will forsake your mission, your garrison, your God… and for what?”
“If we don’t freeze. We’re gonna have to take turns clearing the tailpipe so you can run the…”
“My God,” Dean moaned, and giving in to his baser impulses as well, flexed his hips and ground his erect penis against Castiel’s hipbone. Castiel gasped, his head bumping against the bulletin board behind him, and Dean leaned in, pressing his lips to Cas’ ear. “Buddy, it’s all I can do not to drop and suck your dick right here and now, and that ain’t good.”
“Gotcha.” Sam knew better than to argue tonight.
!” Dean snapped. “Gimme some Zeppelin.”
soul!”
“You still in pain, Cas?” Sam asked, pulling out his medical kit. “Is there anything we can do?”
But he couldn’t NOT go there.
Up on his knees, awkwardly bent over Castiel’s head and staring at his snoring brother in the back seat, Dean came quickly undone. Cas was jerking him with one hand, clasping his ass cheek with the other, and he knew he should worry about Sam waking up—he couldn’t stop whimpering, and the wet sound of Castiel’s hand milking him seemed obscenely loud—but he really couldn’t give a shit.
“Hey, Cas, you’re in luck! Another
“I think not,” Cas replied. “I want to keep an eye on things.”
“Tired,” Dean lied, sliding down under the covers next to Cas and trying to get comfortable.
Cas said something low and stern, but Jack replied, “No, I want to!”
Instead he threw the car into reverse and punched the accelerator—then quickly realized that the wheels were not touching the ground.
“You feel better now, yes? Perhaps you should get some rest.”
“Stop… just…” Dean grabbed him by the back of the skull and their foreheads met with a thunk. His other hand clutched Castiel’s coat. “Just stop. Dude we can’t. We’re friends… like brothers. This shit changes everything.”
“But you DO know? You’ve seen the fucking fire hose itself?”
“You mean you
“No! No, it’s not his fault, it’s mine. Just mine…”
Dean tried, but it was a challenge between the chattering and the shivering. He drew a deep gasp when it hit him hard—that icy cold, spreading like liquid nitrogen in his veins for a split second. Then there was warmth. Just a tiny bit, at first. It radiated from Castiel’s hand, into his chest, and his heart began to beat a little faster. Like he was jogging easily. He lifted a hand to the angel’s arm. He breathed out. Let his eyes flutter closed.
Dean was looking mightily perturbed now. “Would you two get your shit together? For fuck’s sake. Some of us are show-ers and some are growers, ok?”
Cas squinted at him, chin lifted. “I can try.”
“Shut-up,” Sam croaked.
Sam ignored this. “You want to learn to swim?” he asked Jack, who nodded and grinned in reply, wiping at his face with one hand and holding to the dock with the other. “OK, let’s work on floating first.”
He stepped up to Cas and took the angel in his arms, kissing him deeply—and feeling him respond in kind. Cas seemed to melt against him, soon warm and willing, and it was only a few moments until Dean could feel it begin. Cas was purring.
Sam snickered a little. “Seriously, Dean?”
, he was almost there and Cas was thrusting into his mouth, his rhythm breaking, and suddenly the angel cried out, jamming his cock into Dean’s soft palate. Of course Dean gagged, pulling his head back and feeling semen splash across his cheek. Groaning, he managed to open his mouth to catch the last couple spurts while Cas whimpered around his dick, hot breath panting on his balls, and then Dean was coming too, sending his load down Cas’ throat.
The angel did seem calmer, but Dean didn’t like the idea of leaving him alone in the bathroom again. “I’m going back to bed, and you’re coming with me,” Dean told him. He gestured to the floor. “Just… you know… put your shorts back on and come on.”
“Yeah? Cool.” He smiled at Cas in the dark, despite his aching jaw, and the angel smiled back, half his face obscured by the pillow.
The angel sat up straighter. He needed to focus on the task at hand, and NOT on figuring out a way to encourage Dean to overcome his inhibitions. When Dean clearly longed to be physically and emotionally intimate with Castiel, why couldn’t they seem to make it happen? He was growing tired of waiting—wasn’t there something he could do to get past Dean’s fear of loving and losing? Of vulnerability? Given a chance, he knew he could please his friend in every way possible, and he so wanted to try. Before it was too late for them both.
Suddenly, the light went on.
showering, dumbass. Cas is, uh…”
“Dean… dean…”
? What’s come for you?” Dean repeated, eyes blazing. “Cas, talk to me!”
“How would you know? I’m an angel, Dean, not a human.”
They turned toward the Dean-Cave, as Dean called it, and his friend laid a hand on his back momentarily, a gentle gesture that felt like a small gift. They shared a side-eye glance.
“I’m trying to heal myself,” Cas answered. “I… I don’t feel right.”
“Dude, you know you love this.” Dean pressed play, and the action commenced.
“Cas…” he murmured from the doorway, “You ok?”
“Don’t you have a hat, Dean?”
Sam straightened up, wiping tears from his eyes, still grinning. “Ah, thanks for that, buddy.”
“Nothin’ I couldn’t handle.” He chuckled at himself, took a swipe at his sticky cheek. “Tell me why we didn’t do this a long time ago.”
“Good enuf…” Dean mumbled.
ok!” Dean ran frantically into the hall and started hollering. “Sam! Jack! Saaaam!”
“Jesus, fine,” he said, shoving the case toward Sam. “But I’m going in first.”
Jack turned to Dean. “Are they going to bake cookies?” he asked brightly. A few of the wacky-world survivors staying at the bunker had apparently been making full use of the kitchen lately, much to Jack’s (and everyone else’s) delight.
Castiel’s brows knit together.
Dean threw Sam a stinkeye. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
"Jack said you said that you and I would be having sex if it wasn’t so complicated..."
sitting
“I’m not comfortable with that.”
Twenty minutes went by, with Dean watching the Impala’s gas gauge drop below ¼ tank as the car idled. The old girl’s heater was no match for the wind and cold outside, which seeped through every seam and rivet. Pretty soon Dean couldn’t speak without stuttering and slurring, and he could feel Cas’ annoyance at his recalcitrance. He hunched down farther in the seat, wrapping his arms tighter around his quaking body. Cas had offered twice to warm him, and twice he’d said
“How many angels does it take to remove a tick from a human’s nut sack?” Castiel asked.
“OK. Sam just reported something similar. I’m not seeing anything here yet.”
Cas closed his eyes and sighed, let his hands drop to his sides.
“Well… everyone does, I assume.”
“Live long and prosper, my friend,” Dean whispered.
“It’s alright. Don’t speak. Just breathe.”
Dean blinked. “You did?”
Dean patted the couch cushion close beside him, and Cas handed Dean the bowl of popcorn and a beer, then removed his trench coat and suit jacket, draping them over a chair—because he knew it bothered Dean when he was “overdressed” on the sofa. He took a seat where Dean had indicated, and Dean put the popcorn back into his lap.
Castiel turned to see the boy, with Sam close behind. “I’m not?”
“Cause I want to suck your dick without Abbott and Costello watching, that’s why,” he blurted, and grabbing Castiel’s arm, he began swimming toward the ladder.
Sam snorted. “He poke you?”
“I know.” Castiel’s eyes sparkled, and Dean pulled back to see the corner of his mouth quirking up in a little smile.
“I’m fine,” Jack croaked, and tugged against Castiel’s grip. “Will you please let go of me?”
“Thank you.”
“Yeah, dude, whatever. Maybe Jack hasn’t seen it for the hundredth time yet.”
Castiel reached up absently and touched his face—the face of his vessel, which, yes, he had come to own. It was feeling more and more like part of him, rather than just a shirt, like the ones spinning in the washers—or a burden. Or a trap that he could no longer escape from. “Is it so noticeable?” he asked.
“Yeah, he… he was stimulated all right.”
Cas heaved a human-sounding sigh, and Dean looked up to see that the endless love scene had finally evaporated. Jack appeared to be in pain. If he didn’t do this now, while he had a couple beers in him…
While human, he had dreamed of something akin to this sight. Dean bared to him, touching him, inviting him to his bed and his body. During long, lonely nights on the hard floor of the Gas n’ Sip storage room, he often soothed himself with imaginings of Dean welcoming him back to the bunker with open arms—and legs. He knew it was foolish to indulge in such carnal lust, but still, the time passed more quickly with his hand in his shorts and Dean’s name on his lips. When he got his grace back, the aching fantasies were replaced once again by a desire to please and to serve; only this time, he’d tasted human pleasure, and he knew that there were many ways he’d like to please Dean and serve him.
“My grace is singing, Dean. It’s not like human singing, exactly. It’s… involuntary. It happens in the presence of God…”
“What the fuck is
Dean could feel a little fish begin pulling at his leg hair—at least he hoped it was a little fish—but he didn’t dare move. Cas seemed enthralled, and Dean couldn’t stop watching him.
“Yeah?” Dean lifted a hand to pinch the tip of his ear, and couldn’t feel it.
“I love you.” There. He said it. And it felt… fucking good.
“Yeah,” Sam sighed. “Thanks, Cas.”
“Fuck, would you look at this,” he murmured, taking Cas’ stiff cock in hand. “So fuckin’ gorgeous.”
“It’s really cold in here, Dean,” Captain Obvious pointed out. “We need to run the heater.” Sam craned his neck to look out the rear window. “Wind’s blowing right up our ass, and it looks like we’re drifted in. I’ll go clean off.”
With a growl, Dean took the bag back into the bathroom and pulled the door shut.
“Mmm, yeah, time fer bed,” Dean mumbled. But instead of getting up, he relaxed into Castiel’s body, slumping into sleep.
dick—but he knew enough to know that you didn’t play with it on the bus. He couldn’t even remember what he’d said to his brother, but he’d definitely said
Dean thumbed Cas’ nipple, leaned in to kiss along his jawline, as Castiel then unfastened Dean’s belt buckle, unsnapped his jeans. Dean rose to his knees, allowing Cas to unzip his fly and tug the denim open and down, then carefully free his cock.
So he applied himself once again to making Cas come—caressing his balls, suckling him lavishly, squeezing his ass, stroking his thighs. It was harder to concentrate with his own dick in Cas’ mouth now, the angel sucking and lapping and exploring him with relish. Worshipping his cock. The world began to shrink to nothing but warm, sucking mouths and slick hands and straining dicks, and now he was moaning every time he hit the back of Cas throat—did the guy have no gag reflex?—and he knew he was going to cum again and soon.
“That was a joke, Dean.”
Castiel nodded, waiting.
He smiled a little. “As close as I can come anymore.”
“Oh God yes…” Dean moaned.
“Crowley broke the lance—you’re healed now.”
He shook his head. He hoped to God Sam had really slept through it all. Then there was the dream, which he couldn’t stop thinking about from the time he bolted upright from Castiel’s lap. He really didn’t know how to feel about the fact that he had enjoyed playing the skin flute quite so much—even if just in his dreams. So much that he kept replaying the lurid scene in his head. So much that his hard-on was still persisting, 10 miles later.
Cas made a skeptical noise, smiling wanly. He dropped his hand from Dean’s face and patted the seat beside him. “Rest now, Dean. Lay your head on my lap if you like.”
“Suckle me some more. And I will suck your dick at the same time. I think that will do it.”
“Dude, this ain’t our first rodeo,” Dean interrupted. “Don’t you remember that night outside Chicago after the vampire twins? Or that werewolf hunt with Dad in Montana? Stuck on some logging road in the snow for two days?”
While Dean had to grudgingly admit that the kid had grown on him, he was impatient with Cas’ fixation on the boy.
“Of course I am—my clothes are on the dock. Here’s what I found,” Cas said matter-of-factly.
“I watched two men in a courtyard once, late at night, bathing each other in a fountain. They touched each other so passionately, yet so reverently—I felt they’d waited a long time to be together. One man dropped to his knees and took the other’s wet penis into his mouth. It seemed to give them both such pleasure.”
Dean couldn’t deny he was indeed shivering pretty hard. The heater just wasn’t cutting it, and he had no way to really get his blood flowing; he sure as hell wasn’t going to get out and do jumping jacks on the freeway.
He did have to piss like a racehorse, after all, and if he could only get out of the car, maybe his extra-woody morning hard-on would finally subside.
“A strap-on dick. So you had two penises and could have sex with both girls at once? But…”
“Boulders,” Sam yelled back. “Not seeing any.”
Dean wondered helplessly what shade of crimson his face had become. Were they really going there? He stared down at the beer bottle in his hands, not seeing it. “Yeah, we… we love each other. He’s my best friend, see? Like a brother.” He forced himself to look up at Jack again, set the bottle back down. “But you don’t have sex with your best friend or your brother.”
When he awoke sometime in the wee hours, he thought the light flashing across his eyelids was coming from Sam’s laptop. He blinked, preparing to gripe at his brother, but Sam was lying asleep in the next bed. The light was streaming from the bathroom, and it was NOT the glow of the bathroom fixture. He turned his head to see that Cas was no longer in the bed, and frowned. Something felt amiss. The room was fucking freezing. He found himself padding quickly across the rough carpeting, around the beds, turning down the A/C and stopping short at the bathroom door. It stood open a few inches, and inside he could see Castiel standing in front of the large mirror there, running his hands over his torso. His clothes lay in a heap on the floor.
Sam and Dean appeared on either side of him squinting and blinking like they’d just been blinded. “Cas!” Dean cried. “How are you
?” He turned to Jack. “What did you
The angel smiled gently. How much to say, without making Dean uncomfortable? “I don’t need to get old, certainly,” he replied. “For a few years, I allowed my grace to keep renewing my vessel. But now that Jack is with us…” Dean’s eyes were distracting, gazing at him so earnestly. “Now that we’re a family…”
For a moment or two, nobody moved. Sam let out a soft whimper… followed by a long, low moan. Dean stared curiously, but knew exactly what was going on. If anything could make a grown man moan like a little bitch, it was angel grace…
“I.... uh… I don’t think we have time right now, but…”
“Jesus, my face…” Sam groaned.
Jack was always a little too perceptive. “Even if you both want to?”
Dean felt like an ass all over again. But…
Dean gestured at his midsection. “‘Knocked up’ means pregnant. You’ll get a girl pregnant. You do that and there’s gonna be problems.”
Jack pushed his way past Sam’s towering form into the room.
“And you love that don’t you? You want to be boss-man tonight, go ahead. We’ll do it your way. You win—you have the biggest dick.
“For fuck’s sake, Cas—a strap-on
“I’m going to help you,” Cas said. Then, as Dean watched, the angel crowded Sam back against the seat, wrapping one arm around him as if they were about to make out—and laying the other hand against Sam’s chest. “Be still,” he instructed.
“No, I’m not
They settled into the hotel room in the usual way, Sam peeling off his shoes and climbing onto the bed with his laptop while Dean grabbed his Dopp kit and headed into the bathroom. A moment later, the sound of the shower added to the background noise of traffic passing on the nearby highway. Castiel perched in a stiff-backed chair at the small table by the window, watching Sam’s face in the glow from the laptop screen.
“So last night, did we, uh… did you really…” words failed him, and Dean made a loose gesture at his crotch, blushing furiously even as he did so.
Castiel stood up, ready to assist.
Castiel gasped, reaching out to Jack, and seeing that his fingers were also beginning to blacken and dissolve. “Jack… Dean…Sam…” he groaned. He turned his gaze on his best friend. “I’m sorry. I love you so much. I only wish…”
“Was that a joke too?” Dean murmured.
“I wanted to,” Dean moaned.
“Dean,” Cas murmured, “it’s alright. You didn’t have to say it.”
“Sam… yes…”
Castiel sighed. “Yes.”
Jack lifted his chin defiantly. “I can’t help but feel it.”
Castiel obeyed. “Like this?”
“How ‘bout just regular old-school frozen?” Dean said, sniffling and wiping his eyes.
It took on Jack’s own form, pausing in its consumption of Castiel and rising up to meet the boy.
“It’s ok, Dean… it will be alright,” he tried to soothe. “It’s not after any of you—just me. Just… stay back. It’s ok.”
“Gonna stop for the night,” Dean replied without looking at his brother, his jaw set. “I think we all just need to chill.”
time? Why couldn’t Sam take a stab at it?
“You’re what I really want.”
“He good?” Dean asked as Cas settled and turned to look at him. The heat from the vents was starting to feel lukewarm.
“You would have to have quite a backup for it to become lethal,” Cas mused.
“That’s quite alright—I have seen many human asses in my day. Yours is one of the more enjoyable ones to look at. It’s particularly muscular and well formed.”
“It’s been done before.”
“Well I was going to give you a piece of mine, if that’s what it took—but it didn’t.”
“Means what?” he murmured.
“I thought you’d never ask. Turn off the engine and come here,” Cas beckoned, and Dean turned the key, then slid into the middle of the seat, finding himself both eager and nervous as hell. With the engine stilled, all he could hear once again was the wind buffeting his baby. Castiel turned to face him, his knee pressing against Dean’s thigh, and suddenly Dean found himself in the angel’s arms. Cas had one hand on his shoulder, and with the other, he was unzipping Dean’s parka.
you do,” Dean chuckled. “Damn, I gotta lube that hinge.”
“Awesome.”
“You, uh… you thinking about shagging dudes, too?”
Setting hooks into him, like a fisherman after his quarry.
“Y… you suggestin’ I’m stubborn?”
Sam had pointed out that he would not be surprised if someone had already called in a suspicious car parked on the street, or spotted the three men who had skirted a golf course through the woods, then hopped a few fences through dark yards to get to their target.
Dean chuckled low in his throat, grinning. “Then they better get a set of spare sheets and a lock for the bedroom door.”
“Synchronizing,” Cas explained. “Syncing our vibrations. I’ve raised yours by stimulating your heart center, and mine seems to have lowered to the point where you can feel it. “That means…” Cas leaned forward and closed the space between them, and Dean’s awareness shifted again as the angel’s lips touched his gently.
“Cool!” Dean yelled.
There was a time, Dean thought, when all this might have felt threatening to his manhood. Way too touchy-feely. Too chick flick. Dean sighed, closing his eyes again.
Dean ran a hand through his hair. He wished he could just say “Keep it in your pants,” like John had to him, but he knew how well that had worked.
“I’m not good at this, man. Intimacy. If we fall into bed, it’s gonna be something more than I’m used to. I can’t just walk away in the morning.”
He treasured it more than life.
After Ramiel's lance nearly kills him, Castiel needs a little human touch to recover.
“So you, uh… you know how it works? I mean, you know, the mechanics?”
Dean avoided looking to his right. “Yeah, ok, thanks,” he mumbled. He knew he was proving Castiel right, but he just couldn’t look at his friend in the morning light; both out of shame and confusion over last night’s activities—and because Cas had left his goddamn shirt unbuttoned at the top, and his tie was crooked as hell, and that was kinda…
Dean felt the urge to be indignant, but instead barked out a laugh. “Listen, just… just shut-up a minute. Here…”
, dude,” Dean finally growled, an edge of irritation to his voice. “There were strap-ons involved. Or one strap-on anyway, OK? Not something I’d recommend for your first time, though… we’re talking next-level, y’know?”
“We don’t have much time, buddy,” Dean sighed, gazing up at him. “What’m I gonna do with you?”
“Castiel made a
“I think I know what’s going on,” he ventured. “Last time you got in the water it wasn’t much fun.”
He felt an odd sensation at his human feet. A coldness, as if they’d fallen asleep. It was something he hadn’t felt since being human. He frowned—he couldn’t lift his feet to see them; they seemed to be nailed to the floor. He widened his awareness, and realized that something was now reaching into his grace, too. Infiltrating his energy.
? Dude, what’s happening?! Shit, am I dreaming?”
“NOW you get it,” Dean said, and Cas could picture his leer. “Yeah. Next level.”
Dean glanced up at him as he flung wet clothes into the dryer. “Deadly Sperm Backup. I forget sometimes you never went to high school.” He slammed the dryer shut and held out his hand, and Castiel counted five quarters into it, which Dean slipped into the machine. He pressed the button to start it.
“Yes,” Castiel replied. “Yes, I’m fine.” But Cas was climbing out of the bed and heading for the bathroom.
Sam gestured at Cas. “Cas, can’t you, like, mojo it off him?”
“Together?” yelled Sam.
Jack had gone back out the door, and now elbowed his way in again with an armload of clothing. “We brought your clothes up, though Sam said you might not want them yet.”
“This is
“I need to concentrate, Sam…”
“I suppose I have to.”
“Alright then,” Castiel answered, unfolding himself from the end of the bed and standing up. He bent over the boy, fussing a bit with the blanket, not wanting to leave yet. Not quite ready to let Jack out of his sight.
“What? Wait, hold on… don’t stop yet…”
They relaxed together in comfortable silence, then, watching the familiar faces on the television. Sam pulled the old plaid blanket over his chest and soon began to snore softly. Castiel gazed a long time at Dean’s sleepy face in profile, at the crow’s feet around his eyes that crinkled when he smiled. At the tousled hair that he’d just recently pressed his lips into—the way it caught the light and glowed a dark auburn . The two days’ growth of beard stubble that might be soft or scratchy. He’d like to find out. The plump, pouting mouth that might feel wet and warm against his own, the way April’s mouth had. He
Walking the mile back to the car in his sweaty clothes, Sam and Jack strolling in front of him and Cas bringing up the rear, Dean had some time to think. What was he going to do now? It seemed this was a turning point in his relationship with Cas. Was he going to try to deny this happened and reel his feelings back in—and possibly hurt Castiel’s? Was he going to jump in with both feet, and drag Cas into his bed at the bunker tomorrow night? Or was he going to relax and see where this went next, and just take it day by day?
Sam opened the text, frowned momentarily, and finally looked up. He glanced at the bed, and Dean realized that Cas was probably blocking Sam’s view of the action. Sam looked back at Dean, quirking a brow and giving a little toss of the head. Clearly he couldn’t see what was happening.
” Dean’s mouth dropped open, his moist lips parting as he stared hard at Castiel.
Hope you liked! Leave me some love.
Downright lovey-dovey.
Next thing Dean knew, Cas was all boots, ass and elbows over the back of the seat, scrambling ungracefully into the front with him.
What the hell?
Dean nursed the Impala up to the first pump and Sam bailed out before he’d rolled to a stop. “Got breakfast,” he tossed over his shoulder as he slammed the door—not before a blast of icy air filled the car again. Dean growled, watching Sam jog into the truck stop. The sun was just peeking above the horizon, and white clouds of exhaust billowed from the fleet of semis parked nearby, rumbling in the frigid dawn as their drivers loaded up on coffee and crullers.
The angel was
Cas looked chagrined, resisting. “Can’t I get dressed before I go?”
A moment later he was panting, aching face hot against Castiel’s inner thigh, fingers dripping jism. Cas was tugging at his hair, and he looked up. “Yer killin’ me, Smalls,” he groaned. “How’d I come and you didn’t?”
“Dude… no.”
“Wow,” Sam said.
He glared over at Sam, willing him to look up, but The Sasquatch was escaping in his usual fashion. Dean set his beer down on the desk, grabbed his own phone from his back pocket, and texted his brother.
“What? Jesus… never mind… dude… oh God… you gotta stop that…”
“Hell, yeah,” Dean exclaimed through popcorn. “Wouldn’t you have?”
Cas blinked at him, stunned. “Why?”
“About thirty more miles,” Sam said.
The wooden dock shook with every step the Sasquatch took out to the end; Dean watched Sam stop and lean well over, peering into the water, moonlight reflected on the riffly surface.
Hustling into the truck stop before his face could freeze, he knew he couldn’t just leave this thing dangling; that would make him crazy. Maybe he could grab a minute to talk with Cas. What the hell had happened last night? Did Cas really jerk him off? Did he really say the “L” word—and all that other sappy stuff?
“He’s fine,” Sam laughed. “But I should have reminded him to hold his breath, I think.”
Cas nodded. “I understand.” He certainly did.
“Why don’t you go back to bed now, Dean. I’ll be alright.”
Sam just shook his head, waking up his laptop again. “Maybe it’s on his balls.”
“Hey,” Dean called to him. Cas didn’t answer, didn’t even look at him. “Cas…” Dean swam up to the dock, gazing up at the angel. Castiel’s fists were clenched, his jaw taut; he seemed to vibrate with tension. “You know they’re fine—Sam’s got him. Sam was the friggin’ captain of the swim team freshman year.”
Dean blinked. Yup, the kid was masturbating. Right there in Sam’s bed in front of God and Creation and all of them. He averted his eyes, gave a little cough and took a drag on his beer, feeling heat crawl up his neck, even as the cold brew slid down.
“Listen, if you think Jack brought you back to help prepare for war, maybe you need to help Jack prepare to kick some ass!”
good. Like sliding into a hot bath good. Like standing next to a roaring woodstove on a cold day. He could finally breathe again. In and out smoothly.
“Cas, didn’t you say Jack showed you paradise?” Sam asked. “Peace on Earth? What do you think that meant? Was it the… the post-Michael vs. Lucifer smackdown paradise all over again, or something else? And Jack has so much raw power—could
Jack turned to look at him in awe. “Really?” And it must have been Castiel’s human grin that made his face light up, too, his eyes twinkling. “You’re joking.”
“If you’ll find it calming.”
“Gonna die of DSB before I die bloody, at this rate.”
Castiel froze, the room plunging into darkness again. “Yes,” he muttered. “Sorry to wake you.”
“What it is I’ve been watching?” Cas echoed. “I’ve been watching people have sex. Men and women, men and men, men and boys, men and animals, women and women. Not that I set out to do that, or that I had a special interest. But as long as humans and human ancestors have been copulating outdoors, I’ve been watching.”
Dean stared down the hall at nothing, rubbed his arms as if he were cold. Castiel reached out impulsively to lay a hand on Dean’s shoulder.
Dean laughed. “We may find out.”
“Oh, man…” Sam groaned, “that feels
Castiel’s eyes narrowed. “You’ll remember every word.” He resumed trying to get at Dean’s chest. “And don’t worry—what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.”
“Dean, wake up!”
“It wasn’t for lack of trying,” Castiel observed. “It must have been neglected for many years. Perhaps the plots were never well-marked to begin with.”
His mouth twitched. “There are… phantom pains.”
and Castiel stayed floating before him. Still smiling, Cas closed his eyes. Dean suddenly missed the feel of his skin, the connection. He was surprised at how badly he wanted to touch the angel again. But he didn’t dare disturb him—he seemed to be having a moment.
“Just this,” Cas replied, his fingers moving over the back of Dean’s hand, where it lay against his breast. “This is enough.”
“So I should just as well be dead, rather than a millstone around your necks.”
“You’re welcome,” Jack said cordially.
. The second time they’d watched the TV show, Castiel had observed out loud that he found Spock’s character admirable. “I like this Mr. Spock,” he’d said.
Cas thought up a lie and he thought it up quick. “Yes, Dean. I met some girls recently. Twins. One of them texted me tonight.”
A couple more minutes of heavy breathing and sighing on Sam’s part, then Castiel tried to pull away gently. “I should stop now, Sam.”
“Can I get some?” Dean blurted, instantly feeling silly—and, he realized, a little jealous. What the hell?
time in his rearview mirror. The angel looked so pale in the light of a passing streetlamp, his eyes still closed.
“I want to know what you did with the Cartwright twins that was so special. Maybe I could try that.”
Cas made a surprised noise, and used the hand on Dean’s chest to push him away an inch or two. “Dean, no… we shouldn’t do this…”
Cas took a breath, and let Dean slowly lower him into the water.
Dean sighed. He supposed he was done freezing to death; if he’d been trying to prove something, he’d now forgotten what it was. “So, you jus’ gonna sit there an’ be snarky, or you gonna warm me up now?”
“Yes… Cas, yes…” Those gentle, strong fingers wrapped around his dick, thumb smearing pre-come leaking from the head, and began to stroke.
“Yeah? Oh God… I just… I’m so gay for you right now…”
“Yeah,” Dean said automatically, still gazing at Cas, his hands going through the motions as he started the car. Somehow, it felt as though his life were shifting tectonically. “I’m ready.”
“I think I’d like to sleep now, Castiel,” Jack said, finally sliding down under the covers on his bed. He smiled softly. “Goodnight.”
“We can
Cas barked, finally turning to him.
“I mean how do you want it to go? Cause you have the classic porn threesome moves, like one sits on your face and the other on your dick—which, gotta say, it’s a classic for good reason. Or the double-team blow job. Also a classic. Or you could just do one chick at a time while the other watches. If you’re talking sisters, you probably aren’t going to see any girl-on-girl—but the upside is that it’s all about
“Yeah, we’re… uh… we’re showering!” Dean called. “Goddammit,” he grumbled to Cas, sitting up. “Fun police are here.”
Despite the rattling air conditioner and his whirling mind, Dean finally dozed off.
They all stood outside Dean’s room and waited while Castiel dragged on a pair of Dean’s sweatpants and an old flannel shirt, and when he came out, Dean reached out to him and straightened the collar, then turned the unbuttoned cuffs up one at a time. “There,” he said. “Comfy?”
“You got eyes on her?”
Dean pulled away angrily. “You more comfortable looking up my ass and pulling it off with tweezers? Cause I’m not exactly comfortable with
Normally, Cas would have healed him by now… but Cas had nearly died tonight. Again. Dean stared at the TV, but he wasn’t seeing the flickering images there; he was seeing Castiel sprawled on the ruined couch in that barn, bleeding and suffering, and frightened for
unpacking that. So Jack said I said…”
“So I just eat one before the sex?” Jack asked.
He stood as if possessed and walked closer. He couldn’t just let this drop. He couldn’t. He was standing directly behind Dean when his friend stood and turned around, running straight into him. Dean let out a startled “oof!” and Castiel grabbed him by the arms.
Dean stepped out onto the porch and into the night, letting the screen door slam behind him. Goddamn, but it was hot. A gentle breeze off the lake rustled the pines overhead and cooled his forehead a degree or two—just enough to make him realize just how sweaty he was. As in soaked.
“What the fuck are you talking about?”
“I’m talkin’ about
“Dean, I would…”
“No, he already felt the shit,” Cas replied. “He just experienced the feelings more intensely. And you know how he likes to talk about feelings.”
, dumbass, can you make the tick fall off?”
That felt good. Very good. “Am I?”
“I love you. Thank you for believing in me.”
It was Dean’s turn to sigh, and he grew quiet for a moment—long enough for Castiel to wonder if he’d pushed too hard. Was he being too dogged?
Jack didn’t have to be asked twice; the two of them took off, loping and hopping back downhill toward the water, ducking tree branches in the darkness. Now that there was no one left to argue with, Dean knew he could either fall in line, or go sit in the car and pout—probably alone. The car was a mile down the road; the beer would just have to wait a bit. And nibbly fish and snapping turtles notwithstanding, a swim would probably feel pretty damn good.
“If I couldn’t detect anything for you, I’m not sure what that would…”
“Oh, Dean,” Cas breathed. “Oh this is… so soothing.”
“We’re gonna try,” Dean answered, having to turn his face away from the frigid wind. He grabbed a shovel back from Cas and set to digging ferociously behind the left rear tire. It was worse than gravedigging in sand; as fast as he dug the hole, the wind filled it back in.
. Set alight, it suddenly became a flaming tornado, scorching him from within, and he cried out sharply, startling Dean from sleep.
“Fine. My grace is keeping me warm.” Cas smiled softly in the dark.
Dean cleared his throat.
Castiel blinked. There was the tick, attached at the point where Dean’s scrotum joined his body. And there was Dean naked, back arched and perfect pink buttocks presented to him like an offering. Something in Castiel’s vessel responded very immediately and viscerally; something in Castiel’s true essence was likewise arrested by the spectacle before him.
Cas’ mojo was not what it should be—as usual. It had only been a couple weeks since the angel had been released from a month-long stay in Hell’s dungeon (Dean still felt like the worst friend ever…), and only a couple months since he’d been
Dean couldn’t look away. Why was he being a jerk about this? Did he really want to forget the way it felt to make his angel sing?
“So I’m not just imagining things,” Dean exclaimed, becoming animated. “Cause you never used to have wrinkles or gray hairs, but sometimes I notice… dude, it’s happening to all of us… but you… I thought you wouldn’t get old.”
“Michael is an ancient and very powerful being. Jack’s energy is raw, as you say—he is young, untrained, and naïve. He could never defeat Michael in a face-to-face battle. I could not let him try. I promised Kelly that I would…”
Dean’s mouth quirked, and he snorted. “I dunno. You trust me not to kill him in his sleep now?”
Cas was suddenly struck by an awful thought. Just when Jack got his soul back… “You
… suddenly he was seeing stars, choking himself on cock while he ejaculated hard into his palm and onto the floorboards.
“No.” And there was that sweet, innocent smile again. Innocent, yet knowing more than he ought to.
Cas’ fingers slid to Dean’s shoulders, and Dean turned to look at him. “I don’t do hats.” Then he couldn’t help but grin. “I have
“You know
“Mmm, yeah. Realizing you’ve been a horrible monster takes a lot out of a guy.”
“You really trust Jack again, Cas? You think he’ll be ok?”
“Yes, I suppose I have.” Dean was aroused now, Castiel could feel it. He was curious and hard and his fingers still held onto the angel’s wrist. His soul fairly sparkled. Castiel could feel his own grace responding, his vibration edging higher. “I’ve seen violence and rape, to be sure. But I’ve also seen shepherds spreading their cloaks in the wet grass and making unrestrained love all night. I’ve seen soldiers stealing away together behind the barracks. I’ve seen a servant beg for a master’s cock. I’ve seen a king bend over for a servant.”
Next thing Dean knew, he was breaking all his own rules. With Sam snoring in the bed behind him, he slipped a hand up to the nape of Castiel’s neck, leaned closer, and kissed the angel full on the mouth. Castiel stiffened in surprise, his hand on Dean’s shoulder tightening, and Dean began to pull back—but Cas followed him, his mouth hot and wet and willing. So Dean committed, pulling the angel’s body flush, pressing in, opening up, and feeling Cas do the same.
He should remain calm, he thought. He shouldn’t upset Dean. Perhaps he shouldn’t even wake him. This was Castiel’s problem, the result of his own bargain—the deal he made to bring Jack back to them the first time. The Empty had refused to take him then—it said it would wait until he was
“No... That’s it, just ‘no’?” Dean sat up straighter, starting to bristle. “Dude, I couldn’t help myself, A., and B., I distinctly remember you saying, ‘What happens in Vegas…’”
“Jack,” he said, resting his hand on the nephilim’s shoulder. “I’m sorry if I seemed ungrateful tonight. I hope you understand that I’m very grateful. It’s all a bit of a shock, but I… I’ve done this before. And I’ll be fine.” He smiled. “Better than fine. You gave me a second chance. Thank you.”
This time, he would not take that for granted. This time, he would enjoy his humanity to the utmost. This time, he knew just how short life could be.
—like old show tunes, or Lynrd Skynrd? Greatest Heavenly Hits? How come I can’t actually hear it?”
“Ha! We’ll see about that, old man.”
“There,” Cas announced, stepping back and dropping his hand from Dean’s rear end, “you are free of tiny vampires.”
“There it is,” Dean grinned.
ok,” Dean declared. “What’sa matter? What’re you doing?”
Castiel’s hands floated to his chest, as if he could feel it. Well he could certainly feel something—all these emotions. Come to think of it, he was reacting the same way Jack had after visiting the garden and getting his soul back. Like a hot human mess.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dude, quit standing there looking rapey and come help me fold.”
Dean was watching him, brow furrowed, waiting for an answer. He opened his mouth, but nothing came out for a moment. Then he said “I feel… I feel I need some air.”
“Jack said you said that you and I would be having sex if it wasn’t so complicated. Well, it’s really not so complicated. I know that ideally it takes a little more preparation for two men, but people have been doing it for as long as I’ve been watching, and I fully understand how it’s done. I also understand that you need sex to feel happy and content. I know it’s relaxing and affirming for you. And while I’m not in a female vessel, I can still offer you a healing connection with your feminine side. We can be soft and gentle together, or we can be passionate and rough—whatever suits your needs. I am willing to help, Dean, and I’m here when you need me.”
Castiel blinked at him. Stared hard. It was true—he was human. Again. He had lost his grace’s bond to Dean’s soul. Again. But Dean’s hand on his arm was warm and solid, and Dean’s concern evident. Castiel’s stomach clenched, his chest tightening, and his eyes began to sting as a wave of emotion rolled through him.
“That’s the least of our problems,” Sam replied a moment later, as Dean tried to find the weather on the radio again. He was swiping at his phone when Dean looked up at him again. “The highway’s closed now. Tractor-trailers blocking the road, accidents… plows can’t get through.”
It became apparent upon his return that he’d been too expedient. Standing in the doorway with a cold, sweating beer in his hand, he took in Sam, slouched in the far chair and fiddling with his phone, and Cas on the bed, propped stiffly against the pillows, wide-eyed and completely engrossed by the writhing figures still on the screen. So engrossed that he didn’t actually notice what was happening right next to him, where Jack sat staring—and digging the heel of his hand rhythmically into his crotch.
He’d sometimes felt this way with Sam, on a really good day. Or with Cas. Lots of times, come to think of it, with Cas. For instance, when Cas would say something so kind or so amazingly dorky and it would just break the tension during a shitty hunt and make Dean grin. He couldn’t help but feel warm all over just thinking about it. Grateful for his angelic best friend.
“I’ve been enough trouble for you today. Now here I am, nearly naked in your bed and asking for your touch and tempting you when I know you have trouble containing your sexual urges…”
to run and save himself.
Dean moaned, reaching to grab Cas by the ass. “Now that ain’t fair… where’d you learn to talk like that, dirty little angel?”
Castiel blinked. Dean turned and pushed the cart over to a dryer.
“No… just… hurry up, man.”
Castiel’s eyes flicked back to the mirror, his fingers drifting back to his belly again. “I feel… as if it’s still happening. The putrefaction. My grace is… guttering, for lack of a better word. I keep imagining it’s happening again… It seems that it won’t stop.” He looked down at himself, then at Dean, his eyes wide and pleading. “Can you see it? Is it happening?”
He didn’t move while Sam and Dean showered, nor did he move when Dean settled on the bed beside him in his sweatpants and cracked open a beer, then flipped through a few channels. Sam slouched on the other bed, engrossed in something on his laptop. “Hey,” Dean said, giving Cas a gentle elbow in the kidney, “
No… oh no…
Castiel watched a drop of water roll down the side of Dean’s face. He could feel waves of tension radiating from the man. After spending forty years in Hell and fighting monsters his entire life, why was a small insect on his genitals so distressing?
Dean turned around to face him. “Dude, I promised my Dad I’d look after Sam, and I’ve done my best, but I can’t be there every minute of every day. And shit happens. I couldn’t put Sam here in a plastic bubble, and you can’t do that to Jack either. He’s got his own life to live. Stop beating yourself up.”
“A concussion as well,” Cas declared, frowning.
“You don’t need to, man,” Dean argued. “Come on, jump in with the rest of us. It feels nice—you’ll like it.”
“Yes. We talked for some time, but he says he’d like to sleep now. I imagine he could use the rest, after what he’s been through.”
before in his life.
“Come on Jack,” he heard Sam calling. “It’s your turn!”
He had failed Dean again.
And Cas suddenly understood.
“Fuck! Come on Baby…”
“Is that so? You are powerful, but not as powerful as Emptiness.” The false Jack winked and dissolved in an instant, back into the darkness that now crept up over Castiel’s belly and chest, moving faster, sealing his fate.
“You’re fucking scaring me, man. I don’t wanna hurt you. I don’t want to lose again. We’re too close.”
“What the hell’s taking so long?”
Dean frowned. Cas had a point, probably, but from his current perspective in the angel’s lap, the awkward Dean Winchester who could regret canoodling with Cas seemed like a long-ago version of himself who used to be kind of a dick. He looked into Cas’ wide eyes, dropped his gaze to Cas’ lush lips, which looked moist and inviting. There was really only one thing to do. He grabbed Castiel’s face and planted one on him.
“Guh, hey, what…” Dean flailed for a moment, sat up, looked down—and saw the clinging darkness engulfing his friend below the knees. He leapt off the sofa like he’d been goosed. “Cas! What the… what the fuck is
“Ha… awesome.” Dean snagged a pillow, stood up and held it in front of him as he turned around. “Let’s see.”
? Buddy are you… are you
“Dude, I’m not making babies anytime soon. Just do it.”
“The men…?”
“Wanna help?”
“Nothing,” Castiel quipped. “I’m just enjoying the view.”
Cas stretched out an arm and as the brothers watched, snow began to fly from beneath the Impala. A small whirlwind took shape around the car, nearly blinding them for a few moments.
“Soul or no soul, angel or no angel, you belong here,” Dean declared. He turned to Jack. “And so do you. End of story. Now get back in the bunker, it’s cold out here. My nipples can cut glass right now.”
shit?
Sam snatched the remote, sat down in the big recliner and kicked back, while Dean grabbed one end of the couch, and Jack perched beside him. Castiel sank down on the other end, remembering again what it took to “get comfortable.” Finding a way to sit that would keep his legs and back from becoming stiff and sore after a short time. Making sure his clothing wasn’t twisted up beneath or behind him or pinching his testicles. Being human could be such a chore. He watched Sam and Dean make their own adjustments, settling back and preparing to argue over the night’s entertainment.
A memory came back to him, unbidden, of seeing Sam do the same thing on a public bus. He was probably six years old, which meant Dean was 10—and had barely figured out his
Dean kissed him again, until the protests stopped. Until all he could hear was the wind howling, and the sounds of two people sucking face with enthusiasm—if not finesse. All he could smell and taste was Cas. All he could feel was Cas’ warm, wet mouth against his, Cas’ strong arms around him, his own dick hard in his pants and rubbing against the denim as he rolled his hips against nothing, because his knees against the seat back kept him from getting as close to Castiel’s pelvis as he longed to. And beneath his hands, Cas seemed to be… rumbling…?
“Of course not.”
“No, c’mon, it’s your turn. Lemme do it. Pretty sure I can.”
Jack sat up straighter. “Alright,” he replied with seriousness.
“Yes. What about the men?”
Dean thought, trying not to look at the bulge in the kid’s jeans. Or at the TV screen, which had been paused on somebody’s contorted face. “Good,” he said. “So, listen, I need to tell you a couple important things.”
Dean gathered himself and stood up shakily, wiping his hand on the end of the quilt. “Damn, these ol’ knees don’t like the floor anymore.” He flopped onto the bed on his back, and Cas stretched out beside him, leaned over him, pressed their lips together again in a lingering kiss, warm hand against his cheek.
Dean chatted amiably about nothing in particular while they dumped the clothes onto a counter and began to sort—lights in one pile and darks in another. Castiel listened, smiling at Dean’s little jokes, nodding or interjecting now and then to let Dean know he was paying attention. A TV in the corner droned on about politics in Washington DC, and Castiel tried to ignore it—though it occurred to him to ask Dean if perhaps there was a job there. Given his behavior, Speaker of the House Mitch McConnell seemed to be under some sort of spell. Castiel scrubbed stain remover into a bloody sleeve…
