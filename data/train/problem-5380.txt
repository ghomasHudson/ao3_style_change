Cas looked at him with a certain desire growing in his eyes as he started walking them toward the wood of the dock. He pushed Dean against the wood which caused him to moan loudly. Cas started to bite on the nub of his ear as he whispered, “Dean... Are you sure?”
“I’m not an angel anymore remember?” Cas looked up at Dean.
“Are you sure Dean?” Cas asked a little weary.
“You’re worth it Cas,” He commented as he began pulling out burgers he ordered specially from the roadhouse ahead of time.
Dean puts the key in the ignition and turns the key. The black steed purrs and roars to life. Dean pops in one of the cassettes and turns up the dial to a suitable volume. He needed something to calm him down and music always helps.
“How do you know?” He said as he looked towards Benny skeptically.
An hour passed as Dean fell asleep naked against Cas wrapping his arms and legs around his lover, his angel, his everything. Cas kept Dean warm and safe all night listening to his heartbeat steadily against him until the sun came up. Dean woke up looking at Cas with green droopy eyes. Cas was about to get up when he felt Dean's arms wrapped tightly around him, pulling him on top of him.
“Can we have this conversation somewhere else?” Dean looks at Cas rubbing his hands along the side of his jeans.
“There is, but this one is ours.” Cas leaned into Dean.
“You ready?” Cas said in a deep voice that made his spine tingle taking a glance towards the clear water.
"What was that?" Jack asked.
Dean instantly stopped him by placing a finger on his lips then smiled, “Before you ask no I don’t regret it. Hell, I probably will want to do it again, but please try to convince me to wait. Walking right now is going to be a bitch.”
Flash. Cas has just started his national tour singing country music to thousands of people every night, but Cas misses being curled up at home every night. He especially misses Dean who is on his rock tour on the other side of the country. It’s crazy how they didn’t like each other in the beginning, but soon fell in love with each other. He wished they would have worked it out before they planned their tour dates. Cas is sitting in his dressing room when his phone rings. Dean immediately started telling Cas how much he misses him and telling him he has a break in the next couple of days. Dean’s going to fly to see him at his next show. Cas starts crying and Dean tells him not to cry. “No distance will ever keep us apart. Cas, you’re my home no matter where you are I’ll be there.”  Cas tells Dean he just wants to be cuddled up in their couch in Kansas, but Dean tells him he has a surprise the next time he flies out to see him. Dean ends the call with Cas. “Did you get the ring?” Charlie walks up to him and hands him a black box. “You already know.”
Dean then started walking slowly as they started walking towards their cabin, “Yeah... Well, I wasn’t expecting you to ram me like a sex doll.”
They spent an hour eating and chatting about their day as if they were in their own dining room. Cas was able to convince him to slow dance with him for two songs under the beautiful open Kansas sky.
“You look incredible too Cas, more like breath taking hotstuff,” He commented as he gave Cas a quick kiss on the cheek.
Cas moved his hand under Dean’s chin and moved his head up to meet his eyes. His eyes were compassionate, healing, and the most beautiful shade of blue… “Dean, what do you mean you like me?”
He leans back to take a moment to look at Cas’s smooth chest, chiseled abs, and thick thighs. It’s driving him crazy as he leans forwards nip at Cas’s collarbone earning him a hiss from Cas. While he slowly pulls down Cas’s dress pants.
He couldn’t help but laugh as he looked down at the card. He placed it on his chest as he looks towards a family picture of him, Dean, Claire, and Jack sitting on their dresser.
His heart did a three-sixty in his chest as they both sat down, “Do you know why I picked this place?”
Dean couldn’t help but moan as he looked down at Cas’s messy hair and red swollen lips on his nipples. He started to feel his body charging more and more slowly coming close to the edge which he enjoyed with Cas.
Cas kept insisting on having a night in and not going out this year, but he wants to make tonight special. Mostly because over twenty years ago the younger version of themselves were getting ready for their first date. Cheesy, right? Well he made sure to never forget this day because it means everything to him. The day he found the love of his life.
Cas has a huge smile on his face as he snuggled closer towards the warmth of Dean’s body, “Are you sure?”
Before he even had the chance to get away Sam noticed Dean had a mark on his neck that he was trying to hide, but the lack of his flannel made it harder. Sam stopped Dean, “Before you leave can I use the impala?”
Cas was smiling as he began opening the bottles of beer.
He smiled as Cas rolled them both over pinning him to the ground as he pulled his pants and boxers off throwing them aside, looking down adoringly and territorial towards his cock.
Cas stared at Dean adoringly, “Yeah, but I want to hear you say it.”
Dean shook his head, “As much as I love you showing me things when I get nightmares, I prefer us creating our own memory,” Dean said as he placed a kiss on Cas’s forehead.
Dean parked the impala in their driveway and parked next to Cas vehicle. He took a look at the door and had a faint flashback to their first date.
Dean and Cas pulled into the garage still holding onto each other's hands. Walking further into the bunker they agreed to meet in the bathroom. Even though they shared a moment on the road they wanted to be stingy and clingy with each other. Cas quickly pulled his trench coat over Dean's flannel shirt as he went to check on Jack.
Cas wasted no time and sinker further into him a deep groan erupted from him as both of their bodies intertwined. Cas places more weight on top of him as he sucked a mark on his neck. While he ran his hands along Cas back and leaving marks on his back as Cas continued making slow deep thrusts into him. The beautiful blue eyes began to dilate. Cas begins to thrusts a little hard making him moan a little louder as Cas quickened his pace a little more slammed into him. Which he was crazy for.
He was never an expert on blow jobs considering Cas was his first, but they learned everything about each other through trial and error. Cas’s breathing slowed down as he let out needing grunt, he knew Cas was very close. He pulled away making a small pop as he smirked up at Cas.
Cas blushed as he reached for his hand and pulled out of their driveway. He kept sneaking quick glances towards Cas because he likes the way the moonlight shines on his eyes.
“I’m sure," Dean said as he looked down at Cas.
“It’s never to late Dean.” Cas placed little kisses on Dean's neck as they swayed.
He has a smirk on his face, “Alright Bobby, but if you tell us what you have planned for Ellen.”
“Do you think Sam noticed I was wearing your flannel?” Cas asked as he placed a kiss on Dean's chest.
Cas looked up towards his face and quickly noticed Cas’s eyes were having a dark desire as his eyes wandered all over his body. Dean held out his hand towards Cas. He pulled his body against him as Cas took a nip at his neck. Dean moaned lightly in response. Everything Cas did to him sent chills throughout his body which he loved.
He chuckled a little as he took the rose between his fingers tips. Roses were the first thing Dean gave him after they confessed their love all those years ago. He took a quick sniff of the rose as he picked up the card. The cover reads:
“I just keep thinking that you'll say you've made a mistake," Cas tried turning his eyes away from Dean, but Dean moved his chin eyes back towards him.
Dean had a growing smile on his face as he grazed his thumb across Cas’s side, “Yes, now why are you up this early?”
“Shit... I forgot, how am I going to explain why I can’t walk?” Dean asked a little concern.
“I’ll let Cas know,” He turns to Benny, “You ready to train the rookies Latife?”
“Dean, you look beautiful,” Cas looked up at him as his eye shined in the moonlight.
“Dean?” He heard Cas speak breathily into the crook of his neck.
They don't talk about the future and put each other in it
“You’re my angel.” Dean placed a kiss on Cas head.
Dean looked at Cas and leaned in and kissed him again, over and over before starting the impala.
“Better, come on,” as he reached for Cas hand.
Cas looked at Dean with everything like his only thing. Even all these memories don’t stand a chance from this one right here.
“I know you like the back of my hand baby,” He smirked as he planted a kiss on Cas stomach, “I was promised to be fucked?” He mumbled through continued kisses.
Feelings were fleeting but now I'm surrounded
Dean stood in front of baby, Cas approached from the other side, His beautiful sapphire blue eyes met Dean’s emerald green eyes. Dean and Cas were finally alone, Dean started internally panicking, like his heart was going to jump out of his chest. He hopes Cupid don’t kill him. His eyes made contact with Cas’s, he finally understood the change that is about to happen. To be honest, it kinda scared the living shit out of him, but he really wanted to be with Cas.
Another flash. Dean was sitting alone with a bottle of whiskey, he looked broken and had dried tears below his eyes. He then reached for the phone and pressed it to his head. Cas picked up on the other side, he asked Dean if he needed him. Dean started talking about having a horrible day at work and needing to say hi. Cas on the other end giving him a prep talk and telling him he’s coming over. Cas told Dean to stop drinking and he’ll be over soon. Dean started pushing away the bottle after he hung up the phone. Cas showing up a few minutes later pulling Dean up and changing his clothes for him. A couple of minutes passed and they were cuddled up on Dean’s bed. Cas wrapping Dean up with his arms and legs with a blanket over them. Dean was smiling and sleeping pressing his head into Cas’s chest.
“I love you Cas.” He looked into Cas’s blue eyes.
“Hey do you wanna… You know for old time sake?” He whispered into Cas ear.
“Do you ever miss being alone?” Cas asked as he looked into Dean's eyes.
Cas bit his lips then looked out their doors which caused Dean to look towards the lake where they bought their cabin. Cas then looked back towards him with a devious smile.
And I just want to go home
Visions of you shaved into the side of my head
Dean landed down to kiss Cas to stop him from rambling, “I trust you Cas with everything including what’s in my head.”
"Dean?"
"Let's just go." Older Sam said, pocketing his hands into his jeans. Younger Sam was grateful for a distraction. After all, that library earlier seemed pretty damn cool and he wanted to look more into it. Dean would make fun of him if he was here but at this place and time? He didn't care at all.
The Kansas Plateau. Perfect.
be a warrior and never shall you be accepted at the Gates of Heaven ever!" He loudly proclaimed, his voice so ferocious that Castiel would have faced a tiger or a large boar instead.
Suddenly, there was a set of loud drums.
He spotted many of his companions spread their wings out and flew, shooting up in a matter of seconds.
He had caused this. He had hurt people.
He didn't know how long he was standing there but it was enough for Jimmy to notice. His attention turned to the real world when the elder called out his name.
Castiel picked up a large bag of kernels and ran outside, where he passed his horse, Samuel. The stallion had been raised on a farm ever since it was a small foal.
For one, the shape was different. The machine was longer and flatter. The top of it wasn't open like the military vehicles, it was closer and sealed off tightly. And instead of the ashy grey color that Castiel had observed, it had a dark coating
With a crash landing that shook the land and blasted everything in the area with so much force that the trees blew away in a wide circle, Castiel rose slowly from the creator and looked around.
Castiel took a scurrying step back as he watched the rice grains flow out of the hole like water out of an open facet. He grabbed a stool and reached up to the ceiling where he quickly untied the sack from the ceiling and watched as more rice spilled out of it once it plummeted to the ground.
Pain does make you stronger.
Jimmy shook his head. He got onto his feet and walked over to the shelves where he searched for the registration form. When the scroll didn't appear, Jimmy pulled away from the shelves like he was burned. "He's going to the military camps."
"Holy..." Castiel heard behind him. He spun around and was faced by a dark-haired man in a black uniform. He had a large rifle by his side and holding a radio to his face.
Then all Hell broke loose.
Castiel clung to the pavement and weakly crawled down the path, his visual slowly turning darker, or was that the sun?
The elder man pulled back sharply with his hand clasped over his mouth, feeling the sliced bristles of his precious beard. The grandmaster stared at him in shock for a few seconds before all hell broke loose.
"Now," Roy shouted, glaring at Lucifer behind his fingers. "All of Heavan knows that you're he-" But before he could finish his sentence, he felt something pierce his armor and straight through his abdomen where most of his organs were. Roy's hand fell away from his face and now all he could see is Lucifer's face right in front of him.
The air was cold.
Besides, Dad would never accept it if his grandson wasn't a human.
Then, he froze.
Deadly still.
A round man in a blue and silver robe rode to the front of the two flanking soldiers, presenting himself as the leader of the unit. He had a bushy beard and a face that was genuinely so
And on that very night, a war was started.
He peeked his head out of the doorway and glanced down the hallway, trying to look for his older brother. "Jimmy?" He called out again.
of you lugs, right?" He attempted at humor but now, it sounded sour. Dean bit his lip before swinging himself towards Sam and slapping his face weakly.
Samuel neighed at Castiel when he moved towards the chicken pen, in which the young man simply waved in response. Castiel walked over to the feeder and tipped the bag forward, filling the tube up until it was all filled and loaded.
That's who.
Today was going to be a difficult day and this would be proof of that.
What happened to the brother that he knew?
"Damnit, Metatron." He heard Jimmy grumble beside him. He could tell by the tone of his voice that he was very aware of the people looking their way.
The grandmaster's head leaned to the side and squinted at him, a frown on his lips. He marked another 'X' on the chart. "Poor position. Not good for presentation." He scowls.
"'Don't get into trouble'? Dean-" Sam pressed the corners of his fingers into his sinus. "Okay, Dad told us to get materials, salt, and whatever we can get our hands on. It's better to do that now than later and have him pissed off at us so...?" He waved his hands weakly. "And hopefully the one person we'll run into is the cashier. There's no harm in that, right?
He couldn't run down the smooth path, for it was too clean and left him exposed for attack, which meant he had to take the messy forest trail with plenty of roots that would slow his escape.
Castiel widened his eyes and reached forward, latching onto Samuel's reins and shushing the horse.
Fortunately, the form had already been signed and completed. At least that wouldn't be a problem, Castiel thought as he stuffed the scroll in his pocket.
Castiel stares at Jimmy for a moment before spinning around. He sped out of the house, not caring if his bare feet scratched against the rough rocky path. His appetite dwindled faster than a festering forest fire. In fact, he felt like he might damn well puke.
"You won't make me talk." Castiel spat back, hatred in every word. "You can try your hardest but I'll never give up."
But as much as Castiel fled, he could not outrun the following explosion of energy.
you, you filthy
"It wasn't you if that's what you're thinking of." Older Sam shook his head. Dean gawked at him in shock. How did the older Sam know what he was thinking or was his guilt really that easy to read? "At least not just you. There were a lot of other bad guys that messed with our lives. It's not too bad though, hunts are practically a milk run nowadays." He spoke casually.
The people around the called young man gasped in surprise, still expecting Jimmy to be in the suit, despite the fact that Jimmy had already completed the ceremony many years earlier. This fact made Castiel a little depressed, knowing that people were more fond of his brother than him.
He turned to his sister and nodded his head. "I pray to our Father that I will see you soon, sister," Castiel said. "I will establish a safe base for our brethren."
He tried to ignore the sidelining comments but they swarmed around him like obnoxious gnats. The more as they trotted down the alley, the more Castiel's confidence started to dwindle.
Through the swaying open doors walked out the grandmaster, small scratches on his face and looking just as bad as Castiel, except his expression was furious. His eyebrows dipped deep into his face and his chest heaving up and down. His hands clenched by his sides tightly and his body was absolutely quaking.
He seemed to be having a conversation with Samuel, who was rearing his head and weighing loudly.
Perfect.
Sam, on the other hand, didn't care at all. In fact, he was overjoyed. He and Mary had connected nearly immediately. When Sam mentioned Jess, Mary gave him a sympathetic look and placed her hand on his shoulder in comfort. They exchanged words without sound and only glance.
Runes lit up and traveled from Ramiel's hand and traveled to Castiel's body, forcing his throat to seize and the grace in his body to boil.
He pulled out his spear with his other hand and pressed the tip to Castiel's chest. "You are a failure of an angel. As of such, you will be execut-"
“Uhh… I- I..”
“I love you too,” Cas says as he places a deep kiss on his lips.
Dean and Cas arrived at the end of the dock and quickly started discarding all their clothing stripping down to nothing. Dean was almost there; he just needed to pull down his boxers and sweats. After they discarded their clothing Dean could keep his eyes off Cas’s beautiful sun-kissed skin, to the way his body moved, and the thickness of his thighs. He was hypnotized by Cas's naked tone body. He had to keep convincing himself that the man standing in front of him godlike was his.
They laid there for hours listening to the radio playing softly in the background doing nothing but listening to each other's heartbeat. Dean loved the moments where it was just him and Cas. He loved his family, but it was something about sharing the little things with Cas like waking up next to each other, sharing showers, and even listening to Cas talk about something interesting that warmed his heart.
“Dean, what are we doing?” Cas gave Dean a puzzled facial expression.
“I’ve got you... I’ve got you,” Cas kept mumbling repeatedly as he ran his hot tongue across Dean’s cold neck then growled filthily, “Damn... You feel... Ugh, you feel so good... So good Dean.”
Soon the clock finally hit 7pm and it was time for the shift change. He instantly took off towards the locker room to change out of his uniform and put on a his suit.
“Please boy all I have to do is give you a pie for answers,” Bobby sneers, “Also bring Jack by the house your mother wants to see him.”
Dean leaned back and cut him off by grabbing his head and pressing their lips together. Dean ran his tongue against Cas’s lips then leaned back as he rested their foreheads towards, “You don’t have to say anything more to convince me. Now, are we going to do this or what?”
It’s been two years since Dean admitted his feelings to Cas. Since then they have been living together and haven’t left each other's side. Cas wakes up in Dean’s bed, but Dean always finds a way to keep Cas in bed longer. Dean tells Cas everyday how much he loves him. Cas has been learning to make Dean pie. Dean has been secretly planning on getting a house in Lawrence for the both of them. Dean and Cas are now in a much better place then they have been in all the years they have been alive. Cas is growing more and more human everyday and Cas is enjoying all his first with Dean. Cas is looking forward to growing old with Dean.
Dean’s eyes started to flutter open as his drowsy eyes looked down towards Cas. He began tightening his grip around Cas's waist then whispered in a groggy tone, “For you, yes.”
Bump… Bump…. Bump… Bump…. Bump… Bump….
Cas ram into him a lot more frequently as he felt their body’s become hot. He also started to feel a tingling sensation on his neck as he looked down to see Cas sucking bruises on his neck as their bodies slowly rocked to a steady rhythm fanning the flame deep inside. Dean’s breathing started increasing as he ran his fingers along Cas’s back and the wood behind him.
“So,” He smirks as he huskily says, “What do you say about abandoning these clothes?”
Then another flash. This time Dean and Cas were inside a bar separated. Dean was sitting next to Benny and he mentioned his classmate Cas. Dean started looking towards Cas’s general direction, He was sitting with Charlie at a separate table. Dean was lost in thought looking at the blue eyed angel. Then, Benny immediately started waving his hand in front of Dean to get his attention, which was somewhere else. Charlie mentioned running into Dean recently, which Cas looked around and spotted Dean being yelled at by Benny. He chuckled, He loved everything about the freckled man lost in thought. Charlie stopping her conversation when she noticed Cas wasn’t paying attention and started waving her hand in front of Cas, who’s attention was somewhere else.
When he starts the car a familiar song came on the radio. The song Cas caught him singing to Claire in a rocking chair. He would be lying if he didn’t admit he was incredibly embarrassed.
Another Flash. Cas was playing with his keys inside of his coat. Dean was cooking food with a smile on his face. Sam was a lot smaller, he started telling Dean to stop dancing and finish cooking. Dean gave him an eye roll and continued dancing. Cas was waiting for Dean to be finished while sitting at their counter. Dean sneaking looks at Cas while cooking for Sam. Cas was stirring up conversation about his job trying to hide the blush that was growing on his face. Sam walking out of the kitchen told them to stop hiding their emotions and tell each other how they really feel.
“Y- Yeah,” He mumbled as he stared at Cas hungrily as Cas began sucking a bruise on his thigh then his stomach.
“Yea..” Dean tried to avoid his stare and continued to look at the ground.
“I’m surprised you’re even telling me all this,” Sam says.
That is absolutely true.
“Just your side. So, was she?”
“So, what, are you regretting what you said before? Is that it? You don’t wanna tell me you’ve changed your mind?”
“Listen, Cas. I know I was wrong, but I really did think that you couldn’t - that you didn’t feel things the way humans do,” Dean explains. “You know, things were so different for you when you were human. Then when you got your grace back you couldn’t even enjoy food anymore because it was just molecules or whatever. I just assumed - ”
“I’m uh, making some changes in the bunker. Nothing big but I think it’ll be nice,” he manages to say, having to change track every other word or he’ll end up saying way too much. “So there’s really no rush, you know… You do what you gotta do, man. I’m here—I’m around, whenever you’re ready.”
“Okay, good. That’s good.”
“Do you wanna sit down?” Dean asks.
Cas is leaning forward in his chair, his brow furrowed in concern. So cute. So absurdly, unfairly cute.
“Hey, Cas. I’m, uh, I’m folding those socks I was telling you about last time,” Dean prays. “You know, with the tacos?”
Dean laughs. He laughs more than he probably should. But goddamn, that’s Cas. The measured tone. The hesitance overcome by curiosity. It’s Cas. Jesus Christ, it’s Cas.
It’s silly, but Dean loves that Cas goes out of his way to say “around four hours” instead of rattling off the exact duration from the top of his head the way Dean knows he can do. It’s a habit Cas has formed in the last few years. Dean’s not sure whether it’s a deliberate attempt to seem less alien to humans, or something he just picked up by accident. Either way, it’s endearing.
Right now, he actually does kinda want to go to bed. He’s already
“Like—you know, like they want me,” Dean says. He’s not being very eloquent at the moment, but he thinks Cas will understand why he’s distracted. “And then there are the ones who just think I’m pretty or whatever. They just want to stare.”
Dean’s been hit on by women a lot in his life. A lot. He’s been approached by men, too, and he
“But it’s not the same thing, Cas.”
again. The familiar argument is poised and ready. “You don’t think I can do it?”
“Just let me know if you’re gonna go off with them so I don’t worry about you.”
“There isn’t a different one in the area?”
Dean scoots over so Cas can sit next to him without having to walk around the bed. He wants to pat the mattress and summon Cas like a pet, but he just barely refrains.
“Thank you, Amal,” Dean says, with only the slightest pause to read the nametag and note their pronouns. “I will need those bags for the groceries I’m buying!”
“Yeah, I was in the mood for that. Was that okay?”
Excruciating. That was just excruciating. He stuck to the script better than he’d expected, but he still wants to roll off his bed and then roll right under it, never to be seen again.
“We decided I’d only do research every other week. During Cas weeks. And then on the off-weeks I’m supposed to, you know, relax. Somehow. I mean, I usually end up crawling up the walls. Sometimes I watch a movie. I get drunk.”
“What can I do to convince you to talk to me, man? What do I have to do? I’ll do anything at this point. Anything you want, and I mean it. You don’t even know—can’t even imagine how much I mean it. And you won’t know until you agree to talk to me. So just… Just come talk to me. That’s all I ask. Please.”
“Cool. Uh, do you think we could, like, test it now?”
“That series you like, yes. And you just sounded so—interested, and engaged. I wanted to see what it looked like. And I knew you were in the library, so I assumed I could just—and then you were—”
Dean is eating again, so he just nods and hums affirmatively.
There’s a weird thing going on in his body, like he’s being pulled towards Cas but also wants to bolt. He wants to deal with this, and he simultaneously doesn’t ever want to deal with it. But he knows now which side he needs to be on, so. Onward it is.
“Just two what?” Cas says.
deep.
Less amazing is the fact that Dean was definitely going to suggest exactly what Cas said. And coming from Cas’ mouth it sounds good, because Cas’ voices always sounds good, but it also sounds like a really stupid idea. Maybe that’s just the tone Cas is using, like Dean is the most exasperating person Cas has ever met in his long, long life.
“Cut the crap, Cas! What aren’t you telling me? If you say nothing one more time—”
He must not have really expected Dean to push the door open, because his eyes go wide in panic.
“I’m doing great, thanks for asking,” Amal replies. The words are from the standard customer service script, but the delivery is much friendlier than the standard Dean is accustomed to. They’re biting their lip to fight back a smile, which means the smile they want to make is friendlier than the standard, too.
were cute, I guess. I dunno if I’d say pretty.”
“I can’t believe that of all the times you could have dropped in on me, it had to be one of those. Of all the times we talked!” Dean (humiliatingly) practically gushes.
When Cas comes back, he disappears.
Dean strains to listen even though the voice had been coming from all directions and would be impossible to miss in the silent room.
Oh. Dean gets it. His understanding rushes through him, heating him up from head to toe. He’s probably never blushed like this in his life.
Dean is really starting to wonder if Cas even wants to come back at all. He’s so strangely resistant.
Dean isn’t sure where or how the threshold was hit, but he realizes he can actually imagine a future with Cas. It feels amazing. He’d daydreamed about it before, but it never felt attainable, and there was never any anticipation in it - just a twinge of hopelessness. Now he’s so hopeful he has hardly any idea what to even hope for, like there are too many possibilities to choose from. And the anticipation is unreal. It feels like the butterflies, except it’s more of a low, constant hum than a whirlwind.
He can talk about that part, but any discussion of Cas’ feelings for Dean will have to wait. Dean is surprisingly ready for that conversation. He’s been wanting to have it for months. But he’s also terrified of it, and he wants to do it when they’re face-to-face. So he’s not gonna talk about that until he gets Cas out. When Cas can feel the earth under his feet and the sun shining on his face. They can talk about it then.
“I just wanted to see you,” Dean says, because he has to start somewhere.
Dean can relate. Ever since Cas died, he hasn’t been able to stop thinking of what would happen when he gets Cas back. What will he do? How will he talk to him? What does Cas even want from him, really? What will they become?
“Okay, Dean,” Cas finally says. “Just… No more potions. That’s not a productive avenue.”
Oh. That was a—that was an interesting tone of voice. The kind that’s meant to be listened to.
“I mean, I like calling you a lot of things,” Dean says cautiously.
“What’s on the list?”
Dean knows that Cas doesn’t mean
Dean can’t even pretend he’s upset, though, and soon they’re grinning at each other like idiots.
“I get that now,” Dean says once he’s able to school his expression into something slightly less exuberant. “Don’t get so grouchy about it, I’m trying to have a moment with you, here.”
After the furniture delivery arrives and everything is set up where it’s gonna go, Dean realizes that he’s missing some things, so he has to go back into town.
He hasn’t seen Cas since he died. They’ve spent countless hours talking; Dean has heard his voice over and over again. But he hasn’t seen his face. He hasn’t had eyes on Cas in so long that Dean feels like he’s finally taking a drink of water after an eternity of thirst.
Dean can tell that there’s a lot more Cas wants to say. He knows the feeling. He has never wanted to talk to someone as much as he wants to talk to Cas. He has to make a conscious effort to keep it all in his head.
“Okay, cool. And I got a sofa for the Dean Cave too. So we can, uh—” Dean falters, because Cas has leaned back in and is slowly kissing Dean’s neck. It takes everything Dean has to stop himself from throwing his head back and moaning. He’s barely keeping it together. “So you can sit with me, you know. Instead of separate chairs.”
He’s not gonna say it like that, not just yet, but he thinks it really, really hard. He keeps eye contact and wishes Cas will stay with every ounce of hope that he has.
“Really?” The tone of Cas’ voice makes Dean turn to look at him, which is a mistake because he’s got an eyebrow raised and he’s pinning Dean with a shrewd look. “You’ve always struck me as more the submissive type.”
Dean doesn’t want to hang out, but part of him wants to say yes just to see what would happen.
“Yes! Totally. I just, uh—” Dean rubs a hand down his face. “I just wanna take our time, you know? I know it’s stupid since we’ve  so long already, but that’s also kind of why I want to take it slow.”
“You too,” Dean calls after them.
from Cas. Everything else? Whatever it is they’re about to embark on? It’s all extra. Dean wants it so bad, but he doesn’t need anything the way he needs to have Cas by his side. He’s accepted that now, and he’s no longer afraid to show it.
“Shut up and take the compliment.”
“Is something wrong?” He asks in a low voice, afraid that the party has gone off the rails before it has even really begun.
“Well, there’s your answer then.  Make it very clear to him that this is adult time but for talking only.  If things happen, they happen, but as long as your intentions are to just talk about it and not to lure him to bed, then you should be good to go.”
“Yeah, Dean. I do live here, remember?  How are you Castiel?” Sam gave Cas a polite smile and a nod.
Cas let the tears fall.  “I do, Dean.  I do believe you.  I’m so sorry!” He threw himself into Dean’s arms, sobbing out his frustration.  He could get past this, he could!  Castiel was determined that he would not let his insecurities ruin this for him.  He wanted Dean and this relationship and he would do whatever he had to if it meant keeping Dean.
He is suddenly aware of the inevitability of jerking off to the sound of Cas’ voice before he can get up off the floor.
“Sure,” Cas says.
“Don’t you start with that!” Dean groans. “It’s not cute, it’s annoying. It’s cowardice, is what it is!”
“Yes.”
“I’m sorry I never told you. I was a coward, man. And I didn’t want anything to change. It was bad enough - ” Dean stops himself. He doesn’t say ‘it was bad enough that you were always gone as it was’. Instead he continues, “I just, I just didn’t want you to go anywhere. I just wanted you to stay. I always just want you to stay. So I couldn’t risk it. Was never an option.”
Nothing weird about that, right?
Dean almost has a heart attack hearing “if you feel the same”. It takes him a second to realize Cas is saying that Dean knows how it feels to be willing to do anything to save someone. Not… that other thing that Dean had first thought of.
“Of course,” Cas says.
“And were
“No buts! Time spent on you is time spent on myself, because I need you. End of story,” Dean says, and then shoves a huge bite of sandwich into his mouth to shut himself up for a second.
Cas pulls back, frowning slightly.
“I was afraid, Dean. That’s it.”
Cas just stares down at Dean’s hand for a few seconds. Then for a few more seconds.
“The same as every time I make dinner, I guess? It’s just a regular grocery store, but I’m pretty sure they have everything I’d need for whatever I decide to make.”
“Yeah, I am,” Dean finally says, out loud, to Amal. Here we go. He can—he can totally save this. “What—what—what about you?”
“I mean like, what’s next? If you think that the witch cursed me?”
“You’re a son of a bitch, you know that, Cas? Screw you. I’ll yell at you again tomorrow. And every day after that. Asshole.”
Dean awoke slowly, and instead of the usual crashing realization that Cas is gone, a completely different kind of memory washed over him. It doused him in a kind of giddy excitement that surprised him in its intensity.
“I’m sorry I couldn’t—I mean... I’m sorry he ended up like that. I know it’s not what you wanted for him,” Dean says.
“Yes.”
He doesn’t let himself. Instead, he rubs at his eyes and clears his throat.
Dean opens his eyes and watches the ceiling. It takes him a while to continue, but eventually he does.
Dean doesn’t need to open his eyes to know that Cas is in the room.
“Four,” Dean answers automatically.
Life is weird. Dean’s enjoying it, though.
Uh. Wait.
Dean has never understood the phrase “hit like a ton of bricks” more than he does now. There’s a heavy pressure in his chest and on his back and his heart is caving in. His throat is dry. He’s going to throw up.
Cas is quiet for a minute. Dean sorts through his books and waits.
Dean realizes he’s passed the store. He drives up a ways to find somewhere to turn around.
“That makes them less than ideal for a relationship, but what about just a night? You said they were cute.”
Still the cutest thing Dean’s ever seen.
“Really? Just you? What about Sam?”
“No, that was the way you watched me while I was sleeping,” Dean reminds him, and then smiles at the perfect opportunity to say: “I wouldn’t mind if you did that now, though. Not even a little bit.”
“Maybe I’ll tell him about you—about how we were talking. We talked so much and I never breathed a word of it to Sam. Kind of a dick move, actually. You’re his friend too. I just—I don’t know; I wanted you to myself, I guess. Because either Sam would be able to talk to you too, or he’d have to use me to pass messages along. Either way, I didn’t want—I mean it was important to me, what we were doing. It was special, I guess. Just for me.”
“Not much of a conversation right now,” Dean says. He picks at the label on his bottle and doesn’t look at Cas.
“Dean, you spend literally half your life looking for a way to rescue
, here. We talked about this! And I cleaned my room, right? And I’m eating better now. This is as good as it gets, man. At least until I get you back.”
“I know I said I’d be here when you’re ready and I still stand by that,” Dean says, getting right to it. “But that doesn’t mean I can’t keep askin’, right? I can still tell you how much I want you to come back. Even just to talk. Even if you don’t want to actually show up here, just talk to me again, man. I need you.”
Because that’s what’s happening here, isn’t it? It’s sickening to realize that this feels familiar. Cas is keeping something from Dean. Again.
“Why now? And why did you let it get like that?”
“So yeah. I’m looking forward to it. No pressure, just… You know, I thought you should know that I’m looking forward to it.”
Dean wants to say something clever, or at least something normal, but he’s got nothing. And now that there’s no pressure of a line behind him, Dean is just kind of stuck there on the spot, staring. He really likes Amal’s earrings.
It’s cool, Dean’s not suffering for it. He’s thriving, really, watching Cas process this turn of events that will bring them into physical contact. He understands now what Cas had meant about different moments. He can’t wait for Cas to take his hand, but he also really loves waiting. It’s a squirmy, happy paradox deep in the center of him, warming him up from the inside.
Dean can practically hear the gears turning in Cas’ head.
Part of Dean wants to smooth it over and move on, but he doesn’t let himself. If they’re going to examine Cas’s misunderstanding of Dean’s feelings, it’s only fair they do it in reverse as well. Because shit, Dean had really misunderstood Cas. For a long time, for as long as he’s known him - he misunderstood his feelings, misconstrued his actions, and misidentified his motives. He’d missed this; they’d missed each other, passed right by, too wrapped up in their own issues to see the other clearly. Dean is planting them firmly face-to-face now, holding them in place so they can’t look away from each other. They’ll drag their mutual misconceptions into the open and prod at them until they crumble into dust. As difficult as that may be.
himself right now. Why is he still here? Why isn’t he just sinking into the floor already?
“Yeah, I mean. A few.  A—a few times.”
can it be possible that this guy—who Dean feels as though he’s struggling to maintain hold of even just in friendship—how can this guy be
Dean quickly looked back up at Cas. His eyes were calm, compassionate, and inviting. Dean felt this growing feeling rising throughout his body, it wasn’t anything bad, it was warm, he couldn’t explain it… Then Cas’s hands reached up to cup Deans face. Dean fully leaned in and grabbed hold of Cas’s waist. At that moment it felt like Dean’s heart stopped beating.
He couldn’t wait as he and lightly pushed Cas onto the blankets on the ground.
“You’re fucking incredible you know that right?” Cas said as he breathed rapidly while placing another kiss on his neck.
“So, spill angel.” Dean held Cas closer.
“Let’s do it.”
“Alright, Alright, we’ll get working,” He grins as he stands up, “Just letting you know now one better than me.”
“Yeah, yeah, keep talking and you’ll regret it Winchester,” Benny pointed towards him.
Sam got a look at Cas neck before he left and saw an identical mark on Dean just a few minutes ago. Cas walked by him then he noticed it, one of Dean's flannel shirts underneath Cas trench coat. When he left he wasn’t heading towards Dean's room he was heading towards the bathroom
Cas alighted himself as he placed one hand by his head and he placed a small kiss on Cas wrist while he slowly slid his length into him. Erupting a hiss from him then easing into a low wanting moan. Cas immediately stopped letting him adjust, but he couldn’t wait anymore, he wrapped his legs around Cas legs and back, “I need you now,” He whispered seductively to Cas staring into his blue eyes.
Dean lifted his leg on to Cas waist as he was feeling extremely needy. Cas started running his hand along his upper thigh. Dean quickly started hanging his arm around Cas’s neck as he leaned closer feeling nothing but chills run along his entire body. He started to feel Cas’s cock getting harder and it was driving him crazy as he whispered back, “I won’t make it… Cas… I need you.”
“Me? You damn incredible, I love you so much,” Dean says as he sucks a bruise on Cas neck preferably lower because he teacher. Although he wouldn’t mind taking just a little higher to show Cas taken. Just in case they didn’t see his wedding ring.
Cas chuckled, “I suppose I can do that.”
Dean and Cas were sitting at a table looking into each others eyes, Dean remembers this memory. Dean was smiling and little bit younger. They sat inside of a bar having lunch together, this was quite a while ago, before they knew Chuck was illustrating their lives. Dean was laughing at a joke he told Cas. while Cas tilted his head as he looked back at Dean. Then they went silent and stared into each other’s eyes.
Benny smiles and pats him on the back, “Don’t worry, I’m sure whatever you planned Cas will like it.”
Dean rolled his eyes as he placed a kiss on Cas's forehead, “That’s why you love me.”
They laughed and held on to each other the whole ride home. They finally found the missing piece that was lost inside of them, they felt whole. Dean couldn’t stop smiling for a week and Cas moved into Dean’s room the same day.
He chuckled then quickly came out of his thoughts as he placed the card beside their picture frame. If he wanted to read some essays he should probably start getting ready now. He quickly took off towards their bathroom to take a shower.
“What was that?” Dean looked at Cas, but nothing was killing this moment at all..
The sunset just over an hour ago. They continued down the road filled with fields and mountains over the horizon. The countryside of Colorado was always great for looking at the stars paired with extraordinary mountains. The cool summer breeze paired with the blanket of stars covering over the planet.
He and Cas walked hand and hand towards the middle of the field coming up on a table and two chairs surrounded by lights and a radio playing softly with candles on the table. As a pile of blankets sat on the ground beside the table.
“What are we doing here?” Cas said as he looked around the field.
Cas started pressing himself even closer as Dean felt him breaching his entrance slowly he placed one arm on Cas neck and the other on the wood with his head facing up towards the sky, silently praying as he bit his lip. As a filthy moan got dragged up out of him as he felt Cas’s other hand cupping his ass just the way he liked it.
him, in a way that Dean had barely even felt comfortable enough to daydream about because he’d always been preoccupied with keeping Cas with
“Uh, I won’t, if you don’t want me to.”
He’s in his car on the side of the road. He’d taken a drive to clear his head, but it’d only fueled his desperation. It's been almost two weeks since Cas went silent.
“Maybe,” Cas says.
Dean carefully places his shirts into his dresser drawer.
“What’s in it? The stew?” Cas asks.
I never would have known it happened. Even now, looking back at our conversations, I have no idea when the other three times could have been.”
“Actually, yeah, it was just me. I mean now that I think about it… He definitely knew about both of us, but near the end he was pretty much just talking to me.”
“Why are you sitting so far away?” he says, deciding not to be apologetic about it. Cas is just gonna have to go with the flow.
Dean strokes Cas’s hand with all his fingers at once, both a hug and a caress.
Cas darts his eyes up to Dean’s face just for a moment before he removes a hand from his beer bottle and reaches out to rest his palm down over Dean’s outstretched fingers, his own fingertips brushing the inside of Dean’s wrist. Cas’s hand is wet from the condensation on the bottle.
“Nobody loves Spam,” Dean says.
“Oh. So she wasn’t—I mean they weren’t a woman?”
“I’m your priority,” Cas repeats back, and there's a sense of absence in his voice, like he’s distracted.
Dean closes his eyes, and for a moment he feels like he used to feel back then. Giddy at the proximity, but ultimately frustrated with himself and his life. Because he’d thought this was the closest he could ever get to Cas.
“Thanks,” Dean says, uselessly. He’s shocked by this admission from Cas, but he’s not surprised. It’s upsetting, but he’s not upset. He’s fighting to keep a smile off his face. “I don’t get it, dude. You knew that I was… I mean, that didn’t clue you in on anything?”
Cas heaves a great sigh.
But that other five percent. That other five percent...
“What?” Dean says. Because, what?
“The bunker. I’m, uh, in my room.”
He gets to this point every single time he prays to Cas. It happens especially fast during the off-weeks, which alternate with the Cas weeks. It’s easier during Cas weeks—he feels more connected to Cas because he’s so focused on looking for a way to save him. He’s more in tune with that part of himself that belongs to Cas. During off-weeks, which Dean only agreed to when Sam threatened to leave if he didn’t take some time to “live his life” in between obsessing over Cas, he feels adrift. He feels guilty that he’s not researching, and he doesn’t get much satisfaction from doing anything else. He waits for Cas week, and he prays to Cas. And Cas can’t hear him. Because he’s still stuck in the Empty while Dean dicks around not saving him.
Dean keeps watching their hands, waiting, but Cas lets go. Cas’ hands rise instead to hold Dean’s face between them, thumbs swiping over his cheek and near his lip like he’s some precious, beloved thing. When he sees Cas’ face, he understands he was waiting for the wrong kind of kiss.
“You said yourself that you haven’t even tried!”
No reason to think otherwise. Dean feels those words like a sword to the sternum. No reason. All these years, he could have given Cas a multitude of reasons. But he never did. All those things he’d wanted to do, that he’d buried because it seemed impossible that anything good would come of it. All those times he half-convinced himself to crawl out onto the bough of expressing his feelings, only to pull himself back at the slightest wobble. All those times he was a coward.
Dean is running out of words to convey just how imperative it has always been for Dean to have Castiel with him. In whatever capacity. If Cas takes just one thing away from this conversation, Dean needs it to be this. Fortunately, Cas looks like he understands, because his face is lit up once again with fondness.
“Hah, yeah, you wouldn’t have. There’s been a few times, with guys, that I’ve been—kinda like that, you know,” Dean rambles, all too aware that this is the closest he’s ever gotten to coming out to anyone. “But this was even worse, because they’re like, really obvious.”
“There you are,” Cas says.
Cas doesn’t seem at all deterred by the silence. In fact, his smile seems to grow even warmer in response to Dean’s internal struggle.
“Nah, I gotta—I’m making dinner for my brother, so. Can’t, sorry.” Dean says. The picture of eloquence.
Dean stops. But what? But it’s not the deal that’s Dean’s fault, it’s the fulfilment of it? It’s the fact that Dean is the reason Cas was able to trigger the deal? And not only that, but he triggered it
He takes the full hamper and brings it to the laundry room.
“No… but—”
Dean knows, he knows, that this is too good to be true. He doesn’t care.
“It’s - it’s not the only reason,” Cas says, averting his eyes.
jealous.
“Uhh, sure seems like you put a lot of thought into—”
Dean feels a pang of disappointment slash through him, and it stings like rejection even though he knows it’s not. The old Dean might have lashed out and made his negative emotions into everyone else’s problem, but he no longer has the inclination. At least, not right now.
Dean finds Cas in his room. The door isn’t even all the way shut. He suddenly realizes how accessible Cas has been this entire time, and he feels like an asshole for staying away for so long.
They both do. God, they both do. Dean still can’t believe it.
“Yeah, of course, man. I know. You’ve told me.”
Normally, Dean is fully aware that he should be saying something, and fully aware that everything would work out better if he did, but he struggles to get his foot out the door. Usually, he can barely open his mouth, let alone allow all
“It’s fine, Dean—”
“I’ve worn underwear in that style. I assume it’s similar?”
“I’ve been wondering what happened to make this possible. Our conversations, I mean,” Cas says, sounding hesitant again. “I’m appreciative, and I’m hoping it’s benign… But it’s concerning to me, not knowing how this happened. It would have taken something very powerful to transform your prayers into two-way communication. Except...”
he’s still having to pry things out of Cas after everything they’ve been through.
He’s never laughing at Dean - he’s always laughing with him. It’s amazing that Cas even wants to do that. Castiel, the angel, wants to laugh with Dean, tease him, make him feel good and put him at ease. Cas loves him. It’ll always come back to that, now.
Yeah. Dean hadn’t really planned this out, like at all. Okay, well. First thing’s first.
“Dean?”
Dean is probably crazy but the emphasis on ‘you’ happens in an even deeper voice than Cas usually uses. It sounds suggestive. Dean knows—he’s 95% sure—that Cas doesn’t mean it to sound that way.
“Okaaay,” Dean says.
Well, shit. He did do that, didn’t he?
“Hmm,” Cas makes a show of saying, clearly not buying it. “How many times, Dean?”
“So did you—I mean, was that on purpose? When you said all that?”
“I’m pretty sure it’s my fault that you’re in the Empty in the first place, Cas,” Dean points out.
“Yeah, I mean, sure. Definitely. Yeah,” Dean says. The idea of his hand anywhere near Cas’ mouth is distracting the hell out of him.
She immediately starts to cry and Dean can hear Cas trying to shush her.  Not sure whether or not he would be welcome, he creeps to the kitchen door and watches as Cas tries to force a spoon with purple liquid into Emma’s mouth.
“Yeah, you couldn’t keep your eyes off me, could ya?” Dean bounced his eyebrows up and down in a way that Cas thought was supposed to be sexy but only made him look silly.  Cas couldn’t help but laugh.
He has survived another tense moment with Cas.  Cas, the man who has spent the last year raising Dean’s daughter, Claire; Cas, the man who has allowed Dean to stay on his property and get to know his 3 year old daughter; Cas, the man whom Dean may want to potentially start building a life with.  Maybe.  If that is something that Cas wants.  Dean’s really too scared to ask him at this point.
“I suppose that is acceptable, then.  I don’t think one cookie will ruin Emma’s dinner,” Cas concedes.  He puts the straw in the kid’s travel cup for Emma.  “Make sure you sip that slowly, now.  It’s going to be warm.  And say thank you to Mr. Dean, Emma.”
When Cas came home on break from college and announced he was pregnant, he was terrified because he didn’t think his big family would understand or would get all protective.  He was surprised and gratified that they wanted to support him by helping out and that they didn’t try to smother him or make him feel less because he didn’t mean to have a pup this early in his life.  His family were lifesavers while he struggled to finish his degree and he has a feeling they would be just as helpful even if he had a partner.  So he does dream about providing brothers and sisters for Emma at some point.  He misses being pregnant and wonders about going through the experience with an alpha next time around.
“Jo, I – I don’t know if I’m okay.”  Castiel took a deep breath and started over.  “Did you know Dean’s manager was a woman?”
“Oh, no that’s…” Castiel stops and takes a deep breath.  “She doesn’t have a father.”  Seeing Dean’s comic disbelief means that Cas will have to explain a little better.  Cas doesn’t want to talk about it
“Yeah, yeah.  I get it. No strippers.”  He winks at Cas as he says this, and Cas knows he’s just joking.  It’s been a long-standing joke between the two of them that if they ever get married, they’re doing a joint bachelor party at a male/female strip club.  “So, uh,” Dean continues, “Am I invited to this party? I mean, I know you haven’t told the partners about me yet, but I’m planning this party so the least they could do is let me enjoy the fruits of my labor?”  Cas hears the sadness in Dean’s voice as he asks. It’s been a point of contention in their relationship since Cas started working at this firm.
“Cas, will you let me..”
Dean has wandered back into Cas’ field of view.  He follows Dean with his eyes until Dean notices and saunters back to the table where Cas is standing, alone for the time being.  Dean looks around before reaching out to Cas and squeezing the hand resting on the table next to an empty rocks glass. Cas smiles and looks down at their hands, quickly squeezes back, and then lowers his hand to his pocket.
“To be honest, Sam, Dean has been doing most of the planning since I haven’t had time to make the calls or oversee the little details.  I don’t know what I would do without his skills in putting these kinds of things together.”  They lapse into silence for a while, the only sound coming from the kitchen where they can hear Dean and Eileen putting leftovers away.
“Well shit, Cas.  I guess you just need to think about your life and then make some decisions about where you want that life to go.  That’s all the advice I think I can give you.”
“I messed up bad, Sam.”  Cas closes his eyes and thinks about that day a month ago when Dean had yelled at him.  Sam stays quiet as Cas continues to collect his thoughts. “The truth is that I essentially dropped this party project in Dean’s lap and walked away.  I didn’t want to do it in the first place and I did my best to avoid responsibility by asking Dean to do all the work for me. I thought if I acquiesced when the partners asked me to plan this party that it might give me a leg up when they decide to elect new partners next year.  I’m not sure that being partner would be worth losing Dean. I mean, that came out wrong. I’m absolutely sure that it wouldn’t be worth losing Dean but I didn’t think that was even an option until last month.” Cas turned the tumbler in his hands as he talked. He looked at Sam and raised his eyebrows.
Cas decides to head for the front of the store and the customer service counter.  Surely she hasn’t left the store and can be paged.  As he turns the corner of the aisle, he sees a man, an Alpha, at the customer service counter holding his daughter.
“If it helps, Balthazar has told me that there is essentially no budget for this party.  You’ve got free reign to do what you see fit. All I ask, if indeed you are going to help me with this, is to please make it a tasteful party.”
“I’m glad you talked me into the brewery, Dean,” Cas admits.  He can’t stop staring at the soft white lights and the way they make the industrial decor of this particular location look so much softer.  There are a few small Christmas trees set up around the large space.
He might be getting ahead of himself, because Cas looks kinda like he’s about to toss this entire conversation aside and drag Dean back to his bedroom. Which is a good look on him, obviously. Really good. Dean considers following that train of thought, but then lets it go. Not the time. They need to understand each other, here. He can’t believe how badly they’d misunderstood each other, and he’ll be damned if he’s just gonna let that keep happening.
“I have never experienced anything like this. Ever. Especially not with a dude,” Dean says. He feels out of his element, too. That’s why Cas was supposed to take charge! (Dean knows that doesn’t make sense, and he doesn’t care).
“No. No, I’m not going to—to beg you to talk to me,” he says. It’s a little better. “I’m good. You just let me know when you’re done with your hissy fit.”
“It does, actually,” Cas replies. He sounds fond, too.
“I can’t wait to touch you, you know—like just. You’re just—I just can’t wait to see you. Not that I’m going anywhere, even if you make me wait. I
Except now here they are. Together, having this remarkably open conversation, with nothing bad on the horizon to distract them from each other. For the foreseeable future. Forever, maybe.
“Yeah, you’re—you’re welcome,” Dean says. Ohh, but he
Dean feels strongly about that. He can’t tell whether he feels good or bad, he just knows it’s intense.
“I really liked talking to you, you know. When I was doing stuff around the house, or out and about. It was like you were always with me, even though you weren’t. But maybe you were more with me than I thought. Were you actually there next to me? I think—I think I could be okay with that. Eventually.”
