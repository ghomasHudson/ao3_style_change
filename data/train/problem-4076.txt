They walked away from the rest, closest to the family portrait, to speak in low voices and barely moving their lips.
“Just your ugly mug”, he said as he looked through the windshield to the field that surrounded the abandoned house, “Those the vics?”, he asked frowning slightly.
“I´m sorry. If I… had been able to make the antidote, probably sooner, but…”, Cas sighed and tried to think, “You´ve had an elixir pretty recently, so another one or a potion won´t make anything go faster. Maybe I can do something with magic to speed it up when I have rested some more… I´m sorry, but I´m not feeling completely recuperated yet. I don’t dare try anything big”
“Yes. I´d like to go to the Wyvernon Forest with you and help you find your brother. I know combat magic, and how to use a blade. I think I could be of great help to your cause”
The mage felt his guard lowering, his own annoyance fading as he gave Dean a compassionate small smile.
Something touched his shoulder, his own name not registering on his ears, and he slashed as he screamed and whirled.
“Well, I had used all my potions, so no problem with those going bad and exploding or something. The bomb was in good shape, as we´ve seen. The rations are gone or ruined. Crossbow and darts are fine, knives too. The rest of my things were in reinforced leather bag inside, those are fine. But this”, he mentioned lifting the bag up, “is useless now”
Cas obeyed, and with Dean´s heat behind him, he looked in all directions. Heavens, anything could be beneath the ferns. Damned giant plants. It was a very good hunting strategy, actually, hiding there. Good hunting grounds…
The creature took the lateral pulse and rolled over the ferns from Dean, who let out a pained sound as the drag of the mandibles leaving his arm tore it up partially.
He blinked in utter surprise. They had locked the garden door with them outside? That made no sense. He yanked harder, unable to even rattle the feeble door on its frame.
“That´s amazing, Samandriel. I would never be able to do that”, he answered earnestly, “You should feel very proud”
“Okay, okay, okay!!”, he caved, closing his eyes, his tears mixing with his sweat and blood. He couldn’t. He really couldn’t resist. It was too much.
Dean tilted to one side as he approached to get his dagger from a wolf´s skull, his pacing almost unfaltering, and got to Cas as he cleaned the blade on his pants.
He was feeling the magic inside the feather in his pocket flicker a bit, warning him its energy would end relatively soon, when he heard a fading echo coming from the forest.
“Bless us, O God, for our food and our drink”, enunciated Naomi with a peaceful voice, “Since you redeemed us and delivered us from evil, we pray to you. Please protect our household, and protect our Lord, who in return protects us, so we can protect those below us. We thank The Lord, and we thank You. Amen”
Everyone was chatting happily, without a care in the world. Together, after rearranging everyone´s schedules and finding a way to get them all there in a glimpse. His mum… was beaming. In her favorite dress and new earrings, surrounded by those she loved.
about. His brother would have given him a warning look if he’d been there. But he hadn’t. He was still stupidly lost in the stupid forest cause his sorry excuse of a brother hadn’t found him yet.
He sat at his desk and rummaged inside his traveling bag, that he ́d left on the ground there. He winced as he took the crystal jar with deadly nightshade blooms, all withered away due to the teleporting. He left it inside a small bin beside his chair and kept taking things out of the bag. Soon enough his desk was filled with parchment documents from the Great Library, as well as his own stack of notes. He took a quill, some ink, shot a glance to the wall clock that ticked calmly beside his room door; and his mind dove into years of investigation, his eyes roaming over different texts.
going to choose this day to finally throw down with Cas, not on his fucking watch. He hurriedly excused himself and started walking over, not too fast so he wouldn’t draw everyone´s attention.
As he passed by the bathroom, its slightly open door allowed to see Charlie dead on the bathtub. Everything was covered in blood.
“Is this an elaborate scheme so that I rest for another night and fully heal?”, he asked suspiciously.
But, he thought peacefully… he knew it was a good presence. Someone warm and sweet, watching over him. He knew he had nothing to fear from it.
Towards the person that observed all around on the far right of the garden, close to a small table with a few chairs, a bit apart from everyone else.
The clearing was right in front of a cave, no doubt the rawhead’s nest. They were kneeling at the mouth of the cave.
The hunter bent a knee and rested an elbow on it, his other hand on the pillow, turning his body towards Cas. His chest was still bare, half-covered in bandages. The posture looked good on him, and he seemed to be aware of it and comfortable about it. Despite his obvious general discomfort, he managed to seem relaxed. He gave the mage a nonchalant smile.
“And I don’t want to, okay?! I´m done! I´m done with everyone only wanting me to read the tablets for them, I´m done, I won´t! I just got kidnapped and tortured exactly for this
Cas, his mouth still wide open, closed it to gulp and nodded, frowning slightly. Dean´s severe gaze still pierced him, and he started to feel uncomfortable- and ashamed.
“Mm, yeah… They can count on me if they have problems, but aside from that… I will reduce the heavenly missions I participate in at will. I´ll have more free time”
Dean laughed to himself and fell silent. He was not done, and he knew he could break through to him.
“Next time, try not to stay down so much”, Dean told him, “You can´t be on the ground, that´s a huge disadvantage. To your feet, as soon as you can”
Cas looked up at Dean, surprised at the out-of-the-blue question. Sam had taken Kevin to his private library, full of fiction and nerdy stuff, to try and find him
still ringing through his mind. He suddenly realized that as he had not seen Cas use his right hand a lot since they got back, and that a part of his mind had found a little strange that he performed his healings with his left hand, as he always acted right-handed. It had looked a bit forced. While laying down, his left hand had been on top of the right one. As someone would protect a wounded limb.
“They are not unkillable, but it can get pretty messy. I wouldn’t like facing two at a time. And we don’t have much time to waste”, Dean explained.
“Of course. Should have thought of that”, his eyes stopped on the lab table, “You did say you were a mage”
“You sure you´re alright?”, Sam asked as they left the dirt track that led to the house and rolled into the pavement of a bigger road.
On one hand, he felt that if his father was not to be on the painting, the rest of the ones that weren´t present anymore shouldn´t be either. It was only fair.
“Of course. There´s no rush”, he said with peaceful sad eyes, “The tablet is not going anywhere. Do whatever you need to do, Kevin”
The mage took his head from his arms, eyebrows raised in surprise. Or… it could have helped. Dean had, after all, just been shown the luxuries of running, hot water. This could play to his advantage.
And then a beautiful punch drove him to the wall. That´s how he discovered there were people downstairs, too.
In case anyone is curious, the current ages of all the present brothers are: Lucifer and Michael- 35, Gabriel- 31, Uriel- 29, Castiel- 27, Samandriel- 22. Again, they might feel a bit too old- but you know, War of Heaven, aftermath... Please bear with me :) Remember that life expectancy of nobles is high, so it´s totally normal not to have a bunch of children by 35 despite this being medieval! xD
“But you are, in so many ways”, Castiel frowned, and he directed a reproachful glance to Sam, “You should cherish your wife more”
His body started to shake, horror taking control of it. Suddenly the air was not enough to breathe, and as he gasped he saw the knife stop just over his skin, tip barely caressing it. His neck strained as he looked down towards it, as he tried to lean back away from it, as he grunted from the spikes on his back biting deeper.
“I mean, man. Sam and me, we´ve done that a bunch of times already. Sacrificing stupidly for one another… But we´ve seen that doesn´t get us anywhere”, he said with a painful wince, “In the Third Trial, we fucking
It took the separate thuds to become a series of increasingly erratic pats for Castiel to understand that Dean did not know how to open the panel door.
Cas had his lips parted in admiration. Indeed, when Holy Fire- Holy Oil set ablaze- burned close to someone infected by The Darkness, it consumed it; given the lightomantic purification properties of the substance. That entailed a very deep understanding of the magic elements. The Darkness had finally been revealed to be the biggest shadowmantic spell that had ever been casted- mixed with some perversed healing magic, plus enough climatemancy to make a storm out of it for swift delivery.
The mage trailed off until he stared confused at nothing for a second. Then raised horrified eyes at Dean.
Desperately turning his head to the ground, one arm still protecting it; he threw his hand down and lashed a push of force directly into the rock.
He heard a small thump on the bathroom door, and he looked at it for a second. Nothing happened. Another thud. Cas frowned slightly. Was that… knocking? Was Dean asking permission to come back?
“I’d guess so, yes. My brothers…”, Cas frowned, eyes lost in the memory, “My mother took me and my younger siblings to the roof, and asked my eldest brothers to end it. The Four Stars fought Zachariah while Uriel and my mother stayed with us. Part of the fight was through illusions, so we missed a lot… since we weren’t affected. But they took him down. And we saw… all of it”, he did not bring himself to say
came when you met someone new. Everyone had learned to bond through trauma, he thought. Five years of war will do that to a society.
The wall opposite the windows displayed a huge family portrait, indirectly illuminated by delicately placed white glowing crystals. Cas could not help but gaze at it for a second. In the center, his mother. She sat royally on a rich ceremonial throne, located at the top of a small staircase. Cas knew it was their Hearing Room, where they received dignitaries from other houses. Around her, standing in different steps of the stairs, her nine children. Fourteen-years-old Cas looked like a baby, all round cheeks and spiky hair. The young mage felt his heart wrench for a second, as it always did when he saw the portrait, mixed feelings flowing over him.
He walked to the sink as he sighed. He tapped gently the runestone that allowed the water to flow and splashed some on his face, washing away the last remnants of sleep and a bit of the panic too. After wiping the last droplets away with a towel, he looked himself in the mirror. He wasn’t pale, unlike the previous day. He got even closer to the surface, leaning forward as he unbuttoned his shirt. He grimaced in slight disgust and rubbed frowning the little spots of black that marked the skin over his heart, but other than that and some weak tendrils that tried to stretch themselves towards his clavicle, it was all gone. Not bad, not bad at all. He could do magic without problems that day- and if he didn´t exert himself too much, it wouldn´t even pile up. He finished undressing.
Castiel walked backwards, his eyes tracking all of the giant wolves in front of him. His right hand was raised up, the light spell dazzling in sparkling radiance; his left extended in front of him, ready for defense. His heart was beating fast, his breathing was panted.
The house was big, an old colonial thing, with a wooden porch with creaking old steps that menaced to give in under their weight. Its windows have been boarded long ago, the wooden planks covered in moss and mold. The years had not been kind on the abandoned structure, and it looked like one of so many haunted houses they had been to in the past.
He could barely remember to finish the scotch and leave the glass on the table before rushing towards his brother, half running. He didn’t want to look like an eager teenager- but damn did he feel like one.
“You have to know, better than anyone, that just one mistake can mean death in…”, Cas started to reason.
“You don’t understand, they are supposed to be extinct!!”, he said in an excited whisper as he started walking towards the flowering bushes, “There have been no reports of hives since Heaven´s War, it was believed that Crowley´s army destroyed them all…”
Dean suddenly grabbed his wrist, fingers of steel, and the mage stopped on his tracks as he snapped his eyes up. The hunter´s gaze was passing over the clearing, searching.
“As long as there’s no connection, no members of the family can become targets”, Castiel explained, “Some of the monsters on the borders, they are intelligent and organized. They could try and blackmail a high operative with the safety of a defenseless child, a baby even. Do you think that would be better?”
The late afternoon was turning a bit chilly, so people had started to retreat to the kitchen. Dean knew without even peeking that they would be playing some sort of board game, or just drinking and talking happily. He would join them soon… but now, he was so peaceful there, just watching the reddening clouds.
The image, branded in fire on his brain: Dean completely naked, half-turned to him, passing a wet towel over his body. Water droplets pearling his muscles. It had just been a second, but not expecting it, not understanding what he was seeing for a moment, had made his mind take it all in. He was not even sure of how much
Joy permeating every cell of his body, Dean hugged her; one hand on her back, the other fondly on her head.
“I guess”, the noble answered as he looked away uncomfortably, feeling very unsuited to deepen in this particular topic of conversation.
Kevin gulped. This was not the first time he had fixed the Word of God, but… Castiel had smashed it, he had said. The pieces had stayed in Heaven. Guarded by angels. Hadn´t they?
His little brother started the ignition, Baby purring in response. Dean winced slightly upon thinking about the hits he had given to the old structure. Luckily nothing had cracked, that he´d realize. Spare parts for a car this vintage were difficult to find.
Then realized that there must have been a reason for Sam not to jump into the flames with them and help them.
After that, not happy about having being caught with his mind wandering twice already, he really tried to follow the rest of the conversations, but it was hard. It did not help at all that his plans regarding Dean made more sense the more he thought about them. His mind wandered over and over towards the hunter; and the excitement for the new ideas he was weaving broke the knot on his stomach… and he suddenly found out that he was actually very hungry. He had, after all, skipped breakfast and lunch. He concentrated on eating and trying to keep track, failing horribly on the second task.
Next time. Holy damn. He should not be doing this, but his mind was already thinking there would be a next time. He shook his head in disbelief. His eyes caught the glimpse of the dagger, which the man still was clutching.  He took it and left it on a nightstand, spared a last glance to the wounded man… and turned around to get to work.
Kevin´s conscience came back to the present. Crowley, having completed the round around his chair, appeared again in his field of vision… holding a sack that sagged with weight. He looked sideways at him… and approached.
But first things first. He shook his head in disappointment and walked two brisk steps to put two fingers to the hunter’s forehead.
now. First, his mind hadn´t been on doctor mode. Second, there had been so much more skin unveiled. Like,
“It´s alright”, Jess finally answered, an awkward smile on her lips, “I´m just not... used to be treated like some kind of… goddess”
The last pieces I need to set before we get into the next part of the story are here. Pay attention, people- everything that appears here is coming back in the future xD At the end of the chapter they finally get to the Forest of Wyvernon!!! However, I´m done apologizing and feeling bad about it having taken this long for them to go. It´s long, yes- it´s a longfic, it happens. It´s how it has to be. This story is about *so much more* than rescuing Sam. You´ll see :)
Dean looked at him for another second, then let out a sigh while he shook his head, anger slipping into disappointment and maybe relief.
“Would be cool cause the trail was just right there…”, Dean continued as Cas didn´t answer right away, “But we either fly, or I walk, man. Period”, he said in a final tone.
The noble followed Dean’s pointing with his gaze. He saw some claw marks on the lower part of the bark.
“Okay, okay, come on”, Dean palmed his arm and passed an arm over his shoulders to help him stand, “Let´s get out of here, and get some rest”
“Maybe for peasants”, he conceded as something ugly twisted in his guts, “But I already told you that the nobility has privileges in exchange for duties. Too many mages died in the War, and keep dying in the borders of the Kingdom. We have an obligation to provide the country with our power. The army needs us, and our descendants. Do you not know this?”, he asked, taken aback.
But that was advanced shit. He smiled at Cas, who looked a bit overwhelmed as he searched the ground.
He had lost his sword in the impact, Impala landing on the forest floor; but since he was being dragged away, it was now out of his reach.
Castiel´s heart wrenched a bit at that. The hunter looked away, but he thought he saw his eyes glint before they were out of sight.
“We were able to ditch them, and we´re hiding now. We don´t wanna hurt them, but they sure look like they wanna hurt
At least a dozen old bodies- vexhounds aside, those were pretty new- laid on the forest floor. They had been dead for days, were partially covered with the falling leaves of late autumn, and critters and flies had gotten to them by now. Sammy had obviously found the nest and fought the creatures- alone.
“Oh, shit”, he made a pained gesture, taking his hand to his stomach, but his smile never died, “Oh, man”, he said, still chuckling, “Do you think I´m gonna hit on you just for that?”
When he looked back at the hunter, he was smirking a bit and raising the little potion bottle on his hand, wiggling it a little between his fingers.
, and he would have no other chance. So he gulped as he slowly, doubtfully, raised his hand to… take it closer… to the glass…
That, for some reason, relaxed Cas´s shoulders. Dean chuckled in delight, and finally Castiel smiled a bit too.
The mage backed back a step, gulping. The anger on Dean´s face seemed barely contained. He didn’t think he´d attack him- but
Dean gritted his teeth, accelerating his pace. He had to stop the confrontation before it happened, before it ruined everyone´s spirits…
He honestly believed that if someone had been lost in those woods for a week, he was dead and long eaten by now... but he was not going to tell that to his nervous patient.
him to go away. To not talk about this, to not remind him what had just happened and been said, to let him bury himself in his work and hold on to it for dear life.
“Do you think Michael will lead the house, then?”, asked Cas frowning- to his knowledge, that hadn´t been settled yet.
- iShip for all her wonderful knowledge about healing plants. Cas´s alchemy skills would suck without you xD
“Clear”, he answered solemnly, and while Dean’s shoulders relaxed a bit, he made an awkward smile, “I guess I ought to practice following orders too, or else I will make a very lousy soldier”
Lucifer pressed his lips, apparently unhappy, and looked away. And before Castiel´s eyes, he… shrank a little.
“Apparently so”, Sam said, then his eyes turned to one side as he listened to the phone, and briefly chuckled with a small smile to something Cas had said.
. And for now, he had not done a bad job, to Castiel’s eyes. The population had grown a bit, cities were rebuilt, funds had been dispatched to the most damaged places. The duties of nobility were established to protect the population, and peace had come back to stay.
“I´m gonna have to get back to you on that offer, Cas”, the old hunter said, smiling to the garden, “I´m starting to think I could retire”, John looked sideways at Dean, “Now that Dean has found a good hunting partner, he might not need me around that much”
In those confusing instants the tentacles had strengthened their grip on Sam and Kevin, who started to emit suffocated screams; and some had curled up Cas´s arms as he extended them towards the prophet and his brother.
, he told himself, and with a deep breath he forced himself to let go of the cape. Dean wasn´t looking anyway…
“I bet they have tried to get Uriel involved, too”, Castiel muttered, looking covertly to his brooding, silent sibling, “And I thought I was not powerful enough to matter. Do you think they´ll try to get Samandriel, too?”
It was huge and beautiful, remarkably healthy, its deep green shining as in joy. He wished for a moment he could take a specimen home, keep it in his room or in the gardens- but he knew it would not survive long in the Spire grounds.
Kevin looked around in confusion… he couldn’t move his head a lot. He was tied to a sturdy chair that had built-in straps that trapped his ankles and wrists… and something metallic was strapped to his forehead.
But as he tried to walk forward, the world tilted, and suddenly his hands were holding up the floor. Or he was holding himself on his knees. He wasn´t sure.
“Yeah”, Cas mumbled, stepping back, “So, you eat. The message is on its way. I´ll have dinner while you eat. Get some rest. I hope we can have an answer when dinner is over”
The hunter closed his eyes again with a sigh, and in moments his breathing became deeper and slower. Cas took a deep breath that he let go in a sigh... crisis averted. Then he looked over his shoulder to his notes... and calmly walked to them to start organizing them in some nearby shelves.
He saw Dean´s naked back and uncomfortably thought it would be better to contemplate his privileges after he´d taken proper care of his guest.
His eyes were wide, panic on his face. Why had he said that? He had intended to assure Dean he would not condemn him for something that as a doctor he knew was natural and innocuous, that if he was attracted to men it was obvious he wouldn´t be an illiterate homophobe; but instead he had just… blurted out…
He approached with business-like manners to the center of it, the proper workspace, and stared into the mid-distance to organize his thoughts. He needed a healing elixir. Something not magically charged, something that helped him heal without corrupting him. But not too slow, or he wouldn’t make it. Not too strong. Not too weak. Calculus started forming in his mind, until he nodded and got to work.
As they advanced, the ground became more humid, sometimes squelching beneath their boots. It kept growing until they got to a stream, before which Dean stopped, raising an arm to halt Cas.
, and no matter how new an experience that had been, he deserved respect, and Cas couldn´t think of things like that and he knew it.
He knew he had made her day, surprising her like that. The smile on her face illuminated the whole room. His heart was about to explode.
, he thought; pinned on the floor he was going to be able to do very little. He covered his face with his arms, protecting himself from some hits, then suddenly ducked Dean on the chin. They got arms on each other, grasping on their clothing, tussling on the floor.
Suddenly there was warmth, softer light, familiar smells… but the weight and growling still remained.
I am particularly proud of all the twins-drama between Lucifer and Michael! All the "haha who will lead the family" that starts the feud between them. Also, the Four Stars thing... its just to explain why the archangels have a vastly bigger amount of power than Cas and the rest of the an... nobles of the Mighty family xD. But the difference in power between the first four descendants and the rest, and how power diminishes as people have kids, is canon in all of the 4 noble families in the realm.
As Cas put his hands on his knees, getting his breath back, Dean looked at the monsters. The endrega rumbled, legs still moving, its rage giving it even more strength, vines ripping everywhere. The hunter slowly raised his eyebrows, face relaxing into the beginnings of an… unbelieving smile.
“Look, I… I know what you said, about not intervening. Hands off the world- and man, that’s fan-freaking-tastic. Really happy about that. We got more than enough meddling till now. But… This is probably against all that…”
He was going to jump over the dead wolf when he stared at it for a second. God, it was disgusting to have that there. He sighed. He could not leave before Gadreel returned with the food for Dean, anyway. He frowned for a second, thinking.
“Dear Lord, let me see”, the mage said with a worried frown as he put his palms on his abdomen and back, surrounding the penetrated area, and closed his eyes.
“So this is what´s going to happen: instead of staying here exchanging girly kicks with you so you give the boys time to rescue Kev, I am going to leave you here… while every creature I have at my disposal rips you apart. You know, they are very dedicated. Some would say, they would jump through fire for me”
Now, about today´s story- bit of a long chapter, but we are getting into *important passages* with important details, and we are finally getting to the pieces that are gonna hold the very center of the fic. I first visualized this in October, and finally in March we are getting there. I am so happy ^^ (People, don´t ever write longfics if you can´t deal with waiting and frustration- trust me! xD)
The mage looked at Dean, not understanding what he meant at all. How would he know? That… was the whole hunting strategy of the lignarium.
The angel huffed out a little laugh as his smile turned a bit embarrassed. The beer bottle that hung from his hand between his knees had like two fingers of beer still inside, surely warm after hours of being carried around.
Then Jack shifted his eyes to Dean, smiling slightly… and for a moment, he just looked like the gawky kid he had taught how to drive, how to fish. Dean understood. He wanted to help him, but he wanted to be fair too.
“Well, you know we´re hunters, right?”, Cas nodded at that, “He was following a lead. Some kids have been getting missing in different villages that are all close to the Forest of Wyvernon. Lotta kids. Like, more than ten”
The mage, in a panic, turned and tried to hold on to the passing plants, letting go completely of his blade. He was suddenly somehow gripping for dear life to a bunch of fern leaves, and the pull of the vines on him made him lift up from the ground. He grunted in pain as they dug into his muscles.
“I´m gonna have to heal these”, he said opening his arms a bit, kinda pointing at, well, his whole self, “So I guess I´m… going to pass out for a bit”
Wow, guys. This conversation was the first thing I ever wrote of this fic, the whole worldbuilding is here. The chronology was SO HARD. I tried to adjust it to canon as much as possible, but some changes had to be made, I'll explain them in the end notes. It has ended SUPER LONG, I mean, in normal circumstances I would have cropped it into two chapters- but this couldnt be split. So.... double-length chapteeeeer!
“I remembered you liked it, boy. Called it the best scotch you´d ever had. So I bought it in case something special happened”
“I´d advice to put the repellent on as we get on the field, since its effect doesn´t last long”, Cas added, “We will have to apply it several times over the day”
Dean jumped on his seat as Cas hissed in pain, suddenly sitting up, his left hand flying to his elbow and his face contorted in a pained expression, teeth bared and grinding.
A small silence ensued. Castiel was frowning so hard that Dean could almost see the wheels turning in his head, trying to figure out what was happening exactly. He felt the exact same way. John was tense but tried to hide it, hands in his pockets, lazy look gliding over the garden, the sky, the floor- anywhere but the angel.
“No. I want to because it’s the right thing to do. I have more power than others, so it should be used to protect those who can’t protect themselves. I can change things, I can help. So, I want to. I was helped when I needed it, when I got sick. It’s the right thing to do”
“And everyone that gets into the Warriors of Heaven has his memories erased?”, he asked in disbelief.
“Look at him…”, another of the Gabriels was whispering to his neighbor, eyes on the first Gabriel that had talked.
“I… see”, Cas said pensively, but he felt he didn´t understand yet, “What about… population growth? Wouldn´t… homosexuality get in the way of that?”
“Yeah”, the peasant snorted, “Most on eternal leave due to nobility obligations or war calls. And the rest charge a pretty penny for a simple visit”
At the end of their second day hunting together, Dean and Cas found Sam's trail. Dean suggested celebrating it, and they both talked and drinked together, but when Dean adresses in horror the subject of Castiel's arranged marriage, the mage is clearly offended and angry. They both go to bed with things tenser than ever.
Dean followed with his eyes the movement of his hand towards his forehead, and while the healer sent his awareness into his body for a second, he stared into his face with a guarded fascination. The mage smiled slightly upon what he felt.
Shoot. The message. Cas blinked for a second before nodding. He rushed to his desk and took a quill to start scribbling rapidly on a piece of parchment.
“Yeah, man! We got Sammy’s trail back!”, the hunter’s eyes were gleaming, “Do you know how fucked up it would have been if we hadn’t? We could have searched for him for a
And he had jumped from the bed and gotten two steps away, almost tripping in his trepidation, while color rose to heat his cheeks.
The hunter stopped and turned, a murderous scowl still on his face. Cas was looking at him with a sad frown. Still panting in anger, Dean maintained his gaze.
He retreated, putting distance between him and the monster. The image got unfocused for a second. Panting, he blinked several times, trying to steady his gaze.
“Castiel…”, said his big brother with a leering smile, enjoying every syllable, “Just the man I wanted to see”
“Thank you for your company, my children”, Naomi announced finally, “Please, give me a moment with your two eldest brothers. There are matters that we need to discuss”
“Yeah. He took me and Sam with him, left us in a safe place when he had to take down something, then we moved on. He taught Sammy and me everything he knew. Some time later, he gave me his sword”
“… because their honey and beeswax, are richer in biomantic particles than any other known substance, and the rebellion was using them to heal their troops, it was a cheap and they were everywhere…”, Cas continued in his most excited tone.
dropped his beer. He´d remember that! He would. Where had that idea come from? His stomach tightened again, cold fear sipping into his veins.
“I´m just an angel. Just another angel, another soldier. I have always been ready to die for a righteous mission, Dean. Nothing has changed”
“You climb up, find a big ass branch- real strong, like your torso at least- and you lie down. Tie yourself to it so you don’t fall off overnight. Keeps you out of the way of passing midnight snackers, and it even hides you if its wide enough”
. He grabbed his head and violently crashed it into his unhurt knee. His enemy groaned and fell to his knees, dizzy. The hunter bent down to entangle his fingers on that stupid long hair, and grabbed it to smack his face into the stone floor. Dean heard him cry out as he felt the satisfying crunch of a nose being broken, and he smiled.
Two huge things prowled up ahead. They looked very much like scorpions. Longer than they were tall, they had segmented bodies covered in a hardened blue and brown shell; with eight articulated legs. Their tails, however, ended up in an engrossed mass of spikes.
“No, wait!! I really don’t know what it means, just…! It´s not clear, or I can´t make sense of it…!”
The mage nodded, stunned, before realizing he was still gaping- he closed his lips, licking them with still his eyes wide open.
Castiel should have known. Ambriosia was not for peasants. He made a wry sigh as he closed his eyes. He was not prone to anger. Rage had left a hollow feeling behind. He knew that the hunter could not be completely accountable for his words if he was intoxicated.
“Oh, I´m sorry”, Dean said with acid irony, “I guess next time something´s eating you alive, I will just lay back and enjoy the show”
Sam instantly got to his feet, getting to his weapons as he moved; blade in one hand, pistol on the other. Dean bobbed his head to where he had seen whatever it had been. His eyes scanned the shadows intently, his heart racing. Adrenaline pumped through his veins in a rush.
He blinked at Dean for a second, who looked at him as if he was talking nonsense. Then Cas opened his lips slightly. Of course… Peasants did not have the money to afford such luxuries. Dean had probably only seen bathtubs until now.
, you stupid little shit. And we´ve lost too many already!”, he bellowed, pointing to the general direction of the door, “We lost mum. We lost dad. And Ellen, and Jo. We lost freaking
As the first opened its jaws to attack him, he shot a palm out screaming, force pushing them several feet in the air. A wave of dizziness made him groan and shut his eyes for a second. His head
Then he could not prevent the pain to escape his grip. To escape his heart, his throat, to get to his face, twisting it, as tears escaped his fiercely closed eyes, as his jaw screamed from the pressure, his chest pure fire. His knuckles popped as he balled his fists, as he put his arms on the dashboard, leaning forward, doubling in agony. He painfully held his breath, trying to remain in control, but it was useless. Tears escaped his tight eyelids.
“Do I really have to remind you of the dangers of a wound being infected or poisoned?”, said Castiel, a note of frustration in his voice.
The angel gritted his teeth upon the sight- there was nothing left to save in the flames. He stood unmoving for a second, eyes broken in horror, in impotence, teary gaze locked on the people he hadn’t been able to save.
“What´s up with this wing fetish?”, complained the hunter, taking the blade from the ground and helping the angel up.
He felt his cheeks flush. His… mind really couldn’t recall all of Dean´s nakedness. He was too embarrassed, it was too inappropriate. But… his chest though, he´d seen it several times now, and as Dean had said… the important bits were covered. That was okay… at least it was not so bad? His chest, and strong shoulders, and…
He trailed off as he saw Gadreel look behind him, mouth agape. He whirled, afraid he´d seen Dean… but the servant was looking wide-eyed in horror to the huge wolf dead on the floor. He looked back at the servant forcing a smile.
“I could contact the forest rangers that guard the forest limits. Ask them if there is any rawhead nest known. With the resources my family has, the answer would get to us in a very quick fashion”
After facing several monsters, Dean and Cas continue their journey through the Doomed Forest of Wyvernon, searching for signs of Sam´s presence.
“I have work to do”, he interrupted in a severe tone without looking at the hunter, “Go to sleep, or you’ll get a headache”
“Hey”, Gabriel said soflty as he put a hand on his shoulder, “If you promise that if you need help, if you
Im just realizing a big chunk of this fic is Dean suffering. Im gonna go add more tags in relation to that xD
A hand surged from behind the bed giving him a thumbs-up. Cas shook his head and tried not to laugh as someone knocked on the door.
“I´m sorry, Kevin”, he said in a very calm voice, “You´re right. We got ahead of ourselves, and… we didn’t think about what all of this means for you. You… don´t have to read them if you don´t want to. We certainly aren´t making you read them”
“I got you, I got you! Hnng!”, he grunted as the centipede reached him anyway, and he stopped its clacking mandibles with his sword.
“Let me phrase this differently”, he added in a softer tone, a bit more seriously, “He´s not going anywhere. So you best get used to him, okay? And if you gave him one chance, one frigging chance… I´d be very damned grateful”
Another silence fell. Cas, longing to stop feeling so uncomfortable and eager to change the subject, tried to smile and continue talking.
They all started looking around… and locking eyes with them. Twenty, twenty-five? A rage in their eyes that was turning murderous by the second. They started raising.
“Whatever”, he grumbled, getting his legs inside the car, grunting in pain and relishing its burn for a second, as it took his mind away from the one in his heart.
And Dean had to grind his teeth to be patient, but he let him. Cause he knew that if he didn’t allow Cas to heal him, the mage wouldn’t stop fidgeting and worrying and
When I first started this fanfic, it was gonna be very silly. I was gonna use as many stupid tropes I could, romantic comedy stuff... but then the plot grew and it became really serious. But this, I did not want to lose: I thought of the scene of Cas finding Dean naked in his room very early on, like, it was one of the first things I came up to as I planned the fanfic. So here it is xDDD
“Hey. How´re you holding up?”, his brother asked him lightly, faking less concern than he obviously felt.
“Thank you”, she said with a small smile, and turned towards the end of the table, smile widening, “Samandriel, my youngest. How are your studies progressing?”
Right when it seemed Crowley’s defeat was nigh, the Darkness was unleashed. A huge storm of black fog had washed over the kingdom, and when that fog got into a body, it ended up controlling it and making it act in a very similar way to War. Violent and merciless, immune to pain, until the bodies simply dropped dead.
He tightened his jaw, balled his hands into fists, and started running towards the plant. His sprint triggered the endrega to the chase.
Crowley stood confused for a second, obviously having expected holy water or something similarly menacing, registering what had happened.
Castiel blinked surprised as he got to him and passed an arm over his shoulders, to push him gently and make him walk alongside him.
“Wait, what…? Hey!”, he protested as Crowley untied his right hand, he tried to avoid the sack as soon as he could move it, “No…!”
“I know where we came from, I remember the path we were taking. Also, midday has passed. You know the sun sets in the west, right?”
Sam and Dean had to be looking for him. They would be coming. They would save him. He couldn’t give Crowley this power. He…
“Maybe we can give this a try. And maybe, someday… I can say it back to you with the same certainty you said it to me”
“Their identities have not transpired yet”, said Naomi in a calm voice, fork and knife cutting delicately into the venison steak on her plate, “But I wanted to warn you. Some of you might receive a letter soon, and I wanted you to be prepared”
“It´s nothing, man, I´m just curious. Don´t sweat it”, chuckled Dean as he reached for the glass of water.
“Once again”, Dean said, looking down at Cas intensely, “You take us there. No monsters, peachy; we get the sword, we get going. Monsters: defense. Do
Whatever had latched onto him was propelled away, ripping part of his shoulder in the movement. The mage barely registered the pain as he scrambled to his feet, but could run only a step before something latched strong jaws on his leg and made his knees buckle. Something hit his back as he landed on his hands, and a huge weight tackled his body to the forest floor. He was able to cover his head with his arms before something would rip his head off his shoulders.
“Yeah. See, apparently there´s something blasphemous in ghouls, given they feed off the dead of those that deserve their holy rest… So angel blades hurt them a lot. You can also identify if someone you´re talking to is a ghoul in disguise by touching them with it, even if it’s the handle. It´s something in the material they´re made of”
When the hunter looked back at the mage, he seemed frustrated, angry even. His shoulders were tense, his jaw tight.
“Thanks a bunch for blinking everything here”, he said with fond eyes, “My mum couldn’t believe what she was seeing”
“As I see it, man”, he declared with a little chuckle, his green eyes sparkling, “you fucking earned it”
Castiel blinked at him, utterly surprised. His brother was… actually dropping the games, and talking seriously for a change.
A few minutes later, Dean was leaning against the dashboard, forehead on his arms, eyes closed. It had been a little while since he rubbed his hand over his face, drying the tears, and just… started leaning there, exhausted. Physical violence was always a very effective outlet for rage, so that was over quickly. All that was left now was sorrow, regret, guilt. Deeper shit.
He walked into the shower and waited till Dean popped his head inside, looking around with a guarded frown of incomprehension. Cas was standing over a metal rack set on the floor, and he pointed to the symbols engraved in the far end wall.
“I hear”, John kind of sighed as his eyes roamed the whole garden, “that you have taken good care of my boys one time or two”
Castiel´s mind clicked, understanding what Dean was implying, what he was understanding; and he made a startled babble as his face flushed furiously.
He took a deep breath. This was not the first person he healed, but it had not been necessary to remove that much clothing in other cases. He thought of how much chastity was reinforced upon nobility; how his own clothes tugged at his neck, wrists and ankles, leaving so little to be seen. He was aware that the last time he had seen so much skin together had been when he had been very little, amongst his male brothers. He thought of his teenage years, clenching his jaw and gulping slightly.
for you to do anything, to say anything… that you don´t want to, that you´re not sure of, of that you are not comfortable with. I´ve had years to come to terms with this. Take your time to figure out what you want, and when you want it. I have waited a long time, and just loving you, and being by your side, it´s more than enough for me. And I will wait as long as it´s needed for us to be sure that you are happy along this new path”
He couldn’t take it anymore. Without any kind of warning, he got his arm from behind his back, holding a little jewelry box.
I had trouble coming up with the title but when it became Beautiful Nightmare I went back to change the last chapter´s name (from "Sweet Dreams" to "Sweet Dream") so they both became one pack of "Sweet Dream and Beautiful Nightmare", inspired by Beyonce´s song. That I have heard a long time ago but I relistened to, and realized that it was A HELL OF A SOUNDTRACK for this entire fic- especially when Dean´s *AHEM* erotic dreams start.
know that most of them were assholes, and he will probably do better without them. But… the change must be hard. So maybe yeah, an angel out of Heaven- maybe he may feel he has to compensate in some way. Or maybe he just, I don´t know. Wants to prove he can be still a warrior of goodness. Or he just… doesn´t wanna lose us too”
He saw how the hunter was throwing something towards the creature that approached him, another bomb?, and a cloud of smoke surrounded the monster. For a second Cas couldn’t see around the creature and Dean, but a moment later the hunter ran out of the smoke cloud. He had used the distraction to cut himself free. He took the Impala from the ground in time to turn and see his enemy emerge from the already dissipating cloud of smoke, shaking its head.
Dean had tried to get to all fours, but as soon as he moved his left leg he aborted the attempt, the pain of his knee quadrupling. He clamped a hand over it, hissing.
“Come on, I said I´d try, just give me a chance”, he jokingly continued, chuckling as he tried to catch more tears.
All of the beasts snapped their heads back to him, and even Dean stopped for a second to shoot a wide-eyed look at him. He had no time to further register the hunter´s reaction, because suddenly the creatures had spread widely around him.
He seemed to consider the assessment and he then took two long swallows of water. Cas extended his hand to get the glass back and left it on the closest nightstand.
Apparently, it was. It really was like that. Nobles were required to have children regardless of… everything.
“I don´t know!”, he snapped, he was terrified, “I don´t wanna give you false hopes, man, I really don’t, but I just can´t… I can´t…”
“No. I can sense where the damage is, and send my magic specifically to that spot. I direct the energy exactly to the place it is needed, to do exactly the actions needed. I will not close an external wound if that means internal bleeding, for example; whereas the effect of a potion is much more unspecific. That’s the same reason why a potion Corrupts a deal more intensely than a healing spell, the focus. The more skilled the healer, the less Corruption he or she creates, and the finer the medical work is…”
As he crossed the frontier that the treetops formed, lion-like roars from the creatures traveled to him; but also a cry of challenge, and… the guttural whine of a beast being hurt.
The new recipe lay beside his hand, on the wooden table, and a bunch of ingredients had been set neatly across the surface. Everything he needed… except for one key element.
devoted and all-filling way that you… love”, he stammered, “Someone that can tell you all kind of pretty, meaningful things like what you said to me, with the certainty of having their fucking heart behind their words. But I´m not there. I´ve got this, weird limbo of what-the-fuck inside my chest, and I don’t know how to fix it. And I´ve tried, man!”, he complained out loud, “I´ve, I´ve spend the past few days going over and over all of this, and all our past, and all I´ve ever felt, and I just… don´t know anything anymore”
He shook his head, shame climbing up his neck to make his ears buzz. If he had woken up at that moment, it would have been
Then he released it, and the wave of pain that hit his brain made him arch his neck. He moaned and scrunched his eyes, teeth gritting.
The Road So Far: Dean has stayed in Castiel´s room for a couple of days, as he recovered from his wounds. He´s not totally healed yet, and Castiel cannot heal him with the lingering Corruption still in him- but he´s impatient to start looking for Sam already. Right before the mage took him back to Wyvernon Forest, Cas had to go to dinner with his family. There, he has an idea regarding Dean and his immediate future. However... he finds him naked when he gets back to his room.
“You know, I think we started on the wrong foot this morning, nobleman”, he tilted his head in an inviting way, “Wanna try it again?”
”, Dean pointed at him with fury rising again, “you went and thought of going all suicide mission. Not dying on the job- hell, I can get that. I get the mindset of
Regarding Castiel's brothers: in the present Samandriel's 22, Cas is 27, Uriel's 29, Gabriel's 31 and Lucifer and Michael are 35. Zachariah died in the first plague when he was 9 (he was 3 years older than Cas). As you know, there were more siblings that are not here any longer. You will learn more about them in the future :)
”, the hunter argued, giving his voice a grandiose tone, “and you’re out there with your troopmates and you gotta eat, you’re not gonna kill a damned bunny to feed´em?”, he chuckled.
Him? He could not cross it, at all. Not only that, his Grace was being severely dampened. He wouldn’t be able to heal himself, nor use it much in the battle. He would tire fast. He was already feeling a little sick.
But he didn´t say a word. Dean had sternly told him that the second he slowed him down, he would ditch him. So he kept on pushing.
So he was so absorbed in his work that he did not realize how long he´d been studying until it was too late.
His brother was a biomancer. Life magic allowed biomancers to be in total tune with nature. Making plants grow, communicating with animals, and controlling life matter at will. Gabriel could transform someone else, or even himself, into an animal, or into another completely different person.
“Know what this means?”, he asked the mage, eagerness on his features, “If he stopped here to crash, but we don’t stop?”
“I saw”, Dean smiled at him wickedly from below, “Totally unintended, but man, totally worth it. Your face…”, he snickered as he grinned.
The angel smiled, and so did he. Maybe he didn’t know exactly where his heart was going, but every certainty he could, he would give it to him.
“You know”, Cas said in a steady, soft voice, “that if you left right now, it would be because of guilt. Because you feel you´ve wasted too much time, and wanted to compensate”
of the young ones”, muttered one of the Gabriels, shaking his head in disappointment, arms crossed on his chest.
Also, something I feel kinda guilty about xD I think I heard/read somewhere that since brain does not have nerve endings, if you hurt it directly you can´t feel pain. So the bit about "putting a spike through the part of your brain that processes pain for torture" its a bit of an artistic license xD Or maybe Crowley knows but is just making a damn good intimidation!
The hunter imposed on them the quickest pace they could manage given the treacherous footing, and the whole time his eyes never stopped raking over the ground, the trunks, the bushes. Castiel reminded him soon that they had to reapply the repellent, and Dean put it on with no more complaint nor delay than a disgusted wrinkled nose. They quickly resumed their walking.
Dean´s sword stopped an attack, furiously deflected another one, and a strong slash delivered with a roar severed one of those frontal legs. He immediately jumped back, rolling through the ground, ready for the second endrega. He had to attack and roll, never stop running, never stop watching both creatures at once. He dodged another attack, sprinted to get behind the second creature and delivered an attack to its rear. The creature´s tail slashed, lighting fast, and hit Dean in the stomach; the hunter took several steps back, a hand to his middle, doubling over. The protections on his chest seemed to have stopped the spikes, but the blunt impact landed anyway. Both endregas turned towards him during the second he took to look up at them through a pained expression, panting.
At his side, Cas wobbled for a second and panted while blinking, killing his joy a bit. Was he too tired for a second trip?
The second they moved, Dean threw the mother of all punches towards his chin, he felt how his teeth clacked before the guy staggered backwards.
“Thank you, Gadreel”, Cas said in a polite smile as he opened and saw the servant with his food tray.
The mage’s eyebrows raised a bit in surprise… Then a pleased smile spread on his face as he looked away, towards the cauldron again.
His head suddenly flew, rolling onto the ground as the body fell, Dean behind him, a pant leg still on fire.
“This is fingerite, a copper vanadate mineral. Dean told me you collect minerals. We… tried to think of one you might not have”
He walked to a little string that hung close to the bed and then got inside a hole in the wall. He pulled from it, and in some place outside, a little bell rang.
“Y-yeah… I t-think so. B-but holy crap. Holy shit, what was that?”, he said with a note of panic on his voice.
“I know that you are important. As much as Sam or me. You are not… less important. And… you don´t need the other angels. They turned their backs on you, well that´s
His first instinct was to tell him it hadn’t been important, that he´d been too out of it. But he knew his brother would moll this over until it was round as a pebblestone, so he grunted out a small sigh.
Cas took a hand to his shoulder. He felt no wound, and no pain. Extended his arms in front of him. The wounds were gone, although not the blood stains.
Dean could not help the little smile that appeared on his face. More at Castiel’s efforts than the pie mention. Absolutely. He was not such a pie slut.
Dean, who had been scanning the room for some reason, shifted his gaze to the mage, a mix of confusion and surprise in his features.
Dean’s voice died down, his gaze getting lost for a second, as if he had remembered something. His small, relaxed smile slowly melted into a serious pensive expression. His eyes moved down with a slight frown before he turned his head to look longingly towards the forest, in the direction he had pointed they had to follow.
The mage deadpanned at him. For a second, dismay had taken over him, realizing that Dean was talking about going hunting again
The day had progressed through merry and laughter. Charlie had asked Dean to participate in a little friendly softcombat tournament with Jo and Cas, and though the angel had politely declined, John had shown some interest. That had led to some smiling dares, and had ended up with Dean facing his dad with foam swords on their hands. The fight had been witnessed and cheered by everyone, Bobby and Ellen even placing bets. Dean had won, if barely, thanks to a technique Charlie had taught him long ago. As he lifted his father from the ground through a tight grip, his old man had smiled proudly at him, telling him that
Castiel woke up to the sound of flames crackling. Everything around him was warm, comfortable, clean, and wonderful- yet some pressing feeling nagged him and urged him to open his eyes.
Cas yelped and fell back, eyes wide, looked up… and saw nothing. Where was it? His eyes searched wildly, he had seen something brown, or gray, and what seemed like a…  A blade of some…?
“Tell me where you are, I will help you”, Castiel asked in a tone that was half protest, half ominous order.
“You go around healing everyone’s boo-boos all the time?”, the hunter asked, as if that notion was preposterous.
“Stop it, you´re gonna reopen…”, Cas complained, leaving the bowl in the nightstand and leaning his hands onto him.
“Only that nobody cares what I think, and that I do not count on family decisions”, Cas said smiling jokingly.
Funny fact- I honestly put that tentacle thing at the end of chapter 2 just because I liked it. However, now I gotta explain where it comes from, lol xD Since Im one of those writers that will edit till the end of time, Ive made a promise to myself for this story: whatever is published here cant be changed. So between that and that no matter how many times Ive envisioned a scene, when I write it the characters just do whatever they want... I´ll just work through it?? Its really exciting, honestly. I have a roadmap of where I want the story to go, but the final product its a surprise to me also when I write it! ^^
“I offer you my deepest apologies again, Dean. I promise you that it will never happen again, and I swear that I didn’t… see much of anything”, said in a betraying increasingly small voice.
The Darkness had been less extensive than the Apocalypse because it had only affected people that were outdoors. But those who it had found under the sky…
Maybe if he’d been a bit more clearheaded, he could have realized that Cas had gone a bit too still. But no, he had kept fucking talking about things that, as the mage had very kindly put, he didn’t know
“You know how many things we´ve fought with you? The Apocalypse, the Angel War? The freaking leviathans, and Purgatory? Heaven´s fall? You´ve been with us, what, five, six years? I guess that means
Chastity was one of the highest values in nobility. Showing one´s neck or chest, being male or female, was considered scandalous, and frowned upon. So of course, his rebellious brother usually walked around flashing everyone a bit. But he usually had ways to hide his skin from their mother, even if just with illusion magic. If he was caught in such a disrespectful fashion, he would surely be disciplined in some way.
Dean nodded as he pursed his lips and gave the bottle to Castiel. As the mage uncapped it, the hunter stood up again and stretched a bit, his eyes scanning their surroundings. He felt suddenly much more tired. Jesus, he was gonna burst some blood vessel on the head or something if he didn’t stop finding scenarios that could mean his baby brother was dead.
Dean sat after a second of slight struggle, and he closed his eyes as he panted for a second. Probably dizzy, Cas deduced. He had lost a lot of fluids, and had stood up too quickly.
“But the best way to eliminate it from your system is an antidote. So I have to go for a moment”, he continued as he smiled softly.
Eager for next chapter, The Antichamber? I´m super happy with how all of Castiel´s siblings turned out... See you soon!!
“Oh… I don´t. I don´t!”, she finally snapped out of her astonishment, “Castiel, this is incredible!”
Castiel inhaled and huffed out firmly, a determined expression taking over his features. He had been taken off balance, but he was back on track. This little pause would be incredibly helpful.
Thinking about Dean got him to his previous train of thought. He remembered the scene he had lived in the forest with the giant wolves. He also remembered Dean talking about him not spending much time in the field. The truth is, he didn´t. He had gone through years of training, but in closed classrooms, in controlled- in other words,
Cas closed his eyes in a small wince. The berry essence had not been enough. Gabriel put an urgent hand on his shoulder, eyes pained.
Dean grimaced in absolute regret. He should have not called his penis like that for so long, and his brother reminded him of the fact every time he mentioned how much he wanted the child to be named after him.
He felt his face burning red, with embarrassment, with shame, regret, with all the pain this issue had always brought him; sensed the rush of hormones sent into his bloodstream, the quickening of his heart, the tension of the muscles in his stomach, the raise of his body temperature. He felt so humiliated. There was no way he could answer that question.
Dean kept his breathing paced. He did not know if they would be able to take twenty-plus people out of the house before the fighting started, but he fully intended on trying. He did not like the idea of shooting with a bunch of civilians laying around for the monsters to grab as shields, or that could eat a missing bullet as easy as pie. He knew the monster, or monsters, could be there any minute.
“Oh. I´m sorry. I don’t mean to make you uncomfortable”, the angel tried to smile, “It´s just… humbling. Congratulations”
They both stayed silent for a while, looking around distractedly, until Dean saw his father frown so very slightly. He followed his gaze… and sighed in frustration.
Oh, he was being such a gigantic pussy. Letting that fucking monster inside his head. And now making a whole spectacle about it…
“Dude”, Dean interrupted in a firm voice, “You got munched on for trying to bring me a freaking ingredient. Don´t apologize”
The angel stopped talking, sadness in his eyes. Dean felt like shit. He felt like he was making Cas feel bad about having told him. He didn´t know how to do this right. But he had a speech, and it was the only thing he could hold on to.
Every House had economical power because of their magical power, which was tied to their bloodline. And apparently that power of the bloodline, for some reason,
“Alright”, he said as he folded the map and tucked it into his belt, “Get your flying stone, mage”, Dean ordered as he looked at him, “Let´s start”
. Light and creation had some kind of bond, and the most capable lightomancers could create something out of light and will it to materialize. Lucifer, on his part, was a master shadowmancer. He could not only will darkness to appear, but to use it, too- binding someone else´s shadow to control them, creating shadows that attacked, or making some illnesses or curses worse… and could
Cas hastily took the cloths that had contained his meal and used them to surround the heart of his apple before putting them inside his bag. He didn’t want to leave any obvious trails that a creature could use to follow them. Dean’s hand appeared in front of his face as he started to stand up, and he took it with a grateful little smile. Dean didn’t smile, his expression focused. After bringing him to his feet, the hunter quickly turned away to start walking.
Castiel sat up immediately. First, because he was more than happy to run away from internal politics.
Set after the end of season 9. Everything is canon until the fall of the angels. Cas was God at one point, he was controlled by Naomi to attack Dean, he was later tricked by Metatron to cause the fall of the angels. First change is that the Trials never fucked Sam so bad, he was sick for a while but recovered; so no Gadreel was needed and Kevin is alive.
I did not intend to publish again so soon, but I got so happy to see some kudos and bookmarks!! And then I got COMMENTS oh my god :DDD
too… Dean, think of the damage Crowley could have done with it”, he inclined his head to him, as if asking him to be reasonable, “It was too important to be… squeamish. I doubted we could fight Crowley on his turf, and be victorious. I knew we would have to take whatever win we could get. So, if any sacrifices needed to be made… they had to be made. And, if a choice must be made between all of us…”
The man licked his lips briefly before biting his lower one, still looking down, controlled anger on his features. Cas knew he realized that he was not able to do much for now.
“You know the best part?”, he said as he turned to the mage, “It cannot be older than four or five days!”
Dean turned away from the sink, where he had taken the dishes, and rested his hips on the counter as he folded his arms.
Sam got up shortly after, mentioning he was going to get the other sandwich to Kevin. Dean finished his beer and took both bottles to the sink before leaving the kitchen towards his room, half a sandwich still to eat on his plate.
In an attempt of suffocating the rebellion, the protests, and the rise of the newly organized army, Crowley tried to use his powers to end all who opposed him in three awful events: the Apocalypse, the Darkness… and the End.
“You were the one who thought of a way on how to stop that thing. I just doubled the number of fighters on our group”, insisted Castiel stubbornly.
When the last spike was out of him Kevin gulped a sob of relief, and got out of the damned chair as fast as his limbs allowed him. He almost tripped in the process, but Sam caught him.
The angel looked at both of them with uncomprehension, then at Dean, who gave him an encouraging smile. He then shrugged, as if he simply decided to accept it, and dedicated the couple a small smile.
where Sammy´s really gone”, Dean answered, and he let out a frustrated sigh, “I preferred to check periodically if the trail and the way to the nest matched…”
“Few have feet as big as his, and besides not many people can be roaming this forest…”, the hunter said as he got up again, his eyes raking the forest ground, before pointing sharply, “Yeah, look there! Another one! We fucking did it, Cas, we found his trail!”
His teachers had looked at him as if he was a conspiracy theorist at the beginning of his exposition. However, they had expressed their fascination on the subject upon the ending of his explanations... and had allowed him full access to the Great Library. If a cure for the Corruption was found... it would change life, for everyone, in the whole kingdom.
“Well, a good hunting teacher would probably have not let you get caught by a mandrake, but here we are”, Dean shot back with a complicit smile, “Guess none of us is perfect”
He flinched, his gaze shifting to the wall, as he heard the water start and a little yelp. Cas waited expectantly, but no cry for help arose, and the shower remained rushing steadily.
“I was returning from the High Academy of Magic”, the mage explained, “I heard screams. I flew down to see what was happening. I got there too late to help you in the fight, but you were bleeding out. I couldn´t leave you there. You would have died”
Castiel started to nod several times, but closed his eyes as the world shook around him, the pressure building again. However, instead of miserable he mostly felt grateful for not having reached the state he got himself to in his first wolf encounter. This time he hadn’t come directly from exhausting himself on the High Academy of Magic, he had rested the night before… And he was also aware that him being less surprised and afraid, more in control, had made him use his magic in a more precise way. The finer the spell casting, the less Corruption the caster got.
“I geeet, that you have your stuuuff, and you take care of it, okay?”, Gabriel said in an exaggerated bored voice, “But, there´s something off with you. You´ve got that frowney face you do when you feel bad”, he said as he pointed at him with a wobbly finger, “Headache, I presume?”
“Tis what´s kept me alive so far”, said tilting his head with a bittersweet smile, “Nothing personal”
He made no sound as he slipped inside the house. Soft noises directed his attention to the kitchen. He gathered all of his hunting skills to be absolutely silent as he prowled in that direction.
“It´s perfectly fine, Castiel. I really appreciate it”, said his mother, taking it with a compassionate smile before unveiling the gift.
The angel was… speechless. Wide-eyed, mouth agape, he looked at him as if that was the first time he´d seen him. His eyes were glinting, with illusion but uncertainty, with hope but confusion. Like he didn´t dare believe what was happening. Dean was still tense as a coil, hunching towards himself, looking at him with embarrassed, terrified and
A small swirl of black veins covered the skin beneath which his heart beat steadily. Cas frowned in slight worry, relieved that he had not used another spell to heal him, which would have made the Corruption worse. Since there was nothing he could do about it, he just sighed at its sight and moved on. With all the care in the world, he caressed lightly over the wounds on his stomach. The long slashes were bleeding very slightly, the cuts almost closed thanks to the elixir. Cas clenched his jaw as he tried to get mud out of a wound, knowing how tender the damaged skin and exposed muscle were. He felt the hunter stir, and he instantly put his left hand over his chest in a reassuring gesture as he hushed. The hunter sighed in his sleep... and stilled.
“Dude. Don´t wander off into the forest following a bee”, Dean´s dry voice sounded a bit far from him.
“I haven’t”, the mage admitted with a nod but a stern look, “but the accumulated liver damage you had when I first inspected you gives me an approximate idea”
“I can, but I prefer not to. Everything tastes like molecules”, Castiel said with a grimace, “I will join you, however”
“Yep. He… he died some years ago. A demon got to him. He… kinda died protecting me. But he killed him good in return”
“Wha…?”, he protested as Cas took him from the jaw to look at his open mouth, “Are we done?”, he said when he released it.
Dean turned to look at him questioningly. The mage stepped forward and put two fingers to his temple without a word.
Cas pressed his hand slightly to the richly decorated surface. Part of it slightly gave way, and as the mage let go of it, it came back to open an inch.
That made his little brother beam, and Cas felt that his weariness leaving him for a second at the sight.
“Yeah, man”, said Sam patting his shoulder, “You don’t have to start with that. You need to… regain some mental peace. Rest. Read”
“Why don’t you go get them?”, Sam asked as they left the food on the table, “I´ll get the coffee started”
“That just means that there ́s venom on your system”, said Castiel, wiping the black tear away with a gauze and replacing the bandages in swift movements, “Don ́t worry. I will give you an antidote soon”
And the three of them stayed overlooking the party, beers in their hands, warm silence between them.
Michael was wearing a royal blue doublet similar to Lucifer´s, opulent and classy, but his embroidery was golden. Seeing him standing next to his youngest brother, Cas realized once again how much Michael looked like an old Samandriel. He had blond hair, long enough to comb neatly towards one side; and clear blue eyes, clearer than Castiel´s. He usually portrayed a serious look, the stance of a soldier, all disciplined and strict. At that moment, his brow was slightly furrowing towards Lucifer, disapproval on his eyes.
“The knowledge of the tablets is worthless to us if we lose you in the process, Kevin”, said Sam looking pointedly at his brother and the angel for a second, “Last time, it hit you pretty hard. If you ever read the tablets again, when you want… maybe you´ll have to take it slower. Do other things, too. Have a life”
“Yeah!”, Dean said with a small smile, “I mean, you’re clumsy as fuck, and you got less experience than a toddler”
As he took a step to move forward, the door suddenly burst out, Dean stumbling in. He recovered his balance almost immediately, head held high, gripping the ends of his shirt and tugging from them to straighten it.
“Sorry. I didn’t know how to bring you back, and I panicked… I knew you would start attacking me soon if I didn’t, like all of the others had. After a shot didn’t work, I really didn´t know what would. Aside from killing the thing, that is”
“Washing myself, you idiot! I´m still bloodied and sweaty- not all of us can snap our fingers and bam, be shiny and fresh!”
“I hear”, John continued, his eyes a bit soft on the grass in front of them, “you´re taking care of Dean as he hunts, now that Sam´s retired”
But Dean, observant as the hunter he was- and paying attention this time- noticed the differences. His shoulders were slump, he moved slower than usual. At some point he looked up from the parchment and his gaze got lost in the distance before he shook his head a bit and started moving again.
There was little he could advance on, however. He had already searched the books he had last brought from the Academy, and had not found the time to go back for more. He remembered momentarily about those blooms that had withered away. His mind chased its own tail for a while, going over and over symptoms, causes, magical interactions, and physiological responses. Deep down he knew he was not going to achieve anything new - but he was happy to go over the process, since finding answers wasn’t his objective tonight.
Dean huffed and looked away in obvious frustration, but finally yielded, letting Cas push him back to bed.
for them to exist on. And Cas was pretty sure he could come up with a new sigil as he went the moment he needed it, just by thinking about it for a second.
“I could travel us there in an instant… and back”, Cas said slowly, and he started reveling in the words, “I take us there, I pick up my bluestone; we finish searching, I put it back down and we get back. We could search all day, not wasting any daylight… and still be safe at night, being able to rest, to feed without worrying about looking for food, hunting it or cooking it. To clean ourselves”, he added with a gesture to the bathroom door, and he dared to add tilting his head invitingly, “Hot water after a trying day…”
He really didn’t have that many tricks up his sleeve, so… he raised a hand and produced a little ball of glistening white light. Why not. He´d try everything he could think of. The endrega tilted its head to one side.
“It… wasn’t easy”, he continued, “He was a mentalist… he used mind magic, I mean. And… he was the fifth son”, he said with the weight the sentence deserved.
Dean still struggled and got to see Crowley walking towards them from the other end of the aisle, the fire cage vanished. The glasses were gone, so he couldn´t see the hellhounds, but he could imagine them joining their master as they got to each of them and start following him like obedient doggies.
“Fine! I am very proud of my progress. Today I managed to set a bush on fire, and kept it going for more than two minutes before I cleanly extinguished it”
”, Gabriel chided, frowning, annoyance masking his fear, “I don’t want to find my baby brother on a pile of his own goo one day, okay?”
And under Dean´s confused look, he put his good hand on the glass. An invitation. No demands, just an offering.
When I started this fic, I was deeply depressed. Full pandemic raging, away from the boyfriend and friends, no hopes for studies or work- the only thing that gave some kind of sense to my life was creating a bit of this every day. The only difference between a day and the next was in which part of this story I was. Now things have changed a lot, but I am deeply grateful to this idea, to this project. The drive might not be the same- luckily my life has more sense now and the depression is I think overcome- and I am writing another fic, studying much more, creating several roleplays (Supernatural themed, by the way, and they are kinda awesome xD)... but I am determined to see this little thing grow and achieve completion.
“The Plagues decimated the entire population. No one was safe, no matter the status”, he stammered back, distant thunder in his eyes.
“Uuuuh, I don’t know, spending the rest of your life with someone you love?”, Dean answered opening his hands, palms showing.
The hunter leaned down to grab a rock from the ground and threw it: it hit the tree below the spider, which skittered away quickly towards the treetops.
He blinked slowly a couple of times before the sound of passing pages registered on his mind. He rolled his head to his right.
“Ugh. Let´s do that tomorrow”, grunted Sam, turning the kitchen off and dropping the spatulas unceremoniously onto the skillet.
Cause shit, he hoped it was more of those centipedes… but the movement pattern didn’t match. This was a pack of smaller things.
Cas couldn’t help but frown a bit in distress, looking at Gabriel. His brother kept, as most of them around their mother, an inexpressive mask as he nodded- but Castiel knew him, and could almost sense his anxiety on his own stomach.
OH MY GOD, PEOPLE!! This fic hit 500 hits!!!!! I´m so happy!!  ALSO, with this chapter, this fic officially passes the 40K words- which according to a site I read that categorizes fanfics depending on word number, means now it´s officially a novel! :D So I decided it was time for a new chapter (I wanted to publish Dreams of Perdition first, but the next one of that is still in beta process- soon to come, however!)
“Well, yeah, the building itself is a Spire”, the noble admitted, “But since the noble family it was built for was lost in the war, the facilities were transformed and used to set up a place for knowledge and training”
Even though… Dean felt they weren’t exactly attacking anymore. They grabbed his clothes, tried to immobilize him. Of course, he wouldn´t oblige.
. All of it, Holy Mother of God… And… unconscious, half-dead Dean wasn´t at all as alluring as… standing, wet, very
Castiel blinked, stunned. He… he was right. It made all kinds of sense. He… was used to thinking in Academy terms. Closed environments with controlled variables. But a forest was something alive. A complex ecosystem with thousands of interactions.
“But you just don´t have the homefield advantage, kids”, Crowley continued, hands on his back; and ordered, “Squeeze a bit, honey”
(It honestly depended on which type of food and which type of sex were being compared. And he had to admit that noble cuisine was getting to a firm number one position on his list of favorite earthly pleasures.)
battles is his way of feeling angelic. I can see how he would see dying for saving the world savers, a prophet and the Word of God could count to him as a
The fury on Crowley´s eyes as he looked down to the floor, where Dean had been drawing while Kevin was being freed a huge devil´s trap that surrounded the chair and engulfed most of the room, could have melt stone. Especially when he realized that with his push, he had sent Dean out of the trap, and therefore out of his reach.
Dean had to admit, it was easy to feel overconfident sometimes in his job. They had spent way too many years hacking on what went bump in the night, to a point that a nest of vampires just felt like small potatoes. Especially after all the Heaven/Hell/Purgatory clusterfucks they had come up on top of.
“Like the ones the army uses?”, Cas nodded, “Then it´s got silver in it. That´s good. But it´s so tiny, man. Practically a long dagger. Don’t they make them bigger?”
John gave him a weak smile and his eyes flicked down in embarrassment for a moment before looking back up.
. The ferns hid roots he tripped with several times, but none enough to make him embarrassingly fall down onto his face. Every time, Dean snapped his head back to him, checked he was fine with his lips pressed, and continued.
Another silence ensued… but this time, it wasn´t so tense. It was uncertain and fragile, filled with possibility, empty of so many things left unsaid, but at least with the echo of some words spoken at last…
English is not my first language so sorry if I mess something up ^^ Constructive criticism will be valued as gold!!
“I know the feeling”, Cas smiled, “I have found people hurt in the woods before, and healed them. It is a risk, me not being an experienced fighter and all, and my mum has really tried to stop me from repeating it… but how can I turn around when I know I can help?”
everywhere. No spells for strength, not being able to help in anything. My body resented, too. I got sick very easily at that time. So weak, sometimes I couldn’t even walk, I stumbled upon everything… So
Dean looked at him… and suddenly his stomach dropped. His face went blank, as a low, burning rage started to bubble inside him.
The peasant had barely looked back at Cas to check if he followed in all this time, and they had exchanged no words for a long while. Dean still didn’t look at him, eyes examining the forest floor with almost a hungry expression.
easy”, he answered with a dramatic widening of his eyes, “I´m more used to sudden bad luck than good. And second… you know this kind of thing doesn´t happen every Tuesday, right? A noble helping a commoner?”
Of the destiel fanfiction I´ve written, this is on my top two endings of a chapter. I looooove it so much ^^ Cliffhanger!! See you next Sunday!
“Look, I… I wanna go alone. I´m sorry, Sammy. I know he´s important to you too. And I can´t explain you why. I just… I need you to trust me on this”
“She told me”, John added in a soft voice, looking back at the crowd, a small smile tugging from one of the corners of his mouth.
His mind was racing furiously, calculating. How much magic he had in him, how many bursts of force he could still make. Magic translated into force, the direction of that force, weight, resulting trajectory, final parable. That high? Higher. Better to be safe, he concluded- while a voice in his head screamed at him that
Dean couldn’t sleep during the rest of the drive. The images on his mind were too vivid still, present when he closed his eyes. He tried not to think of the more gruesome scenes, but… he needed to make sense of everything. He was pretty sure he understood everything now but… there was something he wouldn’t be able to believe until he checked it for himself.
“That tentaculous plant thing”, answered Dean, raising a hand to make a vague, sinuous move as his eyes racked over the pages.
Im sorry it took so long to get to the third chapter. My grandma got sick and that of course changed all of my plans. Ive been spending lots of time in the hospital lately- luckily she seems to be recovering!!
“I do not appreciate being mocked in my own home, Dean”, he tried to say in a stern, serious tone; succeeding only in part.
Cas stopped in front of his bedroom door to sigh. He couldn’t believe he´d finally made it. He´d actually survived dinner; despite the lingering Corruption still on him, despite his physical weakness, and he had even surpassed Gabriel and his concerns- his big brother had, true to his word, left him with no more questions.
Dean, feeling himself right there, had covered his head with his arms instinctively. When he lowered them, he saw two things.
The Road So Far: Castiel of the House of the Mighty finds Dean Winchester wounded in the Forest of Wyvernon. When Dean wakes up he distrusts Castiel, not knowing him or his motives, and them being noble and peasant does not help in reaching some peace. They finally settle on a truce and lay a pledge to the Laws of Hospitality. Since Dean got poisoned in the attack that hurt him, Cas leaves to the forest to get an ingredient... but something attacks him as soon as he arrives.
, been fucking right. As difficult to avoid as it were, overconfidence was not a good hunting buddy.
Castiel´s mind was racing. He really didn´t have that many resources. Light magic would do nothing now, but…
“I´m fine, I´m just… hunting, you know, it sucks”, Dean tried for nonchalant, but knew he was probably failing.
He looked up to see the man running towards the warm presence, towards love, towards everything that had ever been good.
He saw the room turn a lighter color, and by his side Dean inhaled sharply; the mage felt him shift suddenly on the bed.
And as he said it… he saw their faces, and felt the warmth of knowing they were fine. They were okay. He could lose them, any day… but not yet, at least. He still had a family with him, in this world.
But. They could have arrived using other methods. They could have walked away from the angel well before… he had made use of his grace to
As the elixir bubbled and started changing color from green to a light teal, he kneeled in front of one of the wooden chests that lay under his lab table and searched inside for a bundle of clean bandages- he set them at the foot of the bed. He went through the door at the right side of his bed, got to the smaller of the adjacent rooms, and returned with some towels and a silver basin with water that he left on a nightstand.
“Well, that´s good, right?”, the hunter said turning back to him, his eyes just slightly bright, “What happened?”, he asked alarmed upon seeing the cauldron unlit.
“Oh, no; oh, no, no, no, no”, blabbered Cas, negating with his head nervously, “Dean, I truly doubt your father would like that”
against the ground he left behind on his roll. He regained his feet by a rotting corpse, his ankles brushing it as he stood; and the reminder of the dozen bodies dead and decaying around him only served to spike his aggressiveness even higher.
But Dean didn’t mock him. He stared at him for a moment longer, a small knowing smile on his lips, before huffing out what seemed like a light laugh and looking down. He took the waterskin out of his bag and a little cloth, put some water on it and started to wipe his hands with it.
The Road So Far: with Dean still hurt and in his room but more than willing to leave already, Cas goes to have dinner with his family. There´s still lingering Corruption in him after the wolf attack, but he believes he can he can hide it. There´s some kind of feud brewing between Michael and Lucifer, in relation to a test their mother has put to determine which of them will lead the family, since they are twins- but Cas can´t be less interested in it. Castiel was literally saved by the bell as Gabriel was starting to realize there was something wrong with him.
“Don’t get your hopes up, buddy”, Crowley said looking at him with disdain, “You won´t get to see them”
This scene. The fucking scene, the one that´s coming- it´s one of those scenes that I as a writer have relived in my head *so many damn times* cause I love it so much. And finally, FINALLY it´s time to write it down and make it real!!!!!!
“Not many, gotta admit”, Dean shook his head, “The few encounters I had… let´s say they didn´t leave me
Dean rested his back on the headboard again, sighing deeply. Maybe he was relaxing, trusting him a bit; or maybe simply the spike of adrenaline was leaving his body and the weariness of his wounds was taking its place.
Exhausted, he let his brother take his arm over his gigantic shoulders and push him to his feet. Reality started to settle more and more as he hopped through the hallway, as he saw the half-unconscious victims crying on the floor, moaning the loss of the one that had held their minds captive. The night air woke him up even more, and he took a greedy, big breath of it. His heart was settling. Oh, God, it had only been a bad dream…
He walked away from the bed to what he considered his lab. His worktable, a big surface set in an L -shape, run by two of the walls of the room, occupying half of the chamber. The walls were covered in wooden shelves of different sizes, and at the ends of the table the surface met two high bookshelves.
Ready for a truly nightmarish time? I love so fucking much the chapter succession happening here- and that was initially totally unintentional: from Sweet Dream we swift into Beautiful Nightmare. Then comes Reverie, where at the beginning Dean´s still deep in the dream, and after he´s snapped out of it he´s not totally awake immediately: he keeps confusing reality with the dream, the images keep creeping onto him. In the end, it turns out that the spell of the Echidna over him never completely left, its control over him is still latching. So in a way, did he ever truly, totally wake up? :)))))))))
The surface of the liquid exploded into flames with a small roar, making both of them retreat a small step; the surprise making Cas drop the candle in the table, its flame extinguishing. Castiel´s heart was racing. He didn´t know Sam, but he really wanted him not to be dead. He also had brothers he cared about… What if he was? What would Dean do?
But… money had been an issue ever since he was able to understand the concept. Hunting was not a good business to be in. The folks you helped tended to be nice, sometimes gave food out… but at the end of the day, coin was the way the world worked.
“Good”, Dean crisply said with a sudden ton of energy and purpose on his voice as he closed the book and put his hands on his knees, as if readying to stand up, “Then I guess you’re ready for round two?”
“It’s alright”, the mage said in what tried to be a grumpy, dry tone; but the slight smile that he found himself unable to stop probably betrayed him.
“It´s… a very expensive combination of several types of magic”, Cas explained, “Along with some structural modifications made into the building´s design for the pipes”
. Fergus of the House of Crowley was a very powerful mage that only cared about getting more power. The population starved, suffered all kinds of hardship- while getting incredibly high taxes and very little in the way of rights. Protests gave way to rebellions, and rebellions gave place to Heaven’s War- an armed conflict where the followers of Crowley fought an organized population that even through hardship, put together an army that started to conquer back several places that stopped paying taxes and took over the warehouses of food and supplies of Crowley’s army.
“How can you be sure? What if I get like, severely injured and they try to move me to another body to survive?”
“No, he left that way”, Dean pointed at the spot he had found the potion at, “But it’s good to check if he found what he was looking for, cause if he did, he probably went back to town”
, he told himself in a rush, and he made himself think of the least person he was attracted to- it worked like a charm, and for once, he felt grateful to have such a presence in his life.
It was a lignarium. A creature specific of pine predominant biomes, specialist on camouflaging against its bark. It used the middle, backwards arms to latch into a tree and wait until a prey got close enough…
“Well”, said Dean with a fake, tense smile to his lips, “as I see it, the symbol had been trashed and the portal was gone. So getting you out of the fire meant getting all of us a ride back home, the
He hadn ́t really stopped to think about what was coming, as he had started to remove the unconscious hunter ́s clothes. He had been simply too annoyed at how much more difficult than expected the task was. Why would anyone need so many buckles, and so many different parts stacked onto another? The man was heavy, too; moving him around to remove armor parts and layers of clothing had become rapidly taxing.
“Bootprint”, he grunted as he pointed down, mercilessly obliterating his train of thought with the word.
“Milked?”, Dean commented, his eyes never stopping scanning the darkness, “Well, maybe not yet. Maybe this is like, the pantry. They eat one, then come get the next one”
Dean just ate, observing the angel. He seemed suddenly hopeful at the mention of the tablet, a small smile to his lips. He was still laying on the bed, both hands on his chest, one on top of the other. Seemed to have no intention of sitting up.
“No, no, no”, Cas said, finally starting to move, swinging his legs over the end of the bed, “Coming, I´m coming”
“I don’t really know”, the mage murmured as he worked, eyes distant, “Biomancy isn’t really my forte”
“No, no, I’m not judging, I’m not telling you what you should…”, Dean babbled as he raised his hands again.
His back to the wall, he risked a look. His victim was washing something in the sink… Perfect. He had a clear route of entry, and an objective with his back to him.
The hunter smiled knowingly back. It had been a flawless hunt; Cas, Sam, Kevin and him. And poof, no more demons on Earth. Bye forever, Crowley.
His tone had been a little bit robotic. He was nervous. Dean clapped his shoulder and left his hand there, squeezing in gentle encouragement as he took the other bottle.
“I´m glad you did this. It´s been so long since we all could be together. Must have been hard to get everyone to clear a specific date”
He frowned slightly and looked at his companion, searching for any reaction on him that showed if the angel had heard something too.
Also- we are celebrating!!!!!! To conmemorate that my most popular story, Try, got to 2,000 hits (I´m trying to celebrate kudos/hits milestones so writing is easier and more delightful for me), I´m publishing 2 chapters today: one of Kingdom of Heaven and one of Dreams of Perdition. I´m pretty happy about how both turned out.
Some things to add: I read on the Supernatural wiki that Holy Fire affects demons and demonic creatures quite a lot, but I really needed it not to so this whole thing worked, so let´s just pretend for a second, haha ^^U
The angel looked at the hunter, frustration and pleading in his eyes; but Dean didn´t relent an inch.
He swallowed, knowing this was not going to be easy. Maybe Cas wouldn’t even let him. But he pressed his lips into a line and, while the angel looked at him confused, grasped him by the flaps of his trenchcoat.
He tried to stand up, but his damaged leg failed him and he fell with a grunt. He started crawling on all fours- but he heard thumps from behind, and when he looked back again he saw the black-furred beasts running towards him, teeth bared.
“If you can, try to orient yourself where you can actually see things around you. It’s very easy to get lost inside a forest, you lose perspective. When we were higher and the trees were scattered, I located this peak nearby”, his finger touched a mountain with a symbol of a fortification drawn in it.
A sweet warmth extended on Dean´s chest. The girl probably had thought he had had a nightmare or something, of her dying, and hoped to calm him adding the visual image to her voice. Well, in a sense, she wasn´t wrong.
His voice was just a background detail on Dean’s focus. His eyes flickered around, searching for… something. Something was wrong.
Castiel looked at him, frown on his face, expression firm. As if he knew deep down that he was right. Dean left the dish on the desk so he couldn´t throw it at the angel´s face.
“Come on”, Dean teased them, “Wouldn´t it be awesome to think of a little girl, or a cute little boy?”
His head whipped back, some kind of feeling grasping at his heart for a second. Like… fear, for some reason. Like angst. Had…
Dean felt his brother holding something up- he understood it was his phone when he took it to his ear. He shifted a bit to get his face close too and listen.
One tentacle advanced tentatively towards them. Sam quickly slashed at it, and then moments later at the next that dared to approach; as if he was playing some fucked up game of Whack-a-Mole.
He took his time, reveling in the hot water. He sniffed at one of the little bottles of ointment on the close shelf, thought for a second, but decided not to add strange smells to his skin- whatever happened with Cas, he was definitely going hunting that day. After that, he dressed and bent towards the mirror by the sink, inspecting his stubble. He had time to shave too.
How´s it looking so far? Which part did you like the best? Tune in next week for Chapter 3, Who You Truly Are! See you in the comment section!
After all, it hadn’t been a total clusterfuck, Dean decided. The monster was dead, the vics safe, both of them alive, minor wounds only.
“Hey, dude… be careful out there, okay?”, Dean told him, “I mean, you probably know, but that forest is
This is a slower chapter than the previous ones, basically a nexus between those and the next one, but I'm fond of it ^^. Dean and Cas' relationship has to grow slowly, and we have chances here for it, to see their differences but also what they have in common. Also- I'm a big fan of writers that drop little details from the very beginning that come back to show you *they seemed unimportant but weren't* like, 20 chapters after xD So longfics need chapters like this one! ;)
“Sorry pal... I think I´ll pass. I´m sure your intentions are good”, the hunter added as he saw his dismayed expression, “But I really don’t have time to babysit a newbie. Gotta find Sammy”
Heyooooo! ^^ It´s SUNDAY, and that means it´s POSTING DAY!!! (Which I had totally forgotten, so that´s why this is coming out so late, lol...). Thanks all for the comments and kudos ^^ Im so glad you like it!!!
“I-I don’t think he’s here!”, he heard the mage calling at his back, “At least not in my part! These are all rawheads’ corpses…”
A gal jumped at Dean outta nowhere, bursting from a room, and he instinctively ducked her in the face. She staggered forward, dazed, and he realized in horror that she was one bad step from falling over the railing. He grabbed her waist and rolled with her to leave her on the ground, but he heard then someone ducked him in the back of the head, and he went down with her.
So yeah, Cas is officially gay in this universe, and Dean openly bisexual- AND OKAY WITH IT isn´t it a relief?? Not that that´s an important fact. Dean said so. He´s NOT HIS TYPE. And Cas is ENGAGED. NOTHING´S GONNA HAPPEN. EVER. I´m not fooling you, am I? xDDD That is all obviously a lie: things WILL happen, or this wouldn't be a Destiel story, would it? But- it won´t be that easy! Can you feel the drama building up already?
PS- I swear this is not just to make Dean suffer, it all has meaning and its necessary for the rest of the story xD
“Wow”, Dean raised his eyebrows as he shook his head and drank from his cup, “To think people die by the hundreds”
bit scared of his father, or at least wary of him. The hunter had mocked him when he found out, reminding him he was
He stressed for some moments about what could he do. Not much, it seemed. Days had passed, and he couldn’t go back in time; no one could, not even with magic. All he could think was
“If my understanding of human reproduction is correct, I strongly suspect you barely had a brief participation on the matter”
Castiel huffed in irritation. He was more than aware of what commoners usually thought about people like him, and felt it unjustified and unfair.
“I´ve been thinking, man. This is really dangerous, and it´s not gonna be easy for you. It´s already difficult, as I see it”, he quirked an eyebrow at him, implying his panting breath.
“Thank you, Dean. Thank you”, the angel said, looking sadly up at him, “But I´m not getting out of here. I´m sorry. You have to go”
“Hey, hey, stop, stop!”, said Cas as he took his face between his hands so his head stopped lashing to one side and the other, “Look at me!”
“Eat”, said Dean calmly, forcing his hand down, “They’ll probably close up on their own. It’s all almost stopped bleeding already”
Howls, grunts and voices started to sound all around them, echoing through the tunnels. The Demon King turned to Kevin again.
“It is mainly located on the chest now”, Cas answered, feeling the black veins over his heart, barely reaching his shoulder.
“Uh…”, he mumbled, a hand hugging the tablet to his chest, the other rising to touch the poke marks on his forehead.
”, he said glaring, “You thought I would… what? Learn that you have this much money and come to steal from you? Like a
Dean had been waiting for him, impatient, uncomfortable, ready to leave for the forest, not knowing when his next chance for getting clean would be. The only source of hygiene he had had at his grasp had been the silver basin that Cas had so hastily cleaned to make himself decent. So
“Yes!! Oh my God, yes! This is amazing!”, she said as she lifted the rock to see it better in the sunlight.
“Dean… no”, the mage looked even more distressed as he walked two steps towards him, “I… I don’t know how your life works. It’s completely normal that you don’t know how mine does. We’re very different. I shouldn’t have said that. I…”
“Cas, Cas, Cas… Did you really think I didn’t know you´d run here as soon as I got my hands on the little prophet?”
Uriel was an arcanist, a mage that performed magic by drawing sigils and infusing them with energy so that they performed complex magic results. Any mage could draw and infuse a sigil they knew before, but only arcanists had enough understanding and connection with the magic symbology to examine a sigil and understand every thread of the matrix that led to what it would do, to enhance it, to modify it… and even create new ones from scratch. Cas would never understand arcane magic. It required a strange mix of math, physics and magical instinct that was unfathomed to him.
The vexhound let out a high-pitched sound as the Impala, well, impaled it from side to side. Dean wrenched his sword from its canine-like, brown, hairless body with a grunt, right before jumping back a step to get away from a snapping jaw that attempted at his lower leg. Teeth bared in fury, he swung his steel on a diagonal arc, delivering a mortal blow that made another creature fall limp to the ground. His second swipe missed another sharp-teethed, growling being that started hissing furiously in his direction, the line of venomous spikes on its back tensing up menacingly.
Dean smiled, still nervous though. Jack was wearing the same clothes he had last seen him in. The white jacket suited him, he thought. He was on the other side of the road, and his expression was serene. He felt… so far away from him. Not only cause of the physical distance. There was something about him that was like, unreachable. He realized that had been that what had prevented him or his brother to hug him goodbye two days earlier. It felt like, it didn’t proceed, like it wasn´t what it was supposed to happen. Things were different now.
Seeing the amicably and shy mage get all ragey had shocked him more than if he had grown a second head. He must have really struck a nerve.
“Because I know how”, the mage continued, lifting his head defiantly, “Right here. Right now. We could find out this second. Be sure he´s okay”
This was a very difficult chapter to write- I had to do 4 rewrites, lol! But I´m happy with the result. Hope you like it! Some light worldbuilding in this one, let´s discover the world a little bit! ^^
He rolled backwards, got out of the worst of it and started rolling through the floor, trying to put the flames out. He kinda succeded, felt Kevin flapping his little hands nervously over him. When the worst of the pain ended, he was flat on his back, looking up, grunting and with half a dozen parts of his body scorched by flame. The smell of burnt hair, clothes and skin floated around him. He had lost the freaking glasses in the toss and tumble.
He considered for a moment asking magically his blood to leave his face, fearing his raging blush would be more of a cause of mockery for Dean than his exposed skin- but he was so magically tired that he couldn’t help but close his eyes and sigh in defeat at the thought. He felt he would not be able to do any magic at all in a while, and he doubted he could perform any important magical feats for the rest of the day.
He felt so relieved. He liked Cas. He hated having made him upset- but that was water under the bridge. Now they’d go search for Sammy. And he would train him as they did. He would help the noble as much as he could, just as he was doing for him. He had no magic to offer him- but he had experience, knowledge, and Cas needed exactly that.
Cas pressed his lips in consternation. Death had been brutal. Implacable. Unavoidable, confusing, frustrating, unfair. The most of all the Plagues. The others, at least they let people understand what was happening to their loved ones before the inevitable.
The angel retreated his hand, tightening his grip on the couple, face diving forward to hide in Jessica´s hair- and after that, Dean saw only flames.
Castiel closed his eyes, concentrating. He visualized the pushing spell, gave it form on his mind… and when it was done, he tried to keep it there as he licked his lips and started raising both his hands.
He opened his eyes to cast a look too. Black patches had appeared, marring his pale skin. Two or three had grown and elongated a few inches into undulated tendrils, one extending towards the center of his chest, the rest trying to climb up towards his neck- but still very far from achieving it.
“Don’t sweat it, man. You´re not my type”, he blurted out with a grin as he laid back on the bed, his hands beneath his head.
“First things first”, he said, looking at the hounds left; why the hell weren´t there demons anymore?, “How do we get you out of here? Is there a way you can cross it? Even if it hurts like a bitch?”
“… and you can like, teleport, and do light shows and never get sick…”, the hunter frowned, “Jesus, how powerful are your big brothers then?”
But then something caught his eye. He tilted his head slightly to one side and took his cloth to the right part of his chest... where, close to the clavicle, a drawing was barely visible. A careful caress cleaned one of the last of smudges and revealed... a tattoo.
“Okay. Alright. I can be cool”, the angel murmured, his eyes flicking in all directions in intense thought.
He frowned, thinking… Then it dawned upon him, slowly, as he looked around to the derelict house. His brow furrowed in puzzlement as he saw the body of the monster on the floor, sans its head.
Dinner consisted of a potent venison stew that had Dean moaning briefly and asking what the hell did they put on that thing. Cas told him about the spices his family imported from the eastern region of the Kingdom, and how his mother had always loved them, given she had been born there. Dean protested his monster atlas, telling him all the names were wrong, Cas had insisted that the name of a creature was the one its discoverer gave it; and they spent some time debating if the name most people called something was more valid than another that would be more accurate. They also went through the events of the day.
Dean made an appreciative sound as he looked at his own meal, and immediately took the apple into one pocket, the little packet of sweets into another, and took out a dented knife with which he started to cut the rounded loaf of breath through the horizontal. As Cas immediately dove towards the sweets, feeling the need of his body for sugar almost as clearly as a tactile sensation, the hunter divided the bread into two parts and started to take the slices of meat and vegetables on top of one of them.
“I am a nobleman of the kingdom, and a server of the Lord”, he said firmly, “My family is the most magically gifted of the nobility”
But the mage didn´t listen, and with a determined frown, he opened his arms in a wide sphere before pushing forward.
Castiel tilted curiously his head to the side as he observed. The hunter put the other part of the bread on top of all the ingredients he had rearranged and he then grabbed it with both his hands and took it to his mouth.
The TV and Sam´s laptop screen were the only sources of light, bathing everything in soft blues. Sleep was creeping upon him, and he welcomed it with open arms. It had been a long and fucking trying day, and he wanted it over
“I… have learned my lesson, and I´m definitely not looking forward to repeating the experience”, he answered very truthfully, and he looked up, “And I promise that if I ever try to shapeshift… again… I´ll call you”
In front of him, a shadow started to form. There… the one, he knew, who was the culprit. The one who had broken everything, who had taken his loved ones from him. The one who had dared raise a hand against his family, against his loved ones. The one that had come to ruin their happiness, to end their lives.

Dean opened his eyes and looked at him, hesitating a bit at that, a hand to his bandages. Cas tried to push him to the mattress by pressing gently on his chest. He looked away, but still did not lie back.
“There´s… no catch, Dean”, murmured Cas, “I just… found you in the forest and brought you to heal you”
Castiel loved research. He truly enjoyed getting little pieces of truth from where no one else had found them before, and puzzling them together into coherence. He had however gotten to a point where it had become a grinding task. He had gone over every useful document long ago, and now he had resorted to the ones that
“So I never thought of it till now. So w-when I say I can´t say it back, it´s cause I can´t. L-like, now. B-but… I´m not…”
Less nervous at last, his mind on the task again, he went to take some bottles from his worktable, and the bundle of bandages from the foot of the bed. He walked to sit beside his head, and slid careful hands behind his shoulders... to start lifting him up. He slipped beneath him as soon as he could and pushed his back with his shoulder to lift him more, enough for him to have some space to wrap bandages all around his midsection.
