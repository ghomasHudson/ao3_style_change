In a surprising gesture, Hannah and Uriel remembered to bring pie, not fuckin’ cake or stupidly trendy, treacly cupcakes. One of the pies is key lime, which is a tragedy, but the other one’s good ol’ cherry, still piping hot and obscenely red when sliced open. It’s flaky and delicious, and Dean’s sure he makes some absolutely disgusting noises while he gobbles it down, but Cas just smiles indulgently at him. Anna eats like a wolf, too, so they’re probably all used to it.
Most of the time, the tattoos on Dean’s arms made him feel lonelier. He’d look at them, the leaves that drifted down his arm lazily, and think about what he’d lost. But here and now, he’s just thinking about what he’s got, and how what he had isn’t gone just because it’s in the past.
was wrong, to have faith in anyone. In Cas. He buries his head in his hands, willing tears not to fall and letting the pathetic slop of his mood drip a sludgy path through him.
. It’s only with Cas that he’s ever slept all that well, anyway.
a girl. “Sarah Blake, remember? Ran into her during that haunted painting case all those years ago.”
“Espeon.” The words all but launch out of his mouth, and then she’s running into his outstretched arms. She weighs way more than Dean can remember, from when he picks her up and cradles her against his shoulder, but funnily enough all it feels like is there’s a huge weight lifted off him now. “You know where Sam is?”
with his tone. He ends the call.
He reaches over – it’s awkward as hell in his position, but seeing as he’s fallen over when they’re having sex before, this is nothing – and wipes his own fingers with the lube, starts slicking himself up as much as he can without going off. The whole room’s become nothing but wet noises and groans, a symphony to Dean’s ears.
“This is alright?”
Staraptor follows. Together, her and Castiel make some kind of goddamn tag team, each swooping in enormous parallel loops. He moves by Pokemon and they tumble over just from the force of him; the ones that don’t yield, Staraptor moves in to snipe. What must be ten Pokemon fall to the ground. They’re still breathing, but they’re out of fighting commission.
, for millennia, Dean, before I met you. Since I rescued you, Dean, I’ve felt much more doubt.”
It is odd to see Dean’s back nearly folded as he explores Castiel’s chest, slow and near-careful. Castiel has seen him perform sexual acts with women and men alike, and knows he likes it like this, almost measured. And he knows it hasn’t been like this with the men at all, only sticky fumbling in bar bathrooms that left bite marks on Dean’s neck – but Castiel is the first man, and it’s odd to think of himself as that but he is now, to make Dean’s lips go puffy and messy from kissing.
Dean’s moving, he’s walking away. Castiel should despair at that. But he doesn’t. Instead, warmth crackles through his body. He’s never felt this sensation before, like the sun from this universe found a home inside him.
She slips out of his grip and stands right in the way of the wave of poison. And then that purple poison gulps down Vaporeon.
Dean’s at war with his own damn feelings. There’s the Heatran’s lair-hot betrayal, shame simmering behind it, that Cas would try to pretend it never happened. At the same time, Dean has to bat away that stupid, stupid,
Cas plans to let Dean sleep for a few hours, so he picks one of Castiel’s more pleasant memories to revisit. Smiling, he lets it sift through him.
Dean’s pretty sure most dudes wouldn’t want a vibrator, however small, pressed right up against their swollen balls. Then again, most dudes aren’t archangels in heat who make the most fucking delicious noise Dean has ever heard, when he does just that.
Dean’s tempted to clap him on the shoulder and say
out of him at first, but he’s not going to mention that.
It only occurs to Dean that
“So where were you working before this?” Charlie asks Cas one day over lunch.
But these aren’t the dummies Vaporeon got to practice on in training, or even the holograms a couple of the more advanced gyms had. These Pokemon, and their trainers, they’re all too real, complete with nasty claw knuckles and poison gas and enough psychic power to pin a human to the ground. And too many of them are getting right back up, and attacking again.
“Don’t beat yourself up like
Tonight, though. Tonight. His brain’s practically rattling in the cage of his skull and he needs something, anything to soothe it.
“And we didn’t even have to shovel any poop,” Charlie declares triumphantly. Dean grins back at her. He thought maybe she’d be a slacker, the type that slides by on her charisma and easy charm, but she worked her ass off too. This chick is
“C’mon, man. That’s at least equally my fault.”
. Don’t tell me caring is only for me.”
Dean stands at the crest of the hill. He feels awful, stalling up here while all the action’s going on below. At least he can catch the flash of Staraptor’s white feathers and red crest barrel into a Shiftry. The thing stands no chance and falls to the ground in a heap of leaves.
Dean is a very attractive man. Emmanuel notices these things with others, certainly, but they never strike him so gut-deeply as Dean has. When they met, Emmanuel couldn’t stop staring, not even with Daphne’s hand clasped in his own.
“We’re not – we’re not gonna talk about that,” Dean interrupts.
“Less messed up than it was a couple of hours ago.”
Sam hazards a look over at his brother, still standing ramrod straight. He’s too close to what’s left of the shack. His figure is just a silhouette against the fire’s light. Sam keeps an eye on Dean, afraid of him getting swallowed up in that fire if he looks away too long.
There’s a funny charge to his words, fondness with a huge daub of irritation dropped inside it. Another crappy childhood, Dean figures. He’s about to let it drop, but it’s still a while until they get to Edlund, and he ain’t sitting here in total silence. “How many more?”
He thinks it’s a simple way to demonstrate. Quickly, he sheds the trenchcoat and overcoat, to Dean’s eyebrows raising. Castiel ignores that to divest himself of the tie, as well, and then his hands trip on their way down his front. Buttons are tricky.
(Of course, Dean remembers that night. He remembers the two of them cramped inside the Impala while Dean went over attack plans, and Cas snapped back and forth between discussing them with him, and cheerily babbling about the biology of bees.
Dean’s always a lot grumpier on those hunts, for whatever reason. Although, Sam’s long, meaningful, super girly pouting looks are
And gone.
“I must have startled you,” Cas says. It’s not an apology, but Dean figures it might be one from this guy. Dean gets it; he doesn’t say
“You wouldn’t have me any other way.”
, man,” he admits. “I haven’t heard news outta Goldenrod, or any other city outside of Unova, for months. I don’t know if there’s anything there, or just a smoking ruin.”
The tentative moment shatters as Castiel’s voice trails off. Dean barks a laugh with absolutely no humor behind it, and finishes storming out of the room. The door slams so heavily behind him that the entire cabin rattles.
It’s that same voice. He shouldn’t trust anything, but he rolls the blanket down from over his face and can only goggle at the tall, willowy redhead in front of him, in a tank top and black cargo pants that are loose on her skinny hips. Not Gabby. Not Marin, either. Not anyone from camp, but not a stranger either.
of all Pokemon is coming after him.
As if summoned by thought, one of the generic Nurse Joys found in all hospitals opens the door and immediately veers in front of him. “Dean?” He can barely nod, but he manages it. “Oh, wonderful,” she says. She’s a nice lady, they all are, but Dean kind of wants her to give him a damn moment.  “We were waiting for you to wake up, you have some very enthusiastic visitors –”
definitely isn’t the word to describe her. (“That was like a big frat party for all of us,” Meg sighs, when Dean brings up Isaac choking down drain cleaner. “Past is past.”) Also not surprisingly, one of the others is Charlie. Or Gabby, now. Not that Gabby’s tossing out a lot of insults, really.
Worth it, though. Actually pretty perfect.
. Dean slides forward best he can to sit in the space between Cas’ shoulders and neck, cradling the latter.
As if she was summoned, Staraptor perches right on Cas’ shoulder. Dean can’t see her face from here, but her feathers have puffed up; her size must have increased by a full third, at least. He imagines that glare of hers trained on Alastair and smiles grimly.
Dean hacks another long splinter off the lance. “Never mind,” he hisses.

Not right now, anyway. Everything gets fucked up in the end, but he’s as happy as he’s been in years wandering through Purgatory with a half-crazy Castiel, missing Sammy like the thirst and hunger he doesn’t feel here, and with no idea how he’s gonna get out. He’s as happy as he’s been in a long time with Purgatory’s forest howling in his ear, loud enough to fill it up like a solid.
“I really like you,” Dean says. His voice drags with sleep, but it’s still genuine. He can’t even keep his eyes all the way open, but at least he’s squinting, because seeing the mess of Cas’ hair and his sleepy eyes seems of paramount importance. “’First, I worried it was some hero-worship thing. What happened outside Shopping Mall Nine, even if you don’t – point is, that’s not why I like you. It’s just you. You’re stubborn and I love it. Sense of humor could kill someone, man. And you care, so damn much.”
Sam’s protests fall silent after that. He hazards another look at Castiel and gives him a cautious nod; Castiel doesn’t return it, of course. Their strange crew, Mary and Sam and their captive from another universe, they start walking to the house together.
shivers.
His tone puts a deep chill through Dean’s spine. It’s the same voice he used when they first found themselves in Purgatory, firm and commanding. The one that reminds Dean of
and crank the volume of his music up a couple of notches.
Victor becomes as much a part of the little makeshift family at Edlund Nursery as anyone else. Jody sneaks him cookies, and Benny sloppy joes; he guffaws when he listens to Tessa complaining about the asshole donors to Edlund, or when Charlie says anything. He even has a weird-ass friendship with Cas, one that mostly seems to revolve around the two of them not talking and glowering at things, but some of the more rowdy Pokemon in the center respond well to it, so Dean just watches it and grins.
Sam and his friends are gathered outside the apartment when the four of them get back. Dean feels a sudden pang of sympathy for all of them, from stoic, serious Ennis to near-silent Lily to Ava and Ruby, heads inclined toward each other and cackling. They’re a group of college kids who never asked for anything other than an education, and now they’ve been forced to go on the run from God only knows what for months. Dean remembers Espeon as incredibly playful, always bounding around and trying to find other Pokemon or even humans to play with, but she sticks tight to Sam’s side now.
Before the word’s all the way out, Cas shoves Dean’s pants and boxers down at last. “That’s it,” Dean gasps as Cas curls his palm around Dean’s cock.
think that. Thanks to Pokemon, the economy’s been completely balanced for years. There’s no need to worry about energy or transportation, since Pokemon easily provide it. Huge corporations and tiny family-run businesses alike dedicate themselves to Pokemon and their trainers.
“Meaning?” Cas’ eyebrows are up. Dean figures he knows what she means but he, too, wants to hear it.
“It helped,” Dean says. He’s surprised how automatically the words come out. He can feel Cas turn his gaze to him, still wary, and Dean – also automatically, he reaches down and touches Cas’ hand. He moves, until he’s touching Cas’ palm. He’ll think about
For a bit, the only noise around them is Staraptor’s loud flapping. “I do,” Cas admits. “Do you?”
It’s Castiel’s turn to exhale when Dean’s palm, so warm, links around the back of his neck. “Okay,” he murmurs. “This what you want?”

him into the floor. He doesn’t scream when it happens; at least he doesn’t scream. He finds himself choking on a mouthful of cave dirt anyway.
He can only huff out a too-short laugh at that. Bullshit. Dean’s the guy who didn’t tear the world apart to find Cas after he sunk into that lake, just had him fall into his lap – and okay, that’s an image he doesn’t exactly
“Good.”
. That’s what he promised. But he’s gone.”
, anyway.
Cas shudders in Dean’s hand, though he doesn’t spill over yet. He immediately claps his hand over Dean’s shoulder and locks his eyes on Dean. It could be a hundred moments they’ve had throughout the years, but there’s never been a moment like this, pleasure and promise interlaced. “We’ll do everything,” Cas gasps, moving his free hand into his underwear too, guiding Dean’s movements.
“I don’t care about any of that,” Dean says, at last. “I’m a mess. I’m twenty-eight and I still miss my mom, every day. Don’t think any of what you said was true, but – so what if they were. You’re not
“Uh, sorry to go zero to a hundred here,” Dean says, tearing into a waffle in a desperate attempt to keep things casual, “but Cas is – Latios.”
It might have been the last time Dean hunted so ferociously, but this isn’t the Mark of Cain all over again. Dean relished hunting when he had the Mark, drank down sheer joy when taking out a nest of baddies. The heartbreak that’s wormed its way into Dean now, though, it’s left him empty.
Another image, Meg with her gross demon tongue in Cas’ mouth and her hands

“I just might.”
Dean feels terrible for Jimmy Novak; even though he’s in Heaven now, fuck only knows what he might have seen and felt his body do. Being comatose most of the time while Cas was dragging his soul around was the best-case scenario for the guy.

The first co-worker Dean meets isn’t nearly as intimidating as Jody or Tessa. She’s a redhead about his age, but dressed way younger than that, sporting Converse, a tiny backpack, and a highlighter-yellow t-shirt that reads
He shrugs, uncomfortably. Bringing up the people who care never stops making him uneasy. If it’s all that obvious, the people who don’t wish him as well as Risa does have to know that, too. “I am,” he tells her, anyway, because it’s not like he deserves any of what they’ve given him. “How’d you, um, end up here.”
not that he had ever bothered to try to look – and from each shoulder, two beady-eyed fluffy paper mache bird heads stare back at Dean.
Then his head falls to the ground, too.

“I’m gonna go,” he says. “There’s gonna be people coming here, though, good people, that’ll – take care of you. Make sure you and your kids are safe. Alright?”

“They’re older than I am, and were out of the house by the time I was thirteen. To be honest, I don’t know either of them very well. Zachariah constantly held them up as role models,
“Back into the water.”
“I’m probably included as well. I don’t expect it would make you feel better if I told you that, when frightened, these monsters ran to Eve and the Leviathan to tell them too,” Cas adds.
It takes Sam a while to clear everyone out and explain.
“Love of my damn life, Sammy,” Dean says, automatically.
“I was proud,” Dean says. “Am still. I’m just worried I’ve lost the kid.” He drags a hand over his face. “Referring to him in the past tense, God. The situation’s so fucked up. We had a big fight at my dad’s funeral, and – nothin’ since. Tried to e-mail him, tried to call, but there’s nothing.”
*****
Cas follows him down the hallway, back to Room 15. Dean can’t help the nerves jumping around in his stomach as he opens the door for him, but – it’s different this time. Cas can meet his eyes when they talk; hell, the dude has a hard time tearing his gaze away.
“You alright?” he asks anyway. Her feet are filthy and the seams have burst on the bottom of one of her pant legs, leaving it ragged.
Anna pulls Cas aside; Dean lets them be. He just watches them nodding together, speaking soft and low. They’re wearing sad smiles, but they’re still smiles.
“An appointment,” Dean repeats. “You gotta get an appointment with the woman who’s basically your mom?” So maybe sleepiness has completely wiped out Dean’s brain-to-mouth filter, but it’s a good point.
Anna follows right behind him. Vaporeon scurries into the room at her heels, while Staraptor and Pidgeot duck their way through the door. Thank God. Staraptor’s wing seems a bit wobbly, and Vaporeon has a big bandage on her side that all but cracks Dean’s heart in pieces, at least until she makes a running jump onto Dean’s hospital bed and sticks her clammy little paws right next to him. It hurts his chest to laugh, but he does so anyway when she bats at him a bit, affectionately.
Most of the hunter community talked a big game, but once they found out Dean was best friends with an angel, they were usually cool with it.
“Could say I have experience.”
Dean comes on his cock, and it’s another jolt to the base of his spine. Castiel even uselessly rolls his hips a few times, trying to find more friction somewhere.
Dean pulls everything out at once, and half-winces, half-pants at the wet pop. Cas gives him the big stupid eyes, and it’s totally unfair that he’s shaking with how much he wants it and he can still look like he’s right out of Precious Moments.
. “Think I’m fine here.”
Still, Dean cups his hands and drinks deeply. He doesn’t need the water here, but it’s still sweet and cold in his mouth, and it only occurs to him to be embarrassed by the frankly gross slurping noises he makes when he feels Cas practically hovering over him.
“Now you have someone who sticks with you, even if it’s not who you wanted it to be,” Castiel says. “Is that why you haven’t driven an angel blade through my heart?”
funny, almost swallowing the words.
He’s close to guaranteed to complain about it later, but right now, Dean’s glad as hell his brother’s stubbornness hasn’t faded away. Like anyone’s could in the Winchester family.

Naomi doesn’t even move in her chair. She merely folds her hands in her lap. It’s creepy. “There isn’t an easy way to say this,” she says. “So I’ll just start by saying I’m little better than Zachariah. He was just cruel, but he didn’t

He steps back, and finds himself swallowed up by a sudden crowd. There’s gotta be twenty of them. Must’ve followed the guy here, and Dean didn’t see it for a second. If, by some miracle, he gets away from this situation, he’ll have time to be flat-out
“It’s been a good visit!” Jack announces, seemingly oblivious to the emotional atom bomb he’s dropped right in the middle of the bunker. “I’ll be back to visit too. Cas, call my mom, it’s hard to make friends –”
Cas holds Castiel’s memories close to him. He wishes, so badly, that Dean wasn’t in such anguish when he said the things he did, but those days are past them now and it’s a wonder to roll his words over and over in his mind.
“I had to.”
His soul, Dean’s soul, is beautiful.
“Not just myself, either. Sam, of course, but everyone —”
“No,” Dean says, in a daze, and then shit, of course, Cas’ frown just deepens. “Uh, no, shit, I mean — it was way too good, was what it was.”
For his part, Cas takes it well. “Jolteon,” he says, serenely, like he’s not even embarrassed by Dean in a yellow jumpsuit. In fact, his eyes do a quick flick up Dean’s body that leaves him feeling – well, mostly he feels
His mood lifts. Only a couple of degrees. But it’s something.

Dean sees the garden two ways. Through his own eyes, it’s still the Cleveland Botanical Gardens. Thick green vegetation of all kinds sprawls across the floor and blankets the trunks of the trees. The air’s so humid under the shining glass roof, he could chew it.
Dean changes the topic, quick. It’s too charged in here; he needs to find a release valve. “You shared memories, huh. How much did you get of his?”
hand, heavy and hot, has found its way to the back of Dean’s neck. And they can’t stop kissing, long desperate drags from each other’s mouth. He’s surrounded by Cas, almost completely.
“God, you’re like a cockroach,” is all Dean says in return.
Cas hasn’t changed at all, then. It’s good to hear.
He thinks of the waitress in that diner. Mandy, he thinks it was. Pretty cool chick. Only had eyes for Cas. They could have had fun, and at the time Dean got half a hard-on thinking about Cas’ hands tangling in her hair when she would go down on him, the blissed-out look on his face as he pushed into her. But the same night was the whole Ramiel mess, and Cas was on his back on a dirty barn floor
There’s not much to say. Or, there is too much to say, and if they begin now they’ll never end and their plans will fall to the wayside. If Castiel makes a greedy noise when a crunchy bit of bacon rolls against his tongue, with cheese clinging to it, no one comments.
“She is.” Cas smiles at Dean, smoothing the sweater over his sides. The touch of his fingers makes goosebumps rise up over Dean’s skin, and he lets himself have a moment of wishing there were no clothes involved at all. “She’s also human, despite what you may have heard. Really. And you are very likable.”
“They are wonderful and awful,” Cas agrees, and Dean could swear his heart skips a beat at the fondness in his tone.
“I don’t know what, exactly. Wish I did.”
Sometimes, Purgatory looks like a painting, one of those styles Dean recognizes but couldn’t name exactly. Sammy was the art history dork, anyway. It’s all rapid flares of paintbrush across canvas, gooey yellow and green and red paint dripping. He looks into the distance and his breath will stick in his throat for just a second, because it’s so beautiful. Terrifying, too — if everything else is like paint, is that him, too? He wants to know who’s twisting the paintbrush with their wrist.
In the end, Dean thinks, faith got him something after all. Cas, here, rumpled and weary and back again.
“Neither of those is very likely,” Castiel says bluntly.
“Sure, maybe,” Ava grumbles, but because she still sounds awfully fucking bitter. “We’ve all been gone for months, ever since they cut our phone lines. Ever since we were only allowed e-mails from
,” he all but spits, whirling around and around in a wobbly circle –
Sam’s eyes narrow, and Dean’s expecting a rant the size of Goldenrod about how he
person would think.
“Cas?” Dean questions the darkness, and it’s reminding him too much of when he first got here and his heart wouldn’t stop thudding a tattoo he could feel through his teeth, the beat was so heavy. He turns around, and there’s no Cas anywhere to be seen, and it’s getting darker —
Cas makes, where Dean feels them in his mouth. There’s even the little
“Castiel,” Naomi says, standing up in one easy, fluid movement. Dean’s always joking about how he’s gotta get Cas a bell so he can’t sneak up on him. Anna’s quiet, too, and it fits her as well. But the idea of this woman moving around near him, and him not hearing it, skeeves him out. “We’ve missed you. You’ve been busy elsewhere.” Dean sees where Cas got his even, clipped speaking style from, but this woman’s all ice.
Not like
This world
“You wanna come like this?” Dean whispers after a few minutes. It’s a bad angle and his wrist aches. But he can feel the blood pumping through Cas, how warm he is, the stretch in his hand, and Dean’s never felt so fucking good in his life. “There’s a lot we can do, a handy’s great but –”
Dean blinks. The other cops he’s met were all blustery imperiousness, even the ones crooked enough to work with his dad. They looked the other way when Dean came into their stations, even when he had a limp or a purpling bruise across his face or a nasty gash on his arm. “You’re not like the cops from where I’m from.” Which would be nowhere and everywhere on the whole continent all at once, but Cas doesn’t need to know that for now.
Lucas wasn’t married, and he didn’t have any other family. He had lots of political rivals, because the guy was kind of a firebrand asshole for his causes, but they all had alibis that checked out. Still, Dean had figured at the time, all it took was one extremist.
“Can’t catch us, Sammy!” is all Dean does, sticking his neck out his rolled-out window and grinning wider than he can remember in a long-ass time. He adds a
The door has a long strip of paint peeling from the top and opens without any of them pushing it. For the first time in over a year, Dean sees his brother.
Cas must not have a snarky answer for that, for once, because he resumes kissing him. Dean really, really doesn’t mind getting shut up that way. They push and pull each other, kiss and kiss, until he finds the headboard rubbing against his back.
Dean feels his breath stick in his throat, because, well, shit. “I knew Gordon, yeah,” he gets out, but he hears how tight his voice is. Abby must’ve been his sister, shit. “He was another hunter. Got himself turned into a vampire. Sam cut his head right off with barbed wire. It was pretty badass.” He attempts a laugh, but it comes out hollow, and fuck, Cas is actually pouting at him.
Castiel looks at him and sorrow wells up through Dean’s entire body; he feels the shots he did the other night slosh around in his stomach.
“I know, I know, I was gone for years,” Gabriel interrupts Dean’s internal monologue. The fact that the two of them ever shared a thought at any point is a bit disturbing. “But that’s where we differ. My brother – well, a big part of his life has been figuring out who he should be loyal
to each other about it.”
“Dean, I say this with pride, but the only things in all of creation that gossip more than angels? Are demons.” At that one, she just offers up that grin that still sorta makes Dean want to clock her. It’ll never really stop, but at least he’s got new memories of her, Meg lopping off the head of some Leviathan bearing over Dean and not even bothering to pause for his acknowledgement as she stomped off to check if the other demons that were apparently her
And Cas. Cas, there wasn’t even words for it. He’d known Vaporeon for decades, and he’d known Cas for less than a year, but Dean had come to have twin places in his heart for the two of them. John told him never to fall too fast, but with Cas it wasn’t even falling.
Cas sits up on the edge of the bed, his eyes on Dean. He definitely sees Dean wake up and stretch, roll over in bed so he’s on his back and not his side, but he keeps staring. He hardly even blinks.
“Darling sister,” Uriel returns, clasping a hand over his heart in mock affectation, “only the ground and Digletts are beneath me.” As it turns out, Uriel
about that in the books. Just a bunch of outdated crap on how to hunt djinns and wraiths.
Cas has that gaze fixed on him now. It’s not
and huffy. Soap operas, seriously. “I sent Liwet and Micah to guard the prophet, but when I checked on them they were… gone. I was the only member of the garrison left, and I knew I wouldn’t be welcomed back in Heaven after we had all failed terribly.”
“How’d you get away?” Cas asks.
Dean could swear the bigger monster nods, before wrapping — shit, he doesn’t know what to call them, they’re like arms and tentacles at once, at the same time that they’re radically different and no shape or form he’s familiar with, probably not any shape
“You bet,” Dean slurs back. “Wanna guess why?”
he couldn’t stay mad at Cas, but it is what it is. “You did everything you could, Cas, and you saved him, too.” At the end of the day, at the end of what might’ve been his life on Earth, that’s what matters.
with several exclamation points. And there’s a smiley face. Maybe she did hear us.”
“Yeah. Just a lotta him saying
Dean only has to consider it for a second or two. “I’ve held back enough. I don’t wanna hide this. Least I can do is tell them.”
“People are in danger,” Dean snaps, harsher than he wanted. “You’ve seen it; I know you’ve seen it. You told me you admired Claire for her bravery before I had the balls to even agree with you. You know the shit that’s going on now, it’s all wrong –”
“Good.” Cas punctuates it with a kiss, open-mouthed but no tongue. “I used to think sex was boring, repetitive motion with little point but reproduction –”
“Yeah, I know.” A sleepy little smile curves over his lips.
They remind him of fireworks. He thinks of a couple of holidays Dad was busy doing God knows what, and he managed to get away with Sammy and watch the fireworks burst in the sky, glittering colors streaming above their heads. Their Pokemon would run around in a tizzy, the lights glittering across their shiny coats, and the two of them would laugh.
This is a man without strength of any kind. At the Hellscape, he made everyone else do his filthy work for him. Then, he got Mewtwo to do it. He’s just pathetic.
“Uh.” Dean catches Cas’ eye. If he wasn’t looking for his reaction, Dean wouldn’t have been able to see the barely perceptible shake of the head. “Consider that unnecessary details for now.”
The nightmares come back.
It’s not a long drive, and the beach is pretty empty because it’s still early in the season and the weekend’s not here yet. There are more wild Pokemon out there, a scattering of Wingulls that Dean tears up a couple of slices of bread for and some Magikarp in the shallows, than other people. It’s not much of a beach, either, more a couple of yards between a rich forest and the rise and swell of the sea, but it stretches out for a long while along the coast. The smell of sea salt wafts through the air, tempered by the damp forest.
of the world, would cage up a Pokemon. Speaking of Pokemon, Vaporeon’s just – gone.
and give them to sick kids. Hell, the Pokemon in the nursery deserve them more than he does. Or his mom, long gone. She could have used a miracle too.
Cas’ eyes widen and glitter from surprise and interest alike. Dean catches his face between his hands, and meets him in a kiss, long and slow and loving and so dirty at once. When he breaks away, it’s only to look over his shoulder at Baby and grin.
(Watching Anna and Cas reunite was both kind of adorable — not that Dean uses that word, but whatever — and hilarious. Cas’ idea of hugging was still holding his arms straight out, stiff, and then sorta boxing them around the back of the person getting hugged. Dean wants to whack him on the side, affectionate, and say something like
Eerily silent chaos erupts on the screen.
“Hey, man, you’re getting better at this manners thing. Congrats. Not that I’m much of a role model there –”
In the next beat, they’re kissing. Dean’s thought about this so many times, in so many ways, from some totally humiliating butterfly kisses to Cas shoving him into a wall after a hunt that nearly went bad with the two of them all dirty and bloody and reeking. One of his favorite fantasies, though, was right here, on his bed. And now he
In Dean’s dreams that night, he’s back in the barn again. When Cas says
to tell us.”
They all wait awkwardly for Andy to finish, but apparently he’s got nothing else to say. “
Dean tries not to be offended when Sam bursts out laughing. “Yeah, sure, Cas cares about me at this point. He does. But not like he cares about you, Dean! And in case you haven’t noticed, the way he looks at you is kind of…”
“I’d enjoy that. Any time spent with you is good.” Like many other times, Cas is just saying how he feels, but Dean still beautifully flushes and ducks his head. Cas relishes the opportunity to pull Dean against him, until their heartbeats thump together. His own heartbeat is entirely unnecessary, Cas knows, but in moments like this, it seems essential. “We should rest while we have the opportunity.”
After a while, he pulls back enough that he’s sure Eileen can see his lips.
Over the next couple of weeks, Dean sells off most of the artifacts in the storage closet. He keeps finding trinkets, and fills up whole bags with figurines of every legendary. He doesn’t want the shopkeepers getting suspicious, so he takes them all over Opelucid, at least until one sorta fateful day when Dean walks into Frank’s shop.
“And you thought about him.”
“Mom’s word is law,” Jo adds with a smile. “And if any of you are interested in working here like us stiffs…”
“Three syllables? That ain’t a mouthful.”
“Dean?”
“I get it,” Charlie announces, suddenly. A couple dozen heads swivel in her direction, but she just shrugs. “Naomi’s Dumbledore.”
She squeezes her eyes shut. Thoughts like that are why she didn’t stay there. Ketch was right, but Mary hopes against hope that Dean and Sam, they might be right too.
. But he still left. That was the last time I talked to him.
Dean sees a thousand universes. A million. More.
stop talking. “I’d prefer it if you didn’t do that.”
behind that.) He could’ve single-handedly introduced him to the wonders of non-virginity after the hooker didn’t work out. There were so many times in that year after Lisa’s when Dean knew he could’ve acted on all that tension between them.
, and he can’t ask him to stop even if he doesn’t dare think of the significance of it.
“Many things,” Cas says, squinting at Dean like he’s three-quarters of the way to figuring out what, exactly, this strange human means.
Still, Dean had a friggin’ blast. Yeah, there was that weird moment with the kids dressed as Cubone and Squirtle, but that was just Dean’s own thoughts trying to sabotage him. He’s trying to say
Two of Cas’ fingers push against Dean’s prostate at that very moment, and he’s arching off the bed almost entirely. It’s not quite fireworks, not yet, not from just one touch; he ain’t
It would’ve been not only easy but totally understandable for Vaporeon to make a break for it. She wouldn’t have even been running away, she would have been joining in with the rest of the Pokemon. Instead, she stayed close to Dean’s side. That night, she insisted on sleeping next to him, when lately she’d been staunchly keeping off the bed.
Dean thinks about all the times they were together in this room, him cooking for Cas or the two of them tearing into take-out. Vaporeon and Staraptor either stayed in the kitchen with them, annoying them until they got their food, or chased each other around the living room. For the first time since Village Bridge, Dean felt like he had a family. And he’s tired of watching his family disappear.
It’s so fucking awesome, Cas all wrath and fury concentrated into the play of his body, that as much as he’ll never admit it, Dean has to remember not to get distracted during missions. Normally it’s not a big deal, but there have to be twenty Leviathan bearing down, even if most of them are being driven backwards at the moment. Thankfully, there’s a pretty fucking good distraction: Dean finds himself face to face with — well. Himself.
“I think so.” Cas takes a big swallow of his coffee. “Different isn’t
Years might pass, but eventually, Dean’s urging Cas onto his feet, and practically stumbling to follow him before he struggles to open Cas’ button fly. His hands aren’t shaking, he notes with glee. That’s good. Smooth. Those same hands reach into the now-splayed vee of his pants, past the elastic of his underwear band, and God, he’s
“Jody and Alex and Claire said he was badass. I’m sorry I never got to meet him. A real angel, wow.”
about Espeon. They’re extremely powerful Pokemon.”
cosplay, because with the butter-colored silk jumper and the distinct number of tails trailing behind her, she clearly dressed up as Ninetales to go along with her Vulpix.
And shit. Maybe this guy’s got baggage too. Maybe he’s living like Dean, where he’s got no damn home and sleeps in his car. Maybe the reason this guy knew where to find him was because he got jumped here in the past. Maybe – maybe he’s another criminal, and the only reason he bailed Dean out was because he’s planning on dragging Dean away himself.
“Yeah. Fuck, Cas,
Dean just shrugs. He feels shitty whenever Sarah comes by, and then there’s a double punch of hard guilt. It’s that megawatt grin of hers. Sure, life sucks and she knows that, but she’s smart and resourceful and is gonna make the best of it; Dean hasn’t been living in this world for any time at all, really, and he’s the one talking in single syllables and constantly grumpy. Sometimes, he’ll reach out and flatten his palm against whatever part of Sammy or Cas he can reach, just to know they’re there. Neither of them blinks at it, honestly.
“All of them,” Cas says plainly.
Cas is unnaturally stiff, of course, but it’s easy to relax against him. Dean’s slept on stone floors and rotting floorboards. After that, Cas’ shoulder is nothing. It might as well be thousand-count sheets. The trenchcoat even smells like clean laundry, probably from the hospital.
The door slams shut behind Dean, snapping off the tether to what feels like his only lifeline.
, just to defend his masculinity. He’s realizing now that it ain’t worth it if it means hiding who he is and what he wants, so all he does is laugh. He swings an arm over Cas’ shoulder and draws him closer, the two of them shuffling until they reach Sam’s room.
Dean whirls around to see Cas, who was way closer than he was expecting. “I believe I’d be able to sense my brothers and sisters if they’d been here,” he explains. “But no — there’s no sign of them, and I can’t sense Kevin anywhere.”
It’s usually early when he gets to the bus stop, but it’s always crowded. Some of the people waiting call their Pokemon back to their Poke Balls, grimacing and apologizing to them while they do it. Buses are built to hold most Pokemon, but most of the larger ones stay in their balls for the duration of the ride.
“Are you ready?” Cas asks, after a few minutes. It brings Dean down from riding the waves of sheer bliss, almost ready to crest again. He actually has to gather his breath for a couple of seconds.
“Let’s go,” is all he grunts out. As he turns around, Cas is right there, space between his eyebrows furrowed. Dude probably heard the whole thing. Great.
There were lots of training gyms Dean and Vaporeon ended up in after that. They started off in the nicer ones, back when John was willing to pay, but that didn’t last too long. He’s been going to cheaper and sketchier ones for years, now. John’s probably overdue to go back to Village Bridge for a visit, and that means Gordon and Kubrick and their damn Durant and Lanturn will sniff Dean out again. He ain’t lookin’ forward to it.
and, in his better moments,
“Come to our wedding,” Kali says. Dean hasn’t talked to her much, but the woman’s intimidating as hell. Gabriel waggles her eyebrows and holds up her hand to flash her silver ring. It’s surprisingly understated.
With Gabriel’s permission, Charlie invited a ton of her friends, so the party’s overflowing with geeky kids in cardboard cosplay. She’s also playing god-awful music she sings along with until her voice gets ragged. Dean might recognize some of the songs from his attempts at listening to her mixtapes, but he’s admitting nothing.
“It’ll power down an angel,” she explained, “in case of emergency.” She wouldn’t look at Sam as she said it, but stayed focused on the sigil’s spikes and loops.
“Why? If you plan to kill me, I’d rather you get it over with now. I’m not interested in serving as a science experiment and I’m not for anyone to gawk at.”
“That’s when I knew I had to help. Not for what I did, but for what I could — stop from happening.”
Dean’s torn between finding some way to slip Cas his address, and answering with only a grunt or something similarly non-committal. He ends up settling for saying, “The stop on 16th Street, over by my apartment.”
– but tons of friendly strangers walk up to her and telling her what an awesome job she did. Heck, if she didn’t keep looking at Gilda all moony-eyed, Dean’s pretty sure she’d have her choice of girls to take home. Charlie’s definitely got way more game than he does.
“We didn’t have the best introduction,” Mary says. She doesn’t cringe; she holds eye contact. Everything turned out fine, she keeps telling herself. Better than fine. But she still feels awful about it. Desperately needing to process her feelings on all of that is a big part of why she’s here, anyway. “Mary Winchester.”
He’s pretty sure that when he went to barbeques and a couple of weekend getaways with Lisa, everyone thought they were just such a
It dies away when he sees the practically starved look in Cas’ eyes, just at his chest. Not like that’s anything he hasn’t seen before, either. Still awesome for the ego. “Go ahead,” he breathes, and if his voice sounds more like a whisper than the confident swagger he was going for, well, Cas isn’t gonna tell anyone.
a douchebag factory.
“Sam,” he greets, as he claps him on the back. Max is trying for steady, Sam can tell, but he hesitates just a bit before every movement. There’s a manic glint behind his eyes. “We all good?”
Dean hates heights more than he hates hiking, but from this high up and at this time, stuck between way too late at night and way too early in the morning, the city’s gorgeous. Both old and new buildings shine in the winking lights that line the streets. It’s like another night sky entirely, speckled with its own constellations against a dark canvas.
“Sure did. I don’t know what it’s like in your dimension, since Heaven’s different, but Hell ain’t exactly paradise over here.”
, but, uh, Dean. What happened with you and Cas in Purgatory?”
“Yeah, well,” Dean continues. “You – well, not you, but the other you – Cas showed up for lunch one day.”
of all people making movie references, when four very familiar figures walk up to them. They’re hesitant, their steps slow and deliberate, like
His hand spreads low on Dean’s belly, below his navel even. It’s a tentative touch, but it’s there. There might have been a flimsy-ass platonic gauze over Dean’s touch before, but there’s no mistaking this, not when Cas’ entire palm fits over such a vulnerable spot, not when he could move his hand an inch or two down and massage the heel of it into Dean’s dick.
Dean knows it’s stupid to think that. The life he’s lived, he probably hasn’t been safe for a minute since Mary went up in flames. Sam’s still gone without a damn trace. He still doesn’t know what the hell happened that night Cas saved his life, almost a decade ago.
“This is serious,” says Cas. Dean tries not to react, but he could fistpump over Cas’ reaction. “I don’t know what’s going on, but whatever is going on could be putting us in danger. I remember using a blue light, incredible powers, to save Dean. To save myself from some bad people, more than once. Same with Anna. I’m here because I thought you

But Cas just captures his lips again. Their mouths can’t stop meeting, over and over, deliriously good. They flatten each other against the sheets, an irrational glorious dance they make the steps up to as they move along, until Dean has his palms pushing Cas’ shoulders down. Even like this, Dean manages to have a coherent thought:
It’s still pouring when he finally gets outside, to an odd sloping roof that leads down to another driveway, one they never use. Even with the tread on his boots, he has to be careful that he doesn’t slip. Puddles, swelling quick, spot the ground outside, drowning any grass, setting the gravel outside the bunker off in little bumpy rivers of their own.
Marv doesn’t even react. “Your own little platoon, how charming,” is what he says. He’s looking straight at Victor, with a look in his eye that Dean doesn’t like at all. “But I’ll be damned if I sit in a jail cell and rot forever while you all ruin everything we’ve planned so meticulously.” The next gesture he makes is curious, arms straight out and palms turned up. He looks up at the ceiling, and the fucking asshole grins. “Steelix.
, but cants his hips down again. They slip in the sweat over Cas’ body, and Dean’s gripping Cas’ hips and just

Emmanuel knows he shouldn’t, but as he settles back against the car, he waits for the flicker of Dean’s light against the horizon. When it happens, for only that second, Emmanuel will let himself believe the promise in Dean’s gaze: that Emmanuel is something holy and worthy, a wonder and a blessing, not a strange man with rumpled sweaters and a still-sticky hand.
It’s the adrenaline talking, he tells himself. Adrenaline, and too many goddamn months on the road.
when fighting him with Psychic powers just wasn’t working – so people keep trying to grab their attention to thank them. Dean’s not surprised when they’re pulled away from him, leaving him alone with Cas again, but he is surprised at the ferocity of Sam’s final hug. He ain’t an optimist, not when it comes to his family, but maybe something really has changed here.
They spiral higher and higher. Cas, so used to his powers, moves quickly, and Dean can practically see the entire city by now. There’s the Edlund campus, a conglomerate of plain gray buildings, with their old bus route winding through it. The nursery’s somewhere in there; Dean sort of hopes whoever’s volunteering at the hour is sparing a peek out the window, and sees the two of them high up in the sky.
“And they can’t do what you can do.” Joshua laughs, rich and comforting.
“I didn’t get along with your father,” Naomi says, and Dean suspects this may be the understatement of the century. “I don’t know how seriously he took Mary’s training, but when she – passed – he fell completely into the conspiracies she was working to fight.”
There’s a roar from right beneath him, and Dean looks down to see his captor. It’s a Snorlax, but not a Snorlax like any Dean’s seen. They’re docile and
Castiel files it away. “I’m also too hot and cold at once,” he grumbles. It would be uncharitable to mention that the blankets at Bobby’s scratch his skin in an unpleasant manner. But he misses the constant warmth of his Grace, so he needs them, even though they can’t begin to replace that. “I don’t – there are so many – how do humans deal with this, Dean? It’s so
, and if Dean was in a better mood he’d laugh and tell him and his big puppy eyes to fuck off, but right now – it sinks in that Sam’s all he’s got left. Dad died, but this was where they ended up after all. Fuck.
Dean resolves, then and there, that he’s gonna get the hell over the stupid fear of flying he has. Those rattling jet engines on Mistralton planes are decades old and hundreds of miles away. He’s gonna go flying with Cas. And it’s going to be great.
Dean knows nothing about the man who saved him other than that he’s set these stupid, giddy sparks through him. Part of being John Winchester’s son is staying razor-edge sharp on the hunt, but Dean got too damn used to that life, until tonight.
“Nah.” Dean draws a little closer. “Maybe you guys can get some mojo into these thi –” His eyes suddenly go wide. “Oh, shit, Cas.” Apologies are not really in Dean’s nature, even at the end of the world, and those words will have to do.
If anyone would make it through getting captured by either Leviathan or demons or God only knows what, really, it’s probably Frank. Or Alan or Anthony or Craig or Marshall or Russ or whatever his real name was, if it was on any of those IDs at all. Dean knows that. Plus Frank was kind of a weirdo and a dick, like, even for a
He’s in Cas’ lap, and even though his pants and boxers are only just shoved down and not off, he’s trying his best to rub his ass against Cas’ rising erection, both a tease because he can’t resist and a promise he truly intends to keep. Cas’ currently
“It worked.”
His protection tattoo has vanished. Under his jacket, under the shirt, he’s just skin with no trace anyone else was ever there. Warm to the touch with his Grace barely contained in this cage of skin, and cold like marble at once. Jimmy Novak has left this celestial plane, but his body is perfect and whole as humanity can be. Even his hair is relatively neat, bereft of the angry spikes it usually had due to trying to contain his energy and power. It befits an angel.
“Deletion,” Charlie says, a scary serious thread woven through her voice. “People and Pokemon have gone missing around the area where Missingno’s supposed to exist for as long as we’ve got records. Corruption, too.”
They’re totally naked. Together.
The guy keeps staring. For a minute, Dean’s almost sure he’s gonna get on a fight on the friggin’ bus. But then the dude’s Shelgon touches one of her stumpy arms to his knee, and he just shakes his head and looks away. Shuts up for the rest of the ride, though.
They haven’t had time for this, spreading each other out and going slow. Dean luxuriates in anything that’s more than just the two of them hustling to get out of their clothes. Hell, he appreciates that too, but he
After ten minutes of walking, Dean’s about ready to start complaining – not
When she does it, that’s when Dean gets unbearably selfish. She dissolves, and there’s no sign she even exists. Dean feels so goddamn alone.
“Can’t train that into a Pokemon.” Dean still feels itchy around his collar, but despite Charlie and Benny’s obvious familiarity with each other, he fits right in with them. It’s impossible to train Benny’s Herdier’s level of sweetness into a Pokemon; it’s impossible to fake being a damn decent person, like Charlie and Benny, if you’re not.
Psychic-types are no different from other Pokemon; hell, he defended Espeon for years. It’s just a little different when you find yourself face-to-face with a creature that’s six feet high, with a perpetually angry glare.
There’s a knock on his door after one particularly bad night. Dean feels the bottom drop out of his stomach when he all but throws open the door, because he can’t stop believing Cas will come back. He just can’t, like his longing alone could drag Cas back into his orbit. But it’s Uriel who’s glowering at him on the other side of the door.
A wave wouldn’t do the guy justice. For a second, Dean’s struck by the desire to blow a kiss, but that’s more ridiculous than the thought about running away. Instead, all he does is nod, slowly.
Abaddon snaps her fingers at Tentacruel, who floats off toward the rest of the battle. Dean tries to follow their path, because he’s getting a
“Nothing like that,” Naomi continues. “There’s something you need to see. It’s a bit of a ride, but the hotel lent me a large van.” Of course they did. This place is nuts. “I’d prefer if it was just you and your brother, though I suspect you won’t settle for that.”
Dean could watch Staraptor wail on these guys all day, but the Pokemon and their owners are nothing more than cannon fodder. If the big kahunas, people like Lucas and Roman and Abaddon, wanted them eliminated, they’d be gone in a second. He doesn’t feel bad for them; they made their filthy bed. But he does feel bad for their Pokemon.
Friday rolls around, and Charlie drags Dean to a big costume warehouse on their shared off-day. He’s absolutely not surprised to see all the employees already knew her name and apparently got her some, in her own words,
as his back hits, sending chunks of rock to the ground, filling the cave with dust. Because the darkness wasn’t bad enough already.

He’s seriously contemplating how much shit Bobby and Rufus would give him for asking if he could work with them on the weekends, when there’s a knock on his door.
Dean exerts no effort in tugging the top off the first beer, and Castiel thought he found humanity fascinating before, but that was nothing. Before, he had everything else to watch, too; now, he has nothing else but the other human bodies, trapped too tightly to their places by wooden furniture. So he watches the subtle flex of Dean’s arm as he unscrews the top of the beer bottle, and then the long, heavy swallows and how they cause his Adam’s apple to bob easily.

. In his way, he’s screaming for it, loud breathy
sounds like that. He rushes down the stairs, Cas hot on his heels, in the direction of the scream.
“My brave little runaway,” she says, though there’s not a trace of sentimentality in her voice. It’s simply fact.
“I know you’re not gonna… accept anything I’m saying,” Sam tells Dean at last. Dean’s not sure how long he’s been sitting there, eyes still shut to seal him off from the rest of the world; he only knows that it wasn’t close enough to sleep, or oblivion. “But if you ever want to, or don’t even wanna accept it, just talk about it, I’m here.”
“Not bad!” Dean hears Tamara cry out, before he hears the swoosh of her own blade and a
Dean’s suddenly swept up in ecstatic cheering. People he hasn’t even met yet are hugging him, and he’s hugging them all back. He even lets them pick up Vaporeon, lets them cry on her and call her a miracle over and over again, even as he keeps one hand on her the whole time. He watches Anna throw her head up to the sky and let out a goddamn
“I know,” Cas says, sounding completely morose. “I just –” He drops his forehead into his hands, and scrubs his palms over his face. The gesture is so unfamiliar from Cas. “I need some time to think.”
Everyone in there is way too friendly to him. Not just the salespeople, either, but he gets a lot of big doe eyes and pointed glances alike from plenty of customers. He’ll take it as the compliment it is, and ignore the disappointment whenever the eyes that meet his aren’t shockingly blue. Stupid to pine over someone he met once, almost a decade ago, and who he never exchanged more than a handful of words with anyway. The location is making him think of it. That’s all.
She raises a careful eyebrow at him, and Dean’s pretty sure she’s not gonna say shit until he does first. Vulpix takes the opportunity to curl around Charlie’s one bare foot. The gesture’s protective, like Dean’s some kind of
“I’m sorry, Cas,” Sam murmurs at – like, seriously, it’s gotta be like one AM when he hands the coat, still in tatters, back to Castiel. His mouth exaggerates into a frown, again.
As Latias, Anna rams Giratina right back. Latias and Latios aren’t even a quarter of Giratina’s side, but they’ve got agility on their side. Every time Giratina turns to attack them, he has to whirl his entire body around, and by that point both of them have gotten a few hits in and zipped off to find another vulnerable spot on his body. It’s going alright. It’s really going alright –
Staraptor finally cooperates enough to find a permanent perch, and then, in what feels like the next instant, they’re in Cas’ room. The bed here isn’t the question that it was in the nursery; it’s a destination. One they wind themselves down into, tangling together along the way. Dean thinks of the way Vaporeon and Staraptor had twisted themselves up in each other to sleep, but he and Cas are going to do anything
“Raticate?” Dean finally asks, one day. “How’d you end up with that one?”
“Uh, yeah, I work here? Who are you?” His tone is still too snippy.
As for Dean, all he did was gaze into the darkness, him and Vaporeon on Braviary levels of alert. This high up in the tower, the only people trudging around were a couple of mediums accompanied by older ex-trainers, either outright sobbing or looking way too stoic.
It’s not that big a bed. He can stretch out his arm and hit the edge. Doesn’t matter. It just feels too big right now.
“Hey –”
In the next few months, Dean and Cas have their shitty moments, sure. Dean’s learning the hard way, both of them are, that trauma takes
She stuck with him. She saw him at his worst, time and time again, and leaving wasn’t even a question. Pokemon were bred throughout generations to be loyal, but they weren’t stupid either, and survival instincts always won out. There were plenty of stories of Pokemon bolting from terrible trainers and awful situations. That never once happened with her.
Even this much of a dead-end time at night, the night’s lovely. Summer’s just beginning to wane, and breezes curl the air. By now, watching Cas glow and shift and stretch into Latios form, climbing right on his back, and gripping Vaporeon tight as they rise up up up into the air has become almost old hat. The nerves jolt Dean’s stomach, but they soon smooth away to excitement. Exhilaration.
Dean turns around, looking to help Sam. The instant Sam sees him, he lights up, but then his viewpoint drops down to the body Dean has cradled in his arms and that shine dulls immediately. Sam rushes over.
Meg glances over at Dean, pointedly. “I’d think you’d be better at your dirty talk by now, Castiel.”
“Wh-where the hell did you go?” Normally, he’d pretend he wasn’t totally freaked out by Cas vanishing and didn’t yelp Cas’ name into the darkness, as clear a noise as a hammer driving a nail down into wood. But there’s not much point in pretending, not now.
“It’s good to be here again,” Cas tells him, and ever since Lucifer crawled into his brain and got expelled through the power of too many questions about obnoxious pop music, at least he’s gotten better at smiling like a normal person. Not that Cas is in any way normal, or a person.
Point is, they end up driving there. Jack and Kelly stay behind, Kelly promising she’ll find somewhere to stay nearby that’s not the bunker despite Sam and Dean’s offers to let her stay as long as she wants. The rest of them all crowd into the Impala and take off for a couple of days.
The real shock, though, is Tracy and Claire’s presence. They’re chatting very familiarly with Flagstaff, her Garchomp mock-jousting with Claire’s Noibat. Tracy’s Rampardos stands guard over the three of them, snorting when he sees Dean.
Dean’s heart is still shattered, and the fight still rages not twenty feet ahead of them, but he cradles Cas’ cheeks, relishing the stubble that’s so rough under his fingers, and kisses the hell out of him. The wind whips up around them, angry, blowing cold enough that Dean has to move his body in until it’s cradled against Castiel’s. He hardly minds.
“Oh, and Dean? If – when – you get him back. Those emotions I could feel? Maybe talk to him about them.”
Sam’s smirk from here. “Were you watching Cas? He okay?” Sam is pretty understandably not launching forward to hug Anna or anything, but he seems fine for now.
They spend the whole afternoon in the greenhouse, Anna regaling the two of them with utterly hilarious stories from growing up. Dean laughs at them, he genuinely does, but Cas is tending the plants and he finds his eyes wandering toward him.
And in none of these worlds do the other versions of him recognize Cas. Some of them look curious, shocked,
when his brother pressed two fingers to his forehead and whined that Lucifer wouldn’t stop singing “Stairway to Heaven.”
They’re moving in tandem, Cas fucking his lips a little bit now, nothing Dean can’t handle, while he rocks his mouth back, slow and measured and steady. Honestly, he’s really fucking impressed with himself that he’s not just slurping away, considering how much he’s actually uncomfortable with sheer want. Still got his technique, at least.
Cas shifts on the stairs. Dean doesn’t see him move so much, but he
They’re not far from the mall, with the hotel tucked neatly into its side. This was no problem. No problem at all. Dean was worried about nothing.
Dean gets it. Missingno made him feel like something was setting his mind alight even as it stuffed cotton balls in his ears and rocked him to sleep; there was a dangerous yawp in his brain, one that he was willing to give right into. “It’s very powerful. You saw what happened when everything short of a – legendary Pokemon –” Charlie grimaces as she looks at Anna, but Anna offers her a tiny smile and the moment passes – “attacks it. It’s probably guarding… whatever the hell is on here.”
“Because she was trying to help you!” Dean didn’t realize he was practically shouting until Cas’ brows furrow. “Alright, so she had crappy methods. I’m not arguing that. But you gotta see how fucked this whole thing is.”
He can scream all he wants. It’s just a matter of time.
“You sure nothing wants to attack us here?” Dean’s asking, just to be safe, a few — it could be hours, it could be days — later. They should get up and start searching for some way out, but they haven’t moved. Cas’ side, the brush of his coat, the outline of his jaw against the darkness of everything else — they are of little comfort, but comforting nevertheless. The sky’s inky black, which hasn’t changed, and Purgatory’s mostly quiet save the rustle of the undergrowth, the snap of twigs when something steps on them, and the growls of Christ-knows-what in the woods.
“I remember,” Cas says, too quickly, meeting Dean’s eyes and pursing his lips. Well, shit. “It let Pidgey get away. Always was a smart one.”
, of his body already dissipating into the air.
Dean lifts his eyebrows. “The Cas I knew, he had this guy named Jimmy Novak as his vessel. Didn’t know him too well, but nice guy. Liked burgers. His kid’s still out there, hunting if you can believe it, and she kicks all kinds of ass.” Castiel looks utterly unimpressed, and on Claire’s behalf, Dean half-wants to punch the guy. “Jimmy, though, he got blown up by an archangel within the year. He’s – been gone. Got a better life than most vessels.”
shrink. Dr. Zoe Chen’s business card wouldn’t have looked out of the ordinary to anyone who didn’t know, but the embossed anti-possession symbol stamped into the corner gave her away to those in the life.
This time around, though, he just goes right back down on him, fast and hard and his cheeks hollowed in. He keeps his eyes open, and so are Cas’, and even though they’re hooded they’re almost as friendly as Dean’s ever seen them, and of course Cas doesn’t have the common sense to do anything but stare.
“I can imagine it has something to do with me.” If it was possible to funnel your entire voice down to an eyeroll, Castiel would be doing it right now.

Everybody knows that even though it’s on a highway, outside Shopping Mall Nine isn’t the best place to be at night. Most scary stories that get passed around involving Pokemon, they’re kids’ stuff. One of Sam’s classmates who gave him way too much shit over Espeon had told both Sam and Dean that Psychic types could scramble their brains, like it was an excuse; a woman sitting behind the front desk at the entrance to the Nature Preserve frowned at them when she gave them their tickets and told them that too much exposure to Poison types wouldn’t be good for humans, warning them against the wild Gloom and Tentacruel; and there were way too many whispered rumors, everywhere they went, about Dark types turning
. It isn’t always easy, but I know I have to keep going. For everything I’ve done, and everything I need to do. Want to do. And you make it so. I realize now, life’s a
– and some other things I could throw together, and bam. A natural aggressor. I overrode millennia of breeding not to seriously harm humans, or other Pokemon either, with a little cocktail I mixed up one afternoon.”
“Bunch of protesters,” Dean grumbles. The group of students is starting to stream down past the cars and bus. The administrative buildings of Edlund are just past them; they’re probably headed that way. Out the window, Dean spies a Grovyle struggling to hold up a protest sign next to its own, and Dean’s not sure if that’s brilliant or just outright cruel. But he’ll guess this isn’t a protest over Pokemon labor.
For Dean, though, it seemed like paradise. More than that, it seemed like home.
It shakes back and forth once, twice, three times. And then it clicks shut, and the man who threw it is all but squashing it in his hands, a giddy grin across his face. Normally his face would be utterly forgettable, not unlike Lucas Christopher himself, save for the clear eyes that seem almost unbearably cold and the ineffable smugness.
Cas looks right at him, the same gaze that tethers them together. The lights from the television are playing on in his eyes. “Amazing.”
at that, his own skin almost as hot as Castiel’s. “You sure do know how to make a guy feel special,” he says. Always shuffling off actual feelings with humor before they can take root in him too deeply. Best not to get too attached, is what he’s learned, as much as he wants it.
the way Dean swirls his tongue around the little vibrator. He
So, fine. Dean cringes as he does it, but he squats then sits down on the ground. It doesn’t feel any different than other dirt, really, and that’s the strangest thing of all. “Are you my pillow?” he jokes.
“He’s like a damn Magnemite,” Dean hisses to him, staunchly ignoring the fact that he keeps flicking his own eyes up to watch Cas. He doesn’t catch Cas looking back at him, but he’s always got this annoying feeling, like a wiggly tooth, that he just missed it. Staraptor doesn’t hide her constant and utterly withering glares toward Dean, but that’s how she looks at everyone.
“Dean Winchester?”
“Sometimes I wish you’d take your own advice,” is all Sam says before he walks back into the bar. He wipes off his forehead and wills his breath, his heartbeat, to return to normal. That Amarillo night’s still stifling.
of ridiculous staged photos to make the kids running around happy. They’re both way more game for it than Dean would have ever expected, and he finds himself whooping in laughter with Cas at his side. The kids keep hugging Tessa in her Cresselia outfit, and most of them ask to pet Absol’s silky fur too. That’s gotta mean the world to her.
The words hang in the air for a long time, and Dean knows there aren’t any arguments left to make Sam say no. But he’s gotta try one more time, because that’s his brother. Funny, because that’s why Sam’s going to come with him anyway. “I – I just can’t ask you to do this.”
That’s the only words for it, because he moves so quickly, and so on instinct, that he’s got no idea what the hell he’s doing He knows he’s punching a wall until it splinters and fucks up his hand, until the wall’s blurring red, and he knows there are tears all over his face, but he seems so entirely distant from it all. He can’t be in this little shack, no more than a crappy

wasn’t the word for what they are, either.
Cas’ breathing slows a fraction. Dean can tell. Cas likes it, sure, but he’s getting used to it. Dean clicks his tongue and drags the vibrator down, then, to press against his balls.
Dean keeps his back firmly against the seat. Too dangerous to do otherwise.

They’re both doing research – Dick Roman made the cover of

But Dean looks out at the scene in the police station with his arm slung around Cas. There are people he knows – Sam and Amy are crouched down to talk to a couple of little kids, which makes a smile spread so suddenly over Dean’s face it practically clicks on – and those he doesn’t. But that kind of joy he’s found here, the type that bubbles up and fills the room, he’s going to try to chase it for the rest of his life.
When he hears footsteps in the hallway, he tosses the blanket back over his body, because
, but I think he’s figured it out by now. Just needs a little alone time. Our coping mechanisms suck.”
Gravity always hangs over Cas’ face. The dude looks exhausted way too often, especially for someone who doesn’t need sleep. It’s probably dealing with Dean’s bullshit that marks the deep indigo circles under his eyes. But at those words, Dean could swear, something lighter passes over his face. Dean won’t think about it too much. Hope is a deadly thing; he’s gotta be projecting.
Cas’ hand moves at a steady pace, wrist snapping into a twist when he reaches the top. If there’s a generic way to jerk someone off, this is it, but it’s working for Dean anyway. The rhythm picks up when Dean desperately hitches his hips, over and over, pushing him further and further into Cas’ grip and that – oh, that’s
“Not sure,” Dean answered, but he was smiling anyway.
Hannah’s Tropius takes to the air. Along with Dodrio, as far as Flying-type Pokemon go, Tropius kinda suck at actually flying. At least Hannah’s Tropius can keep his banana frond wings spinning; they lift him up like a dumpy helicopter.
Claire is still standing there on the road. She’s so blonde and pale she was nearly washed out, in comparison to this girl and her dark skin and flinty eyes, but they’ve both placed themselves firmly in this moment. He shouldn’t be underestimating any of these kids.
with possession.”
Watching the Woobat settle down to sleep, Dean suddenly notices that his own Pokemon is out of sight. He’s not worried, because she wouldn’t have left the center, but the nursery is huge and there’s still a lot of ground to cover on the floor. Staraptor’s disappeared, too. He turns to Cas and asks, “Where the hell are Vaporeon and Staraptor?”
out at the last moment.
“I don’t know. I – try and stay away from that topic. Hurts too damn much. I can’t think about it too much or I’ll lose it.” He laughs, completely black, before he hears his voice break on the next few words. “But it’s
When Cas was in the bunker and not holed up watching Netflix, he spent a lot of his time sitting up on the top of the slope. From this vantage point, there’s nothing but long stretches of golden field and gnarled trees, as far as the eye can see. The sky, beautiful and deadly at once, it’s a better memorial to him than Dean could ever offer.
He doesn’t know what he’s expecting out of Castiel. But a speech ain’t it. So of course, right before he reaches the portal, he turns around and starts addressing them.
“I wasn’t the one who brought Cas back to life,” Jack continues. “I could have, but by the time I went to bring him back to life, he was already alive. The power of what brought him back to life, plus my unchecked powers – that’s what tore all those holes across the universe. Universes.” He turns to Cas with a big, probably inappropriate smile. “There’s your cosmic consequences, too! I know you were worried about that.”
At any rate, Cas is smiling. Dean’s not imagining that.
Bobby and Rufus and their Pokemon are the better part of a day’s boat ride away, now. But when Dean’s got them all on the screen, he can pretend otherwise.
“I don’t,” he grunts, and he’s absolutely not pouting. “I don’t cuz it
The thing is, Dean gets it. Charlie changing the records in one database – hell, even Charlie gleefully siphoning money out of a bunch of their bank accounts – isn’t going to make anyone able to get in touch with any other regions. It’s not going to make the protests on campus stop. It’s not going to get them the nursery back.
“I wish I knew.” The silence that stretches between them is one long, achy scream on its own. Skarmory’s wings sound so loud; Dean’s never noticed their metallic clicking before.
