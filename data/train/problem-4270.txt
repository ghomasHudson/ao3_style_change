Finally, just as Dean was almost convinced she was going to say no and began starting to think of alternative plans, Meg swallowed down the rest of the wine in her glass, smacked her lips, and nodded.
, your essence or being or whatever,” Dean argued, fingers tightening over Cas’s. “Wouldn’t that, I don’t know, hurt you or lessen you? I’m not gonna do that to you, Cas.”
Then Sam yelped and grabbed for his tray as Dean surged up, his tray held securely in his hands. Nearly running, Dean headed to the truck where the pies were sold, grabbed three boxes, and headed back to the bench. He all but threw two of them at Sam and started packing away his pie slices.
“I am glad to see you, Dean, even if you have passed to Heaven. What about Sam? Is he here?” Cas asked, making no move to remove his hand.
“Dean, you shouldn’t be here,” Cas said urgently, sneaking another glance at Meg. “You have to get out of here.”
“That... Cas... no,” Dean shook his head at how dense they both were. Then he closed the distance between them and cupped Cas’s face. “I’m sorry. I hurt you and I’m so sorry. You can have what you want. You can have me. I love you, Cas. I’m sorry it took me so long to say it.”
By this point, about ten of the vamps had been killed. The screamer was number eleven as Jody swept her machete through the air in a single arc, severing his head. As it rolled across the floor, rumblings and rustlings sounded in the warehouse as the vamps woke. After that, it was a fight for their lives.
“I do too,” Dean said quietly. He reached into another drawer in his nightstand, pulling out a silver ring he hadn’t worn in a long time. He took Cas’s left hand and slipped it onto his finger. “Cas Winchester. Mine now, no takebacks.”
“Maybe all he needs is time,” Eileen continued, pressing a kiss to the top of Sam’s head. She smiled at being able to reach it since he was sitting. “All we can do is be here when he needs it.”
"Forever," Dean repeated, the word feeling like a benediction in his mouth. He captured Cas's mouth again in a deeper kiss, smiling the whole time.
“Of course, Cas, of course I’d find a way,” Dean replied. He stepped closer to Cas, something in his chest dropping when Cas took another step away. Taking a deep breath, Dean continued, “Hey, look, I’ve been thinking about what you said. Before the Empty took you. About how the one thing you want, you can’t have.”
They dropped the boys off at their grandparents' house after checking in with their mother. She was still in the hospital, a nurse speaking for her over the phone. After reassuring the boys they'd be okay and their mom would be home soon, they made their tired way back to the bunker. Back home.
Dean didn’t jump, hearing the familiar voice speak those familiar words. Instead, he opened his eyes, turned to the person sitting in the passenger seat of the Impala, and smiled. The final weight in his chest fell away in a burst of absolute love as Cas smiled back with that tender, soft expression Dean had memorized.
Dean read the two lines written below the last paragraph of this chapter. They were all by themselves, as if arranged as a couplet. They appeared to be nonsense at first glance and Dean’s heart sank. Until he read them through again. They were familiar, somehow. A third time and he was starting to get the shape of the language. It was Enochian, but almost an archaic version compared to the few times he’d heard Cas speak it. It was a spell. It was the spell he needed. A fourth time and a plan formed in his mind.
They didn’t leave their room until hunger drove them out in the afternoon. And both were too blissfully happy as they ate to notice Sam’s knowing looks at the ring Cas was wearing or Sam gesturing to Eileen. Their eyes were full of each other, now bound through Cas’s grace.
"Hell, Cas, this isn't easy for me," Dean said, panic spiking as Cas moved away. He moved a few steps closer, hand rubbing the back of his neck again. "I know I'm not obligated, to use your words, but I have things to say too. Everything happened so fast and, fuck it, I thought angels couldn't even feel emotions like humans. Love, in general terms, yeah. But being
Dean bristled at those words but managed to keep the angry words behind his teeth. To stall for a moment, his mind desperately rearranging pieces of information, he made a show of walking around Meg in her throne and studying her. The Empty didn’t quite preen under his gaze but she held herself as if posing for an admirer.
Taking a deep breath, Sam bowed his head and closed his eyes. It had been a long time since he'd done this, an even longer time since he'd believed it might make a difference. But it didn't matter now, when Dean's life was in the balance. Sam would try anything.
Dean trailed off as a forkful of key lime smacked him in the face. Eileen nearly fell off the bench laughing and had to catch her slices before they fell off her lap. Sam laughed as Dean wiped the forkful off his face. Then laughed again as Dean shrugged and ate it.
Two long moments passed in absolute silence. Nothing appeared, no miracle happened. The rebar was still in Dean's back and he could feel the seconds trickling away as blood slowly dripped from the wound. He started to shake his head, opening his mouth to offer... comfort, reassurance,
“Here,” Sam said, handing the stone to Dean. “Once you’re in the Empty, that stone should pull you to Cas. I don’t know how, the book wasn’t that specific, but it should. Actually, the book made it seem like any reader should already know, which seems kinda dumb considering people are looking for the spell and may not know everything...”
A few hours later, Sam and Eileen walked into the storage room where Dean had set up the spell. He knelt on the floor, a metal bowl sitting on the spot Cas had been taken. An array of ingredients rested on the floor next to him as Dean read through the spell a final time. Sam held a paper bag a little away from his body. Setting it down next to Dean, he backed away with a combined expression of disgust and longing.
And a year later, it was Sam’s turn to come to Heaven. He was greeted by Dean and Cas, their hands linked as they sat in chairs by a table. A third chair sat empty across from them, three beers still wet with condensation sitting on the table.
“Welcome home, Cas,” Dean murmured. He pressed a kiss to Cas’s forehead. “I never want to lose you again.”
He’d rolled over to see Cas watching him sleep. The brilliant blue of his eyes was dim in the shaded nightlight Dean had plugged into the far corner. It was just too dark in here otherwise. Cas smiled at him as soon as their eyes met, the hand draped over Dean’s waist shifting as Dean moved then tightening into a hug.
Which didn’t make what Sam wanted to talk about any easier. After Dean had drowned in the alcohol so early in the day, Sam finally found the strength to look at the security footage from the room. To see what had really happened, other than the barebones facts Dean had given him. To see that Cas had sacrificed himself to the Empty to save Dean from Billie. He listened to the confession Cas gave Dean, tears blurring his eyes. And when it was all over, Sam could only watch Dean mourn. Now he understood why Dean hadn’t answered the phone. Now he understood why it had taken Dean hours to get to them, why he hadn’t wanted to talk about what happened to Cas. Why he had still worn the jacket with the bloody handprint on the shoulder. Why that jacket now held pride of place on a chair in Dean’s room.
After talking it over with the others, Dean used one of the credit cards Charlie had hacked to buy the bar. He’d had to fake an identity, come up with the required paperwork, but he’d managed it. The building was his. It took another two months of work, Cas a willing helper and Sam and Eileen helping where they could, before Rocky’s Bar opened.
Quietly, Sam and Eileen left the room. Eileen closed the door behind them, a soft smile tugging her lips as she took a last glimpse at Dean and Cas. As she and Sam walked away, to give the two some space, they decided to leave the bunker for a little while. It would be more comfortable for everyone all around if they did. Besides, Dean and Cas deserved some space to themselves for a while. After a quick, joking argument half in sign language and half spoken, they decided to go get dinner and maybe catch a movie.
When Cas opened his mouth to speak again, Dean shook his head and held his finger to his lips in unconscious mimicry of Meg. When Cas's lip curled at the gesture, Dean quickly prayed.
Then, a surprised grunt whooshed from between his lips as Cas threw himself at Dean. Dean wrapped his arm around Cas a second after Cas did the same. And, this time, he doesn’t stop himself from tilting his head into the crook of Cas’s neck, doesn’t stop the tears burning in his eyes. All he could do was hug Cas tighter, grateful beyond words that it worked.
"We just need to get the kids back to their mom," Sam explained. "Then, home, I guess. You're always welcome to come with us, even if the hunt is over."
And while they were hunters, Sam couldn’t stop himself from taking pieces of normalcy. He convinced Eileen to join him on a few morning jogs, Miracle happily panting as she ran between them. They bickered about movie night, joked around with each other, took care of Miracle, and generally started creating a life between the two of them. Each day felt more and more right and Sam couldn’t imagine this happiness with anyone else.
“I heard what he said,” Sam continued, ignoring the warning in Dean’s voice. “He was right, man. Everything you do, it’s for love. You raised me when Dad wasn’t around. You take care of everyone around you. Hell, you sold your soul to save my life.”
“So,” Sam started awkwardly, jamming his hands into his pockets. “I uh, watched the security footage. In the storage room. From... from that day. With Billie. And... Cas.”
Looking curiously at the news for some of the towns surrounding the Bunker, Dean found something that made his lips curl in a small smile. The first in who knows how many days. It was perfect. Just what he needed. And he thought he could convince Sam and Eileen to go with him. Yeah. A pie faire. It actually sounded like fun. And with two days to the event, he had plenty of time to clean himself up and get rid of the everpresent hangover. Hopefully.
Dean woke with an intense craving for hot food and bacon. In what had become a habit, he groaned and scrubbed his hand over his face. Stubble scraped his palm. Rubbing his hand thoughtfully over his face again, Dean decided shaving could wait for another day. Besides, his stomach was grumbling. Also, there was a book he hadn’t had the energy to read last night that had looked promising.
Moans and names spoken like a benediction filled the room now. The sound of flesh sliding on flesh joined them. Dean’s head fell back on his neck as he moved a little faster. His own erection was throbbing now, leaking a little in arousal. But he was too focused on Cas inside him to touch himself. Besides, the ache and the need only added to the sensation.
“Now? Now we wait until your little spell snaps you back home and you stay there,” Meg said, a thread of anger in her voice. “While Cas stays here.”
"I'm glad you told me," Cas said, smiling and tilting his head enough to press a second kiss to Dean's lips, eyes still closed. "I love you."
They stared at each other as the spells settled around them, binding them together, grace and soul. Their eyes glowed blue, Dean’s wide with surprise and awe and Cas’s filled with love. Within a breath, they desperately start kissing again. Cas wrapped his arms around Dean, holding him tight against his chest as his hips continued pumping. Arousal flamed higher and their movements are desperate and needy as Dean rode Cas’s erection.
His eyes were closed, his shoulders slumped, and his hands relaxed at his sides. He looked asleep though the expression on his face wasn’t peaceful. It was pained and wistful and full of longing.
Finally, Dean stopped outside the storage closet/dungeon he and Cas had run to while escaping Billie. He stood there for a few long moments, one hand on the doorknob. He’d tried to go into this room once after they’d come back victorious. He’d stood in the open doorway, staring at the empty space Cas had stood. There’d been an agonizing pain in his chest and he’d rubbed at it ineffectually before slowly closing the door and walking away. That had been the first of many nights he’d found his way to the bottom of a bottle in order to sleep.
The topic settled, they drove back to the bunker in companionable silence. It took a few days but Dean eventually brought the topic up with Sam. His brother was happy for him, a reaction Dean hadn’t expected if he were being honest. But it was a relief, knowing his brother didn’t feel like he was abandoning him. Besides, he and Cas were perfectly well suited for research and knowledge and providing a safe place for hunters.
With a small chuckle, Dean sealed his lips over the slice. They both sighed as Dean started to drink. It was like swallowing ice and lightning, Cas’s grace coating his mouth and throat. As he swallowed in delicate sips, savoring it, his hips started to rock. Cas’s grace coursed through his body like it was mapping every single inch. And Dean swore, as Cas’s grace filled him, that he could feel what Cas felt, could feel how much Cas was into this (as was Dean), could feel how much he
After Sam left, Dean set the bottle carefully on his nightstand. The single drink he’d taken from it roiled in his gut and he found he couldn’t stomach anymore. But it was time to get back to work. He’d had his time to wallow and Cas was still waiting for him in the Empty. Reaching across his bed, his fingers resting gently on the place Cas would have rested his head, Dean prayed. A tear tracked down his cheek as he bowed his head.
He didn’t count how many times he hit the wall, didn’t notice as his knuckles scraped bloody on one swing. He didn’t hear Sam and Eileen come running, didn’t see them standing in the doorway with identical expressions of concern. All he saw was Cas, standing in front of him covered in black goo with satisfaction in his eyes. All he heard was the heartfelt speech Cas gave him before telling him he loved him. All he could feel was the hole opening in his chest as he realized Cas was going to be taken.
As Cas stared at him, Dean leaned forward. He kept his eyes on Cas’s, pausing when their lips were just an inch apart. But there was no denial in Cas’s eyes. Just a growing hope. So Dean closed the last distance between them and pressed his lips to Cas’s. Finally,
Cas laughed as Dean used their join hands to gesture up at the ceiling. Honestly, he’d only heard of the spell being used once. It was something most angels knew about, of course, but not something many wanted to use. Which was understandable. How often did one know, without question or hesitation, that one wanted to bind oneself to another being for all of eternity? Here, with Dean, Cas had no hesitation or doubts.
Inside the room, Dean and Cas were still locked in their hug. Neither seemed willing to let go. Both had tears in their eyes. More tears tracked down Cas’s cheeks, his hands fisted in the back of Dean’s jacket as if he was never going to let go.
Dean felt a blush flame across his cheeks but warmth filled his chest at Cas’s words. It felt strange, but a good strange, to hear Cas say things like that. Not that he was attractive, no. He’d been hearing that and variations on “You’re pretty” for nearly as long as he could remember. But when Cas said it, there were worlds of meaning in the words. He meant it literally and he was in awe. He knew Dean as no one else did, had seen every part of him including his soul. Had seen everything he’d done, knew every regret, knew everything and everyone he’d lost or failed. And still considered him beautiful. It was a miracle Dean often went weak-kneed with gratitude for.
It looked like... a tan mass bunched on the ground. Dean’s heart caught in his throat and he managed to move even faster. He fell to his knees next to the cloth bundle on the ground. Reaching out a trembling hand, he found a shoulder and turned the body over. It was Cas, his eyes closed. Though he seemed to be dreaming, his eyes flickering back and forth behind closed eyelids.
It took a few more months but everyone settled into their new normal. The bunker was running smoothly, as was the bar. Hunters knew to come if they needed help and they often had at least one overnighting in the bunker. Everything was perfect and Dean didn’t think things could get better.
“Whoa, what the hell, Cas?” Dean asked, freeing his hand to press both of them over the wound in Cas’s throat. Though part of him was so fucking tempted to bury his mouth against Cas’s throat and drink like a man given the miracle of an oasis in the desert.
The hunt, while daunting, was familiar. There were about thirty vamps and they’d managed to bring together twenty hunters. While they were slightly outnumbered, it should be enough. They’d all gotten practice fighting vamps, knew the drill. Besides, Sam and Eileen had managed to gather a decent store of dead man’s blood. Every single hunter would be going in with their machete coated in it. Their bullets had all already been treated with it. It should be enough to slow a vamp down enough to behead it.
Then he dipped his head to take Cas’s lips in a lazy, gentle kiss. As they kissed, they scooted a little closer to each other. Now, skin pressed up against skin and shared warmth bloomed between them. It hadn’t taken Dean long to decide, once they’d started this, to sleep naked next to Cas and Cas had decided the same.
“You know, I read a story about you,” Dean said conversationally. He stepped one step closer to the throne but made sure to keep Cas in his peripheral vision. “It helped me find a way here.”
A faint hope took root in the center of the void in Dean’s chest. He turned away from the bottle on his nightstand, stood up carefully, and stretched. Then, with a sense of purpose filling him, he grabbed clean clothes and headed to shower. There was a lot of work ahead of him.
Sam stood outside Dean’s door, his heart breaking. He knew Dean had gone back to his room early yesterday and hadn’t emerged. Looking at his research table, Sam saw the notebook that was never out of Dean’s reach these days and a book tossed carelessly to the side of it. Whatever it was Dean had found, it had driven him even further into the bleak grief that shadowed him.
“Yes, it was dumb. Yes, I should have told you,” Dean said. “But I didn’t. So can you help me? Do some kind of spell or something that helps me find Cas? Or something?”
“Touch me, Cas, please,” Dean begged, pressing sloppy kisses to Cas’s mouth and cheeks. “Need you to touch me while you come for me.”
"Not that I'm not grateful as hell, Cas, but how are you here?" Dean asked. He didn't realize his hands were still holding Cas's coat in a death grip.
“We did,” Cas replied, smiling at Dean so widely his eyes crinkled. “It only took dying. Multiple times.”
“Yeah yeah, you had your fun,” Dean grumbled though it made him happy to see Sam laugh. He picked up the slice of peach pie and held it out. “C’mon, Sammy, we each got the other’s favorite. Just tra...”
"Hello, Dean," Cas's familiar voice filled the barn and the empty hole that had grown in Dean's chest after his death. "Hello, Sam. Jack heard your prayer and sent me to help."
As Dean drank, Cas tugged at his hair as an exquisite pain blurring in pleasure coursed through him. He couldn't help but start pumping his hips again, no longer smooth. He moved in stuttering motions, Enochian falling from his lips in time with his hips as he worked his way through the spell. On the last word, Cas’s eyes flared. Taking a breath, judging that Dean has drunk enough, Cas pulled him away from his neck. The wound healed quickly, disappearing as if it never was.
Dean hung up the phone and pulled Cas in for another kiss. Now that he was able to, oh he was never going to stop kissing him, every chance he got. He pulled back, cupping Cas’s face again and just staring at him.
“How do you feel, Dean?” Cas prompted him, his voice remarkably calm for the way his heart thundered in his chest. It had been enough to know Dean knew he was in love with him. It was enough to save him. But now, was it possible to have more? “Tell me, please.”
“Yeah, oh,” Dean said while Eileen looked between the brothers in confusion. Dean caught her attention and held out the jacket so she could see the bloody handprint on the shoulder. “It’s Cas’s blood.”
At Dean’s feet, Cas started to stir. He groaned lightly, one hand lifting to press against his forehead. In a moment, Dean was on his knees at his side again, helping Cas to sit up. Their eyes met and Cas’s widened in surprise and fear as he looked from Dean to Meg behind him.
If this were a tv show or something, or even just that kind of story, this was the point some kind of song would start playing over a montage.
). But it would be better to be tired than to be hungover. Pie deserved to be savored. He drove, rolling his eyes a little in fondness when Sam and Eileen both crammed into the backseat. Every once in a while, when he glanced in the rearview mirror, he’d see them with their heads together, sharing some story or other. It was adorable. And when Eileen grabbed Sam’s head and pulled him into a kiss, Dean automatically let out a wolf whistle to tease the both of them. Sam glared at him but couldn’t hold it when Eileen winked at Dean.
When they broke the kiss a third time, Dean tucked his head into Cas’s neck in a hug. He smiled when Cas pulled him even closer so that their bodies were pressed against each other along every inch on the bench. Dean relaxed, finally letting go of every bit of stress and tension.
"Stay with me?" Dean asked, moving his hands down Cas's shoulders, his arms, around him to pull him into a hug. He opened his eyes to stare intently at Cas. "Please, Cas. Stay."
“Do you want to explain or shall I?” Meg asked, taking another sip of wine. Her eyes were darkly gleeful.
Dean only shook his head. Sam left, pulling out his phone and staring at a contact he never thought he’d actually use. It was a person Cas knew, who had helped them a few times. Slipping his phone away for the moment, Sam went to find Eileen. Then, he told her everything he’d learned and his thoughts about someone who could possibly help. When her lips pulled back from her teeth in a feral grin, Sam knew she had no qualms at all about reaching out to the contact.
At that, a silence fell over both of them. It was comfortable but there was something tense and anxious in it. But not a bad anxious. At least for Dean. It was the anxious of anticipation, of words burning on his tongue that demanded they be spoken. There was just the tiniest kernel of fear that kept him prolonging the silence. Then he looked, really looked, at Cas’s face.
Calls started filtering in to Sam’s phone and texts to Eileen. Hunters, both from this world and the Apocalypse world, making contact as Jack brought them back. Every time a new voice was heard, a new soul reached out to them, they shared a relieved smile. And when Charlie called, overjoyed that Stevie was back too, Sam couldn’t help but pull Eileen up out of her chair, swing her around, and kiss her.
A heartbeat passed after the last syllable left Dean’s lips. Before he could turn away in disgust, expecting nothing to happen again, a rip appeared on the wall. It was like the rip that led to the alternate dimensions only pure black instead of glowing orange-gold. It spread from the point on the wall Dean had seen the Empty appear. It stopped once the rip was about six and a half feet long.
Finishing the text conversation she was having, Eilleen stood behind Sam and rested one hand on the back of his neck. He leaned into her, taking comfort in her presence. The last of the hunters had checked in, had been directed to call someone if they needed help or a place to stay. Things were back to normal. Or, as normal as they could be.
The room looked the same. They hadn’t had any guests and none of them had needed anything stored in here. In his memory, Dean saw Cas standing in front of him while the Empty appeared on the wall behind him. Saw Cas smiling at him. Heard those three words again. Saw the Empty enveloping Cas, who had that peaceful expression on his face. Heard his sobs as he realized Cas was really gone.
"Thanks, man," it was Dean's turn to whisper into Cas's ear. "I can't tell you how relieved I am you aren't trapped."
He dug through the books, looking for one he’d thought useless. After finding it, Dean grabbed a pen and flipped his notebook open to a mostly empty page. At the top, the words GET IN were written in all caps. Dean opened the book and found the page with the poem on it. Reading it through quickly, Dean realized that what he took for useless words actually sounded a lot like a spell. It was a spell to put the Empty back to sleep. And, if he was right, this would give Dean the leverage he needed to bargain with the thing.
Dean took Cas’s hand in the doorway, twining their fingers together and pulling him closer. He smiled as Cas pulled him into a hug, unable to stop touching now that he could. They shared another kiss before walking into their home, the door closing behind them.
Dragging Cas’s head down, Dean kissed him and poured all of that into the kiss. He could feel Cas start to tremble and grinned into the kiss. Several long seconds later, Dean leaned back and just looked into Cas’s eyes. They shared the moment, Dean no longer feeling uncomfortable that Cas seemed to be staring into every fiber of his being. It was safe and familiar.
After, after Chuck, after saying goodbye to Jack, after heading home to the bunker, Dean doesn’t say a word. He grabbed bottles out of the fridge without looking at them. He wasn’t going to be drinking them for the taste after all. He was drinking them for oblivion. All they had to be was full of alcohol. Heading to his room, he missed the concerned look Sam shot him. He also missed the knock on the door and the joyful reunion between Sam and Eileen.
The use of their full names felt oddly formal but right for this moment. It was a vow, as much as whatever this spell was going to be. They were each other’s and were never going to change their minds.
Nodding, Dean swallowed hard and picked up the knife sitting next to the bowl. There was a black, gummy residue along one edge of the blade. Using a bit of holy water, Dean washed the residue into the bowl. As he did, he murmured a few words in Latin. Then he grabbed the jar of demon blood, pouring it slowly into the bowl while saying other words in Latin. Lastly, he grabbed another jar with a handful of feathers, some dark, some light, some patterned. The last of their stock of angel feathers. Dumping the feathers into the bowl, he spoke another set of words in Enochian.
“Yuri,” Sam explained. When Eileen’s eyes widened in surprise, Sam continued, “He helped with the bullet wound. Sort of. Anyways, he’s kinda like a... librarian? collector?... of supernatural information and stuff.”
“I just need you guys to keep watch,” Dean said, relief coursing through him. He wasn’t going to have to fight Sam on this. Good. “We may have to fight our way out.”
“I love you,” Dean repeated as they broke the kiss. He felt Cas’s lips curve into a smile against his. “You have me. You always have. As for the male vessel thing, well, I’m bi, Cas. Always have been.”
“Cas?” Dean said, squeezing his fingers unconsciously on Cas’s shoulder as he looked out the windshield towards the open road. And possibility.
Then it was Cas pulling Dean in for a kiss, his arms wrapping tight around Dean’s waist as if they belonged nowhere else. Dean went willingly, sliding his hand up in Cas’s hair and twining his fingers through it. This second kiss was still unhurried but hungrier, full of want and need. It went on and on, perfect and delicious. Dean lost himself to the sensation, joy bubbling in his chest. They kissed each other breathless, broke apart to breathe for a moment, then they were kissing again as if nothing else in the world mattered.
“I’ll explain it,” Dean snapped at her then turned to Cas. He caught his breath looking into Cas’s eyes, rejoicing that he was getting another chance to do so. Then, quickly and succinctly, he explained the story and the Empty’s demand.
. There was peace, now that he was done, and he could cry no more. Tension eased in his chest, a tension that had been there since he was four and their father had shoved baby Sam into his arms and told him to run. It was okay now. There was a peace.
into the Empty without telling us? What the hell, Dean? What if you couldn’t get back? What if something killed you there?”
Sam closed his mouth with a snap and huffed out an angry breath. He looked at Eileen and they held a quick, silent conversation. At the end of it, Eileen shrugged. Sam huffed out another breath and shook his head.
Taking a deep breath, Sam knocked on the door. And he kept knocking until Dean answered, grumbling and swearing under his breath. He blinked up at Sam, his eyes bloodshot with more than alcohol. He stood there, waiting for Sam to break the silence.
“Nearly?” Dean repeated, standing up and staring down at the book. “What are we missing, Sammy? Spit it out.”
He leaned down to kiss Cas, rolling his hips in small circles at the same time. Together, they found a rhythm, languid and intimate. Soon, their kisses grew sloppy, their mouths unable to meet cleanly. After pressing a last kiss to the corner of Cas’s mouth, Dean sat up. When Cas reached up to him, Dean laced their fingers together and braced himself. He closed his eyes as he started rocking harder, sliding up and down Cas’s erection. He didn’t see the wonder in Cas’s eyes as Cas watched him, didn’t see the love overwhelming him. But he did feel the strength in Cas’s hands, felt how the angel wasn’t going to let him go. And Dean let himself go and just take and take and take.
"It's impressive, how much you look like Meg, even have some of her mannerisms. Creepy as hell but impressive," Dean replied. Then he leaned down and stared into Meg's eyes in clear challenge. His lips pulled back from his teeth in a smirk. "But we both know you can't handle it. Look at the exhaustion in your eyes, the desperation. You're at the end of your rope."
But it wasn’t to be. What felt like a few minutes later, but could have been an hour or a day or even a month, Dean felt a tugging around his middle. He pressed a hand to his chest in confusion. What was going on? Was something attacking him? Before he could take stock of his surroundings, not that anything was really changing, he felt like he was tugged backwards. The breath left him in a rush as he was thrown back through the rip and into the storage room. He stumbled and caught himself on the chair. The book threatened to fall off but he caught it. It was too precious to lose.
A thought struck him at the same time Sam’s phone buzzed. Dean trailed off, his mind suddenly whirling at a mile a minute. Even if he had found a way to get to Cas, found a way to get him out, he had no way of dealing with the Empty. And he didn’t believe he would be able to get into the place without meeting the entity. But if he had something to trade...
His hand freezing, Dean turned that thought over and over in his mind. It didn’t seem possible. Cas had seemed certain that this was a permanent end for him. But he’d gotten out of the Empty once before. Granted, that had been due to the deal that had gotten him in the end. But still. It had happened before. Surely it could happen again.
Cas looked at the ring, tears burning in his eyes. He knew the significance of the ring, knew that Dean had worn it for years. Knew what it meant for Dean to give it to him. Taking Dean’s hand, the ring pressing against both of their fingers, Cas kissed the pad of each one. He savored the intake of breath after each one, using the gesture to all but worship Dean.
“Now we wait,” Sam signed back before taking her hand again. He needed the comfort and the support and had a feeling she did too.
"Yes, Dean?" Cas asked, tilting his head curiously. And he waited, hope and fear threading through him simultaneously.
“Because he might have a way into the Empty. He texted me a spell,” Sam said, holding out his phone.
“I think... I think I wanna retire, Cas,” Dean said hesitantly. He glanced into the rearview mirror, a spike of fear causing him to make sure Sam was asleep. “That vamp shouldn't have got the drop on me. I should have heard or seen him coming. I could have died and lost you.”
He read it through a second time, staring hard at the words on the page. This had to work, right? This was the closest he’d gotten in far too long. Surely reading them a second time would get him into the Empty’s realm? But as Dean came to the end of the words, nothing at all happened in the room. For a few seconds, silence reigned. Then, the ventilation kicked on with a thump and Dean jumped.
"We both will," Sam promised. He pressed a hand to Dean's shoulder, holding up his other to stop Dean when his older brother opened his mouth to speak. "I have an idea."
Dean let himself linger a bit over breakfast. Bacon sizzling tempted his appetite and his stomach grumbled hungrily again. While things cooked, Dean made himself a cup of coffee and refrained from splashing a little whiskey in it. He had a good feeling about the book he’d found last night. A clear head would be better for it. When the eggs and bacon were done, Dean ate quickly. He swallowed down the last of his coffee as he heard the bunker door open in the distance. He recognized Sam’s laugh, likely to something Eileen said.
There was absolute peace on his face. His lips were quirked in a small smile at the corners and his blue eyes were relaxed. They held such affection as they looked back at Dean, affection that had always been there but Dean hadn’t allowed himself to really see. Now he did and he was kicking himself that it had taken both of them dying, again, for him to allow himself to see. To want with the hope of reciprocating.
They continued to kiss and murmur to each other. Time passed in a slow, liquid crawl, neither in a hurry to move on or even get out of bed. Hands roamed over skin, fingers tracing soft trails over old scars, remembered hurts, freckles, and muscle. Their mouths moved together in what had become a familiar, yet no less thrilling, dance.
Dean froze for a second, looking down at the handprint. It was all he had left. But, it was also the only thing that could bring Cas back. Without a word, Dean pulled out his pocketknife, pinched some of the fabric between his fingers, and sliced a piece of bloody fabric off the jacket. He handed it to Sam without looking at him, unable to bear the compassion he knew would be in Sam’s eyes.
“I love you, Cas,” Dean murmured, his eyes never leaving Cas’s. “I am in love with you and I have been for years.”
“Well, I’m glad for you guys,” Sam said, taking a seat and grabbing a beer. He held it out to Dean and Cas.”To family?”
“I think Sam’s about ready to start,” Cas pointed with his chin as Sam got up and moved towards the wall so everyone could see him. “Time to hunt.”
“Not without you,” Dean whispered, taking Cas’s hand as he helped him stand. “All right. What’s the sacrifice you’d demand so Cas can get out of here?”
After too long a moment, and not long enough if Dean were being honest with himself, Dean sat up from where he'd been cradled on Cas's shoulder. He studied the angel, seeing nothing there that he wouldn't have expected. Cas looked the same as he ever had. Maybe a little more at peace, a little more calm.
Cas tilted his head to the side as he listened to the prayer then nodded. They walked side by side, Dean guided by the feeling of the sigil containing his blood back to the rip in reality. He gestured for Cas to go through first. No way was he chancing Cas not getting through, Cas not getting home. He followed after Cas, taking a deep breath of clean air once on the other side.
Not too long after, but long enough that Sam and Eileen got to bask in their honeymoon phase, Dean and Cas got married. It was a smaller ceremony, just the four of them. Jack met them at the courthouse again, pride filling his face. After his vows, Dean slipped a ring onto Cas’s finger. It was the same one he’d worn for years, still wore when he’d first met Cas. In return, Cas slipped a ring on his finger that was a mirror of the one he now wore. They kissed slowly, savoring the moment.
Complete silence reigned once again. Dean and Cas stared at each other, Cas in confusion and Dean in shock that his plan worked.
He glanced up at Meg when he caught movement out of the corner of his eye. She'd reached one hand out to Cas, palm up. As Dean reached the middle of the second repetition, she turned her hand palm down in one smooth movement. A heartbeat later, Cas's eyes opened. He glanced around, taking in the scene in a moment, his eyes widening to see Dean and Meg together here in the darkness. He opened his mouth to speak when Meg held up a finger to her lips to shush him. Dean reached to the end of the second repetition and paused.
“Hey, Dean,” Sam’s voice came from the phone as Dean switched it to speakerphone. “How did it go? Did you get him back?”
As for when, right now seemed pretty damn good. Sam and Eileen were on a date. For once, no hunts were on the horizon. Everything was pretty normal, for them. So Dean had the bunker to himself, though Eileen had signed to him before they left to call them if he needed them. There was no way Dean was going to interrupt them, though. Not when they were getting a slice of happiness. Besides, he kind of wanted to do this himself. For himself and for Cas.
Some time later, Dean couldn’t say how long as there was no way to tell time here, the small hairs on the back of Dean’s neck stood up. He rubbed his neck, surreptitiously glancing around. The rustlings came and went but, so far, nothing had approached him. Still, that sensation on his neck and a cold chill in his belly told him he was being watched. Maybe one of the angels or demons who resided here or even the Empty itself. He walked a little faster, still praying desperately. He hadn’t come across anything or anyone here but he couldn’t give up on Cas. He had to find him.
“Hey,” Sam said, looking at himself in surprise. He’d been old when he’d died but now he was near the same age he’d been when Dean had died. Then he looked at Dean and Cas’s joined hands and smiled. “I see you guys finally figured your shit out.”
. While Sam dealt with the texts, Dean stared off into the distance, pie forgotten in his hand. He only came back to himself when Eileen poked him.
Dean chuckled, poured a generous dollop of lube into his hand, and slid back so he was sitting on Cas’s thighs. He smeared the lube over his palm, using his body heat to warm it. Then, he wrapped his fingers around the base of Cas’s erection. Slowly, he worked his hand up, making a twisting gesture every inch or so to make sure the lube was spreading. He watched Cas’s face as he did so, drinking in every quiet groan and facial expression. When Dean reached the head, he rolled his palm over it and slid his hand back down Cas’s shaft. At the base, Dean rested his hand in a loose circle around Cas’s erection and just stared for a moment. He could have this now, could have Cas. Could touch and kiss and feel and
Tears stung Dean's eyes as he remembered seeing Cas enveloped in the Empty. Remembered the peace on his face, how his eyes never left Dean even as he was swallowed. Remembered the void losing Cas had opened in his chest before he'd even gotten a chance to process what he'd told him. Or even say anything in return.
“I didn’t think angels felt things like humans did,” Dean continued. He grinned self-consciously. “Looks like I was wrong.”
Yes, this. He'd dreamed of this, of kissing Cas, of feeling his body pressed up against his own. Of telling him how he felt about him and hoping Cas didn't tell him to go to Hell. Or, worse yet, explain all the reasons why Dean shouldn't be in love with him. But those worries disappeared as the kiss stretched, as Cas leaned into it just slightly, as Dean's fingers tightened a little on Cas's jaw. It was unhurried, a timeless moment that lasted as long as either could wish.
Silence fell between them, broken only by the random noises around them. Dean whispered another prayer to Cas in his mind, telling Cas yet again he as going to get him out of here, no matter what. The moment stretched, Meg never blinking as she studied Dean. She tapped one nail on her wine glass in a steady pattern.
“We can do it,” Dean finally said, interrupting the second time Sam started reciting the spell. “Get everything together. I’ll get you the last piece.”
. On a sigh, Cas’s lips opened beneath his and Dean slowly licked his way into Cas’s mouth. The kiss was warm and comfortable and thrilling, everything he’d imagined in the depths of the night when he couldn’t get Cas out of his head. When his want and need were all but prayers screaming in his head.
After finishing his prayer, Dean sat back, eyes still closed. Part of him was terrified Cas wouldn’t show up. Maybe he’d misunderstood what Bobby meant? What if Cas was still stuck in the Empty and all Dean had done was twist the knife that much deeper? Or what if Cas didn’t want to talk to him? He’d admitted his love but what if he’d decided that that was enough? What if he’d changed his mind?
"Yes," Meg hissed. "And several powerful people have broken their promise to me. Don't make their mistake. Cast the spell, Dean. On the second repeat, I'll wake your precious angel. On the third, I'll be asleep. I recommend you be
“I mean, yeah, there’s a spell to help locate someone,” Sam said, dropping the book on the counter and pointing at the relevant passages. “Works kinda like a lodestone, homing in on the person.”
Dean swallowed down the handful of angry retorts he had to that. Yelling at Meg, or the Empty, wasn’t going to get Cas out of here. He had to be clever. He had to think. He had to outsmart or negotiate with the Empty. Cas was depending on him. Dean wracked his brain for any idea, any advantage he might have. And then he remembered the end of the story the beggar woman had told.
“It’s just... that, well, Eileen and I might have found a case,” Sam explained, hunching his shoulders a little. “Something about home invasions and people’s tongues being cut out while the kids are abducted. The last one, the father was exsanguinated.  It sounded familiar so I went back to Dad’s journal. It’s one of his old hunts.”
“Yes?” Cas asked guardedly, tilting his head to the side as he studied Dean out of the corner of his eye.
Dean let out an explosive sigh, feeling a punch to the gut at Cas's words. In Hell, Dean had become something he'd always fought against. He'd broken on Alastair's rack and had, in turn, become the torturer. When Cas had appeared, a shining light so bright that Dean could barely stand to keep his eyes open, he hadn't believed it had been to save him. At first, he'd thought that the light was purging Hell. Cas had seen him at his lowest, his worst, and had fallen in love with him then? The thought humbled him and filled him with so much relief he thought his legs might buckle under him.
But now, Dean felt the first stirrings of hope to go along with the desperation. Day 31 and he was combing through a very old book in one of the dusty storage rooms. It had been stored in a box with a few other books and some artifacts. Though Dean hadn’t paid any attention to the other items after scanning the titles of the books. This book had seemed most likely to be helpful so he’d started with it. The first half of the book was devoted to some pompous-sounding prose, mostly the writer congratulating themselves on the trials and tribulations they’d suffered gathering the information for and putting together this book. There were teasing hints here and there that kept Dean skimming quickly rather than tossing the book back into the box.
“I think they’re gathering because they’re scared,” Sam finally said, cutting into the third round of the circular argument. “Things have changed, what with Chuck being depowered and Jack taking over. Things are quieter, on the monster front. I think they’re gathering together for protection.”
He walked away, giving the two of them a few more seconds by themselves. The two boys were standing next to the Impala, the older brother with one arm wrapped around the shoulders of the younger one. They watched with wide eyes as Sam approached, poised to run if need be.
“I’m listening,” Cas said softly when Dean fell silent. He gently pressed Dean’s hand on his shoulder in reassurance. “What did you want to say?”
“What? I only got one slice of cherry, Dean,” Sam complained but he stared at the peach pie and licked his lips.
Dean turned to see Cas standing a few feet away. But he knew, immediately, it wasn’t Cas. The person before him stood differently, head cocked at a mocking angle to match the tone of his words. There was a gleam in his eyes that Dean would call sadistic. And also a little manic, as if whatever stood before him wearing Cas's face had pulled one too many all-nighters.
“I should have told you then, should have found the seconds before you were taken,” Dean continued, his voice soft and wondering and a little sad. “Hell, I should have told you years ago instead of dancing around how I felt. I’m sorry it’s taken me so long. You didn’t deserve that and I’m sorry.”
"I'm not a typical angel," Cas replied dryly. "I feel. Meeting you, pulling you from Hell and rebuilding you, was the domino that started it all. Everything I've become, everything I am today, is because of that one act. I
“Now that’s a plan,” Dean replied, pressing a kiss over Cas’s pulse because he could. “Let’s go home, Cas.”
A timeless eternity later, somewhere down the never-ending stretch of road, more of Bobby’s words came back. Dean had died believing Cas trapped forever in the Empty. Though he probably should have guessed that Jack would have done something about that. The new God wouldn’t leave Cas trapped forever. Not if there was something he could do about it. And apparently, he had.
"And how do you feel, Dean?" Cas asked, his voice soft. A strange ache filled his chest but it wasn't painful. It was anticipation and hope and nerves and a trilling joy begging to be released.
"That's why you agreed so easily," Dean breathed. "You want to sleep so badly. It's all that matters."
While Dean lost himself in a fever of research, Sam and Eileen did what they could to put the world the hunters knew back together. With the Apocalypse world Bobby, Jody, and Donna, they put together a network for the hunters. Now, no one needed to worry about having their covers checked. Someone would answer properly, give all the reassurance that was needed. Sam found himself one again becoming a de facto leader. It was a role that still didn’t feel comfortable but it felt
Then he let out a surprised grunt as both boys flung themselves at his legs and hugged him tightly. He leaned down to hug them back, letting them cry against him. It was a lot. They'd been through some serious trauma. They cried for about a minute before the sobs and sniffles trailed away. They both hugged Sam one more time then slid into the backseat when Sam held the door open for them. He also tossed them one of the water bottles they kept on hand in the car.
A grin stretched his lips back from his teeth as Dean closed the book and set it on the chair in the middle of the devil’s trap. Then, without hesitation or a backward glance, Dean stepped through the tear into the Empty’s realm.
Then he got up, folded the jacket carefully, and headed into the kitchen. There, he grabbed the book then made his way back to his room. He set the jacket on the seat of the chair, patted it, and left without a backward glance. When he got back to the map room, Sam was holding the lodestone, which glowed a pleasing blue, and was signing with Eileen. They stopped their conversation when they saw Dean.
story. Not ours," Sam snapped, pulling out his cellphone as he started to walk outside. "We write our own story now."
“I don’t want to be... a burden, an awkwardness,” Cas murmured, glancing up at Dean before looking away. “When I... told you how I felt, I did not expect to come back. I know you don’t feel the same so I don’t want to impose.”
"The way I see it, I'm holding the high card here," Dean brandished the paper. "I can put you back to sleep. Let you dream all your little dreams, torturing the dead demons and angels here."
“Charlie and Stevie had a line on a demon,” Sam explained, rubbing his hands on his jeans before Eileen twined their fingers together. “We needed blood for the spell so we bled the thing before sending it on its way. You sure you wanna go through with this batshit plan?”
“Okay, and why is he texting you?” Dean asked. Then took a bite of cherry pie and closed his eyes in bliss.
"I'm so proud of you, Sammy. My baby brother," Dean smiled, holding his head up to meet Sam's eyes even as the effort grew more taxing with each passing second. "I love you, so much. You promise me, promise me you'll live."
The words were simple but woke a longing in Dean’s chest. His car, the open road, and a good song were calling his name. It was Heaven, so of course he’d be able to drive his Baby here. After a nod goodbye to Bobby, Dean slid behind the wheel. It felt perfect, felt familiar, felt home. And turning the key, hearing Baby’s engine roar into life in that so-familiar throaty roar was just right.
The next morning, Dean crawled his way up out of oblivion into a pounding headache and a mouth that tasted like a dumpster. The bottles crowded around his bed, all empty. He was sprawled over his side of the bed though one hand rested where a pillow would lay on the right. Looking at that empty space, Dean swallowed hard. He couldn’t help but think of the head that might have filled that space, the person who might have been lying in bed with him. Instead, fear and confusion had kept him from saying what he really felt. And, when it was too late, sheer disbelief and horror had killed the words in his throat. As he stared, three immutable truths formed in his mind.
While it felt like a bit of a betrayal, Dean couldn't focus completely on research during all his waking hours. Right now, playing around on the internet was occupying his time. He’d go back to research in a little bit. He just needed something silly, something to get his mind off everything. Just for a little while. Just to reset his focus.
“I want that too,” Cas murmured, lifting Dean’s hand to his lips to press a kiss to his knuckles. “So we retire from hunts.”
"Cas, wait," Dean said. He took a step towards Cas, one hand twitching up towards him before he stilled it. "I want to say something."
"But you want Castiel back, of course," Meg snarled, rolling her eyes. But she immediately locked them back on the paper. "Doesn't stop it being loud in here."
He leaned down again, needing to be closer. Instead of letting his hands go, Cas let his arms slide down to the bed. Their fingers were still locked together, Dean’s arms spread out along Cas’s. Cas caught his mouth, licking into it hungrily. With Dean spread over his chest, he wasn't able to move as easily so Cas started pumping his hips. Up and down in long, smooth motions while Dean panted against his lips.
Running a hand through his hair again, Dean glared at the words on the page then at the wall. Part of him was sure he’d just gone on a fool’s errand and that this wasn’t going to work. But the greater part of him wasn’t ready to give up on Cas yet. No. This had to work. It had to.
Dean woke up again to a headache and a nasty taste in his mouth. He groaned and rubbed one hand over his face. He’d only drunk one of the bottles before passing out last night. The other sat on his nightstand, within easy reach. He started to reach for it before a thought oozed out of the treacle his hungover mind had become.
“I’m good, Dean,” Cas nodded, his eyes never leaving Dean’s face. Then his smile faded a little, his expression starting to turn sad. “I had hoped you would have more time before ending here.”
"No. No, you don't get to wear his face. Pick someone else," Dean's voice went flat and angry as he stalked a little closer to notCas while speaking.
“There’s a spell I would like to use, one that requires you to drink my grace,” Cas explained. He dropped the blade to the bed and grabbed Dean’s hands. Then he pulled them away from his throat, the blue-white of his grace lighting Dean’s face, and kissed each palm. “It’s rarely used. It’s one to bind two beings together using the grace. Of course, with angels, it’s a shared thing. Each drinks the grace of the other. But for us, it would only require you drinking mine.”
The night before the faire, Dean managed not to drink anything from the bottle sitting on his nightstand. It was hard, knowing the dreams he was likely going to have (
Slamming closed his notebook, Dean left it sitting on the table and stalked back to his room. It didn’t matter that it was early. It didn’t matter that he’d only just woken up a few hours ago. He was going to lose himself in the bottle on his nightstand. Maybe not come out for days.
“I found a way to get to Cas,” Dean explained, waving the book. “But I can’t find him in the Empty’s realm.”
“Cas, c’mon man, I need you to wake up,” Dean shook Cas, speaking and praying the words simultaneously. “I got us a way out of here but I need you to wake up. Please, Cas, come back with me. Come back to me.”
When it came to Sam and Eileen’s turn to order, they took a few moments to look over the offerings. Eileen ordered a slice of lemon meringue and a slice of blueberry. Sam decided to get the sampler, which was six small slices of whatever pies he wanted. And, of course, he took the last slice of Dean’s favorite cherry pie. But that was okay. As Dean stepped up, Sam and Eileen hovering to the side waiting, they brought out a fresh peach pie. Dean smiled as he ordered the sampler and made sure he got two slices of peach. After paying, the three of them found an out of the way bench to sit on.
Cas held Dean’s eyes for another moment or two. Whatever he saw there must have reassured him because he nodded. Then, he reached over to the nightstand on his side, grabbed his angel blade, brought it up to his throat, and used the tip to slice a small line just above his adam’s apple. Blue-white grace glowed through the slice, haloed by the red mark Dean had sucked into his skin.
. Tasting skin and running fingers over exposed flesh. Taking time to learn each individual curve and angle, pressing a kiss to every sensitive spot.
There was another round of hugs, and Eileen telling Dean he’d better call them this time if he needs them, before Sam and Eileen were hoisting their bags onto their shoulders and heading up the stairs. The door clanged shut behind them and Dean was left with the book and the glowing blue stone.
Dean’s voice dropped to something quiet and intimate as he stepped closer again. This time, Cas didn’t back up. He just listened.
He ate when he needed to, neither caring nor tasting what he put into his mouth. It was all quick things, stuff he could put together and eat standing in the kitchen or bring back with him to his research. He burned with the need to move, to read, to get through every single book and piece of lore stored here in the bunker. The clue was here. It had to be.
Laughing, the four of them walked down the steps to the beach. Above, the sun started sinking towards the horizon, painting the sky in a riot of pinks and oranges and reds. As the Winchesters and Leahys joined the party, everything was perfect in their lives.
In her turn, she shared stories of her and Sam’s life. How they’d married, how they’d made a life together, how Sam had become a nexus of help and research for hunters. How they’d had a son they’d named Dean in honor of the brother Sam had lost and they’d both loved.
Slowly, Sam moved in front of Dean, his phone forgotten in his hand. Tears glimmered in his eyes and his breath hitched in his throat.
Shrugging, Dean stepped back to lean against the counter and took a deep drink of his own beer. It was good, one of his favorite brands. It cooled his throat, dry and scratchy after having almost died. The only reason he hadn't was because of the angel standing in front of him, still staring. The angel who'd poured his heart out in an attempt to save Dean's life. Again.
Cas held him, following him down and cradling his upper body in gentle hands. A cough burbled up from the middle of Dean's chest and more blood flecked his lips. Some spattered on Cas's trenchcoat. That made Dean feel a little guilty. But it was nice being held by Cas, as the seconds of his life started ticking by faster. Dean fisted both his hands in Cas's coat, grounding himself as best he could. His head drooped to Cas's shoulder, the strength in his neck gone.
On a deep, gravelly groan, Cas reached between them and wrapped his fingers around Dean’s erection. Pumping in time with his hips, Cas watched Dean fall apart in his arms. Warmth curled in his belly and his muscles tighten up as his orgasm neared. Finally, when Dean, his eyes still glowing a fading blue, ground his hips down hard into Cas, taking him as deep as possible, Cas’s orgasm ripped through him. Shouting Dean’s name through clenched teeth, Cas threw his head back and rode out his orgasm. His hand never stopped moving on Dean and, within a moment, Dean was coming over his stomach. Their hips slowed, turning languid again as each came down from their orgasm.
Instead of answering, Cas pulled Dean’s head up, kissed him deeply, then rolled him onto his other side. One arm wrapped around Dean’s chest, snugging him back against Cas’s chest. The other rested on Dean’s hip, fingers tracing circles over the crease. Another kiss, this time on Dean’s forehead, and Cas reached into the nightstand next to the bed for the bottle of lube. He coated his fingers, fumbling only a little at the cap one-handed. After dropping the bottle behind him on the bed, Cas dipped his fingers between Dean’s cheeks to trace circles around his rim.
He had a plan. Really. He did. But that plan could basically be summed up in three words: Get. Cas. Back. And, well, anything else was details. Those were the important words. With all the frantic research he’d been doing, with Sam and Eileen’s help, he’d started putting together the barest edges of a full plan. Granted, it was mostly him doing the research. Sam and Eileen were often doing their own thing, spending time with each other. It was something Dean didn’t begrudge either of them. Losing the person you loved hurt like nothing else. For Sam to get Eileen back? That was one of the best miracles Jack had given them.
Dean looked at Cas one more time, swallowed, and nodded. He unfolded the paper, making an effort to keep it as quiet as possible. No point antagonizing the thing wearing Meg's face now.
Following Cas’s directions, Dean drove to a house not far from where Bobby had told him John and Mary lived. It was a comfortable place, with a lived-in, well-loved look that Dean immediately liked. And inside, it was almost like an amalgamation of everywhere Dean had felt was home on Earth. It was Bobby’s house and the bunker and Baby, somehow portrayed but not copied. It felt perfect.
“Thank you for finding a way to rescue me,” Cas murmured. He met Dean’s eyes and flashed a quick smile before looking away.
He swiped claws down Dean’s chest, opening bloody furrows that bled freely. It hurt like a bitch, enough that Dean was shaken for a few crucial moments. He didn’t see the look of triumph on the vamp’s face, didn’t see the fangs descending towards him. But he did hear Cas’s roar of rage and see the angel grab the vamp by the back of his neck and throw him halfway across the room. He saw Cas stalk towards the vamp with deliberate steps, saw as Cas held him down with one hand on his chest. Watched as that hand started to glow and the vamp started to scream. Within moments, a charred shape was all that was left.
Were there holes? Sure. Like how was he going to find Cas once he got there, how was he going to deal with the Empty, would the spell get them back, and, if not, how do they get back? But, well, fuck it. It was Cas and this was the first decent chance Dean had of rescuing him. He was grabbing it with both hands and not letting go.
“No problem. A small vamp nest that kept kids for later feeding,” Sam explained. “We took out the vamps and saved the kids. They’re with family now.”
Then he pulled back and offered Dean a hand. He pulled Dean to his feet in a single smooth motion, his eyes already tracking where the other hunters were in the warehouse. They’d been left behind a little as the others worked their way in, but that was okay. This area was safe for the moment.
“That’s it,” Dean murmured, arching his hips back towards Cas’s touch. “C’mon, I’m not gonna break.”
Dean shot Cas a look that begged for patience. Then he started saying the poem again. As he spoke, Meg's eyes drooped and her head to lolled on her shoulders. As he neared the end, her eyes closed and her head dropped back to rest against the back of the throne. Once he spoke the last word, Meg melted into black goo and pooled into the darkness below them.
. The longer he stayed silent, the more Sam talked. Eileen even joined him, patting Dean’s arm in support.
Then, he stirred the mixture in the bowl with the knife. A greasy, almost anti-glow came from the bowl. Dean picked it up, walked to the wall that the Empty appeared on (and where he'd gotten the residue) and started using the knife to draw a series of sigils in a circular pattern on the wall. Lastly, he used a clean pocketknife to add his own blood to the final sigil, as he would be the one traveling to the Empty's realm. The last part of the spell was a final phrase in Enochian
The bar became just as much a home to Dean as the bunker was. The people he loved come and go and he was never alone. Cas was always by his side, even if he wasn’t able to stay for the whole night. They hired a couple of hunters who got out of the life early and the place bustled.
“If it was you, I wouldn't hesitate to go after you,” Eileen said, looking up at Sam. Sam sighed and smiled at her softly before looking at Dean.
The silence stretched on between them, comfortable and familiar while also fraught with unspoken things. Cas turned the beer bottle around and around in his hands, still not drinking. When Dean's bottle was half gone, Cas finally opened his mouth.
Some time later, still lazily kissing, Cas worked one leg between Dean’s. Their legs tangled together, the long span of Cas’s thigh putting pressure on Dean’s half-hard penis. He could feel Cas against his hip, knew he was getting hard as well. Now, they moved against each other, hips rocking back and forth in languid motion. The friction and pressure were teasing, hard enough to feel but not hard enough to get either off. But that’s not what they were looking for, not right now. They wanted the intimacy, the connection, the love through physical affection.
“It won’t hurt any more than when I used my grace to put you back together,” Cas explained with a smirk that told Dean that, as long as it were Dean, Cas wouldn’t mind a little pain. Might even enjoy it. “Doing that didn’t diminish me and doing this won’t either.”
“Ah, thank you,” Cas said, a touch awkwardly as he stepped away from Dean. “For rescuing me. Thank you, Dean.”
“Mine now,” Cas repeated after he’d kissed each finger. “I’ll get a ring for you, Dean. You should have one too. To show that you’re mine.”
Ater making sure the books and artifacts were back in the box, Dean closed it up and set it back in its place on the shelves. Then, he tucked the important book under one arm and left the room. He paced the bunker for a few minutes, trying to find the best place to attempt the spell. The story didn’t say anything about ingredients or special locations. It seemed all he needed was the words.
“Want you inside me, Cas,” Dean said, burying his head against Cas’s neck as Cas kept the pressure on him. “Need you.”
. It was a whisper so quiet that neither Sam nor Eileen heard. And, as if the word broke a dam inside him, all the rage just drained away. Dean lowered the chair to the floor. Well, pieces of the chair. He’d broken off all the legs and the seat was cracked in half. One of the armrests leaned drunkenly against the wall.
“I love you,” Dean said when they broke the kiss to press their foreheads together. “I love you so damn much, Cas.”
Skimming through it, Dean found that the book referred to a void, a darkness, that contained the oldest children. His heart beating harder, Dean skimmed faster. There was a lot of conjecture in the book. The author seemed to have no idea what the void was or who the oldest children were. Demons, monsters, it seemed that anything might be contained within it. At least, according to the author. As he neared the end of the section on the void, Dean’s heart started sinking. There was nothing really usable at all yet. When he turned to the last page, he froze.
He knelt, holding his hand gently to Dean’s chest. He glowed again and warmth flowed over Dean. The skin knit back together, the pain fading into an odd itching for a few moments before it disappeared. When Cas pulled his hand away, Dean saw an unbroken stretch of skin through the rents in his shirt.
He didn't feel it at first. Thanks to the adrenaline from the fight, the aches from already having been thrown around, and the sheer relief as Sam beheaded the vamp, Dean had no idea anything was wrong.
“I know you healed me,” Dean replied, shooting a warm glance at Cas for his promise to follow him. “I just think it’s time. I want a life of my own. I want a life with you.”
, Dean reached out to touch him. He placed a hand on Cas's shoulder, the mirror of the brand he'd had on his own after being rescued from Hell. The mirror of the bloody handprint Cas had left on his coat after confessing his love for him. Underneath his fingers, Cas was warm and solid and
Here, Dean paused his prayer and swallowed hard. Even now, it was so hard to just speak what was in his heart. All his life, he’d been taught to bury everything but the anger, the righteous anger at things that went bump in the night. All his life, he’d swallowed every emotion but that anger, feeling them burn in his chest as he did. But he had to say it. This was Heaven. No more fighting what he felt. And this was Cas.
“It’s not required, no,” Cas finally answered. He smirked when Dean glanced at him quizzically. “Let’s call it... interesting timing and a wonderful side benefit.”
While the boys shared the water, Sam leaned against the Impala and waited for Dean and Cas. They came out a minute later, walking as close to each other as they always did. Sam snorted to himself at the sight. Yep, everything back to normal. They took their accustomed places in the car for the drive back to town, though Sam noticed even more frequent glances from Dean in the rearview mirror at Cas.
Thinking about it was just something to keep him occupied while the room filled with hunters. There were a few late stragglers, still driving to the bunker. Cas was sitting next to him, their hands loosely tangled together on the table. It was perfect, even if they were gathering all these hunters to go after the biggest vamp nest any of them had ever heard of.
“Well, first, thank you,” Dean said after a few false starts. But as he spoke, the words came easier, drawn out of him like water falling into a well. And he was falling, into the deep blue of Cas’s eyes. Into hope and love. So much hope. So much love. “Thank you for telling me what you did. How I changed you and how you love me because you feel I am capable of so much love. Of how everything I do was for the love of family.”
"Sammy, wait, stop," Dean said, struggling a little to make his voice loud enough to hear. "Don't leave me alone. Not now. I got some things to tell you."
"Dean, Dean, Dean," came from behind him in Cas's voice. But that mocking derision and accent was nothing like Cas's. "Will wonders never cease. I'm being visited by Dean Winchester. How did a human get in here?
“Oh hey, pie,” Sam said, plucking the pie from Dean’s hand and depositing the cherry pie in its place.
When he’d brought that possibility up with Eileen, tentatively and softly in case he was seeing more responsibility granted to him than was actually there, she’d smiled at him and punched him in the shoulder. Then she’d signed that of course he was the leader. He was good at it, took care of his people, and they trusted him. After that, Sam tried not to second guess the position everyone had put him in. He just did his best with it.
"Purgatory," Dean repeated, his voice a little stronger. "That's when I realized... realized exactly how I felt about you. Finally admitted it to myself. Looking for you for a year, doing anything to find you."
"Dean, Dean, Dean. Did you really think there would be a spell masquerading as a poem to put me back to sleep that I didn't know about?" Meg sucked her teeth for a moment then clicked her tongue. "I managed to get it into your world myself. Call me distrustful of God but I wanted a way to put me to sleep to be out there. Just in case."
Making his way to the kitchen, the silence in the bunker told Dean he was alone. A quick glance at his phone showed an unholy hour that he was normally still asleep during. That meant Sam and Miracle, and possibly Eileen, were out on their morning jog. There’d been a hunter staying at the bunker for a few days, to recover from a nasty wound during a hunt, but she’d left yesterday. It was a relief to have the place to himself. At least for a little while.
“I can’t believe they brought out more peach just as you got up there,” Sam said sourly, staring at the two slices on Dean’s tray. “It’s my favorite.”
It had been a month since they’d defeated Chuck once and for all. One month since Cas had sacrificed himself for Dean. Again. One month since Jack had absorbed Chuck’s power and disappeared to go run the universe. Or something.
With an extravagant gesture, she encompassed the space all around them. Then she brought her hands together and clapped sharply once. It made no noise. All of a sudden, the noise around them ceased. She sighed in relief.
“Yeah, I can get behind that,” Dean laughed. He leaned up and pressed a sweet kiss to Cas’s lips. “Was sex required for that? Is that how angels do it, up there?”
“Not exactly, no,” she replied, that humorless smile growing sardonic. “Though I do enjoy wearing her. So dewy.”
The only other fairly clean point in the room was the chair that had a green jacket with a bloody handprint on the left shoulder draped over the back.
"Of course," Cas said, glancing obliquely at Dean. There were questions in his eyes but he didn't seem to expect an answer. "Do you need further help on your hunt or was this the end of it?"
“Well, yes,” Meg answered. She wore an expression of surprise, like she couldn’t understand why Dean was questioning it. “Now you, however, you intrigue me. So quiet, sneaking into my realm like you did. You didn’t make it loud, past that first trip when you yelled a little. So fascinating, watching you search and search and search.”
“We were but are you sure you want us to leave you?” Eileen asked, moving to Sam’s side. She took his arm, making them a unit. “You want us to wait until you and Cas get back?”
Dean and Cas both ignored an increasingly awkward Sam as the hug went on. Several long seconds later, Cas was the first to start to pull away. He smiled at Dean, a small bittersweet smile that went through Dean's chest with a pang.
"Jack," Cas smiled, fond and proud of his son. "He rescued me from the Empty. Same with the others awake. Now that it's quiet again, the Empty has gone back to sleep."
It felt good to laugh. Even if only for a moment. And it felt good to pull into the parking lot near the pie faire and see people enjoying all sorts of different pies. Dean’s mouth watered as everyone piled out of the Impala. An impish sense of mischief overtook him and he murmured to Sam, “Last one in line pays for everybody” before taking off.
“Absolutely,” Cas nodded. He grinned and pressed another kiss to Dean’s hand. “Just because we retire from hunts doesn’t mean we can’t be useful to our fellow hunters.”
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, great," Sam stammered, stepping away quickly from Dean and making a frantic gesture towards him with one hand. "Good to see you, Cas. Really good."
“And it’s my favorite,” Dean shrugged. Then, as if he hadn’t been planning it from the moment he saw them bring out the peach pie, he pointed at the uneaten slice. “You wanna trade?”
Sam and Eileen moved up near the wall, their fingers still entwined. They stare for a few moments before Eileen took her hand back to sign, “Now what?”
He shifted up over Cas’s hips, reached back to wrap his fingers around the base of Cas’s erection again, and slowly lowered himself. He went inch by inch, pausing here and there to get used to the feeling and to tease Cas both. But he couldn’t wait long, needing the feeling of Cas buried deep inside him too much. Finally, Dean sank the last inch. He groaned, stretching his arms up luxuriously over his head as he savored the feel of Cas inside him.
“That I’m the luckiest son of a bitch in the world,” Dean replied. He turned his head to press a kiss to Cas’s palm, mirroring his earlier gesture. “And that I love you.”
Taking one last deep breath, not letting himself think too hard about what he was planning to do, Dean opened the book to the end of the beggar’s story. His fingers brushed over the butt of his gun, reassuring him that he wasn’t defenseless. If guns even worked on something like the Empty. Then, slowly and carefully, he read the words.
A cavalcade left the bunker, cars filled with deadly hunters and the weaponry that was their tools. Donna took the lead in her truck with Dean, Cas, Sam and Eileen behind her in the Impala. The others followed at their own paces, mostly spaced out so that it wasn’t a huge line of hunters following.
Cas shook his head, smiling back at Dean. And if there was some self-deprecation in that smile, well, that was his choice. And even though his hope faded a little, Cas said, "I spoke nothing but the truth, Dean. I needed to and I was happy to have it be my last action. Or so I thought at the time. Standing with you, saving you, was the best death I could have hoped for."
“I wonder if he expected to have this room to himself,” Eileen said. “It can’t be easy, losing a friend.”
That brought a level of pain that Dean remembered from his time in Hell. His held breath was expelled on a whimpering scream. Blood started gushing from the wound in his back. His legs weren't strong enough to hold him up anymore and Dean collapsed to his knees.
A few disparate pieces of information came together in his mind. Suddenly, the poem he’d found a few weeks ago wasn’t so useless. Not if it did what he thought it might. The Empty
Before he could start copying, his phone buzzed. Sam had texted him the spell and added that he and Eileen were going to go get one of the ingredients. Everything else was in the bunker. Dean texted back a quick ‘good luck’. Then he started copying the poem. After he was finished, Dean read through it a few times to make sure it was all correct. Then, he tore the page out of his notebook, folded it, and tucked it safely into a pocket.
Sam turned to see Mary and John, Eileen, Bobby, everyone who’d become part of their extended family behind him. He launched himself out of his chair into the arms of the people he loved while Dean and Cas looked on, smiling and drinking their beers, their hands firmly clasped together.
They spent the day coordinating with all the revived hunters, spreading the word to everyone of who was back and who needed help. Donna and Jody both agreed to act as hubs of information when they called Sam. He was so relieved to hear from Donna that he had to sit down and rest his head in his hands. He’d seen her disappear, had been unable to help her. Had been wrong as to why people were disappearing. And now, they were all back. They were all safe.
"Well?" she asked, gesturing with the wine glass. When Dean didn't say anything, she sighed again and continued, "To what do I owe this dubious pleasure, Dean? And how
Dean said nothing, just studied her for a few tense moments. Like notCas, this is decidedly not Meg. Much as it might wear her face.
So, Dean had reasoned, it was up to him to get Cas back. Jack couldn’t, or wouldn’t, do it for whatever reason. Maybe he just didn’t know how. Maybe absorbing Chuck’s power didn’t give him all of Chuck’s knowledge with it. After all, the kid was only three, much as he might look like he was in his twenties.
you... love him too?” Sam asked hesitantly. He wasn’t sure if Dean was going to answer as the silence stretched on. Just when he was about to turn around and leave Dean to his grief, Dean’s voice stopped him.
. Dean learned the shape of Cas’s mouth against his, tasted his breath, smelled the scent of ozone that always seemed to cling to Cas’s skin. They broke the kiss at the same time, moving just enough to lean their foreheads together. They both smiled, the movement feathering softly over their lips.
“You were the one watching me,” Dean stated. He shook his head. Of course the Empty knew he was here the whole time. Of course. It was just his luck. “So what now?”
Dean turned around to see Meg lounging on a golden throne. She held a wineglass negligently in one hand and she smiled at him. There was no humor in that smile. Dean stood slowly, keeping his hands out to show he wasn’t a threat.
Dean stopped in front of the chair and stared down at the bloody handprint. It was in the same place as the brand Cas had left on his shoulder when he’d pulled him out of Hell. It was all Dean had left of the angel who loved him. The day after they’d come back to the bunker, victorious, Dean had balled up the jacket and thrown it in the corner, unable to look at it. The next day, he picked up the jacket, smoothed it out gently, and draped it over the chair. Then he’d turned the chair so that he could see it from his bed. The handprint was the last thing he saw before passing out at night and the first thing he saw when he opened his eyes in the morning. And now, that handprint would help him find Cas.
“You should take that, it could be important,” Cas whispered, his breath feathering over Dean’s lips.
“I accept,” Cas said simply, turning to Meg. “My grace and I leave here. No strings, no deals, no way to drag me back.”
On the sand below them, hunters and their families lounged or played. Adults, children, those who’d grown up in the life and those who’d been thrown in. Friends, family, and their extended family. Connor and Elizabeth were playing in the waves, trying to dunk each other. Claire and Kaia cuddled on a blanket, Jody and Alex a few feet away talking earnestly with Donna. Charlie and Stevie were debating over a grill, the scent of cooking meat filling the air. It was a good scene. Even Jack had taken a break from being God for a bit and was curiously watching the meat cooking on the grill.
Dean trailed off again but this time, it wasn’t because of uncertainty. This time, he fell silent so he could touch. Sliding his hand up Cas’s shoulder, Dean cupped his cheek. It was the same as he’d done it so many times before, only this time, Cas wasn’t dead or dying or injured. There was no terror here, no worry that he’d lost him. There was only peace and love.
“Well, that’s an easy answer. The only thing worth enough to an angel to leave this place,” Meg shrugged but her eyes gleamed in a way that sent shivers down Dean’s back. “His grace.”
“Yeah,” Sam agreed. He tilted his head up and kissed Eileen, smiling into the kiss. “I’m so glad you came back.”
"I love you, Cas," Dean whispered, his breath feathering over Cas's skin. "I realized in Purgatory, couldn't hide from it anymore. But I'd been in love with you for a long time before then."
His heartbeat picked up in his chest and Dean forced himself to stop reading for a moment. His hands were shaking so badly he couldn’t make out any of the words. Running one hand through his hair, Dean took several deep breaths. This could be another dead end. Look at all the dead ends he’d already worked his way to in this research. It might not even be the Empty the beggar was referring to. And even if it was, it might just be a story that held no help for him. He could hope, yes, but it had to be tempered by the knowledge that this might not help him.
Dean wandered the Empty, lost and confused at the lack of any sort of landmarks. How was he supposed to find Cas in this? He could be anywhere. He could be just out of reach and Dean would never see him because of this pervading darkness. He tried speaking, calling Cas’s name. But his voice was swallowed up, barely reaching his ears. He could hear odd sounds in the distance, shuffling of feet and a murmuring of voices. He wandered for what feels like forever, with no ways of telling time. He doesn't come across anything or anyone though he kept hearing those sounds in the distance.
“It was that,” Dean shook his head and grinned. He kissed Cas again, a little deeper this time. “So, I guess that means we’re, like, angel married now?”
Something twisted deep inside him again and Dean couldn’t bring himself to say anything. Instead, he left Sam standing in the doorway and shuffled slowly to his bed. His headache and general shitty state of being right now wouldn’t let him move faster. He wasn’t surprised when Sam stepped inside the room. Of course Sam would want to continue the conversation.
The other part longed to see Cas again with an intensity that surprised even him. He’d been a constant in Dean’s life for years now, he’d gone against his family and even God for him and Sam, had chosen the Winchesters and humanity time and time again. Dean had come to terms with the fact that he loved Cas some time ago. He’d just believed that because Cas was so different, so huge and cosmic and unimaginable, that he couldn’t feel the same way humans could. That he could love, yes that was clear, but that he couldn’t be
"If?" Meg asked suspiciously but there was an undercurrent of hope in her voice. Then her voice turned mocking again. "Oh, I get it. I give you your angel and you help me go back to sleep. Is that it?"
A week later and Dean still hadn’t found Cas. He’d lost count of the trips he’d taken into the Empty’s realm. To be fair, he wasn’t really counting them in the first place. Each time he went in, he picked a direction and ran, praying to Cas the whole time. Nothing but darkness and muffled silence met him though, each time, he felt someone or something watching him. But whatever it was seemed content to watch. It hadn’t messed with him.
"Purgatory," Dean said softly, looking down for a moment as his resolve trembled. He'd never spoken the words to Cas, never explained. Never told him how he really felt.
“Something of Cas’s?” Dean asked, narrowing his eyes as he thought. “Well, the trenchcoat would work well but he was wearing the damn thing. I think there’s some clothes of his in his room. Hasn’t worn them in a while, though. Think they’d still work?”
They walked out of the room together, the book forgotten on the chair. They walked hand in hand to the kitchen, trading kisses every few steps. They laughed and talked, thrilled and relieved to be back together again. And if it took three times as long to get the burgers ready, neither was complaining.
Dean weathered Sam’s anger, letting his little brother vent for a minute or so. Eileen caught his eyes and signed “You’re an idiot” at him before looking back at Sam to read his lips. Yeah, they really were a good match for each other. When Sam started to repeat himself, Dean raised a hand to cut him off.
“I don’t know,” Dean shrugged. His stomach grumbled and he reached for the sandwich. “Guess I could eat.”
Notes formed slowly in the notebook. If something seemed relevant, Dean would copy it down with hands that shook just a little with hangover. He hadn’t stopped drinking, needing the oblivion alcohol gave him to sleep at night. He’d tried, the same day he’d decided to start the search, to sleep without the crutch. He’d dreamed the entire night. Of Cas, of their last conversation. And worse, of what could have been. Moments of their shared past that might have been more, moments of a future currently denied both of them. Moments that Dean had wished for yet had never allowed himself to have.
“You... the way you push me away, the anger you felt towards me, just... you don’t, do you?” Cas waved his hands a little helplessly. “Besides, I’m in a male vessel.”
The drive back to the bunker was quiet. Sam and Eileen slept, slumped against each other in the backseat. The other hunters peeled away, heading back to their own homes. About halfway back, Sam and Eileen firmly asleep, Cas turned to Dean and pinned him with a mock stern look.
