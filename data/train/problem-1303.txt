“Well, there are enough twats walking this earth.” He pronounced it in an American way just as Rosie had. “It wouldn’t be surprising if people gave them a purpose and used them as decoration.”
Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over. Over.
John looked at him for a long moment. He wanted to say more, but the firm look in Sherlock's eyes probably held him back. Instead, he squeezed his knee gently and then lay down beside him.
He thought of everything John – and his friends, too – did for him in the last few hours and didn’t know how he should even
"Watch me," Irene promised with a smile that was undoubtedly going to bring the opposite of a blessing.
"I'll quit my job at the surgery," John announces one morning over breakfast. Breakfast that only he is having. Sherlock has taken two bites of his toast. "And …"
The pumpkin looked wonderful, scary but happy, and with a candle that Rosie had put inside, it tinted the living room into a soft and cosy atmosphere. John had used parts of the fruit pulp and made delicious pumpkin soup with the secret recipe of Sherlock’s mother. The leftovers had found their way into pumpkin cupcakes with chocolate sprinkles. Obviously, Sherlock was
Mary is lovely. She’s beautiful. Clever. Witty. Funny. He can laugh with her without having to fake it. Well, that is a lie. Without having to fake it too often. That sounds more like the truth.
Sherlock closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He hated all the people working at Scotland Yard apart from Greg; he was an idiot, too, but he was bearable. He knew John didn’t like anyone other than Greg either; and Molly of course, who would be there as well.
John had pulled him into a tight embrace and Sherlock buried his face in the crook of John’s neck, clinging to him as though he needed something to stabilise him and it all overwhelmed him. He didn’t understand how their relationship and how
Sherlock wanted to reply ‘hardly’, but then he decided he shouldn’t. It felt nice that some people were actually impressed by his abilities.
“He definitely taught you the art of seduction very well,” Sherlock teased a little and buried his hand in John’s hair.
No words were able to reach his fragile heart the way they used to do. Over the months and years, he had been building a wall, higher and broader, impenetrable and impregnable – unscalable.
He would lock himself up in his room and let the dam break loose. In a place where nobody would see his weakness. People saw enough of that in him already.
"And when you were counting all those texts I got from Irene, you were, in fact, jealous and not annoyed." It's not a question anymore; it's a statement. John decides to let Sherlock talk. He'll find out soon enough anyway, and he's much more eloquent at putting his thoughts into words.
“Oh come on, you need to get your mind off that stupid paper,” Bill urged his friend. “Once you’ve handed it in, you’ll be able to enjoy yourself. And trust me, you’ll regret it if you don’t turn up. The org team have some pretty great things planned.”
He was lost in the world of honeybees for a while when two feet appeared in front of his eyes. He looked up and into the smiling face of John Watson holding a ball in his hand.
Sherlock hummed and wrapped his arms around John’s waist, trying to hold him tightly against his chest. He never wanted to let him go again, he didn’t belong to the places he went to that weren’t 221B. He belonged
At some point his brain switched off; Sherlock didn’t know if he should be grateful or disappointed. He wanted to remember this moment for the rest of his life, he had to cherish every gasp and every moan John let out when their tongues brushed or what John made him feel like when he took his bottom lip between his teeth.
"You could've waited another twenty seconds," Sherlock chuckles. "It's not like I'm capable of going anywhere." He gestures down to his own erection.
“Sherlock, I’m so sorry,” John whispered, “but this isn’t at all what I’ve been doing these past weeks when I wasn’t here. I would never cheat on you. I
John captured Sherlock’s lips in a slow and lazy kiss, running a hand over shoulder blade and his clavicle. Sherlock reciprocated gladly and wrapped his arms around John’s neck, pulling closer closer closer.
John let Sherlock lead because he knew he was better at this than he was and even though it wasn’t perfect, it was a charming, romantic and intimate moment and Sherlock didn’t want to stop and let go of John again. They were so close their chests aligned and it was amazing.
He didn't mind as long John didn't either, but it was different from walking to the restaurant, which was at least have an hour's walk away, with people turning around to take secret glances, to stare.
"Whoever didn't like showering will certainly start to once they've showered with John," Greg announced, cheerfully raising his beer to his lips.
"Okay," John smiled, seemingly in a similar state, before attacking his mouth again, hungrier this time, taking the lead but always guiding him. He always waited for him to follow, and so Sherlock did, kissing back as best he could.
“No,” John shakes his head. “I got better at it when she thought it appropriate to leave us behind. I felt that when she was gone, I could finally breathe again. But I was so angry with her. I didn’t care what she did to me, but I was angry because she left her own daughter behind. I think I already knew that our marriage was falling apart then. I just didn’t know what to feel. I’ve already tried to save our marriage once, and I didn’t know if I could go through that again. I wanted to try because I was committed to whatever it was we had. A divorce was unthinkable because I knew Rosie couldn’t stay with me. But leaving her with Mary wasn’t something I wanted either. The only thing I knew was that I shouldn’t have cheated on her.”
“I promise I won’t have a heart attack,” John tried and as ridiculous as it sounded, some part of him found it immensely endearing. “It’s boring if you just sit there with your book.”
John smiles, often. So does Sherlock. Their smiles are honest, open, earnest – not forced, not painful, not arduous.
John went to get two buckets, an empty one just in case Sherlock would be sick and one with cold water, as well as a flannel. If he was bringing on a temperature indeed, they would have to find a way to cool him off.
It certainly felt like one. Why else would he object to showing affection in public all the time and suddenly hold his hand and kiss him in front of people on that day? It must have been intentional.
Sherlock stretched and realised his entire body was aching. He felt a bit sore and he had a slight headache, too. Folding back the duvet, he got out of bed and rubbed his eyes.
"It's not nonsense! I– I know what happened. My therapist… is your sister. There is a photo on one of her business cards in my wallet. Look at her and tell me she's not," John says, persistent. It was real. It felt too real to be just a dream.
He showers the next morning, then has breakfast alone. Mary is at work, and he welcomes the quiet. It’s the silence before the storm, though it feels like the storm has already started.
Sherlock gives him a sad smile. John cannot bear to look at that sight of him, so he changes the subject. “What will we do about Mary?”
, he reprimanded himself mentally, but it didn't prevent his body from tensing up a little. He and John saw each other every day, they shared the same bed most nights, they touched – above the waistline – and kissed and fooled around, and it was perfect.
John pulled back a little to look at him – with pupils blown wide, irises dark, like the ocean in a storm. "You still want to?"
When he peeked through the spyhole, his heart stopped for at least five seconds before it started beating so violently that he thought he would faint from dizziness.
He stretched his arm and invited him closer, so Sherlock budged up towards him, resting his head on John’s shoulder and folding his arm around his middle. John’s hand found its way into Sherlock’s hair again, stroking it gently, his fingers twirling a few errant curls. Sherlock wanted him to keep doing this all night, and longer.
Sherlock dreamt of Jim Moriarty. He dreamt of Mary coming out of the shadows. Her grin was horrible. He dreamt of the two of them wandering around his bed whilst he came down from a high, tossing and turning, trying to find a position to alleviate the pain and not finding it. He wrapped his arms around his stomach, digging his fingers into his sweat-soaked shirt.
"Because we … oh, bloody hell." John rubs a hand over his face, sighing deeply. The grip around his mug tightens. "Nothing. Forget it, Sherlock, I don't even know what I was going to say myself."
Sherlock's smile is irresistible. So is that goddamn mouth. Sherlock presses his lips against John's as if he truly were dying in the next few seconds, pouring all that he feels into the kiss. His hands caress John's tear-stained cheeks and then bury themselves in his hair, stroking it in a calming manner. All the while, John can't do much but hold onto him; his coat, his shirt.
Sherlock has already read his thoughts, though. Obviously. “Second drawer,” he tells him. John reaches forward and opens it.
His eyes wandered to the person whose fingers still pressed against his skin. “John,” he whispered, he wasn’t capable of anything else.
»It’s on me,« he told Sherlock and handed him a cup of mulled wine while sipping at his own. Sherlock took a sip and almost burned his tongue.
Rosie, who was sitting on the sofa, watched the two of them from a safe distance between herself and the sharp knife with a smile playing on her lips. “You do, Daddy,” she laughed.
He hasn't written that on his for nothing. It was true. It still is. It's so true that it hurts. He will let neither Sherlock nor Rosie die. So there is just one logical solution …
“I didn’t even notice back then until Mike told me to finally stop staring and just chat with him,” John laughed quietly. “I must have been too obvious ‘cause at some point, he came up to me, asking if I’d be his partner for a group project in one class. The way he smiled at you, you just– You couldn’t resist that smile,” he said, a little infatuated still.
Sherlock presses a kiss to John's forehead. "No need to blame yourself. If she caught it, it's not your fault. I'll check on her, just a moment." With a smile, Sherlock turns and leaves the bedroom, leaving John with a smile on his face.
Well, maybe not right at this moment, he was sure John wouldn't appreciate it in front of the entire beach watching them. But staring was already too much, taking in his flawless, tanned, golden skin covered in soft and thin blond hair. He wondered what it would feel like to let his fingers run over his abs and immediately regretted not having stopped his thoughts a moment ago.
"No, but ta." Again, it's John who answers – Sherlock is already busying himself with the microscope.
Sherlock keeps playing, and although John cannot see his face, he just knows his eyes are closed. They usually are.
“You do; you simply rewrote your memories because she utterly traumatised you when you were children. You said you deleted her after she killed Redbeard– I mean, your friend.”
»I’m not forcing you into anything and if we just carry on living together as friends, I’m completely fine with–«
His chest was heaving as John trailed down to his chest with his insistent tongue, taking one of his nipples between his teeth and making Sherlock hiss in pleasure, silently asking for more.
“I’m sorry, I really am,” John told him and Sherlock saw in John’s weary eyes he was telling the truth this time. At least he was being honest when it came to apologising.
Sherlock was still incapable of producing any sound but a hum. He tilted his head to press a kiss to John’s sweaty forehead and then sank back against the pillow. Its warmth and softness welcomed him and he found himself drifting off to sleep when he felt John move beside him.
John ordered a piña colada for Sherlock and a mojito for himself. They headed to a quieter place then, to have some space from the rest of the visitors. They sat down in the sand near their usual spot.
shut down. Emotionally, I mean. I realise you have to get all computer-like to find all the clues and draw all conclusions, but this is our
“I thought you would want to sleep with me,” Sherlock told him and then stammered. “I mean, not like that, I mean just–“
»It would probably still bother me, but this whole thing wasn’t my idea,« Sherlock informed the older Holmes.
He wants to go in, but then someone jostles him away, barging against his bad shoulder and making him turn around. “Excuse you,” he says, but the man with the cap only turns to look at him condescendingly before he continues to walk away.
He heard several whispering voices, saying things like »Did I have too much punch?«, »No, you didn’t, I can see it too,«, »This can’t be true,« and »Where’s Donovan? She owes me fifty quid now.«
“We’re a centre of attention, love,” John stated the obvious with a chuckle and pulled him through the crowd back to their table.
“Maybe you’ve broken him, Sherlock,” Greg said. “He’s always this mysterious when his skills failed to impress his partner.”
Not knowing what had truly befallen him, he got up and took a long shower to clear his head. He couldn’t let this get to him. He had to regain control so this would never happen again. Losing John because of something as stupid as this was unacceptable. Unbearable. No, he wasn’t going to let this happen.
Did John expect him to move things forward now that he’s taken the first step? Did he really think Sherlock would be good at that? Maybe John didn’t even want this. Perhaps he was fine with how things were right now? After all, he never showed any interest in Sherlock so far.
When he tried to sit up, a sharp pain shot through his head, and he groaned quietly. He brought his hands up to his head, massaging his temples lightly. His arms were aching, too. Jesus, what had he thought he was doing when he swallowed that stuff…
"If we hide for the rest of our lives, people will never accept or respect us. Their sick views will win if people don't challenge them."
“Sherlock …” John answered breathlessly and stepped closer, reaching out to take Sherlock’s hand, but he pulled away and stepped back.
Sherlock stands there, watching. "What about a nice cup of tea to welcome Daddy home, hmm?" he asks Rosie, and she turns her little head around, grinning. "I'll take that as a yes," Sherlock chuckles, and by God, he actually
»I don’t know how much longer I can take this. I want to tell him. I mean there were some intimate moments recently, but that’s it. He knows he’s more to me than just a friend, but … I’m not sure how to … proceed from here and it makes me go mad.«
It’s still unreal, and he has to remind himself a lot of times of the fact that he is allowed to do this now, and so he does. He leans forward to kiss it because he can.
It was dark and John was asleep in the chair beside the bed, but the sound of Sherlock vomiting into the bucket made him jump and get up immediately. He knelt behind him on the bed and ran a hand up and down his back, attempting to soothe him even if it brought little comfort.
John placed a last small peck on the corner of his lips before he pulled back with an apologetic smile. “Sorry, I didn’t mean for it to become so,” he cleared his throat, “passionate.”
He nods towards it. Then his eyes flicker back up to John's face. "Just the one for me," he says, his voice laden with concern John wishes weren’t there, yet he relents. John reaches for the tumbler and pours him a glass.
John already moved to get up again, prepared to do whatever task Sherlock still has for him, but the firm press of his hand against John’s shoulder stops him. “Wh–“
, he thinks, distraught. Despair and frustration threaten to take over him, and he can’t do anything but wait in the darkness that swallows him whole, his sight, his hearing, but not his thoughts. They keep torturing him, cutting, hitting, stinging, striking.
“You should have asked her that,” Eurus remarks, a wry smile on his lips. “She called her Rosamund Mary after all. Not the best way of letting your past behind you.”
it, it’s absolutely beautiful.« John walked towards him and wrapped his arms around him, hugging him tightly. Tearing up a little, he buried his face in the crook of Sherlock’s neck. »Thank you, love. This was amazing, fantastic.«
Sherlock nearly bumps into Mycroft who enters John's room directly after him, eyes trailing after his brother.
“Drowning your problems in alcohol won’t make anything better, honey,” she said, leaning on the counter.
Sherlock let John’s tongue dive into his mouth, meeting his own, touching it lightly at first, playing with it dancing around it. John was a fantastic kisser, almost kissing him into oblivion. Sherlock folded his arms around John’s waist, looking for support so he didn’t buckle under the touch. It was incredible.
“Well, technically, it’s not exactly a favour. Remember when Greg suggested the first one who gets a girl gets to bring her home? That night we all went out to the disco.”
It got dark, but he didn't feel like eating anything. Eventually, his head found its place on his cold pillow, and his eyes fell closed, burning sensitively as though someone had thrown a bucket of salt into them. No more tears would fall, but this one word kept on resonating through his mind, again and again and again, until he fell asleep imagining John's arm wound loosely around his waist and his cool breath faintly against his neck.
»I am happy, Sherlock. I am literally a happy camper because for once, everything is fine and things are pretty much the way I want them to be.«
Sherlock had to resist the urge to lean forward and kiss John’s milk moustache away. Was he just being silly now or was he purposely trying to be provocative?
He feels Sherlock relax into his embrace. "How's Rosie?" Sherlock asks, completely avoiding John's question.
Sherlock’s smile almost breaks his heart into pieces. So does the kiss he pulls him into. John savours it, the soft brush against his tongue, the little pull at his bottom lip, the gentle fingertips grazing over his scalp all the while.
“I should go now,” John says after dinner. They are standing in the sitting room while Mrs Hudson does the washing up she insisted on doing – “Just this once, I’m not your housekeeper, after all!”
“It’s not a dumb idea. You seemed pretty enthusiastic about it earlier,” Greg snorted cheekily. “I thought that’s why you chose that outfit.” John waved a hand at him and turned to Sherlock who already regretted having agreed to this. “He suggested the first of us who gets a girl tonight can bring her back to our place.”
He let out a relieved sigh when he saw John swimming quickly towards him. Another couple of endless minutes in which he tried to stretch his muscle by pulling his toes up towards his body, but the pain simply wouldn’t go away.
A baby's wide grin, her curious eyes attentive to the little elephant held in front of her and her small fingers trying to grip its trunk conjure a smile on his lips. He is frozen in the doorway – losing track of where he is – as his eyes wander over the scene in front of him. There are no steps on the stairs behind him, no heels clicking on the creaking wood, no cups rattling on their saucers and cutlery clattering against porcelain plates as they are being carried on a tray. He finds the smell barely noticeable; just faintly registering it, not paying any attention to it whatsoever.
Slightly more than just somewhat tipsy again, they walked down to the water. Sherlock had suggested he teach John a few basic steps of the disco fox that John could not quite recall anymore. Making use of the music they could still hear from the stage close by, they moved over the wet sand. It was easier to move down here.
"God, look at you," he whispered reverently, hands stroking up and down his shins, his thighs until they came to rest on his hips. Sherlock's eyes locked with John's now, seeing nothing but pure admiration and affection in them. "You're perfect," he told him with his voice hoarse and breathy, pressing kisses to Sherlock's groin and caressing the skin covering his hip bones. Sherlock thought he might burst from anticipation, writhing under the soft touches and kisses, but then John lifted his head and came back up to kiss his temple, his forehead, his cheek. His hand wandered over his pebbled nipple down over his hip bone, hovering, waiting.
He realised he must have fallen quiet for a while because all of a sudden John’s hand came to rest on his knee, squeezing it tenderly. His voice cut through the silence. “Sherlock?”
The gentle scratch of the sponge on his skin feels blissful and too good not to be arousing. John blames it on his longstanding bottled-up attraction towards Sherlock rather than the newness of it all although that plays a part, too.
With that, he disappears through the door which falls into its hinge much harder than it has to. His coat billows behind him as he rushes outside. John barely has time to feel guilty about his sharp, edged words that have cut into his best friend's heart like knives. That's exactly how he feels. Numb. Unable to stop the bleeding. He hates his inability to control his temper, his brain that is always slower than his tongue, but most of all himself.
John wants to hear them all right now, but Sherlock doesn’t seem very comfortable talking about this topic, so John lets it go. For now. “You’ll stay, though, won’t you? Moriarty’s dead. His operatives, too?”
He moved in the rhythm of the music, swaying as the notes enveloped John and him and closing his eyes. The violin sounded different than his own, but the notes sounded very clear and so much more powerful.
“I’m fine,” Sherlock hurried to say to calm her, earning a light kick against his foot. “At least I’m better.”
Mycroft opens his mouth to speak, but John interrupts him again. “Her body was cremated and buried. She–“
John kisses him hard, parting Sherlock’s lips and darting his tongue into his mouth. It’s wet and messy and desperate, but he doesn’t care. “You matter a great deal, too,” he huffs out when they pull apart for air, “you have for so long. I’ve
John came back a few more times; they kept talking about the mundane things Sherlock normally would get bored of quickly. Next year will be John's fifth year studying medicine. He was studying at the King's College in London and shared a dorm with Mike and Bill. He worked in a coffee shop when he wasn't visiting lectures and recently helped Mike's uncle build a gigantic garden shed for a bit of money; that's where he got the calluses. He played rugby when he still found a minute of free time and told him he loved sports in general.
Sherlock blushed when he thought of last night even though nothing happened. Of course it meant something to him, but it was probably nothing to John. If it meant something to him, he wouldn’t act so … normal. He was surely going to tell him it was a mistake and it he didn’t wish for it to happen again any minute now.
John’s feathery touches and his gentle words covered his skin with goose bumps. Soft moans escaped Sherlock’ mouth as the pleasure built inside him, almost threatening to overwhelm him. He brought John closer, but John pulled away just a few inches to look into Sherlock’s read and tear-dimmed eyes.
»Talking of food, it’s ready in about two minutes,« Mrs Holmes said warmly. »So come to the dining room.«
"If you want to? We can stay here, too. It's hot today, and I don't want either of us to get sunstroke," John answered and turned around to grab his bag. "If you desperately wanna play volleyball, we can do that here, too," he chuckled and revealed the ball he had brought with him.
Sherlock looks at John with glassy eyes. "I can't treat Rosie like just another case, like another number. She is way too dear to me for that, if something has happened to her, I could never forgi–"
His heart sank. It turned and twisted and it pounded so hard as if it wanted to jump out of his chest. Maybe Sherlock should let it. He would be better off without it anyway.
Sherlock nodded. They were quiet for a few minutes, enjoying the comfortable silence stretching between them.
“NO!” John screams at the top of his lungs. Even though Eurus hasn't even extended her arm, even though his daughter is still nestled as safely as possible in the crook of her elbow, he feels he needs to interject and do something. Anything.
John’s fingers slowly unbuttoned his shirt and pressed his lips to every inch of newly uncovered skin, trailing his tongue over his left nipple as he pushed the last button through its hole.
He felt her nod. “Good,” she paused for a moment. “I didn’t think he had, but I wanted to be certain.”
grateful for, trust me,” John chuckled and leant up to kiss him, nibbling at his bottom lip for a while before he pulled back with a smile. “I knew this wouldn’t last. I wasn’t even sure if he felt as much for me as I did for him, and even if he did, we both knew he’d have to go back home after the semester.”
“Where are you going, then?” John smiles as his hands get to work on the buttons of Sherlock’s shirt.
Sherlock squinted at him. He couldn’t believe John honestly wanted him to persuade Mycroft to go to their parents’ house for Christmas dinner. »You’re serious.« It wasn’t a question.
He misses the quiet nights at Baker Street, and being aware that it is no longer empty now makes him want to leave this bed immediately, get up and take a cab over there to have the long overdue talk with Sherlock. To shout at him for being such an idiot for leaving him behind. To tell him that he is more relieved than furious that he is back. To tell him that he is the only one he wants in his life as a fixed point in a changing age.
Sherlock’s mouth opened wider and he let his head fall back. Leaning into the touch, he broke the kiss unwittingly. Goosebumps spread across his skin and he shivered visibly.
He does and turns his back to John. John washes his hands before he puts on disposable gloves, kneels down and sets to work. He cuts the gauze accordingly to the size of the wounds, lets them hover a few inches above them to see if they fit before he applies the ointment to every single one of them. Silence takes over for a long while, but when he touches the deep ones that needed re-stitching, Sherlock winces and lets out a strangled noise of pain.
The hint of a smile tugs at Sherlock’s lips. “Thought your deductive skills had improved for a moment.” The smile vanishes as soon as it appeared. “I went back home to check on Rosie every three hours. Worrying about two Watson’s at the same time can be rather – time-consuming.”
Sherlock's chest felt tight, as though he was drowning under the wild waves, pulling him down with their mighty force like they had done a few days ago for an entirely different reason. John wouldn't think any less of him even if they never went any further, but Sherlock knew he would love it like it if they did, and yet a terrible part of him always filled his head with dreadful doubts.
where Rosie's crib was and that they took her so silently … it all points to the fact that it is someone who watched us closely for a while."
Irene began to apply eyeliner steadily, not even bothered by Sherlock’s presence. “Grab the shirt, Sherlock.”
The first time it happened was after a case that was barely a six. Sherlock was standing over the corpse, rattling off one deduction after another, and John stood there, breathless. After three minutes of the deep baritone voice jumping from one conclusion to the next with a connection Lestrade and the other officers had difficulty following, Sherlock proclaiming who the killer was – “You’ve got it form there, Lestrade?” – and then turning around to leave the crime scene, John walked over to him and kissed him … in front of everyone. He could feel their eyes on them. Their blank faces. Their blatant stares. None of it mattered right then. Their lips pressed together for just a brief moment, but it was enough.
“I liked it,” he managed to say. He could feel his cheeks flush at this and the realisation reddened his cheeks even more.
“Thank you.” John accepted it gratefully and drank it slowly, cherishing the pleasant feeling of a non-alcoholic beverage on his tongue. “When are you leaving?” he asked then.
“I didn’t think you had noticed,” Sherlock breathed against his skin, kissing the pulse point behind his ear.
John’s smile widened at the hesitant question and he placed his right hand on Sherlock’s back. Sherlock almost melted into the touch.
He wants to call out, scream for help, but he remains silent. Not a sound leaves his mouth. He shakes his head as if to shake off the drug he's been given. It doesn't help.
The corridor was already deserted when John went running after him. His texts remained unseen, his calls unanswered. Eventually, he simply went home.
Sherlock chose to wear a white shirt and black trousers. Why he spent that much time in the bathroom was a mystery to him, but when he put the second load of product into his hair, he found the answer. To impress the man who wouldn’t notice anyway. He applied his best-smelling cologne for the same hopeless reason.
“No, I’m okay,” Sherlock answered, trying to turn around, but John’s weight pressed him down. He leant forward and ran his lips over Sherlock’s skin.
Sherlock looked at his face, which was unshaved, and more importantly unhidden; he wasn’t wearing a mask. His eyes were piercing and dangerously wild. Sherlock’s heart was beating violently, threatening to jump out of his chest. He hadn’t noticed anyone following him, let alone seen anyone watching him.
John nods, resting his head on Sherlock's shoulder. This is still unbelievable. He cannot stop smiling at the strange turn of events his life has taken. He has never expected Sherlock would ever dare to take the first step, and yet he has, and it is perfect. Finally, they are walking on the right path.
“Not at all,” Sherlock answered and sat down on the bed beside John, leaning just a little closer to catch a glimpse of what John was reading.
Bracing himself for reprimanding words, he lifts his head and tries to hold his gaze, but all Sherlock tells him is, “You had better get some rest, too.”
. In the flat that he'd had to leave before Sherlock was even buried, before the funeral. In the specific smell that his experiments had left, the scent of Sherlock's cologne in the bathroom and his ridiculously expensive shampoo. In the scratch on their kitchen table that he never explained how it got there. In the knife stabbed to the mantelpiece. In the fireplace beneath it that was now cold, no fire burning within, no flames heating up the cold living room that had once been filled with life, clutter and disorder and deep conversations. Armchairs standing in proximity. Their feet almost touching, but not quite; warming up in front of the fire.
He had been desperate. He had gone out to look for John, but of course he wasn’t at the clinic anymore and nowhere else to be found eiher. He’d asked Greg and Molly. Nobody knew a thing. Turning to his brother for help was not a path he was willing to take, so he had returned to 221B without any luck and an aching heart, pounding hard with worry. Pacing up and down in their living room and not knowing what to do, he went out to look for John again. Without any luck once more.
He slid into his coat and went out, the cold winter air embracing him. With the secret supply of cigarettes in his pockets, he stayed out all night.
John leant up for a lingering kiss, nibbling at his bottom lip for a moment and murmuring "Happy anniversary," against his mouth.
Love could make you do many premature and hasty things. As long as there was no foreseeable end to one’s happiness, everything seemed to be the right decision if it made you feel good at that moment.
“Stop what? Stop caring? About my best friend who just shot up and has lost track of how much he can actually take? Your so called controlled usage has turned into a serious habit and has now reached the point where you just use it all up to – yeah, to do what exactly? Die? Was this what you wanted?” John didn’t intend to bring it up again, but he knew he wouldn’t get another chance to talk about it. “Because proving Moriarty is actually dead certainly wasn’t the reason you did this. You were told he was on every screen in the country
“I love you,” John whispered against Sherlock’s lips, and suddenly, his heartbeat must have skipped several beats before it started pounding forcefully inside his ribcage. It had to be the serotonin, the oxytocin and several other hormones and chemicals he was unable to name right now because John just said he loved him.
John pulled back and peppered Sherlock’s neck with kisses, licks, little bites. His breaths started to come out more quickly, shallowly.
And yet before John can fully process what's happening, he finds himself stumbling backwards two steps as two arms and a cold body press into him, against his chest, asking for an embrace. John does this, surprised but not unwilling, but when Sherlock's trembling body does nothing but quiver in his arms, doubts fill him whether this is right.
Sherlock increased his efforts, swirling his tongue over the tip slowly. Agonisingly slowly, he licked over the slit, savouring the sharp taste in his mouth.
“John,” Sherlock whispered softly, running his fingers gently over his skin, not sure if he should wake him up after all.
He tiptoed to the end of the corridor and quickly opened the door that led back into their winter garden. There was no way to escape anyway; he knew that. It was raining and raging outside. He would have to face John and whatever he had to say, no matter how much it would hurt, no matter how badly it would break him.
»It’s fine,« John smiled at her even though he was a bit annoyed she just walked in on them like that.
“About three years ago. There was this guy from Canada in a few of my classes at uni, spending his semester abroad, and he was– God he was …”
And so it began. Sherlock is undressing John and then batting his hand away when he reaches for Sherlock's buttons, doing all the work himself. Sherlock's mouth and hands and fingers bring John's dream version close the edge every night, except for those when John cannot keep his fingers to himself.
He revelled in the feeling just a little longer before he turned in John’s embrace and opened his eyes slowly, blinking away the blur.
Sherlock,” he said, and his voice was tenderer than Sherlock had ever heard it. “And you could never be just a fling to me.”
Some nights, Sherlock fell asleep with his back to John because it felt good to have John’s nose rubbing gently over the skin on his nape, his breath cool like the summer night’s air streaming in through the window, feeling the warmth radiating from John’s body aligned with his own from head to toe and the tender touches of his fingertips stroking sleepily over Sherlock’s knuckles.
John quickly breaches the gap between them with two large strides, grabs Sherlock's neck and pulls him down for a hard kiss, ending with a loud smacking noise. "Of course I will, idiot," he says affectionately, presses a kiss to Sherlock's nose and jogs up the stairs. He can barely stop himself from blowing Sherlock a kiss before entering Rosie's room to calm her down.
"I'm so sorry, John, it was stupid, I thought it was the right track, I thought she would be there– I–" Sherlock stammers, not daring to step into the living room. He doesn't see any anger in John's eyes, but it is palpable.
"Yes, I suppose that's a good metaphor," John answered. "It's an incredible talent. I read how you state all the facts first here and then come to a conclusion. It seems so simple that way."
“They didn’t tell you that, did they? But yes, I am," John said with a soft smile. Sherlock's lips curled upward. It was funny, really. John liked both, and he had liked nothing, until now. "And no, you don't need to be worried."
With his gentle lips and his cunning tongue he had managed to make him weak in the knees and if he weren’t holding on to John, his knees certainly would have buckled and he would have sunk to the floor.
“I don’t want it to be over yet,” Sherlock whispered, sitting up and pulling John closer, fingers slipping just slightly into his pants to make clear his intent. “I want to see you, too. That’s only fair.”
Sherlock presses a kiss to John's forehead, suddenly growing very quiet and very warm. "I have not known true happiness until you walked into my life, John, ever since you came into the lab at Bart's, you've had … such a huge impact on me." John feels elegant fingers running through his hair, drawing calming circles on his skin. "Molly is a great friend, and she matters a great deal, but she couldn’t be any more than that."
“I’m– yes, yes,” Sherlock stuttered, still processing John was holding hands with him. That wasn’t a very remarkable thing; rather that he was showing affection in public. It was a rare occurrence that Sherlock had learnt to cherish and not question. Sometimes, he brushed his fingers against Sherlock’s side when they lay beside each other on his blanket on the beach, sometimes he ruffled his hair, or pecked his cheek after making sure nobody was looking.
He took a cab to the closest Tesco and got everything they ran out of. Having paid, he realised he still didn’t have a present for John. He would need something really extravagant now. It had to convey how much John meant to him, how much he loved him and that he never wanted John to leave.
"Let's see if they fit me," John smiled softly, and Sherlock got up to retrieve them from his wardrobe.
“Well, whatever you’re doing, mates, I will not miss this invitation,” Greg announced and got up from the bench with his beer.
"That's so like you," John scoffs, not even knowing what he feels at that moment; emptiness, anger, pain, confusion, but most of all guilt about what he says next, "walking out of my life without an explanation."
»I just told you why,« John grinned amusedly. The genius looked so adorable when he didn’t get something even though this was so simple.
John's heartbeat picks up again. Of all places, Eurus couldn't have chosen a worse place. He feels nauseous, lightheaded, dizzy. Despite everything, he says, "What are we waiting for, then?"
When John was looking at him again, Sherlock asked, “So you decided to go on vacation as soon as exam period ended?”
“Both your father and I are very proud of you, Sherlock. You know that, don’t you?” his mother asked him in her overly sentimental tone that Sherlock has never been able to listen to for more than exactly 2.57 seconds before a very inconvenient feeling began to spread through his abdomen.
Sometimes John's eyes were calm as the sea on a warm summer's day – as blue as the sky, gleaming brightly with the sun's reflections; sometimes they were dark and dangerous, his pupils blown wide and his irises resembled a storm raging across the ocean. Right now, they looked like the latter.
changed his attitude towards the public display of affection. Perhaps, he had become braver. Or maybe, he had chosen not to care. Most people did not. After all, they did nothing illegal, so why should they worry?
“What are you even doing there, Sherlock?” he asked, utterly horrified. The state he was in and the way he was holding the knife made him look like a distraught serial killer who did not know exactly what he was supposed to do with the tool in his hand. There were pieces of pumpkin in his hair, creating a nice contrast between the dark curls and the orange fruit pulp.
John's fingers wandered into Sherlock's hair; his thumb kept brushing his jawbone. A quiet gasp escaped Sherlock's mouth when John started to play with a few curls, tugging and twisting lightly. His lips parted wider, allowing John's tongue to sneak in.
He pushes Sherlock onto his back and kisses his way down to his chest, brushing his lips over the skin that now covers the wound of a bullet breaching his torso, an injury that has healed and left a scar behind. It is not the only scar Sherlock's skin bears. They're on his back, omnipresent, always tangible under his fingertips whenever they're intimate. He knows their stories now, the story of each and every single one of them. They are the evidence of all the pain they had to endure, the time they had to spend apart, the people who wanted to come between them but never managed to. To John, they brought regret and guilt as he first saw them when he helped Sherlock recover after Mary shot him. He didn't dare to ask about them back then. He wishes he had; it would have opened his eyes sooner. Sherlock would have been spared the pain through which John had put him in the aftermath of his return to Mary. His own anger would not have been directed at the wrong person. Of course, Sherlock has kept assuring him that every wound had been worth it – the ones he had acquired before his return to London and the ones after. Although John still feels doubt about that, he works hard on not letting it cloud his mind anymore, on believing in the two of them, what they lost and what they gained instead, despite the scars their bodies exhibit now. Maybe they had to be threatened, hurt, bruised, and almost get themselves killed to see what they mean to each other. Perhaps only the risk of losing the most important person in one another's life was the force that cleared their visions and empowered them to overcome their doubts of what they felt and whether those feelings were doomed or not. What mattered is that they're alive, breathing, panting against each other's skin, feeling the hot air between them, seeing the other smile, beam, be happy.
John’s touch was tickling him, so he craned his neck, raising his hands to rest them over John’s. “You’re really ticklish, then?” he asked, a teasing smile evident in his voice.
When they woke a few hours later, Sherlock felt warm all over. His limbs felt heavy and his head light. The sun tickled his skin, bathing him in its soft rays falling through the window.
Sherlock wanted to get up, but his knees weren’t strong enough to stand or even carry him. He felt exhausted and his head was spinning again. “I can’t walk,” he breathed as his head fell against John’s arm.
John tells him about the way she controlled people’s minds, how he was forced to shoot the governor, but couldn’t bring himself to do it, how she played with their minds, too, how lost and scared and desperate he felt when Sherlock was forced to say “I love you” to Molly when Eurus threatened to blow up her flat.
»It’s just– I didn’t expect you would. I mean, you always said feelings and this caring lark, as you put it, aren't much cop. Responding to physical stimulus isn’t something I thought you’d do.«
John carded his hand through the mess of Sherlock's curls. In contrast, the other hand travelled lower, brushing over his neck, his collarbone, down to his chest, taking his nipple between thumb and forefinger and rubbing it between both fingers, making Sherlock hiss at the touch. He broke the kiss to focus his attention on Sherlock's nipple, licking, sucking, biting gently and rubbing his tongue against it, over it, around it.
Sherlock is right. John isn't the only one who suffered from the war, from the injury, from losing people, and yet all he has been thinking about was himself. He hasn't lost everything; he still has Sherlock and Rosie and all the other people who care about him who he keeps pushing away because he cannot deal with their pitying looks in their eyes. At least that's what he's seen in them until now. Maybe it wasn't pity. Maybe it was empathy.
John sucked on the heated skin just above Sherlock’s clavicle, moving his hips faster but still gently nonetheless.
He woke the next morning with his back to John, feeling John’s warm breath brush against his nape and his hand lying on his hip.
, he thought. Except one thing wasn’t. The man had put the gun into the pocket of his trousers, but he hadn't locked it. Either he wasn't scared of it going off, but he didn't seem to be a professional …
"I know you love experimenting on God knows what you get your hands on, so I kept it for you," he said and reached into his pocket to reveal the little plastic bag. "I'm sorry I didn't let you explain, but I was so angry that you haven't been honest with me. And seeing that you seemingly didn't care about what you'd lose, …"
Before long, they lay side by side once more, with John's hand closed around his own and their breaths mingling between them.
John only looked at him, his eyes were unreadable, and it scared him. He couldn't let this moment pass without saying anything. If he missed his chance right now, he wouldn't get another one.
Sherlock nodded and John helped him back into his shirt. He placed various cushions and a blanket in front of the fireplace. Picking Sherlock up, he carried the still too thin man to the inviting batch of pillows and lay down beside him. Sherlock covered them both with the blanket and rested his head on John’s shoulder. Immediately, John’s arm found its way around his body to pull him closer. »Are you in pain when we lie like this?« he asked him.
"I knew there was something about the way he looked at you at your wedding. Or the way you looked at him." Sherlock smiled slightly, but it seemed sad in a way. "I always assumed you weren't interested in men in general, being 'not gay' and whatnot, but when I saw you two on that day, …"
»Seriously, John, just admit you’re cold. We can share,« Sherlock groaned when he noticed John showed no sign of going back to his bedroom.
John lies down beside him and pulls him onto his lap. He shouldn’t be lying on his back with John’s weight pressing down on him. Very bad for the lacerations. This way is much more efficient.
It was ridiculous. One has no control over his dreams. It was not like he could make any conscious decisions when he was dreaming. But he had nodded and so it continued.
Sherlock dropped his hands and raised them to John’s, reaching for his wrists. “Would you,” he swallowed. Should he really ask? “Can you stay here tonight?”
"I'll pick you up at six. That all right?" John murmured against his lips, a smile tugging their corners.
Sherlock’s eyes had adjusted to the light now, enabling him to take in more details. John Watson, according to the shirt he was wearing;
“I rather enjoy her spoiling us,” John laughed and sat down, waiting for Sherlock to do the same before they started eating.
»I’d love to give in to your, as it seems, thoroughly planned distraction, but we have to wrap the presents first,« John murmured, turning his head to lean into the soft brush of lips against the shell of his ear.
John was breathing hard against Sherlock’s neck; the air hot and thick between them. When Sherlock straddled John’s hips – knees pressed against John’s waist – and leant down for another kiss, they both groaned in unison at the friction the movement caused.
A prickling sensation spread in his stomach at the mere prospect of getting to do all the things in bed imaginable with John. He wanted to. Just thinking about it turned him on.
Everyone was going to stare at them. He was aware half of them thought they were a couple and the other half punted on when they’d make out at a crime scene. Sherlock didn’t mind them because he had learned not to care; they were all stupid anyway. But Sherlock did mind if it bothered John, which apparently wasn’t the case. He really seemed to be quite eager to go to the party and he wanted to be there with
When they got back to the others, Greg could not contain his giddiness. “MY BOYS! I have just witnessed the most mawkish moment between you two––”
Sherlock never wanted the song to end. He could keep listening to his flatmate forever. It felt as if John was completely surrounding him now, with his presence, his voice and the wonderful tune sung with so much emotion that gripped Sherlock’s heart like a fist and squeezed it tightly. Everything he did tonight made his heart beat faster as if it’s been doing somersaults.
“Have you?” Sherlock was insistent. This was about trust, and if John didn’t believe him, how could he trust him?
»See you tonight,« Sherlock answered and John smiled so brightly at him Sherlock still wondered how he got so lucky.
"Like that, hmm, yeah, just keep– keep going …," John rasped into his ear, and the roughness in his voice turned Sherlock on even further.
He could only hope for it to pass eventually, so he would be able to spend time with John again without feeling as lost as he did. He used to be blithe and carefree, just taking every day as it came, until something indescribable happened and he began to find himself sexually attracted to John. Sometimes, he wished he could turn back the clock and reverse everything that took place since then, the event itself included. It made his life incredibly complicated and, judging from Mike's advice, he got worse and worse at hiding it, too.
“My mother would be delighted, and you would make the visit much more bearable. Not to mention that I would really … appreciate it,” he cleared his throat, not knowing how to read the look John was given him. Was it an amused grin? “In fact, I’d like you to come … very much."
It was about four in the afternoon when Sherlock opened his eyes again. His limbs were still sore, but he was certain the reason wasn’t the cold but lying in bed for more than half a day.
Did he come to the hospital with the plan of coming in, but then stopped because his anger flared up again? Unable to leave either?
“I know you’re going through a hard time. Just take your time, all right? There’s no need to rush things. Whether it be your grief or this,” she points between the two of them. “Let’s just focus on having a quiet night. Sound good?”
He woke with a start, opening his eyes and breathing heavily. He was in his bed, in his room, in 221B, at home. Everything was fine.
Sherlock watched the little drops rolling down on the glass, chasing each other, touching and becoming bigger drops. It was oddly calming. He closed his eyes after a little while and pulled his knees up to his chest, burrowing the tip of his nose under the duvet.
“Let’s just get it over with! Go on, tell me about her or him. Do they kiss better than me? Are they better in bed? Are they appreciating you more than I do?” There were tears in Sherlock’s eyes
»Everything’s marvellous,« Sherlock grumbled and turned away from him, curling up into a ball like a very distressed child.
“I can’t,– I have to,” he gasped, slightly out of breath. “Take the duvet away, please …” he begged.
Mary takes him home and puts him to bed, and he does precisely that. Retreat into another world, a safer world, a better world where Sherlock strokes over his hair with a concerned look on his face.
“It’s just– people say a lot of things they don’t truly mean in certain situations. It can get quite challenging to distinguish between what they say and what they actually mean. The discrepancy between language and meaning is hard to keep apart sometimes,” Sherlock told John candidly.
"Couples fight," John told him quietly, and Sherlock's heart sank when he heard how broken he sounded. That was his fault, too. "Sometimes about small, meaningless things. Sometimes about crucial ones. But they make up again, too. Sometimes after five minutes. Sometimes they take longer to work through the anger and the pain to see clearly again, but that doesn't mean that they deserve each other any less." He ran his thumbs over his damp cheeks. "If anything, we can only learn from this, right?"
But he didn’t want to decline so he grasped John’s hand, it was warm and inviting, and John led him to the dance floor. All eyes were on them once more that evening, but Sherlock didn’t care because John, his lovely John wanted to dance with him.
He rested his left arm next to his body so John could inject it. John saw the various punctures and marks, but didn’t comment on them. There’d be enough time to talk about it later.
“Yes, I have,” Sherlock answered and cleared his throat, willing away the bad memories. “Just not with the right people.”
»You haven’t seen me at my worst,« John grinned and came over to him to fold his arms around his waist, nuzzling his neck with a smile.
. Besides, you might want to remember that I've apologised many times for what I did. I gave you an explanation which you refuse to accept. I thought your stubbornness succumbs to your reason as a doctor, but apparently, that is not the case."
Could he truly bare himself to anyone again? To John even? After he had outright admitted that he thought he was lying? That no matter if he told the truth or not, what he said wouldn't make a difference and be irrelevant?
“Taking you home, obviously. I wouldn’t want you to be attacked by another robber. Or whatever it was he wanted.”
John feels Sherlock's fingers trailing over his face gently, mapping every inch and every feature of his body, even softly brushing over his lashes. Sherlock is relishing in this moment as much as John is.
He sniggers silently. God, him accessing all these information, that must be what Sherlock feels like when he goes out and deduces stuff.
»I hate Christmas,« Sherlock murmured into the cushion and then turned his face to the side, facing the crackling fireplace in front of them.
Sherlock was doing it right, then. At least until now. The positive reactions spurred him on to try to take in a little more. He lowered his head and kept sucking, endeavouring to keep breathing in and out through his nose in a steady rhythm. One hand slid off John's hip and closed around the base of his cock. This was a lot better. It gave him more control.
“Because nobody else does either obviously,” Sherlock told her as if it were the most blatant thing in the world.
Sherlock turned back onto his back and closed his eyes, running his hands through his hair. Was John embarrassed about what he did? Did he feel ashamed? Did he think he went too far?
His heart beat so terribly fast again when the last notes rang out and John allowed Sherlock another slow turn to end the song. Once the song was over, a lot of people cheered and clapped, others reached for the collars of their boyfriends to pull them down for a kiss. To Sherlock, this felt like a dream world because all he could focus on John’s hand which slipped out of his hand to rest down on his waist, not letting go quite yet. And then he smiled brightly. He never looked more beautiful, despite the light shade beneath his eyes from days not of sleeping properly. Despite the lines around his eyes that seemed deeper now that he was utterly exhausted. Despite everything.
The two of them had spent the evening hours drinking many hot cups of tea because apparently there was no heating engineer available to save them from turning into snowmen, but they would do so first thing in the morning.
Redbeard was there and listened when his parents weren’t or when they wouldn’t understand. With Redbeard, he had felt safe and wanted and most of all understood. He was there when Oma Karla couldn’t be.
"My, my," he says with an exasperated sigh, turning to John. "I would have never taken my brother for the emotional kind. But then again, he always is different when it comes to you, Doctor Watson." He smiles his infamous smile that is supposed to be friendly but too fake to seem anything else but forced. "I have come to see you and wish you well."
"Get these off," he gasped, already reaching between their bodies to shove them down. John, however, met Sherlock for a lingering, heated kiss, slotting their bodies together, rubbing, grinding. Both of them moaned in unison, pulling apart for the briefest of moments, breathing in each other's air. "Not yet," he whispered.
Thankfully, he had already bought the train ticket that would bring him far away from the reality he had to face every day and which was safely folded inside his wallet.
Of course John had done all this before, too, but … never that often, never that caring, never with so much worry and pity in his eyes. Was it pity? Sherlock didn’t know anymore.
John picked him up at 9 pm. To say the least, he looked dashing, but then he needed no clothes to look like that. His intention not to give him a once-over was fell overboard immediately. His hair was gelled backwards, his black shirt was tight, and his trousers fit perfectly. All Sherlock wanted to do was take it all off of him and dishevel his hair.
He undresses her quickly and lets her do the same. When he is stripped down to his boxers, Sherlock has to comment.
John said there was no need to be shy. But there was surely a need to be timid, agitated even. How was he supposed to know what John wanted, what expectations he had?
He can practically feel Sherlock’s quizzical look. “Marrying her,” John explains and looks up at Sherlock. He falls quiet for another three seconds before he continues, “I thought I loved her.”
John blinked once, twice. Sherlock could see John’s brain was being flooded with questions he wanted to ask, but he didn’t dare to ask them. Sherlock didn’t want to push him. He let himself fall back onto the blanket, folded his arms behind his head and closed his eyes because the sun was blinding him.
At that moment, all he cared about was his grandma's approval and the hand that slipped into his own and squeezed it gently.
“If you’re sure,” John let it go cautiously and turned back to his grandma. “He didn’t need much teaching, to be honest. He’s pretty good. His team beat us yesterday.”
John reached into his pocket, unfolded a little sheet of paper and placed it on the table. It was his mother’s Christmas biscuit recipe and those were his favourites.
“God, you’re going to kill me, aren’t you…” John gasped, letting his head fall back against the pillow.
“I felt so guilty. Before you texted, I was about to tell her what I’d done, but then I didn’t. I never told her until–“
With that, he lets his lips sink down onto John's cock. "Oh God!" John moans as his head sinks back against the pillows. Sherlock presses open-mouthed kisses to the tip. John grips the sheets tightly. It's pure bliss.
Sherlock budged over and sought a comfortable position in John's arms. This wasn't what John wanted, he was sure of it. He had expected they would go further tonight after having roamed their fingertips over almost every inch of clothed skin last night and the night before that. He evidently wanted to get things moving. And like the pathetic little thing he was, he fucked it up again.
»Well,« John started, »it’s complicated. I don’t know if he’s actually interested. I mean he seems to be, but there’s always some reluctance and–«
"Yes," Sherlock admitted openly. It was odd; he usually didn't trust other people enough to let them know such an intimate part of him, but somehow John wasn't like those people. He didn't seem to understand, but he didn't appear to be put off by it either. Sherlock really hoped he didn't mind. "If I had to put a label on it, I'd go with this one for now."
Irene still hadn’t given him given the train ticket back, still denied having nicked it in the first place while she had her “oh-come-on, darling” face on with her winks and her apologetic smirk. Sherlock had never befriended a more atrocious liar.
John moaned every time Sherlock focussed his attention on John's nipples. Inconspicuous as the little rosebuds protruded on his chest, hidden behind thin golden hair, they seemed to be so very sensitive that when touched in the right way, they could arouse him even more than stimulating body parts that showed their need to be touched more clearly.
matter,” John said firmly. “You wanted to stay here and you promised me to be honest in return. Don’t you think I deserve to learn the truth?”
“Hey.” His voice was quiet and soft and sweet. Sherlock drowned in the sound of it. “I know it’s all new, but if it’s not good or–“
»Are you okay?« came John’s gentle voice from the door. He’d followed him without Sherlock noticing it.
“Keep your French and rather show your skills on the dance floor, sunshine,” she smirked and winked at him.
His head was spinning and his breathing ragged, but all that mattered was John kissing him, John pulling him closer with his hand cupping the back of his head, burying his fingers in his curls, tugging ever so carefully and gently.
He would rather be told the truth at this instant than find out through other people, their pitying looks and their comforting hands on his back.
Sherlock knew he was lying. He was so bad telling lies, always had been, always will be. “You didn’t visit your sister,” the detective told him matter-of-factly. His gaze was stern and cold. Why didn’t John trust him and tell him the truth? Had he done anything wrong?
“Where?” Sherlock asked and kept licking his lips when John informed him about his apparent inability to eat, but it was still there.
Sherlock didn’t know what made him turn around and fall forward into John’s arms, but he clung to him like a baby clung to his stuffed animal. John buried a hand in Sherlock’s hair, carding his fingers through the ruffled curls and pressing a steady hand against Sherlock’s lower back. He held him close and began to cradle him in his arms after a little while.
John couldn’t hold back the approaching fit of giggles and ruffled a hand through Sherlock’s hair who didn’t find this gesture very amusing. »You know while you’re at it, you could just wrap the rest of the presents, too.«
"I did my best to gain his respect. That's all I'd ever get from him, at least that's what I thought. One night, he came back to the base with a graze. It was nothing, he said, but I took my time treating his wound. To my surprise, we started talking, actually talking, not just giving and receiving orders, and yeah, that was … I wanted to keep listening to his stories. He'd been a major for five years back then and had a lot to tell. I invited him back to mine after I'd finished treating him, and he accepted. We had a few drinks, well … we had a few too many probably, 'cause at some point– don't ask me who initiated it, but after a while, it just happened. He wanted to leave, I wanted him to stay although I'd never done with before with another bloke."
Now things were different. Now he had spent more than seven years with a person who was his partner, his colleague, best friend and lover at once. John was someone he’d always appreciated for his sincerity, his honesty, his reliability and his trustworthiness.
He shuddered once he was inside and closed the door behind him. Once he entered the kitchen to put the shopping away, the cosy warmth of their flat enveloped him and he sighed contentedly.
. Otherwise you wouldn’t be so bloody lethargic and moody!« John countered, visibly angry now. »Is it me? Have I done anything wrong?«
“You’re unbelievable sometimes, do you know that?” she asked, reaching for his sandwich and taking a bite.
“Are you sure about that?” Mike asked. Sherlock saw him staring intently at him out of the corner of his left eye. He raised his glass again.
“The window, then,” Sherlock smiled and got comfortable close to the wall beneath the window. His bed was slightly bigger than average, not forcing them to squeeze into a tiny space.
“Your body isn’t used to it,” John answered. “But it will be. You just need some exercise and you won’t find this uncomfortable anymore.”
Sherlock’s head was buried in one of the books lying in front of the table in front of him when she broached the subject for the n
"Hey, the Bond films are great," John countered, bumping Sherlock's shoulder with his own. "Have you ever seen one?"
John takes up his phone to type out something like "just leave me be," but he fumbles too much and the screen goes all blurry, so he puts it away again. He knows he's had too much, but he doesn't care anymore, not at this point. His phone keeps announcing new texts from Sherlock, but John chooses to ignore them.
Sherlock was certain of it when he felt John’s lips against his own for the billionth time today. It was the day of their second anniversary. Two years. 730 days, 1 hour and 42 minutes since John had shouted at him, screamed even.
Sherlock smirked, knowing exactly what John meant. He wasn't keen on being woken by the heavy and mindless steps and noise that Mike, Greg and Bill would make when they would come home later.
»Not in the last two weeks,« Sherlock replied as he set down his microscope on the living room floor.
John sees a bright light in the distance; as though he has to make his way through a tunnel, reach the end and step into the light, but he all but succumbs to the darkness.
»No, you don’t,« John said affectionately. »You just say that so everyone leaves you alone when you sulk about it, but actually you hate that even more than people surrounding you and making you feel better.«
Sherlock suddenly felt like an idiot. Why did he bring his own mug? John surely didn’t want to spend too much time with him right now despite everything. He cleared his throat once more. »I’ll – be downstairs then.«
John stood there in the distance with a strong hand on a dark shadow's hip. He couldn’t make out whom he held protectively, but it surely didn’t matter anyway. John looked happy; happier than he ever looked when he was still with him.
John began to nibble gently at his earlobe while Sherlock’s hands were buried in John’s hair. “Fuck, Sherlock,” John rasped into his ear and then kissed him messily. Too uncoordinated, too far gone.
John set down the plate of soup in front of him and shot him a look that meant he would sleep on the sofa for at least three days if he didn’t shut up instantly. He simply couldn’t risk that.
He keeps kissing her and helps her with the buckle. She manages to undo the button of his jeans and pulls down the zipper.
With that, he disappeared out of the room, jogging upstairs judging from the steps he heard. There was silence for a moment before he came back down, carrying a small bag and setting him down on the seat beside Sherlock.
He didn’t quite understand why his heart raced faster and faster the further he walked to the door after the bell rang.
Although the aching pulsation in the rhythm of his heartbeat was still present, its severity ebbed away gradually. He wanted to convey his gratitude for John having seen what was aggrieving him, for having seen in him what he had not seen himself.
They stand like this long after Sherlock has stopped playing on John's skin. His forehead comes to rest against John's brow; both have closed their eyes, just
It turned out John was not the best dancer. He wasn't appalling, though, which was a relief and the fact that he was touching him during various stages made up for it. To be fair, this was something he had not seen coming. After the hushed warning spoken in a moment of intimate togetherness on the beach that first time, it had been one of the biggest surprises to have John walk through the town with him with joint hands, let alone kiss him in public, so when John suddenly pulled him closer by the hips during a blues, he sobered within a second.
“What were you up to?” The grin on John’s face almost killed him. It tore up his chest, broke his rips with a loud crack and reached for Sherlock’s heart, squeezing it, crushing it, wringing it out until he was unable to breathe.
“No.” John’s tone is harder and colder than he intends it to be. “What I need is for you to tell me the truth for once in my life!”
"Ahh–" His eyes fell shut as John's fingers closed around his cock and began to move up and down in a steady rhythm. His thumb brushed over the head with every movement. "Fuck," he breathed when John started to run his tongue over that sensitive piece of skin on his neck, sucking gently, taking it between his teeth and very likely leaving a mark behind.
"Your fixation of my being with a woman seems to get a little out of hand," Sherlock comments, and John can't help but laugh because he knows it's supposed to brighten the mood.
"I suppose it was better for safety's sake," John cut in with a hearty laugh. "But you don't care much about that at all, do you? I've seen the proof for that last night."
The fresh air is excellent and makes him forget the all too familiar ache a little, but when he stands on the step of 221B and opens the door, he’s out of breath and feels as if he has run a marathon. He has never been more relieved to be home.
"Oh," John says, "maybe it's your trembling or your sweet little blushing or the fact that your pulse has gone up ever since I stepped behind you."
Swimming used to wear him out when he was a kid, and he realised that hadn't changed even after all those years. He couldn't believe John would make him do something that only children would typically engage in. As stupid as it was, Sherlock had enjoyed it; it had given him the feeling of freedom; he didn't have to hide anything about himself and could let himself have fun without having to fear someone was going to take his happiness away again the next minute. In John's presence, he always had this feeling. Amongst others, as he discerned today.
His lips brush over John's nipple, making John keen quietly as wet heat meats the cool skin where it peaks out. "God …"
"Right." John clears his throat. "That makes sense yet doesn't explain how the hell they got up here in the first place. Jump on Speedy's awning, do the Spiderman?"
“Is this your cologne?” she asked and regarded the little flacon suspiciously, spraying once and smelling. “Hmm, nice one.”
A guttural sound broke loose inside Sherlock’s chest. He was aching, seeking friction. He wound his legs around the small of John’s back, pulling him closer until John repeated the same motion, grinding his length against him.
"Something. Anything. Use your mind palace. Just––" He needs to control his breathing, or he will hyperventilate.
The pace picks up; their pleasure grows more intent and louder. John hits Sherlock’s prostate with every roll of his hips; every thrust. Sherlock clings to him, holding on for dear life. He quivers, trembles and jerks underneath John’s body as he huffs against John’s neck.
“It wasn’t too late, John. You have to stop dwelling on the past,” Sherlock answers, and his voice is calm but insistent.
»Cheeky, are we?« John chuckled and then continued. »She wanted me to have it, though, since she knew Harry was even less musical than me. So I kept it. It unfortunately broke when I moved to London, but I kept it anyway. I didn’t see the point in letting someone fix it until I met you, but you already had a violin. I mean, you still do, but I thought you could make better use of it than I can. I had it mended and … well, I hope you like it.«
The last note rang out quietly and Sherlock closed his eyes. John radiated a sense of calm making him sleepy, but he wanted to stay awake. He wanted John to fall asleep so he might turn around in his arms and face him, watch him sleep, observe every little flutter of his eyelids and listen to every sound he made when he was dreaming. He would memorise every valuable piece of information and keep it safe in his mind palace.
Yes, he was going to tell John what all this was to him. A dream he had been certain didn’t have a chance of coming true and yet it did, the sun that lifted the fog, the light that broke through the darkness and the ceasing of the storm they had to fight in for a long time without a foreseeable end.
“Did you really think I’d ever use again after that horrible night?” Sherlock dared to ask. “You can keep them. Flush them down the toilet. I don’t want them.” His voice was stronger than he expected it to be.
Morphine and cocaine were the two drugs he had used most of so this was what he was going to focus on first. Thanking God heroin was not on the list and cursing the oxycodone, John went back to Sherlock’s bedroom with the bag in one hand, pocketing the shreds of Sherlock’s list with the other.
Rainy afternoons were the worst. The reminders were especially harsh, but somehow, he managed to ignore the dull ache in his chest that felt like little knives probing and cutting and stinging relentlessly. Like the little mermaid walking barefoot on blades. It remained, relentless, with every breath he took, and he didn't know how to stop it.
It's been a hell of a ride but we had so much fun writing this little fix-it, and we hope you enjoyed it. We would love to know what you think one last time :)
John soaked the cloth in the water again and placed it on his forehead. He had never regretted his decision to overdose more than he did in this moment.
Sherlock pushed John's pants over the curve of his arse, pulling them down and off until they joined the pile of clothes on the floor. His fingers explored the small of his back, grazing over little moles before they found their rightful place further down. Kneading the soft flesh gently, John let out a quiet moan, thrusting up against Sherlock.
“Do you know how often I thought of you like this?” John whispered into his ear, a silent susurration. “And when I saw you sneak into the last row at rugby matches, I found myself hoping I’d have the chance someday.”
»So what if he chooses not to come? It’s his decision after all. You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink,« the detective sighed wearily.
“Good.” It would take a little while until the kettle boiled and his food was warm, so she leant against the counter and waited. “Tell me about him,” she offered.
If he didn’t know any better, he would say that they are his parents, but they do not exactly fit John’s imagination. These people are too … normal. Ordinary. So unlike Sherlock. And yet the man looks like an older version of him. They can’t be …
John laughs and kisses his sweaty forehead before he reaches up, opens their bedside drawer and retrieves the lube. “Give me that pillow over there,” he says. Sherlock complies and lifts his hips, having already guessed John’s thoughts. John places it beneath them and then squeezes a considerable amount of lube into his palm to warm it up a little. “You’ll tell me if–“
He goes downstairs, finding Sherlock in the kitchen. His shirt is rumpled and his hair curlier than usual. “Morning,” he says. “You're making breakfast.”
John came upstairs with his medical bag in one hand and a plastic one in the other. »Hi, you alright?« he asked the detective who had returned to the sofa once more. »Christ, it’s cold in here.«
"If it matters to you, it matters." Mike's voice was soft and compassionate, and Sherlock hated it. What the hell did he know about his inner strife anyway?
“A hot water bottle would help the nausea, but you’re burning up so it’s very counterproductive,” John said and sat down on the bed.
"Sherlock, I mean!" Worry clouds the lady's face, and she plays with her fingernails nervously. "I've seen come home earlier. He wouldn't even say hello to me, can you imagine that?" She tilts her head, a mixture of concern and anger crossing her face.
He always looked so entirely at ease; no frown lines on his forehead or between his eyes. His features smoothed and graceful. Relaxed and calm. He was beautiful.
"You're upset, too, John," Sherlock says. "Children sense other people’s s discomfort even more strongly than a grown-up ever could. It's no surprise Rosie didn't simmer down again with you being on edge all the time as well."
he kept telling himself while he couldn't help but stare at John's flawless upper body. Since when did he find that sort of thing attractive? He couldn't answer this question. Instead, he mentally declared that John should stop wearing a shirt altogether.
He nudged him forward by the shoulders, but Sherlock used that opportunity to his own advantage. Grabbing his wrists, Sherlock made use of the knowledge in martial arts and twisted them – “Argh! Faggot!” – in such a way that he would have a moment to plan his final punch.
"Tonight, then," he announced, almost too quickly. It made John laugh. It was the most beautiful sight to see in this world.
John’s chest was warm, just as warm as Sherlock’s face. He could feel John’s cool breath on his skin and his heartbeat under his fingertips. It was calm and steady, quite contrary to his own. The closer he was to John the faster it beat, and the more intense was the tingling sensation inside him. Goosebumps appeared whenever John's fingers brushed against his skin or hair or when he kissed his lips. It was electrifying, and he couldn't get enough of it.
He reached for the hem of the shirt he had lent John for the night – it was too big for him, but that didn't matter because it had to be removed, instantly – and pulled it over John's head. It took less than a second until John captured his mouth in a sensual kiss once more.
They both chuckled heartily and John reached for the hot chocolates, handing one to Sherlock. Both of them took a sip, when the front door opened and the older Holmes brother stepped inside. »Dear Lord, the weather is dreadful,« he said as he hung up his coat in the hall.
A few audible sounds break free from his throat. Not loud enough, not loud enough. He can smell the bitter smoke from a torch. They wouldn’t. They
"What? What is it?" John asks, concern evident in his voice. He steps closer to sneak a look at Sherlock's phone, and what he sees there, makes his blood go cold in his veins.
Not knowing what time it was, he turned carefully as not to wake John quite yet. Watching him sleep was one of his favourite things to do – apart from kissing him, laughing with him and, well, sleeping with him, obviously. Now, he could add something new to the list, which had got ridiculously long by now. Everything he did with John had its charms. Some things more, some things less. Watching him sleep definitely had an appeal.
"Good," John whispers and leans forward to press a gentle kiss to Sherlock's lips, feeling the push and pull of their lips, and a buzzing feeling runs through his body. "You still make me shiver," he says, and Sherlock actually chuckles.
“YESSS! Now we have some very romantic 90s aesthetic you can show your grandchildren one day,” Greg exclaimed full of excitement.
John broke the kiss and rested his palm on Sherlock’s cheek. “Hey,” he murmured, a smile tugging at his lips. “No need to be nervous.”
"It was about my father," John told him and looked up at Sherlock who was still leaning against the pillows he had plumped up so he could sit up a little. "My family is totally fucked up. I should probably tell you beforehand."
He wants to move, needs to move, struggling with every muscle he wants to bring back to life. He tries to cry out. Why aren't people standing closer to the fire so that they could hear him?
John had realised his romantic attraction gradually. It had started with little things like his warmth towards Mrs Hudson or his being at a complete loss when it came to apologising properly because he did it so rarely. When John had stumbled, truly stumbled, into Sherlock’s life, it was a mess.
John placed a hand on Sherlock’s forehead, probably checking if he had a temperature. “How are you feeling now?”
God, why hadn't this come to his mind before? How severely this affected John? How much it had already had an impact on his life? How his family had already taken the path of self-destruction?
John loses his rhythm for good now; it doesn't take long, one, two, three, four more thrusts before the dam breaks and he's falling. As though he's flying, soaring back to the ground, into the cold water and diving into the depth of the sea. He sees stars, he's sure, and his body tingles all over and within him. His vision blurs, he feels dizzy by the intensity of it, his knees almost buckle, but he keeps going, keeps pushing inside him and drawing back, stroking Sherlock through the aftershocks, stopping before oversensitivity sets in.
When they pulled away, John said, "You don't need to ask, by the way. You can kiss me whenever you want."
A giant pile of paperwork is handed to him by the nurse when he is discharged, as well as a card with an appointment written on it. "To check if everything's going all right with you," she clarifies.
“And,” John takes a deep breath and clears his throat. “And sell the house … if you still want us around here, permanently, that is.”
Sherlock doesn’t seem to know how to answer. Another first. Another last. Their time must be almost up.
John smiled softly and took the glass from him when it was empty. “It was no problem. There’s no need to thank me.”
When Opa Scott died many, many years ago, Karla came over to England for the funeral. It had always been his wish to be buried in his home country, even though he had felt more than at home in West Germany where he met her decades ago. She often told Sherlock about the summer of 1947 – she was only 19 years old at that time – when they met. He was a soldier, based in the British occupation zone, in what was Schleswig-Holstein today.
Sherlock had already given up on hoping he would be allowed to feel this happy again. He wanted to punch himself for assuming John had just pretended to enjoy being close to him in those past weeks.
"Mr Holmes." The nurse enters and starts working on John's monitors. "We'll have to run a couple of vital stats tests and Dr Watson needs to rest."
He watches Sherlock as he watches him. His gaze is softer somehow. Less piercing. He lets out a breathy laugh and leans forward in his armchair, onto his elbows. “I can’t believe you’re alive,” he mumbles.
»I would be there if it was possible, but it isn’t,« John answered. »It’s either you or me and you’re the genius, so you’re going.«
Sherlock’s eyes fell shut, but he somehow still managed to nod. John pressed a little deeper until his finger was buried up to his second knuckle.
He thought of something for his parents first. They didn’t really care about what Sherlock gave them. They’d love it anyway, no matter what it was because it was from their son. His mother loved chocolate, his dad even more so. He remembered he always bought so much chocolate for Christmas and decorated “Christmas plates”, as he called them, with pralines, bonbons, sweets and probably more treats than any human being could eat.
it, John. I know it’s not– we have not–,” he gestured between the two of them as if it would make John understand. “It hasn’t been long, but–“ Why was it so hard to voice his thoughts without making himself sound like a
Sherlock walked through the uninviting corridors of the Diogenes Club and entered his brother’s bureau without knocking.
»John, having them around when we’re on a case is already exhausting enough, but celebrating together is– There’s no reason for me to do so anything when they celebrate not having a case at the moment. I’m glad when I don’t have to bear their non-existent intelligence for a while.«
John cuddles up to Sherlock again, breathing in his scent. "Let's stay like this for a little longer," he asks, and they do.
“It’s ratioGrippal. I went to a pharmacy earlier,” John explained. “It’s against the fatigue and pain in the limbs.”
"I'm glad to have you here, Sherlock," she whispered and kissed his temple gently as she tightened the embrace a bit.
“Making you take care of Rosie when I can’t – I know you never signed up for that, hell, I shouldn’t have brought this on you, but I have. The morgue, the le–“ He closes his eyes and swallows hard, hoping desperately Sherlock didn’t hear the slip. He cannot talk about this now. He hates himself for it. Merely thinking about the damn letter makes him feel sick.
“You idiot,” John smiled disbelievingly and stepped closer to slide both arms around Sherlock’s slim waist. “This isn’t about that brunette I danced with when I was already squiffy. It’s about you.”
Sherlock didn’t remember how he ended up snuggled up against John’s pillow, but it probably didn’t matter either. He fell asleep with John watching him with an affectionate smile while outside the snowflakes kept falling.
Sherlock found himself nodding, lowering his head to kiss John once more. Their tongues continued the lazy game of teasing and pressing while John freed button by button, gently pushing the soft fabric down Sherlock’s shoulders.
His legs felt heavy when he walked up the stairs as quickly as he could manage, John and Mary being right behind him. He rummaged through the drawers of the cabinet next to their sitting room window.
Sherlock had no care for the songs making it to the charts, but the song, the cover recently published of the 70s original, had fit perfectly.
“I do, too,” Sherlock croaked. His heart was beating so quickly and terribly painfully that he thought it wanted to jump out of his chest. More and more people found their partners, some grinning disbelievingly and reluctantly and others rather eager to dance. Nobody was loitering about at the sides of the hall anymore, and the bar was almost empty. The floor was filled with people and more people.
“Meaning we’ll have the place to ourselves all evening and all night.” John’s grin was unbelievably bright.
Sherlock takes long, very long, longer than he remembers was his routine. John still needs to brush his teeth. So after almost fifteen minutes of no word from Sherlock and John waiting on the edge of Sherlock’s bed, he knocks on the bathroom door. “You okay in there?”
His head was spinning and his body was trembling a little and he knew he wouldn’t be able to go back. His brain had told him it had been utter nonsense. Pure imagination. Just a fantasy. A feverish dream. Not real.
John tries the bacon. "You’ll have to get used to me making sure you eat enough when I'm back at 221B."
When the creaking of the door reached his ears, he winced and almost jumped from his chair, but at the same moment, he was frozen on the spot, like a painting on a canvas once the paint had dried.
»Come on, John, he wasn’t that attractive and he was pretty dense, too. I wouldn’t have chosen him.«
Sherlock closed his eyes, capitulating. It had been snowing for the last couple of days and traffic was hell. Of course John loved the snow and he had to admit it was nice to have a white Christmas once in a while, but this was more than he or anyone else could have asked for.
So when John found this broken piece hidden very deep inside him, he’d cradled it in his hands and nursed it back to health by showing him the most endearing and tender part of this world, showing him what he’d been missing and sharing something with him causing him to shiver and feel warm all over at the same time when he thought about it.
John looks up from his whiskey glass when he hears Sherlock coming down the stairs. It's become a ritual, this, Sherlock reading a bedtime story to Rosie, kissing her goodnight. Frankly, John finds it adorable to see Sherlock like that with her. Whenever he watches his daughter and his best friend, his heart swells with joy and pride and love for the two of them.
A pained moan escaped his lips, and it took all his strength to retract to the other side of the bed, not even knowing whose hand it was.
Sherlock reaches down, letting his hand trail over John’s chest, through the thin, golden hair on John’s chest, but John takes him by the wrist. “What––“
He jerks, and upstairs, Rosie promptly starts crying. John curses under his breath, hurrying up the stairs to her to calm her down. The bell rings again. "One bloody moment," John yells impatiently, soothing Rosie with soft and tender forehead kisses.
»Mrs Hudson probably heard that,« John panted and Sherlock could feel the huffs of breath against his ear.
He chuckled quietly and lay down on his back, pulling Sherlock closer against him and burying a hand in the thick, brown curls. »I thought you hated snow?« he asked him with a grin when Sherlock’s head came to rest on his shoulder and he relaxed against him.
They had been careful, but in the end, the inevitable happened, and when Karla’s pregnancy showed, everyone expected she was going to be left alone, and they were right. He did leave, but only to be deployed to another base in the zone, not because he wanted to.
“Intravenous injection,” Sherlock murmured quietly and closed his eyes. “But I snorted two more lines later.”
“Easy,” John caressed his cheek with the knuckles of his fingers. “I know, love. But you’ll get there. We’ll get there.”
“Do you mean it?” he asked, his voice was husky and quiet, and he hated that he had no control over himself, but maybe he had to give up control to make this work. Just this once.
"No, but I'm not everyone," John answered softly. "It's good you told me what you want, or in this case, don't want."
"I'm fine, don't worry," Sherlock answered and waved his hand as if to say it was nothing while in truth his heart still hadn't calmed a bit.
When the kisses grew more heated and the movements more eager, Sherlock could feel his trousers grow tighter once again.
When the clouds vaporised in his brain, and his mind was capable of forming thoughts again, it hit him.
signalling an incoming message. He opens it up, his eyes darting over every single worker at the hospital – until they suddenly come to a halt on one name in particular.
“Well, I see your intentions for tonight are very clear, then,” Sherlock answered, trying not to be disappointed.
When he came back, Sherlock raised the glass to his lips and drank it slowly. The light taste of lemon spread on his tongue, prickling a little.
Sherlock's gut did a complete somersault when he saw Irene step behind the microphone. "And those who can't find a partner, don't worry about a thing! We thought of everything."
"Oh, I am," she smirks. "You wouldn't be here if I weren't. We all make mistakes, of course – you made massive ones – and naturally, there are always some reminders of those. Now, let me remind you how much of a mistake you've made, John Watson." The smile vanishes. Instead, her lips form a tight line, and her voice is ice cold.
