“I’m on break. I’m the only one running the store today, and I needed to step away for twenty. The store will be reopened when my break’s over.” Dean turned towards Ash and Charlie and pointed in the direction of the ball. “Hey, can one of you two grab the ball for me?”
“Did you actually try talking to it, Claire?” Cas asked.
“That we’d only come home to teach.” Dean chuckled softly. “Cas got away. Even if there was a chance he forgave me, there’s nothing here to give him a reason to stay.”
“Wedding announcements?” Dean rolled his eyes but humored Cas all the same. He scanned over the pictures when a face he would have loved to forget appeared. “Cassie’s getting married?” Dean looked up at Cas - fuck, drinking lemonade shouldn’t be that attractive - and shook his head. “So she’s getting married? Why should I care?”
It was taking all of Dean’s willpower to not bash his head into the counter.
“Do that again, Dean.” Cas moved closer, pressing against Dean. A warm flutter filled Dean’s chest and moved in closer to Cas as well. “Dean. Cover your face. Look like you’re crying.”
“So go tell her that.”
“Interesting.” Cas raised an eyebrow before turning to face Dean. “From what the research says, they had the right things for an offering. But the Fomorian could possibly also sense the intent behind it. Claire can’t be the one to make the offering.”
“You ready to hurt her? She proposed to you after all.”
“Are you alright, Dean?” Cas came back behind the counter and wrapped an arm around Dean’s shoulder. “What happened isn’t your fault.”
"Uh, yeah. Yes. Sure. I can do that." Dean stammered as he walked up to the furnace. Cas opened the door, and Dean started to gather the glass on the end of the pipe.
The angel looked up from running his fingers through Dean’s hair. The look in his eyes was a rare one, and it worried Sam. Cas was scared. “I know he would be more comfortable at the bunker, but I don’t know if the trip is a good idea for him in this condition. If I rest, I’ll have more grace to heal him more, and we should be okay to go home tomorrow.”
“Fuck,” both Dean and Cas muttered at the same time. Dean dragged his hand down his face. “Cas. Do you know how bad this is going to look?”
Dean reluctantly stood and stripped himself out of his pajamas. He took a moment to try and remember if Cas wore clothes under the suit. After racking his brain, Dean figured that another layer of fabric between his skin and the pointy end of a bee wouldn't hurt. Dean took his time getting dressed, hoping to delay the inevitable for as long as possible. As he zipped up his jeans, he took another look at the outfit and shook his head. The things he did for love.
"And I love you, Dean." Cas rested his hands on Dean's waist and helped shift him into a position that was comfortable for both of them. "So, I was thinking."
“I don’t think. I know.” Cas handed the change to the customer. “Have a good day.”
Dean quickly exited the kitchen stripping his clothing as he walked the hallway to their room. He dumped his clothes into a chair and climbed up on their bed, listening to hear if Cas was behind him. As Dean heard Cas approach, he knelt onto all fours, head hanging and looking down at the comforter.
“You look better.” Dean spouted out, unthinking. “I mean, you look better than me. You never lacked in looks. You look incredible…”
Cas rolled his eyes and slowly turned his phone, showing Dean his purchase. In a matter of seconds, Dean went through the five stages of grief, knowing that he'd been caught. "You saw."
Dean walked back into the shop to find Cas ringing out a customer. “She here yet?”
“What do you think I’m trying to do?” Dean tugged a little harder. “It’s caught on something.”
Cas snorted and shook his head before taking the paper and folding it up neatly. He returned it to the stack and leaned back on the counter. “Anna was asked to be a bridesmaid, though. I just found out today.”
Three.
“Loitering and causing a disturbance? Fine!” The instigator reached down and grabbed a pack of gum. “I’m going to buy some Chewlies gum! Now I’m a customer, and I’m having a discussion with another customer! Or are you afraid of the truth?”
. How often was it that someone could say they got to play hockey on the roof of a business?
“Hello, Dean.” The sound of a Tupperware container hitting the counter made Dean look up. “I’m assuming you didn’t bring lunch.”
“Dean?” Charlie watched as her best friend paced his bedroom. “Dean! You’re entirely worked up. I don’t get it.”
“I actually said it?”
"Only because you asked so nicely." Cas reached around Dean's waist and wrapped his hand around Dean's cock, stroking it lightly. "And you do feel so close to coming."
“Very well, Dean.” He let out a sigh of relief as Cassie pulled away slowly. “I’ll run it by Dagon anyway. I promised her I’d let her know if I made any plans while we’re here.”
“You’re not supposed to be here today, Dean. You had no problem closing the store for what? Twenty minutes to play a period of hockey? Lydia was your friend— your girlfriend —for a couple of years. Close the damn store.”
“And you wonder why I thought you cheated on me.” She turned around and leaned back against the counter, eyeing Cas up and down. “Long time no see, Castiel.”
Dean managed to nod and started to walk to the bench when another voice called out.
"He mentioned the same thing to me. And about walking outside together as he went for his walk." Dean leaned into Cas. "What did you tell him?"
Exactly!” Cas nodded and offered his hand down to Dean. “The only way to complete the Death star quickly and without anyone knowing, they would have needed to hire anybody and everybody who was qualified. An average stormtrooper isn’t going to be the person you want installing a toilet.” He pulled Dean to his feet. “Hell, they can barely hit the broadside of a barn, and they were literally trained for fighting!”.
“I can’t lose her again.” Claire looked up at him. “I won’t.”
Dean stole a glance at Cas before returning his attention to Frank. “Whose house was it?”
Cas stepped into Dean's personal space. "You know what is better than sex toys, though, don't you, Dean?"
"Yes, Sir." Dean nodded enthusiastically. "What can I do to please you?"
"Alright, so let's do a quick tour, and then we'll introduce you to your benches and the furnaces." Cas led them around the workshop, showing them where the bathroom and breakroom were, as well as the administrative offices, before guiding them to a few workstations. "These are our benches. They're set up for a basic workshop condition, but once you get into the groove, you can rearrange to what works for you and your partner."
“This was your doing?” Dean felt Cas’ eyes on him. “Is that what you two talked about when you left the hotel room?”
Cas set his mug and phone down and rubbed at his eyes, blinking them a few times. Still not believing his eyes, Cas reached into his chest pocket and grabbed out his glasses.
“That’s a douche move.” Ash walked over and wrapped his arm around Charlie’s shoulder. “You’re probably going to need a whole new lock unless you can get some kerosene or something down in there and get all the chunks of gum out.”
Unlike the first class, when the week prior dragged because Dean was so excited, the week before the second class flew by. Dean was nervous as hell and could only hope that he hadn't embarrassed himself. He hadn't received any phone calls saying he couldn't come back, so he did take that as a small win.
"Mr. Winchester? Dr. Fitzgerald will see you now." The dental hygienist smiled at him and led him back to a private room. She gestured to the chair. "Take a seat, and he’ll be right in."
“Don’t make me get a ruler. Get out of here and take Castiel with you. He missed his bus to find out he’s tutoring you.” Missouri sat down behind her desk. “Now, Dean Winchester, or so help me.”
“Three.”
“Don’t be so hard on yourself. That asshole had you cornered. You’d have done the same for me.” Lisa leaned down and kissed Dean’s nose when the bell on the counter dinged.
“Lisa?” Dean’s eyes widened in surprise.
"Cas, what are you d—?" Dean withered and got harder at the look Cas shot him. He faced forward again, trying to hold in all the noises he wanted to make as Cas continued to slide into him.
“Who is that person, Cas?” Dean leveled a glare at Cas. “Who? Cause you’re right. I know it’s not Cassie. It wasn’t Lydia, and it’s not Lisa. Tell me, who’s going to be the person who does that?” He knew how he sounded, and he didn’t care. But when Cas didn’t respond, he deflated. “That’s what I thought.” Dean licked his bottom lip before sucking it in and biting on it. “Watch the shop? I’ll be back.”
“You’re such a fucking idiot.” Cas backed off. “You deserve to be loved, to be cherished. And I can tell you right now that Cassie is not that person.”
"Honestly, I'm not sure either." Dean rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly before offering to take the basket from Garth. "It's like you implied the other day. It's not like this is anything new. We've been together a while."
Cas scoffed. “You do realize that a construction job of that magnitude needs more manpower than the Imperial army had. Plus, the army isn’t going to have plumbers, metal workers, computer technicians. I'll bet independent contractors were working on every aspect of the Death Star”.
After waiting a moment with no sound, Sam knocked again, a little louder. "Dean?"
Dean frowned. He had hoped for the sake of whatever angel summoned Cas that the issue was crucial. It had been weeks since Cas and Dean had started sharing a bed. That had moved to sharing soft touches. And one fateful night after a bad nightmare, the dam between them had finally broken.
Dean watched as Cas slid the pole into the furnace, twisting it deftly. He bit his bottom lip as his imagination ran wild in regards to Cas' hands.
“Dude, I knew she was a lesbian before she even said the words. We grew up together.” Dean led them out to his car. “But I promised it didn’t change the fact that I consider her my sister.”
“I’m fine.” he pushed past Dean and reached over the counter, grabbing a paper. Cas leaned back against the counter as he snapped it open.
“Give me one good reason why I shouldn’t close up right now.” Dean watched as Cas’ grin broadened. “I requested today off well in advance. I have practice.”
“It’s not what you think, Red.” Dean ran his hand through his hair before crossing to and sitting on the bed.
“Of course, Dean.” Cas stretched, and his shirt rode up, barely exposing the tattoo on his hip. He ran his fingers through his hair before exiting the Impala and heading back to the trunk.
Dean dragged his feet as he walked across the yard. While he had been proud of himself, coming up with a solution to handle Cas' bees, it meant that he had to work with Cas' bees. And he was doing it in a costume that he had put away, never to be dragged out again. (That's right, he was glaring at Charlie from a distance without her even knowing.) He stopped at a table that Cas had set up and pulled out the instruction on how to take care of the bees. The first thing he had to do was find that weird metal thing —the smoke can, he remembered— and fill it with Cas' special mixture.
“Cas, I love hanging out with you. I’ve never been more thankful that Missouri picked you to tutor me.” Dean smiled as Cas slid into the Impala. He closed the door for Cas before going over to the driver’s side. “Alright. You wanna go back to your place?”
“Technically, you shook—” Ash held his hands up when Dean started to square his body up. “I’m stopping. But I think you really need to close the store. You’re going to let this eat at you.”
“IT’S LITERALLY CALLED ORAL SEX!” Dean threw his hands up in the air. “You said only three guys, Lis!”
“Fine.” Lisa nodded and crossed to the door. “For what it’s worth, though, you and Cas? I believe that before I believe you trying to get back with Cassie. But I know you’re too chicken shit to make a move.” She stormed out of the store, the door slamming shut behind her.
Cas started to turn back towards the bar, a smirk on his own face. At least they wouldn’t need to use one of Charlie’s credit cards to pay for their hotel room.
“I knew you would, Dean.” Cas smiled softly as he took the test and flipped through it. “Looks like you scored higher than me, too.”
Dean closed his eyes and tried to calm his breathing. “Ditto, Sunshine.”
"Put that away. It's not going to work." Dean mentally cursed as Cas continued to weaponize his eyes and lips. He let out a sigh of frustration. "No, I didn't try it on because you promised I wouldn't have to work with your damn bees!"
“Aww, shit. It’s been over fifteen years, hasn’t it?” Victor continued to hold his hand out. “We were on the football team together. We were both running backs?”
“Dude! I said no soliciting, and that means your unwanted opinion as well. Stop harassing my customers and get out of my store.” Dean dragged his hand down his face. “I’m not even supposed to be here today.”
Thinking of Cas, Dean looked over at his friend sitting on the edge of the building with a blunt in hand. Cas was talking to Ash and Charlie below, talking about bees. While he couldn’t hear Ash’s part of the conversation, he smiled as Cas became more animated speaking about the pollination habit of the bumblebee.
“Why are you bringing her into this? That’s low, Missouri.” Dean pressed his lips together in an attempt to keep his lip from trembling.
After a moment, both of their phones started to ping non-stop. A flurry of texts from their friends came in, congratulating them, asking for details, wanting to know everything. They would have to wait for the answers to their questions, though.
“Yeah, no. That’s why he came home with us every Thursday. I’m surprised Sam never told you.”
Dean looked over at Claire. “Sounds like she almost did. The Fomorian grabbed you and pulled you into the river.”
Dean swallowed before nodding slowly. “I can try.”
The call ended, and Dean stared at his phone for a moment, waiting for the time to appear. He was going to need a shower, some coffee - preferably not the shit they sold at the
“You think I don’t know that? I know there’s no way he wants me. Not after what I did to him.” Dean looked at his hands. “You know, until Cas left for college, Gabriel wouldn’t let me into his restaurant? Cas would go there after school, and Gabriel protected him from, well, me.” Dean shook his head. “The first time I showed up after we graduated, and he let me in? He tried to dig information out from me. Apparently, Cas hadn’t told him a damn thing. Just that he didn’t want me near him.”
“Yeah, well, so is she. Supposedly has the best pot on this side of the Mississippi, and you fuckers sold me skunked-out shit.”
“You’re taking his side?!” Claire huffed before sitting down on the bed across from Dean.
Dean shrugged. “So what?”
“Please, Son. I’ll give you overtime. I know you need a new part for the Impala. The money from working today will get it for you.”
“You tell her that you love her?”
“I am not high. I have full control of my functions. They’re just motivated to copulate and claim.” Cas wrapped his hand around Dean’s cock and stroked it in rhythm with his movements. “And the chick flick moment is because the only person I will
“No, Cas! That’s not how this works! That’s not how any of this works! Cassie, nor Lydia, nor Lisa could fix me. You can’t fix me. What you see is what you get, and if you think for one second that I won’t do something that’ll destroy you too, then you’re sadly mistaken.” Dean rolled his eyes as he laughed bitterly. “I can’t do anything right. I destroyed my family. I can barely keep the family business afloat. Everything I touch turns to shit.”
"Huh?" He looked up from his phone. "Cat Serial Killer. I'm listening."
“Are you sure? I can come with you. There’s not much more for me to do.”
“And I would give it all up for you, Dean. I don’t need my grace. I need you. I love you.”
“Swear on my grandmother’s grave.” Frank crossed himself. “Six months ago,  I was offered a job up in Wichita. Large, beautiful house with acres of sprawling land. The job was for an add-on apartment; some call it an in-law suite. My point of sale told me that if my team could finish the job within two weeks, they’d give me a bonus that would double the cost.. Then I realized whose house it was.”
“You’re in Minnesota? You’re not even in the fucking state?” Dean restrained himself from throwing the phone, barely remembering in time that it was Cas’ and not his. “Fuck you. You owe me huge.” He hung up the phone and forced himself to gingerly set it down on the counter.
“Can’t wear you out yet.” Cas reached down between them and used a bit of grace to help prep and lube Dean. “I don’t think one round is going to sate me.”
“What’s your name, sir? Full name.”
As Dean looked around for Charlie again, her distinct giggle caught his attention. “I know, I know!” She was bright and bubbly, as she often was during social events. Someone was dragged behind her, but from the angle, Dean couldn’t see who it was. “I promise, it’ll be fine.” Charlie came into sight, her arm behind her attached to…
“I agree.” Dean nodded. After a few moments of holding on to Cas, a thought crossed Dean’s mind. “Cas, how long have you and Charlie been talking?”
[Dean, 10:25 AM]: Seriously, dude. I mean, I like what we have going on.
“Kevin’s on the other side of the state for the SATs. Or the ACTs. I don’t fucking remember what they use anymore. There’s no way in hell he’s going to be here by noon.”
Dean stood up, walked out of the room, and drove home in a blur.
"Here to say I told you so?" Dean yawned out, burrowing deeper into the blanket.
“Lisa?” Both Dean and Lisa sat up at the questioning voice. “Lisa Braeden, is that you?”
. Without his best friend to keep him entertained and distracted, Dean leaned forward on the counter. He flipped through a magazine, thinking over what had happened at the funeral home.
“Yeah, we’ll stop there. I’ll run in, pack up quick, and then we’ll get on the road.” Sam thrummed his thumbs on the steering wheel to a random beat. He looked back in the rearview mirror and watched how deliberately Cas kept vigil over his brother. Sam briefly debated bringing up what Dean admitted before passing out, ultimately deciding against it on the short trip to the motel.
“Not my problem.” Dean’s eyes slowly fluttered open. “You’re the one who shouldn’t have had so much to drink if you knew you had to work today.”
"So we could match?" Dean's eyebrow popped up in confusion. "Babe, I thought all beekeeper's suits were that ugly beige color?"
“Dude, my doctor says I’m fine.”
“Long time no see, Dean.” Cassie was more beautiful than Dean remembered. Her smile was radiant and infectious, and her voice had a bright lilt to it. “Still working the family shop, I see.”
“Not just members of the Imperial Army, I’m following.”
"I swear. I know it's the holidays, so I know people are tired and don't want to cook, but it's never been this busy." Benny leaned back in his chair, smiling at Sam. "How about you? What's going on at the firm?"
Dean stole a glance at Cas. "One, I don't have that many exes. Two, you actually liked any of them?"
“Right. Well, good luck with that.” Ash turned to Charlie, who rolled her eyes and pulled a joint out of her jacket. “Aw, fuck yeah. That’s my platonic lesbian lifemate.”
“And per the usual, you asked how high, right?” She traced her nails against his scalp and Dean closed his eyes again. “Dean, you have your diploma. You’ve been working on your college degree. Find a job on campus and leave here.”
Cas shoved Dean against the counter and pinned him there. “Now you listen to me, Dean Winchester. All I ever hear from you is how life shits on you.” He flicked Dean’s ear. “I get it. I hear you. But everything you think is bad? Isn’t.” Cas stepped back and took Dean’s hand, pulling him back to standing. “You chose to stay behind. You wanted for Sam to get out of here and escape your father. You could have left too. While I’m glad you didn’t, you could have gotten a full ride too. You didn’t have to choose community college.” He gestured around the store. “And all this? You’re the one who thinks that working here will make your father proud of you!”
Until they walked back into the workshop.
Cas sighed. “Movies Plus. They have a movie I want to watch that we don’t have.” He held out his hands and closed his fingers around the keys after Dean dropped them in. “I can’t be gone that long. It’s not like I’m next door, and the walkie will pick up.”
DEAN glares at RUBY.
We see DEAN crying with his head in his hands in the BUNKER DUNGEON and we hear-
"Masked?" Sam asks. Instead of arguing, I push my whole arm into the void. I blindly wave my arm around, trying to find the object that holds the mask in place. My fingers grasp a cool metal and I wrap my hand around it. I bite my lip from crying out as it cuts into my palm. I pull with all my strength and fall backwards. The black darkness is sucked back into the knife and I shield my eyes from the sunlight that streams in through the tiny barred window. An otter squirms through the window and opens its mouth.
LILLIAN giggles and DEAN blushes furiously.
CASTIEL
Here goes nothin’.
There might not be another choice, JACK. I’m sorry-
DEAN cuts off when he sees GABE and MICHAEL enter the room. He pulls a gun and points it in their general direction.
Castiel freezes immediately, and adjusts his voice accordingly. He whispers, “My apologies. You are safe, Dean: the witch is dead.”
DEAN raises his left hand but stops immediately when CAS flinches.
Um...look. About what I said before, about you not being family-
"The Death Eater's brought them here," the British woman chimes. I look at her again, and I don't really care that I don't understand half the things she talks about. She is absolutely gorgeous; long, wavy, dirty blonde hair; large grey eyes; a patchwork dress and bare feet and a wand tucked behind her ear.
. Yeah, they saved the world, but he also has
The panning ends on JACK, who is the only one who hasn’t aged. He has a party crown on that says HAPPY NEW YEARS and is holding a cookie with a bite out of it, a smile on his face. The camera follows JACK across the room to where DEAN, SAM, CAS, and EILEEN are talking.
During the musical part of Carry On we hear clips of DEAN’s prayers to CAS throughout the seasons (overlapping) ending with “I need to say something” and CAS saying he heard his prayer.
, Dean still isn’t satisfied. He doesn’t ask Jack to bring Cas back right away because part of him feels like he doesn’t deserve him, doesn’t deserve his love; he doesn’t want to disrupt Cas’s peace. But then, Jack leaves, turns into the rain or whatever the fuck, and he loses his chance. He tries summoning Jack a few times, but all that appears are a few golden feathers, and, one time, a nougat bar. Eventually he stops trying to reach him, and looks for another way.
JACK uses his powers to zap electricity through himself to get THE EMPTY off of him. THE EMPTY jolts off of JACK but grabs his angel blade and stabs him. JACK falls backwards, motionless, and THE EMPTY retrieves the blade
CASTIEL begins to stir.

DEAN (cont.)
“Cas?” Dean rasps, mouth going dry, heart pounding in his ears.
DEAN looks back over his shoulder and shrugs before taking a step closer.
THE EMPTY screams, oozing BLACK GOO as its “DEAN SKIN” melts off, leaving behind a black oozing shape that then explodes, getting all over DEAN, JACK, CAS, and the surrounding ANGELS and DEMONS.
We get several shots of CAS and DEAN, of DEAN saying CAS’s name as the song plays with voice layovers of important Destiel quotes (between DEAN and CAS, and said to them) and important scenes, including: the mixtape scene, every time CAS died and came back, CAS getting left in PURGATORY, DEAN and CAS reuniting in PURGATORY in THE TRAP, DEAN and CAS staring at each other, etc.
, he’s a dick. Like, major Ass Hat material. And, I’m good now! Or- I guess, more morally grey? Anyway, all I want is to get the hell back to Hell, and as far away from
Dean looks up and his eyes take a moment to focus on Castiel, and he blinks out a few tears. “You left...me. You...
: YOUNG JOHN buying the RING; YOUNG JOHN giving it to YOUNG MARY; YOUNG MARY wearing the RING; CHILD DEAN picking the ring up out of the rubble of their old home; YOUNG DEAN wearing the RING in early seasons; DEAN getting the ring out of a drawer; SAM saying ‘we need something small- something un-noticeable.’; DEAN replying: ‘I know the perfect thing’; DEAN handing the RING to JACK; and back to-
Dean is shocked into silence for a few minutes, and by the time he can speak again, Castiel is pulling himself up and over onto a plateau at the top of the cliff. Dean hauls himself up after Cas and lets out a grunt, and then gasps at the sight before him.
Yep. I think that’s exactly it. And in turn...it
Dean opens his mouth and closes it over and over, finally looking at SAM.
"Dean! Cas! There you are!" Sam comes running through the trees, holding Luna's hand. "Dean! You won't believe- the demon blood, it lets me do ma- Dean! You're arm!" Sam's face goes from radiant to horrified in a split second. A moment later and he's kneeling beside us, hand helplessly hovering over my shoulder. He looks back at Luna. "There's a spell, right? Something to fix it? Right?"
DEAN inches towards where CASTIEL sits on the floor, a few feet away from him.
"Over here. Dead Deatheaters!" Harry comes over, wand raised. Inspecting the bodies we see that three have been shot.
. It should at least buy us some time if we need it.
CASTIEL’s nose is bleeding, his face bloody.
yes, I am in the "Sam Ships It" club. Join me in hell. :)
CASTIEL
I have to agree, DEAN. This was a wonderful idea.
it was a good idea, Dean; I said it was a
THE EMPTY (as DEAN)
THE EMPTY
DEAN pushes the blade closer to RUBY’S neck, making her and JACK stumble into the devils trap on the floor.
“A faerie told me.”
Well, it’s just...GOD absorbed her. And if I take GOD’s power, I’ll be taking HER too! She doesn’t deserve that!
SAM (smiling as well)
The witch stumbles at the blow, spitting out blood, and Dean winds up for yet another swing just as the witch acts. He swipes a leg out, knocking Dean flat on his back. Before Dean can react, a purple, sparkly powder falls over him and he hears the witch muttering an incantation before he seizes in pain and everything goes black…
We see EILEEN fade into existence next to SW, then more names, including CLAIRE, CHARLIE, BOBBY, GARTH, JODY, DONNA, KAIA, PATIENCE, ALEX- they appear quicker and quicker as the lighting shifts.
loving you feels like.”
I knew you would show up. You’re like roaches.
He’s happy for Sam and Eileen, really, truly; but a part of him makes him grind his teeth, and even lash out at them both- it eventually drives Sam to move out of the bunker to live in an apartment with Eileen.
Scouts honor.
DEAN just stands there at first, then wraps his arms around JACK and pats his back.
DEAN looks up at JACK
THE EMPTY (chuckles)
. There’s just no way, no way he’s
part of the void.
EVERYONE gathers around to look as JACK pulls something off his finger and holds up a glowing WEDDING RING.
SAM amped them up with some witchy stuff, and CHUCK should be a bit weaker--so
CHUCK (wiping blood from his mouth)
, DEAN. I’m sorry…
JACK puts a hand on DEAN’S shoulder
"Who's this Voldemort guy?"
DEAN opens his mouth to say something snarky, but CASTIEL cuts him off.
Sectumsempra. Luna rushes off in that direction with a worried look on her face and I know it can't be good. I crawl over to the petrified man and take his maple wand. Rearing my arm back, I let my fist slugger across his face for a good measure.
"Oh!" I say. "Some of the thestrals have wandered off. Sam, could you help me gather them back in?" I could easily do it with magic, but bonding with them is so much lovelier. Sam smiles and agrees.
CASTIEL scrambles over to DEAN and tackles him in a hug. They hug tightly for a long moment. We see shots of their faces. CASTIEL has his eyes closed, looking like he is holding back tears and working through several emotions. DEAN has his face pressed into CASTIEL’S neck, actually crying tears of happiness, of relief.
Who are you?
When I see Dean fall, I freeze. I see his body go limp in an instant, his yells for sam dry up in the air. Blood sprays and spatters the ground, and I can see every horrid crimson drop in clarity with my enhanced vision. All sound stops, all thought stops, until I see his chest rise feebly, and catch a small moan on the wind. Then I rush forward and see his left arm lying beside him - detached from his body.
Hermione
CASTIEL a mixture of guilt, confusion, sheepishness, and then determination wash over his face.
The camera keeps moving around the crowded bunker, and we see several people laughing and talking, many familiar faces and some new. We see KAIA shoving cake into CLAIRE’S face; ROWENA and RUBY talking animatedly close together; DONNA and JODY laughing with GARTH, BESS, and their children; CHARLIE and STEVIE; KEVIN (fucking alive and well) and LINDA TRAN; AU BOBBY; AARON BASS; KRISSY CHAMBERS; AMARA; PATIENCE; ALEX; CAESAR and JESSE; GABRIEL; MICHAEL/ADAM; the BANES TWINS; the mf-ing GHOST FACERS...literally everyone who is still alive and should have been in the fucking CW finale.
Dean has started to adjust. He had about two and a half months of depression, and Cas couldn't heal it. Apparently his powers are limited to the physical. I could tell Cas was frustrated. He blamed himself for Dean getting hurt, said to me that he should have stopped him from running in there. I knew Dean heard, because he was tender with Cas the next time i saw them together. He is doing better now though. Luna taught me a spell that would quickly sew clothes, and I made it so the left arms of Dean's jackets and flannels cut off just below the shoulder - just below where Castiel's first mark on Dean still shows. He's not perfect, but he's adjusting.
continues to play.
JACK’s hands begin to glow golden, a glow that spreads through CHUCK’s body as he yells louder than ever before.
"I knew it! Daddy always said angels were real. I knew they were. My name's Luna. Pleasure to meet you, sir."
(See the end of the chapter for
There’s still
I’m here, Dean?”
DEAN chuckles. He clears his throat again, and finally looks CAS in the eyes.
Yeah...thanks.
begins to play as the camera pans from the Destiel kiss, to RUBY questioning her life choices, to JACK contentedly watching his dads make out, then up through the ceiling and into the MAIN ROOM of THE BUNKER where we see SAM rushing up the stairs and letting EILEEN inside and immediately wrapping her in a hug and kissing her.
Cuts to DEAN, sitting at his DESK in his ROOM, shuffling through old PHOTOGRAPHS of all their friends who are dead (or snapped away by CHUCK). We see many familiar faces including CHARLIE, BOBBY, ELLEN, ASH, JO, MARY, and CAS. Dean sets all the others aside and just stares at the CAS picture for a while.
As an ace person, asexual cas has always meant a lot to me. In literally every fic I write, whether or not is is said explicitly, Cas IS ace in my canon, so :)
dammit- Cas! Don’t leave me now.
CAS said that?
think this is a good idea.”
Castiel whispers, even lower than before, “Dean, I am going to put my hand around you now. You are extremely cold, which will make your heart beat accelerate at a dangerous pace- I wish to prevent this. Is that alright with you?”
DEAN claps his hands together excitedly

“Cas...
fucking drunk. They just got Cas back. Jack changed his mind and decided to stay, bringing- a very human- Cas with him.
Um...can I tell you something?
Almost everyone
"Cas, what's wrong?" His deep voice cuts through my mind. I ignore him and walk up to the strange girl with white flowers in her blonde hair.
CHUCK pulls himself to his feet, growling, as JACK comes towards him, hitting CHUCK with a wave of GOLDEN FORCE that pushes CHUCK back to the ground, throwing sand everywhere.
Cas immediately holds his hand over my leg and a white light glows. I yell out in pain and my head feels like it's floating above my body. The skin on my leg is knitting itself to cover new muscles that are sprouting. I taste blood from where I've bitten my tongue.
Jack gets inside and the rift closes behind him.
"Can't you just blast magic at the barriers?" I hear Ron ask. The man in the trenchcoat rolls his eyes and sighs.
CHUCK collapses in pain and touches the blood seeping from the wound and staining the SAND red.
THE EMPTY, still NOT DEAN, has a trail of black goo aimed at the back of CASTIEL’S head, almost like a gun.
DEAN (hiding the fact that he’s tearing up)
Aww, and I thought we were so close.
a gun in your pocket.
Dean doesn’t hesitate, throwing himself at Castiel, and they tumble together back into the flowers. Dean kisses Castiel over and over as Cas laughs in relief. Finally Dean relents and pulls back to stroke a hand over Castiel’s cheek, gazing into those blue, blue eyes as they reflect the glow of the tree, the sun.
"It's a spell, its casting the barrier. If we can alter the glyphs instead of trying to take down the barrier itself, we may be able to penetrate it. It will take all of us, though. They are powerfully made, with dark magic. You all ready?"
sorry.
I forgive you.
It’s our story now, CHUCK. CAS made sure of that.
"Hey babe," I say, momentarily forgetting what is going on, seeing his unshaven face and tousled hair. Sam clears his throat and I cut my eyes at him before I ask, "Do you have any idea what these things are?"
DEAN watches SAM leave, and after a few moments of silence pulls out his wallet and looks at the picture of Cas in his cowboy hat. Tears come to his eyes. He wipes them away and looks off to the distance, then back to the picture.
“Don’t you
. Yeah, you’re
...it took him...It took CAS.
Will those weapons do anything against CHUCK?
"I'm sorry, Dean, but there's nothing i can do." she looks like she means it. I look at my feet because i can't look at Sammy's face. Cas holds me tighter and presses his face to my hair. I close my eyes and let myself relax into him. I try to untense my body, but it's impossible. Eventually Sam whispers something to Luna and i hear them stand and walk back to the others. And I find myself thinking about Bobby. I realize now how he felt when he was stuck in that wheelchair. Helpless. Less-than. Weak. but i won't let this make me bitter.
We see a CASSEROLE being placed on the TABLE- one hand has a WEDDING RING on. The camera pans up to show DEAN placing it there, temples a little grey, a few more laugh lines, a full beard, hair a little longer, and a smile on his face. Castiel comes up behind him, wearing glasses and an open flannel shirt over a t-shirt that says SAVE THE BEES. CAS wraps his arms around DEAN’s waist and kisses DEAN’s neck.
I drop beside him and try to heal him, yet though my powers surge through my hand, his arm does not reattach. I try again and again and eventually get the bleeding to stop, the wound to heal up, new skin over the exposed bone and muscle, but his arm will not reattach. I heal a gash in his chest which was uncomfortably close to his heart. I touch his forehead and heal any internal injuries - all in under two minutes.
CHUCK starts to protest, but DEAN strides over, pulls him up by the collar of his shirt, and punches a human, powerless CHUCK in the face. CHUCK falls back into the SAND, unconscious.
SAM and DEAN stumble back, shielding their eyes from the blinding light that grows brighter and brighter until…it suddenly stops, and we see CHUCK slumped on the ground, still bound, and AMARA lying next to him. JACK backs up, looking at something small glowing in his palm.
DEAN covers up his embarrassment by pretend growling and lifting LILLIAN up into the air above his head, making her fly around the room as CASTIEL watches fondly.
"Come on," she says, slinging my arm around her shoulders. The black wand is firmly gripped in her right hand. We stagger up the stairs towards the sound of shouting. Suddenly, Luna shoves me into an alcove on the first floor.
Alright, CHUCK. Party’s over!
Dean pulls Castiel to him, dragging him into his arms and holding him tight in a hug, running a hand through Castiel’s hair. He mumbles something into Castiel’s shoulder.
. You’re helpful at times, sure. But eventually you get rusty and used up, and then you’re useless. And you know what we do with things that ain’t useful anymore?
They have a stand off for a while, and DEAN keeps THE EMPTY distracted long enough for JACK to sneak up behind it and hold it still so DEAN is able to plunge the ANGEL BLADE into THE EMPTY’S heart.
,” Dean scoffs.
Give it up, boys. You’re never going to win!
Which part?
DEAN picks up the ANGEL BLADE, hands shaking
THE EMPTY grabs the angel blade and Dean’s arm, flipping him over and onto the ground, knocking the wind out of him, stealing the angel blade and pointing it at his throat.
THE EMPTY
“No, no, no, noooo. Let- let me finish.” Dean moves to sit up, setting his bottle down with a soft
Yeah, CAS; it’s me.
I-I...um,

"Unfortunately, yes. And it was difficult to get it to heal this much."
"I don't think so." She responds in her melodic lull. "I think this may be a remnant faction that has some claim to a spell to bring Voldemort back."
JACK moves back from DEAN and nods. Jack opens the rift to the Empty in the same spot Cas was taken.
We see the backs of SAM, DEAN, JACK, MICHAEL/ADAM, and GABRIEL with a cloudless sky, white sand, and blue waters in front of them. There’s the sound of waves, but no gulls, no voices. It’s eerily quiet.
, but it’s
When Dean is done pressing him for details, he kicks the wizard in the stomach, right where his sore intestines would be. I let the second breathe, and he says, "You-you're no muggle, are ye?"

"What?"

"I don't know!"

DEAN clears his throat.
Cas turns and squints at a horse making that sexy little furrow of his brow. "They seem to be some sort of invisible creature..."
DEAN finally reaches them, grabs THE EMPTY from behind and puts the angel blade to its neck.
Each word is punctuated by a punch to the face
Dean…
“And just because you tell me it’s real doesn’t mean I have to
For you.
CASTIEL (leans over to whisper in LILLIAN’s ear)
“How much further?” Dean grumbles along with his stomach; they’d been hiking in the woods for a little over an hour at this point, and for the past ten minutes have been scaling a near vertical slope of cliff. In the dark. Without breakfast.
We see barn doors opening and CASTIEL walks in. We flash through key bits of the 4x01 meeting, and we see CASTIEL say-
DEAN takes a step forward.
it is: a solid, black mass a few feet taller than him...but it keeps going, up and up for miles, up to a mountain of tan, and, so many miles up, is…
CAS closes his eyes as unconsciousness takes over him. DEAN shakes CAS’S shoulder, brow furrowed in frustration and worry.
"Dean, wait. She hasn't hurt anyone-"
Really?
Castiel jolts awake, opening his eyes for the first time in five years. “Dean.” It’s his first thought, his last thought, his every thought, so he says it. Something compels him to stand, to draw his angel blade, and to slice his own throat, letting his grace pour out and filter through the air into nothingness. Then he feels a hitch in his navel as his essence is collapsed like an imploding star.
CAS (v.o.)
He is about to open his eyes when he feels something very, very large shifting to his right. He feels warmth getting closer, and it’s only then that he realizes how cold he is. That son of a bitch could have done anything to him, and the
"Yeah, because dark creatures carry pistols."

AMARA sighs

It took him
Cut to a wide eyed CAS, then back to DEAN.
Wow wow wow oh wow, an ANGEL! And Sam is so lovely, he has a grand aura, and, oh, his way with the thestrals! Most people are put off by them, but he loves them as much as I do! This is so lovely! I thought I would have to obliviate Sam and his brother, but if they know an angel, then it must be okay for them to know about us; the ministry won't mind. Hermione will back me, for sure. I didn't know an angel could be in love, but the way he looks at Dean...yep. Its there.
Sam begins to speak when the door to the basement opens and a pair of Death Eaters enter. They come towards me and I don't try to fight, though Sam is enraged. "Leave her alone!" He yells at them until one sends a spell to silence him. They bind my hands magically with  chains and tie me up beside Sam. He tries to kick at them, but his legs are tied down too. Soon mine are as well.
I suddenly hear Dean's yells as the building continues shakes around us. Sawdust falls from the ceiling, sprinkling into our hair. I lean on Luna, surprised that her thin frame is able to bear my weight. She props me against the side of the door and takes hold on one broken wooden beams that fell from the ceiling. She stands on the other side of the door as it opens and one of the hooded figures rushes in. I watch in amazement as she lifts the heavy oak beam above her head to smash on the black hood. As he lays on the floor bleeding, she grabs his wand from his loose grip and binds him up with a quick spell.
, Cas.”
I lean against the wall, trying to find the most comfort I can in the awkward position. Luna rips the bottom of her dress and places the scrap on her head, wiping away the blood to reveal a nasty gash across her pale forehead. She fastens it into a knot around her forehead. She sits down next to me.
CASTIEL looks between JACK, DEAN, and RUBY, putting the pieces together and realizing that this is reality, and
Sam pauses, looking around the room & noticing the lack of a certain angel.
They are around the area where we tracked a nest of vamps, so there must be some sort of connection. I tell this to Sam, and we agree to go and check it out. Running through the woods, I can hear the snuffling of horses around me, and see yellow eyes in the dark. We slow to a walk and I pull out my blade; the vamp nest is just ahead. I motion to Sam and he moves to the left. We creep toward the nest, but the smell of rotten meat hits us. As we get closer I see a pile of bodies, and there are half a dozen of those creepy ass horses chowing down on them. I recognize the two vamps we were trailing; this must be the whole nest.
SNAP! When I open my eyes, the greenery and wetness of the swampy forest is gone. In its place stands a barren wasteland with mountains all around me, a Gothic style house placed awkwardly in the center of the sandy desert. The wand is snapped in half and Dean is nowhere to be found.
. Humans were not built to be this size, and the floor of the witch’s cabin is unforgiving, hard concrete, and it is
Without a word spoken, everyone joins up. DEAN hands JACK something and they nod at each other before they all teleport to-

I reach my hand out and it is stalled in min-air. "What..."
I leave the president stunned in his office, drool coming out of his mouth. The aides don't say anything so I imagine it's not the first time this has occurred. I bet that the Japanese prime minister had a turn in their meeting.
DEAN (to JACK, voice cracking)
Dean looks back and raises an eyebrow in the dark.
I hold out the black oak wand in front of me and focus on the core to try to track its last location before this swampy forest. Dean stands in front of me, his shirt drenched in sweat from the humidity of the night.
We hear a knock on the bunker door and see SAM and JACK look at each other in shock.
Hermione
. It took him b- because...because he...
Castiel’s mind works rapid-fire, trying to figure out a way to help Dean, some way to give him comfort. He realizes he, in and of himself, is probably adding to Dean’s anxiety ten-fold just by being there. He can sense with his grace that Dean is hurting, and that he is terrified, and, above all,
___________________________________________________________________________________
CASTIEL
I can feel the bowtruckle yawn and stretch on top of my head. It strolls across my head before jumping to climb up my arm. I look at my right wrist and I make out the outline of the bowtruckle looking at the lock in deep concentration, I strain my ears and hear the magical gears grinding before an audible click. My right side drops suddenly and I groan at the sudden rush of blood into my right arm. It scurries up the other side and I fall onto my knees. It runs down my back and I feel the heavy manacles fall from my ankles. It makes a loud clattering sound and I wince, hoping that nobody would come rushing in. The moment passes and I breathe a sigh of relief.  I can feel it tuck itself back into my headband and fall asleep.

I was really hoping Hermione would have a solution. I was counting on it really...Though Ron hates to admit it, we really wouldn't be here without her brains. I probably would've died at eleven. Hermione is muttering to herself and walking around the stone. After several minutes, when the bloke I've learned is named Dean is pacing so frantically he has made a rut in the ground, she finally exclaims, "I think I've got it!"
Dean scrambles out of bed and rushes down the hall, bursting into Castiel’s room.
Cross my heart. I know this doesn’t take away the fact that I said all that before, but...I need you to know I didn’t mean it. I was just...so
DEAN reaches out a hand and helps her to her feet.
I blink a few times, and look down at my left arm - or, where my left arm should be. "What the hell? Cas! Wha-what happened to my arm?!"

Ash looked at Cas and sighed. “Fine. Charlie and I are gonna head out. You have my number. Call me if you change your mind.”
"All yours, Sir," Dean responded as Cas lined his cock up with Dean's hole. "Fuck, yes, please. Please?"
Cas sat next to him and chuckled softly. “I swear, that girl. Dean, what did Charlie tell you about me?”
After all the crap you’ve pulled?

Sam was standing at the counter as he entered the kitchen, throwing impossibly green things into the blender. He stopped when Dean started the coffee machine and looked over, a smirk on his face. "Morning, Dean."
[Claire 3:01 AM] We’re staying at the Rodeway Inn on 275.
Garth looked at Cas carefully before looking back at Dean. "It's Cas. Cas is your boyfriend. How did we never see it?"
Cas pulled Dean in for a fierce kiss, bashing their lips and teeth together in desperate want. “You’re not moving fast enough.”
"I do apologize again, Mr. Mullens. As to your last question. I was laid off because the publishing house was downsizing. the pandemic has hit everyone hard."
The following day, Dean woke up to find Cas already out of bed. In his stead was the cursed beekeeper's suit. Dean groaned and pulled his pillow over his face before yelling into it. After getting his frustration out, he removed the pillow and sat up, looking at the suit again. An involuntary shiver went down his back, and he buried his face into the pillow again, letting out another string of curses and profanity.
“And it seems like you’re magically into dick now. What were we? Your beards?!”
“Stay down, or I will wake Cas up. And you know if he doesn’t knock your ass out, you’ll have to talk about what you said. About what we both heard.” Sam started to move towards the angel.
"Dean-o!" Garth exclaimed as he entered the room. "While I hate the circumstances, I'm glad to see you. It's not often I'll break my no friends, no family rule, but I get that it was an emergency."
“The door is locked…” Cas readjusted his grip, sliding both of Dean’s wrists under one hand. “If you don’t want to do this?”
"Even better." Cas nuzzled into Dean's neck. "I got the job."
Dean pulled up to the front of the
"You're doing great, Dean," Cas whispered against Dean's ear. "Now pull it out."
“So, no. You’re not.” Claire shook her head and laughed. “You’re standing there, preaching to me about telling someone you love them and protecting them. You’re doing the same damn thing with Cas.”
“It had nothing to do with the fact that your father would have aimed his shotgun at you?”
"No. Absolutely not. That was agreed upon when you asked me to move in, Cas!" Dean looked at his boyfriend, broken leg propped up on the ottoman. "Look, you endeared yourself to me with your love of those little fuzzy stinger bugs, but they're sure as hell not endearing!"
“Is that a yes?”
“You heard me, Dean. Dean, seriously. I need you to hear me out. The first Death Star, it was complete. The only people on there were Imperialists, right?” Cas looked down at Dean, his blue eyes piercing and mischievous. “It was storm troopers, sith lords, Darth Vader, right?”
“Sammy?” Dean turned his head and offered a half-smile. “So, to confirm, my Heaven is a motel?”
A grunt sounded from the other end of the call, causing Dean to roll his still closed eyes. “I need you to open the
Dean cocked his head to the side and looked down at Victor’s hand suspiciously.
Dean shrugged. “I just broke up with her.”
"Blow, Dean."
“Fuck, Cas.”
“Yeah, yeah. Thanks, Sunshine.” Dean watched as Cas walked out the door and let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding. He leaned over the counter, practically laying on top of it, and grabbed the paper Cas had put back. He quickly found the wedding announcements and read over it.
“Great comeback, Dean. Tell me. How’s it not the same?”
Later that evening, Dean pulled up in front of Cas’ house and honked twice. Cas came bounding out of the house, dressed up nicer than usual, wearing a light-colored button-down shirt and a pair of really nice jeans. Dean caught himself staring as Cas slid into the passenger side. He shook his head, confused. This was Cas. This was his best friend. He’s not supposed to look at his best friend like that.
"I did." Cas turned the phone back to himself and smiled at the inflatable unicorn costume on his screen. "It was very clever."
“It’s alright, Dean-O.” Garth walked over and clapped his hand on Dean’s shoulder. “I’m gonna get these guys to the rink. We’ll have someone cover your spot, and we’ll be able to continue our practice. Just sorry you won’t be there.”
[Claire 2:52 AM] You wouldn’t.
"Yes. I've been all over the industry. Started out as a copywriter for a small website. Moved my way up to Lead Editor at my last position." Cas dragged his short nails down Dean's back. Dean arched down in response, and Cas thrust deep into him again. Stars formed behind Dean's eyes, and he brought his hand to his mouth. He bit down on the fleshy part of his thumb, desperate to keep his noise to a minimum.
“I… uh…” Cas started to shake his no but changed to a nod. “You weren’t supposed to know. I know you don’t care about me like that, and I’m okay with that, and I don’t want this to—”
“Well, I am a fitness instructor.” Victor pulled out a card and handed it to Dean as he retrieved his change. “I’d be more than happy to get you back to a healthy weight.”
Dean blushed brightly and mentally kicked himself. "Hiya, Cas."
"Yeah, I'll take that to heart." Sam picked up the phone and read the screen that Dean had presented him.
6:44 AM
“Shut up, Charlie.”
A few moments of content silence passed between then when Lisa spoke up again. “Babe, I’m serious, though. You don’t have to do what your father tells you you have to do. You’re a grown man.”
“Right, you went up to Lisa, told her that I was going on a date with Cassie, and she wasn’t pissed. The sky is green, and the water’s red.” Dean stood up and walked out from behind the counter. “What was your real reason for telling her, Cas? You knew I wasn’t going on a date with Cassie when you told her.”
When Cas didn’t make any move to rest, Sam spoke up again. “Cas, please. You need to rest too. Meditate, sleep, whatever it is you need to do.”
"We ran into each other as he exited your room." Sam smiled smugly into his cup.
“John’s the emergency contact for the strip. If something happens, Marv said to call him.” Cas started scrolling through Dean’s phone.
“Better me than her.” Claire stopped. “Would you be willing to let a freshly human Cas go up against the Fomorian?”
“What!?”
"Yes, Sir."
“Are you fucking kidding me?” Dean reached into his pocket and pulled out his cell phone. “Maybe he just got the employee wrong.”
Sam chugged some of his drink. "Interesting. And how would you know that, Jerk? Cause you were still asleep when he left. He walked out with me when I went on my run."
John answered.
"But, you'd be happier if we could be us in front of others." Dean nodded and pulled his phone out of his pocket. He turned on the camera and set it for a selfie. "Then let's not hide anymore." He pressed his lips against Cas' cheek and snapped the photo. He looked at it for all of a moment, noting the surprising happiness on Cas' face before sending it in their group text.
"Yep. That's fine." Dean barely managed to squeak out.
“Oh my god, Dean. He’s just as scared as you. The thing took Cas when he confessed his feelings, so he never got to hear yours. He probably thought he’d never see you again. It’s probably easier for him to deny saying it by faking amnesia than to have to hear you say that you don’t love him.” She grabbed Dean’s arm and turned him around, leading him back towards the parking lot. “I can’t believe I live in a fucking rom-com.”
Dean nodded and pulled his phone out of his pocket. He shot off a quick text before meeting up with Sam.
Dean started to slowly turn the pipe in his hands, building up the momentum as he got used to the feel in his hands. Finally understanding the dexterity needed to turn the blowpipe, his mind started to wander again, wondering what Cas' nimble fingers would be able to do to him.
"Do you think they care, Dean?" Cas rested his hand on Dean's shoulder. “The fact that you’re here to pay your respects is what’s important to her family.”
“You said no, right?” Cas tilted his head and raised his eyebrow, the look causing Dean to wither in his spot. “You didn’t. Dean! She cheated on you. If you go out with her, she’s going to be cheating on her fiance. And if something does happen between you two, who’s to say she won’t cheat on you again!” He rolled his eyes in disbelief. “You’re going to tell her no.”
He sat by the sliding door that led to the backyard, waiting for Dean to make his appearance. He had managed to get comfortable, his foot upon a stool as he leaned back in the heavily cushioned chair Dean had brought with him when he moved in. Cas slowly sipped his coffee, reading an article on his phone when a flash of orange caught his attention. He looked up and squinted in the direction of the figure before he realized what he was looking at.
“It’s not a big deal? You said you fucked three guys! Do I need to go get tested?”
“I know you do, Cas. And I’ve told you before, you’re about to have me.” Dean swallowed as he quickly contemplated his next words. “Cas. I want you to chase me. I want you to catch me, pounce on me, claim me as yours. But I need a headstart.”
Cas released Dean’s cock and focused on driving every movement deeper and harder, hoping that this release would be the one to free him from the siren’s venom. He tumbled over the edge, collapsing on top of Dean as he filled his hunter for the second time. Cas lay there for a moment, catching his breath and worshipping Dean’s body with small kisses. “I’m sorry.”
"Then what the hell is this?" Dean pulled out his phone and slammed it down on the table, flinching slightly and picking it back up to check the screen. "I don't understand this."
“He likes that?” Dean shrugged. “I mean, it’s not my thing but to each their own. But now I’m not gonna get that image out of my head. I mean, Andrea’s with Benny now, so I’m assuming she did that in the past with Alistair. Now I need to know if Benny’s into that.”
"I'm glad to see that you've all come dressed for the weather, but working here in the shop?" Cas took a moment to point at himself. "It gets hot. Today's session is introductory, so we won't be working with the furnaces today, but next week? You're going to either want to dress for in here or bring a change of clothes. Lighter fabrics are better. Short sleeves are fine. Jeans are preferred to protect your legs."
“Flatterer. You’re going to get me without pretty words.” Desiree placed her hand on Cas’ and continued pushing him backward. “You look absolutely delectable.” She leaned in for a kiss, only for Cas to deny her. “Fair enough. But I promise you that I kiss just as well as I suck.”
“I get the feeling Castiel still doesn’t like me.” Cassie quipped once Cas had left. Another customer had entered the store, and she stepped to the side so he could make his purchase. “You would think that time would have fixed that.”
Dean climbed out of bed and grabbed his robe. If it was going to be a miserable morning, the least he could do was get his coffee fix and try and make the best of it.
Dean shivered involuntarily and nodded. He gave a quick look around before shifting slightly and removing his hand from his face. Dean slowly reached into the casket while forcing a sob.
“The shop would have been closed until Kevin gets here at noon.”
“Explain to me why you bought into that?”
A wicked smile crossed the woman’s face. “Sounds good, handsome.”
6:03 AM
Cas and Gabriel nodded in agreement. Cas slid the rod back into the furnace and scraped it against the crucible, removing the molten glass off of it. "It's not uncommon to mess up in this line of work. and while we can carefully remove smaller errors, say the stem for a wine glass crooked, sometimes scrapping the whole piece is the unfortunate way to go." Cas looked at the end of the rod. "Alright. I'm going to demonstrate one more time before we go back to the benches. Observe."
Especially ‘cause Cas was a dude.
Dean started to reply when a customer walked up to the counter. “Hey, look, I’m sorry. I usually don’t do this, but I was wondering. What were you talking about?”
If there was one thing that Dean was not particularly fond of, it was his birthday. It was another reminder that a whole year had passed, and he was still alive, still stuck, still single. He had nothing to show for his years on the planet, and each year that passed was another punch to the gut.
"Of course I do, Dean. I have no control at the moment. I just sent my resume out to ten different companies, and I'm sitting here praying that one of them will actually take me."
Dean took the paper from Cas. “Lydia?” He read over the obituary. “Cancer. Left behind a daughter.” Dean felt himself tear up as he set the paper down. “How long has it been?”
Dean lifted his arm slowly, waiting to see if Sam would smack him again, and ran his fingers through his hair. “Takes one to know one.”
Dean tapped on the bed, and Cas leaned down, melding against Dean's back as he reached under and wrapped his hand around the base of Dean's cock, squeezing it. "I'm sorry, one moment Mr. Mullens. My cat is trying to get into the office with me." Cas stroked Dean's cock before bringing his fingers to Dean's mouth and shoving them inside. "Suck, Dean, and stay quiet."
As she slid to her knees, Cas slid his angel blade down into one hand as he caught Desiree by the chin with the other. “I said smart. Not clever.” He brought the point of his blade against her neck. “Scream, and no one will hear you. Are you working alone, or is there another one of you?” Cas’ eyes started to glow blue as he emphasized his threat.
“Thank you, Sam.” Cas dismissed the conversation quietly and relaxed into a resting position.
“You don’t know what happened, as you were not in the store, but a short time after your return, You heard an ear-piercing scream. You ran to the back of the store, knocked three times, then when she wouldn’t answer, you knocked on the door. When there was no answer, you opened the food to find Miss Robinson curled up in a ball on the floor and Mr. Michaels dead on the toilet.”
John scoffed. “
Cas shook his head. “Nope.” The bell chimed, and they both looked over, with Cas the one speaking up. “Hey Ash, Charlie.”
Sam nodded as he held open Dean’s eye to continue checking on him.
Cas how to make that shot. But tonight, it was all part of the plan. There was a creature—possibly a pair—going after people in the area.
“I am.” Dean stood up straight and closed his magazine. “See you’re back in town to plan your wedding.”
Cas looked down at Gabriel and glared. "Donna and Jody, I figured since this is your wedding gift to one another, you'd like to be partnered up." When they nodded, he pointed to the first bench. "Balthazar will be with you guys in a moment." Cas turned and looked to Kevin and Krissy. "I'm leaving the two of you in Gabe's capable hands. If anything, you two can bribe him with sweets, and you'll have the best instructor on the planet." He pointed at the second bench, and the teens walked over to it with Gabriel. Once they were situated, Cas turned back to Dean. "Hello, Dean."
Dean lifted his hand and pointed at Claire, licking his lips as his brain sputtered, trying to think of a response. “It’s not the same.”
“How do you think? Sam was worried sick about you. He told Jody, and I overheard.” Claire stared at him. “You didn’t deny it either.”
“Sorry, Dean.” Cas pulled out his own cell phone.
"Alright then, any other questions?" Met with headshakes, Cas continued. "As you remember, this is a blowpipe. Who here knows what a honey dipper is?" Donna, Jody, and Dean raised their hands, causing Cas to laugh. "Kids these days. They don't have the experience of getting honey out of the jar. They just have the bears, and they only need to
[Cas, 10:15 AM]: I'm sorry to have made things uncomfortable for you.
“What time in that time frame?”
“Hey.” Cas tugged on him. “HEY! DEAN! We need to go!”
"You sent her a picture of my text with Cas?" Dean tossed back the rest of his whiskey and poured himself another. "What the actual hell?"
“Cas and Kaia can cover it for a bit.” Dean shoved his hands in his jacket pockets as he started walking into the park. The ride over had been quiet— Claire’s silent seething had spoken enough for the both of them —and Dean was thankful to be out of the car and out in the open. “Why don’t you think Kaia can handle offering the tribute?”
“I’m saying we yell at each other to have faith in the people we love, we let them handle the Fomorian, and then we tell them how we feel. Think you can handle that, Hasselhoff?”
Cas raised his eyebrow and smirked. "And it had nothing to do with the idea that you weren't out of the closet yet?"
“Will you, boy?”
[Claire 2:43 AM] Just need help with the lore.
“And it sounds like the police are chalking it up to freak events,” Cas added. “That’s nothing new.”
Dean pushed the tape into the deck and started the trek to Cas’ house. They didn’t speak much — they didn’t need to — and they relaxed as Dean followed the now well-known drive. As he pulled into the driveway, Steve Perry’s voice started serenading through the speakers. Cas climbed out of the Impala and waited for Dean at the door. As Dean joined him, he noticed that cool, calm, collected Cas was vibrating nervously.
After hanging it up, he went up to the roof, gear in hand, and looked around at his team. There weren’t many things Dean could say made him happy. He could probably count those things on one hand.
“What’s your point, Cas?”
The ball dropped, and Lee pounced, going after it before Nick could get to it. Dean joined him on his right while Aaron zoomed in from Lee’s left. Together, Dean and Aaron blocked Zeke and Noah to keep them from the ball, and Lee quickly outmaneuvered Nick. The distance from where Garth had dropped the ball to the other makeshift goal was covered rapidly, and Lee shot the ball.
It was no secret to Dean that Cas was gay. They’d known each other for years, having met in elementary school. In high school, while Dean was with Cassie, Cas had been crushing on some guy named Balthazar. Balt had been a few years ahead of them and out of the closet. His being out and popular had given Cas all the encouragement he needed to come out.
Through the posts.
The bell over the door rang. Dean signed, not bothering to look up from his magazine unless it was…
"YOU DID CALL HIM!"
None of them were his best friend. More specifically, the best friend he’d been in love with since high school. None of them would ever compare to Cas.
“Really, Dean. Is that a way to talk to an old friend, an old
Cas tilted his head in confusion before his eyes widened in realization. “You two first bonded over not having mothers.”
“In a row?”
Dean turned around, and he swore that the room jumped another fifty degrees. The man - Cas - who had walked into the workspace was every single one of Dean's dream features wrapped in a modern-day Adonis. Tall, broad shoulder, thick thighs, dark brown hair, and bright blue eyes? Yep. Without a doubt, Dean was screwed.
“Nah, get your closure. You know me and enclosed spaces with too many people.” Cas held out his hand for Dean’s keys.
Dean swallowed as he thought over the day. While he wasn’t sure that Cas was trying to make a move, every little thing Cas did— even when they were fighting —was in Dean’s best interest. As Charlie had even pointed out, Cas had brought him lasagna. But there was no way that Cas knew that Dean was going to be in. Which meant that Cas had sacrificed his own lunch, knowing how much Dean loved his lasagna.
“I will.” Cas fiddled with keys for a moment before looking at Dean. With his cold, blue eyes piercing into Dean’s very soul, Cas said only three words before exiting the store. “Make good choices.” Cas nodded towards Cassie and shook his head, causing Dean to think about the message that was being delivered.
Cas had gotten up earlier than usual. He was an early riser to begin with, even if he needed coffee to function. Still, he wanted to make sure that Dean had the bee suit and that he had a front-row seat to what would most likely be chaos. Cas did feel slightly guilty that Dean would be taking care of his bees for the next few weeks —had he mentioned to Dean that it would be weeks? He may have forgotten that part.— but as he had told Dean previously, those hives were his livelihood.
The crowd started swarming up to the counter, angrily chanting ‘Cancer Merchant” at Dean. He backed up, stumbing slightly as he hit the rear counter. As his original customer started climbing over, Dean reached for the shotgun his father kept under the counter.
“Your point?”
"And with good reason, it appears." Cas took Dean's hand and held it tightly. "Dean, do you know how much you mean to me?"
A record scratched, and the bar went silent. At least it did in Dean's brain.
Dean didn’t even bother to look up as he shook his head. “Morning, Cas.”
“It’s my day off.”
Cas nodded reluctantly before making his way over and grabbing a seat. As he sat down, he noticed two drinks and looked over at Dean. “Either of these yours, Dean?”
As he stood behind the counter and flipped through the magazine, a cough caused him to look up. “Hey. Sorry.” Dean stood up and started scanning the items the man was buying.
Cas growled against Dean’s ear, lightly nipping at it before plopping back into his seat. “You won’t let anything like that happen to us. As much as you joke about giving me blue balls, you want a pink ass and to not be able to walk for a week.”
Instead of pulling off, Cas continued, using his mouth and tongue to work Dean up to release. Dean let go of Cas' hair and gripped the countertop, white-knuckling it for support and stability as Cas pushed him over the edge. "Holy shit, Sunshine. That... That was unexpected."
Dean’s pleas appeared to work. Cas slid his mouth off with an audible pop, a trail of precum dangling from his lip to the tip of Dean’s throbbing dick. Cas’ eyes were slightly less glassy as he looked along Dean’s body. “Ol hoath.” Cas stood up and snapped his fingers, causing the rest of Dean’s clothes to disappear. He shucked off his own shirt, tossing it to the side as he kicked off his shoes. “Ol hoath, ol blans uls doalim.” Cas leaned down, capturing Dean’s mouth with his own and worshipping it softly. “Do you want me to keep going, or do you want me to stop? I can go and work this out of my system another way.”
[Dean 2:50 AM] I’m already dressed and packed.
The man ignored Dean. “It has been a while, my dear. I don’t see you around the diner anymore. Do you work here now?”
"You said I couldn't, Sir," Dean whined. "I want to, but I respect your punishment."
Cas carefully slid out of the car, holding Dean’s head still and steady. Once he was outside, Sam wrapped his arms under his brother’s and slowly started to pull Dean out of the backseat. As soon as Dean was out, Cas moved back in and resumed his original bridal carry of the older Winchester. Sam closed the car door, looking around briefly before moving to their motel room. Cas walked slowly behind him, each step purposeful and precise.
Cas slid out of his chair and made his way to Dean. He wrapped his arms around Dean’s waist and held him for a moment, breathed him in before taking the pool cue into his own hands. “You smell incredible, Dean.”
Kaia forced a laugh as she switched beds and sat next to Claire. “You’re lucky that’s all you lost.”
“I uh, I don’t know how I missed this.” He folded the paper and turned it around. It was the obituaries. At the top in the center, a name caught his attention.
“Cas?” Dean strained against the fabric pinning his legs in place. He reached for Cas, keening as his hands were slapped away. “Cas, please. Please, please. You’ve caught me, you’ve marked me, and now I really want to feel you.”
Sam picked up his blade, as well as Dean’s, and closely followed behind Cas. They were able to get out of the building without being ambushed, and Sam quickly led the way to the Impala. As they approached, Sam pulled his set of keys out of his pocket and rushed ahead to open the passenger side back door for Cas. He stepped back and watched as Dean was gently laid down on the backseat as far as Cas could manage. The angel then headed around to the other side and got into the back seat, pulling Dean in the rest of the way and partially into his lap.
“You mean the injury Cassie Robinson gave you?” Victor waggled his eyebrows. “Oh, I remember that. You two had that huge blowup after the semi-final game. She kicked your knee in, dislocating it. I can see that you never even tried to get into shape afterward.”
“Cas and I weren’t going to let you do that.” Sam grabbed Dean’s wrist and checked his pulse while watching his chest rise and fall with some difficulty. “Your one lung is punctured, but once Cas has regained some of his grace, he’s going to finish healing you up.”
“Drop the damn ball, Garth!” Benny called out. “We ain’t gonna get any practice done with your yappin’.”
"Is Sir bringing out stuff to play with?" Dean smiled, his grin broadening mischievously.
"He left a note on my bed," Dean responded quickly.
“Damn right you are, and don’t you be sassing me.” She slid a packet of paper towards him. “Care to tell me why you failed the last three tests in a row? I know you ain’t stupid.”
across the makeshift sign.
Dean nodded in agreement. “Yeah, well, I’m at the point I want the cops to be ignorant. You see how they are on a regular basis. Imagine what they’d do if they knew that the supernatural were real. No creature would be safe.”
"I don't have a shit list, Dean. I have an 'I'm disappointed in you' list, and right now, you're at the top of it." Garth pointed at his own jaw. "Your wisdom tooth is cracked. From not taking care of it and the nougat. I have to pull it."
“What are we doing here?” Claire slammed the passenger side door and glared at Dean over the top of the Impala. “We have work to do.”
Dean jabbed his finger in Sam's direction. "You... You don't know what you're talking about." He turned and started to storm off, stopping only to backtrack and grab his coffee before retreating to his room.
“Stop solving my damn puzzles, man.” Dean double-checked the hint and space before rolling his eyes. “I would have gotten there eventually.”
Dean swallowed before nodding again. He crossed over to the furnace and gathered up some glass on the end of his rod. He kept spinning it as he pulled it out before looking to Cas.
“Aww, come on, Dean!” Ash reached across the counter and tried to pat Dean’s shoulder, just to have his hand slapped away. “Holy shit.”
Cas dragged his hand down his face, removing his glasses as he went. He rubbed his eyes and shook his head. Clearly, his suit must not have fit Dean, but this was the last thing he expected. He honestly thought that Dean would have come stomping into the living room and shown that the suit didn't fit. Instead, Dean found something else to wear just to make sure he could care for his bees. Cas bit down on the end of his glasses before deciding to grab his phone. Surely a little video of Dean in costume taking care of his bees would be allowed, right?
Sam shoved the angel blade he wielded up through his attacker’s chin and pushed the corpse to the ground. He barely registered Cas vaulting by to keep the demon from getting a finishing blow on Dean. Sam was too focused on Dean. He ran over to his brother, falling to his knees, and gently lifted Dean’s head into his lap. “Dean? Dean, are you with me?” He slapped Dean’s cheek and was rewarded with a flinch and grunt.
"And it has nothing to do with Cas leaving this morning?" Sam turned on the blender to keep Dean from answering. He pulsed it several times, stopping long enough for Dean to start to answer before turning it back on again. "Sorry about that. Just needed to make sure this is all mixed." He grabbed a cup and poured the puke green mixture into it before taking a sip. "So, Cas left this morning?"
“Right, let me just pull one of those out of my ass.” Claire huffed. “It wouldn’t listen to me.”
“You’re the best, Dean-O. Not sure how your old man kept you here when you could have gone anywhere, but we’re glad you’re here.” Ash took a drag of the joint and passed it back to Charlie. “Just a heads up, you got five until you’re officially open.”
“And this was all purely based on your personal politics and morals,” Dean offered.
"You act like I'm done with you." Cas got to his feet and pulled on Dean's shirt. His eyes were dark with lust and arousal. "You can't return the favor that way, but I know another way."
“THIRTY-SEVEN? I’M THIRTY-SEVEN? YOU’VE SUCKED THIRTY-SEVEN DICKS?”
"Hello, Castiel Novak speaking." Dean looked back over his shoulder, wide-eyed, as Cas answered the call balls deep inside of him. "Yes, hello, Mr. Mullens. I did."
“Oh… uh… I uh…” Dean started stammering when a throat clearing saved him. He looked up and relaxed, a smile broadening over his face when he saw who it was. “Cas.”
"Really?" Dean felt his jaw drop a second time. "You're not going to break up with me?
“Mrs. Moseley? If this is a formality, why do I need to help him?” Castiel just confirmed Dean’s suspicion. “I know Dean is smart.”
“Dude, don’t apologize to me, apologize to you. You want to live your life to the fullest, right? You can add a year of life for each pound you lose.”
“I didn’t know who knew or didn’t know. I couldn’t risk outing him to someone who would then go and tell the rest of the town.”
“Can I get the key to the bathroom, please?” Dean let out a sigh. The customer was a regular. He’d buy a porno and head back to the bathroom to jerk off. Dean grabbed the key to the restroom and handed it to the guy, along with his change. “Thank you.” As predicted, he made his way back, porno mag tucked up under his arm.
Sam quickly unlocked their door and opened it, entering the room and grabbing the lights. He flicked on the closest light to him and turned just in time to watch Cas lay Dean down on his bed. Sam closed the door before moving to his own bed. “Cas, you said you needed to rest? What do I need to watch for so you can get your grace built back up?”
“Lis, I don’t know what to do. I wasn’t even supposed to be here today, but the old man called and said ‘jump.’” Dean looked up at Lisa from his spot in her lap. He let out a sigh as she pet his hair and snuggled closer.
“Seriously? Look, I know you think I’m stupid, but even I know that Ahn isn’t Japanese, it’s Korean.”
"Because he wants more!" Sam dragged his hand down his face. "I know you can't see what a good guy you are under the self-doubt that Dad piled on top of you, but Cas does. If anyone knows you better than me, it's Cas. He rebuilt you from the ground up. He knows you inside and out, heart, body, and soul."
“Not our first rodeo, but if I’m on top…” Dean waggled his eyebrows before finding himself on top of Cas. “Well, you made that decision easy enough.”
"I know what you said, doesn't mean I'm not going to be disappointed that I can't find a job," Cas grumbled and ran his fingers through his hair. "We're a team. We're supposed to work together."
4:51 PM
“I’m going to work. Maybe when you’re done here, and we meet up later, you’ll have calmed the fuck down.” Lisa shoved the door open and stormed outside.
Dean's brain pulled a 404, not finding any coherent thought as Cas' lips wrapped around the rod. The image was obscene - at least to Dean - and the only thing he could picture was those lips around his dick. He forced his eyes closed and quickly blinked, trying to get the dirty image out of his mind and focus on the skills that Cas was showing to inflate the molten glass.
“My grace is no good to me if you’re dead, Dean.” Cas closed his eyes, straining as he furthered his own exhaustion.
[Dean 3:04 AM] Make sure there’s coffee.
"I uh... Whatever." Dean dragged his hand down his face, Garth's comments sobering him better than any dunk in cold water ever could. "Am I good to go?"
“Sounds good, Cas.” Dean quickly skimmed through the menu, picking his dinner, and waited for Cas. “So, how did the rest of your day go? We didn’t really get to talk today like we usually do.”
“You were regularly getting laid, Dean,” Cas teased before running his tongue along Dean’s jaw.
“I’m sure you will.”
“Two packs of Nails?” The customer pointed up to the cigarette rack. “Menthol, please.”
“Yeah. Same goes for the second one, though.” Dean pulled out a box of candy and started counting. “It’s an Imperial war machine. Why would it be bad to blow that one up?”
