The merriment had obviously gone on splendidly without them and they came in on a spectacular display of Bobby and Queen Ellen dancing their hearts out alongside Sam and Jessica. Dean walked them around the back of the crowd to the dais and they watched the display from the best seats in the house.
Abaddon and Crowley looked on in horror as a small, floating, white figure came down the staircase at inhuman speeds, “Hi! I’m Jack!” it greeted them with a tiny little wave of a transparent hand. The small, shy smile on the oversized round head faded quickly as the two living people in front of him began to scream. Jack cringed and tried to stop them, “You shouldn’t do that! You’ll wake up—” he stopped when the ground under the intruder’s feet began to tremble. The small ghost gave a longsuffering sigh, “Too late,” he let himself fade away, not wanting to be seen.
After another half hour of driving through a thick forest without any sign of civilization, they finally drove up to an old, iron gate.
“Sisters,” Abaddon snapped, “All Hallows Eve has become a night of fun!” she hissed, “Children wear costumes and run amuck!”
Deeming it a lost cause, he read it aloud regardless, “’Buccaneers and buried gold. Hunters doth a treasure hold.”
Dean leaned down, and gave his husband a soft kiss, “How’s that for a contract? I’m gonna go tell the kids.”
“Dean! Let us out of here!” Dean just looked at his shoes on Crowley’s feet. He pulled them off with a smirk before kicking over the cauldron with the potion. He dragged Sam out the door before he stopped saying.
The kids were so busy trying to get their parents to understand, that they didn’t notice the witches coming into the room until Sam shouted, “They’re here!” Dean looked over at the middle of the dancefloor where Ruby had wandered, looking for them. He handed Cas the book and ran for the stage.
He carefully made his way over to the cottage. It was two stories and made of stone. There was a small creek that ran next to it, and there was a mill attached. He creeped over to a window and peered inside.
Azazel’s yellow tinged eyes rolled in annoyance. He was just here to read the will, not get involved in a post-mortem family feud, “No, it was lousy about fifty years ago. Now it’s condemned,” he slid the folder containing the deed over to the annoyed red head, and left the room, leaving her with a final, “Enjoy.”
They were startled out of their thoughts by a bus screeching to a halt beside them. The doors opened up and the driver looked them up and down.
“Why, it’s a road!” Abaddon proclaimed stepping onto the road, “Now, my book!” the witches set off down the road, but didn’t get very far. A strange beast was coming towards them. A monstrous roar and flashing lights speeding down the street. The sisters gave a panicked scream and ran away from the fire truck.
The door to the kiln burst open and the witches stepped out. A little charred, a little smoldering. And a lot mad.
Abaddon flung open the door of the house, holding the broom. She sighed happily, things were looking up, “Into the night sky!” she enchanted, rising into the air.
“There’s a light switch around here somewhere,” Cas said, feeling along the wall, his already gravelly voice more rough than usual. Dean squinted at the counter that held the ancient cash register. There was a small stand on the counter that held collectable cigarette lighters.
Sam’s eyes widened in panic, “Hide! Hide!” he said, ushering the kids behind some large items. Because he knew the two of them had no business being in the attic, he bent down, and pulled Gabriel into a kiss. They’d had plans to marry before everything had happened, so it would surprise nobody if they were in the attic for a rendezvous. Gabriel stood up on his tip toes and had just wrapped his arms around Sam when they were interrupted by the sound of someone clearing their throat. The two men jumped apart as if they hadn’t been expecting it.
She found her way into another bedroom. This one, thankfully, only had one full bed. There was a private bathroom and a balcony overlooking the ocean below it. The ceiling had a fascinating spiral that centered in the light fixture. It almost looked less dusty than the rest of the house, which she wasn’t going to complain about. This room would be perfect for her. She dropped her bags on the floor and plopped down on the surprisingly comfy mattress, and called out, “Dad! I found my room!”
Claire smiled after her. The guy seemed like a douche, but maybe she could make friends with the pretty girl.
Sam smiled, after taking off the mask, he was left in just his flannel shirt and blue jeans, “Thank you, I really like yours too,” he said. Cas was wearing a simple suit, with a sky-blue tie. But what made it look amazing were the huge, black wings attached to the back, “I couldn’t wear anything like that. I don’t have the body, yet. Dean likes your body…in fact…he loves it.”
Roman led Dean and Cas down the hall to yet another gorgeous bedroom, “I hope you will find this to your liking.”
That did it. Teachers, students, parent chaperones, they all ran screaming out of the manor, leaving nothing but torn decorations and crumbled food in their wake. Claire and Jack shared a look, both more amused than anything. She could hear her dad laughing his head off from the second floor.
Claire sat in a chair along the wall, the only wallflower left, it appeared. She watched as classmate after classmate was invited to dance, trying not to let the sting hurt as she was constantly passed over. She didn’t even have anyone to talk to…this attempt at making friends was not going too well, apparently.
Dean pounded on the door with the heavy knockers, and turned to his kids, “All right, kids, you know that when you work with dad and papa you have to be on your best behavior, right?” they nodded, and he looked at the elegant door, “Look at the size of these knockers,” he muttered. They would have to get nice pictures taken of this. He turned to Cas, “You ever see anything like that before?” Cas shook his head as the door creaked open.
“Oh, but when I’m working hard like this it doesn’t matter so long as I’m bringing home expensive gifts, right?” Dean coldly said, motioning to the watch he had given Cas for their anniversary. He immediately regretted saying that when Cas’s eyes filled with hurt. Before he could apologize, Cas was removing the watch, and throwing it onto the bed before stalking off to the bathroom and locking the door. Dean hurried after him, “I didn’t mean to say that, okay? Angel, please open the door, I’m sorry,” there was no response, and Dean couldn’t blame him. He decided to give him his space and turned to leave, only to jump at the sight of Roman standing right behind him. He hadn’t even heard the door open.
Her Dad nodded, before patting her on the head, “Night Nephie,” she rolled her eyes at the nickname. Dad had always said that Papa was his angel, making her their little Nephilim. Nephie used to be his favorite thing to call her, but it happened less and less over the last two years. It used to annoy her, but now she cherished every time he would call her that. She never knew if it would be the last time.
Cas had given up on waiting for Dean to come back, and just decided to go find him. He was walking down the hall to check on the kids when he saw someone come out of one of the bedrooms. It was a very short man wearing an apron, and holding a stack of towels, “Oh, hello,” Cas greeted, politely, “Have you seen my husband?” the man stared at him with wide eyes, before turning around and scurrying off down the hall, “Excuse me,” Cas tried to stop him. When the man didn’t stop, Cas hurried after him, “Wait!”
Dean sighed. ‘Sorry it was a lot. Then I was drunk and I’m still getting over it.’ He forced a snort of a laugh through his nose.
Dean finally stepped back. His clothes were still around his ankles and he pulled off his boots and stepped out of them.
As soon as Dean was in the car he was racing. His foot pressed the gas a little too hard, and the speedometer ticked just over the speed limit. But he didn’t want to stop, weaving in and out of cars to get to his street.
“From Him,” Cas simply replied. And then he led down on his back to stare at his ceiling. Meg was sure he wouldn't move for a while.
‘Want to dance Dean?’ Anna gave him a charming smile and he shook his head. She shrugged and moved out onto the dance floor to let Inias spin her until she looked dizzy.
He stayed seated at the bar, as he looked up at Dean, his bright eyes even wider and his lips, open just a fraction. Dean suddenly felt overwhelmed by how pink and plump they were, how good they might look wrapped around his-
Cas remembered he was at work and it was a quiet day as it wasn’t a peak time shift. Classes had just begun and he made his way around the tables, cleaning them and kindly giving top ups for the few people that were in there. He remembered they were quiet enough that he could sit behind the till on his phone, texting Meg and that his boss was able to stay out back pretty much the whole time.
They had pretty much set the whole stall up, they were just waiting on Cas with flyers. Liddy looked so relieved when she saw him although she didn't even greet him. Instead he quickly took off his work shirt and folded it neatly on a chair behind him and pulled a woolly old jumper from his bag and over his head. Comfort.
“What are you doing?” Cas laughed. Dean had propped open the fridge door with a carton of milk, and it shone in strange patterns on their faces. Neither of them awake enough to turn the overhead light on, too bright.
But who was that? A professor? Sam gave a small wave to the guy that exited with him, along with the girl as he noticed Dean's car and came walking over.
feel?” Dean asked. “About me,” Cas just shook his head. “Ahh c'mon,” Dean said, “I thought we were sharing,”
Cas only remembered eating too much on Christmas day, and short phone calls with his brothers and father. The three of them drank a lot and Meg went out in the evening to meet a guy she'd been seeing for a while. Leaving Dean and Cas to dance, drunk around the apartment until falling into bed with each other.
The next morning he did the same. He asked Rufus to give him all of his tasks, he made an excuse about giving Rufus a break as he always stayed at the garage, keeping it running smoothly when Bobby, Dean and half of the team were out at race events. Rufus seemed confused but let Dean take over his workload, only stopping briefly for a quick lunch.
He was doing this. He was actually pacing down a corridor of offices scanning each of them until he saw it. The little plastic plaque that read:
Cas stood outside his apartment building, hands in his pockets, patient. It was only October but he wore his coat and favourite dark red scarf. Perhaps the cold weather was going to come early this year. He'd had a text from Dean telling him that he was on his way to pick him up. The pair were going away for a weekend trip together.
‘I was hoping I could take you up on that offer. To borrow the Jonathan Butler book?’ Sam looked down at his shoes.
Dean stepped forwards, wrapping his arms around Cas' waist. Cas beamed, pulling himself up to snake his arms around Dean’s neck, his head resting on his chest. They rocked slowly, wrapped in each other.
Well I woke today (6.11.20) to post this chapter to DESTIEL TRENDING WTF ?!?! I haven't seen the full episode but I'm aware of THAT SCENE. I have a lot of feelings and the season isn't even over yet !?
The closer they got the more his face seemed pained, almost as if he was angry at his own body. But he had come. Castiel had coaxed it out of him, their foreheads pressed together, his eyes opened to see Castiel. Staring so intently as his body shuddered and finished over their hands and Castiel’s stomach.
Cas gently moved, taking Dean out of him. Then swiftly he bent down and took him in his mouth. Dean's head reeled back again. Cas only had to work over him for a moment and then he hit his sweet spot. Cas swallowed and watched him as he twitched. Laughing.
“I promise, I promise,” Dean told him, bringing their foreheads together to rest against one another’s. Wiping the wet from Cas' face. Cas pulled Dean in close, his arms around his neck as Dean rested his face in the crook of his neck.
Dean pulled up near the back of the parking lot. He didn’t want to risk Cas seeing his car and confronting him.
He stood against the wall, drink in hand. Although he was alone he was kind of enjoying himself. Just watching people and the music was good. Eventually the alcohol would do its job and he was sure he'd get talking to some people. It was at this point he clocked a girl staring at him. He fidgeted, feeling a little uncomfortable. He could tell by her expression that she was more than interested. Cas felt almost guilty. It wasn't like that for him.
It may be a spoiler but I just want to preface this chapter with the fact that none of the characters in this fic go to hell after confessing their gay love - so if that's what you came for I'm sorry :'D
“Yeah,” Dean bit his lip. Dean was petrified. The last relationship he had had was with Joe. And this was so different.
But Dean was swaying, clearly more drunk than usual and Castiel could even smell the beer and sweat.
Cas wanted to study art too. In truth, he was a painter and that was one of the things the pair had in common. However his father disagreed. It's not that he didn't agree with Castiel being an artist, it's just that he wanted him to get a degree in something more
Hester and Anna had more questions for Castiel about his new position at the university. Questions Dean had never thought to ask and he sat quietly, sipping from his wine as Castiel explained the modules he taught, the levels, the papers and journals he was writing for or contributing to. It was stuff Sam would be interested in, could discuss in depth but Dean just nodded and tried not to give away that he was a total dunce.
Castiel didn’t follow motorsport. Occasionally, in passing, Dean would mention needing to be up early for a practice session or a race the following morning as he would leave Castiel’s. But even if Cas wanted to ask there was never the chance. Dean had made it clear he wanted to fuck first, talk never. And Castiel, as with everything else hadn’t pushed him.
Every time he played it back in his mind he wondered if he'd got it right. But it hurt so badly when he did, it must have been right. He remembered it all, all too well.
At work the following day Cas shuffled as he sat in his chair. He couldn’t forget the sensation. His ass still felt raw, like Dean’s cock was still there nestled up inside him. The sex had been so intimate, so hot and yet loving. Cas knew the pleasure was hazing his judgement, having him believe he and Dean were something they weren’t and for the third morning in a row he had woken with Dean's hard dick pressed up against his ass, reminding him of the way he was stupidly falling for a man he could barely even ask on a date to a wedding.
Before Cas left he found a piece of scrap paper and a pen. He scrawled a quick note and then left it on her bed side table. On it, he wrote his phone number and
They kissed fast, the stranger dropped his lips to place rough, fast kisses down Dean's neck, his hands came up to find his waist.
“I'm sorry baby,” Cas mock apologised, rubbing Dean's chest. “It just would have been so messy otherwise.” He laughed.
‘It’s the best. Well... yeah... the best!’ Dean nodded, bringing his forehead down to touch Castiel’s.
The guy wouldn’t look at Castiel again, at least not in the eye. They sat in silence and the fair haired guy had given him some tissues to wipe his hands with.
“Hmm...” Dean responded, but he didn't open his eyes. Cas waited, holding back his words. A while passed, probably 10 minutes, and both of their breathing had reached relaxed now.
He moved straight through the front door, not checking to see if his dad was up and quickly locked himself away in his room.
The alcohol and the win had really given him a sense of overwhelming courage and he suddenly didn’t realise why he was holding back.
The kitchen was pitch black besides the faint glow of the refrigerator light. He could see Dean, bent down, peering inside. He hummed gently and Cas could recognise his stature anywhere.
He called in sick at work and went through the motions of picking up the phone to call Dean and apologise but put it down again. If Dean wanted to see him again, he would. The key was always there and sure enough, a week later when Castiel was actually showering again and preparing to go back to work the next day, Dean showed up in the early hours, stomping through the house. Cas sat up, half asleep.
By the end of October and into November, when Cas wasn't working they spent half their time in classes and the other half in bed with each other. A happy concoction of kisses and laughing and touching. Eventually every night rolled into one is Castiel's memory.
Cas walked around the front of the car, taking it all in as he slid in shotgun. He ran his hands over the black leather seats and the dark creamy dashboard:  vintage but still in an amazing condition. Dean smiled as he watched Cas' explore his baby. “She's not mine, but my Dad is letting me borrow her while he's away.” Dean made himself comfortable and they set off.
He was wailing again. His body convulsing. Until that feeling churned inside him. He ran into the bathroom, just in time to vomit.
Cas felt lonely trying to sleep in the guest bedroom. He picked up his phone, typing a message to Dean.
But Dean was changing right beneath his fingertips and he didn’t want to admit how happy it made him.
The first seeds of doubt were planted in Cas' mind. Was Dean not out to his family? Although a million questions circled his mind, when his head hit the pillow he was gone.
‘The only reason I went to the hospital was to see if you were alive and ok. I don’t care about that Dean, you know I don’t.’ Cas kept his voice steady, knowing as soon as he raised it to shout he would unintentionally cry too.
He questioned for the fifth time why he’d come here or more likely how he got here. He had gone for a casual few drinks at The Roadhouse and stumbling along the strip back to his baby he had passed the club. In the back of his mind he knew the answer: he wanted to get laid.
“Hi,” the boy said, giving Cas a gentle smile that had laughter behind it. Cas really liked the way his lips curved.
Castiel had planned a quiet evening of more reading and a relaxing shower before bed. He wasn’t expecting guests. He quickly finished tidying the kitchen and flipped up his phone again.
He had spent the weekend hopelessly trying to gather sources for a paper he was writing and finally by Sunday evening he was making progress. This week he would finally clear his head, maybe get some of his energy out at the gym and get some good work done.
But when they were together, just the two of them alone it was as though everything else washed away. There were no labels or declarations just clean slates. And above all Dean had promised he wouldn't hurt Cas. Cas turned away from Dean's confused expression and the pair stood in silence until Castiel noticed something red poking out of Dean's bedside drawer.
But Castiel left the army suddenly when their tour was finally over and for his own peace of mind he couldn’t speak to them. Balthazar, Anna, Uriel, any of them.
Cas decided he didn't want to leave Meg alone so he took her back to her dorm. They actually lived in the same building; she was just two floors down. He sat in the corridor while she hurled in the bathroom and then tucked her up in bed with a glass of water.
‘In front of my family Cas!? What, you thought you could come and out me under the guise of caring about my safety?’
They ended up off road down some beaten track somewhere, making out in the back seat. Cas laid back while Dean got on top of him. Their bodies writhing against each other. His fingers clawed against the leather and he hoped no one could hear him moan as Dean went down on him.
Cas was crying now, tears that slowly leaked from the side of his eyes. He was sure he could see Dean welling up too.
Castiel spent the next day in bed, barely able to bring himself to go to the bathroom. He just wanted to sleep and forget about how he’d let Dean wash over him then wring him out.
“Okay,” Cas nodded, making Dean smile. Cas wished he'd said no, but it made Dean so happy. Dean pulled Cas into a hug, wrapping his huge arms around him. Eventually Cas pulled away. For some reason he wasn't in the best of moods. He knew it was probably due to him being jealous of that beautiful Joe girl, and Cas felt so tense about meeting more of Deans family. Would Joe be there too? And then of course there was the F word that made Cas feel sick to his stomach with the idea that Dean didn't feel the same way as he did. But how could he not? With everything he's said and done. Cas didn't like being so unsure all the time.
‘Cas don’t do this.’ Dean stepped forward again and sunk down on his knees, looking up at Castiel, his bright green eyes so beautiful Cas began to cry.
He didn’t understand why he cared. Cas wasn’t his boyfriend. They didn’t do feelings, something Dean made very clear from the offset.
“I know there are things I haven't said to you Dean. But that’s only because I'm afraid you won’t feel the same.”
But Cas hadn’t called or text. Dean remembered the moment in blurs. Shit. He had actually tried to fuck Cas? Actual full on anal. Not that he was afraid of it or hadn’t thought about it but
“Son of a bitch!” Dean yelled as he slammed down the brakes. He hadn't noticed that the lights ahead of him were now red and the pair of them lurched forward and then harshly fell back into their seats.
Jo handed him a hip flask and they grinned like they were fourteen again. She reached out to squeeze his hand. A platonic gesture, their romantic relationship long over and he thought about how he could just lean in and kiss her. How easy it would be, how little people would care.
‘But still, I’m part of the group I suppose and I really just came to see these people.’ Castiel gestured at the people chatting around the table.
Dean's mouth was so hot and wet and his lips moved gently from tip to base. Maybe Cas was wrong. Maybe Dean had done this before. Either way it was hard to think about anything else besides the way Dean's thumb pressed in to his hip, his free hand against Cas’s dick, holding it forward.
Thanksgiving came and the pair didn't have to tell each other what they were thankful for, they already knew. They set off Wednesday afternoon to make the drive for Lawrence. Dean's home was big, with a large open plan kitchen and dining area, and big archways that led to a sitting room. Dean's family we're the sweetest people. They were all there – except John, but Mary made sure they said a prayer for him at the table. Sam was so witty, as funny as his brother. So smart – like Dean had said. Cas talked to Sam at length about high school and college and his aspirations for Stanford. There was no doubt that he wouldn't be making his way to sunny California in a few years’ time. Cas caught up with Emily and thanked her for their stay at her place, he was sure they talked about more but he couldn't remember.
‘What? No!’ Dean shook his head. ‘Shit.’ He moved more into the office but still kept Castiel’s desk between them.
‘Bye!’ Sam called politely, as he opened the door for Castiel, also making his way out of the building with another student from their class.
He tried to focus on what actually mattered. His win at his last race and the teams qualifying to enter the cup. He checked his phone and had multiple missed calls from Sam.
‘Do you want to stop?’ He asked, sensing Dean's confusion, their eyes meeting again like they had at the bar.
When Dean came he couldn’t bring himself to move. Instead he let the tight nerves that had formed in his muscles since he saw Castiel yesterday, dissipate until he fell asleep.
He hadn’t wanted to ask the question, he probably should have never even invited Dean but what was he supposed to say?
That green, those lashes, his teeth biting down hard on his bottom lip and Cas was gone too. His hand still tugging until Castiel’s back arched up from the seat and he moaned into a kiss, their lips pressing together fast.
Cas wasn't sober and he could tell by how badly he kept Dean upright and the fits of laugher Dean would send him into every time the pair almost toppled over. But he tried to breathe in as much of the fresh air as he could.
He knew he should just forget about what had happened the night before, but that didn’t stop the thought of those green eyes clouding his mind.
They stayed like that, just watching one other. Dean finished another shot, his gaze barely faltering and the stranger took another sip, his eyes not leaving Dean.
One night Cas woke to a cold empty bed. “Dean?” he called out, but no reply. He could hear movement in the kitchen. He hugged his sweatshirt closer to him. He was only in that and his underwear.
When Meg and Castiel first met it had been at a fresher’s party. He looked so much better then than he did now. Finally away at university, practically an adult he was full of life and his possibilities were endless. Meg wouldn’t be the only one who couldn't resist his wide eyed gaze. It was early in the evening and Cas who usually wasn't one for parties decided that college was an “experience”, that whether he liked some things or didn't, he should at least try them.
Crowley’s eyes widened, not liking the emphasis she had put on ‘you.’ He turned to look at her, just in time as she swung a decorative, but very real, axe towards his head. He ducked just in the nick of time, and took off down the hall.
“Dad!?” she cried out in shock and horror as the ghostly trio floated over to him to help him regain his balance, “No! What have you done to him?!”
“Amuck,” Meg laughed, “Amuck, amuck, amuck—” she was cut off by Abaddon punching her in the gut. They had to think.
“Don’t be goofin’ on Cas. He’s as nice a person as they come. He’s always treated you right, huh, Gabriel?” Dean looked up from where he was unpacking what was left from his pictures. Did these ghosts…know Cas? Was Cas really a ghost? Would they tell him anything?
“Grab the book!” Gabriel ordered, jumping off it. Dean grabbed the book and they ran, dodging Abaddon and Ruby as they tore through the cemetery.
After spotting a small box on the dresser, he opened it up, and smiled at the tune that emerged from what was apparently a music box. Two carved figures were dancing in the box. Two men, one blonde, one with black hair, wearing fancy suits. His smile widened when he noticed how much they looked like his dad and papa. They hadn’t danced in a while.
“Oh. Well, I think I could come up with something pretty good. Why don’t we just roll you up in aluminum foil, and you could go as a leftover?” Dean laughed, but Claire just looked at him with a blank stare before shaking her head. Dean sighed, and smiled at her, “Don’t worry. You always look cute.”
Jack wasn’t paying attention as he pulled the door closed with a final look to his friend, “I’m gonna be alive.”
“Oh! Thou hast waited in vain! And thou whilst fail to save thy friends, just as thou failed to save thy sister!” she taunted, before flying down to them.
Claire’s eyes widened; she hadn’t expected this turn of events. Before she could say anything, Henry jumped to his feet once again, “Wait a minute, wait a minute! I thought we were having the party at my place,” when nobody said anything, he continued, “Oh, okay, we’ll take a vote. Whoever wants the party at my house, raise your hand,” he put his hand in the air, and glared at his classmates when not one of them followed him.
And he did. All of the spirits who had been buried in the private cemetery were roaming the grounds. It didn’t look like they were in pain, or miserable, it was more like they were at a park enjoying a picnic. Some were reenacting their deaths, and some were simply talking, or taking a stroll. Dean looked out the window and shouted up to Sam, “Why are all these ghosts still hanging around here?”
The crowd dispersed as the witches took their final breaths. Charles Novak was the last to leave. As he was walking away, a black cat came up to him and brushed up against his legs, meowing piteously.
Dean rubbed his temples and leaned into baby. ‘Try again.’ What could he do that he hadn’t already….
They were walking down the elegant staircase, and Dean couldn’t help but ask, “Hey, Roman, I was wondering, have you ever been to a tanning salon? I sold the house of the owner of a really good salon, and they could get you a nice, even tan,” he knew it was rude, but the man was so pale he looked dead!
“See, I’m a good dancer,” from insider the music box where she kept her scrunchie, “Woah!” he squealed as the small form inside span around unexpectedly. She shook her head, shutting the box and walking over to her dresser, “Don’t need a costume!” she shut the drawer in his face, and went to the closet, getting more and more annoyed. Jack had been at this for hours, ever since Alex had left. As she pulled open the door, she jumped back, obviously startled as a bunch of balloons burst out, “I’m always the life of the party,” he said, very seriously.
Dean flinched when something caught his eye. Partially fallen through the ceiling was a dusty, old skeleton, “Don’t look up, Sammy,” he warned.
A cat as black as night stared up at them with whiskey eyes. He snarled up at them, nearly biting off Meg’s fingers when she went to pet him. The witches cackled as she jumped back with a scream. Their jubilation was cut short, however, by a banging on their door.
“What about the three soccer games, two birthday parties, and barbeque you missed?” Dean’s eyes widened.
“I don’t like this,” she said with a glare before walking away from him. Henry had been her friend for years, but he was just becoming terrible the older they got. She actually liked Claire, what little she knew about her so far, and really did want to get to know her. But Henry was making her ask to hang out, only to not show up and hurt her feelings at the dance. She didn’t know why he hated her so much, but he did, and she was still loyal to her friend, however jerky he was acting. As much as Alex wanted to get to know Claire, Henry was her oldest friend.
“Doomed to wander the earth for all eternity,” Gabriel added, a bit more dramatic, but with the same effect. Dean and the children were sad for the lost souls, but there was nothing they could do but watch as the carriage drove through the cemetery.
Jack wouldn’t hear of it, “This is the way it’s gotta be,” he said, refusing to look at her. Without hesitating, the littlest ghost went over, and pulled the lever. The whistles started to blow as the machine sprang to life, causing the lights all over the mansion to flicker. Claire stood next to Jack, anxious and desperate. Hoping against all hope that her father would come out alive.
“No!” Abaddon yelled, giving her sister a look filled with judgement. She looked over to the book, “Book? Come to mummy, darling.”
He walked right by all the girls who were giving him inviting smiles, and held his hand out to the lone wallflower, not taking his eyes off hers. She didn’t hesitate to take his hand.
Cas reluctantly pulled away as the clock struck ten. He could only stay for as long as his miracle was in effect.
“Leave me alone! Get away from me!” he finally reached his room, and slammed the door shut, effectively blocking out the pursuing spirit.
Jack could tell she was a bit more relaxed than she was before, and was very proud of himself, “That one’s easy,” he said, doing just that as he floated the glass of orange juice over to her. Despite not being quite as afraid, he could tell she was apprehensive over grabbing the glass, “It’s fresh,” he assured her as he moved his hands out of the way, so she wouldn’t have to touch him. She slowly went to grab the glass, and Jack noticed how her hand had moved towards his, as if she was curious about what he felt like, “Go ahead,” he offered.
“Cool,” Crowley said, “Let me try them on.” Dean just rolled his green eyes and kicked off his shoes. They finally let go of him and he rode on, his sock clad feet peddling faster than they had been. That’s the last time he’ll let someone stop him in a cemetery.
“Anybody hungry for a little shish ka-doc?” Lucifer asked with a grin as he swung his newly acquired cane.
They were so caught up in their breakfast, that they didn’t notice the trio of ghosts sitting in the three set places opposite them. At least, not until a burnt piece of toast hit Dean right smack in the middle of his forehead. The father-daughter duo stared at the ghostly trio across the table.
“Don’t mind if I do,” Dean said, looking around the impressive library as Roman poured high quality whiskey into a gorgeous crystal glass, “Thank you very much, Roman,” he said, taking the glass, and drinking the whiskey. He didn’t drink all that much nowadays, but this was probably some of the best he’d ever had. He gave an appreciative hum, as he continued to drink, savoring the taste, “So Roman, how long have you been a butler?”
Jesse got ready to take the picture before he realized, “I’ve gotta be in the picture too, or else no one is gonna believe I was here.”
Their laughter turned to screams as the light touched their skin. The witches fell to the floor in agony.
His shortest uncle scoffed, “Oh yeah? Well company loves misery,” he said, knocking the pitcher of freshly squeezed orange juice onto the floor, creating even more of a mess for the tiny ghost.
About an hour later, Claire was curled up on her bed, exhausted from the emotional conversation. Jack floated next to her. He knew she was nearly asleep, so was very surprised when she suddenly said, “Sometimes I worry that I’m starting to forget.”
Dean shared a look with Cas, something about this guy didn’t seem right, but what could they do. Dean went into real estate agent mode, “Hello, Roman. I’m Dean Winchester from Winchester’s realties. At your service,” he offered his hand, but Roman just looked at it as if he had been offered to hold a snake and didn’t take his gaze away from Castiel.
“Over here!” Jack beckoned, motioning to a dusty red velvet chair, “Go on, sit down,” she did as he asked, honestly just glad to be able to sit after all that running, “I would hold on.”
“No!” Dean protested, stopping him in his tracks, “He’s a good zombie.” Cas threw his stick down, a little dejected while Sam walked up to Cain.
Cas smiled softly. Listening to this story had helped him realize that all of his problems with Dean were fixable. Hearing Mr. Morgenstern’s thoughts about love resonated in his heart. He loved his husband, even when he could be an idiot, “Yes, I do.”
Dean rushed over to his husband’s side, and cradled his body to him, “Cas! What’s the matter? What’s wrong?”
“Where I can watch over both of you until we’re together again, which better not be for a very long time. Goodbye Dean,” he whispered, and Dean watched, not looking away for one second as the blinding white light came once again, taking his husband with it as it faded away.
“What are you talking about!? We’re going to heaven! You can’t take it with you,” Sam said, reasonably.
The tassel was obviously the switch, and Claire held tightly to the chair as it quickly started to move backwards. It stopped at the top of the spiral staircase, and turned around as the stairs collapsed in on themselves, until they became a slide, “Jack!” she screamed in terror as the chair flew down the stairs and the floor opened up beneath them, sending her into an underground tunnel.
Crowley laughed at her, “Oh, you can haunt me all you want, but it’s gonna be in a great big, expensive house! With lovely purple wallpaper, and great big green carpets! And a little dog…named Abaddon. A bitch! Just like you! I’ve got the power! I’ve got the treasure!” Crowley officially had it all. Everything he wanted. There was nothing left for him.
Dean glared, but simply said, “No,” he went to ride on, but Crowley grabbed onto his backpack, stopping him.
“But who lit the black flame candle?” Abaddon said, walking over to it. She didn’t dwell on it too long when she saw her old friend. She gasped and walked over to the display that held her book, “Wake up,” she said, tapping the glass with a long fingernail, “Wake up sleepyhead, I missed you. Did you miss me, too?” she asked with a pout, “Come on, now. We’ve got work to do.”
“Great,” Mr. Lafitte obviously didn’t care and wanted to get the rest of the announcements over with, so he could get on with the class, “That’s done. Secondly, we have a new student today. I’d like you all to meet,” he looked at the paper with her name, reading it for the first time since the secretary had given it to him, “Winchester Claire,” he didn’t realize he had mixed up the names until the class started to laugh. He looked towards the back of the room where a young blond girl sat, head in her hands at the embarrassing first impression, “Would you like to come up here and say ‘hi’ to everyone for me?”
“Wow,” Cas said, before looking back at the gate, that was chained shut with a rusted padlock, “How are we gonna get in?”
It was a rite of passage for every teenager in the town to try to sneak in and get photographic evidence. No one had ever done it successfully, however, so if Ben and Jesse managed it, they would be legends.
This sounded too easy, “You’re telling me all I need to do is find this key, and I can walk out of here with my husband and kids like nothing ever happened?”
His watch beeped nine, and like clockwork, Dean yawned. With a heavy sigh, he drained the last inch of amber liquid and got up to take a shower and drag his ass into bed, thinking bitterly that yet
Cas offered him a small smile. It was nice being able to talk to a fellow Winchester fan. Anna only ever read romances and wasn’t interested in ghosts or killers like Cas was, and despite how great the books were, he knew she wouldn’t enjoy them. There was a forum he participated in, but it wasn’t the same as... Wait. He had said editor. Not a beta, an editor. Maybe Cas misheard. “Your what?”
He turned back to the window, eying his reflection in the glass. “I’ve spent much of the week getting my affairs in order. I didn’t have time to preen.”
“Cas, he flirts with you all the time, remember? That automatically makes him at least a little gay.”
The hand slowly returned, petting softly through the feathers and sending a pleasant warmth into Cas’s belly. Dean kept his hand on his wing throughout the rest of dinner, and only removed it when the apple turnovers were placed in front of him.
Sure, it could be the double date that was just sprung on him, but he’s seen character actors deal with worse in the park all while maintaining their 100-watt smile. Hell, he’s had to clean vomit off of gowns multiple times and knew for a fact that those princesses kept their composure. This
He’d been thinking about the contents of the manifesto for days, wondering over its contests and hoping that it highlighted the man’s plan. Words filled his screen and he started reading.
No matter how decorated his military career was, how many legions of demons he and his garrison had defeated and villages he’s saved from certain death, one comment from his father was enough to remind him that no one with his looks could ever be expected to marry well.
“Good. Now you know Claire is a willing student, and once Jack turns five or six, you can teach him too.”
The carriage rolled over a large rock, jostling its occupants. He let out an annoyed sigh at being forced to take the carriage when the fastest way to travel was by wing. “Why couldn’t we fly to Winchester? This trip will take all day.”
Samuel blushed, realizing he had done nothing but stare. “I’m trying not to be rude… But you don’t really look like an angel. Well, you have wings, obviously, but…”
“But I’m one of three men in the costume department so I’ve never seen him flirt with any other guy. I thought that he was just…”
To his knowledge, his father was under the impression that Castiel was returning with him, broken and ashamed. It probably wasn’t even a thought in his large head that Prince Dean went through with the marriage, let alone be so excited about it that they’ve been sequestered in his room, fucking like rabbits for days. Balthazar would have stayed longer in the Kingdom of Winchester, if not for the noise of their lovemaking echoing throughout the entire left wing.
Immediately, Cas didn’t trust him. There had been many times at the beginning of their friendship where he was lulled into a false sense of security only to be dragged to a strip club, wine tasting, or other—equally bothersome—tasks. The fact that Balthazar was giving him that same feeling on the morning of such an important day was even more worrying. “Goodmorning.”
Mile by mile, his dread grew. Shouldn’t he have seen a familiar billboard yet? Maybe the Target sign they passed a few times a week? Five minutes passed, then ten. He continued scanning his surroundings from the right lane, glad that he was behind a slow-moving eighteen-wheeler when out of the corner of his eye, he saw a dark smudge. He looked over at a large smoky scrape along the cinderblock wall bordering the highway. Dean slowed down, staring harder, heart in his throat. His soulmate had spent a handful of seconds staring at that a few weeks ago, feeling a pang of sympathy for the poor soul whose car made the marks.
“You know… Bruce Wayne?” At Cas’s continued stare, he paused, his smile dropping a little. “Batman. You’ve seen The Dark Knight, right?”
Dean couldn’t stop himself from leaning in and capturing Cas’s lips with his own. They were in a hospital, so he couldn’t kiss his husband like he wanted, but Cas’s kisses never failed to make him feel warm and fuzzy. He doubted they ever would.
They originally wanted to keep the plans from Claire for as long as possible, but once the crib was set up in her room, it was impossible to keep the secret. They planned to tell her after a dinner of her favorite homemade macaroni and cheese, but she beat them to it. She took one look at the crib, turned to her dad's, and raised an eyebrow. “Are we getting a baby? Because I always wanted a baby…”
He watched her leave, flipping the front lights off on her way out. Dean was already back in his seat, highlighting paragraphs. “So I know which ones are shit,” he explained.
It had never been like this with Michael. When they were first married, Cas had been ecstatic over the chance to create their own holiday traditions, and the holiday he had been most excited for was Christmas. It had always been his favorite time of the year, and the only time he was able to see his cousins and other extended family.
Cas went back to his fish, giving Dean all the time he needed to take the statement in. With the forkful of fish halfway to his mouth, he felt a tentative touch on his wing. The appendage twitched at the sensation and Dean drew back as if shocked.
Dean could do nothing but laugh as they left the arena and headed in the direction of the castle. “Well, that was fun.” Cas glared at him, and he was really growing to like that stormy look on his husband’s face. “Oh, come on. They liked you! In fact, I think they like you more than me. Last month Cain actually took my sword away.”
Oh, how Balthazar wished for a glass of wine to enjoy the show. Life couldn’t possibly get better than this.
“It’s going well, I guess. The doc says I’ve been gaining the right amount of weight, and all of the ultrasounds and blood tests came back good. I don’t have a family history of many conditions, if that’s something you're worried about. Just high blood pressure. Oh, and my grandmother had breast cancer, but I guess a boy wouldn’t really need to worry much about that.”
“Fuck, yes! Keep doing that!” Dean bucked up again when Cas sucked long and hard on his skin, not caring that he was leaving behind dark marks in areas he wouldn’t be able to conceal. He trailed up higher, tonguing at Dean’s pulse point and slowly making his way to his ear, loving the salty taste of Dean’s sweat and the sound of his panting breaths intermingled with sweet gasps.
Dean threw his head back and laughed, and Cas watched in satisfaction until Dean was able to calm down enough to give him a bright smile and pull out of the driveway. Cas watched him drive off with butterflies in his stomach.
He never expected to see the man again, but the next day he showed up at the same time, notebook and flash drive in hand, and got busy typing away on their computers. When the man finally left a few hours later, Cas rushed to the computer. This time, he had closed the browser, but that didn’t deter Castiel at all. A few clicks were all it took to pull up his recently closed tabs.
Cold water dripped onto his chest and he knew it was from his brother crouching over him. He couldn’t even complain because no annoyance could be as bad as the pain he was experiencing. “What happened?”
He closed the browser and shut down the computer, hoping that the mystery man had enough sense to go with another option. Personally, Cas would look at what the cartels were doing and copy that, but he would never harm another person so it didn’t matter. At the very least, the man could take advantage of the vast forests that surrounded them and bury the body deep somewhere far off a trail.
“Aww!” Charlie gushed from the other side of the table, earning herself a light smack to the shoulder from her girlfriend.
As if he could read Dean’s mind, Cas reached into the small space between his hips and the desk and gripped his cock. Dean let out a noise loud enough to rival a porn star and rocked back against Cas’s thrusts in an attempt to urge him faster, harder, but Cas’s pace remained unchanged, and continued to time his thrusts with his strokes. In, up. Out, down. He was spiraling closer and closer to the edge, his hole clenching around Cas’s cock so hard that there was no way Cas wasn’t just as close as he was.
He laughed loudly at the absurdity of the situation, gaining Dean’s attention. His smile stayed in place throughout dinner and dessert, past settling the bill and walking to the parking lot, and beyond Dean shyly asking Cas out—this time, just the two of them.
Dean’s eyes followed the movement of Cas’s hand, eyes landing on the stack of menus. He picked up the first menu and handed the other to Charlie once she settled into her seat. “Thanks.”
if he didn’t get home ASAP that Cas would work himself into a damn fit—if he hadn’t already. It took a solid five minutes to convince his boss that he needed to leave early, and the only reason he agreed was that Dean had finished his last job already and if he stayed, the boss would be paying him to sweep the shop for the next forty-five minutes.
Dean pulled away, letting his head fall back against the spines of the thick books. “God, I wish we had a bed.”
The shy smile that graced Cas’s features was one Dean wanted to see every day. “I’d like to hug you if that’s alright.”
Dean added a spoonful of the butter and brown sugar mixture into the bottom of their glasses then poured some hot water from the electric kettle. Finishing it off with a few ounces of rum and a bit of vanilla, they were ready to go. “Yeah, and it’s amazing. This isn’t like the time Sam convinced you to try your coffee with butter in it. Who the fuck does that? Psychos, that’s who.”
Cas got into the car, watching his friend through his side mirror as he got into the back, settling nicely behind the passenger seat. “I’ve been coming here since I was four. I’ve always called her ma’am.”
She just cocked an eyebrow. “I wasn’t born yesterday, honey. A new sweetheart is the only thing that would keep you from visiting your Auntie Missouri.”
“Yes,” he growled into the pillow, his arm worming its way from under his body and into the open, making a grabby gesture.
He felt the strange urge to apologize, but before he could even open his mouth, Dean was already muttering to himself about needing to speak with his father. Dean left, practically pushing his way through the crowd in search of King John, leaving Cas standing there awkwardly.
“You know…” He rubbed a hand over his mouth, clearly embarrassed. “Angels all kinda look… And you don’t really… fit. I’m fucking this up, aren’t I?”
Dean would do anything to make Cas happy, even if it meant Cas being back on the battlefield. Against all odds, their arranged marriage was going great so far, and it seemed like Cas was really beginning to like him. If that was the case, the feeling was mutual.
He cupped Cas’s bulge, already starting to thicken, and savored the breathy sigh that escaped Cas’s lips. Dean applied just a little pressure as he rubbed the outline of his cock through the thin cotton fabric, so soft from years of wash that he could feel all the ridges and veins under his palm. His mouth was watering at the thought of tasting Cas’s thick length, so he reached for the elastic, pulling it up and over his cock, all the way down to tuck under his balls. Cas squirmed at the pressure and Dean pulled it just a little tighter, savoring the little moan and pulse of arousal that had Cas’s dick standing hard and proud. He left his boxers there, enjoying the sight it made, and traced a finger lightly over the elastic.
It was well before dawn when Chuck and Becky were startled from their sleep by a loud thump and frightened cry. They knew right away that it was their middle son, Castiel. While he had always gone down easy enough, he moved around a lot in his sleep and was prone to falling out of his bead. Often, all he needed was a quick cuddle and he was right as rain. The couple glanced at each other, having an entire conversation with their eyes that ended with Chuck sighing and throwing the blankets off of himself.
As he stepped aside and allowed Prince Samuel into his room, he ran a hand through his unkempt hair, frustrated with himself that he hadn’t taken the time to wash the stink of the road from himself yet. Thankfully, he hadn’t even begun to unpack and the room was still as tidy as it was when he entered a few hours earlier.
would have to uproot their lives so they could be together. But watching his soulmate walk away and disappear into the building ten minutes later, Dean couldn’t help but think that he’d do anything to make that happen. Maybe uprooting his life was exactly what he needed. Perhaps Cas was his ticket out of his boring life and the job he’s been stuck in since he was a teenager. A slow smile curved his lips as he imagined what a fresh start could look like.
Dean rose again and paused before dropping; the constriction around his cock nearly did him in. “I’d tell you if I couldn’t handle it.”
And just like that, he was gone, a smiling teentaking his place. Kenin's nametag said Anna, and Cas was left even more confused.
He shrugged, trying to appear casual, but no one had called him Cas since his college days, and he was giddy at the idea of Dean using such a familiar nickname. “That’s fine.”
Cas’s heart dropped. Sure, he had considered that would be the answer, but it didn’t make him any less disappointed. “Alright. I won’t ask him out.”
, Sam!” He rolled over to his side and panted into the sand, trying not to throw up. Never before had he been in so much pain, and it showed no sign of stopping.
Balthazar glanced between his father and the commander, and suddenly things weren’t so funny anymore. A feeling of dread grew in his stomach. If Castiel was the chief strategist, then they were in a lot of trouble, and not only that, the Kingdom of Winchester just gained an important new member, one that could send the power balance between the two kingdoms reeling. He could see where the argument was going, and he didn’t want to be in the room when the figurative talons were unleashed. He edged around the room slowly, keeping his eyes on the stare down in front of him, and finally slipped from the room.
“He was a teacher too. Taught high school English, actually. His partner was an artist, though. He liked to do this abstract stuff that I never understood.”
Dean hooked his arms under Cas’s legs and hiked them up, using the bend of his knees to his advantage and pulling him into the thrusts. Cas’s hands scrabbled into the bedding, searching for purchase as Dean railed into him. His body offered no resistance, only a slick warm hole for Dean to find pleasure in. His orgasm was building, Cas could feel it, and judging by the way Dean was biting his lip and gasping with each wet thrust, Dean wasn’t far either.
Castiel smoothed a hand over his wavy locks, just barely beginning to grow since the last time he’d cropped it. “There’s nothing wrong with my hair.”
Balthazar watched as Cas moved to stand beside him. “It’s a wonderful morning for some coffee, isn’t it?”
“Just a couple things though. French fries are not a breakfast food. Pie is dessert, only. And please don’t ask her to wear a t-shirt— “
Ruby quickly threw a blanked over the body of the girl, “There be no witches here, sir!” she called threw the door, trying to sound helpless.
They made their way back to their abandoned bags as Claire grabbed a couple of hers, “I’m gonna go find my room.”
“Dad…Dad, don’t you remember?” Claire begged as she walked over to the ghostly form of her father. She held up a pinky.
Abaddon cackled even louder, as she headed over to the Lazarus, “So, sue me! Crowley, the capsule, now!”
“That’s all right. I forgive Bumble,” Cas emphasized the name before walking away. Dean groaned in frustration.
It was beautiful, of course, in that way old mansions always are. The foyer was a large, open space with large windows and an elegant staircase leading to the darkness of the upstairs. It was beautiful, but as Jesse and Ben looked around, they felt nothing but fear.
Dean and Claire had made their way to the cellar and found the fuse box. It was covered in spiderwebs, and Dean had made her stand a good few feet away, just in case it was exactly as safe as it looked. Fortunately, nothing happened, except for the lights, “That was easy.”
“Yes, I know my dear, I know. He’s expecting you. He’s always been expecting you,” Roman walked over to the bed where he had laid out Michaels wedding suit from the attic, “And look, you haven’t put on your suit yet. The master had it made especially for you. We can’t keep him waiting.”
Sure enough, in the treasure chest that both Abaddon and Crowley had died to obtain, was a simple baseball and catcher’s mitt. The most valuable treasure of them all for a young boy who loved to play. Jack reached for the ball, and started tossing it up and down in his intangible hand, “Are you kidding? It’s autographed by Duke Snyder, the Brooklyn Dodgers. My favorite player. What else would I put in a treasure chest, but my most treasured possession?” he tossed the ball up and down, catching it every time before Claire grabbed it in mid-air.
Dean sputtered for a moment, “Well, that’s not really the focus of our sessions here, is it?” the ghosts nodded in agreement, but Dean continued, “But as long as you raised the issue…you wouldn’t have any way…of…contacting others like yourselves…would you?”
Dean gave a frustrated groan. She just had to mention the zombies. He turned back to the door, “Jack please! We’re running out of time, just open the door right now!”
Dean scoffed, “Don’t think that just because you pulled out a sword, I’m gonna let you marry my husband.”
Cas’s blue eyes didn’t leave Dean’s green. The angel knew this time together was limited, and he wanted to commit as much of it to memory as he could, “Let’s just say you know three crazy ghosts who kept their word.”
Dean Winchester had given up a stable career in pursuit of this. He had dragged his daughter all over the country, declaring left, right, and center that ghosts were real and that he could help them. Yet, despite all of this, he had never actually seen a ghost.
Claire didn’t pull away until the warm lips went cold. She pulled back and was unsurprised to see Jack back to his normal ghostly state. What did surprise her, however, was seeing the crowd of classmates that had surrounded the two of them as they floated.
“Sisters, look,” Ruby said, looking down at the candy bar, “Tis the chocolate covered finger of a man named Clark,” she took a bite, “Eugh! It’s candy! Why would the master give us candy?”
The living man in question didn’t really care. He was too busy setting his other things up to really care. He only had the diploma framed because Cas had been so proud, and wanted to keep the certificate on display. Dean couldn’t blame him. He knew he wouldn’t have made it through university if Cas hadn’t been there. His Angel was the only one who believed he was smarter than he was. So no, the diploma didn’t matter to him. He had his certificate, but had lost his credibility, so what did it matter?
“His name is Castiel, he’s from Illinois. Roman wants you to think he’s Michael so this curse will be lifted,” Dean was getting really tired of this. He was more than ready to go.
She squinted her eyes and leaned in close to the carving to make it out, “’Beware all who enter, for here lies the passage to the dead,’” she looked at her dad with fear-filled eyes.
Jack looked up at her, and his eyes widened in shock when he saw what she was holding, “Careful!” he shouted, floating over to her, and taking the beaker from her hands, “That’s what makes the whole thing work! Kind of an instant primordial soup mix,” Claire just raised a brow, clearly not getting it, “It’s what brings ghosts back to life,” he clarified, “There’s just enough for one,” he looked to the machine. On one side, there was an open compartment, just big enough for the bottle in Jack’s hands. He locked it in place, and the liquid began to glow as he turned the compartment so that the beaker was upside down, “Pull the lever.”
Dean glared at Pamela as he showed her the key, “All right, we went to Hell and back to get this thing, so where’s the door out of here?”
Abaddon gave a happy sigh when the pages stopped, “There it is,” she said happily, looking down at the text and reading aloud, “Bring to a full boiling bubble, three drops oil of boil.”
“So, why don’t you tell us something special about yourself, Claire?” Mr. Lafitte asked after a few seconds of her not saying anything.
The three human boys climbed out of the manhole and looked down at the remains of Gabe. A bus had come speeding down the street, and the cat hadn’t had enough time to get out of the way. He was completely flattened down the middle. Sam couldn’t help but cry at the sight. Cas held him close to his chest and kept him from looking at the remains.
Their hands met, hers pink and warm, his clear, small and translucent. His hand went through her skin, and she shivered at the cold sensation. Neither one had felt this before. Claire had obviously never touched a ghost, and Jack had never been welcome to touch a living person. He couldn’t feel much of anything, physically, but he still had emotions. And the simple gift of gentle physical touch that he had been denied for so long. If he still could, Jack knew that he would be crying.
Claire snickered, and went ahead. They were too slow for her tastes, “Dad!” she shouted back as she caught sight of the mausoleum, “There it is!” Jack and Dean ran up to join her and stared up at the intimidating structure.
“Not in practice, but I’ve studied it and spoken to people who have done it. I’ve seen videos and I feel very confident in my knowledge. It’s no problem.”
“Abaddon Demoniac,” Charles Novak began, one arm around his wife, Rebecca, the other around his youngest son, and the only child he had left, Samandriel.
“It’s my curse. That and you two! The candle’s almost out! And look at my potion, there’s just enough left, for one child,” and she knew just who that child would be.
“No way!” Sam argued, “It’s my first time here, I’ll get lost! Besides, there’s a full moon out tonight, the weirdos are out!” when Dean continued to ignore him, he tried a different approach. He walked over to his brother and put his head on Dean’s shoulder, turning on the puppy eyes, “Come on, Dean. Can’t you take a break from being a cool teenager for one night? Please? Come on, we used to have so much fun together trick or treating. Remember? It’ll be like old times!”
‘This would be so much easier if I had a car,’ he thought to himself. He was sixteen, and had his license, but he didn’t get a car until he was in college. He went back to the task at hand when he saw a figure in a long trench coat, “Cas!” he called, pulling to a stop beside the other boy, “Hey look, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to embarrass you in class,” he said, apologetically.
Jack’s eyes widened at the sight of his uncles sitting across from the living people. He rushed to put the plate on the table next to Dean, before turning to his uncles. Lucifer grabbed the little ghost by the shoulders, “How dare you serve these air-sucking intruders before us!”
Before he could fix it, a bookshelf on the nearby wall slid aside to reveal a hidden staircase. Dean’s eyes widened in excitement. A secret passageway! He looked around to see if Roman, or Mr. Morgenstern were coming in, and when he saw the coast was clear, he couldn’t stop himself from heading to the passage. He wasn’t going to see where it led, he just wanted to peek inside real quick. How many times would he be able to see an actual secret passageway?
He had had enough, “Okay, that’s it,” he said, picking up the gypsy ball, “That’s the last stray, I’ve had enough of this nonsense.”
Sam rolled his eyes, “Besides him,” he clarified, yelping a bit when Gabriel slapped his translucent arm.
“It doesn’t matter how young or old you are!” he screamed at her, “You sold your soul! You’re the ugliest thing that’s ever lived! And you know it!” Abaddon snarled at him.
The rest of Jack’s body burst through the door, and he frantically shook his head, eyes wide and pleading. He didn’t want to lose his only friend, and the only person who wasn’t scared of him.
Crowley carefully snuck out of the house, frantically looking around for the woman he had hopefully just killed who had been trying to kill him…honestly it was no wonder his mother didn’t think the two of them made for a healthy couple…
“Bad,” Gabriel confirmed before Castiel caught his eye. He had been holding the spell book and was opening the front cover, “Stay out of there!” he demanded. Cas jumped and closed the book.
Abaddon set her focus on Sammy. She sent a bolt of electricity towards the eight-year-old, but, fortunately, a tree branch blocked her path. Cain glared at her as Sam screamed, “Go to Hell!” he shouted at her.
“Enter the tomb under the great dead oak, and travel down deep under the ground. And there you will find the key that must be found. Find the black crypt that bears no name, or soon your fate will be the same.”
Jack floated in his room, slapping his forehead over and over again while repeating, “Blew it, blew it, blew it.”
“Do you see what you did?!” the angry wife asked, furious. She turned back to Dean, “We love the house!” he turned back to her, “We do. We love it.”
Claire couldn’t take it anymore, and jumped to her feet, “You guys are disgusting, obnoxious creeps!”
The spirits were listening, Dean figured as both the table and chair he was sitting in began to lift off the ground, “Hey, hey!” Dean shouted. He was terrified of flying, and this really wasn’t helping, “Hey, I’d really like to stay on the ground, all right?!” as the table began to spin, he began to scream, “Can I stay on the ground, please?!”
“And you have a flight to catch,” Abaddon said, reveling in the way Crowley’s eyes widened as she picked him up, plucked the vial from his hands, and sent him flying through one of the high windows of the laboratory, sending him straight to his death. She looked to the other two, “Any other takers?”
My dear, sweet Lucifer, you see only the good in the world around you. You give me the strength to give you the answer you asked for. Yes, my dear heart, I will marry you. I will love you for all eternity. And tonight, at last, we will be together. I do!
Castiel pulled the key he had taken from his mother’s office out of his coat and let them through the gate. They stepped up the creaking stairs and went inside the Demoniac house.
Before he could even begin to find a way back inside the house, all of the windows slammed shut, and he could hear the echoing locks from the door. His children were locked in a trunk, his husband was probably going to die, and he was stuck outside.
Jack looked down at her as the Lazarus began to rise from the pool of water, “Hey, you did it!” he proudly proclaimed as she smiled up at him. The machine Jack had been fighting with moved to join the Lazarus, obviously part of it.
They were so busy examining the machine, they didn’t notice Abaddon and Crowley sneaking over to the vault.
Castiel didn’t answer, choosing instead to get to the reason for his visit, “That was a very noble thing you did tonight, Jack. I know Claire will never forget it. She needs her father, very much. And I know yours will never forget it either,” Jack’s eyes widened at the mention of his father. Castiel knew him? “You managed to fulfill his greatest dream tonight. And I know he is very, very proud of you,” Jack’s eyes started to well up with tears that threatened to overflow. Jack didn’t cry often, and as a general rule, neither did most ghosts. But knowing that his father would be proud of him, and knowing he still cared enough to watch over him…it was special to Jack in a way he hadn’t thought he would need. Castiel continued speaking, “And for what you’ve done tonight, I’m giving you your dream in return,” Jack’s head shot up in shock, so fast that if he were still alive, he would’ve given himself whiplash. Castiel went on, “But it’s just for tonight. I’m not allowed to make long-term changes yet. Although your father did want me to tell you that the answers are all in the lab, and it is possible to make more. But you have to work very hard, and it can’t be used on any ghost other than the ones who live in this mansion, though I’m not sure if your uncles would want to take a chance. They seem very happy where they are, although they might change their minds eventually. But for tonight at least, it’s a bit of a Cinderella deal.”
Once he was released, Sam picked up his forgotten back of candy and ran up to Abaddon, “You leave my brother alone!” he shouted before swinging the bag and hitting her with the force of dozens of pieces of candy. She went down. Sam swung around and hit Meg across the back while Dean fell to the floor.
Sam growled and lunged at the Doctor, but his own impatience was his own undoing. Dean grabbed the end of the cane and sent the tall ghost flying away once more. As he disappeared, Gabriel was revealed, having hidden behind Sam, while licking at an oversized lollipop in an attempt to calm his anxiety. It didn’t work. He didn’t want to fight this bizarre fleshy anymore. The short ghost gave a nervous chuckle, and did the first thing that came to mind.
“Oh, Roman,” he could have cried in relief, “You have to help me! There’s something horribly wrong! Mr. Morgenstern, he—"
“Cause I’m your brother,” Sam finally looked up at him, and couldn’t contain his laughter at Dean’s exaggerated pout, “Let’s go, jerk.”
“Yes! You don’t have to be scared of death anymore! One minute you’ll be a ghost; next you’re back on your feet, free to come and go as you please! Hell, you could even fly through—”
Cas was nervous, and confused, but Dean just clapped his hands together, “All right, we’re in business. Let’s go!” they hopped back into the impala and drove up to the entrance.
Dean laughed, “You sound like your Papa. He would always use those weird statistics, and I was always too afraid to check if it was true or not.”
Alex nodded, and began fiddling with the ends of her long, dark hair, “Listen, if you don’t have any other plans, do you wanna hang out with me at the party? I think it would be fun, and I really wanna get to know you.”
Gabriel’s eyes widened as the book slowly floated over to Abaddon. She opened the book, “His punishment must be more fulsome…more lingering…Dazzle me my darling,” pages flipped, “Let’s see…amnesia, bunions, chilblains, cholera…We can do better than that,” she snickered, skipping ahead a few pages, smiling when something caught her eye, “Ahh…perfect. As usual,” she closed the book with a smile and Meg went to put it back, “His punishment shall not be to die…but to live forever with his guilt…”
He started banging on the walls of the greenhouse, the only place that hadn’t been shut off to him. He was screaming at the top of his lungs, begging for the house to open up and let him in, but it was to no avail. Eventually he gave up and found something large he could use to try to break the glass. Nothing was working! Wherever he hit would just repair itself, and he couldn’t break the glass faster than the repairs. He fought against the windows for a good ten minutes before he tossed the branch to the side and collapsed against the side of his car.
“Yes Abi, sorry,” the one in red, Ruby, walked over to the cauldron. She picked up a large wooden spoon and looked over to where the witch in purple was standing by a ladder, “I notice sister Meg isn’t helping.”
It worked. The top of the Lazarus blew steam like a kettle as the machine whirred to life, Claire guessed that was why it was kept under water. Not just to hide it, but because it was steam powered. She was so focused on keeping an eye on the dials, that she didn’t notice a hand in a shredded black suit jacket unlock the beaker of liquid from its compartment. Claire didn’t even notice something was wrong until the dials started to go haywire, and the steam slowly died down, “Jack!” she called out, worried. When she didn’t hear or see anything, she pulled the lever she had used to open the door in the first place. As she hesitantly peered around the corner, her eyes widened at the sight of her friend.
Dean forced himself out of her grip, and rolled away from her. Above them, Meg Demoniac held out her arms, and welcomed death. She exploded in a cloud of purple dust.
Dean heard muttering, “Thank God I heard your voice!” he exclaimed, walking through the door to find himself at the end of another hallway where a glowing green light came from the room at the end, “Hey, listen I need your help! I lost my way, and I don’t know how to get out of here! I’m sorry if I sound a little frazzled, but I just had myself a little freakshow back there! I was supposed to meet with Mr. Morgenstern, but…I got stuck in the wall!” the voice just continued speaking as if he weren’t there. When he entered the room, there was nobody there. Just a giant crystal ball where the green light was emanating from, “I hear you, but I don’t see you…where are you?”
Claire had stopped at the edge of a small pool of water, covered in a thin cloud of mist. She hadn’t put much thought into it other than ‘don’t fall in,’ “That’s useful,” she said.
“We’ll just stick to the bright side,” Dean muttered as thunder roared across the sky. They hadn’t noticed before, but there was definitely a storm on their way. Dean grabbed his husband’s hand and began to usher them all around to the front door.
She made her way into the school, and picked up her schedule and locker assignment from the office. She found her locker easy enough, but opening it was another matter entirely. She was positive she had entered the combination correctly, but no matter how hard she pushed, she couldn’t unlatch it. Just as she was about to give up, a fist came over her should and banged against the door, giving it the push it needed to get free.
“What, because of the rain?” Dean asked, “We’re just gonna get a little wet, come on, let’s just find your papa, and let’s go!”
“Claire, chill. Take a breath, or you’re gonna pass out,” Dean interrupted. He would be lying if he said he liked the idea, but he knew how hard it was for Claire to make friends, and she was right about this being a good opportunity for her. He would figure out a way to get the ghostly trio to leave her alone for the night, “Would we need to buy food, or decorations?”
Dean wasn’t sure what he had been expecting, but a large, sticky, hard projectile to suddenly slam into his forehead was not it. The shock caused him to drop his plunger and fall to the ground at the top of the stairs.
Sam ignored him and leaned down to get on his level, “You wouldn’t be trying to keep us out of the house now, would you?”
“Good morning!” he said, cheerfully, trying to appear as nonthreatening as possible. When he saw her eyes widen and knew she was about to scream, he quickly wrapped himself around her face, cutting her off, “Oh, no, no! Please don’t scream, I promise I won’t hurt you. I’m a ghost, yes. I admit it, but I’m a friendly ghost! You have to trust me. If you scream, you’ll wake up my uncles, and they get awfully cranky,” Jack waited until her eyes got a little less wide, “I’m gonna let you go now, okay?” as soon as she nodded, he unwrapped himself, and floated a few feet away, trying to appear as harmless as possible.
A tear began to roll down his cheek, but he angrily batted it away. People who put their families in danger didn’t deserve to cry. This was all his fault. His children were probably hurt, and definitely scared, and his angel was about to die. He reached into his pocket and pulled out the watch he had given to Castiel on their anniversary. He had actually put a lot of thought into picking it out and had been excited to see it on him. Now, he would never see it again. He didn’t want the last conversation he had with the man he loved to be a stupid fight.
“Sorry,” Abaddon said, pushing Claire aside and walking over to Dean as Claire rubbed at her aching cheeks, “Now, Dr. Winchester, exactly what kind of time frame are you looking at? Please tell me you just go into the house and spray, and that’s it.”
Ruby tossed off her cloak. Her hair was now a rich chocolate brown that hung in soft curls down her back. Her skin was smooth and tan, and her mouth was soft. She smirked, “We’re young!” she cheered, looking down at her body, that was clad in a comfortable looking red dress.
“Daylight savings time,” Ruby mocked, while her sisters laughed. Their laughter was cut short by a bright light shining through the window. Sunrise.
“I’m afraid we have plans,” Cas said, polite, but firm. He looked at Dean, “Honey, we can’t stay for dinner.”
While walking him out, Dean went to his parent’s bedroom, “Mom? Dad?” they weren’t there, “They must be having a great time.” Cas shook his head. No party in Salem lasted until five a.m.
“Tears of joy,” he promised. Lucifer nodded, and waited for Michael. When he reached them, he held out his hand.
Cas started to stir, the uncomfortable stairs had not made for an easy sleep. His movements woke up Dean, who was acting as his pillow. He smiled down at Cas.
Okay…there was only one left. Claire tried to pull the lever, but halfway down, it jammed. She tugged and pulled, but nothing worked to get it free. She backed up against the railing, and supported her body against it before kicking at the lever with all her might.
They ran over to Cas, who was throwing down his frying pan. Dean forced them out the door and quickly thought of a way to buy them some time. He only hoped the witches were stupid. He climbed onto the counter and found himself under one of the emergency sprinklers.
His sister came rushing out of the bathroom, and her phone fell from her hands. Floating in the middle of the room, was a wispy blue ball of light, “What do you think it is?” Claire asked, frightened.
Abaddon didn’t care about that, though. “I knew that place was worth something. There’s treasure in that house. And finally, I’m gonna get what I deserve.”
“It is a prison for children,” Abaddon said. She could sense the misery. The witches walked into the school.
Crowley had had enough as he set the chest down, “Ah, Abaddon. How kind of you to drop in. You know, if there’s one thing I’ve learned from you, it’s; always kick ‘em when they’re down, and baby…you’re six feet under! Oh, what a shame,” he stalked up to the Lazarus, and pulled the vial from its compartment. He gave it a look, “Sorry sweetheart. We’re through,” he went to smash the capsule, only to stop when Abaddon gasped.
No one in the room noticed the peeping toms outside the window. Crowley and Abaddon had spied on every therapy session, desperate for when the ghosts would finally cross over and they could look for the treasure.
Ruby, who had lost the toss, walked out with the vacuum. She gave a long-suffering sigh and lifted it into the air, “Broom ho!” she shouted, forcing the vacuum between her legs and grunting at the uncomfortable feeling.
“We share haunting stories, we throw parties,” Lucifer said as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.
“Hey, look I’m sorry! Okay? But we’re talking about three ancient hags vs. the twentieth century! How bad can it be?”
Dean stood up and confidently walked over to the other boy’s desk, “Well, in case Jimi Hendrix shows up tonight, here’s my number.” He handed the boy the paper and went back to his seat as the bell rang. Castiel folded the paper and stood up, ignoring the cat calls and wolf whistles that followed as he left the classroom.
“The dead are known for haunting us, but my question is, what’s haunting them? It’s a lack of resolution. Ghosts are simply spirits without resolution, with unfinished business. It’s my job to find out what that is.”
They stopped in front of the locked gate and just stared at the house. The building itself hadn’t been altered in any major way in three hundred years. It was now surrounded by a gate, and most of the surrounding forest had been cut away, but it still had the same effect it had had on Gabriel Novak three hundred years ago.
He nodded, and they began to search for the crypt. It didn’t take long, because directly across the bridge, was a shiny, black crypt, “That must be it.”
“But he doesn’t remember!” Lucifer hissed. What was the point of being together when the man he loved didn’t remember loving him.
“Your party started without you,” Jack said from behind Claire, trying his hardest not to let his heartbreak show on his face. Jack had made his choice, and he wouldn’t change it, no matter how much he was hurting, “Your friend’s probably waiting.”
“What, do you have termites or something?” Dean asked, seating himself, “A big house like this must have a lot of termites.”
“Or this?” Abaddon mocked, holding her book. Dean screamed and backed away when the book blinked at him. He ran over to Cas, but Abaddon opened the book. A burst of energy shot out at him, forcing him to the ground, unconscious.
Crowley and Abaddon couldn’t believe their luck. The little ghost had led them right to the treasure.
Jack stopped dancing as the clock struck ten. Claire pulled away, concerned, “Jack?” she asked. Jack didn’t say a word. He simply leaned in, giving Claire more than enough time to pull away and pressed his lips to hers in a soft, sweet first kiss.
“Yeah, no kidding? Now, get the spell book!” when Dean didn’t move, the cat hissed and scratched at his face, “Come on, move it!” while the sisters were panicking over the burning rain of death, Dean made his way over to the books display. He picked up a stand and smashed the glass. He pulled the book out while Abaddon ordered him to stop. She tried to run after him but Meg and Ruby held her back, protecting her from the rain.
“He makes fire in his hand,” Abaddon muttered, a split second before the sprinklers were activated. The sisters screamed and went to find cover from the ‘burning rain,’ while Dean jumped off the counter. He was running out the door when he slipped on the wet floor. Before he could get up, the black cat from earlier jumped on his chest.
“I am Pamala,” the voice said, and Dean’s eyes widened as a woman’s face turned around in the crystal ball, “Seer of all, voice of the spirits. Whom do you seek?”
“Maybe not,” Dean said, ignoring the punks, “but there’s a power greater than your magic, and that’s knowledge! And there’s one thing that I know that you don’t!”
Crowley and Abaddon practically crawled their way out of the tunnel. Abaddon’s red hair was falling out of its bun, and Crowley’s black suit was shredded, and covered in toothpaste and shaving cream. His hair was slicked back in an old-fashioned style, and a loose bowtie was around his neck. They had obviously not faired the machine very well, but they reached the end just in time to hear Jack say:
“Goodbye, goodb—” Abaddon cut herself off, “Sister, observe!” she pointed at the beam of light shining from the book, “They’ve opened it! Ha ha! Just when our time was almost up! Come! We fly!”
“Come on Doc, hang with us,” Sam finally noticed what Dean was doing, “Hey, wait a second. What? You ain’t thinking about packing it in now, are you, Doc?” he pulled on the box Dean was packing, resulting in a small game of tug of war that Dean quickly claimed victory of.
Sam, Dean, and Cas didn’t stop running, following the cat to the cemetery. Dean drew the line, “Woah, woah, woah! This is a graveyard!”
At that last question, she glared at them, “He’s my father,” she said, frustrated at the interrogation.
Dean ignored the question in favor of kicking on the vacuum, praying that the outlet he had plugged it into was functional. He had never been so relieved to hear that familiar loud ‘whirring’ of the vacuum. He smiled, and pointed it at the tallest ghost, honestly having no idea what was about to happen, but needing to try.
Abaddon shot two small streams of lightning at the teen boy. He was knocked to the ground, and could barely move. Ruby painfully got to her feet, growling at the boy when she stopped short, “Abi…Abi…look,” she pointed to their ‘guest of honor.’
“Oh, God! The woods!” there were two figures heading towards the trees. The boys ran to the edge of the village, a large field was now all that stood between them and the tree line. Gabriel’s heart stopped when he saw his eight-year-old sister, her flaming red hair making her stand out. She was following a stooped figure in a ratty purple coat, “Anna!” he screamed, voice echoing through the field, but she had already entered the forest.
Lucifer was in awe at the sight before him. He had waited so many years to see Michael in that suit, walking down the aisle towards him. And now, it was finally happening. But it wasn’t right. There shouldn’t be tears on his beautiful face.
“Abaddon said, ‘the candles magic will soon be spent, and dawn approaches.’ The black flame candle only brought them back for this one Halloween night! And unless they can steal the lives of children…when the sun comes up, they’re dust.”
Now, he was about to become some stupid statistic on preventable accidents. He felt himself begin to roll, and frantically grabbed at the closest thing available. The fitted rug for the staircase.
The room hidden behind the door was painted a very nice, though faded, shade of blue. It had large windows on three sides, though they were so covered in dust, there was no way Claire would be able to see what they overlooked. The room was filled with wooden boxes, and what wasn’t boxed was covered in dusty white sheets. She used one of the sheets to clean off a window, just enough to let in some light.
Immediately, the flame was black. Wind tore through the cottage. Sam squealed and covered his eyes while Cas forced the child to stand behind him, keeping a firm hand on his shoulder.
Dean blindly felt above his head, thankfully finding a hanging Edison light. The dim bulb revealed that, sure enough, they were standing in a coat closet. He looked down at Claire and grabbed her by her upper arms, “Now, I want you to stay in here, no matter what you hear. Do you understand me?” he waited until she nodded before shutting the light off once again and rushing out of the closet.
“Dean, it’s not your fault,” Cas said. Sam let out a little scream, causing the older boys to look back at the flattened cat…that was inflating.
Claire shook her head, frantically, “No! No! No! This,” she wrapped her pinky around her third finger, reminding him of their sacred promise. Dean looked down at their conjoined pinky’s in horror, finally realizing that he had left his daughter all alone. Breaking, not only his promise to her, but his promise to Cas, that he would always take care of her.
Jack groaned. Of course, she would want to follow the mysterious glowing spirit. He considered staying in the room, but he really didn’t want to see another ghost appear. He ran after his sister.
Gabriel looked at the small mill. He grabbed onto the planks and started to climb. Fortunately, there was a small window on the second story, just close enough for him to climb into the cottage.
Sam just shook his head and changed the subject back to the matter at hand, “Listen, this cat here, Gabe, he can talk. Dean’s a virgin and lit the black flame candle, the witches are back from the dead and they’re after us!”
“No, no, no, of course I don’t think you’re crazy. But remember, ghosts can’t hurt you, okay? They’re simply spirits with unfinished business, alright? Now, let’s see about this ghost,” Claire rolled her eyes. Apparently, her father wasn’t quite so open-minded when it came to his own daughter. He went over to the bathroom and opened the door all the way, “Check here…see? No ghost there,” he knelt down by the bed and checked underneath it, “Oh! No, there’s no ghost in there,” he ran over to the closet, “We can even check in there,” he pulled the closet door open, revealing a bashful looking Jack.
“It’s an old house, Mr. Winchester. My employer is anxious to move on. Would it be possible for you to come alone, so we can discuss the situation?
With nobody containing the book, it flipped open in front of Abaddon, allowing her to read the page, “Fool! All of you! My ungodly book speaks to you! On All Hallows Eve when the moon is round, a virgin will summon us from under the ground! We shall be back! And the lives of all the children, shall be mine!”
When Dean’s head finally cleared, he realized he had landed on the same vacuum cleaner that had made him fall down the stairs in the first place. Thinking fast, he grabbed the hose, thankful that he had thought to plug it in.
“Nay,” he said, apologetically, “But look, they conjure,” he pointed to the distant woods where a plume of purple smoke rose above the trees. It could be none other than the elderly Demoniac sisters who resided in the woods. They were thought to be witches, but they had never done anything to anyone, so the town didn’t bother them.
“We have to keep him calm. Jack listen! It’s okay to get scared! Everyone gets scared every now and then, but you just can’t let it stop you!” Dean turned around to see the zombies slowly making their way up the stairs. They had another minute, but if Jack didn’t open the door…
“Come child,” the figure beckoned in a straining voice. Anna gave another giggle as she followed the witch into the cottage. Gabriel stood up, wincing at the pain the movement caused. But the fiendish cackles that rang out when Anna entered the cottage gave him the strength to go on. He needed to save his sister.
“Dad, please,” Claire pulled back and her blue eyes met green, “Do not think I am as crazy as I thought you were.”
“Use thy voice, Meg! Fill the sky! Bring the little brats to die!” Abaddon commanded. She and Ruby flew over to the cottage while Meg summoned the children of Salem.
Dean quickly clapped his hands to get his husbands attention, and motioned to the phone, obviously asking what was going on.
“7:00 is perfect! We’ll get together at seven, and we’ll go over your offer.” He snuck a glance behind him just in time to see Bess hit Garth with her purse.
Jack bashfully looked around the room at all the wide-eyed junior high kids staring at him. He gave an awkward chuckle, and just gave a soft, “Boo.”
“All right,” Cas said, smiling. He loved how driven his husband was, but it was getting a bit ridiculous. Hopefully, this weekend would help.
Gabriel appeared in front of him next, “Come on, Doc. Stay tough. Don’t stop,” Dean didn’t even blink in acknowledgment. If there was one thing these three ghosts hated, it was being ignored. They wanted to be left in peace to haunt, that was for sure, but they still loved attention. And for the last couple of weeks, Dean had given them that, in abundance.
“Cool,” Alex said with a wide smile, before going to step off the porch, “I’ve gotta head home, but I’ll see you at school.”
“Dean, I’m not going up there! My friends at school told me all about that place, it’s weird!” Sam said, pulling his attention back to his brother. Dean looked down at him.
Jack looked at the spider, then at the magazine, then at his father before shaking his head, “I don’t want to.”
There was a sign on the partially open door that said, ‘Candy’s in the foyer’ so they didn’t waste time walking in, “Trick or treat,” Sam said, before a huge bowl of king sized candy bars on a table caught his eye, “Jackpot!”
“Thank you, Dean,” Abaddon said, smirking at the stage, “For that marvelous introduction!” she began to sing when the spotlight found her and her sisters. Sam, Dean, and Cas were helpless to do anything but watch as the witches cursed most of the adults in Salem to dance until they died. Including their parents. They ran out of City Hall. They ran a few blocks down the street before turning down an alley. Dean yelled before kicking a trashcan and slapping the brick wall.
Or at least, so she thought. For as she went to pull the lever, and bring her best friend back to life, she heard a voice she knew very well call out, “Honey, I’m home!” her eyes widened in terror as an obviously fresh, distorted ghost, came floating into the lab. A ghost wearing a leather jacket, with a hint of flannel underneath. A ghost with short, slightly spikey blond hair. A ghost with apple green eyes. Her father.
“You idiot!” the red head yelled, “The boy has tricked us! And he’s stolen the book! After them!” The witches walked out the door and down the front path. They stopped at the road.
Jack plopped two plates with a stack of pancakes, one with a side of scrambled eggs, in front of the family, “Can I get you anything else?”
He couldn’t see Sam’s face beneath his werewolf mask, but he could hear the tears in his voice when he said, “I wanna go home! Now!” he ran off.
Claire looked at the card still in her hands and set it on the table, “Oh, well okay. Don’t worry about it. I’m sure I can come up with something perfect for the party,” she couldn’t deny that she was a bit disappointed, but she knew it wasn’t his fault, “I’m gonna go look around, and see if I can find anything.”
“Sorry,” Ruby said, while she and Meg tried not to laugh, “She needs to concentrate,” she mimicked quietly. She put the bowl down and stopped, sniffing the air. Each sister had a particular set of powers. Abaddon was the only person alive who could read from that book, and her potions never failed. She could also summon lightning from her hands. Meg’s voice was hypnotic. Literally. She could entrance anyone to do her bidding.
He remembered right in the nick of time, he realized as he caught the wooden frame holding the picture, “Not! Not…this one. Thank you, gentlemen.”
“Sammy!” he got down on his knees, bringing himself eyelevel to his little brother, “Just do this one thing for me and I promise I’ll do anything you say. Please.”
“Because of me, my little sister’s life was stolen…for years I waited for my life to end, so I could be reunited with my family. But, Abaddon’s curse of immortality kept me alive. Finally, I figured out what to do with my life. I’d failed Anna, but I wouldn’t fail again. When Abaddon and her sisters returned, I’d be there to stop them. For three hundred years, I guarded that house on Halloween night, I knew some airhead virgin might light that candle,” he glared at Dean when he said that. Dean just rolled his eyes.
Dean slammed the door to his bedroom. He threw off his jacket and collapsed onto his bed. He grabbed a pillow and held it to his chest, “Cas, you’re so soft. I just wanna—"
“It’s actually Bumble’s fault that I’m late. He was a little buzzed and made a mess of honey in the back seat.”
Just as Claire and Dean got to the bridge, they heard a groan coming from the crypt behind them. They didn’t want to turn around, but they wanted to make sure it was just their imagination. No such luck.
Lucifer smiled at the frazzled man, “Let me help you with those,” he knelt to help Castiel fix up the books he had knocked over, “Roman hates when I leave things lying about.”
The next morning, Claire found her way down to the kitchen, armed with a dust buster for defense. She peeked around the door, finger on the power switch, ready to protect herself. Fortunately, the room looked clear of anyone, living or dead.
His hand was warm as he led her to the middle of the dance floor. He wrapped her arms around his neck and placed his hands securely on her waist, before gently leading the two of them in a dance.
Claire’s eyes widened, and she leaped forward, landing with an ‘Umph’ on her stomach, the vial safely cupped in her hands as the treasure chest landed a few feet away from her, the force knocking the padlock off. She stood up, rubbing her aching abdomen, and looked inside the treasure chest.
“The master must never know. Lucifer and his love will be reunited, and this curse shall be broken.”
Castiel swallowed and looked at Roman, who was giving him a pointed glare. He put his hand in Lucifer’s, “Yes, my love,” and stood next to him.
“No. Mr. Lafitte, my teacher, talked to me about it after school. He said that the student council would show up early to decorate, and they would also have food and drinks. It’s apparently against school rules for a parent to supply food. Something about not knowing allergies, and not knowing what the parent might have put in the food? I don’t know, it seems weird to me, but what do I know? I’ve never been to a dance, and you’ve never been a part of the PTA. We literally just have to take their word for it. Mr. Lafitte even said they would clean up the party afterwards. The only thing we would have to do is supply the place. Is it okay?” she asked, widening her big blue eyes that she knew were so similar to Papa’s. Her Dad had never been able to resist either of them.
She had just made herself comfortable when the teacher, a large man with a thick beard, and an equally thick Louisiana accent came in.
Dean put his arms around Sammy and held him close. Gabe had been reunited with his family, Cain was able to rest, and the town’s adults were finally able to stumble home, exhausted, but alive. The wandering children made it back home.
Dean walked over to Cas and grabbed the book, “Well, let’s torch the sucker,” he dropped the book to the ground and pulled out his lighter. When he held the flame to the cover, nothing happened.
Dean finally made it out of the passageway, and, seeing no other option, began to walk. He had no idea where he was, but he hoped he would find somebody. He approached the only door in the hallway and pushed it open. The only thing in the room was an ancient telephone, and a beautiful ornate mirror. He took a quick glance in the mirror to make sure he didn’t have any cobwebs on him from the passageway and was startled when a crow cawed from outside the window.
“You don’t remember anything from your life?” Claire also, couldn’t quite believe it. It sounded awful, not knowing anything about yourself.
The camera once more focused on the doctor’s daughter. She was obviously at school and looked very annoyed at the man behind the camera, “How do you feel about your father’s career?”
Claire cringed a bit, “I don’t wanna look cute. Cute’s like when you’re nine years old, and you’ve got papier-mache around your head. Or when you’re wearing a sheet with holes cut out for the eyes. I wanna look nice…like, grown up nice.”
Cas was having much better luck with Meg. As the witch approached, he poured a handful of salt and threw it at her. She screamed in pain and flew away as the salt burned her skin.
Cas could barely choke out, “I do,” the last time he had said those words it was the happiest day of his life. Now it was the most horrifying.
She went to grab the oil, but was stopped by Ruby, “Ah-ah, I got it. You do that, I’ll do this,” she put the drops in the cauldron.
Jack noticed something he didn’t like, “Papa!” he said, going over to Cas, “This place has spiders!” Cas gave him a hug and a comforting pat on the head. Before he could say anything, a door opened from the hallway under the stairs. A man walked down the hall towards them. He had short, dark hair, and was wearing a tuxedo. He looked like he was in his mid-forties but was unhealthily pale.
“Okay,” Dean said. He looked through most of the trunks contents until he found a letter in a red envelope. He opened the letter and began to read:
“Alright Dean, you’ve had your fun but it’s time to go,” Sam pleaded. He grabbed Cas’ hand and led him to the door, “Come on, Cas.”
“Perhaps it is not too deep?” Meg wondered. Ruby and Abaddon shared a look before pushing Meg into the road.
Claire looked at a rack filled with three empty bottles, and one that was half empty. It was filled with a bright red liquid that she couldn’t place, “What is this?”
Before either ghost could answer, they heard a voice from above. A distinctly living voice, “Hello?”
Jack floated in a relaxed pose a few inches above his favorite chair, mindlessly channel surfing. He thought of all the people who had been to the house, recently and all the different ways his uncles managed to scare them off. It happened every time. All Jack really wanted was a friend, but the few people who weren’t scared of him were scared off by his uncles.
“Could you please not ask me any questions,” Claire asked with an annoyed side-eye. The interviewer ignored the reasonable request and continued to badger the young girl with question after question, which she steadfastly ignored.
He stopped at a headstone. It had a skull and crossbones carved into it, and the stone only read, ‘Here lies Cain Adamson; A Damned Soul’
Dean flicked open his lighter. He had been pounding on the door for the last few minutes, but nobody had come, and he couldn’t find any way to open the passageway from this side. He saw no other alternative but to go through it, “Where’s that scary albino when you need him,” he muttered to himself.
Claire walked over to one of the boxes, and after a bit of struggling, managed to pull the nailed-on lid off. When she looked in the contents of the box, she finally realized what the room was.
“I’m sorry, Anna. I had to wait three hundred years for a virgin to light a candle,” the spirits vanished.
The ghosts gathered to look over his shoulder, curious about what had finally made him stop. The picture was of a man, with messy black hair, and the softest blue eyes. He had tan skin and was a bit scruffy, but not in an unkempt way. He had that look to him that implied that he was a little eccentric. Sam figured it was the eyes. They didn’t seem to be noticing anything, but they were still focused. Gabriel thought it was the smile. A small little thing, obviously not a common occurrence. Lucifer knew it was the combination.
“Yeah. I know it looks kind of funky and stuff from the outside. But, I mean, I don’t know—inside it’s kind of cool,” she wasn’t really lying. The house was beautiful and, the ghosts really weren’t all that bad once you got to know them.
Claire walked down the street. Her dad had been sure to point out her new school while they had been driving to the manor, and it really wasn’t too far away. Just down the hill, and about half a mile into town. She was lost in thought, mainly taking in the scenery of her new town, which she had to admit, was kind of adorable.
Roman glared at him, “His children. The ones he wasn’t supposed to bring. Along with that brainless husband of his. If I’d had to listen to another word from that insufferable fool, I think I would have burst.”
She plopped down on the floor, pulling her duffle bag to her. Her dad had gotten her enrolled in school on the drive up, and she would start tomorrow. Hopefully, she would be able to find something comfortable and clean. Maybe even kinda cute, something that would say, ‘you want to be friends with me.’ Just because she hasn’t had much luck at the last three schools, that didn’t mean this one wouldn’t be different.
“I was worried you wouldn’t find it,” she said, walking up to him, “Besides, Jack’s fine. But Pamela said, ‘find the black crypt with no name, or your fate will be the same.’”
“What is it, Nick?” she asked, irritated at being woken up. She had just gotten the baby to sleep, and he pulls this! The kid had colic!
She was angry. she pulled herself up to her feet and crawled over to Dean. She picked him up and began to breath in his lifeforce before she felt her feet burning. She looked down at the ground. The hallowed ground. It was sacred, and she was demonic. She was turning to stone. “Book!” she called, but not even her spells could help her now. Abaddon Demoniac had turned to stone.
“It’s just a bunch of hocus pocus!” Abaddon cackled, “Meg,” she pointed to the left, ordering her sister to fly around them. The boys screamed as Meg flew up to them.
Gabriel walked Castiel down to the ballroom. He truly looked beautiful in the white suite, and his hair had been combed neatly. He was even wearing a very slight layer of makeup to accentuate his angelic features. He was truly breathtaking, but the tears in his blue eyes took away from his looks.
Ben looked up at the hideous old house. It looked even more terrifying at night, and he really wished he had listened to Jesse’s suggestion that they wait until early morning. He took a deep breath, “Okay… one picture, and we’re history.”
Dean pursed his lips. He knew his daughter was lonely, and he knew that this wasn’t a healthy life style for anyone, let alone a preteen girl, “Honey, you will,” Claire scoffed again, clearly not believing him. Dean honestly couldn’t fault her, “I mean, come on. We’re moving to Friendship, Maine. Even I might make one,” he joked.
Sam jumped onto Dean’s bed, still laughing, “I scared you, I scared you, ha ha!” he mocked his older brother, “Who’s Cas?” he giggled with a smirk.
“It ain’t often we meet a bonebag as amusin’ as you,” Gabriel agreed. Dean just continued to ignore them, and continued packing. The trio stared at him. If they were anyone else, they might even say they were concerned.
Abaddon rolled her eyes before grabbing Ruby by the ear, “Leave her be, she has done her chore!” Ruby winced, but nodded. Although, when Abaddon turned back to the book, she couldn’t resist growling at the youngest sister, “Right,” Abaddon announced, flipping over the front cover, “Tis time!” the books pages began to flip.
“Sucking the lives out of little children!” Abaddon’s hands leaving the door to go to Meg’s neck was all the townsfolk needed to get into the cottage.
“Dean, I’m not leaving you!” Sam protested. Before either could argue, Gabe muttered an ‘uh oh’. They looked out into the street and saw three distinct shadows. Fortunately, the alley had a ton of junk that they could hide behind.
The program cut to a testimonial from one of his past clients, whose face was blurred for privacy, “My Garth passed away five years ago, but he was so sad, his spirit wouldn’t leave the farm. So, I called Dr. Winchester, and in a few weeks, Garth left smiling.”
The family stood in the doorway but didn’t enter. Nobody was there. The door seemed to have opened on its own. Dean shared a look with his husband, and hesitantly stepped inside, “Hello,” he called, “Is anybody home? Hello! It’s the Winchester’s, from Winchester’s Realties! Hi!” there was nobody. It was as if the house was abandoned. He shrugged and motioned his family inside. They could at least get out of the rain.
He marched Cas down the hall. The poor man didn’t even have a chance to comfort his children before he was forced into the dining room. Gabriel handed him a bouquet as Sam began to play the wedding march.
Dean waved a hand, “Oh, no. I think they’re actually getting to be quite focused now,” On cue, the ghosts burst into disbelieving cackles. Claire and Dean couldn’t help but snicker. Those three grew on you after a while. Like barnacles.
Gabriel scoffed before slamming one of the heavier suitcases into Sam’s hands and dragging him towards the light, “The hell I can’t!” he declared as they too, were lifted into heaven, along with the other spirits who had been trapped in the house. They were all free.
Claire couldn’t look at him anymore. Her heart was broken for her friend, who would be stuck here, alone for all eternity. It just wasn’t fair. She looked down at a pile of newspapers by her feet. The different headlines on the front page confirmed what he had told her; ‘Shurley Youth Dies,’ ‘Double Suicide Following Youngest Shurley Brother Funeral,’ ‘Mysterious Activity At Hunters Manor,’ ‘Father Invents “Resurrection” Machine To Raise Dead Son.’ That last one caught her eye, and she picked up the paper. Under the headline, there was a sketch of a man with curly hair, and a full beard, “Is that your dad?” she asked. Jack nodded. She went on to read the article next to the picture, “Charles Shurley claimed that he was haunted by the ghost of his dead son. And that he invented a machine to bring him back to life, the Laz—”
Dean was lucky. He fell onto a shorter part of the roof, rolled off of that onto the green house, and fell off of that onto the roof of his beloved impala. He was in a lot of pain, but nothing felt broken, and he would live. He definitely needed to go to a hospital, but at least it wouldn’t be the morgue. Unlike his husband if Dean couldn’t find a way to get back into the house and save him.
Lucifer watched the other two disappear and tried to get away, but the force from the vacuum grabbed onto him. He tried to stay out, but wasn’t able to fight it, “This thing sucks!” was the last thing he said before disappearing from sight.
“Oh no, I really don’t think we should. We have plans,” Cas said with a pointed look at his husband.
“Crowley, you’re taking this way too personally!” Abaddon shouted, as she continued to drive. She drove too fast, and ended up in the small woods behind the house. She couldn’t stop, and she could barely see, so she just continued to drive like a maniac until her car finally ran into a tree, forcing her to a dead stop as the airbag deployed in her face.
He rolled down the flight of thirty-eight stairs, keeping ahold of the corner of the rug the entire way down. Fortunately, he was rolled in the carpet during this, the thick material protecting him from the dangerous fall. He heard the three ghosts heckling his situation as they watched him fall, heard their mocking laughter as he hit the floor, with the momentum of his descent forcing him to keep rolling, until he reached the end of the carpet.
She headed over to the wardrobe, when another door caught her eye. It was small. The perfect size for her, but her Dad would definitely need to duck to get through it. She turned the nob, but the door was stuck tight. it obviously hadn’t been opened in quite a while. She gathered her strength, and pushed against the door with all of her might.
“It is him, Sir,” Roman assured him, “The gypsy woman prophesied her return. And now, the time has come. We’d best get you ready.”
Cas smiled and grabbed two cups of the cider. He handed one to Dean, and kept the other for himself.
“Yeah, how do we get out?” Dean asked. He was pretty sure they wouldn’t be able to use the door, and they couldn’t even find it if they were able.
What she didn’t know as she prepared to break the door down was that a small ghost had finally made it back to the mansion, and had heard her yells. Jack floated over to the closet she was stuck in as fast as he could, opening the door just as she was throwing herself at it.
The witches in red and purple stepped through the door, and the one in green leaned out the window. He could see that she was an old hag, with faded red hair and skin the color of parchment. She had drawn two bright red circles on her cheeks with rouge and her lips were a deep crimson that belonged on a much younger woman. The one in purple had short, stringy, white blond hair, and the third had grey hair, with a single chocolate covered strand. She also had red smeared on her lips.
Claire smiled at the handsome boy in front of her. He was incredibly light on his feet, and moved so confidently, that if she hadn’t looked down at that moment, she would never have known they were floating a good three feet off the ground.
“Witch hunters! Notice how they wear black robes, and carry axes to chop the wood to burn us!” Abaddon warned.
“Okay, settle down,” Mr. Lafitte said, “Put a lid on it!” he waited until the class quieted, before continuing, “Now, I have a few announcements to make before we get started. First, the asbestos removal from the gym is taking longer than planned. Unfortunately, we have to push the Halloween dance back by a couple of months.”
Dean was shocked, but also pretty proud of himself. He gave a tired chuckle, and blew on the end of the hose, as if blowing smoke off a gun.
Abaddon threw open a window, “Book!” she yelled, echoing through the town, “Come home, or make thyself known!” she sobbed.
“Papa goes over here,” she grabbed the picture and carefully placed it on the bedside table, facing the bed. Both so he could watch after her, and she would be able to see him.
If Claire was being honest, that was the last thing she wanted to do. This was the thing she hated the most about new schools. The awkward introduction. She sighed, but stood and slunk her way to the front of the classroom, trying to ignore the whispers of the other students. She reached the front of the class and avoided looking out into the sea of judgmental twelve-year olds. Before she could get it over with, something unexpected caught her eye. In the poster of Mt. Rushmore, where Lincoln’s head should be, was Jack. He was just floating there, trying to match the face on the poster. When he saw her looking at him, he gave her a big smile and an encouraging nod.
“Gentlemen. Happy hour,” the ghosts were determined to cheer Dean up, and so they picked him up, and floated him out the window, cheerfully singing ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall as they floated over to the best bar in Friendship.
“Well…how did it go?” Abaddon asked, already used to the strange way the priests would leave the manor.
Roman nodded, sure they would do as commanded, “The final arrangements have been made. Nothing further will interfere with the master’s plans.”
He grabbed the microphone from the singer and said, “People of Salem! Your kids are in danger! Three hundred years ago, the Demon sisters bewitched people! Now they’re back! They’re right over there.”
“Are you trying to tell me that I just spent the last two days holding his clammy hand and waiting for him to die, and all I get in return is one lousy piece of property?” Abaddon was furious. She and her cousin had always hated each other, but this was just too far. This was just Cain’s final ‘I hate you’ to his own cousin.
“I knew I smelled a boy!” Ruby sang, happily. The two hags pounced, but he ran around to the other side of the cauldron. The chased him around it, ignoring Abaddon’s cries to be careful of her potion. He pushed the cauldron with all of his strength, knocking the witches down, and then he poured the boiling potion onto them, silently reveling in their cries of pain.
“It’s not just a car! She’s a very delicate piece of machinery,” he turned to Baby, and wiped a smudge off the black paint, “Shh. She didn’t mean what she just said,” he cooed. Jack and Claire rolled their eyes.
Claire rolled her eyes, as she put her things in her locker. She grabbed her binder and trusty mechanical pencil that had been with her for the last six schools and hurried to find her class. Fortunately for her, it was actually pretty close, and she noticed Alex and Henry sitting by the window. Everyone seemed pretty comfortable where they were, so she just found the closest abandoned looking seat.
They burst open the front door and floated into the house. As they headed to the kitchen, Sam stopped short, putting his long arms out to keep the other two from moving forward, “Hey, Lucifer, do you smell something?”
The gate didn’t move when Dean honked the horn, and nobody came out to open it, so he reluctantly got out of the car to look for a call box, all the while complaining about ruining his new shoes. Cas rolled his eyes and got out with him. They walked up to the gate and looked in awe at the mansion behind it. It was old, and a little decrepit, but still beautiful.
Abaddon and Crowley looked on in horror as a swirling, menacing glowing vortex appeared in the middle of the foyer. The moans and cries coming from the distorted faces were enough to send the two scrambling out to their car, as shrieking laughter followed them.
“Honey! Nephie!” Dean came barreling down the hallway when Claire began to scream. Jack disappeared right before Dean went sliding into the room, “Honey, honey, what happened?”
“Hell no!” he said before following the others down into the hole, “What is this place, Gabe?” he asked, taking out the lighter. The room they were in was dank and musty. There were roots dangling from the ceiling.
And that was how it continued to go. Priests, psychics, witch doctors, a group of four kids and a large dog in a groovy van, ghost hunters, the next few weeks saw dozens of these types of people go in and out of the Hunters Manor. And not a single one was able to get the ghosts out of there. All of them ran, screaming, away from the manor, away from the town, some even left the state, not wanting to be anywhere near the house and its inhabitants.
“Cookies?!” the tall man asked incredulously, “Don’t offer them cookies, Gabriel! They’re trespassers! Trespassers don’t get cookies. This is none of their concern.”
Roman was standing in front of them, looking at them with annoyance and thinly veiled disgust, “The children are not in their room. Have you seen them?”
When the chair finally came to a stop, both ghost and girl took a deep breath, certain they could relax for just a minute, which is naturally when the doorbell rang. It was six o’clock. Claire sighed and looked at Jack, “Perfect,” she huffed, before running out of the chair and towards the front door.
They could only watch, helpless as Abaddon pulled out the vial that held the potion, “All right, you little bastard!” Sam screamed and covered his mouth.
They looked around the museum, and even Dean was impressed. Abaddon’s cauldron hung from a chain attached to the ceiling, the witches’ broomsticks were mounted on the wall. Everything on display in the museum had been found in the cottage. Sam and Dean were so invested in what Cas was telling them about the items, that no one noticed the black cat with whiskey colored eyes peering in from the window.
Gabriel’s way apparently involved a ghostly horse-drawn carriage going through the walls of the mansion to get them outside. Dean held his children close and prayed. He could be a reckless driver when it was just him, but this was putting his family at risk, and he didn’t like that in the slightest. He shouted out the window, “I thought you said you could drive this thing!”
“There’s plenty in Maine,” she declared, grabbing his injured hand and pulling him out of the office.
Roman ignored him to glare at Sam and Gabriel, “I will deal with you two later,” he said, effectively banishing them from the room.
“Well…” he shrugged and turned back to the candle. He flicked the lighter, but before he had a chance to light it, he was attacked.
Ruby stood up from her seat on the bus, “Stop!” she screamed, making the bus screech to a halt. She walked over to Abaddon, “I smell…children,” she whispered.
Cas’s eyes widened, “In the first place, we weren’t even supposed to be here! We were supposed to be at the lake!”
“Jack, no!” Claire argued as he grabbed her hand and pulled her to her feet, “Jack, no! No, no, no!” she tried to stop him from pulling her over to the room’s balcony. Jack started to lift her up, but he was a bit too slow and her foot knocked against the railing hard enough to cause both of their grips to loosen. Claire went tumbling out of the window, down to the harsh ocean very, very far below her. She screamed as the water came closer and closer to her, before she felt something grab her foot, and the ocean, thankfully, began to recede as Jack pulled her up by her ankle, “Jack, no! Oh my God, this is high! This is very high! Jack! Jack!” Jack continued to ignore her screams as he flew them both over the ocean.
Claire didn’t even notice him as she climbed down off the machine and approached her deceased father, “Dad?”
“Of course, Sir,” Sam agreed, wanting to get this conversation over with, so they could get the kids back safely, “What a fool.”
“A holy mess, you know what we’re saying?” Sam continued, “But for you…I don’t know. Maybe we can work something out. If you can keep that demon Abaddon off our backs, then I’d say we got a deal. Right boys?” the other two ghosts nodded in agreement, “Deal?” Sam offered, raising his intangible hand.
Claire guessed the party was going fine. She had never been to one before, but everyone seemed to be having a good time, and the ghostly trio hadn’t even made an appearance. She guessed they felt guilty for inadvertently causing the temporary death of her father, and that this was their way of apologizing. Though judging by the way some of her classmates were looking around, almost bored, she guessed they were disappointed not to see any ghosts. Oh well, she doubted they would be so excited to see the ghostly trio if they had decided to make an appearance.
“Of course not, my dear…but that is entirely up to you. If not, I really do fear for the children.” Without another word, Roman left the room. Castiel plopped down onto the bed. It could just be a bluff, but could he risk it? No, he couldn’t risk it. he loved his children more than life itself. He really had no other choice.
Dean blinked once, twice. That was certainly not what he thought she would say, “When you say host…you mean DJ, or something? At the school gym, right?”
Claire was finally able to relax when he set her down on top of a lighthouse, the same one she was able to see from her balcony. It was interesting to see the house from here, and she had to admit, the view of the ocean was beautiful. But as she and Jack sat next to each other, she didn’t say a word.
“Funny how time flies when you’re dead!” Ruby laughed. The others cackled, Sam joining in, trying hard to make his laugh seem realistic.
“No more than twenty minutes,” he promised, “Twenty minutes tops. You should be excited, you finally get to see daddy and papa in real estate action!”
Dean chased after him and found him sitting in a small jack o’lantern patch someone had as a decoration. Dean felt terrible when he saw that Sam had taken off his mask to dry his tears. He sat down next to him and said, “Sammy, I’m sorry. It’s just that I hate this place! I miss all my friends and I wanna go home! But I shouldn’t have taken it out on you.”
Claire rolled her eyes, “No. Hunters Manor,” the laughter finally stopped and each student stared up at her in disbelief, “You’ve heard of it,” she should have known.
“A ha,” Missouri said, giving Dean an unimpressed look, “we seem to have a skeptic in our midst. Mr. Winchester, would you care to share your Kansas farmer point of view?” he couldn’t help but smirk while the kids laughed at his expense. Lawrence wasn’t a farming town, but once you said Kansas, that was the first thought that came to mind.
Jack’s head was spinning. Claire’s papa was an angel, his dad still looked after him, he could potentially remake the formula that brings ghosts back to life, and he would be able to go to the dance. The little ghost was amazed he was still conscious, “So, does that mean I have until midnight?”
Dean didn’t have time to respond to the admittedly true statement before a black SUV pulled up in front of them. A man in a black suit stepped out, followed by a red-headed woman.
“What are you doing here? You’re not supposed to be up here! You have to leave!” the children turned around to see a man, a very tall man with long hair, who looked a little younger than their fathers.
“Listen to this,” Cas said, reading aloud, “Only a circle of salt can protect thy victims from thy power.” Before he could read any more, Gabe jumped onto the book, closing it, “We were just trying to help you,” Cas defended.
“Gabriel! Gabriel Novak!” the boys turned to see a young girl with flaming red hair wearing a long, white nightgown. She was obviously a spirit. She smiled when she saw Gabe.
Dean faced his trio of enemies and held aloft his most powerful weapon. A weapon known far and wide as something dangerous and vile, something that no sane being, living or dead, would want to be touched by. A used toilet plunger.
The boys shared a look, neither one wanted to go in, but they also didn’t want to be the one to suggest leaving. But as Ben slowly made his way through the door, Jesse couldn’t stop himself, “Do we really have to do this?” he asked, stopping his friend.
“Why bother? We’re just gonna be packing it all back up again in two weeks, right?” Dean just gave her a look and held up his pinky. Claire smiled, “I’m kidding, I’m kidding. This place is…fine. I’ll unpack on my own, okay?”
Gabriel noticed Jack cleaning the kitchen, “What are you doing? That counter used to be dirty enough to eat off of,” he complained.
Honestly, the whole experience was like a carwash for a human, and not something Claire ever wanted to experience again. She finally rolled out of the tunnel and down into a very large cave, illuminated by high window, that obviously doubled as a laboratory. The chair rolled to a stop in front of a desk, where Jack sat, waiting for her, “Well?” he asked, expectantly.
Claire gave him an incredulous look, “You’re gonna sell a house, with this!” she exclaimed, motioning to the cemetery.
“Did I not tell him to come alone? Is it really too much to ask for a little cooperation? A little order?”
“What a fool to give up thy life…for thy brother’s!” she said, throwing the boy to the ground, and grabbing Dean by the collar. The witch rose high above the ground, as Dean’s life force surrounded his body. He dangled at the end of the broomstick, terrified, but he wasn’t willing to die. As Abaddon attempted to take his lifeforce, he fought her.
As they climbed out of the car, Claire slammed her door behind her, “Hey, now. Don’t slam the door like that. She’s sensitive,” Dean said, walking over to Baby.
Dean had taken up residence in the front office. He turned on the PA system and couldn’t resist giving a werewolf howl, and letting it echo through the school, “Welcome to High School Hell! I’m your host, Boris Karloff Jr,” he gave a maniacal laugh. This was more fun than he had thought it would be, “It’s time to meet our three contestants; Meg, Ruby, and Abaddon Demoniac.” The witches in question were wandering aimlessly through the halls of the school, trying to figure out where Dean’s voice came from. A black cat walked out of a room near them. He looked at them and let out an angry hiss. Ruby growled in response and the witches followed him for a few minutes until they heard;
Jack turned on the tv in her room, setting the channel to the story on Dr. Winchester. She didn’t notice, still caught up in the argument, “Look, I have had a very long and trying day. Do you think you could bring me a pint of Ben and Jerry’s ice cream, the Tonight Dough, and a Diet Pepsi? Do you comprehend what I am asking for? Do you think you can handle that? Now you want me to hold. Fine.”
“The deed to the house. It’s yours. Do with it what you will; sell it, keep it, do whatever makes you and your family happy. And thank you…thank you all, so much.” And with those final words, he walked over to Michael. It was time for them to go. The two men didn’t let go of each other’s hands as they were lifted into the light of heaven.
“Hello Dean,” Dean smiled at the gravely voice on the other line. It was his husband, “How is it going? Do they like the house?”
They dropped their bags, looking in awe at their surroundings. They were so caught up in how the room looked, that they didn’t notice the pale, transparent head looking down at them from the ceiling.
Cas could have cried, “Dean,” he whispered softly before dropping the goblet and running to his real husband. Dean wrapped his arms around him tightly.
Roman’s eyes narrowed, “Very well…I suppose we will just have to place other settings,” he said, before turning around and heading back down the hallway. Cas held Claire and Jack’s hands as they followed. Something about this man made him very uncomfortable.
“Happy anniversary,” Cas said. He was mad, but he still accepted the bee. When he wrapped his hand around the small neck, he felt something hard. Looking down, he noticed a beautiful, and obviously expensive watch. Dean unfastened the watch from the bee and put it on Castiel’s wrist. This, at least, he had bought weeks ago, “It’s beautiful,” he said, honestly.
Claire scoffed, grabbing one of the boxes and moving it to the closet. She might have seen Jack inside of it trying to figure out a way to say hi, if she hadn’t been looking at her father, “Please. This is the deadest place yet.”
“No, I am not happy, Claire. I was trying to make a point to your brother about how important it is to kill your own spider!”
They made it right when the sky opened up and ran immediately began to fall in noisy sheets of water.
Dean watched him go with a smile before looking at the paper in his hand. He unfolded it and his heart dropped when he saw, Dean Winchester; 1-866-907-3235. Cas had given back his phone number. Dean crumpled up the paper and tossed it into a nearby garbage can before getting started on the ride home.
She ignored him and kept watching the wisp as it floated through the door, “It does! It wants us to follow it!” she said, excitedly before chasing after it.
Jack had been looking for Claire all morning with no luck. He had finally floated up to the attic, a room he didn’t see much point in spending time in. The small ghost noticed noise coming from an open door off to the side, and floated over to it. before he could head inside, Claire peeked around the door frame, “It’s about time,” she said with a laugh before pulling back, and letting him see what was inside.
Jack sighed, “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to drop you. I didn’t mean to scare you, either. I just wanted to show you things the way I see them, but I shouldn’t have done it how I did. I really am sorry.”
They sat in silence before Claire decided to ask something that had been on her mind for a few days now, “What were you like when you were alive?”
“Yes, but the steps were too high. When we get older, we could trip!” Garth tried to reason. Dean liked Garth. He was a kindergarten teacher with a great sense of humor…he just refused to pick a house! and Bess was getting over it.
“Guys, guys don’t fight!” a young boy’s voice called out as the phone was taken out of Jesse’s hands. The two friends looked on in horror as the phone was held in front of them, “I’ll take the picture! Say cheese.”
“I’m not gonna leave him out here by himself. You two stay out there, and I’ll take care of this,” he gave both of his children a hug, and walked up to the crypts entrance. He pulled the rusty latch, and the large door gave a loud creak of disapproval as he forced the door open. Dean coughed as decades worth of dust and cobwebs fell into his face as he started down into the crypt. Before he went to far, he turned back to his children, “I’m gonna be right back, all right?”
While the other witches were distracted, Cas grabbed one of the displayed brooms off the wall, “Ruby!” he called, getting her attention.
Crowley picked up the folder as Abaddon turned on him, “This is all your fault, as usual! If you had just forged the damn will!”
“Ha! He’s down for the count!” Gabriel laughed, honestly shocked that had even worked. Lucifer and Sam floated back. The three were ready to continue the battle, a bit more wary, but nonetheless determined to win.
Crowley gave a pleased little laugh, before sobering, and realizing a small problem with that, “If you were a ghost.”
One of the apparitions gave a hard yank to his flannel shirt, causing him to spin around, batting his arms in an attempt to get them away from him. Unfortunately, his jerky movements ended with him tripping over a terribly placed vacuum cleaner and fall onto the top step. He swore at himself for being so stupid. He had only put the vacuum there because he wanted to clean up his and Claire’s rooms before they were slept in. He had actually just barely found an outlet for it when Claire had screamed about that first ghost.
She waited for a few moments, before the trunk’s lid opened, and Jack floated out, holding a long, elegant white lace dress in his transparent hands, “Check it out. He floated high above her head, “Hands up, Claire,” he waited until she did so before carefully dropping the dress over her head, until she emerged out the other side.
He reached the pile of broken glass, but there was no Abaddon, alive or otherwise. What there was, however, was the beaker he had stolen from the lab. He smirked as he picked it up, knowing he had the power in his hands now. Before he could get too excited, he heard a car start up. Too close for comfort, was Abaddon’s black SUV. She revved the engine and he could almost hear her laughing at the dangerous situation he was in.
They had been trick or treating for nearly an hour and a half and Dean was tired. He had tried to enjoy himself, and even trick or treated for a good forty minutes, but this was getting old.
Dean held the bat as Abaddon flew to him, “For the last time, prepare to meet thy doom!” she shouted. Dean rolled his eyes and swung with all of his might. She flew out of range in the nick of time, “You little pest! I’ve had enough of you!” she grabbed the bat on his next swing and knocked him to the ground.
Azazel hummed and read down the will, “Let’s see…bobcats…owls…snakes…Ah. Here it is. Cousin: Abaddon. To my only living relative I leave you the Hunters Manor in Maine.”
“Let’s just take the picture and get out of here,” Ben said, pulling out his phone. The picture easily showed the boys, but none of the mansion surrounding them. He sighed, and handed his phone to his friend while he went to stand where the moonlight was shining through one of the large picture windows.
And so, Dr. Dean Winchester gave out a long and shockingly high-pitched scream, before turning around, throwing his daughter over his shoulder, and running out of the room.
Lucifer ignored him, “Jack!” he shouted, just as the little ghost floated in through an open window, a fresh slice of pie sat on a plate in his ghostly hand.
“The ‘Up and At’em’ Machine. My dad was a really great inventor, but he had a little trouble getting going in the morning.”
“The master usually does not take visitors, however, from your photograph, he thought you to have a trustworthy face…But your husband, he feels differently.”
Jack flinched at his sister and father’s screams. He had to do this. With a deep breath, Jack marched up to the door, opened the latch, and pulled with all of his might. Tears filled his eyes as the large spiders began to jump on him. He backed away from the door as his dad and Claire ran through the door and forced it shut before latching it.
Dean walked over to the candle and read the description attached, “The black flame candle: It was made from the fat of a hangman,” he grimaced, “It says that by the light of the full moon it will raise spirits of the dead when lit by a virgin on Halloween night. Hmm…” he pulled the lighter out of his pocket, “So let’s light the sucker and meet the old broads,” Sam shook his head, begging him not to. Dean ignored him and held the lighter out to Cas, “Will you do the honor?”
Claire couldn’t deny that Maine was beautiful. She actually let herself be excited. He had promised they wouldn’t move again, and she didn’t think this would be the worst place. It was better than Kansas, that was for sure. And Friendship even had a beach! No, it was definitely beautiful, and as they drove up to the decrepit manor they would be living in, it was also too good to be true. Maine was beautiful, this mansion was awful.
Crowley looked around at the construction workers preparing for the demolition, “Are you sure we’re not going a tad overboard here?”
“Oh, it was fine. It was no problem at all, just a piece of cake. I think I should go to the hospital now, though. Please excuse me.”
Claire looked over the levers, “Oh, man…how am I gonna do this? I couldn’t even get my Easy Bake oven to work…” she sighed before taking a chance and pulling a lever. As the evil armchair that had taken her down to the lab in the first place went back into the tunnel, she guessed that that had probably been the wrong one.
Claire hesitantly walked up to the entrance and noticed a carving on the door written in Latin, “Look,” she said to her dad, “It’s a warning.”
“Come on, Jack, it’s just a spider. How big could it be?” he took his son’s hand and walked him back down the hall to his bedroom. Sure enough, crawling on the window, was a spider, a little smaller than a quarter, “Come on, you’re acting like it’s Shelob, or something,” he pulled the small boy over to the window, “Look, you’re ten years old, I think it’s time you learned how to kill a spider. The most efficient way to crush a spider,” the father picked a magazine off his son’s bedside table and rolled it up, “You take a good magazine, and roll it up good and tight. You get an eye on that spider and take a good side swing to kill it. That’s all you have to do.”
The trio shared a confused look. Hadn’t they made that clear? Sam looked back at the therapist, “What, you think I’m blind? Of course, I’ve seen him. Who hasn’t?”
“To the Save the Bees Foundation: $14 million. And to the Save the Dolphins Foundation: $11 million. To the Save the Pumas Foundation: $1.2 million. To the Patagonian Wasp Salvation Fund: $1.4 million.”
“Witches! Daughters of darkness! Open this door!” A voice called from outside the cottage. They could see the ominous glow of torches threw their windows.
Cas gave a small smirk and held up a folded piece of paper, “Trick or treat,” he said, waiting for Dean to take it before walking away.
Mr. Morgenstern’s eyes filled with sorrow, “These walls are filled with so many memories…some of them painful,” he could see that Castiel didn’t really understand, and so he walked over and offered him his arm, “I think for you to understand, I really must show you,” Cas was hesitant to accept, and it was easy to see. Mr. Morgenstern was quick to reassure him, “It’s all right. There’s nothing to be afraid of.”
Abaddon shoved a finger in his face to cut him off, “Excuse me. You didn’t just say the word ‘years,’ did you?”
“Let me out of here!” Gabe shouted from the bag they had set to hang in front of the fireplace. It was getting hotter and hotter in the bag, and he just knew they were going to cook him alive as they killed Sammy.
“Not exactly…when they found out where I lived, they decided to have the party here. The school gym has asbestos, and if we don’t have it here, it would have to be at this really annoying, snobby boy who already hates me for some reason. I honestly just don’t want him to get what he wants, and this would be a great chance to make tons of friends, and introduce myself to the school. I would technically be saving the dance, and everyone was super excited to be able to have the Halloween dance in an actual haunted house, and—”
Dean gave a smile, still reveling over his victory the night before, “Fellas,” he greeted, “good morning.”
The devil walked over to where a woman was sleeping on a couch, “Sarah,” he said, shaking her awake.
“Hang him on a hook, and let me play with him,” Meg said, lustfully. He wasn’t her type, but it had been a while.
When Claire and Jack made their way back to the lab, they saw Crowley using a crowbar and attempting to pry the padlock off the treasure chest.
“Could I just say something here?” Dean slurred, “And get a little personal?” he waited until the ghosts eagerly nodded, big, innocent smiles on their faces as they waited for him to continue, “Well, I just got to tell you…you guys remind me of what it’s like to…hang out with the boys…” he started walking aimlessly around the nearly deserted bar, the three ghosts trailing behind him, weapons raised, “I mean, you are absolutely there for each other,” he swung around at the ghosts again, forcing them to hide their weapons once more, “I mean…you look life right in the face, and you say, ‘I’m a ghost! I don’t need you!’ You know what? I’m gonna tell that Miss Demon Lemon—Demo—De—I’m gonna tell that lady you aren’t going anywhere! It’s your house! You’re haunting it! Possession is nine-tenths of the law.”
“That’s none of your business, that’s who!” the man said, “Now, come on, get out of here! It’s way past your bedtimes.”
Dean couldn’t even blink, too terrified the love of his life would vanish if he closed his eyes for even half a second, “I—I thought I’d have a hundred things to say when I—” he cut himself off, “How?”
Claire and Dean shared a look over their pancakes, both a little creeped out, but neither one hesitating to eat. Jack was really an amazing chef for a dead person.
It was terrifying. The tunnel was black and covered with cobwebs, a strange wind blew around her, and it smelled like salt water. The tunnel must go far into the cliff the mansion was built on.
Dean and Claire tried not to look at them as they shoveled their food into their mouths. You could literally see the chewed meals go right through them. Dean just focused on his pie, while Claire tried not to vomit.
“Well, I don’t know! Cat’s got my tongue!” she and her sisters laughed. Nobody paid any attention to the cat hissing at the witches.
“We’re gonna take off, we’re gonna go to the lake. Just like last year, just us and the kids. The whole weekend, how’s that sound?”
“Who are you?!” Crowley shouted, as Abaddon hid behind him. Less of an ‘I’m scared’ move, and more of a ‘you’ll die first.’
“Dad!” he jumped at the voice of his daughter. He turned around to see both of his children standing at the top of the stairs with a very tall man and a very short man.
Lucifer scoffed, but released his nephew. Jack hurried over to the refrigerator where he had left the three meals. He piled the plates in his arms, one stacked with chocolate chip pancakes and strawberry syrup, with a whipped cream smiley face for Gabriel. Eggs, bacon, sausage, French toast, and coffee for Lucifer. And an egg white spinach omelet for Sam. The three ghosts immediately started tearing into the meals as Jack started to clean the kitchen.
“Yeah, but I never met her,” Claire answered, “My Papa said she left when I was a few months old. She didn’t die or anything, she just decided she didn’t want a family anymore,” Claire was nothing but ‘matter of fact’ it didn’t hurt her that she wasn’t wanted by a woman she had no memories of. She had found the letter her birth mother had left her Papa shortly after he died. It just said that this wasn’t the life she wanted, and she was leaving to find it. She would sign over all of her parental rights, just so long as Castiel would let her go, and with a heavy heart, he had, “Then Papa met Dad when I was about three. Dad used to love to talk about how he had fallen in love the second a tiny me kicked him in the shin. I dropped a toy, and he had had the audacity to pick it up for me. Papa couldn’t apologize enough, and Dad said he could apologize with a cup of coffee, and a slice of pie. Dad always said he fell in love with Papa over that one cup of coffee. So…I guess you don’t need to remember your family, but I do wish you could remember the people you loved. I do wonder why you can’t remember anything, though…”
“I wonder where this leads?” he said, taking a few steps into the passage. His eyes widened when he heard the bookcase rolling closed behind him. He quickly turned around but didn’t make it in time. He was trapped.
Dean frowned as Mr. Morgenstern stared over his shoulder. He turned around to see what he was staring at and found his husband. The green-eyed man bit back a scowl and told himself that Mr. Morgenstern was only curious. He motioned Cas over while saying, “This is my husband, Castiel.”
He grabbed the paper and both adults tried to blow out the flames, but it was too late. They had waited too long and it was in ashes now.
The boxes had been filled with toys. A miniature Ferris Wheel stood next to the window, overlooking the ocean. An electric train roamed the room on a track above their heads. There was so much more, that Jack couldn’t even begin to take stock of it all. This was a child’s dream playroom.
Jack floated over to him, and took him by the arm, “Come on, Dr. Winchester, you need this more than I do,” he said, floating the two of them over to the Lazarus. He pushed Dean inside, and shut the door behind him. His father had never been able to bring a ghost back to life, and he had died trying. Jack knew that this would work. It had to work. Otherwise, what would Claire do? How could she keep going without her father?
Dean and Claire shared a look. Those people were weird, but they were paying a very nice sum of money for this. They could put up with a bit of weirdness. The duo shrugged and went to grab a few of their bags before finally making their way inside the manor.
When Sarah came back downstairs to see Nick dancing with the blonde trollop he had invited into the house, she nearly screamed. Instead, she ordered them all out of the house.
Mrs. Bess Fitzgerald was looking out the large bay window in the living room, “It’s perfect!” she exclaimed, turning to Dean, “I think it’s just what we’ve been looking for!”
“Tis ready for tasting! One drop of this, and her life will be mine—I mean…ours,” she grabbed the wooden spoon and scooped up some of the potion. The three hags walked over to the young red-head, “All right, girl…open up your mouth.” Meg tipped Anna’s head back, and the potion went down her throat.
“Baby, I’m so sorry,” he mumbled before stepping on the gas. He and the psychic screamed as they slammed into the side of the greenhouse.
“You always make your costume,” her dad said absently as he blotted at the coffee remains on the papers he had been looking over while he ate.
Cas nearly vomited when Meg pulled her arm down, “My lucky rat tail! Just where I left it!” she put it in her mouth and began to nibble on the tail that was over three hundred years old.
One student, who Claire was pretty sure was the same one to snore, eagerly leaned forward, “You actually live there?”
Cain was crawling back into his grave, finally able to sleep now that both his and his wife’s murders had been avenged. Cas ran over to the brothers and Dean wrapped his arm around him.
“Sammy!” Cas screamed, getting up from the floor, but it was too late. They were gone. He heard Dean groaning behind him and ran over to help him off the floor, “Are you okay?”
Three glowing entities appeared outside of the front door, the shortest one laughing to himself, while holding on to a large donut, “Man, oh, man, haunted houses are a lot more fun when we make sure they’re actually haunted!” he proudly proclaimed, while the other two nodded in agreement. They were still laughing when their little nephew, Jack popped through the door.
Before they could say another word, they heard yelps of pain coming from the tunnel behind them. The three of them turned around to see the armchair coming down the ramp, into the lab, Crowley in the chair, looking even worse the second time around. Abaddon floated over to him, and barked out, “Crowley! What are you doing?! This is no time to shave!”
“I think my ears just popped,” he said, when Claire decided he looked normal. Before she could respond, they were both startled by a feminine, ghostly cackle. One that definitely didn’t belong to any of Jack’s uncles. They were shocked to see a ghost fly right over their heads and into the vault Jack had pointed out earlier.
Abaddon was growing increasingly anxious as she heard her cousin’s attorney, Azazel, continued to read Cain’s will.
“Wow,” Dean exclaimed, “Nice, very nice. Hey, Claire, how’d you like to eat like this every day at home?”
“Yeah, when’s dinner? Look at me, I’m wasting away to nothing,” Gabriel said, mournfully, turning to the side and showing his eternally protruding midsection. Ghosts were curious things. They could still eat if they wanted to. Some did so for a memory of life, like Sam. Some for something to do, like Lucifer. And some just loved to eat, like Gabriel. Jack didn’t care so much about eating, but he was in charge of making sure his uncles were fed and keeping the house sufficiently spooky while not a miserable place to live.
“We don’t get any smokes from you, we don’t get cash…what am I supposed to do with my afternoon?” he asked, angrily.
Lucifer led Cas up to the attic, and walked him over to the beautiful white suit, “This was to have been his wedding attire,” he explained, sadly.
“His name was Michael!” another man, this one short, wearing an apron, and carrying a tray of cookies, “Are you kids hungry? Does anybody want a cookie?”
Sam and Dean were following Cas to the Demoniac museum. He had changed back into his trench coat, but was wearing jeans and a comfy looking hoody underneath, “Legend has it that the bones of a hundred children are in these walls,” he said in his gravelly voice.
Claire was feeling the same way, but for different reasons. She rarely ever touched someone other than her father, and even that was rare. Both children felt an overwhelming surge of emotions, and Claire most likely would’ve started to cry if it weren’t for her dad walking into the kitchen.
Cas sighed, “Okay, let me get changed, they’ll never miss me." he walked up the stairs. Dean’s eyes followed him.
“No problem,” he grabbed the spatula waiting off to the side, and quickly scrambled the egg, before flipping some pancakes he had already been working on before Claire had walked in. He grabbed a crystal glass, and poured her a glass of orange juice.
“This,” Meg finished with a hiss. With that last word, Gabriel fell to the floor, crying in pain. His cries soon turned into the panicked sounds of a cat. The witches looked down in satisfaction at the sight before them.
Michael gave looked at Lucifer with love, “The truth had to be known for me to be released,” he looked at Dean, “he saved me.”
“Hey!” Gabriel appeared in front of him, looking insulted, “It’s not the chicken!” he said, defensively.
Roman gave a dignified nod, before moving to help the children to their seats, “The master was very pleased you could come on such short notice. Normally, we would not have called you here so abruptly, but we had no other choice.”
Claire, who was obviously fed up, turned on the camera, “Look, it’s the first day of school, I’m sure I’m gonna have homework, so would you please just leave?”
“Dad! Put me down! What are you doing, this is insane!” Dean ignored her, continuing to scramble through the hallway, “I can walk, you know?”
“I don’t care what they said, you are not demented,” Dean could slap himself. That was not a very tactful way to phrase that. Despite his career, he was never good at consoling her. Neither was Cas, but they at least had a more profound bond. Cas had always been able to at the very least, make her smile and forget for a few minutes what was bothering her. Dean and his daughter didn’t have a bad relationship, but it wasn’t the best right now, “You’re a picture of mental health.”
“You mean the Demoniac sisters?” he asked, “I know all about them, my mom used to run the museum, and I’m actually a direct descendant of Samandriel Novak, Gabriel, and Anna’s little brother.”
Dean ran towards the dining room, it was the best place to start. As he started down the hallway, he noticed a trunk hanging from the ceiling. There were screams coming from inside, “Claire! Jack!” he started to run to his children, but before he could get far, the suits of armor lining the halls began to move, climbing off their pedestals, and marching towards him with their weapons pointed.
Dean and the three ghosts had been at the karaoke bar ever since it had opened. Now, Dean had a very high alcohol tolerance, but after an entire day of drinking, he could safely say, he was absolutely wasted. The ghosts were enjoying watching him be absolutely terrible at karaoke.
“In the flesh!” Abaddon said proudly, before looking down at her ghostly body, “Well, in a couple of minutes.”
Jack thought for a moment, “I guess cause, when you’re a ghost, life doesn’t matter that much anymore. So, you forget. I don’t remember anyone or anything about when I was alive, but when you die, you keep your emotions, and there are some things you know, even if you don’t know why. It’s like with my uncles. I know that Lucifer and Gabriel were brothers, but not Sam. And I know that Sam is touchier with Gabriel, and closer to him, but none of us know why. Maybe they were like your Dad and Papa? And we know that we all lived in the manor, but it wasn’t only us. I remember being happy. I don’t know who loved me, but I do know that I was loved, and loved deeply. Even if that’s all I’ll ever remember or know, I’ll cherish it until the day I cross over.”
Dean gathered his son into his arms and carried him a few feet away from the mausoleum. He and Claire brushed the spiders off of the young boys whimpering body, “Are you okay?” Jack was crying, but he nodded. Dean pulled him into a tight hug, “You’re my brave little man.”
When they finally reached the double doors at the end of the hallway, Roman pushed them open, revealing an enormous dining room with a fireplace to match.
“Oh, you must stay for supper,” he flinched when Meg made a hungry noise at the suggestion as she caressed his throat.
Before Dean could answer, there was a knock at the door. They shared a look, shocked. The knock wasn’t coming from the study door, but the front. Who would come to Hunters Manor for a social call? “I’ll get it,” Claire said, leaving the room.
Abaddon scoffed at them, “Unfinished business? I have no unfinished business. I have my treasure, my mansion. I have everything! I’m. Just. Perfect,” she laughed, but was caught off by the beam of light that broke through her chest. She gasped, realizing what was happening, “Wait! Wait! I lied!” another beam of light, “I have unfinished business, lots of unfinished business! I-I’m not ready to cross over yet!” her lies weren’t working. She had already doomed herself, and as more and more beams of light broke through her body, she realized that she was truly hopeless, “Wait! You tricked me, you rotten little brats!” with a final scream, the light took over the last of her, before exploding into a waterfall of sparks, and light, as both the vial and treasure chest she had been holding went flying into the air.
“The guy is dead and he’s trying to get with my husband! And the house isn’t really for sale! Yes, I’m upset!”
“Lip of an owl with an herb that’s red. Then, three times, pluck a hair from thine head. Add a dash of pox, and a dead man’s toe,” she looked happily at her younger sisters, “Oh, a dead man’s toe! And make it a fresh one!”
Gabriel was forced to watch as his beloved sister was surrounded by the witches. They blocked her from his view, but he could hear them all taking deep breaths. He was helpless to save her.
“No,” Claire scoffed, “We’re not doing anything. You’re the one who keeps packing up my stuff, and moving me around the country. I mean, in two years, I have been to nine different schools. I’ve eaten in nine different cafeterias. I can’t even remember anyone’s name! For once, I would just like to be in one place long enough…to make a friend.”
“Hi Cain,” he greeted, sweetly. They prepared for the witch’s appearance. Cain walked Sam over to his open grave, assuring him he would be safe in there. Dean opened his bag and pulled out the baseball bat he had grabbed back at his house. Cas pulled out the salt and poured a circle around Cain’s grave, sealing Sam in the protective circle.
The three other ghosts groaned when she started crying, “Flesh flood alert,” Lucifer joked, making the other two laugh.
Jack groaned, slapping his hand to his forehead, “Oh, man,” he rushed over to the sink in the adjacent bathroom, “First impressions are so important and I managed to make her faint. I am such a jerk!” the little ghost pried the creaky faucet, knocking on the pipes until the rusty water finally cleared up. He grabbed the cleanest towel he could find and soaked it for a few seconds. He quickly floated back over to his new roommate and wrung out the towel over her face.
