Silence. It echoes. It is what it is. And what is that? For me? Shit for you but for me it’s… Nothing. I do not know how to spend it because I don’t want to spend it at all. Not like this. Pick this up, if you can, Doctor. You promised. I’m angry. I swallow it. I’m just broken now. Again. My jaw clenches. I need the anger. Please, don’t let it slip away again. Don’t let me feel the pain.
“I have been in life-threatening situations before. And I do not mock them anymore. Not after… After Serbia. But this was the first in a long while where you were with me. At the other side of that building. The balance of probability had the plan not worked, was fifty-fifty. Either you could have been killed, or me. But any fear for my safety was entirely obliterated the moment I realized what kind of danger you were in. John… The idea of harm coming to you scares me more than anything that could ever happen to me”.
When John announced that it wasn't just a little more, he'd blinked and stared, and blinked some more. How could that be? Surely, John had not signed up to be his permanent nurse, and in any case, he did not need one. In one month, two, he'd be able to rely fully on his body again, and would be out and about, as he always was. In any case, John would have a family soon. A little baby, aside from the wife he already had. John's place was with his family, and that family did not include Sherlock, the detective repeated endlessly in his mind. That much was clear for a while now, done, settled. He knew his place. Sherlock knew his place. Had learned it all too well after an almost-marriage-proposal and a bloody nose.
It was nothing more than a whisper but that’s exactly what made me shiver and you knew that. As it was, I blew a soft kiss pretending to be just fine and squeezed out a ‘See you soon, darling’ before I closed the phone and walked back to the kitchen red-faced to find that your sister had taken over the cooking. She smiled at me and I realised for the first time how happy she was that you found me. I smiled back in contentment and managed to put on a straight face when she winked. Then I walked passed her to the living room to play with our little one all the way wondering how much did I look forward to the after-dinner activities.
“So… If you tap three times, it means ‘I love you’”, he said, decidedly. Sherlock was eager to tap again in reply. Their very own Morse Code.
‘Thank you, John, that’s-…’ What exactly is it? I hide myself looking after an empty mug. ‘Very kind of you.’
‘As I think I have explained to you many times before; romantic entanglement while fulfilling for other people-’
‘Oh, I thought we were just hanging out.’ I sipped some tea. My tone clipped. Really, Watson, is that all you can do? You know exactly why I took the drugs. You know why I destroyed myself.
“Do you want to tell me why?”, John tried, rubbing his palm up and down Sherlock’s spine. He could feel each vertebra, a series of knuckles poking through the skin.
Stop it, Holmes. You’re just stupid. You know how you’ll always lose him. You’ve lost him countless of times. Just accept it. Accept it.
‘Are you alright now?’ The concern is back and I focus my gaze to yours without avoiding any show of emotion. You’re frowning and I lean just a tad to kiss the taut muscles. You let them be afterwards.
‘There’s something… I wanted to say…’ You swallowed and I tangled our fingers together. I was particularly courageous today. We were so unbelievably close. All this time we’ve been in a silent agreement about what we started together a few months earlier. But now… It was time… I could feel your breath on my lips and my encouraging smile was so natural that I didn’t even notice I was doing it.
… It will become a mantra eventually, I believe. You should know. You already know. You think you made it clear that because she died, we’re over. Your promise is over even if it was a promise of forever. You think you have been relieved from that duty. That vow. And it hurts like hell.
‘Well, now you do.’ Angry. Yes. Yet again. Dark tone. Yes. See it. Feel it, John, because I’m angry with you. You made me like that.
“Then… Before… There were things inside me which I thought I was not allowed to share, or even feel”, Sherlock murmured. John saw the roots through the pale skin, tangled and mingling with his veins.
But if any of you are bothered by anything, feel the tags and warning don't cover everything or that our boys' relationship is not healthy by the end of this, then PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE TELL ME. I want this to be a healthy relationship by the end so it matters a lot to me.
Sherlock shoots him a murderous glance. They are not supposed to talk about all that. That can only mean John is being serious, and the smile on his lips now is not the 'I'm happy' smile, but the 'snap out of it or I'll chin you', smile. Sherlock doesn't like the latter, so he slowly unfolds his body, sitting properly onto the chair. As properly as he can anyway. His expression must have been so miserable that John laughed. Truly laughed this time, crinkling eyes and thrown back head and all. John looks beautiful when he laughs like that. Short and sweet, vibrant pizzicato.
“Then, so what”, John shrugged with a smile. But Sherlock’s expression was sour, his lips pressed into a thin line. “Sherlock… Do you want to say it?”
I was deadpanned. Childishly, I brought my legs up the seat to curl at my chest. My eyes were almost hurting by looking at you; wide. That couldn’t be true. It shouldn’t and must certainly not be true. Yet, you gave me a once over look with your eyes gleaming and I knew. That sentiment I had grown to understand, to see and realise and make myself believe that it truly was there. You were being affectionate, but she couldn’t be like me at all. She was only your-
"Look at me. Sherlock". The doctor's voice was gentler than he would have ever expected. Jaw muscles working, he raises his eyes. John's are firm, but they are not angry. If anything, they hpld regret. "Look at me. I've been an idiot. But I want to fix this. Okay?"
He recognized Sherlock’s love when he saw it -or he hoped he did, more often than not. It was often subtle enough to miss, and Sherlock himself often presented it as an afterthought, or something selfish. But John knew better; what lived inside Sherlock was not a difficulty to accept his humanity for pride’s sake, or for the Work’s sake. Sherlock was not incapable of love; for crying out loud, he flushed and preened every time John told him he loved him, or called him love or dear or sweetheart, but never dared return any such word back. Sherlock had been told that he was incapable, as he had been told that he was many other things he wasn’t. And he had taken it to heart and turned it both into pain for himself and an impenetrable wall to keep others out.
died and we fell right into hell. Wasn’t your fault, really. I should have known. Everything’s fucked up, isn’t it?
‘I know. Neither am I.’ It’s a little consolation really. I know there’s not a ‘mind’ to be changed. The decision was taken years ago. We just waited patiently to finally officiate it. Still, my mind and heart feel more at ease with those words coming out of your lips, formed vowels and consonants, clear and true. Spoken. Will the doubts ever go away? Look at me, I’m pathetic. More than five years have passed since our first kiss and I’m still losing myself over fleeting doubts that you’d leave me, you won’t want me anymore. That’s absurd. You deserve so much more than that. I need to have faith in you.
Oh, so you’ve crossed that off the list now? Fire. Heat. Anger. Yes. That accursed name. Brought it back. Unfortunate subject to talk about. The one that I can’t actually let that anger show. I must be the better man again, mustn’t I?
‘Oh, for God’s sakes, I don’t text her back.’ Yes. Anger. Just for a moment, I thought you were going to see us as we were, see her as she is and remember… Remember your promise. But you didn’t. Obviously. As expected. How stupid of me. And now you’re giggling and telling me what to do. I don’t want to do anything. Only thing I can do is fix my eyes on you, let the anger fall down and show you once again what I feel with the hope you’ll get it. You won’t. So, I am not about to do it. Even though, I might be doing it unconsciously because I do, in fact, look at you with pain.
Sherlock groaned and pressed his lips onto John’s nape. John’s hair there was matted with sweat. Sherlock nuzzled, breathing in the unique combination of musk, tea, wool, and cheap white soap. His heart was doing weird things in his chest.
‘Forgive me, but you are doing yourself a disservice. I’ve known many people in this world, but made few friends and I can safely say-’
I woke up the next day in our bed -no, your bed, into which I had forced my way in so many sleepless nights. There was fresh tea on the bedside table. I didn’t deserve to be here. Not even for a moment. I deserved your care and affections much less. Yet, you have never said no or tried to stop me. You never said anything. Especially on those nights. I fluttered my eyelids and you were there, looking at me with that small smile you always managed on the cold mornings.
‘Seriously, we’re not gonna talk about this?’ Jesus, are you playing with your luck? Is this your type of game with me?
“What time do we have to be at the Yard?”, John’s voice reached him as if through bare, dry branches; hoarse and with gaps in the voicing, like Morse code.
Hoarse voice. Just a tad. Always brings me down. You mean it. You mean it and I’m the idiot now. No, wait. I deserve to be angry about it. You promised. I thought I won’t lose you again but I did. Because you pushed me away after everything and I-
‘Come on. Got to show you something!’ I grabbed you by the wrist leading you out of the building and, after some walking, out of the small city. You were looking at me like I was going crazy but you hadn’t objected up to know. We both enjoyed the comfortable silence that was settling between us when we felt the grass under our feet and I could see your sulking for not returning home was long gone. It seemed to me that in the end this place had come into your liking and I smiled realising I was still holding your hand and you hadn’t pulled away.
‘Yes, yes.’ Impatient. You are so far away. ‘Sorry, wasn’t-… thinking about Rosie.’ Liar. Liar. Liar. Shut up. Her name almost leaves a taste in my mouth. Hope. The taste of hope. She’s the reason we started what now is being destroyed little by little. I’m in pieces. No dignity left. No strength. I don’t care. There’s only last thing to do.
You just looked at me incredulously. Questions were formed and deformed in your head and I could see it. How could I risk it all for nothing? How could I break my promise to you? I had risked my life one more time today without you knowing and I returned home with blood in my hands and clothes. I had risked my life by choice and didn’t let you protect me because I was afraid. I was afraid you’d get hurt. I was afraid you wouldn’t allow me to finish this. The ground seemed to come closer and before I knew it I was on my knees in front of you. Crying.
Silence stretched over them, punctured by the pitter-patter of rain as it met with the windows and the old walls of 221B.
Something cracked and I felt your steady palms on my shoulders. There was pain at my knees. I must have collapsed to the floor and you supported me. I looked into your eyes and the rage almost woke once more but you leaned encouragingly close whispering for me to let go and that it was okay. How could you even say that? No! If I was capable to hold myself conscious until I came to our flat -your flat- every time, then I could damn well keep my senses through this and stop hurting you.
"Can't get comfortable", Sherlock retorts snappishly, and tries to shift, only to end up with a leg dangling off the constricted space. He admits defeat with a whined growl.
“John”, Sherlock rebuked softly, but John would not let him go, even though he must have turned an unflattering crimson. Consulting tomato.
John did with no further hesitation. He crawled close enough that they were chest to chest, with his head buried in Sherlock’s neck. The hand with which Sherlock was holding the covers released its grip, and the blankets landed atop and about them with a sigh. Sherlock’s arm crept beneath the layers of fabric again and searched for the indentation of John’s waist, where it curled, pulling his man even closer to him.
I feel like I’m nothing. No one. Not someone that matters, anyway. There are miles between us. There is no us. I feel like shit. I feel the need to crush myself. To finally, let the despair take over and consume me. My mind goes to dark alleys. A cigarette. The sweet fogginess of the needle. You should be happy. I should help you be happy. But you clearly are not. I mistake it as my fragile sentimental heart playing tricks. I block all signs, I even go as far as to delete them. Whole conversations lost. I persuade myself that you are happy with her. This is what you always wanted. This is how I should go on.
Back when you first moved in with me, there were times I wish you would talk to me instead of letting me guess the things you wanted to say. As the time passed I started to recognise what was bothering you each time. I knew when you were suffering, I knew when you were haunted by the past. I knew when you needed me, I knew when you were trying to hide your screams into your pillows. There were nights I lay in bed looking up the ceiling wishing it didn’t separate us. There were nights I could hear your muffled cries and I had memorised the sounds of your bed when you were dreaming. There were things you said but you said them too quietly for me to hear. Your words were never meant for me. Your love was never meant for me. I just happened to pass by.
The first time John had said ‘I love you’, Sherlock let the empty teacup he was holding drop to the floor and shatter. He did not even wince at the sound of it smashing. He only blinked, slowly, then rapidly, eyelids fluttering like the wings of an indecisive moth which debating when to land.
“You know you can tell me anyway you choose, right? Like I told you… I feel you tell me with everything you do, and it counts. But if you want a specific thing to mean that, to mean I love you between us, and only the two of us will know, then go ahead”
Sherlock pushed and prodded John until he could make him turn around. He curled around him, an effectively taller big spoon, and mouthed at John’s ear. John hummed.
Anyway, I was scared I’d do her harm. I was drunk like so many other nights. My left hand was useless, I couldn’t even hold another glass with it. Desperate for more I had gone to a bar and they shoved me out just when I was about to finish their scotch supplies for good. I had left her home alone. Better alone than with me. I was a moving killing machine. You opened the door and I could see it. I could just see it in your eyes. You knew. You understood. Like always. It flared up at me. I was more angry than afraid now of what I could do. How could you always know? How come I never knew and always was blamed for it? How could you do this? How could you look me with understanding and care when I was an alcoholic freak with PTSD?
In truth, John is the one who mostly works to make the blanket fort, because Sherlock cannot carry much more than the pillows. The blankets at its base are heavy. John sets them up between their armchairs, in front of the fireplace. Sherlock mainly watches. But he has to admit he is happy to buzz around John, like a curious bee drawn to the nectar of a new type of flower. It is not that he and John did not do things together before. They would play Cluedo, and watch telly, and solve crosswords, even -that was dull-, and solved cases, of course. But a blanket fort is... different. It is cozy, and homely, and childish. It is something that makes him want to share things with John, but all are things he is not allowed to share -like he and Redbeard would play when he was little, or what his dreams used to be, or how he has always been curious if lips truly tasted like honey.
It's been a month since John told him he would stay. He has not retracted that -decision? promise?- so far. Every morning he greets Sherlock with a smile and a steaming cup of tea. Every night he tucks him in, and turns off the light -only after making sure the next-morning-pills are seated dutifully on a napkin, with a glass of cool water nearby, all arranged on the nightstand, neat, ready. During the first days after he had been released from the hospital (in truth, from the ICU, he had been stubbornly and vehemently unwilling to spend a single extra night there), John would take care of his surgery stitches too, administer the heavier painkillers, occasionally some morphine, to let Sherlock get, at least a couple hours' sleep. The pain had been horrible, then. Caused him to wake up in the middle of the night, cold sweat and fluttering heart more often than was tolerable. John had started sleeping in a chair beside his bed, until the nightmares, and the trauma, eased away.
of the two of us need comfort? How could you be the one entitled to it? Why do you let me be the stronger one when I am clearly not? When you owe me so many apologies and I have begged for a forgiveness I didn’t even know I needed to obtain?
John turns to look at him, then, shifting a little to lie on his side and prop his head on his elbow. Sherlock is annoyed, but not at all surprised, to find his breath catching. It is not the first, or the last time, when John is this close.
They had entered that territory slowly, but when its borders were crossed, neither could say. They just found themselves with the knowledge one morning like any other, Sherlock whining about lack of cases and John trying not to burn his fingers in the toaster while he pretended to ignore the tantrum. But that knowledge had been incubating in their hearts for a while. And when they looked into each other’s eyes and saw they both knew, and they were on the same page, they grasped it, and tended to it so that it would grow more. Grow into a bridge, a path out of the mess their lives had become before they found their way to each other.
‘It’s okay to be nervous, you know.’ The whisper is so tender that my heart skips a bit and I feel like sweating.
John looked at him and waited. Sherlock wondered how much longer until John’s patience grew thin, until the veil of infatuation and love hormones lifted. “It is about yesterday”
You never mind that I don’t drive. In fact, you never mind how many things I don’t do or don’t like to do that are normal and expected. That’s a quality I grew to worship about you, although it took me some time to realise how much you have to endure from me. Before you, I didn’t even know how to recognise that something I’ve done was ‘not good’. I always tried to be better for you but even if you shouted at me, you never really meant it. You always try to ignore the worst in me, while I try to improve them but you never demanded or asked me to do it and that let me free to realise for myself. Still, even after years, you insist on driving every single time. I can probably deduce that you don’t want to risk me driving for more than ten minutes, in case I get bored and let my head wander to cases or deductions or my mind palace and in that case, you’re probably right, I shouldn’t be driving at all.
His eyes were moving frantically behind closed eyelids. He was dreaming. But it wasn’t one of the normal dreams. This was different. He was running in a field laughing childishly with arms outstretched touching the edges of the grass and flowers. He didn’t feel like his usual self, he was short and his feet so small. He was a child. Happy giggles followed him and he turned his head smiling to a little shorter child behind him trying to run past him laughing with a smile he knew so well. He woke up with a start. It wasn’t a nightmare but it wasn’t a dream either. He stayed still sitting up to control his breathing forgetting all about the man next to him. He only remembered when strong hands reached for him and tangled around him. He relaxed completely in the embrace. There was a quiet voice near his ear.
John’s shoulders judder involuntarily as he’s wracked by a shanking shiver, his skin tingling all over. He’s slightly breathless when he says, “Good God.”
Sherlock watches, rapt, as he writhes against the duvet, cock twitching each time John strokes over his prostate. John reaches for Sherlock’s right hand which is dry and catching against his foreskin in a way that must be chafing him.
Adores the way Sherlock bends his knees and wraps his arms around John’s waist and kisses him. Adores the way Sherlock no longer has to do any calculations before he interacts with John. No longer has to act any certain way, adhering to someone else’s prescriptive rulebook, to get what he wants and needs.
Sherlock held up his hand and waited, listening to John’s steps on the gravel and the crackle of sticks breaking underfoot as he made his way through the wood. Before he went back inside he sent John a text.
John wrapped one arm around my waist and draped himself over my back, the fingers of his other hand, sliding down, down over the entrance to my body. His clothes rubbed against my skin and I felt my nakedness acutely. I tipped my head back until I felt his lips against my ear.
“Oh,” he exclaimed, with some dismay and annoyance. He’d planned for them to taste each one, to compare the subtle flavours and colours. He’d planned to teach them about how different nectar sources affected the taste of the honey. In fact there was a whole anecdote he had prepared based on Charlie’s question about why the hives smelled bad that included a rather interesting bit about honeys that could harm humans. But now the blackberry honey bowl was almost empty and Charlie had wrapped her palms around her cup and was blowing across the surface, the steam curling up towards her antennae in a silky white stream. Sherlock slumped back in his seat, feeling a bit out of sorts, a bit grumbly about the missed opportunity, and sipped his too hot tea too fast so that it scalded the top of his mouth.
“By all means,” he whispers back, arching up for one last lingering kiss that makes all your joints turn to jelly with its unexpected sweetness. Once he releases you and you’ve gathered your wits about you once more, you turn your attention back to where it’s most wanted.
John needs Sherlock to tell him, but senses that Sherlock isn’t ready yet. He obfuscates, John can see him coming up with lies, his eyes darting away when John has asked him directly. It makes John ache to see it.
Just when I was about to beg John for something, anything, he pulled his fingers almost completely out of me and slowly, added a third.
“In the mud room,” Sherlock said, slouching forward, a bone-deep exhaustion mantling him, his eyes ponderously heavy, his ears buzzing.
“Dad lets me use google if I finish all my homework. Well, and when Dad’s not too tired to supervise,” Charlotte said, rolling her eyes as if this happened nearly too frequently for her liking. “I try and draw pictures so I’ll remember.”
At where two drops of precome quiver, shining, on his stomach and he swallows thickly, meeting the dark heat of John’s gaze.
With his fingers still rubbing and gently pinching his nipples, wracking Sherlock with prickling sensation, John leans forward, cock shoved as deep as it can go, balls resting against Sherlock’s forehead, and takes Sherlock’s cock tip in his mouth. Surprised, Sherlock is unable to stem the tidal wave that crashes through him and his cock jerks and spills inside John’s mouth.
“Come here,” he said, quietly, and, dropping the towel that I had been using to dry my hair, I obeyed.
“Well, far be it from me to dissuade you from anything you want to do,” John says. “What would I do?”
Sherlock doesn’t pay him any mind though and runs the flannel over his ankles, wiping away the traces of mud that had splattered onto his skin.
The scotch, a cinder burning in the back of his throat, Sherlock’s voice, scuffed velvet in his ears, contentment licking warm and bright inside his chest, John had felt happy, simply happy, for the first time in months.
- shirt, our foreheads digging into each other, like we could exorcise it from each other if we just got it over quick enough.
John loves the way Sherlock’s scent changes as he becomes more and more aroused, the hot coppery sear of his sweat and musk overpowering the clean soapy smell of his shower. Sherlock’s lips are slick as they move against John’s, kissing him deeply, kissing him desperately, while John touches him, slowly.
Sherlock nods, scooting towards the edge of the bed. John turns on the bedside lamp and together they begin to dress.
“It’s never been like that for me before,” John admits, tilting his head up. Sherlock has turned off the light at some point and pulled the duvet over them. He can't quite make out Sherlock's face in the dark.
When the waiter cleared his throat a few minutes later we parted slowly, our eyes fluttering open, and we shared a giddy kiss-drunk smile between us before turning to face him.
He scoots up the bed to lie back against your pillows, one arm tucked behind his head, watching with amused interest as you wriggle out of your shirt and trousers.
Sherlock works the flat of his tongue over John’s opening. Holding John in place even as he tries to push back. Two big handfuls gripping mercilessly hard. Fingers digging down into bone.
“I misjudged you,” Evan said, their hands tucked in their jean pockets. “I made some assumptions about you based on rumours I had heard and I pressured you out of my own frustration with the case. I’d like a second chance to start over with you, if that’s all right.”
“I’m sorry,” John says. Scrubbing a hand down his face. Jesus, he’s on edge. “Really, Har, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have assumed.”
tools for the job. These are much more appropriate for prostate stimulation. You can thank me by kindly accompanying me to my solicitor’s office on Monday to have our deed notarized.”
Charlotte nodded, her brown eyes studiously trained on the bee. She blinked, almost going a bit cross eyed in her eagerness.
“All right,” Sherlock says slowly, finishing up the tea and bringing John his mug a few minutes later. Sherlock takes his seat in the chair across from John and blows across the top of his cup, sending steam billowing.
Does he notice? you wonder as Bill joins you for post-dinner cocktails, her and John laughing and telling war stories. Does he see the pile of medical journals on his nightstand and the Google searches for locums hiring GPs and the twice weekly date at the racquetball club with Stamford? Does he see the way he sleeps through more nights than not?
“I’m just replacing some baseboards and doing a mite test. Need to weigh the hives and give the lite ones syrup. Check to see if any are thinking of swarming. Nothing too hard today.”
“And is that how pollination happens?” Charlotte asked, her eyes widening as if she finally understood something she’d been thinking about.
Sherlock rolls his eyes and crowds John backwards until his knees hit the edge of the bed and he sits down hard. Sherlock drops into a crouch and begins untying John’s laces. John starts work on his own shirt feeling if not fully, at least partially, mollified.
Sherlock falls back into his seat, defeated, his eyes wild. “Why are you doing this? You have known me for a few months. We’ve been fucking for a week. You’re really willing to die for me?”
“What would I be doing if there were two of me in the room? What would you imagine the other me to be doing while you were busy sucking one of me off?”
“My neighbor, John, his daughter, she's transgender, and she reminds me a little of myself. She’s very intelligent, very tenacious. Interacting with her and seeing how she is loved and accepted by her family, it feels like it's healing something in me. Something I thought was maybe irreparable.”
Sherlock scrunched up his nose at the word choice. “‘Clean’ is a bit stigmatizing. Suggests that at some point I was dirty. I prefer to say ‘been in recovery’ instead.”
John obeys, spreading his knees on the mattress. The wood is smooth and chilled against his palms. The warmth from the room washes over him in counterpoint, supple waves of heat on his flushed skin.
And then, just as the violins were singing so sweetly around me, John slipped his fingers back inside me, his come leaking out of my loose hole, and crooked them. He pumped and sucked and swallowed around me and within seconds I was coming down his throat.
“It’s our anniversary soon,” he murmured, his mouth moving down my throat to nibble at my clavicle. I arched into him and made an incoherent sound.
Sherlock holds up the instrument, which looks like a thin black wand. “This is called a body contact cable. It’s connected to the violet wand, which is plugged into the wall just there.” John follows the length of tubing with his eyes as Sherlock explains. He watches as Sherlock reaches over and turns on the thicker black instrument that the cable is connected to. A low hum fills the air. “When this is in contact with my body, my touch is electrified.”
“After I got back from the war I avoided everything for a long time. I was injured and living with my parents and working for my dad. I couldn’t practice medicine anymore. I was lost. Then I met someone online. I had been lurking on London Daddy message board sites for a while, just watching and learning. Getting acquainted with the language and the customs. And one night I messaged someone and we met up. The rest is history. How about you?”
It’s almost normal now, isn’t it? How gazes skitter away from you when your eyes meet. How despite the fact that you wear the uniform, expensive black suit trousers and a tailored white button down cut from fine French linen, you are still a man apart. You will never be able to tuck into your fish and chips and mushy peas with the blokes at the end of the bar. You will never be able to chat up the two girls sipping martinis by the window. You will never be the type meeting a date for a drink before a show.
“Arrrgh,” he moaned, scrubbing frantically at his lips with the back of his hand, all while trying to push Quinn off his chest with the other.
“That’s it,” he says. Their foreheads pressed together. “That’s it Sherlock. Come for me. Come for me, my love. Oh, let me see. Let me see—“
Sherlock makes a helpless noise and John, wanting to hear it again, chases him back, one hand flat against the hot plane of Sherlock’s chest, one hand on the hard cut of his hip, turning him, pushing him, until Sherlock is pressed flat against the wall to their left.
John groans, seeing it, behind his eyelids: Sherlock’s tight hole between his thighs, laid out at John’s feet while his accountants went over the quarters numbers none the wiser. A plug snugged inside. Cock in a ring. John’s cock throbs inside the tight circle of Sherlock’s spit slick hand and John feels heat gathering in his thighs and hips, radiating brightly out to tingle in fingers and toes, erasing the dull pain in his knees as he kneels on the cold tile floor.
He starts at the top of John’s head and then pushes them out, dragging against John’s scalp, slow, slow.
When Sherlock breaks away, the skin around his mouth is pink and his lips are plum dark and swollen. His eyes, as they look into John’s, are soft and open. John’s heart splits down a seam, growing bigger with everything he feels for Sherlock.
When John gets to the corner he keeps running, desperately scanning the dark street. Sherlock isn’t on the pavement. John doesn’t see him in any of the cabs stopped at the red light.
The lush bow of his lips stretches out around him as Sherlock returns his fingers to John’s hole, plunging deep. John presses the inside of his thighs to Sherlock’s ears, digs his heels into his back, and bucks up, helpless. The heat pounds back and gathers in his navel, throbbing out through him. John can’t speak to warn him. He doesn’t want it to be over, but it feels too good. His mouth is sapped, his throat parched, closed against speech. Sherlock takes him deep and smears John against the back of his throat, the tight channel clenching around him. But then he’s gone, pulled up and off, and John is left panting, sticky and frustrated, his hands fisted in the sheets at his sides.
“I want to fuck your mouth properly,” John says, moving a thumb over Sherlock’s already swollen lips. Sherlock can’t help but moan at this request. He wants it so badly he can’t speak. “How would you like that, Sherlock?”
The knot of his towel digs uncomfortably into your stomach and his toes are cold where they’re touching yours. Your mouth is starting to go numb and taste of mint too and his hair is wet and tacky in the cup of your palm and the combined heat of his body and the trapped sunlight of an attic flat in August are making you sticky with sweat and you don’t care a wit. You don’t want this night to ever, ever end.
I’m grateful, for instance, that I can reach out and caress the back of John Watson’s hand as he lightly fingers the line of my cock and say, with full certainty of the reaction it is going to get, “No. It was face-fucking, in fact,” and watch as his mouth drops open and his eyes sharpen and blacken simultaneously and his cheeks grow red, and, I know from experience, would feel hot if I reached out and pressed my fingertips there.
He recognized the toll that effort took. The way John had wistfully stared out the window at Sherlock’s house, imagining a life unlike his own and longing for it, was the way Sherlock had felt about Zoe and Ellen when he’d first become friends with them. And the way that John had confessed his insecurities, Sherlock had seen himself there as well. Committing to doing something new meant committing to being terrible at it at first. It was a mortifying ordeal, allowing yourself to be seen struggling. Especially in the context of being men. Well, cisgender white men, Sherlock reminded himself. It was lonely. It had a cost. And there was no guidebook.
Sherlock nodded, understanding. Not a pensioner, no kids. “I ran my previous life into the ground.” His throat clutched at the blunt edge of that admission. “Needed a fresh start, I suppose.”
Sherlock’s bedroom voice. Bedroom eyes. John feels like he is scrabbling for purchase on a smooth cliff face.
“I’m sorry you’re carrying that,” John said, his eyes finding Sherlock’s again. “Do the others know?”
About the months he spent hobbling around London with his cane and his gun tucked like a promise in the bottom drawer of his desk?
“Sherlock.” John lays a hand on Sherlock’s thigh and shakes his head. He doesn’t like the line Sherlock’s taking. “A life on the run is no life.” Or at least not one John wants.
Sherlock chews, his eyes fixing onto the ceiling. John watches as his attention focuses, something passing through his mind. John waits for Sherlock to return his gaze once more to him before he asks, “What are you thinking about?”
After ten spanks, John pauses, letting Sherlock wilt against him, getting his breath back, and takes up the bottle of almond oil. Getting his fingers slick he returns them to Sherlock’s arse, slipping them between the reddened cheeks and rubbing them straight down the centre.
Sherlock’s touch is light as he draws down John’s cheeks and traces along the edge of his jaw, scratching through the short bristly hair.
“Sherlock,” he gasped, as I closed my hand around him. Maybe John was feeling the way that pleasure could be a keen edge, a cutting edge, a razor, a knife.
John cocks his head at Sherlock, his eyebrows raised. “A man who moves through this world like a ghost with no ties, but he trusted you enough to have intimate knowledge of his associates and their actions? I think you’re underestimating just how much you meant to him.”
It deepens, this thing, this ineluctable thing you’re sharing, there in the night. That vine of light snaking through you takes root in the dark and shatters it, glowing with a soft radiance between you.
Sherlock scowls. “Aortic aneurysm. Complete coincidence. The girlfriend had nothing to do with it. And do you know the most infuriating part?”
“Tea?” he asks, leaving John’s jumper rumpled up around his nipples as he wheels a hand at the mismatched chairs in front of the fireplace. The one John uses has a moving box overflowing with papers sitting on it. “Just put that anywhere.”
“You should bring Charlie by sometime,” Sherlock said, standing. “I can introduce her to the bees. Properly.”
in which the murders prove to be delayed acts of revenge carried out against the agents of a tyrannical government in a foreign land. But there are a lot of other things that have kept “Wisteria Lodge” out of the winners’ circle. For one thing, Doyle’s racism and xenophobia are more on display in this story than in many others; the “grotesque” elements of the case, in the canon story, derive largely from the exotic origins of the people involved in it, from the Tiger of San Pedro to the unnamed cook, who is presented as a kind of subhuman monster (gigantic in size, savagely violent, and unable to speak except in “grunts”). For another, Holmes is peripheral to the investigation; the only thing you can really say he accomplishes is the rescue of the governess, and even that is done by one of his agents. And of course, as in “Greek Interpreter,” the punishment of the miscreants is delayed.
grief is not pleasurable and it doesn’t look or sound like what viewers are used to. Martin Freeman, during Mary Morstan’s death scene in “The Six Thatchers,” tried to keep it real–and got mocked by fans for failing to follow convention. Speaking of Freeman, let me say that the effectiveness of his performance of in “The Reichenbach Fall” depends largely on the fact that John, in general, suppresses his emotions. Because he actually witnesses the “death,” John’s initial reaction is shock and disbelief, and that’s performed pretty full-bore. John’s actual grief, on the other hand, is repressed, so that we can
It gets worse from there; at a military hospital he gets enteric fever (also known as typhoid fever, which is caused by salmonella…even if typhoid fever doesn’t kill you, it makes you wish you were dead) and then finally sent to stagnate in London. Watson doesn’t have a lot of reasons to love the British Army or to be loyal to it.
But when Watson says “death is always with us,” that opens things up on a lot of levels. In one sense, it’s a universal truth: we’re all mortal, death is a certainty for everyone. Implied, of course, is a message to Holmes: you’re mortal too, and if you don’t start taking better care of your body you’re going to destroy it. But I think it also has a personal meaning, as in: death is always with
Maria Gibson’s character in the ACD story never gets beyond the Hot-Blooded Latina stereotype–of course she’s crazy! she’s from the tropics!–and neither Paul nor the production team is at all interested in complicating that:
…they’re milking it. I tell you, this old-school heritage-TV low-budget Dark Days of the HIV Epidemic series was 1000% more comfortable with Holmes/Watson intimacy than some very fancy hip twenty-first century adaptations I could…but no. No, I will rise above. I will not go there.
; but Brett will always be Holmes in my heart. Brett and Burke were the team that inspired my first ever Holmes/Watson fanfic, “
Anyway, my point is that this episode really brings home how important Brett was to this adaptation. When he’s on screen, it’s riveting. But there are large swathes of this episode devoted to the Barclay/Wood/Devoy backstory–as there more or less have to be–and it’s just really hard to care that much for that long about it. This is where you really feel the comparative inadequacy of the production values. Even on a good day, Granada Holmes is just a festival of crazy wigs and unconvincing facial hair; “The Crooked Man” is full of period touches and local color, none of it particularly compelling from a verisimilitude point of view. At a certain point you wonder whether it wouldn’t have been better just not to visualize Wood’s backstory and just stay in the room with Henry Wood’s narration. But then, when you do go back to the room and Henry Wood’s narration, it doesn’t really help.
When they part company at Irene Adler’s house, the King offers Holmes his hand to shake. No doubt for the King this is a great moment of magnanimous condescension. Holmes turns and walks away from it; Watson shakes it.
* Though Holmes is the one to put the explanation together in the end, he has very little practical impact. His and Watson’s intervention is actually counterproductive; they very nearly cock-up a perfectly good escape plan that had already been concocted between Alice and her fiance with the help of Mrs. Toller. They really have two main functions in this story: 1) punish the villain (inadvertently and indirectly; like Roylott, Rucastle is attacked during all the confusion by the animal he’s weaponized) and 2) protect the detective (i.e., Violet). Like I said: Lestrade.
The strategy Holmes eventually decides to pursue–have Watson write down Turner’s dictated confession, get him to sign it, and then keep it in reserve in case McCarthy is convicted–is, from a legal point of view, unbelievably risky. Especially if Turner is dead, there’s no guarantee they could establish the authenticity of that confession to anyone’s satisfaction. Watson is worthless as a witness; he’s too close to Holmes. The document is in Watson’s handwriting and it would be easy enough to forge a signature. If Holmes waits until McCarthy is actually
…I was staring at him thinking, I know I’ve seen him before…is that Roger Rees? No, that’s not Roger Rees…but it’s SOME kind of British period adaptation of some classic…
There’s only one interesting question raised for me by “The Last Vampyre,” which is: How did this show get
We can never read this story the way Doyle’s original fans did. We all know he came back and we all trust that he’s coming back. So the story can never have the impact on us that Doyle wanted it to have.
In the canon story, Holmes makes Watson a little speech about how dangerous and reckless this was and how sorry he is to have exposed him to all this danger. Watson treasures this moment because, he says, “I had never seen so much of his heart before.” As different as the adaptation is, this moment instantly captures the effect Doyle was striving for here. The first name tells you: this is a breakthrough moment. What’s happening here, and the visuals keep reminding us, is that they are re-playing the “Empty House” reunion scene, with the roles reversed and with a completely different kind of emotion from Holmes. In the reunion scene, Holmes also reaches out for Watson; but here, instead of saying, “I’ve come back to comfort you,” the same gesture says, “For the love of God, comfort me.” In “Empty House,” it’s Holmes bringing Watson around after his faint; here, it’s Watson trying to drag Holmes back to the land of the living. In “Empty House,” it’s Watson who has to grab onto Holmes to reassure himself that he’s real; here, it’s Holmes clinging to Watson for dear life:
interiority. I 100% applaud this decision. It is a golden opportunity for character development, and for us to learn more about emotions that Holmes will never verbalize. Good for you, Gary, for seizing it.
. This was a team that embraced the Great Partnership warmly and consistently and strove to center it in as many episodes as possible. This was a team that understood how to build incrementally and how to make the minutiae matter. And whether we’re talking about Brett/Burke or Brett/Hardwicke, I think we can say that here was a Holmes/Watson team uniquely prepared to squeeze ALL the glory out of the Garridebs Moment. Gary Hopkins even wrote a really pretty decent script which crosses the poorly-made “Garridebs” with the lamentably weak “Mazarin Stone” and comes out with something that’s actually better than either of the individual stories, and which really replicates pretty well the mixture of comedy and tragedy that Watson identifies as the keynote for “Three Garridebs.” They had the tools, they had the talent, and they certainly had the inclination to go for broke on “Garridebs” and leave the viewer weeping on the floor.
Honestly, I feel like the farther I get into this series the more I understand what’s going on in Mark Gatiss’s brain. I’m not sure I like it; but it does seem to me as if both the “Shoscombe Old Place” and “Frances Carfax” episodes of this series contribute significantly to “The Abominable Bride,” just as (I believe)
Look, I like a good fanfic as much as the next woman, and one must acknowledge that “Greek Interpreter” is not an easy story to pad out to an hour. What happens on the train isn’t even all bad. Holmes & Holmes get to put their deduction skills to some practical use by identifying the baddies, and Mycroft gets to do something clever and daring. I also like the little touch where Holmes lets Latimer know who he’s dealing with not by introducing himself, but by using Watson’s name–because they’re now so inseparable in the public eye that to mention one is to unveil the other. So you know, I can sympathize with all this.
BTW, in the discussion below I’m going to assume that Holmes and Watson are partners (in life as in the detective business) and that the show only left that coded because it was 1984-5. If that bothers you, bail now. (I imagine that anyone bothered by this has in fact already bailed; but you’ve been warned.)
And it starts to seem, during that conversation in the shed, that Holmes might have been chewing on that deduction for a while, and that Watson is starting to finally get it. Murder, of course, is appalling enough. But in that moment of unspoken explication– “I begin to see what you are driving at,” says the man who normally needs such things spelled out for him–I think we can see the transmission of forbidden knowledge.
For about half an hour, this episode is pretty effective. There is not a lot of actual detective work that goes into solving this case in “Greek Interpreter;” but the situation itself is legitimately suspenseful and ultimately tragic (even more so to me in 2017 than it was in 1985), and of course we owe to it the introduction of Sherlock Holmes’s smarter brother, Mycroft. Charles Gray, whose other main claim to fame was playing the Criminologist in the film of
First of all, I think Paul may just not have received the memo about Watson’s marriage not taking place in this universe. The first line of Doyle’s story is, “The July which immediately succeeded my marriage was made memorable by three cases of interest in which I had the privilege of being associated with Sherlock Holmes, and of studying his methods.” Maybe that’s why their first scene together seems to assume that Watson is visiting Holmes instead of living with him (the detritus in the sitting room seems to come as a shock to him, and the implication seems to be that without Watson, Holmes has let himself go). Watson is eager to get Holmes to pay some attention to him, and Holmes is anxious about whether Watson really still wants to come along on the adventure with him. From the snarking Holmes does about Watson’s “legitimate work” you’d think he was jealous of Watson’s practice. And maybe he is.
I really enjoyed “Silver Blaze,” but I find that I don’t have a whole lot to say about it. After the mortal peril, deep thoughts, and grand emotions of “Devil’s Foot,” it’s nice to have an episode that’s just fun, and that’s what “Silver Blaze” is. But we don’t really learn much that’s new about the characters, apart from the fact that Watson is way more into playing the ponies than Holmes realized, and that Holmes seems to have an affinity with horses but really doesn’t like dogs. Actually, that last part isn’t much of a surprise; the only dog in canon that I can think of that Holmes has ever liked is Toby from
But here’s what I really want to give the props to Jeremy Paul for: he realized that there is some sensational psychodrama buried in “The Musgrave Ritual,” and he does a much better job than Doyle did of bringing it to life. What happens to Brunton is very Edgar Allan Poe, and although Doyle does indulge himself in speculation about Brunton’s hideous final moments, the limitations of first-person narration mean that we can’t really know exactly how it went down. Paul recreates the love triangle that drives the murder, managing to give us a convincing glimpse into how Brunton operates as a “Don Juan” and a much clearer understanding of why his ex drops the rock on him. Johanna Kirby is a compelling and unsettling presence in this episode as Rachel Howells, the housemaid with the “fiery Welsh temper” who’s been loved and left by Brunton. Holmes and Watson now get to witness her freakout when Brunton’s name is mentioned (Watson being the one who gets to deal with Rachel’s medical care after she faints). We the viewers get to see how Brunton got her to help him, and why she turned on him at the last minute; we also get to hear him screaming for help and banging on the stone while she walks away. That whole sequence is legitimately chilling, 1980s production values and all. Her final flight into the lake is a little over the top; but it’s worth it to set up that little extra spine-tingling moment as Holmes and Watson drive back to the station. Holmes says, as he does in canon, that he figures Rachel Howells is far away and starting over with the secret buried in her heart. But we know that she isn’t. And sure enough, just before the final credits, Brunton’s ex heads down to the lake, and up she comes:
So I wasn’t looking forward to it. But initially, going back to it, I was pleasantly surprised. Shaughnessy made some good calls, the most important being expanding Watson’s role. Hands down the best part of this episode is the first visit to Aldershot, where we see both Holmes and Watson in a somewhat new light. In Shaughnessy’s adaptation, Watson has brought the case to Holmes, and you can immediately see that Holmes’s attitude toward the military is completely different from Watson’s. Watson loves being back in the army atmosphere; his accent actually changes once he starts striding about the yard, and he’s so proud when he’s introducing himself to Major Murphy and giving his rank and regiment. Holmes, on the other hand, is manifestly uncomfortable here, and we find out why when Watson assures Murphy that Holmes understands the importance of keeping this on the down-low for the sake of the regiment’s reputation. For Watson, this really matters; it’s wrapped up in his notions of “honor,” and his own identity. But take a look at the military history Watson actually describes in
This is something that I actually really like about this adaptation, because it rescues Watson from much of the humiliation that is dealt out to him by the canon story. “Frances Carfax” is one of the stories responsible for the Stupid Watson myth. In canon, as in “Solitary Cyclist,” Holmes sends Watson out on a solo mission; and this time, Watson does even more remarkably badly, finally embroiling himself in a fistfight with Green from which he has to be rescued by Holmes (who is disguised as a French worker, because of course he is). Watson does a number of things in this story which are really uncharacteristically stupid even for ACD canon, including ignoring Holmes’s request for a description of Schlessinger’s left ear.
I noted that in “Three Gables” the makeup team tried to give him some extra color, but it became too obvious. There’s no attempt to do that in “Dying Detective;” and it’s just pitiful how pale he is. Outdoor light seems especially cruel. The scene in which he publicly curses Culverton Smith is perhaps the most painful.
As I said, in “Illustrious Client” and “Creeping Man” the adapters were still fighting that narrative. In the “Memoirs,” they seem to have given in to it. Watson is spending a lot more time at his surgery than he used to, and he doesn’t appear in this episode at all. It’s true that in the canon story, he doesn’t have a lot to do that couldn’t be done by someone else; and it’s also true that Watson’s absence makes more sense out of the fact that these bozos allow Anna to literally expire before their eyes without either deducing that she’s taken poison or trying to get her to bring it up. But up to this point, fixing that has always been one of the goals of the Granada series–to make Watson a partner in the firm, rather than a perpetual apprentice. The effect of bringing Mycroft in here, on the other hand, is to reduce Holmes to the role of *junior* partner. Mycroft is the one who figures out where Anna’s been hiding and comes up with a method of getting her to show her tracks; Sherlock only works it out after Mycroft has dropped a couple of very obvious hints. That, let me just say, doesn’t make a lot of sense because Holmes does still get to notice the importance of the coconut-matting in both corridors; of what is that clue “suggestive,” if not the one that Hopkins has him failing to grasp?
a lot of contempt for the poor. The poor must be poor because of their own personal shortcomings; look, Neville St. Clair proves that with smarts and wit and industriousness you can make a gentleman’s income
. Either way, though her performance is kind of odd, you can tell that you’re watching someone who has It–the ability to keep the camera and the viewer interested, even when what she’s doing is pretty mundane. And I should also point out that I have been noticing that these screenplays do spend more time than you might expect fleshing out the servant characters, and that I’ve now figured out that a lot of the writers for this series had also worked on
: 1) Everything’s better with more Watson and 2) all the changes you make should come from canon. Watson’s expanded role in this one provides a lot of the entertainment. Holmes himself is vastly entertained by the fact that Watson knows so much about racing, and is both sincerely grateful to him for offering up his story of knowledge and also kind of dragging him for it. Watson providing a diversion while Holmes cases the joint is also entertaining; I mean none of what happens during that sequence is really that original, but it’s fun, and their reunion behind the tree on the lawn is a great little tidbit. Giving Holmes the chance to swipe some hairs from the brush allows Paul to actually make the microscope hair-and-fiber bit at the opening of “Shoscombe Old Place” relevant to the solution of the mystery. The crypt scenes are spooky enough, though frankly I found the giant spider on Lady Beatrice’s corpse
Anyway. So this is just one example of something detailed, sustained, and nuanced about Brett’s performance in this role that seems like a kind of amusing quirk but turns out to be far more emotionally significant than you might realize. The bottom line is that Brett was just a better actor than most of the men who had attempted the role before him. There are thousands of great actors in England, and comparatively few of them really make it. Brett spent some time toiling in the cultural salt mines, in both England and the US, but he was always better than the work he was given to do. In Holmes he finally had a part to which he could give everything he had.
And here we go. The end of Brett and Burke, and the end of my adolescent Granada experience. No longer will these write-ups be infested with irrelevant detail about my younger self, the ardent and idealistic Young Plaidder who watched these in the first bloom of her womanhood, blissfully unaware as yet of homophobia, institutional racism, the deep cynicism of American foreign policy, the Internet, reality television, gynecological cancers, and exactly how stupid a Repubican president could become. For Young Plaidder, the big loss after “The Final Problem” was not Holmes–who everyone always knows now is coming back–but Watson. When the series resumed after the hiatus, Burke was unavailable, and Edward Hardwicke was cast as Watson. I don’t yet know how Brett handled the transition; but Young Plaidder could not. I am loyal by nature, and once I get attached to an actor, I find it hard to let go.
I don’t blame Bowen for finding this unsatisfying. After all, Holmes has only the Duke’s word that Wilder will be gone, and there is plenty of evidence that Wilder has always been and will always be a real threat to Arthur’s safety (as I shall henceforth call young Lord Saltire). The business with the check probably seemed to Bowen to be unworthy of Holmes, especially after taking such a high-handed approach with the Duke up to this point. And yet, all of this is perfectly consistent with Holmes’s earlier behavior in cases like “Scandal In Bohemia,” “Blue Carbuncle,” and “Abbey Grange.” As long as he knows, and he is satisfied that justice as he understands it is being done, he’s not about helping out the police–and he’s shown himself plenty willing to take money off aristocratic clients, especially if they’ve given him attitude. “Discretion” is one of the things that people like the King of Bohemia pay him for, and Holmes knows that, and he’s made his peace with it–because the Kings of Bohemia fund his investigations on behalf of all the governesses and music teachers who can’t afford him. If he makes a habit of dragging all his aristocratic clients through the press, pretty soon he won’t get any more.
gotten better–and knowing, at the same time, that this could be and probably is temporary. It is the feeling of seeing your straight friends so happy for you, their happiness so blissfully uncomplicated by your ambivalence, and appreciating the love but also feeling the gulf between you and them. All of this, in one close-up, in one reaction, without saying a goddamn word. THAT is the magic of Jeremy Brett’s Holmes, right there.
I raised myself up on my elbows. He lay below me on the hearth-rug, his hair swept back from his face, soft shadows gathering about his lips as the flames bathed his face in their uncertain light.
But when we get beyond the H/W stuff, this episode is just not very how. It’s true there is an attempt at exciting sympathy for our primate cousins, and there’s this interesting shot of Holmes in the zoo, one exhibit among many:
Holmes quietly folded himself up and sat down, cross-legged, at the foot of my armchair. The firelight danced, reflected, in his upturned eyes.
. Back when Doyle was starting out in medicine, one of the ways doctors determined the lethality of a particular substance was to take it themselves and document their symptoms. And it’s worth remembering that this was probably the fastest and surest way to determine whether the powder was actually the cause of death. There’s no “send it to the lab for testing” in ACD canon. Holmes IS the lab. He knows more about forensic chemistry than anyone in England at this point, and of course he hasn’t brought his equipment to Cornwall. So unless they were going to test it on some unfortunate animal (as Holmes does in
On the page, Holmes is immortal. He rises from the dead, and is allowed to drift off into various afterlives: keeping bees on the South Downs, international espionage, the Valhalla of the mind where it is always 1895. That’s part of what fascinates us about him: he never has to get old, he never has to die. Over time, film and TV adaptation preserves the myth of Holmes’s immortality by continually renewing the character and the stories so that a rejuvenated Holmes reappears, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and modern, with each iteration. But
So, when Holmes says “I have never loved,” well, the whole episode has been about showing us why that’s bullshit. He has loved, and the person he has loved is the person he’s saying this to. But the rest of it…Holmes is basically saying, if anyone ever harms the person I love, I will fuck them up. And in the adaptation, Watson gets to say it back: yeah, I would probably do the same in that situation. Now, “I will kill anyone who hurts you” is kind of a strange way to say “I love you;” but honestly, if you watch the scene, I think that’s basically what they both mean.  This is the ILY exchange. They’re closer now than ever before. Death is still with them. But now they’ve faced it together. They’ve both gone into that chasm and come back out. And they’re finally, now, on holiday. Together.
All this is to say that I’m going to be discussing sexual violence below the cut tag, because it’s pretty clear that that’s one of the things really menacing Violet Smith in this story, even though Doyle never explicitly states that.
Sherlock nodded, and lay his head onto John’s shoulder, his limbs loosening up, drawn to curling towards John like sunflowers to their sun.
‘Are you okay?’ A chuckle. No. You weren’t gone. Damn it. I can’t help but look at you this time. My anger’s gone. Why now? Why should this happen now? Anger is the only thing keeping me standing. I’ve reached a new high of self-resentment and loathing. Anger is all I have. Bottled up. Hidden. Much like yours. Freed when I was high on
You didn’t move. I couldn’t see your face. Then you kneeled. I felt your warmth around me as your arms embraced me tightly, never letting me go. As if I would vanish into thin air. You tucked my head under your chin and I was sniffling in your neck after a while. There was something wet and warm in my hair and it was then I realised you were crying. I gasped and tried to squeeze my arms around you reassuringly. I was never good at this. As you were never good at showing emotion. All the air was sucked out of my lungs as your grip tightened and I stayed obediently still. Your jaw was set and your muscles were tensed. I could hear your teeth squeaking like an old door needing a fix.
"I said we don't need to discuss it all now. Or ever, if you feel there is nothing else to discuss", John soothes, brushing his hand through the short curls at the back of Sherlock's neck. Oh, how wrong he is, indeed, Sherlock thinks, and his chest expands as if he had swallowed a balloon. "I just wanted to let you know... I am going nowhere. Okay?". Sherlock slowly nods again, almost like a broken doll. His brain is a mess of fireworks, and the gallop of his heartbeat in his skull -his pulse is elevated, oh- is too loud.
Sherlock wanted to make John feel the same. Wanted to make him feel brimming with so much that his heart would clench and his eyes would tremble, that his nightmares would go away and his eyes be marked with laughter lines, that his breath would hitch and his knees go weak.
. Treacherous voice of yours in my head whispers. Okay. Not okay, then. But what? The broken whimpers you leave trailing all over me, make my eyes well with unshed tears. It was about time I cry too. I haven’t done for ages. Maybe I should. It’s a temporary release after all. I blink several times as I curl my body around yours defensively. Not towards you. But to the world. I’m almost protective. What are we? What is this?
Of course, he had attempted to rationalize this. Multiple times, and insistently. Did three little words matter so much, after all? Was everything else that he was enthusiastically and eagerly and genuinely doing for John not enough, in the grand scheme of things? The answers were always ‘yes’, and ‘no’ respectively. Hoorah for consistency, and woe to him.
I was thinking the worst when I looked into your sky-blue eyes and they were swimming with tears… of joy? Of anger? Of hurt? You never cried for any of the last two and I finally managed to realise you were shaking your head negatively. Your tears were of relief… maybe joy but that could be underestimating my drinking habits so relief it was.
"Oh, come on. I know you like that stuff; you had made a pillowfort once on that case in the country, because you couldn't think, remember?"
I will put major warnings for some chapters later on which you can always pass without reading and focus on the cute ones since this story is written in fragments that you can read as one-shots.
“God, I love you”, John growled, stretching his legs just as much as Sherlock’s would allow him and getting comfortable again.
‘That’s the whole point.’ Why are you doing this…? You’re falling apart, John. Please. Not for me. I don’t-
‘What noise?’ Lower register tone. Damn it, what is wrong with me? You should know what that noise is. You should know that it doesn’t matter. You should know that my only chance ever was with-…
‘Did I…?’ I couldn’t go on… Had I blacked out? Had I hurt you? I observed your face and your lips, your eyes and neck and whatever was showing from the few unbuttoned inches of your shirt, begging for a sign. Nothing. Yet I didn’t rejoice. Marks could be left in far more private and dangerous places. Bruises that marked far more humiliating possession than the one that was shone right to your face by a cut on the lip or a nipple on a shoulder. Marks deliberately placed in places of absolute secrecy. Wounds that indicated bluntly how someone was never touched lovingly anywhere but brutally only in the places needed like an animal and then left to heed and heal its own wounds alone.
You turned to look at me. I felt you shift and could almost hear your heart beating. The grass rustled beneath us and we smiled, with the stars watching over us…
It had been fairly easy for you to finally catch our guy. In fact, you were done by the end of the day! I could see you were nervous and somewhat off. I suggested to look for a place to stay but one look at you and I knew. You wanted to go back home immediately. I managed to convince you to follow me back to an inn I had seen earlier and settled us in a room. You were standing by the window looking at the stars. I approached softly and brushed your arm.
That’s it. The last straw. You’re such an idiot. If I knew you’d react like this I would wish you never found the DVD. She’s the reason you are backing out. She’s the reason you’re ignoring all this. Us.
‘O-okay… I’d better get back to cooking.’ I managed, slightly disappointed without meaning to be. I shouldn’t crave for more really, I had some cooking to do and your sister and daughter where just behind the door.
‘Just once. That’s all it was.’ I’m focusing back on reality again. That’s all? Really? It was also a promise. A promise. Your promise. Why are you-?
‘I’ve mean to say… always, and I never have…’ I could hear the tremble of your lips and my heart almost broke at the familiar words. All those years ago, you had tried so much… You had lost so much for my sake…  I turned on my side and tucked you into my arms. It still seemed so new. We hadn’t said the words but we had slowly converted ourselves into what we really were. And now…
I was always blushing when you were calling me names. Years might pass but I’m sure I will never grow used to this. It was even more embarrassing when I wasn’t expecting it. This time I was cooking our daughter’s favourite new specialty and so I had you on speaker while she was playing with her new chemistry set. She wasn’t big enough to understand all your name-calling completely but hearing this particular one she turned her little head to look me in the eye with almost a smug face someone could say. I shook the sensation off but it returned immediately afterwards when I realised what I was missing. Her aunt was here for dinner tonight and I was pretty sure she had never heard you sweat-talk like that before because when I turned around to put a bowl on the table she was right there looking at me with utter disbelief written all over her.
‘Um… Can you grab some orange juice for the little one, please?’ I semi-shouted towards the phone so you can hear me. Apparently, you caught my uneasiness as always but what you didn’t understand was that I had you on speaker so you continued cheerfully.
"I almost bloody lost you. I am not going to lose you again". John murmurs, and cups Sherlock's cheek in a roughened, but warm, palm. The detective forgets how to breathe, and his eyes widen almost out of his skull.
‘Would complete you as a human being.’ Oh, fuck with the intonation intensity, dear. You’re ruining it.
“I love you”, John affirmed, taking one of Sherlock’s hands in his own and kissing the bony knuckles. “I love you”
John walks in only to find him curled -not exactly, or it could turn painful quite soon, but contorted enough- into the small space of his armchair. Doesn't seem phased by his grumpy expression, or the petulant pout, when he laughs at hearing that Sherlock is 'bored'. "Cuppa and telly?", he just asks over his shoulder, seemingly otherwise ignoring the detective, as one might ignore a five-year-old acting up. Sherlock gives a noncommittal grunt, hugging his knees as best he can. So of course John is forced to notice him again, on the way from the kitchen with two mugs in hand.
Sherlock pulled the covers down to his shoulders. His eyes were slits, he could barely open them more. He held the edge of the covers with one hand and lifted it as invitation for John to crawl underneath and join him.
‘You’re suspended, Watson.’ I spit out but I try to hide a grin by looking the other way. I’m sure you can see the flush of my cheeks spreading down to my neck and ears. ‘To your post.’ I groan inwardly as you try to snake your arms around my waist.
. I breathe in sharply. My gaze slowly moves. My polished shoes, then the floor, then your leather brown ones, your blue trousers, your thighs -maybe those trousers where a bit much tight indeed-, your belt, the securely fitted light blue shirt… oh, God… what am I even doing?
John cupped his face, guiding his stubborn man to look at him. “Then we’ll work on that. Sherlock… you are the one for me and I will not stop telling you until you believe it”
“I just started to the melody of your intonation. Every time you would say it to me. I suppose I wanted to catch the words in my hands, somehow. And then it just… It became easier. It became a way. I was afraid to tell you”
I could only stare at you in total surprise and despair until I realised you were looking at me directly and your hands weren’t on the wheel. I looked around only to find we were already parked outside of the school! Damn it, how did you always managed to do that to me? However insecure I was about my school years and the friends I never had, your words would be more stuck with me than anything else for the rest of my life with our small family.
The rainfall continued outside, drowning the engines of the vehicles passing by, of the radiator gurgling, of Mrs. Hudson’s hoovering downstairs.
In just a moment my mind’s walls collapsed at your inquisitive and worried gaze. You were standing so near. I could feel the heat of your body, the shiver that run up your spine. Your lips were open waiting for me but through all your concern and your sacrifice, your arms never reached up to embrace me and shield me from the world, telling me it was alright. As they never reached up to shield you from me, even if you were hurting all those times. I could almost spell it. You were afraid. Although you never showed it, you were afraid of me.
“We have not had anything more than a 5 in a while. So when… When the adrenaline kicked in yesterday, when the world sharpened into focus, when the first shots were fired, I was afraid”
‘No.’ I am trembling. Imperceptibly but I am. Look at us. Two broken men with no hopes and no dreams anymore. What are we? What is this?
He memorized the tiniest detail about him. The most miniscule quirk and habit, preference and dislike. The ways John laughed replaced his study in tobacco ash. John’s body was his temple of worship. John’s safety had his constant vigilance. John’s happiness his every effort.
“What if… What if I can never say it?”, Sherlock murmured into the warmth of John’s palm as he kissed it.
‘Sherlock?’ I took a step closer worriedly reaching for your other hand. Your eyes had something burning inside them, I could see. The darkness made them glitter dark blue with stars in them sparkling. You were a miracle.
I shot a glance at you incredulously. That obviously wasn’t what I was talking about, Watson. I hang my head and swallowed shifting from one leg to the other.
Of course. She couldn’t pick any other time. Of course. My heartbeat almost screeches against my cracked ribs as if to call it all out and betray me. You turn around. I’ve got to play innocent now. Oh, for the love of God. This is ridiculous.
John stared at him, for a long while. He held his chin up with one hand, enough so that their gazes could remain locked together.
I breathe. Look down. My cracked ribs protest the movement. Don’t care. My fingers twitch around the mug I’ve been holding. This is ridiculous. I secretly hope I have strayed so deep in my mind that when I finally speak the words that are dying to get out of my lips, you’ll be gone and I’ll be saved from this torture.
John had stayed. In fact, had refused to elaborate on or address the matter again. Treated it as a given. Which was most perplexing to Sherlock. For once, there was the implication that something was obvious, and he didn't know what it was. John had stayed, and kept staying, his behaviour the same, day in, day out. Sherlock found such shows of dogged devotion both heartwarming and worrisome. What if John suddenly broke down? What if Sherlock would be accused of keeping him away from Mary and the baby? These thoughts easily translated into full-bellied clouds in his head. He did not want to doubt John. He ought to be grateful for what he was given, for every moment of John's friendship. Demanding more was selfish. It was not good to be selfish. But sometimes, Sherlock cannot help it.
Suddenly your face is hot against mine and I manage to catch your wrists just in time for your fingers not to mess up my hair. I knew you were going there. I whine as my lips part involuntarily and your wet tongue shoots through them, making me shiver. You press a leg between mine. My eyes widen. No, no, no. I push you back sloppily with a whine of your name.
It had ben intense, if nothing else; them admitting to the need to be together. And John coming to terms with being bisexual. In fact, he was still coming to terms with it. Not that he’d ever been actively homophobic -he had a lesbian sister, after all- but nursing a confused sense of masculinity and fending off a toxic fear of anything too-gay was not aided too much by his boyfriend’s larger than life camp sass. Or maybe it was. Well. What can John Watson do but cope. What else can he do when said boyfriend, lover, best friend, partner, can make him feel his chest is a skywards-bent balloon with only a look? When this madman of a genius is finally his, his, and only his?
"Mmhhmm", Sherlock replies. And it is. He can finally stretch his legs, or curl up, in a place other than his bed -and so this place now seems more comfortable than his bed.
IMPORTANT NOTICE: Before this fix-it hug-scene chapter from TLD, I'd like to point out some serious warnings for this fic in general.
Hesitation. Indifference. Gaze frozen. You know what’s going on. You won’t allow it. Thank you. You are actively ripping me apart. Aggressively. That’s just great. But she’s beautiful… my mind strays. Stupid. Focus. The case. That’s right. Oh. You were almost gone. I stopped you from leaving. Stupid. Should have let you. I don’t need this.
Our eyes finally meet. Your dark stormy oceans in the soft lighting make me shiver. My fingers still at your lips.
‘I never meant to make you so angry again…’ I said in a tight whisper, my throat contracting tensed.
I freeze. Do you really think I’ve not had my full of lost chances already? Angelo’s. The pool. After the Woman. Moriarty’s trial. Bart’s rooftop. Stag night. Tarmac. And that’s just scratching the surface of the most important ones I lost. The one time I finally took the chance… One time. It will never happen again because what I am seeing now, in your eyes, is the result. You’ll never want to take a chance like that again. Ever. I can’t look at you anymore. I just can’t. Vulnerable, stupid Sherlock Holmes… Filled with sentiment. Even when angry. Anger is a sentiment. You fill yourself with it just to avoid the other ones. Painful ones. That’s what you did and that’s what I’m doing -or trying to do- now.
‘Oh, okay, that’s good.’ Piss off. Piss off. Piss off. I hope it shows in my face because I want to be angry again but I can’t and you’ll reduce me to pieces with no reason. Is that how people feel when I do that to them?
Instead of speaking, you basically cuddled me and kissed me as if kissing a child’s wounds well. You took care of me as always. That evening we made love as we hadn’t done since our first time and it was the first of many nights to come… I did my best to take care of you and my daughter -ours, from some point on- ever since and I kept all my promises since that day to try and make you both happy. Sometimes I wish you never let me start what I had started all those years ago when I first came home to you drunk. I wish you had objected and knocked me out of it. I wish you had spoken words that you even leave unspoken now. Sometimes old fears creep up on me, nightmares of old memories are renewed regularly. But through it all you both seem happy and your happiness makes me happy too… Maybe happier than I deserve.
Suddenly you stopped as we were walking up a hill and your fingers tugged on mine in a kind of plea.
Of course, how they had entered the territory of the grand realization of their relationship being much more than friendship had been another story entirely. It had included not one, but two identity crises -one before the coming out, and one right after it-, and three Sherlockian panic attacks. These were peppered amidst the events of a divorce, and the dealing with an ex-assassin ex-wife with nothing but not-good intentions. Ah, and included a failed honeymoon, after a big, fat, ‘oh shit why is everyone saying the best man is in love with the groom and then why the heck am I marrying Mary’ wedding.
"You big git", John rolls his eyes and sets the mugs on the coffee table, before staring down at him, hands on slim hips. "Two heart attacks -back to back, mind you-, one open heart surgery, and one month in ICU with infectious fever, and you act like a grounded toddler".
‘Hey…’ the melody of your voice pulls me to the surface again and I smile shakily. ‘You’re perfect and it’s going to be alright.’
‘Who you thought I was… Is the man who I want to be.’ Your gaze turns to me now. Just a tad. Ever so slightly. Damn it, John Watson. Get the hell on with it. Just do it. I’m not sure if I said all that out loud. My face felt hot as you just averted your gaze and brought a palm up to hide your eyes. If you want it… why did you do all this? Please. God. Let your words be true. Just this once.
“And I’m bored”, Sherlock replied flippantly, trudging back to the bedroom with a sleepy gait, like a disoriented puppy. “I feel like staying in bed and doing skincare today. Coming?”
Breathe. It was too much effort. I had gathered up courage. Explained the case. Laid my pains bare for you. You didn’t even seem phased by it.
Sherlock whined in protest and threw both arms around John’s waist to stop him. They could get up and eat, face the world, buy milk (they were running out, again, and no chance he’d go to the store to buy more on his own, with all that rain). But it could wait. It could all wait.
John did his best to remember the scene, when the two teams met again at the front of the embassy, with the suspect successfully eliminated.
The quiet bliss was interrupted by thermoregulation issues. It was too warm beneath the covers. Enough to warrant that Sherlock kick at them until his feet could be free from their constrains, toes flexing with bliss in the cool air, like the paws of a cat.
Self-hatred. It is something I learnt to cherish. The one last thing we both share. I can see it in your eyes, every time you look my way through that painful speech for sickness and health, better or worse and whatever the hell else before the damned conclusion of the overused question that would haunt my life forever without you even knowing. ‘Till death do us part. Why do you hate yourself so, my dear Watson? Did I break a promise? Did you?
Your sister’s eyes grew wide and I had to leave everything on the table and grab the phone in panic feeling the heat grow on my cheeks, almost not able to breathe anymore.
John has also taken charge over Sherlock's physio routine, firm hands keeping the thin torso or long arms steady, easing them into the repairing stretches and strengthening exercises. It hurts, he knows. But just a little more, Sherlock. He always says that. Just a little more. Another sip, another bite, some more sleep, or a few more steps. So Sherlock naturally assumed that it was 'just a little more' that he'd stay with him. Just until Sherlock got better, until he could achieve that little more on his own.
‘Okay.’ See that? Piss. Off. ‘Though I should mention, that it is possible for any given text alert to become randomly attached to-’
Even though Sherlock is now allowed to walk, straining and lifting weights is strictly forbidden. And will be, for some time. In an attempt to make him forget, John does the grocery shopping, cooking, tidying, cleaning. Leaves no room for activities onto which Sherlock could pounce on, only to realise that he can't complete them as he used to. And that he won't, not for some time. He lets him do the small things. Arrange his case files, clean out his microscope and equipment. Cases are, of course, out of the question. John knows Sherlock has understood what he's doing, and Sherlock knows John knows, too. But the Doctor feigns innocence anyway, and, be it fatigue, overall weakness, or just fond amusement, Sherlock pretends to believe him, for once. As long as he is not pitied, and allowed to take care of himself in the most basic of ways as soon as possible, Sherlock is willing to put up with that amount of mollycoddling.
‘Hey, there sweetie!’ you took her in your arms, lifting her up and I stood there adoring you both while you threw her in the air and hugged her once more giggling. That was definitely something she got from you. Her laugh. Clear as crystal.
Sherlock breathed in time with the rain, John could almost feel its cool caress on their skin. A raven-black lock had fallen over Sherlock’s left eye, keeping it hidden. John brushed it behind a pink, seashell ear.
‘Hey, what is wrong today?’ I whispered leaning close to place a soft kiss at the base of your neck. You shivered. I smiled.
‘I should-… come see her-… soon.’ Damned hope. I can’t resist it. There’s something inside me just whispering. I love her even more than you. Hold that thought.
John had not been surprised when Sherlock did not say ‘I love you’ back. The first time. Or the next. And the next. He figured his genius had his reasons, and frankly, he was okay with it.  He knew Sherlock’s emotions reached deep, like water-hungry roots. And he felt them through every caress and smile, every utterance of his name, and every time Sherlock would let him have his way.
"Okay", the detective exhales, putting out his hands in a gesture of appeasement. "Fine. We will make a blanket fort".
“The… thing…?”, Sherlock murmured, burying his face at the back of John’s head and curling his shoulders inwards. His lower lip was caught between his teeth and was being nibbled mercilessly.
But you don’t keep me right anymore. I didn’t do this because your dead wife asked me to. That’s absurd for you to believe. You know it.
Sherlock nudged John’s side with his index in retaliation. He was lying on his side, his torso against John’s waist and hip as John had sat up with his back propped against stacked pillows, a book in his lap.
John wanted to reach for Sherlock’s hand again, to keep him afloat whatever storm it was that he was trying to weather. But he knew better than to interrupt now.
Sherlock looked towards him. Slouched shoulders. John never slouched. Head propped up on a fist resting against his cheek, so that it gathered the skin of it up against his cheekbone. Dried lips. The lower one was cut in the middle, a small red line. It was not bleeding now, but it had been last night. Two small grey pebbles of dark circles beneath sunken-in eyes and two-day stubble peppered on cheeks and chin and jaw. Skin that had turned ashen with lack of rest, and food, and sleep. He had a cowlick, and some tufts flying rampant over his eyes, and he could only keep only one eye at a time open.
John rolled his eyes. “Why did you give me coffee if you only wanted us to get back to bed? Why get us up in the first place? Couldn’t that mind of yours have decided earlier?”, he ranted, but he did not truly mean it. His voice was whiny and soft, conspiratorial in its mock accusations. Trying to make him laugh.
‘Yes.’ I whisper and in just a moment you have kissed me again and energetically let me go at the same time.
John keeps looking down at him and the fort, and sways on his feet a little -a small rolling motion from the heels to the balls of his feet and back. Sherlock suddenly feels exposed, even if hidden, burrowed away like a cat. And he feels alone. And giddy. "You?"
You were my whole world and you have pushed me away many times before. Your knuckles have found their mark on my skin. You have bruised me and broken me more than you have done with yourself. You were my centre but that has now passed and how could I ever reach out through the endless distance of darkness between us and just hold you? Yet, here I am. Still moving. Still calm. Still unwavering. Pushing onwards. And just like that, my fingers touch soft fabric and my chest feels heavy. It’s you. You leaning over me the moment I dare to touch you. As if seeking a shield. Protection. Love.
The church is quiet. The priest is reading the respective vows. The world sways to the side and I am afraid of falling apart right in front of you, begging you to stop this, as my heart splits in half. No. Not ‘splits’. Split implies quick work. If I know one thing in life is that my heart, which always belonged to you as I have realised, wasn’t split quickly, in a second, with the respective sound implied by the verb, painfully but healing right after. No. My heart was cracked. Slowly, methodically, as if by the hands of a clever surgeon. How fitting, isn’t it? Doctor Watson. It took years. Me licking my wounds or you mending them, pulling me together only to crack it a bit more right after. Or. Or waiting for me to inflict this pain upon both of us. No. Not surgeon. Jailor. Torturer, better yet. Not you. Not your fault. You just didn’t observe. You just didn’t know. It was me.
-multiple times-… It has been engraved in my brain. What do I do now? Anger’s gone. I’m nothing now. Nothing. I just care. I care that you are standing there, tears streaming down your face because of something I did. How could I ever blame you? How could you ever blame me? I don’t know. I don’t know what to do. It’s just so human, so confusing. I don’t understand it. I don’t want to. Not without you.
‘Good. My post then. See ya.’ The military salute is almost poetic as I shake my head with fondness and raise two fingers at a silent goodbye. Of course, I’ll see you in just ten minutes from now, but it still leaves me raw every time I have to leave your side. After so many years… who’d have thought?
‘John?’ It’s not a carefully constructed façade. It’s not a front. I’m almost gone. I’m almost showing you how broken I am. The anger’s gone again and I don’t have a shield or an armour to cover myself from what’s clearly coming my way. You have no right to be like this. I have given you no right. Or have I? I’m not sure… I’m never sure… Not with you…
‘It’s not okay.’ You’re sobbing. No. Of course not. None of this is okay. Look at us. What have we become? What did we do to each other? I act as if in a trance, my fingers sliding up your shoulder, feeling the thin threads of the black shirt underneath. Still wearing black then. Still mourning. For her or for us, John? This is definitely not okay. But what could it ever be? Did we ever have a real chance at this? Was it an illusion? For the moment, that seems to be true as my fingertips feel the warmth of your spine and neck, nestling you there. It was an illusion. Shattered the moment one obstacle arose after the other. We didn’t fight for it, John. Both of us. We gave up. Not that we weren’t entitled to. Anyone would have after seven long years of waiting and suddenly shattered chances. A deep inhale. Shaky exhale. This might be the last time I ever hold you in my arms. You’re not the steady presence I always found reassuring. You’re broken… just like me.
