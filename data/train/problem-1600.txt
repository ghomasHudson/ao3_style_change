Lunch was tea and risotto with some of John’s shortbread biscuits on the side. John suggested they go outside—or at least open the curtains—but Sherlock claimed that he was testing a plant’s ability to grow in stale air and artificial light, and he wanted to keep conditions stable for at least 12 hours. He wouldn’t tell John where the plant was. Instead, Sherlock told John stories about old cases, which were interesting, but not as interesting as why on earth Sherlock didn’t want them to go outside.
John softened instantly. He was utterly unable to resist Sherlock when he was being sweet, which didn’t always look the way other people thought it should. Sherlock’s affection was often expressed in ways only John (and now Kit) could understand.
“Boredom,” Holmes breathed. “My mind is so…full. Sometimes I can’t stand the nothingness of everyday life.”
John glanced over his shoulder, a strange expression on his face as he looked at Sherlock. He turned back to Greg, lips pursed. “Not exactly.”
Sherlock shook his head again. He glanced around, calculating the time it would take for the call to register with one of the two people—ah! A silver Mercedes pulled up outside the perimeter of the scene and a dishevelled Lestrade jumped out.
John shook off his reverie and the lingering effects of Sherlock’s pre-rut scent as he rubbed at the alpha’s deltoid with an alcohol swab.
“Still sure about this whole family thing?” John teased. “We’re in for about another five years of this craziness—at least until all of them are in school full time.”
“Oh, never mind,” John grumbled. He rolled over and gathered his son into his arms. “You, young man, are up very early for a Sunday morning.”
The woman swiped across the large touch screen that had been embedded in the surface of the old desk and reviewed the reservation list that appeared. "Ah, yes. This way please."
John nodded approvingly. “Well, I certainly appreciate your professional perspective. As an omega doctor, I’ve heard plenty of those concerns. And from alphas as well—rut injuries are far too common. Even my own mate fought the idea of going for help, before we met.”
John rained kisses over the reddened surface of Sherlock’s abused bottom. He licked and sucked at the firm mounds. “So beautiful. All mine. Marked for me. My good boy.” He rambled as he pushed at Sherlock’s arse cheeks.
“Listen to you, getting all sentimental on me,” John teased, squeezing his arm. “Thought I was the one who was supposed to go all gooey.”
“Among other things. I recalibrated the next batch and managed to replicate the effects the suspect experienced. He was the murder weapon, but not the killer.”
“Right then. Come on,” John said brightly. He crouched down in front of her and Emily immediately flung herself into his arms. John stood, taking her with him.
“I need you here. For good,” John said, fingertips digging into Sherlock’s flesh as they rocked together. “So glad you’re home to stay.”
John grasped at the seeking fingers and directed them to his own tumescent flesh. He wrapped Sherlock around him with a grunt of satisfaction and began to teach his alpha how to bring him pleasure. Where to rub and tug and glide. When to pause and when to go…
“And you. Try not to start any wars before New Year, hmmm?” Sherlock slid out of the car and reached back in for his painting. “Happy Christmas, Mycroft.”
John let that settle for a moment, refusing to meet Sherlock’s knowing gaze. He’d never told anyone about the rush he felt in dangerous situations. He’d hardly even admitted it to himself.
John was rubbing over the back of Sherlock’s hand with his thumb. “It’s not the first time I’ve been attracted to a man, but I’ve never…never done…”
“And in a few hours, my brother will have Mary’s employer in custody. We will have the last of the network wrapped up. Magnussen is gone. Soon this will all be over, and you and I can resume...or rather, we can begin our lives together.”
“No, I knew that had nothing to do with your name,” Sherlock said coldly. “However, Moran is not one of the many names in your file.”
“No, no…just…no.” John shook his head emphatically. “You always land me with these nutters. Forget it. I’m on my break.”
Angelo bustled away and John let Sherlock take first pick of the chairs. He seated himself then, at Sherlock’s left side, and fussed nervously with the cutlery.
John nodded, still dazed. Sherlock tucked John’s hand into the crook of his elbow and they turned back toward Baker Street.
He glanced up, but Sherlock had not moved beyond clenching his fists into the duvet. The dark head was thrown back, eyes closed.
A hand wound itself into the wool of John’s jumper. Sherlock’s breathing was still erratic; John’s was no better. Adrenaline was now giving way to something much more carnal. They stared at one another, noses nearly touching, breathing each other’s air. Sherlock inched forward and paused, waiting for John’s consent.
Sherlock sucked at John’s earlobe as he guided his cock in. John sighed with deep satisfaction as his mate filled him.
“Fondness has never been my trouble,” John admitted, his voice a bit strained. “Jesus, Sherlock, you know I have a hard time with this…stuff. I just don’t know — god, could we really…”
John stayed put for a moment after she’d left the room. He rubbed fingers over his brow, willing away the headache that was forming. He couldn’t make any of it make sense, not until Sherlock was out of danger.
Kit leaned in close to sniff at the pile of greens before picking up one of the leaves. He nibbled at it cautiously and considered this for a minute. At length he nodded and took another bite.
“It’s a case. Missing person who no one is missing. Well, almost no one. Murder, probably. No body. Police not interested.” Sherlock shrugged. “It’s a 7 so far.”
John stepped back, falling unconsciously into parade rest, and stiffened his spine. “We’re done,” he said, his voice eerily calm. “If you or your people come to my door again, I’ll answer it with a weapon in my hand.”
Sherlock rolled them over until John was sprawled beneath him. He pressed his rising erection into John’s groin.
When he finally woke, it was to filtered sunlight peeking between the heavy curtains, and the unusual and very pleasant sight of John staring down at him.
Sherlock watched the shadow fall across John’s face. They didn’t talk about Mary. John wasn’t ready (might never be ready) and Sherlock had no idea what he would say anyway. “I know that,” he said softly.
“He’s fine,” Baz said. “I was in twenty minutes ago and everything looks fine. The surgery went really well, so we expect him to make a quick recovery.”
“John, John, John…” Sherlock sighed, nuzzling kisses into the man’s neck. He eased John’s knees down and braced himself on his elbows so he could look down into John’s face. “You look beautiful.”
RATED E FOLKS!!! I have no excuses. This is some very weird PWP that came to me (if you will pardon the pun) while doing some research. Sorry ;)
Mycroft dipped his chin at this. Of course, John still believed he was the one who’d fed Moriarty the information he’d needed to “destroy” Sherlock. They’d allowed John to believe it; it was a necessary (and now very inconvenient) fiction.
Sherlock’s eyes fell shut and lost himself to his body’s mindless need to grind from the pressure of John’s hand forward into the hard, hot length of John’s erection trapped between their bodies and back again.
John sniffed a little and shook his head again. He lifted his eyes back to the man on the bed. “You are going to tell me why you did it. I want to hear the words.”
“If I didn’t know better, I’d almost say you enjoyed this,” John continued, sounding more than a little intrigued.
Dr. Awiti stared John down. John’s last check-up with the midwife had gone well in all respects save one—John’s blood pressure was now the highest it had ever been.
Finally, John spoke. He wrapped a hand around Sherlock’s forearm where it crossed his chest. “If it means this much to you, I’ll think about it. If you promise me that you’ll think about all the ramifications.”
John turned, noting that Sherlock was already tearing at his clothes. His tone was very controlled, but his eyes had gone dark with desire. It wouldn’t be long now before they were both lost.
“He really has,” John said fondly. “Outside of the occasional felt-tip pen incident. Speaking of Sherlock, he’s informed me that we’re going to that posh new Indian restaurant a week next Tuesday.”
John’s bad hand curls into a fist. He wanted desperately to lash out: If you felt that way, why the hell did you ever let our relationship go anywhere? Why did you marry me? Why did you lie about how you felt? Why did you take on Rosie with me if I—we—weren’t what you wanted?
There wasn’t a single word of it that didn’t apply to him as well. Every single recrimination could just as easily have been levelled at Dr. John H. Watson.
“Alpha, definitely. She is so sweet and very gentle, but she always knows exactly what’s what and has no qualms at all about directing others. She’s territorial, though more as an observer/defender.”
Sherlock rushed down the aisle between the empty seats and tables, spying the one remaining server near the buffet.
“No.” John lifted his chin to meet the icy blue eyes. “I have never…I mean there was someone in the past, but I didn’t…I’ve never allowed myself to…” John squirmed with the discomfort of discussing such a sensitive topic.
“No, but I’ve seen this before,” she said, pulling herself to her feet. “Air support is ready to land. I’ve called for a stretcher.”
There was a muffled sort of wet noise. They were kissing. Sherlock made a face; Mrs. Hudson tittered softly.
John could feel the hot length of Sherlock’s cock against his thigh. That was his. His to use. To ride. Sherlock—good alpha, good mate—would fill him up. Press against those places inside where he most needed to be touched. Stretch him out and flood him with come.
Sherlock’s face fell and he dropped his gaze to regard his shoes. John tucked a finger beneath his chin and lifted gently. Sherlock allowed it, his expression wary.
Sherlock shook his head as if to clear it and turned his attention to John. “No one. I’m sure it’s nothing. Mycroft, is everything ready?”
Needless to say, he had not hesitated. He'd jumped to his feet and eagerly followed Sherlock to the bedroom.
Sherlock nodded weakly, waiting for John to help him up. On his feet once more, Sherlock leaned in hopefully. John obliged with a chuckle. He kissed Sherlock roughly, one hand behind his head to draw him down while the other tweaked sharply at Sherlock’s nipples.
Short, unassuming, mild-mannered doctor—that was the persona. But John was not the quiet, ordinary creature people supposed him to be. No, indeed. John Watson was very, very dangerous.
Sherlock turned to look into John’s eyes. His dear face was so near; John had stretched out beside him on the bed.
John stomped to the closet and retrieved his large travel bag. He reached the bureau and grabbed fistfuls of socks and pants, three vests and a jumper, and his pyjamas. He threw everything into the bag and returned to the closet for trousers and shirts.
He rounded the corner and walked through the doorway into the private room Mycroft frequently used for their audiences. An attendant closed the tall, heavy, wood door behind him. John proceeded to where Mycroft was waiting, looking remarkably calm in his overstuffed leather armchair by the fireplace.
“I don’t understand why we had to wait,” Sherlock said. He was sitting on the edge of their bed, still not undressing.
“The odds against someone guessing and being right as often as I am are incalculable,” Sherlock offered, not looking up again. “Given the damage to the body, there is no guarantee the murder weapon would have been identifiable. And my way is faster.”
John sighed heavily as they led him to one of the private search rooms. Ames ushered them in and then took up a position behind the closed door, arms crossed. The room contained a small, steel table with three bins that could be filled and taken for x-ray. There was a bunk with a rough, grey wool blanket against the wall and a cabinet with additional supplies in the far corner.
“We most certainly have. More than once. Last time just a month ago,” Sherlock insisted, He grabbed at John’s hand. “Only then it was my turn to have a crisis.”
“This is ridiculous and insipid,” Sherlock groused. He was tapping away on his laptop, finishing notes for a private client in Morocco.
“Sorry, I’m a bit late.” John burst into his office, closing the door firmly behind him. “My last appointment ran over.”
“Sherlock,” John chastised gently. “Look, he’s been on loads of programmes. Really lovely manner. Great voice. He’s fun to watch. You’ll like him.”
Sherlock gaped at him, his cheeks tinged with pink. He nodded once, rubbing over John’s naked back. “Thank you,” he whispered.
Sherlock gazed down at John, breathing through his fear, praying to whatever gods might be listening that they might take care of the man he loved.
A few minutes later, relieved and refreshed, he started back across the open concept dining room with vaulted ceilings and floor to ceiling windows that showcased the Thames. He slowed to appreciate the view. And tried to ignore the naughty wink offered by one of the alphas who’d eyed him initially. She was seated with a male beta who was clearly her husband. John scowled at her and continued on his way.
“John, I know I am not what most people would consider to be a ‘sensitive’ person. However, you know I do feel—very deeply. And strange as it may seem to anyone who knew me before I met you, I am madly in love with you and our boys.”
John pulled himself up with a groan. “I’ll get things sorted for being off my feet for a while. And Drew can nap with me today.”
“Walk me through it, then,” John said gently, pulling his legs up to cross them. “What are we looking for tomorrow?”
He could admit that he had a few more lines on his face, but so did Sherlock. Surely neither of them were that shallow.
Sherlock made a non-committal noise, ignoring John’s half-hearted warning and making quick work of John’s flies. He tugged the khaki trousers down over John’s hips, followed swiftly by John’s red pants.
Mycroft looked offended, one hand on his chest. “I have n—I didn’t—” He stopped and tipped his chin in the air. “She’s my daughter and I reserve the right to buy her whatever I like.”
The slapping of flesh and the echo of the general alarm still sounding outside the door were all John could hear, save for his own heavy breathing and Sherlock’s whispered encouragements.
“No,” John said, reaching up to roll the collar of the dress shirt between his thumbs and fingers. He tried to focus on the feel of the fabric and the thickness of the seams, but could not help thinking about how it felt to be almost pressed up against the taller man’s body. To have his hands on either side of the handsome face. He could smell Holmes’ spicy cologne, could see the texture of his fair skin.
“Sorry, sorry. Don’t get turned on just yet. I need to piss. And clean my teeth.” John yawned and stretched. “Maybe a cup of tea.”
The ride home in the cab was tense and silent. Sherlock knew better than to start a conversation when John’s mouth was set in taut line. When they pulled up in front of the flat, John jumped out and left Sherlock to pay. By the time Sherlock reached the front door, John was already up in the flat.
Sherlock placed his open mouth over the place on the side of John’s neck where he would mark, were they going to bond. He laved the flesh as John writhed against him.
Sherlock stretched out over him, very quickly realigning their bodies so they could gain much-needed friction.
John chuckled, but humoured the older omega. He tried to clean up as best he could, but he knew his eyes would still be red and swollen. “Sorry, I just…I’m not managing very well with all of this.”
John pursed his lips and then reached for his fork. Finally he took a bite of dinner. “It’s the risk we have to take.”
“You’re no talking fool,” the tall man continued. “And I have learned enough about you to know that I can rely upon you to keep what you have heard to yourself.”
“Mhmm.” Sherlock retrieved his overcoat and tugged it on. “Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other.”
“Well, we don’t have it. I’m sorry.” Hastings placed a hand on John’s shoulder. “Look, I know you want to do your best by him, as a physician, but we don’t even know who he is. He has no papers; nothing at all. If we had a name, maybe we could contact someone.”
“Hey,” John said, his mouth forming a half smile. He rushed into the room and set his coffee down on the bedside table. He took Sherlock’s hand with practiced ease, settling in to take his pulse. “How are you feeling?”
“Impressions of writing, left behind from when he’s signed or written on top of—hang on. Sherlock, this…” John traced a hand over the faint depressions in the blotter. “This is a signature. The same signature. Over and over. Jesus—it’s Heatherton’s signature. Gutteridge was practicing it!”
John’s body responded immediately to the sight of Sherlock’s nudity. His thighs were lean, but very muscular and covered with a light dusting of dark hair. The scarring down his left side did nothing to detract from the continued loveliness of his milky skin decorated with a scattering of delicate moles. And his penis…well, John knew he was hardly a connoisseur, but he had seen a few in his time. It was not overly large, but pleasantly symmetrical with a slight downward curve. The foreskin had already retracted enough that John could see the slit, and the bead of pre-come that had gathered there.
John whined again, pressing his thigh insistently against his mate’s enormous erection. Sherlock groaned his understanding. He gave John’s cock one last firm pull before releasing him. But before he could move to mount his omega, John had rolled them together until Sherlock’s back was pressed into the mattress.
“Nightstand,” Sherlock croaked. He had no energy nor thought to explain why he kept it. Masturbation must be self-evident.
“Not at all,” Sherlock replied with a gentle smile. “He texted you, which he never does. Means he approves of you.”
John rounded the corner of the alley and was brought up short by a pile of Blitz rubble. Cursing, he turned back the other way and dashed ahead. As he came upon another cross street, he spied the tails of Sherlock’s long coat as they disappeared into a doorway.
“I was…” John bit his lip. “I was looking forward to seeing you again. Not necessarily as my patient.”
John was stuffing paperwork into his bag with more force than was necessary, strictly speaking. He was in a mood, as Sherlock would call it. Though as far as John was concerned right at the moment, Sherlock could sod right off.
Sherlock sighed and took one last, somewhat longing, look at Pinkerton’s skull. Mummy was tugging at his arm.
“I realize that you will always have a place in your heart for Victor, but — do you think it might be possible that you could make space there for me as well?” John rushed on. “I know this will be difficult. We’ll need to be careful, of course. And perhaps one day the laws will change! I don’t have any family besides my sister, but she won’t care. And I’m sure we can come up with something to tell Mycroft.”
He caught the movement at the far end of the platform out of the corner of his eye. A tall, handsome young man, perhaps in his late twenties or early thirties, was striding briskly toward John and the other passengers. He carried no luggage; only a small package tucked under one arm.
“Clearly not enough,” Sherlock sneered. “Because I can’t forget it.” He strode to the window to look out over the back garden. “Every time you touch me, all I can feel is your fists. Your shoes hitting my ribs. I can’t forget the look on your face when you blamed me for Mary’s death.”
By the time he returned, Sherlock had settled in his chair beside Drew’s high chair and placed a couple of triangles of cheese and pickle sandwich on Kit’s plate. John sat beside his older son and took four cheese and pickle for himself.
John typed up the referral and hit print. "Is there anything you need in the meantime? We could discuss an anti-depressant."
He shoved at Sherlock to get him moving toward the door while the others dealt with Mary and carried John to the entrance.
“Of course,” Sherlock turned and offered John his elbow. He watched his mate as they strolled amicably in the direction of their favourite restaurant.
“Crimewatch, Newsnight and that stupid gossip program don’t count,” John sighed. “This is different. “This is ‘Escape to the Country,’ Sherlock! Remember? We were talking about it—”
Sherlock gazed at his friend, his John, for the first time allowing his deep and abiding affection and desire for the man to be reflected in his expression without restraint. It was probable John wouldn’t remember all (or, hopefully, any) of it. In all likelihood, John would return to Mary, blissfully unaware that Sherlock had been harbouring inappropriate fantasies about him since the day they met. Not remembering a moment of this day to be troubled by his infidelity, or his departure from the strictly heterosexual.
Sherlock was no longer a virgin—in any sense of the word. Within three days, they'd had sex in every room in the flat (and Mrs. Hudson's foyer) and had fallen asleep post-coitus on the floor, the sofa and even once in the bath.
She looked at Greg, who nodded. She repeated the motion herself and lifted her arms to allow John to unbutton the plaid fleece to slide it off. Mycroft watched this with an indulgent expression. Like Sherlock, Mycroft was ill at ease with overt emotion, but his affection for his mate and his daughter was very evident.
“I know you do,” Sherlock replied, with a kiss to the tip of John’s nose as he rolled away. “On to your side, my love, so you’ll be comfortable later.”
“Well,” John said, his voice suddenly very quiet. “Well, that’s okay. You’re going to be my first, too. Not my first…you know — not exactly. But this is the first time I’ve…” John let this trail off, glancing down at the belt in his hand.
Sherlock’s mouth twisted. “Sister!” he hissed. He shook his head and sighed. “There’s always something.”
“It seemed prudent,” Mycroft began. “To leave you some dignity, and allow Sherlock time to work his way around to some kind of explanation.”
“Tell me.” John bent his head and kissed a trail over Sherlock’s jaw before moving warm, moist lips over Sherlock’s neck. He mouthed at the sensitive flesh and stopped occasionally to suck.
Kit glanced up at him, pushing unruly auburn curls out of his eyes with one hand. He studied John for a moment before crawling down and off of the bed to cross to where his daddy stood. He patted his hands gently against John’s bump.
“I knew I’d love Em, even before she was born, but I didn’t know it would be this strong,” Greg said gruffly. “My mum used tell me I’d understand when I had my own—that there would be a day when it wouldn’t seem so scary to put other things in my life aside for a while, for my kid.”
“But why isn’t my mother’s scent working for Christopher? A family alpha should have been able to provide the needed pheromones.”
He was just about to remove his trousers and pants when he heard footsteps coming up the stairs. His heart leapt in his chest.
John sat up with a grin. “Well, some people enjoy it, but they’re not all omegas. Or female betas. It’s nice that we no longer have to like things or behave in a particular way based on the bits we were born with. It was one of the things that drew me to gender medicine, actually; helping young people figure out who they are. Offering them options. Like you.”
“You’re one to talk,” he deflected finally. He finished with the wrap on his patient’s abdomen and moved the sheet aside to begin work on the bandages covering Sherlock’s hip and thigh. “I’m not the one who’s —” John glanced around him before finishing in hushed tones. “Who’s a
“Sorry,” Sherlock mumbled, mouth still full. He sucked hard at the tip and then pulled John’s length in along the surface of his tongue. He choked a little, getting used to even a modest omega cock bouncing against his palate. John sucked in a sharp breath as Sherlock inadvertently grazed over his fraenulum. The noise was not missed—Sherlock immediately reproduced the contact and set about massaging the spot with his lips.
“He was wearing a chullo—an alpaca headcovering popular in the Andean Mountain region. Not extraordinary, except when taken along with the recent uprisings on behalf of indigenous South American peoples against international corporations involved in mining and the diversion of fresh water. One such corporation, based here in London, has received numerous threats. When the man in the chullo lifted his hand to scratch his face, I noticed a distinctive discoloration around his fingernails consistent with the use of certain chemicals used in the manufacture of explosives.” Holmes shrugged. “Either that or it could have been an indication of heart disease.”
Sherlock wrapped himself around John’s body, pressing his face to the spot just above John’s heart. “Yes. Of course. It’s…amazing.”
Sherlock growled, a warning to the omega not to move or to attempt to escape again. John knew he could ignore it and continue resisting, but he had no will to. He was ready. He wanted.
As the evening wore on, and the wine and then the cognac disappeared, John began to sink into the loveliness of their fairy tale. He wanted to feel Sherlock—to touch and hold and kiss and make love to him. He needed it desperately, and he could tell Sherlock was receptive.
Oh, Sherlock had all sorts of technical knowledge. Anatomical diagrams, maps of the human nervous system and research into human erogenous zones all resided within the walls of the Mind Palace. Practical experience, though, was another story.
“Now then, I’ve got all your favourites. You sit right here and let me serve you. It’s what you deserve.”
Greg shook his head. “Nah. I’d rather face this with a friend. And it’s not like I’m in a hurry, is it?”
With Kit sorted and the babies amusing themselves, John collected the rest of the coats and took them to the bedroom. Returning to the sitting room, he took a seat in the chair beside the sofa.
Somehow, John maintained the balance of a compassionate heart and a stoic demeanour. Physically, too, John was a marvel of contrasts.
John shook his head. “It really helps, you saying that, but I don’t think that decision will be in my hands.” He paused, brow furrowing. “The only way to keep Mary from Magnussen right now is to let Mycroft send her to some secure prison somewhere. They’d take the baby and I just—I know what Mary is and what she’s done, but I still don’t think I could do that to her.” John licked his lips nervously. “And what if David is still in the picture?”
“Coming, John,” Sherlock assured him. He took a handful of boxes from the bag and set them on John’s nightstand before sitting down next to John’s hip. “Deliveries arrived while I was downstairs. I just had to put the ready meals away.”
With a huff, Sherlock swept from the room. He could hear Lestrade chuckling behind him, but refused to look back.
should have gone straight home, of course. The weather promised to be lovely and he was taking Molly to Richmond for the day. He needed a shower and a change.
Sherlock bent and placed a gentle kiss on John’s mouth. “Are you satisfied that I’m not carrying any drugs?”
“Papa just means that Uncle Mycroft was quite a bit older than he was, so they didn’t get to be little boys together,” John jumped in before Sherlock could reply.
Mycroft sighed heavily, crossing his legs. “Yes, I’m afraid that was the conclusion I came to as well. It seems my brother’s rut has managed to undo the work of your suppressants and stimulate a heat. And you, in turn, have imprinted on my brother.”
Half dizzy with his own desire, John drifted quickly into an erotic haze. Tongues and fingers, lapping and sucking and stroking—it all blurred together accompanied by a symphony of filthy noises.
“Hey—what the hell!!” The camera operator backed away, still filming. “Are you out of your mind? What are you doing?” She reached out a hand to try and grab Sherlock’s swinging arm, but John pulled her back and out of the way.
“We haven’t,” John said firmly. “I work. And I go on cases with you. And you do your fair share around here.”
Sherlock gasped and bucked into John, his long fingers winding into the strands of John’s hair. “It’s been so long,” he groaned.
John Watson was lovely in sleep. The hard lines of his face softened. The sandy grey hair, which was normally neatly combed to within an inch of its life—was mussed from Sherlock's fingers. The straight spine and formal bearing of his military muscle memory eased, and his body bent to the shape of their soft mattress.
“John, I’ve given birth to and raised two boys. I lost a third child in between them. Believe me: You are doing just fine. You and Kit are in an extraordinary situation.”
“No, but…” Sherlock struggled to focus, clearly sifting through his memories of the night. “Oh, god.”
“It’s hardly an unusual story. As an enlistee, you trained as a military sex surrogate. Then you went on to complete medical school.”
“Sherlock!” John shouted finally as they passed through what had to be the final transition between cars. “Where are we going? Where can we—?”
John was moving now, unbuttoning Sherlock’s coat and shoving it off his shoulders. Sherlock neither helped nor hindered this casual removal of his clothes, searching John’s face as the man worked.
He’d rung twice (both phones) and texted Sherlock three times. Not receiving a reply immediately didn’t usually worry him. Not receiving a reply after nearly two hours made him twitch.
“I know,” Greg sighed. He dragged the curtain back and stepped out. The new shirt was a much better fit and showed off his broad shoulders and muscular upper arms. “Good?”
“Mmm,” she said, waving a hand. “I know we can’t bond until after the baby is born. It would be very dangerous to break the bond now—well, of course, you know all about that. I read your paper on broken bond baby syndrome. You poor, poor thing!!! What that awful alpha has put you through.” She reached across the table to pat his hand. “I will always take such good care of you. I will cherish you every day of our lives. You’ll never feel neglected or put upon as my omega.”
“Not anymore. Dr. Khamir has given you the all clear,” John said, waving a hand in surrender. “But it may take some time for a case to turn up.”
“Oh, right,” John said, watching Sherlock’s hand on his body. “Because the new baby wasn’t planned. You’re worried that it might be
Another two years pass and then, quite unexpectedly, a young woman appears at his door with a final parcel. This time there is a note. The handwriting is messy and almost childlike and instantly recognizable (even if he hadn’t already known the identity of his benefactor). There are only two words:
Sherlock rolled to his back and sat up, wincing a little at his tender bottom. He stood and padded to the bathroom, retrieving a dampened and slightly soapy flannel. He washed John tenderly, trying desperately to avoid dwelling on the smooth flesh of John’s belly where the t-shirt had ridden up, or the springy hair on John’s thighs. Or the feeling of John’s semen leaking from between his own arse cheeks.
The hot dogs (quartered and cut into small bites for the babies) and crisps, followed by birthday cake, were consumed. Presents were opened and wrapping paper tossed about with abandon. Drew was overjoyed with the all the visitors and the attention…and with his cake’s brightly coloured icing. John gave up trying to get it all up off the floor and resigned himself to an intensive clean once everyone had gone home.
John and Michael glanced over their shoulders at him, but he merely shrugged. He was sure he was scowling, but he didn’t care. He wanted to prove Gutteridge was a murderer and take John home, miles away from Michael bloody Bennet.
“This?” Sherlock smiled back, unable to resist in spite of his mood. He’d been distracted since the Adler case began, and probably more than a little short-tempered with his flatmate. He knew he shouldn’t be.
Drew was nine months old—a chubby, blonde-haired, good-natured baby who smiled easily, slept regularly and loved to cuddle. John had been feeling wonderful since his delivery. It was almost as though nature had hit the reset button for him following the upheaval of Kit’s traumatic birth and first few months. John had struggled physically as well as emotionally during that period, and it had taken over a year for him to start feeling like himself again.
“I was,” Sherlock sighed. “It has taken me many months to deal with my habit, and the only thing that kept me going was this.” Sherlock waved his arms around him at the flat. “You see, while I was working in the country, I was considering how I wished to occupy myself in the years to come. After the war.” Sherlock gestured at a stack of documents near the fireplace. “There’s always full-time work for my brother, of course, but I can scarcely bring myself to deal with him in wartime; I doubt sincerely I would be able to tolerate him in peacetime.”
The rest of the drive was peppered with Francine’s questions about the forms they’d filled out and their “costuming.” Sherlock insisted he would wear his coat both days. Francine attempted to make a case for some variety. John snickered at both of them during the exchange.
“Not entirely sure,” John replied. “I think they’re supposed to pin the body parts to the picture of the corpse.”
The boy went down hard, spinning half a turn before falling flat on his face on the restaurant’s lovely hardwood.
“Well, as it’s us it’s hardly likely to be uneventful,” Sherlock scoffed. “I’m sure Lestrade will call. Or who knows, we may get lucky and someone will be poisoned right here!”
Sherlock glanced down at the bundle of brown paper next to his arm. “I can’t tell you that, I’m afraid. Official secrets. And the less you know, the better off you are. The men following me were hired by a rogue Argentine general.”
He lifted his hand and traced with a gossamer-light touch over the line of John's upper arm. Not overly muscular, but toned and firm. Hard.
John laid a hand on Greg’s shoulder. “Absolutely.” He pulled his phone out and consulted his calendar. “Oh, damn. Sorry. I’m afraid I don’t have any time for about two weeks. If you like, I can set you up with Mike or with Dr. Faulkner.”
Sherlock moved swiftly, heart pounding. He settled his abdomen on the duvet, ensuring that his own aching cock could achieve some friction against the mattress if he needed it. There was a moment of silence, and then he heard John rifling through his bureau. He dared not look.
John sighed — a rich, satisfied noise. “Well, then. I guess we’d better get started. Open your eyes.”
John, for his part, traced the path of the flames down the side of Sherlock’s neck, over his shoulder and then along his ribcage. He had healed very well, but the burns were still an angry colour.
“Yeah, I do,” John replied cheerfully. “I like seeing the options in all the places. You know—get an idea of what it might be like to live somewhere green. Maybe with a view of the sea.”
omega,” John snapped. He couldn’t keep the bitterness out of his voice. Being suppressed had never, ever mattered before, but now?
Kit had Sherlock’s hair—a scattering of darkish waves on the top of his head—and John’s eyes. It was unnerving, feeling as ill-equipped as he did, to stare into his son’s face and see his own dark blue-greyish eyes staring back at him.
He allowed the foreskin to slide back at his direction, marvelling at the smoothness of it against the rigid shaft beneath. It was something like taking himself in hand, of course, and yet was so very different.
The high-pitched whine Sherlock emitted stoked the fire in John’s belly. He looked up briefly to see that his lover’s eyes had closed and lips parted.
“Oh, am I?” John fluttered his eyelashes. “Well, I’m overcome. You should be careful—flattery like that might just turn my ordinary mind to mush.”
"Look, Sherlock, nothing is ever simple. Or easy, necessarily. But if you are asking if I’m worried about people finding out about us the answer is no." John used the spoon to remove the teabag from his mug and took a sip of tea. "If anything, I'm a little worried about people finding out that it happened so fast."
Now he was stuck in his room alone, counting the passing of time with every tick of his old analogue alarm clock. Kit and Drew were playing with Em at Mycroft and Greg’s, and Sherlock was off with Dimmock for a really promising disappearance case.
John’s hips arched off the floor as Sherlock’s cock rubbed over his bottom. He was leaking profusely now, his passage loosened and ready. “SHERLOCK!”
“Oh.” Sherlock scanned his memory for any traces, but it was quickly obvious he’d either deleted the programme or not paid any attention when watching it in the first place. “What’s the premise?”
“You have?” John thought perhaps he should sound more surprised—that seemed reasonable—but he was far too interested in the touch of his alpha’s fingers over his bare bottom as they slid his pants off. A trickle of lubrication dribbled from his bottom and he moaned.
“No!” John said, far too quickly. He shook his head, laughing tightly. “Well, yes, actually, but not in the way you mean.”
John had happily wolfed down four of the biscuits Sherlock had just dosed. They were filled with the drug cocktail that almost certainly had resulted in Lestrade’s current homicide case, from two nights previous. The signatures in their only suspect’s blood had been a bit muddled (and the pathologist had been inclined to ignore them given the man’s history of dabbling in performance-enhancing drugs) but it seemed the most likely option: Aggressive and then uncharacteristically violent behaviour (witnessed by a host of his fellow body building enthusiasts at the gym only minutes before the crime) coupled with complete amnesia of the night’s events. Still, Sherlock needed to be able to prove that the man had been deliberately dosed with a combination of steroids and methamphetamines, laced with a hallucinogen.
John turned onto his side and snuggled closer to Sherlock's body. It was too warm for cuddling, really. But when a man finally realizes he is in love with his best friend, and that best friend finally reveals the feeling is mutual, well, not even a sticky summer morning could put a damper on the need for closeness.
"Comme c'est joli," she replied kindly. "Congratulations. I will deliver Monsieur Holmes when he arrives."
“Oh, god, John,” Sherlock rasped. He slid forward in his seat to reach for John’s hand. “It was always for you. Everything.”
“All of it!” Sherlock shouted. He released his hair to flail wildly. “Everything. Every last dark, miserable moment where I felt like I was being punished and I DIDN’T KNOW WHY!!”
Four years during which Sherlock had tried to give John enough space to be a husband and father, because it was what his friend wanted. He’d killed a man to save John’s wife. And tried to protect her from her former employer, James Moriarty. And held John when she died.
“What I feel for you,” Sherlock began, “is more than affection. Though I feel that, too. I admire you. I respect you.”
“No problem,” John said cheerfully, drying his hands. He tipped his cap and left the washroom, following the corridor out to the clinic’s rear entrance. As promised, the driver’s van was waiting for him. He retrieved the keys from the uniform’s right pocket and started it up.
John lifted one hand, inching in the direction of the slender fingers resting on the hospital bed. Sherlock reached out for it, palm up. There was barely a breath of space between them, but it felt to John like so much more.
John stepped further into the room, moving around the spot where Sherlock had become rooted to the ground. “Janine? What are you—how…?”
“Right. Fine.” John’s anger lowered his voice and turned his vision red. “So you’ve hated me and Rosie for god knows how long and you’ve just been letting that fester, letting Rosie believe you cared about her, letting me worry and wonder, and now it’s just—no. You know what. Fine. Fine. I’m the bad guy and we’re done. Okay.”
“As a real case, John!” Sherlock cried, jumping to his feet. “How long has it been since we were out there, on the streets? One month? Two?”
Sherlock hit the deck; John took shelter behind one of the tables and drew his own weapon. He ducked out from behind his cover and returned fire.
Sherlock’s breathing was laboured, but his hips remained immobile as John sucked him off. John had long since taken himself in hand to pump in time with the movements of his head.
He made his way to the refrigerator and had a quick look inside—yes, the samples from last night’s experiment were gone. No doubt Sherlock had slipped out early to make his way over to Bart’s and consult with Molly. He’d always done that, of course. Nothing new there. It was just…
“Uh, yeah. Work.” Greg sighed. “Thing is, I put it off by another month—cashed in some holidays. It’s just…” He gestured helplessly to the little dark-haired girl playing on the floor. “I mean don’t get me wrong—I LOVE being a copper. I love it. It’s all I ever wanted to do.”
“Oh. No, not really,” John replied, glancing up. “I mean, I do want to be in really good shape tonight.” He paused and thought a moment before shrugging. “But, yeah, mostly I just don’t feel like it. Why?”
They stared at one another for an age before John finally made up his mind. He reached behind him and slid the door bolt into place. Sherlock watched him expectantly, tongue darting out to wet his lush lips. John moved in, emboldened by the invitation and by the conviction that he really had nothing to lose.
Soon enough, with the intro filmed outside, Michael was leading them through the main floor rooms of the house. Sherlock tried to pay attention to the discussion—and to where the cameras were—and make the appropriate noises at the appropriate times. He followed John through a cozy sitting room, a full formal dining room, library and period kitchen before Michael took them back to the front foyer.
Once his morning sickness had evaporated, his energy had returned…and with it, his libido. He’d been relentlessly horny for a month.
Sherlock took a deep breath and ran his fingertips back up over the definition of his abdominal muscles. They were lean and firm and surprisingly pleasant to the touch. He felt a bit weak-kneed as he wondered what John’s chest would feel like.
“But you do still have options,” Dr. Awiti said. Her expression became very solemn. “If you really don’t feel you can cope with this baby…”
“Now then,” he started, patting Kit’s leg. “I need you to hold Daddy’s other hand, Kit, and make him feel better. All right?”
“I can’t believe we have two months to go,” John lamented, using his free hand to tug fruitlessly at his shirt over his rounded abdomen. “I feel enormous already and the baby still has growing to do.”
“Right,” John said kindly, his smile warm. “I’ll have Lucy pencil you in for 8 a.m. on that Friday, then.”
Baz raised a brow at this. “Well, even so, you need to rest and give your wound a chance to heal properly. You’ve got a much longer road ahead than he does.”
It reminded Sherlock of their first cab ride together, the night John had first come to 221B. They were sitting closer now than they had been that first night, but Sherlock didn’t trust himself to actually touch John before they got home. He couldn’t stop himself from looking, though.
“I’ll decide that for myself, thanks,” John said. “I don’t know about you, but I’m knackered. What say we go to bed?”
“I know.” John shook his head. “I can’t believe how fast the time has gone. I swear it was only yesterday I was weaning him. And going through potty training. And watching him take his first steps.”
"That's it, Love," Sherlock heard John whisper, as his orgasm ebbed away and his lover nipped playfully at his inner thigh. His fingers didn't leave Sherlock's pants though. Instead a third finger from John's other hand snuck underneath the fabric, from the side and started to tease his slick opening, while the others kept on rubbing his clit.
“Mrs Miller, I hadn’t expected you at this time.” Martha added a hint of disapproval to her voice, although she doubted that her neighbour even noticed it, as distraught as she seemed. Her hair was in disarray and her coat didn’t match her shoes, which clearly reflected on her state of mind. “What happened?”
Sherlock frowned and had to bit his cheek, to keep from wincing, as the movement sent a jolt of pain through his head.
"You can't hold it against John that he wants to work again," Mrs. Hudson continued her monologue as if Sherlock wasn't glaring at her from his armchair across the flat. "A man like him needs to feel needed."
Heat rose in Sherlock's cheeks and he ducked his head in shame. John had counted on him to solve such cases and he had screwed it up ,the first time he had had the chance to catch two rapists. Instead, Sherlock had been attacked himself and John had felt forced to...
"How...?" Sherlock stared at the man in shock, at the use of his name. He didn't think, that he was that recognizable. There was no picture on his blog and he always made sure to keep a low profile, while working on cases, so how on earth...
It was strange, Sherlock mused as he stifled John's forthcoming protests with his lips and covered the full length of his lover's body with his own, how much better he felt. Now that he had revealed his fears to John and had them accepted instead of rebuffed. Being in control was also doing a lot in making him feel more secure. He captured John's lips in a passionate kiss and let it deepen, until they were both gasping from want for more. Only then, did Sherlock move further down John's body. He covered John's scar with kisses and then - without any warning - took one of his lover's nipples in his mouth and sucked on it hard.
"It wasn't a man." Sherlock only realised belatedly, that his words weren't as reassuring as he had wanted them to be, since the worry didn't vanish from John's face. The drugs and his exhaustion were certainly to blame for how slow his mind was working.
Sherlock's first instinct was to deny such a stupid notion, as all his former experiences told him, that this was a trap and that John would make fun of him, for wanting them to be on a date. Somehow though, he managed to keep the first response, that sprung to his mind inside, as he reminded himself, that John had just killed a man for him. Certainly, he was different from the other men, Sherlock had met in the past.
Sherlock gulped, as the man got up from his chair and reached for something in the drawer of the nightstand. He had hoped, that his host would be discouraged by his gender identity, but obviously he didn't care, if he was looking for a condom right now. He had always used condoms with the victims.
Sherlock smirked, when Lestrade's smile fell and was replaced by disbelief. His eyes moved from John to Sherlock and back to John, who merely shrugged. "It's as he says."
"Harry... she was raped at seventeen by one of her presumed best friends." John ground his teeth together.
"That was before I realised how boring this case is." Sherlock left Lestrade staring in a mixture of shock and anger at him, as he hurried away from the crime scene and out of the hotel. He needed to get home to go to his Mind Palace, to find the detail that had been niggling at his mind since this morning. Somehow, the feeling had only got stronger during his visit to the crime scene. Somewhere, there was a connection and Sherlock would get crazy if he didn't figure out what it was soon.
"Shush." John rubbed his nose against Sherlock's cheek. "You don't have to take off your pants, if you don't want to. Don't think you have to force yourself to do anything, you don't feel comfortable with. In fact, if you don't want to continue..."
"But I know how you hold your body when you grin. So what is it?" Sherlock turned back around and closed his arms around John as he pressed their foreheads together. "I was just thinking of our first corporate murder."
The only problem was that Sherlock wasn't sure himself, how he would react to casual touches. He didn't want John to feel like he had to handle him with kid gloves, but then again, Sherlock also didn't want to make it worse by involuntarily flinching away from his lover.
"Oh fuck and I gave you an opioid." His host ran an agitated hand through his hair. "You didn't look like an addict and I... Sorry, that came out wrong. I just mean..."
Sherlock sighed as he hit the button for the second floor. Sometimes, it was enjoyable to bicker with Donovan but today she was merely annoying. Not only because her remarks were far off the mark, but also because it felt like she was blaming him for what had happened, although she didn't know the first thing about it. John was right, he should really take money for helping the police with their work, if they decided to verbally abuse him every chance they got. Maybe then his lover would also decide to work less.
"Stop!" John caught Sherlock's hand in his before he could do more than tuck at his pants. "If you need them to stay on, they stay on. Actually," a sheepish note entered John's voice. "I think I will leave mine own on, as well."
“Indeed,” Mrs Miller crossed the street with a few steps and Martha was uncomfortably reminded of her own damaged hip. “It’s rare to see you out and about at such an early hour. Usually, one can’t find you outside your house until well into the afternoon.”
"Sherlock?" John's worried voice made him resurface from his short trip to his Mind Palace. Blue eyes looked worriedly up at him and the words sprang to Sherlock's lips without his permission. "You killed them."
Lots of fluff and h/c in this chapter. If you like John taking care of Sherlock, I'm sure you'll like this chapter.
Sherlock forced the rising heat, in his cheeks, back down. He wouldn't blush, at the compliments of a criminal. "I’m also transgender."
"What do you mean?" There was neither judgement nor anger in his voice and Sherlock leaned back in the bathtub.
"It wasn't a very nice man," Sherlock returned, before he could help himself. To his astonishment John giggled at the remark and Sherlock escaped a similar sound, in response.
Sherlock frowned at that and forced his eyes to stay open, until he had solved that mystery. "You have found other ways in the past few weeks."
John kneeled down next to the dying man - Sherlock couldn't even say when he had moved - and affirmed Sherlock's own diagnoses as he shook his head. There was nothing to be done, to save the man.
"You are not so bad looking yourself, Doctor Watson." Sherlock winked at his lover, to cover up his own insecurity.
Sherlock considered that for a second, but dismissed it. Their man hadn't played with his victims, but he had wanted to let them know over tea why he was going to kill them. Very British, indeed. It also led to believe that the motives for the murders had been personal. An angry ex-lover perhaps? But why would he kill both brother and sister?
Sherlock frowned. Either John was planning on the kind of session, that he certainly wasn't into or - more likely - his lover was just clearing out the whole drawer in his search for something else. Judging from the way the lube, condoms and tissues were put orderly next to the bedside lamp, while everything else was just stacked in a pile, it was obvious that John
Sherlock wasn't sure how it happened, but he must have somehow managed to get to his feet and stumble out of the room, because he found himself back in the corridor. He glanced down at himself. His trousers were up again and his shirt was partly buttoned. There was no recollection of how he had got re-dressed. Considering the state Valentine had been in, Sherlock had probably dressed himself, but he wasn't sure. Frankly, he didn't even care. Not now, when all he wanted to do was to get to John. Sherlock only needed to make his way back to Baker Street. He clenched his teeth and took the first stumbling step, on his long way home.
Sherlock didn't catch what the man was muttering, as he came to his side. He only registered strong hands, grabbing his shoulders and urging him into a half-sitting position, on the bed, before the man vanished again. It would probably help him, to focus on the steps of the man, to judge how big the flat was, but Sherlock was too busy with taking slow controlled breaths, to pay attention to anything else. Therefore, he startled again, when something was pressed against his lips. A pill of some sort. Sherlock kept his mouth shut.
"Could you now?" Sherlock felt a grin tuck on his lips, as he accepted the bottle, but let it fall to the mattress beside him. "We will see about that."
Sherlock got lost in the sensation of John shampooing his hair and then rinsing it, without getting anything into his face. He hadn't felt so cared for since... No, he couldn't remember when someone had treated him like this. Like he was something precious and special.
Somehow Sherlock managed to get most of the tea down his throat, although his hands were shaking like mad. It was impossible to say for sure, if it was an after effect of the drugs or if the cause was his own panic.
"You always take ages to dry your hair. I neither want to wait, until you have finished, when I leave this shower nor do I want you to complain about knots in your curls. So," John smiled softly up at Sherlock, "Let's both get ready separately and then meet up in the bedroom."
"I..." Sherlock didn't even know where to start his protests - he didn't ride in police cars, as a rule - but John stopped him in his tracks, with a kiss on his cheek. "Please do as he said. I don't want to treat you for pneumonia, if you venture outside in just a sheet." Another kiss was placed on his lips, when Sherlock turned his head to meet John's eyes. "I have to go now. Be careful."
"In a way. I was just making a list of the things you should know before moving in with me." At the curious look, John gave him, Sherlock felt obligated to come up with something. Never mind that he had only made the statement, to distract John from what was really going through his head. "I play the violin at all times. I do experiments in the kitchen and sometimes I don't talk for days." Sherlock decided against mentioning the body parts, that were stored in the fridge. No need to risk scaring John off completely, although he might be more understanding of it as a doctor.
"Are you still brooding, Sherlock?" Mrs. Hudson clicked her tongue in displeasure. "You know you will get wrinkles if you don't stop that." Sherlock refrained from informing their landlady that this wasn't how wrinkles came to be. He also didn't point out to her that he wasn't brooding but rather doing some heavy thinking here. Something that would be much easier if Mrs. Hudson would stop trying to clean their flat... or whatever it was that she deemed necessary to do.
"Yes?" Sherlock rolled his eyes at John's disbelieving look and instead of a reply closed his arms around his lover and drew him in for a deep kiss.
"You are right, I am sorry." John offered his hand this time and Lestrade shook it. "I just worry about him."
Sherlock took a carefully controlled breath. There was no way, that he was going to continue work on this case. If it had only been a matter of a suspect trying to murder him, he would have been eager to chase them down, but not this time. His whole body was still crawling from the touches of phantom fingers and he felt on the brink of freaking out, when he so much as thought about red lipstick. It wouldn't be too hard, to come up with an excuse for Lestrade, but Sherlock didn't know how he should explain this to John. His lover had so high morals that Sherlock doubted he would take kindly to Sherlock abandoning a case like this.
"What?" Sherlock flinched at the disbelieving and angry voice. "You were trying to bait a rapist, to choose you as his next victim?!"
“That would be lovely, my dear.” Martha patted John’s hand and then turned towards Sherlock, who still looked equal parts shocked and impressed. She would ask him later, which flowers would be best to replace her rhododendrons. For now though, she would simply enjoy tea with her family.
Sherlock frowned and slipped into his Mind Palace, to search for the origin of such a pedestrian musing. He had barely taken a few steps towards the room, where he stored all new things, until he had the time to decide, if he wanted to keep them, when he noticed it. There was a new staircase leading upstairs. Worried - nothing should be built without his knowledge - but intrigued Sherlock followed the stairs upstairs. They stopped in front of a plain door and he pushed it open carefully. It was a simple square room. The walls were the colour of sand and the curtains, of the only window, were of a light blue. There were shelves against the wall and a bed in front of the window and Sherlock frowned, as he stepped farther into the room. The shelves were filled with all kind of things, in no particular order. There were books about cooking and weaponry, side by side with books about the newest surgery techniques. Empty bottles were scattered around the framed picture, of what looked like a happy family. Sherlock couldn't make out anyone in it, but he noticed the crack that seemed to split the whole picture. Interesting.
"Oh for Christ's..." Sherlock was spared the indignity of engaging in an one-sided discussion with himself, when his phone rang. "You know I prefer to text."
"What the... Sherlock!" John startled and would have slipped, if it hadn't been for Sherlock's hold on him. "Christ, don't always do that." John sighed in exasperation, but there was no heat to his voice as he relaxed back against Sherlock's chest.
Sherlock scrambled backwards, on the carpet, as red high heels entered his vision and an amused high-pitched giggle sounded from above. "God, you are beautiful."
"Great." Sherlock heard the smile in John's voice and waited for the first touch of oily hands on his back, when instead warm lips found his neck. They made their way first to his right and then his left shoulder and all the while they plastered every part of his skin with feathery kisses.
the siblings had played. Maybe someone had figured out what they had done to pass the time and decided to bring them to justice. Somehow, that sounded right.
Sherlock couldn't recall how often he had come last night, only that his legs had been wobbly, by the time they had made it back to the bed, to sleep. He was fairly certain though, that John had come at least two times. It might have been three times, but Sherlock didn't know if he had come in the shower. Maybe his erection had just flagged due to the former exertion. Usually Sherlock could tell the difference easily, but his mind had been a little overwhelmed, last night.
Finally alone, Sherlock relaxed back in his armchair and stared at the unoccupied one opposite him. For the last week, John had left the flat early every day and had only come back late in the evenings.
"Do you really think, that our man will come here, tonight?" John sounded as impatient as Sherlock felt. "Why would he even go to this park? There is no one here. Not even some old lady walking her dog."
A few seconds ticked by, until Sherlock's tired mind managed to inform him of what John meant by his words. When it did, shame flushed Sherlock's cheeks crimson. His lover was afraid to kiss him and touch him, because of what had happened to him.
"Why do you keep insisting on being innocent?" Sherlock sat up straighter in bed and narrowed his eyes at the man. "Do you want me to imagine myself safe, to highlight the experience for yourself? You might still get disappointed. I am not the kind of man, you are looking for."
"Low praise," John huffed and then glanced down his own body. "I guess I could do with some hours at the gym though. I am getting out of shape." He petted his small belly. "Not like you, with your lean frame and perfectly defined muscles and..." Sherlock swallowed any further compliments in a kiss. Otherwise he would run the risk of blushing like an innocent teenager. Besides, Sherlock rather liked the feeling of John's bare chest pressed against his.
"Well, I certainly do," Sherlock shot back. It didn't appear important to mention, that his former sexual encounters had mostly been disappointing, since it didn't mean that Sherlock didn't want or enjoy sex. He would only never sleep with his ex-lovers again.
This is it, the last chapter of this story. Thank you all for your support, I'm always thrilled when I receive kudos or comments. :)
Sherlock nodded. "It does, especially as I know why you smell like this. Everything went well then, I presume?" Of course it was easy to deduce, that John had been successful. He was relaxed and didn't even complain as Sherlock directed most of the warm spray in his own direction. Still, Sherlock liked to hear it in John's own words.
John's arm came around his middle when Sherlock made to get out of bed and an involuntary shudder ran through his body at the contact.
“I’m sorry, dear,” Martha apologized, before Sherlock got the chance to open his mouth, “I don’t have any honey left. I gave it all away.”
"How would you know?" Sherlock snapped and regretted it a second later. He wasn't in any position to be angry at John. If anything he should apologize to his lover for his reckless behaviour.
"Is that it?" Sherlock followed John's line of sight, to the sign of a Chinese restaurant and nodded. He busied himself with opening the door for John, to distract from the fact that he would have walked right past the restaurant, if John hadn’t asked. It would probably be wise, to stop going to his Mind Palace, while he was with John, if he didn't want to embarrass himself.
Where to start? Sherlock bought himself some time by stuffing a whole dumpling into his mouth. He didn't want John to pity him, if he told him that the situation was almost overwhelming, because he wasn't used to dating. The few men he had been with certainly hadn't been interested in going out with him or if they did, they didn't call it a date. Of course, who would be crazy enough to date someone like him?
“Sherlock, John,” Martha threw the door open, before either of her boys had the chance to ring the bell, “come on in.” She ushered them into her house and into the living-room. “Tea will be ready in five.”
"It will also be extremely hot." John smirked down at him. "You can of course touch me under my pants as well, if you like."
"What?! No, Sherlock!" John looked utterly shocked and he finally reached over to put the mug on the table and then clasped Sherlock's hand in both of his. "I could never find you repulsive. You are the most amazing man, I have ever met. You are smart, witty, downright handsome and just the right amount of crazy, on top of it. Not taking you up on your offer to sleep with you the other day, was one of the hardest decisions I ever made. Please, believe me."
Instead of the expected, pinched expression – at the reminder of her defeat – Mrs Miller’s eyes grew sad. “Our dear Lydia won’t compete in any contests, ever again. She passed away, last night.”
For a second Sherlock wondered how John's mind worked, that he had arrived at this conclusion, but he decided to solve this mystery another time. "Why shouldn't I want to kiss you?"
"I need him," Sherlock muttered before he could stop himself. Heat rose in his cheeks as Mrs. Hudson stopped her movements and he could feel her eyes on him. "Of course you do, Dear. Still, your John needs his own work. He is a doctor after all. You can't expect him to always follow behind you. Besides," her voice took on a dreamy quality like it always did when she recalled her own past. "It's not good for a couple to spend all the time together. My husband and I for example..."
She grabbed the hem of his trousers and shorts to pull them down and Sherlock knew that something was going to happen. He wasn't exactly sure why anymore, since it was getting harder to focus with every second, but something would happen. Cold air hit his genitals.
John chuckled and the mattress dipped, as he sat down and stroked a hand through Sherlock's curls. "Admit it, you didn't believe that I could even come up with fourteen different pet names."
"Boring," Sherlock sighed, but Lestrade's next words prevented him from ending the call. "They have been shot with the same gun as the guys that were killed by our serial killer."
"Only for you." Sherlock sniffed at John's hair one last time, before he reached for the shampoo and splashed a generous amount on top of his lover's head.
"What are you grinning about?" Sherlock raised an eyebrow at the question. "You can't even see my face."
As far as Sherlock was concerned, everything that had needed to be said was out in the open now and they could resume their life. The only question was if John agreed with this assessment. Sherlock truly hoped that John wouldn't insist on feeling guilty for what he had done. Yes, one should probably feel guilty for killing someone, but... these were very special circumstances and Sherlock didn't want his lover to beat himself up over it.
Even the voice of Mycroft in his Mind Palace seemed to come from far away, but Sherlock tried to follow the advice. He managed two more steps, before the edge of the carpet became his downfall and sent him tumbling to the ground. Out of the corner of his eyes, Sherlock detected movement, as the other person in the room moved slowly over, to where he lay helplessly on the floor. Well, at least he had solved the case.
One of John's eyebrows rose at that, but the look in his eyes softened at the same time. "Your Mind Palace?!"
"God, I’m sorry." John's worried face was in front of him and then a woollen blanket was thrown over his shoulders, even as he was drawn against a warm body. "I shouldn't have said that. Not when you are in such a state."
Over the next couple of hours, Martha listened to her boys’ recollection of the last month. Her heart swelled with pride when John told her, that he had been made head of department at the local hospital and she squeezed Sherlock’s hand in excitement, when he described an especially complicated case, he had solved. She might not be their biological mother, but Martha doubted that she could have loved them any more if she was.
Her voice mingled with the ones of all the others, that had seen it fit to call him that and a quiet whimper escaped Sherlock's lips.
"Fuck off!" He really needed to study memory techniques to find a way to throw Mycroft out of his Mind Palace, although his subconscious mind would probably just create someone else to reveal his deepest fears to him and be his voice of reasons. At least Mycroft was less annoying than Mummy.
Sherlock smiled tenderly and breathed a kiss to his shoulder. "Nothing, just... if you keep calling me
. It was served at the InterContinental to the victims and... you." Sherlock searched John's face for any signs of panic or fear at having been found out, but there was only amusement mirrored in his eyes as he met Sherlock's gaze.
The last of the tension, that Sherlock hadn't even been aware of, dissolved at John's words. His lover wouldn't hold it against him, if Sherlock needed some more time, until he was comfortable enough to let himself be seen completely naked by John, again. Hopefully though, John's consideration wouldn't be necessary, since Sherlock felt perfectly comfortable while cuddling naked with his lover. And if it was, then Sherlock was still positive that it wouldn't be necessary for long. As long as John and he worked together they could overcome every obstacle. That thought sparked another idea and Sherlock's eyes snapped open, when they had just been about to close. "John."
Sherlock drew his eyebrows together and tried to force the memories to the forefront of his mind. His efforts only resulted in intensifying the pounding in his head and this time, he couldn't hold back a hiss of pain.
"God yes," John moaned at the sensation and pressed closer to Sherlock's mouth. It had the added effect of rubbing his erection against Sherlock's crotch, as he bucked his hips upwards at the same time. Sherlock felt a new rush of arousal pulsing through his lower body at the obvious proof of John's desire for him. He kept on sucking first one and then the other nipple, while grinding down against his lover. The dampness in his own pants spread and when he glanced down the lengths of their bodies, he noticed a wet spot on the front of John's own underwear as well. John had been right it was rather exciting, continuing with parts of their clothing still on.
"Brilliant. Only you could have figured that out." Sherlock blinked down at John in disbelief. That wasn't the reaction, he had expected. Truthfully, he had never imagined that he would ever accuse John of being a murderer – again - but if he had, it wouldn't have been his first guess, that his lover would compliment him for finding him out. Then again, Sherlock wouldn't have believed himself to remain this calm, upon discovering that the man he loved was a killer. Certainly, he should feel betrayed or at least be fearful of John, right? Sherlock checked with himself, but couldn't find an ounce of fear and only the tiniest feeling of betrayal. The most prominent emotion though was... surprise.
John chuckled quietly, as he reached behind Sherlock for his shower gel. "I take it gun powder registers as an attractive smell to you."
Sherlock groaned inwardly, when Lestrade's eyes snapped to him and narrowed. Great, now Lestrade would feel it necessary, to berate him for his behaviour and force him, to talk the police through his every step, when they were working on the next case, together. He should have told John, to keep their true first meeting a secret. At least he hadn't mentioned how Sherlock had believed, that John had been the killer. That would have been embarrassing.
Sherlock blinked slowly. John's summary of the events fit together with the images, that had flickered through his Mind Palace. The last part of John's statement rattled him though and it took him a second to understand why panic was rising anew in him. When he did though, Sherlock grabbed John's hand and almost fell out of bed, in his haste to lean towards his lover. "I didn't take drugs... not willingly, I mean. I am clean. I swear I..."
"Like flatmates?" Even Sherlock recognized the disappointment in John's voice for what it was and hurried to reassure him. "No, more like friends or... partners." There was a hopeful note in his voice, that Sherlock doubted went unnoticed.
"Lestrade," Sherlock deduced, in a split-second, as his mind came completely awake. There had to be an interesting case, if the DI came to the flat, at this time in the morning. One could only hope, that it was at least an eight, to keep the boredom at bay, whilst John was away, applying for a boring job.
"Yes, I was drugged," Sherlock admitted slowly, if only to buy himself some time, before John would ask any follow up questions. And Sherlock didn't have any illusions that his lover would ask the right questions. After all Sherlock had noticed that he was clad in his pyjama bottoms, which meant that John had undressed him. Therefore he had to have seen the marks that the woman had left on him. There were marks, right?
"They aren't illusions," Sherlock growled and forgot the situation he was in for a second and glared at his host. He hated when people tried to fool him. "I know that you are the serial killer."
Sherlock repeated John's words in his head and the blush faded from his face, when he confirmed that his lover was serious about not blaming him for his decisions. Still there was something else...
Sherlock's eyes snapped open at the voice and he jerked upright, only to regret the movement a second later. Stars exploded before his eyes and he barely managed to lean over the side of the bed, before his stomach emptied itself. He heaved, even as nothing came up anymore and tears started to form in his eyes, as a result of his splitting headache.
A blush crept into John's cheeks, but he held his head high as he met Sherlock's eyes. "I am not as good with words as you are, but I want to show you with my body how dear you are to me. I understand if you don't want to and I won't pressure you, but... it would mean a lot to me... that's to say I..."
? In some regions, it’s consumed because of its hallucinogenic properties, but it can also cause vertigo, low blood pressure, nausea and an overall weakness. It’s rarely deadly, but if elderly people consumed it over any significant length of time, it could certainly prove to be lethal.”
“Oh Sherlock, my dear boy.” Martha sniffed and squeezed his hand on top of the table. “Let’s just wait and see, some things have a way of resolving themselves.”
"You are quiet," John stated the obvious, after their starters had arrived. "Is everything alright?"
Sherlock grimaced, both at the fact that his brother was correct and that he had made an appearance in his Mind Palace at all, during such an intimate moment with John.
Sherlock didn't know if he should laugh or scream, at the remark from the Mycroft, in his Mind Palace. Numerous rejections by men, because he didn't have a cock, but a serial rapist didn't care. This was...
“Oh good Lord,” Martha pressed a hand to her mouth to hide her expression, “I just saw her on Monday, for tea. She always enjoyed her cucumber sandwiches so much. How did it happen?”
Sherlock glanced back over his shoulder, at the confused looking Inspector and shook his head. "Do as I told you and you will see that I was right, as for who killed them," Sherlock shrugged. "I don't know and it's much too boring a case, to use my time to figure it out."
The Mycroft in his Mind Palace always had such great advice, Sherlock mused sarcastically. As if he wasn't aware, that he had to figure out where he was, before he even thought about opening his eyes. Firstly, he concentred on what his nose could tell him. There was no antiseptic smell in the air, therefore he wasn't in a hospital.
“Oh, hello Mrs Hudson. What draws you out, in such poor weather?” If it hadn’t been for the curious gleam in her neighbour’s eyes, Martha could have almost believed the concern, that Mrs Miller was trying to convey.
Sherlock blinked in disbelief at his lover. He had been sure that John would be thrilled by the suggestion of rimming. After all, he loved it when Sherlock spent hours worshipping his arse, so why would he react like this now?
"Who is that?" Sherlock glared at Lestrade, for interrupting him. He didn't need to turn around, to know that John had just stepped up behind him. The DI hadn't met John yet, since he had preferred to wait in the car in the street, while one of his officers had gone to collect Sherlock, in the past. And he hadn't deemed it necessary, to tell Lestrade more than had been absolutely necessary. The DI had believed him, that someone had tried to mug Sherlock and John had been able to help him. No need to tell him the truth, if it would only earn Sherlock a tongue lashing. And no need, to provide more than the most obvious facts now, either. "He lives here. Can we now go back to..."
Anderson huffed behind him. "So you want us to believe, that they were having tea with their murderer, before he killed them?"
"All the others were so ordinary, but Michael liked them well enough." The words, coupled with the sensation of a wet tongue on his ear, brought Sherlock back to the present and he shuddered in disgust, as she sucked on his earlobe. Everything in him screamed to push her away, but when he tried to make his arms cooperate, he only managed to weakly push against her shoulder.
It almost lasted long enough for Sherlock to drift away, before a slap to his face brought him back to reality.
Sherlock turned his head to speak into the speaker, while making it look like he was just adjusting his earplugs. "It's not idiotic. It's going to work... just like last time."
"I need to shower." Sherlock didn't care for how pleading he sounded, but he needed John to understand that he had to wash the touch of the woman from his skin. It was that or scratching himself, until he bled.
"What?" The dumpling slipped from in between John's chopsticks and landed in a sea of soya sauce on his plate.
“Old people die,” Martha shrugged. “But don’t worry, I feel just fine, although I wouldn’t refuse some help in the kitchen.” Martha wasn’t surprised when Sherlock followed her into the kitchen, after he had convinced John to sit down. She would have been disappointed, if he hadn’t come.
"A little dramatic for the usual big brother speech, isn't it?" John joked and brushed their shoulders together, instead of running away at Sherlock's warning, like any sane man would have done. Sherlock wondered how many more things he would find about John Watson, to marvel at.
Sherlock frowned as he repeated the words in his mind, to figure out why they appeared to hold some special meaning, even as he started to examine the body. It was easy to deduce that the man was in fact the killer, they had been looking for, although Sherlock knew that the signs weren't obvious to anyone else. The police would have never believed that the man was the serial killer - not enough evidence - nor that John had needed to kill him. The way the man had closed his hand around his gun, in the pocket of his jacket, was enough for Sherlock to go on, but not for the idiots from Scotland Yard. He only couldn't figure out, why the killer had been about to deviate from his usual pattern. Usually, he only shot his victims after he had been through with them. So why... had he recognized Sherlock and decided it would be better to get rid of him or had he only wanted to threaten him with the gun, to make him comply?
"What are you looking for?" Sherlock raised an eyebrow at John and glanced at the items he had placed on the nightstand. Lube, condoms, tissues, cotton buds, patches, wound disinfectant...
"Yes," was all Sherlock managed to get out, as he stared after John and only remembered what he was supposed to do, when the door downstairs fell shut.
"I took great pains, to find men that were guilty of rape, but had gone unpunished. It was at that time, that I put my walking stick away and my hands stopped trembling. I was fighting my private war in the middle of London and no one suspected anything. Then this copycat came along." Sherlock gaped, as another piece of the puzzle fell into place. "You were stalking him when he attacked me. That's why you could help me... and why you didn't hesitate to shoot him a few days later. You knew exactly what he looked like."
Sherlock blinked. That wasn't the reaction he usually got, when deducing people. Most people just told him to piss off, if they didn't become violent right away. To get praised by a rapist and murderer was...
John fidgeted with his hands and turned towards him, but his gaze was determined and open, when he met Sherlock's eyes. "I don't shoot a man for just anyone."
“Let’s talk about something more joyful.” Martha gave both their hands a squeeze. “How is that nice, young woman, you told me about? Molly, right? You told me on the phone, that she just had a daughter? Are they both well?”
"Why is it in the bottom drawer?" John muttered to himself, but then retrieved the bottle with a triumphant grin. "On your front, if you please."
Sherlock opened his mouth and closed it again, the words just wouldn't come. The apology was on the tip of his tongue, but he couldn't seem to get it past his lips. He had spent years training himself not to apologize for every small inconvenience, but now that it was important to show how sorry he was, he couldn't do it anymore. Frustrated, Sherlock clenched his hands in the fabric of the sheets, that covered him. He jerked in surprise when his right hand was covered by a warm, smaller hand.
"You were covered in vomit and shit back then and needed help. It's a bit different than getting flashed like this," Lestrade cursed, as he stopped next to the door to Sherlock's bedroom.
"John," Sherlock called out, when his lover turned to leave. He couldn't make much sense of all the mixed emotions, that were whirling through his mind, but he was sure of one thing: He didn't want John to leave. "Please stay." Sherlock patted the other side of the bed. "Just for a bit." Sherlock held his breath as John stared worriedly at the empty space of the bed and only released it, when his lover nodded.
"I don't think that your own marriage is a good example," Sherlock remarked drily. "And if there isn't anything else you wanted, I have to think." Mrs. Hudson shook her head at him in disapproval and muttered something about his parents having a lot to answer for but thankfully left the flat.
before killing them," Sherlock started slowly and then his head snapped up again as realisation struck him. "You don't work at a surgery. You stalked them to figure out their daily schedule."
"I wouldn't dream of it, Love." Sherlock couldn't help the silly smile, that spread all over his face, as he reached for the hairdryer. If someone had told him a year ago, that he would enjoy his lover calling him endearments, he would have deduced the fool to within an inch of his life for even suggesting such a horrendous thing. And now, he was grinning like a fool because John had called him
"No one has been killed yet, but the case still takes priority in your department. The media hasn't got wind of it yet, although more than one crime has been committed already. That means, that the victims and their friends and families don't want to talk about it. There are few crimes, that would cause such a reaction, but I think we are talking about..."
"He was the killer," Sherlock announced and clambered, as elegantly as possible, back to his feet. "And of course, you won't go to prison."
Sherlock rolled his eyes at Mycroft's suggestion. Certainly it was possible to spend endless hours at work because you loved it, but Sherlock didn't believe that was the case for John. The work at a surgery had to be extremely boring for a skilled surgeon and ex-army doctor. A case of Pneumonia was probably the most exciting that occurred.
John, who had remained completely silent, while Sherlock had relieved part of the horrible evening, seemed to come back to himself at the words.  "That's not a good idea. You might lose your balance and fall down." The words were matter of fact, but when Sherlock met John's eyes he saw a world of worry and pain reflected in them. And behind all of that was a simmering anger, that was held in check by his other emotions.
To my consternation Sherlock drew me down the alley. It was utterly ridiculous; there was nowhere to hide but a narrow doorway, and I was sure that one of the two would turn and see us. And yet…it was far easier to hear what they were saying.
Another grunt, one of Grezzik’s most polite. He knew that Molly was never good when she had to be still, when all they could do was wait to get to the problem. He also knew that was to be expected, after twenty years of waiting to find the right man to kill. He could row and listen at the same time.
Without another word, he approached Prince Jamiarty, who signalled to Count Magnussen. Jamiarty pulled Sherlock up on the horse behind him.
“That is not true,” Moran said doggedly. “Nor is it true that Princess Sherlock left the Prince after their marriage.”
“And you are not?” Stam approached the cell. “Seb, you weren’t always this close to Jamiarty. But ever since you have been…what has he told you?”
Watson closed his eyes and leaned against Holmes. They hadn’t been alone since it happened; first Evans, then Gregson, then Mrs. Hudson, and Holmes had been trembling with the effort not to reach out to him for hours.
At last the Count stepped away and considered him. “No doubt you’ve guessed that your crime was not kidnapping the Princess.”
“Yes, indeed.” Watson's lips twitched. “How dare he? You only saved the life of two of the Queen's granddaughters, after all.”
Of course. The banner carriers were actually the  leaders of the lands who doubted the claims. Smart, really.
“It’s a bad habit,” Billy said, trying to be comforting. “You’ll find it easier as you go along.” He looked around, trying to distract him. “Do you and Grandfather John both sleep in here?”
The barmaid was shorter than Molly, and she said she was sixteen, seven years younger. But Molly wouldn’t have believed that, for the girl had the face of a woman old with suffering. When the stablemaster came in and shoved her aside, knocking her to the ground, she knew why.
When he woke he screwed his eyes shut again immediately—bright sunlight was pouring in from somewhere nearby. Where was he now?
Sherlock and John are out of the Fire Swamp, but there are enemies everywhere. Sherlock says goodbye.
Kitty shuddered. "The only thing that can break Bertie Gruner's spell. It's his...lust memoir, I suppose. It's fucking frightening. It's got all these pictures of all of his 'flowers', little notes about them...even records of how long it took him to break them."
Five minutes later, Sherlock was back with tea. Kitty was now curled on the sofa, hands shaking so badly she could barely hold her mug.
“Carla and Jamiarty were on a trip with me. You were ill with a cold, Sally, or I would have brought you too.” The King took his wife’s hand. “Before Bella came into my life, I missed my wife terribly, and being around my children—all my children—made me feel more sane. But while we were away, Carla became ill too. At first I thought she caught your cold. But she faded away much faster than any cold I’ve ever seen. There was no time to send for Miracle Max, and by the time we reached the edge of the Capital, she was…she was gone.”
They stared at one another, each moving to touch the other’s marks. John jumped as Sherlock’s fingers danced lightly over the puckered flesh on his shoulder.
“I researched you. Before we met I discovered everything that I could to impress you.” He laughed bitterly. “It’s a trick. Just a magic trick.”
“Sherlock, what did you do?” The doctor stepped cautiously into the room, turning and staring. He made a complete rotation, taking in the new décor. “It’s Beatrix Potter. Emily loves Beatrix Potter.”
John reached down to help Sherlock up from the bed. They stood face to face for a moment, and John reached up to wipe the tears from one of Sherlock’s cheeks. He cupped Sherlock’s jaw, rubbing with his thumb, and shook his head in wonder.
Not that he minded the rounded evidence of pregnancy. He hadn’t been crazy about the weight gain, but he had quite enjoyed the satisfying feeling of sheltering new life. But being as he’d only just got himself back into fighting trim after Drew’s birth, he was pleased to get to enjoy it for a little longer.
The staircase to their flat seemed endless somehow, with John’s fingertips searing into his waist through the thin wool of his suit jacket. Sherlock walked as quickly as he could with John attached to him. When they reached the landing, he allowed John to continue guiding him into the flat.
“Quite right,” Lombardi agreed. “My own country has been part of this project, so we will share in the technology when it is fully tested and ready for deployment. But there are so many others who are interested, as you might well imagine.”
Sherlock pulled away from him and turned to brace himself against the wall. He spread his bare legs, lowering his stance and exposing just a hint of his sweet, pink pucker. John groaned.
Sherlock shifted away again and bent to reach for his trousers. “I will be arriving back in London in two weeks time—the 8:30 a.m. BA arrival from JFK.”
“You enjoy it, though? This series?” Sherlock asked, watching as John took a sip of tea and swiped at crumbs on his chin. John hadn’t shaved yet, so there was a hint of stubble there. It had silver in it now, too, just like the hair on John’s head.
John closed the outer door gently and followed Sherlock in and up the stairs. As they neared the flat, Sherlock’s mind fired up with the reality of what they were about to do. Or what he was pretty sure they were about to do. It was momentous, at least for his part.
“Surely a former army doctor can find something more important to do with his time than rummaging through strangers’ pants,” Holmes deflected.
“Hmm? Oh, yes. Radio operator told me it went through fine. I assume it will make sense to whoever is receiving it.”
Sherlock knew his calculations couldn’t have been that wrong. Given the properties of the compound, John should have —
“Only if everyone comes with me,” Greg said, eyeing his family. “Don’t want to go off and sit by myself when you’re all here to visit.”
“I see. Then I’m not sure how much I will be able to do for him. I can’t treat an unwilling patient.”
The sound burst out of him before he could stifle it. He slapped a hand over his mouth and stared at the pregnancy test. Positive. He was pregnant.
“Upper arm,” John managed, trying to lick his very dry lips. He was painfully aware of his patient’s keen eyes focused on him. “You should sit.”
“Oh, that won’t work in here,” Mary said cheerfully, setting a steaming bowl of cock-a-leekie soup in front of John. “I didn’t want any interruptions for our first night together, so I bought one of those…what do you call them?”
John placed a finger to his lips. “No. Don’t say that. I won’t let you. We may not be perfect, by some magazine’s standard, and neither of us is getting any younger—especially me. None of that matters, because we are perfect for each other. These bodies?” He grabbed Sherlock’s hand and flattened the palm over his chest while he pressed his own hand into the soft, lean flesh of Sherlock’s belly. “They belong together.”
John had taken a couple of extra steps. He turned and walked back to where Sherlock stood, glancing around them. Finally, he stopped, nearly toe-to-toe with Sherlock, and looked up at him.
He stood abruptly as the producer and Michael arrived. Introductions were made, and Sherlock found he had to pull a slightly slow-witted John to his feet and prompt him as things got underway. By the time the interview began, John had recovered somewhat. Yet Sherlock caught John staring at him once or twice, looking at him as though seeing him for the very first time.
said you weren’t gay! You didn’t ever say you were bisexual. You dated only women. I didn’t want to be distracted from the work, though in the end that effort was an abysmal failure. The more time I spent with you, the less important the distinction seemed. You’re part of the work.”
John was tugging a stripped terry dressing gown closed and belting it. He looked rumpled and a little sleepy, Greg thought. His greying hair was standing up at strange angles.
A former city boy moved to the seaside with his wife of at least ten years and one child. City Boy was having an affair with his secretary (boring) and his wife had taken up dancing and prescription drugs. The child was eight or nine and clearly bright, but suffering from bullying at school. She wouldn’t last much longer by the look of things. Sherlock was considering saying something to someone when John tugged him into the small pantry to tell him Michael had just confided the family was moving because their daughter needed a fresh start. All would be well.
"That's it love," John begged, tugging firmly on his prick as he held Sherlock's mouth to his chest. "Yeah, fuck, yeah. Oh, sweetheart. God, your mouth..."
John nodded. He winked up at Sherlock and squeezed their joined hands. Sherlock could not help the smile on his face.
“Yeah, he is,” John agreed, rubbing over the sleeping baby’s back. “And right now, he needs you. I don’t know how long it will take for him to adjust, for his system to acclimate to you and being to function properly.”
Sherlock fidgeted as he noted her attention was focussed fully on John. She did not take her eyes from the good doctor as she answered her son. “I’m well. Hale and hearty. Very pleased to be here, of course. I can’t tell you how glad we are, Sherlock, that you’ve found yourself someone, when we…well, we were beginning to think—”
When at last he sat back in his chair, Sherlock clucked his tongue. “Your expression does not inspire confidence, doctor.”
He padded across to the grey-tiled washroom. It had a modern bright white sink, glass shelves and a floor-to-ceiling shower stall—the width of the room—in lieu of a tub. He hung his clothes on the back of the door and turned the shower on, set for maximum heat. As steam began to fill the room, he discovered a gift: a discreet but well-stocked selection of toiletries.
Sherlock finally looked up, catching John’s eye in the mirror over the fireplace. John knew he was a mess—he hadn’t slept all night. Sherlock’s expression softened slightly.
John shifted uncomfortably where he rested against the table. “Look, you may as well sit. We’ll have to wait for Officer Ames before we continue.”
John smiled and took his hand, squeezing it tight. He turned and led Sherlock from the sitting room, marching toward the bedroom as though advancing on the enemy. He pushed into the dark space, not bothering with lights. The kitchen provided enough for them to see each other as they scrabbled at each other’s clothes.
“’Course not,” Janine replied cheerfully. Before Sherlock or John could think to respond, she’d raised her gun and fired at John.
Greg released a burst of relieved laughter through the tears that had spilled over. Kit was looking at Greg with concern now. He moved to settle into the man’s lap and swiped at his damp cheek with one chubby hand.
Sherlock shrugged. He closed the door behind them and turned his attention to hailing a taxi. “He’s fine.”
Sherlock stared at him, gasping as John continued his concentrated attention to Sherlock's prick. Sherlock nodded once. He freed his hand from John's arm and flung the sheet away. John kissed him before turning his head to watch his own hand furiously stroking Sherlock's length.
Sherlock's hips canted of their own volition, dragging his leaking prick up and back against the coarser hair of John's thigh. He was making obscene, sloppy noises—moaning into the movement of his lips and tongue against John's flesh—and he knew it. He wouldn't last long like this. He never did.
John scrambled to keep up as they dashed from car to car, keeping a weather eye on the two behind them.
“That night I had what I thought was a bizarre, alcohol-fuelled dream. I was in my uniform and we…” John took another deep breath. “But it wasn’t a dream, was it? When you mentioned my missing Wednesday at the reception, I knew. I knew. Whatever you did to me — I should be furious. God, you utter bastard, to take advantage of me like that. And to…” John cleared his throat once more. “Well, I’ve had a lot to think about.”
"Ah, John. Sorry to wake you," Sherlock said softly, almost sounding contrite. "I didn't realize you would be out here."
“Sorry, Trouble, but you are just so lovely, and I am having a hard time believing this is real. Just look at you…”
John tried to reach for any happy memory that might at least stem the tide of his anguish. He conjured the lab at Bart's on the day they met. He'd known instantly. He had. He just hadn't been able to admit it in time. And then it was too late. And then it wasn't.
“About fifteen minutes ago,” Mycroft admitted. “Still, you’ve saved the police a great deal of time.”
Sherlock stared at him for long moments, unflinching and calm. Finally, his eyes crinkled at the corners as he smiled. “I love you, too,” he said, slipping his hand into John's where it rested between them.
The passenger’s eyes narrowed at him. John elected to ignore this. He stepped behind the counter and quickly logged into the computer.
Sherlock smirked at him as he started a call and lifted the phone to his ear. It did not take long before…
Apologies for the delay on this--and the shortness of the chapter. I was having a crisis about where to take the story (changed my mind from the original trajectory at least twice). On track now, though!
“Christ, you’re tight. Easy. Nice and slow. That’s it. Can you feel me filling you up?” John continued the comforting patter as he began to rock back and forth where he was.
Sherlock, for his part, was once more mouthing along John’s neck. He was practising for the bond bite.
John emerged from the shower, whistling and sated. He quite enjoyed the feel of hot water washing over him, especially at the end of a cold night out in the field. Their stakeout had come at the end of a case stretched over several weeks. It had left them both exhausted.
Sherlock had hold of him by his jacket, he tilted his head to give John better access to his mouth and pressed his body into John’s shorter one. “John…”
“A suicide attempt,” John supplied weakly. “She is a lovely kid—bright and funny—but her parents can’t accept that she identifies as a beta female. She’s been through the psychological assessment; we were supposed to meet today to get her started on the hormone therapy for her transition. But something happened at home yesterday. She took a load of pills last night.”
“Me too.” John sighed, and snuffled at Sherlock’s hair. “But we have this now. Thank you for being braver than I am.”
“Exactly. Yes,” Francine chuckled. She turned and began leading them out of the station toward the car park. “Sorry. Bit star-struck. Isn’t every day you meet a world-famous detective duo!”
The banging on the door continued — and, as predicted, banging on the wall he shared with Mrs. Highbridge began.
He rubbed his cock hard against John's leg and moaned, long and hard, as he came—John's flesh still in his mouth. He panted heavily through his nose as he collapsed weakly into John's body, continuing to suckle as he rode out the aftershocks.
John looked at Sherlock and, seeing the confirmation in the other man’s eyes, he nodded. “He is. What do you think?”
John leaned in, grasping Sherlock’s unmoving hand in both of his own. He hovered just above Sherlock’s ear.
John pulled back a bit and they stared at one another. He nodded a bit sadly, trying to wipe the misery from his expression. “I hate this.”
He was still shaking as he secured the belt. He pulled his shirt off and pressed it against the wound—just as John had taught him.
He’d been released from hospital only two months prior and had been directed to a convalescent facility where he had a drab, cramped room overlooking Portman Square. He was still having difficulty adjusting to the impact of his injuries. His shoulder ached and probably would do so for the rest of his life. The damage done meant he would never be able to perform surgery again. His leg was — well, the doctor insisted it was “all in his head.” They could find no physical injury causing the pain that now forced him to walk with a stick.
She grabbed John by the arm and dragged him forward—her alpha strength was more than a match for him at nearly nine months pregnant. His big belly threw him off balance and he slid sideways into the chair to keep from falling. Behind him, Mary patted his shoulders.
Sherlock moaned now, helpless as he drew John's pebbling nipple into his mouth. He laved and suckled, teasing with teeth and tongue. He lost track of any sense of time as gave himself over to worshipping John's body.
Sherlock stopped, his glazed eyes quickly refocusing. He blinked down at John—now sprawled wantonly across the bed and teasing at the tip of his cock—and swallowed hard.
Not that it mattered—his alpha appeared to have buggered off to parts unknown. Of all the times for Sherlock to get distracted.
Mycroft’s cheeks coloured and he shrugged, reaching into the car seat to adjust the baby’s blanket. “I just wanted—”
“Why are you feeling guilty?” Sherlock demanded. He took a few steps towards where John had stopped, just inside the door. He reached out unconsciously with one hand. “You have nothing to feel guilty about!”
Sherlock pulled back and regarded him with a tender smile. “And that is what you taste like in me,” he rumbled.
John walked for more than an hour, weaving back and forth from main streets to back alleys. He was in shock—numb and unable to process anything around him. His mind raced with dark thoughts and recriminations. Guilt. So much guilt. Anger. And a soul-searing terror that he could only have imagined. This was what it actually felt like to lose everything.
"Mr. Huang," John greeted his long-time patient, a middle-aged man from only a few streets over. He'd been a commercial driver before migraines and altered vision took his license. "How are you today?"
“Stops being bogus if I find something,” John said calmly. He looked up at the man once more. Holmes gave a very good impression of haughty indifference, but John could see the signs. He had been on the job for less than six months, but he could tell his passenger was uneasy. Guilty, even.
John entered the room, swallowing around the lump in his throat. “Good morning, my lads!” he called.
“Guess I’ll just have to see what we get. I can always decide what sort of name will suit once I’ve met him or her.”
By the time they reached Pevensey Bay, Sherlock was nearly vibrating with the need to get on with his case. He couldn’t bear to look at Pretty Michael any longer, or to watch him dancing attention on John. Nor could he stand the strain of feigning a relationship that did not exist…but that he wished with every fibre of his being DID exist.
After a quick stop for coffee, he took the tube to Bond Street. He'd spied something for Sherlock at Gray's a week ago, when they'd passed through on a case. He'd asked the chap to hold it for him, and had been planning to pick it up for their anniversary. Sadly, he hadn't had the heart on the day. Now though...
John’s shaky legs eventually gave out, but neither of them was interested in going any further than the floor. They settled in front of the fireplace, still wrapped in each other’s arms. Sherlock made a circle for John with his arms and legs; John shuffled in to press his back to Sherlock’s chest. It was effortless, as though they had always been this way together.
John was in their bedroom, trying to keep a squirming Drew from rolling out onto the floor from the portable changing mat on the bureau while he fastened a cloth nappy and reusable cover over his bottom. He couldn’t help but smile at his youngest as Drew took advantage of his now-free legs to grab at his toes. John tickled at the baby’s exposed belly under his little jumper and delighted in his gurgling laughter.
John slid his hand under the jersey fabric and dragged his fingertips down the length of Sherlock’s plumping cock. “Be still. I don’t want you to hurt yourself.”
When Greg called, they'd been thrown headlong into a case that had kept them from home for three days. So it was that John had the privilege of waking this particular morning to the delightful sensation of his fourth full night in Sherlock's bed and embrace.
Through the window Sherlock watched people walking along the seaside across the street from their hotel. Couples. So many couples…
Sherlock turned in his seat. “What I’m trying to say is that I may still forget myself as a mate and a father from time to time. My passion for the work occasionally consumes me, and I hope you will be able to forgive me for that. But I knew what I was getting into. You’re what I wanted from the moment I met you. Our children are everything I could have hoped for and more. Never for a moment should you wonder if I will begin to resent any of you for being in my life, because that is exactly where I want and need you.”
to find out either. It simply hadn't occurred to him that anyone else would care. And it certainly wasn't anyone else's business.
“Yeah, all right,” Greg conceded. He rubbed over his back as the young man disappeared. “I just have a really bad feeling about this.”
"Sorry. I didn't realize it had gotten so late. I, uhm, wasn't feeling well and wanted sleep. I'm feeling better now."
John was still standing motionless in the middle of the small room when Officer Ames returned to it several minutes later.
John chuckled. “Scream for me, my good boy. I want you to scream when you come just like this. Come on. Come with me!”
There was a great gust of breath, almost as though Kit were sighing his relief. Within seconds, he was settled peacefully, thumb in his mouth, as he blinked at John.
“I know. There you are, my good boy. Let it all out. Let me make you feel good.” John focused his attentions on the head of Sherlock’s cock.
John nodded and moved awkwardly to the overstuffed red armchair Sherlock indicated. He fell into it, now suddenly very aware of the grinding pain in his thigh. He rubbed at the knotted muscle with a clenched fist, unreasonably angry at his body’s betrayal. And at such a time.
John wrapped an arm around Sherlock’s shoulders and Sherlock leaned slightly in his direction. “Tell me.”
There was a long pause, following which John chuckled a little. “Poor Anderson. Wonder whatever possessed him to go along with
Wishful thinking, that’s all it was. It had been ages since any alpha other than his mate had displayed more than a passing interest in him. Which was fine.
Sherlock’s mouth slackened as John circled him gently with fingers and tongue. John carefully moistened Sherlock’s hole before slipping his index finger just within and pulsing gently. At the same time, he eased his mouth down over as much of Sherlock’s prick as he could and sucked hard.
So this was what people meant when they said they “couldn’t help it.” This was the passion that drove so many to desperate acts.
“Kissing you is probably the best thing I’ve ever done,” John said softly, grinning. With a saucy lick of his lips, he picked up his own menu and casually flipped through it.
“Don’t be so literal, Mr. Holmes,” Lombardi said cheerfully, standing and striding toward them. “Oh, yes, I know who you are.” He smoothed a hand over the package. “The only thing one needs to produce an alibi is—”
John had been home, at Baker Street, for a few weeks. Sherlock had tried to be restrained in his responses. He didn’t want to offend John with his obvious delight in having his best friend back at 221B. Not when John was still struggling.
“Ah, no,” Sherlock said swiftly. That was a step too far. He was being as sociable as he could be, under the circumstances. Fortunately, he was saved from having to elaborate by the ringing of the front door bell.
“Shot in the dark. Good one, though,” Sherlock grinned. “It was the power connection; tiny little scuff marks around the edge of it. Every night he goes to plug it in to charge but his hands are shaking. You never see those marks on a sober man’s phone; never see a drunk’s without them.” He drained his coffee cup and glanced about at the empty lounge car. “There you go, you see. You were right.”
Sherlock's phone buzzed in his hand. “Mycroft, someone else is calling—I don't recognize the number.”
"Quite," Sherlock said sincerely. And then, in the same tone, "but I will hunt you down if you ever hurt her, do you understand me young man?"
She was leading her old crowd and the mother and child down to the stables. The stable hand jumped to attention.
It took him three blocks to catch up with Kitty, who was wearing a pair of Mrs. Hudson's trainers (tighter than hers, it would help support her ankle, stupid
Kitty, on the other hand, knew full well that the Inspector hated Katy Perry (oh, how John wished now that he hadn't let that slip), and started singing her latest song at the top of her lungs.
“I study pain,” the Count said. “It’s a fascinating subject; we all experience it, but we don’t want to look directly at it. I’m writing what I expect will be the defining work on the subject.”
“We already know that he doesn’t. He never would have let her leave alive, and Riley clearly knows more than you about Jamiarty.”
“They kept it quiet. All she ever wanted was a child.” Sherlock’s voice was softer than Janine had ever heard. “She told me when Jamiarty brought me to the palace for the first time. She really wants…wanted grand children.”
Luckily, Anderson’s spies worked quickly, and they spread out across the castle, asking Jamiarty’s advice on a hundred little tasks. It must have been fun, because Sherlock was grinning when he rejoined John at sunset.
“Looks like you’ll be getting what you want after all,” Sherlock said. Despite her initial gratitude, the two of them had spent most of their time together sniping at each other. Sherlock guessed it was because Sally was afraid he knew about her strictly forbidden dalliances with the idiotic guard Anderson. He did indeed know, but he hadn’t found a moment yet to tell her that of course he wouldn’t reveal that. The penalty was death, and as irritating as she was, the other Carriers were far worse.
Sherlock waited breathless, shaking, hoping that this was real, hoping this wasn’t another cruel dream. When John reached him, he reached out and grabbed hold of his hands, holding the bouquet between them. John smiled at him, eyes overbright, and passed his bouquet to Grezzik.
“They are aware I didn’t kidnap Sherlock, right?” He would never let Sherlock’s royal title pass his lips, not ever.
Jacob was already at Sherlock’s side, chattering about the latest explosion he’d caused in class. The glee in Rachel’s eyes reminded John to warn Kitty that her daughter needed to be kept away from baking soda and vinegar (at the very least).
Sally faced her father. “Do I…do I kneel?” She wasn’t there when Jamiarty was made Heir, and had only heard stories of how this ceremony went.
Before her mother dies, Molly gets up the courage to ask her about how her father died. She’s not at all surprised to hear her mother made a desperate attempt to protect her. She’s just surprised that the police let them go.
They arranged to meet up once Watson and Sherlock returned. John continued to read and Holmes finally succeeded in
Sherlock thought this over. “I am interested,” he said carefully, “but not because I particularly relish the details. I am interested because your past is part of you, and I am beginning to realize it shaped you in ways I did not consider.”
Another woman stepped forward. Her red dress was almost as long as her hair, and her eyes were intense, as sharp as knives. “You’re Sally, are you?”
John tensed, yanking himself away from Moriarty. To his surprise, Moriarty let him do it, let John step away until they were several feet apart.
“Well, we can fix that! There’s a small county named London. It hasn’t had a Princess in a long time.”
"We're going to take good care of them, sweet," she promised. "We'll make them comfortable, and then...well, then we'll see."
Prince Jamiarty grabbed him, yanked him into his arms and ran down the hall to Sherlock’s room. “That was a mistake,
“She brought a small sack.” Moran sighed. “But it was really quite small, perhaps large enough to hold an apple? I don’t believe that would be helpful.”
Mycroft strode over, the others following. “That should do nicely, John. Now we’ll have to make this quick, because I have a notion that my sailors want to see the whole thing.”
By the time the Council had convened, Riley had changed her clothes back into her Guard uniform. Her face was often cited as ‘too pretty to be a guard’, but those who spoke to her knew that the pretty face concealed a poison tongue. No one wanted to be on Riley’s bad side, so everyone tried to be friends with her.
"I can't bear to think of missing her life," he confided to John over the punch bowl. He was holding a picture of the baby, with clouds of blonde hair and her father's huge green eyes. "I mean I get it, people balance jobs and kids, but Margie's job pays quite well, and I'm thinking if I stay home with her then we'll save on childcare, won't we?"
That bought him a few seconds of Sherlock panting, hands gripping onto John’s so tight that it hurt.
“Oh, it was with myself. Before I proposed to your Dad.” Sherlock ran his fingers over John’s wedding ring.
“I’m…I’m fine.” It was the rain, of course. The rain pouring down outside, the rain that had soaked through Watson’s shirt…that’s all it was. Making him hear things.
Watson placed the last of the sweet peas in the ground and looked up. “Sherlock, they’ll be here soon!”
Grezzik tried to shake the man off, but he wasn’t budging. He backed into a rock as hard as he could, but the man in black wouldn’t let go. In fact, his arms started to tighten.
When we returned from court Mrs. Hudson met us at the door. She informed us that we had a visitor. My husband did not seem surprised, which intrigued me. Mrs. Hudson withdrew to the kitchen, promising tea in an hour, and we ascended the stairs together.
Jamiarty considered that. “Unusual. But of course, if that’s what you wish. Sally, you will care for our children.”
The train to Sussex took an interminable amount of time. Watson tried to sleep, but he was too excited, as was Holmes, who kept glaring at the telegraph lines as though they were responsible for their speed.
And with that, Stam slipped out of the room. The others would get along fine without him; after all, he’d never left Florin in his life.
It was strange to think that it was Watson who’d taught him to want in the first place, and how so many of the things he wanted now were out of reach. Hopelessly, fantastically out of reach.
“Yeah. Molly was very kind and got me an exam so we won’t be wasting any time—I’m fertile enough that it hopefully won’t take too many tries. We started looking through potential donors today.”
It was strange—it wasn't as though either he or Sherlock were virgins, and they'd made love plenty of times before getting married. Why would this night be any different? Other than John potentially falling asleep in the middle, that is.
There were options, of course—nurses, a home, doctors to see if treatment was possible. The family talked long into the night about those options, and at last they came to the decision that there would be no fighting this particular war. John was a doctor, and Sherlock was one of the brightest people on the planet. They knew that whatever was coming, it couldn't be stopped.
They fell silent then. The only sound in the caravan were the sounds of the King and Queen snoring quietly.
“The Count began it,” Stam said as he opened the secret door, the path that skipped all of the poor creatures kept for Jamiarty’s amusement. “But the Prince finished it.”
“I thought she might be worth something to Sally and Anderson alive.” Molly’s eyes were fierce, but her hands were gentle when she stroked the baby’s head. “Hello, little one. It’s good to see you safe.”
Ireni stepped forward. She spoke three sharp, quick words, and Jamiarty slumped forward, unconscious.
Princess Savira of Archenland had come on behalf of her husbands Roc and Rilian. She had the long hair of her people, but her purple eyes told of her Regalian heritage.
Mike cleared his throat. “I now pronounce you husbands.” He grinned as he paused for another moment; John glared at him indignantly. “Alright, you can snog if you want.”
“Sherlock, we can trust him. We could trust Rachel, for heaven’s sake. Why not a boy who’s proven himself worthy of a secret?”
The news that John had managed to take the last boat to America before the winter seas became too rough. The news that the boat was called
If John was writing the story of their honeymoon (which he was never, never, never going to do, not in any level of detail, no matter how much people had been asking) he would have drawn a blank over the next hour of customs, luggage collecting, taxi finding, and to-the-hotel-travelling. It was bad enough for him to experience it once. At least he wasn't so tired now.
She couldn’t lose that purpose now. It was all that was keeping her alive, all that was propelling her, maybe, someday, towards the six-fingered man.
“I have every faith in you, Seb,” Prince Jamiarty said warmly. He’d always liked Seb, the best and most faithful of his hounds. Sure, Magnussen was fun, but he had complete and utter trust in Moran. “It’s a shame you’ll miss the wedding.”
“Jamiarty murdered her, because she was his half-sister,” John said bluntly. “His other sister is Sally, and we need to protect her claiming the throne by proving the murder.”
“Yes...well, the point is that the title would do nothing for me financially nor socially. If anything, it might damage my reputation, as it insinuates that I am somehow better than my circle of informants and acquaintances.”
“I haven’t listened to it since our first dance,” Janine said. “I couldn’t bear to hear it. And now that you’re back…I’m worried you’ll go away.”
Watson swallowed. “That is my worst fear,” he said quietly. “We do everything we can to keep up appearances, to give no scrap of conversation nor deed that could substantiate such a rumour. We have done so for six months, and none has questioned us.”
“Of course there isn’t,” Miracle Max stumbled over his words. “True love is the best thing there is, except for MLTs. You know, mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwiches? But that’s not what he said! He said ‘to blave’, which means to bluff! So you were probably playing games, and he cheated—”
“I’ll stay with you, Grezzik,” Sally said, picking up a sleeping Waverly. “I need to stretch my legs.”
“We want to help you, so you will help us. We want to storm the castle so I can kill Count Magnussen, the six-fingered man. And we want to steal the Princess, because we fear that the Prince means to kill him.”
Sherlock held John close, his chest tightening with every breath, every sob. "Please don't leave me," he whispered.
His grandfather pulled him into a tight hug, and Billy was pleased to see that he didn’t let go of Grandfather John’s hand to do so. “Thank you, child,” he whispered.
“Don’t bother me with trifles. After twenty years I have a name and a way to him. There will be blood tonight!”
“Oh, I’m just getting started,” Ireni replied. “Because iocane comes from Australia, and Australia is entirely peopled with criminals and crocodiles, both creatures who are used to having people not trust them so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you!”
“Of course, my dear fellow.” Holmes sat on the sofa, and I did the same. “So you have decided to remain in London then, Miss Winter?”
Sherlock raised his eyebrows as he searched John's face intently. "You...you don't actually believe that, do you?"
Kitty rolled her eyes. "Don't pity me, Doctor. You haven't even heard my story yet, and you're already looking down on me."
Holmes took the bandage away as if Watson had burned him. “I thought I should sanitize it,” he explained, his shaking lips betraying his worry.
“No. I’ve always been strong.” Even his parents had always told him that he was so strong, so good at what he could do with his body, that there was no need to think.
That made little to no sense. But then again, nothing was making sense today. Sherlock allowed his head to drop against Grezzik’s shoulder, and decided that he was going to try and get all his thinking done. He doubted he’d have much more time.
Sherlock saw John kneel in front of him, and grinned. It was all he could do to hold Jamiarty down; the Prince was straining with all his force. John put his hands over Sherlock’s, and the pressure eased.
Watson opened the door. To his surprise it opened on a staircase leading down. It was a perfectly ordinary set of stairs, similar to the ones outside his old bedroom, but somehow...different. The wallpaper had certainly changed.
Quick glossary of musical terms: arpeggios are the notes of a chord played in order, pizzicato is plucking the violin strings instead of using a bow, and atonal just means ‘not written in a key’, and usually sounds out of place in a song (not always, please don’t murder me music student/ musician readers).
The Summer Palace was as beautiful as Sally remembered. It was a low building, only one story sprawling over nearly a mile, and the stained glass almost sparkled in the dawn. Where there was stone, it was marble, polished and carved with the royal crest.
Also, on another light note, I need help deciding about the opposite of defenestration! The three options in last chapter's titles are the contenders judging from reddit and Yahoo, so if people can tell me which they like best (or propose an alternative) that would be super helpful.
Then he got it. Stupid of him, really, he should know the signs by now. It hadn't been that long since his own last one. "Are you having fragmented vision?"
“Watson.” Now that he was here, Sherlock felt foolish. Why was he here? Why was he so interested in this simple boy’s crush on him?
Grezzik slipped the oars into the water, yanked the rope from the dock (and part of the pole, but that couldn’t be helped), and they were off.
“No point bringing this little girl into the world only to die, right?” Ireni looked at Molly. “I suppose I still owe you a boon. What would you like?”
John studied her for a moment. "You're about the same size as a friend of ours. Her name's Molly, and we trust her completely. Would it be alright if I asked her to bring you some clothes?"
She was right, but there was nothing wrong with the document Moran extended to her. It was all legal, all binding. But Jamiarty knew how careful the Princess of Gondor and the Duke of London were about contracts. So he’d written it extra long, plenty of time for Riley to sneak from the boat into the castle behind Moran, and begin her search for the baby.
“Always good to hear the sot speak!” Ireni got in her face. “This isn’t your business. It’s mine, and I only provide the best results. Now, are you going to help, or are you going to go back to being too drunk to afford brandy?”
Anderson bowed his head. “Before we were together, Sally. I was a spy, I needed information. And she was always so cold about it. We spent a lot of time together, but she always refused romance and…and kindness. She just wanted to talk and fuck.”
“Really? Odd. Oh well.” Jamiarty rose. “I need to go. We’re getting this wedding over with as quickly as possible.”
“No, my husband’s. Philip.” Suddenly Sally couldn’t wait another moment. “Your Majesty? Could I speak to you alone?”
Sherlock nodded as he hit sent. "My big brother. He will make sure, that there won't be any evidence left." Sherlock didn't mention, that he would probably have to solve three boring cases, of national importance, as payment. Considering, that there was an actual body here this time ,Sherlock might even have to take their parents to a musical in London. One evening, of listening to his mother, telling him what a beautiful woman he could have been, sounded horrible. But Sherlock was willing to endure it, if it meant that John would walk free.
For a long second, Martha entertained the idea of pouring the contents of another jar directly onto Mrs Miller’s terrible, brown hat. The look of utter horror on her face would have almost made up for the waste of such perfectly made honey. Luckily for her neighbour though, Martha wasn’t one for such petty revenge. “If you use that honey for the next
Sherlock winced at the loud exclamation, but continued his explanations. "You have killed twelve men in total, four of which you raped before blowing their heads off. I just haven't figured out why you did that. Is it for sexual satisfaction? Wasn't killing them enough anymore? Is that why you switched from targeting totally average men to young and handsome ones? I would really like to know, before..." Sherlock stopped midsentence. He couldn't finish his own thoughts. He had always told everyone that his body was only transport for him, but it wasn't true. At least not when it came to
Sherlock noticed it, as soon as he stepped over the threshold into the flat. A coat, on the coat rack, shoes orderly next to each other: John was home. His eyes searched the living-room for a steaming mug of tea, but there was none to be found. Instead the shower was running in the bathroom, indicating that John had strayed from his usual post work routine. Usually, he preferred to sit down with a cup of tea and a book before he took a shower. Sherlock frowned. Strange, but maybe a patient had spit on him, which would explain the need for a shower.
"Hey there," John's gentle voice put an end to Sherlock's self-reproaches. "I am not blaming you, for not catching them. It's just," John sighed heavily. "When you told me why you didn't want to go to the police, I realised again why it was so hard to convict such people. It's not only that the victims are often too ashamed to go to the police, but also that most rapists don't get the sentence they deserve. They either go free or they get a couple of years, tops. It's damn rare to see them locked up behind bars for more than five years. And when you told me that these bastards were rich, I knew that they would never be convicted so I... shot them."
"Alright," John shrugged off his clothes, until he was left standing in his pants and shirt and climbed into bed next to Sherlock, "But you tell me if you are uncomfortable."
Sherlock shook his head at the idea. It had occurred to him as well, but the chances were high that John wouldn't tell him the truth even if Sherlock asked.
