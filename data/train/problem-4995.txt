"I'll leave you to it," Steve said, recalling his earlier smile to his face.  "Thanks for having dinner with me."
"If you weren't damn near dehydrated before the plane crashed, we wouldn't have to do this," Rhodey said, picking up an old argument between them.
She rolled to the side in the air as another blast went by her, heeding the warning Tony put up on the HUD.  She banked around the train and took down the last two soldiers.  As she flew by, she could see the human skin they'd been wearing changing to a darker color.  At least they were hitting the right train.  The Skrulls were so entrenched in the government now that mistaken identity was a definite concern, one Susan worried about a lot.
"Thought you weren't that kind of doctor, Jade Jaws," Iron Man said.  Steve tried hard not to imagine the easy going smile he could hear in Iron Man's voice.
"There's not enough room for both of us in that bed." Steve's voice was trembling, but he was moving to the space Tony had cleared.
Steve missed whatever Ms. Rhodes said, keeping Tony steady.  He felt a smile creeping up on him as relief released his own tense shoulders.
"It is when I got two spies bitching about Captain America being passive-aggressive when he sulks," Fury replied.  "I'd rather not know, but you have a habit of pissing off people in my social circle."
A favor from the cleaning staff?  Not the first time?  Steve was a little appalled at the numbers adding up to a crooked philanderer.  His thoughts flashed back to that gossip rag and Steve flushed.  "I don't think..."
He hesitated before he took off.  The last time he did this, he ended up with a headache. But if he kept it short...  Tony closed his eyes and focused on Steve until he could see the temple courtyard.  The muzzle lay on the ground, with enough distance between it and Steve that it had probably been thrown.  It was still too close for Tony's comfort.
"I'm betting on her," Ms. Potts said with an apologetic wave to Steve.  "And so are you.  Stop making Captain Rogers nervous."
"Don't know why you bother asking," Sam said, and there was a murmur of laughter through the dragons.  "You can't scare us away if you tried, Steve."
With his mouth freed, Tony rolled his eyes.  "It's fine Steve.  I've had worse than pricking my finger.  It's not even the first time I've done it today."
Natasha raised an eyebrow.  "I'm not going to like what you've got planned, am I?" she said, though she detailed a few general contingencies for him.
"Why do you want to talk to him?" Ms. Potts asked.  "'Ms. Rushman' has vouched for you, and though we've come to terms on a lot of things and I trust Natasha well enough now, I still don't trust her with Mr. Stark.  So why are you trying to meet with him?"
The arc reactor was a problem.  It shouldn't be, because Tony had had one in his chest for almost two years and it had worked fine then.  ...Aside from the whole palladium poisoning thing, but he'd gotten that fixed eventually.  But now the elements weren't forming right and the alloys were too brittle.  Why couldn't he think clearly and get this done?
Tony couldn't help the flinch at that, his body acting the traitor.  Steve swore.  "No, I don't mean... the fact that you like guys doesn't bother me, Tony."
"Alright.  I'll be up in a few minutes," Steve said, stacking the folders carefully on his desk.  He headed to the elevator, then thought better of it, walking to the kitchen instead.  "JARVIS, how does Tony take his coffee?" he asked, figuring if Pepper could inquire, he probably had access to the information too.
"There," Tony said, pulling his hand back once Steve finished.  "You've done your patriotic duty to patch up a wounded team mate.  You can go be heroic elsewhere."
"Just make sure it's a slow dance," Tony said.  "Without the helmet, I can't go too fast without blacking out."
"He's faking," Tony said, answering the former, if not the one weighing heavier on Steve's mind.  "He's not-"
Tony concentrated on breathing in and out now that pain screamed in his ears like a banshee.  One breath at a time.  Freezing air dragged along his burning lungs, making it hard to draw another breath, puffing out in front of him to taunt him of his lost warmth.
"Shh...  We'll be back at the air ship soon," Rhodey said as they stepped out of the cave.  It was night, Tony realized with a start that felt like a dagger right through his heart pump.  The sky was clear and the stars were-
"But they were there!" Tony insisted, panicking.  His hands tightened around the sheets.  "They had - not magic.  Some kind of energy transference that could heal and Hydra was there too, trying to wake up a real hydra.  Viper - Madame Hydra - she's-"
Then Steve gave him what Tony could only call the mental equivalent of a hug.  It was warm like laying in the grass on a sunny summer's day and Tony had to stomp down on the wistful longing.
"You make a good romantic heroine," Jan said,  giggling at his antics.  "His love is one-sided, of course, because even evil, my heart is only for Hank, but I can feel sorry enough for him to use his romantic feelings for me for Evil."
"It's the only way!  And they're safer there than-" Iron Man started to say, then stopped.  "You know what?  Never mind."
The suit wrapped around him as the guns went off, and he immediately brought up a repulsor to fire.  There was more yelling and Tony could barely stay upright with the armor's momentum.
"Don't worry, I'll make sure Dr. Pym stays inside," Tony said, winking down at the butterfly.  "Though he likes ants better.  No accounting for taste.  But I could take you someplace nice.  We could go to Malibu or Mexico.  Just you and me, honey, and I'll show you some real flying."
"You, on the other hand," Tony interrupted.  "Everything special about you came out of a bottle.  You-"
"Carol is going to save me from the mind control through the power of female friendship," Jan said, raising her hand.  Carol high-fived her.  "But ooooh, my muse is speaking to me now.  Tony, stop production!  I need to redesign."
"And years would be too late," Steve said with growing horror.  "He's... He'll just go in the portal to get it?  He's a civilian!"
," Leo said, struggling to stand on his own.  "You think I don't know that the only reason they kept me alive was to keep Kes from acting out?  And now I can't even do the one thing I was good at, being Cap.  If that's not useless then-"
"Yes, Ma'am," Tony said, hiding a smile as he slowly walked around her wings.  He hesitated when he got to her neck, wondering how to do this.  There were spikes up to the joints in her shoulder blades that he could hold on to, but nothing after that.  It wouldn't be comfortable either.  He'd been bare-backing before and it usually never ended well for his rear end.  He had a nice rear end, but he refused to go without preparation in general.
She changed it to polka dots rather than answer.  He glanced at his free hand.  "Better," he said, then sat down beside her again.  "Now remember, no telling Cap about this.  I'll get in massive amounts of trouble and you won't get anymore."
But what had...  Unless Tony liked being near the Avengers?  The thought was both cute and sobering, considering how much the Avengers took for granted when it came to Tony Stark.  Steve resolved to see this through again.  Getting through to Tony might be hard, but it was working, and Steve found that he wanted it a lot more now that he'd started to get to know him.
Sparring sounded amazing, actually.  "Yeah, let's." She finished her milk and hopped off the stool to put on the armor but froze when she saw who was in the doorway.  "Leo?"
Tony wouldn't look, not at this.  Already he had gone too far, playing back every small touch and kiss.  "This isn't real.  You never loved me."
"The damn bastard had us so worried that he better not die now or I will chase his sorry ass down to hell just to give him a piece of my mind!"
"We can figure it out once you've slept," Rhodey said reasonably.  Tony hated it when he was being reasonable.  God forbid he and Peggy ever-
When her tears finally dried, she focused on the feel of Tony's fingers running through her hair.  "You're just code..."
"They could be," the other man said.  "If you actually gave them a chance.  Nothing's going to change if you keep avoiding them like this."
"Can I ask why, sir?" Steve said, feeling it was a bit odd that Fury was asking him instead of Clint.
Steve claimed Tony's lips again as he carefully lowered him down, memorizing the feel of Tony's smile against his.
It wasn't long before the cave opened up to a proper cavern, the ceiling at least 100 feet high and covered with crystals.  There were some pits that the dragons had obviously mined from, but also crystals that were still within easy reach.  The dragons only took what they needed and Tony was glad for that.  "Should be quick enough," Tony said, raising the gauntlet to fire.
"Ah, hell."  Tony fired the repulsors at the massive, ugly beast.  It had three heads!  Weren't they only supposed to start with one?  What idiot had cut off the first two?  He aimed for the eyes, shooting it straight through the head as he also fired with the repulsors.  The hydra dodged the repulsors, but the guns were lethally effective.  Too lethal.  The head hung from the neck limply for a moment and Tony caught his breath.  Did it work?
Steve immediately placed the tray on the table and ignored his own hunger to crouch down beside Tony.  He didn't touch the man, but he wanted to.  He wished he knew how Tony would react to it.  He could keep Tony from hurting either of them easily, but from what Tony had babbled about that first day in Afghanistan, the last thing he needed was to be restrained.
That was a lesson which had been brought home painfully.  His return smile was brittle and bitter.  "Of course I can't," he agreed.
"Nah, I'm good," Tony said, waving it off.  "We can skedaddle, or whatever old time-y phrase you'd use."
Blinking to try clearing the haze that was falling over his thoughts, Steve shook his head.  There was no immediate danger that he could see, so he'd deal with that later.  "Tony?" he asked, looking down at the man in his arms.
And no, contrary to what the Avengers thought, Steve was not sulking about either of those two things.
"It's good enough," Tony reassured him.  "Just stay.  I still have to show you the stars, remember?  Real stars.  Not just the ones in my memories.  We can even go dancing when they're out one night.  You can't miss it."
The Avengers alarm blared, causing both of them to jump.  "We'll finish this later," Steve promised.
" Steve said.  Tony started, looking around for Steve before he remembered the bond.  Damn, the headache was getting worse if he couldn't even remember that.
"It won't be your fault, Steve," Natasha said with a shrug.  "Stark is exceptionally good at pressing buttons, and given that you were friends with his father, odds are he will try to push them."
Steve seemed to know about Tony's blush regardless of his limited vision, the smug bastard, and he was dead set on making it worse.  In revenge, Tony started to pet Steve's hair, running his fingers through the course strands.  It wasn't the same as feeling the hard horns and soft scales, or having Steve's tail wrapped around him as he leaned against Steve's flank.  It was a warm night though, and Steve's mind was still there, open and inviting, with a fond stubbornness that filled up the parts he was missing.
He realized his mistake far too late.  He barely saw Tony's hand darting out before his phone was stolen.  He half-stood, then remembered why standing was a bad idea and quickly sat back down.  "Tony," Steve said, his voice thick with disapproval.
He wanted to curl up in her lap and let her pet his hair, but there wasn't enough room and the chair was no where near that comfortable.  He was a bit glad when she leaned against his shoulder and rested her head on him, since it gave him the physical contact he craved.
Leon settled under Tony's hand carding through his hair.  He'd done that with James, Steve remembered with a pang, right before leaning down to kiss him good night.  The memories of their children were still difficult to go through, but Steve couldn't help a soft sigh at the sight.
"Fine," Tony said, wiping up the last of the sauce with a kind of steamed bread that the dragons liked to eat for desert.  One thing he'd say about dragon cuisine was that they did have some amazing sauces.  "Something up?"
In the next few days Steve saw very little of Tony and none of Iron Man.  The latter was disappointing but understandable, given the flurry of activity between the scientists of the group.  Turned out that Doom did want in, but only so far.  Steve wasn't surprised to find that Victor von Doom preferred to let them do the dirty work while he stayed out of it beyond lending some technical expertise.  He didn't like needing Doom, but from what Bruce had said, he'd been very helpful so far.
"You're doing nothing wrong," Steve said, his voice gentle.  "The city is destroyed, but its people are safe.  There
It was slow going, especially considering that he didn't want to bring the rocks down on him by moving the wrong one, but he felt like he had made progress.  By the time his stomach reminded him of lunch, he'd cleared a small section away, stacking the excess rocks carefully to the side.  He didn't notice they were hiding the murals.
"I go to the surface sometimes," she admitted.  "But the way is blocked now and people up there were not kind."
Tony was frozen, and Steve couldn't do a damned thing.  He couldn't help with the science, he couldn't punch time and expect it to start again.  He couldn't even keep searching like Howard had all those years ago.  "Hey, Shellhead," Steve said, his voice cracking.  With no one there to hear, he didn't care.  "We're gonna figure something out.  I promise."
Tony closed his eyes for a moment, then opened them as he pulled away.  He caught a faint sense of disappointment, but he caught Steve's head gently, rubbing the dragon's cheeks with both hands then scratching behind the horn.  The disappointment was quick to disappear, and Steve closed his eyes in pleasure.  "I'm sorry," Tony said.  "That's just how we humans are.  We're not... we're not that open or honest."
"If I must."  Steve leaned into the touch once more before resting again.  "The stars better be all you've made them out to be, Mister.  I've been waiting... so long to..."
Natasha swore, and beside her, Tony could hear Bruce growling.  Out of the corner of his eye, he could see the illusion flinch.  "Of course you would," Bruce muttered darkly.  "Never mind patient privacy."
"Stark, let us handle this," Steve pleaded, his voice closer and gentler.  "JARVIS says you've got something in your system.  Leave him to us, Shellhead."
Tony watched as confusion won over the frustration on Steve's face, probably reacting to the emotions Tony was too angry to hide.  He stepped forward, trying to capture Tony's hand, but Tony slapped his hand away.  "Tony-"
Steve winced, then crossed his arms over his chest.  "Those aren't the only two things I think about."
Steve swore under his breath.  Of all the times to go AWOL.  "Thank you, JARVIS," he said before cutting the connection, because it really wasn't JARVIS's fault and Steve had regained enough piece of mind to remember to be polite.
Steve quickly took inventory of how many times he'd drifted off during the actual 'business' parts of their lunches and came to the conclusion Tony might have made a few incorrect conclusions about Steve's occasional distractions.
"That doesn't make you a terrible person, princess," Tony said, pulling her back into a hug.  "That just makes you human."
"Old habits die hard," Stark said with a shrug, sitting next to him on the floor.  His eyes had an honest enough look about them that made Steve wonder.  He took a pull from his flash, then offered what was in his other hand to Steve.  That wasn't a flask, but the bottle Tony used to refill it.
" Steve asked, his eyes going wide again.  Tony was wearing the same t-shirt and jeans as the last time he'd seen the man, but this time there was glowing white circle in his chest that shone through the shirt.
Wanda didn't answer.  She turned to the side, blowing out a small flame along the wall.  It caught on a ledge Tony hadn't seen, fire spreading around the cavern's parameter like wild fire with some unknown fuel that was too high for him to peer at.
"No."  Petulance didn't really begin to cover Steve's half-asleep tone.  His tail was wrapped firmly around Tony's waist and his wing came up to hide Tony entirely from view.
Steve dove down onto Sam's back, claws ripping into his shoulders.  In return Sam folded his wings and let them drop at least fifty feet, spinning mid air to throw Steve off.  Sam went in, fangs bared at Steve's neck.
When the nurses finally left, Tony was sitting up, his back braced against pillows.  His leg wasn't broken, but the gash down the side of it would take a while to heal and could leave a scar.  He'd been lucky it stopped bleeding, or he could have died from blood loss.  The worst of his concussion was already passed, and he had a few broken and cracked ribs.  His throat was still a little painful, but he assumed he only had himself to blame for that and that the dust he'd been breathing in wouldn't have any lasting consequences.  The IV was because he'd been a bit dehydrated before the battle, and the anxiety of being trapped under a building had apparently done him no favors in that regard, but even that would be taken out soon.  In short, everything was hunky-dory.  A-okay.  Perfectly-perfect with a bit of rest and pain-killers.
They also had no use for cloth in dragon society, as Sharon had pointed out earlier.  Tony realized the implications of this when he was shown to a bed, a large stone dais that was a little too hot and too uncomfortable.  Tony pretended to be agreeable, hiding behind his mental walls to lie, and waited for his kind hosts to leave.
Steve reached out to touch Tony's cheek, telegraphing the move so Tony wouldn't flinch.  It was still taking some adjusting to, these casual intimacies.  "Aright," Steve said, pulling out some sort of paper (it wasn't an animal skin, but the material didn't look like trees either.  Tony decided to ask for some later for better analysis) from the basket.  All thoughts of the material it was made from left Tony when he saw the drawings.
.  He struck below the belt and struck hard, and Steve almost believed the sentiment on bad days.  The serum should have been able to save Bucky, but he'd failed and...
"Magic," Steve agreed cheerfully.  And magic saw fit to make Steve from Brooklyn, of all places.  "I think when I was trying to fix your heart, the magic must have seen the sacrifice.  They say the deep magic works best with sacrifice and you...  Well, Wanda did say there was hope.  I wonder if she knew."
"It's to get medicine," Steve said, his voice tight.  Tony could have at least given him some warning, but that was neither here nor there.  They could talk about it later.
Peggy flared her nostrils and wrapped her tail around him gently.  "I thought you were making your own destiny?" she said, her voice fond.  "I shouldn't worry about such things.  They will come if we worry or not, so don't listen to me."
Definitely Tony.  Tony had been there at the start of the gala to kick things off, but Steve realized he hadn't seen the other man in a while.  He stood, walking towards the sound of Tony's voice and peering around the corner.  Who was Tony talking to?
Susan was stopped by the finger on her lips, but Kes still wasn't looking at her.  If anything, Kes looked more hurt.  "You did perfectly," Kes said, stepping back and looking at her hand like she'd burnt it.
"Having problems with primitive technology?" Steve asked softly enough that his voice wouldn't carry to Iron Man.
"There was a disturbance in the north plains we had to check out," Steve said unhappily, looking Tony over as he slowly de-tangled himself from the adventurer.  "Something happened to you."
The free fall was everything Steve loved in life.  The adrenaline, the air rushing around him, and the open sky made Steve regret needing the chute, but there was no water down there and even
The pain in his chest receded to a stinging burn, which was promising.  Now all he had to worry about was a sprained ankle and a few aching ribs. Without the pain of his heart running out of power, he would venture to guess his ribs were just bruised, maybe fractured.
Tony laughed.  "Yeah, I'll pass on being a third wheel in that cabin.  Figures.  We get caught up in a plane crash and the pilots get sex out of it, while we just get frostbite and you end up breaking your leg."
"She was the one who urged me to go up and actually talk to you when we first met as humans," Steve continued, his hand squeezing Tony's shoulder.  "Some of the other men are scared of her, but when she's in our camp, she smiles more."
"I'm heading out in an hour or two to try and find intel on Clint and Natasha," he said, pulling at the neck of the uniform.  He had the cowl down since he was still in the Tower, and a few minutes ago that was comfortable.  But now he couldn't hide his nerves behind it and his Captain America persona, and he wasn't entirely sure how to talk to this man.  Rhodey was a superior officer, but also one of Tony's closest friends.  There was a middle ground out there somewhere, but Steve would probably stumble a lot trying to find it.  "I wanted to sit with him a while before I left.  I don't know when I'll be back."
"Completely out of time!" Iron Man said.  "It'd be like you never existed!  Steve, Hydra would - Ah!"
Steve pulled out his phone and typed a simple message to warn Iron Man he was coming, then started walking through the trees.  Was that how everyone saw Tony Stark?  It was how he'd seen the man before he'd really talked to him, and it made him a little sick to remember.  He wondered how many other celebrities got this sort of treatment.  There'd always been the yellow press and gossip columns on socialites like Howard or movie stars, but with the spread of technology everything seemed worse.
Steve bent down again and after a moment's hesitation, Tony nodded.  As Steve rubbed against his cheek, Tony could feel the dragon's guilt slipping through.  "I'm sorry I wasn't there earlier.  There was no time to tell you and you were too far..."
"Think my leg got broken on the way down," Steve said, his voice quiet and low like he was finally making an effort to sound normal once anyone showed even a speck of worry.
Tony closed his eyes, unable to look at them as Rhodey fired the thrusters.  It started to get colder, even with the motor warmed metal, but Tony didn't care.  He didn't open them again until the wind cut off and he knew he was inside the airship.
"Strange girl," he said to himself.  Not quite his type, but not a bad sort either.  Still, her words stuck with him through the journey back.  It couldn't have been Steve's clan that killed her parents and gave her that scar.  But how much did he really know about the dragons anyway?  They may just be acting at being such an open society, or are only truly open with other dragons...
It was cold.  The wind bit at his ears and cheeks even as he reached out as far as he could.  It wasn't enough.  "Hang on, Bucky," he said as he tried to inch closer.
"Captain?" Stark said in a tone that meant it wasn't the first repetition.  "Earth to Captain Rogers!"
Clint, for his part, looked longingly at Bruce's tea, then up at Natasha.  She raised an eyebrow.  "Cruel, Nat.  I don't rate high enough in your affections?"
Tony pulled the release catch, letting the suit open up so he could step out.  It'd be a pain to get on again, but Steve's relief came through clearly after that.  Maybe he should just leave the suit behind the gate from now on.  "It bothers you that much?" Tony asked.
Tony stood, uncertain if he was going to bolt or agree.  Steve seemed to be wondering the same, if the way he was watching Tony was anything to go by.  But Tony's feet seemed to move forward of their own accord, and soon he was in front of Steve.  He leaned over until their noses were almost brushing, his hands planted on the table on either side of Steve as Tony boxed him in.  "This is what you want?" Tony asked, shivering slightly at the lack of space.  "Are you sure it's still not the wrong time?"
"Are you certain this is wise, my friend?" Thor asked, his voice grave.  "I know you and Iron Man have argued of late, but this is a line you may not be able to come back from."
This time Pepper put more effort into calming down.  "I don't know why I'm acting like this.  I was fine before.  I flew all the way here and I was fine.  But now... Oh, my God."
Smiling at Rhodey's unspoken question, Steve motioned that he would be alright.  He left then, letting them have a moment.  He closed the door and leaned against it, closing his eyes.  Tony was okay.
After that, Tony just wanted to let Steve curl around him and never leave again.  He shook his head, petting Steve's neck.  "It was intense," Tony said.
Steve didn't have time to marvel at a computer program that could sound like that.  "Take me down to the workshop now," he said before the elevator doors closed.
Tony stopped, even when Steve tried pulling him forward.  He stared ahead, not looking at Steve.  He clenched his hands into fists and closed his eyes.
"I've never lived anywhere else," Steve admitted quietly, and Tony could feel a light bit of shame that came from comparing himself to Tony's travels, which baffled Tony.  There was also a fear in Steve's voice that Tony hated, and an acceptance that Tony refused to believe.  "If the city falls-"
Steve stepped back again, trying to avoid her over-powering perfume that nearly had him gagging.  "No, thank you," he said just as politely as he had the first time.  "But I would appreciate it if you stopped propositioning me after I've already told you no.  If you don't stop, I'll have to escort you off the premises."
Steve ignored them both.  "We can also talk to the merchandising arm of the Avengers.  I know we have some.  We can put out more stuff for female heroes.  Tony can even do a press conference."
"Dragons do not use 'cloth'," Steve said apologetically.   "The last human slept on the ground level with a make-shift shelter."
He made room for Natasha to sit on the bench and Clint leaned against the wall, arms folded over his chest.  "Whatever's going on, Doom is our only lead," Clint said.  "Which sucks, by the way."
Steve paused at that, then got out the blend JARVIS spoke of.  That explained why Tony and Colonel Rhodes had come down here that night of their argument.  It was a weird quirk, but he supposed billionaires were entitled to be a little eccentric.
Tony felt his eyes widen.  He frowned, searching his memories.  Of course he wouldn't lose interest.  He had to pay attention to details like that, because often in temples they held warnings for traps or clues to the artifact he was after.  And the dragon history had been fascinating.  He'd pushed it off the first time as fantasy, but he'd walked along the murals many times since and hadn't given them another thought.  That was...  That was really-
Finally, Tony relaxed and she loosened her grip enough for Tony to wiggle out.  And he did, but not as immediately as Steve had expected (and hoped, just a little, but no, he wasn't thinking about that because Natasha was already on to him and he did
When Steve and Sam were finished, they started snuggling against each other to the point where Tony wondered how he'd ever thought that they were actually fighting.  It made something unpleasant churn in his gut that he tried to ignore.
"I'll have someone posted to take you back to the city," Steve said, though Tony was under the impression Steve would be doing most of the watching himself.
Steve flushed as Tony went back to work.  He had either known all along, or he'd just taken a good guess.  Either way, shame crept along his blush, and he had a sudden urge to put another hole in Tony's wall.  "That's not why I'm here," Steve insisted, or at least tried to.
Steve's lift off was just as startling as Peggy's, but this time Tony was prepared for it.  They glided down at a lazy pace that woke Tony up better than a splash of water on his face.
The snake-man sank back into the water.  Tony started to go after it.  It wasn't the first snake he's killed while swimming.
Which meant that Iron Man probably didn't have blue eyes.  Steve filed that away under the mental file he had on his best friend.  The personal details were extremely sparse, and he hoarded what little he could glean.
Tony looked down, frustrated.  She was right.  The dragons knew the land better than he did and if Viper wanted to stay hidden...  He didn't even know if she'd return to the temple or to a new hide out, one less flashy that she hadn't lead Tony right to.  "I'm sorry," Tony said.  "This is all my fault."
"Not this much," Captain America said.  "And I'm pretty sure eye contact wasn't something you had issues with before either."
Steve looked down at where his sketchbook had fallen.  He'd completely forgotten about it.  Iron Man reached for it before he could, and Steve had a moment of panic.  "Iron -  Tony," he said, stumbling over the name.
,' Steve wanted to say, but again, he couldn't quite find the voice.  "Nothing really important.  Sorry, just..."
"Those are for Stark?" Fury said, frowning.  "Didn't realize he rated special treatment from Captain America."
"You need to at least let me get the fucking glass out of your hand!" Tony almost shouted, but he didn't meet Steve's yes.  "You can yell at me after."
Tony didn't look up, because he knew the expression that was in those blue eyes and he didn't know what to do with that.  "What do you want me to say?" he asked, his shoulders slumping as he stared at his hands.
JARVIS filled him in as he changed and grabbed his shield, racing to the hangar.  The quinjet was prepped just as Tony promised.  Steve wasn't the best pilot, but he was passable.  He also hated flying despite Iron Man walking him through the updated controls and being with him when he first took the helm again.
"Then what was the point of this?  Why come out here?" Steve demanded, lowering his voice at Fury's hushing motion.  "Sir," he added as a softer, but still angry, afterthought.
"Tony was wounded in the fight, and he was out of it for the press conference Coulson had to give.  He went online, once we gave him a tablet, to see the reactions," Rhodey said, quieter.  "In the same article, people would call Tony Stark the Merchant of Death and claim he's backsliding to his old ways while praising Iron Man's heroics.  He didn't want a good thing to be put through the mud just because of his name."
"He appears well, Captain," Thor said, easing some of the worry.  "Iron Man is currently looking over the remains of one of our foes."
"One day, I'll hear you finish a sentence," Cap teased gently.  "But I'm not what you expected, am I?"  There was a self-depreciating smile on his lips.  "I was never as interesting as the press liked to make out."
Steve nodded, knowing exactly which request in his unfinished drafts it was.  He figured he could get away with a shady-looking '
"That's not an answer," Stark said.  Steve just drank the last of the whiskey before Stark stole back the bottle.
It was a bit embarrassing to know his teammates followed his art posts, especially with the 'shippy' requests. Knowing his friends had been viewing his art was a bit worse, but nothing that Steve was really upset over. He just really liked being anonymous. "I should have known you guys would find it," he said, shaking his head.  "I asked the person who was reposting to take it down, but they said they gave me credit and insisted they could leave it up.  I contacted Tumblr about it, but some of my friends on the site say that the staff take forever to respond."
Steve caught Iron Man's - Tony's wrists before he pulled too far away.  "Could you sit with me a bit?" Steve asked, the adrenaline spike from hearing Iron Man's voice waning to the point where he kind of wanted to go back to his nap - he really
"Ms. Castillo was crying in one of the meeting rooms she was supposed to be cleaning two or three years ago," Stark said, looking away.  "I was avoiding Ob- I was avoiding Stane when I found her.   Apparently her ex-boyfriend was an abusive asshole who was threatening to kidnap their daughter and kill anyone in the way, including the other kids at the SI-run daycare.  So I offered to let Gabriella stay in the office with me for the week it took for the police to find him, since it's pretty hard to get through the security to make it up here.  She was five, I think?  She helped me with the paperwork.  I may have also hired the best prosecuting lawyers I could find in the case against him."
"Trying to convince me to get back to posting art?" Steve asked when his voice started to work again.
But the monster's momentum carried it through and Tony could hear its pained roar as it hit the top.  He slowed as much as he could, giving himself a chance to breathe.
Steve's tail carefully uncurled and his wing lifted up so that Tony could see a very worried-looking Peggy and Sam.
Dragons, it turned out, really did not like the taste of cooked meat.  Tony chuckled to himself as he worked, picturing Sharon puffing out fire after swallowing it.  Then the round of apologies from mortified dragons who had picked up the reaction was apparently rude in human cultures from Tony's mind.  He whistled cheerfully as he moved another rock, then blasted a new dent with his repulsors.
Steve started, turning to see Stark hidden in a corner next to the door.  He looked pale and drawn, though much cleaner than the last time Steve had seen him and now in the bespoke suit he was expecting.  He sat apart from the bed rather than next to it, but his eyes never left the face of the man in the bed.  The baseline anger Steve had been stewing suddenly cooled and Steve almost didn't know how to react.
Tony swallowed back bile as the haze continued to cloud his mind.  He carefully bent down to pick up the first man's gun.  It was loaded and it was easy to find spare clips in the guard's robes.  He had to find the armor.  He was too defenseless like this.
"Whoa there, sport," Tony said, catching Leon before he fell over.  It almost distracted Steve from the blush creeping up Susan's cheeks.
Steve's shoulders hunched as he let Thor lead him to Clint's position.  He wished it were that easy.
Tony wanted to hear Steve's voice one last time.  He wanted a lot of things, but he was running out of time.  "Get the kids out safe.  They're what's important."
"You know I can't do that, Little Bear," Tony said.  "They've still got the virus that took out JARVIS, and if they compromise me while I've taken over the suit, they've got you in a ready-made coffin."
"These dancers are very fit," Thor said, approval radiating off of him.  "I have heard the story of this Romeo and Juliet before, but to see it told through dance and such powerful movements is a fascinating aspect of this culture."
Steve relaxed his grip on the notepad, wondering when he'd gripped it so tightly.  Embarrassment flooded through him.  Apparently not everything was about him and his confession.  "Sorry," he said, still not looking up.
"How can you..." Tony started to ask, then stopped himself.  Steve had gotten the crystal to make Tony feel more at ease and still wanted to stay out here with him instead of going in where it was warmer.  But Tony could still feel the tightly coiled anger.  "You're still angry."
"That's Sam, by the way," Peggy said helpfully, earning a grin from Tony.  Her joy in the human names was endearing.
"You only fight for yourself!  For Stark and your pay check!" Steve yelled, advancing on the faceless armor.  Before, it had unnerved him, but now it just made him want to punch it and see if he could leave a dent.  "I know men worth ten times as much as you."
"You think the army would get rid of its only super-soldier?" Steve asked, sounding far too reasonable.  "Besides, there's no one here but the stars to watch us."
And he still hadn't gotten an answer for that, despite how tactile Tony was being.  Part of him was anxious about that, but a larger part that had finally accepted Iron Man's refusal was okay with it.  As long as Tony was still willing to be his friend, in or out of the Iron Man suit, Steve would be okay.  He could keep loving Tony the way he loved Peggy.  And it
As Star watched the humans disappear behind a building only to be replaced by another group, Tony thought about his brother. Arno had left the hospital while Star was being treated to secure a temporary residence. They decided on Coral Rise, a well-to-do neighborhood that was rather high-tech, having enchanted shells for keys. It was far enough from the edge of the shelf that Star wouldn’t accidentally sink—or be pushed over, but Tony doubted Star would be so fatally clueless—but still close enough that they could still reach him in a reasonable timeframe. It was also one of the few neighborhoods that bordered the edge of Weifsafir.
Of course this has nothing to do w the story, but while you're waiting for the real third chapter I decided to post the (unfinished) inspiration for AWIFY. Instead of Steve, Tony's the surfie in need of aid n education of ocean life :) This is the scenario where I came up with the Merrow but they were still considered mermaids (I headcannon Merrow and mermaids as different but similar species)
It was then that a deep pit opened in his stomach, a little lower than it should be. Tony placed a hand over the sensation and frowned when he saw his hand below his belly button. The last time he ate was yeste--no, three days ago. He'd barely got any pancakes in when JARVIS alerted him to...to... His face scrunched up. Who attacked New York that day?
He had the serum to thank for that; in less than a day a simple head injury like that would be gone.
to learn! Tell you what, we'll leave tomorrow for your suit, and when you get hungry again I'll teach you to hunt."
Star furrowed his brow. Around his neck was one of the cowrie necklaces; they had taught him to open the door when they first entered the house, and he caught on quickly. He loosened the strap of the pouch and played with the money—the gemstone, metal, and carved bone seashells—inside. But after a few heartbeats he seemed to understand that they were leaving him.
a when, because Father had his ways of worming secrets from their holders--Tony's big Star was found...well, the young Princes will ensure he gets sent to the wealthiest quadrant in the human community.
Nestled against the furthest wall of the cave was a pile of metal. Forgetting about his meal instantly, Tony swam over to what was left of his suit--and nearly collided into the wall. His claws clicked on the metal as he picked through the scraps. At the bottom of the pile was his helmet, a large hole in the place of the left eye. The poor thing was dented and scratched. Tony gently took it in his hands, mentally urging JARVIS to wake up and greet him.
The King was quiet at that, no doubt wondering how much leeway he should give his argumentative son.
It was surprisingly good. Tony was more surprised by how his teeth sank into the meat with little resistance. A quick feel with his tongue alerted him to how sharp they were.
Tony wanted to pin his ears. “Father, I trust only myself with the greenprints for the armor.” Of course, he trusted his brother, too, but Father did not need to know that. As far as the King knew, Tony had built Arno’s suit.
“You’ve had quite a while to calm down,” said Father with hardly a glance at Tony. “When can I expect to see apprentices in your forge?” In his youth, the King was a Mer of flirtatious words and charisma, but as he aged—his hair graying and his scales paling—he grew more serious. Now his words were clipped, his eyes piercing.
Hunting was...a trial. Of course, Tony wasn't hungry. He wouldn't be, not for a long time he supposed, since he was still full from the whale meat. But there was only so much of blue water and rippling light and sand Tony could take before he went insane. So he practically begged Ava to teach him to catch stupid little fish.
"Will this...will this stay with me?" Tony asked softly. He fingered the fat and the connected skin, all that was left of his meal. It actually abated his hunger when less than half of the meal--if he was human--would've stuffed him to the brim.
"Panic. Denial. Terror. Y'know, the typical, 'Oh, my family! They're going to think I'm dead!' You actually handled it quite well, so thank you for that."
"Well, by that time I would've made contact with my friends, assuming I'm still legless." Tony ripped another piece of meat off, deciding to eat it with a chunk of fat. The fat added a flavor the Avenger couldn't place, but it wasn't unpleasant. With every swallow he felt his palate inch towards the sea. At the end of these
By the time they reached Star’s new house—a beautiful conch-shaped abode with soft and hard corals adorning its stone exterior—the brothers had loaded Star up with seven jellyfish bell shawls; more than a dozen hagfish slime-silk shirts, vests, and pants; bone, gemstone, and pearl accessories; and plenty of undergarments. They’d bought him cured meats like eel, a few pounds of whale, and even seal imported from down south, and bought him a few leather bags worth of fruits and preserved greens. Tony had bought sheets and pillows along with shell kitchenware, but he fully intended to replace those with higher quality products from the stores along the Subduon floor.
But that only hardened Tony's resolve to help and protect the not-human. There was something about him that lured Tony to him, something that Tony knew would be worth the hell Father will eventually put him through. As they emerged into the depths again, Tony spared Star a glance. His head was up, turning left and right as they passed swarms of bioluminescent jellyfish, but his movements were sluggish.
A deep, deep sigh fluttered its way out his gills. Being away from Father was specifically the reason why they left the Subduon in the first place. The King had been pestering Tony about recent advancements in the armor sets he’d been developing, demanding test results and trying to coerce him into taking apprentices from the nobility. And, like always, such conversations both infuriated Tony and stressed him out—the forge and lab were
"Not through Cap-approved means," Tony said, winking at her.  "Leave an old AI with his secrets.  Now, eat your ice cream before it melts."
Tony didn't speak.  Instead, he leaned over, ignoring how the movement reminded him he hadn't taken any pain killers since the last time he woke up.  Steve caught sight of the movement, worry replacing the melancholy.  "Tony, you shouldn't-"
Clint clapped him on the shoulder and Natasha squeezed his hand again, giving Steve enough will to muster up a smile for them.  This was something that would sit heavily on his shoulders, but it had to be done.
"Doom does not take threats kindly," Doom said, his voice rising in anger.  Then it softened again to a more thoughtful tone.  "But I did not come for a fight."
"Fine," Tony said, pushing the plate away. He hadn't even touched his food. "But if I'm talking to a wall, I can do that while getting work done at the Tower. And the walls there actually listen."
It was a deflection, but Steve allowed it since Iron Man hadn't called him on his lie.  "Needed to work off some excess energy," he said.  But that wasn't adequate enough, not after the dream.  Not with how he could still hear the groan of metal in his dream.  "I..."
Tony tore his eyes away from Steve to see Kestrel standing in the doorway, the gun still in her trembling hands.
"It didn't seem that out of the ordinary to me, other than the fact they couldn't find out who Iron Man was," Steve said.
Steve didn't reply, instead lifting up to help Tony settle the jacket around his shoulders.  It was a bit of a bad fit around Steve's shoulders, but it was better than nothing.  Tony didn't like to think about
"I..."  He didn't know what to think about the bond.  Part of him was terrified, and Tony could feel the hurt from Steve at that thought.  This was why sharing emotions was horrible.  "Damn it, sorry.  This is why we...  I don't like hurting you."
The camera turned back to the inside of the destroyed building, and Steve felt like he could breathe again.  New York had never looked that deserted before.  His mouth was too dry to swallow.
The heavy artillery spotted her immediately, but she dodged the beams, barrel-rolling to the side as she fought her way close enough to take out the first one with a missile.  She ignored the thought of the operators and the heat of the missile, heading up for the second.  She took a hit to her right side, gasping for breath as Tony yelled "Incoming!"
Tony felt his throat close up as he forced himself to blink and get past Sharon's grief to his own.  He could feel Steve's tail tightening around his waist, but he couldn't have said when it got there.  The phoenix crest on Sharon's chest shone in the moss light as her small form attacked the hydra with a viciousness that he had never seen before.
"Alright, alright," Tony said, laughing.  He looked uncertain for a moment, then shimmered slightly.
"All the ones I found were for some expensive program," Steve replied with a sigh, pushing around a bit of ketchup with his french fry. "I didn't want to spend that much money when I could draw just as well on paper."
"Those sound fast," Steve said, a hint of a frown in his voice.  "I want a song that's nice and slow for our first dance under the stars.  I wanna see them properly."
"Aren't you?" Tony asked, pushing off the machine and climbing down as Steve set the cookies aside.  "You had no problems laying into Iron Man and I know the reasons for everything he does.  Blaming and judging is what America's
"Fine," Steve replied.  His wing was bloody from the gun wound, still unhealed and with leaves pressed against it like a bandage to stop the bleeding.
"I could do that?" Steve asked, blown away by the offer.  If it was an offer, he reminded himself.  Tony didn't exactly sound happy, and only Rhodey and Ms. Potts could go down there.  On rare occasions, Natasha went down as well, but Steve was never sure if she was allowed or if she found other ways.
Tony just shrugged.  "That's humanity for you.  I do need to get back to the wall and find a way out though.  They need all the help they can get out there."
Why wasn't the cooling system working?  Tony resisted the urge to punch the wall.  He couldn't get the repulsors to work, the arc reactor was shit, and now the cooling system wasn't working with him.  And wasn't there some sort of problem with ice?
"It... reminds me of Johann," Steve said.  "The blankness.  I don't feel anything from you when you're in there, and only a little when you take off the helmet."
"Yes," Peggy said, twining her neck around the smaller dragon.  They both closed their eyes, rubbing cheek to cheek as Tony watched curiously.  Were all dragons this tactile?  "This is Tony Stark," Peggy continued, moving away, but still within wing distance, and her wing spanned over the smaller dragon's.  "And this is-" Discipline and dedication.  Light blue and dark brown.  A warrior's spirit burning bright as a bon fire on a winter's night.  Golden yellow rose, just blossoming, and a deep, running river with water like ice.  "Sharon.  She is my younger sister.  Are you on duty at the moment?"
"Well, Captain Rogers," Stark said.  "What can I do for you?  I assume you had a reason for this meeting, and I have more important things to do.  Do you need more equipment for the team?"
"Sometimes it takes a while to set in," Steve said soothingly.  "Tony wouldn't have let you go if he thought you'd be in danger."
"It's okay," Tony said, waving vaguely with his other hand after attempting to do so with the hand Steve held captive.  "No problems, Cap.  You're good.  You don't have to-"
"So. Did. You," Iron Man said, pushing Steve's hand off.  "You knew they were going, didn't you?  If you had come to me, I could have told them not to go!  But you didn't."
"The message," Jane said.  "It's from Tony Stark in the future.  We only got bits of it before someone blocked the signal entirely, but the best we can tell is that something terrible happened, and the message is some sort of instruction on how to avoid it.  The portal he's making is supposed to be a last chance scenario to fix things if everything else failed.  He was about to use it."
Steve flushed.  "I didn't mean to scare any one.  I just ah... I eat a lot with the serum.  I'll pay you back."
Steve sighed, ignoring how that hurt his ribs, and turned the phone around in his hands.  "JARVIS, how safe is the data on my phone?" he asked.
Then he was let go.  Tony stumbled forward, only having a few seconds to try and twist his body for the impact.  The air rushed out of him as he hit the freezing ground, his foot twisting painfully under him before he could roll.  His other shoulder wrenched as he did, but didn't break, and the crystals dug into his skin as stopped.
"Talk to Jarvis, Miss Potts," Tony said, completely ignoring the general's order.  "He's the one you must convince, not me.  I'd have let you have a suit weeks ago."
Steve obviously hadn't done very well at hiding it though, because she raised an eyebrow at him from behind Tony as she said, "And it's not your fault, but you're forgiven anyway."
Thor pat Steve on the back again, which gained him a rueful smile.  "It is a band popular among young women, as I understand it," Thor explained.
"There are other ways to reach this place," Steve said, comforting thoughts surrounding Tony's mind.  "I'll find another one.  And when the War is over, I'll find a way to let you know."
.  Tony needed to keep Steve safe.  He didn't know why it was so important suddenly, but it was.  "I'll make it better," Tony promised.  "You won't even miss the old one."
Steve stared at the words, barely understanding their meaning, though he'd memorized the message within seconds.  His throat was uncomfortably tight, but he couldn't put a finger on why.
"Very well, guarded-one," the red dragon said, and Tony held back a relieved sigh as the pressure in his mind faded.  He started to think of names, listening to the dragon's mental voice to see which ones she liked.
Dummy came up behind Tony, clicking in a worried manner.  Tony smiled at him, patting Dummy's arm structure comfortingly.  He could do this.  What was one more disastrous conversation about feelings, right?  "Hi," he replied, looking back at Steve to see that Steve had been watching him with an expression Tony couldn't quite identify.
Tony started the jets, smirking at the dragon's surprise as he lifted into the air.  "So, uh, what count do we follow?" Tony asked, starting to feel a little self-conscious.  "4/4?  Waltz?"
Gold, blue, green.  A gust of wind on the cloudless day and a nightfall of music and words.  History and stories, the sweetness of honey with a hint of ginger - set the crystal on the dais.  It was the last component of the building he and - White and gold.  A field of grain on an open plain.  Herbs and sacred knowledge.  A bonfire under the pale moon - had made together.  It wasn't the same as living on the surface, but they'd make do underground.  It was warm down here, perfect for raising a family.
It was a little awkward, but he found a position half-sitting and leaning against the dragon.  Steve's scales were soft and the muscle under them was hard, but not the worst sort of bed Tony had ever slept on.  And when he leaned back, he could see the cavern's ceiling high above them.  The crystal growths that hung from it reflected the soft white of the now dimmed moss.  Not quite a full moon level of light, but enough to semi-see if the building's lights were turned off.
Before he could slip away again, a loud crash of thunder tore through the air.  Tony's mind was running too slowly for a panic attack, but he did jump.  It took him a while to realize that someone other than Steve was talking.  "Thor?" he asked, feeling confused.
"I'm not," Bruce said, sighing softly.  "But I did study the serum for years, remember.  I know what an increased metabolism can do to a person when they don't keep up with it."
"It doesn't look too swollen," he said, carefully probing the smooth skin.  Her eyes, when he looked back up at her, were even more stunning in the light.  "Do you live far from here?"
"You probably know as much about them as I do," Tony said, but he allowed Steve to pull him along to the center of the balcony.  He knelt down, sitting back on his heels as Steve quickly claimed his lap.  "You can't be comfortable like that."
He looked down at the wires that had been torn out of the heart pump, thankfully none of them ruined too far beyond repair.  The heart itself still worked, the orichalcum still lodged in as a battery source.  Whether she was cruelly letting him die of something other than his bum heart or she actually meant that moment of understanding, he didn't know.  He shivered at the thought of her fingers on his chest, however, and he had to force down the nausea that thought brought up.
He let out a soft breath as Tony gingerly walked over, and sat down at the computer chair.  Steve looked around for another and was glad to see he didn't have to go far.  He rolled it over then passed Tony a sandwich and napkin.
"Seriously, Carol, all you have to do is ask," Jan said.  "Your costume has needed an update for a while now."
"He had a bad reaction to the Skrull sedative," Susan said.  "We're just trying to help him.  Kes, it's me.  You're safe."
Steve hunched his shoulders in a habit he'd had since before the serum.  He almost wished he were smaller again, because doing this made him feel small and petty.  "I can't trust either of them right now, Thor.  Not with Natasha and Clint in Doom's hands.  We need to find out what he's up to.  If need be, we stop him."
He rubbed his cheek against Tony's and Tony laughed, catching hold of his head and holding him close.   "I'm glad you're back."
It was a moment before any of them noticed.  Stealth technology had come a long way since his time, and the new suit was nearly silent.  But Steve noticed the presence beside him and looked up.  "What-"
"Oh, you..." Susan said, then winced.  "The elections have been going on for a while now.  No one thought he had a chance though."
"We're still in hiding, sir," JARVIS said, and Tony felt a smile stretch painfully at the sound of his voice.  "And there's still a Skrull as the President of the Interstellar Alliance, but people are more lenient to our cause. And might I say, welcome back, sir."
The suit was almost working.  He could feel it dancing on his fingertips.  The problem was that 'almost' wasn't the same as 'working'.  He hated the fact that it still wasn't coming together.  He couldn't even get the schematics of the old suits to work, and he was just about to throw the tablet against the wall.
"Captain Rogers," Stark said again, though Steve could see the lines of tension in his bare arms.  Steve pulled his lingering eyes up just in time to catch Stark's pointed look to Ms. Potts.  "What an unexpected pleasure."
It was a cave.  Not just any cave, but the gate cave.  Tony realized with shock that he was only a few inches away from the ledge where he first met Viper.  The way to the gate and his tunnel were blocked by fallen rocks that Steve was half buried under.  What caught his breath was the mural that was right above the ledge's edge.  How he had never noticed it before was a mystery, but now it made him cold.
Steve held back his disappointment.  While he was definitely a little apprehensive about going down to see Tony, he was also looking forward to potentially sharing the meal.  Tony was difficult and prickly, but Steve suspected he had a lot of caring underneath if Steve could manage to keep his temper long enough to keep Tony from going off.  And if
He couldn't help how his eyes moved in the direction of the sound.  Steve looked wrecked, torn between emotions Tony couldn't quite name.  There was exhaustion and guilt etched into the rings around his eyes and the pain of a fresh wound about his shoulders.  There was no love there, not like in his dream, but that didn't mean this still wasn't an illusion.
"I speak what my parents taught me before they died," Viper said.  "They found this place just after I was born, living in the temple grounds.  The monsters never visit the holy place, and I serve there as its priestess in return for its protection."
Natasha nodded again.  She'd let Steve know, he was sure.  "You know what warms you up the best?" she asked.
Tony pulled fruitlessly at the fingers gripping his throat, bringing his knee up and kicking.  There was a hiss and Tony gasped for breath as he rolled away.  He heard the gun go off again as he got to his feet.
He doubted sleep would help.  But as he settled back down, she took his hand and held it tight.  He wasn't alone, even if it felt like it.  "Was there... Did I have a crystal with me?" he asked.
Steve stretched, arching his back like a cat and hissing his tongue out briefly.  Then he shook himself like a dog and Tony ducked under a wayward tail to keep from getting thwapped.  Tony stepped back after that.
"I begin to understand why you are so guarded, Tony Stark," Peggy said.  "Come.  Let us go to the healers."
Tony was glad for the distraction.  "It's good and bad."  Good, because feeling his father's anger and madness would have left his childhood with an even bigger scar.  Bad, because he wondered how much strife would be avoided with that kind of empathy.
"Unfortunately, make a society fearful enough and they'll elect a monster," Captain America agreed with a sigh.  "I just wish people would learn."
"Yes, ma'am," he said, suddenly self-conscious.  He always felt strange being recognized out of uniform, like plain old Steve Rogers wasn't up to the hype that Captain America was.  He wished he had his shield at least, and his fingers twitched without it on his back.
She was practically weightless.  As he moved her, he got a brief glance at the scar running down the left side of her face, hidden behind the cascade of hair.  It looked deep and vicious in a way that left Tony surprised that it hadn't taken out her eye entirely.  Also very angry, because the fact that it hadn't included the loss of her eye implied the scar to be deliberately planned by whoever had given it to her.  "How did...?" he half-asked.
"It's not..."  It was partially because of Tony, but not in the way Iron Man was thinking.  "It's not like that.  He said a lot of hurtful things, but I don't get the feeling that he means them.  He's scared of a lot and lashing out," Steve replied.  "I can handle him, as long as he starts trying to not lash out as much and talk to me."
"Things are okay," Steve said, slightly breathless in a way that Tony thought Steve must have been crying too.
He blinked out of existence.  If Tony had been aware, he would have been unnerved, he was sure, but the next thing he knew the suit was closing over his data crystal and locking into place.  A successful reboot.
"It took us a long time to find another way down to this place," she said.  She kneeled down in front of him, tracing her way down his chest until she stopped at the heart pump.  Tony stilled completely.  He wanted to flinch away from her fingers, but there was no where for him to go.  "But you have saved us an even longer time avoiding the dragons and searching for the crystals.  You have served Hydra well, Mr. Stark."
"What?" Tony said, now trying to bat off the red material he was being wrapped in.  It took longer than it should have to realize he could see now.  Had Thor brought a light?  Didn't matter though.  There was something else important.  Something...  Steve!  "We can't leave.  No, put me down!"
"Steve!"  Tony tried to struggle against the warm armor to go back to the cold.  The cold wasn't so bad as long as he was still with Steve.  "We can't - I have to stay with Steve."
"Stow that talk, Avenger," Steve said gently.  "You can't let the last mission get you down.  Being in top shape means staying positive."
Moving to lean against the counter that Tony was facing, Steve could see a whole row of neatly diced vegetables.  He was almost tempted to measure them all to see how close Tony got the dimensions of each one.  Steve wondered how he settled on the perfect size, or if he had just gotten carried away.
"Steve," he gasped.  Viper was going to kill them all to wake this monster of hers.  He didn't know how, but he had to warn them.  He couldn't just die here.  This was all his fault.
It seemed like every time her mind would wander down those paths, there was a message from the Captain on her HUD or a picture of a kitten courtesy of Tony.  They were both ridiculous, but they did make her feel better.
"Now I know you're joshing me," Tony said, crossing his arms.  The armor clanked as he did so, earning him a slightly disapproving stare from Steve.  "You don't have to wait on me if you have other things to do.  Or do you still not trust me?"
It was a while before he got the chance to check in on Tony again.  The worry grew, but Tony was out on conferences and half-way across the country before Steve could seek him out.  It was frustrating, and Bruce and Jane were almost worrying more than Steve, but it wasn't like they could ask Tony to quit his job, not when they didn't know how big the threat level was.
"I know you hate it, but that doesn't mean you can keep hiding it!" Ms. Potts said, throwing her arms up.
He looked around the workshop at the armors and the holograms Tony had left up.  Even the machine that would have killed him was awe-inspiring in its own way.  Tony was amazing, doing all of that.  It wasn't just Iron Man who did a lot of good, but Tony as well.  Tony just never got any of the credit for it.  It broke Steve's heart a little that the contributions of one person were valued less than another, so much so that the man himself believed it.  Steve and the other Avengers had devalued him as less than Iron Man before they'd even met him.
No, she told herself firmly.  Now wasn't the time for those feelings.  She couldn't let them get in the way when Kes was here.  Kes needed her now.  Taking a deep breath, she took Kes's hand and squeezed it.  "It's not your fault," Susan said again.  "Even Cap doesn't blame you.  If anything, it's my fault for not being able to find you sooner, so it's-"
Steve shook his head, dislodging Tony's hand.  "You used to believe in doing the right thing.  In saving people."
He debated getting out of the suit to find Steve again, but it was more effort than he wanted to get out and in by himself, so he figured he'd wait until he was done for the day.  The helmet was easy enough to take off for eating.  He didn't waste the fuel in the jet packs to get out, opting instead to walk it.  At least this time Steve would hear him coming.
Oh.  That explained a lot.  "I'm fine," Tony said, wishing he could put a hand on Steve's flank.  Then he stood and
"Just got back from my run," Steve replied.  He frowned as Natasha and Clint traded a knowing glance.  He wasn't sulking.
The Red Skull.  Of course.  The devil-man in Steve's dream!  He had been one of the German leaders in the first Great War, though no one knew what had happened to him in the end.  How had he not seen that before?
"I don't know if I have an answer for you," Iron Man admitted.  "I... I'll be here if you need me, but Mr. Stark needs me too.  He..."  Iron Man looked down, the ground apparently worth analyzing.
"Shh, honey.  We’ve already gone through this: the resistance had the mole.  That wasn’t something we could have known," Tony said, patting her back even though she probably couldn't feel it through the armor.  Steve felt his heart twist.  Tony was such a good father, no matter what the other man said, and Steve wished he could have seen Tony with their own daughter at this age.
, Steve realized with a start.  The suit had heated so much that it was ejecting its occupant.  "God damn it, JARVIS, that failsafe was for Rhodey, not for me!" Tony said as he came out of the suit, his fist balled to punch Kang's face plate.
Steve schooled his expression into a smile and sat up straighter, hiding his pain and his exhaustion.  He looked up to see a very concerned Bruce Banner.  He was still shirtless, but he had found some pants that fit and his glasses.  "Are you alright?" he asked.
Tony took a shallow breath, forcing himself to remain still.  He was not going to panic.  Just because there was no power, didn't mean the others wouldn't find him.  There were trackers that didn't rely on external power sources, and after Afghanistan he kept a few on him at all times.  Of course, that assumed that those power sources hadn't been taken off line by the same EMP that took him out, but people were looking for him.  They had to be.
He regretted the words immediately, cursing his lack of control when it came to Tony.  Tony always knew how to press all of his buttons, and of course he would.  He knew everything Iron Man knew.
"After my family died, I was so angry," Wanda said.  "And I did terrible things because of it.  And after Pietro..."
As he worked through the math, Tony debated the pros and cons of putting the suit back on.  It would put a strain on the pump, and he had been working towards being less reckless lately.  Tony raised the flashlight to look around and whistled softly.  "Well, well, well.  What do we have here?"
They stared at each other for what felt like eternity.  Then Tony looked away.  He hated being the first to break, but he couldn't...  "Just keep the ring," Tony said, forcing himself not to code another one on his finger.
"Steve," Tony said, unable to take his eyes off the drawing.  He pushed her hands away to look for an actual picture.  He had to have at least one, probably in color because he was thorough and spent a week messing around with a Kodak a few years back.
He waited as Tony wavered, not pressing further.  He planted his feet so as not to move on them as he waited and told himself not to be disappointed if Tony wanted to be alone since that was exactly what he himself had done after his nightmare.  Bruce said Tony was better with space.
There were five of them in there, one that was obviously the leader berating the others.  Tony remembered him.  Bald and vicious, a nasty piece of work.  He'd been one of the few Tony feared.  The man hit one of the guards, yelling at them in a foreign language.
Clint shrugged.  "I was flipping channels and Thor wanted to watch.  Not my thing, but not bad considering.  Pity Natasha's not here.  She likes watching it."
"Easy to fix," Sharon said, her voice soft.   "I could do it all, no problem.  No reason to call a proper healer."
Steve gasped awake, hearing both Bucky's scream and someone softly saying his name.  Half of him was still staring into the snowy valley, wondering how damned he'd be if he let go as well.
"She programmed me to tell when other people are lying," Steve corrected in exasperation.  "And only in code."
He called the elevator and pulled out his phone, using its connection to talk to JARVIS, since he didn't know how extensive JARVIS's presence was in the lower levels of Stark Tower.
"Of course not," Tony snapped, his fists curling tightly at his sides.  It spoke of a much different answer.  Bucky had always said Steve had a chip on his shoulder, and now he was starting to understand his best friend's constant frustration.  "No one else is bothered by the lies though.  Why do you care?"
"Hey," Tony said.  "What's that dumb phrase you say?  Stow that talk and take your own advice.  I married a cuddle octopus.  I knew that going in, even if the extent of it is a bit more now.  You're okay. We're both here."
"I may or may not be settling a score on whether godparents give better presents than parents and are cooler," Fury said.  "Clint and I agreed we'd pay the same price and see who won."
Steve felt self-conscious despite his words, because he really wasn't strapped for cash and most of his drawings were just to give his hands something to do.  But he'd seen enough posts about artists having to charge too low for prices, and he did want to drive that point home.  He accepted the fifty.  "I guess I can give a former superior officer a discount."
He took another drink  and coughed, pulling his legs tighter to his chest as he kept the bottle away from a surprised Stark.  Stark didn't need to be drinking any more of it, and Steve decided it wasn't so bad on the second try.  "You shouldn't have gotten involved if you don't have a gun," Steve said.
"Shh, princess.  It'll get better," Tony said.  "There's plenty of other girls in the sea.  Probably a few I haven't dated even."
.  At least from the sound of it, Bruce and Jane would be interested in collaborations, so Steve could encourage it from the other end if need be.
"I..."  Steve looked back at the tree, wondering how far beyond it Iron Man was.  "It seems like it'd be lonely, eating by himself like that all the time."
Keeping his gun steady, Tony peeked out from behind his rock.  There were no humans there, but two dragons.  The first, the one that attacked him, was dark blue with two horns on its head and a long, spiked neck.  Two giant wings spanned out behind it, obviously agitated and the dragon had a truly frightening set of claws that Tony didn't want to meet personally.  In the center of its chest was a silver star made of some sort of stone ornament.
"I, uh, brought some cookies?" Steve said, tearing his eyes away from Tony's muscles.  Which was not what he was supposed to say at all, really.  He was so glad Natasha wasn't here, because she never would have let him live this down.
He picked up a walking stick on the ground near one of the big canopy trees, trying to make out more of the city as he tested it.  What wonders could be in such a city?  Or indeed, if Hydra was interested in it, what weapons?  There were things flying over it that weren't quite birds.  Big things.  No, it couldn't be-
The problem with letting Iron Man change the subject was that now they were hitting on Steve's sore points.  "I don't think I intended to draw it this way," Steve admitted.
Steve's hands were resting on his chest as his eyes slid closed in pleasure with Tony's fingers in his hair.  He let out a small whine when Tony stopped, opening his eyes when Tony claimed one of his hands.  "Tony?"
Ms. Potts hummed.  "I can guess what the conversation was about," she said, looking at him again with the same scrutiny as before.  Steve sat up a little straighter despite the hangover.  "I can work with guilt though.  I have a few ground rules before I let you near him."
The brown dragon looked at him, and Tony had the impression the dragon was amused.  Amused and listening to Tony's thoughts, which would probably explain how they spoke without talking.  Small wonder the red one had known about Fing Fang Foom.  It unnerved him, to know they could hear what he thought, and he took a step back, only belatedly remembering his bad foot.  He winced, then tried to cover it.
"I decided to wake up first today," Steve said, his usual grumpiness gone.  Tony wondered if Peggy had brought him a snack, because usually only hunger was enough to rouse Steve from his dreams.  "Couldn't leave you by yourself."
He wouldn't have been surprised if Iron Man laughed at him for that, but he didn't.  Instead, he reached over and squeezed Steve's shoulder gently.  "Mind control," he repeated.  "It sucks, but it really wasn't your fault.  You're not a bully, Steve.  Never will be."
Leon relaxed as Kestrel confirmed their identities.  He wondered if the Skrulls had ever managed to trick the twins about each other, but Steve got the feeling they hadn't.  The kids were safe.  Crying, but safe.  So why did Steve not feel happier?
"We have incoming," Steve said, tracing the inside of Tony's wrist.  He brought Tony's hand up and kissed the palm, feeling Tony sigh next to him.
"I can't be that far underground," Tony said, gritting his teeth.  Aside from the science that said it just wasn't possible for him to fall and survive even with the suit, Tony couldn't have fallen too far.  Unless Viper had picked up some actual magic down here and caught him too when she was trying to save herself, which he was not putting his survival down to.
"You are better company than you give yourself credit for," Thor said, ruffling Steve's hair.  Then he sobered.  "I do not wish to see you hurt again, however."
She was blasted against the wall as soon as she entered, but Susan grit her teeth against the bruises she was going to find tomorrow, firing in the opposite direction.  She heard a scream, putting up her shields as another blast came.
The concrete floor wasn't the most comfortable thing in the world to sit on, but Steve had been through worse and the serum would take care of any aches and pains that came from it.  He started to draw, carefully setting down smooth lines with his pencil, vague shapes turning into a broader picture.  He was out of view of the machine, which was just as well.
Really, Tony wanted to place the not-human in his Starlight Tower. Of course, it was at the bottom of the Subduon, but at least his big Star would have protection, humans to interact with and tutor him, and entertainment. Tony didn’t feel comfortable with the several miles that’d separate the trio once it was time for him and Arno to resume their royal duties. The strange not-Merrow from earlier unnerved him, and who’s to say he wasn’t amongst the formless rocks beyond, watching through a telescope? Star was vulnerable, easily trapped, and stuck in a world that he clearly never thought could exist.
Steve couldn't tear his gaze from the merman's eyes. His irises and pupils were glowing the same blue that shined out from his strange metal suit. The werewolf was transfixed.
Tony knew his father hated humans. Something about a human male chasing him when he was a pup. So when--and it
Arno met them at the corner of Current Way and Whelk Way not too long later. Looped over his neck were three keyshells, carved into palm-sized cowries. He, too, had taken off his suit, his scales mimicking an ever-constant shadow attached to a Merrow torso. “I got him a three-level house,” he purred. “Now he just needs provisions.”
If he could sag straight into the ground, he would. "In the sea." Dust does not swirl so thickly, so slowly, in air currents, no matter how cold the air was. And this bed he was in? He only caught a glimpse of it, but he saw dark green foliage, perhaps seaweed. And the woman before him--she had no legs.
out the box here, but Tony was confident he could repair his suit just enough to send the coordinates of his location to his friends.
Steve watched all the while, fascinated, as she scrubbed the ointment around and wrapped his leg. Never once did the ointment break off the swab or his skin and swirl into the water, nor did the substance degrade. It was as solid as its cousins on land. “Wouldn’t all this be rendered useless by the water?”
It didn’t take long to find the current King and Queen. They were in the courtyard, coiled up on chairs. Between them was a small table that Father had commissioned when Tony was younger. Atop the table was a tray holding a bowl of tome type of salad and a stack of plates. Behind them was the Glowing Reef, genetically augmented corals and flora that shone a variety of colors and grew around the dozen yellow pillar coral lights meant to mimic the sun. The pillars had been set to a comfortable setting so as to not blind the pair.
Ava shrugged. "Yeah. I'm not one to play the my-trauma-is-worse-than-your-trauma game, but it's definitely up there on the list of things you wouldn't wish on anyone."
Shimmering purple, the waiter swam to the table. “Is everything to your liking, Your Majesties? Shall I retrieve more plates? Bowls?”
The room was carved from stone. There were breaching whales carved into the walls and pods of dolphins playing with one another. Feathery anemones grew on the walls, close to the sea grass floor, swaying in the currents produced from movement.
"Your helmet is mostly intact, but I literally had to make ten trips for the rest of it, and I still may not have gathered everything. If you like, I can take you there later."
The hospital visit went well, much to Tony’s delight, but he honestly much preferred Strange’s expertise. Not to say Dr. Corella’s work was subpar, no, she worked with cool efficiency all the while carrying a conversation with Star. It was just that Strange had
He shrugged, pulling a chunk of meat from a slab and chewing it to a near-pulp before swallowing. "How do people normally react?"
"You asked if I was awake," he mumbled. He blinked open his eyes but immediately clamped them shut. The blast of cold air along with the brightness of the room cause pain to flare in his head. Another groan rumbled in his throat.
Steve nodded acknowledgement. “Don’t you ever miss your ancestral homes or try to get to your destination? And what’s a toll?”
Tony began to shake. What happened to him? How long had he been down here? Are the others still searching for him, or have they given up? No, Rhodey, his Honeybear, he would never stop looking. Pepper and Peter, his love and CEO and kid, they would pester the others to search for even his bloated fish-eaten flesh, for the tiniest metal shard of his suit.
Displaying a mixture of whale and dolphin reliefs and curving lines was the hospital, one of the largest buildings in western division. Like the Merrow civilians, the humans threw themselves out the way of the royals, signing to one another and pointing to Star.
A hand pressed itself to his shoulder--which was bare to the world, and why was he on his stomach?--gentle and slightly warmer than the air around him. "Hey, don't move so much, alright?"
“I would much rather not,” said Tony, keeping his face carefully straight. He stabbed a ring of squid, working his fork through the tough flesh. “The more tails in my forge, the more crowded it will be. It won’t be safe for so many Mer to be in an enclosed, potentially volatile space.”
Mother smiled at him. The Queen somehow balanced out the harshness that was her mate. She, too, had gone gray and pale, but her gentleness had only increased. That didn’t mean, though, that she never had her scathing reservations of other Mer. “Some dessert would be nice. Yes, dear?” she added, casting a hopeful glance at Father. He nodded absently.
? Wasn't he in a sterile white room? And why was he moving so freely? Shouldn't there be IVs and medical gauze restricting his movement? And
"Anything for a lady," he replied, ducking around a low hanging branch and making sure his foot didn't catch on the raised root in front of him.
"I too have noticed a disturbing lack of diversity in the toys for these movies," T'Challa said, startling them all.  Steve breathed a sigh of relief, turning to look as the Black Panther walked forward in full uniform.  T'Challa was a voice of reason.  "Perhaps I should join you in your endeavors as well."
He watched as the armor enveloped Tony, and Steve reminded himself a second time.  He grabbed the tray, offering his arm to Tony once the armor was finished.  "Ready?"
"Still here, Winghead," Tony muttered, forcing his eyes open.  He could do that much at least, keep Steve company as long as he could, even with the cold and concussion telling him he wanted to sleep.
Curiosity burned at him, however.  He slid down the high-backed couch until he was slouched over, not that they could see him from the kitchen.  Steve was no saint, no matter how much Iron Man teased him about it.
Tony pushed those thoughts away, attempting - and failing - another deep breath.  Again, bright side.  The suit was dented, letting the dusty air in from the outside, instead of suffocating him in his own custom-made coffin.  Tony just wished that thought were more comforting.
"I'm here as plain as day, Cap," Tony said, closing the sketchbook and handing it back to Steve.  "Kang fried the circuits of the stealth armor.  I'll need Mr. Stark to...  Well, I'll need to fix it at some point."
When she finished, Tony hesitated, then opened his shirt.  "You wouldn't happen to be able to do anything for my heart?" he asked, laying the pump bare.  His heart wasn't a pretty sight, scarred and ugly.  While it was true the pump didn't have to be charged any more so long as the orichalchum was connected, the muscle itself would give out in a few years.  The machinery could only do so much.
"The Avengers phones are made personally by Mr. Stark," JARVIS replied.  "There are a very limited number of individuals who could potentially break the security, some of which are considered friendly to the Avengers and would be unlikely to do so."
Tony didn't know how to respond to that.  It couldn't be true that Steve had always wanted him, could it?  He always turned down Tony's offers for upgrades or gifts.  This wasn't right, was it?
He was just about to tackle a larger boulder when he heard a scream echoing through the halls of the cave.  Not a mental yell or a roar, but a very human scream.
"That would be because an obsolete soldier is interrupting my work," Tony snapped.  "Go nap for another seventy years if you're going to do nothing but fuss."
"Yes, sir."  Steve started to eat, letting the conversation restart around him.  It warmed something that the nightmares left cold, to see his team sticking around and waiting for him to finish when they were already done eating.  He wasn't quite part of the conversation, but he wasn't feeling left out like he sometimes did.
Tony woke up again some time later to a darker room.  Rhodey was slumped on the bed in Bruce's usual chair, no longer in the armor but in a button up shirt with the sleeves rolled up.  Tony's hand was held captive under Rhodey's cheek in a way that was sure to leave a mark.  At least he wasn't drooling on it.
"Whoa," Iron Man said, his hands up in pacifying motions despite the fact that it wasn't particularly reassuring considering his palms were where his weapons were.  Steve didn't look up from the bag though, not acknowledging what he saw of Iron Man out of the corner of his eye.
Kes jumped at the feeling of a hand in her hair,looking up to see the AI of her ancestor, Tony Stark.  She hugged her pillow to her chest defensively.  "What do you want?" she asked through a sniffle.
The woman blushed, standing back.  "Just looking out for him.  Ya know, since his boss is so crappy."
"More or less the same thing," Natasha replied.  "Seriously, Steve.  You're just going to meet Tony Stark.  Why are you so nervous?"
Steve stared at his back, mouth open in surprise.  "If this is about you keeping secrets-" he managed finally.
Steve gave one more glance at the Colonel and a quick prayer before following after Tony.  There wasn't much more he could add.
Dr. Foster used that opportunity to stand on her toes and throw her arms around Tony's neck.   "Don't scare us like that again," she said, hugging him tightly.
"It's better than having a Skrull for president," Susan said, shuddering.  One vote may not mean much, but she was glad all the same Tony had slipped hers in.  She didn't think Steve would be
He nudged Steve's tail with his foot, patting Steve's shoulder when he could feel the slight embarrassment coming from the dragon.  He felt doubly guilty for lying to Steve, especially after entertaining a few short-lived doubts about the dragons earlier.  It had to be a different clan that hurt Viper.  Steve would never allow it.
"Tony Stark," Tony said, reaching out for the customary cheek greeting.  He was surprised when Sam caught Tony's hand carefully in his claw and brought it to his mouth, deft tongue flickering across his fingers.
"JARVIS, open port 290926," Iron Man said, a grin in his voice. "Sorry.  Hate to break it to ya, but Damocles won't be responding to you anymore."
"I didn't think you'd do it with your bare hands!  Fuck."  There was panic in Tony's eyes, but he pulled Steve into the workshop and carefully started to unwrap the fabric to get a better look at the cuts.
Steve winced, but held on to his tray.  "I have a better idea what I'm getting myself into this time."
.  Neither of them had memories of how they died, but this was how Tony had looked the last morning Steve had woken up.
"Sure?" Tony said, confusion replacing the annoyance in his tone.  "Why not?  Just give me a heads up if you're serious."
There were sounds, but not those of soldiers' boots.  They sounded like birds and other bugs, things he might expect in a jungle or a forest.  Carefully, he peered out around the gate.
"Captain, what battle was fought here?" Thor demanded.  "Is it too late or can we yet join the fight?"
"I've always liked girls," she said, hugging her pillow against her.  "Susan knows that.  She's just... not interested in me."  And that was okay.  Or it was okay, as long as it wasn't
Tony blinked as Steve moved away, his heart pounding and his breathing faster than it should be.  "You hate it when I offer to take you."
Before Peggy's exasperation could get the better of her and start them bickering, Tony tried to wrestle control of the conversation back.  "Usually once one of you is far enough away, I can't feel you any more.  How come I can still feel Steve?"
His tail lashed in fury as fire spewed from his throat, burning Zemo and the remaining soldiers.  His wings spread, teeth bared and a fierce gleam in his eyes that shone with vengeance.  He slashed Zemo with his claws and Tony watched as Da - as Zemo fell back.
"Miss Potts, while I wouldn't dare question your resolve," Tony said, grunting as he had to bank hard to the right.  "I do question your timing.  We are a bit busy."
Steve pushed himself up to see a portal of some sort.  It was black and fluctuating, and Steve immediately felt nauseous.  He stepped back, the sick feeling fading as he moved further away.  He was grateful for that, at least.  Whatever that glowing circle as, it wasn't good.
"Kids who have been tortured emotionally and physically for almost two years now.  And I'm not just talking about what the twins must have gone through," he growled, trying to pull out of Steve's grip.  Steve let him, but only to get about a foot away before he felt Steve's hands on his shoulders.  His mind literally went offline for a nanosecond as Steve started massaging.  Tony never figured out if it was the serum or a natural ability, but Steve's massages were almost as legendary as his alter ego.
Sighing, Steve rubbed his forehead.  He needed a clear head for this.  He looked at Tony again, feeling the unnatural silence that fell between them.  "Can I hug you?" Steve asked, needing to reassure himself and Tony that he wasn't going anywhere.
A click came from the altar and Tony grinned.  "I told you," he said, stepping away from the wall.  He pushed the altar forward, then pulled it back when it didn't give.  The latter worked and revealed a menacing-looking staircase that went down underneath the temple.  "Yay!  Secret passage!"
"Don't worry," Peggy said.  "It's far enough behind your walls I only noticed it because I'm close. I can't sense the feeling itself, just the fact you are ashamed of it.  What is it?"
"Why?  Did he have some sort of grudge against Tony?" Steve asked.  He found it hard to believe that Tony would hurt people, at least on the level Fury was implying.  Tony only aimed to hurt when he himself was hurting.  He'd seen that easily enough in their first meeting when Tony had been friendly up to Steve making incorrect assumptions. Tony had been genuinely kind to the airmen and hospital staff.
"You shouldn't want this," Tony said after a while.  "You deserve better than everything I've said to you."
Steve stopped in his tracks.  He hadn't realized he'd been moving.  "You're Iron Man," Steve said.  This wasn't just Tony borrowing the suit.  He'd performed maneuvers that Steve had taught Iron Man, and he was pretty sure a civilian wouldn't have the muscle memory to pull it off.  He didn't know how to feel.  Surprised, definitely.  Angry at being lied to.  Understanding for
Leo's silence grew deeper, and Susan knew Cap had 'hit the nail on the head' to use one of Tony's expressions.
"I'll be waiting for it then."  Because when Steve said it like that, it was almost impossible not to believe it.
"Funny," Tony said, though his voice lacked any humor.  It had lost the cruelty at least, which meant he was off the defensive.  "That's all they say about me in the news.  You'd be surprised how many people believe it."
Leo stumbled as he tried to take a seat, and both she and Cap were at his side before he fell.  "I'm
He kissed the back of Tony's hand before he could second-guess his actions.  He closed his eyes as he did, not sure if he wanted to see Tony's reaction or not.
Wanda was regarding him with curiosity.  "Your culture has strange notions of what should and should not be shared," she said, though there was no judgement in her tone.  "Do you not share your happiness?"
"And they've got my circuitry in them," Tony said, self-loathing dripping from his voice as he curled tighter around his knees.  "Things I made hurt Rhodey."
"I don't want to miss any of the frequencies," Tony said, resisting the urge to jostle Steve off with a quip about how terrible that was for his posture.  He sighed and felt guilty.  This was his
"Only to someone who has seen it in you before," Thor said.  "You have a mind for conquest.  It is quite clear by the look in your eyes and where they linger."
He jumped, raising his hand to fire the repulsors.  "Easy," Steve said, rubbing his cheek against Tony's, the touch that set Tony off and startled him, but now Steve was sending calming thoughts that were amplified by the touch.
"I couldn't possibly ask you to," she said.  "If you just tell me where they are, I could find them myself."
Stark's eyes grew wide, and he broke eye contact again.  He waved it off as he ducked his head.  "Okay, I don't-"
Then Tony was left alone with Steve, and the awkward factor increased by at least 300%.  That was actually low-balling it.  But at least this time he had a tablet to focus on, something to do with his hands.
Steve grumbled, but didn't stop Tony from hauling him off the floor.  He did try to push Tony away to walk by himself, but his balance was off due to the drink.  The world spinning startled him more than he was expecting.  Tony slipped under his arm as he cursed the poison.
He felt Wanda's laugh along with Steve's sulking and it eased some of the pounding in his head.  "He is known to do such things from time to time."
.  He'd seen holograms before, but always with some sort of table underneath.  He didn't have time to marvel at Tony's technology though, because the video captured his attention.
That was probably well deserved, but Tony glared anyway.  The little 'punk' (as Steve liked to put it) didn't have to rub it in.
He got off the bed and checked the mirror one more time, forcing his hands at his side instead of tugging at his collar like he wanted to.  "Think I'm good to go?"
But the fight left Tony like a wild horse submitting to a gentle hand.  He slumped back down, running his hand through his own hair then rubbing his eyes.  "Ya got that way about ya, Steve.  One that makes a man want to be better than he is," Tony said quietly.  "I ain't never been that good.  Don't you go placing any of that hope on me because I'll be letting ya down soon enough."
He washed his clothes first, setting them on the hot stones to dry, then himself.  Surprisingly, the water of the massive bath (swimming pool more like, but Tony was admittedly smaller than a dragon) was only warm and not scaldingly hot.  He suspected Peggy and Sam had a hand in that, but he refused to ask them how since he also suspected they'd take great delight in informing him that it was magic.
"Thanks, Thor," Steve said.  He slumped down on the couch as Clint made room for him, and Thor put his arm around Steve's shoulders again.  He'd admit, being wedged between the two Avengers was nice.
"I hate magic," Tony said, rubbing his temples.  He didn't need a worse headache because magic was turning up again.  He wondered if he could get away with telling Pepper that Viper had bewitched him though.  That sounded much better than admitting his own gullibility with a pretty face.
Tony's shoulders hitched once, then he was hiding his face against Steve's neck.  He was babbling softly, largely unintelligibly, but Steve could pick out a few of the words that were repeated often enough.  "Sorry" was one of them, and it broke the hold on his anger and left an empty ache behind.  Tony's words stung because a large part of him wondered if they were true.  At least with the way Tony was clinging to him, Steve felt like there was one person who needed him in this time.
He shimmered into existence, opening his 'eyes' to see the whole crew together.  It was at C-base, which Tony had been stocking and repairing for just such an emergency, but it looked much better than the last time he'd seen it.  Steve stood apart from the kids, a bland smile on his face.
"Stark's still not talking," Clint said, resetting the weight values on the machine as Steve grabbed a towel.
There were also four chicken breasts neatly wrapped up in plastic off to the side, waiting for whatever Tony was planning for them.  Taking in the ingredients that were laid out, Steve did some mental cataloging and figured it was some kind of roast chicken?  Why would Tony be making that?  Even when Tony did cook, it was never anything
Thundersnow was actually a thing, apparently.  Just his luck.  "Hydra?" he asked, trying to ignore how fucked up weather around the Great Lakes was.
He was on his own floor where JARVIS only monitored if there was an unauthorized person entering, and it felt strange.  He didn't usually stay on his floor for very long, only Tony's insistence he couldn't change it being the reason Steve still claimed it.  That and the light in the back room made a good spot for painting.  Normally it seemed like a waste just to have this big space he barely used, but now...
"I..."  Steve's eyes widened in surprise and he rubbed his forehead.  "I have.  Plenty of times, I guess.  We navigate by them in the field.  I like the sun too, because that always warms me up.  It's pretty swell."
"Actually, you'll find I don't, overclocked or otherwise.  And I was very, very wicked, plum cake," Tony said, this time pulling away from Steve until the man let him go.
"We're going to New York," Pepper said cheerfully, reaching over her papers to pick up a tray.  She then thrust it on Tony, preempting his attempt to get up.  He looked down at the tray, taking stock of the juice and sandwiches.  There was even some fresh fruit on there, which was how he knew they were spoiling him because they thought he was sick.  There was a folder off to the side of the food, which caught his curiosity.
Tony didn't know what happened, but he knew something was off even in his pre-coffee haze when Steve stiffly shouldered his pack this morning.  Unfortunately, he was no closer to figuring out what happened than he had been two hours ago, and Steve's denial was slowly driving him nuts.
"Baseball's always been a dirty sport," Steve said, and this close Tony could see the way his eyes danced when he laughed.  "Though I wouldn't mind first or second base if a home run is off the books for now.  Gotta warm up, if I'm gonna start pitching or ca-"
"With knowing I spent over a century longing to see them," Steve replied, looking wistful.  "Do you still have the crystal?"
"To think, you would destroy the world if you kept living," Kang said, his voice low.  "I expected more of a fight, even from a Neanderthal."
"I'll change things.  I-" Tony gasped, looking down at Steve's claw that hovered over his chest, the glowing yellow light the cause of his sudden pain.  "What're you doing?"
By the time he got the rest of it off, Steve and Sam were tangled together.  Steve's wings were flickering in agitation as Sam rubbed his cheek against Steve's to calm him down.  Tony felt irrationally jealous of the contact, and he couldn't say why.
Sam and Peggy shared a look, then Sam reached out and touched Tony's cheek with his claw.  "Can't say I understand," he said, "but it seems like it's important to your culture."
"That sounds an awful lot like a hero to me," Cap said as he entered the room.  He pulled Tony into a hug, which Tony only huffed at.  "And Captain America is an expert on heroes."
"You want to help me, Rogers?  Get the fuck out.  I don't need you and your savior complex.  You're nothing special outside of my dad's walking science experiment."
Before them lay darkness, pierced only by various coral lights growing in the sand and on rocks and buildings. The street, lined only by perfect cubes in stacks of alternating twos and threes, extended out into the awaiting void-enshrouded community. In the distance, the red prince saw a group of humans expertly swimming about, from right to left, down the street.
Tony tapped Star’s shoulder and swam a few feet down the street. “Let’s go, Star. We got you a home for the moment.”
"Tell me the damage, Ava. Why can't I feel my legs? Why do I feel heavier?" A stab of cold fear shot down his spine, and something on his back, something
Blue—Red? Blue Eyes?—swam closer to Steve with a smooth flick of his long tail, and when the light hit his body at the right angles golden flecks glittered on both his skin and his scales.
"You're getting the hang of it," remarked Ava as she chewed on some meat. "Most who've been turned keep thinking 'legs' and not 'tail'."
The doctor's voice was soft and filled with concern, and Tony's mother flashed in his mind, stroking his cheek as he battled a fever when he was seven. And despite the unnaturally thick cold air, something warm fluttered in his chest. "The hospital wing, obviously, though why I'm on my stomach is a mystery I'd love to figure out."
They ate in blissful silence. As the minutes passed Tony took to familiarizing himself with his tail. Up and down, first starting with the tailfin and moving up until he could feel his pelvic fins, located where his knees should've been, being lifted out the bed. Then it was side to side, like a cat swishing its tail; then it was curling his tail so far to the side that he could rest his chin on the limb. He marveled at how fluid it moved, at how his tailfin swirled with the currents yet still remained firm, and for a moment a shred of excitement ripped through him.
The pressure of her hands left him; an instant later Steve heard her moving items about. With a satisfied sound, the doctor returned and began to slather something cold on his head.
Steve's orders were clear. He was to infiltrate a GAIA ship and disable its communications. Incapitate all enemies. Gather intel for SHIELD review. Leave. Debrief.
“Look,” he clicked, pointing to the sea-humans. He turned to Star, but he had already noticed them. The not-human was mesmerized. Tony supposed he never once thought humans could live in the crushing depths.
Tony scowled. He dove, pumping his tail as hard as he could to gain speed. The prince tucked his arms close. Blissfully cold water soared over and around his body.
“The tolling comes from the big bell outside in our Heart. It’s how we keep time, and some of us have tried,” she admitted. “Our ancestors, I mean. Most never return. Those that do speak of fear, hatred, and murder. I like to think that some were accepted and their descendents live in the air to this day. I feel for them, though—they’ll never experience the weightlessness of the blue.” Dr. Corella stared at him, eyes gleaming. “What’s it like, Misuar Star, being as heavy as a rock, never floating?”
Tony began to float to avoid the sand catching the light and nearly blinding him. All it took was a flick of his tail and he was level with her. "Fine. How much? Does he take US dollars?" Of course payment would be late,
“Right, now I must see your head.” She pulled on shining gloves and gently prodded about at the back of his head, moving his blond hair aside to gauge the size of his head wound. “It seems to be healing well already, Misuar Star.”
By the time the doctor returned with a single sheet of yellow-green paper, Steve was fully dressed and had ownership of his shield again. He took the paper, which was surprisingly stiff and just as smooth as normal paper. Surveying it, he realized that it was a simple, neatly organized list of his treatment. But most surprising of it all was the English. Readable, yet foreign. There were words and phrases Steve didn’t know or even remotely understand. Beneath the list was a reminder to visit the hospital—Weifsafir Hospital, it was called—to get the wrappings renewed.
There was a human community up on the shelf called Weifsafir. It was high enough that Star would not succumb to the pressure. For now, they were Star's best chance at survival.
Tony led Star out of the hospital, looking back every few tail flicks to ensure the not-human could keep up. Tony found it rather cute how Star was struggling to walk and swim at the same time, though he tried not to smile too obviously. Tony deduced from Star’s shield that he was a high-ranking member of the surface military—because,
In the hallway, blue lights warped over a figure. Arno swam into the room with a slight flick of his tail and admired the alcove and bed. “Your sense of style never was lacking, Tony.”
He cast a glance at Star. The not-human was swimming more like the sea-humans now, paddling with his legs and pushing at the water with his hands. His body was miraculously straight. It seemed to work well for him, but he was a board of flotsam trying to blend in with seals.
“This’ll help with the healing process,” she said when he tensed. “It’ll harden and stop foreign objects and pesky fish from making the wound worse. After a few tolls, though, it’ll start to chip. That’s normal. Just wait it out until it’s all gone, and make sure to sleep on your sides.”
The shelf ended with a sharp descent. The brothers coasted to a stop over the depths of the Subduon, over the heart of Eingara. Even through the four miles that separated the princes from their home, they saw the multicolored lights that twinkled like stars, signifying the Merrow-dominated markets, parks, and housing areas. All those lights clustered up towards a ring of bright blue and yellow: the palace.
Tony nodded, lifting his own face plate. When they were still pups there was news of a Merrow who'd saved a human and brought them down to the depths. But even with the newfound abilities to breathe underwater and survive its bone-reaching chill, the human still had yet to adapt to the crushing darkness. By the time the Merrow reached bottom of the trench, the human "looked more like a flounder."
"Pretend-he-doesn't-exist deep." Arno led them in a dive though a cavern filled with shrimp and spiders.
His brown hair was short and curly, his smile sharp and radiant. Sticking out from the sides of his head were expressive finned ears. His visible skin had faint red stripes as well as dozens of scars. Looped around his neck was a necklace of dark-colored pearls with a single sea shell in the middle. Over his torso was some type of shirt that glimmered in the white light, sporting a strange mix of geometric and swirling patterns. Blue’s tail was deep red in color with darker, thick striping, and he had snow white underscales. All along his body, skin and scales, were pale, orderly spots. But his eyes still glowed that hypnotic blue color.
He curled up around himself, probably slapping sand towards Ava as he dragged his tail towards his chest. "Sorry." Tony cracked open his eyes, gradually widening them in the darkness of the shade, and focused in on the long limb that took the place of his legs. His tail was long and thick, adding seven feet to his already not-short height. It was truly a rich maroon color, with his underbelly being white and extending into his back in symmetrical stripes not unlike a zebra's. Like she said, his fins were translucent gold, and small golden freckles glittered all over his body, even on his skin.
A battle lost, a battle begun. “Perhaps I should choose my own apprentices. Father, I want impressionable minds, not Mer that will fight me for ownership of my own creations.” And Tony knew a few noble-born Mer that would steal from him given the chance and turn shells off of his stolen work. The last thing he wanted were those untrustworthy slime-tongued Mer knowing the location and passwords of his most treasured thoughts.
Steve's memory was littered with holes; waking up was the only indication that he'd ever passed out, and each time the scenery was different. Sand and rock. A bottomless void. Darkness. Lights. Darkness. More lights. A city street?
The prince smiled and rose up to the coral light above. He set the light to the same setting as the hallway lights, bathing the room in a gentle sun yellow light, before he set to work arranging Star’s clothes.
It was cold all around him, which was good, because Tony's body ached all over. Though the hospital wing of the Tower must've been cooler than normal--he could feel the currents of wind caressing his body. Tony really couldn't bring himself to care, not when his whole body ached all over. Attempts to move was met with his muscles burning with fire, and the billionaire couldn't help but moan.
Tony suddenly hoped they met Mother first. Even though she took Father’s side in this particular argument, she was always understanding of Tony’s need for space and privacy in his forge.
"You've become unbelievably annoying, Captain." The merman's voice rang clear in the blue. His name was Ross Sweinden, Steve remembered, GAIA's pack of muscle. They had met before, only a week ago, when Ross had nearly bested him in combat. Steve was impressed, he respected Ross's strength; the man would've made a worthy Avenger if only he wasn't so eager to use brute force. "How's about we end this?"
Tony rolled to his belly and hauled himself over the side of the seaweed bed to stare down at the meat. Two of the four cuts, thicker than his pinky was long, still had the fat and skin. "You...you want me to eat this?
When they were close to the floor, Tony spotted movement to his left. It was a carriage drawn by a pair absolutely massive saequus, who pumped their front flippers and tails to carry their load from the abyss of the Trench. Their reins twinkled with red and yellow jellyfish bell lights, and the turtle shell carriage they were connected to was adorned with the same lights configured into starfishes and conch shells. Sitting on the outside of the carriage, holding the kelp reins connected to the saequus’ snouts, was a human servant. No doubt the carriage belonged to one of the nobility or moderately wealthy families heading up to the market above.
Blue and orange, gray and black, filled his vision. Unnaturally smooth fingers and arms wrapped themselves around the joint connecting his arms to his shoulders and hoisted him up with a gentleness he only recieved from Natasha.
The room the receptionist led them to was lit with a white coral light that was growing downwards from the ceiling. The stony floor was carpeted with sea grass and the walls swayed with vibrant anemones and soft corals. To the left of the doorway was a wall-long counter, all its contents sorted into neat groups. In the middle of the room was a mechanical bed fashioned into a mussel shell, fitted with sealskin sheets. The princes lay Star down on the sheets, settling him on his belly.
And now here he was. Hissing curses at a nth hand-sized fish that's darted from his grasp and behind a rock. "Avaaa!" he whined. "Tell the fish to slow down!"
Tony and Arno coasted to a stop at the gates just as a figure swam into view, parting the doors that easily dwarfed them. It was a soldier. The gray Cetacean Merrow dipped his head at the princes and parted the gates. “Your Royal Highnesses,” he said.
, cut out a clump of meat and fat and nibbled at it. He laid himself down half onto the sand, purposefully keeping his savior and captor in his side vision.
The metal-clad merman crooned, his expression soft. He gently pressed a metal hand to Steve's shoulder, which, strangely, soothed him.
The hole opened up to a large family area. Shelves were carved into the walls of the house. Tony could only guess what memories and accomplishments they used to hold. Beyond the family area was a hallway, opening up to the five bedrooms the house contained. Along the top of the corridor grew four pillar coral lights. Tony turned them on as he passed them, illuminating them to a comfortably dim setting, before coasting into the master bedroom.
The merman frowned and flicked his eyes towards her. She knew so much about this and he wanted to know why, but the suspicion in his gaze was quickly snuffed out by guilt. Perhaps she was in his position once. "Were you changed?"
Tony gently stroked the helmet, his thumb rolling over the cheek. He imagined the AI's mainframe desperately trying to reach out to the suit, watching and rewatching Tony's supposed last living moments. He imagined Pepper, his beloved Pepper, cataloguing every move he took all the while ruthlessly questioning the team; Happy, sitting silently on the couch; and Rhodey, his Honeybear, blaming himself for not being there.
"Right," he said softly, beginning to play around with his tail again. He downed a few more chunks of meat. "Where'd you put my suit?"
In a similar mechanical suit--this one black and silver and glowing orange--was his friend. Whether it was a machine or a merperson in a metal shell, they easily and repeatedly overpowered Ross. The GAIA agent snarled and swiped but he knew he was outmatched. When the orange merman glanced at Blue, he swung in place and bolted away.
Tony could only wave, smiling when Star hesitantly waved back. Then he turned and followed Arno as they left the house, locking the front door behind them.
Did Pepper hire a new doctor? Or was she always here? Whichever one it was, he did not recognize her voice.
After he put away the clothes, Tony set his eyes on the sheets. There was a depression in the stone floor against the wall, facing the alcove, which already had a mattress no doubt provided by the head offices at Arno’s request. Tony set to work making the bed, placing the protector sheets on first before covering those with a leopard seal print set of sheets. Star helped where he could.
Mother had set plates out and scooped the contents of the bowl into them. It was a kelp salad with chunks of poached eel, squid, and cod. Tony took a fork from the olivine tray and speared an eel chunk, looping a strip of kelp around it.
Blue filled his vision again, unusually bright. Although Steve's vision was blurred with pain--head injury, he had to remain awake--he saw that a face was before him. It wasn't Ross; no, a dark-haired man stared at him, a sharp-toothed but relieved smile on his face.
The woman—a nurse? a doctor? she was dressed in nothing that reminded him of doctor's scrubs and had a strange instrument looped over her shoulders—smiled at Steve. "Understand?" she asked, signing the word as well.
Steve recounted his forceful descent into the water, of the merman's claws digging into his skin, of the head injury. He had to quell the sardonic smile pulling at his lips. At least his memory was untouched. For now.
The light in his periphery was much dimmer than when he woke up, and his eye pain was down to an annoying ache. Tony cast Ava a sideways glance and saw the mermaid curled up like a cat two meters away, eating her own share of the meat. Her tail was mammalian in appearance, being blue gray with some irregular white spotting.
Silence again. The light faded away and with it went the ache in his eyes. Replacing the sun was the light of the reactor, bathing the environment before him blue while everything to his sides was swallowed up by darkness. Yet, despite that, every formless shape in the rocks, each bulb and leaf in the bed, the sand dunes and Ava's own seaweed bed--he saw them all in shades of gray and muted purples.
The mammal-tailed mermaid grinned, her eyes flashing an unsettling red-orange in the light of his arc reactor. "He doesn't take money, Stark. Food. Hunt for him." At the appalled expression on his face, Ava coiled upwards, laughing straight from her belly. "Ah, you have
Swimming lessons were in order, in addition to sign and verbal language, and history. Star’s stay most likely wasn’t permanent, but he should still learn about the culture, if only to navigate this world better.
“For us, over a thousand years. By the way, return to me in five tolls so that I may change the wrappings.”
appeared much better than the three months he spent under the eyes of the Ten Rings. Not preferred, of course, but at least he wasn't constantly fearing for his life. As of now. Besides, Ava had brought him his suit. Sure, he'd have to think
Above him was the moon, its form wavering erratically. Werewolves and the Moon, people thought the two had a connection. Dr. Erskine never mentioned the effects the moon had on werewolves or even human-turned-werewolves, and Steve never felt any more powerful under a full moon than he did under a crescent moon. But he prayed anyway, begging whatever--if anything--possessed the moon to heal the concussion he knew he'd have, that it wouldn't last too long, that he'd get to go back to the surface, that Natasha and the others search for him.
Star blinked open his eyes. Those little windows to the sky searched the room before fixating on Tony. Confusion was written all over his youthful face.
A sly smile formed on her face. "No, not me, but a friend of mine does. Of course, he'll expect payment for his services."
Blue dust swirled all around him; he'd been slapping and flicking his tail against the sand. "You got a lab?" Tony placed the helmet back onto the pile and turned to face Ava, who floated a respectful distance away. It was then that he was struck with quite the dilemma: what in the world kind of technology did mermaids have? If he had to repair a metal suit with rocks and clam shells he was going to drag himself through the streets of New York to get to his Tower.
Steve expected to be intercepted at any time. It's happened before, it'll happen again. He did not expect a man to slam him over the railing of the ship and plunge in after him. Steve had lashed out with his shield, the metal slicing through the water, but it hit nothing. He kicked, again and again, but the sharp hands always returned.
would possess a shield of such fine singing metal?—and such a man would probably not appreciate being mocked in a time of blundering weakness.
Steve didn't have the energy to wonder why. The black fuzz was now invading his mind, peaceful and comforting and urging him to just
Tony hesitated, but Arno flicked him gently with his tail. With a comforting smile, the elder prince led them to the table and they took their places between their parents.
Steve's shoulders slumped.  He should just come clean before he got himself into more trouble.  "I overheard him talking with someone named 'Rhodey'.  I didn't mean to."
"What you need to know is that Kang is coming from the future to kill Steve, and we have to stop that from happening.  I'm sending you the specs of all the important stuff and some transcripts of what
