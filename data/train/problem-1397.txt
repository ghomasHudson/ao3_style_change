A thousand questions formed and died in John's throat. He had to know, and yet he couldn't ask. Was Alexander... was he really? He
The choppy sound of helicopter blades slicing through the air began to echo towards them, the sound reverberating off of the enclosed space around them. The woman lifted her face up to the sky and smiled. "That would be Mycroft, punctual as always".
The stranger leaned over the bar slightly and changed his order to, "Two birthday cakes, please." When he leaned back into his seat he turned to face John and extended his hand "My name's Marcus. Pleased to meet you."
"Sherlock, maybe it's time you had some sleep, hm?" John suggested in his most soothing, reassuring doctor voice. He frowned when Sherlock didn't seem to hear him, and started to pick his way through to mess towards his flatmate.
Sherlock's eyes flittered over the both of them. The British government and the crime world of Brittan were in bed together...literally. Sherlock shared a glance with John, and the giggling became inevitable.
John's brow furrowed in concern. He repositioned himself to lean further over the letter, as thought this intensified concentration could perform the healing that John himself was unable to provide, given the distance between himself and his correspondent.
When he'd come in this morning she'd asked where John was, and Sherlock had stated the truth. "John Watson isn't part of my work anymore." He hadn't wanted to waste the breath on it yesterday, but the questions would keep coming if he didn't address them... People and their ludicrous sentiments...
"I like cooking for us," Mary insisted. She set the sauce aside on an unheated burner then bent to open the stove. When the Brussel sprouts were also set aside she turned and winked at him. "Anything to get out of doing the dishes afterwards."
had been in place long before Sherlock had jumped surged around him like a tidal wave and, for the first time, he knew what to call it...
John nodded. "I understand, but my situation has changed." There was a long moment of silence and John knew he would have to elaborate. He reminded himself again to stay calm and not include unnecessary detail. Sherlock was always going on about unnecessary detail being the first sign of a lie. "I wanted to focus more on my medical practice, so I moved out of 221 B."
Sara looked thoughtful for a moment before replying. "Even so, you've made a commitment to Mr. Holmes, and-"
Shaking his head, John trotted over to the two of them. He arrived in time to hear Sherlock launch into his explanation. "It became a pre-meditated crime of opportunity. There was all this money, just
"One should never underestimate the power of a sibling rivalry," James countered, taking another bite of his sandwich."
John supposed she did have a point about that. "Okay, pull your feet back, and part your knees for me," John instructed. Laurali did as she was told, bracing herself against the headboard and her husband's side. John reached forward and gently parted her labia, frowning as he did so. She was fully dilated. "Laurali, have you had contractions before now?" he asked.
Sweet, wonderful, surprising, protective John. If he would really offer Sherlock salvation, he deserved to know everything. Even so, Sherlock's fingers trembled in the fabric of John's shirt. He had never really been
Sherlock adjusted the bag of groceries that had rested in his arm all this while, allowing circulation back into his fatigued muscles. It was fortune that it was cold out, there was likely to be little if any damage to the produce because of his unplanned delay. He had just begun to step away to return to 221 B when Lestrade called for him. Sherlock turned his head and saw Lestrade waiving him over to the car. Sherlock frowned, but followed the summons.
John stared after him, appalled at the arrogance and contempt with which he and his sister's case had been treated. ...Still... He glanced down at the check in his hands. He had gotten what he came for, enough to get his sister some help. For that help, he'd have been willing to do something a great deal more distasteful than being viciously insulted by a man he would never see again.
Marcus gasped at the sensation and whispered, "Works for me." He stepped out of his trousers, which had long since slid to the floor, and pushed John back towards the bed. As they went, Marcus's hand shot out and pressed the light switch on the wall, which turned off the main lights and started the gas fireplace. He did know his way around the hotel, but John wasn't complaining. The soft light danced over Marcus's skin, making it glow.
Greg waved off John's concern. He was hardly one to judge considering how many work calls he took every day, and neither of them could hold a candle to Mycroft. Greg watched John speak quietly into the phone, a frown spreading over his face, and remembered the looks Rebecca used to give him when the Yard called. His ex had claimed that their marriage had fallen apart because Greg was always working and never made time for her. It wasn't that he hadn't loved her, he just loved his job too. Things were better with Mycroft. They both knew there were no guarantees that a night out or in wouldn't be interrupted, and so they made the best of what moments they did have.
Sherlock felt as if the whole world were wrapped in thick cotton, and he tried, unsuccessfully, to move.
"James?" John asked, snapping his head around towards the voice, peering down to see James's head peeking out a few levels down.
tempting... It would be nice to feel something, well, anything different from what he'd been feeling for the past several days. He licked his lips. "And you always succeed?"
Sherlock was undoubtedly brilliant, but John couldn't make himself suspect him. That moment of doubt on the train had settled it for him. If Sherlock wanted John gone he could've seized dozens of opportunities before this one. While their own private war of perspective was still technically going on, it hadn't seemed that important recently. There was something else going on...
Susan was leaning heavily on the wall now, halfway to her knees and breathing heavily. Before she could recover or Lestrade interject, Sherlock pressed on. "Is that why you never got a dog, Susan? Would Dan have beaten your dog too?"
help, but he didn't want to muddy the waters between them, especially not after tonight's conversation. Mary was his flatmate and she was becoming a good friend. He needed both in his life without any added complication right now.
Sherlock glanced up at the wreck. The man behind the wheel was slumped over it, pressing incessantly on the horn while worried onlookers debated the wisdom of moving him from the car. "Concussion, internal bruising and three cracked ribs," he reported. "He should be fine. He wouldn't be feeling anything if he were conscious, given his blood alcohol level."
John pressed his arms tightly to his sides, fighting the urge to wrap them around himself. It would not protect him.
This was the part of working that John didn't like: the politics. He wasn't sure if Sara really was open to giving him more hours or if she was just saying that to be polite. It was hard to know where he stood. He
John's slow, lazy smile was back. "The rest is just details then," the alpha assured him, giving his hands a squeeze.
John smiled a bit ruefully. "Yeah. Thought I was passed all this..." His throat felt tight again. Suddenly desperate for a change of subject he asked, "How's Greg doing?"
Because of his own internal distraction, and the incessant nagging of others, Sherlock had been avoiding cases. He'd always been persnickety about the way he selected and worked cases, but his recent avoidance was not part of the game. He would have to return to cases eventually, and the sooner the better. With time, everyone's insistence on John's return would evaporate. If he was very, very lucky, perhaps he would find a way to silence his own thoughts on the matter.
Sherlock, his eyes never leaving Bryan's, released his grip on Evelyn, allowing her to slink back towards the sofa she had been formerly occupying, where her mother now sat. "If a murder has taken place then there are secrets that will be better uncovered if involved parties have less time to generate a moderately cohesive
The ex-army doctor whirled around a stunned, overjoyed, and relieved smile breaking over his face as he rushed to meet his sister. "Harry!"
"He's in a bad way at present," Mycroft began, "but I assure you, he will recover." The hint of a smirk ghosted over Mycroft's lips. "I believe you made requests to meet him once he was returned? I even remember an offer to provide medical services, should they be required."
"Changing the medication orders for that patient you heard screaming," Sherlock explained, his eyes never leaving his phone.
John turned away in order to squash his sudden, and intense urge to ring the idiot's neck. He was heartless, irresponsible, and utterly without remorse. ...He really was a monster... The floorboards creaked as John leaned towards the exit. Except... he couldn't leave. Not without trying. This was his best, probably his only, chance. "You were right," he choked out, turning to face the lanky man once more.
He felt the baritone rumble in Sherlock's chest and knew the consulting detective was speaking to him. John couldn't quite make it out make it out, but it was comforting all the same. Sherlock's warmth, his steady heartbeat, and the soft rumbling of his voice slowly lulled John to sleep.
John frowned and looked over at his flatmate who was elbow deep in soot and other debris. He hadn't even looked up when before he'd scolded John. "I didn't say anything."
"Susan," Sherlock repeated in a low voice, smiling intimately at her, before slowly turning back to face her boyfriend.
"The third girl from the right on the front of the brochure?" Sherlock drawled, unenthused. "I know. You did
Sherlock turned, silhouetting his body in the light from the street, but John could still make out his face. "What should I play for you?" Sherlock repeated.
"Of course I can," Sherlock insisted, throwing his arm back over his eyes. His head had started pounding, and he knew from experience that the pressure would only get worse.
Sherlock paused when a breeze ruffled his curls, and looked up. It was a shaft, really, judging by the size of the grate covering it. It would be a scramble even to get into it, and it would be a tight fit, but it should do. Sherlock slipped his phone into the inside his trouser pocket, and reached up to remove the grate. It came away with a screech that was louder than Sherlock would have liked, but he wasn't overly concerned. The space underneath London creaked, groaned, and wailed more than an old farmhouse. Too many echoes from the trains, sewers, and the life taking place in the streets and buildings above.
They walked along, each lost in their separate thoughts, until Sherlock reached out and linked his arm with John's. He started to look up but Sherlock hissed, "Don't," and he turned his gaze back to the road before them. After a few moments, Sherlock spoke again, "We're being followed."
"Is this really the time for giggling?" Sherlock murmured, pulling John's belt free from his trousers.
Mary lifted her arm to her chest, rubbing the abused flesh. She had to be in pain, but her expression was calm as she lifted her eyes to his. "Another two seconds and you would have dislocated my elbow." Her eyes were sad, and there was no accusation in her voice, still John felt guilty.
John blinked rapidly and turned to face the door. He had to keep moving, get to a hotel, to safer ground. His heart thundered in his chest, and his hands shook as he made his way down the steps of 221 B for the last time.
It felt so good to be back to work, real work, as a doctor. He'd only just started at Charing Cross Hospital, but he already liked it very much. Targeting an accident and emergency hospital had been a good idea. It helped him use the skills he had, in a way that fed his own obvious need for an adrenaline rush.
It was possible this was all there was too it, a company in trouble, and an ill, elderly man pushing himself too far... but it wouldn't hurt to be thorough.
Mr. Murphy's fingers faltered over the keyboard, but just for a moment. He did go through the trouble of frowning and looking at Sherlock. "No, why would you have?"
Greg held his hands up in surrender, "Yes, fine. Since you were forced out, which I still think is the stupidest thing Sherlock has ever done." Greg took another breath as if steadying himself, and folding his hands in front of him on the table. "Sherlock is brilliant, John, that's always been the problem. He's too brilliant for his own good. He's also
What would that be like? To know that those people who you cared about most thought you were dead... John didn't have it in him to leave someone like that so alone.
John sighed softly, reminded all over again of Sherlock and his own thoughts earlier today. "I suppose I do."
She told him, and he made quick work of sending her prescription out to it electronically. John was a fast typist, one had to be as a doctor because of all the charting that was required, so he managed to finish his notations in a few short minutes.
Sherlock shifted, pulling his arm down, and blinking up at John as the ex-army doctor's hand slid over his cheek and came to rest on his forehead.
Sherlock could hear the worry in Lestrade's voice. He knew what Lestrade was really asking, but he couldn't offer any reassurances. He didn't have any time to waste, so he hung up the phone, silenced it, and slid it into his jacket pocket. Sherlock turned and shared a short, grim look with Mary.
John nodded patiently, not appearing at all frazzled. "The protocols the Yard has to follow can be very time consuming, but only because they never want to miss anything on an investigation. I know you want your wife back safely, that's what we all want. Right now this investigation is just in the beginning stages, and we need to make sure we're well organized. Sherlock can get a little excitable sometimes, that's probably why he rushed out here to the back garden so quickly. While they get their plan together, why don't you tell me more about your shelter? I hear it's been a fixture in the community for years."
John stood and steered a fidgeting Alex to sit beside his wife. "Coach her through her breathing," he instructed, "I'm going to see how much she's dilated."
There was another long moment of mutual glowering before Sherlock whirled around and strode out of the room. John stood, nodded at Miss. Williams and murmured, "Thank you for meeting with us."
this man, and if they didn't have the alpha and omega dynamics between them, they might have come together sooner…but the truth was never easy to face, only to observe.
John reached for the ledge of the train station platform and heaved, trying to scramble up and over the ledge. People lingered nearby, hesitant expressions plastered over their faces, uncertain whether they should interfere or if it was safer to let the mad British man pass.
Her weding ring was in immaculate condition, but that was to be expected in any wealthy family. Married parties in any family that felt themselves to be influential and powerful would keep up appearances, regardless of how they actually felt. No, the tell for a happy marriage in a person of influence was the skin underneath their ring, and Sherlock could see a distinct tan line and impression in the skin when Mrs. Wallingford brought her hands together and began to fiddle with her wedding band.
John could feel Marcus smile against his neck and lean up to press a kiss to John's temple. John spread more lube on his fingers, and pressed them against Marcus's entrance. Marcus sighed and leaned back, arching his back as he felt John's fingers inside him. John thrust the last inch inside roughly, pulling a moan from Marcus's lips.
, hunting all over London for a man who was forever underfoot, and he'd inadvertently given him every possible advantage through John...
John bristled at Sherlock's utter lack of compassion, but he reigned in his temper. If this Anna was really in trouble, then the only way Mr. Miller might ever see her again was through Sherlock's efforts. He
John turned around to face him. "Pardon?" His voice and face were carefully neutral, but he suspected his nervousness had been detected anyway.
to each other, Johnny!" She had laid her head sideways on her arms and was sobbing in earnest now. Her hair hung limp and wet with perspiration around her face. "It's
John smiled and shook his head, pleased and grateful for her protective streak. He was used to protecting others, not being protected.
Mary must have seen him looking because she said, "I was in a bad car accident when I was younger. Since then I get migraines sometimes, and indirect light is easier to manage."
John snorted with laughter and shook his head. "No. That miser won't even pay for his own cab rides to and from cases. Every time, I swear, he practically breaks the sound barrier getting out of the cab and sticks me with the bill."
he had seen in writing that had shocked him so much. Molly, naturally, assumed it was the death certificate as a whole, that further confirmation of his loss.
Before the security guards could restrain him, Sherlock leapt for the coffin once more, using his left arm to wrench the coffin off its dais. There was a collective gasp as the coffin tumbled to the group, some if its wooden paneling shattering on impact. John watched in horror as his barbaric flatmate violently shoved the body aside and scrabbled at the fractured wood. Security had caught up to him again, and were beginning to pull him away once more. "John! She's still breathing!"
The intensity of his own scowl was starting to give him a headache, and he flopped dramatically into his chair, head lolling. He had just started to review his mind palace, wondering if he had a firearm of his own (John had taken his with him) when something glinting by the fireplace caught his attention. Making the monumental effort to turn his head, Sherlock's eyes locked on John's old cane. It had gathered dust and a few cobwebs over the years, but neither of them had ever thrown it out.
John expected an argument, but there was none, just a small pause before Sherlock turned and sat on the Sofa as he'd been bid. John watched him for a moment, frowning. He didn't
If he had any rational fear left it should have returned now, John's teeth were still in his neck for goodness sake! He could rupture an artery if he wasn't careful! And yet, Sherlock couldn't seem to muster any more fear. Instead he leaned heavily against his alpha, exhaustion sweeping over him from many sleepless hours spent trying to come to a solution that didn't involve bonding or dying. The deed was done now, and if there was anyone he
Molly swallowed hard and blinked, tears sliding silently down her cheeks. "He-he asked me to let Mycroft's team handle the autopsy in the event of his death." John leaned forward now, just managing not to shake the poor women in front of him, so that she would hurry up. "The strange thing though, was that he asked me to be the one to sign the death certificate, after I had the autopsy report."
"Welcome Home, Papa," Laurali breathed, pulling Sherlock in for fierce hug. Although she was in her ninth month of pregnancy, she was adamant about not being treated as though she were fragile. She was still as strong as ever.
"Nothing is more frightening than the unknown," the counselor continued, scanning the room as she spoke, speaking to all the patients once more. "There's a reason why they never want to show you the monster in horror movies. Nothing is worse than what your own brain will come up with, when left to its own devices. If being a drunk or an addict has taken over your life, as is so often the case when addiction persists, it can be hard to remember ever being someone different. For some people, especially if they started young, it can feel like they never were anything else, like they never had the chance to be. When you're seeking recovery it can feel like your left behind, and everyone else has already figured out who they are."
A chill ran down Sherlock's spine and he glanced up to see John furiously scribbling notes on paper as he barked questions into the phone. "What is her blood pressure? Has she been responsive to light or sound? What is her O2 sat?"
?" He took a long drink from one the glasses of water the waitress had left while Greg was waiting for John to arrive. "Mycroft must be losing his touch."
John glanced up at his medical texts and journals, remembering a specific anecdote one of his old professors had drilled into his head.
John had taken a few more steps back and turned away from Sherlock so that he could focus all of his attention on this call. He never heard the slight vibration that was Sherlock's text alert. Taking slow, deep breaths in the hopes of restoring normal vitals, Sherlock pulled his phone out and stared at the screen.
The sharp trill of John's text alert shattered their peaceful interlude. John sighed and picked up his phone.
"Morphine," Molly said, holding out an empty bottle in a clear plastic bag, with the Narcan label still clearly visible. "Strong, hospital grade morphine."
"She's in her seventh rehab center. She's had her ups and downs, that's to be expected. I just...I really want her to be okay this time, but I don't want her to feel that kind of pressure."
Lestrade had both hands slightly raised in a pacifying gesture. "Mr. Werner, Sherlock is the most observant man I've ever met. He doesn't miss anything. That's important for a missing persons case, because our best chance of finding your wife alive is in the first forty-eight hours."
to believe that." John shook his head for a moment then squared his shoulders. "Right, well I'd better catch up with him or he'll take his own cab there and stick me with the bill for both."
They were seated by the fireplace, and John was more grateful than was reasonable that the table did not have a candle. Once their drinks were ordered, they were left to peruse the menu at their leisure. After a few moment's Mary's voice broke the silence, "You've been at Charing Cross for a while now, is it everything you hoped it would be?"
"Hm? Of course," Sherlock replied, his eyes sweeping the signature he had obtained from the ballerina. "See the hesitation marks here?" he gestured to the space between the "d" and the "e" of Ms. Adeline's autograph. "She's not used to writing her name that way. It's a stage name of some kind that obviously closely resembles her true name. Possibly an anagram, or an imperfect anagram. No one has proper respect for ciphers anymore."
Part of John wanted to turn an leave immediately, get to a safe place before he could even begin to examine the damage, part of him wanted to hit Sherlock for being so cold... the rest of him… John looked around 221 B wondering if this would really be the
Sherlock was staring at him, grinning like a lunatic, his eyes burning with some mad passion John didn't even
John saw the movement and slapped Sherlock's hand away, one of his own leaving it's mooring at Sherlock's hip to grasp his straining cock. "Mine!" John growled again, pumping his hand over the hot organ.
"When you first met me, and that was longer ago than you realize, I was Irene Adler." He voice was sultry and bubbling over with amusement.
Sherlock's sleeping face was flushed with the healthy color of someone at rest; and the good doctor was glad to see his fever hadn't returned. John lifted his hand to Sherlock's wrist, taking his pulse, satisfied to find it steady and strong. He wasn't sure how long he lay like that, but his guilty conscience insisted that it had to be over an hour. Still, it was an event worth committing to memory. Sherlock was almost never so still...
"I only met her tonight." Sherlock clarified, rolling his eyes at Mr. Walker's obvious hunt for any reason or excuse he could use to turn Sherlock away.
Mary stared at the phone until it stopped ringing, then glanced up at Sherlock one more time before rolling her eyes and walking towards the door to collect her coat. That's when the texts started, one after another in rapid succession, almost like a knocking.
you, Sherlock," John repeated. "I'll be happier with you than I'll ever be without you. I knew that the moment I came back to 221 B."
Sherlock leaned up into the kiss, pulling John down towards him. John pushed against him, pushing them both into the back of the plush sofa. Sherlock hummed gently in satisfaction when he felt John's hands converge on his tie, slowly working it free. Sherlock gasped into their kiss when he felt John pull his tie away and start to work on the buttons of his shirt. Sherlock's fingers trembled again and he pulled John closer, half untucking John's shirt in the process. He wanted to finish the job and run his fingers up the bare skin of John's back, but he hesitated until John pulled back and murmured, "I
John smirked, unapologetic, "Don't be discouraged. I have it on good authority that most people are idiots."
The world's only consulting detective withdrew his prize and delicately examined it. It appeared to be a book with scraps of mementos stuffed between its pages, carefully wrapped in a clear plastic bag. He glanced over his shoulder and shared a meaningful look with his blogger then they shifted and moved as one out of the ruined house.
John, who had long ago stopped trying to correct her (It wasn't worth it—she was convinced John had rented 221 C for Harry only) smiled warmly and greeted her. "Good afternoon, Mrs. Hudson. What have you got there?"
John's face had crumpled with sympathy. Sherlock, naturally, observed this, and because he found such sentiment oppressive, he rushed to complete his story. "He did inherit a good portion of his family's money, when his father fell ill and died a year later. Most likely his father's pre-existing heart condition was aggravated by the stress of his past."
The smartest thing for any aspiring criminal to do would be to sell the trade agreement to the highest bidder on the black market, where it could then be used for blackmail. The fact that nothing of the sort appeared to have happened, was exactly what had allowed Sherlock to deduce the document's location.
"Thank you for a lovely evening, Mary," John began. "I haven't had a proper dinner like that in a long time."
For all the bravado he might show Mycroft and the rest of the world, every day was a bad day, just some were worse than others. He still worked at the surgery, still went on with things, just as he'd thought to himself when Mycroft was attempting to read him the riot act, but it
"What?" John asked, glancing into the bathroom, then back up at Sherlock's rapidly retreating form. "What did you find?"
Sherlock was not in the least deterred from his course of action. Of course he had heard John, his ears still worked. It was merely irrelevant data and immediately dismissed. The ring
They leaned forward and their lips met in a soft, sweet kiss. One of Sherlock's hands tightened in the fabric of John's collar, and the other slipped into his short hair, holding John to him. John leaned forward, one knee pushing into the fabric of the sofa, pressing against Sherlock's hip. John parted his lips, and Sherlock's tongue met his halfway as John moved forward to straddle Sherlock's lap. John's hand pushed inside Sherlock's suit jacket, pressing against the fabric of Sherlock's oxford shirt, and cupping his side. John's other hand looped up and over Sherlock's shoulder.
Sherlock began to rub his temples as though he were having a migraine. His tone of voice indicated he felt as though he were explaining something to an exceptionally slow child. "How would you throw a body off a bridge?"
Bright winter sunlight peeked around the edges of Sherlock's curtains and dappled his bedroom. John sighed and stretched, reviling in the wonderful warmth of the room. It wasn't hot by any means, just comfortably warm. John realized, as he stretched, that the flannel sheets and blankets-there were a surprising number of blankets-had fallen to his waist, and his pillow was breathing.
," Sherlock had snapped. He reached forward and tore the remaining toast from John's plate with such force that he knocked the plate from John's hands, and it shattered on the floor. John had continued to stare as Sherlock shoved the toast roughly into his mouth, wolfing it down like an animal. "
Sherlock blinked and looked to his left. Mrs. Hudson was sat on John's armchair, sipping her own cup of tea. Between them, on the coffee table, was a tea pot, another cup with saucer, and a plate of biscuits.
"If you're speaking of a physically broken and/or ruptured heart, then I must agree. There are 172 ways to die of a broken heart." He dipper her low as the song ended; she arched her head back and smiled.
Struck by sudden inspiration, John pierced the second half of the scallop he had cut with his fork and lifted it to the edge of Sherlock's cupids bow lips.
John Watson strode forward and yanked Sherlock backwards, away from that snake of a women, and into his arms. "Sherlock Holmes is mine!" he declared.
serve food, and he supposed they could serve cake, but the man was alone, he didn't look like he was celebrating a birthday...
The spider he was after wasn't untouchable, but they were immaculate. All of Sherlock's attempts to follow the web back to the originator had failed, regardless of how subtle. Every time there was the slightest hint that anyone might be closing in the spider severed its line and disappeared. With more time he could move slowly, pen this spider in its own traps, but the time for subtlety was over.
"You're welcome," John replied, leading Mary up the sleek stairway. Their seats were located in the front center of the first balcony. This vantage point would allow them to clearly see the entire stage without being so far way that they would miss anything. Nikki had been very thoughtful in her selection.
Toby was returned to Lauren without incident. Well, there was a great deal of mutual glaring and silent threats before John intervened, shaking Lauren's hand and thanking her for her kind help. Laruen, while still visibly perturbed, was at least mollified enough to let them leave.
"Every rose has it's thorns..." he mused quietly to himself, and knew he had his answer. Whatever Sherlock had felt, John had found an unexpected home in 221 B, and he wasn't giving it up without a fight.
They hadn't really planned this, the first time it had happened, but since then it had become an unspoken tradition whenever they could get away to share lunch in the park. John liked it. It was so nice to be part of a team instead of being the only one holding everything together. James was just about the only uncomplicated thing in his life right now, and John was grateful for it.
." The world's only consulting detective had a fit worthy of a BAFTA, and a two year old, when John had tried to remove
John's lips trailed over Sherlock's cheek, approaching his lips. "Do you remember your safe word?" John asked.
"Sherlock," Lestrade sighed, exasperated, "I'd rather be safe than sorry. Something doesn't feel right."
The man who had greeted him, Fredrick if his name tag was to be believed, looked down at his computer for a moment, clicking and typing for a few moments, before his face darkened.
John's cheery, 'I'm home!' died on his lips when he flicked on the lights and there was an answering groan of pain from the sofa. His gaze flew to the crumpled form of the world's only consulting detective huddled in a tight ball under a quilt on the sofa. John didn't even pause to take off his coat as he closed the distance between them and knelt by Sherlock's head.
Sherlock waited a beat, but she made no move to reply, although she seemed to relax slightly. He pressed on before her boyfriend could interject. "I ask because my landlady just acquired a small Spaniel from her nephew, and she's looking for a little help walking him." Sherlock shrugged, indicating the bag of groceries in his arms. "I was just helping her with the shopping when I recognized you, so I thought I would ask about the dog walking."
Oh. Was that all? ...That was underwhelming. "Probably to make it look like you did the autopsy. No one's really supposed to know about Mycroft's agents," John muttered, his eyes fixed to the tile floor beneath his feet. Did this 'revelation' mean anything other than that? Not likely. He mentally kicked himself for getting so excited over a simple cover story. When had he taken to grasping at straws? Sherlock had always admonished him to make the theory fit the facts, and not the other way around.
with her. Desperately so. He only would have gotten in the way. No, he's done his job, and now it's time for me to start doing mine."
true. John glanced once over his shoulder and grinned when he saw James had also turned around to wave at him. He waved back, before facing forward once more. Romantic relationships where definitely out of the question...for now, anyways.
Alex rushed forward, lifter her arm over his shoulders and wrapping his other arm around her wait. "Let's get you to the hospital," he said calmly, although his hands were already shaking.
Mycroft's intellect and observation rivaled his own, but the idiot had devoted himself to politics, which meant that, even though he had known the truth before coming to Sherlock, he'd needed his little brother to do his dirty work for him.
Thank you to all who have left comments, kudos, bookmarked, and/or subscribed to this story!  You guys are awesome.  ^_^
John looked down at the tickets in his hand, reading for the first time, the name of the ballet he would be attending. He smiled and reached for his phone, calling Mary. When she answered he replied, "Hey, any chance I could convince you to come see Swan Lake with me?"
John chuckled. He was used to not getting a hello when he called people, but Mary's question was much nicer than Sherlock's order to "Speak" or to ignore his call and start texting him.
"Thank you," John replied with a fake smile he hoped looked genuine. In this moment he could understand Sherlock's frustration with niceties. Sherlock managed without them, but John wasn't him, and couldn't ever really operate that way. He was just hurting now, and everything was taking a little more effort than normal. It would get better. It had too.
Von Rothbart burst onto the stage, stirring up the waters of the lake with a terrible storm, and John was expecting a tragic ending, as was so common for this ballet. Some endings were more tragic than others. The 'best' endings often had both Odette and Prince Siegfried dying with some insinuation that they reunited in the afterlife. There were worse endings, were one lover was left alive, or where Odette was forever taken away by Von Rothbart.
"Not if you're trying to go undetected. Spread a few bad medicines in with the rest and assuming your target is likely to need the medicine, and be brought to Charing Cross, you'll get them eventually. If a few other people go out with them, well that could have been a bad batch of Narcan. It's not likely to lead back to the individual planting them," Sherlock explained. "No, Mary's right, romance is least likely in this case. Regret is equally unlikely, regret killings tend to be murder suicides."
he turned he was confronted with reminders of John's absence, and instead of deleting irrelevant details and refocusing, his mind would stutter over a memory and lose its way entirely.
Sherlock still did not even deign to meet John's eyes. "Bring back some bagels from the King Street Deli. You always stop there when you're going to see your boyfriend."
"I saw what you did with that girl." Mary said, her voice still casual, her fingers still busy at the keys and at the mouse.
His plans for the evening had been materially altered. He wouldn't risk going close to 221 B tonight, but he didn't want to sleep rough with Nikki's prized possession when he'd just agreed to assist her. He knew several places that would accept cash payment for a room for the night, and two of them were safe enough for him to use his phone to hack Charing Cross's security system and observe John without the need to spend any additional attention monitoring the violin, assuming he locked the door behind him. Sherlock quickly decided on a specific motel, and set off along into the night.

He was in love, but not with John. He'd been in love for years. He had the same quiet, resigned demeanor John had these last few years. He was in love but didn't believe he could have the person he did love. Instead he made a habit of one night stands.
"Sherlock," John spoke quietly, but his tone conveyed a seriousness that thickened the atmosphere in the room.
Sherlock offered a languid thumbs up, and John helped him maneuver until John was sitting on the sofa with Sherlock's head pillowed in his lap.
Lestrade stepped into the opening that Sherlock had created and started speaking softly with Susan. Sherlock couldn't quite make out their voices but he could read lips. He watched Lestrade suggest that they talk privately, away from all this noise. Lestrade offered to escort her back to the station himself, and in a separate car from Dan. Susan started to glance up after a moment, started to look to Dan, but Sherlock shifted, and intercepted her gaze with a meaningful one of his own. Slowly he lifted one eyebrow and waited. At last she turned back to Lestrade and nodded once.
James shrugged and said, "It's only a few medical supplies, though I must admit I'm also curious about what he wants a size twenty three scalpel for."
had taken out a restraining order in Anna's name against me." He shook his head, reigning in his focus. "I stormed up just as she was leaving; there was enough of a crowd out that she didn't quite see me until I was right up next to her." He jutted out his chin defiantly, his eyes hardening. "Anna had chicken pox when she was three, like most kids, and since then she's had a small round scar in the hollow of her right cheek.
needed to know his place. Everything would turn out as Sherlock had said it would, things always did. Harriet would relapse, John would become embittered, and Sherlock would close a trap around the greatest criminal master mind in the country...once he had more evidence...and then he would die...
John knew he had not convinced or reassured the young morgue assistant that he was fine. For the first time in almost three years he was as "not fine" as he could ever remember being, and it showed. He'd locked the door after she'd gone, not wanting to bother dealing with concerned friends who would come calling later.
The edges of the man's lips curled upwards as if he wanted to laugh, but then he glanced at Sherlock, and thought better of it. "It's not a problem. I've heard that Mr. Holmes is the best, and that's all I care about. My name's Arnold Miller."
"I don't think I'm in much danger of that," John assured her. If anything he needed the work for his own sense of well-being. He was still in danger of having too much time to think, especially if Sherlock could creep into his mind so often during one interview.
"No, you're not. You're desperate to be rid of me; and Nikki by the looks of it. You don't like her, and you may owe someone a favor, given your less than reputable business dealings. Offering them first chair violin might help you repay that favor given how determined you are to seize this 'opportunity.'"
Sherlock lifted his gaze from Mrs. Wallingford and scanned the room; it contained three other people. There were two reasonably tall, mildly athletic males in their mid-twenties, and a slender dark hared young woman who was approximately eighteen. The men were not twins, but they bore a striking resemblance to each other. Each wore a personally tailored suit and an expensive tie, and each had a clean shaven face with neatly trimmed brown hair that looked quite a bit more manageable than their mother's. The biggest difference between them was that one of them, most likely the oldest and heir presumptive, had a much harsher expression, and the other looked more sad.
John scrubbed gravel and dirt out of the dreadful scrape along Sherlock's shoulder, cursing colorfully under his breath. "That was an idiotic thing to do, Sherlock!" he scolded, "A very
John closed his eyes and held the letter tightly in his hands. He was so proud of his sister. It was always easiest to run away when things are difficult or overwhelming, and Harry seemed so easily overwhelmed these days... In his letter back he would make sure to tell her he was proud of her. She was doing the difficult thing, the thing that probably felt impossible to her, but she had also been correct in her belief that it would probably be the thing most likely to save her life. She wouldn't live much longer, going on like she had been.
. No background noise to filter out, no conversations to ignore, and no lingering gazes that seemed to burn the skin they rested on.
John blew on his paper to dry the ink, and smiled to himself. He felt a bit lighter. Even knowing that Mycroft wouldn't be back until a few days from now to pick up his letter, John found himself already anxious for a reply.
"Not the whole thing," John protested, shoving against Sherlock once more. "But yes, I think I would like to know what happens."
They said their goodbyes and John hung up the phone, a small smile on his lips, pleased with the steps he had taken to put his life in order. It wasn't going to be a fast process, but he would see it through, one step at a time.
Something pricked at the back of John's mind as he considered Molly's words. She was a very dedicated, organized morgue assistant. Why
If anyone would spare him that conversation, he'd thought it would be Molly... It'd been three years, John had thought he was
Mr. Murphy stared at Sherlock for a long, hard moment before replying in a low voice, "Yes, I have just the thing." He stood, walked around his desk, and left the room.
John paused for a moment to stare into the fire with a small smile on his lips. As much as it hurt to see reminders of Sherlock in Alexander's letters, in a strange way it helped ease part of the ache inside him. Picking up his pen again, John continued writing:
seen these texts, but he hadn't let himself dwell on them. Sherlock was none of his concern, not any longer. …If Sherlock had been truly isolated, John's conscience might have prevailed upon him to do more, but as it was Sherlock had Mrs. Hudson, Greg, and Mycroft looking out for him. Mrs. Hudson was much more formidable than most people would give her credit for, Greg had been looking after Sherlock for years, and Mycroft, for all of his foibles, really did love his brother, and would never, if it was within his power, let anything happen to Sherlock.
They shared a wan smile before a waitress who either had no ability to read the mood at their table, or, if it was possible, cared less for social niceties than Sherlock, approached them and asked for their order. Sherlock had turned towards the waitress, given her their drink orders, and turned back to John.
Mary chuckled softly, "It's not all that hard, really. Anyways I had to be, Sean was utterly hopeless in the kitchen." She glanced and John again and added, "I take it you're the same way?"
With a growl John pushed Marcus backwards onto the bed. This momentarily broke their connection, but only momentarily. John followed Marcus down, covering his body with his own. John lifted Marcus's legs over his shoulders, realigned himself, and pushed inside.
"I'll hold you to it," James replied with a warm smile. He reached forward and handed John the small baguette that had come with his soup. "At least take something for the road."
Sherlock frowned again and studied the view out of his own window. For just a moment John wondered if he'd glimpsed the wounded person this beast of a man used to be... From what little John knew no one really liked this man who could read their deepest secrets as though they had them written on their foreheads... It couldn't be easy to see that rejection time and time again because of something that seemed to come so naturally...
Greg were waiting for him. Apparently it wasn't good enough that he was working cases again. They were still 'concerned'. His behavior was still altered. They were right about his behavior being altered, but Sherlock still considered their reaction hyperbolic. They wanted to do something, but there was nothing to do. John was gone, and both Sherlock and he were going about their lives.
Ms. Adeline leaned towards her assistant, who whispered something to her. She nodded, then straightened once more, returning the programs to Sherlock. "My apologies. It appears I'm needed elsewhere."
in his jacket pocket. That was what he had found in Ms. Adeline's hiding place. It was empty, but the message was jarring. Was this some veiled reference to his cursed poisoning? How? Molly had worked alone; there was no evidence to the contrary. Stranger still, as he had turned the syringe around in his fingers, examining it, his phone had rung. He'd snatched at it in a hurried attempt to silence it, and stopped cold when he saw the name on the phone.
"I understand, it's just—" John was abruptly cut off when his phone started to ring. John frowned. "I'm sorry I need to take this. There's been a bit of a family emergency going on lately."
case, and this is vital evidence. If you insist, of course I will be happy to phone Detective Inspector Lestrade and bring a full investigation team. After, of course I calculate half of your net worth and alimony for your wife."
John glanced down at the birth records, which still rested in Sherlock's lap. "I imagine these are proof of the switched babies, but exactly, how do they factor in?"
"You are, if I have to club you over the head and drag you there myself," John insisted. While adamant, his tone did not have the same bite as his words. He wanted to see his sister well again, and he would do whatever was necessary towards that end. He'd been watching her self-detox for three days now, trying to convince her to go to the hospital. He was
John took a deep, measured breath and reached for her letter, which lay, slightly crumpled on the dresser. He'd found it on the coffee table the night he'd returned to the flat. He hadn't wanted to come back, he hadn't been able to stay in 221 B at all after Sherlock's fall, but at the same time he
the most important thing in his life, and the best and only thing he could do for John now, was to stay far away from him.
As they rode, John intermittently peered over at his captor, trying to study him discreetly. His efforts were, apparently, fruitless. Ten minutes into their ride Sherlock turned to face him, one eyebrow raised high. John flushed with embarrassment, but did not shy away.
"Don't know. I will soon enough, but the bathroom provided me with a more interesting line of inquiry that will yield results much more quickly."
Sherlock lifted his hand and ran his fingertips down the spine. He paused, shifted his hand and repeated the gesture with The Principles and Practice of Medicine. What he felt, combined with his certainty that people were idiots, compelled Sherlock to lift The Practical Management of Pain from the shelf. Sherlock held the book closed so that the spine was parallel to the floor, then let it fall open in his hands. If there was a page the book was opened to most often, this method of opening the book would highlight that section. Most of the pages were intact, but near back of the book, the pages swelled unnaturally, indicating a bookmark of some sort. Sherlock turned a few pages, the book had opened close to the back, and was confronted with an obituary.
Mary had turned on the gas fireplace and set the table in front of it with a plate on either side along with a glass of water and a glass red of wine. John could see she'd spread the vegetables in a circle around the plate, and nestled the salmon in the center. It was a very inviting picture.
Sherlock turned and made his way back to Lestrade and John, both of whom were frowning. "Well?" Lestrade asked wearily, his expression broadcasting his growing headache to the world.
"Fire is certainly dramatic," Sherlock agreed, "But he did a good enough job that it looked like an accident, and he didn't even use the fireplace..." Sherlock's voice trailed off and his gaze narrowed. "Idiot!" he hissed, stalking over to the largely intact chimney.

." Sherlock spat the word as if it were unclean. "It's painfully obvious that you harbor more than friendly feelings for '
John's expression became stern. "Sherlock, you can't work as effectively if you're not healthy. I'm surprised you work as well as you do with the way you starve yourself and never sleep." The good doctor reached back and lifted the tablets and glass of water from the low table. "Take your medicine."
John smirked as he reached out and brought the mug to his lips. "Don't worry, I wasn't about to assume you were going soft on me. Do you even
John sputtered and pulled away, his hand clenching reflexively at the tingling sensation that spread through him as his fingers brushed Sherlock's. What was
Sherlock's heart jumped in his chest, and his skin flushed with genuine warmth for the first time in a long time. "You, John. I want you," Sherlock murmured, watching an infectious smile bloom across John's face. John leaned forward, his breath ghosting across Sherlock's face, and sealed their lips together in a kiss. Their joined hands pressed into the pillow beside Sherlock's head as he leaned up into the kiss, parting his lips and meeting John's tongue with his own.
"Morphine." John's reply was clipped, but it was all Sherlock needed. This was the missing piece he'd been searching for, all those weeks ago.
"Well, he was talking to some officers of the Yard, arguing is more like it, when he stepped back and declares that he can tell you the whole truth about any person, just by looking at him, and he would offer five thousand pounds to anyone who could prove him wrong." Mike smiled ruefully. "A few officers took him up on it right there and, damn, but he was ruthless. He spat out all sorts of private information about them, things their co-workers had no right knowing. The Detective Inspector on-scene threatened to arrest him after he said the Detective Inspector's wife was cheating on him."
When he at last drew his gaze up to the windows of his flat he sighed, squared his shoulders, and went in.
"Come on, Watson," Dr. Bailey broke in. John hadn't noticed him enter the break room. He was a large man with brown hair and brown eyes. He was a good doctor but John had always found his people skills lacking. "You haven't been denying it for years now. There's no need to start again, just because things ended. That's childish."
Three caseless days later Sherlock was loitering in the doorway to the sitting room, watching John read. The fire crackled merrily in the fireplace, warding off the winter chill. He
His legs carried him down streets, around corners, and, eventually, to the edge of a cemetery he'd not been to in three years. John halted at the gates, panting and shaking. At first, just after Sherlock's fall, John had thought it was their flat he couldn't handle, but that wasn't it. He couldn't stay away from the flat for too long, because it wasn't the memories of Sherlock's life which truly pained him. It was the memories of Sherlock's fall. It was the grave; the proof of a truth he could never fully accept.
...and he didn't have to wait here. If Sherlock...if Alexander...if he returned to London, he would find John no matter where he was.
They walked together to the door, which Mary opened for him. "I'll see you again next Thursday?" Mary asked.
The priest paused again, and stepped down behind the coffin. He leaned over Mary's body and made the sign of the cross, murmuring, "May the Lord bless you and keep you. May the Lord make his face to shine upon you, and be gracious unto you. May the Lord lift up the light of his countenance upon you, and give you peace, now and ever more. Let there be peace for all. Amen."
A young couple huddled together under the awning as they walked down the street. They were walking towards Sherlock, in the space of a quarter of a minute they'd be past him and on their way. The man was tall with broad shoulders, dark eyes, and a strong jaw. The woman also had dark features, with stunningly pale blue eyes. She was shorter than the man she was with, but actually a bit tall for a woman, and had a strong frame. Her rain coat was plain and black.
A moment of heavy silence stretched out before the other man replied, "I apologize, my men reported he had gotten on the train. I will take care of them."
. "I'll make sure not to overindulge then. Something tells me it's going to be a long...energetic night."
A wry smile crept over Mary's features. "Drinks at the pub with your Detective Inspector friend doesn't count as going out?"
Once they were alone they seated themselves on opposite sofas, facing each other. Sherlock sat forward with his elbows on his knees and his hands steepled in front of his chin. Ms. Wallingford sat as she had before, with her hands folded delicately in her lap, her gaze fixed on them. Sherlock let the silence build between them for a long moment before he spoke.
Sherlock arched a superior eyebrow at his husband. "It worked, did it not? Besides, danger has been a part of the equation since we began our partnership."
John rolled his eyes and reached forward to lift the phone out of Sherlock's pocket, trying to ignore the heat he could feel radiating off of Sherlock's body. "
Evelyn frowned and stared at the carpet for a moment before lifting her gaze back to his. "Something to do with investments? He's explained it before, so have my brothers, but I don't really have a good head for math."
John stayed pressed firmly into Sherlock for a long moment before easing himself down against Sherlock's chest. Sherlock's fingers swept possessively over John's back as he cradled the ex-army doctor against him.
Sherlock sighed softly, drawing back the covers and venturing forth into the sitting room. John met him part way with a plate in each hand, tea was already sitting on the low table by the sofa. John smiled warmly, leaning forward to press a gentle kiss to Sherlock's mouth.
to think," he murmured in his bloggers ear as he led them along. "Two people enjoying a performance together are hardly likely to draw as much attention to themselves as someone alone. I want to be invisible in the crowd."
he hadn't been dating these past few years. "I'm sorry, James. My life is so chaotic now that I wouldn't be good for
John whirled to face her, pointing vehemently back the way they had come. "He'll stop at nothing to get what he wants!"
John thought very little of these most recent texts. He didn't see anything in them beyond Greg's desire for an explanation and, perhaps, a desire for a return to normalcy. If Sherlock thanked someone, was cooperative, or didn't verbally eviscerate someone, it was probably because that was the most expedient thing to do for the case, or because he was distracted by something he deemed "more important."
John had been sitting by the fireplace, eating some toast with his tea, when Sherlock stormed out of his bedroom and began meticulously studying something under the microscope on his desk. Weary of the silence that had permeated the flat between fights, John had attempted to make casual conversation.
John let out a soft sigh of defeat. This was not a battle he felt up to today, however she had gotten the idea into her head. Instead, he opted for changing topics. "Thank you for bringing in the post, Mrs. Hudson."
"Did you know that the chef hand picks the mushrooms for his risotto from his personal garden?" Sherlock asked, casually draping a hand over John's free one. John's hand twitched in rebellion, and he tried to disguise the movement by turning it over to press his palm to Sherlock's. He wanted to pull away, but his flatmate's grip tightened once more, and he felt the bite of trimmed nails in his flesh.
Sherlock whirled, twisting so he was crouched just outside the doorway and to one side. While covering Laurali's body with his own, he was able to give Mycroft's snipers a clear shot. The danger had passed in a matter of minutes. The lectures, however, continued at length.
Tim's face crumpled slightly as though he was about to cry. He took a deep breath and whispered. "We lost someone…just now."
"Hey," she said, smiling back. She slipped into the office and sat on a chair beside him. "How was your day?"
"When she gives her statement tell her about New Life Friends Shelter. It's focused on pairing female victims of domestic violence with therapy dogs," Sherlock said, settling the bag of groceries securely in his arms once more.
Sherlock gazed after him for a moment perplexed and unnerved, then John squeezed his hand again and helped the paramedics transfer him to the backboard. It was inconvenient at times, but John utterly refused to let go of his hand. Sherlock glanced between his brother and his blogger, not sure which one confused him more...
Rebecca accepted John's wallet in her free hand and wished them both a good evening before turning around and walking towards what appeared to be a back office.
Sherlock found himself stepping in front of the couple as the approached. The man glowered, his grip tightening on his partner and the woman cowered slightly. Sherlock put on his most approachable smile. "Excuse me, miss. I'm sorry to intrude but I remembered seeing you walking dogs past the building where I live. Do you do so professionally?"
John smiled and filled the gap between them to kiss his husband on the busy streets of London. "Happy Anniversary" he mumbled between the soft kisses, both making sure to not get arrested for public indecency.
"Aren't you going to put one on?" John asked Sherlock, who looked gave him a look of pure annoyance. Most people cower under his gaze, but this
The case they had currently been on had led them all over London, five murders all with their left arms missing. Sherlock had been on the case for weeks, but couldn't make any other connections. He had been in a miserable sulk for days until Lestrade called him to let him know there was another death.
"You need to wear one of these" Sherlock said while motioning to his (friend? colleague? homeless network?) partner to grad a blue suit.
He was leaning against the living room door of the flat belonging to the current murder victim. Sherlock was leaning over the body looking for clues, eyes searching for new deductions. Anderson and Donovan were the corners speaking to themselves while Lestrade made his way over to stand next to John.
"Last Monday? You mean when John got back from the conference. That's why you had a pre-set dinner at Angelos!
The enter demeanour of the man (no...Sherlock as John called him) changed and he had the smallest smile on his face while looking like John like he was the key to his case. Case?! OH!
John let out a hearty laugh at that, while Sherlock mumbles something under his breath that sounded something akin to ‘it’s for an experiment’.
“He also said something about harassing the yard?” John simply raised his eyebrow and Sherlock rolled his eyes.
"Sherlock, be nice." Sherlock rolled his eyes, and to the utter shock of everyone in the room, he leaned down to kiss him. It was a chase kiss, but the look of pride on Sherlock's face when he leaned away was enough to feel like you were intruding,
John snorted and pointed his finger teasingly at his husband. "Oh don't lie, we both know you had the reservations planned for weeks"
"Upstairs" Greg replied reluctantly. He was already breaking already rule letting him in here, what was one other psychopath.
Sarah realized she spoke allowed when both men turned towards her. Sherlock with his eyebrow raised and John with an amused yet confused look on his face.
Sherlock was walking with John close beside him, brushing shoulders with every step. The distance to the restaurant wasn't far, and since it was a lovely fall night Sherlock suggested they walk
"Well, I would" the yard stopped to look at him, but John continued "considering I married the man."
"Sherlock!" John looked scandalized but the two couldn't hold in their laughter if their life depended on it.
He had never seen either one of them dating, and yet they only ever seemed to just be mates. He could help but think how good those two idiots would be together, if only they could see it.
"Five years? Jesus that's a long as time." He noticed John was looking at him an amused expression that said he was laughing at a joke he wasn't in on but decided to push forward anyway.
John pulled away first and tugged Sherlock along by his left hand. "Come on you, reservations are for 7 and I have plans with a mad genius aftewards." John glances behind him to wiggle his brows at his husband. Sherlock chucked and let the warm burst of joy in his chest flow through his whole body. He followed behind John, he would always follow wherever this brave man guided him.
The two men ran from the crime scene, be before they got the street Sherlock took John's hand and spun him around so he could grab his head with both hands and give him a proper snog in front of the yard.
He didn't know much about Sherlock, no one did. He was an untouchable aura of power and wits, and he had seen his fair share of you'd constables try and flirt only to be ripped apart by his spot on sections. It's not that he didn't try because he always did, its that Sherlock kept up all his walls and never let anyone in enough to see the real him.
If Lestrade hasn’t known the git for years, he might have been afraid of the thunderous look Sherlock was currently giving him. It wasn’t until he heard a sound behind Sherlock that he realized there was another here.
“Hello, there” he walked up to Sherlock, and they shared a look that the inspector somehow feels like he was spying on.
John left Anderson to go and took a step back. He looked at John with fear in his eyes, the first time seeing this bloke was more then he appeared.
As soon as they left, Lestrade gave Anderson another warning for misconduct and gave the men their promised two days of freedom. Partly because he was now afraid to walk in on something he did not want to see. "Bloody married," he said to no one in particular. "How did I miss that?"
Sherlock stilled for a moment, but didn't turn his head to meet John's steady gaze. At length he said, "I don't have friends, John. Not only are they tedious, but in my line of work they are a liability."
Sherlock jerked away from him suddenly, straightening his shirt and tugging on his jacket and coat. "An elevated pulse is normal after an injury," he insisted tersely, not meeting John's eyes.
"A letter from one of my operatives in deep cover," Mycroft whispered, relaxing the slightest bit. "He's been away from friends and family for a long time. He's almost done with an impossible mission and...I'm worried he'll lose his focus if he doesn't have some tie to home."
"So," John began, breathing the smoky air deep into his lungs, it might be carcinogenic, but he was fairly certain his mad flat mate would take more years off of his life, given time, "What's new at the morgue?"
John nodded and waved, a gesture which Mary returned, and then he stepped through her door and began the solitary trek back to his motel room. He wanted to stay longer, but Mary was right. It wouldn't do to go from one undesirable situation to another. One step at a time.
Mr. Werner's eyes shifted to focus on Lestrade's face and he nodded. "Let make it quick, eh? I've got a busy schedule."
John strode to the kitchen to make himself a cup of tea before he could finish that thought. If he really wanted to build a friendship with this man, he was going to have to see him for who he was, not John's projected image of how he would like Sherlock to have been.
John carefully folded up the letter when he was finished an placed it in a waiting envelope. After a few mouse clicks he had printed the picture he had promised Alexander. John studied it for a moment before adding it to the envelope. Lestrade looked as unhappy as Sherlock had ever made him, and he was ringed with people in black shirts with the words "I believe in Sherlock Holmes" clearly emblazoned on them in white. The image still made John smile.
"It was past time," John assured her. "He has his work, and as fun as it was working with him, I do have my own career to think about."
Sherlock relented and held his injured arm out for John to examine. Slowly, John undid the cuffs, and moved the ruined fabric of Sherlock's shirt away from the gash. It was a long gash starting just above the elbow and sloping in a slight curve towards the wrist as it approached Sherlock's hand. It was a good four inches away from any of the veins in the wrist or inner forearm, for which John was grateful. Grasping Sherlock's wrist gently, John held it over the pot of water and lifted up one of the clean towels he'd set aside. "This might sting a bit," he warned.
The ugly truth? What did he- the realization his John like ice along his spine. Sherlock's earlier words echoed in his head.
He was sitting in a waiting room just adjacent to the ambulance bay and John could hear each new case as it was brought in. It made his adrenaline race, and he had to remind himself more than once not to jump up and start helping.
been a bit too long since he'd last eaten. It was good. John sat beside him, laughing reluctantly at the ongoing commentary.
"Oh, he's not as bad as he seems at first," Mrs. Hudson assured him, placing the watering can on the steps for a moment before straightening to rest a hand on John's arm. "He never lets anyone get that close to him. He must have seen something really special in you, to invite you to move in with him."
Mycroft turned back to his car and got inside. The Bentley pulled away from the curb, lost itself in the sea of London traffic, and was gone.
his favorite carol. Sherlock probably even knew what it meant to him, too. The song reminded John of safety and family, an image he treasured because he so rarely had it. Hearing that song as a child had made him think that everything really could be alright, if he tried hard enough. He had felt a rare sense of peace. It was never a story John liked to talk about, because of how personal it was...
John nodded his thanks. "As tempting as that offer has become, it would only make Sherlock more insufferable. He's already insinuating they we're a couple."
Nikki nodded slowly. "I thought you might say that. That's fine, but I have two tickets. Well, three really. I used my benefits to get one for myself, and I bought two more for you, in case you wanted to bring a date. Your tickets are in a different section, don't worry. I didn't want to intrude if you did come."
He almost jumped when Mary spoke again, her voice close to his ear. "You don't need to think about it that hard, John. I wasn't offering a massage with a happy ending."
John chuckled as he pressed a variety of kisses across Sherlock's torso. He'd never really pictured Sherlock masturbating. He'd fantasized about other things, yes, but not that. As amazing and brilliant as he was, Sherlock was, in fact, still human.
John looked at him like he always did with a brilliant deduction “yea, dinner sounds lovely. Angelo’s? He had set a table aside for today just in case.”
Sherlock looked back with a small smile and the faintest pink tinge to his cheeks. He looked away and rolled his eyes with fake exasperaton. "Yes well all your texts and reminders it was hard to forget".
Sherlock started walking away, John not far behind him. He yelled back at the inspector before he was gone “Lestrade, sent me updates on the case. I will be by tomorrow!”
"I called last week and Angelo told me it has already been taken care of." Sherlock joind in on the laugher, his deep rumple a contrast to Johns giggle.
He had known Sherlock for just over three years, and in that time he saw all different sides of him. When they met, it was the young genius sauntering onto the crime scene high as a kite solving the gruesome murder. He told him off and yelled at him to get help or he would be arrested for breaking and entering. A few months later he had gotten a text from some random number letting him know he was in rehab, getting help and letting him on the next time he came around. It started as a reluctant partnership, but Greg grew to enjoy helping the young man out, even if he pissed off half his team in the process.
Lestrade wondered what he meant by ‘where he slept.’ They must have been roommates back in the day, but isn’t John older? He didn’t have much time to think about it, as the tall genius was already in a cab to the murderer’s location and Lestrade barely had time to catch up in his police car to prevent any further deaths.
“Yup. The conference ended early, and your brother essentially ushered me out. Even sent a car to bring me here, I think it’s his form of acknowledgement.” Sherlock let out a huff of laughter
Try as he might, Greg never could figure them out. He thought it was about time he just asks the bloody genius, at least then he would know what he was working with.
Lestrade was making small talk about last weekend's football match, when he suddenly lowered his voice "Listen, mate, I don't mean to pry but have you seriously considered getting a date? might be good to get away for a while". John laughed at Lestreade's comments if only he knew. "No, I haven't really thought about that for a while, almost five years now." Lestrade gave John a look of utter disbelief.
The look they shared during the drugs bust was a clear sign they have known each other many years and can communicate without words. This is something they often did during crime scenes which resulted in the two of them giggled like children and running off together to chase after the bloody criminals causing more paperwork then Lestrade could ever imagine.
"What about Sherlock, I don't think I've ever seen him interested in another human before" John snorted at Lestrade's comment, but he didn't seem to be the only one who heard it.
That's why today of all days, he had no idea his a\entire perception on Sherlock was going to be turned. As he was standing inside the crime scene he heard the commotion outside that told him the consulting detective was finally in. He knew his appearance always stir anger in Donovan, but when the cases were unsolvable he is all they had.  when Sherlock finally entered the flat, what surprised him the most is that he was not alone.
"Yes I thought I was making that quite clear," John replied with a raised eyebrow. He turned away but just before he reached Sherlock he turned back to say "we will be going now. if you need the genius, don't bother for at least two days. You've had your time with him, now it's
“Hmm? Oh, we went to Uni together” John said while Sherlock snorted. John gave him an amused look, and turned back to Lestrade, “why do you ask?”
Lestrade simply shrugged his shoulders, “Its either that or you work with what we have here and be nice, or I call John and rat on you like a toddler to their parents. Your choice.”
Sherlock didn't look up from putting on his gloves, just replied with his blank tone "he is with me,"
He slanted a smile when he said no girlfriend, and the obvious lack of ring was a clear beacon sign for Sarah. Yea, he could be flake on shifts and sometimes came in looking worse than death, but John was some of the best company Sarah has had in a long time. He had never endlessly storied of his and his rediculous flatmate, something of a genius according to John. They did some sort of detective work, which might explain how he always had a small smile when he checked his phone. No doubt just a break in the case, it was the only logical explanation.
John asked one favour of him, and it was to keep him busy for the four days he would be gone, just keep him alive, please. Greg knew he was only half-joking with the statement, lord know Sherlock's chaotic energy is not as tamed without his doctor around. He had almost forgotten what it was like when John wasn’t around, but he knew he didn’t have much interest going back to it.
Anderson's jaw was still hanging from its hinges from the news, but once that passed he started hysterically laughing. "Married?! Hah! That's the best joke I've heard in a long time. You can't be married, how much did the fag pay you to say that?" he was wiping the tears from his eyes when John walked over and grabbed the front of his shit, pushing him against the wall. He stood to his full high, the army teaching him to feel much larger he looked. When he spoke, his voice was low and dangerous - the voice of an army captain.
"See John, I told you. without your ring people are idiots." John laughed at his husband, knowing it was his way of saying 'I told you so'. The discussion of the ring had been a big debate, mostly Sherlock upset John doesn't wear his band 24/7. John tried to explain it was more sanitary this way but Sherlock simply ran experiments to prove otherwise.
“Never mind,” Sherlock sighed.  He picked up the severed arm again.  “Is there someone else I might ask down there?”
The sorcerer looked surprisingly grave.  “if I could beat the Plague, if I could free society of it, I’d feel that my life had reached its summit, and be prepared to turn to some more placid line in life.  But never have I been so hard-pressed by an opponent.” The sorcerer’s expression grew dark.  “The root of this Plague eludes my best efforts.”
“Sorry,” said John.  “I didn’t realize— the others said the food appeared magically; I didn’t think I’d keep anyone waiting.”
brims.  The terrified royal would whisper that it was a sign of the sorcerer’s two-faced, changeling personality – some even guessed that the man had literally two faces, the better to watch them all with, or perhaps because of an experiment gone wrong.
Sherlock looked down at him, surprised.  “Oh, no,” he said.  “Don’t be like that, John.  I didn’t mean – you are
Sherlock frowned.  “She’s not a physician, John.  It would be an unreasonable comparison, albeit wholly lopsided in your favor, if one were to assess you based solely on your merits in that department.  Unless you meant-”
The next time Sherlock accidentally set part of his castle on fire, John was in the library.  Sherlock came rushing in, covered in soot, wisps of smoke curling from his clothes, flames licking at his heels.  “Run,” he yelled, and John hesitantly took a few steps, still in shock, before Sherlock grabbed him around the waist and half-carried him to the open window.  He jumped through, landed in a large hydrangea, and rolled to his feet quickly enough to arrest John’s flight.  It was a rather romantic catch, even if Sherlock did stumble and fall on his back under John’s weight.  Particularly after John shifted atop him, and Sherlock looked at him with a faint smile, eyes glazed.
Supper was laid out by the time they came upstairs, an elderly lady removing dishes one by one from the table.
They talked about the Plague again.  John quickly realized that the sorcerer was just as desperately eager to discuss it as he was to avoid the subject.
Within the next fifteen minutes, a young woman strolled through the gates, her jet-black hair piled elegantly on her head, a stark contrast with the rather poor quality of clothing she was wearing.  She looked around imperiously before walking through the doors without hesitation.
“No, it’s perfectly fine,” said John.  “A racket like that right outside my door at three in the morning couldn’t possibly have woken me.”
“King James had been kind enough to inform me that nothing short of healing those in the quarantined sector will convince him.”
The ugly-looking frog approached near to the spot where Sherlock was washing, spread its legs out on the top of the water, and, opening its mouth as if it wished to say something, stood perfectly still.
By the second month, John began to wonder why the sorcerer hadn’t taken him out to try and deduct people.
“Out of the way, Sherlock,” said John, directing two helpers, who were carrying a pallet with a man inside, so sick that he was
“Oh,” said the sorcerer.  “It’s you.”  He carefully lay down the whip.  “Mrs. Hudson must have been truly desperate to recruit you in her futile endeavor.”  But he followed John upstairs, so John supposed it wasn’t entirely futile.
John choked back a laugh.  “It’s not nice,” he admonished.  “Ordinary people are a bit unsettled by dismembered body parts.”
The sorcerer raised an eyebrow.  “It’s because I want to remind the monarchs of my tyrannical grip on what they hold dear,” he deadpanned.
John took the fingers.  “Is this why all the others saw body parts lying around everywhere?  Your experiments?”
“Instead of proving I’m still better than you,” Irene interrupted.  “Isn’t that what this is, Sherlock?  You’re afraid I’ll beat you again.  If we exchange notes, and I still reach a breakthrough before you –”
“Your nurses are indispensable to you.  It would be a shame for them to be arrested on some made-up charge…”  The Queen never looked away from her son’s helpless glare.  “On the other hand, I can ensure your office no longer struggles financially.”  She waved a hand.
It wasn’t that he was jealous, he told himself. He just wanted to watch the deductive process. He brought the matter up the next time he ran into the sorcerer.
A small tendril of trepidation snaked its way into John’s stomach, but not nearly as much as he should have felt.  Bloodstains aside, it was difficult to be afraid of the man when he looked so
The tall black double-doors opened by the same means as the gates:  Through a series of winches and gears that operated from the inside to push the doors open; the gates, connected through a set of underground levers, followed suit.
you been up to all these years?” Irene asked after Mrs. Hudson arrived with the tea, leaning backwards in her chair.
John took the fingers.  “Is this why all the others saw body parts lying around everywhere?  Your experiments?”
This did not please Sherlock at all, but Mike turned away before it could see Sherlock’s expression.
The food would appear more irregularly then.  Occasionally, the royal, wandering the castle, would find body parts, still dripping with blood, in places where they shattered the illusion of normalcy - thumbs on the windowsills of sitting rooms, livers in the stables, toes in the kitchen, and once, one horrified princess reported, a human heart in the unlit fireplace.   The music turned sour and discordant, sometimes sounding in the dead of night, or at the crack of dawn.
Normally, this was the part of the narrative where the prince or princess told their savior “Thank you” with a hint of “I love you”.
“Hang on,” John said.  Sherlock started, having completely forgotten John was in the room.  Irene turned to him interestedly.  John felt uncomfortably like prey under her gaze.  He cleared his throat.
“We haven’t spoken since you disinherited me for wanting to become a physician.”  His face twisted bitterly.  “Am I suddenly useful again?”
The next few weeks were pleasant.  John amused himself exploring the castle and strolling through the grounds, which seemed to be an equal mix of lovely gardens and terrifying swamps.  Some days, he’d find the sorcerer, or vice versa, and John would watch as the sorcerer performed his experiments.  Some nights, he’d hear unearthly music carrying through the halls, and be lulled to sleep.
“Oh,” said the sorcerer.  “This is… Harry, Michelle, and then the chart wouldn’t have shown your name after eight years ago, so something from earlier… Jack?”
What John had been thinking was something else entirely, something he’d been thinking for weeks by now.  This time, he didn’t hesitate to voice it.
illness; it doesn’t spread it.”  He narrowed his eyes at John in sudden suspicion.  “You do bathe, don’t you?”
"Brilliant," said John.  Sherlock ducked his head- whether out of genuine embarrassment or as part of the role he was playing, John wasn't sure.
“It was a bit of a joke when I first coined it,” the sorcerer explained.  “The Plague originated in my homeland, across the sea.  I was immune.  My biological parents passed away when I was fourteen, but not before sending me on a ship with a few others.  One of them-” he blinked, throat working.  “One of them brought it with her unknowingly.  She died.  The disease spread.  The man who took me in, Lord Holmes – he- he treated me as a son.  His other son Mycroft taught me how to make deductions.  We’d make a game out of it, figuring out who passerby were and where they were going.”  He paused again.  “I tried my hardest to save them.  I didn’t realize how strong it was.”
“Hypothetically, if it was intelligent, wouldn’t it be amiss to slaughter it without giving it a chance to defend itself?”
“Yes,” he said curtly, and hoisted Sherlock onto his shoulders, carrying him downstairs to where his horse was waiting.  Together with Mrs. Hudson, they secured Sherlock and rode as quickly as they dared back to his hospital.
Two servants stepped out from the curtained area behind a throne, carrying between them a large wooden chest.  They set it down carefully and made a big show of opening it.
“The Seaworthy Plague started from the royal families last time.  I suspected a food was the carrier, something the poor wouldn’t get to eat – venison, pork, a rare spice – or possibly wine or a sweetmeat, and then it would have spread to the servants…”  He pressed his fingers together, lost in thought.  “…maybe those who finished the leftovers got it, or the cooking staff who tasted it.  But then how would it have spread outside the walls of the castle?  Surely no one
“I’m attempting to rediscover a variant of it at the moment.  I don’t yet have a way of importing the ingredients, but perhaps there are substitutes endemic to this region.”  The sorcerer leaned forward, food forgotten.  “They’re in the form of a combination of herbs and roots that the patient chews for its juices – the rest of it is spat out, but-”
In the Year of the Purple Bear, the five neighboring kingdoms had finally exhausted their heirs.  All twelve of the princes and princesses who were past the age of adulthood had stayed with the sorcerer for at least one year apiece, and none were willing to ever set foot in that godforsaken castle again.  It was the turn of Queen Catherine XVII to send one of her children to the sorcerer, and she could not for the life of her persuade any of her children to return.
John shivered.  The quarantined sector was filled with those who’d been diagnosed as hopeless, doomed to death by Plague.  Incurable, allegedly.
The sorcerer paused for a moment, bow drooping by his side, staring in front of him intently.  John raised his hands and clapped, too slowly to be proper applause.
“Princess Diane’s pet cat.  It was the first casualty, remember, and she refused to be parted from it when it became sick.  Tried to nurse it back to health.  Then she came down with it and it spread from there.”  He finally sat down, pressing his fingers together.  “Bathing, staying away from pet cats – it’s surprisingly simple as a means of prevention, but getting the nobles to agree to it…”  He shook his head.  “I’ll need a more drastic method of proof.”
“Oh,” said the sorcerer.  “This is… Harry, Michael, and then the charts wouldn’t have shown your name after eight years ago, so something from earlier… Jack?”
“I’ll have to lay these fingers out to dry,” he said.  “Would you mind leaving them on an upstairs windowsill for me?”
“First off, we’re hardly children, and secondly, didn’t you say the Plague originated with a royal family?  That’s why you wanted princes, isn’t it?  To make sure we didn’t start another wave of the Plague?”
He looked like an ordinary man without the black collared cape, a bit tall and thin, perhaps; darker-skinned, a foreigner, but not a Moor.  His cheekbones were stark in the torchlight, his hair having the distinct shape of hair that has been flattened under a cap for too long.  The only unusual thing about him was his eyes – small, black, intelligent eyes, flickering over John in a way that made him feel small, as if under the scrutiny of a crowd of a thousand, like he was waiting to perform at his father’s tournaments again.  He straightened his back, for what it was worth, and planted his feet apart, meeting those analytical eyes squarely.
This, of course, did not seem to deter Sherlock from continuing to follow the frog.  But Sherlock was not nearly so rational as he would have liked to believe.  The game was afoot, and Sherlock could no more stop himself from chasing after it than a frog could prevent its tongue from flashing out and trapping a juicy bug.  Besides, he knew that if he turned back and went home, his curiosity would eat him alive.  A talking frog was a strange phenomenon that hadn’t appeared in any of the scientific texts he’d paid a thief to steal from the castle, and he couldn’t pass up a chance to understand more about it.
