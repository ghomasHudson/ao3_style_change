John sighed with a sleepy laugh.  “I don’t know if I can come again, but you may do whatever you damn well please with my arse.”
Sherlock smiled again and shouldered his bag.  “I’ll pick you up at the front door, in 10 minutes.”
John gets him up from the floor, manoeuvres him toward his bedroom.  Helps him out of his suit jacket, turns down the covers.  Sherlock flips off his shoes and climbs in, still fully dressed.
“Gone all night?”  John leans forward and clasps his hands together.   “Okay, out with it.”
Mr. Chapman’s wrinkled hand reached up to touch his throat.  “No.  July’s my month off.  Too hot.  But these are snazzy, aren’t they?”
John wiped his hands on his trousers, reached into the case, and held up a beautiful beaded dress.  She took it from him, held it up to her ageing body, and laughed.
(See the end of the chapter for
“History of asthma?” asked John.
“Shut up and enjoy this.”
“Show me the garden?” he asks.
John eyed the growing mountain of boxes.  He sure as hell wasn’t taking them anywhere.
John walked with Lestrade to the back of the garden.  Along the wall that separated the large walled area from the private --and locked-- garden, a mass of climbing roses clung to rickety-looking wooden supports attached to the wall.  There were hundreds of swollen flower buds on every branch.
Sherlock wiggled as he got comfortable.  “The bed’s wet,” he complained.
to do with the fact that Sherlock was a man.
“It wasn’t.”
Sherlock smiled.  “No.  John, they look perfect.”
-- and John nods back his assent --
“What?  Wait!”
Sherlock’s head appeared above a stack of grey plastic packing tubs.  “Hmm?  No.  Maybe.  Just leave it.”
With nothing better to do, John decided he would work on his new project: the locked garden.  He gathered a few tools from Lestrade’s garage and sneaked in behind his curtain of ivy.
I inhale and let my eyes drop close so I can better recreate our earlier situation before that man - I
“What was he like?” John ventured.
“Eidetic memory.”
As he followed Sherlock, who was walking with purpose, back to the room, he suffered a momentary crisis of performance anxiety.  He felt like a teenager, a young, inexperienced thing who was going to go off at the first touch.
Sherlock said nothing; John was forced to open his eyes.  He peeked blearily at the headline: “What Drives Him Wild In Bed.”  Good God.  He shut his eyes again and began to nod back off.
to, and as for Sherlock?  John feared rejection too much to just close that distance.  He was fairly sure, though, that one day, sooner rather than later, something would have to give.  Physicality was so
“Maybe it...fell out when he slipped?”
“Well,
It was currently 3am.  John shifted in the uncomfortable plastic chair.  He and Sherlock had been waiting in a maddeningly bland waiting room for their suspect to come out of surgery.  A stalwart nurse had told Sherlock that on no terms should he interfere with the process until Kerr was declared medically stable.  Both of their phones were dead, and Sherlock had given up on deducing as a means of entertainment; instead he was currently devouring the reading material left out for patients’ families: car magazines, dated copies of
“No.  I want you to keep an eye on him.  I will compensate you for your efforts, if required.”
“The tuba is a magnificent instrument.  It is the backbone of any orchestra and holds rhythm for brass ensembles.”
John knew what it was like to desperately want arse.  He rolled over, pillowing his head on his arms.  “It’s all yours.”
John rolls his eyes but smiles as he holds out his arms.  Sherlock gently places the instrument in his lap and John tries to arrange it as he’s seen his friend do so many times.  The metal is cold and the instrument is cumbersome, but John feels somehow privileged to be touching it.
John quieted and let Sherlock wrap himself around him, tucking his curly head into the crook of John’s neck.
“Let him wake up a bit first, yeah?  It’s still early.”  John tugged on jeans, a shirt, and a lightweight jumper and went about making the bed. He hated an unmade bed - a residual habit of military life.  After, slapping a silly decorative pillow back in its proper location, John turned around to find Sherlock stripping off his suit - again.  He smiled seductively as he undid the buttons of his shirt, causing John’s face to heat.  “Oh, no you don’t,” he said firmly, pushing Sherlock through the bathroom door.  “Shower.  Coffee.  Eat.  Case.”
Sherlock raises an eyebrow.  “Oh!  Hmm.  Well, that’s intriguing.”
“I’ve had worse,” said John, sincerely meaning it.
When I can breathe properly I replace my cock (still rather turgid) with my fingers and finish him off with my mouth; I swallow him down and leave him panting.
in love with someone.”
He flung open the door to the ‘Fountain of Youth’ to see...
Sherlock gave a half-hearted shrug.  “I don’t know.  I find that everything is different with you.  And I’ve deleted most of my prior experience.”
“Need a shower,” said Sherlock after a long stretch.  “I stink.”
“Why?  Why would he do that?  Take the buttonhole?”
“You don’t love me,” she continues.
take, would steal the moment and run with it all the way to the bedroom.
“Sherlock, stop.  Listen.  I’d like….”
“Not good?”
John eyed him dubiously as he rinsed his own bowl and cup and loaded them into the dishwasher.  “I’m not sure I believe you.”
“Please don’t tell me you’re making euphemisms about my arse.”
Owens gave John a strange look, as if he couldn’t quite believe he had to deal with not one but two men invading his private space, before he stood and went to open the front door.  John followed.
“Our hands are the same, you know.  You can tell I’m your sister, can’t you?  See the resemblance?  You feel it, too, can’t you?  The recognition of family?  We recognize our own family members so we won’t eat each other, you know.  Shame.  Mycroft would have made such a feast.  Show me your hand.  Hold it up.  There, now.”
a human being, after all.
“They do,” John affirmed.
To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is enough,
It was only later, as he was getting dressed to go out gardening, that he thought that maybe Mycroft knew John loved Sherlock long before he’d actually known for himself.  Maybe he’d been given the green light, the “go-ahead” from the older brother.  Or maybe the more likely scenario: it was just Mycroft being Mycroft.  John shook his head, trying to clear it.  Holmeses.  Mysterious creatures, the both of them.
, something that seemed thrillingly forbidden?  Had he really managed to capture the interest of the world’s only consulting detective?  It didn’t seem real. He took another slow breath to try to calm his racing heart.
“No.  Right here.”
“Have you solved a cold case?”
John snorted a laugh.  “You wouldn’t read that if you were paid to.  And that was undoubtedly
“Should I lock it back up?” John asked as they ducked beneath the ivy curtain.
“The first week I knew you I had four.  I re-discovered masturbation within the month.  I have fantasies about you that I’m dying to act out.  I am
She tips her head to the side, and John marvels at genetics: Mary had done that all the time.  “I guess that depends on whether you consider yourself married,” she says before sitting at the table across from him.
Sherlock smiled and went back to his experiment.
The fluorescent glow of single bulbs, the flutter of a white plastic tarpaulin above him.
He twists himself away from John to face the window of the cab so he can run his tongue over his teeth without scrutiny.  Yes, there, he can feel it.  His tongue isn’t enough, and he’s well above picking at his teeth in the back of a cab, so he will have to sit, defeated, for ten more minutes, stupid, stupid, thinking that John wanted to kiss him, wanted to put his mouth so close to one that was harboring the most hateful, offensive, tiny black microscopicly kidney-bean shaped seed known to man…
John lay there in bed, trying to fall asleep and failing spectacularly.  His mind was still awake, lingering on the different events of the past year that brought him to his current lot in life.  Now he was supposed to say goodbye to it, and it was proving harder than he’d anticipated.
It looked like any other robin, though John, but was strangely pleased that this particular one had taken a shining to his garden.
“Don’t be dull, John.  You’re coming with me.”
“Yes.  I imagine the effect is relatively short-lived for most.”
He had, however, made a list of names of the village's residents at the time of his father’s death.  Several names were crossed off (deceased) but none of them stood out as persons of interest.
It’s as if his body were made to turn mine on, to inflame me, entice me.  Even before we were lovers, though, John woke something up inside me, something long dead, repressed, locked behind iron doors.  He reminded me that I was deserving of love after all, of friendship, loyalty, trust and kindness.  Turns out my libido is amplified by emotional attachment.
“You like my hands,” smirked Fantasy Sherlock as John touched himself.
“Oh God, Sherlock.”
John gave his new lover an incredulous look.  “Toys?”
He’s sitting there, full and content, when his phone pings: It’s Rosie.  She wants permission to stay the night.
Navya was currently sitting - collapsing, really - in an antique upholstered chair that once lived in the library, and trying to come to terms with what had turned out to be an insane weekend.  She’d found herself in the middle of a mystery that concluded with a promotion she knew she could handle but was in no way anticipating.  She sipped the tea she’d made for herself and was mustering up the energy to go home when Joyce and Samantha -- two of the housekeepers -- burst through the doors with a rolling basket full of bed linen and a welter of complaints.
PLEASE don't leave spoilers in the comments.  Please!  Thanks!
The familiar zing of adrenaline erased all vestiges of sleep.
“About a year now.  Just a bit of extra cash.  I’ve been around animals most of my life,” she explained.  “I understand them, I guess.  Sometimes better than people”.  Molly chewed on her lower lip for a moment.  She really was charming in her own way, John thought.  Socially awkward, yes, but kind.  “Actually,” she said, finally deciding to share something more personal, “I’m going to study histopathology.”
Exhausted, John let his head fall back against the chair.  “Jesus,” he said.  “Sherlock, that was...that was...Jesus.”
In the back, Sherlock rolled his eyes and pouted, not that anyone was paying attention to him.
He could tell immediately that someone once used this space.  There were stone benches for sitting, and a child’s swing dangled from a tree branch.  Various garden implements were still strewn about: a rake, a rusted watering can, a spade with a broken handle.
He spent the night with his ears open, but heard nothing.  In the morning, shooting was the first thing he thought of, and he promised Mrs. Hudson that he’d bring back a nice brace of pheasants for the evening meal.  He found Toby in the stable, who perked right up at the sight of a man in hunting gear with a gun.  The dog happily left his master and trotted out to the pheasant run where the long grass eventually turned into the scrubby heather of the moor.  John walked along, the shotgun broken over his arm, taking in beauty of the countryside.  He was nearly ready to send Toby into the brush when a bevy of quail suddenly flew up around him, chirping at being disturbed.
John agreed, and on the way back to Lestrade’s garage, he swore he saw a curtain move, just a bit, in a certain upstairs window.
It was five in the evening by the time all was said and done, and John found himself wandering the city, hoping Thackray’s Medical Museum was still open, when he heard his name being called from behind him.
I once concluded that if humans had such things as souls, they would surely reside within the brain.  That is the site of all the action, anyway. The rest of the body slugs along, a meat puppet for the cerebral puppetmaster.  Matters of the heart?  Nonsense.  Yet is is the chest, the thoracic cavity, that home for the workhorse of the body, that aches when we experience grief, loss, depression.  The brain may be the ringleader but the heart is the stage: it houses the lion tamer (courage), the trapeze artists (trust), the clowns (mirth), the performing animals (loyalty), the bearded ladies (lust???).  John is no lady, but his beard, the thought of it scratching my thighs, my bum, the tickle of his whiskers against my perineum makes me...
John traced his fingers down over Sherlock’s shoulder and felt his back.  It was warm under his fingers.
It’s what Sherlock always said; it was the way their relationship would always be, and John was kidding himself if he thought Sherlock would ever put him first, even if they were ten years’ married.  He’d waited this long - what was a few more days?  And when the case was solved, John would make his move.
“Well, of course he did.  That cheap concoction you were using left a silicone coating all over your hair, making it dull and heavy.  My shampoo removed the residue.”
“Maybe.  But Mycroft is very, very thorough.”
John whistled and shook his head.  “£200.”
John did.
“Yeah.  Start together, finish together.”
“No.”
“What time is it?”
“You did so.”
“So you told him then.”
John licked his lips and attempted to keep his eyes open.  “Water?” he managed.
“No, it was my fault,” said John.  “I don’t know what I was thinking.”
John started with a full examination of the cupboards, which yielded nothing but
“That’s not why I’m here.”
Once she’d shown them the main room, they walked back to the reception area, past a room used as a beauty salon and another very busy area devoted to feet and hands.  Finally they reached a corridor flanked by potted rose bushes.  These were in bloom and smelled heavenly.  “Through here are our massage rooms and VIP areas,” explained Lillian.  “Each room is themed - not too overtly, of course - but we’ve tried to incorporate beauty and relaxation practices from all over the world, and thought it would be appropriate to reflect that philosophy into the decor.”
Sherlock looks around as if the room wasn’t a disaster, then brings the instrument back to his lips to play the last portion of the piece as quickly as he can.  He looks daggers at Mycroft all the while.
Jeanette kisses John on the cheek and begins to slice cake onto a serving tray.  Molly enters, overdressed.
“Come to bed with me,” Sherlock whispered.  “Touch me.  Please.”
The first touches were soft and measured, as if James were letting John get used to the sensation, but then he got down to business, stroking one foot and switching over to the next, pressing his thumbs in here, squeezing there.  Clearly James had done this hundreds of times and had it down to an art, a strange little dance between hands and feet.  It felt remarkably good, and for a moment John had completely forgotten Sherlock was even in the room with him until he heard the chair the detective was sitting in scrape away from James a bit closer to his side.  He could
The toe bone is connected to the foot bone, the foot bone is connected to the leg bone, the leg bone is connected to the hip bone...
The woman’s breathing had become desperately laboured.  John parted her mouth to see if somehow she had inhaled something that had clogged her windpipe.  Her tongue was completely swollen.
“Yes, thanks for the reminder.”
He ran around to an opening in the greenery just in time to see Sherlock tackle the man to the ground.  Donovan was right behind him.  “That’s about enough of that,” John heard her say as he jogged over.
“I’m not,” said John from further up the table.  “Sherlock probably has the damn thing memorised.”
“Sherlock,” he said, giving up on his unpacking and coming out to the sitting room.  “You’re hogging the chest of drawers.”
“I’m afraid my embouchure is weak,” he murmurs into John’s hair.
I have been assigned a simple duty: shower.
Sherlock closed it and turned to him.  “Yes,” he said.  “The author makes it sound incredibly complicated.  For some people it’s considerably less so.”
“No, not exactly.  But I might have been one,” John admits.
.  Observe.  It’s fascinating.  I should have chosen a unisex place, however.  There’s one a few blocks from Baker Street; maybe I could work something out.”
“Sorry, mate, was the sausage,” replied the DI, waving his hands a bit, which did nothing more than combine the odour with the heat and smell of exhaust.
between cases, a task much easier said than done.  Sherlock’s black moods were miserable and sometimes scary, and, as a doctor and good friend, John tried (to an extent) to help Sherlock through the crippling ennui.  Such an endeavour was not for the faint-hearted, and as often or not John just gave up, said “Fuck it”, and angrily stalked off to the pub while Sherlock destroyed the flat.  As time passed, though, Sherlock matured; Mycroft seemed much less concerned and “danger nights” became far and few between.
Sally shook her head.
“John, this is Angelo,” said Sherlock.
Sherlock’s eyes widened, having figured it out, and his mouth fell open.  John could see his pulse beating in his throat.  But he did it, and as John kneeled next to the bed, heaving Sherlock’s long legs over his shoulders, he began to tremble.
“What was your favourite ice cream flavour?  As a child?”  John asked at last.
On his way out, he stopped and knelt down in front of several overgrown rose bushes.  They were, as far as he could tell, the same ones that Lestrade had been complaining about earlier.  Sherlock’s roses.  They were in rough shape; dead, woody branches choked newer, greener canes.  Much of the deadwood, he thought, would have to be pruned away.  He touched the glossy leaves, ran a fingertip very carefully over a wicked-looking thorn.  “What do you need, hmm?” he asked aloud.
John huffed a dry laugh.  “No.  I don’t.  In fact I rather like you, although I’ll be damned if I know why.”
“Why’d you get married, then?  You looked happy in your wedding video.”
baking or cooking or anything of the like - probably just doing some experiments and to ring back should anything sound particularly like explosions or cursing - either of which meant Bad Things were going in in 221b.
John returned to the room, grabbed his computer, and brought it down to the library where he could think easier.  Staring at that gigantic bed would
Sherlock smoothed his expression, the line disappearing from between his brows.  “Yes.  But not now.”
“What can I say?”  John shrugged, treading water.  “I’m practically a porpoise.”
Mycroft took another sip of his tea and stared out the window for a while.  “When Sherlock was five,” he said finally, “he spent the entire summer pretending to be a pirate.  He turned a laundry basket into a boat.  Father bought him an Irish setter named Redbeard.  Mummy fashioned my brother an eyepatch, and he loved nothing better than plundering my bedroom and terrorising the gardeners.  It was his last carefree summer before he started school and the world was introduced to his particular brand of genius.  I still see him that way in my mind, sometimes.  All hair and skinny limbs, waving a wooden sword and telling the flowers to walk the plank.”
John ignored the intrusion of his privacy and ate the last few bites as quickly as he could.
“He’s not interested, trust me,” said John, doing his best not to look uncomfortable.  “He’s researching.  For cases, you know.  Uh, for forensic work.  Very important.”
It was enough to send him over the edge, and he pushed himself down into the cushion of the chair just to get enough leverage to thrust a handful of times, and then he, too, came, the powerful orgasm washing over him.  He heard himself grunting, a raw, animalistic sound, and he barely registered holding onto Sherlock to stop him from  toppling right off his lap and out of the chair.
(See the end of the chapter for
The third morning, John had a bit of a lie-in and by time he woke up, Sherlock was gone again.  His flatmate’s strange hours never bothered John much; it was part of the arrangement.  John found the kitchen usable and Sherlock’s equipment back to being confined to the kitchen table.  Impressive.  Maybe Sherlock was trying to make up for his transgressions of personal space.  He went to the bathroom to shower.
“Yeah.”
“Yes, I know,” replied Mr. Campbell.  “It’s the clover.”
Sherlock flinched a bit and squirmed, sighing softly, before relaxing again.  John realised that, even though his heart was in his throat, his hands were steady, and he went to work, softly stroking at first, before massaging in earnest, squeezing and pulling and kneading.  Underneath him, Sherlock made little whimpering sounds.
Sherlock looked momentarily uncomfortable.  “Nothing important.  I was simply disagreeing.  The author suggests...  Here, see for yourself.”
“You don’t have an unruly mop.  A mop, yes, but you’re quite good at ruling it.”
John pushed back in response.  “Do it, love.”
“Indeed,” said John, teasing.
He was gloriously naked.
He held himself still; John could feel Sherlock’s heartbeat through his back, felt the hot fullness of his lover deep inside..  Sherlock’s curly head was tucked into the space between John’s shoulder and jaw.
Sherlock was obviously well into it, too, for he didn’t instantly react; it was only when John pointedly cleared his throat that Sherlock’s eyes flew open and he released his hold on whatever he was pushing his dick into and scrambled up on the couch a bit, startled.  The offending thing was still there, perched on his crotch like a Palace Guard’s bearskin.  John squinted and spluttered and finally realised what it was: the unwanted muff, turned inside out.
John smiles to himself  “Yeah.  You do.”
“Well,” said John.  “I don’t have any pressing engagements.  We’re both relaxed.  I haven’t anything planned that one could describe as grand, and I imagine our ensuing awkward and stilted conversation might be less awkward and stilted if we could possibly relocate to the sofa, where I could more easily kiss you.”
He forces himself to keep the conversation going.  “Well?”
Sherlock trembled above him, breath heaving.   God, the sounds he made.
A miniscule shake of the head.  No.
However, that didn’t mean it was underused.  The spa colleagues  -- largely female -- congregated there during breaks, and had to pass through the space to reach the utility room which housed washing machines, dryers, and the massive linen closet where spare bedding lived.  And everyone had to help with the laundry: it was an enormous job.  Leybourne had insisted that a commercial housekeeping service would be too costly, so he’d invested in three industrial-sized washers and dryers that were in constant use from morning till night.  At the end of every shift, at least eight pairs of hands attacked mountains of clean tablecloths, napkins, sheets from the spa, pillowcases, sheets, and duvet covers.
“Fourteen and a half minutes.”
John was nearly out of the corridor leading to the VIP rooms when he heard it - faint, rhythmic splashing.  He made his way cautiously into the swimming pool area, eyes scanning quickly.  Someone was in the pool, swimming lengths.
He wouldn’t realize until much later that he’d left his walking stick.
“You were in the garden that day, weren’t you, Mr. Owens?” said Sherlock, abandoning his examination of the bookshelves and beginning to circle Owens.  John stood at the ready, feeling the tension in the room thicken.  He honestly had no clue what either man would do.  Owens was looking like a cornered animal and Sherlock had a look of manic loathing not unlike the one he had when John first met him, sweating and shaking through the discomforts of withdrawal.  He couldn’t imagine what Sherlock must be feeling, face-to-face with the man who killed his father.
“I think you’ll do quite nicely,” said Mr. Holmes, looking genuinely pleased.  He turned back to his paperwork.
“Will I fit in there, too?” he asked.
John beckoned with his hand.  “Let me see.”
“You again?” said Sherlock, who hadn’t moved.
“I shall treasure every sexual encounter we ever have.”
Clearly, Sherlock wasn’t coming out of the bathroom any time soon, so John logged on to Barts’ medical databases and searched for acupuncture complications, finding very few conclusive cases in the UK but a few instances of death by pneumothorax or secondary infection in patients who had been treated abroad.  He wanted to try the needles on himself but thought better of it.
“You order breakfast.  Not hungry.”
“Good.”
“Ridiculous...”
“You said you played when you were thinking!”
“Not broken!  I’m depressed.  I’ve got PTSD.  Fucking hell, Harry, I’m scared to shoot.  I can’t do surgery, I can’t go more than two nights without a nightmare, and I have a fucking piece of metal holding my shoulder together!”
John looked around, checked a small clock above the sink and saw that only 10 minutes had elapsed.  Where was Sherlock?  Still in the house?
By the time he made it back in, Sherlock had opened the parcel -- a thick envelope -- and was leafing through its contents.
“Telogen, John.  There are between 100,000 and 350,000 hair follicles on the human scalp alone.  A person loses between 50 to 100 hairs a day as certain follicles go into their resting cycle.  You know that already.  We live together and neither of us is particularly fond of hoovering, so collecting your body hair was insipidly easy.”
“Oh, Sherlock…”
As it turns out, Sherlock miscalculated how much his absence would affect John.  He returns to 221B with a bloody nose and split lip.  What had he expected?  John to have leapt up in joy, bid a quick goodbye to his date, and followed Sherlock on to adventure?  Sherlock had realised the enormity of his mistake the first moment he laid eyes on John again, John with his unflattering moustache, nervous eyes, and shaking hands.
“Jesus.  You probably hoovered up thousands of pounds’ worth of coke.  For free!  You probably winked or fluttered your damn eyelashes and that was that.”
“You can’t be serious.  You’ll wake Mrs. Hudson!”
John did his best to keep his body pliant as Sherlock fondled him.  It was more like Sherlock was exploring, memorising how John’s skin felt while submerged, whether or not his flesh would respond to touch differently while wet.  Long, warm fingers plucked at his nipples, smoothed down and over his ribs, worked down between his legs, tested the weight of his bollocks, the firmness of his prick before sliding down his thighs and back up.  He was gentle and slow, and, true to his word, didn’t seem intent on bringing John or himself to orgasm.  Nonetheless, it wasn’t long before John found his breathing speed up, a familiar ache building in the floor of his pelvis.
“Shit.  He would be, wouldn’t he?  I had a girlfriend once whose dream was to stay there.”  He cut himself off before he said, “for our honeymoon.”  John had considered marrying her, but he wasn’t ready and she wanted children immediately...it would have never worked, and he let the poor girl go.  Within a year she was happily married with a baby on the way.  It was for the best, really.  Funny he should remember her obsession with the resort destination.
“Oh!  That.  I was trying a new technique.  It’s meant to replicate the techniques indigenous Australians use to play the didgeridoo.  It’s very difficult.  It takes a lot of lung power.  But it’s oddly calming.”
Some two weeks after he’d been staying with Harry, Sarah Sawyer, from Harehills Surgery, phoned.  A short phone conversation proved promising, and John decided to spend the next few days in Leeds to attend an interview and acquaint himself with the city.
John did the maths.  At £850 a pop, the woman had dropped £5100.  He could tell exactly what Sherlock was thinking - she couldn’t afford it.  Even if she were loaded, it would be a hefty expenditure.
Sherlock considered before shaking his head.  “Not in the mood.”  He breathed out loudly through his mouth.  “There’s nothing to
“No, not at all!  Anything for a Holmes.  I’ve got a client in an hour, but I have some time before that.  Let me just finish up some loose ends and I’ll be right back.”  She gave them another beautiful smile and left.  John was mesmerised by her blonde ponytail as it swished back and forth between her shoulder blades.
“That’s the thing,” said John.  “It’s not just a patch of land, and you know it.  I should have respected that more.  I didn’t realise...I should have asked.”  John sipped his wine, then held up his glass.  “Still friends?”
In which Sherlock makes an error, gives a gift, and damages the transport.
Hands it would remain, then, and John smiled down at his lover, who was beginning to lift his hips clean off the bed.  Seeing Sherlock like this was so incredibly special - Sherlock, whose brain never seemed to stop, whose body was always so full of nervous energy, was now reined in, so beautifully human.  Yet at the same time, John felt that he held something truly remarkable in his hands, something more than human, something divine and just for him.  He had never loved anyone this way, or so much.  He would spend the rest of his life showing Sherlock just how much he loved him, with his words, his lips, his tongue, his fingers.  There would be so much time for exploring, for breaking out those toys (good God), for quick and dirty sex under the sweep of the Belstaff, a blowjob in an alleyway, groping in a cab.  But now, John just wanted to Sherlock to understand, really, truly understand, just how treasured and loved he was.  He’d always considered his hands tools of his trade; healer’s hands, those that fixed broken things.  Sherlock Holmes was far from broken, but he could still benefit from a healing touch, one that would soothe his manic highs and deliver him from his depressive lows, touch that would help ground him on a human plane, one in which the physical manifestation of their love for each other could exist, boundless.
“Horses...”
In which John gains his bearings and begins to feel like himself again.  But is he alone at Holmes Hall?
Mycroft actually frowned, moved his cup around with his hand.  “I’m afraid I might have proved a role model in that regard.  I have always found solace in my own autonomy.”
“I have always put you first,” says John, his voice rising.  He hasn’t brought another woman in to replace her mother, hasn’t chased after whatever he and Sherlock have.
Mrs. Hudson checked her watch.  “And tell him he’d better come out of there and open up that room unless he wants to carry all of this up himself.  They’re leaving in an hour.”
Sherlock held out his hand for the tea.  Someone was just as pretentious as his brother.  “Not particularly.  I like roses.  I enjoy being in gardens.  Very good places to think.  I am also fascinated by bees.  It was my father’s passion, so naturally I picked up on a bit of it.  Interesting chemistry involved.  Decay is much more interesting than growth, to be honest.”
His shoulder ached and he felt more worthless than ever.  Back in his room, he took out his anger on the resistance band (evil blue bastard!), and when he still felt like shit afterward, decided to take advantage of the pool.
London really was lovely in the spring, thought John, as he walked to work, smiling at nothing in particular.  He looked like a honeymooner, and for all intents and purposes, he supposed he was.  He doubted he and Sherlock would ever exchange rings, but they had each other’s hearts, and the knowledge that Sherlock loved him, wanted him, heart, mind, and body, was more than enough.  Who knew?  His marvelous and absolutely infuriating best friend turned out to be an attentive and sensitive lover.  For the first time in his life, John felt
He was midway through relieving himself when he realized that Sherlock had arranged all of the new products from yesterday’s ill-fated visit to the salon in descending order by height on the shelf that hung above the toilet.  The last bottle was the brown one, and it didn’t take a genius to see that it had been opened, the paper seal broken with a thumbnail.
John inspected her handiwork and deemed it a job well done.  “Molly,” he asked, “How about a beer?”
“Lillian’s.”
Mrs. Hudson spent the entire breakfast trying to puzzle out why John was so chipper all of a sudden, and John assured her that he was just pleased because he had never had such exceptionally tasty bubble and squeak before.
John sniffed.
“Why not?”
“Yeah right.  You had two glasses.  I’ve seen you knock back a few glasses of whisky without the ensuing innuendo.  Are you sure you’re OK?”
____________________________________________
“No, it’s not you at all,” John said, feeling extremely thankful that the knot in his robe was strategically placed because he had one hell of an erection.  “That really was very relaxing.  And instructive.  Thanks.  You’re going to be a wonderful physiotherapist.  I just wasn’t...expecting a foot massage to feel so, uh... good,” he managed to get out.
John steered her toward a chair at the table and took over, flinging a kitchen towel over his shoulder and rolling up his shirtsleeves.  He flipped the eggs and poked at the sausages a bit before beginning to clean up the mess.
a date: Sherlock even ate and had two glasses of Valpolicella with dinner.  He had talked incessantly about the soloist throughout dinner, but when Sherlock entered the Barbican Concert Hall, he’d gone quiet and didn’t say a word as they found their seats.  He looked perfectly at home among the crowd of well-dressed concert-goers, and he didn’t, for once, seem perturbed by the fact that they were literally surrounded by ordinary people.  The conductor of the London Philharmonic entered to applause, followed by the violinist.  She looked young; John looked at the programme.  He was unfamiliar with the composer or the piece.  Had Sherlock ever played it before?  John thought to ask him later.
“I think if I put this under the rose bushes, they’ll figure it out.  They’re supposed to love to eat aphids. In the meantime, this should help.”  She brought out a spray bottle from her bag.  “It’s a bit of oil, washing up liquid, and bicarbonate of soda with water.  My mum always used it.  It tastes bad to them, so they stop their nibbling.  You really don’t want to use a commercial pesticide if you don’t have to.”
John took a pebble himself and tossed it, too.  They were a long way up.  “What happened?”
“When did you...”
Eventually Sherlock moved, slowly walking along the perimeter path before stopping.
Sherlock’s eyes flitted to the slides on the table and back to John.  He actually looked mildly guilty..  “So, collecting your epithelial cells is out?”
walked in, you twat.  You were busy long before I got involved.”
No, that was a person.  It was very faint, somewhere in the massive house, but John’s ears recognized a person in pain.  What the bloody fuck was going on?  Was
“Would you like to see them?”
If the walls of 221B had eyes, they would have averted them now.  They looked like something out of the Kama Sutra:  a human crab with a very unusual hat.
“That’s what all addicts say, Sherlock.”
“Do you want me to touch you?”
“I’m trying to tell you that...I’m lying on something.”
...John’s hand stilled, closed around hot flesh.  The breath he hadn’t realised he was holding came out in a rush.
“I’ll go through your wardrobe.”
Thanks to Bettyswallocks for the lightning-quick beta.
“So what is it that…?”  John couldn’t quite manage ‘drives you wild in bed.’
Hopefully more than once.”
For some reason, John’s not sleepy anymore.  He goes back to the sofa.  Shucks his jacket, plumps the pillow under his head, and lies down.  Something about seeing Sherlock
Chapter 18: In Bloom
As John made his way to the restaurant, set in the mansion’s ornate banqueting suite, John sadly realised that he
She nodded.
) couldn’t keep up this pace for long, but for now he was going to enjoy every second of this.  “Fuck, that feels amazing.”
“Hmm?”
“Everywhere.”  Molly’s small voice drew both men up from their study.  “He’s hairless everywhere,” she emphasised, pursed her lips together, raised her eyebrows, and nodded at the poor man’s backside.  Sherlock, unfazed, stepped forward and proceeded to spread the man’s cheeks.  Completely.  Bare.  John’s eyebrows nearly touched his hairline.
“Jesus.”  John stood up and stretched.  “What’s going to happen to him?”
John, unwilling to be a whole house and floor away from Sherlock, camped out in the upstairs library, listening to the strains of Sherlock’s violin as he played on and on.  Needing something to do, John first typed up the entire case, although he never intended to publish it.  Then, on a whim, rang Harry.  They talked for a long time, John feeling the odd and sudden need to tell her everything.  When he finally told her he was moving in with Sherlock and that their relationship was now decidedly more than friends, she didn’t seem surprised.
God, he was so bored.
“Fucking hell!”  Sherlock shouted and batted John away.  John had never heard him curse so fluently.   It was kind of a turn on.  Well, it would have been, had it been elicited under different circumstances.
Molly looked sombre, turning over the packet to read the instructions printed on the back.  “I think it’s just the thing,” she said.  “It’s a little late in the season, but they’ll still grow.  Have you planted seeds before?”
Weird.  Really weird.  But not boring. Something was better than nothing.
And here are the ruins:
“What were you doing when you…” she mimed cutting her finger.
“Ow!” said a baritone voice.  “Ow!  Get off!”
John giggled.  Ridiculous.  This whole thing was just ridiculous.  Sherlock chuckled along side him and nuzzled at his neck.  “God.  I just - you’re mad.  Sherlock Holmes: reluctant masturbator and owner of sex toys.  You’re a study of contradictions.”
“Mycroft’s childhood dream.  Olympic Grand Prix Dressage.  My brother is quite at home with a giant beast between his legs.”
“Yes, but nothing incredibly interesting. I haven’t been able to check it, either.  Mycroft took my mobile.”  He frowned petulantly.
“Bloody hell.  Wait - did I see them?”  Her voice took on a devious tone.  “Were they fit?”
“Not that I knew about.  Then again, I was rather busy.”
“It’ll feel fabulous.”
“What about it?”
John shifts in his sleep.  His hand, at least, realises its location and gives me a bit of a grope.  I tilt my hips into it, press my cock into his palm.
“Raging size queen?  What?  Did you get that from a magazine?  Jesus Christ, Sherlock, turn around and
John’s hand shook as he made his way to the back of the pub, his feet carrying him steadily onward although he knew he had no reason to interfere with Sherlock’s private life.  It just seemed off.  And God help him, if Sherlock were exchanging sex for drugs, John would bloody well throttle both of them right there on the spot.
“You’re in an orchestra?”
Sherlock swallows again.  He can’t help it.
First he walked away from the house to the north-west, where a stream marked the western boundary of the property.  Several acres of pheasant run bordered the south of the property; John stood next to the tall, dead grass and watched the withered stalks blow in the breeze.  HIs grandfather had been an avid pheasant and upland game hunter.  As a child, John had visited his grandparents rarely, but he remembered the smell of his grandfather’s pipe and his thick Scottish brogue.  Grandma would cook the rich, dark meat with onions and potatoes, turnips and carrots until everything was tender and delicious.  Harry hated it and complained loudly about animal rights.  John would suck every piece off the bones, loudly, just to see her squirm.  Sometimes his grandfather would even let young John accompany him on a shoot, to handle the dog or carry the bag of birds once the men had shot their limit.  There were no pheasants in the deserts of Afghanistan.  There were spiders as big as his fist, and scorpions that could cause necrosis within hours.  He still longed for his pack and pistol, but if he never saw another camel spider again, he would be eternally grateful.
John figured he wasn’t doing much good sitting around waiting for Sherlock to come to an epiphany, so he took the list and cycled into town to have tea with Mr. Chapman.
“Do you like that?” John whispered.
“You need to leave and take him with you, now!”
John knew when he’d been dismissed.  He’d nearly reached the door when Sherlock spoke again.
“Worried that you’ll let this slip sometime in the wrong company.  It’s just a bit kinky.  Sex with inanimate objects, Sherlock.”
“Horse ballet?” Lestrade leaned forward.
Mr. Campbell made an affirmative noise at that.  “You couldn’t keep a secret from him if you tried.”
Then, a full two minutes later,
John swallows.  No.  Not now.  Not after all of this.  His heart can’t take it.  He forces himself to look up.  He steels himself for a confession of love.  What is he going to tell his wife if he...?
“The glass dildo is inanimate,” he speculated, swiping the muff back up along the side of John’s arm.
Blur.
people.”  He said it as if it were the great embarrassment of his life.  “
“Oh!” exclaimed Sherlock suddenly, eyes wide and shining.  “Yellow!”
AGain, thanks to all the lovely readers who leave me the most awesome comments.  YOu guys are awesome.  My work schedule clears after next week.  Chapter 13 is in the process of being written, but it's long and complex so it may be up to 2 weeks before I can get that one out.  I like to be 2-4 chapters ahead, and right now I'm only 1, so I'll have to play some catch up!  Thanks again for all the lovely encouragement and notes.
Behind the house were the gardens, several acres worth of manicured beds, evergreens tamed into spheres and spirals.  It was very formal and proper and worlds away from John’s secret garden, the one he’d slowly but surely reclaimed from the clutches of time.  He felt no sense of communion with these plots of green and brown.  They were too perfect, too rigid, too controlled by the human hand, hoe, and spade.  A huge fountain stood in the middle of the formal garden’s quadrangle.  It featured a larger-than-life-sized copper statue of Theseus, in all his nude glory.  Sherlock waggled his eyebrows as they passed and John giggled.  He was suddenly possessed with the idea of throwing a colour bomb at its genitals.
“It’s not a criticism.  Your lips are perfectly suited for your face.”
“Have I?”
“I don’t remember.  It was before I was born.  I was the baby, remember.  They didn’t talk much to their annoying younger sister.  I remember they said he was very good, had a lovely voice.”
“Hairless guy,” he said, “you mentioned gambling?”
What?  “I’m not his date,” John said, looking up.  Did he
“Well,” said Greg, “I’d best be heading back to London.  Got everything I need while you two were, er, having a lie-in, and I think the team’s about done inside for today.  We’ll run tests on  the samples and see exactly what we’ve got.”
Sherlock puts his lips together and blows a raspberry.  HIs lips flubber around comically and John nearly dies laughing.
“No.  I did, however, get the impression that the conversation made him uncomfortable.”
to work in that garden.  I don’t believe in fate, or destiny, or any of that, don’t get me wrong.  But...it just felt right.  Still does.  And I have a hard time apologising for something that feels that way.”
He left for the surgery an hour and a half early to catch up on some loose ends he’d left the day before, told Sarah about the case, and asked if he could leave a few hours before his usual time.  She was interested but rightfully curious whether John’s newfound hobby would impact his working hours.  John promised he’d sit down with her soon to discuss the future of his employment.
“Why’d she do that?  Send them after she died?  Seems...weird.”
“It’s John Watson.  I’ve got something for you.”
“Oh.  Are they now?”
“600 thread count...”
Indeed, John Watson knew the human body, both male and female forms of it, intimately, which is why, when he met Sherlock-it’s-all-transport-Holmes, he didn’t buy it.  For someone who claimed not to care about his body, Sherlock spent far too much time on his appearance (three types of hair products?), and when he did eat, he indulged.  He never wore vests under those tailored silk shirts, and even his casualwear was designer.  John wondered if the bespoke suits were Sherlock’s way of keeping himself clean, to remind himself to look the part.  Whatever his flatmate’s motivation was behind the tailored clothes, Sherlock remained a study in contradictions.
“There are easier and more accurate ways of recognising romantic interest.”

to the center of his chest.  Sometimes they just had quick and dirty sex - the kind that was impromptu and perhaps done mostly clothed and sometimes even during cases, if Sherlock could turn his brain off for a bit and divert the blood flow from one head to, well, another.  Those were fun, improvised romps that usually left John feeling pleased with himself and Sherlock wired with newfound energy.  But when they were like this, together, at night, in the relative safety of their own bedroom, with no pressing cases, Sherlock found himself willingly giving into feelings he once considered foolish, pointless, and stupid.  Now, as he watched John’s face, Sherlock’s heart unfolded, uncoiled, and stretched itself against his consciousness, singing as it blossomed.
“Anything else I should avoid?”
“Have you ever been in a relationship before?”
“Navya Kapur,” Sherlock repeated, sighing in annoyance.  “She works on the reception desk.  Highly underutilised.  If I were you, I would promote her on the spot.”
John shrugged his shoulders.  In the distance, the sounds of the colour cannons continued.  “I don’t pity you,” he said, and meant it.  John’s own family issues were complex.  And he definitely didn’t want pity from anyone either.  But Sherlock had only been 13.  Surely he couldn’t have been expected, exceptional mind or not, to solve his own father’s murder?
I was seven when I ate my first oyster.  Mycroft had done something of significance, but I can’t be bothered to remember what it was.  What I do remember is that I was pulled away from an afternoon of collecting lichens (I had recently discovered symbiosis) and I was expected to sit in a stiffly pressed suit and

John didn’t know whether to be alarmed or flattered.

“Would you have given me permission?”
“How long have you...felt this way?  About me.  Uh, us.”
Redbeard slept on my bed from the time I could remember.  He grew older, his doggy breath became more pronounced; his flatulence could clear a room.  That didn’t stop me from rubbing my head next to his, nuzzling his ears.  Rubbing their softness against my cheek.  He became incontinent.  He wet my bed; I’d clean it and not tell Mummy.  His eyes grew rheumy.  Mycroft complained bitterly about the stench.  Underneath it all, however, his smell remained, one of warm fur and dander.
“Do you know what kind of shoes he wore?”
“I’m not your date.”
“Nothing.”
John eyed the copy of
“You, um, haven’t seen Sherlock?” he asked her as she signed off the computer and collected her handbag.
Mr. Campbell ran his hand over his bald head.  “Sally Donovan.  Sally.  Black girl?  Woman now, I suppose.  Nice looking?”
“And you’re...how does one say...on the pull?”
“Thanks.  Where’s your other guest?”
...nothing.
Sherlock unfolded himself from the chair and stood before walking around and kissing John on his upturned forehead.  He attempted to walk to the bathroom, but wobbled on his second step, prompting John to abandon his post-coital bonelessness and quickly come to his lover’s side.  “You OK there?”
That had been a very bad idea.

“You really enjoy it, don’t you, you kinky bastard.  Kissing me.
“When, exactly, did she have trouble breathing?” John asked Barbara’s fellow teachers, who had begun to relax now that Barbara no longer seemed on the verge of expiration.
Chapter 20:  Unearthing the Past
Sherlock’s eyes remained closed, so John deposited the proffered mug on the nightstand and crawled back into bed.
“Of course, John,”  Sherlock sighed, frowning.  Perhaps he didn’t want to play this game after all, but John was going to take what he could get.
He made it back to his room, but it took him a long time to fall asleep.
“And here I was, ready to wax my genitals.”
They sat there like that, grinning stupidly at one another, before Sherlock removed his hand from John’s chest, placing it on the side of his face.  “You need to shave,” he said lightheartedly as John leaned into the touch.
“The question is, was the victim so thoroughly divested of his hair before or after his death?”
Sherlock moved, flipped himself over, and lay flat on the bed, his penis lying flushed and heavy against his stomach.  “Still in my shaving kit.”
" he cried, as if taken by surprise, and then he did, semen missing his hand and flying across his chest.  John could feel it from the
“No.  Boring.”  Moriarty checks his hair in the mirror once more before turning back to the room.  He lifts an apple from the decorative bowl and takes a bite out of it.  He makes a show of chewing and swallowing before he continues.  “No, Sherlock.  The final problem.  You and me.  I owe you a fall.”
And when he was confused, angry, or otherwise emotional, John did what he usually did: he went for a walk.
Sherlock does know: John stares.
“You can’t just
“So do you,” John replied, mirroring the gesture.  “Stubble was...new.  I really didn’t think you got any.”
“In fact,” Sherlock continued, “she’s likely to be on duty now.  You should go and talk to her.”  His voice suggested he leave immediately, and the poor man looked to Mycroft for guidance.
Mrs. Hudson served a hearty, aromatic beef stew.  They sat together at her cosy kitchen table, and he ate well as she sat nattering on about living in Florida for several years with a husband who was up to no good.  He tuned most of it out, nodding at the proper times. The sun had set and the rain had gone from a drizzle to a steady downpour; tired and full, he found himself ready to turn in.  Thanking Mrs. Hudson again, he helped her clear the table (“I’ll load them just this time,” she’d said as she rinsed and placed the dishes in the dishwasher -- “not
John was, if anything, a very patient man.
“You’re...relieved?”  Sherlock finally said.
***If you would like to read an explicit version of this scene, see the addendum at the end of the work.
“I’m all right.  I need to think.”
“Thank all that is holy you didn’t touch your eyebrows.”
I swallowed it like a dirty secret.
His pace was faltering, hips growing erratic, but John kept at it, sliding his finger tip in and out with every thrust, shallowly fucking Sherlock as he could with his cock or tongue, all while delighting in the heavy body atop his, the hard prick rubbing against his own within the circle of Sherlock’s large hands.  If only he had a mirror, could see the sweat of Sherlock’s lower back, the clench of his bum, the cheeks parted around his hand, John’s own finger dipped in to the first knuckle...
John admits.
“Very good,” says John.  “What’s it called?”
“So that’s what slowed you down,” he said, wiggling his pelvis against Sherlock.
“Yeah.”  John looks pointedly at Nina.  Rosie chooses great friends, if he’s honest about it.  Rosie’s decision-making, however, leaves much to be desired.  “I remember last time.”
...throb.
it, just a little bit.  Just to let him know that his own son may not be there, but I still was, I was there to help, and I thought he’d just wobble a bit, and I could hold it still, or catch him if he actually stumbled, and he’d say ‘thank you, Adam,’ like he always did when I handed him his paper, like he did when…”  he trailed off and put his head in his hands.
“About, uh, what drives you wild in bed.”
“No, that’s fine,” sighed Owens, resigning himself to the fact he would have to deal with another person’s company for a while.  “Come on in.”
Their landlady had a truly appalling amount of clutter.  Every item, even those she wanted thrown out, seemed to have a story that she simply must tell.  As he listened, however, John realised Mrs. Hudson wasn’t simply finding a way to live a simpler life.  Sherlock’s powers of deduction must be somehow rubbing off on him because it suddenly made sense.  Mrs. Hudson was feeling her age, feeling the need to cast off some of her unnecessary weight, like a hot air balloon struggling to keep afloat.
Sherlock was still squatting on the floor next to her chair.  He stood up, brushed at his suit a bit, and then nodded to John to step outside, where they sat on a stone bench in the garden.
John gave him a perplexed look.
John groaned theatrically, but something about
Without his new friend around to occupy him, John spent his free time tinkering with his blog, which had suddenly gained a small following.  He wrote up ‘A Colourful Case’ and created a link to Sherlock’s website, hoping to generate a few clients for him.
“Just be careful.”
“I’m fine,” he replied, attempting a smile.  “Great.” His attention went back to the bar.
It was late when John climbed into bed and opened a book he’d been wanting to read. He fell asleep before he was fifteen minutes into it and dreamed the vague, ephemeral dreams of the exhausted.
“That’s the point.”
Taking the key card from his pocket, he waved it in front of the little electronic box, heard the mechanism engage, and let himself in, shutting the door quietly behind him.
“I’m having a bath,” he announced, pointing a finger in Sherlock’s direction, “and you’d better hope to God we have porridge oats left and that you haven’t used the last of the Benedryl.”
John narrows his eyes.  “My birthday was last week.  Had a cracking good time hiding in that blasted hedge, remember?”
“Come in with me!” he called.
John raised his eyebrows.  “Pornography?”
“...I know that,” Sherlock interrupted.
...and I thought I’d plug it in and see if it still worked.”
“Good men are hard to find, Doctor Watson.”
“Toby, really.  Found them in the courtyard, actually.  By the statute of the bloke with the pipes.  Keep your voice down.  I’m not sure how well sound carries.”
Sherlock, now exposed with his penis looking properly ashamed of its earlier enthusiasm, reached for the blanket and shrugged it over his lap.  “Well, are you going to just sit there and laugh at me?”  His smirk had faded into a pout.
John had to stretch, reach his arms down to palm Sherlock’s buttocks, spread them apart, expose the cleft, slick and moist with the sweat of his exertion, to the cool air of the flat.
“It seems a shame,” said John, “that the blooms only last for so long.  It’d be nice to be able to keep them, you know?  Hang them up and dry them, or press them somehow?”
While had been in just his dressing gown in front of Sherlock before, there was something awkward about the closeness of the room.  “No,” he replied.  “It’s a foot massage, Sherlock.  Above-ankle nudity is not necessary.”
One particular thrust caught John off guard; something had changed in the angle, and he moaned without restraint.  It must have set something off in Sherlock, who groaned himself and increased his pace.
The photo is dark, but John doesn’t need to see.  He closes his eyes and he sees what no one else is allowed to: all those secret little hairs?  They’re
John laughed a bit, nuzzled Sherlock’s neck.  “I have to admit I’m… intrigued.”
“Um, Sherlock?” he asked, carrying the container in and depositing it on a free spot on Sherlock’s new worktop.  “Please tell me there aren’t human parts in this.”
, she didn’t add.
Mycroft nodded at his brother, who nodded back, then went to collect his umbrella and coat.  “I’ll send a car in half an hour.  Your help is appreciated.”
“Mmm?” he mumbled, running his hands over his face.  “Sorry.  Fell asleep up here.  You OK?”
“No.”  Sherlock’s eyes danced.  John could see the excitement in his face, even if the room was lit only by a small lamp at the far side of the room.  “How would you like to do a bit of exploring?”
John found his torch and cane from where he had dropped them, then shone the light around the room until the beam passed over a lamp on a table near an unmade bed.  Keeping his body turned to the man on the ground, he limped over to the lamp and switched it on.  The man flipped himself over and his arm flew up to cover his face from the light, but slowly he lowered it and glared up at John with a mixture of hatred and intrigue.
John raised Sherlock’s large, fine-boned hand and kissed his knuckles.
“What do you say?”
Sherlock’s long legs served him well in the chase, and although John probably could have made it to his bedroom first, Sherlock flicked the hallway lights off as he passed by them, causing John to lose a few moments to surprise and utter darkness.
John’s smiling.  He’s got that smug little pressed-lipped smile he uses when he’s particularly pleased with himself.
and yes, anyone with half a brain could do the same,” said Sherlock.
Sherlock looked at him smugly as he spooned two sugars into his cup.  “Don’t really think I
Sam whinnied.  “He wants his stall back,” she said as if she were interpreting.  “Be patient!” she said to the horse.  “You make such a mess, you big brute.”
“I’m sorry,” said John, “that I…”
“What did you find in her office?”
Sherlock made a noncommittal sound that meant that he might eat if John presented it in front of him.
It seemed as if everyone at Holmes Hall had a similar idea.  Molly Hooper’s grandmother passed away and she resumed her studies at Barts.  As for Lestrade, he found a position with the Met, where he’d be working alongside the newly transferred Sally Donovan in the Homicide and Serious Crime division, based at New Scotland Yard.
After three hours, they’d exhausted the stores of things she no longer needed, and four large boxes were moved to the hallway, taped and ready for dropping off at the nearest Oxfam shop, along with the one that held the assortment of strange miscellany that Mrs. Hudson said John could take.  He was helping himself to some shortbread from the tin she kept in the kitchen when she came in with a scruffy brown suitcase.
number of romantic dalliances in your university years.  Read medicine at Barts, graduating with first class honours.  Passed your commissioning course at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst with flying colours.  Two tours of duty in Afghanistan.  Recently dismissed from military service due to extensive injuries on the battlefield.”  He stopped and looked up.  “Thank you for your service.”
“We were just finishing off.  Please come in.”  John stepped through the doorway and followed Mr. Chapman as he shuffled his way into the living room, where another elderly gentleman, distinguished-looking and completely bald, was sitting at a card table.  “I beat him every week,” said Mr. Chapman.  “But I think he lets me win.”
John took a look around at the barbarity of early modern medicine and decided Sherlock had a very limited view of progress.
Silence.
Sherlock wove the bike expertly through clogged traffic, and a short half hour later they were pulling up to what appeared to be a massive country house estate.  Instead of being overrun by tourists, however, the place was swarming with runners.
He can’t say why he leaves it.
“Oh God.”  John gave Sherlock’s wild hair one last ruffle before sitting up, rolling his shoulders and cataloguing his sore parts.  “Be right back.”
Mycroft’s face was completely impassive.  “You must have been mistaken.  There was only me.”
“So you don’t want to know how long it will be until you’re completely grey?”
Sherlock tells him.
“It’s pointless just to lie here.”
“The what?”
.”  Sherlock huffed and turned his back on John, taking most of the blanket with him and presenting most of his arse to the room.
John continued to stare down, awestruck.
“Where, exactly, are we going?” he ventured.
John helped Sherlock stack a bookshelf on the far side of the room.  He really did have quite the collection: several medical texts, 20 or so chemistry books, a great many volumes of crime-related journals.  Some of the titles were very old, their covers threadbare and pages brittle.  Others were festooned with sticky notes, passages of text underlined, splashed with lime-green highlighter ink, or simply slashed through with angry lines and marked ‘wrong!’. John left the boxes of chemistry equipment and personal effects for Sherlock to sort out.  Slowly but surely, the room transformed into a livable and comfortable space.
“You’ve done this before, then.”
“Sorry,” muttered Greg, and looked elsewhere.  “It’s just that...your hair.  Looks different.”
.  He stares out at Walworth Road: it’s the usual mix of chicken shops, bookies, and convenience stores. Nothing exciting. How did he end up here?  Sixty-one years old, widowed, flawed father, blogger, best friend to the world’s only consulting detective.  It’s not a bad life, certainly, but it feels...like he’s been on pause for far too long.
A tap at the door.
But Mycroft and Sherlock were insistent that selling Holmes Hall was the right thing to do, and besides, John couldn’t see himself being happy living there permanently.  He and Sherlock would fit best in the bustle of London.
“I’ve already asked.  He knows no more than I do.  It was an old wooden folding ladder.”
,” he laughed.
“Fine.  Mycroft’s here.  Owens went to the police last night.  Gave himself up.”
________________________________________________________
“Does he have any idea about what might be going on at the spa?”
“Mine are very sensitive,” said Sherlock at length, lifting himself up a bit on his elbows and giving John a chance to breathe.
“Is it so different?” Sherlock asked, moving his right hand up so he could undo John’s trousers.  “With a man?”
Sherlock shook his head in the negative.  He crossed over to the desk on which he was keeping his papers and ran his fingers over the cover of Maggie Donovan’s
When he returned home, he made his way to the east wing, slipped past the tarp, and pulled the tapestry from its hangers.  He dragged it over to the side so it was clear of the door.
John thought
“Two people came in that helicopter.  And you’re making a mountain of eggy bread. More than three people could eat.”
Soon he heard murmuring down the hallway and then the sound of a door closing.
John smiled.  “Yes, together, love.”
“It’s a small community,” John said from the doorway.  “Someone has to know something.”
“I think,” said John, his frustration finally dissipating, “that there are too many unknown variables.  You said the ladder didn’t break and was still standing.  So either your father managed not to knock it on the way down, or someone was holding it still while he fell.  The fact that he hit his head and died is circumstantial.”
“This person is very important to you.”
Sherlock chalks the case up as a rousing success.  It was a whirlwind of a case, not particularly difficult but there was a time element involved, and he always finds a certain joy in solving a puzzle under pressure.
And with that, he took off, and John abandoned his concerns about intimacy and grabbed Sherlock around the waist for dear life.  By the time they reached the main road, John was pressed flush against Sherlock’s back, the cool wind making the sleeves of his jacket flap wildly.  The sound of the engine concealed his laughter.  It was fucking glorious.
John looked at her very carefully.  Had she gone off the deep end?
“There.”  Sherlock smiled.  It was dark and a little sinister.  “Close them now.”  He tapped John’s knee gently.
“Ah, yes.  Sergeant Sally Donovan.  Pleasure to see you again.  Oh.  Oh, I see.  Aiming high, aren’t you, PC. Anderson?”
There was Sherlock, leaning up against the bar suggestively, speaking quietly with that dick of a barman.  It wasn’t a Sherlock John had ever seen, either.  No, Sherlock had transformed.  His entire posture had relaxed.  He had a curl to his lip John hadn’t seen before, and he kept running his hands through his hair, touching his own arms, thighs.  John’s gut roiled when he realised what was obviously happening: Sherlock was…
“Right,” he said, and made his escape.
“He could be if you’d let him be!”
The logs shift in the fire.  It, too, has burned hot and needs replenishing.  It’s late, but John isn’t ready to call it a night yet.  He rises and tends it, poking at the charred remains. For as long as he and Sherlock have been sitting in front of them, John has always been the one who tends the fire.  He likes the heat of the flames, the smell of it, the way the flames are in constant motion.  He likes the shifting glow of hot embers.  He doesn’t even mind clearing out the grate.  This is an old fireplace, he thinks.  There’s been a person tending it for four centuries.  It needs a new hearthkeeper.  He stands, brushes his hands on his trousers, and looks at Sherlock.
He continues, “I didn’t know it then.  But I know it now.  I think I’ve known for a long time...  I just wasn’t ready to admit it.  But I am now.  I’m sorry it took me so long.”
Yes, he was very keen to get to London, to move into the flat with Sherlock, but saying goodbye to the people he’d grown to know and appreciate in Burnett Thwaite had been more difficult than he had thought it would be, and he hadn’t counted on feeling so sentimental about leaving the hall itself.  Sometimes it seemed just like yesterday he had lugged his duffle up the steps, cane in hand, a man with no friends, a man with very little fight left in him.
“What?”
“Sam Crosby.  I’m sure their statements are in here somewhere…”
“I found it distasteful.  Her hands on my skin.  Repulsive, actually.  Vile.”
Mrs. Hudson stayed away, so they cleaned up together (Sherlock did more talking than actually loading the dishwasher).
“Sit down, Sherlock.”
John felt for Sherlock’s hand and held it.  “Yeah, I know.  And I love you too.”
“Why exactly am I here?  What do you want from me?  I am not a drugs counsellor or a glorified babysitter.”
“I heard Mr. Holmes used to read to children at the library.”
Eventually, Sherlock nodded.
,” Sherlock breathed.  “God, John.”
I love him the way I know to love, with my mind.  But there’s more there, and there always has been.  Eventually, even the hardest metals meet a boiling point (Tungsten, 5660 °C) and I have melted.
John’s nose
himself, situating himself back down on the bed a bit, spreading his bent knees and drawing them up, and John saw
Somewhere along the line, though, John’s body decided to board the train to Crazy Town and the glowing embers of his platonic love for the detective turned into a fairly sizeable fire.  It wasn’t some raging inferno - not yet - and it happened so subtly that John couldn’t pinpoint when became sexually attracted to Sherlock.  He’d always known the man was good looking, and his confidence and fastidious personal grooming gave him a mysterious allure, but what he was experiencing was beyond simple appreciation of an attractive body.
He tipped the book so John could see.
But there was no garden at Baker Street, so Sherlock contacted the botanists at Regent’s Park, who were pleased to add his rose variety to their collection.  That is, if they could manage to successfully uproot the bush.
John summoned all of his Watson charm and approached the reception desk.
Sherlock gingerly lifted himself from John’s lap, John shuddering a bit as his penis slipped free from Sherlock’s arse and fell wetly against his thigh.  He let his head fall back again.
“Can I touch you here?”
Our lips meet, again and again.  Kissing was always easy between us, from the very first time we closed the gap between our faces.  I rub my nose over his, cradle his cheeks with my hands, lick into his mouth and let him lick into mine.  Sometimes he sucks at my tongue, other times he nibbles at my lower lip.  The taste of his saliva, morning breath and all, is incredibly provocative to me.  We both have stubble this morning; his grows faster than mine does.  I like the contrast of the smoothness of his lips.  I’m half on him now, our hips moving together as I kiss him again and again until we are both panting.  When I need air, I kiss his beloved temple, his earlobe, his eyelids, the tip of his nose, until he slots our mouths together again.  I have to admit that I never truly found this aspect of lovemaking all that worthwhile until John.  My former lovers were perfunctory kissers at best.  One tried to eat my face, I’m quite sure (rather unpleasant).  John has taught me a thing or two about how to do it properly, how to do this slick and intimate dance.
“I never actually saw him.  But that would be unlikely.”  Sherlock’s eyes sparkled.  “No, the person I’m thinking of would have visited regularly, on a daily basis.”  He raced back across the room to retrieve the envelope the documents arrived in and then bounded back.  He waved it in John’s face and tapped the stamps.  “The postman, John!”
John chuckled again and then flopped back on the table.  If this weekend got any stranger...
.  I’ve fantasised about that moment for years now.”
Again, infinite thanks to Betty Swallocks, who keeps me entertained and doesn't laugh too hard at my poor attempts to sound British.  I had to draw the line at the use of "health farm," however, which American audiences just wouldn't get.  Health farm.  LOLS.
“Warning me about what?” she shouts.  “That you’re going to turn into a mean, grumpy old arsehole if I don’t shut up?  ‘Cause guess what?  You already are one!”  The thin thread holding them together snaps.  She grabs her backpack and slings it over her shoulder.  “I’m going out.  Nice chatting with you, Dad.”
“Did I offend him or something?  Touching your feet?”
Both of them giggled, remembering the way Lestrade’s eyebrows had shot up with his lip curled in disbelief when he’d entered the garden.
anything about it…”
“By all means,” said Leybourne, sitting down to join them and smiling broadly, revealing a mouthful of slightly discoloured teeth.  “I simply had to meet Holmes minor.  Mycroft’s full of splendid tales.”
“He says he doesn’t,” Sherlock said bitterly.  “But how could he not?  He came from Cambridge right away.  I told him my concerns, that our father wouldn’t have fallen, and then I cursed mother for moving him so I could have seen exactly how he fell.  Mother was so distraught she didn’t want to hear any of it, enraged that I would carry on my ‘stupid obsession with crime’ to our own father’s demise.  Privately, Mycroft begged me to solve it.   He knew I could.  I I thought for days, sat through my father’s funeral in a trance, trying to think, trying to make sense of it, and every time coming up blank, roadblocks everywhere.  Logic, clouded by my own sense of loss, guilt.  I couldn’t solve it, John.  The death was ruled an accident.  Mycroft cut down the plum tree with an axe and locked the garden and I haven’t been near it since.  And there it is.  The dirty Holmes family secret.”
“Nope.  None whatsoever.  Hey - do you know why Molly calls him ‘Mr. Considerate Lover?’  Thought that was a bit out of order.  I mean, the poor girl’s a bit socially awkward, but that’s a bizarre nickname to give to a corpse.”
“There is no literature that shows a correlation between cognitive function and SSRIs.  Lethargy, perhaps, but we could tinker with dosages and…”
“Sure thing,” she said as John made his escape.
John blamed the ache in his chest on the upcoming emotional move and tried to push it down.
He reached into his pocket and pulled out a packet of forget-me-not seeds.  He handed them to Molly.
is on at 7pm, too, so get your stuff together.  You’re getting out of this shithole and coming home with me.”
... and then I looked and the CCTV was, the CCTV was showing…”
“Stop that,” said Sherlock.
John was vaguely aware of Sherlock making muted scathing noises from where he had retreated into the corner.  Small talk was distasteful to Sherlock, but John had expected him to ask a million questions.  Instead he clammed up and looked entirely uncomfortable.  He’d shaken James’ hand and introduced himself, at least, but at the moment he was sounding more like a pervert and less like pleasant company.
“And if the body were not the soul, what were the soul?”
This was it, the moment neither of them had wanted to deal with, the moment that had presented itself so many times before, that they had ignored.  He guessed it was kind of hard to ignore these things if you were wet and naked and high on the possibility of getting caught.
“Shut up.”
“What on earth did you do to yourself?”  John leaned against the door frame and pictured all sorts of disasters: skin lesions, chemical burns, glass splinters - for all he knew,  Sherlock had got himself beaten up.  Rarely did Sherlock complain of pain; he could probably simply will it away like he did with hunger and fatigue.
like that gets him thinking.
“Yes.”
“Very well.  You may do the caring for me.  Be my moral compass, if you will.”
“Yes.  And it’s beautiful.  I’d like you to see it. With me.  Um.  Together.”
“Come, John,” called Sherlock, sounding more enthusiastic than he had in days.  “The game is on!”
John had been encouraging Sherlock to
“You’re very cautious,” Sherlock replied.  “I can tell that much.  You’re very good with slight of hand.  A magician.”
Another petal.
the barman.
“Quit trying.  Just do it.”
“Oh really?” queried Sherlock, turning to John.  John shrugged.
He reached the courtyard between the two massive wings of the manor house and sat on a bench next to the old fountain.  The structure was starting to crumble; it would need a stonemason soon. Toby sniffed around the courtyard as John sat and relaxed, but then soon became occupied with something.  John didn’t give it much thought until he saw the dog start to paw at the ground.
“Wow,” said Molly, taking in the locked garden.  “Just...wow.  How on earth did you find the keys?”
John gesticulated wildly.  “I
John took a seat, grabbed a magazine he had no intention of reading, and waited.  Soon, he heard it - the tiny ping of an incoming message - and waited for Melissa to turn to her computer.  The reception area was mostly empty at this point, except for a few customers who were browsing through beauty products or waiting for the salon.  After a few minutes watching Melissa’s face, John stood up and made for the office corridor as if he belonged there.
“No.  If this is your way of coming on to me, it’s all wrong.”  He’d meant it as a joke, but it came out flat and awkward.  “Look, I know exactly what you’re doing.  You are
“You’ve got…”
“Is he…?” asked Sherlock, reaching into his pocket for his mobile.
“I’m terribly sorry about Ms. Gleason and your son,” he said as John pulled up a chair for himself.
put that on my skin.”
It was only later that night, as he rubbed his feet together under the duvet that John wished Sherlock would be the braver of them, the one who
“Bor-ing,” sang Sherlock.
John had flatly refused to accompany Sherlock to the reception desk to do whatever it was he was planning on doing.  He was acutely aware that he was standing in one of the trendiest salons in Soho and fairly terrified that the evening was going to end up with one of them smelling of mint and verbena.  So he stood stoically by the door next to a wall of windows and glass shelving housing brightly colored toiletries.
“Don’t empty it out!” Sherlock instructed.
“I occupy a minor position in the British Government,” he said, as if that explained everything.
The stretch has done nothing but heighten my arousal, my heart speeding up, pumping more blood to my groin.  John notices my change of position and seeks contact again.  He does this now, sometimes, his body seeking the comfort of mine even in slumber.  I enjoy his warmth, his solid presence.  Now, the hard line of his penis against my thigh.  He sighs, but sleeps on.
“Nope.  I think that’s it.  I’m good.”
Sherlock turned over and let John spoon up behind him.  John kissed his back and pushed his wet genitals up against Sherlock’s still-warm backside as he slid his arm over Sherlock’s belly.  They clasped hands; Sherlock drew up John’s knuckles to be kissed before quickly shoving them back under the duvet.
“Mr. Holmes said you might need a hand with the spring gardening,” said John as he looked over what was clearly Lestrade’s corner of the building, complete with lawnmowers, bags of mulch, and various gardening tools hanging from hooks on the wall.
“Yes, more or less,” replied John.  “I think what Sherlock’s trying to say,” he said to Holmes the elder, "is, um, thank you.  For, yeah.  The lovely weekend.”
But John’s familiarity with nudity went beyond the simple and easy naked camaraderie of brothers-in-arms; the fact he was a doctor meant that he had seen and studied the human body in all its fleshy frailty.
“And whoever wore them walked frequently in them and probably followed the same daily routine.  They were used for work, not for fashion,” added Sherlock.
John smiled.  “My hands are a bit full here.  Help me out, then come and have a shower, yeah?”
Sherlock glared at John for a moment before shouldering a very large, heavy carrier containing all manner of bottles - £ 175 worth, to be exact.
John's CV in the show isn't exactly accurate.  I did the best research I could from metas and NHS and RAMC websites.  It's not that important to the story.
.”  He paused and looked at John before beginning again.  “
“Well, as I have said,” says Sherlock, “it’s for you, too.  And Ros, of course.”
Sherlock put his shirt back on, long fingers deftly buttoning it closed.  “Yes.”
He picked up the shovel and together they slipped into their garden.  It seemed even more otherworldly by night, the shadows darker, the fragrances more pungent.  A world-between-worlds.
Eventually, John heard the shower shut off, water from the tap running, and then the sound of a hairdryer (
they sometimes shared, the ones where nothing was said where something wanted to be said.  John was sure either both of them would burst out giggling, as they sometimes did in these situations, or whether Sherlock would dismiss himself and flee the scene.
Greg thought about that.  “It rather is, though,” he said at length.  “It’s his house, his garden.  His brother.  His father, too.”
“It hurts, it hurts,” he wailed.  Watson did what he did best: in the thick of it, bullets literally whizzing past his head, he set to work, the whole emergency medical procedure meticulously outlined in his mind.  Part of him remained aware of his surroundings, half-listening to the shouts and directives of his team, while most of him focussed on getting Smith to stop bleeding.  He’d already used four of the ten CAT-tourniquets he’d brought with him.
The first contact of his erection against the smooth skin of Sherlock’s abdomen was nearly too much to bear.  John deepened the kiss, meeting Sherlock’s tongue, hot and wet.  He heard himself groan, a needy, plaintive sound.  Sherlock pulled back a bit, gazed at John with hooded eyes, whispered, “More,” and eagerly went about getting what he wanted.
.  John barely had a chance to think about how that might actually work (backwards?) before Sherlock descended upon him, capturing his mouth in a wet and insistent kiss.
Sherlock smirked and drew a single, slightly worse-for-wear Marlboro Light from his breast pocket.
John froze, steam coming off his body in the cool air.
“I could care less.”
“Mycroft would be so jealous,” Sherlock said softly.  “He would like to have seen this again.”  Sherlock picked up a pebble next to him and tossed it down.  It bounced on the stones below before rolling into a clump of grass that would never meet the blades of a mower.
In the back, Sherlock rolled his eyes again, not that anyone was paying attention to him.
“I wasn’t wearing the standard issue underpants at the time.”
“Your friend John.  He’s a remarkable flirt.”  Eurus chews on her thumbnail for a moment.  “Play his.”
Hurry up, John.
Sherlock came back and looked up.  “Is it a planet or something?”
“Research.  Working on a grant.  Really exciting things going on with oncology lately.  Doing a bit of teaching, as well.  Think Bart’s just wanted to get rid of me for awhile.”  He laughed.  “Hey, have you had dinner?  I’m starving and Margaret’s at book club tonight.”
Sherlock blinks twice before it clicks into place.
“I can tell by your expression that you’re thinking I’m here to chastise you for either your renovation of the garden or your relationship with my brother.  Quite the opposite, actually.  I wanted to give you my thanks and offer you congratulations.”
“So,” he started, wondering where to begin a conversation, “does your ‘employer’ have a name?”
John, enjoying this new bit of information, sat back in his chair and crossed his arms.
“We think,” said John, speaking for the first time, “that maybe there was someone who wanted Mr. Holmes out of the way, or maybe was frightened of what he might know.  Is there anyone you can think of who disliked him or had reason to wish him harm?”
John’s heart began to pound.  Sherlock continued, his voice picking up speed.
“Well, don’t think too hard about it.  You ought to go visit Mr. Chapman some time.  I think he’d like to see you.”
“Don’t lock me out,” John whispered, hearing his own voice break.
“Shhh.  Yes, I know.  Just stay still for a moment.  Be still.”
“Very recent.  Yesterday, maybe, the day before that.  Why would he remove his hair, John?”
Sally nodded.
John regarded what was left of his ivy curtain.  “I clipped the tendrils from the brick, you idiot.  Slipped in behind it.”
“You...like gardening, then?”
“Still.”
“So what’s going on at Willow Cross that’s got you so interested?  Embezzlement?  Blackmail?”  He lowered his voice dramatically.  “Murder most foul?”
Thanks to the usual suspects, BettySwallocks and Canolacrush.   And thanks to everyone who has left awesome comments and encouragements.
Thanks so much to all of you, readers.  I appreciate every comment, kudos, and reblog.  This is the most stressful time of year for me.  Simply putting this idea on paper and putting out into the world helps tremendously.  So thank you for reading.
“And the groundskeepers?  Were they in the house at all, or only outside?”
thought John.
It left him gasping, trembling and weak, body utterly spent and heart overflowing with a deep and profound love for the man on his lap.  Maybe it was the novel position or the fact he was already feeling overly sentimental, but whatever the cause, he felt so deeply grateful, so amazed that of all the people on the planet, Sherlock chose to share not only his friendship but also his body and heart with him.  Sex only seemed to amplify the emotion, his orgasm not just a physical release of hormones and semen, but an outpouring of all those complex and nebulous emotions he usually kept carefully in check.  It was a relief, really, to finally be able to let go, to love freely, and to be loved in return.
“Naming inanimate objects seems like a waste of time,” Sherlock replies before stepping back to check John’s posture.  John notices he doesn’t actually answer the question.  “No, that’s not right.  Spread your legs, it goes in between.”  John almost blushes, but he does as instructed.  It’s still not right.  “Here.”  He moves closer.  “May I…?”  He nods at John’s arms --
“You don’t happen to know if he was flat-footed, do you?”
When he got out, Sherlock had thankfully abandoned his project and now sat in his chair, laptop balanced on his knees.
Then again, it’s important to know whether or not your wife is an assassin.
Well, that was a disaster.  John mentally kicked himself for even trying.  He was an invalid now, a little man with a little cane whose entire wardrobe fit in a standard-issue rucksack.  He spent the rest of the ride staring out the window.  He’d never been to this part of Yorkshire.  It really was beautiful country, with rolling, heather-covered hills and rocky outcroppings.  Occasionally they’d pass a rambling brook, and once they went over an ancient-looking stone bridge.  John wondered if there was trout in the stream.  Maybe he’d learn to fish, if things worked out all right.
John took a seat across from him.  “I need a gun.”
without his gear and weapon.  If he had one still, he’d have packed that, too.  A water bottle, a basic first aid kit, and a packet of M&Ms would have to do.
“I know nothing,” Navya laughed.
“Oh no, you don’t.  You’ve been thinking yourself into circles the entire day.  It’s time you think of something else.  Let’s do something, get some fresh air.”
Eurus steps forward.  “How long did you miss him, I wonder?  Years?”
“What’s her name?”
Again, thanks to all the people who help me write and give me inspiration.  This fic is better for the Britpicking services of Ms. Bettyswallocks, the massive amount of sheer plot genius from Canola Crush, and cheerleading from Fleetwood Mouse and Bittergreens.
“Romancing Lestrade?  You’re a fickle man, Sherlock Holmes.”
“How horribly pedestrian,” he moaned.
that made Holmes Hall so dear to him.  If John was struggling to say goodbye, surely Sherlock would be worse off.  It was, after all, his childhood summer home, the place where he’d caught frogs and bred roses.
Whispers from the kitchen can only mean one thing: Rosie is plotting.  John has eavesdropped on enough of her conversations to know when she’s up to something -- or trying to hide something.  She’s given up on the latter, mostly.  There’s not much one can get past her father when Sherlock Holmes is in the picture.
Mrs. Hudson questioned John’s judgement and cautioned him about bringing young ladies around when Sherlock was prone to have experiments on the worktop.  John assured her there would be no young ladies, and he and Sherlock both smiled at each other in such a way that Mrs. Hudson’s eyes went wide.  She clapped her hands and immediately opened a bottle of Bollinger and then drank half of it herself, nattering on about selling the house, the secret garden, and the joys of true love.  Sherlock sipped his champagne and looked at John in a way that made him feel hot all over and thankful that the tablecloth covered his lap.
When the kiss ended, John was sure there were tears in those mercurial eyes.  Amazing.  For so long John thought his flatmate incapable of any empathy or altruism at all.  Now he knew otherwise.  Sherlock
Sherlock is lounging on the sofa, still smoking.  There’s a near-empty packet of Silk Cut on the table near him, and the Queen’s own crystal ashtray is housing a city of dog ends.
In which John is brilliant, Sherlock makes a confession, and someone has been meddling, but it's all good.
“Oh, please.  It’s just a house.”
“So why do you wear the suits?”
“Can’t you deduce it?”
“Hmmm?”
The hum of machines, noise, green plastic smocks, three surgeons.
Sherlock Holmes?  The detective?”
If Mrs. Sandhurst thought that they should have, she refrained from saying so.
John watched him closely, amazed that Sherlock chose to share this deeply intimate story with him.
“Yeah.  But more than that.  He sees things.  Probably knows all about you from the style of glasses you chose and the tie you’re wearing.  It’s uncanny.”
John crossed Mr. Amos off the list.  “What about a Mrs. Sandhurst?”
“A case like this,” Mycroft is saying, his face twisting into a moue of disgust, “requires...legwork.”
“I think he’s a bit scared of you,” John said.  “How many times has he delivered pig parts?”
There were a long few minutes where the two Holmes brothers engaged in an entire mental conversation to which John was not privy.
“Of course.”  The doctor patted his arm.  “Push the call button when you’re ready.”
In the morning, John shaved carefully.  He dressed warmly. He cleaned his weapon.  He squared his shoulders and remembered who he was: John Hamish Watson of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers, army doctor, trauma surgeon, and one hell of a good shot.
He plugged his laptop in to charge and turned off the bedside lamp.  Sherlock was still sitting by the fire, illuminated by the glow of the computer screen and the soft flicker of the flames.  John climbed into that glorious bed, burrowing himself down under layers of satiny-smooth sheets and soft duvets.  He’d likely kick them all off later, but for now, it was perfect.  He rubbed his bare feet together, noticing how soft they felt.  He felt full and warm and exhausted.  Yawning, John said goodnight to Sherlock and to one of the most bizarre days he’d had in a very, very long time.
John knew he meant it literally.   Sherlock wasn’t a virgin, that much was for sure.  But as far as being loved?  Having sex be an act of love?  John knew, without a doubt, that this evening, for all intents and purposes, was Sherlock’s first time.  So John held him, breathed deeply, and fell asleep smiling.
The more John thought about the noise he heard the night before, the more anxious he became.  Not a nervous anxious, or troubled anxious, no; it was more of a tingle of anticipation, the odd feeling that coiled at the base of one’s gut right before something
Sherlock raises his eyebrows but gets his coat nonetheless.
“Stubble burn.  I’m told it’s not all that comfortable.  Some girls like it, though,” he said absently.
John looked at Sherlock for permission, who nodded in the affirmative.
John did so, his heart beating triple time.  Sherlock got to his feet.  “Watch me,” he said.  “Watch everything.”  And then he turned around, felt for the arms of the chair with his hands, and tucked his shins up on either side of John’s thighs.  He made the awkward move look graceful, acrobatic, even, and then he leaned forward.  “Watch,” he said, voice less commanding and more needy than it had been before.  “Watch as you go in.  Relax if you can.”
Mary turns to him, attempts a smile.  “I know,” she says.  “It’s OK.”
John turned and brushed his lips softly against Sherlock’s, once, twice, without any intention of taking it further.  Sherlock relaxed and kissed back, running his tongue just along John’s lower lip before pulling away and rearranging himself so he could fit under John’s arm.
Sherlock looked at the water.  John had never seen him embarrassed.  He clearly was now.  “I’m a man, John,” he whispered.  “I have the body of a man.”
In it and below it the makings of heroes.
John chewed his lip.  God, it had been forever since he’d chatted someone up.  It used to come so naturally to him.  “Do you live on the property?”
“It’s a gift,” clarified John.
“Couldn’t tell you.  Look, John, it’s worth a look, anyway.  Beautiful country.  It’d be nice and quiet, that’s for sure.  Train ride’s not so long, either.  You’d like it here.  It’s not London, but it’s a great place to research and practice medicine.  Come up and see me sometime.  I’ve got a great lab.  Teaching’s not so bad, either.  Maybe we could arrange something for you.”
“Unclear.  But I’m beginning to think I may have been incorrect.”
“Well, I’m not now.”
“Now is fine.”
And so, with every press of his hands, every tug, every jerk, every twist and pull, John told Sherlock just how amazing he was.  His slippery hands massaged his lover’s balls, kneaded at his perineum, pressed against his anus with a fingertip until it yielded, then, as lovingly as he could, John Watson took Sherlock Holmes apart with touch alone.
The two ladies wheeled the laundry basket into the utility room and Navya took another sip of tea.  The washer began to fill.
John stared out of the windows from his seat in the library, where Willow Cross served coffee, tea and a continental breakfast buffet.  He still felt a bit full from last evening’s meal, and after the emotional roller coaster of a night, he was quite content with a strong coffee and a croissant instead of the more substantial fare served in the dining room.  The rain had blown away and the day looked like it was going to shape up nicely.
Here, in the bedroom, my penis becomes “cock”.  It becomes “prick”.  Here, intercourse becomes “fucking” and “lovemaking.”
What he wanted to say was something along the lines of, “Christ almighty, I am not actually seeing this” or “What in God’s name are you doing?” or “That’s
“Hmm?  No, I don’t think so.  Just let me adjust.”
John heard Sherlock laugh bitterly as he took a seat next to the open window.
Sherlock sat there, sipping his tea, staring at some place on the wall.  “Go and pack a bag, John,” he said.
“Gentlemen, I bid you a lovely afternoon.  It seems that when one crisis is resolved, another arises to take its place.  John.  Sherlock.”
Sherlock drew him yet even closer and pressed a kiss to his head.  “Not particularly.  It’s a physiological response; I’m honestly rather tired.  Let’s go to sleep.”
“Exactly.”
Quite the opposite, actually.
“Tell me.”
“Your breathing changed,” said Sherlock, rolling back toward him again.  “Did I upset you?”
Willow Cross is loosely modeled after Hoar Cross Hall Spa Resort, which, obviously, I have never visited.  I've taken great liberties with it, but if you'd like to see what's in my mind as I write, look here:  http://www.hoarcross.co.uk/
John heard Sherlock swallow.  He turned to face him.  “You should say goodbye.”
“So what is she doing behind closed doors?  Giving bad massages?”
Sherlock sat, primly, on the chair across from him, put his elbows on his knees, steepled his fingers, and rested his chin on them.
John startled as Sherlock suddenly leapt out of his seat behind the desk and strode over to him.
So John removed his shoes, took off his jumper and slung it over a chair, and flopped down on the bed to read about the resort.  It was hard to concentrate when clearly Sherlock was talking about him, to Mycroft, no less.  John heard a few distinctive phrases: “personal life”, “embarrass John”, and “don’t need your help.”  When Sherlock emerged, spots of colour tinged his cheeks.
They’d been a good hour at Greg’s team’s regular haunt, half-heartedly watching the rugby and eating crisps when John noticed Greg’s unusual interest.  They were both on their third pint of bitter but far from drunk; it wasn’t one of those nights.
John regarded her closely; Molly was really beautiful in her own right: deep brown eyes, turned-up nose, expressive mouth.  Her skin was lovely, smooth and flushed from the afternoon heat.  He was glad for her company and truly wished her the best.
You may have noticed the rating has gone up.  Haven't decided if this fic will get explicit yet, but there will be some sexytimes, for sure.
“I had nothing to do with it!  I mean, I helped manage our club.  Trendy place in Miami.  Anyway, there was this business with a high-profile murder case and it was all over the news.  I had no idea Frank was involved, honest.  He’d done a rather fine job covering everything up but it made the tabloids back home and one day I opened our door to a good-looking young man who gave me an earful.  He’d come all the way from London, bless his heart.  He was still a student then.”
And John did, right there on the bench, with enough passion to make even a goose blush.
“Do you really want to have sex with me?”  He asked this one quickly.  Maybe he had dreamed it all.  This was Sherlock, after all, Sherlock who usually claimed sex was unnecessary.
John willed himself to relax and controlled his breathing as he lay there enjoying the sensation of Sherlock’s fingers gently spreading his cheeks apart, his sharp intake of breath at what he saw there, then the warmth of his fingertips stroking, rubbing, teasing.  Sometimes Sherlock talked up a storm when he did this, saying all sorts of things that made John’s face go hot.  Other times, however, like now, Sherlock was quiet, reverent, even.  Even without the usual dirty commentary, John found the little sounds Sherlock did make arousing: the lick of lips, a breath through the nose, a shuddering exhale, a swallow.
Sherlock sighed.  “Of course I’m OK,” he said, irritation creeping into his voice.  “Why wouldn’t I be OK?”
The two of them walked to the spa together and John smiled nervously as Lillian greeted them and fussed about how Sherlock sadly wasn’t going to get the full experience.  She looked so pretty and fresh-faced; it was hard to imagine her as anything other than a complete professional.  Lillian insisted that John hold Sherlock’s suit jacket and his phone.
“It doesn’t,” said one of the event coordinators, looking rather worried.  “It’s corn starch.  It’s made in the United States.  And we fill the extinguishers ourselves at headquarters.  It’s very precise and monitored.”
“When I was seven our family went to the Dorset coast for a summer holiday.  It was pleasant.  I enjoy swimming.”
“Your arrogance.”
”  He yelled this last word, enough that John cringed a bit as the sound echoed off the tall ceilings.
Skulking around Willow Cross in the middle of the night was right up Sherlock’s alley; the man had no compunctions whatsoever.  John, on the other hand, was experiencing a familiar mixture of emotions: excitement and the thrill of danger or getting caught, tempered with an ingrained sense of morality.  Sherlock had half-convinced him that breaking laws for the sake of justice was morally acceptable (Cancels it right out, John) but John still felt slightly
Mentions of depression in this chapter.
Waging a war with oneself is an interesting exercise.  I have conquered more tenacious beasts than love.  If I must continue with metaphors, then I am willingly surrendering to this.  John has invaded Afghanistan and a territory far more secluded and dangerous: my heart.
“It’s an incredibly complex flavour.  And just to create the flavour is a time-intensive process.  There are three subspecies of the orchid, one grown in Madagascar, one in the West Indies, and the original Central and South American cultivars.  Most of them are hand-pollinated, and was originally very difficult to grow anywhere other than its native Mexico because of its unique symbiotic relationship with the stingless species of bee,
“Gone traditional?” she asked, eyeing the teapot and half-eaten slice of parkin on John’s side of the table.
“Yeah.  He was angry.  Very angry.”
Sherlock shrugs.
“No.”
“I looked you up on the internet last night,” John said instead, coming closer to the bed and pulling up a chair.  “The Science of Deduction.”
The voice, articulation, language, whispering, shouting aloud,
“You’re going to get hate mail from animal rights activists.”
Sherlock looked at his violin, his expression softening.  His eyes raked over John’s face before a little wrinkle appeared between his brows.  “You don’t actually hate me,” he declared.
Sherlock smiled wickedly.  “Not yet.”
It was the first time he’d seen Sherlock lost for words, and if he weren’t blushing so horribly, John would have found the situation terribly amusing.  “That’s not what I was implying,” he managed.
observed Sherlock to John as he leaned over on the pretext of reaching for the pepper grinder.
John closed his eyes and relaxed, smiling to himself.  Sherlock loved to see his lover like this, relaxed, happy, the worry lines on his forehead and between his brows relaxed, his pulse racing in his throat, his cock stiff and proud.  Without his tucked-in shirts and frumpy cardigans, John looked younger.  Sherlock absolutely adored him.
“Are you embarrassed?” John asks after a beat.  “Seriously, you?”
“She’s driven, certainly.  And very clever.  She has impeccable taste and I wouldn’t be surprised if she were well-versed in feng shui.  She knows what will make her clients feel at ease and how to cater to the wealthy.”
“Ta?  And why does that not surprise me,” sighed Lestrade.
Not this again.  “I told you, we’re not…”
“Are you a detective yourself, Dr. Watson?”
This place had a whole wall devoted to hair products, enough nail polish to reconstruct a Michelangelo fresco on a wall of the Underground, and an entire arsenal of body creams and lotions that smelled like they should be eaten, not applied to the body.
John disagrees.  He remembers her anger when she was younger.
“My father used to read to children at the library.”
“Maybe play the violin for a little while?”
Mycroft studied his fingernails and appeared to be choosing his next words very carefully.  “Have you hunted for sport?”
“Why?”
for ages.”
Sherlock looked down and back up again.  “So I am.”
“You do still care about her, yes?”
The car left the M1 and began heading west into the countryside.  They passed two small villages before Sherlock spoke again.
“So,” John concluded, “we’ve got seven bottles of ridiculously priced shampoo and shit on the shelf, and he decides to make his own.”
John wasn’t planning on it, though his hands were getting a bit tired.  He spent a few minutes with the right, taking his time with toes, before switching to the left, but after listening to Sherlock moan and watching him writhe around, he couldn’t take it anymore: willpower depleted.
She presses on.  “Tell me about it.”
“You know, I was really concerned.  About the drugs,” John acknowledged.   I’m always going to worry.”
“Didn’t like
“Actually,” said John, “I don’t think he does.”  He thought about the way they’d fell into each other’s orbits of domesticity, although nothing was routine about living at Baker Street with London’s only consulting detective.  Mad genius he was, couldn’t be counted on for anything except the unexpected.  So far, John had learned much about his flatmate’s behaviour, including his bouts of boredom, penchant for chemical experiments that should likely be done under a ventilator hood right on the worktop, and ability to produce either achingly beautiful music or something that sounded like a mating cat from his violin.  They were becoming friends, John supposed, although Sherlock didn’t
John took it; it was an older model and warm from where it had been next to Owens’ body.  John didn’t actually want to type Sherlock’s mobile number into Owens’ phone, so he dialled his work phone instead.
John watched Sherlock deduce her, and relaxed a bit when he must have deemed her trustworthy.
“Right.”  She took a deep breath, retrieved her clipboard, and composed herself.  “I’ll let you know.  Ring you later.”
embarrassed?”

He very much liked the sound of that.
“Not quite a cigarette,” he mumbled.
Navya did some sort of polite snort. “Don’t tell me Golden Girl has done something wrong.”
before manoeuvring himself so he was propped up semi-supine against the headboard, supported by pillows.  He spread his legs and helped John position himself between them so they were facing each other and close enough to kiss.
“Mrs. Jenkins is particularly highly-strung.”
Sherlock gave John a cold look.
John gave him a sad smile.  “You’re not.  But that doesn’t mean I don’t feel it.”
Chapter 5
He was reaching into his pack for morphine and an epipen when he noticed Murray, across the narrow street, take a hit in the arm.
“Backwards.”
He was in the middle of trying to tell one of the decorators to take an inventory of all of the hall’s original pieces of artwork when he received a text.
Together they limped their way to the bed, where they wriggled in under the covers facing each other.  John, feeling dopey and lovestruck, leaned forward and rubbed his nose against Sherlock’s.
Sherlock’s narrative, peppered with unnecessary facts and figures, explained how he had to go ‘undercover’ and post a few videos of his own, along with learning some rudimentary hacking techniques, to figure out who had started a massive online attack against a university student and keen rugby player who posted a video on his Twitter in which he repeatedly slammed a fluffy grey cat against a wall.  The vigilante sent the video to every major animal rights activist group he or she could find, and the student was bombarded with hate mail and even had the door to his flat smeared with cat excrement.  None of that troubled Sherlock in the least.  What finally piqued his interest was that the rugby lad eventually landed himself in the hospital with a mysterious illness after the vigilante posted a tweet that read, “Brandon will finally respect pussy.”
John was dressed (the well-fitting jeans and polo shirt courtesy of Mycroft) and ready to go when Sherlock burst into his room without knocking.  “I can’t THINK!” Sherlock yelled as he flung himself into John’s spare chair, a habit he’d taken to that John could not seem to get him to stop.  “There’s this horrible noisy thing that sands floors and some dreadful woman keeps floating around taking pictures and wants to redecorate my room.  It’s still
“That’s about enough of that…”
In the end, the story left Sherlock confused.  The wrinkle between his brows grew more pronounced.  “Who is the gardener then?  My father?  Or is he the lord of the manor?  Is Maggie supposed to be the lotus flower that was really an artichoke?”
“I think you probably left all sorts of grotesque things for her to find.  Sherlock, what happened with Sally Donovan?  Mr. Campbell said her father was a right dick.”
The man lifted his head.  “Really? That’s not what people usually say.”  He looked genuinely surprised.
“No, really, Sherlock, stop.”  John mustered all of his strength and pulled Sherlock’s face back so he could see his eyes.  “As much as I am enjoying myself, we’ve got to get out.  It’s going to be morning soon, I’m so keyed up that I’m about to add my DNA to this pool, and I’m sure there’s Epsom salts in this water, so if you keep at my neck like that, you’re likely to get a miserable case of diarrhea.”
“You do this to me on purpose, don’t you?”
“You have such belief in me, John.  I’m not sure it’s wise to put so much faith in one man.”
, he thought.
“It’s incredibly addictive, you know.”
Then Sherlock’s fingers were back, wet, adding lubricant to his already soaking arse.  “You’re so soft and open already,” Sherlock whispered in awe.  “Just from my tongue.”
“Sherlock?”
“Why?” John asks around a mouthful of egg.
“Incredible,” breathed John.  “You all right?”
I guess I tickle him a bit in my snuffling, for now he is waking.
Sherlock was always saying.
John packed his own backpack.  He wondered if he’d ever be able to go anywhere without something strapped to his back again.  He still struggled with a feeling of nakedness, the feeling of being
John looked at her sceptically.
I press my thumb more firmly against his perineum and inhale deeply.
John blushed.  Sherlock didn’t compliment people very often.  Not unless he meant it.  “What’s got into you?” he asked.
“I tried that!” Lestrade said loudly, throwing his hands up.  “Jesus!”
(See the end of the chapter for
There were moments, though, that John was sure that if he had just
“Of course.  You’re not the only one who can flirt as a means to an end, you know.”
“Six.”
“It was probably an old farm cat. They get feisty at night, you know.  Fighting.  And
“Do you want me to leave?  Does it embarrass you that I observe?”
John, having little else to do that day, took a walk around the grounds.  The spring breeze was warm, and the leaves, having finally unfurled into their green glory, whispered their delight.  Other than that, it was quiet.
“So you were polite simply because you wanted to use his lab.”
“Toys?”
John remembered the painting from the main reception area.  Mr. Phillip Leybourne, weak chin.  He really couldn’t picture Mycroft in jodphurs. Or having friends.  As far as John could tell, Mycroft wore bespoke tailoring at all times and had associates, business partners, enemies, and Sherlock.
wasn’t made for hands his size -- and rubbed it up his left arm.  Then, back down.  Better down than going up.  The neck, again, for good measure.  Yes, still pleasurable.  Pectorals?  Yes, nice.  Abdomen?  Slightly ticklish, but still comfortable.  A brush over his side made him break out in goose pimples.  He changed hands, tried his other arm, found the left side as responsive as the right.  Tried his armpits, found them ticklish.
“Yeah.  Was sussing those all out last night.  Turns out he’s been spending a ton of cash at - you’re not going to believe this - Willow Cross.  You know, the health farm.”
Sherlock continued to stare out the window at whatever had captured his attention for a moment more before finishing his coffee and placing the cup in the sink.  “I’m not taking the train,” he announced.  “Boring!  I hate the train.  All those people.”
“Thanks.  Maggie didn’t talk to your dad about what was happening, Sherlock.  But she wanted to.  She thought maybe he would understand or find a way to help, but she was too frightened to go through with it.  I wish she would have.”
“Everything else is boring.”
John sat in front of the fire, processing what had just happened, before retrieving his laptop.  He opened his blog, changed the settings to private and wrote:
“Thanks, Molly.”  John watched as a ladybird flew from the tray and landed on a glossy, dark green rose leaf.  “I really hope it blooms,” he said.  “It’s almost there, as far as I can tell.  I’ve tried a few things.  Epsom salts, cow manure, composted banana peel.  But Lestrade says they always get this far and then the buds just wither up and fall off.”
But now, here it was, the truth, with no caveats, no warnings, no stipulations.
“Want to take this to the bedroom?” John asked softly.
John laughed aloud.
to touch Sherlock.
John left, feeling for all the world that he was missing something.
John slid two nicotine patches under the door.  He took the rest back to his room, pulled on his old clothes, which had now been relegated to gardening attire, tucked the keys to the hidden garden into his pocket and headed out.
“Friend of yours?” queried John.
“Lestrade, I think you’d better get a team together.  I don’t think our Brian died of an accidental overdose.  Remember when I said we were on holiday?  We’re at fucking Willow Cross
Sherlock gave the cabbie an address and hunkered down with his phone, apparently researching.  John was both amused and concerned.  Last time Sherlock immersed himself into a new line of study it had been something to do with fish and rendered the flat so uninhabitable that John had to call to get it professionally cleaned and Mrs. Hudson was so Not Amused that she didn’t offer tea and biscuits for nearly a fortnight.
John opened his eyes and lifted his head.  He had a rather charming view up Sherlock’s nose.  He studied the shape of each nostril.  One was slightly smaller than the other.  How had he never noticed?  What other secrets of Sherlock’s body would he uncover?  He wanted to nuzzle his navel and run his hands up his hairy calves.  He wondered what a flat chest would feel like against his own.  Would it be pleasurable to rub their pricks together?  What would Sherlock taste like?  John wanted to know.  He’d waited this long, but he would gladly wait some more as long as he could just be close to him like this.
Sherlock shrugged into his leather jacket and put on his helmet before slinging a long leg over the bike (how he managed with such grace in jeans like that, John would never know).
“Did anything out of the ordinary happen at this party?” asked John.
“I don’t know.  ‘Watching’ sounds creepy and voyeuristic.  You could have said, ‘keep me company,’ instead.”
, John.”  Sherlock said at last.  “Swimming helps clear my mind.”
It wasn’t long before they pulled off the narrow lane and onto a formal drive.  The manicured lawn was pristine beyond the tall trees that flagged the driveway, and when he saw the house proper, John couldn’t help but gape a bit.  There were so many windows, tall slim panes of glass tucked between ivy-covered stone walls.
“I’m John, by the way,” he said.
“The powder, John!  Everyone else was sprayed by blue when they crossed the line; she was yellow, someone specifically targeted her.”
John thought.
Navya did her best to look innocent.  She shrugged her shoulders.  “Didn’t really pay attention.  Sorry.”
Now wingless.  What a hoot).
“I knew you from the day I met you.  Now I know you have fewer nightmares, that your leg no longer troubles you except when you’re overly tired; I know you like blackberry jam best, but not the kind with the seeds; I know you choose to read mystery novels when I’m not around because you fear I will tease you.”
“It’s not boring, for sure.”  That was the thing.  Living with Sherlock was never boring.  It was actually...comfortable, in a strange way.  Sherlock needed him.  If a bottle of homemade shampoo was his way of saying sorry or thanks, so be it.   He’d take it.
It's been a while between updates; I do plan on finishing the entire piece before September!
“Partner!” laughed Mr. Campbell.  “Is that what they call it these days?”
“I do have a job in Leeds.”
________________________________________________
Lestrade turned up Magic FM, the conversation having taken a turn toward nonexistent three exits ago.  John stared ruefully at the cars to his left.  A bored teen smacked chewing gum while she clandestinely checked her phone.  The man in the car next to hers was picking his nose.  And no one was going anywhere.
“Go back to sleep.”
“Likely.  Selfish git.”
“Oh yes.  Well, Sam here is.  He’s a big sweetie, really, but Josie can be temperamental sometimes.  I guess we all feel like that.  Nothing a bit of sunshine and some fresh air can’t fix.  It’s been so beautiful lately.” The horse --Sam-- stopped munching and looked up at the woman, sharing some kind of secret communion.  She reached up and stroked his muzzle.
an acupuncturist,” said John.  He’d given up trying to read the tiny font on Sherlock’s phone.
“I thought you said you didn’t do that type of thing, anyway?”
There, dressed in overlarge gray sweatpants and a ratty Radiohead t-shirt was a disheveled-looking Sherlock Holmes.  He still hadn’t shaved, and his face was blotchy.  His hair was starting to frizz.  “More patches,” he said, and then pushed past John into the room and began rifling through the papers and things on John’s desk.
It’s a funny kind of ache.
John eventually gave up and swam over to where his line was caught.  He followed the line with his fingers where it disappeared under the water.  “It’s caught on something,” he said, and then ducked under, following the line.  He opened his eyes; the water was silty where he’d stirred it up, and the weeds obscured his vision, but the hook seemed to have caught on something other than a broken tree branch.  He came up for air and plunged down again.  This time he wriggled the object free and brought it up.
Towelling off, I wonder what the rest of this weekend will bring.  Sex is a distinct possibility.  I shave, fix my hair, put on deodorant, try to negotiate my body’s desires (no, Sherlock, so much more than your body, you fool).  Even know, my mind is racing in directions I’ve never allowed it: John and physical intimacy.  What will he enjoy?  Even allow?  Can I touch him?  Anywhere?  What would he think if I fell to my knees in front of him, desperate to taste him, to take him in my mouth and suck him hard?  There are so many things I want to do, so many experiences I want with him.  Then it hits me - this goes both ways.  How will he touch me?  How will I react to his lips, his fingers, the feel of his skin pressed against mine?  Will he want to perform fellatio?  Should I ejaculate in his mouth, or is that off-limits?  What about penetrative sex?  Will he be slow and thorough or quick and dirty?  I want to know his body (all of it, every inch, and then some more).  Will he want to know mine?  I’m not a complete novice, but this emotion is completely unprecedented and John has been someone’s lover before, knows the intimate and mysterious dance of bodies and hearts.
John put apricot jam onto a piece of toast and brought it to Sherlock, who propped himself up with a few pillows and looked at it disdainfully before taking a tentative bite.  It was gone in three, and when he looked up at John, John finally saw Sherlock’s eyes by the light of day: they were an unusual shape and color -- a striking blue-grey-green.  And right now, those eyes were imploring.
“Trout is excellent pan-fried.  Do we have any lemons in?  And some fresh tomatoes…”
“Busy.”
love, he
Even though Sherlock was out and likely would be all day, John double-checked that his door was locked before he retrieved his recently-acquired sex aid from where he was hiding it in an old shoebox.  He was proud of the fact he’d got it without Sherlock’s knowledge.  It required ordering from Amazon and intercepting the parcel upon delivery; Sherlock surely would have known had John actually visited a shop that sold such accoutrements.  He’d placed the item (a dildo in what he figured must be Sherlock’s size) in a clean cotton sock and inserted it into a pair of old trainers.  Now, unwrapped and in his hands, it seemed much larger than he’d initially thought.
“Yes, right.  Well, he has the knack for it.  He always saw things other people didn’t.”
Sherlock chuckled, his voice deep and wonderful.  “I wasn’t finished.”
“I don’t know.  I’ve never slept with anyone before.”
“I want to know what happened to my father,” Sherlock said simply.
Sherlock, however, seemed to be incredibly upset.  Usually the commentary and speculation about their supposed sexual relationship didn’t bother the detective in the least.  He never seemed to care what other people thought of him and never understood why John did.  “People see what they want to see, John,” he always said, and dismissed the knowing looks and speculative glances without pause.
“Come here,” said Sherlock, the tone of his voice now gentle and seductive.  John eyed him dubiously, convinced Sherlock would drag him back out and dunk him again, but when Sherlock held out his arms, made sad eyes at him, and called his name
“Sure.”  John gazed out into the dark.  “It’s strange, isn’t it?” he mused.  “Saying goodbye to all of this.  Leaving a legacy.”
“I never thought I’d find myself dancing like this,” John laughs after stepping on Sherlock’s feet...again.
“I can’t believe you were living like that,” she said quietly.  “Not you.”
It was then when Sherlock’s arm finally gave in and he fell both fell flat on the bed, John still on top of him, panting and sweating and shaking and coming and coming and coming.
“She watched our wedding video again,” John says at last.  “I was so angry.  I lost my temper.”  John can hear Sherlock’s glass joining his on the table.  Sherlock is watching him, but John can’t look yet.  He feels hot all over, emotional.  “I don’t want to take it off.”
“I think you’ve already figured out the important bits.  I’m John Watson.  Nobody special.”
He said
, it reads.

“So,” he says, as they drive off.  “Where to now?”  He wonders if he’s talking about dinner or the rest of his life.
John put his fork on the table and stared Sherlock down.  John had stared down bigger and much more dangerous men, and when John was angry, he was righteously angry.  A charging rhino would have stood down to an offended John Watson.  At the moment, he was absolutely, incandescently furious.  His eyes bore into Sherlock’s with the heat of the Afghan desert at high noon.
John smiled to himself and left.
“I’d get parcels from home every once and awhile.  Had an ex who thought it would be entertaining to send me a pair of silky boxers.  Red, right?  For Valentine’s Day.  I don’t know what possessed me to put the damn things on that morning, but I did.”  He chuckles a bit.  “I spent an hour like that before one of those bastards finally told me.  I looked like a twat.”
John swore his eyelid was about to twitch.  “I’m taking a shower,” he announced, “and then I’m eating some dinner, watching some telly, and going to bed.”  He turned on his heel and headed to the loo, realizing he’d left his tea untouched on the counter.
“Sherlock, what is this...what are you…?”
Sherlock must not have even finished before he was back to manhandling, and before John knew it, he was being forcibly rolled from his front to his back so that he lay on Sherlock’s stomach.  How Sherlock managed to keep them connected was a miracle, but soon there were large, warm hands on his cock and within a few sloppy pulls and several deep thrusts, John was coming as well, gasping for air and only vaguely aware of his own semen landing hotly across his chest.
“What he was like?  The same as you remember him, dear.”
“Has all the feeling come back?” John asked.
“Shh, it’s only me,” said Sherlock as he slipped into the room.
“Right,” said John.  “Different wear patterns on the heel indicate overpronation or supination: high arches, flat feet, tilted ankles, Pes Cavus foot.”
Satisfied, John sat back on the grass and shed his jumper as he’d worked up quite the sweat in his dance with the foliage.  He couldn’t just cut the ivy down: Lestrade would notice.  A pocketknife would make quick work of little tendrils that attached the ivy to the wall, though.  If he cut the right ones, maybe he could make a curtain of it and hope the door opened inward.  Renewed, his belly fluttering a bit with anticipation, John began to work, and soon he was able to slip past the green vines.  The wooden door was painted green.  No wonder it had been difficult to spot: it was perfectly camouflaged.  John dug in his pocket for the keys, and with a sense of satisfaction, opened the padlock and then fitted the old skeleton key into its lock and prayed that it would turn.  After some initial resistance, it did.  With a smirk that would rival Mycroft’s, John slipped past the door and into a different world.
Another moment.  They were getting quite frequent.  Was Sherlock
“Does she even know you’re coming?”
“Mrs. Sandhurst,” John said as they walked out the room and into the nave, where choir members were assembling for practice.  “Do you happen to recall if a man named Miles Donovan was there?”
“Shit, I’m supposed to be at Greg’s place,” said John, looking at his watch.  “Kick-off’s at 3pm.”
“You haven’t got a buttonhole,” said John.
“I don’t buy it.  I think you
Then Mrs. Hudson saw the rose Sherlock had brought in, quickly put two and two together, cornered the two of them, and demanded to see the garden.  As suspected, she wept, and Sherlock may have snuffled once or twice.
“You first,” replied Sherlock, eyes dancing.  He climbed back across the bed to take John’s face in his hands again, eyes searching and apparently finding what they were looking for.  “John,” he said.  “My John.”
“Good heavens.  They were yelling for hours.  Mycroft left an hour ago, and Sherlock’s in his room.”
It sounds lovely, to be honest.
Chapter 7
“I know.  But I think…”
“Easy for you to say.  Hey,” John said, sitting up again, “Lillian was telling me about this special package she does.  ‘The Fountain of Youth’?  Maybe Sherlock would like that.  He’s too ticklish for the feet thing, but I’m sure he’d find it very relaxing.”
“What’s that?”
“John,” Sherlock said, his voice rough with emotion.  “Oh, John.”
Sherlock looked pleased and amused, as if he had revealed another clue to a mystery.  John didn’t like it.  It always made him wonder whether Sherlock really could read his mind.  The detective always said he could deduce John’s thoughts simply from his facial expressions - he’d catalogued them all, as far as John knew, on little mental index cards tucked somewhere away in his Mind Palace - but often the things Sherlock knew about John made John think that perhaps Sherlock could see more, see deeper, than surface tells, lines of the face, twitches of the lips.  Of course he could.  They were...friends, after all.  Flatmates.  The other unidentifiable thing of which they did not speak.
“Oh, please, call me Phillip. No! I never go in there. It’s all a bit....well, I don’t really like all that touching stuff and sitting about in towels.  For you younger men, yes.  But by Jove, Lillian knows what she’s doing.  Not long after she arrived Sing Sing got spooked by a rabbit and I went arse over tit into a ditch. Flat on my back for two weeks, then along comes Lillian and her Chinese magic and it’s all better. She has a healing touch.”
But for whatever biological or chemical --or romantic-- reason, right now Sherlock was not, for once, craving the feeling of John, hard and hot, inside his body.
“I know it’s
John frowned some more before taking a sip of his tea.  It was good. Pity the company was not of the same quality.  “Are you trying to intimidate me?” he asked pointedly.  “With the whole mysterious assistant, buying me clothes, knowing my life’s history, and arriving in the middle of the night?  Because I’m getting a distinct impression that you think I’m someone I’m not.  Entertaining, yes, but seems like a waste of both of our time.  Why exactly am I here, Mr. Holmes?”
He dug into his jeans pocket where Jenny had written her phone number on a serviette.  He held it in his hand for a moment, then opened his fingers and let the rushing wind take it.  He wouldn’t be needing it after all.
“It’s nice.  Pretty, too.”  John had never fully appreciated the scrubby brush on the moors until it all burst into colour the week prior.
John shivered at the blast of cold air, but calmly climbed out of bed.
“Yes.”
John spluttered a bit.  “Are you going to keep doing that?”
“He could have had; maybe his wife’s or his daughters’.”
Camp Bastion Hospital.  Still not dead.
“I suppose he doesn’t.  Rather sad, that.  Everyone should have a friend.”  She crossed her arms, pulling her cardigan tighter around her.  “Even him.”
“No.”
I have to admit I'm rather proud of myself for this chapter.  I'm really rather shit at writing case-based plot, and I came up with this one mostly on my own, and with some help from Canola Crush, who is very good at murders and motive, and BettySwallocks, who helped with all things British (and writing in general), it came together.  Thank you, readers, for helping to spread the word about this story that is so dear to me, and thanks for every kind comment and note -- I will try to respond to them all now that I have some more free time.
“Yes, yes, of course,” interrupted Sherlock. “Did you all cross at the same time?”  It was the first question he’d asked since the whole ruckus began.  John looked up at him as he continued to monitor Barbara’s pulse and respiration.
“I’m afraid,” whispered Sherlock as they lay in the dark.  “I tried once, and I couldn’t do it.”
Arguments went something like this:
“So, think you’ll get the position?” Mike asked after he finished his meal.
They ate their hors d’oeuvres companionably, Sherlock discussing the history of the building along with describing interesting features of the grounds before explaining his current assessment of Lillian.
“Feeling confident, are you?”
“He does eat,” confirmed John, unfazed. “After cases, usually.  Loads of takeaway.  Not sure what he does with it, though.  No...evidence...in the bathroom.”
John smiles.  “You’re more than fine.  Amazing.  Now go to sleep, Sherlock.”
John burned his tongue.  No, this was never, ever going to get old.  “You’re memorising your wank?”
“I actually prefer the clarinet.”
God help him, he has.
“Sherlock, it’s fine.”
Mrs. Hudson’s hearing is not what it used to be.  But the low, groaning notes she’s hearing from upstairs decidedly do NOT come from a tuba.  Is Sherlock hurt?  It takes her a moment to figure it out, and she giggles when she realises what’s going on up there.  She briefly considers retrieving her broom, which hasn’t been thumped upon the ceiling for over a year now, but she quickly banishes the thought.  Finally, her boys are together, the way they ought to have been ages ago.  Now where did she put those headphones?
“When was the last time you fired a weapon?” Mycroft asked.  “Since Afghanistan.  Your psychiatrist was concerned you were suicidal.  You also have a tremor in your dominant hand.  Many soldiers with PTSD can never shoot again.  What makes you think you can?”
“The exact moment of penetration.  Yes, I remember.  What about it?”
“No.”
John Watson, and he had certainly seen a hell of a lot of naked men in his life.  He’d lost his modesty along with the rest of his brothers-in-arms long before his tour of duty.  It’s hard to be modest when you’re scrubbing half the Registan from the crack of your arse with nothing but a cloth and a canteen full of water.
Sherlock took the jar as well.  “You bought these for me.”
“Ah, Doctor Watson,” he said, extending his hand.  “Welcome.”
Thanks to both of my wonderful betas for their work on this chapter.  And for all of you readers who keep leaving the most wonderful, encouraging notes.  I am so appreciative!  This has been so much fun to write...and so much longer than I originally planned!
“Oh, just an old chemistry textbook.  Came with the lot.  Useless, really.  Some overeager young lad wrote all over most of the pages.”  He handed the book to John.
“Oh!” he said, “that must be my samples.  Would you, John?”
It's Corpus Hominis, now with plot!
“It’s not meant to be
“Sam!”
“Finish it.  Does she love you or not?”
Thanks for the super-speedy beta, DarcyLindbergh.
“No,” Sherlock scoffed, as if the very concept of self-consciousness was beneath his contempt.
Chapter 13: It’s not a date
the lesson?  This is a stupid story.”
“She routinely breaks hospital policy for you just because you give her that look when you want something.”
“Tell me if it’s too much,” John said, leaning down to press a kiss between the blades of Sherlock’s shoulders, inadvertently brushing his genitals over the swell of Sherlock’s buttocks as he did so.  Very nice.
Sherlock continued to stare at him a moment more before shutting himself in what must be the bathroom.  John remade the bed and made tea and felt very useful indeed.
“Is it OK?  I know you don’t usually go in for this sort of thing and…”
John really hadn’t ever seriously thought about what a relationship with a sexual Sherlock would be like.  He never really thought it would happen.  He had never thought Sherlock would embrace sex.  They really hadn’t even done much but a bit of kissing and naked squirming about in the pool, and already Sherlock was masturbating in the shower?  Holy fucking hell.  Scenario after scenario spun out from his mind in different directions, of them actually having sex and Sherlock hating every minute of it, or of it not working, of Sherlock being repulsed by acts of the body, of Sherlock cringing at John’s confessions of love, of Sherlock divulging some intolerable sex kink, of Sherlock deciding it were all just an experiment, of Sherlock becoming some horrible needy, clingy thing...
“You...thought I was...disproportionately large?”
“No.”
“Oh God, oh God!” Smith was screaming from across the street.  One moment he was standing, the other he wasn’t.
“Play for me, Sherlock.  Play you.”
“Mmm.”
Together they carefully sowed the seeds around the stump, poking holes with their fingers in the freshly-tilled, fragrant earth, inserting the little black seeds, and gently tamping the soil down on top of them.
“His what?”
“Barbara Ewing.”
Satisfied with himself, he wiped his hands on his jeans and went to sit on the bench.  As if on cue, a robin flew down and landed on the birdbath, cocking its head this way and that, as if to say,
had managed to elude Sherlock’s detection for a little while.
The first time he hears it he thinks the world is ending. That’s at least the message his brain relays to his muscles, and he nearly falls out of bed.  It’s 4am, and from downstairs there is a deep yet strident blast of a horn.  John sits up, rubs his eyes, and tries to calm his racing heart.
Owens continued to stare at the floor.   “I didn’t do anything.”
“Then I shan’t fall where you can’t catch me.”
Afterwards, John was so adamant that our kitchen is not a proper laboratory that for my birthday he had a chemical hood installed.  Mrs. Hudson was overjoyed.
Terror uncurls from the middle of his gut as John sees Mrs. Hudson is alive and well.  He’s felt like this before, during the firefight that resulted in his shoulder wound.  A bone-deep panic coupled with a startling revelation.  Then, he’d been panicked about his mates who were falling left and right and realising he was shot and likely going to die himself.  It’s a horrible sense of deja vu, but this time, the panic comes knowing that Sherlock is in imminent danger and John isn’t there to protect him, and the realisation that John loves him.  Some people compare these types of emotional outpourings to the opening of floodgates; John will later think of it as a detonation, as if someone put a bomb inside a glass building and eighty-million shards of truth pierced him from the inside out.  For with that knowledge came the certainty that he was doomed, that this was the end, that Sherlock had done something irreversible.
“Not all.  Go ahead and put them on the shelves.  I’ll arrange them later.”
“Last I heard you were off in Afghanistan.  What happened?”
Sherlock inhales sharply next to him.
Sexual intimacy with Sherlock had a somewhat rejuvenating effect on John as well.  People he’d known for years were asking him whether he’d been on holiday, or whether he’d “had some work done”.  Hair cut?  Lost half a stone?  John would laugh and give his standard (and honest) answer: he’d been getting more exercise.  He was also the subject of a sometimes frightening devotion by Sherlock, and after a few months of being routinely worshipped in bed by an eager and attentive lover, John had good reason to walk with his head held higher and smile a bit brighter.  Dr. Watson had rediscovered his mojo.
John takes charge of building a fire in the large inglenook hearth while Sherlock potters around, checking this and that, before retrieving the glasses and a rather nice claret.
