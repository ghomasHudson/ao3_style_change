The first ten across his thighs obliterate any thoughts from his mind. It’s all pain, and he knows he’s screaming even if he can’t quite hear it. Cas gives him a break to catch his breath, then rains down another ten, far down on his thighs, where they bite into sensitive and thin skin. Dean kicks and wails, throat raw.
When he comes to properly again, Cas is sitting back up, wiping a hand over his mouth. He grins at Dean.
“I want you to hurt me,” he admits, hoarse. “I want you to hurt me and fuck me, I want to be bruised and used.”
The awful, terrible truth is that Cas is right. This is where he feels at peace, this is where he feels the most loved. He hates it, hates that he loves this, needs this, is so, so grateful to Cas for seeing him and understanding him.
The plug is removed in the bathroom and the shocker comes off as well, before Cas shoos him gently into the shower. Dean ducks in under the water, then stares in amazement as Cas steps in naked with him, broad chest damp with the steam. His eyes widen even more as Cas nudges him, then sinks to his knees.
Looking up at him with soft, yet determined eyes, Charlie gives him a small smile. “I was here with you when you fell apart. I’ve been there when Dean fell apart. You two love each other, and I know Dean’s never been the type of person to do something like this. If he’s unhappy he just leaves. But Cas,” she says taking a step closer. “He was never unhappy. You two just have this…spark, or something. It’s what most of us look for when out there in the dating world. You guys are the thing people talk about when they talk about faerie tales.”
It isn’t until his breaths come out steady but shakily that he lifts his heavy head, squinting against the bright lights to try and look at his mate.
“You gotta know I don’t care about that shit, Cas.” Hesitantly, Dean brings his hands up, cupping Castiel’s face in return. “You of all people know me better than that. I love you too damn much to ever ruin what we got.” Taking in a shaky breath, Dean shifts his body, closing the barely there space between them. Pressing himself into Castiel more feels so much like a missing piece shifting back into place he wants to cry. Instead, Dean moves his hands and runs them through Cas’ soft, dark, unnameable hair. Overwhelmed with just being allowed to touch Cas like this again, Dean lets out another choked out sob. “Losing you nearly killed me.”
A part of him wants to explain something, or enough of something, that Sammy will drop his macho beta whatevering he’s doing with Cas. But there are still holes in his memory. There are parts of the night that he doesn’t remember, and honestly he wants to live as long as he can without being hounded to answer a million questions that he knows are coming sooner, rather than later.
“So, you know how I’m always telling you about how the government is always listening?” She says as the tapping of her fingers over her keys starts up. “Like, as long as you have something electronic around you, everything is being recorded, right?”
Dean wakes up in the middle of the night to him grinding against his mattress, blankets soaked in what he can only assume is sweat, but he’s so out of it he doesn’t care. He doesn’t even pause to get his hand involved, but comes in his boxers only having a moment of peace before he starts to panic as something gushes out of his ass. For a moment Dean thinks he somehow shit himself or something, but after doing a quick check realizes it’s only some sort of slippery, clear fluid. Twenty minutes later Dean is hornier than he’s ever been in his life and lets his body take over and do whatever it wants just to get off. He jacks himself off, three fingers deep inside himself as more of slick fluid spills out of him.
The world blurs into pain, the thwacks on his ass making Dean cry and scream until he’s hoarse. He’s pretty sure he’s still kicking, but he couldn’t tell you for sure. It’s terrible and all he wants is for it to stop. He begs for it to end, he promises Cas he’s learned his lesson, and yet Cas keeps going.
” he snaps. “You’ll stay here tonight, you’ll whine about Bela and Crowley, and tell me all about it. Then you’ll drink, probably too much, and you’ll weep into that pillow behind you, and in three days, Bela will be on the front porch, crying her eyes out because she
Dean presses the pad of one finger inside himself and sobs around the fingers in his mouth. It’s too much. It’s not enough. The spit is drying already, and it’s slightly too rough. He pulls the fingers he’s been sucking on out of his mouth.
Other than that, I seriously can't believe that the this fic started with the idea of "I should write Luke some cute Daddy kink." Well, bby, you got daddy kink, but there's apparently nothing cute about it. I had a wonderful chat with someone about what a relationship would look like between a sadist!Castiel and a Dean who's not a masochist but still deeply submissive and will take the pain anyway, because it pleases Cas. The ideas mashed together.
Some things change after that, some things don’t. Cas takes to it like a fish to water. He requires that Dean texts where he is and where he’s going, and instead of feeling inconvenienced and oppressed, Dean feels safe. Cas starts plating his food, and Dean’s startled to find it makes him acutely aware of who Cas is to him. To his dismay, his portions of rabbit food grow. He really should have guessed.
Dean’s shoulders ache as he hunches forward, tugging awkwardly at the unyielding cuffs around his wrists. He feels pathetic, speared on the plug and cock hardening against Cas’s hand. The tears come back, running silently over his cheeks. His jaw hurts. Cas’s hand goes away and comes back warm and slick, which feels so good Dean groans deeply.
“They say if you push a dog’s nose into it’s mess, they learn to stop making messes,” Cas says. “Maybe it’ll work on useless boys like you.”
The first one lands on Dean’s thigh with enough force that it takes him a moment to remember to breathe, and when he does, it’s only to scream. All of them are like that, raining down on the backs and insides of his thighs.
Cas comes over, wearing his fugly bathrobe and a pair of old boxers that should probably be burned. He picks up the papers and reads through them.
Yes. Yes, they had. Dean pressed his face closer to Cas's leg, breathing deeply. For now, the foulness inside him had calmed, and later, they’d figure it out together, but for now, everything was finally okay.
He yanks Dean’s briefs off the rest of the way, then cuts off Dean’s T-shirt with a pair of scissors. When he turns Dean around, there’s a plug suction cupped onto the counter, near the corner of the island. It’s not the biggest one they own, but once it’s in, there will be no ignoring it, that’s for sure.
Then he shouts and tenses, because Castiel is between his knees, two fingers sliding up inside him and
Some time later, once the sun is peeking through the trees at the edge of the property, a giant mop of hair sits down next to him on the porch step.
Dean passes the lube back too, then sags down. Two fingers press into his ass, wet and cold and too big, and he screams as Cas lays blow after blow on the inner crease if his ass.
He snorts, climbing out of the car. This has happened before, many times before. He knows how loud the Impala can be, that Cas probably heard him ages ago. The April rain is icy against him. He doesn’t bother ringing the bell or knocking, just walks in and kicks off his shoes.
It takes a minute for Cas’s breathing to return to normal, and then he allows Dean to lick his cock clean before he tucks himself away again. Dean knows he’s smiling, but he can’t stop. He’s been used and made Daddy happy, so everything is good now. So good.
“I’m afraid I can’t actually let you hurt him in here.” Crowley sounds disgustingly sincere. “Code of ethics, all that.”
Dean throws his head back and laughs, and Castiel would be content to watch this all night, but then Dean comes over, leaning close to his ear.
There’s not much talking after that, as Cas blows him just right, wet-hot suction making Dean’s brain melt out of his ears. Seeing the obvious pleasure on Cas’s face, his lips stretched around Dean’s cock which disappears into his mouth over and over again, is too much.
Fingers smooth over his shoulders, Castiel’s arm coming to hold him under his chest, and the rope to his arms is released, lowering them to his back. He groans, shoulders on fire and knees weak, but Castiel draws him close, pulls him up so Dean can lean his head against Castiel’s shoulder and he lets Castiel guide him back onto a pile of books. Up, and up, until the dildo slides out of him with a squelching sound and he’s left empty and open and drained. He’s not entirely aware of being gentled down on the bed, but it’s soft and cool against his clammy skin. He reaches for Castiel as soon as he’s horizontal, but Castiel is elsewhere, too far away, and he whines.
Feeling lost, he does what he always does, that is, exactly what Cas told him. He trudges upstairs, pulls on faded jeans and a shirt, then detours into the bathroom where he digs out a small box from behind the hairspray. He opens it, looks at the ring, then looks up into the mirror above the sink.
He thinks about Cas coming home and calling up the stairs for him, even though he would have seen the empty spot where the Impala should have been. He thinks of Cas reaching for his phone, frowning at the lack of messages. He thinks of Cas dialling Dean’s number, and hearing Dean’s phone go off in the kitchen where he’d forgotten it this morning.
At first, Cas does nothing, and Dean tracks him as Cas tidies up the kitchen, moves some of the chairs from the breakfast nook away. He whimpers when Cas makes sure to pull all the blinds and curtains away from the kitchen windows, letting in the sunlight from the backyard. They don’t live far outside of town, but far enough that their neighbours aren’t within shouting distance. Knowing that doesn’t help the fear in Dean’s stomach. The sunshine makes him feel like at any point, someone could walk by and see him gagged and cuffed, sitting like an overgrown toddler on a counter.
“Because Daddy loves me and worries about me,” Dean squeezes through his tight throat. How did he forget?
Dean opens his mouth, but he doesn’t get the chance to thank Cas before his hand squeezes tighter in warning.
If you're wondering, the remote controlled prostate massager Cas tortured Dean with is the Nexus Revo Slim. The eleven ounce plug is the Njoy Pure Plug in Large, where as the small one is indeed "only" five ounces -- and yes, there's an XL one that's 1.3 lbs.
That’s okay. Dean’s head swims with the persistent thrusting, the way Cas’s thick cock forces his mouth open and jams his airways when he bottoms out. By the time Cas shoves as far in as he can go and grunts, Dean is floating on a cloud and the hot-bitter come in his mouth is the best of rewards.
Dean walks into the cozy living room, where Cas is still in his work suit and tie despite it being nine on a Friday evening. He’s lost the jacket, unbuttoned the top button and loosened his tie, sitting comfortably on the sofa, nursing a beer. Zach must have kept him late at the office. Dean flops down next to him, not bothering to take off his jacket.
He does gather Dean up though, moves him around until they’re under the covers, Dean’s head on his pillow and Cas curled in close behind him.
Dean stands, legs shaky, and steps up on the books. The purple dildo nudges his ass as he gets into position. Castiel nods, reaching up to draw a line from the eyelet bolt at the top of the frame to Dean’s wrists and the top of the ball gag harness. He can’t lean his head forward at all, can only stare at Castiel chin and face as he ties the knots. Now, Dean’s not a tiny guy by any means, and his wrists are only around his ears, but when he raises them, he notices he can move his head again, feeding rope to the line at the top of his head. Castiel pecks his nose, then wipes drool from Dean’s chin.
The books they’ve looked through have given them nothing. Some of the oldest texts they’ve looked at haven’t mentioned anything about The Mark of Cain other than what they already know. Nothing even hints at being able to get rid of it. Granted, a cure for Cain might not have been what anyone was leaning towards back when the Father of Murder was on the loose, but there were hardly any records of any attempts to kill him. Nobody simply got close enough to try, and if they did, well, they were just another stain on the Blade.
What the fuck? An omega putting their claim on an alpha? Dean tries to wrap his head around it, but he just keeps thinking back to those first few weeks where the news showed blurred images of omegas getting raped on the street from behind, and the unmistakeable red of blood dripping from their necks. How would an omega even be able to get in a bite?
“Black and white isn’t always so easy to go by,” he continues like Dean answered him. Maybe his silence was answer enough, or maybe he wasn’t ever really expecting one. “There’s always these little gray areas no one seems to consider. Little things leading up to the bigger thing that no one ever takes into account. Maybe the person had it coming, or maybe it was just a little thing that set off that avalanche of shit that’s been piling up. But either way, I ain’t no law. I wasn’t put here on this earth to sit here and judge you for what you did or why you did it. Everyone’s got a tipping point. Some of us are just more unlucky to get caught when it happens.” Clicking his tongue the man shifts on the bench, the sounds of something metal on his jacket scraping against the stone wall as he adjusts his position. “So I’ll ask you again, and I’m not asking for the story. Simple yes or no. Did they deserve it?”
He hears Castiel growl, or at least it sounds like a fricken growl, and lowers the cup slowly, cocking an eyebrow at his friend who looks absolutely murderous.
“You are the Blade. You power it. You heard Cain, without you, it’s useless. How can I trust you to use it on that worthless slut if I give you back your boyfriend’s wings, hm?” Crowley’s face falls back into his usual smug smirk. “It’s called leverage, darling.”
Cas didn’t just leave because he needed time to adjust and find himself in his new town, no. He left him for someone else. Someone that, apparently, went to the same damn college as him because Castiel sure as hell didn’t.
Castiel opens his mouth, and closes it again. He knows he already knows the answer, but something inside him needs to hear it out loud. “Of everyone?”
The cedar and pine is more prominent here, though there’s a lack of any traces of honey in the air. Dean can’t quite make out the hints of wet earth, but there’s a heaviness lingering in the air like it’s there but not quite mingled in with the rest of the scent. Slowly he lets himself take in a few deep breaths of it, trying to let his alpha’s scent center him. Castiel is too focused on moving around the car to notice what he’s doing, or maybe he doesn’t care. Honestly, Dean is having trouble wrapping his head around everything that’s happened in the last twenty-four hours to really give a damn at this point.
Sitting there, gripping the phone tighter, Dean waits for whatever it is his alpha has to say. There’s nothing he can say at this point to change his mind if he’s leaving him.
“He doesn’t even hold any emotion towards you or I!” Castiel points at Sam. “You weren’t there, Sam. You have no idea the amount of power he has! If he hadn’t wanted to toy with me first, I would be dead and there wouldn’t be anything anyone could have done about it. No one in that room was stronger than him.” He looks away from Sam, feeling something tight building inside his chest. “That is how far gone he truly is.” He shakes his head, running a hand through his hair. “I am not giving up on saving Dean. But I will not go about it with some half assed idea that is going to get you hurt, or more than likely, killed. No matter how badly you want your brother back, you have to go about this logically.”
’ me! I know it may be a little too complicated for your stupid beta brain to work out, but most of us pathetic omega’s don’t get that harlequin romance novel life. We get the shit end of the stick, and you of all people know’s how that ends up!” He takes in a deep breath trying to push past the growing feeling of betrayal rising, knowing it’s probably already seeped into his scent. Instead he squares his shoulders and glares up at his brother. “I came to you to fucking fix this – fix me! Not set me up and send me off with the first alpha that
“I need to remind you that you are under oath,” he says to the the smirking man Dean has been spending the last three years trying to hide from. The man just gives the judge a small nod before leaning back in the chair, looking as unfazed as he had before the courtroom erupted into chaos. “Mr. Winchester you may continue questioning.”
Dean isn’t in the courtroom anymore. He isn’t safe, protected by police officers swearing no harm will come to him ever again. He isn’t free. He’s back in that cold house with those plain, grey walls. He’s back to drinking in his grief like it’s the finest of red wines.
Leaning forward just as Cas, finally, leans forward into his space their foreheads knock together and they both huff out broken chuckles. Dean grabs the back of his alpha’s neck, letting his tangling his fingers into his mess of dark hair. Just soaking in the simple touch of their foreheads resting each other has a peace settling in him.
Slowly, what feels like a feat all in itself, Dean shifts his head just slightly to look at Castiel. The man doesn’t even give him the common curiosity to look his direction. Instead he’s looking down at his
Instead of being sad or upset, Benny channels his emotions into anger. He laughs with the alphas that bring their cars in to get worked on, goes out drinking with them after work and eventually stoops down to their level calling Dean slurs. Dean tolerates it for about five minutes before slamming Benny up against one of the cars they’re working on, reminding him that he may be omega, but that doesn’t make him weak.
Dean looks around him for the shirt but doesn’t see anything. Sam gets up and leans over, pulling out a balled up worn gray ACDC shirt from behind his pillow and hands it to Dean. He thumbs the fabric for a moment, already smelling the faint hint of their mingled scent from his alpha.
The words burn coming up his thought, and it dawns on Dean that he hasn’t the slightest clue when the last time he spoke was.
“I wont let anyone hurt you,” Castiel’s whispers. “You’re safe now. I won’t abandon you. Not now. Not anymore.”
His heart stopped beating on a Saturday. Dean swears that every day his death must be killing him. His hands haven’t been steady since Cas died two years ago. Every day it seems like he’s walking through a fog, unable to recall anything from just moments before. He still finds himself talking about him, but only after it’s too late and people cut the conversation short because they’re uncomfortable.
“Kneel on the floor,” he says and Dean moves without thinking, flinging himself to the floor and keening from his ass meeting his heels. He stares up at Cas, blurry through his tears, towering in front of him and Dean belongs here, on the floor, hurting and naked and nose clogged and Cas’s, all of him Cas’s.
The spoon comes down right on the crease of his ass, the smack jolting through Dean’s ass and pelvis, and he claws at the floor as he screams. Another one mirrors the first one on the other side.
Naked, Dean scampers after him, unable to look away from Cas’s broad shoulders in his dark blue suit. The house is bordering on cold, since they’ve lowered the heating as the days have gotten longer and warmer. Cas leads him into the living room, stepping right on the line of Dean’s dirty clothes that litter the floor. Dean’s cheeks burn with shame as Cas settles into an armchair and looks up at him.
Dean whines. That thing’s huge. It doesn’t matter how much Castiel stretches him, it’s still going to be massive going inside him, splitting him open and
That makes Dean want to close his legs and hunch forward, but instead he aims at his right thigh, close to the hip. He looks up at Cas, who nods his go-ahead, then takes a deep breath and smacks the paddle down hard. Instantly, he curls forward, crying out with the pain.
“You take care of that,” Cas says, nodding down towards where Dean’s cock hasn’t softened in the slightest. “I’ll watch.”
Dean lets go, fists his hand next to his hip and stares helplessly down at his cock where it pulses, come drooling out of him while the crest of orgasm disappears in the distance. He shivers harder, knees weak, heat and frustration still pooling inside him.
Turning his head, not daring to let go of his cheeks, Dean licks at where his tears has wet the floor. It's hard, when he's still crying.
There’s a snick and an acrid smell, and Dean looks down to where his cock is slowly sliding in and out of Cas’s hand. There’s a permanent marker in Cas’s other hand, and he’s writing on Dean’s left thigh, neat precise strokes that trail down towards his knee. When Cas stands up, black letters stare back at Dean.
“I thought… I thought of you like that, living under my thumb, forever… and I wanted it. I wanted to be your everything; your king, your ruler, your God. It was terrifying. It felt as though you were asking the world of me and I wanted to give it to you, but what’s the cost of something like that? I left, because I could have taken it, taken you, and crushed you. I thought...” Cas stops himself again and studies their hands. “I would rather leave you as you are, than ruin you.”
Dean scampers, rushing to the bedroom where he kneels on the bed, ass up, face pressed to the sheets. He’s still embarrassingly hard, the tip of his cock rubbing against his stomach and sending sparks through him. He rocks his hips slightly.
They stare at each other. Cas’s mouth quirks, and Dean’s gone, bending over Cas’s lap, giggling. Cas’s arms close around him and he chuckles into Dean’s hair.
He groans, as the tongue returns, knees shaking. A finger joins it, rubbing softly over his hole, dipping just barely inside. Dean whimpers, clutching the window sill hard.
Cas stiffens, then pulls back. Dean’s not proud of the sound he makes, this tiny wet whimper in the back of his throat. Cas waits patiently until Dean manages to look up at him.
He lets himself get steered back into the kitchen, where a bandana sits innocently on the kitchen island.
Cas crawls over the bed, and Dean lies there, legs spread as far as they will go, tremors wrecking through him while the nightstand drawer opens and closes. Then Cas is back, which is equal parts wonderful and terrible and Dean is grateful and scared all at the same time. Slick fingers prod at his ass, and he tenses before forcing himself to relax. Cas surprises him, by gently rubbing his fingertips there until fear passes and Dean is pushing back to meet him. The gentle treatment continues, as Cas fingers him open slowly, one finger at a time, avoiding his prostate until he’s three fingers deep. Dean stares down at him, knowing he’s red eyed and is probably wearing the most stupidly adoring look. Cas looks back, smiles, then adds more lube.
“Yeah,” Dean gasps, grateful and eyes stinging. “Need you to hurt me so I don’t forget myself, so I don’t start shoving other things in there.”
He watches mutely as Cas sweeps up the mess and wipes off the tea. Cas never stops crying, wiping away tears with the back of his hand as he works. When Cas steps up to him after, Dean’s hands reach automatically for him, clinging to the sides of Cas’s shirt. Gentle hands, still trembling, cup Dean’s jaw and Cas’s thumbs stroke over his cheekbones.
. In fact, I love putting unruly, rebellious, bratty boys in their place. There’s only one title I want and you will give it to me. Now.”
There’s a devilish smile on his face when he rears up, weight on Dean’s wrists, and fucks him harder. Dean’s eyes roll back when Cas nails his prostate, a tight fist around Dean’s cock, and he comes, pinned down and speared and utterly perfect.
Quite frankly, Dean doesn’t know what to do with that. He nods blandly and shifts, then winces at his sore muscles. Cas immediately frowns, worried.
Then he nearly bites his tongue as pain erupts from between his legs at the same moment as Cas swallows his cock whole. His knees try buckle, his teeth clenched together as he arches, away from the pain and into the hot wet of Cas’s mouth. The pain recedes as Cas keeps sucking him, tight and tortuously slow, exactly the way that never fails to make Dean’s thighs tremble. By the time Cas pulls off with a soft
Looking back to the pair of betas Dean’s lips twitch threatening to let out another snarl. They both stand there with their smug faces, looking back at him in such a way that Dean knows even if he doesn’t fight them, he just
Dean feels himself blush and turns away from his brother before Sam can notice. “I mean, if you want to. Don’t have to. S’kinda nice having you here, you know? You probably have other stuff you need to do. I, uh, kinda need another shirt or something if you want to go back to your place, though.”
“Dean! DEAN!” Sam brings the phone away from his ear, and looks at the screen in defeat. “He’s gone. The line went dead.”
Reapplying pressure to his side with both hands this time, Dean closes his eyes and leans his head back against the tree. He tries to just focus on his breathing while the gunshots become more and more distant. Huh. Kinda weird since he’s bleeding so heavily. Shouldn’t the vampires be on him by now? Or at least being driven into some sort of bloodlust?
He knows that Benny, being an alpha, has the upper hand. That’s just facts. That’s just biology. What he may not be able to overpower him in strength, he can beat him out with his stubbornness and will to be free. And if he’s really being honest with himself, what does he have left to lose?
“I know!” He yells, his voice bouncing off the bland walls of the sterile room. Dean doesn’t even flinch at his alpha raising his voice. Honestly, he still feels kind of out of it, making everyone’s words not process very well until a few seconds after their said.
“So we aren’t the only ones with this. The rest of the world got hit with this thing too?” Dean asks.
All Dean can do is just stare back at him. It’s like the words are trying to process in his head, but it’s like there’s an error message that doesn’t seem to make sense. In all the years of raising his brother, then watching him get through school, Sam has always done everything one hundred percent by the book. Even out in the real world Sam would chastise him if he tried to bend the rules or get away with something.
Dean chuckles shaking his head. “See, that’s just the thing. You gotta have something to love to fight for.”
Knowing that any attempt he makes to try and get free will only make things worse, he tries to relax enough to not tighten up around Dean. He hears Dean spit again and the spit drip down on his hole, but the pain doesn’t ease. Castiel grits his teeth, fingers gripping the sheets as tightly as he can as Dean relentlessly thrusts harder, deeper, faster.
Dean vividly remembers the faerie gasping, his eyes glowing a bright blue and then a far away voice saying his name. Unafraid, Dean just traces the edge of his ear all the way the pointed the curve of his jawline, mesmerized by him. Then the faerie blinks and the glow is gone. Dean watched him look over his shoulder, his forehead scrunching up like he was thinking too hard before finally looking back down at him.
The dark haired man makes a broken sound, his blank face crumbling. “You don’t…you don’t mean that.”
He runs a free hand through his hair giving a shrug. “Doesn’t matter what I say. If you’re anything like me, you wont believe me.”
“Alpha voice,” Dean mumbles, finishing for him. He’s still a little fuzzy, but he does remember Cas saying that at some point since they’ve met each other. “Yeah, you said that.”
In two strides he’s standing over him. It’s impossible for Castiel not to notice how Dean is already half hard, as if he’s getting off on everything he’s doing. Dean reaches down and grabs a handful of his hair and pulls him up to his feet. Hissing, Castiel tries to knock his hands away but Dean just tips his head back and laughs.
“When I saw you today I didn’t think… And then I smelled you and it was like my body just knew. I’ve never smelled anyone who smelled so good and a scent like yours before, but something in me just knew – ” A low growl rumbles over the phone and Dean moans.
Rough hands grip and squeeze his shoulders tightly as Dean is thrown across the room, head slamming against the floor. Dean hears Castiel howl in pain before collapsing to the ground, out of his line of sight. A bright light clicks on that has Dean groaning at, turning his head away from the onslaught of bright light making his head throb even more.
“I…” He says, searching the mans eyes. Damn. Dean swears he’s never seen eyes so blue. They almost look like they glow, just slightly, giving them an otherworldly look.
“Now I’m afraid this night is going to drag on even more slowly than it already has been,” Castiel sighs dramatically
“He knew his safe word,” he replies as a twisted smile splays across his lips. His eyes settle on Dean, making bile rise in the back of his throat. “He never said it, though. Not once. He liked those games we played, didn’t you Dean?”
“That’s right,” Benny nods. “‘Member readin’ it in the paper all those years ago. Thought about gettin’ in touch with ya, but figured you’d need some time to, uh, ya know...”
“That’s the Father of Murder,” Crowley says in a low, gruff whisper trying to tug Dean backwards with him. “Cain.”
One thing Castiel was sure of is that the unresolved tension that constantly surrounding the three of them. The night Dean came back and Sam saw him with the Mark there had been so many words left unsaid. Thinking about it now, Castiel realizes he hasn’t been alone with Dean since that night. Sam constantly hovers over him making sure he wounds are clean, bandages fresh and that he’s eaten something at some point. As annoying and heartwarming it might be, Castiel knows the real reason behind he’s been obsessing about him, but won’t push the subject.
Unable to keep his eyes open any longer, he succumbs to passing out. Right before he loses all sense of consciousness, he thinks he hears Charlie say Dean’s name with some sort of promise behind it. But with his dreams lately, and the hope that they hold, Castiel decides not to trust anyone’s promise ever again.
“This world has been going to shit for a long time,” Dean mutters watching as the time he’s connected to Cas on the phone ticks on.
The receptionist presses her lips together, clearly contemplating his words. Her hand still hovers over the edge of the desk, just a brush away from the button on the underside of it. Castiel doesn’t realize he’s holding his breath until her hand moves and grabs the phone. He lets his breath out into the phone as the lady punches in a few numbers.
“I trained her. I built and created every last Knight of Hell, Abaddon included.” He steps closer to Dean, dropping his voice. “And how do you think everyone knows it is possible to kill a Knight of Hell with that Blade? Who do you think slaughtered them?”
They glare at each other for just a moment before Dean is right back in front of him again. He grabs the lapels of Castiel’s coat, and tosses him to the side like he weighs nothing. Castiel hits something hot, and arches his back the explosion of heat licking at his flesh. He shoves himself off the ground, and appears back in front of Dean who is seconds away from grabbing the Blade.
The pounding in his head seems to keep time with the slapping of skin, and suddenly the thrusting doesn’t seem so dry. There is a wet sound as Dean pulls back enough that he’s almost out of him, before pounding back in. Pain shoots through his body and a scream rips out of Castiel’s throat, knowing that the wet sound is his own blood. The warm huff of Dean’s breath tickles his ear and makes his hair stand up on end. No, not Dean. Not
Their first kiss happened a two weeks after Cas came clean about his feelings. Dean was leaving for the night and Castiel asked if it would be alright. What started out slow, chaste really, deepened quickly to something much, much more. Somehow Dean had been shoved up against the door with Cas kissing him like a man starving.
Dean leans over, thrusting harder again as Castiel blinks back the darkness that sits on the edge of his vision. He’s so focused on the pain that he doesn’t realize Dean’s hand is moving back towards his cock before his hand is around it, tugging at it again.
“Sam can fill you in more tomorrow. He’s passed out in his old room, so don’t freak out if you hear someone. Kid will probably will wake up with a wicked hangover that I’ll never hear the end of,” he chuckles dryly. “Sucks, though, you know? The whole way the world is. Thought maybe where he was he’d get to stay out of some of the bad.”
In the bedroom he chucked his clothes off, only dimly aware enough to shove them onto a chair instead of a pile on the floor. The room was light and fairly large, but the four poster bed made it seem smaller. Neither of them had particularly wanted a four poster bed, but they’d found it cheap and after a few modifications, it’d been an easier option than setting up hooks in the apartment they had rented at the time. He stood naked at the foot of it, reaching out to grasp each post at shoulder height. He’d asked. Castiel had promised. He tensed his shoulders, then relaxed and rolled his neck.
“Then I’m going to stand here and watch you, face down and ass up, begging me for it, telling me all of your dirty secrets.”
The first night in the cage is weird. He’s done this already with one of the prototypes, having worn it for a week, but waking up with his balls throbbing and cock trying to harden will never cease to be a strange sensation. Cas sleeps peacefully next to him and Dean glares at him in the dark. He goes back to sleep, uncomfortable. He wakes up the next morning with Cas’s hand covering his caged cock, which is reassuring and nice, but his cock is still trying to get hard. It hurts, quite a lot.
“So, based on everything we’ve discussed, it would seem that Dean here craves the structure and clarity of rules and punishments, especially painful punishments. It would also seem that you, Castiel, feel the need to put him in his place, make sure he knows the boundaries.”
“I know, sweetheart,” Cas murmurs and kisses his forehead. “You’ve been stressed, working hard, and we hadn’t had a chance to really be together, and you needed to feel me. Did I get that right?”
There was a rustle as Castiel set the book aside and got up, coming close to him. When his fingers touched Dean’s jaw, Dean jerked back, fixing his eyes straight forward instead. Castiel peered closely at him, then took a step back and picked up the braided cat o’nine tails that Dean had thrown onto the table, hefting it a few times in his hand. He’d picked that one specifically, but he refused to flinch from it. It was heavy, the ends tied in knots. It would hurt. Castiel put it back on the table, lifting his tea and sipping it again, still standing and just
“Because,” Dean turns towards him, slides into his usual sleeping position. “Because this,” he says, “I keep rubbing against the bed and it feels so good, sir.”
. He’s licking long strips along the underside of Cas cock. Cas is apparently far smarter than Dean, because he reaches over and grabs a pillow to shove under his head, so he can watch. When Cas cock is appropriately wet and Dean’s thoroughly cleaned off the precome at the tip, he looks straight into Cas’ eyes and takes him into his mouth, sinking slowly down. He’s nearly forgotten how, so he bobs slightly, getting used to the feeling again, and then he’s nosing at Cas’ pubes. The weight of Cas’ cock on his tongue is such a filthy pleasure that he groans, causing Cas to close his eyes and whimper. That’s a good sound. Dean would really like to hear it again, so he pulls back and nips with his lips at Cas frenulum before going further down and laving at Cas’ balls, sucking them into his mouth one by one, before returning to his cock.
. He wriggles his hand in between them, pushes his palm against Cas cock as they kiss, drawing out a long groan that makes Cas head drop onto his shoulder. It’s easy after that, rolling Cas onto his back, making short work of the offending clothing. He has no clue when their socks disappeared, but it’s just as well because tube socks will never ever become any kind of sexy and Cas is…
It tastes gross, of leather and dust and shoe polish, but Dean licks it dutifully, his knees aching, abs on fire, fingers cramping where they're keeping his ass spread. He cleans one shoe, mouth drying on the dust, then leans his forehead against it, seeking benediction, redemption, a moment of kindness.
gesture with his hand, and Dean strokes again. All the soap has washed away, and his hand is slightly too rough against his cock, but he doesn’t dare object. Cas’s face is entirely impassive, as he continues to look at Dean. It takes a few false starts before Dean manages to lose himself to the feeling of it. His cock is entirely uncaring about Cas’s displeasure, it delights in Dean being wet and exposed, probably pathetic looking as he shivers against cold tile and fucks his hand. Heat gathers low in his belly and he’s gasping, trying to keep his groans down, staring Cas straight into his eyes as the first contraction of orgasm shudders throu--
Then, the heel of Cas’s hand is on his bladder again and this time Dean doesn’t have a chance to stop it. Piss rushes out of his cock, up over his stomach and down his legs. It goes absolutely everywhere and he’s moaning from the relief and pleasure. It’s like coming all over again, until he’s all out and empty and exhausted.
Dean shakes his head, even as he tries to get away from where Cas’s fist continues to stroke him. The only thing he manages is to rub back at the plug in his ass. His bladder hurts. He’s over-sensitive and whining by the time Cas lets his cock go, only to dig his come covered into Dean’s hair, yanking his head back.
Next time he yanks Dean’s head back, he curls his fingers around Dean’s throat and there’s a tiny, tiny sound from Dean, his kiss slower and deeper. They’re getting somewhere. He sees movement off to the side and notices Benny moving someone along. Benny nods briefly to him and offers up a different instrument, a narrow whip made of four round leather thongs. He hefts it and considers it, looking at Dean who’s panting, but not breaking. Cas nods to Benny and goes back to run it over Dean’s back. He tests it’s length, noting it’s longer than the flogger he had, then swings. Dean grunts and moves up on his toes, before sinking back onto his heels again.
At twenty, Dean is limp, his back and thighs a deep red, with brighter marks from the narrower whip, sweat nestling in the dimples above his butt, his hair damp - and, when Castiel reaches up to release the restraints, Dean’s face is wet with silent tears. Dean doesn’t open his eyes, doesn’t sob, doesn’t do more than silently and limply tremble as Cas unbuckles the other restraint, wraps an arm around Dean’s chest and takes two steps to a love-seat near the cross. He lowers Dean to the floor - not unkindly, but perfunctorily.
He tries to tell Cas, but then he has to pull out the fingers of his other hand from his mouth and he didn’t even notice when he started sucking on them.
, and they get rewards. You? You don’t get anything, I swear to god. Always such a fucking disappointment.”
“Why don’t you tell me about it?” Cas says, crossing his legs and folding his hands into his lap, entirely unaffected.
“No! I know we’ve got health insurance, but that’s just asking for trouble and the insurance kind of sucks.”
Cas pets his forehead, fingers gentle against Dean’s ear. “See, I have this theory. It goes like this: You’re a dirty boy. You’re going to piss yourself, right here, in the kitchen, and then I’m going to use you while you’re covered in your own piss and filth - and you’re going to love it.”
got to -” Dean starts heatedly, but then he pauses and takes a deliberate breath. “I said I don’t want to talk about it.”
How long they sit there he can’t say. His ass has long since gone numb, his left leg is pure agony from Cas’s weight and he doesn’t care. Cas’s shaking subsides slowly, but his hands have curled, gripping Dean’s naked skin tight.
“I needed to find you. There might be a way to still fix this.” He glances down the empty street quickly. “Why are you here?”
Something starts to warm in Dean’s chest with those words. A possessive part of him loves the fact that Castiel will be wearing
“I mean it,” he says a bit harsher, narrowing his eyes down at Dean. “You’ve been pretty useless since you two split. Now we know you haven’t been unfaithful, but now we got proof to put all doubt to rest. I expect you and your man to take those three days and work your shit out. I expect you back in the office Tuesday, at five am, with a clear head. Now get the hell outta my office and don’t come back till you can get your damn head outta your ass!”
“Technically what Benny did isn’t anything that isn’t done every day,” Sam says with a sigh as he leans back against the chair. Dean opens his mouth to comment on his brother siding with the whole fuckery of the system, but Sam just holds up a hand to him. “Just hear me out, okay?”
Sometime later, when his breaths are just shaky aftershocks of the mess he was in the kitchen, Castiel is trying to figure out when Charlie moved him to the couch. He lays there, groggily trying to keep his eyes open as Charlie continuously runs her fingers through his hair, humming a tune he thinks he might recognize if he were sober enough.
Holding up the syringe he pushes the plunger just enough to make sure there’s no air or bubbles. Castiel walks back to the closed door, only then realizing the voices have stopped.
burn and carve into Castiel’s skin while he screamed for Dean to help him will always haunt him, both when he’s awake and when he’s allowed to close his eyes to sleep.
Dean can’t help it. Even if he already knows what the answer is going to be, he blurts out the question. “Did the kid make it?”
It’s not like in the movies where time stands still, or even partially slows with some important narrative. No, everything moves the same.
How many times have they been down this road where just having a little bit of patience and more facts could’ve saved time and lives? Maybe he might be a little bit upset that neither Sam or Dean came to him for any thought on the matter. But then again, why would they? He’s nothing more than a burden to them now. He’s the reason they have to endanger themselves this time. The thought has Castiel’s stomach dropping. If anything happens it’s on him.
Stories about him have passed down from their parents, to their children, to their children’s children. They speak of him like some sort of warrior that lost his heart. The immortal man that doesn’t need sleep, feels no hunger or any thirst. They speak in hushed voices about how his body carries no scars, and his wounds heal far too quickly. They whisper that he’s a cursed human man, unable to die, left to wander the world alone for some unforgivable sin he committed. It’s unnatural – inhuman – yet he is still made up of nothing but flesh and bone. He's nothing like those monsters he hunts that walk down the streets, searching for their next victim.
“You’re not wrong,” Sam says. “I think the virus helped speed up the process, honestly. We were just kinda coasting there for awhile. Life was kinda what it was with the general human population. Murder, death, rape, what-have-you. But it was just expected, you know? Like we were all so numb to the bad happening that nothing really shocked us. Nothing was getting better, but nothing was really getting worse.” Dean sees Sam shrug out of the corner of his eye before focusing on the phone again. “The media liked to scare us occasionally. Different headlines hinting to war, increasing prices in hopes to cause a panic, or sometimes even something dramatic as a loose killer. Still, it didn’t really scare any of us into changing our every day routine. No one was out there panicking. No one fell in line to stop anything. Murderers didn’t just stop killing because police officers pay increased, or new types of weapons came out. Good or bad, the world kept on spinning as it always did, and we just kept on going through the motions.”
“I-I-” Dean manages to get out, shakily. Fuck, Castiel sounds pissed. Honestly he just forgot about the shirt until now. It was probably his alpha’s favorite shirt. Leave it to him to mess up again. Stupid omega, can’t even do his own subgender right. Maybe he can just drive back and ask Sam to get into the ward and get the shirt. They don’t get rid of stuff like that, do they?
“I need to see you. Can I see you? I need – fuck – I have to see you, please Dean,” Castiel’s breath comes out in pants and Dean’s hazed filled mind wonders what it would feel like with the alpha’s body over him, his deep voice vibrating against his skin as he says his name over and over again while pumping him full of –
“I don’t give two shits what you read on the guy, or what the guy did because he felt guilty about what might happen to someone he just spent a few days rolling around in bed with,” Dean growls back.
The sound has Dean stumbling back away from Sammy, blinking like he’s coming out of some sort of fog. Was he really just going to fight his own brother? Sammy sneezes again and scrunches up his nose, looking back at Dean before walking back to his desk and grabbing a Kleenex.
“Dean, I don’t know if I can,” Cas squeezes his eyes shut tightly, face screwed up in concentration. Slowly they open again, a little of the blue has returned. “If I wait any longer to leave I might not be able to. Please, you have to tell me what you want me to do. I don’t want to hurt you.”
“I was always going to give it back.” Crowley sticks his hands in his jacket pocket and sighs. “But I do believe I might’ve found another way ‘round this whole situation.”
That’s enough to get him to look at him again, eyes losing their glare and softening back into their caring little brother look. “You’re right.” He says stepping back and running a hand through his hair. “It’s just – you know what? Let’s just…” He motions for Dean to sit down again. “I’m going to check your neck. See if there’s any swelling.”
By week two, the case is solved and Charlie (somewhat reluctantly) lets Dean go out to the bar to celebrate with his coworkers. As much as Dean wants to ask everyone what happened that night he lost Cas, he doesn’t want to bring down the mood. He sticks to beer, avoiding any hard liquor, and puts on a smile for his friends. Towards the end of the night a girl that’s been eyeing him from across the bar approaches, asking him to come home with her.
His eyes follow Dean as he walks off to the side of him, slowly circling. His fingers go back to picking at the teeth of the Blade with his fingernails, looking bored with the whole thing. Castiel knows it’s just an act, trying to lower his defenses so the thinks he’s safe. Castiel watches Dean’s body language, making sure he isn’t about ready to react.
Cas snorts. “I’m just a police officer, Dean. Nothing more, nothing less. The government may have orchestrated my move, but they don’t control me. I don’t answer to them. They aren’t the ones signing my checks. Other than being told my ‘skill set’ needs to be in a more ‘accessible location’ and taking me away from my family and friends without a choice, I haven’t had any contact with them.”
The drive back to his apartment is usually where he starts to disassociate. But with his body being overstimulated from the lifespan gained, and ending up having to stab the girl in not such a fun way, he’s a little lost in how to feel. The best he can figure is an uncomfortable restlessness. By the time he parks and starts the climb to the fourth floor his apartment, Dean’s beyond frustrated. Every time he reaches a floor he glares at the elevator that remains out of order for the second month in a row.
Dean clears his throat which makes Castiel glance back up at him. His cheeks look a little flushed, and he’s glancing down at the table just like he was.
Dean glares at him, feeling like he’s being tested somehow. No matter how he answers he knows that somehow Cain already knows the answer. That alone has alarms going off in Dean’s head. He wonders why it’s taken this long to get any kind of read on the guy. No one is that good.
The flat tone coming from the other end makes Dean flinch, and he can’t help ducking his head in submission on reflex. He’s disappointed his alpha. As much as Dean wants to deny every single fiber of omega in him, he can’t pretend what is going on with his body at this very moment. He let his alpha down. He wasn’t good enough.
At first he feels a bit of pressure; almost like his mind is stuck in a balloon and someone is trying to pop it. Focusing on that peaceful nothingness, Dean tries to mentally push the intrusion away.
No matter how much he hates how worried Sam sounds, the last thing he wants to do right now is relive that nightmare. He’s never been down that road with Sam and like hell he is starting now.
Unable to say anything more he just stares back at him, letting himself get caught up in Castiel’s eyes. Dean brings a shaky hand up and grips his alpha’s uniform like a lifeline.
He lets his eyes slipped closed as hangs his head. He hears the springs of the mattress groan as Sam sits down from the bed across from him. The quiet ringing tone from the cellphone sounds a lot louder than what it probably is in the tense motel room. After a few rings Dean’s voicemail picks up and Sam cuts the call off with a sigh.
“Fire Gordon? Charges? Court?” His heart rate jumps back up hearing more of the unclear story. Castiel pushes heavier on the gas, blocking off anyone else’s attempts to merge into his lane. He is so close to the station, just a few hundred feet from turning into the parking lot. “Charlie, please, Is Dean okay? What happened?”
Dean shakes a couple of bottles on the counter, scowling at them when he realizes they’re empty. He turns, eyeing a capped bottle of whiskey that looks like there’s at least a good quarter left in the bottle. Perfect, that’s a good start. But he’s pretty sure he bought two of them last night. Now where did he put the other –
Looking away from him again, Castiel sighs and leans his head back against the headboard. “I breathed life back into you, helped you build that wall inside your mind to keep out those memories that were eating away at you and now…”
By the middle of the month international flights were canceled. California and New York reported their first cases. Over the next three days upwards of seventy people had become infected, twenty of them were on ventilators. By the end of the following week California passed a new order forcing businesses to shut down and people to stay at home. New York followed suit. Across the ocean, the death tolls were well past the thousands and many more infected.
Sam keeps looking at him like he’s expecting something. More hate filled words, maybe, he’s not sure. But all Dean can do is rub that spot on his chest while he tries to fight back the growing emotions he wants to keep locked up until his brother is out of apartment. He’s cried enough in front of Sam to last a lifetime, and pulling out the hormone card isn’t something he can get away with this time.
Dean’s body responds on autopilot, reaching out and grabbing Castiel underneath his arms lifting him up off the ruined bed. Together they managed to maneuver out the motel doorway without knocking into anything. Dean watches Castiel’s loll back and forth as they walk the short distance to the Impala and carefully, as gently as they can, place him in the backseat. Dean notices his tan trench coat balled up on the floor next to his regular suit attire. He quickly picks it up, lifting Castiel’s head enough to place the coat underneath it, hoping it might offer some sort of comfort.
“Oh, these bodies?” He asks, not breaking his stare. “Just cleaning up a mess I made a long time ago.”
Sighing, Dean takes out his phone and pulls up Cas’ number. Chewing on his lip, he debates sending the guy a message asking what he’s doing tonight. He knows he just got back from Argentina last week, so he’s probably all time-zoned back to where he should be, right? At least, he said he was feeling fine when they texted last night.
Castiel turns to the sound of something heavy falling to the floor and sees Crowley standing beside a metal chair with something suspiciously looking like dried blood splattered over it and a large piece of plywood. He pushes himself up off the ground, ignoring the pain shooting through his body like fire.
Dean, thankfully, takes a few steps back away from Sam, eyes focused on the ground. Sam pushes himself off the hood, glaring heatedly at his brother. Not wanting anything else to escalate between the two of them, Castiel places himself in between the two of them, looking back at Sam.
“Oh, come off it Castiel,” Crowley says rolling his eyes and leans forward. “What did you think was going to happen? You pop in and expect him to see you juiced up and come running into your open arms? I thought you were smarted than that.”
That doesn’t make any sense. Why would he do that? Castiel left him. His alpha didn’t want him. Was hearing about him dying not enough? Did the guy have some sort of sick kink that needed to see the omegas he claimed die from his rejection?
The light clicks off and then he hears Sam huff out a breath, moving around on the bed trying to get comfortable. Castiel never replies. Dean glances away from the chipping ceiling and over to the bed where Castiel is sitting up staring back at him. The bruises over his face have darkened and purpled even more since Dean dropped them off, and he swallows thickly trying to think of something intelligible to say. Cas’ face is twisted into something of disgust and confusion, but when Dean licks his lips before opening his mouth to try his luck with words, Dean notices Castiel’s body going rigid before he narrows his eyes.
Dean looks up at Sam who almost looks exactly like that twelve year old kid on Christmas morning when he woke up and discovered presents wrapped under the tree for the first time since their mother was alive. “So you’re telling me while I got a fricken tube shoved down my throat my body was just, what, reconfiguring itself?”
Either Cas is looking at him, or they happened to turn at the same time, but now they’re nose to nose, just a breath away from their lips touching and Dean’s mind has chosen this exact moment to stop working. He’s caught in the summer blue color of Castiel’s eyes focused in on his own. Drops of mist have caught themselves on his eyelashes, somehow making the color of his eyes even more vibrant. Transfixed on them, unable to break his stare, Dean finds himself leaning forward into him, pushing their bodies together so their chests are flushed.
Looking up he catches his brothers eyes and steadily keeps his gaze. “I ain’t stopping. If telling you what happened to me can help you save one omega, then this whole thing is worth it.”
the enemy. Even though by looks alone it seems to add up that way, the thought still makes Dean’s blood start to race. As if Cas can sense what he’s thinking, his eyes narrow before flicking down to the blade in his hand.
“But I still don’t get it,” Dean says. “Why this? I get having to pretend it’s a virus to get what they want or whatever, but why infect all of us with
After a week of trying to keep busy, he started checking his phone more often throughout the day. Even more than when he and Dean were actually on speaking terms. It became the so noticeable a few of his colleagues had approached him asking if something was wrong. He started leaving his phone in his car after that. Nobody ever called him besides Dean, anyway.
His lashes wet, Dean looks up at Cas, trying to show his desperation as he draws one shaky breath after another. Cas sighs, irritated, then jerks Dean forward by his ears.
He’s going to object to this, but not until he’s able to sit down comfortably again. To say his ass has been bruised, would be lying. It’s blueblackpurple, a mess of bruises and a few superficial cuts from the cane. Cas can’t keep his hands off of him, which is pretty fucking great actually.
“I love you,” he says, choked up. “I love you. I can’t stand the idea of something happening to you.”
“What I wanted today,” Cas says icily, “was to come home to my good boy. Order food, watch a movie together on the couch, maybe have him suck my cock to the credits. Did I get that, Dean?”
“Please sir,” Dean gasps, pushing against that finger. “Please sir, I really need some lube so I can open my fuck hole for you, sir, please. I’ll open it so good, make it really wet so that you can fuck it anyway you want, do anything you want to it.”
And thus, dear friends, we've come to the end. Our kinky-af-husbands are driving home, safe and sound, and will continue to screw in all manner of perverted ways. I hope you've enjoyed this ride, because I can tell you that from here, it's been one hell of a ride for sure. I never expected to write nearly 50 000 words in 18 days, but I did, and here it is.
Dean sucks in a deep breath and pushes on. “She kept calling, you kept walking out of the room when she did, and I thought,
“I was going to be nice,” Cas says, hauling him over to the tap, then pinning him down with a foot on his neck. “Do you know what nice boys say? They say
The day Dean realises he’s hopelessly in love with Cas happens not even three weeks after Cas had joined him at Bobby’s. Cas had texted him,
It takes Cas exactly a second to come crashing down next to him, another fifteen before the ropes have been deftly cut through and Dean’s cradled in Cas’s lap, shaking.
Sam huffs and makes a face. They watch the sun rise over the lake, birds singing in the trees. When Dean’s coffee runs out, he claps Sam’s shoulder, then goes back to his bed and his husband.
” He sighs and runs a hand through his hair, “If I got to decide, I’d shout it from the fucking rooftops, man. At work though, I gotta keep my head down. There’s too much riding on me having that job, Cas
Oh god, how many inches could that possibly be? Cas said halfway, so maybe another book after this? Two? He can’t think, it’s so massive and he’s heaving to make up for all the oxygen Castiel stole. He can feel Castiel wipe his thumbs across Dean’s cheekbones, and when he opens his eyes again, Castiel is in front of him with that patient look, kissing away tears that Dean had forgotten were streaming down his face. He can’t stop them. He nudges his head toward Castiel, craving that contact. He’ll willingly throw himself off any cliff, if only Castiel will keep looking at him like this, warm and loving and happy.
Dean reaches for him, tucking himself up against Cas side. Cas’ all careful, and slightly tense and that’s not good.
For just a moment Dean closed his eyes against the burning somewhere in his chest, forcing away how Castiel's tone settled like ice inside him. He drew a deep breath and let it out slowly, then turned to the door. Upstairs. Bedroom. Undress. Do not walk out the front door, do not throw things, do not shout, do not pass go. He’d almost made it to the door, when Cas quietly called his name behind him and he paused, but didn’t turn around again.
The website had looked good, so had the reviews online, but when they arrive, Dean can’t seem to relax his spine. Cas explains their history while the therapist smiles smarmily at them. Dean wants to punch him.
“You could have swerved off the road!” Cas goes on shouting. “You could have hit someone else! You could have hit the brakes too late and gone straight into the back of a truck, and I would have had to bury you!”
Tops and doms aren't all seeing, all knowing. Cas is acting as much on instinct here as Dean is. *shruggy shoulders*
Dean closes his eyes and leans back, still breathless, lungs burning, and tries. Goddamn him, he tries to relax, and then Castiel lets his nose go and the breath he’s been holding explodes out even as he tries to draw a new one, the world swimming around him. He’s barely aware that Castiel is nudging yet another set of books away from beneath him, but he definitely notices when the dildo slides even further up inside him.
Tears are streaming down Cas cheeks and Dean gets up, but the shards of ceramic stop him. He turns to go for the dustpan, but Cas stops him, angrily wiping a hand over his face.
“Greedy boys,” Dean mutters, and he’s completely hard now, cock straining even as Dean rocks back and forth a little on his heels.
Now Dean’s breathless for entirely different reasons, and he nods dumbly, shuffling aside when Cas nudges him.
Cas huffs silently. “So desperate,” he murmurs. “Like a bitch in heat. Really, boy, I’ve never met anyone as cockhungry.”
“I’m never letting you go, boy,” Cas says firmly. “You’ve given yourself to me; you’re mine now, just like my car or this couch.” Dean shudders. “I take care of what’s mine, so I’ll take care of you too.”
Cas is above him, fucking into him with the kind of long, deep thrusts that make Dean gasp and shudder. They’re pressed close, and the friction of Cas’s sweat slick stomach against Dean’s cock is amazing, almost better than the hand pinning his wrists above his head. Cas’s other hand smoothes over Dean’s jaw, tilts his head, and oh, God, that hand over his neck feels so, so good.
Then Cas goes on a business trip, some stupid conference for bank tellers because that’s apparently a thing that exists? What the actual fuck. Whatever. Dean’s not upset. Of course he can do a weekend without Cas. He’s done it before. He’s an adult, capable of his own goddamn choices.
He’s an fully grown man, all six foot tall and used to lugging heavy equipment. He’s reasonably in shape, he could push up and get off easily. It’s humiliating and out of all people in the world, this is not what he wants to show Crowley.
“Yeah,” Dean breathes against Cas’s collarbone, rubs his nose there and kisses Cas’s sweaty skin. “Cause I hate it, but I really love hating it. I love giving into it, I love having you make me, I love having you force me to love it. I love knowing that after all of it, you’ll pick me up and put me back together again. You’ll kiss me and hold me, and love me, and I know you see me. You see that entire messy darkness, and it don’t scare you.”
“Benny fired me,” Dean says flatly, doing his best to keep his emotions separated from then to now. It’s over. It already happened. He’s safe. “Over being an omega. I think. He said something about how much time I’d been taking off lately, then…” Squeezing his eyes closed tightly he tries to rack his brain trying to remember. “I think I hit him first? Yeah, I hit him first.” As he says the words the whole scene starts to clear in his mind. He can see himself swinging at Benny, and then he sees himself do it again.
Resigns to the fact that he might not actually get out of this office unless he agrees. “Fine. What is it?”
“You will not speak of him like that again.” His gravelly voice dips deeper as the very air around them seems to buzz with power. “Or I guarantee the breath to take uttering that word will be your last.”
As Dean opens his eyes, full put together memories flood his mind like a dam breaking open. Memories of Castiel coming over to take care of him after bad nights with Benny, memories of just the two of them just hanging out when Benny messaged saying that he would be late coming home, memories of Castiel telling him he’s worth so much more, memories of Castiel talking to him, building him up a person, for two years before he got the strength to leave Benny. Memories of falling in love with Castiel more and more each day, just never realizing it until nearly a year after he left Benny.
. My brother.” He sighs and runs a hand through his hair, looking at the ceiling. “I get it. Everything has been a shit show over these past few months. Trust me, I was there. It’s been hell.” Sam’s hazel eyes look back down at him almost pleading. Castiel feels his body involuntarily twitch at the mention of the past months. “But we finally have a chance here, Cas. I’m not justifying anything that Crowley has done, because what happened to you was…” Sam shakes his head and casting a glare at Crowley. “But if you could put your issues aside for more than a few seconds and look at the bigger picture you’d see we need this bastard to help save Dean.”
Dean’s eyes widen in realization. Cain is the creator of every last knight and he turned on his own army. He killed then all and doesn’t even seem phased by it. “I –”
“I’ve done horrible things; centuries of awful, dark, unmentionable things. I created more Knights, trained them to be the most evil, ruthless creatures the world has ever known…” Cain turns back to the picture on the mantle. Dean follows his gaze. It rests on an old black and white photo of a woman.
“Fuck,” Dean says sitting up and leaning over the steering wheel like it might actually help anything. “I can’t fucking see shit anymore. We’re going to have to find some place to pull over.”
Castiel mumbles something against his neck followed by that low growl that makes Dean’s body shudder. The alpha thrusts faster and harder and all Dean can do is tighten his hold onto him, feeling the heat building and building up inside him. Castiel licks a stripe over his scent gland that has Dean moaning out his name, almost like plea for the alpha to let him come.
Dean feels the pressure of Castiel’s eyes and glances up at him. The alpha is squinting down at him, face completely blank otherwise. Dean subtly scents the air, but doesn’t pick up on anything other than a hint of honeyed green tea and wet forest earth. There’s something calming their scents mingling together that stills something in him. He hates that he loves it.
Dean bucks up his hips, knocking Castiel out of his own head. He feels sweat beading up on his own forehead as he fights to keep Dean’s body pinned. The more he pulls his grace for more strength, he harder he finds himself breathing. Now that he’s reached out for his grace inside Dean, he feels it screaming for him. Castiel forces more of his weight down, trying to keep Dean from getting out of his hold. Desperately he tries to think of another way besides the two options; Either giving in and letting Dean finish him, or trying to smite Dean himself.
He is the reason Dean is breaking apart. He is the reason why the brothers relationship is strained. He is the reason Dean is hurting.
“I always thought that if or when this day came I would have more time to prepare with roses or something,” Dean says as Cas lets his hand slip into Dean’s.
Dean places his menu down, glaring back at his brother. “Nothing’s changed in the last forty-five minutes! He hasn’t said shit to me about anything, and I’m not going to start railing him with questions when he just fucking exhausted! The guy can barely make it across the damn room without looking like he’s about ready to fall over. Obliviously I don’t have some magical cure up my sleeve to make anything better, so unless you’ve been holding out and that’s why you’re on my ass, then I suggest you talk it over with him!”
As he stands there in front of his angel, staring back into those blue eyes (the ones that Dean has sworn he’s only ever seen that color one other time before that was when the world was created. He swears God himself pulled and created all different forms and shades from this, Castiel’s blue) Dean realizes he would gladly let those hellhounds drag him back down to Hell if it meant spending just a few more years with his angel.
“It’s crap,” he whispers, half surprised something that honest comes out. “Everything’s just kinda crap, you know?”
Dean’s eyes lock with his in the review mirror as Castiel hears the familiar click-click of the turn signal come on. It’s too much. He grabs his head as a scream rips itself from his throat. There is so much pain. He feels everything.
Castiel tries to stroke them both through their aftershocks, but his body feels slugish and weak, and the thought of falling on top of Dean, squishing their fluids between them isn’t appealing at the moment. Falling over to the side, he lays there trying to catch his breath while rubbing his hand covered in their spunk on his pants still only pulled down to his thighs. He huffs out a laugh at the sight before flopping his head back, listening to Dean breathing heavily beside him.
“Sammy.” The name comes out like glass scraping against his throat. Still his brother’s face practically beams at him before Dean gets an armful of him.
Castiel is almost one hundred percent certain Dean spreads his legs wider, tipping his head back against the pillows as he gives himself a firmer grip, quickening his strokes before moaning in such a way it would be porn stars to shame. Cas swears under his breath, pressing against his throbbing cock still trapped inside his boxers.
be affected by being omega. Sam had left him a voicemail apologizing but he couldn’t get him any more blockers and he’d explain over dinner. By the time Sammy got to the diner just down the road from the garage, Dean was starting to get some curious looks from some of the patrons.
Dean snorts. That’s the biggest understatement he’s ever heard. But maybe that’s because he comes from a time where the world wasn’t in ruins and the smoke from fires didn’t blot out the sun. Squinting up through the smoke, he stares at the red sun briefly letting himself wonder when the last time he saw the blue of the sky.
The sound of sirens come closer, and with them bright LED lights that make him squint and turn his head. Before Dean can really process what’s about to happen, or think to mention to Castiel what he figured out, there is just a blur of uniformed people everywhere. Colors from the emergency vehicle lights and noises from everyone rushing around has Dean jumping and twitching at the littlest of things.
Slowly, almost hyper aware on what he’s doing, Cas starts his car, connecting his phone to the Bluetooth. “Are you home? Where am I going?”
Cain gestures to the house before walking past them towards it, leaving Crowley staring after him like he’s going to be sick. Dean narrows his eyes at the retreating man. He doesn’t know what he might have been expecting from from Cain but it sure wasn’t being invited into his damn house. Still, there isn’t really anything else to do but accept the invitation. The last thing he wants to do is piss the Father of Murder.
“You better go,” he said, gently grabbing Dean’s little wrists and giving them a soft squeeze before standing up and letting them fall down to his sides.
“You two gunna need a moment to sit here makin’ eyes at each other,” Bobby grumbles without any real heat. “Or can we explain this so I can get outta here ‘fore Ellen comes in here huntin’ me down for bein’ late.”
With a growl, Dean slams down a wrench on the table and spins around. “What the fuck is your problem? Seriously?”
He’s either too broken for the bond to set, or his brother must have finally figured out some miracle cure. Either way, it doesn’t matter. Anger starts rising. A part of him is angry his brother actually saved him. He doesn’t deserved to be saved. He doesn’t want to be saved. Being here – being alive – just means that he’ll have to live with this fucking hole in his chest and a scar on his neck showing the world of how truly broken he is. It’s one thing to live in this world being something every alpha wants to claim, but now they’ll all know that he’s disposable and able to be discarded easily.
Narrowing his eyes as Dean takes the outstretched phone, bringing it to ear and murmurs his presence, Castiel’s chest tightens again. He watches as Dean’s body instantly goes stiff, and on impulse takes a step forward. Sam’s hand grips his shoulder firm enough it stops. He whips around, shaking the hand away, mouth open to question why, but Sam just mouths the word “no”, shaking his head looking as frustrated as he feels. Castiel turns back to Dean in confusion, feeling like he’s missing a piece and the other two brothers know where it is. Dean stands there, eyes closed tightly, his face holding nothing but anger as he grips the phone so tightly Castiel wonders how it isn’t broken.
“Listen, if you don’t want to do this, I totally get it,” Dean smirks to himself, enjoying the knowledge that he can hook guys as easily as he can the ladies. Or at least this one guy. “Just tell me ‘no’ and I can have Sam let you know when he finds a way to break out bond.”
Dean runs a hand down his face. All this information is exhausting. He’s not even sure how he’s mentally taking anything else in. “God you make it sound like we’re all some sort of damn science experiment.”
Without even trying, amusement seeps through their bond. Dean seems to almost be poking purposefully at his grace, which only irritates Castiel. He knows that the demon part of Dean is only using it as bait to draw him out, but something about the demon’s evil touching something that is apart of him makes his hand begin to tingle wither energy. It’s almost as if he’s purposely trying to corrupt something so pure as Dean’s soul, making it completely dark. Castiel grinds his teeth together in anger, tightening his hold on his blade.
Dean opens his mouth, wanting to warn Castiel that he shouldn’t be here – Alastair can’t know who he is. If he knows, then he’ll find him. He’ll find him because Castiel’s scent is on him. He’ll know that the other alpha’s scent is his, and he’ll never stop until he hunts him down. He’ll never stop until —
He unbuttons Dean’s jeans, shoving them and his underwear down around his knees. That’s likely uncomfortable and probably slightly embarrassing, not their thing really, but he needs to surprise Dean. Dean’s not asking for nice, or their agreement, he’s asking to be
“And trust me,” he raises his voice when Dean tries to speak, “I have been very, very happy with what we’ve done. I don’t have words for how much you’ve given me, the way you give and give and give, but Dean, I haven’t held up my side of it. My job here is to make you feel safe, is to make sure you can talk to me about everything. Even when I make you feel bad, I want to make you feel
Dean moans and stares out at the Fourth of July celebrations, where normal people drink and hug and watch fireworks. He closes his eyes. It’s not for him. He’s a good pet, a good fucktoy, being used just like he should.
Cas catches him with the small Snickers bar Dean snuck into the cart, but didn’t manage to stop the cashier from sending off with the rest of the groceries. Dean pays, as Cas stares straight at him, eyes cold. Dean drives home, they unpack the groceries, then Cas spins him over the kitchen counter and smashes his face into it.
Dean whines, but doesn’t stop the slow, dirty grind against the sheet. His cock is fully hard now, trapped inside his boxers, and he can’t quite get a good angle.
Dean strips, sits in the chair, scoots forward when Cas kneels between his legs and fits the electric ballweight between his legs. Then Cas hands him the remote.
Cas laughter vibrates through him, but all Cas does is go back to the kitten licks, teasing at Dean’s rim. Dean groans in frustration, burying his face back in the pillow beneath him. He knows Cas is on his own schedule here, but come on. He needs it. Needs more than soft, gentle, wet-warm pats and flicks form Cas’s tongue, needs more than hot breath and stubble over his bruises.
Dean shakes himself out of his stupor, stripping quickly and stepping in between Cas’s legs. The hand on his balls makes him jerk, but Cas only closes his fist tight around them, a proprietary squeeze that makes Dean swallow with a click.
