“Don’t worry about it. It’s like the dreams of your past, the ones bound by memory. Those are the ones shared. I read up on the dreaming stuff because Lord, help me I do not want Natasha to know some of the dreams I’ve had. I don’t know why it’s the memory ones but it might have to do with how grounded they are.” He chewed and then added, “You know, I think you’re going to have to do something about your pack.”
Steve ended up in the lavish hotel room with its tall columns and marble tiled bathroom. Once he sat on the bed and Tony left him, Steve slumped down and fell to stare at the ceiling. Most of the time he managed his dissociation – managed might be a strong word for it. He admitted to himself it was more like ignoring it, pushing himself, keeping busy so he wouldn’t have to face the fact that his whole world changed in a blink of an eye. Sometimes only those moments before he crashed the Valkyrie into the ocean were real to him.  He laid on the bed and closed his eyes, remembering those moments of
“Rhodes.” Tony raises his hand to give Rhodey a light squeeze. “Thank you, for not giving up on me.” He chokes up a little. He thought he was all alone in space, but his friends didn’t give up on searching for him. Never even once.
“Tony……” Steve sounds so full of sadness, and Tony hates that. He doesn’t want to think about Steve actually caring. It makes him happy to think that he matters to Steve, but he is also simultaneously angered by it. It reminds him of how Steve chose to let go of it all despite what they were to each other.
Tony stands up from where he is seated and takes the camera in his hand. He is walking to another part of his room. “Alright, so who knew Captain America draws in his free time? Well, it’s probably in the history book somewhere. But come on, you have got to see this.” The moment the camera focuses on the object of Tony’s interest, Steve can feel heat blooming on his face instantly.
“I was going to wear a blue one to match your color theme. We will do that next time.” Tony hums, evidently in a good mood after seeing Steve in that suit. “Are you coming back to New York after this? You are free to enjoy the five star hotel they booked for you, you know. Pamper yourself for a few days. I heard that they have an amazing spa.”
“Hey boss.” Happy gives him a wide grin and a shaky hug. “I had someone tidy up your office for you as soon as I heard you are back.”
The media runs endless rounds of tribute on Iron Man, despite all the mistakes he had made in the past. His sins are buried by the past. People call him a hero, for all the sacrifices he made. Tony doesn’t think that about himself, because he knows better than anyone he is only human just like everyone else, a broken one at that.
“Glad I have the appeal. You are the one that is good at this kind of stuff, Tony. I don’t like dealing with the press.”
“Oh Tony, thank god you are alive……I was so worried……I thought we lost you……” She cries onto his shoulder. He can tell she is trying her best to control her sobs, but she is far too relieved to guard her emotions for any longer.
The audience gasps at the sight of the painting, which only makes Steve’s face turn even redder. “Now, I would say that is impressive. Cap made me that, he did, so I would say we have never been better before. And no, this is not for sell.” The billionaire walks towards the camera with a proud grin. “I am afraid this is all we have time for today, duty calls. Captain, it’s all yours.”
Tony was either going to laugh at him or throw up on Agent…Agent, whatever, his mind blanked, and it was a real toss up for a few seconds, but what he managed to husk out was a sharp, brittle, hacking sound and not the few bits of toast he’d had for breakfast, so, small favors there.  Keep an open mind.  Yeah.  He’d just…do that.  It was always possible this wouldn’t end with him on his knees getting split open by an Alpha he didn’t want.  Maybe they’d just do the crossword.  He could do it in pen.  Surely, that would be enough for Rogers.  See?  His mind was so fucking open, it was practically a 7/11.
“I’d just like to look at you,” Tony said quietly, the words seeming to startle him even as he spoke.  But he swallowed whatever else he was going to say and looked up at Steve with an expression unlike anything Steve had seen the man wear all evening.
“I don’t want to hurt him, James. That’s why I keep trying to tell him—“ Steve broke off, catching Tony’s eye before looking towards his own apartment door.  “Why I keep trying to tell him this isn’t a good idea,” Steve finished with a sigh.
“Ah, Steve, this--this is Jarvis.  Edwin Jarvis.  He’s my—was my, well, my parents’ butler, really, but, ah.  Jarvis.  Jarvis, this is Captain Steve Rogers, my Alpha,” Tony said with as much formality as he could muster.
Why should he be embarrassed or ashamed because of what those Omegas said?  He shouldn’t, he knew.  They didn’t know. They didn’t know that Steve didn’t want him.  They weren’t mocking him. Well, not for that, anyway.  In his head, he knew that wasn’t what Whitney had been insinuating, but he couldn’t force the idea that they knew something wasn’t right out of his head.
“That’s…pretty far off course, Turkey to Afganistan,” Steve replied, a furrow forming between his brows.
“Oh, God, don’t do that,” Steve smiled, really smiled, the kind that crinkled his eyes and made his face go soft and lax.  “He’ll show them to you, and that’ll be your afternoon gone.  Trust me.  Just don’t.”
“Hey.  Brought you some dinner.  From that little café you like so much?  I know you like it because you hover above it every lunch hour,” Steve said, raising his eyebrows and grinning slightly.  “I think the waitress there firmly believes I’m stalking you, by the way, though there is this nice older gentleman who keeps telling me he thinks I stand a chance.”
“When you fuck me?  Yes, Steve.  I like that.  Literally everyone knows I like that, and you know why I know that everyone knows I like that?” Tony demanded.
, Tony would be curious.  Tony was brilliant and curious about all manner of things. It didn’t mean anything, Steve told himself firmly, picking the words for his answer carefully.
“Well,” Tony said after a moment, his mouth twisting into a wry grimace.  “Not like there isn’t a lot of room to go up from there.”
Tony tries not to be devastated. It’s hard to not fall into the pit that has swirled around him, threatening for years. He built walls, fortified them to contain the terror. The walls deny the reality, he knows that – he’s a genius after all. But the truth is that he needed those walls, those bricks to deny the unbelievers. How else could he rally his damaged soul to continue? For Fuck’s sake, he was only 17 at the time. Broken, alone, orphaned. What the hell else could he do. On top of that his father figure, Stane, tried to steal his company out from under him while he suffered from a traumatic brain injury.
This time he feels like the world around him brightens and the elixir runs through him strengthening him and empowering him. When he’s done, he lifts his head and glimpses a kind of wistful pain in Steven’s eyes – as if he’s hoping and wishing for something – someone else.
“You have the information you need. You’re wrong about me, I do share. I’m nice like that,” Fury says and scowls at him. “This is as much about you as it is about Stark, Steven, get that into your head. You fail at this it isn’t that you’re going to be a fallen angel, but you’re going to fall farther and deeper than any other angel since before the time of Lucifer and his legion.”
“You’ll have to be careful when you pick him up not to dislodge anything,” Cho remarks and she has a tablet in her one hand and a stylus in the other. “We should be ready in a few minutes. Can you place Captain Rogers in the cradle?”
His smile is strong and alluring when he turns to Tony. "Nice you could make it, darling. You look beat. How about a nice massage?" He sidles right up to Tony, his breath hot against Tony’s neck. “Let’s go inside. See what I can do for you, take away all the stress.”
He swallows down the ache and shakes his head. “Yes, no, not really. I don’t -.” He hisses through the emotions. “I-he. He died.”
Bucky held Steve’s hand as if he never wanted to let go. “I hope there is, but you have to accept that there just might not be-.”
“Yeah. I asked them not to do that. I’ll talk to them again.” Tony yawns. “I’m going to try and sleep.” He lays the book aside and closes his eyes. “No worries about the lights. I’m okay.”
“Really?” Her smile made it all worth it. That and the idea that he didn’t have to face the stupid team that would probably become a soul pack without him.  Pepper’s smile reminded him of the sun over the Pacific as it set, her hair like the melting of the sun into the water’s horizon. Everything was better with Pepper. Why did he always have to try and undermine his own happiness by looking elsewhere?
Steve eyes the impatient medics. “I packed up everything you need. You can finish your work in New York. This is just a precaution.”
Tony shifted and sat up on top of Steve. The way he moved showed not only his own comfort with his body but also with Steve’s as well. Steve envied that ease. Tony ran his hands down Steve’s chest. “Let me tell you something. Sex isn’t about what to put where, not if you want it to mean something. It isn’t about putting your leg here or your hand there, or if I want to touch you like this.” He caressed his hand along Steve’s side and down to his groin, lightly stroking his hardening erection. “It’s about what we both want. It’s about what you think feels good and what I think feels good and if we can give that to one another.”
Pepper only gave him a small worried smile. Neither of them wanted to be here. They got back into the black rented SUV and then Pepper navigated into the main yard of the fortress. Several guards stood at attention near the steps of the facility. It looked like it was popped out of an old established university and plopped here in the desolate place in the Rocky Mountains.
“I tried!” Cam said with the air of exasperation only the young could manage.  “But, they did not come to me at all.  And I waited for
Steve and Cam swapped a look, and then the boy pointed at the spread of food set out on the table in front of the fireplace.  Steve shrugged his acquiescence, and Cam bounded over to the tray.  Steve tried to eat, but his stomach was fluttering too much to have an appetite.  He found himself constantly looking towards the door, waiting for Tony to arrive, though the time dragged on with no sign of the King.
Tony only looked back three times that Steve caught.  Steve shook his head and leaned over the edge of the craps table.  He placed his bet on the Pass line and picked two dice out of the dice boat the stickman offered and shook them in his fist while Stane watched.  His come out roll was a seven, earning him a round of applause.
“I didn’t say it was wrong,” Steve corrected quickly, though Tony caught the slight change in the words parroted back to him.  Steve’s eyes were darting around the room, refusing to land on anything, looking for all the world like he would choose to spend the evening in a walk-in fridge rather than have this conversation.  Tony recognized panic when he saw it.  Fuck.  “I didn’t say that.  I would never judge you for…for that.  I’m just…not that way.  I’m sorry.  I didn’t think—I mean, you said we were friends. I’m sorry if I—if you thought…” he finished, actually backing away, out of Tony’s grip, like he didn’t want Tony’s hands on him anymore, and he wasn’t going to even pretend that didn’t sting a bit.
Looking over, he saw Tony pulling things out of the trunk and setting them aside, then watched as Tony straightened and made his way towards where Steve knelt. In his hands were two objects, though what they were intended for was momentarily baffling. He remembered seeing something like them in the painted cabinet back in his room at the Harem, though these were slightly different and clearly, even more finely wrought than the ones at the harem had been.
“You are here now,” Tony said, voice flat and hard, staring at the far wall, almost like he was speaking to himself.  “Whatever…circumstances that brought you to me, you are here now, and you are safe.  No one will harm you.  You will want for nothing.”  He craned his neck to the side and looked down at Steve.  “Is it…is it these memories that cloud your mind?  I would take them from you, if I could, but all I can do is try to replace them with better ones.  Ledgers and dusty manuscripts, even, if that is what it takes,” Tony said with a wobbly half-smile, though his eyes, when he looked down upon Steve, held unspeakable tenderness.  “Perhaps, in time, other things will come to mean enough to keep those thoughts at bay.”
“It’s cute that you think that’s going to happen just because I love you,” Tony said mildly, lifting his head enough to start trailing light kisses up the column of Steve’s throat.
“If you see Calvin, ask Victor to tell him I’ll be along shortly,” Whitney called out, receiving a sort of flat smile and nod of agreement in return.
“You said I could have the garage.  That it could be mine. Well.  What, you want to talk politics some more?” Tony demanded, voice harsh and as forcefully as he dared.  “Or feel like telling me again about how your dead best friend gets more say in my life than I do?” he spat out.
“I did have a good time,” Tony insisted, twisting in his seat.  “Well, right up until, you know.  Everything happened.  But, it’s fine.  I’m fine.  It’s all…fine.  Stuff like that, it happens,” Tony said, voice going stiff and tight. “I mean, nothing happened-happened.  Not really.  I don’t know why I didn’t—“
“Ngh,” Tony choked out.  The alien circled the rim of Tony’s hole with his finger again, then slipped the long, smooth digit inside where the not-gel coated it with a warm slickness.  Pleasure zinged through Tony’s body like electricity, lighting up his nerves and making black spots dance in front of his vision. The alien started to work his finger in and out of Tony’s body in a slow, unhurried rhythm, sometimes twisting it, sometimes holding it deep inside Tony while Tony writhed ineffectually against the soft confines of the not-gel.
“It was just a rudimentary connection. With time, a more sophisticated interface could be possible,” the alien replied.  “The gel is a biological electromechanical system of billions of particles. We call it Extremis.”
Maybe it was too wonderful to contemplate, too. Two sides of the same coin. Head's, Steve didn't take the money and they'd screwed themselves out of ten years. Tails, Steve didn't take the money, and God, they could have this again, this everything. This
“I got you a bus pass!  Those are non-refundable, you know,” she protested with a laugh.  “Happy should be pleased.  He was sure you’d be mugged.”
“My soldier seems rather impressed with himself,” Tony replied, then stood and straightened himself.  “What say you, General?”
He was proud that he managed to get anything out, though his voice was shaking.  Anger, righteous and hot, coursed through him. Regret soured in his stomach like curdled milk.  Distantly, like something remembered from a dream, Steve could almost feel his cheek scraping against brick, blood rushing down his throat, someone shouting fairy at him so loudly into his ear that it seemed to ring like a bell in his head, the man’s breath hot and heavy and stinking of drink.  Bucky had knocked the guy on his ass, gotten Steve patched up back at his place so Steve’s Ma wouldn’t see the worst of it, all the while just keeping a grim silence between them that they never broke, not once, even years later.
A desperate keening welled up inside him like a silent scream, his insides going liquid and boneless as Tony’s mouth grazed over the pulse beating on his neck. His breath was warm, and his teeth--God, his teeth--Steve moaned, gripping the bedpost with one hand, his eyes catching on his reflection in the looking glass again. He looked obscene.  His skin was flushed, his eyes half-lidded, his collar pushed back from his neck while his cock tented his pants and painted a burgeoning wetness on their front.  He was damned, too, then, Steve thought to himself, closing his eyes and tipping his head back.
“I know.  I know, okay?  I screwed up,” Tony groaned wearily.  “Big time.  I just—I never thought—I mean, it’s Steve.  Why would I even think he would--But, look, can we just focus on the problem at hand?”
“I know you do,” Bucky sighed heavily. “Want it for yourself, too, though, huh?” Bucky asked, mouth twisting into a grimace. “I just—it isn’t that I don’t recognize the pattern, you know? I know where it leads, and it’s no place you want to go. Stark once told me that I needed you to hate in order to justify it to myself, and he wasn’t wrong, not about that, anyway.”
“Hmm,” Obie mused, reaching again for his drink and finishing off the last bit of gold in the bottom of the glass before setting it down on the table with a clink.  “Listen to me, Tony.  We’re a team. Do you understand?  There’s nothing we can’t do if we stick together.  Like your father and I.”
A smokey-eyed young man with cheekbones that could cut glass gazed up at Tony from the page, arms stretched lazily over his head, one bent at the elbow to allow his hand to rest invitingly against the side of his face, and back curved to highlight the thong that disappeared in a lacy v-shape.  As one does, Tony thought, stretching his arms up in mimicry.  He was rewarded with the quick popping sounds of his joints warning him he had been sitting hunched over the computer too long.  Sexy, he thought with a snort.
Tony laughed again, different this time.  Not a good laugh, Steve’s mind registered.  There was something sour underneath it, the sweet-rot of decay hiding behind a wall, but then Tony scrubbed a hand vigorously over his face and turned back to Steve, and whatever it was disappeared so quickly, Steve questioned if it had been little more than a trick of shadow.  Tony went up to his knees and pushed his breeches down his hips, then sat back down and shimmied them off, kicking them onto the floor, so he was nude, all bronze and dark browns in the firelight, cock full and hard as it curved against his hip.
“You’re kidding.  He’s kidding, right?  This is a joke?  Please say joke.  Someone jump out with the “Gotcha!” sign,” Tony pleased as Coulson threw open the car door and stepped out.  The cabin gave the concept of rustic heretofore unexplored depths, Tony thought, trying to muster some reaction that didn’t stop and start at appalled.
I’m wondering again, Tony thought with a strangely dull sort of hysteria.  I really should stop doing that.
“I can’t,” Tony announced, stopping abruptly in the middle of the lobby.  “I’m sorry.  I can’t.”  His couldn’t make his hands stop shaking, so he started snapping his fingers together, an old habit from when he seemed to have too much energy to stay still and quiet and it all wanted to escape through his mouth or hands.  Or maybe his hands were still and his body was shaking.  Hard to say.  His heart was pounding so hard against his ribs that it felt as if it could be sending reverberations throughout his body, which was both crazy and probably true.  Coulson and Steve exchanged a look that was probably disappointment, but Tony couldn’t focus on either of them long enough to care.
“It’s like you don’t know me at all,” Tony muttered, pursing his lips and raising his eyebrows at Rhodey, who rolled his eyes in reply.  “Anyway, so let’s say you have no money, but you find out this company will sell top of the line, at least by your standards, prosthetics to the public for the bargain basement price of…!” he pointed at Pepper.
“Guinness should talk to you about motivation,” Steve suggested, straightening up and taking a long look that dragged molten-hot over Tony’s skin.  He lined up the club, took a single practice stroke, then swung it back, over his shoulder, muscles moving and bunching around the perfect arc of his swing as it connected with the ball.  The ball shot high over the railing, disappearing into the sky.  Tony snapped the faceplate down and took off after it.  He caught it at just over a mile and three-quarters, as it started to fall back to earth.  When he got back to the deck, Steve was tapping the golf club against the rug, where threads had been torn out of the weave like a divot.
Steve’s hands went to his collar next, and this time, he stepped closer to Tony, undoing a button on each step.  Tony sat up, all attention now. Steve saw him wet his lips with his tongue and momentarily lost his pace. He finally tugged his shirt out of his waistband and made short work of the last button.  Pulling the shirt open, he peeled it slowly off, one shoulder at a time, then let it fall to the floor. Tony groaned and made a sort of whimpering sound as Steve splayed his hands wide and ran them down his chest, biting his bottom lip as he did.
. The guy from Afghanistan.  And then I got sidetracked because of the you saying how you were one of the people out looking for me, which we still haven’t actually discussed in any real detail. Don’t think I haven’t noticed. But, anyway, I get it.  The me thing. It’s a lot,” Tony admitted with a wan smile. “All of this.  If that was what was, I don’t know, on your mind or something,” Tony shrugged somewhat helplessly, then set his glass down and interlaced his fingers over his forgotten plate of caviar.  “Steve, you’ve barely looked at me since we left the hotel.  I know I can be a lot to handle.  If I did something…”
“Quite common, I assure you,” Lord Rand chimed in from behind them.  “The Highcastle earned its name for a reason, after all,” he added, forcing a light chuckle that seemed to break the pallor.
Too long.  It had been too long.  He’d come too close to losing this.  He was shaking. Small, hitching breaths of it at first that seemed to struggle to get out of his throat.  Then deeper, lower, shuddering breaths that sounded like the last part of a scream.  He knew that sound.  The one your body kept making when it didn’t know it was out of air.  He wanted it to stop. Wanted to make it stop.  It didn’t seem like something he could stop, though, because every effort he made to make himself stop left him shaking even more violently.
Steve looked up at where Tony hovered over him and found Tony’s eyes, soft gaze melting over Steve as he stroked Steve’s chest and arms.
“Oh my god, you have got to be—I give up. I give up!” Tony announced, throwing his hand in the air.  Steve mimicked the gesture, then looked at Tony and let out a watery giggle that turned into a burp and more spit up.  Tony sighed and wiped Steve’s mouth and chin with the edge of the shirt that was wrapped around his tiny waist.  Small and thin and wheezy, Tony thought with a frown.  Cute enough kid, sure.  All eyes and a soft, patchy down of light hair covering his head, but there was an air of delicate wrongness to him, a pinched sort of sallow, sunken look where there should be rolls of fat, happy baby.  “Just so I’m clear, our current plan is to wait it out and hope Loki was playing nice, right?  I mean, that’s it. That’s our plan.”
“I love you,” Steve breathed out, feeling it like a revelation, though it was not new, not exactly. It had always been true, but it was
“You already played Whack-a-Bus.  No do-overs.  Look, Cap, we’ll just pretend this never happened,” Tony urged quickly, holding up both hands in a placating gesture.
“Her work charting the skies keeps her quite busy. There is even some talk of her joining your university. I am told this is considered quite an achievement for a woman in your Realm, Your Grace, though why that should be so, I cannot say, for Jane is as gifted in mind as she is in beauty,” Thor replied, tipping back his waterbag.
“Corman’s a medic, and we’ve got emergency supplies in the chopper,” Rhodey replied.  “Come on, Tones.  Let’s get you going.”
“Oh, right. Right.  Of course.  Ah…I guess, Stones?” Steve said, looking down and away, then back at the placemat with the map of Italy in front of him.
“Well, that was a stupid move.  Midtown High.  Come by and ask for Mr. Stark.  We’ve got waivers and, I don’t know, stuff.   And you, Throws Yourself on His Sword?  Yeah, that’s you.  Do whatever he offers you, okay?  You’ll be good at it,” Tony told Malcolm.  “What?” he said, looking up at Steve and spreading his hands wide. “Relationships are fifty-fifty. You get one, I get one. That’s fair.”
. His sat up, hands scrabbering over his chest with panic.  It was gone. The reactor was gone, he was going to die, the shrapnel, the shrapnel, the shrapnel, the--his wild gaze fell on something next to him on the table.  The reactor. It was sitting on the edge of the table, the core depleted, though not smoking at this point. It was blackened and burned, though. Next to it sat a small vial with tiny pieces of metal inside it.
“Oh,” Tony said numbly.  His mind flashed to the robin’s egg blue boxes that arrived on each of his mother’s birthdays, with their brightly-colored little escape hatches nestled inside.  A part of him didn’t want this piece of understanding to slot itself into a place in his mind.  It was easier to simply lump her in with Howard, call it the past and leave it there, as if she was something he could slough off if he kept on walking far enough away not to hear her anymore.  There were too many nights of piano music ringing in his ears underneath the whoosh of air and slap of leather on skin.  He wasn’t ready to stop walking, not yet, but he could look back.  For Jarvis, if for no other reason.
“Nah, Steve caught the lamp.  He crashed on our sofa for a few months after everything went to pot with that…thing…that he wouldn’t rid of until it was time to head to Basic, and he couldn’t afford to store it.  I think he cried,” Barnes muttered.  Tony glanced at Rhodey, who tilted his head side to side and widened his eyes encouragingly.
“You really are all about this whole info-breadcrumb dropping thing, aren’t you?”  Tony muttered, puffing out a long breath.  “That why you’re doing this?  Not that I don’t get misplaced guilt motivating unnecessary risks, but the full-on Anna Nicole I asked you to do here is a tad much.”
“We’re seriously going to the Grand Canyon?” Steve asked, still sort of waiting for the other shoe to drop or someone to pop out and tell him this whole thing was an elaborate joke.
“So, I take the banner, walk it right up to the General, drop it at his feet.  I’m like, boom!  You looking for this?” Captain Rhodes said, flinging his free hand up with a flourish, then peered around him in consternation.  “Boom! Are you looking…why do I even talk to you guys?  Everywhere else, that story earns many a toast in my honor, let me tell you.”
,” he gritted out through his teeth, like hurling an accusation.  His mind reeled. It couldn’t be true. Those were stories.  Just
“Just the cool kids,” Stark replied, then grimaced somewhat apologetically. “It’s for security reasons.  You could be a spy.”
“Well, you’re an Alpha, so…me…me, an Omega, playing like Captain America. That’s pretty ridiculous, I know,” Tony said, casting a furtive glance to Jarvis.  “I stopped.  I mean, obviously, I stopped.  That was years ago.  But, I…it was just that one time.  Wasn’t like I was running around, pretending to be a hero or something.”
“I like him,” Tony muttered, leaning back against the settee and tossing his hand in the air in a frustrated gesture. “God help me.  Or, you all help me, whatever,” he continued, raking his hand through his hair with a grimace.  “I like him. Yes, he’s gorgeous, obviously, and of course, I like kissing him.  That…fuck, that part’s always easy, right?  No talking, no feelings, just do the thing?  But, Steve, he’s…nice.  Good. Like, really, truly good.  I don’t know, he’s—God, it’s such a fucking cliché, I know, I can hear myself saying it, but he’s different.  He’s different, and, I’m…what do I do?  I haven’t….this is like first grade, when Victoria St. John gave me her Goldfish crackers, except here, the Goldfish crackers are like listening to me and, I don’t know, being, like, nice and interesting and cheating at mini-golf to get a fucking Slurpee, I don’t know!  I don’t know, okay?”
Well, that was about the dirtiest thing I've ever written.  *pats self on back* Such a proud, proud day, LOL.  Thank you all so much for reading, and particularly for taking the time to leave a comment and/or kudo.  This honestly wasn't going to be anything but a one-shot, but people seemed to really enjoy it, so it kind of grew into it's own beast. So, see, feeding the author works!  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Hope you enjoyed it.
“You should just change your voicemail to, ‘I can’t come to the phone right now because I have my tongue down Tony Stark’s throat.’  It would clear up a lot,” Bucky suggested.
“Wrap your legs around me,” Steve ordered.  Tony didn’t need any more encouragement than that, locking his feet into the small of Steve’s back with a grunt.  Steve squeezed the rest of the contents of the tube into his hand and tossed it to the side, then pressed a slick finger between the curve of Tony’s ass, feeling the muscles clench, then relax as Tony shifted against him.  Steve traced the rim of Tony’s entrance and felt Tony’s head hit his shoulder with a soft thunk, his back bowing as Steve pressed his finger in to the knuckle, then worked it deeper, coating the walls of Tony’s channel while he waited for him to loosen.
Steve started in surprise, nearly missing a step, as his gaze shot to Tony, who was watching him carefully. “Tony,” Steve breathed out, a note of warning in his voice.
life.  What a fucking joke.  It had never been his life, not his own, not in the way that he imagined it must be for other people. He was someone else now, but he’d never really been him, so what did it matter?  They’d sloughed off his entire identity and given him another with the stroke of a pen, and were too busy patting themselves on the back for their sheer awesomeness to notice Tony’s world crumbling in on him.
“Call Sam,” Steve said, looking up at Barnes.  A surge of relief slammed into Tony, making his stomach clench and roll. He closed his eyes and drew in a shuddering breath, then opened them and grinned over at Steve.
“I think blackjack is more my game tonight, but thanks,” Tony replied evenly.  He pointed at the table across the room, where a group of well-dressed people, some in uniform, were huddled around a table with cards in their hands.
Tony’s eyes darted over to the mirror that hung over the dresser, catching his reflection.  He pursed his lips, giving his image a show of disapproval.  There were a few signs of life in the room, he knew.   He just…didn’t know what these things meant.
“I’m sorry, Tony,” Steve said gently, and reached out to grasp Tony’s hand. “Please do not blame yourself for this.  Not this.”
“You promised to tell me about the gala,” Maria reminded him, leaning in Tony’s direction and placing a gentle hand on his elbow to draw his attention.  Howard and Obie were attempting to regale Steve with tales of their exploits at some weapons convention they’d been to in Vegas last year.  It wasn’t working, but Tony doubted his father, at least, could tell, though Obie, to his credit, kept trying to steer the conversation to something that involved actual landmines instead of metaphorical ones.
On the screen, the man and his large….bear-dog thing chased after what were apparently called Stormtroopers in a nod to what Steve thought of as the rather on-the-nose naming conventions in this movie. Vader.  Really? It had been awhile since Steve used his Dutch, but come on. Not that he was really concentrating much on the movie, though Tony was either completely engrossed or didn’t want to have to talk to Steve.  Probably the latter.
Somehow, he got Peggy’s attention.  Somehow, their driver got them out of there.  Somehow, Steve had the plans for Howard’s machine in his hand.
“JARVIS, can you open the door please,” Steve called, unconcerned about the crowd of spectators that had gathered behind him.
“Not that one. It’s a dummy door, wired to blow, look,” Steve said, pointing at the top corner of the door where a nearly invisible line ran to the back of the exit sign. “This one,” Steve told him, indicating a door on the opposite side marked as ‘maintenance.’
By now, he knew the room by heart.  Once the barn door opened on his snooping, the horse was so far gone he was practically Elmer’s.  The dresser contained color-coordinated rolls of socks in one drawer and a series of plaid boxers in the other that Tony wasn’t going to think about.  Well, again, anyway.  Whatever.  T-shirts and a few other assorted clothes were folded in the bottom two drawers.  The Very Secret Diary of Steven G. Rogers was, unfortunately, nowhere to be found.
He was probably projecting. And being swayed by the sheer outrageousness of a private helicopter trip to the Grand Canyon and the rest of it. He was probably being unfair to Brock.  No probably about it, really.  But...he glanced surreptitiously over at Tony, only to find the other man’s half-hooded eyes watching him with an unsettling intensity that made Steve’s throat go dry as he quickly turned away.
The bus pulled up to the stop outside of their building, and Tony made his way down the steps once the doors swung open.  A swirl of icy wind hit him as soon as he stepped onto the curb.  He looked up at the lighted windows with a hollow, dull ache in his chest that seemed to draw tighter each time he thought about Obie’s betrayal.
He remembered finding the door panel on one of their trips to Germany. Heidelberg, he recalled.  Christmas, six—no, seven—years ago now.  God, where did the time go?  Down in the Market Place at one of the dozens of antique shops they rummaged through for no other reason than having nothing better to do, enjoying piping hot potato fritters with apple sauce, beautifully-formed cinnamon star biscuits and doughy snowball cakes.  Steve loved Germany.  Which seemed odd to Tony at first, but there was something very satisfying for Steve in all of the changes.  A sense of see, we did do something.  We mattered.  We made a difference.
“My tongue is part of the reason I’m here, silly girl,” the woman, Kadina, replied with a haughty toss of her head.
“Ugh—what are you doing to me?  God, Steve, come on, I think we both know that isn’t true.  Wasn’t that great for you back then, was I?  Kind of screwed up your life, didn’t I?” Tony countered with a frustrated twist of his mouth.  “I mean, look at things objectively. You’d have been better off never meeting me.”
It was probably a good thing, really, now that he had a bit of distance from it and could think clearly.  Them going their separate ways so cleanly without any messy good-bye.  He had Brock, and Tony had… actually, Steve had the impression that Tony was between relationships, though he hadn’t asked directly.  He just didn’t figure Tony to be the kind of partner who stepped out.  Not even a one-time mistake when he was drunk or… something.  Steve didn’t think Tony would do that.  He probably wouldn’t be okay with his partner sleeping with someone else, either, but, well… easy for him to say when he obviously didn’t need the money.
Tony breathed out a hiss of air and pinched the bridge of his nose.  He was being an ass, he knew, but it was like he couldn’t help picking at this wound, over and over, in tiny, little tears of skin that didn’t seem like much until he looked down and saw that he was bleeding out.  He sank down to his knees on the blanket next to Steve and put his head on Steve’s shoulder, wrapping one arm around the broad expanse of Steve’s chest.
He did, apparently, stare for far too long at the row of sheer stockings.  Long enough that one of the salespeople had asked him if he needed help with anything.  He almost laughed at that, but managed to choke out a ‘no, thank you,’ and moved on.
She’d been low on funds to cover his treatments. He remembered that.  They hadn’t gotten the loan. He’d still gotten the treatments, though.  She had taken night shifts in the TB ward for the extra pay. That particular loan had come due about a year later.  She’d told him she would be fine, but the handkerchief she kept constantly tucked in her pocket was stained with dark, red circles, though Steve had let himself believe her anyway.
“Swirly, huh?  Eh, I’ve been called worse,” Tony shrugged, standing up and stretching.  The movement hitched the shirt out of his waistband, and Steve’s eyes found the flash of skin there, just above Tony’s hip, and he found himself thinking about yachts and long lens photos and what might be on the Internet.  Not that he’d look.  It seemed an invasion of Tony’s privacy at this point, which was, admittedly, a bit odd, considering how they met.  “Let’s see,” Tony said, making a come-here motion with his hand.
Steve’s hands were on the buttons of Tony’s shirt, having a hard time getting them to cooperate while Tony was doing…things…with his mouth, finally earning a chuckle and some help from Tony.  Once his shirt was off, Steve reached up to press a hand gently against the glow of the arc reactor.  He could feel his erection grow even harder in his pants.
“I…appreciate the thought behind that, Tony.  I think, anyway.  You’re…trying, I know.  Really.  But, just trust me.  You need to drink this and then go to sleep.  When you wake up, we’ll talk about…everything.   I promise,” Steve said.  “I’ll stay with you while you sleep, okay?”  He’d obviously screwed this up in record time.  The whole bonding thing was supposed to be easy and natural and virtually un-screw-up-able, but of course, Tony was an overachiever and had managed to somehow fuck up biology.
“Look,” Steve said, lifting his eyes long enough to catch Tony’s confused gaze in the mirror.  “Look at yourself.  Look at how beautiful you are.  You’re amazing, Tony,” Steve continued, flattening his chest to Tony’s back.  “Do you feel how much I want you?  You haven’t even touched me yet.”
Domestic science failed him, since the tie was still wrinkled, but he put it on anyway and smoothed it down as best he could.  Taking a quick look at his reflection in the mirror above the dresser, he pivoted around, tilting his head to the side as he studied himself.
“I know you do,” she replied with a hint of a tired sigh that might have been sadness if she was the kind of person to show that. The elevator pinged to announce their arrival at her floor, and she stepped off, turning to look at Tony.  He almost reached out to hit the button to close the doors, but stopped himself with his hand outstretched, hanging limply in the air like he was offering to shake.  “Don’t let what you might find keep you from remembering that,” she said, slanting her eyes and tilting her head in what he somehow knew was a practiced move.
He had the sense of being down.  His back and legs were flat against something hard.  Carefully, Steve opened his eyes. It was dark. Not pitch black, but dark.  He was laying on something hard and cold, but smooth, like metal or tile. He couldn’t see much, though a few lights of different colors glowed on a panel on what Steve assumed was the wall. It felt…different.  Unfamiliar. It definitely wasn’t Shuri’s lab in Wakanda, that was for sure.
Steve repeated the motion once, then again, finding the rhythm that his body seemed to crave, feeling the slick length slip further and further down his throat each time, the edge of blind panic dissipating on each thrust as he concentrated on the look on Tony’s face, the way he seemed to be splitting apart at the seams, but holding on so tightly, letting Steve do with him what he would. Steve blinked back the hot spikes of moisture pressing at his eyes, then felt one of Tony’s hands settle on the crown of his head as he moved, not holding, just resting there, a connection that both jolted him and settled him.
Checking the lock, he pulls out his blaster again and fires. The bolt breaks and falls away. He half-expects a barrage of troopers to come racing down the hallway of the prison block. No one appears and it jars him more than he thinks possible. He twists the knob of the prison door and pushes it, ignoring the fact that he knows – knows deep in his belly that this is a set up. It’s not going to be Steve – it’s someone – or something else.
“Bucky came to the apartment after he hadn’t seen me around for three days. Had a helluva fever. Even now, I can’t remember much of it. Him and his Ma, they nursed me back to health.” He sniffled. “He’ll always be part of me Tony. I can’t deny him. I can’t cut him off.”
“I suppose all the conspiracy theorists were right about this shit.” Tony said. “SHIELD wants you to bond with their spies so that you end up like them. And then they will use you.”
Tony throws the bone he’s gnawed on into the fire. “JARVIS makes sure my private jet is ready as well.”
There’s nothing Tony can do, he’s only a step away from being a fallen angel now. “I lied to you. I lied. I’m Captain America, I was there, I let Bucky fall, I should have given up my life for him but he gave up his life for mine. Now I’m luring you into the worst transgression, condemning you to an eternity in the dark Realms.”
For a moment, Steve pauses as if the thought of how it is depraved, this act, might stop him. But he shuns it, how can this be depraved and immoral when Tony loves him? When it is an act of love, it is not wrong. It sets him free, allows him to pound into his hand with a frantic speed. He’s grunting as he does, loud and hoarse.
When he looked up, he half hoped he would be back in his Tower, but he wasn’t. The low weeping broke the otherwise quietude of the ward. Tony inhaled, held it, and then walked toward the bed with Sara Rogers in it. Her son looked like wire bent at odd angles. Tony swore he could count every single vertebra sticking up through his too thin shirt.
Steve elbowed the door open to the bedroom and carried Tony to the small bed. It was a full-sized bed, but the two of them together dwarfed it in some ways. Big, muscular, over six feet, Captain America one-time hero of World War II, and now one of the outspoken Captains in the V-Corps took up more than his half of the bed. He put Tony down and then reached over and pushed the door closed. Natasha would ensure that no one bothered them. The room was so small that Steve never had to leave Tony’s side.
“Shakespeare.” Steve shifts and sits up. His head feels light, and he leans forward onto his arms to balance himself. “I loved that book.”
The guy doesn’t answer him because he’s headed toward what Tony surmises is the bathroom to fetch the first aid kit. It’s Steve who’s still lagging behind him who answers, “It was an old brownstone. Other floors are just one flat except this floor.”
Tony cried. He cried until there was no more tears, until the lights outside grew weary of the day and faded away. Steve held him, kissed him, mourned with him. Steve slipped his one arm under Tony’s legs again and carried him to the bed. He didn’t leave him but cuddled against him and kept him safe and tucked in close. After a while, the crying turned to small weeping and then finally to only a whispered shiver of emotion.
“Why?” Anger grew, raging through him. “You fucking abandoned him, let him sell himself on the street, god damned let your SHIELD agent fucking rape him.” At that Coulson’s pallor became pasty. “He doesn’t want to come back because no one fucking cares, no one’s here for him.”
Tony ran his hand through their mixed come on Steve’s chest, writing words and pretending they would stay like tattoos.
Steve held onto the frame of the jet as the supplies were loaded. He stared out into the fields around them. “You know, Clint has a family and now he has this pack to deal with. And in a way it’s his extended family. We’re all family in the pack. Our job is Avengers, but the pack, that’s personal.”
Steve bit back his words as he nodded. Tony understood so much more than Steve gave him credit for. The memory of those vampires, touching him, stroking him. The memory of his body betraying him would lurk around corners, always haunt him. He wanted to be free of it.
He follows and the entrance of Tony into his mouth, hot and moist, brings a muffled moan to his lips. It only deepens the response, the pulse of his heart, the absence of breath, the tight coil like a pained pleasure twisting low in his groin. He surges forward, not caring how blatant and needy he must seem to someone like Tony. But Tony responds by wrapping his arm around Steve, hauling him close until Steve’s nearly falling from the chair.
Surveying the wooded area, Bucky assesses that it's been richly planted and he spots the growth spikes driven into the ground near the trees. Obviously someone wanted the sapling trees to grow quickly. He glances up at the contorted branches some with dead leaves still on them. This is a planned forest and one that has been forced to develop at an accelerated rate. The only reason would be to refresh old landscaping on government buildings or to conceal and fortify a hide out. Bucky goes with the first. He knocks Sam in the arm and points out one of the growth spikes. Sam sees it and indicates he understands. There will be concealed observation towers or platforms in the woods. Both of the move forward but with eyes to the canopy as well as the grounds. It's Redwing who caws and alerts them when soldier leap down from hidden platforms to confront them.
“I’m fine, really,” Steve says with a raised hand to ward off Tony’s probing of the lashes. He doesn’t need Tony to figure out they’ll heal at an accelerated rate. All of his wounds will, except for the stumps of his wings. Those will never heal. He’ll either lose the ability to have wings altogether and be caste out or he’ll earn his wings and become one with the legion of Angels.
“There’s too may fail safes and redundancies. We need to go to the source. No one on Earth will be able to delete this, the one way to remove it is to root it out.” Tony showed what looked like a complex building schematic. It half reminded Steve of the arc reactor. “Ultron’s been a busy boy. He’s built shields and mazes, and defenses to keep himself safe.”
Strange tilted his head. “Maybe you are more alike than not.” He stood up and held his hands behind his back as he assessed Tony. “Are you the one to talk? You are mired in the past. Your father’s love and betrayal is a constant nagging pain for you-.”
“Sometimes it gets cold in late Summer. Sometimes it doesn’t. Lots of times now, it doesn’t. It’s a shame with climate change and all,” Tony says as he folds up his cane. “Got that hot chocolate?”
“Might be a start,” Tony says and his disappointment is clear. “But I want to tell you, I would do it. If it meant I would be condemned and you could be free, I would be with you.”
Steven hesitates before he climbs onto the high four poster bed. Tony feels the dip and weight on the mattress and waits even longer as Steven considers his place on the bed. He begins to shift over, to the foot of the bed to sleep there.
“You need a break. Being an opsimath isn’t your best look, you know.” Tony kisses a line down Steve’s neck and then licks along his vertebrae. “Come on now, let me get some of that tension out.”
“No.” He rolls his eyes. “I’ll wait for the surprise. I wanted to know what your type is, exactly. Natasha mentioned it and now you did too.”
Steve opens the door a crack and whispers to the medics, “He’s sleeping. If there’s a change, I’ll get you.” He doesn’t wait for their reply. Instead, he shuts the door and relaxes on a small chair next to the bed. The seat is fit for an elementary school child, but Steve twists his body and leans into it. Nothing is going to stop him from watching over Tony.
Steven meets his gaze and nods. “Truly. I wouldn’t lie to you. I learned my lesson about that years ago.” And for an instant, Tony sees a glistening of tears in his omega’s eyes.
“They mistreat him. I saw it earlier when you were not here. They shock him with electric prods and beat him with whips. He doesn’t do what they want,” Yinsen says, and he dumps his vegetables into the pot.
"You can't." Steve's eyes turned flat, cold, but also defeated. "You need to leave and not come back."
“Yeah,” Tony says and walks over to the large table that could easily fit twelve. One side of the table only has a long bench for seating, but the other side has tall chairs stained dark but with cushioned seats. He drags one over for Steve and then spots some tray tables tucked in the side next to the refrigerator. He leaves the chair in front of the sliding glass doors and then retrieves one of the tables. Unfolding it in front of the chair, he tests it for sturdiness and then presents it to Steve. “See? Good?”
“Curiouser and curiouser,” Tony says and taps on the frame of his glasses. It brings up the history of Arctica-1e. A planet near the Court systems where the bed of government and power lies. It used to hold a powerful place in the Council, but it lost its prestige during the Uprising of ’43. Covered in snow made of H2O, Arctica held a precious commodity - water. Omegas seized the planet. He recognizes the story.  Every child learned it – but there’s something else, something niggling at the back of his mind. Tony searches the database for any known information on omegas put into stasis. There is none. This omega should not be alive.
Estane was wrong, so bitterly wrong. And Steven was right – in so many ways. Estane taught Tony as a child. He would sit with Tony in the gardens and teach him. Tony lapped it up like a dog at his feet. Estane told him that omegas were little more than animals with human bodies and faces.
“Probably is still a maybe, and even if we don’t – well, he could make it impossible for us to enter again. Now that he knows we can – he’s probably building defenses so no one else can do it.”
He yells out, “Brace for impact!” His arms tighten around the big animal, but for all the world, he feels like a little boy grasping his tiny stuffed toy when the crushing collision happens, and the world goes blank.
A broken sob is heard. Tony almost wants to reach out and tell the person it’s alright, if his body isn’t hurting like his bones might shatter. Don’t cry for him, because he surely doesn’t deserve it.
Steve can’t remember much of it now, other than a cacophony of despair swallowing him whole as he cried onto Tony’s body. For a brief second, he couldn't even remember why he was in this fight anymore. He couldn’t hear his heartbeat. He couldn’t find his pulse. He sobbed and begged Tony to wake up, to not leave him. He truly believes he would have lost it back then if Carol Denvers hadn’t pulled him away and told him Tony was still alive.
Exhaustion claims him. The concept of time completely evades him.  He wonders if his glucose starved brain is capable of giving him one final dream before he dies. That’s not too much to ask for, is it? He tried his best, he really did. He made many mistakes, caused the loss of innocent lives, pushed away people he should have listened more to, waited too long to make amends. If he could go back in time, he would do it all over again differently, even if it meant enduring all the pain that came with it for the second time round.
“You wish you could get rid of me that easily.” He jokes easily and makes her laugh. There is a gentle pat on his left shoulder. Rhodey.
“Yeah, you are right.” Steve gave him a small smile. Having Rhodey here helped. There was a part of him that expected Rhodey to punch him in the guts the first time after they saw each other again after Siberia. But a lot was having that day, including alien invasion and Tony leaving with the alien spaceship, and Rhodey had always been a responsible man who knew his priorities.
He loathes the sound of his own voice when he wakes up screaming. It’s too loud, and he doesn’t want the others to find out. But he would see the same scene over and over in front of him, the moment everyone but him and Nebula faded away. His heartbeat won’t calm down, and he can’t stop reaching, into the air, for nothing, just like that day when he tried to save Peter, and he turned into dust in his hands.
“It went fabulously, sugar.” Tony is clinging onto his Steve tightly, kissing Steve all over the place. His brown eyes are shining brightly with so much fondness without holding back, and Steve comes to realize he has never seen Tony
“No. They can’t do that to you, Tony. I don’t want anyone to write you hate mail.” Steve says gravely with obvious distress. “I will even hold another press conference to get them to stop.”
“Hey, he is still unconscious, but his vitals are stable now. We already contacted Banner and he is going to get everything set up and ready for him by the time we get home.” Rhodey approached them, a tight smile on his face. Steve felt terrible for losing it back there. He was so frantic that he barely had any room to consider the feelings of his teammates. Rhodey was Tony’s best friend, but he held it together so much better than Steve. “Thought you might want to see him, Cap.”
“We found safe harbor.” Natasha touched his shoulder and smiled. She stepped aside to allow him to look out the tinted windows to the lush jungle outside. “Wakanda. The leader of the Dora Milaje, Okoye, also happens to be a Divini, though most in the outside world know her as a vampire.” Natasha shrugged and smiled. “She’s a friend.”
Natasha greets them but Gamora’s hard look means that something may have gone awry. Without ceremony, Natasha says, “He wants Steve to come alone. No one else. Once he has Steve secured, then we’ll be free to leave.”
“Okay, then sure.” Steve gathers some food and other supplies. Tony needs to eat, and Steve assumes he’s been far too busy to even think about nourishment.
Natasha rolled out of his grasp and pulled up her cuff to get a better look at the tattoo on her flesh. It matched Steve’s new brand. He honored her by looking at it, though he hated the thought of causing another person to be locked into his net, his soul pack. The marking almost looked Cyrillic in design but it wasn’t a word or letter. Natasha fingered the mark and then looked up at him.
Steve pauses, just enough, just enough to drive Tony completely nuts. He whimpers and then Steve shoves in with brutal force, crushing Tony’s cock against the edge of the desk. It sends spikes of pleasure so beautiful and pure through Tony he’s about ready to tell Steve not to touch him, but then his big hand wraps around Tony’s erection and works him. It sings through Tony, tightens all of his muscles, all of his tendons, everything until he’s not breathing and then Steve whispers.
“Yeah. She was part of the mission.” He presses his lips into a tight line. “It was a shitty mission and we shouldn’t have been on it. But duty called and we lost some good men and women. It was fucked up. Sorry, but that’s the only way to describe it.”
“And now that fealty is transferred to me. Not only is this omega my right because of my inheritance from my mother but also because I have bonded to him.”
By the time they arrived at Tony’s house, Steve’s whole body was thrumming with tension.  He wasn’t sure if he wanted to strangle Tony or kiss him or maybe a bit of both.  Why hadn’t Tony just asked him about Bucky?  Because the man thought he knew too much for his own good?
It was a testament to Tony’s level of distraction that he didn’t notice they’d passed Los Angeles until they hit one of the freeway’s tunnels.
“I should,” Tony replied.  He leaned over the railing, then turned and craned his neck back to get a better look at the mechanism attached to the platform’s cage.  “It might be possible…yes, if you—which you could, you’d just need a counterweight…bit like a drawbridge, really…”
“I’m just…I’m worried, Tony,” Pepper said.  Even through the phone, Tony could hear the tight concern in her voice.  “We can’t afford to get tangled up in something like that, not with you wanting to start expanding into new industries.  We just can’t risk the bad press.  We still have the DoD poking around on that weapons shipment that ended up where it shouldn’t be.”
“Yes, well, I am relieved to hear my concerns are unwarranted,” Jarvis replied smoothly, trading a glance with Steve, whose jaw tightened for a moment, then relaxed.  “Why don’t I make us a pot of coffee, while the two of you take that new car of yours out for a test drive?”  Jarvis suggested.
I'm on tumblr at sabrecmc.tumblr.com because I'm not creative enough to have different pseuds.  It is pretty much just Stony and stories.  Feel free to come on over!
, the sterile, lawyerly word for under arrest that had kept filtering through the numb, burned out edges of Steve’s mind on that tense, quiet plane ride to London when Tony wouldn’t look at him, just sat there, tight-jawed, staring out the jet’s window, but somehow made all the other arrangements down to the black suit waiting in Steve’s hotel room and the spray of white gardenias that Sharon thanked Steve for while he stared blankly at her and let his mind skip across stories of blackouts and luminous pins and the rich sound of Peggy’s deep, caustic laughter at the idea of relying on a fashion accessory to keep from getting run over on the dark London streets.
There was a bowl of ice on the tray, covered with a cloth, and Steve poured a few of the pieces into the mug of ale that accompanied his food.  It felt incredibly indulgent, the cold brew after the heat of the afternoon’s walk, and he smiled, thinking of Nat and how unimpressed she would pretend to be by such trivial things, all the while enjoying them. He remembered a particularly long winter in the middle of the war, when they were snowbound and unable to move their position until the path cleared. How they had all been sniping at each other until Bucky had thrown the first snowball, and before they knew it, it was like they were a bunch of children for that moment in time.  It had probably been wildly irresponsible at the time, but he couldn’t bring himself to regret it. Steve wasn’t sure if he had ever seen Nat laugh quite like that again. It wasn’t her nature to let herself go that much, but she had, that one time, and the look on Bucky’s face, seeing her that happy, that carefree, for that one moment of time…it had been beautiful. Steve could feel it now, how bittersweet it had been, watching the two of them, happy to see them so at peace, but longing for something he didn’t think he would ever have.
friend is just trying to do right by you,” Tony said. “Seriously, I’ll send you a playlist.  All the best.  I’m—here,” he said, taking out his phone again.  “I’m having JARVIS do it right now.  Yeah, J, just throw my most played on there, would you?  Oh God,” he stopped, looking up in horror at Steve.
“Theyweren’tstupid,” Tony muttered, then closed his eyes.  He swallowed, or tried to.  There wasn’t any saliva in his mouth.  Why?  Why did he have to do that?   It was like a bell being rung that made his brain sit up and antagonize when he should just walk away. Why couldn’t he just walk away?
“He just does that now,” Natasha said from where she was cradled in one of the overstuffed chairs. “Like a hello, only really possessive and vaguely threatening. Honestly, I kind of like it,” she said with a shrug.
But he’s so interested in the company succeeding, another voice, deeper and familiar, slithered through his head.  He doesn’t want you.  And he can’t set you aside and keep the company.  But, he wants the company to do well.  Do you really think Steve plans to be celibate for the rest of his life?  How do you know he doesn’t already have someone?  Someone not you.  Someone he wants.  Someone he’s willing to put up with you to get.  Someone he takes care of in all the ways an Alpha can.
“You have literally zero idea what I’m working on,” Bruce replied lightly. “Come on, Tony. Give over. You’ve been acting off for the past few…ah. Okay, I see it now.”
Kirk’s tongue slid through the seam of Steve’s mouth and wound its way around Steve’s own, licking and swirling as he deepened the kiss.  When he finally pulled back, Steve wasn’t the only one panting heavily.  Kirk’s brown eyes were blown wide and dark, and his cock jutted hard into Steve’s stomach, just above the waistband of Steve’s sweats where his own cock was pressing a small circle of wetness against the grey cotton.
problem, he thought with a stab of annoyance. There were probably lots of other problems with all of this. With him.
“No, no, its fine.  We’re friends.  Better that way, really.  I think we tried too hard to make a great friendship into something else, like that wasn’t enough.  And all of this—after Killian and Extremis…it was too much, I think,” Tony said absently, then caught himself.  “Um, anyway, she splits her time between here and California running SI, so you’ll see her around. But we aren’t together.  I’m not actually with anyone.  Like that, I mean.  Just me, you know—just…just me,” Tony said, clamping his jaw together so hard he was surprised it didn’t crack.
It was the next part that had his stomach in knots and his nerves on edge, though if he was honest with himself--which it was somehow easier to be while he watched Tony move around the room with seemingly no sense of real purpose--he could admit that at least some of what he felt was...interest.  It was hiding under guilt and recrimination, sure, but it was there, hot and dizzying, like the heat that washed over the sands in blurry, undulating waves.
“Yeah.  They just do what has to be done anyway,” Steve replied.  “That’s what makes them brave.  And if they put themselves on the line to protect others, that’s what makes them soldiers.”
