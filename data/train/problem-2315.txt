Catherine’s eyes widen in surprise.  She shifts from foot to foot, snow crunching under her trainers.
John huffed noncommittally as he crossed the room to stand by her side.  Peering down at his daughter, he was unable to fight back the new wave of emotion gathering, slamming into him.  Rosie’s features were crumpled as if in discomfort.  She coughed and wrestled against the blanket.
John looked momentarily crestfallen.  He scratched his brow, sighing.  “Don’t see why you have to be so…”
Mary turns to stare out the cab window, smirking at her reflection in the dark glass.  Beyond, the city sweeps past in a smear of neon lights and sheeting rain.  “When you nodded off looking at the client’s accounts. In your armchair.”
I’ve had the misfortune to meet.  If she’s really keen on the violin, she will master it.”
“Mary?” Alexander echoed.  “That was her middle name.  She went by Rose.  How did you know that?”  Something in his eyes sharpened as John searched for words.  “Your daughter.  Her name is
Mrs. Hudson shook her head.  “Again, John.  I should be the one thanking you.”
When John finishes, he plasters himself against Sherlock’s back with a spent sigh.  “Jesus Christ.  You’re going to be the death of me.”
“Won’t be a moment,” said Sherlock, and fled to the kitchen.
“Don’t wanna,” Rosie mumbles.  “’M’not a baby.”
“Mr. Holmes.”  John whirled around to see the big man limping toward them.  His right leg had been terribly injured, judging from his slow, pained gait.  The man stopped, nodded at John in greeting, and turned to Sherlock.  “You called saying we could meet with Mr. Everill again.”
Lifting my chin, I jab the buzzer once, firmly.  If the famous detective is half as good as they say he is, he’ll know I mean business.
John pressed his lips against Sherlock’s temple.  “No one does.”
“The magnifying glass.”
his mind supplies.  He considers feigning politeness, finds he hasn’t the energy for it.
Sherlock laughs now, with a touch of hysteria, as John closes the door behind them.  Darkness strips away sight, but their hands make up for the lack, roving over shoulders and backs and waists as lips meet and tongues delve, frantic and hungry.  Sherlock winces as shelves dig into his shoulder blades and lower back.
“And the addresses of the new purchasers?”
“You ended it with her,” he hears himself pronounce.  “With… your girlfriend.”
He slammed the door in Mycroft’s face before his brother could respond.  Pivoting on his heel, he stalked away from the door, eager to rid himself of the sound of Mycroft’s lumbering tread as he descended the stair.
“American?”
“Of course,” says Sherlock.  He tries to sound testy – John knows he hates repeating himself – but it’s a pitiful effort.  “It looks very… nice.”
“I did,” said Alexander.  “I do.”
“I can,” says John, “and I am.  And Sherlock knows the owner of this restaurant – helped him out of a tight spot. Unless you want to embarrass yourself by being thrown out, I suggest you fuck off.”
“I know you know,” says John.  “Only… from now on, I only want to think of us.  Yeah?  I know there will be times when… when I can’t help.  Remembering.  But I’m going to try to focus on our future.”
“Who are you?” said Sherlock.
I'm Zingiberis on Tumblr.
Next, Sherlock researched the Grant family itself.  Their company, Grant Instruments, was based in Seattle, Washington.  As Alexander had said, they were prominently involved in manufacturing tools for dental and oropharyngeal surgeries.  Father an American heir, mother an English ENT.  Facts about the parents were easy to find, but there was little mention of Alexander.  Few articles acknowledged him, much less offered pictures.  That made sense, given how adamant he was that his dead wife and child not be dangled in front of the media.
“Um, right,” said John, feeling foolish.  He gestured at the stairwell.  “If you need anything, just shout.  Except you’d better bloody not shout, because…”  He nodded at Rosie and, exceedingly uncomfortable, bolted for the stairs.  The murmured exchange between Sherlock and Alexander faded as John reached his old room and closed the door behind him.
His guard is down when the plague strikes yet again.  When he swallows the first mouthful of wrap and thinks
“Sherlock?  You all right?”
You like the bibimbap.  –SH
“I have to tell you something,” said Sherlock, desperate to steer the conversation in another direction.  The sensation of being suddenly unmoored, of drifting on an endless, lonely sea with no landmark or stars to navigate by - it made his thoughts churn and whirl.  The deduction peeled away from the tumult like ashes dancing off a fire.  “It’s about Mary… and Rosamund.”
injury or no.  He ducks, feeling the arc of the bat whistle inches above his head.  Dancing in close, he delivers two more jabs and darts away before the killer can retaliate.  The fingers of his right hand fumble with his mobile, unlocking the screen and phoning the Yard.
“You loved her anyway,” said Sherlock.  His tone caught John by surprise.  It was sympathy and wistfulness wound together like the threads of a rope.
“John,” he says.
“Sherlock,” John begins.
So, when John returns from the clinic a few days later looking drawn and haggard, Sherlock immediately plucks a gem from the pile.  He turns over the idea, studying each facet in the flashing light of deductions whirling through his mind.  John is exhausted, frustrated, irritable.  A long day at the clinic:  two separate patients whinged at him for head colds, one hypochondriac demanded to have her scalp checked inch-by-inch for nonexistent lice, and an elderly man vomited on his nice brogues.  His hair is mussed and bruised circles hang under his eyes.
Sherlock tenses, stiffens – and cries out, spurting over their fingers. He slumps back in his chair and John wastes no time, smearing his fingers through the come on Sherlock’s fingers and using them to slick his strokes.  Sherlock watches him with heavy-lidded eyes as he pulls himself, feverish, and his need is so strong that he scarcely manages half a dozen strokes before he’s toppling over the brink.  He shudders and pitches forward, burying his face in Sherlock’s neck to muffle his shout. Sherlock runs gentle fingers over the back of his neck as the trembling subsides.
magnifying glass, with the iron-wrought handle that had saved Sherlock from Eirene so many years ago.  As he stared at the dull handle, the chipped lens, the memories flooded back.  Someone seizing his hand, dragging him into the forest as Eirene screamed.  A push, sending him into the water.  The acrid sting of pond scum in his throat as he surfaced, gasping, back into the human world.
Sherlock scoops his hands under John’s arms as he stands and drags him into a kiss.  John’s mouth is hot and wet, bitter salt.  Sherlock fumbles at his flies with shaking fingers.  Clumsy but determined, he steals his hand inside, gripping John’s prick.  John jumps with a muttered oath, then cants his hips as Sherlock’s hand makes a tunnel for him, slick with sweat.  It takes only a handful of thrusts for him to come, cursing and shuddering and clinging to Sherlock’s shoulders.
“Y-yes,” Sherlock says.
“You’re laughing at me!”
“Mrs. Hudson won’t be pleased if you make a mess,” he informs her.
At the point, Mycroft closed his briefcase and stood.  “Out of the question.”
“To keep yourself safe,” says John, and the frank concern in his tone catches Sherlock by surprise.  He’s used to dancing around emotional subjects, but this is a different dance entirely.  He’s wrong-footed.
“Goodbye,” the Father Christmas Killer says.
“Why do you want to play?” Sherlock asks, genuinely curious.  “You have me to play for you.”
“They identified her by her dental records,” Alexander said.  “She was…”  He swallowed, blinked hard.  “Unrecognizable.”
“Gosh,” says John, “How could I resist?  You’re so charming.”
Without a word between them, they sprint through the hall toward the sound – and stop when it falls abruptly silent.  John stands, chest heaving, breath ragged.  A sob wells in his throat and he raises one fist to his mouth, bites down.
Rosie chose that moment to interject with a whimper, as if to say
catch up with you…”
“Come here,” he murmurs, patting the spot on the sofa beside him.
John’s false smile shades into the edges of reality.  “Oh.  Well, thank you.”
“I’m sorry if I offended you,” says Catherine, and she does seem genuinely sorry.
He charges before John has time to react, ready to grapple.  John tenses – but then the ceiling groans, sags.  A chunk of burning wood peels off and topples down, down to crack across John’s fragile skull.
But Woodley still has the knife.
In that moment – held at once by Rosie and Mary – John wondered if they could make it work.  He
John makes eggy bread.  Sherlock, still cloistered in his bedroom, can smell the faint sulfur stink as eggs fry on the hob.  The smell swirls into grease and char, designed to tug at even the most recalcitrant appetite.  Sherlock tugs the duvet over his head and breathes in the musty air underneath.
when you transferred the funds to Goldenrod.”
“Sherlock.”
Molly lingered in the lab after Jim had gone, prefacing his departure with a chaste peck on the cheek.  Sherlock had turned his attention back to the microscope, but he felt her stare settle on him like a physical weight.
(Besides, he doesn’t mind John’s commanding tone.)
“I’ve disappointed you,” said Sherlock.
John comes out of the ordeal with both his life and a healthy respect for the horrors of oysters.  Once the panic has passed, Sherlock finds he has rather mixed feelings.  On the one hand, he knows John will never again subject him to the snotty monstrosities.  On the other, he can’t help but feel a bit… betrayed.  Oysters and sea slugs share the same phylum.  It’s as if his own research has turned on him, one family bent on vengeance for the death of another.  Instead of spending the night shagging, Sherlock is sitting beside John in a dingy A&E outpatient room, offering his exhausted boyfriend water from a Styrofoam cup while his arse grows numb on a hard chair.
“How economical,” said John, dryly.
Until, very abruptly, he doesn’t.  He lights the candle and tips the pile of ash onto a spoon, and is carefully, carefully sifting the powder into the flame when it erupts in a mushroom of black, putrid smoke, filling the room with preternatural speed, choking off his gasp and clotting his nose and throat with blistering agony.  Sherlock throws himself back, his mind whirling with visceral terror – the terror of being dragged into deep, cold waters, of feeling your blood starve without oxygen.  He trips over the chair and crashes to the floor, dragging in a breath to cry out for John, gagging on the smoke.
“Hm?”  Sherlock hands him the glass, bemused.  “Yes, of course.  You’ve said so numerous times.”
Standing on the edge of the dance floor, Sherlock studies the dancers.  Anderson is making his limbs and joints robotic, sloppy with drink; Donovan cackles as he topples into her, saved from pitching them both to the floor by the crush of bodies.  On the other side of the crowd, Molly is plastered against Lestrade – with ardor or a need for balance, Sherlock cannot say.  Nearby, Bradstreet twirls Hopkins like a precariously-balanced top.
“Yeah.  Mum’s maiden name.”  She shrugged. “I’m not shy about my ancestry, but if I wind up the wrong people, John could lose his job.  Ordinary people are afraid of people like me.  They’re always looking for a way to push us out.  So.”  She fiddled idly with her ID card.  “I’m Harry Edwards now.”
“Don’t be a tit.  You know you were being reckless.”
Harry had shrugged, unrepentant.  “Better out the front than the back.  You wouldn’t’ve wanted to deal with that, would you?”
“Yes, I…”  Sherlock trailed off and looked at his feet.  He was clad in black trousers and a navy button-up shirt.  The color brightened his eyes.  “I have a surprise for you.”
“Don’t make people into heroes, John. Heroes don’t exist, and if they did, I wouldn’t be one of them.”
“Yessir,” Sherlock says, tipping John a mock salute.
And a little heartbreaking.
The shower is scalding.  When John steps out, his skin is smarting and raw, but still the chlorine smell lingers.  He scrapes his palm over his nose and curses as he reaches for his bathrobe and shoves his arms through the sleeves.  The hot water has filmed the entire room in a fog, rendering his reflection in the mirror above the sink amorphous and pink.
“Your scans are encouraging,” his doctor said, later.  A grave, fastidious sort of fellow, his face was pinched as he studied the chest X-ray and CT scan on his computer monitor.  The look he turned on John was stern, as if John was a reckless child who had fallen off his bicycle and broken his arm.  “You may be stable, Mr. Watson, but the road to recovery will be a long one.  Gunshot wounds take time.”
Jonas Oldacre’s grizzled face transforms into an animal mask of hatred. He seems insensate to the fire consuming his house, the tongues scorching through his clothes to lick at his skin. “It can’t get any worse.”
Sherlock bites the inside of his cheek.  “Quite right.  Watson,
“It isn’t a sovereign title I’m interested in,” said Mycroft.  “It should also go without saying that, should you discover this hitman in London, you must inform me.  Do not confront him.  Do not give him any reason to suspect that I know of his whereabouts.”
“Not yet, John.  She had a pulse when they took her away.”
Mrs. Hudson shrugged.  “Oh, I don’t know.  He doesn’t say much, you know.  Which is fine, only I couldn’t get much of a read on him. However...”  Her brow knitted.  “I caught a glimpse of him when he thought nobody was looking, and.  Well.  He looked very sad.”
– and stops before John and Sherlock.
“I can’t—”
“Buried alive,” Sherlock pronounces.  “Her killer piled coal on top of her; not all at once, of course, seeing as she struggled.”  He points to the corpse’s hands, resting placidly on her lap.  “The killer added more and more coal until she was crushed.”
“A few.”  Ten, at least.  Dozens of unanswered texts.  And one call to Mrs. Hudson, but he knew there was little the landlady could do.  If Sherlock didn’t want to come, he wouldn’t.  It was as simple as that.  “He’s probably busy with a case.”
The realization struck and Sherlock reeled back on the balls of his feet.  A mazikeen – one with redcap blood.
I truly am sorry.  There’s been a break in the adult-onset SMA case.  –SH
“I see.”  Then, remembering John’s notions, he adds, “Don’t tell your father.  He’s quite keen on Christmas.”
But Sherlock was at this crime scene, and trouble clung to him like a second shadow.
It was several moments before John registered what Sherlock was saying: “It’s okay, John.  It’s okay.  I love you.  It’s okay.”
“Oh, for God’s sake, Sherlock.”  John rolls his eyes.  “You could have died!  Oldacre would have fought until you both burned or suffocated, and you’re worried about a book?  A sodding
“S’fine,” Sherlock says, voice quavering.  Cold seeps into his skin, burrows into the marrow of his bones.  His clothes are plastered to his skin, offering little protection against the chill air. John is in much the same state as he is.  “We m-might need b-blankets.”
Closing his eyes, Sherlock recalls the feeling of John’s arm tight around his waist.  For a moment – a fleeting, wishful moment – realities and impossibilities are banished, and he lets his mind wander.  Lets himself be warm.
The young woman walks forward, offering her hand for a brisk shake.  “I’m Charlotte Helens, Rosie’s teacher.  You may call me Ms. Helens.”  As they walk into the back room, she adds in an undertone, “The principal and vice principal are busy, you see, and I thought we could get this sorted without making a fuss.  Rosie is usually so well-behaved.”
“Of course I am,” Sherlock snapped.  His thoughts raced, trying to pick out a common thread that connected the facts.  “Sylvius’ chair had a device, this one doesn’t, Nathan Garrideb’s didn’t.  Where is the pattern?
He turns left onto York Bridge and follows the footpath to the Inner Circle.  He passes a few people on the way; most Londoners have retreated from the snowfall, but these intrepid few are out to see the spectacle, bundled up so thickly in coats and scarves and hats and mittens that they are scarcely recognizable as humans.  They pay him no mind, too preoccupied to notice the famous detective in their midst.
He kicks back the duvet and shoves a hand down his boxers, his blood thumping behind his ears.  But what little pleasure he can give himself is a pale imitation of what he’d been anticipating all evening.
“Well,” says John, “it’s because I love Sherlock, too.  I love him very much.”
The glower John shot at Sherlock was breezily ignored.  Over Sherlock’s shoulder, John caught Alexander watching them.  He did not flinch when John met his eye, but looked away after a lingering moment.
Sherlock nods, pries his hand from the sheets to drag open the drawer on the nightstand.  He hurriedly passes the tube back to John, shivering as he hears the cap click open.  John’s hand leaves his cock and Sherlock all but
Furrowing his brow, Sherlock tried to puzzle through the past hour.  He had… he had…  “I fell into the pond.  Think I saw a… a fish.”  A glimmer of pale, cold flesh darting through the water.  Yes, it must have been a fish.
“Yeah.”  John sighs.  “She really does.”
Silently, John climbed the stairs.  A baby gate leaned against the wall at the landing, unbolted.  John and Mary were running ragged as it was; he couldn’t imagine what chaos they would face when Rosie became mobile.
“Do you know,” says Sherlock, “we’ve come full circle?”
Perplexed, Sherlock tries to put John from his mind as he turns back to the body.  A futile effort:  he might as well try to banish his heart’s impulse to beat or his eyes’ need for a light by which to see.  The glow of fairy lights and the glare of the NSY vehicle lights make for patchy visibility.
“He’s got a point!”
“Of course, yes.  Enough for a lifetime.  Far too much.”
“John!”
The place beside him was empty.  Running a hand over it, Sherlock felt John’s residual warmth bleed into his palm.  He laid back and tried to stop shaking, but it was a losing battle.  A craving gnawed at him, burrowing into flesh and bone like a malignant cancer.  He needed a hit.  He’d had nothing for the past two days – if he had to wait a moment longer, he would go mad.
Several things happened at once.  A text alert chimed and Sherlock moved his phone from his ear to see, John’s voice fading as the gap yawned wide between them.  The text was from Mary.
Sorry.
“Can you manage it?”
“Could you stop using that word?”
Moments later, Mary appeared in the doorway.  Her cheeks were pink with the chill of March and her hair was tousled from the wind.  “Hello, lovey,” she cooed, offering her finger to Rosie.  The baby seized it with a gurgle.  Glancing at John, Mary said, “Sorry.  I didn’t think Helen would keep me so long.”
Sherlock swallows down the sour smack of anxiety.  “I made dinner.”
“When Effie died,” said Alexander, “Rose lost it.  She’d loved our daughter like I’d never seen her love someone before.  She spiraled.  Got depressed.  She didn’t eat, she rarely slept.  But people always say—people always say everyone grieves differently.  I thought Rose just needed…”  His face crumpled and he pressed his palm to his forehead, shoulders shaking.  “Time.”
The facts are these:  Violet is an orphan, robbed of her parents when, on holiday in the Lake District, a drunk hurtled his truck into theirs on a rain-slick country road.  She was adopted by her uncle, Ralph Smith, who cared for her in place of the children he never had.  When Violet graduated from uni, Uncle Ralph hired her to work in his research lab developing pesticides.  He then boarded a plane bound for America, bent on faffing about on the wrong side of the pond.
His words at the pool echo in John’s mind.  “
The goons look mortified and touched by turns, and Sherlock stares into his teacup like he wishes he could evaporate in the steam.  Taking pity on him, John nudges him with an elbow. Sherlock flicks a confused glance at him and John offers a milk chocolate biscuit from his own plate. Sherlock takes the proffered biscuit with a shy smile.
“…sorry about all that.”  John’s voice. Low, murmuring.  Comfort threaded through each syllable like sutures in flesh: a sting, a balm.  Healing.
“So good to see you again, Dr. Watson,” he said.
“Oh,” says Sherlock.
“Right.”
“How did you know?  About the peaches, I mean.”
“Quite.”  Mycroft slid his gaze to Sherlock.  “We need those plans restored.  If they get into the wrong hands, the Queen—”
The joke fell flat, a balloon punctured before it could lift off the ground.  Sherlock glanced at John, and the mazikeen lowered his gaze.
“You weren’t going to tell me.”  It isn’t an accusation.  “You were going to – disappear.”
She paused, her eyes going glassy.  The color drained from her face and her lips puckered around a moan. Sherlock scarcely had time to back away before Harry Watson bent double, shuddered, and vomited on the front steps of 221 Baker Street.
“How is the search for Peter Helens going, Detective Inspector?” says Sherlock, desperate to change the subject.
“Then stop boring me with your moaning and see about having Ms. Goodwin transported to Bart’s morgue.  I can’t gather all the data I need out here.”
Chaos lay before them.  Shards of glass and porcelain were strewn across the floor, glittering in the weak light.  Further away, a display case had been overturned, its shattered contents spilled onto the floor.  A shape caught John’s eye and he aimed the Sig, only to realize his target was a grandfather clock.  Springs curled like wiry hairs over the jagged edges of its ruined face.
“Scotland?” John asked, bemused.  “What, have you got a case there?”
“Could you,” he began, but Sherlock was already gone, hobbling into the kitchen.  The muted thump of a cupboard door opening and closing was followed by a rattle and the hiss of running tap water.  Sherlock returned moments later with a full glass in hand.  “Thanks.”
“Oh, my God,” John groans.  “God, Sherlock, you’re—amazing, incredible, fuck,
John reined in his defensive retort.  “2013, in… spring, sometime.  I think it was March.  She asked me out for drinks after a long day at the clinic and I thought,
”  He lowered his gaze and shook his head.  “I’ll stop her.”
“I will go up first,” Sherlock says to Lestrade.
Sherlock next woke to sunlight streaming through a gap in the curtains, bathing the room in its warm, yellow glow.  John was gone, as were the clothes he had strewn across the floor last night.  The space beside Sherlock was cool, the indentation of John’s body long-faded.  Sherlock curled on his side and smoothed a palm over the sheets.
Sherlock shrugged.  Wisps of steam uncurled between his cupped hands.  “It was a funeral.”
“’Course not,” says John.  “Adults like napping too, you know.”
“What?” John blinked.  “What is it?”
Sherlock
“Do we want to go poking around in this?” Alexander asked.  “The last chair we found was in a sniper’s flat.”
John lowered his gun.  “There’s no-one here.”
“All the… all the Moriarty stuff, it was…”
“No,” he hears Catherine groan.
“Oh!”  Stupid, stupid!  How had he not seen it the moment Alexander entered the flat?  No doubt the morphine was to blame.  If cocaine had been simmering in his veins, he would have known in a flash, would have taken the man’s entire life apart by the scuffs on his leather shoes.
“Right,” says John.  His tone is perfectly ordinary.  He turns to the sitting room.  “Rosie?  Darling, you ready to go?”
“I’m—I’m sorry,” he croaks, and slips off Sherlock’s lap, nearly stumbling in his haste.  Sherlock reaches out to steady him, but John takes a step back, pressing his hands flat against his thighs.  “I… Sherlock, I need…”
“We can’t giggle,” John admonishes, “we’re in our sitting room.”
Rosie, engrossed in the microscope, pays them no mind.  John raises his eyebrows.  “I mean you’re dressed to go
“Oh, Sherlock,” he says.  “They—these are perfect.  Thank you, love.”
John drags him down into a rough, filthy kiss.  As far as first kisses go, it’s not at the top of his list of fantasies – that place is reserved for Baker Street, soft voices and softer touches, hours to explore one another – but this isn’t a bad contender for second place. In fact, it’s pretty bloody amazing.
“Mrs. Hudson told me you’re looking after Rosie,” he said.  “Thank you.  That’s, um.  No small feat.”
Sherlock hums, rearranging his expression into a façade of composure. “Quite.  In fact, I think we should start as soon as possible.”
“We’re a fine pair, aren’t we,” he mumbled.
Then he jabbed one finger in the direction of the tea tray.  “But first, you have to eat a little toast.”
Closing the menu and setting it aside, Mary shook her head.  “I’ve killed one Holmes and kept his loyalty.  Even more impressive?  I kept my husband’s.  Do you really think I can’t do this alone?”
John sets the cup aside.  “How are you feeling?”
Sherlock is tempted to close his eyes and let sleep claim him, but something about John’s solidity behind him gives him pause.  No – it isn’t the solidity itself, but the
Sherlock rises, levers his legs off the bed, stands.  And promptly falls on his arse.
John turns around, expression blank.  His eyes find Sherlock’s as if magnetized, and for an instant, Sherlock is trapped.  The instant stretches into a handful of seconds, each one a needle burrowing beneath his ribs.  He looks away.
Thumbing the “answer” icon, Sherlock lifts the phone to his ear, excitement and trepidation twisting inside him.  He can’t forget the way John looked at him yesterday, can’t quite categorize it.  He wants to preserve the memory in his Mind Palace with a descriptive placard:
On the armrest, Sherlock nudges his little finger against the inside of John’s wrist.  His voice comes out ragged.  “Yes, John,
Lestrade cast Sherlock a narrow look.  “Will you do it?  We can wait on forensics for the dental records, but frankly, I don’t see the point.  If the victim is who we think it is, his history will be spotty at best.”
“John Watson,” says Mrs. Hudson, “whatever could that be?  A bug bite?”
He’s three months into the new job and it’s… well.  It’s work.  It’s a dull marathon of snotty noses and wheezy chests but it keeps John’s mind somewhat busy and it gives him an incentive to not hit the bottle too hard on weekdays.  It’s fine.
(Sherlock did momentarily consider going to the scene draped in the bedsheet, but reason won out in the end.  Best not give Donovan and Anderson another reason to call him a freak.)
“Well.  Much?”
Sherlock sat motionless as he absorbed Alexander’s words.  The comment he had made about wives and children scant minutes ago came back like a blow.
There is a beat of silence after I lower my hand.  Two beats, three…  Maybe nobody is home.  Relief and disappointment war within me as I step back, jostling a passerby.  He shoots me a sidelong scowl as he strides past.  It won’t be long before London is fully awake and humming with the multitudes on their way to work, to breakfast, to appointments.  I can’t just camp out on the doorstep.
angry.  There is a glimmer of concern in his eyes as he draws back.  “Still cold?”
and the bolt clicked.  The door swung open and Mrs. Hudson was standing before him, Rosie propped against her shoulder.  She smiled a little nervously.
The cab slows to a halt and John pays the fare without a word.  Opening the door, he crosses around the end of the cab and opens the door for Sherlock.  He offers a hand and Sherlock takes it, rocking back on his heels as his low blood pressure fails to accommodate the sudden motion.  John winds an arm around his waist and leads him to the door of 221, into the front corridor, and up the stairs.  With each step, Sherlock feels his energy ebb, like air leaking from a punctured balloon.  Wheezing and squealing as he crumples.
Sherlock stood and went to the window, where he watched Mycroft slip into a black, unmarked car.  As the vehicle coasted down the street, he said, “Perhaps we could trade siblings.”
Sherlock sighed, eyes flickering open to study the ceiling.  What had he expected? That John would be a carbon copy of his monstrous forebear?  Ridiculous. It wasn’t as if John was going to die for lack of bloodshed.
Sherlock texted, fingers thick.
The moment he was gone, Mycroft sighed.  “We can’t trust him.”
“Do you love me?” asks Rosie.  The question snags at Sherlock’s heart like a hook, at once tender and sharp.  He isn’t Rosie’s father but an outsider, a freak transplanted into her life in place of a mother.
Sherlock slipped off to investigate while John and what’s-her-face were busy being stupefied by parlor tricks.  The circus’ supplies were beyond an unmarked door – locked, but Sherlock made quick work of that. He found the spray bottle of paint amidst the glitz and clutter of silk and brocades.  And was promptly attacked by Zhi Zhu.
Rosie fought with every bone in her little body, but she was only an infant – after half an hour of hellish protest, exhaustion claimed her.  Gingerly, John placed her in the cot, turned on the baby monitor, and turned off the lights.  He closed the door with infinite care and padded softly down the stairs.
” Mary snarled, cutting him off.  Her façade of calm had cracked, revealing the rage roiling underneath.  “You tried to take my daughter away from me, John, but I won’t let you.  You’ll never see Rosie
“Christ,” Lestrade mutters.  “Why’ve people got to do fucked-up things during the holidays?  Whatever happened to
“…got to give his statement, Sherlock.”  Lestrade sounds weary.  “Protocol and all that.”
I'm Zingiberis on Tumblr.
Jim, who Sherlock had been certain was an ordinary human.
It was those last two words, sharp with something akin to fear, that startled Sherlock into obedience.
It – the case, the abomination – began with a pretty brunette girl sitting on the wooden stool between John and Sherlock, head held high, back straight, hands clasped in her lap.
I'm Zingiberis on Tumblr.
Sherlock watches her and a picture coalesces like pieces slotting into a puzzle.  The silver-smoke image of Rosie is transmuted into another child:  a six-year-old Charlotte Helens, hiding from her abusive father in the freezing darkness of the Winter Palace.  An illusion, created and fed by three desperate children who had nothing to protect them but plywood walls and a rotting door.  To them, that pitiful shack was more than a palace: it was a dream.  It was safety.
“Tolerable,” John echoes.  He’s still smiling.  “Right.”
Sherlock understands.  “Yes.  He’s gone.”
“Then what is it?” Sherlock pressed.  John sensed him drawing close.  One large hand rubbed his shoulder.  “Is it the work?  I can take simpler cases for a while.  Safer ones.  I’ll do whatever I can to accommodate your daughter’s safety.”
“Can’t it wait?  I have… well, I’ve got something important.  To talk about, I mean.”
John rises from his chair to help the hapless landlady.  “Sorry, Mrs. Hudson… Why don’t you sit?”
The footsteps grow steadily louder.  “You do realize it’s bloody freezing in here, right?”
It’s fine. Really.  We can go another time.
Sherlock could not contain his grin as another piece of the puzzle snapped into place.  “You’re working for the people stealing Effie Grant’s money – and they’re funneling it through the Mazarin Chairs.”
Mrs. Hudson stared, no doubt befuddled by Sherlock’s sincere use of the phrase “thank you.”  Mustering a put-upon sigh, she said, “It really is, you know.  You’ve gone quite… peaky.”
“How?  It isn’t your fault Lucy is…”  He all but chokes on the word.
“John,” said Sherlock, “why did Moriarty want you?”
A smile tugs at one corner of Sherlock’s mouth.  “Do give me some credit, John.  I don’t simply
“Drop it,” John says.  “Now.”
John insists that Sherlock take the first shower, pressing a hand to the small of his back to push him toward the bathroom.  Sherlock’s stomach flutters as he closes the door behind him and peels off his sodden clothes.  With shaking fingers, he pulls up the diverter and twists the lever.  The water is almost scalding.  Steam fills the room, fogs the frosted glass.  If John were in his bedroom and not the hallway, he might catch a glimpse of Sherlock’s naked silhouette.
“I didn’t do enough.”
“Whose nibs?”
John glanced around the empty flat, the tension of their break-in honing into cold, clear purpose.  The shift from confused man into predatory redcap was captivating, like watching a lion sunning itself on a rock, only to rise and stretch, tongue lolling, before it pounced.
John opened the door to a burly young man.  His shoulders rose and fell as he panted; sweat dampened his brow.  His eyes darted past John to Sherlock, who stood a few paces away.
“Um.”  John bites the inside of his cheek, fighting a smile.  “Sterile.”
Sherlock stands amidst the tumult, feeling suddenly dizzy.  He pivots, reaching for the cab door – and his fingers close on empty air.  The cab has deserted him.
“Thank you.  I do apply myself.”
When he came back to himself, he replied, fingers clumsy and punch-drunk.
Ms. Helens continues as if she hasn’t heard him.  “He left me there for hours.  It was only when Peter got back from football practice that I got out; he realized I was missing and put two and two together.  He saved me.  I was lucky I didn’t lose any fingers or toes.”
“I don’t fit in the picture,” he says.
That is the story of how Sherlock punches Molly in the face, and how, subsequently, a very drunk Lestrade gives Sherlock a black eye to match his bruised nose. The ruddy drunk attempts to tackle Lestrade to the floor, but his trajectory is off and he crashes into a femme lesbian, prompting her butch girlfriend to throw a haymaker at his head.  John grabs Sherlock’s shoulder in one hand, Molly’s in the other, and steers them out of the melee.  After checking to make sure Molly isn’t seriously injured – “I’m fine, really, it’s only a split lip—oh, that is quite a lot of blood…” – he offers her a wadded-up tissue and an apology before dragging Sherlock out of the club.
“It won’t be like the last few times,” Sherlock said.  “It’s a highly public event, and the security—”
“Shut up,” he gasps.  “Just, just shut up for a second, I think I hear—”
Sherlock turned to John, needing to speak, finding the words stuck in his throat.  John’s gaze was fixed on the corner.  His hands rested limply at his sides.  Only hours ago, those same hands had dragged Sherlock out of a nightmare.  They had anchored him, unraveled him, stitched him back together.
“Whoever hired you doesn’t care if you’re caught,” John said as the realization dawned.
For all his powerlessness, Lestrade would not be shown up on his home turf.  Sherlock and John arrived at the Council Tower to find a group of the Met’s worst and dimmest awaiting them.  Anderson and Donovan stood at the head of the pack, directing their underlings with snappy glee.
“Oh, I don’t know about that,” said John.  “I seem to do it fairly often.”  He was quiet for a moment, clasping his hands in his lap.  Then he said, “I know you’re busy being Moriarty and all, but I thought you would do me a favor, given the, ah.  Circumstances.”
Aside from the necessity of simply moving, he had never thought the transport crucial to the Work.  Now – with his fingers itching to thread through short, silvery hair, his arms to entwine, his lips to press and taste and explore – Sherlock realizes that he is utterly crippled without it.
claim a new victim, he won’t have his sister to help him escape.  No, Sherlock doubts Peter is a natural-born killer.  He is a puppet, and now his strings have been cut.
John cocks his head to one side, brow creasing.  “What?”
“Because I checked.  That’s what took me a little more time. Hacking into those systems was easy enough, but tracking and eliminating the fakes was another matter.  ‘Sides, I’ve got other jobs on.”
Sherlock was beset by the Yard the moment he stepped out of Roland-Kerr Further Education College.  They hurried him to an emergency van and draped a violently orange blanket over his shoulders. As officers milled about, cordoning off the area, Lestrade strolled to Sherlock’s side.
“With Dr. Watson,” clarified Mycroft.  As if Sherlock carried on so many
John flinched as if he’d been slapped.  He clutched Rosie closer to his chest and she whimpered, his alarm feeding into hers.  “You can’t.  You can’t take her.”
A long pause.  And then his phone chimes with the answer:
“A confessional,” he breathes.  “And here I thought you would feel too guilty for that.”
“You’ve,” he says, stops.  His voice is a little hoarse.  “You’ve got pine needles in your hair.  It smells—”
Sherlock uses his free hand to shove the chocolate into his mouth, chewing ponderously.  His fingers are sticky and warm as he selects another candy from the box and presses it into John’s hand.  “Praline.”
“Come up,” Sherlock repeated.  “But your case had better be interesting, or I’m going to be very cross.”
“Shut up,” Sherlock spat.
Sherlock side-eyes John.  “That was bold of you.”
“Drebber and Stangerson?” Donovan cuts in.  “We know where they are.  CCTV caught them leaving the Tube at Paddington.  They matched Mr. Ferrier’s descriptions perfectly.  We’ve got officers on the way now.”
“Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Lucy…”
A compulsion gripped John; against his better judgement, he reached out and squeezed Alexander’s shoulder.  The contact was light and brief, but he hoped it said what he couldn’t.
They are quiet for a time.  Sherlock mirrors John and turns onto his side so they lie with their chests pressed together.  He can feel John’s heartbeat this way, feel it fall into time with his own.
Sherlock nods.  John can have anything, everything.  Even Sherlock’s admission to feelings in writing, if he really wants it.
The following day and a half were an exercise in futility.  After arriving and leaving their belongings at the inn, Sherlock and John went to meet the police – headed by the venerable DI Ferguson – at the crime scene.  Ferguson, briefed on Sherlock’s methods by Lestrade, had been amicable, if a trifle put-upon.  In his mind, McFarlane was already behind bars.
Damn it all.  John knows when he’s well and truly fucked.
“But—”
John’s eyes were downcast.  “You see, I don’t… I don’t remember.  Most of it. They took it away from me.”
for scarcely two days before Lucy Ferrier missed a scheduled meeting with them.  She had planned to introduce them to her boyfriend, Jeff.  Sherlock and John had been waiting for an hour with no word from her when a knock thundered against the door of 221B.
“Found new evidence,” he drawls as they walk toward Oldacre’s house.  The building perches on the edge of a slight rise in the earth, its rooftop looming over the surrounding trees.  Sherlock is reminded of a fairy tale John once told him – of a witch who lived in a cottage with legs, allowing her to hunt for wayward children in her forest from the comfort of home.  A silly story, really, but Sherlock tastes the grit of guilt and banishes the thought.
John is silent for a long moment.  Then, a muscle twitching in his jaw, he nods again.  “Right, well.  Thanks.”
Sherlock exclaims.  “Haven’t you been listening to anything I’ve said? The shampoo wasn’t poisoned.  It was obviously the skin cream!”
And hesitates.
“…The baby spreads out its arms and legs, slowly retracts them, and cries,” finished Sherlock.  “Presumably, it’s a relic from our tree-dwelling ancestors.  If they fell, they needed something to cling to.”
“Yeah, her,” says Lestrade.  “’Spect she’ll be helpful tracking down the brother.  But you lot can go.”  He nods meaningfully at Rosie, still hiding in her father’s jacket.  “Get her sorted.”
“Stabbed through the eye with a sharpened candy cane,” pronounces John.  “Christ.”
“You saw me having a nightmare, just now.  Possibly more than one.”
Sherlock harrumphs and turns back to the telly.  He hopes John won’t be cross with him for not putting Rosie to bed.  If John is cross, John might keep the stern doctoring and withhold the gentle touches.
Piggy’s glare morphs into befuddlement.  “Wot’s that mean?”
“You shouldn’t have done that,” said the other one.  “Send him back.”
“Good night, John.”  He turns and stalks down the corridor.  The door closes behind him, and he is gone.
of course I do.”  John looks away from the scar.  “I only—I don’t want to ruin this before.  Before it’s properly begun.”
“I was just leaving,” Sherlock said quickly.  “Meeting with my lawyer about the Basingstoke estate.”  He began pivoting with his crutches, stopped, and pivoted back.  “Are you… comfortable?  Will you be able to…”
“Sherlock.”  John’s voice nudges at him.  A smile quirks his (
It is only then, casting thoughtlessly about for the doorknob, that Sherlock realizes they are standing on the stoop of 221B.  His thoughts screech to a halt.  He stares.  “What?”
“Don’t be a baby,” John says, spearing a chunk of watermelon on his fork. “Eat up, now.  I want you getting those amino acids.”
Sherlock was brought up short by the sight of John.  The doctor was seated on the sofa, head bent, gaze vacant.  A teacup and saucer tilted precariously in his lax grip.  Steam wafted out of the hot drink, curling into a thin wisp.  Reluctantly, Sherlock went to his side and ghosted his fingers over John’s shoulder.  John tensed; tea lapped over the rim of the cup.
, as Mary held a gun to his daughter’s temple.
John was about to make a quip when Moriarty’s voice burst their bubble.  “In those files, you’ll find enough evidence to put Rosamund Adelbert in the highest-security prison you can find for the rest of her days.”
“John.”
“Understandable,” said Alexander with a nod, “but I’m not a complete stranger, am I?  I’ve known Sherlock for a few months now.”
“Yeah, yeah,” John says, his aggrieved look belied by giggles.  “I—I suppose it’s because…”  He kneads fingertips against his temples, a grin stretching across his face.  “Because you’re so bloody
“She was meddling,” Sherlock says, understanding dawning.
“I don’t know, sometimes.”  John says it like a confession.  “I’m sorry I can’t give you a simple answer.”
A pause.  When John speaks, his voice is neutral, his words chosen with care.  “Well.  You’re different, I suppose.”
On the second bus ride toward Paddington, John said, “Chelsea first?”
Sherlock doesn’t think – doesn’t
Just as the case was rounding up to a solid seven – ciphers and smuggling and murder, oh my – John announced he had a date.
John sighs.  “I wish I could, really.  But I’ve got that shift at the clinic.”
John tenses.  Sherlock’s attention jumps to Pepper.  “The what?”
Sherlock can think of nothing to say.  At his side, John moves fractionally closer, offering the comfort of proximity.
Sherlock wants to take John’s face in his hands and kiss him.  Instead, he lets the persistent smile have its way.  He chases a crouton onto vinegar-glazed spinach leaves and eats the lot with relish.  John watches as his throat bobs with the movement of swallowing.
Never before had John so appreciated the command those three words held over a crowd.  People stepped aside, instinctively obeying his command.  A path opened.  Terror gripped John.
“I can’t,” Sherlock blurts out.
“What?” Sherlock mumbled.
John’s puzzlement vanishes, replaced by sad understanding.  “Sherlock.”  He covers their joined hands with the other, cradling Sherlock like he would a fragile creature.  “Rosie has known you all her life.  You’re more of a parent to her than Mary ever was.”
Sherlock yawns and shrugs, as if uncertain.  He tilts his head, curls tumbling back from his brow, and says simply, “She’s alive.  That’s good.”
“An exotic dancer and a nuclear physicist,” John mused.  “Wonder what growing up in that family was like.”
“Mycroft.”  John’s voice was hollow.  Mycroft turned back with a questioning look.  “Promise me you’ll keep Rosie safe.”
Violet draws a slow breath and continues.  She had been a month in Carruthers’s employ when his business partner, Mr. Woodley, arrived at the house.  “He unnerved me.  Always getting a little too close, always finding excuses to touch me.  Casual touches, of course, but…”  She shivers.  “…they lingered.
“Pity Sylvius didn’t manage to kill him,” Winter sighed.
A pair of German tourists shoulder past him, tugging Sherlock into the current.  He spins and dives in; best to get this over with, and quickly.  Discomfort prickles at the back of his neck as he squeezes through the throng.  Bodies all around radiate the sweaty stink of close confinement.  Sherlock is no stranger to crowds – he lives in London, after all – but there is a reason he spends exorbitant fees on cabs.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Great,” said Lestrade.  He turned and vanished back down the hall.
Yeah.  Pick me up something that won’t go off too soon, yeah? I can have it for lunch tomorrow.
The killer throws Catherine to the ground and her head bounces against the pavement.  Sherlock lunges toward her, but with a lumbering step, Father Christmas blocks his way and raises the baseball bat above his head.  Sherlock raises his arm to block and the strike explodes through his bones.   Clouds fill his vision and he doubles over on his knees.
“Sherlock…” He began, but could think of nothing to say.
“You’re a liar.”
“What is it?” Rosie demands, bouncing around Mrs. Hudson.  “What is it?  What is it?”
Sherlock continues to stare at the laptop, a plan coalescing before his eyes. Before John, he had thought love was a chemical defect.  But perhaps his perception had been too narrow, his mind too unyielding for the unbiased scope of scientific research.  This is love, he realizes, stripped down to the barest essentials permitted by a cold, unfeeling world.  Natural. Animalistic.
“We need,” John began, then fell silent.  Worked past the lump in his throat.  “We need to name her.”  One of many decisions they hadn’t reached in the month since Magnussen’s demise.  “I thought maybe Cather—”
“Partially.”
Later, Sherlock learned that his disappearance was not a solitary event.  On that day – the twenty-first of June, in the year 1984 – a total of one-hundred children in the United Kingdom were spirited away to Faerie.  Crossing streets and walking through doors, stepping over streams and tromping, heedless, through mushroom rings.  They were plucked out of the human world with as little fanfare as ripe apples being plucked from the tree.
John stiffened and looked at Sherlock.  Seeing the suspicion written on his face, Sherlock hastened to say, “This building is abandoned.  You have no clients here.”
As I’m sure many of you noticed, I borrowed and tweaked the famous Sherlock Holmes quote from A Study in Scarlet :  "There's the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it."  I hope you look at this as an homage rather than blatant plagiarism.  ☺
Sherlock, eager to steer the conversation away from John, said, “You know who that man was.  The one who broke into Nathan Garrideb’s shop and assaulted Alexander.”
Something about the DI’s certainty nettled Sherlock.  It wasn’t smugness, not exactly – Ferguson knew what he was about. No, it was that insidious strain of
Sherlock loves John.  Sometimes he’s terrified by how much he loves John, but there it is.  Irrefutable.
So, when Mrs. Hudson tells him, “Marriage is hard work,” he dismisses her out of hand.
They find her sitting cross-legged on the floor, having taken her stocking from its nail above the fireplace.  The disgorged stocking lays limply at Rosie’s side as she tears open a bag of Maltesers and dumps the candies into her palm.
The thought rankles him.  “Spit it out, whatever’s got you so excited.  I’ll be happy to prove you wrong.”
Sherlock nods.  John’s brow furrows, worry shadowing his gaze.  “You okay?”
“No.”  John’s reasoning is sound; without Catherine’s will to sway him, Peter is likely harmless.  If he
you found the counterfeiter’s hideout.  By then, it was almost too late for me to help.”  An edge of anger cuts into his tone.  “When I saw those, those
Sherlock bursts through the trees where Father Christmas vanished, finding himself between two rows of spruce.  He spins on his heel, swiveling his gaze up and down the path.
“Yes, I’m aware of that.”
“Dr. Watson.”  Mycroft’s tone is patient but firm.  “What is your decision?”
“Sherlock?”  Lestrade’s voice is wary.  “You all right?”
“I did, and I have,” John replies.
When they arrive at the flat, John pays the fare and ushers Sherlock out of the cab.  Sherlock lets himself be led, hating his frailty but secretly pleased by the pressure of John’s hand at the small of his back.  Once they ascend the stairs and the door of 221B closes behind them, Sherlock sheds his coat, letting it puddle on the floor.
The man fished his mobile out of his pocket.  “Er, here.  Use mine.”
I have no Beta or Britpicker, so if you notice any mistakes, let me know and I can correct them.  Thanks! :)
Sherlock rounded on Jefferson Hope.  The cabbie’s body lay crumpled on the floor, a pool of blood widening around him.  Crimson blotted the front of his jumper: a fatal shot, clean through the heart. Hope’s eyes roved about in bewilderment.  He made a wet, wheezing noise.
Sherlock closes the distance between them in slow, measured steps.  He reaches out a gloved hand and Peter takes it.  Sherlock can feel trembles coursing up the big man’s arm.
“Really?” he breathes.
an Ethernet cable), Sherlock prepares.  He jumps into the shower and scrubs himself red-raw, paying particular attention to certain bits he hopes John will play with.
John’s eyes narrow.  “See, I know that’s a lie because I
Sherlock looks down at their joined hands.  “Aren’t you worried?  About Watson?”
“Thank you,” he mumbles.  “And… I’m sorry.”
“Mating, obviously,” says Sherlock.
Sherlock, Alexander, and Craig stared at John in a hush of surprise.  Sherlock was the first to recover; his lip curled in a sneer and he shouldered past, striding into the hallway and out the door without a word.
Deflating with relief, Rosie darts forward, flings her arms around his legs in an approximation of a hug, and darts away before Sherlock can process what has just occurred.  He blinks several times and watches her settle beside her castle, rummaging through the miniature rooms for their inhabitants.  Sullivan the tiger sits at her side, ever-vigilant.
Sherlock thinks back to the events of the past day.  Twenty minutes after being thrown in the lake, the Yard – summoned when Sherlock phoned – arrived on the scene with an ambulance in tow.  According to them, he had been lying on the shore, sodden and crusted with frost, but fortunately undrowned.  He was promptly whisked to hospital, where he was diagnosed yet again with hypothermia and treated accordingly.  His brain was miraculously unscathed, though the doctors insisted on monitoring him for several hours.  John, having arrived shortly after Sherlock, presided over his care in stony silence.  Only later, cloistered in the privacy of 221B – later being, of course,
“Dunno.  I haven’t been keeping tabs on him.”
“McFarlane’s MePhone app had previously traced a trail to the stream.” Ferguson points down the slope, where an offshoot of the Kinlea Burn flows, placidly unaware of the havoc wreaked on its banks.  “Didn’t find anything the first time around, but upon closer inspection, we found this.” He fishes an evidence bag from his pocket and hands it to Sherlock.
John groaned and kissed him, fevered and deep.  Sherlock clutched at him, winding long fingers through his hair.  John’s cock jerked in his trousers and he broke away to undo his flies.  Sherlock panted, each breath punching an echo out of him, “John, John,
“Sherlock?”
“I invent nightmares.  Like with the Hound.”
Uncertainty flashed across Wiggins’ face.  “S’not… s’not so easy.  Got in with these people by mistake.  Now I can’t get out.  Your brother hasn’t tracked ‘em down yet.”
At last, John turns to him, expression solemn.  “Sherlock.”
Gritting his teeth – hating that he felt guilty, that he needed
“Yes,” Sherlock rasps.  “F-for God’s sake,
“Please,” Sherlock sneered, “you don’t know the meaning of the word.”
“Come and see the pieces with me,” said Lady Smallwood.  She slipped her hand into the crook of Sherlock’s elbow and lead him through the throng.  The artworks were arranged in neat rows cordoned off by delicate chain links.  Moonlight poured through great bay windows, washing marble, wood, and paint in a silver sheen.  “I never thanked you for the business with Charles Augustus Magnussen.”
“Yes, there…”  Sherlock glances at John, glimpses amused mortification beyond a thin veneer of composure.  “I thought there was a snake in my bed.”
“He found out he was sick a few months in,” says Violet.  “Lung cancer.  Very aggressive.”  Her lips thin into a bloodless line.  “He’s dead now.”
“Sherlock?”  John’s voice is close, too close.  “You all right?  Did I—”
“Faster,” John grunts.  “Sherlock, I need you to—”
“Maybe,” the DI said coolly, “his
“And the mother of his child,” Mycroft said.  “Dr. Watson wants Mary removed from his life, but the moment he considered the consequences, he lost his conviction.  The notion of his child growing up without both parents unnerves him.  No doubt because his own father was an absent drunkard.”
Sherlock stood ramrod-straight in the middle of the sitting room, his expression pinched.  His hands were clasped behind his back.  “John.”
Carruthers’s eyes flick to Sherlock and widen.  “I know you from the papers.  You’re the detective.  Sherlock Holmes.”  He glowers at John.  “Who the hell are you?”
“Precisely.”  Sherlock twirls the pencil between his fingers.  “Perhaps he can bring you a pair of walkie-talkies.”
“I…”  Sherlock trails off, suddenly parched.  He takes a steaming gulp of tea, winces as his throat smarts.  “I might be,” he rasps.
John chuckles, but the mirth doesn’t reach his eyes.  “’Course.  Stupid of me.”
” Mary hissed.  “I will
Sherlock tears through a narrow footpath and erupts into a clearing.  The trees form a semicircle, their leaves carpeting the soft earth. In the middle of the clearing, two men have Violet pinned to the ground, their backs to Sherlock.  One – a sneering man with a ginger mustache – holds Violet’s shoulder with one hand and brandishes a knife with the other.  The blade point hovers an inch from her eye. The second man crouches between her spread legs, struggling with her trousers.
John had asked, appalled.
“Mary gave me a memory stick with those initials when we discovered who she really was.  I threw it away.  I wanted to try again with her.  For Rosie.”  Sorrow splintered through John at the reminder of his daughter’s absence.  He pushed past it.  “So, you’re the A.G. of A.G.R.A..  And Mary is Rosamund…”
“Hello?  Um, yes.  Yes, quite well, thank you.  As good as can be expected.  Um, listen.  I know I’m probably the last person you want to talk to, and I completely understand that, but.  I’m… I’m not sorry for what I did.  Not about Mary, anyway.  You know neither of us would have ever seen her again if she’d gotten away.  I still believe that, in her way, she loves… loved Rosie.  But Rosie wasn’t…  Yes.  Okay.  Yes.  Greg and Molly told me, yeah.  Thank you for that.  And thank you for… what you did.  Saved me and Sherlock, probably.  Hm.  Oh, you’ve seen him?  Is he…  No, he hasn’t.  Christ, I don’t know.  I’m not a bloody prophet.  He’s always leagues ahead of the rest of us, so why bother trying if I’m just going to look like an idiot?  …Sorry.  Been stuck in hospital for nearly two weeks.  It does things to your head.  Anyway, um.  I wanted to ask you… Christ.  I can’t believe I’m even considering this.  It’s mad.  Um, yes.  But, look, before I say anything, you need to know that you can take time to… consider.  I’ll need time, too.  I just wanted to put the thought out there.  Well, it is huge.  Jesus.  I still can’t… no.  Just got to say it.  Sorry, talking to myself.  It’s mad.  This is all mad.  But I’ve given it a lot of thought.  I can’t do it myself.  So, um.  Here it is.”
Faint nail scoring on his neck suggests nervous tic, fingernails stained from repeatedly inducing vomiting…”
“Sherlock,” John said, “we need to go.  You can explain everything in the cab.”
“And…”  The doctor paused, shuffling his feet.  Chewed on the inside of his cheek.  “Your mental health may suffer as well.  Nightmares, hallucinations, that sort of thing.  In particular, we should monitor for symptoms of PTSD.  I will refer you to a few therapists that I… Mr. Watson?  Mr. Watson, are you laughing?”
Sherlock rushed to fill the space.  “I know she already has one,” he said, “but I was doing some research and this model is top of the line, far superior to the old one.  Conforms to all the current safety standards and converts to a toddler bed.  It could even be converted to a teenager bed, if we get the frame and mattress.”
I have no Beta or Britpicker, so if you spot mistakes, please let me know and I can correct them.  :)
“If you would be so kind as to sit, Ms. Cathy,” Sherlock begins.
John saves the manuscript on his laptop – an easy target.  The moment he leaves for a shift at the clinic, Sherlock has the laptop out and the file open.
beautiful, you should see the bloke I’m married to.”
And then Sherlock Holmes
John pressed his lips into a thin line.  He could think of nothing to say.
“We were at uni together,” said Sebastian Wilkes.  Leaning back in his chair with legs crossed and fingers interlinked, he squinted at Sherlock as if trying to detect a slight of hand.  “This guy here had a trick he used to do.”
Sherlock sighs, but he’s fighting to suppress a smile.  It’s a little daunting to watch them together, bickering and hand-holding and loving.  For all his derision of romanticism, Sherlock Holmes is completely imbued with it – one half of a whole, incapable of existing as a single unit.
“That’s because we’re standing beside a bloody lake!”
His hand flexed with a phantom sensation.  It had been a joke, among him and his army mates, that in Maiwand you could scrub and scrub in the shower but you’d find sand behind your bollocks the second you stepped out of the stall.
“Oh.”  John blinks once, twice.  He’s been caught off his guard, getting what he wants so easily.  “Um.  You’re sure?”
“Anything,” Sherlock said.  “As long as you have the key, any message in any language can be decoded.  We simply need to translate a language of objects into words.”  He paused and drummed the pads of his fingers together.  “I need another look at Sylvius’ chair.”
A moment of silence.  Then, a weary sigh.  “Hello, Sherlock.”
But this experiment was more delicate still.  In order for the charm to work – and to work
John drew back, his hand slipping away from Sherlock’s.  He cleared his throat.  “Well.  Your hand will be all right, I think – cut wasn’t too deep.  You got lucky, though.”  A brittle laugh.  “Try not to grab any more knives, yeah?”
“Y-yes,” Sherlock stammers, and stalks past them without a word of farewell.
“What in God’s name—Sherlock?  You in here?”
A soft sadness settles over John’s features, though they are no less fond than they were seconds ago.  “Seriously, Sherlock.  You’ll try?”
“I was six.”
John looks at him.  Feeling his anger crumble into shame, Sherlock drops his eyes to the tabletop.  “I’m… sorry.”
“Honestly.”  Rolling his eyes, John turns toward the kitchen, maintaining the drunkard’s gait. “Let’s see what your mummy left you for dinner, shall we, Sophie?”
“If I’d let you go after her,” Sherlock says, and it’s like a door has opened inside him, giving liberty to the gnawing, ravaging fears, “she might have—”
John hastens to fill the space.  “I know we’ve only been doing this for a couple of weeks, but it still feels like… like we’ve wasted time.  So.  I’d like to stop doing that.”  He pushes back the hair on Sherlock’s brow.  “I’d like to just… love you.  If you’re amenable, that is.”
Desperation broke through Sherlock’s dazed mind as John shifted, reaching for his arm.  Without thinking – without letting himself think – Sherlock surged forward, seizing the knife by the blade with one hand.  His other hand dove into John’s pocket and closed around something thin, metallic.  Pain bloomed as he pulled the knife aside and wrenched the object from John’s pocket.  Jackknifing his body, Sherlock clamped his knees around John’s torso and threw his weight to the side.  The world spun in a haze of momentum and pain, and after a frantic scramble, Sherlock found himself kneeling above John.  He released the knife and jumped to his feet, bolting toward Moriarty.  He drew back his arm and swung with all his might.
Six months after the wedding, Molly gives birth to a girl.  They call her Sophie.  Sherlock and John are chosen to be Sophie’s godparents.  John goes all dewy-eyed and wobbly at the pronouncement, utterly failing in his duty as an Englishman to keep that stiff upper lip. Sherlock manages, but only just. A part of him suspects Molly knows about his and John’s little barn tryst, and she is bequeathing godparent duties as punishment.
It’s not a game anymore.
Sherlock thought of the mazikeen up in 221B, of his flat, vacant eyes.  He dismissed the idea immediately. If Hope was suicidal, he wouldn’t waste time making other people kill themselves.
,” Mycroft said slowly, as though to a dim child.  “This is nothing of the kind.  This is… indolent.  Sloppy.”
“Some might say a little too long,” Mycroft retorted.
Later, they huddle beneath the duvet, clean and warm and still a little drunk on endorphins.  John lays his fingers across Sherlock’s collarbone and smiles.
Silence.
John stares back with a mortified sort of shock.  He recovers, sets his jaw.  “I—I said I didn’t have to—”
Sherlock rose from his chair and went to John, possessed by a need to soothe, to gentle and touch.  He stopped short of the last and shoved his hands into the pockets of his dressing gown with his fingers biting at the insides of his palms.  “Mycroft’s safe houses are next to impenetrable.  Rosamund couldn’t be anywhere safer.”
Sherlock glowers at the sheet of paper.  “Make your father do it.”
“Okay.”  It took a great effort, but the smile John offered Sherlock was not entirely false.  “Try not to be back too late, yeah?”
John’s steady gait descended the stairs, accompanied by his cheerful tone. A restful night, then – no nightmares to plague him, no blood or sand or the stink of gunpowder.  “A client?”
John glances at Sherlock, the question plain on his face.  Sherlock flicks his gaze over Ms. Helens, collecting data, searching for evidence of a threat.  None is forthcoming, but Sherlock
“Stop brooding, John,” said Sherlock.  “There’s no way Mary could be hunting us right now.”
Sherlock eases out a long breath, watches it plume in the air.  Is it cold?  He can’t tell.  His face is flushed.
“Of course,” says John.  “We’d be mad not to.”  He glances down at Sherlock’s shirt.  “That’ll have to be laundered.”
“I’m fine.”
Sherlock grunts vaguely.  “Hadn’t noticed.”
John mutters, face red.  “Well, from now on, keep it on you at all times.  Best to be prepared.”
John rubbed the nape of his neck.  “It’s… it’s got to do with my talisman.  The, um. The magnifying glass.”
“Hurry, John,” Sherlock rasped.  “I want to see it.  The look on your face.”
Because, really, that John could predict the trajectory of a falling icicle is as ridiculous as it is incredible.  Down to the look of surprise frozen on Catherine’s face in death, it’s purely ridiculous.
A pause.  Then:
“We have all kinds of delicacies here,” said Eirene, ignoring him.  “Larks drowned in mead.  Fertilized duck eggs.  Viper wine.”
You may have noticed that I've changed the spelling from "fey" to "Fae."  Apologies for the inconsistencies, but I'll stick to this one from here on out.
A dawning sense of clarity comes over John.  It’s as if he has been comatose for a long time, trapped in a mire between sleep and waking.  But now he’s awake, and he can’t believe he’s been such a bloody fool for so long.
“You’re better at all that nice nonsense,” said Sherlock.
.  They had passed the officers and stood before a corpse – male, mid-fifties or early sixties, podgy in his black trousers and button-up.  A loosened tie exposed his throat.
“No,” said Sherlock tersely.  “John and I are busy.”  Then, with a thin veneer of condescension, “You solve it.  It is the dullest part of London, after all.”
They lapse into silence for a moment.  Then, still a little baffled, Sherlock ventures, “So… friends with benefits.”
That night, John had been as helpless as a mouse in the talons of an owl. He had never felt like that when he caught Sherlock watching him sleep.  Annoyed, maybe.  Certainly
“I know,” says Sherlock.
!” Sherlock cries petulantly.  “You can’t say filthy things about putting your fingers and your tongue in my arse and then not
The woman holding Sherlock raised her voice above the rest, pride honeying her words.  “Do you see his eyes?  Look, they are like shards of silver.  See how finely he is made?”
It’s a monstrosity, a trail of blood slicking through all the foulest scum humanity has to offer.  It’s a horror that cuts to the core of Sherlock, no matter how indifferent he tries to appear.
He comes to with a choking gasp, lungs raw as he drags in breath after breath of icy air.  He’s lying on a cold, hard surface, a glaze of frost clinging to his cheek.  The darkness surrounding him is as deep and impenetrable as an abyss.  Not even the merest sliver of light can be seen.
Wait.
John says nothing for a beat.  Then, with a put-upon sigh, he nestles close and rests his face at the crook of Sherlock’s neck.  “Fine, but if you kick me in the night, I
“Sod them,” John said.  “We’re going back to Baker Street, and I don’t want anyone who isn’t you, me, Rosie, or Mrs. Hudson so much as straightening the bloody door knocker until we’ve had some rest and…”  He paused, curbing an urge to look in the direction of Lady Smallwood’s body.  “…gotten all this sorted.”
of the man," he repeats.  "Never done anything to him.  And here he was, planning to take my life apart."
Sherlock feels a blush creep up his neck.  Clearing his throat, he stands and strides over to the tree.  He gathers the remaining gifts – one for John, one for himself, and a last one for Rosie – and brings them back to the fireplace.  Wordlessly, he hands John his box and sits.  John quirks a brow and tugs at the ribbon.
“I’ll find out on my own if you don’t tell me,” says Sherlock.
Alexander lapsed into a hush, eyes narrowed, as if he suspected the consulting detective was lying.  Sherlock watched as his stare slipped away and moved around the room, dropping onto blackened spoons and mugs of used syringes.
“Right,” John said.  Sherlock glanced at Alexander as they left the back room.   He and Rosie shrank into the distance as they walked before shelves edged into view, cutting off pieces of Alexander with the distorted silhouettes of baubles – here a mask, there an inkpot.  The shapes drew around Rosie like a jigsaw puzzle – and then she was gone, swallowed by the shop as Sherlock closed the front door behind them.

“I certainly won’t claim to be innocent,” said Sherlock, adopting a lofty tone.  “But at least I control my usage.  That’s a fair sight better than you or your sister.”
“You can,” he mumbles, “if you want.”
“Look,” said John.  “I don’t know what your issue is, but I only want to help.”

to behold.
John’s knuckles whiten around Cotton Bud’s wrist and the thug whimpers. John looms over him and skewers him with the look of a hawk honing in on a rat.  “Is that right?”
“All I need right now is my mouth,” Sherlock states.
“Dull, dull, dull,” the second man mutters.  “Mrs. Hudson, if we were half as fascinated by our kitchen as you appear to be, we certainly wouldn’t be taking two-hour train rides out of our way to avoid it.”
Elise stands in the doorway, smiling politely.  She cocks her head to the side.  “Have I come at a bad time?”
Sliding the magnifier open, Sherlock turns his attention to the corpse, leaning as close as he can without losing his balance and mucking up the evidence.  Charles Porter has been dead for hours; the elements have sapped all the heat from his body, rendering him an icy slab.
John shook his head, jaw set.  “No.”
“Yes.”  Sherlock gestures at Piggy and Cotton Bud with the switchblade.  “If it weren’t for Wilkinson’s lot, we would have never sorted ourselves out.”
“What’s that?”
John shrugs.  “My immune system is tougher.  I work around sick people for a living, after all.”
hairy against the tabletop.
A few paces down the hallway, the fear caught him in its grip.  John strode back toward Rosie’s room on silent feet.  Hearing Mary’s voice, low and crooning, he stopped just beyond the door.
fed into them, made them as strong as steel.
“That—that isn’t—”  Seb flounders.  He takes the redhead’s shoulder.  “Let’s go talk in private, okay?”
– did John’s temper reach the end of its fuse.
“You couldn’t be bothered to see my daughter because you were off getting high,” John seethed.  Sherlock’s gaze snapped back to him.  “You couldn’t be bothered to call me—us.  Mary’s been worried too, you know.”
Rosie’s interest in the snake evaporates and she nods, tossing Sherlock a knowing look and racing back out the door.
but if he waits an instant longer, the—the
“Oh, my boys,” Mrs. Hudson wobbles, dabbing at her eyes.
No, Sherlock doesn’t think of these things.  And for that, he will blame himself.
John’s hand drifts to his chest, rests over his beating heart.  “Happy anniversary, love.”
Sherlock grips John’s wrists.  “I won’t—I will try.  I swear, John, I’ll try to—I won’t go…”
Sherlock’s lips part, eyelashes fanning – and then the smile vanishes, replaced by fear.
“’Course, darling,” says John.  Rosie sets upon the gift with animal ferocity, tearing away crimped ribbons and confetti bows and gleaming paper.  She squeals as the brand of a toy company peeps through the ripped paper.  A toy castle of some sort.
“Helen said I wasn't totally useless last time,” she explained.  “Frankly, I think she’s desperate to take any help she can get…”
And, placing her hand at the small of his back, she pushed him into the water.
And then: a scuffling sound, magnified in the freezing air.  Sherlock stiffens, squinting, but the darkness is utterly complete.  He settles for straining his ears and holding his breath, and
“You don’t have to,” John calls after her, but she’s already gone.  Chuckling, he shakes his head and glances at Rosie.  She is completely immersed in what appears to be a reenactment of the Siege of Leningrad.  Furtively, John leans forward and presses a kiss to Sherlock’s cheek.  “Thank you.  It’s a wonderful gift.”
“Well.”  His lips twist, fighting back a giggle.  “A fanny.”
“I—sorry,” says John.  “I didn’t think—”
Sherlock rolled off of him.  His heart thudded with the urgency of cheating death.  “Sorry.”
“Yeah.”  She whispers the words against his neck.  “You look soft.  Vulnerable.”
“How often have I said it, John?” Sherlock murmured.  “’When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.’”  At John’s watery, disbelieving laugh, his lips twitched and he pressed on.  “I’ve applied my methods of deduction to this like I would any other case, and the outcome is clear.  I thought I was a machine.  Cold, analytical, unhampered by emotion.  I had only ever wanted the cases, the work.
“I realized, on the plane,” Sherlock says, “I don’t want to die.”
“Oh.  Christ.” John tugs up his collar and glances at Sherlock.  “I thought we were doing well.”
“That’s enough,” Sherlock interjected, avoiding John’s eye.  “We can’t go back and change the past, so it’s pointless to argue about it.  We
He is woken from his dozing by the dip of the mattress as John climbs into bed. He lifts the duvet in silent welcome. John huddles close, clad in a t-shirt and boxers, warm and damp from the shower.  Sherlock noses blindly at the crook of his neck.
Sherlock thinks,
John turns to me.  “It’s a long story.  And it will hurt.  But… it’s a story you deserve to hear.”  He slips his hand into Sherlock’s again, threading their fingers together.  Sherlock looks at John and nods.  His soft, silver-green gaze seems to say,
John’s thoughts turned to the papers Mycroft had given him, the papers meant to erase Mary and give Rosie a new mother.  Between those pages lay a fantasy:  a new life.
“Yes, Watson?”
“I love you too.”  Another kiss, this one on his lips.  Sherlock melts into it, kissing with as much fervor as his overtaxed mind and body can give. They part, and John says, “Go to sleep, love.”
Sherlock’s breath plumes in the icy air as he follows Lestrade down a cobbled lane with John in tow.  Fairy lights festoon the stalls around them, glowing like so many threads of starlight.  The ripe smell of the river is diluted by the scents of spices, ciders, and sugared pastries steaming from the fryers.  People – police officers, mostly – natter incessantly, creating a pleasant buzz of white noise.
“The wigs,
“You don’t need to tell me this.”
He could do all of that – if he put his and Sherlock’s lives over that of an unborn child.
“Ah.”
I'm Zingiberis on Tumblr.
“The killer caught him by surprise,” chimes in Anderson.  Sherlock sees the evidence, watches Edmund Brown’s murder play out in his mind’s eye.  A bruise on the top of his balding head suggests that he was struck from behind – a fierce, downward blow with a blunt instrument, dazing him long enough to get the rope around his neck.  Said rope had already been slung over the tree branch, so it was simply a matter of pulling on the trailing end to hang Brown.
“Hm.  No.” His hand moves from Sherlock’s knee, skirts up his thigh.  The pilled cotton of his sweatpants rasps against his palm.  “Yeah?”
Mycroft’s lips twitched into a faint, fleeting smile.  “Thank you.”
John looks at him then, eyebrows raised in a sham of puzzlement. “Go?  Go where?”
The door flies open and Rosie rushes inside.  “Sherlock, it’s Chri—Daddy?”
“The fellow looking after her,” explained Lestrade, “and Mr. Garrideb.  Seems like a man broke in and tried to rob the shop.  We aren’t clear on the details, but…”
A smile pulled at the corners of John’s mouth.  “You’d never leave London, I bet.”
“So… the chairs with textured legs have GPS devices,” John surmised.
“I do.”  Sherlock is emboldened.  “I like them.”
John wouldn’t let the matter drop.  “Can’t believe you were friends with him.”
list.
“John,” says Sherlock.
Sherlock’s hands curl into fists, fingernails biting into his palms. Peter escaped in the chaos following his sister’s death.  Skewered by the fallen icicle, Catherine had died swiftly – a better death than she deserved.  The same courtesy hadn’t been afforded to Theresa Goodwin, crushed to death beneath a pile of coal.  It hadn’t been afforded to Edmund Brown, strung up in a mockery of decorating a Christmas tree.
theories?”
“No,” says John, “you’re not.  Exhausting and starving yourself won’t help us find Lucy.”
John kicks the duvet away and clambers upright with a wince.  He holds the duvet in front of him:  a censoring screen.  “H-hullo, darling.”
“Just for the week,” he said to Molly.
“Fitting, considering you are one,” Sherlock says under his breath.
“Of course I am,” says John.  “But I know you worry about her, too.  You… you love her, and you’ve helped me raise her over the past four years.  You deserve to be a part of your life, if…”  He trails off, suddenly unsure.  “If you want.”
he wants to add, but holds his tongue.  Rosie’s gotten herself into enough trouble without him making mischief on her behalf.
Chaos greeted him.  Chairs overturned, the boxes of Lukis’ and Van Coon’s books upended, spines broken and pages ripped.   Shards of glass glinted in the lamplight streaming through the sitting room window; Mrs. Hudson’s pitcher, smashed.  Orange slices were scattered around a stain of punch. Sherlock remembered the smell of Su Lin’s tea and felt his throat close.
“Oh, once or twice,” said Mrs. Hudson.  “
“Sherlock will come ‘round,” said Mrs. Hudson.  “I know he will.”
“I am,” said Sherlock.
“John.”  Sherlock sat, leaving a handspan of space between John’s left thigh and his right.  He yearned to close that distance, but something held him back.  “I need your help on this case.”  John’s unreadable eyes found him and he heaved a sigh.  “Besides, I’ve worked with hundreds of people who have wanted to deck me.  And I’ve been in my share of fights.  You did nothing I haven’t managed before.”
Molly and Greg visited the next day bearing gifts:  flowers (Molly), a stale cheese and tomato pasty, and a paperback of
“Marvelous deduction, if a little late,” Mycroft sneered.  “She shot Sherlock six months ago.”
Sherlock blinks, thrown by the vehemence in his words.  “I… I’m the same.”
“You’re still mourning Mary,” Sherlock elaborates.  He very nearly chokes on the words:  “I understand.”
“It’s fine,” John says.  “We’re on for tomorrow, right?”
Special thanks to Stellan for Britpicking!
“We’ve got her, John.”  Sherlock was staring intently at the laptop screen, his bent form as taut as a bowstring.  “With this, we can—”
Now, stop whining and get to the toilet before you—”
John raised his head as he hauled himself up another step, meeting Sherlock’s gaze.  Sherlock looked away. He was surprised to feel a twinge of disappointment.
John’s shoulders slump as if a great weight has been lifted from them.  “Oh.”
“That’s John,” said Lestrade.  “He’s usually around.  Come to think of it, where is John?”
“How did you not work that out?” John asks.  “Thought I was being fairly obvious.”
John returns to his room and climbs onto the bed.  It seems an impossible feat, but sleep eventually takes hold of him. The nightmare rises swift and sure, catching him in its claws and dragging him down.
“Scandinavian Valentine’s tradition.”
“Deflecting, John.”
“Because this—this is all going a bit fast.”
Winter lapsed into despondency.  “You don’t seem to hate the guy.”
“Yes.”  Nathan Garrideb nodded gravely.  “Only one of six, but still a treasure on its own.  The Mazarin Chair Collection.”
“Actually, do you know what?” said Sherlock.  “Ignore me.”
“Shit,” he muttered.
What does he have, if not the Work?  Expenses aside, John and Rosie have no reason to stay at Baker Street.  They could just as easily find another home – one without a mad flatmate, one where Rosie might have the mum she so desperately wants.  If (
outside.
Sherlock drew back with an affronted look.  “For a doctor, you can be terribly obtuse.”
Sherlock wants to say,
Shower completed, Sherlock dries his hair and styles his curls to buoyant, shining perfection.  A careful application of concealer covers the lurid bruises from the last two mating debacles.  He dumps his t-shirt on the floor and pulls on his sweatpants, leaving the drawstring loosely-tied so the waistband threatens to slip off his hipbones.  A burgundy dressing gown completes the ensemble. Sherlock sprawls across the sofa with one arm thrown over his head, mimicking the pose of what’s-her-face from Titanic.
They didn’t have to wait long.  Joe arrived minutes later, huffing with exertion from the bike ride.  John strode down the hallway with murder in his eyes; the instant Joe saw him, he took a step back with a sharp, indrawn breath. He lunged for the bike, but stopped when John raised his gun.  “Don’t. I promise I won’t hesitate.”
The first time John hears it, he is so mired in exhaustion he thinks his imagination is playing tricks on him.
“It’s no trouble,” says John.  Only a willfully ignorant man would ignore the true sentiment in those words:
An edge of panic carves through Sherlock’s sullen mood.  “John?”
The words caught in his throat.  A memory came to him, unbidden:  Mary cradling a newborn Rosie to her breast, a dazzling smile glowing through the sweat and exhaustion.  The mother of his child.
My version of fairies comes from Skye Alexander's "Fairies:  The Myths, Legends, & Lore," with a few bits here and there from Holly Black's work.
happy.  I’ve got you.”  His fingers loosen their iron grip and he leans closer, brushes the arch of Sherlock’s cheekbone.  Twines his fingers in Sherlock’s hair.  “For so long, I didn’t think I could have you like this.”
“And I might hurt you.  But John, you and I – we’re our best selves together.  Please.”  Sherlock leaned forward and brushed a kiss, chastely, in his hair.  His voice rumbled in John’s ear.  “I want us to try again.”
“I’m sorry,” he manages.  “I know it’s all wrong, but—”
A scowl masks the hurt on John’s face.  “Sherlock—”
John raises his head and Sherlock’s cock slips out of his mouth with a slick sound. “What is it?”
After, the farmer who owned the land would be fined a punishing sum for his neglect.  He would forever after keep the fence intact, the grass low-cut, the sign freshly-painted.  But that was all
“That case is over, Sherlock.  Has been for nearly a month.  Magnussen is gone, so why—Jesus, Sherlock, could you not?  Not while I’m in front of you!”
He walks as the wind dies down and the snow falls thick and languid from a slate-grey sky.  He walks as it gathers over the bare skeletons of willow trees and the ice-feathered edges of the boating lake.  He walks until his fingers and toes go numb.  A dribble of snot collects on his upper lip; he sniffs, but he can barely feel his face.  Overhead, the sky darkens with gibbous clouds.  More snow on the way.
“Oh, all right,” Mrs. Hudson said.  “Just this once.”
John, anyway?  Had he limped into the street and got himself run down by a car?  Or perhaps Sally Donovan had got to him, scared him off with her ill omens about dead bodies and Sherlock putting them there.  She loved to trot that one out. Or – most likely – he’d run afoul of Mycroft. His brother had a flair for the dramatic that made Sherlock look positively sane by comparison.  If ever there was a time for John’s redcap ancestry to manifest, it would be now. He could fly into a rage and kill Mycroft, ridding Sherlock of an incessant headache.
If he had looked more closely, he might have noticed the sign posted several yards down on the fence.  The paint was faded, the words choked by tendrils of grass:
“They’re charmed,” explained Sherlock.  “No fairy can ensorcell you while you wear this necklace.”
John’s lips twitched, as if he was trying to recapture the smile, but the effort was halfhearted.  “Well.  You might.”
“Mmm, yeah,” says John.  Then, in a tone he might use when discussing the weather, he adds, “I’d like to skip the pretense, if it’s all the same to you, and just take you back to the flat after dinner.  Take my time taking you apart.”
Except it isn’t, not really, because John takes an extra step to the left. Sherlock follows, compelled by years of practicing on his own and the precious handful of nights he spent teaching John to do just this.  John’s hand slips from his to rest behind his shoulder, his other hand moving to the small of his back.  Sherlock falls into a dip, caught by gravity.  Reclaimed by his husband’s arms.
John rolls his eyes.  “I don’t doubt that for a second.  Fine.  Her name is Elise.”
They missed the killer, in the end.  The American in the cab couldn’t have possibly murdered Jennifer Wilson and the others.  Defeated – and
John is undeterred.  “Come on.”  Taking Sherlock’s arm, he leads him across the sitting room, stopping at the threshold of the bedroom.  Sherlock’s heart flutters and he looks to John, who only shakes his head.  “Sorry, love, but no.  Put on something comfortable and meet me out here, yeah?”
“I think it’d be best for you to get some rest,” John says when their teacups sit empty on the table before them.  “I’ll come in to check on you every few hours.  Ask you your name, who the Prime Minister is, et cetera.”
“Here you are, Cathy,” says Mrs. Hudson, handing me a cup of tea.  I sit back and survey the three.  Sherlock takes his seat again, handing John a cup.  John thanks him and takes a sip, sighing as the steam curls around his face.  Mrs. Hudson sits in the armchair adjacent to mine.
thirty minutes, it’s best to be direct.  Yeah?”
“And?”
He lapsed into silence for a moment, and John found his doctor’s compassion rushing to the fore.  “It was a terrible time for both of you.  Neither of you could be expected to cope.”
– grumbles unintelligibly, but doesn’t put up much of a fight.  There is a moment of silence, and then he says, “You’ve something to tell us.”
“Wait,” said Sherlock.  He stood and went to John, pressing the magnifying glass into his inert fingers. “Don’t lose it.”
“Swear to it.”
“That wasn’t on, the way you treated Elise and Catherine.”
“I was hoping you’d come,” said John at length.  Sherlock said nothing and John licked his lips, darted a look around the kitchen.  “Christ.  Bit different than in my day.”
Mycroft raised one hand in farewell as he drifted toward the door.  “Consider it a favor to me.  I have been quite busy attending to the mess you left behind with Moriarty’s organization.”
“Then, one evening when I was getting my things together, he stopped me at the front gate.  Grabbed me.” Her hands uncurl, fingers moving restlessly.  “He was drunk.  Tried to kiss me, started saying filthy things.  Things he wanted to do to me.”
John smiles.  “You’re mostly right.  See, Elise was never actually my girlfriend.”
Before John can reply, Sherlock straightens and rounds on his heel, stalking toward the kitchen.  He rifles through the cupboards, finds a glass and a packet of pills, and returns to the loo with both in hand.  Fills the glass from the tap and hands it to John.
“Yes.”
“Your thoughts.  On dinner.”
The knife moves away.  “Kick it over there.”
John emerged from the doorway and stopped at Mrs. Hudson’s side.  The smile playing about his mouth vanished.  “Oh, for fuck’s sake.”
Sherlock will never tire of calling John his husband.
“Okay?” John murmurs.
“Here we are,” says John an indeterminate amount of time later.  He emerges into the sitting room with a steaming bowl clasped between his palms.  Gingerly, he sits beside Sherlock and nudges the bowl onto his lap.  Sherlock’s hands close mechanically around the ceramic.  His eyes close as warmth seeps into his palms.
“A mad genius.”
The moment the door closed, Sherlock rounded on Mycroft.  “Get out,
Later, ensconced in the solitude of their adjoining hotel rooms – John wasn’t keen on more knowing looks, more insinuating smirks, John was
John paused with his hand cupped on the seat of the sofa, ready to sweep away Harry’s stray crumbs.  “What?”
John throws up his hands, the rotted timbers of his temper collapsing under an avalanche of fury.  “Oh, for fuck’s sake, what do you want?  A bloody medal?  Congratulations, Sherlock, you’ve left us all in the dust again!  Is that what you want to hear?”
“Of the cold?” Sherlock says, looking away from the microscope with a little smile.  “I know you idolize me, John, but even I cannot control the weather.”
Sherlock’s lip curled.  “Too much effort.”
“Yes, she’s a museum curator,” John chuckles.  “Now, leave off.  She’s great and I don’t want you harassing her.”
“Obviously,” Sherlock snapped.  “What do you want?”
“’Cause I don’t have a mum.”
of finality and stands.  Sherlock can see his cock pressing at the zip of his jeans, nudging out the denim.  He licks his lips.
“Mr. Holmes?” a voice called, echoing off of marble floors and soaring archways.  Numbly, Sherlock craned his neck to see to the doorway.  Alexander Grant saw him and began hobbling across the room.
They continue in this vein, adding the token
“Lovely.”  John closes the laptop with a
“’Course.”  Greg nods at Rosie.  “Good night, Rosie.  You were very brave.”
Sherlock side-eyes him judgmentally.  “Very mature, John.”
“I fear you’ll have to wait in the queue,” said Mycroft coolly.  “She threatened Sherlock and murdered Alicia Smallwood.  Suffice to say, I outrank you when it comes to a need for vengeance.”
“I’ve got to take care of my daughter.”  John’s tone brooks no argument.  “Sherlock, too.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The cab bypasses the deserted check-in booth and takes them up to a car park at the foot of the castle.  Sherlock, having called Lestrade and the local police, is not surprised to find a retinue of officers awaiting them.  Anticipation is palpable in their ranks and their eyes are alight with the thrill of a hunt.
“Clearly.”
“Ah.”  John takes the wailing demon, settles her against his shoulder with one hand under her bottom, and begins swaying about like a drunk.  “There we are, love.  Come on. Ooh, hush now.”
Sherlock slips into a doze.  When he wakes, the sun is high in the sky, its glow murky beyond a veil of grey cloud cover.  He gets out of bed and pads into the kitchen.  The plate of eggy bread sits beside his microscope, accompanied by a glass of water and a bottle of syrup.
“Dr. Watson,” he said, and extended his arms to accept Rosie.
Sherlock stares incredulously at him.  “You’re hiding something.”
“Canyouhurryup
Sherlock shifted closer, pressing the warm length of his thigh again John’s.  It was only then that John realized the shaking in his hand had spread through his entire body.  Caught between hate and fear, he thrummed with impotent energy.  His mind seized the point of contact between them and held on, needing an anchor.
“Yep.  Not all of them are currently at work, though; some are off on holiday, others ill, and so forth.”
“I couldn’t see Rosie when I fired the gun.  For that single second, I put my daughter’s life at risk to kill Mary.  I-it’s unforgivable.”  John shook his head.  Shapes and shadows floated through his vision, distorted by the tears.  “And what if I did raise her?  What if I raised her, with, with you, and she grew up knowing me as her father, and then—then she wonders what h-happened to her mum.  I can’t do that, Sherlock.  I can’t look my daughter in the eye and tell her what I did.”  His voice faded to a whisper-rasp as the last of his strength was stripped away.  “I’m not strong enough.”
Sherlock’s musings on John drifted away as he slipped into a different stream of thought.  He was so immersed in the case that he barely noticed the door open, shut. John limped into the sitting room.
Rosie is instantly mollified.  “Can you do Frozen?”
God, he
“Obviously, John.  One cannot wander about naked when a child is present.”
Sparing a final glance up at the windows of 221B, Sherlock opened the cab door and climbed in.
“Right,” he says, voice hoarse.  “Fine.”
Sherlock is taken aback.  “What is it?”
“Oh, my,” Mrs. Hudson said, hand fluttering to her breast.  “I think someone’s just walked on my grave, I’ve just had such a chill…”
John wants so much – god, he wants

know?”
“You now,” Sherlock gasped.
Sherlock swallows past a lump in his throat.  “I can’t fail like that again, John.”
Rosie totters up the stairs behind John, Sullivan and the reindeer bundled under her arm.  Sherlock fiddles with the ties on a trash bag, cinches them tight.  His spine stiffens at the light but steady sound of John’s feet descending the stairs.  Arms slip around his waist, warm and sure; a chest molds against his back; a breath puffs in his ear.
They catch each other’s eyes, grinning like a pair of schoolboys—and then.  And
The ploy worked; the gunshots veered toward him, spattering off the pillar.
John chuckles wearily.  He looks dazed.  “Ask her, not me.”
“I mean it.  You really are.”
Sherlock bit back the words.  If John wanted to cry for all the poor selkie women in the world, that was his business. As long as it didn’t affect the Work, it made no difference.
“I haven’t the faintest—”
“Is that so.”
“God, Sherlock.”
“Now… now, I think your walls are coming down.  You’re letting yourself feel more.”
“Oh my God,” John croaked.  He rubbed his forehead, blinking hard.  “Oh my God.  How could she… I thought… I thought she loved Rosie, or-or came as close as she could to.  Jesus.”
he thinks.
Sherlock lowers his pipette with care – no fume hood to speak of,
“Convenient,” said Sherlock.
He froze, thrilled to the very marrow of his bones.  Cautious optimism buoyed in his chest as his thumbs moved.
Are you free this evening? Thought we could go to Angelo’s or something.  Maybe go to a film after.  Make a night of it.
“I’m looking for something,” said the puppet.  “A lost toy.  You wouldn’t have happened upon it, would you?”
“Hurry, John!” he cries, and continues running.  As he sprints down the row, a chain-link fence comes into view, miniscule for its distance.  The antlike form of Father Christmas clambers toward it, begins climbing.  “No!”
John emerged from the kitchen with a quizzical expression.  “What’s that?”
Sherlock cups his hand around John’s elbow and draws him close.  John goes into his arms smiling, huffing a ragged little breath against his lips.  Then they are kissing, slow and sensual and deep.
John lowered his mobile and glared at the screen.  “Cock,” he muttered, and jabbed the ‘End Call’ button with a vehement forefinger.  Sherlock’s picture – a sneering candid – faded into black.
John looks at him with a mixture of pity and cruel amusement.  “It’s not as if I
Sherlock scoured this very bank not two days ago, and there had been no signet ring.  That evidence had been planted.  McFarlane is being framed.
Silence fell for a few seconds; then, in an entirely different tone, Mary said, “You know, I was thinking we could do something fun.  Exercise some different muscles.”
“Right,” Sherlock says.  He isn’t convinced.
“Anything.  Anything you want.”
John obeys.  The gun rattles at it skitters across the concrete floor.
Donovan nodded warily and skirted past, her eyes lingering on Harry with something between pity and fear.  Once she was out of earshot, Sherlock looked to Harry.  “I was only trying to help.”
“You must protect… my brother.”
Far away.
I'm Zingiberis on Tumblr.
Rosie’s eyes dart from the telly to Sherlock and back, as if making sure the ghost hasn’t escaped from the screen to terrorize her.  “What?”
Tying the knot of his robe, John wanders into the sitting room and stares vacantly at his armchair.  He’s bone-weary, but a part of him balks at the thought of going back upstairs.  If he goes to bed, he will go to sleep.  And if he sleeps, the nightmare will come.
Sherlock continued as if John hadn’t spoken.  “The bullet broke through the window and struck her in the left temple.”  He tapped the side of his head to illustrate.  “She slumped, and I—I didn’t think, so I.  Caught her.”  His eyes flicked to the sheet and back to John.  “I didn’t want her to fall down.”
“She—she made a peach tea for most of her demonstrations,” Andy said.  “At least, she said she did. I never got to drink it.”
“What?”
“I believe I said ‘discreet,’” she said.
“It’s not okay,” he croaked.
Sherlock turns, staring blankly at the television, and thinks,
Sherlock does, and Lestrade rings off without a word.  He must have sensed Sherlock’s waning interest in the case, because NSY cars arrive with lights flashing after what feel like mere minutes, though it could have been longer.  Sherlock is quite drunk, and staring at John’s flexing muscles as he restrains the bartender could, conceivably, make him lose track of time.
Right.  How silly of me.
The mazikeen stormed down the street, rounded a corner, and disappeared.  Sherlock set his violin and bow on the table and slammed the window shut with all the vehemence he could muster.  It wasn’t remotely as satisfying as he had hoped.
Reluctantly, John tugged his finger away from Rosie and pivoted to open his arms to Mary.  She slid into the space with a sigh, pressing her nose against his neck.  John’s arms felt stiff, mechanical.  It was ridiculous – he had held her countless times.  They’d had sex countless times.  They were married.  Married with a baby.
“Lottie,” he breathes.
Sherlock shrugged off his misgivings and focused on the Work.  Through the whirl of clues, the deduction about her pink case slammed into him.  He dashed down the spiral staircase and onto the pavement outside, scanning his surroundings for nearby skips.
“Nope.”  John’s tone was brisk.  “Just skepticism.  I know you’re the British government, but can you actually do that?  Remove someone from the world and act like they never existed?”
As his arms slowly encircled Mary’s waist, John remembered how his life had become livable again – how socializing became tolerable, sex became fun, the very air became breathable.  Mary had given him that.  He owed her.
A smile tugs at John’s lips.  “No.”
“Or,” says Sherlock, “we could skip dinner and go straight to the bedroom.”
John tugged at the shirt, and Sherlock lifted his arms.  With the shirt and dressing gown gone, Sherlock was bare from the waist up.  A puckered line of scar tissue clung from his navel to the base of his sternum like barbed wire.
Mary’s voice plummets into Sherlock’s mind with the freezing jolt of a fallen icicle.
John smiles nervously, rubs the back of his neck.  “I’ll just call Elise.  We had plans for tonight, but honestly, I don’t think I’ll be able to get out of bed once I settle in.”
“I promise,” said Mycroft, “I will protect your daughter at all costs.”
“It’s the truth,” Sherlock said.  “Selkie stories are all the same.  Kidnapping, rape, abuse.  Obviously she got tired of it and killed him.  Tedious.”
John drew his hand back with a wary look, but Mrs. Hudson only took a seat beside the bed, raising her hands with placating innocence.  “Besides, if I’m perfectly honest, dear… you’re getting quite rank.  I’ve a feeling that taking that blanket off would be like… oh, I don’t know.  Unsealing an ancient sarcophagus, I suppose.”
One of the foundations of Sherlock’s life was being shaken, and he had to restore balance.
Sherlock waves the deduction away, frustrated with himself.  He wants to sneer, wants to snarl and disdain.  The last thing he wants is to pity.
said Mary.
The sweep of his hair is mussed; Sherlock’s fingers itch to tidy it, but he doesn’t dare.
“Oh.”  John isn’t sure how to feel.  “He did?”
, surely.
A pause.  Sherlock’s eyes are adjusting to the dark: he sees John blink, lick his lips.  Sigh.
Sherlock frowns and reaches for the sliced loaf of challah bread on the counter. He dunks the bread into the milk and egg mixture and slaps it onto the frying pan.  As grease and egg yolk pop and spit, a cinnamon scent wafts into the air. “Neat?  Pristine?”
“Mary,” Sherlock said, with all the sobriety he could muster, “is to be left out of this.  You can’t lock her up because you don’t like her, Mycroft.  She’s John’s wife, and the mother of his child.”  The words were thorns in his mouth, but they were the truth.  “What she’s done—the past is behind her.  Leave it be.”
“Yes, it is,” Sherlock answers, raising his voice over Ms. Carvel’s grumbling.
Sherlock tries to affect a wry tone.  “Bit of a predicament.  I quite like my parts the way they are.”
Distantly, he heard the front door swing open and shut.  “Wow, it’s quiet for once.  Hope I’m not interrupting an unscheduled nap.  John?”
“It’s the smell,” John says, desperate to make Sherlock understand. “The smell at the pool.  Can’t get it out of my head.”
”  Mary had been friendly, charming in her certainty that John wouldn’t turn her down.  With more disbelief than reluctance, he continued.  “We married in May last year.”
Sherlock pushes the tell-tale Merinos aside and a scarlet, scalloped trim of lace peeks through the gap.  He can see from a glance that it has been moved and carefully – but not perfectly – tucked back into place.  Deductions flick through his mind like cards in a shuffling deck:
and searing curse of his landing are muffled by a thick cushion of polyester.  Sherlock scrambles into a seating position, drags a stray pillow over his lap, and combs his fingers through his wayward curls.
Sherlock’s hands are starting to shake.  He presses a thumb to the arch of John’s foot, kneading, soothing.  (Himself or John, he cannot say.) “Children.”  The word sticks in his throat.  “Do you… want them?”
The door opens and John steps across the threshold.  As his eyes alight on Sherlock, the bemused smile playing about his lips falls as though cut off.  Worry shadows his face.  He crosses the room and lays a hand on the bedclothes, fingers barely brushing Sherlock’s.
Sherlock’s fingers are swift on the mousepad, selecting another video from the playlist.  He has research to do.
They needn’t have bothered.  After over an hour of suffering public transport to Bray – John having refused to take a cab – Sherlock took one step into the quaint brick home, stared for less than a second, then whirled around and stalked back out.  He narrowly avoided colliding with John, who managed to exchange just enough pleasantries and spin the right excuses to avoid having tea with a pair of scandalous seniors.
At the clinic a few days later, between wrapping up with his last patient and getting started on the weekly mountain of paperwork, John’s phone buzzed.  Nudging sheets aside, he retrieved the mobile phone and tapped the screen.  His left hand tracked a messy scrawl as his right pressed the phone to his ear.
him—well.  Sherlock’s usually vast foresight shrinks to a pinprick, and so he is caught by surprise when it happens.
“Hmm, yeah.  Nice.”
“Don’t be ridiculous.”
“Didn’t he have a bruise, last we saw him?” Donovan murmured.  “Big, ugly thing.”
Sherlock’s mobile chimes, snapping him out of his reverie.  Rolling a crick out of his neck, he plucks his mobile off the tabletop and glances at the screen.  Lestrade.
John stares at him steadily and the prickle sharpens into a jab.  Sherlock knows the proper response to give, but he doesn’t know if he can give it with sincerity.  He tries anyway.  “I—I got carried away.  Apologies.”
now?”
“Yes.”
Tooth-rotting fluff ahead!
Mycroft’s smile drooped into a frown of deep annoyance and he rolled his eyes.  The moment he was not watching her, Mrs. Hudson winked at Sherlock.
“Watson?” he mumbles.
Smiling sweetly, Mrs. Hudson held open the door for him.  “Goodnight, John.”
“Where is the memory stick?” asked Sherlock.
He shoots Sherlock a poisonous look as he and the redhead turn to leave. Half-way across the room, the redhead shrugs off Seb’s hand.  Her manicured fingers move to her clutch, fiddling with the clip.  She’s going to call a friend, a cab.  Seb will be going home alone tonight.
“But what?” Sherlock says, rounding on him.  “But you forgot?  Forgot to mention the small matter of cutting out the
“Oh, my!” Ms. Stock said, giggling in a manner entirely unsuitable for an eighty-year-old.  “Why on earth are you asking after my legs!  Cheeky little boy!”
“I wouldn’t pick Bray,” he muttered.
“And?”  John’s eyes gleam.
“My people will be here in minutes to collect your daughter and Mrs. Hudson,” said Mycroft, glancing at Rosie as if worried John would expect him to hold her.  “They will be taken to my home, where they will wait until they can be transported to separate safe houses.  Once the issue with Mrs. Watson is resolved, both will be returned to London.”
“I failed,” Sherlock says, “but I shouldn’t have taken that out on you.  It’s unacceptable.”
– was a mistake.  John is going to be kind but firm.
“What kind?”
Sherlock doesn’t hate children, actually.  He finds their perceptiveness and candor refreshing in the face of adults’ tendencies to lie, to omit, to smooth over anything that might be considered
“Let’s go, then.”  John pauses, regards Sherlock dubiously.  “Think you can manage it?  You seem a bit…”
“Have you got anything?” Lestrade asks, striding over to Sherlock’s side.
“That I did,” said John.  “Excellent deduction.”
“What… what’s all this?”
“You were right,” he says.
John pulls him to his feet.  His hands move to Sherlock’s chest, fingers splayed over his thundering heart. “Sherlock.”
John stared at the object in his hands, mouth opening and closing.  He cleared his throat, blinked.  “Um.  Thank you.”
Sherlock tries to shove Oldacre off, but the man must know he has no chance of escape.  Though well into his sixties, he fights with the ferocity of a cornered bear, desperate to drag someone down with him. He shoves Sherlock’s hand aside and levels a punch at his face.  Pain erupts as the back of Sherlock’s head cracks against the floorboards.  Blood fountains from his nose and his vision goes white.
Sherlock cleared his throat.  In a low voice, he said, “You’ll get bored quickly.  This isn’t a gunfight.”
“I’m really feeling much better,” Harry had said, scarfing down her third biscuit to punctuate the statement.  “Got the last of it out.”
– and then a short figure disengages from the crowd, lurching over tripping feet.  John stumbles toward Sherlock, face flushed from dancing and drinking.
John pulls back for an instant; before Sherlock can protest, he says, “Fuck my mouth.”
“Sh-she… she shot you—”
They chase him for a few blocks before John, who has been steadily gaining the entire time, launches himself at the bigger man with all the vicious power of a former rugby player.  The bartender topples onto the pavement, but his struggle is short-lived.  John wrenches one meaty arm behind the man’s back, twisting the wrist until he blubbers for mercy.  In John's other hand, the Sig gleams in the moonlight.
And stares in utter disbelief as the drunk ducks out of the way.  His fist flies over the drunk’s head, an inescapable trajectory, and cracks into the only other person in his path.  Which happens to be Molly Hooper.
Touched as he is, Sherlock cannot contain his misgivings.  “But…”
Sherlock shook his head, but before he could utter the words
Gingerly, John stands, mattress creaking as his weight leaves.  It’s an old bed – over a decade, at least.  Sherlock knows, from a handful of ill-advised nights after John was married and moved out, that the mattress is lumpy and stiff.
Sherlock bared his teeth, half-way between a snarl and a grin.  “Did you visit simply to nag me about my personal life or did you have something meaningful to say?”
“Don’t cry,” Sherlock murmurs.  “Please.”
Sherlock sends the text, deliberates, and writes a second.
,” said John, “like you could use a new shirt.  That one’s destined for the bin, I’m afraid.”
In that moment, every sound in the wood – every ticking, whirring insect, every calling bird – fell silent.
Sherlock and John freeze.  Stiffly, Sherlock turns his head, stares up to the landing.  The door to 221B is ajar, the room beyond unlit.  Rosie is a small shadow peering out through the bar of open door.  Sherlock feels John move away from him, shifting furtively to conceal his state.
“You are,” John says, biting his lip.  “You were.”
Sherlock shrugged.  “I wouldn’t leave it
Sherlock stood and peeled off his gloves.  Tossing them on the table, he turned and hobbled to the kitchen sink.  He balanced with one hand propped against the counter, using the other hand to reach for one of the green tiles in the recess.  The tile held for a moment, then came cleanly away in Sherlock’s hand, revealing a hole hewn into the wall.  There was a clink of ceramic as Sherlock set the tile down and reached into the hole.  A clear bag dangled between his fingers, its white contents sifting from side to side.
” Sherlock snaps.  “Leave it.”
John froze for an instant, then creaked into motion like the proverbial mountain coming to Muhammed.  He lifted Rosie, kissed her forehead, and murmured something Sherlock could not hear.  Then he handed her over with infinite care.  Her cries of alarm faded as the agent hurried toward the car – then the door closed, silencing her.  John stared at the BMW with unblinking focus.
(See the end of the chapter for
The shaking was the least of Sherlock’s recent onslaught of annoyances.  A headache pounded behind his temples like ice picks being driven through his ears.  A clammy sheen of sweat clung to his skin and chilled him to the bone.  Pain smoldered through his muscles and reduced every movement to shaky jerks.
It’s an empty threat, and the worry clouding John’s face dissipates.  He says only, “Hurry.”
“Better?” John mumbled, climbing in and settling himself at Sherlock’s side.
John cleared his throat.  “I found an oak.  It had a low, thick branch, and I threw the rope over.  Then…”  The hopelessness in his eyes vanished, subsumed by a spark of something bright and lovely.  Something like
Sorry for the delay.  Hopefully I can do chapter 8 tonight.
John barks out a laugh, but it’s all wrong, edged with self-deprecation.  “Honestly?  I’m pushing fifty, Sherlock.”
The mattress shifts as Sherlock moves.  A kiss over each closed eye, lingering at last on his lips.  “I know.  Sleep, now.”
John averted his gaze in shame.  He noticed another man hovering on the periphery of the crowd, looking strangely at-ease.  Tall, broad, and black, his air of quiet competence cut a striking figure amidst the madness.  He reminded John of the tigers in documentaries – utterly still and silent, coiled to spring.
“Against me, of course,” Mycroft said, rolling his eyes.  “
“Wasn’t doin’ nothing!” Wiggins whimpered.  “Just—just checking on a client!”
Chuckling, the two lapse into a companionable silence.  Darkness settles swiftly, cloaking the streets in shadows cast by the glow of streetlamps.  Even as night falls over London, the lifeblood of the city pulses on, drumming a rhythm of clattering car wheels and footfalls on pavement.  When they reach the flat, John opens the door and ushers Sherlock inside.
Had he?
In Bart’s cafeteria, Sherlock made an appeal to Molly to see Van Coon and Lukis’ bodies.  He complimented her hair. Something nonsensical about the way she’d parted it.
“Yes.”  John’s voice is firm, but his eyes are soft.  “It wasn’t difficult.  I’ve been sure about this for a long time.”
John’s amazement as they stood on the banks of the Thames with Lestrade, Alex Woodbridge’s corpse lying at their feet.  John’s wondering grin, the kind that lit him from within, piling wrinkles at the sides of his mouth and under his
“No,” John spat, “though it’s not really any of your business, is it?”
“Not all the tenants of these locations are available for immediate delivery,” said Mr. Garrideb with a shrug.  “Some are up-and-coming collectors, you see, trying to establish a new gallery.  I agree to hold the pieces until the locations are suitable for them.  These antiques need to be kept in controlled environments.”
“Dr. Watson.”  Mycroft’s voice is cool and crisp.  “I’ll keep this brief.  Mary Watson’s baby is stable and currently in the NICU of St. Pancras hospital.”
Panting, Sherlock winds his arms around John, fingers digging into the muscles of his back.  The warmth sparks through his nerves and simmers in his blood, curling low in his pelvis like licks of flame.  He’s tipping over the edge, he realizes with a gut-punch of dismay – and he’s clamping his teeth around a shout as he comes and comes, spurting between them.  John utters a soft oath.  Shadows and silver-blue light conspire to make his eyes as blue as a summer sky, and they watch Sherlock, unblinking and keen.
“Had to check on Rosie,” he mumbled.  “Go back to sleep.”
John rested his head atop Sherlock’s, feeling the dark curls tickle his cheek.  “I’m sorry.”
Sherlock grasped at the word
“Stop, stop,” John pleads.
“Oh, Christ, Sherlock…”
Marriage, as it happens, is hard work.
“No,” said Moriarty, eyeing the coat.  “I really don’t.  I once took a selkie’s coat.  Long time ago.  I tore it into shreds in front of her, just to see what would happen.  D’you know what she did?”
The drunk blinks, befuddled, as Lestrade ushers him away from their table.  Molly glares at the drunk's retreating form.  “What a twat.”
And, perhaps because she’s inherited her father’s penchant for romanticism, Rosie pays very close attention to the finale as the credits roll.  Her nose scrunches.  “What does that mean?”
The door to the flat swung open and Mrs. Hudson emerged, expression wary.  She bore a plate laden with profiteroles, chocolate drizzled down the sides and dollops of cream bulging out of the centers.  Her eyes widened with affront.  “So.  You’ve finally decided to be a responsible adult and make your own tea, is that it?”
Sherlock is paralyzed.  Powerless to tear his gaze away, he watches as John draws near, determination written into every line of his form.  A distant part of Sherlock’s mind is relieved he put down the violin.  His entire body is trembling.
He covers John’s hand with his own.  “What are you afraid of?”
Sherlock is jolted back to his senses, crying “Don’t!” just as the door creaks open.  It halts mid-swing, John’s fingers tight on the knob.  Worry is written into every line of the bones in his hand and wrist.
John pulls back and shimmies across the bed until he is seated between Sherlock’s legs, arms bracketing his waist.  “I’d like to do it like this,” he says.  “I want to see you.  Watch your face when I’m inside you, see your expression when you come.”  His voice tapers into a kiss, daubed on the column of Sherlock’s throat.  Sherlock shivers and John draws back, breathing the words, “This mole, right here?  Drives me mad.  I can’t tell you how many times I’ve wanted to bite it.  Bit of a fixation, really.”
Winter’s text contained only three words:
“Hello.”
The conclusion jams in Sherlock’s mind like a grain of sand in the gears of an intricate clock.
He looks up, realizing, with the action, that he had braced his elbows on the table and rested his face in his hands.  John stands beside him.  “You okay?”
Sherlock shook his head.  “Mary is keen to get her hands on this.  She kidnapped Mr. Garrideb for it, thinking he knew where it was hidden.  But he hasn’t got a clue.  He’s been sitting on a bomb for years without knowing it.”
Sherlock snatches Woodley’s wrist and snaps it back, clearing the knife before they crash together.  They fall to the ground, the world spinning in a chaotic cartwheel of blue sky and tawny leaves.
“I want you to fuck me,” Sherlock says, startling himself with the sincerity and obscenity of it.  John’s eyes fly wide open and his hips stutter; encouraged, Sherlock lowers his voice to a rumble.  “Fuck me, John.”
Sherlock sees it near the end of the evening, when John is coaxing Sophie to sleep.  They are on the sofa in the sitting room, lights dimmed.  Sherlock watches as John rocks the snuffling babe in his arms, lulling her with the motion of a ship at sea.  Sophie’s eyes are on John; she is utterly transfixed, and for once, Sherlock can agree with her.  Steeped in shadows, his voice low and rasping, John exudes an aura of competent calm. Safety.
Smiling, John turns back to his task, whisking eggs with a nimble turn of the wrist.  Sherlock searches for hints of guilt, shame, discomfort – the footprint at the crime scene.  There is nothing of the kind.
John crossed the room and sat in his armchair with a heavy
Perhaps – and this thought made Sherlock’s throat clot – John knew of how such charms were made.  How silly notions like
Rosie’s eyes widen and she spears the tomato on her fork for a hasty bite.  She swallows and glances at Sherlock.  A question flits into her eyes, driving away the portents of another tantrum.  “Sherlock?”
“But—”
The pencil falters in Sherlock’s hand.  Guilt, slick and oily, begins churning in the pit of his gut.  Flicking his eyes warily at Rosie, he sees that she hasn’t noticed his lapse; her hands are folded on the table, her expression distant.  She chews absentmindedly on her lower lip.
A flush has risen to Sherlock’s face when they part.  His eyes are glassy, the irises slivered thin by dilated pupils.  “John.”
“Stop shouting,” Sherlock moans.  “For God’s sake, John…”
Sherlock and Catherine turn around and walk back toward the entrance to the Inner Circle.  The path is completely deserted, the few brave Londoners having retired to their warm homes.  If there is anyone else present, Sherlock can’t see them; the snow is so thick, he can scarcely see ten feet in front of him.
“M’fine,” Sherlock mumbles.  His stomach churns in defiance and he winces, feeling his gorge rise.
Eyes wide, Rosie takes the box with exaggerated care.  She sits, box on her knees, and opens it with utter reverence.  She startles.  Looks up at Sherlock.  “Is it okay?”
Today, it is takeaway placed on the table beneath the cow skull.  John presses a kiss to Sherlock’s temple, the soft, barely-there pressure drawing him back to shore.  Sherlock blinks.  “John.”
“John.”  A rasp, a rumble –
I expect it will have to.  –SH
“Good morning, love,” he says.
“Dull,” proclaimed Sherlock, rolling his eyes.  Affection bloomed in John’s breast.  There had been times when he’d wanted to kiss away Sherlock’s sarcasm and disdain, but he couldn’t recall wanting to kiss Sherlock
John turns back to the mirror, eyes roving over his reflection.  “Nothing.”
Fear surged, sending John’s heart racing.  Sheer willpower compelled him to nod, offer a brittle smile, and walk out of the room.
He left the sentiment unfinished and turned to follow Lucy into the sitting room.  Sherlock remained in the kitchen, vibrating with a noxious, twisting energy.  He crept to the doorway and stood by the wall, out of sight but not out of earshot.
“I can look after her,” Alexander offered.  Sherlock and John whirled around to face him; Rosie squalled at the sudden movement.  Alexander smiled in his easy way.  “I want to help, but with this leg…”
bedroom.  “I’m going to bed.  You can join me when you’ve regained your senses.”
The weight of the Sig in John’s blood-caked hands.  He raised the gun, vision tunneling as he took aim.  The kick of recoil.  The detonation of the shot.
“John.”  Lestrade’s voice was tight with ill-restrained fury.  “John, you need to get down here and handle him.  He’s out of control.”
John wraps his hand around Sherlock’s thigh and thrusts urgently.  He’s too eager to bother with finesse and his prick presses between Sherlock’s cheeks,
He climbs the stairs to 221B behind Sherlock, mindful of every step.  Even months after Mary shot him, John still fears a misplaced step will shatter Sherlock like brittle glass.
“I wasn’t disgusted,” Sherlock burst out.  “
Sherlock feels his legs turn to jelly, as if the confirmation of his sorry state has robbed him of his remaining strength.  Paramedics guide him to a stretcher.  The sky above spins, starlight streaming together as a mask is fitted onto his face.
“You don’t know.”
“Smart boy,” said Mary.  “See you soon.”
He frowned, cocked his head.  Slowly, he typed out a response.
John cranes his neck to give the man a puzzled look.  His faculties muddled by drink, he defaults to polite incredulity when Sherlock thinks a punch in the mouth would do quite nicely. “Do I know you?”
“Rosie?  Do you have anything you’d like to say?” asks John.
“Don’t worry,” says John.  Sherlock notes that the Sig has been stashed back in its hiding place.  John pushes Cotton Bud toward Bradstreet; the thug goes with the air of a man saved from the noose.  “Like lambs, they are.  Right?”
Sherlock lets the minutes stretch.
“Watson wants a
her from existence.”
“Yes, of course,” said Harry.
“Let’s get you to bed,” John says.
“Well?” he asked, meaningfully.
“Yoo-hoo!” Mrs. Hudson calls. “Boys, you’ve got a client.”
Sherlock can hardly
Releasing her injured arm, Rosie wipes her nose with the back of her hand and swallows back tears.  Voice thick, she mumbles, “Hurts.”
“Ye-es,” Sherlock drawls, and oh, there’s the malice he was missing earlier:  scantily-clad in sarcasm.  “It would be ridiculous to make her leave Baker Street just because you’re gone.  She
He smiled, encouraging a joke, but John felt the little humor he had evaporate.  The weight of shared knowledge settled upon the three, stifling and immense.  They all knew why Sherlock hadn’t been to Rosie’s birth or christening.
“All right?” Alexander asked.
“It’s Saturday after Christmas, Sherlock.”
“I’m fine,” he manages, voice a trifle higher than usual.  “I—must have dozed off.  No need to worry.”
John bites his lip, eyes crinkling at the corners with suppressed mirth.  “Come on.”  Crouching, he hooks his hands beneath Sherlock’s arms.  “Up you go.”
The scrape of a key in the lock made Sherlock take a few paces back, every nerve on alert.  The lock turned sideways as the bolt slid out of place.  The knob turned, infinitesimally slow.  The door opened a crack – and stopped.
enticing.
Back then, there weren’t many Fair Folk living among the humans.  The ones who preferred human company were considered rather queer by both humans and Fae, and they were immediately recognizable due to the Glamor Laws.  The only concealments fairies were allowed were long hair to cover their pointed ears, contact lenses to conceal eldritch irises, hats to hide horns.  Physical attributes, something that could be removed.  No magic.
“The killer had considerable strength,” he mutters to himself.  “Lifting a fully-grown man off the ground with a pulley…”
John doesn’t expect anything to change when he lies down for his first night at 221B Baker Street.  He has a belly full of beef lo mein and egg rolls and the fingers of his right hand are still tense from pulling the trigger.  He killed a serial killer not three hours ago and his flatmate is definitely a bit of a madman.  He doesn’t expect to get any more or any less sleep than usual tonight.
Catherine chuckles, readjusts her hold.  Something metallic glints in her hand, perilously close to Rosie’s throat.  “It was all for you, Sherlock.  All of it.”
”  Anderson’s voice was verging on shrill.
John abandoned caution and grabbed Sherlock’s shoulders, shaking them roughly.  “Sherlock!  Sherlock, wake up!”
“That isn’t love, Mr. Carruthers,” says John, fury tense in the line of his jaw. The blood smeared across his temple makes him look fierce and vengeful, a war god come to strike down the unworthy. “It’s selfishness.”
“You were born after he broke with the cult,” noted Sherlock.
John shrugs, halfheartedly accepting the offering of comfort.  “I suppose part of it is, um… the shirt?  How does it…?”
“Sure.”  John didn’t look convinced.  “Go on, then.”
Joe stiffened.  “What’re you implying?”
I'm Ziniberis on Tumblr.
“Ugh,” Sherlock grimaced.  “Disgusting.  I’ve changed my mind – don’t touch the sweets.  You’re saccharine enough as it is.”
As always, if you find any mistakes, please let me know and I can correct them.  :)
Heed the rating change, lovelies.
, Sherlock thought.
The words are delivered with ease – almost levity – but each one seems to strike Seb like a pellet of buckshot.  He steps back, lips twisting, all pretense at civility gone.
and stop letting all the murderous ones find me.”
At any other time, the glittering opulence of Morcar Museum would have been a marvel to behold.  With sweeping archways, jutting spires, and bulky stone pillars, the building defied the trappings of modernity in favor of the Victorian flair that had distinguished London in centuries past.
Sherlock could no more ignore that look than he could stall his beating heart.  His hand rose to dwarf John’s, fingers cradling his.
of it in a particular place.  Sherlock pushes his hips back, investigating.  He is rewarded by a sharp gasp from John as his arse meets the rigid line of John’s cock.
Sherlock was shocked by John’s presence at the antiques shop, but he concealed it, willing his pulse to slow and  slipping into a smug grin like he would any other disguise.
“So,” said Lestrade, “we’ve identified the victim as Mr. Nicholas Clarke. Thirty-five years old.  Worked as a barrister, had a wife and three-year-old son.”
Sherlock twines his arm around John’s waist, anchoring himself as he digs his heels into the mattress and arches
” and Alexander went still.  The color drained from his face and his jaw clenched, as if holding back a scream.  Steeling himself, John watched as Alexander fell apart in a way he knew all-too well.  Alexander was watching his dead love come back to life.
By way of response, Catherine cinches her arm tightly around Rosie’s throat, choking off the girl’s cry.  John winces, the fingers of his free hand flexing at his side.  In his other hand, the Sig is held in a white-knuckled grip.

His musings were interrupted by Lestrade, come to announce the fourth suicide.  Sherlock waltzed out of the flat and into the stairwell, jubilant. Four suicides and a note!
creatures.  You can only pity someone for so long before you start to despise them.”
“Get out of here, please
Sherlock leaned back against the sofa cushions.  “Prominent factor of Chinese mythology. Fruits – sometimes gems – that grant immortality.  Su Lin stole them hundreds of years ago, and the Tong have been searching for her ever since.”
“Don’t bother, I know.”  John blinks and widens his eyes in a bid to stay alert.  “Lestrade phoned an hour ago.”
“Yes.”  Mycroft nodded.  “Modified for your special use and a hundred times more valuable than the standard, but, ultimately, yes.”
Sherlock swallows back the immediate, desperate reply that rises to his lips:
“No, you just carry bloody harpoons on the Tube and fire guns in the middle of Belgravia!  Of course, how silly of me!  That’s nowhere near as inappropriate as shouting!” John shouts.

Heads up, this chapter is probably the trope-iest one so far.
Many selkies – Lucy among them, evidently – were rendered mute by the loss of their coat.  As if their voice had been ripped away with their freedom.
His gaze meets mine, holds, and darts up and down my person.  There’s a sort of mechanical fixedness to it, as if he’s gathering bits of data and feeding them into a computer, generating a stream of results.  “You resemble your mother strongly, but you aren’t like her at all.  Not really.  You prefer dogs – large breed back home, I’m guessing a German shepherd – and you aren’t in a healthcare-related field, no.  Publishing.  Fresh out of uni, but clever enough and connected enough to have a good entry-level position lined up when you return.  Have I got it right so far?”
“I know this time it was harmless,” he said, pointing out the bus window.  The village of Bray swept past, idyllic and oblivious.  “But the other two times, we had Sylvius and Sala to deal with.  Odds are that there’s more danger waiting.”
He stands, fingers still interlocked with John’s.  “I’ll change.”
He also knows the ability of the iris to open or close, controlling the size of the pupil.  And he’s certain his pupils are huge now, ink-dark, drinking in every particle of light reflecting off of John Watson.
“I beg your pardon?” asked Sherlock.  “Are you staging an invasion?”
“Ridiculous,” John said, chuckling.
Guilt prickles in the pit of Sherlock’s belly.  “I didn’t want to lose them.”
They manage to arrive at the flat without scandalizing anyone, though Sherlock suspects not much would scandalize a seasoned London cab driver.  He doesn’t care; he drags John through the front door, up the seventeen stairs to 221B, and into the bedroom.
“I’ve done nothing but hurt you in return.  You don’t deserve that.  You deserve…”  Emotion clotted in John’s throat.  His eyes pricked.  “You deserve so much more than that.  Someone who, who would never dream of hurting you.  Who would only want
“Of course.”  John emerged from the kitchen and crossed to the front door.  Opening it, he called down the stairs, “Mrs. Hudson?”
And freezes.  A clatter:  John has dropped his fork, and the ring of metal on ceramic is jarring in the still air of the kitchen.  He retrieves the cutlery with a shaking hand.  His eyes are wide.
Mr. Garrideb gestured to a flat, pale stone nestled in the chair back.  The splat was a framework of mahogany-rendered vines, curving and looping in graceful symmetry.  Cradled in the vines’ embrace, the Mazarin stone resembled a shining egg.
“You are,” John agrees.  Sherlock scrapes his teeth against the reddened skin and John shudders.  “Y-you really are.
I’ll pick up some takeaway after, shall I?  From the Korean barbeque. –SH
Mrs. Hudson narrows her eyes but doesn’t object.  “Asleep.  It is half-five.  In the
“Really,” said Mycroft.  He interlaced his gloved fingers in his lap and leaned back.  “At the rate you’re going, I daresay you won’t have either of those for long.”
“Why coconut lentil curry?”
“Something is wrong,” says John.
“Well, yes,” says Mrs. Hudson.  “Or rather, I have a guest with something to tell you.”  Her voice rises.  “Cathy?  Cathy, these are my boys – Sherlock Holmes and John Watson.”
city, yes.  The perfect cesspit of criminality and vice.”
“John,” Sherlock says.  Possibly shouts.  Definitely shouts.  “John, John,
Sherlock recalls.
Greg nearly chokes on his pen.
“DI Dimmock.”  Sherlock offers a hand to shake, which Dimmock clasps with decidedly more fervor than Lestrade’s.
“No,” said Sherlock.  He clenched his teeth, staunching a flow of declarations he knew he would regret:
“That’s what Jim Moriarty said, right before I jumped,” said Sherlock.  John felt the air calcify in his lungs, making each breath a splinter.  “Remember all those assassins, John?  The ones suddenly so keen on saving my life?  Moriarty convinced them he had given me a code without my knowing it.  But in the end, the code was meaningless.  There was no key...”  He trailed off, gaze swerving from side to side, as though corralling the facts in his mind.  Then it snagged, stopped.  The light of realization dawned over his features.  “Mary’s done the same thing now.”
Sherlock tightens his grip on his glass, stung.  He is no stranger to vicious remarks, but his defenses have been crumbling over the past few hours, weakened by a Guinness and two ciders. After the disastrous bath incident, his nose bloomed into a lurid riot of bruises and have since wilted into sour yellow and acid green.  The swelling has mostly gone down, but Sherlock still gets double-takes from strangers.
“Christ, but I’m sure you will.”  Drawing back, John shakes his head.  “Right.  I’ve—I’ve got to go check on Rosie.”

An incoherent shout joins the fray and a small figure darts through Sherlock’s peripheral vision:  John. With a perfectly-aimed blow, he knocks Oldacre off Sherlock, keeping a grip on the old man’s shirt collar to hammer a punch into his teeth.  Oldacre staggers back, blood dripping down his chin.
John winds an arm around Sherlock’s shoulders and pulls him closer.  Sherlock sighs as the last of the January chill evaporates from his bones and warmth bleeds between their bodies.  Closing his eyes, he listens to the soothing drum of John’s heartbeat, the patter of sleet on the car roof.

“I… I was told t-to transcribe them,” said Joe.
He chuckles when they part.  “Well. I thought as much.”
“You’re certain?” Lestrade pressed.
“Oh, look!  The sweetling is awake.”
searing Sherlock’s eardrum as he is made to stand on one end of the room while Rosie, standing on the other end, howls into the receiver.
Sherlock recoils from the thought, but the conclusion is cold crystal, searing past his numbed senses.
“Hmm?”
They left Mycroft to stew in his own thwarted smugness and strode companionably down the street, seeking dim sum and fortune cookies.  As they went, chatting about war wounds and lucky guesses and the enigma of Moriarty, Sherlock stole glances at John from the corner of his eye.  Something about him seemed… lighter. Less burdened, less beaten down. It was as if the life burning in his eyes had scorched a path through his entire body, suffusing him with palpable energy.  He seemed more alive and real than the man who had limped into Bart’s Hospital only days ago.
“Maybe.”
She is a conductor of light in her own right.
Elise looks a little put out.  “Your sister couldn’t make it?”
“Want you,” Sherlock says.  His voice is soft, but before it, John’s misgivings scatter like chaff in a gale.  “I want you inside me, John.”
