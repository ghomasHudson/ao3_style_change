Steve was yelling at Red Skull. Steve didn’t know.
“You mean Tiberius?” Bruce asked. An involuntary shudder ran down Steve’s spine and he clenched his jaw, trying to drag his focus back to the meaningless words on his screen.
Uh... Right. Alien atmosphere. Good idea. Tony rewarded Steve with a proud smile. “Well, pour one out for the teacher’s pet.”
“Okay,” Steve said.
Tony surged towards him, kissing him hard and desperate. “Upstairs,” he breathed against Steve’s mouth.
Scrambling. Red planet, red suit. And Tony, sweat-drenched and bleeding amid the rocks. A tall man leans over him, a wide-eyed kid at his side, others gathered, others following. He hears Vision give another message, another portal, others leaving. Steve doesn’t care. Tony. Alive, warm, his.
They both looked at Steve expectantly, as if waiting for his opinion. He wished people would stop doing that for areas outside his expertise. Magic wasn’t punching. Yet the books he’d read on leadership said that most people just wanted support to validate their own choices, so he tried to look calm and certain. “Yeah, sounds good,” he said, and nodded to the cauldron. “What’s this for?” he asked.
“I know,” Tony whispered. Sorry, he was forever sorry. “But they’re gonna need you when this is over.”
Steve was dying.
Huddled against the wall, Ty moaned softly. When Tony glanced over, the man was holding his arm at an odd angle; he must have injured himself in his earlier scramble to escape.
The coiling irritation in his belly curled tighter with every passing minute. Steve tried to focus on the day’s necessities, but he could hear the early morning chatter of the team slide slowly into discontent.
That much was unsurprising. “Eh, comes with the job,” he said breezily.
“You’re five hours late, Stark,” he snarled. “Five. Hours. Do you not understand how that throws off the schedules of everyone else on your team?”
. Moving in slow, wretched pulses, Steve worked Tony’s cock with his mouth, his ass with his fingers, advancing then retreating, one then the other, the steady momentum pushing and pulling Tony someplace beyond thought, beyond words; at last, Steve swallowed him full, slipped two spit-slicked fingers deep, and commanded Tony’s soul to explode from his body.
“Hours,” Helen said with all the harsh kindness of her profession, leaving no room for false hope. “With aggressive treatment, maybe a day.”
Broadcasting uncensored alien contact, on the other hand, had to be a step too far.
This was-
“Thanks, man,” he heard in his ear-piece, but Tony didn’t reply.
Tony nodded. “When I woke up, I thought…. I thought she deserved my anger. Some kind of justice.” He glanced up at Steve. “But then you looked at me like…” He shook his head, lost for words. “When I saw how much I’d hurt you, I thought… this isn’t justice. This is evil. Something I could never take back.”
“Are you Gamora?” Tony asked, sounding startled. The girl nodded, wide eyed, as Steve prepared for the inevitable fight - no weapons, the Captain noted - but as Tony began to activate the suit, the nanobots crawled over their joined hands to cover Steve too, which would be something, the Captain agreed. Yet as Thanos strode towards them, a flare of white light dazzled them all, then faded.
Back then.
“Can I join you?” he asked eventually.
actually sing, you know,” he grumbled, pulling his own jacket on against the descending evening chill.
know, Tony,” Steve snarled right back, hurling the words across the distance between them, “because I know
“Tony? Jeez, hi, is that really you? Yeah, sorry, we just got here, apparently we tripped an alarm or something, was that one of yours?”
02:14, Mon 2nd July 2018
god. Was this religion?
.” Tony knew it was small as gestures went, almost insignificant, but walking away, he felt exhilarated. Plus, he caught Steve trying to hide a proud smile, so clearly they were destined to be petty bastards together. “All yours, Cap,” he said with an answering grin.
“Damn right,” he heard Tony agree.
At the unexpected sound of the glass door sliding open, Steve’s eyes flew open, the surrounding machines betraying his shock. A painfully young man approached his bed and blinked down at him through a plastic face visor, a cheerful smile pinned across his face.
Steve groans softly, earning a rich chuckle from Tony. “Yellow symbolizes friendship and affection. Green stands for perpetual renewal, blue is something extraordinary or mysterious, uh, lavender represents new or unspoken feelings. And the big white ones…”
“Happy anniversary,
“Enough, Steve,” the other man said, his voice almost gentle. “You get that we’re done here, right?” He was looking towards the exit. “You go your way, and I’ll go mine.”
“Excellent, you’re all here,” the tall man said. He had the haughty air of a bored substitute teacher, a well-shaped goatee, and Tony had absolutely no idea who he was. Judging from the fearsome array of weapons that had appeared, neither had anybody else. Tony glanced down at his bare palms, only then realizing he could have summoned the armor.
Tony had cried then, but Steve had held him together, easy. After so many weeks spent up close, the man was beginning to make more sense to Steve. He understood now that Tony’s worst battles were always against himself, his most vicious wounds self-inflicted. Memories of before flooded Steve with bitter regret for all the ways he too had insisted that Tony fight himself, fix himself. He hadn’t been close enough to see, then. As if he’d been judging a painting based on a montage of cheap partial photographs, he’d let himself be fooled by the clashing perspectives, the lack of focus; he’d spent years refusing to acknowledge the artistry before him, until some weird twist of circumstance allowed him to get close enough to correct his mistake. Let him stay close enough for long enough to appreciate the details without losing his overall perspective, an appreciation that over the weeks built towards awe.
?” he asked, his voice dripping with contempt. “Why the fuck would I ever do that, Rogers? So you can kick me off the team completely?
“Congratulations,” Steve called out; Nebula scowled, but ducked her head in acknowledgment.
It came as no surprise to Steve when not a single person declined.
“All ships are approaching Wakanda,” Friday said. As predicted. Thanos was going for the Mind Stone, but this time he would take no chances. He would throw everything he had at them, try to overwhelm the Wakandan team’s defenses.
She was sitting neatly by his side, a slight redness around her eyes the only flaw in her immaculate appearance. “Hi,” he breathed.
The trembling increased; Thanos looked up, and Steve realized with a sick jolt that the Mad Titan was
At the sound of his voice, Tony raised his head, glaring right through him as if daring him to comment. “What, Rogers, never seen a grown man cry?”
Oh. Tony shut his mouth, now feeling extra stupid. “That’s… I mean…”
Her doctors kept telling him her recovery was slow but proceeding well. They kept saying they’d let him know when she was strong enough for visitors.
Steve sighed again. “You would have been kind, Tony, I know. But I’ve seen how many people get pulled into your orbit, how often they end up wanting more than you can give. The burden of that… I see how it weighs on you. And I didn’t want to be someone you had to push away. So keeping my distance felt like I was keeping you close, in a weird way. As close as I could get, anyway. I don’t know. Does that make any sense?”
The other man released his breath all in a rush, his body curling in towards Tony but still hesitant to touch. “Are you sure?”
“A soul for a soul,” the Stone said slowly; the small girl gasped. “I accept your bargain, Thanos of Titan.”
Tony exhaled slowly. It definitely wouldn’t be his first preference for a conversation, and he wasn’t sure he was ready to be reasonable yet, but Steve had his sad face on, and that was not okay. Not today. “How about you say whatever you wanna say, and I’ll listen. I just… may not have much to add.”
Yet even as fresh despair drained the life from Steve’s limbs, Tony stood and made his way around the table with cool, deliberate steps. Steve sat still, helpless, as the other man stopped beside his chair. “And we are
Beside the bed, Helen Cho gave him a comforting pat on the shoulder. “Just one more,” she said, her quick hands already fitting another blood vial to the freshly placed needle in his hand. Seconds later, her work was done, and she stepped back to a friendlier distance. “How are you feeling?” she asked.
Dropping his show of disinterest, Tony eyed him flatly. “Not gonna lie, wouldn’t be my first choice. But you’re too dangerous to let loose, otherwise.” And if Tony’s gaze flickered in Steve’s direction before he stopped himself, it probably didn’t mean anything. A reflex. Coincidence. Besides, even if he could think of what to say, the shame was gathering thick in Steve’s throat, leaving him too choked up to speak.
Steve
Ty’s gaze narrowed on Tony’s face; Tony’s stomach lurched as if he was physically in the room. “Oh, my sweet, foolish Anthony. Did you really think the truth wouldn’t come out? Hospitals aren’t secure, you know that. Even I can’t sit on this story forever. People are already whispering about your conspicuous failure to fight for Earth. About what a horrendous disappointment you turned out to be. Imagine what they’ll say when they see all of this…” He gestured wide to the screens around the room, still displaying their unspeakable horrors.
Steve wondered if Tony’d slept at all while he was away.
“Oh, you know,” Tony grumbled. “A couple centuries. I never realized how stressful baking is– my feet are killing me.”
“Yeah,” he says, and they grab their overnight bags, lock up, and check in. The fluorescents inside are even harsher than the ones in the lot, and Tony’s glad when they step into their room and into the low-lit lamplight.
He pulls the meat out of his wrap, clicking his tongue at the kitty, and still it just stares. It’s not until Tony dangles a slice of turkey over the edge of the bench that the cat pads quickly over and snatches the meat from his hands.
“Yeah, but I mean—you can get cuisine from anywhere on the globe in this city. I’d be more than happy to broaden your horizons.”
“Yes,” Tony said, looking terribly guilty. “Now you know. Cap, I-- I’m sorry. I never should have kept this from you as long as I did, I just didn’t know what you would think.”
“It’s your right shoulder, correct?” she asked. Steve nodded. “Mr. Stark, please help him remove the upper part of his costume. I need to have a look.”
“We found the mechanism of the maze, we think,” he said. “Inasmuch as it’s a mechanism, that is. It’s obviously magic. Big glowing purple gem.”
“Tony?”
“Is it though? Usually if it’s just work you try to leave that at the office.”
He didn’t have his shield, so he launched himself at the doppelganger. “Get away from him!” he snarled.
Spider-Man could recite parts of Cap’s spiel like a kid reciting the pledge of allegiance.
In the meantime, Steve closed his eyes and enjoyed the flight.
“Some people like a little nature with their nature, Giant Girl,” Logan snorted.
“You’ll have to work for it,” Tony warned.
When he was done he reached for Tasha, resting a hand in her hair, and scooted closer. He kissed the side of her head.
Mr. Stark is down that hallway and two doors down on the left it’s a big room you can’t miss it. Sorry bye!”
Tony wants— he just wants to give Steve everything. Worldly possessions, comfort, the broken, disparate parts of himself. All the love he has to offer.
“Tony, just because you didn’t like the output on the NAC project—“
“What do you need me to do?” he asked, gazing around at the kitchen.
“I can think of worse people to be temporarily stranded with,” Tony allowed, faking disinterest.
. Tony Stark.
“Just breathe with me,” he says.
“That’s okay, it’s only Steve’s third favorite,” Tony says, and quietly continues to stroke the cat.
Steve shook his head, smiling ruefully. “She’d have liked you.”
“I can see that.”
Storm’s communicator beeped. “Hey, Storm?”
“Tony Stark,” Steve said numbly, dropping onto the edge of his bed.
Tony groaned. “Christ, I am so whipped. I cannot believe this.”
Steve still wasn’t sleeping much. His therapist told him not to feel discouraged, but it was hard not to struggle with the contrast between his days, which he had come to enjoy, and the nights, which he inevitably dreaded.
Tony breathe a sigh of relief, slumping back on the chair as soon as all the rest of the personnel went out. With this Bucky was safe under their wing.
With the promise to come back a year later, during the rainy season.
“Did you come to take me away?” Bucky asks in a timid voice.
Peter’s POV
Steve looked into the warm, juicy red cavern of the brunet’s mouth and examined it.
Inside the elevator~
They reluctantly pulled away when they began to run out of breath and stared at each other lovingly, smiling. Tony buried his head on the alpha's chest, his smile growing wider when he was embraced by big, strong arms.
He was lucky he caught him just before the Avenjet took off. Steve was dressed in his Captain America gear and currently doing some last minute check and Natasha already in the pilot seat, ready to go.
“What are you trying to do?" He stutters on his words, a bad feeling crept up from the pit of his stomach.
Steve cracked an uncomfortable smile. Grabbing her hand and gently pulling it off of him as he thanked her for the towel.
Tony Stark, the omega son of the wealthy businessman, alpha Howard Stark, was Steve Rogers’ beloved mate. They got married at the age of 24 and had a beautiful baby boy named Peter. They had a great life going for them but like most things in this world, it didn’t last long. Due to a sudden, incurable illness that had befallen Tony, he died at the age of 29. Leaving his alpha and barely five year old Peter behind.
“That’s nice of you to say, Peter and I’m glad I was able to keep my promise to the end. I’ll be going then.” Saying that she got onto her small delivery truck and went back to town.
“Who is?” The guy asked with a shitty smirk. He step forward and grabbed his wrist, leaning into the brunet’s space.
He watched Tony brush his fingers over the photo, looking like he was in a trance of sort. But he looked a little more relaxed from the way his shoulders loosened up.
“The guy should mind his own fucking business.” He spat out looking away.
The rest of the team was anxiously waiting for the news about Barnes. They were all present in the common room of the tower, sitting on the couch and waiting for their friends to come back. As soon as the two of them came out the elevator they bombarded them with questions about it.
The next few days were spent like that. Waking up, eating food together, and seeing off each other to school and work, Tony helping out wherever he can.
“Nothing but the best.” Steve says proudly. Tony smirks. “I guess I’ll leave you to it now. Goodnight, Tony.”
“Am I wrong?” Steve asked him, unsure, squinting his eyes at him.
Even looking away from the gaze Tony could feel the intensity of it boring down at him. He let out a frustrated groan, ruffling his already tousled hair. Then he sighed, whipping his head around to face Steve.
“Teacher!” Peter called out to their class teacher, Miss Wanda. She was Peter’s favorite teacher. She understood him better than the rest of the staffs. Even his strange behaviors. “Something incredible happened yesterday! It was amazing!”
This is all I can do for him.
Steve watches Tony buried his face onto the pile of ice, standing still beside him. The brunet was like that for a whole two minutes now. Was he alright?
Happy quickly ran after his boss.
“Hey! Be careful man!” Tony had shouted at the guy who apologized and quickly ran away. When Steve lends him a hand he found that the brunet’s hand was bleeding. He told him to get it treated by the school nurse but Tony declined saying it was only a scratch. Steve had then offered his mother’s hand embroidered handkerchief with his name woven onto it for Tony to wrap his wound. Tony refused it again but then reluctantly took the offer. Steve had just finished wrapping it for him when he was called by his mother to take a picture together and that was the last time he saw Tony.
Yep. He was the type of guy who was kind to everyone. Even his good for nothing fucked up brother.
Little did he know that he wasn’t the only one doing the eavesdropping.
I could still picture those moments like it had happened just yesterday.
“You look like you haven’t age a bit, Cap.” Clint said with a playful smirk.
Steve took that chance to explore his omega's mouth, deepening the kiss. Tony enthusiastically returned the action, leaning further into his alpha.
“Well, I wanted to see you off and wish you luck. What? I can’t do that?” He raises an eyebrow.
“Sure, go ahead, Tony.” Steve said.
“Sorry.” He says. “I’m really tired so I feel kinda jumpy.”
“So that’s why.”
“What are you so pissed off about all the time?” He continued, looking him straight in the eyes. Intense blue gazing down at dark brown ones. “What is making you do this, Tony? Tell me.” He demanded.
He had looked so pained in the last part. Barely choking out the words. It made Tony’s resolve even stronger. He may not like Bucky but Steve, he did. Quite a lot to be exact.
It may not be clear but if one looks closely at the billionaire it can be seen that he looked a bit nervous and quite anxious for the impending meeting with SHIELD and the US officials on the topic of the Winter Soldier.
Tony called Steve and Bucky to his lab and told them about how they would start the recovery process with his latest invention which would help the second super soldier to regain memories from his past and also to slowly remove Hydra’s mind control over him. A device which he made with Helen Cho's help.
Tony helped Peter took a bath one afternoon and finally asked Peter what the key around his neck was for to which he was told that it was for a time capsule which he and Peter hid a year ago. That his papa didn’t know about this secret capsule. Tony then told him that he wished he could see it.
Tony was frying sausages in a pan when Steve came into the kitchen.
“Yeah. Because back then I was just an average skinny, weak person even though I was an alpha. There was no great quality I had that would have impressed you. The track team was the only thing that I was really into. Even though I don’t really have muscles I was a quick runner. So, when I had to even quit the track team because of some health issues from over doing it, I had no interest in my surrounding. I also never really liked someone before. I was dejected. And because I was always an outsider.”
It was a merry night. Being with friends who knew him well felt like coming home again after a long road trip. It was somehow calming. A few more drinks down the throat Bucky finally brought up the topic of Steve’s family.
“It’s nothing. You don’t have to make a big deal out of it.” He quickly replied, looking away to hide it.
“Course you can, Pete. I won’t tell anyone. Trust me.” Wade replied with a proud smirk.
Steve looked like he didn’t particularly want to tell him. He felt that it was too soon but he couldn’t say no to Tony when he looked at him like that. With those big puppy brown eyes and trembling soft lips, so he nodded slightly. Giving in to his request.
“It’s okay. Starting today, let’s help daddy remember everything. Everything about you and me, okay?”
Steve smiled. “What? It was an important question to me. I didn’t want to watch them by myself. I enjoy it best when I’m watching it with you.” Hearing that made Tony happier than it should.
He heard a deep sigh. “Big bro.” The voice said. “Tony, I’m coming in, okay?” The door creaked open and in came his younger brother.
Steve and Tony took Peter for a walk in the forest in the afternoon. The little boy held onto each of his parent’s hand, laughing happily as they went along.  Getting back into a kind of family rputine they had before.
“With mom bedridden I was the sole bread winner in the family. Through a college friend, Bucky, who was also planning to drop out of college, gave me the idea of joining the army. I didn’t see any better option at the time so I went along with him and we got in. If it was me from my high school days I’d probably be cut out from the beginning but I was lucky to grew muscles and gained height as soon as I entered college. So, physique wasn’t a problem. I served the army for around three years but in a mission I injured my right leg badly and had a serious head injury. I survived but I couldn’t perform my duties well anymore. My leg nerves would suddenly freeze up and I had problem with loud explosions and cramped places with too many people. I resigned from the force soon after.”
“Well, we did have different mothers so it can’t be help if we don’t looked alike.” He commented. “My mother remarried Tony’s father.”
“It’s . . .ah, I can’t say it.” He replied. Eyes cast down at his feet.
But then it all went horribly wrong one fateful night.
“Really?”
“We first met each other at SHIELD high as freshman. My mom was a nurse, so when she got a new job at one of the hospitals in New York we move there from Brooklyn, and I finished high school there as well.”
This was good. He was able to talk normally with Steve. The awkward atmosphere was gone now.
“He won’t listen to what the likes of me has to say. And also, because that’s just how he takes out his frustration. Just let him be.”
"I promise I'll do a better job of it next time." Steve says with grin. Tony sent him a fond smile.
“It’s getting cold, isn’t it? My hands are freezing.” He said, his cheeks tinted pink with embarrassment.
Tony had pushed him away. Not allowing him to come near.
“Yes, Papa is right.”
“Ah, you see. . . A walk! The three of us were taking a walk together. It’s what we often do. And in the middle of that you got tired and so we took a small rest there. I think you lost your memory during that time.”
“That’s right. I gave birth to him; I still can’t believe it though.”
“Yeah?” He didn’t even dare turn around. Afraid that Cap could see how red his face was right then.
“I didn’t like you?” Tony asked as they took a seat at the entrance steps of the abandoned mansion they were before.
Steve sighed. “If something is bothering you tell us. Let us know and we will help you however we can. I'll do my best to help you too.”
“Why are you sitting so far away?”
“You bastard! How could you even say something like that?!" Tony could barely held back his tears.
“Yeah. And you and I, are a pair. We’re a couple.”
“Your father was the same. Hitting on Steve every chance he got. Back then I was just a soldier. I couldn't  do anything to someone as rich and powerful as him so it felt great when I finally got to kill him in 1991. But I have to say, killing your mother was quite boring. She was so easy to kill. I just gave a squeeze on her neck and she died."
”You’re important, so I won’t say it.”
“Yay, daddy fixed the heater!” Peter cheered and ran over to the heater to warm up his cold hands. “So warm and toasty~” He sighed happily.
He’s so close whenever he touched him gently. Whether it was for comfort or when he was treating his wounds.
“Maybe a little.” Steve admitted with a small smile.
‘It hurts. . .My heart is going to. . .break.’
“Why is that?”
“If that’s what makes you happy. I’ll do it.” He spoke with his back to his brother. His voice low, barely audible to the ears. Fingers clenched so tight that the veins were clearly visible on the back of his hand.
“I would love to~” He replied with playful grin.
He took out the plate and proceeded to the microwave to heat it up. Then with the steaming plate of spaghetti in hand he pulled out one of the dining chairs. He proceeded to shove food into his mouth, letting out a satisfied moan.
“What do you want, Steve?” Tony mumbled. He was spread out in his bed with a physics notebook covering his face.
His whole body trembled in ecstasy when he finally released his semen all over his hand. He brought it up to his eyes, breathing roughly as he stared at the liquid dripping down his fingers. His vision started to became blurry with tears that were now brimming in his beautiful brown eyes.
“But I treated you coldly over the past few days and stubbornly ignored you even when you wanted to talk to me. I feel so terrible.” He says choking up at the end, burrowing his head in the crook of Steve’s neck. Loosely returning the embrace.
“Tony. . .” He starts to say but he was cut off.
“Hey, Wade.” Peter started. “Can I tell you a secret?”
Steve smiled, leaning forward.
“Yes. And it’s all thanks to Tony. He was able to convince them. So, it was really all him that made it possible. Tony is really amazing, isn’t he?”
As he was prepared to leave, Steve gave a once over look to the grumpy brunet huddled on the bed. “Does anywhere else hurt? Anything?”
He was secretly glad that Steve had decided not to go after him. He seriously couldn’t handle the super soldier right now. Right now he fucking needed to be alone. He had to get his emotions together because at the moment, they were all over the place.
“Hey, Tony?” Steve says looking at the brunet who was sitting at the end of the seat, as far apart as he could manage in the car.
“It’s already been a year since Tony passed away. How are things going with Peter?” He asked, making eye contact.
“I hope we weren’t disturbing you two.” Fury says raising an eyebrow.
He just couldn’t deny that anymore.
For some reason he felt like Barnes was squeezing his hands a bit too hard. But Tony shrugged it off as the soldier’s nervousness. Little did he know that from that day on his life would never be so peaceful again.
If anyone saw how the two of them had treated each other on their first meeting they also wouldn’t believe it either. They were polar opposites. Like fire and ice. Always repelling each other, never able to agree on anything without starting an argument first. But it happened anyway. As time went by and they really got to know each other, not just what they show on the outside but how they really were on the inside as well. They both found that they weren’t so different from each other.
“I just wanted to have a talk. Am I catching you at a bad time?” Tony says meekly.
“What was what?”
So when Steve had confessed to him about Bucky being alive, brainwashed to work under Hydra as the Winter Soldier and how his best friend had killed his parents Tony didn’t know what to do. If they were their previous antagonistic-selves he would simply beat the crap out of the guy and kick him out of his tower. Maybe even quit the Avengers altogether. He would just have more reasons to hate the guy. It would have been so much easier to hate him. But Steve was his best friend now. Which made it so much harder.
“I don’t know. I seriously don’t know either!” He replied in frustration and dropped his face into his palm. He seriously couldn’t believe it was actually happening. Tony actually came back to them. It wasn’t his hallucination. It wasn’t just him, Peter could also see him.
Tony nodded. There was no reason for him to go out anyway. His memory was blank except for that of yesterday’s events and he’d just brought himself trouble going into town with no memories. It was better to stay at home.
“Ahem.” A voice interrupted from behind.
He remembered strong hands that touched him so gently and his whole body shivered, tingling all over.
Soon the rest of the team left leaving him and Steve.
“I’m good, a bit sleepy but I’ll make it.” I told him, smiling. It must have been a shitty attempt to hide my tiredness as he just stood there and stared at me, looking at me with those worried blue eyes of his that I tried to give him a bunch of other reasons to no worry so much. But then he stopped and gave a soft sigh.
“Alright, fine. If you Avengers think you’ll be able to handle Barnes we’ll leave him to you for the time being. But on two conditions. One, if he ever goes out of line we’ll take him in. No questions asked. Two, he is not to take even one step out of the tower without at least one of you with him. Is that understood?”
“It’s nothing. Just a scratch.” He brushed it off. He hung his bag on his shoulder proceeding to walk away from the scene.
“You both look totally disheveled like you had a rough sexy night. Also I saw you enter Cap’s room and I guessed you never left~”
“It may be burnt but everything you make, you make it with love so it always tastes good to us, right Peter?”
Tony chokes back a cry.
His hands wandered to his chest, his stomach and finally down to his pants, undoing the button and zipper. Loosening it down to his knees. He gently played with his nipples with one hand, the other rubbing his quickly hardening cock through the fabric of his underwear.
Tony noticed that Steve had forgotten to put on his helmet again so he shouts out to him. “Your helmet! Put it on!”
Could the blond alpha and his son be speaking the truth? Did he really suddenly lose his memories during their walk? They didn’t look like bad people or the type to lie. Instead they were quite friendly and thoughtful in their ways.
Good, he was alone.
They still worked together well, like that of finely tuned machines in the field as if they never had a problem in the first place. But their private life was a whole other thing. Tony didn’t speak to their captain for anything other than what was absolutely necessary both during missions and at home. He even avoided coming to team bonding activities like having lunch, playing cards or watching movies together.
“I’m not lying. I’m just not allowed to say it.” Peter retorted meekly but they continued to tease him.
He wiped the blood dripping down the side of his mouth, panting. Staring down at the guy groaning in pain at his feet.
Peter wanted to hug his dad but the person before him seemed so lost to see him, no familiarity to him, that he stopped himself. Frozen in his spot, a few steps away.
And to think he told him this just before they got to watch the movie planned for that night. Way to ruin the mood.
But I didn’t want our meeting to end like that. It was just too heartbreaking for me. Summoning all my courage, I turned back and I asked you out for coffee. I think I was holding my breath the whole time until you finally said yes. At the coffee shop I couldn’t help but kept on talking. About the various things that were happening in my life so far and stupid things like what book I was reading. I’m not a talkative person. . . I just didn’t want you to leave. I felt like if I stopped talking, you would leave. I think I ended up spewing out my feelings for you. You looked really shocked at first but then you gave me a smile so bright, it melted my heart and worries away. When you went to see me off we exchange numbers, you promised to text me everyday. That’s how we began, you and I.”
Tony was furious at first but then he let out a sad sigh, looking down at his feet. “I guess he doesn’t like me, huh?” He says clutching on his hand as he quietly walked away.
Steve sat up to look at Tony’s face and found it to be filled with tears. Staining the beautifully bruised face of his brother. There was so much pain in those eyes. Seeing that made his chest painfully clench inside him.
Tony then showed Bucky to his room which was located the nearest to Steve’s. He thought it would help since it doesn’t look like anyone else would be able to handle him well. Steve was the only one he recognized and the rest of them were complete stranger to the guy.
That’s gonna hurt like a bitch. He thought.
“But you also had a part of you that was distant and hard to approach and a defensive aura. Maybe that was because you were the only omega in class filled with betas and alphas but I liked that about you too. Yeah, I liked you a lot.” He continues with a pleased sigh.
Tony mentally face-palmed. “I thought you were gonna ask me something serious. You got me all worked up for nothing.” He says with an amused pout, giving the blond a light punch on his shoulder.
How much longer does he have to continue to hide this pain in his heart?
“What was that all about?” Tony asks.
"Papa. . ." Peter choked out, standing by his bed side.
Tony was on one of his all-nighter inventing spree his stomach started to growl. He asked Jarvis what time it was and was told that it was already 2:30 in the morning. He bent over and opened his secret snack container but found it empty. He then decided to just get something to eat from the fridge. Maybe there was some leftover of Steve’s or Bruce’s cooking. Well, that is if Hawkeye didn’t get his hands on it first.
After he returned with a hot, edible cup of coffee he sat on the couch and looked out at the night view. He felt as if everyone was feeling quite happy down there. Families spending time together, the kids smiling and laughing as they hold on to their parent’s hands. Group of friends who were out drinking, some playfully chasing each other on the streets.
Steve gently pulled the book off his brother and placed it by his bedside table.
But with a quick step to the side Tony avoided it easily and gave the guy a taste of his own fist instead. A hard one on the nose.  Tony felt the bones cracked under him.
Steve could still picture it clearly in his eyes. The way Tony would look so engrossed in his notes as he jots down a bunch of difficult looking mathematical equations. Not caring about the lessons going on. Like he was in his own carefree world. He had often caught himself staring a tad too long at the omega when that happens.
“I am?” He said in a nonchalant manner. But then his eyes turned sadistic and vicious. “You’re one to talk. You take advantage of his kindness for your own immoral feelings.”
Steve let out a sigh of relief holding a hand on top of his chest, feeling the anxiety slips away from his body. But he didn’t leave. He continues to stare at the sleeping figure before him.
Yes. Steve didn’t know. If he did, he’d have already done something about it a long time ago. He would have already mended the bond he had with Tony. The bond that had somehow crumbled along the years.
“Okay. . . .I really want to see daddy.” Not knowing what else to do, the alpha hugged his child in an effort to at least give him some comfort this way.
Steve laughs at Tony’s angry outburst. He was so adorable. Then he remembered something more.
“That’s not fair, Cap. You always take his side. Just because you got the h-!” Clint was cut off abruptly by a pan flying straight to his face, knocking him down from his seat with a loud thud. He groaned in pain caressing his face with his hands, rolling on the floor.
“Alright, good. Then, I’ll see you later okay.” And with that he started to ride off, still looking back at the brunet as he did.
Steve grabbed the kit from the bed.  Then he leaned over to gently pat Tony’s soft dark brown hair, smiling and walked out the door, closing it behind him.
Steve arrives a minute later, hastily parking his bike near the open space of the clinic and rushes over to them. He apologized for being late and told Peter to wait outside while he talks with the good doctor for a few minutes.
He his eyes caught a pair of beautiful robins hopping along the balcony of the house. They must have come here to use it for shelter from the strong down pour.
Tony then felt the shift of his bed as Steve got up. Dragging his shoes along the floor as he approached the door.
“What? I’m not totally avoiding you, am I? I listened and followed all your orders during mission and worked well with the rest of the team so I’d like it if you leave me alone, Cap.” Tony scoffed. “I got work to do.”
The room remained silent.
“Thank you.” Steve says as he did the same.
“Bucky, meet Tony Stark. He’s my best friend in the 21st century.” Steve introduced them to each other, clearly excited to meet up his two best friends.
That night as Steve watched some family videos the rain started to pour down the earth.
“I’m doing well, Sam. Thanks for asking.”
Steve felt himself smiling, this was so very Tony.
“But papa, this is such good news. Why can’t I tell anyone?” Peter asked, not getting the situation.
“I look really happy there, don’t I?” He asked Steve, turning to face him but the blond alpha kept silent and looked away, not giving him an answer.
When Steve and Peter came home they found Tony and machine parts spread across the common room.
It may have just been a magical vision conjured up by the forest.
🙂,' in big, bold letters and at the side was ‘
Tony’s mouth gaped open like a fish.
Tony realises his feelings for Steve and Bucky resorts to painful methods.
They asked him questions but he couldn't answer any of them.
“I wanted to apologize.” He started getting the blond’s attention; he then turned to look him straight in the eyes. “Steve, I’ve been an insufferable idiot the past week and I’m so sorry for the way I behaved with you. I was just so mad! And even though it wasn’t your fault I put all the blame on you when it was actually my fault. Please,... forgive me.” He says with glassy red, tired eyes.
“Alright, that’s enough, Clint. Stop antagonizing Tony. That’s an order.” Steve says from the counter, trying to grab a pan to make some omelette for breakfast. Tony stuck out his tongue at Clint.
“That reminds me. Are you and that senior, Tony Stark, really brothers?” She said sweetly but Steve could see, hear the disgust in her tone.
For a second, Steve’s eyes landed on Tony’s soft looking slightly chapped lips. He then let out a chuckle on seeing Tony’s trembling self and shook his head with a fond smile.
The guy yelled, running at him head on. He brought his fist into a tight grip as he aimed it right at the brunet’s face.
Tony brushed passed Steve, bumping against his shoulder rather harshly as he did and closed off the workshop door as soon as he got inside. Telling Jarvis not to disturb him unless a world threatening danger occurred.
“Good morning, Peter. Did you get enough sleep yesterday? I know that project of yours must have kept you up for quite a while.” He said taking out a carton of milk from the fridge and pouring it into a glass.
“What?” Tony was astonished. “Then, when does our love begin?”
“Dr. Banner said I’m doing better now. Don’t worry about me, Peter.” Steve assured him. Peter looked unsure but then he couldn’t help hiding his excitement and quickly agreed.
He propped up the radio on the tree stump next to him and switched it on again. This time it was the news. As he quietly spent his time relaxing he was startled by a cold object being pressed to his cheeks. He looked up and saw it was Peggy Carter, a recent addition to the firm, grinning down at his stunned expression.
“You’re a failure as a big brother.” The guy added.
Tony scoffed at him, glaring with the same intensity.
Tony pouted. “Well, try harder next time. That was poor performance, Cap. I'm offended to call you my accomplice in crime."
Tony’s brain short circuited. What the hell was he up to? Was Steve trying to kiss him or what?! He’s getting so close!
Unfortunately, even after a week had passed Tony showed no sign of regaining his memories. Since he was asked not to go out by himself he was stuck in the house, feeling bored as heck while Peter was in school and Steve busy at work. There was nothing interesting to do. He flopped down on the couch and groaned in annoyance. It was raining again so he couldn’t even venture into the forest for a little sightseeing.
“Alright then. Promise to get at least some sleep during breaks, okay?” He told me to which I nodded in reply.
“I don’t know about that. I’ve already got a permanent roommate in my body,” Bruce said, taking another lazy bite of food. “Not sure that kind of cohabitation should stack.”
“I love you too,” he said, pressing a kiss to the corner of her mouth. “Of course I do. Can I stay?”
Of course Steve had an asthma attack.
“Well,” he said slowly, thinking a little. “A sandwich, first off. Want one?” He opened the fridge, pulling out ingredients.
“Start it up, J,” Tony said. “I’m gonna review the diagnostic for the arc reactor, a little light multitasking.”
Name me or face me."
Ding.
“Right, got it, thanks,” Tony says sharply, and Pepper eyes him narrowly.
Steve catches one of Tony’s flailing hands and pulls it over his heart. “I wouldn’t be averse to a long engagement,” he says, smiling, and Tony loops his arm around Steve’s neck and kisses him hard.
She shot to her feet, face darkening. “You little slug--”
“I’m not gonna be the only one to hang around you, I know how that looks,” Natasha said.
“Got to go, Pep, I have a lunch date,” Tony grins, and dashes off before she finishes rolling her eyes.
“Well you’re sure as hell not me,” Steve snarled, and bent to pick up the scepter. It seemed to whir coldly in his hand.
“I’ll say,” Tony chuckled.
“Oh, I’m sorry, do you need me to stop showing stress in your vicinity? I’ll get right on that—“
“Well, if there’s ballroom dancing and a goblin king, I might be in,” Janet joked.
too close. Whatever it was wasn’t bothering him right now, but eventually it would get bigger and its roots would get deeper and then they’d be
My thirst sated by youthful tears
“We don’t have to compete, you know,” Steve said one day. “My leafstalks aren’t hurting you.”
“He’s just-- a door.”
“What?” he started.
“Then what’s the problem?”
“Every day of my life,” Steve said, and exhaled slowly. One hand rested in Tasha’s hair, heavy and warm, and maybe the pain meds were starting to take effect, because she was starting to feel warm and heavy too.
Steve handed her the glass.
“…Am I supposed to be appreciating your restraint?” Tony asked incredulously. “Because I’m not really impressed.”
“The Tinker Toy in your chest hasn’t blipped for two years,“ Romanoff retorted. “I think it’s safe to say that it wouldn’t have 'spazzed' if you hadn’t done what you did to take care of that nuke. As unnerving as it is to think we’ll have to handle Loki again, I know I prefer that to massive loss of life.”
Unlike the human teachers SHIELD offered, JARVIS didn’t sigh at what Natasha called his “hunt-and-peck” typing style. Nor did he condescendingly congratulate Steve on remembering how to open an internet browser.
The other man sobered up instantly. “What do you need, Cap?”
“Hey,” Steve was saying, suddenly close enough to touch, “Tony, are you okay?”
Then he’d abandoned it.
Tony stayed silent, studying him until Steve looked up. His dark eyes were unreadable, but something about the moment made Steve’s heart beat faster, made his instincts thrill in an electric anticipation. Steve held himself steady, not sure what was happening. Tony tilted his head to one side, seemed about to speak, and Steve leaned in just a little, all the better to hear.
“He’ll come back,” Steve murmured, but the shapes of the words were drifting in and out of focus, blurring the urgency of their meaning.
Steve grinned and grabbed another cookie to decorate. “Go get the others. Tap out. Take a break.” He slid the cookie over to Tony. “This is a wonderful idea, Tony.”
“Would have been better if we’d managed to put that arrow in Loki’s eyesocket,“ she said.
Steve blinked at her sleepily.
Tony got a hand around his waist and hauled him in closer, so Steve could grip onto the armor with one arm. “A little warning would have been nice. Just a thought.”
It was probably a good thing that Steve felt tired, looking out over the borough, instead of bitter or burdened or bereaved.
“Your place in Calcutta wasn’t exactly a semi-detached townhouse, doc,” Natasha said.
They were sitting next to each other in barstools, curled toward each other like parentheses. The photographer got Steve in profile, grinning down at Natasha, while Natasha was in three-fourths, mid-laugh with her head tilted up toward Steve.
“I’d recognize that furrow in your brow anywhere,” a dry voice said. “What are you doing picking up a tabloid, Cap?”
“Hey,” Steve says, trotting into the kitchen, still scrubbing the back of his head with a towel. Natasha waves her spoon at him in greeting, still chewing on a mouthful of Fruit Loops.
Tony’s stopped touching him. He leans into Steve’s touches as readily as he always does, will still cuddle him, still kiss him, but only if Steve is the one who initiates. Steve even notices him, a few times, reach out to snag Steve’s hand in his, or begin to sway into Steve’s side— but then, inexplicably, he pulls back.
Rhodey and Pepper laughed at Tony’s displeasure.
“And you said—“ Tony grimaces, shaking his head. “Well. You know what you said.”
He skimmed the article, searching for any hint of logic. The gist of it all seemed to be that Iron Man was secretly a woman, the incontrovertible evidence for that being a quote from someone identified only as an “armor expert,” saying that boob plates are ineffective as armor.
“Tell me if I'm not loving you right. I'll do better,” he said.
Tony winced.
“What?” Janet asked.
Hulk was a wrecking ball, leaving cracked indents in the wall with every crash and roaring incessantly.
“Me?” Tony scoffed. “That’s sweet, but when I offered you a drink I really was just threatening you.”
Stepping inside, Spidey realized the room was actually a big sphere-- the floor sloped in perfect match to the ceiling. There was a door on the exact opposite side of the room.
And he thinks, well, maybe Tony wouldn’t tell him, if he thought he could stop Steve from worrying. If he thought Steve shouldn’t worry.
She also made a mean mint tea at midnight.
He has his answer now. And a bottle of whiskey. And a useless fucking ring.
Their exit comes up and Tony signals even though there’s no one on the road, and he turns.
“Socrates just knows he’s adorable like this,” Pepper said, picking him up off the couch where she’d deposited him for the general adoration of the public. “Don’t you, baby, don’t you?” she cooed. Socrates whuffed and licked her face, and Pepper allowed it, giggling. She, too, had maybe had a bit much eggnog.
She gazed back at him defiantly, face a little pink. “At least now I know I wasn't as obvious as I thought I was.”
“Stubborn, then,” Natasha supplied, smiling a little.
“That did not look planned,” Steve said, tapping his fingers on the rim of the popcorn bowl. “Whoever that was trying to steal the Cube originally was headed away from Loki.”
“Budge over,” he says. “And let me in, you cover hog.” He tosses the extra blanket over to Steve, and then clicks the control attached to it. “Electric blanket,” Tony explains.
Because of course he can’t just take it back to work. Pets aren’t allowed in the office, and anyway, he just has to introduce it to Steve.
There’s a bottle of whiskey on Tony’s worktable. He really kind of wishes there weren’t, but he put it there, so he supposes this is his fault as well.
He found himself leaping to the wall and sticking there before he quite knew what was going on, just as the ledge Bruce and Logan were on slipped away out from under them, dropping them into the sphere.
“And get
“There are roughly 6.7 hours of footage for review, Captain Rogers,” JARVIS responded.
Steve doesn’t want to marry him, but that’s fine. Tony just has to forget he ever thought he could marry Steve, and keep his mouth shut about his stupid hurt feelings.
“A bit,” Steve smiled slyly.
A dark-skinned woman with a doctorate in biochemistry, a nonprofit that provided free afterschool for at-risk youth, and a low-cut yellow dress kissed Tasha on both cheeks and bid her farewell, shooting Steve a little wink as she did so and taking most of the gaggle of women with her.
“Really?” Steve gaped. “You— really?”
“What’s wrong with that?” Tony thought. “To me, who has no right to ask anything of him. . .this is the only comfort I can get.”
He quickly took it off again, feeling like he didn’t deserve to wear it with the way things were at the moment.
“Everything’s gonna be fine, Cap. Leave it to me. I’ll get it done. And after this meeting you won’t ever have to worry about Bucky being taken away. He’ll be right where he should be, with you.” Tony felt hurt saying that part but he quickly shook his head. “I promise. So, stop being all gloomy and shit, it doesn’t suit you.”
Without giving a reply Steve and Peter took one egg each on their plate and started eating their breakfast.
He tossed and turned on the bed. He was finding it hard to drift off to sleep especially with Tony coming back and sleeping just next door. He got up, being extra careful not to wake up Peter in the process and quietly creped over to their room where Tony was sleeping soundly.
“That’s not coffee a human being drinks. That’s motor oil; I can’t drink motor oil, DUM-E.” He says tiredly. He hadn't been able to have a goodnight sleep ever since that night nor was his appetite any good. His face was visibly tired and his eyes red with dark circles. He got up as he put the cup on his desk and went to the counter to make one himself.
“Hmm, I think it was a one-sided love.”
Steve also soon came out of the garage on his bike. He stopped near Tony, getting off of his bike. He removed his helmet and hung it on his arm by the straps.
After they finished their breakfast Peter grabbed his bag and head out for school but not before giving a quick hug to his parents and saying his goodbye. Tony waved him off with a confused but happy smile at the little boy as he ran along the road.
He could still feel how hot his whole body became that time, just by Tony being near him.
“Daddy. . .” Peter spoke,
The captain of the cheerleaders approached him with a seductive smile.
Tony smiled fondly at it. It was small gestures like this that made him fall even more for the blond super soldier. Steve would make such a great boyfriend.
Steve was at work, whistling along to a song as he assembled the furniture parts together. Peggy watched him from the sideline, wondering, who was the one that made the alpha so happy these past few days?
His eyes were closed as he sat there. Waiting for his brother to treat his wounds.
Tony couldn’t believe it. He used to be pregnant with a baby boy inside him. He felt himself touching his stomach as he watched the rest of the video.
God, everything hurts. Why couldn’t the person who killed his parents be just some random Hydra soldier? Why did it have to be Barnes, Steve’s best friend since childhood? It was so complicated he can’t even laugh about it.
With a flick of the remote the movie started.
“You don’t have to believe. I’m sorry, please forget it.”
“That’s alright. You just need to do it slowly, there’s no need to rush.”
“What happened then?” She asked with a cheerful grin.
“A cute baby boy.” That Tony had replied with confidence, beaming up at his alpha.
Wanda was about to scold them but was cut off by Wade, “If Pete said something amazing happened then it happened. He won’t lie like you piece of shits.”
They all gave him a sympathetic look.
There was a soft creak as Steve sat down on the bed, settling down the first aid box as well.
“I see. Then, were you a good runner?”
He also found a bunch of broken household stuffs like toaster, fan, heater, etc. Feeling like there wasn’t much else to do he started tinkering with them. And after some inspection he understood the working and carried on to fix it with the tool box he found in the garage. He didn’t know where the knowledge came from but once he started working, it was like he knew exactly what to do and how to do it. It was amazing really. Where was all this information coming from?
It was him in all of them but why can’t he remember anything about it?
How much longer do they have to wait?
“Steve!” Tony scolded with a frown. “Couldn’t you have at least held that in for a few more seconds?” He says exasperated at the super soldier who was laughing out loud by that point.
(MZU sports is killing me (╥_╥)
“I see. . .”
Tony absentmindedly rubbed the back of his neck and closed his eyes. He tried to remember something, anything but his effort only gave him a headache. He opened his eyes and stared at the rain dripping on the floor of their balcony wondering what exactly was happening with him.
“He’s so bright. . .” He spoke out loud, taking another peek down the field.
Maybe he was taking this too seriously. Steve was brave enough to tell him about it even though he was sure Tony would be hurt by it. He hadn’t hidden it from him. That would have been a hundred times worse.
“Boss, your face is all red. Are you sick? Do I need to call an ambulance?” Happy says, all ready with his phone. Tony could see the nearby hospital’s ambulance number on the screen, just waiting to be dialed if needed.
“I don’t hear you denying you spent the night together~”
“Welcome back you two. Hope you don’t mind, I thought I’d fix them up for you. They’re good as new. Wanna try the heater? Here, dry your clothes over them.”
Tony can’t help it. He had never seen a better person than Steve.
“Tony, do you think it’s gonna be a girl or a boy?” The Steve in the video asked Tony who looked up at the camera with a smile, gently caressing his middle.
“Did something good happen?” Peggy asked.
Should he just accept it and move on? It wasn’t like anything could be changed. It’s something that had happened so long ago. But it still hurts more than he’d like to. He quickly ran passed Steve, getting out of the blond’s room and into his own, telling Jarvis to shut the door and forbid anyone from entering. The A.I responded that it was done and Tony quickly dived onto his bed. Burrowing his already tear stained eyes into the pillow.
After breakfast and some cake, I head for school. I took out my bike from the garage and paddled out. But as I looked back to the forest stretched out behind our home there was a sudden impulse and I felt myself cycling towards it instead. “A quick detour won’t hurt.” I told myself. I rode through the silent forest. The very path I would often take a walk with my parents. Gazing over at the old abandoned house, the one where we would often sit down and took a rest.
Luck came to him in the form of a set aside plate of spaghetti located at the bottom corner of the fridge, neatly wrapped up with his name written on it. It was Steve’s handwriting. It was written like this,
Just then Tiberius came along, grinning, yelling his name.
One side of the common room wall was filled with family photos. There were also shelves packed full of books of various kind. For a family where every member was men the place sure was neat. He searched around for the man and his son who had introduced themselves as Steve and Peter.
“You don’t have to be so scared. It’s just me.” Bucky says coming into the light.
But it totally backfired when he saw Bucky looking at him with repugnance. “You Starks seriously disgust me. Waving your money and body at others to gain their trust."
“That’s unbelievable! How dare he! If it were me I’d beat the heck out of him or at least sabotage the ceremony or something. I’d be so angry. I can’t believe you didn’t even get mad. Oh my god, Steve, you’re too nice for your own good.”
Steve rode his bike which he got as a parting gift from the US army when he sent in his resignation years ago. It had served him well through the years and especially now as his main means of transport to work. After serving in the army for three years and getting severely injured during a battle, he came back, moved to Marvel town and started working at a small furniture firm of their little town.
Steve reached out to caress his brother’s face. Trying to comfort him. He wanted to touch him. Wipe away the tears, the blood, the pain. Anything to lessen the distressed expression of his beloved brother.
Steve wanted to give Tony some space so he left the bed for Tony and slept with Peter in his room instead. He didn’t want him to feel cautious of him because he was an alpha. Tony may be his omega but he doesn’t remember that right now. Steve didn’t want to make him uncomfortable.
“Yeah.” He replied.
“No, of course you can. I’m really happy you did. Thank you, Tony.” He let out a satisfied sigh. “I’ll be back soon. Have fun at your meeting.” He tells him with a smile.
“It’s been a year since Tony passed away, right?”
“I’m sorry about that. Leave the cooking to me from now on, okay? But seriously Tony, we’re happy with whatever you make for us.”
With great difficulty he reached up for the first aid kit at the top of the kitchen shelf and patched himself up as best he could with his good hand. Then with a rag proceeded to wipe his own blood from the floor along with the tears he couldn’t help but shed.
“But that’s what our relatives were saying before during the funeral.” Steve could feel Peter’s grip tighten around his fingers. Looking like he was about to cry again. Steve bends down to cup his son’s chubby little cheeks.
He opened his eyes to see that it was Steve. The guy was an inch taller than him so he was being intimidatingly glared down at.
He turned up the radio and listened to whatever song was being broadcast like usual as he got to work. Pulling up the blueprint, selecting the wood, taking the measurements, cutting out the design and so on. After working on the project for a good three hours Steve decided to take a break. He pulled up a chair outside the workshop and sat down, watching his home which was barely recognizable from that distance and the thick green forest beyond it. It was a calming sight.
The brunet nodded timidly, tears were freely streaming down his face now.
“Did your little bro do this?” He asked. His face close to Tony’s, their lips almost touching. “This make big bro happy, right?” He slurred at him in his ears.
“Steve, write something for me.” He told him that time. Grinning at him as if they had been close friends for a long time.
Tony’s little brother Steve was really nice and a capable guy overall. He gets pretty good grades even though it’s not as good as Tony’s. The top player in the school’s football team since freshmen year. A person admired by both the juniors and seniors. A feat which was not easily achievable.
“You seem pretty happy about it.” Peggy said.
“Ice?” He paused. “That’s fine. I’ll wait for you.” Saying that he went over and stood by the elevator door.
Tony went over to Steve’s room, standing just outside his door. It had been a while and for some reason he was feeling quite nervous to even knock on his door. He awkwardly stood there with his hand hanging in midair, grimacing. Dammit, it’s just knocking the door, why was it such a hard thing to do right now? He’d done this a tons of times before all this shit.
“Uh, yeah. You aren’t. . .” He says confused, not quite getting it.
Looking closely he could notice that the brunet's ears were bright red but he decided not to comment on it at the moment.
That night Steve brought out some of the videos he had taken of Tony and two of them watched it together. It was a video where he was already pregnant, being visibly heavy with Peter even just by look of his round belly.
“Your big brother won’t tell you, Steve, because you’re the most important.” He said again.
Steve and Natasha didn’t come back for the next three days. Tony was starting to feel restless with all the waiting. He would keep walking back and forth in the common room as his teammates watched him do this for hours on end until Clint got fed up and forced him to sit down. Even when he was in his workshop he couldn’t concentrate either.
“Hey! You came crashing into me kid. Aren’t you even gonna apologize to me?” The guy yelled at him, grabbing his retreating back. Pulling him back by the collar.
“Working hard as usual I see.” Steve says as he set down the cup and snacks on the free space of the table Tony was using.
“Steve?” He had said, walking towards him. “I almost didn’t recognize you!”
That earned him a content smile from the said boy. Peter felt really happy that at least one of them believed him.
Tony wanted to know badly. Maybe hearing about it, it could help him jog up his memory. Peter and Steve were so kind to him even if he was part of the family. But right now he wasn’t the person they knew. He wanted to remember them properly. He wants to know everything.
“Aaargh! Steve, tell him to stop.” Tony begged in frustration.
“Why are you staring at the sky like you expect an airplane to come crashing down?” He asked after a while.
Steve was right. Tony doesn't recognised them.
He had totally forgotten about the meeting and where they were, getting swept up in his new found feelings. He hastily shoved the super soldier off him with a 'oof', stood up and adjusted himself.
And Peter, the kid was wonderful. He had known him for only a short time but he loved him already.
“Let go. I don’t need to tell you anything. You’re annoying.”
Just as he was handing over the sharpie someone knocked Tony over and he fell down with a thud. Steve sent a deathly glare at the offender who looked taken aback.
“He is your child after all.”
“I guess it can’t be helped that I’m such a great person to be with.” He says crossing his arm. “Alright, go get the TV and DVDs ready, soldier. Oh, and by the way it’s your turn to prepare the snacks.” He continues in an off handed manner trying to act calm.
He always knew his strong feelings for Steve wasn't just as a best friend. Rhodey was his best friend too but he didn't feel like this for the guy. When he wonders about life without Steve he found it to be unbearable. He just couldn't imagine his life without Steve in it. It just won't be complete.
“It’s part of the job. I can handle it.” The billionaire simply replies. Seeing his determination the agent finally gave in.
“Well, after a few months into college mom got sick and had to be hospitalized. I took a couple of part-time jobs to help with the expense but it was getting too much with the medical bills and college funds so I ended up quitting even before I finished the first year.”
“You . . .don’t believe me. . .” Steve replied, feeling down. Seeing how genuinely his friend sounded he cleared his throat and spoke again.
Across the table, dark eyes watched him, intent and unfathomable.
Steve could feel the Captain’s patience eroding, his urgency almost enough to overwrite Steve again, and cut to the chase. “You know what Thanos did?”
Six days after the world ends, Steve Rogers begins to cry.
Steve stared at him, eyebrows creasing in a frown. “Who?”
He tried to stand but collapsed forward, only Rhodey’s quick intervention stopping him from sliding right off the couch.
“I’m sure, sweetheart,” Tony said, the endearment falling so easily, so naturally from his lips. “I mean, I’m also freaking out, because living happily ever after isn’t really my area of expertise and emotions are terrifying and I am me so it’s hard to shake the feeling that any relationship I’m involved in is a complete disaster waiting to happen, but… I love you, Steve. So. I’m all yours.”
He pounced on Peter, swamping him in a giant hug. “Holy
, he thought, no other words making sense. No other word needed.
“-still refusing to contact the pilot, they’re saying that because Cho’s plane will land in two hours it doesn’t qualify as an emergency. But her assistant is already on his way to meet her at the airport, once she’s on the ground he will make sure she calls, then a helicopter will bring them straight here.”
were the one controlling
Steve took a step forward, then made himself stop. “Where are we?”
, exactly,” Steve hissed.
There is nothing left, now.
However… assuming a scenario where Steve was suffering complications of the feelings, but he really didn’t know how Tony felt… might he have dismissed that second kiss as just the heat of the moment? Or worse, some kind of pity move? A strategic retreat would then make sense, and simple embarrassment could also explain the super-soldier’s distant behavior towards him.
Strange’s cape twitched. “He’s not coming,” the Doctor said.
Of course, it was hard to shake the feeling that something was about to fuck it all up at the last minute.
Steve silenced him with a kiss, apparently unperturbed by where Tony’s mouth had just been, which in itself was hot as
“Figures.” Then Barnes grinned, and Tony couldn’t help but return a smile. This was not nearly as awkward as he’d feared.
The toll of protesting sent Steve sinking back into his pillows, trying to resist the sudden bone-weary urge to go back to sleep. Physically, he felt exhausted, but for the first time since the surgery, his mind felt clear, its usual sharpness emerging from under a thinning layer of residual fogginess, and he’d slept through far too much already.
Yet Tony didn’t move to attack. Instead he bowed his head and began to make a strange choking noise, almost lost amid the soft whine of the suit’s repulsors. Steve stepped after him, instincts screaming, but stopped as Tony recoiled. As the other man continued backing away, the stifled sound strengthened and resolved into something recognizable and hideous and gasping.
“…language,” came a soft voice from beside him. Steve opened his eyes, heart already filled with sunshine. His bed had been moved closer to the window, closer to Tony, his dark eyes serious behind the glass.
By the time Tony was done talking, his plate was empty and his blood sugar felt a little steadier; beyond that, it settled him, somehow, to speak the story out loud and make what had happened real outside his head. That other future had been comprehensively eradicated as a possibility; they would all be safe here in this weird, happy version of the world. Yet the memories were still alive within him, impossible horrors echoing through his head, even now. It may have been more convenient in the short term to stay quiet, act fine until they faded, pretend as if his phantom experiences were deletable, erasable. Convenient, but somehow horrifying; it felt too close to declaring himself deletable, if some miseries, some
As the alien ship took off, leaving behind one freshly severed alien hand, Stark’s helmet melted away. “Everyone good?” he asked, panting, eyes darting over everyone in visual range. Even Steve, briefly. Professional courtesy, Steve assumed.
“Then explain it to me,” Steve breathed, his eyes stinging at the defeat in Tony’s shoulders, the tremble in his voice. “I want to understand. Please, talk to me, Tony. Let me help you.”
She looked at him, that familiar proud smile. “Hello, Steve,” she said.
It’s neverending, Steve realizes, there is no place left for him to go but back to where he came from; he falls to his knees under the blotted sun as if to stay there til he rots, the sooner the better.
Steve sent a grin in his direction, looking offensively cheerful. “Felt like the right thing to do.”
No, if money could buy it, if he could build it, if there was something, anything on this planet or beyond that would help Steve Rogers live happy and healthy and safe… There was no other way he would let this end.
Tony had heard. Tony had promised. And Tony was still here. It was more than Steve could have dreamed, and the relief kept the words flooding out, a stuttering torrent that skipped haphazardly between sentences, nonsense swirls of half thoughts and memory fragments snagging on each other, as if fighting for release. Tony listened anyway, quiet as he steered Steve to the bed, settled him in to rest, held him close like some rare, fragile thing; somehow his attention helped the sharp pieces slide free, his presence smoothing them out, one by one. The surface part of Steve drifted through it all, wrapped warm and content in Tony’s arms, listening in fascination to his own voice babbling, on and on, until the torrent eventually slowed to a trickle, then eased, leaving only the occasional drip of sleepy whispers in the silence.
May didn’t falter. “Still in surgery,” she said. “It’s been five hours. But they say it’s going well.”
When Bucky finally tells Steve to get his ass together and go back to work, he does.
Steve couldn’t pick an answer, didn’t understand the question. “What?”
Evening debrief meant catching everyone up to speed on the day’s happenings over another meal, then the night shift would take over and the rest had downtime. Steve used these couple of hours to train in the gym unless he’d been on a mission, in which case he liked to join whoever was in the common room for the feel-good movie of the day. After FRIDAY’s cheerful voice was granted access to the rest of the palace, at times it almost felt like the old days at Avengers Tower.
“Oh, do shut up,” the Soul Stone said, and a blue band of light snaked its way around Thanos’ face, stifling his speech. “Perhaps I misspoke; listen is the wrong word.” She looked at Steve, Tony and Gamora in turn and smiled reassuringly. “It is more accurate to say we will… read.”
, you would never-”
Red Skull’s stare was almost as intense as Steve’s. “It would seem… Yes.”
Tony swallowed. “Yeah.”
“Uh, well, actually that’s a good place to start, kinda stand-alone but ties in later…”
, he thought.
Thanos had not been simply erased from their own timeline.
helped.
Too late. Natasha already had a blade at his throat, a victory smile on her lips. “Honey, we’re home.”
Sam is too kind to express it, but there is hurt on his face at what Steve has done, and for that alone, Steve feels a slight sting of regret. He hands Sam the new shield but does not tell him how it was made. It’s part of his agreement with the person who made it, that Steve does not reveal his involvement to a world still mourning his loss.
Thanos.
But that sentimental interlude led to a second revelation, because out of the two of them it was
Tony was not blushing. He was not. “Uh… I may have considered that to be a possibility…”
Steve tries not to snarl his reply but fails. “I’ve seen what it can do. Besides,” he tries to smile, again fails, “I know we can’t risk any more branches to the timeline. Bruce made that clear.”
“Tony?” Steve asked, his brief flare of anger fading back into fear. “What happened?”
never been that simple,” Steve whispered.
“You’re just saying that because you love me,” he whispered, the idea still fragile, questions lurking behind the words.
Tony closed his eyes, trying to think of a polite dodge, then shuddered, unaccountably full of grief. “Uh,” he managed. “Nothing?”
“Can you tell me what they mean?” Steve says softly. He catches Tony glancing at him, his concern as warm as the sun overhead, but Steve can’t look at him and mourn at the same time so he closes his eyes instead.
He could see Steve didn’t understand. “That’s okay, Tony, I get it.”
Yet Steve froze, suddenly unsure whether his apology would even be welcome. “Tony, are you- I mean, is there anything-” he tried to begin, his own voice cracking in a way he hadn’t heard in years.
“Oh god, get a room,” Sam muttered.
Steve’s arms tightened around Tony. “You’re a monster,” he spat.
“Gotta… gotta hurry,” he managed. Steve was quiet, and Tony tried to concentrate on breathing.
Tony found his voice. “You think Steve… and me? Why? If anyone, it would be you-” He broke off when Barnes barked a laugh.
But Tony wasn’t backing away. He was studying Steve like a diagram, still with that serious expression. “It’s gonna work, Steve,” he said then, softly. “This plan or another, we’ll get the job done. And if we do go to Titan, we’ll go together. Just like I promised.”
Tony held Steve close as he cried, soothing as Steve’s sobbing slid into laughter and back, the other man struggling to speak over his own tears. “I’m not even sad,” Steve choked out eventually. “I don’t know why I’m crying, I- it’s so stupid, I’m not sad, I’m not…” He managed to take a breath, looked up, tried to smile. “Really Tony, I think I… this is the happiest I’ve ever been.”
They sit in taut silence, the fire casting shadows between them.
He listened helplessly to his rocketing heart rate, the machines again exposing his neediness. His weakness.
“Steve, please,
“No, please, listen to me. I’m so sorry, Tony,” Steve said. But he could hear the defeat ringing through his own voice, doubt banishing hope itself, and in its wake came a deep and nameless terror.
At least Shuri’s request was a novel distraction. The young Queen was blasting some unfamiliar music as Steve entered the lab, nodding to the Dora Milaje positioned outside her door. Whatever the link was between genius and loud music, he didn’t know, but the unintentional reminder of Tony made him smile. Shuri spotted him quickly and beckoned him across the room.
“Together,” Steve reminded him with a smirk. Smartass. “Plus I got some breathers from Rocket, just in case.”
Tony took a slow breath and focused his attention on the Gauntlet. The inset Stones were intact, Eitri’s magical technology preserved; it seemed only the extraneous metal had expanded, thinning slightly to accommodate their linked hands. “Did you change it or did I?” Tony asked. “Or both, or neither?”
Steve barely noticed as she settled the mask over his face, still staring at Tony, unable to believe. The doctor made her goodbyes and left.
But, fuck, because there went his mind with the same old bullshit, trying to play the same old tricks. Setting himself up again as the lone judge and jury and defendant-executioner, hoarding blame as if it delivered control, because the familiar halls of self-recrimination provoked less existential terror than admitting that the best person he knew might have actually fucked up here, might have hurt him in ways that Tony hadn’t earned, had broken his heart without even trying, because if that was true, then regardless of how worthy Tony made himself, there could be no guarantees Steve wouldn’t do it again.
07:59, Friday 29th June 2018
, you can’t just cancel out countless living beings and expect the survivors to carry on like nothing happened. As if their loss wouldn’t affect everything that came after. That collapse you wanted to prevent so bad? Congratulations, it’s happening right now instead. But because of you, it’s happening
The scientist had a point, Steve knew, the rising hum of dismay in his chest blocking out whatever his teammates said next. The Accords dispute. The airport. Siberia. Each event had followed the previous as if inevitable, and yet… None of what Steve had feared had come to pass. He’d come back and signed, accepting four years’ parole in exchange for the opportunity to serve as an Avenger.
“Get him to the Sanctum,” Tony ordered. It was the last thing he had the breath to say for some time, as from that point on the fight with Thanos got… weird, and frantic, and terrifying, and did he mention weird? Reality morphed and changed, the ground itself rippling like liquid, cars launching themselves into the sky. Tony had to sacrifice a third of his nanobots deflecting several purple blasts from the golden glove before the fleet of drones he’d summoned finally arrived from orbit. Yet with one lazy wave, Thanos had turned each drone into a ginormous fanged butterfly and sent them chasing after Scott and Hope, which was just rude.
Thanos hesitated, then marched towards her, throwing a punch at her face. A punch which the glowing woman casually caught in her glowing hand. “I’m Carol, by the way,” she said, peeking past the nonplussed alien to meet Tony’s gaze. “Nick says hi.”
The billionaire sounded sincere. Steve wanted to believe he really was sincere. Yet he also knew Tony would sacrifice anything, betray everything, for a chance to do what he thought was right. It was a detail he’d somehow sneered at from afar. He flat-out hated it now, up close. But regardless, it was true and it was real, and so Steve had accepted it.
This time Steve was too far gone to play fair. “Well if that was the plan, why is he
,” she whispered, her face young yet her eyes impossibly ancient with remembered grief.
And wherever the path took him, Steve would be right next to him, keeping him safe.
Behind the doctors, May had slipped into the room. With a dull shock, Tony felt her hand on his shoulder. Everyone was looking at him now.
With the car’s privacy in sight, Tiberius sped up, his longer stride forcing Tony to uncomfortable effort, his grip on Tony’s arm becoming too punishing to ignore.
“That’s because having to listen to me sing qualifies as a war crime.”
When Wilson and Carol had left, Scott sat down beside Tony despite the many empty chairs. The former thief’s usual ebullience was nowhere to be seen as he slumped forward to stare at the floor. They sat and waited in silence. An endless minute passed, then another, until across the room, there was a outburst of frantic activity. Tony shot to his feet, Scott grabbing his arm to steady him. The blonde doctor was barking orders at her team as they rushed Steve away, out of sight. Strange followed for a short distance, then returned, approaching him and Scott.
Steve ignored the tiny jolt of disappointment and flashed a serene and totally non-wicked smile. “Don’t tell Bruce.” It was really such an inappropriate thing to say, but it sent the billionaire off into gales of laughter, enough to set Steve genuinely grinning in turn. Across the lab, Rocket and Thor looked over but turned away again, muttering to each other. Whatever they were working on, the symbols were in some alien script that to Steve’s unfamiliar eye looked like garlands of flowers drawn in ink. They were the only other people around; Bruce must be sleeping.
Just him and Steve, reaching for each other across the endless minutes.
to be it. He’d been scared, and confused, and got caught up in an old memory. Steve could explain everything now. And if he could explain, Tony might understand.
The screen went dark. They all stood for a moment.
“We need to buy you time, Steve,” Helen said quietly. “It’s the only way.”
His gentleness was hard won, because this time Tony was the impatient one, begging Steve to fuck him almost before Steve had opened the lube bottle. The other man refused his pleas, pooling the cool liquid in his hand before hauling Tony to lie on top of him and kissing him quiet in one smooth motion. With that same wretched deliberation as before, adding one slick finger at a time, Steve worked his ass open, ignoring how Tony was swearing against his mouth, a long desperate string of curses in several different languages. When Tony felt the third finger stretch him unspeakably wide, he couldn’t take the thought of waiting anymore, sat up and away, far enough to make his point. “
“It hurts,” Steve said.
At the sound, the other man stopped still.
Judging by his shrug, the kid did not, and Tony considered that a fitting end to the press conference. “Well then, I guess that’s all, folks.” He ignored the sighs of frustration, adopting a cheerily bored air. “Please make your way to the snack table, take a little break, maybe a power nap and we’ll be back shortly to hit the big red button. Wait, do we have a big red button?”
Scrambling, fumbling, warmth, blue glow orange glow and then Tony was opening his eyes, “WHAT the fuck-” but Steve cut him off, kissing him because Tony was warm and alive and then Steve was crying so hard he could drown so he buried his head in Tony’s neck and held on; a couple seconds later Tony was wrapping his arms around him, carrying him back to the surface, breath and sun guiding him home; always home.
Yet a dark worry fell across Tony as he stepped into the small room. Usually Steve’s bulk dominated confined areas without even trying; now his body was a small huddled heap on the floor. He sat by the bed, staring blankly at the wall. He’d grown a beard, a while ago by the looks of it. There was a hint of red around his eyes. Otherwise he looked fine. Maybe kinda bored, like he was waiting for something.
Without further thought, he stretched out his hand; Tony instantly reached back, yet the glass keeping them apart was cold and harsh as the void.
“Why are
“What! Excuse you, I don’t nap,” he snapped, sitting bolt upright as if to prove it. Wait, the air kinda felt a bit cold now, how was it cold now?
it. I couldn’t believe how fucked up I was, after. I tried to just move on and forget about you, as if nothing had happened. I didn’t want to think about you ever again. When I couldn’t stop, I told myself it’s because I hated you, but…”
The Doctor sighed. “We don’t have time for this-” he began, but Barton cut him off.
“Okay, I believe you.”
Tony’s eyes, closing, but he squeezes Steve’s fingers. “Everything,” he whispers. Grins. “Except maybe… the part where… this hurt so much, wow-” and then he whines through his teeth, the pain, the pain. “Steve? I can’t…”
Helen took a deep breath. “I’m afraid it’s too late for that. The tests showed significant exposure. An infection has already taken hold, and unfortunately, it is progressing rapidly.”
The guy on the gate was getting fired. “I… What a surprise,” Tony said, forcing enthusiasm. “I’ve missed you so much.”
of that. One month after Bucky’s fall, he’d crashed a plane into the sea, claiming necessity. And now here he was crashing again, mere days after losing Peggy. He’d walked away from his team, his friends, his
As it turned out, the route to pleasure lay along many of the same landmarks as pain, and Steve was nothing if not a quick study. As the night wore on, he couldn’t decide which part he liked more, his new-found ability to reduce Tony to a babbling mess, or the tender aftermath where Tony would lie spent in his arms, the perpetual chatterbox finally satiated into silence. Again, Steve marveled at how comfortable, how
“I’m not him,” he hears Tony say.
At the funeral, Steve had tried to imagine what he would have done if he had been there for her, right to the end. He tried to imagine how he would have said goodbye, but he just felt sick at all the words he still had left to say to her. All the questions he’d wanted to ask her, that now he never could. When they’d finally met again, here in this strange future, Peggy had been far more a stranger than she’d been the person he’d once hoped to marry. After that reality had sunk in, he’d enjoyed getting to know her, but the sad truth was that the woman who’d loved him had long since gone somewhere he couldn’t reach. Steve would have been of no more use to Peggy in presence than he had been in his long years of absence. She wouldn’t have missed him.
“Yes, it's making quite the sensation in the media, for better or worse,” Tiberius said. “I do try to keep the coverage minimal across my own networks, otherwise it would be terribly gauche, yet it seems the public can't get enough of our story. But of course, as Anthony likes to say, love is love. You will be joining us for the big day, I hope?”
Without Steve’s failures, Zemo’s elaborate plan would have fizzled out into nothing.
The youth of today had no respect. “Questions regarding my personal life are still a hard nope.” Tony’s grin was a polite wall of teeth.
Tony tried to nod but had to stop when it made his head swim, his feet seeming very far away.
The pain pierced him, pure and dreadful and forever; he crumpled forward, dizzy, but Steve’s arms gathered him up, strong and kind and sure. Tony thought he should cry, but no tears came. Instead he lay huddled against Steve, unable to stop shaking, hearing the other man’s whispered reassurances as if from a vast distance.
“That last break was pretty nasty, even for you. Honestly, I don’t know what you Avengers are trying to do to each other in these training sessions but maybe y’all should take it down a notch,” Dr Lewis went on.
Holy shit. Could Steve really have… L-word feelings? For
you? Are the other Stones alive? Are you alive? What do you mean by soul? Is it like a sentient consciousness thing? Or does everything living count? Do ants have souls? Do you know what an ant is? Is there life after death?” The billionaire stopped for breath but after the Soul Stone raised an arched eyebrow he stayed quiet; Peggy’s fool-quelling stare proving as effective as ever.
He took out his phone, turning it up so the tycoon could also hear. “You with me, Friday?”
Steve let the question sink through his whole body and still couldn’t find an answer. “I think…” he paused. “I guess.”
Tony studied the man, any fear he held paling in comparison to his growing contempt.
“Considering it was classified information, you shouldn’t even know his name,” Steve said, glaring at Stark.
It should have been reassuring, but somehow it only intensified Steve’s panic, his thoughts stubbing on the idea that Tony might still care, even after everything Steve had done. Because soon enough Tony wouldn’t care. Not anymore. After this, it would be too late.
Awareness flooded in, bringing scraps of haphazard sensation throughout his aching body. Thanos. The Sanctum.
Steve didn’t care; the Captain listened, assessing, cold.
At Nat’s nudge, Clint looked over; his eyes widened, then narrowed. Grudgingly, he nodded, so Steve tried to let his fury go, but it was just… Tony was trying so hard to act like he was okay, laughing with Bruce and Rhodey over the latter’s awful sandwich tastes, but here and there his hands would shake, and there was still that brittle edge to his smiles. Steve would not stand to see him upset, but from the soft looks from the rest of the team, they seemed to agree that Tony was to be protected. Gradually, the impromptu meal felt less like the tail end of a funeral and more of a celebration, the group only growing more raucous as the food ran out.
After much discussion, the eventual Rogers-led consensus was that Thanos had to be eliminated, and Earth had made itself the obvious battleground.
It’s not enough. It’s not enough but Tony blinks, then pastes a fake smile on his face. “Saving half the universe, huh? Worse ways to go.” Yet his eyes are hollow with their sympathy, and there’s a distinct tremble in his voice that wasn’t there before. The man looks
Then he moved off, heading for the same exit Tony had taken. Steve followed, trying to quell his sudden rush of worry. There was really no point in being nervous. Chances were Tony had already caught Zemo and was long gone, and it would be weeks or months before Steve saw him again.
A snort of laughter came from Steve’s direction.”Yeah, haha,” Tony groused, and stuck his finger in his mouth.
“This isn’t about the juice cleanse thing again, is it?” he asked, only half-joking.
The other man opened his eyes, looked down at him. “Tony,” he said seriously. “I love you.”
opinions, screw the rest of the world. So what the hell changed, Rogers?”
“He’s talking to Dr Cho,” Dr Palmer explained. “Her plane just landed so we finally got to speak with her. She’s raised some interesting concerns about your immune system’s previous dependence on the serum, so as a precaution we’re just gonna move you to isolation and minimize any unnecessary exposures until we can run some tests, okay?”
“Yes,” he whispers, and turns away to watch the city burn.
Roused to anger, Tiberius could always switch just as easily to lust, and was now unable to resist pinning Tony against the car, ruthlessly grinding against him. For the first time in months, Tony welcomed the pain, was able to transmute it into harsh pleasure; hot poisoned fuel for his own poisonous heat. So much like the early days, Tiberius cruel as a hurricane but Tony his savage equal. How reckless he had been, back in those early days. How heedless of the cost.
“One second.” Tony kissed Steve on the cheek, then turned to confront Ty, his fists clenching tighter at every step. The normally pristine man had been reduced to a trembling mess, but of course, his ego forced him to his feet at Tony’s approach.
But if this future could look like anything, he knew exactly what he wanted.
It had to be too much pressure for just one man, yet Tony was coping, he thought. Just about. So long as Steve was there. There were cracks, sometimes. Like when Nebula finished work on the
“I should have told you right away,” the other man said, regret etched across his face.
“Well, I couldn’t tell Clint I fell asleep on his favorite movie, so I hid in the bathroom looking for a recap and there was a YouTube channel with these furry things-”
Thor and Bruce were standing slightly behind the rest. The scientist had one hand on his own chest and one hand on Thor’s, and vice-versa. They both had their eyes closed and were counting breaths together, slow inhales, longer exhales. A fond smile came to his lips as Steve watched the unlikely pair meditate together. Bruce had been instrumental in those early days for getting Thor back on his feet, but truly the scientist had been nothing short of a revelation to Steve in the long weeks since the Devastation. His determination to keep helping in the face of futility was a beacon of reassurance to them all, gently guiding them through the most hopeless days, but more than that, his steady calm had proved by example that it was possible to keep some kind of equilibrium within the madness. Years of practice, he’d quipped once, and Steve had felt a hot sting of tears as he thought about how hard-won that wisdom had been. The scientist’s quick mastery of Jane Foster’s research on the Bifrost had helped Thor plead his case to the others, but for Steve, Bruce’s inclusion on the strike team was already a no-brainer, regardless of the Hulk’s ongoing refusal to emerge.
Tony stayed quiet, trying to focus on what Steve was actually saying, trying not to let his mind pick the words apart only to pour his own fears into the gaps. He’d spent the past two years blaming himself for their estrangement, as if he could have averted it by doing better, being better; as if Tony alone had possessed the power to shape the outcome. He was beginning to realize how distorted that belief was, how badly it had led him astray. Because on his own, he could never have solved this puzzle, would have instantly rejected any possibility that implied their fallout wasn’t all his own fault, but Steve’s explanation… It fit the facts so much better than anything Tony had come up with on its own. Perhaps too well, some dark part of him suspected. Perhaps it was too convenient, too neat an angle, the way Steve was shouldering so much of the responsibility; a great man yet again shielding Tony’s weakness at the cost of his own peace.
Tony said nothing, because there was nothing to say.
He heard Tony sigh, a careful and unhappy sound. “Not today, Steve,” the other man said. “Today I want to talk about us.”
She broke off, swallowing back tears. Tony reached out and took her hand, awed by her towering courage, her determination to trust. Like any good parent, her child’s happiness defined her whole world. She had to know that supporting Peter would over the years bring her more heartache than joy, but for better or worse here she was, taking on the challenge anyway. Finding a way to give Peter her fullest attention, her deepest trust. Time and again, her actions proving her love.
“I know you,” he whispered.
Nebula glared over at the billionaire, and Steve wondered if he should intervene. But the android just rolled her eyes. “Yes. Again, I am certain. This is Titan, restored to its former appearance by Thanos. As I have explained. Multiple times.”
No room for defeat. “Hey. Eyes up. Look at me, soldier,” Tony commanded, words like iron, cold and sharp. He waited until the other man complied, the fear in his eyes almost breaking Tony’s resolve. “Steve, please,” he whispered, his voice softening. “I know you’re scared, but you need to do this, okay? For me.”
He sat and Rhodey brought him soup and he could not remember the last time he’d had soup but it was good soup and gone all too soon. Rhodey was eating soup and bread. Worried the terrible hunger would return, Tony reached for the bread but Rhodey grabbed his wrist. “I know it’s boring but try and let the soup settle first, Tones.”
In his peripheral vision, he saw Shuri flinch, saw her try to turn it into a cough.
Honestly, Tony had expected more of a fuss, but it seemed Steve understood. Maybe he heard it too, the empty waiting for her. Loud and lonely. The super-soldier blew out a breath, looked back at Nebula. “Two minutes,” he said, then ducked out of the hut. Uh. An abrupt goodbye, but efficient, Tony supposed.
“It’s okay,” Steve smiles. “Go be a genius. I know how important it is. Just try to come to bed before the sunrise,” he adds fondly, smoothing a thumb under Tony’s eye and pressing another one of those sweet kisses to Tony’s mouth— and that, at least, he can respond easily to; ingrained habit. Muscle memory. The rest— the rest of it, however—
Steve grinned, triumphant. “It’ll be my pleasure.”
She smiled at him. Something about it made his heart squeeze in his chest.
Everyone did a quick comm check, answering one by one in the affirmative. “Are you picking up any interference with the comms, Iron Man?”
“I mean you should try asking your fiancée how long she’s been in love with you for. If the answer’s not approximately forever, I’ll eat my invite to New York Fashion Week.”
The answer to that question was quite a lot, as it happened — including but not limited to footage of the Hulk half-heartedly kicking at a fire hydrant at the same time as he was also filmed enthusiastically using a Chitauri footsoldier as a flail, and JARVIS’ scans of the arc reactor picking up miniscule boot-shaped footprints on the inner mechanisms.
“That’s not a thing, is it?” Tony asked, glancing at Natasha. His hands were still rubbing up and down Steve’s shoulders. “I mean, neo-Nazis, you see those, unfortunately, but Hydra was a whole different beast. Nobody’s Hydra anymore.”
” Jan insisted. “Besides, it may be from before you were dating, but it’s not from before you were in love.”
Natasha held up her thumb and forefinger about a centimeter apart. Steve huffed.
Judging by the wide-eyed look he’s getting now, anyway.
One dance.
“Oh good!” Tony said, in obvious relief. “You’re here. Help me, please, I’m just ruining them.”
She stared at the far wall. “I grew up— I got mad at her, for staying, sometimes. I thought maybe she stayed for my sake. I hated it. But she just loved him. She just didn't want anyone else.”
“Steve,” she said, her voice as smooth as an ice rink, and holding just the same hint of chill. “How many times have we had this conversation?” She began leading him away from the bar, and he hurriedly set his glass on a tray.
“That’s part of the
“You’re baking?” Steve asked, slipping his phone back into his pocket. When Tony had called him down to help with an emergency, he hadn’t imagined anything like this.
The video feed of the lobby whisked away, the audio fading out quickly, and was replaced by a feed from the elevator.
“Yes, sir. You may relocate there now if you please.”
“Happy spring, Tony,” Steve said.
No sooner had he spoken than enormous tentacles appeared on the walls in a brief flash of mist, immediately lurching towards the nearest Avengers.
” Tony finished, hands flailing.
He takes a deep breath. “Great,” he says. “How pissed are they?”
“This yours?”
“You gonna tell the American people on me?” he hummed.
“I don’t understand,” Natasha was saying. “They just handed it over. He couldn’t have been influencing them without the scepter. Why did that work?”
“I don’t care what we eat as long as it gets here fast and is packed with carbs,” Romanoff said. “Pull the trigger.”
Steve tilted his head back up with a sigh, letting the frozen beans fall into his hand. “I don’t think anyone could’ve asked more from you than what you did,“ Steve said, meeting Stark’s eyes. “You were a distraction. But I got my ass thoroughly kicked by Loki because my head wasn’t in the game.”
“Dog,” Clint said.
Steve’s brow furrowed. “I know he has a certain reputation, but I hardly think the rumor mill is--”
Bruce was unimpressed. “You’re about as winsome and charming as my other side is.”
Steve watched, bemused, as the hand grew in size to cover the whole bottom half of her face. She caught him staring and whipped the hand behind her back.
“Did Tony send you here for something?” he asked.
“Canoodling.”
“We can start with stuff about the Tesseract and scientists from Operation Paperclip. Pierce said SHIELD has had it for 70 years, I bet you anything that’s a lot of what they would have wanted those Nazi scientists for in the first place.”
“And I love you,” Steve replied. “Of course. I did punch a triceratops for you.”
They’d had a long, silent moment of distress when they’d looked ahead in their schedules and discovered it, and Steve had let out a sound not unlike a whine.
. Just make one last for a
“I love you,” he mumbles— can’t keep it in— and his heart bobs into his throat, because what if Steve… what if Steve doesn’t say it back?
When spring came, Tony would simply not bloom. The human would try, adding fertilizers and checking for beetles, but Tony had meant what he said. When he thought now of his petals, he remembered the softness of Steve’s stalks and the curl of his creepers, and the red that he favored seemed dull and lifeless when he compared it to the bright green of Steve wrapped around him.
“No, I knew. I just… need to talk to Steve. In private.”
Natasha didn't dare turn over and risk aggravating her wound, but she wanted so badly to drape herself on top of Steve and smother his wistful expression with kisses. She settled for kissing his fingers where they were twined in her hair.
It eats like it’s starved, as usual, and pays no mind to Tony stroking the fur down its back until it has licked the can clean. Then, belly full, it settles into Tony’s lap to doze off.
“I don’t know what that is.”
“I ain’t saying nothin’ about nothin’, and that’s that,” Logan grunted. “Oh look, a wall.”
Tony lets out a breath. “Thank god,” he mutters.
Eventually, her coffee mug stopped steaming, and then began to tilt dangerously in her hands. Steve put it on the side table and squeezed her shoulder until she hummed sleepily at him.
They landed in a part of the mall’s parking lot that had been cleared out by SHIELD, setting down next to an ambulance. Across from Steve in the Quinjet, Janet tapped on Bruce’s shoulder, alerting him to their landing.
“Hey, sleepyhead,” he says, and it comes out softer than he means it to. Steve shifts, slowly, and sits up in his seat.
Even now, hours later, Steve is passed out in the car, exhausted, for all that he’d insisted he would be fine until they at least made it to the motel they picked out in their schedule. Usually Tony wouldn’t miss Steve’s DJ-ing, which is almost entirely Disney songs and one-hit wonders, but—it’s past dark now, just a too-bright moon over an open highway, and, well…
“Change of plans,” Loki replied in Steve’s voice. “I just got a call from the Secretary. I’m gonna be running point on the scepter.”
“You heard the lady, JARVIS,” Stark said. “I need you to connect the dots between a metric ton of shawarma, all of us, and a delivery person in want of a several thousand dollar tip. Make sure there are vegetarian options for the conscientious objector here.”
Pepper dashes his hopes. “Tony, I can’t get a cat,” she sighs.
“Oh dear,” she said, smiling serenely. “It seems there was a little extra ambient static in the atmosphere.”
Tony lunges for him. “You have your inhaler?” he asks, and Steve fumbles for his bag, manages to grab his inhaler, and takes a slow puff from the spacer, his free hand shaking in Tony’s grasp.
What an idiot he’s been.
Logan eyed him silently. Bruce squinted at him, quickening his pace to catch up.
The helmet swiveled toward him. “Yep. Definitely.” Then back to the wall.
They stopped at the intersection of the paths, and Storm thought it over. “Are everybody’s comms online?”
The ring winks at him promisingly as he lights the torch, and Tony does his damn best to ignore it.
“You know I have a heart condition,” Tony said, his voice clear over the comms.
“We could have the Christmas dinner on another day,” Tony suggested, swiping through his calendar on a tablet. Steve, beside him, was flipping through a paper calendar.
“What?” Steve asks, frowning.
Tony, being a sucker for Steve laughing, and also Steve in general, had caved and taken the next exit, and they’d been having as much fun as two people could, staring up at the nostrils of dead U.S. presidents past, when Steve had caught a lungful of someone’s secondhand smoke and started coughing.
“I have reconsidered,“ Thor broke the silence. “In this realm it is important to make amends for the destruction you cause. I must help the people here repair their city, and it would be best to take respite nearby.”
“Mark that down as another right turn, Giant Girl,” Storm said, looking unruffled, but slightly singed. That fire pit had been nasty, and Storm’s attempt to catch Janet with her wind had whipped up the flames.
They’d ended up on a detour of their detour, Steve insisting laughingly that they just had to see the 20-foot-tall statues of the heads of American presidents.
“Oh!” Tony says. “Oh. In my defense—“
“Nothing,” Tony says, and he is trying very hard not to snarl. “There’s nothing wrong. I blew off my meetings so I could sleep; I figured they were all pointless anyway. I was wrong, and also exactly as irresponsible as you’ve ever secretly thought I was. Will that be all, Miss Potts?”
“Hey, man,” Rhodey says warmly. “How are you?”
“We are kind of great,” Jan said. “Ororo’s hair is perfect.”
“Obviously you’re— you don’t have a cold or anything,” Steve says, inhaling shakily. “What I mean is, are you really sick, bad sick, and keeping it from me because you think—“
Tony snorts, and Steve cracks a smile despite himself. Tony hands him a little plastic cup filled with a bright red syrup. “Cough medicine,” he says briskly. “It’s cherry flavored,” he adds, and Steve takes it from him.
“I’m sorry,” he said softly. “Let me make it up to you?”
Steve jolted.
“Android babies are not as cute as Peter,” Steve says, closing his eyes. Tony’s heart thumps steadily under his ear.
“Well, yes, but--”
“Why are there so many blankets?”
She moved to press her hand against her bandages, groaning a little in her throat, and Steve lifted his head, immediately awake.
“No, Dan, we absolutely can
“You do not require further attention from your doctors?” Thor asked.
Tony balks. “The engineers can have a cat when they can manage basic rocket science,” he grouches. “No, we’ll ask around PR—they do the
Steve sat sheepishly. “I drew him a little while ago.”
“You’re a clematis,” Tony said. “You’re the best clematis I’ve ever seen.”
He smiled and ducked down to kiss Steve on the cheek. Steve turned to catch him on the lips, deepening the kiss.
Timestamps appeared in the bottom right corner of the footage, frozen on a shot of them all cornering Loki from the viewpoint of the elevator. Tony ducked out of the room again and returned with two more bowls of popcorn, handing one of them off to Natasha, who promptly stole a piece from Tony’s.
Steve bit back the urge to ask Pepper if she was sure again. He definitely didn't think Pepper was the sort to play mean tricks like that. “I just don't want to mess up what we have,” he said instead, hearing the weakness of the excuse in his voice. “I don't know what I would do if things went wrong and we couldn't be friends anymore, and… things tend to go wrong, for me.”
He smiled. “She was kind. Never turned away a sick neighbor or a scraped knee. Hell of a temper, sometimes,” he said, a little ruefully, thinking of the way her eyes would flash when something set her off. “She kept all my drawings in an old shoebox. She frowned at me every time I worried about money. Said it wasn't my problem.”
“Thank you for saving me,” Steve whispered.
“Kind of a bad thing,” Steve points out dryly. “I’m miserably sick.”
“Tiny,” Steve says shortly. “Sick, weak. Kind of pissed off.”
Steve is mostly drifting back to sleep at this point. He can’t help it? He’s got Tony half-sprawled over him and talking lowly into the pillow near Steve’s ear, and a warm thick cocoon of blankets all around them both. It’s so comfortable.
It’s burning him. It’s drowning him.
“We’ll take it from here, agent,” Storm said, placing a hand on the woman’s shoulder. “Anything else we need to know?”
“What stopped you?” Tony asked. Calmly. As if he’d hadn’t spent years having nightmares about this question and all its possible hellchild answers.
was the string he hung everything on? That I’d just up and throw myself into mortal danger at the opportune moment?
Tony stepped back.
He opens his eyes, stares down at the flowers. “That’s the one part that still gets me now,” he confesses. “I know things may never have worked out between us. By the end, there was too much hurt for it to matter, I think. But I wish I’d had the guts to tell him anyway. He deserved to know.”
His mouth was dry, he noted.
Therefore once the Asgardian survivors were settled on Earth under Heimdall’s stewardship, Thor, Loki and the Valkyrie would use the Tesseract to go to Nowhere and retrieve the Reality Stone for safekeeping. The Soul Stone had been lost millennia ago, and would hopefully stay that way.
“Does that mean days? Hours? Weeks?” He sounded annoyed again.
His friend paused, then shrugged. “Compared to what?” At Steve’s frown, he shook his head. “I’m fine, Stevie. Really. It’s just that one of the perks of being on the run was that I didn’t have to spend my days thinking about all the lives I took. Wondering about the families they left behind.”
“I can speak for Wakanda’s defenses,” T’Challa said. “But who will lead the second team in your absence, Stark?”
Finding their way home.
Before Steve's eyes, Tony’s face had drained of expression, slowly becoming something blank, remote. Unreachable. “So was I,” he said softly.
Warning: a character gets very low, check the tags if you haven't lately.
Then, with a shrug, he released his grip on the tycoon’s freshly broken arm and stepped aside; Ty fled the room without so much as a glance at Tony. For a long moment, there was nothing but silence, then Steve swung around, uncertainty in his eyes. “I don’t know, do you think he bought it?”
/ˌdɛvəˈsteɪʃn/
“Take your time, junior,” Tony said, enjoying the eye-rolling among the more seasoned reporters in the crowd.
Luckily his words had returned. “Thanks, but it’s okay,” Tony told her. “Might as well be useful.”
And it seemed Ty had been recording every second of their sessions. One screen showed Tony kissing Ty on the cheek, over and over. On another, he was rehearsing lines, frowning in concentration. But none of the videos showed Ty giving him orders, he noticed. If the other man appeared at all, it was only as a passive recipient to Tony’s compulsive efforts. As if
A long moment passed.
“Steve, Steve, Steve,” Tony was saying over and over, both of them sinking to the ground. Always his. Then the pain arrived, and Steve sucked in a breath, high on relief because the pain meant that he’d made it in time. Brown eyes. Beautiful. Safe. Angry.
“Did you know he was doing this?” Peter asked, his voice bright with emotion.
“I wasn’t asleep,” Tony insisted.
i planned this fic as one unit, sorta like a movie, and as i finished it i went back and neatened up the earlier chapters, so the whole thing might be worth a re-read now that it's over. i may come back in a week and tweak the final two chapters but for now i'm sick of looking at them, lol.
Tony nodded once, sharp. “And why didn’t you tell me?”
But behind him, Steve had cleared his throat. “Um, hi.” Tony swung around. Steve was gazing at him, somehow smiling despite everything. “I believe the phrase is, I volunteer as tribute,” the other man said softly, then frowned. “Or, is it tribble? I can’t remember.”
“I’m guessing it’s not for the bagels,” Tony said, initiating a deeper proximity scan. If Hope and Scott were present like they should be, they were currently undetectable to his sensors, which was kinda a
But Steve was already pulling back. “We should get going,” he murmured. Responsibility was a
Beside him, Clint cleared his throat. Steve frowned down at his tablet, trying to look preoccupied despite reading the same sentence over and over. The archer never had forgiven Stark for leaving his team-mates behind on the Raft, however brief a stay it had turned out to be. More damaging had been the year of parole that had followed, forcing Clint to stay estranged from his family or risk revealing their existence to Ross. Difficult as Stark could be, Steve thought the archer’s reaction was unfair. Maybe even petty. But despite Steve’s recurrent attempts to resolve the issue, Clint still leaped on any opportunity to vent his bitterness towards the billionaire; the meeting yesterday was just the latest example.
Steve tore his gaze away from Tony’s profile, just in time. The billionaire lowered his wrist and turned to him, his dark eyes sparkling. “Scooby Gang are on their way.”
“Sure. This is the one you just got on Titan, obviously,” Steve said, tapping the barely visible scar on his side. Then he bent in to kiss it. Tony held his breath, unexpectedly moved by the delicacy of the gesture. Steve’s fingers traced further along his body. “Those two are from New York. That’s from the first Sokovia strike.” Tony watched as Steve continued talking, the other man absorbed in reading Tony’s skin, calling up memories Tony himself had long forgotten, then kissing them back to silence.
for the great
Not so much the raccoon. “Listen, buddy, if you’re messin’ with us, I’m gonna take this entire ship by the pointy end and shove it so far up your-”
“Fuck,” Tony breathed, ignoring the oblivious amusement of his friends. Clearly, he was not going to solve this on his own. Too many variables. He would have to talk to Steve, and soon.
The hurt was a relic from another lifetime, a wound that belonged to another man’s past; none of it could matter anymore. Tony moved closer, wrapped his arms around Steve’s shoulders, laid his head against Steve’s, closed his eyes. “Easy, Cap,” he murmured. “I’m here now. And this time, we’ll get the job done. I promise.”
Horrors were becoming routine, out there. The roiling death tolls once basic medical necessities like insulin and antibiotics ran out. The growing food shortages despite all efforts. The despairing aggression of the lost and the grieving. Even with the threat of international war averted, doomsday cults had sprung up seemingly overnight, matched only in number by local outbreaks of regional violence; all were fueled by the festering malignancy of old and cultivated petty tensions. Many local TV channels were still broadcasting, publishing hourly lists of names from those desperate to make contact with their loved ones after the commercial internet collapsed. The larger satellite-dependent channels had struggled to stay on the air, hit badly by the rolling blackouts as understaffed power stations went under. With most of their remaining technical staff busy with the emergency efforts, the few national channels still on the air had opted to show popular feel-good movies interspersed with only the major necessary updates, instead of their previous endless churn of news coverage. There was too much misery to report, even for them.
They were over-prepared, he thought in sudden shock. Over-drawn with the knowledge of the impossible stakes in play, the unspeakable price of failure. Steve’s usual trick of an inspiring speech could only serve to wind them up further.
After some thought, Nebula announced she was taking the
And Steve was just sleeping.
The bed was cold beside him, he’d fallen asleep and Steve was
“Don’t bullshit me, Rogers,” Tony hissed, dangerous yet fragile. He had stepped close enough for Steve to feel his breath on his face, close enough that there was no one else left in the world, but impossibly far away. “Did you
He sank back on the sofa, still feeling warm and slouchy in the afternoon sunshine. He’d missed some paint under his nails, he noticed. With the hectic schedule around the new launch - providing Peter liked his appearance in Cap #50, providing he approved Spider-Man #01 tomorrow - Steve hadn’t picked up a paintbrush in weeks; certainly he hadn’t expected today to be the day, but Nat had insisted he grab a couple hours after lunch. In truth, Steve had been too busy daydreaming to accomplish much actual work. Mind floating on the thrill of his later plans, he’d let his body splash random bright colors onto a spare canvas, resulting in the exact kind of abstract nonsense he’d usually roll his eyes at and itch to paint over. But this one he thought might be a pleasant sort of nonsense. Who knows, he might even keep it.
The gates slowly swung open, Tony sneaking through before they fully opened, just as he had a hundred times before. As he never had before. All those other times he’d been alone. He knew the car’s treated glass would shield Steve’s presence from Ty’s security systems right up until they got out of the car, but as the gloomy exterior of the mansion came into view, Tony felt queasily certain that the house itself knew what he was up to. And that it disapproved.
Steve would be patient. He would listen, and he would comply.
There was another location visible through the circle.
Now that the
Tony was already on his feet. “I’ll go.”
Tony paused. “Huh. I was thinking it was a serum thing.”
Tony had missed another public alert while he was out, but thankfully this time the approaching spaceship was a friendly, sent by the very alive but currently absent Thor. The Valkyrie had informed them of Loki’s death, then explained how Thor had taken a detour but was soon expected to return. The new ship’s crew were a group known as the Guardians of the Galaxy, renowned heroes who had already once thwarted Thanos’ plans to obtain the Power Stone. They’d landed their ship in Wakanda and were ready to assist in the Mind Stone’s defense.
he thought, darkly jubilant. And with one smooth step he had slipped into Tiberius’ arms, was pressing apologies against his fiancé’s lips.
But Bruce glared right back. “Be grateful for that.”
“I really didn’t think we’d ever get here,” Steve murmured, his brow furrowed even as his fingers traced the shape of Tony’s eyes, his lips. “Even after Thanos, being your friend again… It felt like more than I deserved. I knew the real you would still hate me, so I figured it was hopeless.”
“Wow, you’re that bored?” Tony said, pulling a face.
, but after enough time - days? weeks? years? - there was not enough of him left to form memories of what he experienced. The absence was itself a gift, he supposed. Proved it could have been worse. And if sometimes he felt a deep cold nothing shift within him - an animal yawning in its sleep, thoughtlessly kicking the edges of his awareness - that was all the more reason not to look back.
In Wakanda, time slips past easily for the both of them. Bucky’s memories feel sharper when Steve is near, which helps him feel more stable. He also experiences at least one nightmare less per month for every goat they raise, a correlation about which Shuri teases him endlessly.
“Very well. I’ll take it from here,” the Soul Stone promised. She bent then, kissed their foreheads, stepped back into the pillar of blazing orange light, and the six lights shrank until they were no bigger than fireflies. One by one, they zipped back to the dulled gems inset in the Gauntlet. The blue spark took a brief detour to hover over the humming blue glow in Tony’s chest, and Steve could have sworn it gave a satisfied twinkling chirp before joining the others. A heartbeat later, the six gems were once more aglow.
“It would have been murder either way,” Tony said softly. Which was a truth that only time and distance had allowed him to admit. It had felt bad, back then, to lose; he knew now he would never have forgiven himself if he’d won. Barnes just nodded, as if he understood Tony’s regret.
“… called the Infinity Stones, the six best shinies that could, unlimited power, yada yada yada. We know. And we know Thanos got the Soul Stone here. What we want to know is how exactly he did that.”
Out of reflex, Tony flinched back; Steve slowly turned his head, narrowing his eyes on the tycoon’s face. “Be careful what you wish for, Stone,” Steve said, ice in his voice. “You may find my full attention uncomfortable.”
“I’m more of an Asimov guy,” Tony said.
His fevered words made no sense, but they were out of time, and Tony gripped Steve’s hand closer, his own voice cracking with fatigue. “Steve, sweetheart, you need to let the doctors help you, okay? I promise I’ll be right here with you, the whole time. I won’t leave.”
- Tony could pinpoint the exact moment when the super-soldier understood, could only watch as Steve Rogers’ heart broke. “
“Clint,” Natasha sighed.
Clinging to the thought, huddling into its meager comfort, he let himself sink again. The absence of hope was an agony so overwhelming that it negated his suffering, leading him into an almost pleasant numbness. He wondered if this was the same peace that would let a soldier die with a smile. The end he’d denied to Steve.
Steve wanted to lie. He wanted to run. He wished he could be anywhere but here, could watch any heart break but this one. Yet Tony had held on to his control long enough to ask the question. He deserved for Steve to meet him halfway with the answer. Deserved the truth, whatever it cost.
“Eh, not much,” Rhodey said, suppressing a grin. “Steve was just telling us all how he’s been in love with you for years without anyone knowing, including himself.”
“Easy, Doc,” Tony drawled, eyes narrowed in warning. “You’re not in trouble. But Steve’s the only patient you need to worry about today.”
“Would that I could, pal,” the former assassin said, “but unlike Steve I’ve never had an eye for the fellas.”
Still, when Sam notices his wedding ring and gently prompts Steve to tell him about his wife, Steve is tempted to answer, if only to correct him.  Yet he knows the full story would take a long, long time and Steve is already aching to return to his real life, to the husband who is even now waiting for him to come home.
you talk to me so rudely, showing me no fucking respect, I am your fiancé and you will not speak to me like that-”
Tony’s stomach lurched. So many changes to explain. “Tell Thor to park on the lawn,” he said. “Might as well, since he ruined it last time.”
The Ancient One shakes her head. “
Steve moved to cover him, his bulk pinning Tony in place. “Well, I got a pretty big mouth,” he murmured, but even in the face of such corniness Tony had nothing left to say because all blood was now south of the border and he couldn’t think in words, what were words, how words? And Steve was kissing him deep, slowly, possessively, as if he already knew that Tony was all his, he’d gotten the keys and was just enjoying the view before the moving van showed up to make it official-
He’s in a coma for three months, and Steve never leaves his side.
“You check in with us, ask us about our problems,” Sam said, “but you won’t breathe a word about your own. It’s all negativity in, positivity out.”
Thankfully, Clint spotted Steve’s dilemma and immediately stood, announcing his need to do a pre-dawn snack run and dragging a grumbling Bruce away with him. Bucky took his place on the floor, briefly gripping Steve’s offered hand then wrapping his arm around Steve’s leg in mute relief. Wielding her usual discretion, Nat pointed Thor to Bruce’s vacated spot on the other couch and struck up a loud conversation with him, Rhodey and Sam. Her cover freed Steve to give Bucky the full attention he deserved, their reunion two years delayed by the strict terms of Steve's parole.
Barnes shook his head. “Sam just took him to grab a bite, but he’ll be back soon.” He paused, then pushed the door wider. Took a step back. “You can wait if you want.”
It was the purest, most savage fight of his life.
?” Wilson sounded outraged. Even Peter was staring at him, looking appalled.
“You…” Steve ducked his head, licked his lips, hazy with joy. Then his eyes latched onto Tony’s, and his voice wasn’t hazy at all. “Say it,” he demanded. Commanded.
Luckily Tony suffered from no such awkwardness, holding out his hand; Steve took it instantly, his heart humming at the contact, and he followed happily as Tony led him over to the table.
Tony found there were tears in his eyes. “Mine too.” And that was saying a lot.
A voice from behind. “Steve? What the hell happened?” He turns, his laughter turning to something else, something like sobs. Bucky. It’s done. It’s worked. And somehow, they’d survived. Had made it home.
had left Steve shuddering. Luckily he wasn’t the only one; in the end everyone had agreed that it was better to let go. Better to forget.
The old ugly hurt stirred within him, but this was not the time. “I never questioned that.”
, heated Tony from within, until he felt himself melt into a puddle of mindless anticipation.
“How do you bear it?” he asks her, breathless. “Having so much power and not using it?”
cockpit, and Steve thought once more how very odd it was that this alien place could look so much like home.
Steve’s failures as a leader had been absolute, and he would own his share of the responsibility for everything up to Siberia. On his return to New York he had promised himself he would do better by his team-mates. He would
not friends anymore.”
“Of course not,” Steve said, aghast. Everything was coming out all wrong. “No, Tony, that’s not what I- I thought if I could find Bucky first, I could find out the truth. Of course I would have told you once I knew for sure. I just didn’t want to tell you something so awful without confirming it first.” He clenched his teeth in frustration. His reasons had felt so solid at the time, but now, hearing them out loud, they sounded… weak. He mustn’t be explaining them right.
until his body succumbed to the inevitable trajectory and ignited the ecstatic supernova within, Tony tearing the air with his cries. Seconds later, Steve followed Tony over the edge, ragged voice naming him, hot pulsing jets filling him. It was not enough. It was too much. It was everything.
“The universe can suck it,” Tony said curtly. “My priority is you.” He swallowed, weirdly nervous. “It’s always gonna be you, Steve. So. Get used to it.”
The other man paused, his face hidden in Tony’s hair. “Uh… when did we meet?”
“You had us worried there, Tony,” Bruce says quietly. “But you’re gonna be okay. Just rest.”
“Oh no, no,” Thor said hastily, “different threat entirely, mostly my sister actually, uh, it’s a long story. Um. Banner wishes to speak now.”
“Actually,” Rogers says, “I’m early.” Then he tosses Loki’s scepter to a surprised Thor and looks around the table, his blue eyes dark with unspoken emotion.
In truth, Steve barely noticed the silence. He already knew it was over; he was
White, then green, and ringing in his ears, and Steve is staggering sideways, his body and mind briefly at a loss, then slamming back into alignment with sudden clarity. He knows where he is, when he is, but still he raises his hand to his chin, feels the beard on his fingers, feels the stabbing pain of cracked ribs in his side; he laughs out loud at the gift.
It takes a short time for Steve to explain who he is, much longer for them to start believing him. Showing off the nano suit finally tips them over the edge, judging by their stunned expressions. Yet through all their questions and challenges, all he can really feel is Tony’s gaze on his face, all he can think is
Tony should have felt relief. He should have been glad. “Okay,” he said instead.
Contrary to popular opinion, even among his friends, Tony Stark knew all too well that he had a heart.
He could hear Steve screaming from outside the lab so Tony already knew it was bad, but seeing him was infinitely worse. The super-soldier had already installed three Stones on the Gauntlet and was now slumped to the floor, writhing in agony as their pulses of light twisted under his skin; orange, blue and red. As Tony arrived, the others were just inside the door, trying to reach Steve, but not even Thor could break through the whirling aura of energy that surrounded him. As they watched, helpless, the super-soldier clamped his jaw and began struggling to his feet as if to continue.
Steve’s hands greedily explored Tony’s body, found his ass, squeezed; the other man lifted him easily -
This time, Asgard is prepared for the attack, and their enemies are soon vanquished. After, Steve tries to tell this Thor and Jane everything useful he can think of before he returns the Aether. They beg him to stay for the feast, as Asgard’s guest of honor; Steve agrees, but first, he asks for some paper.
But it was Barnes who answered; that successfully snapped Tony out of his trance. “Uh…” he said.
“You use humor to buy yourself time,” Thanos observed. He grinned. “Funny, since time is also what
Peter closed the door and sat shyly on the floor beside him. “Sorry if you wanted to be alone, but Aunt May said the Captain is really sick,” he said words spilling out all in a rush. “She said he’s comfortable, but they all look so sad. It’s… it’s bad, right?”
In his tiredness, Peter’s exhilarated babbling still felt like a slap on the ears. “OhmigodTony didyouseethis Ican’tbelieveit thisissocool-”
Steve didn’t know how to do, well,
“If what’s too late, sweetheart?” Tony asked; he knew but he needed to verify because that was the game now, but god, this wasn’t a game, this was Steve, this was
Events moved quickly after that. While Peter went to find his aunt and the three doctors, Tony reached Strange, who opened a portal so the whole team could confer. Tony had just brought them up to speed on Steve’s condition when Peter and Steve’s medical team returned.
Steve only sometimes thinks of the cabin.
Rhodey shook his head. “See, he got exposed and you didn’t. So you gotta level it out, man. Tell him how you feel.”
better. Once the terms of his parole had been finalized, the team had voted to put Steve back in charge, giving him a chance to truly prove himself.
Tony shot him an amused glance, a cover as they both shifted towards defensive stances. “Damn wizards, never sharing the shortcuts.”
May steered Tony towards the bedside chair, then draped a soft blanket over him before leaving with Doctor Palmer, the two women talking calmly as they walked away. Of course, May worked here, they knew each other. Tony huddled deeper into the blanket. The shaking was back, but he was unable to stop staring. At Steve. Not-Steve.
. Tony made sure to place his left hand into the Gauntlet before he took out the right; he didn’t know the exact user protocols for magic gloves but there was no way he was downloading the full installation package for a second time.
“Two-way?” Rocket asked.
- but eventually he remembered to check their location on his wrist device. Navigating was so much easier from a hundred feet up. Once they were heading in the right direction, the two men were free to chat and wander slowly through the gentle meadows towards the hills beyond. Soon enough, the ground began to rise steeply and their steps fell into an easy quiet rhythm.
“I called earlier but he didn’t pick up, can you tell him I’ll say thanks properly when I see him tomorrow?” Peter asked.
Sometime in the early morning, Steve opened his eyes to find himself fully awake. The monstrous pain from his dreams had been reduced to a crushing ache simmering below the surface, the rest of him floating free somewhere far above. He heard himself groan.
“I am,” Steve said, then he sighed again. “I will be. We will be. I hope. There’s just some stuff we need to… It’s complicated.”
Steve pauses. Tony is silent. He wonders if it feels weird, hearing Steve say goodbye to someone he will never be.
A brief smile touched Tony’s lips, but his eyes grew serious. “Don’t,” he whispered. “You don’t need to do that, Steve.”
“We’ll give you a minute,” Tony heard May murmur, then the others left so it was just him and Steve. There was no one else left in the world but him and Steve, eyes locked, hearts racing.
Thanos was dead.
“Miss Potts,” he said.
But if Steve also liked men, why would Tony’s idiotic chattering bother him? And why would he choose to hide this part of himself now, here in a more tolerant century, among people that would clearly support him? The only answer that made sense to Tony is that, yet again, he had overestimated how close Steve had ever felt to the team. To Tony.
Nat burst out laughing. “God no, Steve. I’m just your babysitter, not your priest.”
He drew a sharp breath. “Delete message.” Just like the rest.
“I have spent my life in the pursuit of horrors only because I thought it necessary,” the Mad Titan said heavily. “I truly believed there was no other way. Yet your visions have brought me to doubt this conclusion. Thus I find my resolve shattered.” Thanos shook his head, still studying the ground. “I thought it was strength that granted me the will for victory. But I must wonder instead if this is a weakness, the way my mind seeks even now to defend my former arguments, to applaud intent above consequence. Despite knowing the pointless ruin my actions have wrought, this weakness places an easy peace within my reach. Even now, I believe I could bear the cost of this failure, could forgive myself and live a life without regret for any of my past choices.” He paused, sighed. “All save for one.”
The raccoon tossed him a lazy salute. “Aye aye, Captain.”
Tony wrenched his gaze away, pulse racing.
The view was as spectacular from the ground as Tony had predicted, but he was by now super extra hungry and so he left Steve to his staring and sneakily resumed custody of the supply bag abandoned by the super-soldier’s feet. It took a good ten minutes for the super-soldier to return to reality, and by then Tony was sitting on a blanket, a full picnic on display.
Realization punched right through Steve’s happiness. Only once, had Tony returned to the Compound in those first six months. “I… I remember. We fought.” In fact, Steve’s stupid heart had leapt to see the man, despite their mutual betrayal, and he’d had to force himself to stay aloof by taking refuge in his leadership role.
. He’d tried for a casual tone but his voice had shook so he just sounded weak and scared instead. Tony sat up, again checking for witnesses, but it was still just the two of them in the small room.
Tony was mystified. “Uh, why? I feel fine.” Five hours’ sleep was more than he was usually allowed. In fact, he felt pretty good.
Pepper, anyway?” He looked around as if she’d been hiding in the walls.
In September Steve is still doing fine, is doing
With a soft moan, Tony collapsed back into his chair, hands covering his face. Seeing his distress, Steve had to blink away bitter tears. All he’d wanted was to protect Tony, now he’d only hurt him more.
“I’ll rally the troops!” the Queen volunteered, and with a giant grin she bounced out the door, her escort following. Her ebullience more than anything reminded Steve that despite her dazzling mind and confident attitude, Shuri was still a kid, and one placed in an impossibly stressful position. Of course she would welcome any plan that promised a quicker reunion with her lost family. But whether or not attacking Titan was itself a good plan, Steve had no idea. They were all flying dark here, but none more so than Tony, who by now had turned his back to them all in a way Steve very much disliked.
“Does anybody know, Tony?” Steve asked, when he could breathe again. “Do you have someone you can talk to-” Tony shook his head, once, still with his back turned, and Steve ached with the misery etched into his every line. “Then can you talk to me?” he whispered. “Please?” Steve held his breath, numb with hope.
“More like childhood sweethearts,” Tiberius said with a great booming laugh. His grip on Tony’s shoulders tightened, squeezing him closer. “Sadly, my family moved to Europe and we fell out of touch. Then a couple years ago, I walk into a bar in Hawaii and there’s my Anthony, gazing up at me like no time had passed. We’ve been inseparable ever since.” Recognizing the cue, Tony glanced up through his eyelashes and smiled shyly. Tiberius smirked back and touched his cheek, just the correct amount of tenderness in his gaze.
“Fuck,” Tony announced, because what else was there to say, and he leaned in to crush the other man’s mouth against his own, Steve holding him close as if he would never let go. After that first surge, the kiss softened into something unhurried, slow and sweet; when they eventually broke apart, it was more out of the need to look at each other than to catch their breath.
There were rules.
a deeper part of him whispered, tiny but defiant.
Tony Stark, trained Avenger, nearly fell off his chair. “Uh?”
Dazed, Steve pressed the mask back over his face, taking a quick breath of stale air. “Okay,” he said. “Okay, Tony. I believe you.”
In answer, Shuri smirked. “Don’t be silly. I’m amazing. You’re done here.” Magnificent, cheeky girl. Uh, Queen.
Tony ignored her. He watched the call ring through and end, watched Happy’s name drop from his screen.
“No, sorry, I’m fine, it’s fine,” Steve said quickly. “I just… I fell asleep, and…”
Steadied, he slipped into a sleep free of dreams.
All he had to do was stay far away from Stark.
Back on Titan, Nebula had run scans on him but had refused to share the results; Tony was suddenly glad. “So, I… can’t get up yet?” he asked.
Instead, he felt himself float gently until the ground was under his feet. Tony opened his eyes, confused, saw he was in a large, deep, blackened crater full of debris. Instead of a sky above, there was a dome of familiar-looking energy, colors whirling in queasy turmoil. His suit was intact, but more importantly, Steve lay before him, serene as if sleeping. Tony dismissed his visor and rushed to the super-soldier’s side, noting how Steve wasn’t actually holding the Power Stone like he’d thought; instead it was lodged like a parasite on the super-soldier’s left palm, trails of purple destruction advancing towards Steve’s heart. Tony checked for a pulse with fumbling hands, but Steve opened his eyes at his touch.
Not yet, he figured. Not today. They had climbed in all around him and would refuse to let him go.
“It appears your affection for Stark has grown much deeper since my departure, Steve Rogers,” Thor observed. “The heat of shared adversity may well forge great passion from friendship’s ore, yet I am told you and Stark were most grievously estranged these past two years. In truth, I am having difficulty reconciling these observations.”
“I’ll be fine,” Bucky said. “Right now you’ve got bigger things than me to put back together.”
“Who, me or the raccoon?” Steve teased, and Tony was so giddy with relief that he actually laughed.
“Captain Rogers, you need to keep the mask on-”
. He’d never thought of Tony like that, or any man. Admittedly, he’d rarely thought of women like that either before he’d met Peggy, but he’d been friends with Tony for
, in Steve’s life had prepared him for the revelation of Tony’s hand on his cock. He groaned helplessly, the pleasure spinning towards unbearable. Tony kissed his cheek, then leaned back, watching his face. Steve could only stare up at him, panting slightly as Tony’s fingers trailed his length, root to tip; he sobbed a curse, launched beyond all dignity, as Tony’s thumb brushed over the head. Tony made a pleased humming sound, then leaned in to suck hard at Steve’s neck, one hand tangled in his hair, the other working his cock in quick, inexorable rhythm.
“Fuck,” he heard Tony murmur, then strong arms were wrapping around his shuddering shoulders. Steve sank into the comfort of Tony’s embrace, still gasping for breath. “Easy, Steve, easy,” Tony kept saying. Soothing him.
The serum. It felt a week ago. Steve reached out and swatted him gently on the nose. “Nuh-uh. Bad Tony.” The billionaire looked scandalized, but Steve was already halfway out the door. All these weeks, he’d felt the growing sense that there was something urgent he was missing within the strange soothing peace they had established; that the future lay coiled in some vast unfathomable wave towering above him and Steve could do nothing but wait for it to fall; now, it seemed, the time of waiting may be over. If it truly was time to act, well, action was always what Steve did best. If there could only be one path to saving the world, he knew in his heart that Tony would find it now.
“Okay, so here’s the rules,” Dr Palmer announced, producing an extra pair of gloves for Steve. “Hand contact only. The second you touch anything else but the air, you exit and re-sterilize. Your suit isn’t fully airtight, so you still need to keep your distance. And again, if you need to sneeze, get the hell out of the room first.”
“Ah yes, the one perk of misery,” the other man drawled, but then his smirk softened into a real smile. “You look happy.”
was kneeling and pulling Tony tight against his chest, strong and warm and
“What about you?” Steve asked eagerly. Too eager, he could hear it.
Rhodey hesitated still. “You should know, Tony… Barnes was here.”
“What? That’s not- Tony, I’ve
“Spider-Man,” Tony said.
Instead, Tony staggers back a step, catching himself against the nearby chair.
“Why now?” Tony asked eventually.
“Are you injured?” she asked.
It turned out Tony was right about the magic. The Doctor was literally a wizard, which turned out to be both a thing and a thing Earth had secretly depended on for centuries to avert total apocalyptic catastrophe, which was just great news. He also claimed to be the cult-appointed guardian of the Time Stone. Since Thor had brought the Space Stone and Vision held the Mind Stone, that meant three of the most powerful cosmic forces in the universe were now gathered in a room that smelled of nervous armpit.
Arms, around him. Steadying him. Steve. “Together, then,” he heard.
Slowly, the waiting room had been filled to capacity with the exhausted bodies of Earth’s defenders, hearts heavy despite the great victory. Tony saw their grief and hated them for it, closing his eyes against their tears. In turn, he felt the others shrink away from him, their silence speaking volumes. It just wasn’t
The former assassin chuckled, looking more relaxed than Tony could have imagined. “Well, you know, sufficiently advanced technology…”
“Really, you should be honored,” Ty continued. “So many years of planning, so much thankless effort, but look. I’ve made you a star.”
Steve had no physical trouble carrying the smaller man, but he admitted it may have been a tactical mistake when Tony’s tongue made him stumble twice before even reaching the stairs. Halfway up, Steve had to drop him thanks to a particularly effective use of teeth. By the time they reached the bedroom, Steve had lost his shirt and both socks, while Tony had been stripped down to only an undershirt and, to Steve’s glee, neon purple Hulk boxers.
off key,” Steve said, and the man dissolved into a giggle fit so strong he dropped his pencil. Wretched… old wretch of a wretch. Tony tried to pretend he was offended but even he couldn’t keep a straight face.
Every second until then, Tony would watch over him, because that would keep Steve safe. The plan echoed round and round in his aching head, bringing him comfort, bringing him pain.
“Did you at least save the chicken?” Tony asked, trying to keep a straight face.
“I would like to apologize for my former pursuit,” T’Challa said, taking a careful step towards Bucky. “I indulged in a need for revenge to escape my grief, and it almost cost an innocent life. I am truly sorry.”
Now answer the riddle
Steve squeezed his waist. “I think I might die of shame if someone else sees this. Why– we keep everything else clean, how did we let this get so bad?”
Steve smooths the covers back on his side of the bed, staring a bit forlornly at Tony’s side. He knows it’s silly— Tony is busy— but, well, Steve likes waking up next to Tony. He’s made it a personal goal to wake up beside Tony as often as he can, because missing it— missing Tony in the mornings always sends everything a little out of sync.
Tony opens his mouth. “Steve,” he says. “Steve. I’m really sick, baby.”
“Alright,” Steve allows, and turns that fond grin on Tony. “Did you have a name picked out when you brought her here?”
“I don’t need some sucker getting all tangled around me,” Tony snapped.
“Why not?” Steve asks, agreeable. “It’s not like we don’t have the space.”
No one could ever say Tasha Stark wasn't bold. In dress, in philosophy, in person. She was colorful, and bold, and bright, and asking her to dance was impossible.
“I'll grab your pain meds,” he said, dipping his head to kiss her cheek. Cranky, Tasha dropped her arm back into the blankets and pulled Steve’s pillow over her face. It smelled like him, his appallingly cheap bar soap.
