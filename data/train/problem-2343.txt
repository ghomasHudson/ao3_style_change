He gets to the awning of Speedy’s when he finds out his quiet night of takeaway and sadly wanking in Sherlock’s bed will have to be delayed. Instead he feels his appetite slip away and his body crumble in guilt as he looks ahead and spots Mindy waiting for him on his doorstep. She’s staring at her shoes, a large manila envelope held in her hands. She’s seemingly deep in thought but as though sensing John’s presence she looks up and their eyes lock.
“Sherlock… Please… Oh god!” John was actually speaking aloud now, moaning and sweating and writhing and panting. This was the first time he’d gotten off in months and fuck if he wasn’t basking in it.
John also hadn’t realized until he went to clean that he hadn’t so much as washed a dish in the past few months. He briefly wondered how anything had gotten done at all in the flat in that time-span before the answer flashed clearly in his mind. Mrs. Hudson must’ve done it. Obvious, really. For all her moaning and groaning over being called a house keeper, she never hesitated to help him or Sherlock with the tidying or occasional meal before. John had been largely absent in the past few months, not paying much attention to his surroundings or the people in them but even then he knew that his landlady was worried over him. She knew better than anyone what he felt like. She had loved Sherlock much like a son after all.
“Yeah, you have a point. Parties were definitely not his scene.” Greg pauses a moment and then erupts in completely inappropriate giggles until his face is red. “Did I ever tell you about the time Gregson dragged him to NSY’s Holiday party?” John shakes his head, already smiling maniacally from the contagiousness of Greg’s laughter. “Oh Christ, I have too! So Gregson dragged him in round the middle of the party, I have no idea how she ran into him but she somehow coaxes him to come in a while, which was challenge enough. God, back then he was like a skittish cat, but anyway she not only drags him in but he’s got these huge fluffy antlers on his head and a big red –“
He did this sometimes. Just sat and stared and contemplated. His hand itched to pick up the heavy hunk of metal and point it towards himself, to end it, to just put an end to all of this.
He went straight up the steps to the flat and didn’t stop until he reached his chair and plopped down with a soft
“I - I understand where you’re coming from, John. And I’ll admit that I may have not had any control in all of us being brought there or… much of what happened during, but it still isn’t logical that you or Lestrade should have had to go through any of the punishments made up for me.” John shrugs.
John felt his lips curl up, the closest he’d come to a smile in ages. He could practically hear Sherlock whining on.
Mindy doesn’t put up a fight. Just nods and walks to the door. She drops the envelope on the couch on her way out but John won’t notice until at least two days from now, when he’s finally woken up from his drunken stupor. He doesn't notice her walking out the door either and he most definitely doesn’t notice her last, soft apology she gives him before she walks away. Out of John’s life, likely forever. Just like everyone else before her.
“I believe that’s about all I have to share with you at this point in time, though I will be sure to let you know if anything new comes up.”
“Not for a while. Like I said you have third degree burns, which you’d need to be hospitalized for anyways. Plus you just had surgery and need a shit-ton of recovery time. They’ll want to monitor your food intake and make sure you’re getting enough calories to fight off any infections or diseases. It’ll take a bit.” That was definitely not the answer he wanted to hear.
He text’s Mindy, a simple message inviting her to dinner and drinks on him. Her answer comes quick, and it doesn’t take five minutes before the two of them have chosen a restaurant and time to meet up. Johns puts down the phone and grins. Everything always seemed so simple with Mindy. No fussing or twiddling around and John appreciated that.
These were all the thoughts he had been desperately trying to avoid since he had awoken and he felt a burning resentment towards the doctor for making him think about it all. For making him realize how repulsive he really was. He felt sick.
Sherlock lifted his head up and checked up on how the others were doing. Anderson was back to looking a bit woozy although not as bad as when the snipers were aiming at him, Sally still looked well held together although there was a flash of what looked like guilt pass through her face as her and Sherlock made eye contact, Lestrade had his fists tightly clenched and seemed to be barely holding himself together and John hurt to look at the most. His eyes looked to be filling up with tears that he was desperately trying to keep at bay and he was no longer thrashing around just making pained noises of protest. The blonde man was staring at the brunette pleadingly, although Sherlock wasn’t quite sure why and he couldn’t hold his stare long enough to figure it out before he heard another snap of fingers and was forced to give his attention back to Moriarty. The shorter man was now back to brandishing the knife and was biting his lip with glee.
The torch was flicked on with a rush of gas and flame and flickered menacingly as it was passed to Sherlock. He couldn’t burn his hands, they were far too valuable and necessary, but if not them then what…
approval of her looks. Sherlock had been understandably taken aback and was much quieter after that, as though hesitant to step on any other hidden landmines. That hesitance alone was out of character enough for the usually sharp-tongued detective and it showed John how much Sherlock really was trying.
heart out. Greg was nothing but a pawn to Moriarty. If it weren’t for the fact that him and Sherlock were friends Greg wouldn’t have even been sitting in that chair. In the end, it was Moriarty’s obsession with him and him alone that led to everyone else being put in danger.
“Yeah, well busy or no give me a call every once in a bit, will you? Or at the very least shoot off a text. Just to save me some piece of mind.” John felt an inkling of guilt well up in his stomach. He truthfully hadn’t meant to worry Lestrade. No matter how sore he still was over Lestrade’s role in Sherlock’s… final day, he knew the DI was heart broken over what had happened. Both of them had lost a friend that day and he also knew they were both having trouble dealing with it, in their own ways.
“Ouch. You got me there! What smarty you are. I’m so glad the MET is recruiting people with your outstanding intelligence Ms. Donovan. Now if all you little pets are done barking and whinging I’d truly love to carry on.”
“Oh my…” She trails off looking at her own finished ice cream. “How… How did he…” She trails off not quite sure how to ask what she’s asking. Perhaps she doesn't feel it’s appropriate. John almost laughs remembering how Sherlock used to approach loved ones of murder victims. If he ever found out you knew someone who had died recently he would interrogate the life out of you regardless of your comfort levels.
It had all been a false alarm anyway. Sherlock hadn’t been shot, he’d just been bored, though if you told that comparison to the man himself John was sure he would argue vehemently that both things were practically the same. In fact being bored would probably be far worse.
“Delivery for Mr. Sherlock Holmes!” She announces cheerily sitting it down on the bedside cabinet. She stands back from it and let’s out a low whistle. “My my! I wish I had someone who cared about me enough to send such a stunning thing. My boyfriend probably wouldn’t even think to bring me a leaf.” She let’s out a soft chuckle before turning to Sherlock and winking. “Someone sure must love you.” At this point she turns around and flutters out of the room. John straightens up from where he’s been standing next to the window on the other side of the room and walks over so he’s standing beside Sherlock’s bed and staring at the bouquet. His face is filled with irritation and he’s looking at the great big thing with suspicion.
Somehow on the way there the cabbie had managed to hit every single red light possible. John was a complete ball of anxiety and irritation by the time they arrived at the Greek place and he tossed the money none-too-gently in the mans direction before bursting out the car and near diving into the restaurant. The hostess greeted him at the door, a pretty young woman with black hair and red lipstick and asked him if he had a reservation. He told her he was just meeting someone, his eyes never once glancing at her, too busy trying to find Mindy in the crowd of seated patrons. Just as the hostess was asking who’s name the reservation was under and John realized he had no clue what Mindy’s last name was he spotted her at a lonely table near the back and waved. In less then a minute she had found her way to him and was explaining it to the hostess who said someone would be with them in a moment to take their orders.
He looked around for the nearest thing he could use to clean his hand and his eyes land on Sherlock’s white button up shirt resting snuggly next to his leg. He hesitated for a moment but the continued blaring ringtone of his phone helped him to make the decision quicker. Wiping himself off on the white button down he reaches over with his other hand and snags his angry mobile.
“You are…” He paused trying to find the right words and the strength to give them voice. “You are important John.”
“Can’t I just do the recovery and eating at home? I live with a doctor for crying out loud!” His eyes widened once he realized what he’d said.
He flopped down onto his bed dribbling some of his drink onto the sheets but he couldn’t bring himself to care. He couldn’t bring himself to care about anything at all as he closed his eyes and allowed sleep to take him, not even the gaping hole in his chest.
God, he was such a clog. How many times had he vehemently denied him and Sherlock being anything more than mates? It was so embarrassing now. He must have looked like a right prick. He
A pause. Sherlock’s arms around him, pulling him close. Their bodies are now completely pressed together. John can feel everything. He’s just realized they must both be naked because he can feel Sherlocks skin all over his own. It feels amazing. Sherlock’s body feels like it was made to be against his own. It’s hot and solid and John wants to taste it.
John would be naked save for a blind fold and Sherlock would be off to the side staring at him, observing like he always does. He would look at John and deduce his wildest fantasies. His darkest desires. If anyone would ever have been able to see that in John, it would have been Sherlock. He’d stand there watching John slowly stroke himself,
“I’m so sorry. I—well. I lost track of time.” He figured that saying he fell asleep on his dead best friends bed while he was in a state of extreme ennui because he’d had a row with his therapist may have made a bad impression.
“Sherlock? What’s wrong?” Sherlock doesn’t answer him and just hands the card over silently. He watches as John reads it over and his confusion and hostility quickly turns to fury. After he’s gone through it all he stares at the card as if it had just kicked his mother. Sherlock silently agrees and feels somewhat the same.
“Have you thought about moving out of Baker Street?” The mood between them is making both of them unusually direct and John needs another beer because of it.
“So the wife brings her daughter out to the living room and he asks to speak to her alone. So the mom gives us some space, close enough to be safe but far enough to give a sense of privacy, you know? And the first thing he asks the little girl?” Greg’s voice sound high with disbelief, as if he’s still having a hard time believing it.
“Stop being so naïve, John,” Sherlock spat. “You can’t actually make anyone do anything. Especially me! Do you really think he could’ve made me do anything I really didn’t want to do?” Both of their tempers were rising now. Sherlock could see all John’s telltale signs of anger. Clenched jaw, his left fist clenching and unclenching, deep measured breaths, a puffed out chest. Sherlock welcomed every bit of it.
“I’m proud of my hideous jumpers, ta very much!” Just then when they’re both giggling and smiling at each other the waitress (an older woman with a frumpy figure and frazzled ginger hair) comes and says she’s there to take their order. John let’s Mindy order for them both with whatever she recommends and the waitress writes it down though she seems to be paying more attention to looking at John with amused curiosity. He suspects this woman may be one of the owners. Eventually, she leaves and the date continues on much as it had started. It’s pleasant and they laugh a lot. There are a few awkward moments but those go by quickly and often just lead to more joking. He learns that Mindy was born in India, though her parents moved here while she was just a baby so she doesn’t remember it. She’s currently going to Manchester University to study chemical engineering, which John finds surprising but fascinating. She’s the middle child with an older brother, an older sister and a younger brother. She has a sweet tooth and caramel is her favourite. She can’t stand raisins though. Really can’t stand them. Just the sight of them makes her nauseous.
and for the few moments it took for him to climb the seventeen stairs up to their flat he was sure he would be greeted with Sherlock’s bloody body when he opened the door.
“I’m so sorry, Sarah. I- well I…” He hesitates for a split second. He can't say he’s hung over. That would be incredibly bad for many reasons. One of which being that Sarah knew of the addiction in his family, not only Harry’s but his fathers and mothers as well. He had shared his family life with her when they were dating not really thinking of the ramifications it could have on his job. He should have. Sarah knew of his family’s addictive tendencies and she also knew as a doctor how addiction like that could be hereditary. If he shared the real reason he wasn’t in to work today she would immediately suspect alcoholism and there would go his stable job prospect. Nobody wanted to hire a veteran with PTSD and an alcohol addiction. Sarah may not care about the former but John has no illusions over how she’d feel about the latter.
“Stop.” His voice was low and wavered slightly. “You don’t know what he would want. You didn’t know him, no one did.”
His first thought was that Sherlock must have broken something while doing one of his experiments but that thought was instantly followed up by an achingly painful twinge in his chest.
All his problems would be irrelevant. Making amends to Sarah, groveling to Mindy, forgiving Greg, getting his life in a semi-presentable state. None of that would matter. It would just be over. No more worries, no more loss, no more grief. He briefly wonders if Heaven is real; and if it is would he and Sherlock meet there?
As he swallowed the medicine and water combo he entered the lounge and after a moment or two of silent wallowing he picked up his phone that was furiously blinking with unseen notifications. Three new text messages awaited him. Wasn’t he popular this morning?
He said he was ‘busy’ but John knew it was a lie. Sherlock just didn’t… fit in. He never blended well in group settings and John had always expected he had a touch of social anxiety – which sounded ridiculous. Sherlock spent his days questioning murderers and calling everyone around him a moron, how could he have social anxiety? And yet, whenever John would catch him in a social situation that had nothing to do with gruesome murders he would look so awkward and out of place and
It couldn’t be, because Sherlock had steel eyes. Blue and bright and luminous. The eyes staring back at him were nothing like that. They were brown and soft, with laugh lines around them, even though the man was clearly so young. John never knew he could be so disappointed by a persons eye colour.
John was in love with him, the bastard. John had been head over arse in love with Sherlock from day one.
He got a few other visitors as well. Molly, Mrs. Hudson (who brought Sherlock’s favourite cream puffs from Speedy’s and spent the whole time fawning over him which he would never admit he actually enjoyed) and Mycroft. His brother had only stopped by once on the second day he was in hospital to deliver some of his things and check on the progress of everything.
My God was he tired. He didn’t want to do anything today except lay in this chair and maybe have a drink. Come to think of it a drink sounded bloody fantastic right now. His eyes wandered over to the small clock on the mantel and felt a small self-deprecating chuckle sneak past his lips. Ten after three and he was already getting ready to drown himself in whiskey. Well, he supposed it was close enough to Happy Hour to not be a complete lush, and today did call for a bit of liquid help. He couldn’t shake a little itch in his mind that told him he was missing something though. By god, when wasn’t he missing something? It seemed like John was constantly just bumbling his way oblivious through his own life until someone else pointed the important bits out to him. No, this time he could damn well figure it out himself. What day was it? Monday, because he had his appointment with Ella. He didn’t usually have anything set on Mondays but… Oh. Right. He was meeting with Mindy at four. He didn’t want to go at all. Every particle in his body wanted to stay glued to this chair and cocoon the day away with bad telly and good scotch, but he knew he had too. He had promised and he didn’t want to actually hurt the girl. He may not be after anything serious with her but he didn’t want to be cruel either.
“Look who’s talking. Figures that the first thing to come out of your mouth would be an insult.” Sherlock felt the slight need to defend himself.
Sherlock had been the only one to treat John as the soldier he was instead of the cripple he appeared to be. The detective had no problem insulting him or recruiting him to fight crime. Sherlock had given him what no one else had been able to, or had even tried to do. He gave him a purpose. But now that was gone, because Sherlock was gone – still can’t say dead, he’s just gone, not dead – and John no longer knew what he was living for.
“So, we’ve got the mystery solved but now we have a thirteen year old girl about to go down for murdering her father. You know how Sherlock is. He always needs to be right about bloody everything. Always have the last word and all that. I think for sure he’s going to go right to Gregson and show off but instead he thanks the girl for being honest and gives her his number. Says she can call it if she needs too and not to tell anyone else what she told him. Then he walks right out of the house and drags me back to the Yard. We’re about to walk into Gregson’s office and he turns to me and tells me not to say anything, to just follow his lead. I don’t know why I listened to the bastard but for some reason I kept my mouth shut as he told Gregson he had made no progress in the case and didn’t think he’d be able to solve it. All of a sudden this bloody peacock of a man who can never seem to resist proving how superior and intelligent he is lies and pretends to be clueless.”
“I’m not a student at Manchester University. And I didn’t study engineering.” She says it all so matter-of-factly as if this is all normal. As if her admitting to lying about such a huge part of her identity isn’t a big deal. But John see’s her hands trembling around the envelope. He remembers first meeting her on the subway, how her trembling hands had been the thing that had made him soften toward her. It has the same effect now. At least he knows that was real.
His mind latches on to the scent of lemon gun powder and imagines all the other times these two scents have intertwined. What comes to mind is races through back alleys and mad dashes across roof tops. He thinks of a crisp white button down stretched tight over a pale heaving chest. Looking over at Sherlock and seeing how he had looked, that first night after Angelo’s. The man’s eyes had been bright, seemingly absorbing all the light in the room and bouncing it back right to John. His dark unruly hair had been more wild then ever, windblown and tangled. John had been desperate to brush through those tangles. Preferably with his fingers and his face pressed tight too Sherlocks.
“Yeah, fine. Ah-hem. Sorry about that. Just got kind of lost in thought.” He chuckled to try and lighten the mood but it sounded force and gravelly. She reached over and placed her small, soft hand over his.
“What could you possibly have to apologize for?” John understands how she’s feeling but he doesn’t get
True to his word, a non-descript black car pulled up outside of the hospital just as John was done signing all the papers for Sherlock’s early release and handed them over to the silently disapproving nurse. All they had to take home with them were two small bags of clothes and a few other belongings such as books which fit easily into the car and after John helped Sherlock into the back seat they took off for Baker Street a whole week earlier than planned. Sherlock felt like he was breathing easier for the first time since Moriarty had had him shoved into the back of a van.
“It’s not. It wouldn’t be any easier anywhere else though. I love London and I wouldn’t be able to afford any other flat in the middle of the city, not on what the clinic pays me. I just… I just miss him Greg.” Greg nodded into his drink.
“No… I’m uh, I’m good.” Oh god, now he’s mumbling. Could he get any more pathetic? “Little drugged up though,” he shrugged over at the I.V. in his arm rhythmically dripping the relaxing sedative into his body. He seemed to have suddenly acquired the wonderful ability to state the obvious. He wondered how John felt about him using morphine right now. He knew John didn’t exactly approve of his history of substance abuse. Would this be the last straw, he wondered. Would John tell him right here and now that he couldn’t take living with some junkie who got off on self-harm and giving sexual favours to his enemies?
“Thinks it makes him look cool. He got it as a present from an “influential government official” he quoted with sloppy air quotes, in his twenties. Or at least that’s what he says, but I never could understand why a high-ranking government worker would gift someone with an umbrella. He hasn’t let go of the thing since. He used to take it in the shower with him.” All three men shared a serious glance before bursting out into laughter. The thought of Mycroft Holmes bringing an umbrella into the shower was just enough to crack the remainder of their nerves and they couldn’t seem to stop giggling. It felt good. To finally laugh a bit with no awkwardness or tension or hidden guilt, though of course, nothing lasts forever and happiness is ever fleeting. No sooner did they catch their breath that the doctor walked in with the nurse from before and suddenly the somber mood of reality came back to them. The nurse walked over and handed Sherlock the cup of water with a smile before exiting the room again. The three men focused all their attention now on the doctor.
John opens his mouth to speak but really doesn’t know what to say, so instead of speaking he fills his mouth with the dregs of his beer and stares at the dirty bar top.
All at once Sherlock suddenly felt exhausted. This had been a highly physically and emotionally taxing day and he was finally starting to feel it’s full effects. His eyelids were starting to feel uncomfortably heavy and the cotton in his brain was coming back full force.
Thank you and I hope to get back to you very soon with a far better story then I originally set out with.
He wondered what he would feel in his last second after he pulled the trigger and sent the bullet flying into his brain.
If you are patient and willing to wait I recommend adding it to your ‘read later list’ although I understand if you’d rather just bypass this work. If you’ve chosen the former, thank you very much for your patience and I sincerely hope you enjoy the finished product, though I have no idea when it will be completed. If you’ve chosen the latter, I also thank you for at least taking the time to read this and I hope we will cross paths again in the future so you will be able to better enjoy my finished works.
His left hand twitched where it was nestled in Mindy’s near black hair, giving a sharp tug and making them both gasp. He used the new found leverage to drag Mindy’s face to his, smashing their lips together. If John wasn’t so smashed he thinks he’d be dead embarrassed over his roughness. He had never been particularly rough in bed, unless specifically asked to, but then again John hadn’t felt like himself lately.
“Hi.” Mindy said, her soft feminine voice entangling with a small giggle as she looked at John happily.
“This is my stop,” he told her. It was a lie. His stop was actually the next one but he didn’t think he could handle sitting with her and making small talk.
“Oh Goodie! I was so hoping you’d make this choice. I think two minutes should be plenty.” Sherlock nodded. His heart was racing and he was so woozy it felt as if his head would float away from his body completely.
“Well, please, do share,” he pushed out between puffs of breath, sarcasm as thick as he could manage. Moriarty had the full attention of everyone in the room now as they all waited anxiously for the new addition to the game.
“It’s fine really. I just got distracted by something. I’m glad we’re here.” He turned his hand upwards so it could gently wrap around hers and he smiled, much more convincingly this time. She seemed somewhat mollified by this answer and redirected her attention to the menu, telling him what all the best things were.
him, and why is she so insistent on him ‘moving on’ in the first place? It’s barely been two months since he watched his best friend
He supposed it made sense that his libido had chosen now to spike up again. The day before had been the first reprieve from the grief he had been drowning himself in ever since Sherlock’s death. It had felt like releasing a block in his mind while he was talking to Mindy about Sherlock yesterday. Like a latch had been released and floodgates had opened. Maybe one of those floodgates belonged to his libido. He had spent the day having lovely conversation with a lovely girl and it had felt good. That would make sense except his own awareness was rapidly coming back to him and it hadn’t been soft supple flesh and feminine touches in his alcohol induced dream. It had been hard lines and heat and
“John, don’t you see?” Sherlocks beginning to get irritated. Why can’t John understand? “I was the reason we were there in the first place.
I dropped this story for a while because I found myself losing the direction on it I had originally set out with. I am currently in the process of revising and editing it so it better reflects what I was trying to present the first time around.
too just notice it when he was still here? When I could have done something about it.” He laughed but it was low and bitter and made Ella shift in her chair. “Yeah, no thanks. Ta though. As much fun as it sounds to go over
He desperately wished he had known then what he knew now. Maybe if he had known how far the game with Moriarty would go he could’ve convinced Sherlock to be more careful.
“I think this is just what you need John. Someone new to take you out of your head. A distraction can be very helpful in times like these.”
Although he was fully enjoying this new sort of intimacy with John he was still growing increasingly restless in hospital. The bright lights and constant sound of movement and machinery and doctors and nurses barging in constantly were getting to him. He had taken to verbally attacking the nurses whenever they came to tend to them and aggressively deducing anything he could about the doctors lives, which would in turn make John snap at him for being rude and they would both retreat into a strop.
“Oh, please.” Mindy huffs looking ruffled just at the thought. “Like I said, my brother really was a big fan, he read all the papers and news articles. He would read them to the rest of us sometimes, he got so excited, so I’ve heard the stories. I don’t know much about detective work or what it takes to be a genius secret criminal but I heard the stories and the things he did and I don’t believe any one man would be able to fake all that.” She smiles slightly, remembering something. “Actually, now that I think on it, I remember reading your name in the news articles. Gosh you must think I’m so daft to not have put that one together!” He smiles a bit more, latching on to the slowly lightening mood.
“Sorry Mr. McDerphy, would you give me a moment? I need to discuss something with Dr. Watson.” She motions towards John but doesn’t take her eyes off the patient. He nods his agreement and just like that John is getting ushered out the door and into the small office a few steps down the hall.
Then there was John. John Watson. The Good Doctor and Loyal Soldier. John was also known for being rather forgiving as well. He had forgiven Sherlock a lot throughout their quickly started friendship. He only made a minor fuss at the body parts in the fridge, only occasionally got in a huff about Sherlock’s poor manners and nearly never threw a fit about Sherlock waking him up during the night with impromptu violin concerts anymore. Though again, these were only minor offences compared to Sherlock’s current glaring predicament. John was a good man and a loyal one to boot but every person has there limits. This could very well be John’s final breaking point and Sherlock was all too aware of that. But he could be fine with that. Sherlock had been alone plenty in his life before John had come along and though Post-John life was far preferable to Pre-John life, Sherlock could manage. It wouldn’t break him. He would be fine if John decided he had finally had enough. He desperately wished it were easier to lie to himself.
When they arrive at the clinic John doesn’t know if he’s relieved or more stressed then ever. The last thing he wants to do right now is face Sarah but he knows he has to. Choosing to just be brave and act like a man for once, John rushes out of the cab and into the clinic saying a rushed hello to the receptionists. They say hello back but he doesn’t miss the stink eyes they throw his way and he knows Sarah isn’t the only one he’s affected by being a no-show this morning. He vows to properly apologize to the receptionists later, likely through a peace offering of coffee and some of those cute cakes from the bakery down the street the women in the office are always talking about.
For a moment, he felt caught. Like a rangy teen caught wanking in his room by his mother. He felt his face flush and renewed shame fill him up so quick he forgot about his new found rule of not answering the phone and dove to the other side of the sofa to grab the blaring device. Though, just before he grabbed it he remembered just in time that his hand was currently coated in his quickly cooling cum.
By the time ten minutes was up he had five cuts on his left arm, some deep enough that they would require stitches, and four across his chest, the first one deeper than he had intended and the next three longer. He knew some would end up scarring and he seriously doubted that those were the only scars he was going to be getting through this ordeal. The pain was irritating but manageable. The thing that worried him more than the pain was the blood loss, he could already feel himself getting slightly woozy and he had no idea how long he would have to sit there and play the game. The last thing he needed was to pass out.
“Sherlock.” His voice was low, quiet. He was trying so hard to control his anger that his voice came out muted and shaky, starkly contrasting his bodies dangerous calmness. Angry-John always reminded Sherlock of the phrase ‘the calm before the storm’. “You didn’t want to do any of that! He put you in a position where it was the only option you had. I understand that, believe me, but there is no way you wanted to do any of those things!”
“Well, one day we’re working on a case, this guy got stabbed in his house. No sign of forced entry, no witnesses, the neighbors didn’t hear or see anything unusual. We thought it was the wife at first but she had a rock solid alibi. Well you know him, he figured it all out and rushed off somewhere to ‘confirm his theory’ as he put it. Gregson tells me to follow after him and he leads me back to the guys house. I had no idea what he was up too but wanted to be right beside him in case he pulled something. He knocks on the door and he asks the wife if he can speak to her daughter. I’m getting a bit suspicious now, I mean you know how nasty he could get, and he was even worse for putting his foot in his mouth back then and I was freaking out thinking about what he was going to say to his little girl. She was just a tiny thing, twelve or thirteen.”
On that less-than-optimistic note he fluttered his heavy eyelids open with a startling amount of effort and felt his face scrunch at the blinding brightness of the room. There was a large window letting in large streams of sunlight that seemed determined to burn Sherlocks retinas out of his skull. It was as if that small amount of pain had awakened his whole pain body and suddenly he could feel every wound on him. His arms and chest hurt from the long stitched up gashes adorning them. His fingers prickled with a sharp pinch. The worst however, were his upper arms and shoulders. He could feel the fried skin pinching and pulling. The skin still felt as if it were being slowly burned. Sherlock let out a sharp hiss at the sudden influx of sensation.
“Yeah.” John chuckles a bit at that, it comes out a tad flat but neither of them focus on it. “He wasn’t much a fan of it himself actually…” Before he knows it her hand has come back to rest on his. A gentle, comforting presence.
He spent so much time lecturing Sherlock on his horrible eating habits and now here he is doing the same thing.
For any of you who might be triggered by things of this nature, there is a part in this chapter where a character refers to an old case involving the sexual abuse of a child. However, it's not graphic and is only mentioned briefly.
“It’s always hard to separate yourself from the pain of losing a loved one. I’m not saying to forget him completely, you’ll always remember him but you can’t let that stop you from living your life. Find new people, make new memories. You need to find it in yourself to move on John. He would want that for you.” John felt rage shoot through him.
Jesus, that voice. John loved that voice. It was deep and gravelly without sounding like a bad Batman impression. That voice would sound sexy reading a train stop schedule.
“Jesus. How is he?” Sherlock was baffled yet again as to why he was asking John that when he could have just asked Sherlock directly but he supposed he was a little too out of it to give himself a proper diagnosis.
Sherlock stares at the knife clutched in his shaky hand and just for a moment let’s panic wash over him. This is going to hurt. A lot. He’s not sure he can even do it at all, much less in ten minutes. Not knowing where to go from here he looks up at John hoping to find some courage in those ever loyal and courageous eyes yet he finds none. John has tears in his eyes now and he staring at Sherlock with what can only be described as anguish. Slowly he shakes his head as if he’s begging for Sherlock to stop and put the knife down but he can’t dammit! He can’t put the knife down because if he does than Moriarty or one of his men will be the one to pick it up and then because of his selfishness and cowardice Lestrade will be the one who has to go through this and Sherlock doesn’t think he could handle that. He’s the reason they’re all here in the first place, he’s the one Moriarty’s so obsessed with. If it wasn’t for him they wouldn’t even be in this situation so it’s up to him to get them out.
“Oh dear… Well, no wonder. Only a few months you said?” She sounds quietly horrified and John feels touched that she actually seems to care.
“My brother used to have the same sort of thing with his hockey cards. If they went out of order he would go spare.” They both laugh at the shared oddity before John finds himself rambling on.
he took a swig of whiskey. It burnt his throat and the second drink made his eyes water but he welcomed it, encouraged it even. And if him holding Sherlock’s shirt up to his face so the scent of his lemony body wash and his very own unique scent filled John’s nose made him look like some sort of grieving widower, he simply didn’t care.
“This is all very sweet and as much as I’m loving the whole soap opera feel to this I really would like to move along now. Get the show on the road as they say. So Sherlock darling, what’s your decision?” Sherlock took one last good look at John and tried to commit every detail on his face to memory, if this was the last time he would ever get to see John Watsons face than he would make sure to get a good long look.
“Mm,” Sherlock agrees sauntering over to where John is and glances towards the table. “I’m behind on my experiments now, and it looks like Mycroft got rid of all the ones I was working on before.”
The sound of a zip being undone would echo through the room and his moans would be joined, deeper ragged groans heavy with arousal.
“Yes, I think you do. You just don’t want to admit it.” She waited for him to add something but when he didn’t she just continued on. John wished she hadn’t. “You have a tendency to sabotage good things that are happening to you before they have a chance to go bad themselves.”
“Oh, uh, I’d think around seven?” That was later than John was used to going out but he figured the change of pace could be good for him. Ella would probably be proud. That thought alone nearly made him decline.
They entered the building and their shoes echoed. It sounded like a warehouse of some sort, and in the background he could hear muffled groans and heavy breathing. So, he wasn’t the only one that was captured than. All of a sudden he was tossed to the ground and his head hit the wet cement floor with a sickening thud that made his body go slack for a moment.
“You have every right to tell me to stuff it and walk out of here. I wouldn’t blame you if you did.” He wouldn’t. He’d understand and smile and wish her the best because
“Freak, don’t be stupid.” Apparently Sally’s gag had been removed as well and upon another brief glance at Lestrade and Anderson Sherlock saw they were now gag-free as well. “This is insane!” her whole body was tense as she spoke and he looked about as unnerved as she had when multiple snipers had a sight on her.
“Is he alright?” All three men turned to see Anderson and Donovan. Donovan was holding herself well considering, and though Anderson was still shaking like a cold Chihuahua he looked somewhat put together as well.
John let out another loud, strained sigh and ran his hands through his disheveled blond hair. He was beautiful. Even sitting in a hospital room looking tired and sad and irritated John Watson looked like a work of art. He should get away from Sherlock fast. If he wasn’t careful Sherlock would ruin him and Sherlock would never forgive himself if he were the one to break John Watson for good.
Though medical touches aside, it seemed as if they were always finding excuses to touch each other. If John were passing Sherlock something their fingers would touch and they would both let their skin linger against the others just a tad too long to be considered usual. When talking John would randomly reach out and take a hold of Sherlocks hand, his thumb gently caressing the skin on the back of his hand just as he had done the first night. Sometimes John would be sitting beside him reading and a strand of blonde hair would fall out of place and bother Sherlock until the brunette would eventually decide to just reach out and brush it back, which would usually leave John looking up at him and giving him a small, fond smile. These sort of lingering touches happened occasionally at Baker Street but something about the hospital seemed to make them increase rather significantly
Brown. Brown was everywhere in this room. The couch, the chairs, the desk in the corner, even the walls were painted a pale beige. Sherlock would do a full psychoanalysis based on the colour choice. He’d dissect Ella’s whole personality just from her choice of office colour; he’d suddenly know her whole childhood and all her traumas in life from the colour. John however, couldn’t do any of that, so instead he just stared at the awful bleak brown colour and did everything he could not to look at his therapist.
The heat rises. Sweat prickles his skin and Sherlock’s breath is hitting his lips, the heat from the mans mouth making his lips chap. But John doesn’t care. He doesn't care if it burns him, he wants more and more and moremoremoremore…
“Yeah, best be careful of that,” Lestrade warned, handing the cup of water over to Sherlock while simultaneously stuffing more pillows behind the younger man to prop him up without the added pain. “The morphine should help with the pain but you still need to be careful not to put too much strain on your injuries. Particularly your back and arms. The, uh, burns did quite a number on ‘em.” Sherlock was too preoccupied with the cool feeling of water in his mouth and throat to reply right away. He would have liked to properly wash his mouth out or at least gargle with it, but that would have to wait for later. Nonetheless, the soothing water was like a balm on his dry throat. After the cup was empty he found talking much easier.
“Hear that? Don’t push yourself to hard. In other words no chasing criminals around, no fist fights, and no forgetting to eat.” Sherlock made a face at Johns mini lecture but otherwise kept his mouth shut.
“Sherlock, don’t! Please, it’s fine, let me take this one!” Sherlock would no doubt be too ashamed to ever admit it but for a moment he actually considered taking John up on his offer. They were his eyes. His most precious tool and asset, except when he took a moment and thought on it that wasn’t true. Sure, he used his eyes for everything; he had spent his whole life carefully training them to pick up on the smallest details that no one else would even think to notice. They helped him study people faces and bodies and allowed him too see their deepest, darkest secrets after only a slight glance and yet he knew that when it all came down to it they were not his most precious asset. His most precious and valuable tool in his whole arsenal was a short army doctor with a bit of a temper and a mad addiction to danger. The man that had willingly moved in with him and shot a cabbie to save his life all on the same day and had continued to save his life every day after that. Nobody had ever cared or looked out for him as John had, Lestrade had come the closest to matching what John and him had yet it still wasn’t on the same level. John had saved his life more times than he could count and followed him on chase after chase through London to apprehend countless murderers and criminals. Sherlock owed him everything, his life, his health, his happiness; so it only seemed right that he should do this for John, if this is what it took for him to repay John for his friendship than that’s what he would do.
He wasn’t entirely sure when it had happened but at some point John had drifted off. He woke up to the sound of his phone going off and as soon as the foggy haze of sleep had worn off he leapt up, his heart racing with panic.
“Don’t be daft, John,” Sherlock meant to say this more spitefully than he did, but he was just so relieved John said he wasn’t moving out that he couldn’t find it in him and it came out sounding much softer than intended. “Even you can’t deny that what I did was… unpleasant. Not to mention I was the reason all of you were there in the first place. I… I would understand if it was something you couldn’t get past.”
the parasite. Sherlock dying had changed him, made the strong, kind John he had always known himself to be crumble and wither with grief and in that weak time a new John had grown. A monster of his former self. He didn’t know how to go back, either.
“I’m a big fan, in any case. Or I was…” She trails off, getting lost in her head before finding herself and shaking it off. “When Sherlock jumped off Barts’ the papers all attacked him. It – it made me so angry! I was such a big fan of the two of you. You did good work, meaningful work that helped so many people. Then he died and they all started attacking him. And you. I wanted to do something. To make it different, but I’m not exactly well-known in my field of work. My boss wants me to write about make-up and shopping and silly things you hardly need a degree to write. Then I saw you, on the subway and it all just
With all his messages checked and sorted (or rather ignored) John put his phone down. For a while he just stared at the empty wall in front of him, which of course was never a good idea because every
“Don’t worry. He just went to grab some coffee. Should be back any minute now. He’s been worried sick, Sherlock. We all have…” Lestrade’s words took on a sad tinge and he lowered his head. If Sherlock didn’t know any better he’d say he looked nearly shameful. Which is odd as Sherlock is the only one in this situation who should be feeling anything relating to shame or embarrassment.
Each breath burned his lungs and throat, the air was bitingly cold and felt like it was cutting his insides with every breath. The street he was on didn’t look familiar but he knew he had been there before. As the big building in front of him started to come into focus he understood why he knew he had been there before, in fact he had been there hundreds of times before. It was Bart’s hospital, though it looked different than usual. It looked older. The stones were cracked and the windows were broken, the building itself looked so sad, almost like it was dying. As he grew nearer he realized there was something lying in front of the building unmoving. He started to run faster; this was the thing he was searching for, he knew it! His heart dropped into his stomach when he recognized the long Belstaff and blue scarf the man on the ground was wearing. There was blood everywhere and although he had never been squeamish with that type of thing (he was an army doctor; he didn’t have time for squeamishness) he could feel bile rising in his throat and his skin crawling. He tried to get closer to the man he was now sure was Sherlock but his feet wouldn’t move. It felt as if there were some invisible force there with him holding on tight to the doctor’s legs and refusing to let him move.
“Anytime.” Now that that little dilemma has been solved Sherlock succumbs to the soft warmth of sleep.
“Unbelievable.” John says the word softly, sounding in disbelief himself even though suddenly everything makes more sense then ever. He had known having a young girl chat him up like that was unrealistic. His father had always told him if something seemed too good to be true, that’s often because it
“What?” John repeats, and realizing that he sounds like a broken record and is going to send this conversation in a rather circular direction he decides to add to it. “I—no. No. I’m not doing this right now.”
Tearing himself away from the mirror he stepped under the stream of water and let the hot spray wash over him. It felt amazing. Like years worth of grime was running off of him and being washed down the drain.
he would have seen it. He would have known and he could’ve done something. But instead he was just oblivious. Why was he always so oblivious?
John doesn’t sleep for more then two hours that night before waking up in a cold sweat, his mouth open in a silent scream and his whole body shaking with tremors. His dream had been different this time. He had been on the roof with Sherlock, but instead of helping him or apologizing he had been yelling at him. He’d sneered at the younger man, calling him a machine, a freak, a monster and Sherlock had just stood there, taking it. Than all of a sudden John took a great big step forward and as Sherlock spoke the words ‘good-bye John,” John himself had been the one to shove him off the roof. He felt sick. Sick and shaky and exhausted yet painfully awake. He knew he wasn’t going to be able to fall back asleep tonight, so instead of lying there he stood up and moved out of his room. He considered taking a shower to wash the sweat and smell of fear off him but decided against it. Right now he just needed to forget. So instead, he went into Sherlock’s room grabbed a shirt and a bottle of whiskey from the kitchen and made his way to the sofa to set up shop for the remainder of the night. He made himself comfortable on the couch, covering himself with a blanket and holding Sherlock’s shirt and the whiskey bottle close to his chest. Flicking on the telly and finding an old episode of
“I promise.” His body relaxed at John’s affirmative and was just starting to let the peaceful siren song of deep sleep take him over when he felt something warm and rough encase his hand and his eyes flew open, immediately searching out his hand which was covered in John’s own gentle grip.
As soon as he noticed her hidden anxiousness he felt a stab of guilt shoot through his stomach. There was no way he could outright reject her.
“Sherlock, just think about it a minute,” Lestrade was looking at him carefully and speaking with the same cautiousness you would use to get a murderer to put his weapon down or to talk to a skittish animal so as not to frighten it. “You have options. Let’s all just talk this through a minute.”
“I know that you likely don’t wish to be anywhere near me any longer, after seeing how… repulsive, I can be.”
“Sorry about that.” He whispered quietly into the cup, his own voice grating on his nerves and his head hurting from the violent coughing he had done while vomiting. John and Greg’s faces looked grim and made Sherlock feel like an insect under a microscope.
“Somehow, I think I’ll be alright with that.” They talk more, chat a bit. They agree that John should start tomorrow. Sarah insists the sooner the better, and before John knows it, he’s promising to show up for his shift at 7am the next morning. When he hangs up he finds himself thrumming with energy. He doesn’t know whether it’s excitement or anxiety, though it’s most likely a mix of both, but he does know that this deserves a celebration. It’s a big step after all. It’s the start of John getting the scraps of his life back together.
He shook his head and moved on. No point in dwelling on any of that right now. The third message surprised him as it was from someone he’d entirely forgotten about.
“I, well, I don’t normally do this. Approaching guys I don’t know I mean, but I felt like I would have regretted it if I didn’t say something to you.” John wasn’t really sure what to say to that, so he just said nothing and let her continue on after a short and slightly awkward pause. “It’s just that, you’re exactly my type and I was wondering if you’d like to grab dinner sometime?” John felt himself lost for words yet again. It’s not like he’d never gotten chatted up before – though maybe not this directly – and she seemed like a very sweet and lovely girl but the thought of dating again held no appeal. Though she was still giving him that innocent and hopeful smile and as he looked closer he could see that her hand resting on her leg was trembling slightly and her smile seemed a tad shaky as well.
“John…” John was breathing heavy and looked miserable. Him apologizing to Sherlock for something that was so completely out of his control made the pangs in his heart return full blast. “That’s ridiculous. You couldn’t have done anything more than you did. You are not at fault for any of that.” John looked back up at him and gave a small, sad smile.
“Goodnight, John.” She says as she pulls away, still smiling sadly. “We’ll talk later, okay?” He nods again, feeling every bit the idiot anyone has ever told him he’s been (which after living with Sherlock had happened near
“I didn’t plan this. I didn’t lie to you about everything either. I am a big fan of you and Sherlock. I read about all the cases on your blog and the paper. I even wrote a few…” She lifts the envelope and looks at John as if he were an active volcano about to explode. John doesn’t have the energy to explode. Doubts he ever will again, really.
The only reason he had even been able to take a cab the last time was because his brain had been so focused on how late he was to meet Mindy that he hadn’t the time to ponder about time lost.
without Sherlock, like his lungs just didn’t want to expand and contract to give him oxygen anymore. It was like he was unconsciously trying to follow after Sherlock. That is, when he wasn’t doing it consciously.
The red dots of the sniper rifles now turned their attention to Sally who tensed up slightly, but otherwise remained calm. She was clearly terrified but holding herself together quite well under the circumstances and Sherlock couldn’t help but gain a bit more respect for her. Most people tended to get a bit more panicky when their lives were being threatened by sniper rifles and the only thing standing in the way of their death was a sociopath whom they fight with on a daily basis; Anderson had been proof enough of that.
“I know that you will be wanting to vacate Baker Street. I just want you too know I understand why and there are no… hard feelings?” It comes out as a question though it wasn’t necessarily meant to be one. He’s utter rubbish at conversations like this, ones that involve actual emotion and
He blocked out the voice and focused instead on making his face and voice entirely non-chalant. If John did leave him than Sherlock will except it with dignity. No making a fuss. That didn’t mean he shouldn’t inquire about him however.
For the first time since he had entered the restaurant he actually truly looked at her. She really was incredibly pretty. When he had first met her on the tube she’d been dressed casually, her hair pulled back and not a lot of makeup on. Now she was trying to impress. She had a short flowy turquoise sundress that complimented her darker skin tone nicely and wrapped around her snuggly, showing off her slim figure. Her dark hair was pulled up into a pretty braided bun with a few curled strands falling down. The hairstyle made her small features and slim neck stand out more and her ears twinkled with the small diamond rhinestones adorning them. Her makeup was still kept simple, nothing overdone or clown-y. Instead she used a small amount to highlight her features and make them pop.
“As a fellow scientist, I agree that repeating an experiment is a must for accurate results.” John nods along very seriously until quite suddenly they both break into soft giggles and bring their lips together for the second, but certainly not last time.
this was. With a sudden sense of urgency he bolted up from the couch, grabbing the shirt, and raced off towards the laundry machine. He can just forget this ever happened. He shoved the shirt into the portable washing machine and felt a newfound determination. What the hell was he thinking before? That he could just go on wanking to his best friend and everything would be fine? Fuck no. That just… That just was
“Oh, that bastard.” John growls. All in the span of a few seconds John has darted across the room, grabbed his phone and is viciously dialing a number. It barely rings once before the person on the other end picks up.
With a sigh John shut his laptop, picked up what was left of his whiskey and climbed the stairs to his bedroom. Everything he did to distract himself just ended up having the opposite effect. There was nothing that he owned or any hobbies of his that didn’t remind him of his best friend. His blog was the worst; he didn’t even know why he thought it would be a good idea to go on it. He supposed it was just a force of habit; after all it was what he always used to do whenever he was bored or needed something to pass the time. But in the end the blog was written completely about Sherlock, so without the detective in the picture any longer it seemed almost pointless. True, he still had a fair few cases that he never got around to writing up and he might do that when it didn’t hurt to reminisce so much (if it
