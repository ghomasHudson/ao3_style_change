Dean deftly flicked the button of Cas’s jeans, the zipper giving way as Dean pulled him out of his underwear and swiftly stroked upward with a gentle twisting motion, his thumb dipping into and spreading Cas’s precum around the head of his cock.
“Sorry…” and Dean thought he sounded it. “I guess I thought maybe it would make you feel...cared for…’cause you
“Yeah….But not yet.” Cas said, sounding a little deflated himself. “I want you in person first,” Dean heard the longing in his voice. “Besides, any minute my sister’s gonna arrive and cockblock anything we might get in the middle of.”
“Exactly.” Benny nodded at Dean. “Because when the darkness gathers around you, you need to find something to give you hope, to just keep moving forward, and sure enough eventually, the world shifts.”
Balthazar’s expression clouded and he looked down, clearly biting back some comment. Surprised, Dean tried meeting Cas’s eyes but Cas looked away up to the woman on stage and took a sip of his beer. Sam broke the awkwardness by asking Balthazar about his work. They continued their small talk.
Dean shook his head. “Don’t you worry about me. Go get some sleep.” He flashed her a smile, ”I’ll make us coffee and drop you back to the hospital in the morning. Then Garth and I will get to work here.”
Cas turned back to him, eyes crinkling and his head tilting at Dean’s expression. “What’s that look for?” Cas asked, a curious smile on his lips.
The sun was almost on the horizon already and Dean regretted briefly that he wouldn’t have more time, more light to remember the way Cas’s eyes reflected the blue of the water in morning. This would have to be enough. Dean couldn’t take another day. He already felt like a ghost. The last living part of him died months ago when he whispered those words.
“So, pardon my saying it buddy but there’s no place to stay within a good distance, or eat for that matter. And you’re looking a bit stretched. Like maybe I can drop you at a motel and you can hit the beach tomorrow.”
Cas turned his body towards him as Dean's hands came up to cup his face. Dean laid a soft kiss on his lips before pulling back to look at him again, arms sliding down around him until his hands rested on the small of Cas’s back.
Cas opened his eyes, heavy-lidded, shifting the cant of his head to look at Dean. Dean recognized that look. Cas was aroused. He wanted him. Dean was sure of it.
Dean pulled into a gas station to refill the tank. He’d almost left Cas’s with the pumpkins still in the trunk but remembered as he heard a bump and roll pulling out of the driveway. He stopped the car, leaving all three on the front step. He couldn’t face any reminders of today.
“Dean, what do you feel?” Cas repeated gently, looking up into Dean’s face from where he knelt next to him, trying to catch his eyes.
She was right. Looking at Cas took Dean’s breath away. Cas had always been beautiful, but it was more than that. In the years since Dean left, Castiel had finished the transition from a boy to a man. His body was lean but somehow broader. His cheeks were slightly fuller, hair a little longer, with a whisper of stubble on his jaw where Dean remembered baby smooth skin. He wore a blue button-down shirt and black jeans. He thought of his Cas, so adorable in glasses. This Cas was older….his eyes were still stunning.
“I’m starting that new job,” Cas told him, cutting him short. “In the department store. I start Monday.”
Cas forced himself to breathe against the knot in his throat….fought against the goddamn water in his eyes, threatening to surge. He couldn’t look at Dean. Dean blamed
Cas’s gratitude turned to irritation, “You said you’d be supportive….” he eyed the floor, shaking his head slightly, before looking back up to meet Balthazar's eyes. “You even said it might be
This was spinning out of Dean’s control, Balthazar was manipulating the story, making it into something it wasn’t.
“Look over there Cas! Pumpkins.” Dean slowed down and pulled off the side to where a makeshift farm stand offered late-season produce and bright orange pumpkins. “You remember when you insisted we carve that smelly pumpkin for Halloween?”
“Besides, chicks love guys who can play the guitar so I assume dicks love them too,”  Benny smirked.
“So gorgeous Cas,” Dean breathed. “God you smell so fucking good,” Cas felt Dean’s mouth traveling from the hollow behind his ear to the space just below his jaw, his breath sweet and warm. It sent shivers through him. “Can’t even say what I wanna do to you...got me all worked up, don’t you?”
“Dean,” Cas nodded in greeting as they both sat down on opposite sides of the booth. He wore jeans and a red t-shirt that somehow made the blue of his eyes pop in a way Dean thought must defy the principles of optics. He still had a bit of the tired pained expression from the night before.
He didn’t understand why Dean decided to contact him again. He was glad he did, and thankful that Dean told him at least a little of why he left, but he could tell that Dean was disinterested. When Dean wanted something or someone he looked them in the eye, daring them to escape before taking possession. That’s how it felt the night they met.
Cas’s long life had taught him to understand patience. He didn’t know if Dean would ever feel what Cas felt for him, but could be patient for Dean. If all else failed, Cas’s life had taught him to understand sacrifice. He would be whatever Dean needed. He would take whatever Dean could give and sacrifice the rest. For Dean. Always for Dean.
in Valens knew, though he and Fred had never spoken of it directly. He’d always assumed it was something Fred would rather not know about.
story play out on the screen. Akin to their past, up until the moment when Dean walked away from it all.
"Charlie" in Dean's dream refers to the troops common reference to the Viet Cong as "Victor Charlie" or plain "Charlie" for short, as opposed to Charlie Bradbury (though we may see her later).
Dean did his homework. He wanted this night to be perfect for Cas so thought about the planning for days before actually calling him.
to come meet them. He remembered the club and the first few drinks and pouring out his disappointment over Dean not coming to Rachel's to Charlie and Stevie over tequila shots. He remembered Charlie introducing him to her friend Alfie. He remembered Alfie buying a round and inching up to Castiel on the dance floor and making it obvious he was interested in easing Cas’s heartache. He remembered making it very clear to Alfie that
The next minute the loss of Dean suddenly crashed in on him like the storm-ravaged sea, and Cas didn’t know if he would ever come up for air -but then once again it would ebb, leaving behind a dull ache. He’d call Rachel, or go for a run in between, but then the next wave would hit, and Cas couldn’t predict the timing. He wondered at times which would be worse - never being free of the pain of losing Dean? Or forgetting him?
“It’s Balthazar’s car,” he explained, shrugging. “So I would imagine it's in an airport parking lot somewhere.”
Cas breathed out a deep sigh, eyes fixed on the closed apartment door, where a moment ago his Dean had stood.
They passed a while longer like this talking about everything and nothing all at the same time pausing occasionally to comment on the plot of the soap or yell at the characters through the screen.
He looked from its sparse contents to the growing heap of clothing in the basket on the floor, calculating that he could put off doing laundry for another two or three days, max. This is what his life was now - work and tv and the occasional dinner at Sam's. The most momentous thing he had to plan around was laundry night. His guitar was the closest thing Dean had to regular company, and even
The back of Dean’s hand brushed against Cas’s as they lay awkwardly side by side between them. Cas couldn’t help but feel it was intentional. He forced himself to breathe more deeply, not knowing if Dean realized what he was doing, always on the edge of certainty. He looked everywhere but at Dean.
Soon virtually everyone in the club was singing along with Dean. He ventured his eyes open, and saw Cas, smiling, clapping and singing along with the rest of the table. Sam, Benny, Jess, Cas. His
“You done?” Dean asked, reaching for the foil left from Cas’s sandwich, taking it and his own to a trash can nearby.
Dean opened the large rectangular box and his eyes widened to find a guitar case. Inside, an acoustic guitar with the fiery inlay of a flaming sun, like a sigil around the soundhole.
Once Dean arrived in Cas’s neighborhood he used a payphone to call all the numbers Balthazar left with him. Getting no results he rode around and sought out the more sordid hangouts he’d told him about in search of Cas or Meg or anyone who knew them. He stopped near an alley outside of a shitty motel frequented by drifters when someone asked “Hey you looking for something in particular?”
With his left arm freed, Dean shoved the tattooed guy off of him, grabbing a nearby chair and smashing it over his head, while Sam grabbed Red baseball cap, blood now pouring from his nose, and threw him across the room. His back slammed into the side of the pool table and he collapsed into a moaning heap.
Benny sighed…”You got this brother. If it’s closure you want, well… I think you've needed this for a long time.”
kitchen. A warm feeling crept over him. Maybe it was the evening sun glancing through the kitchen window, making the room glow in just the right way. Maybe it was the still warm imprint that Charlie’s hug had left on his body, not a physical warmth so much as a sense of belonging. It could have been the laughs of the children drifting in from outside. As Cas looked around the kitchen, he realized that although he was alone, he didn’t feel lonely.
Hannah took care of the trick or treaters while Dean’s eyes were still trained on Cas as he led the kids to the neighbor’s house.
“It’s gorgeous!” High praise coming from Rachel who knew her plants and flowers. “Which one of you ordered this?”
Cas who had foolishly dreamed of a house with Dean and a white picket fence. Who had loved him and trusted him with such a ferocity that Dean was beguiled into believing it possible once. That they could defy the whole world and have it.
“I’ll be good to you. Give me a chance. I’ll be really good to you. I want to be good to you. You’re so beautiful.”* - From Chapter 2 of Twist and Shout
Cas closed his eyes leaning into Dean's touch as his fingers played there. He reached up and took Dean’s hand in his own, pulling it forward and pressing it to his cheek, stroking the backs of Dean's fingers with his own. This calloused hand that had known every part of him, both rough and gentle against his skin. Cas pressed his lips against the heel of Dean’s palm, laying a delicate kiss there. A dizzying warmth spread through him and it seemed for a moment as if they held their breath.
“Hey - you called me! But it's good to know you’re still a belligerent wise ass,” he smiled. “I think you’re afraid...you’re afraid to let yourself have anything good because it might be taken from you. You had a good life with Cas. You were happy together, and then the war took you away. But you’ve grown Dean...you’ve learned so much about yourself and learned to work through so many of these things. Sounds to me like you may have the chance for real happiness again...but I think the idea that you might lose it all over scares you to death.”
Dean settled into a rhythm, rocking against Cas, his erection hard against Dean’s stomach, their foreheads pressed together. Dean took it in his hand, smearing the precum around Cas’s head with his thumb, then stroking along with their rhythm until they were both on the edge of release.
“Trick or treat Cas?” Cas felt Dean’s breath at the back of his ear. Dean lowered his mouth to the nape of his neck, kissing him with open lips, sucking gently, pulling at the little down of hair.
Jenny collapsed into a ball of giggles at Cas’s feet. Hannah smiled as Cas offered a hand to pull Jenny back up.
“You know he thinks of you like a son, sweetheart. We both do,” Mildred’s voice broke over the words and Dean pulled her in tightly again and held her close until he could feel her silent sobs subside. He grabbed at the corners of his eyes with his fingers as he stepped back, clearing his throat. He wasn’t gonna let himself cry. Not now. Not in front of Mildred. His throat locked too tight for words, he nodded meaningfully back.
After a moment, his lids heavy and voice husky with desire, Dean whispered "We need a place where I can make you mine, Angel.” The smell of Cas's skin, the feel of his body against his, my god Dean thought, he was perfect.
Cas shook his head on his end of the line, “Dean, there’s nothing to fix. The past is done. It’s....it's all new now." His voice dropped to a whisper
There was a shift in the music and slowly Dean moved to turn Cas around in his arms, pressing against him from behind. Cas gasped in surprise, feeling Dean, hard against the back of his thigh. Cas closed his eyes, his head tilted back, forehead brushing near Dean’s as Dean ran his hands up the front of Cas’s stomach to his chest, wrapping around and holding him close. This was the Dean that Cas remembered. Bold, unafraid to stake a claim over him. Cas could feel the length of Dean’s whole body, warm and welcoming and flush against his own as Dean’s lips brushed Cas’s ear.
The quiet fell on him now, heavy like a shroud, relieved only by the occasional creak and rattle of the percolator. The familiar little sounds soothed him - anchored him to the knowledge that he was blessedly still alive and part of a living breathing world. The dead don't drink coffee. As soon as he got some caffeine in him, Dean would shed the silence of this place.
Jess smiled victoriously, kissing Dean on the cheek. “I forgive you.” she smiled “But you have to sing a duet with me tonight to earn it.”
As Cas made his way out of the restroom and back to the tables he slowed for a moment. Dean was there at their table, flagging the waitress and lifting his glass to indicate a refill. She nodded and he gave her a smile. From this distance Cas couldn’t see Dean’s sea-green eyes, but that sandy brown hair, those broad shoulders, and sweet smile stoked a warmth inside him and Cas felt his own smile spread softly across his face in response. Dean was goddamn gorgeous, and even after all of the bad that had happened Cas knew that Dean was
Charlie held her hands up in surrender. “Okay! Okay! Shit - I’m sorry. Really. You’re right. I don’t know him. I was...I’m just sorry, okay? It's just - I don't like what he did to you.”
‘Sorry I couldn’t be there. These flowers are to brighten your day and to remind you that I’m thinking of you, always. Call me Cas!
The city faded into the distance behind them, the air taking on the scent of pines the further they got from the thick murky heat of its asphalt streets and traversed into country back roads. The trees, at first sparse, now surrounded them in legions and Dean finally pulled into a hiker’s lot.
Then, when Dean finally drew the last gasps and moans of pleasure from Cas’s lips as he filled him, spilling over, warm and wet inside him, Cas would let himself go, and come for him, painting both their bodies with it as he shuddered in Dean’s arms. It would be Dean’s turn then to keep watch as Cas, sated and happy, drifted off dreamily to sleep.
his fault. No one could have prepared either of them for what the war would do, but that was Dean’s problem. He was the one who chose to walk out on Cas the way he did.
Dean’s eyes searched the room landing on Jess’s guitar in the corner. Desperate for something to do he grabbed and tuned it, sitting down to strum a little. Sam admired the way Dean’s fingers moved over the guitar as if it had become an extension of his own body as he picked out the beginning of Simple Man.
“Dean!” Cas’s voice wasn’t loud, but it was firm and urgent. “What are you doing? Why are you leaving like this?”
“I think……” Cas hesitated. “I know I want us to be,” Cas said softly. “......Are we Dean?” he asked in return.
“No Dean. It wasn’t you. It was...” Cas swallowed and looked to his sister and Jess, “Anyway, Rachel came to help with the last of the boxes and I wanted her to meet Jess.”
“Yeah. Really, I’m good, - ’sides,” Benny could hear the teasing in Dean’s voice, as he answered with a confidence he didn't feel “I’m the unconquered sun or some Roman shit remember?”
Sam had hinted before that things were off between him and Jess, but last night everything hit the fan and Jess walked out. Sam had been working so hard to advance in his job with the law firm. There was no such thing as nine to five. Business lunches, dinners, and fifteen, sometimes eighteen-hour days were taking their toll on Sam and Jess’s relationship. To make things worse the office culture included an unhealthy amount of cocaine being passed around casually as associates struggled to keep up with the relentless demands of the partners. Sam had at first resisted, but then gave in just to keep pace as the pressure to perform mounted.
Cas was certain now that Dean could feel him too. His human body betraying his desire as they clung to each other. Castiel wasn’t sure exactly why Dean started calling him “Angel.” but he liked it...a lot.
“Ah.” Rufus nodded. “Odysseus was a warrior, a hero in the Trojan Wars in ancient times,” he bent to pick up the remnant of a chair leg, tossing it in the garbage. “The Odyssey is the story of his journey home... and for that matter the story of every warrior from ancient Greece to World War I to Vietnam.”
Dean had parked his motorcycle just outside the derelict apartment building. He climbed on and started it up pulling ahead to catch up with Cas.
Dean broke a smile. His already good mood buoyed at the idea of sharing these little firsts with Cas, touristy or not.
He had no idea where Balthazar had gone or if or when he'd return. Cas wasn’t really sure how he felt about that at the moment. He knew the whole situation wasn’t fair to either of them. He hadn’t lied when he told Balthazar he was trying, but despite his best efforts when it came to Balthazar what he most often felt was some combination of guilt or obligation.
?” Cas was trying and failing to steady his voice now that the full storm of memory was overtaking him. All the hurt that he hadn’t expressed, pouring from him, choking his breaths.  “You do realize, right?  You realize I was just going to wake up tomorrow, or sometime during the night and find out you were
that sent Dean's emotions finally over the edge. He was thankful that Rufus couldn't see the tears that streamed down his face, coming from the part of him that wished he could let himself believe that.
If you haven't already, raise a glass, literally or figuratively, to Dean and Cas this week - and likewise to Misha Collins who has been so openly supportive!
Near the corner Dean spotted a man about his age huddled in an alley against a closed storefront. A sign simply said “hungry”. He hesitated for a beat as he recognized the standard issue military green jacket of a vet. Cas was rushing ahead of him now though, past a food truck and around the corner to a place with outdoor tables overlooking the northern waterfront. Dean hastened to catch up.
“Hey! I told you when I saw you next,” Benny said, getting louder, “I wanted to hear progress on that guitar!”
As for Fred, after he enlisted and fought in the war he came to the job briefly, but he never really felt like he returned home either. Not right away. Even worse because it looked like home, and all the people expected him to be just fine, but some wounds were deeper, invisible, and nobody could understand why he was acting so damaged. So he quit his job and drifted for a while, but not forever.
He explained that he was in town on personal business and just needed the apartment to crash. He grabbed the phonebook from the desk in the office and gave a quick look.
Dean, at last, broke the stillness that had settled over them. “Well...I should get going and let you get back to your dinner.”
“Stop...you’re feeling shitty so you’re taking it out on yourself. I want you to close your eyes and listen to me for a few minutes, okay? Pretend I’m there to take care of you.” Cas’s voice sounded wistful.
Dean’s face flushed at the idea of laying down here with Cas and was glad for the darkness to hide his reaction. He didn’t want to delve into his thoughts at the moment. He only knew he wanted to feel Cas next to him, wanted to hold him close as he should have in that barn tonight as Cas lay dying. His whole being needed to make it up to Cas for not holding him tight and letting him know he wasn't alone as the poison and pain spread through him, taking him over. But Dean had froze. He just stood there not knowing what to do, too busy trying to think of a way to save Cas.
“That’s what it sounds like to me Dean. Damn smart of him too.” Rufus paused. Letting that sink in. “Do you remember anything else?”
Dean had a plan. The place he had been the happiest he ever remembered being before the war. Where Cas had smiled, and dreamed and made his heart feel pure and new. Somehow it was fitting it be there. Cas had been so happy that the glow spilled out from his eyes and lips and smile as he walked along the shore. Yelling back over the sound of the waves ‘
“Cas, you’re a mess,” Sam observed as Dean lowered him gently to sit on the edge of the bed. “You should get out of those clothes and we’ll wash them.”
As Inias stepped away Garth stepped in and gripped Dean in a tight hug. Garth was a hugger by nature and normally Dean would deflect with some good natured wisecrack but not tonight. Dean let the embrace wash over him, letting Garth do the same. Finally they broke, Dean clapped a hand on Garth’s shoulder and smiled. He reached down for his coffee, and sipped it standing to let his legs stretch a bit after the long drive.
Bobby hung up. Dean closed his eyes and sighed, leaning against the wall. He ran his hand over his forehead to rub away the tension. This sucked.
He looked down at his hands suddenly, afraid that maybe he’d been too blunt - that maybe Cas would think him too pushy or too damn naive, but he couldn’t help it. That’s what it was. Dean was in love. He was never more certain of anything in his life. It didn’t matter that it was only three weeks. He
Hours later, Dean was laying on the bed in the studio above the shop, staring at the ceiling, when the phone rang. It was Cas.
“I’m sorry,” Dean whispered against Cas’s skin, for reasons he wasn’t entirely sure. Sorry for fucking up tonight? Sorry for being here in Cas’s bed when clearly Cas just needed to rest? Sorry for being so fucking needy? For clearly taking advantage of his friend in a moment of weakness? Dean had a catalog of sorry.
“Do it Dean!” Cas placed his hand on Dean’s forearm as he glanced over to see Cas’s encouraging smile. Blue eyes locked on green.
Dean looked past the colonnade to a figure standing, hands in his pockets, his back to him looking down into the reflecting pool, lit softly against the night.
Dean’s lips pressed together raising an eyebrow, but his eyes held a twinkle, “I have news for you Cas, if a guy climbs on the back of my bike and grips me as tight as you did, odds are he ain’t straight.”
Cas stared, his eyes open and warm. Dean leaned in, fleshy lips gently caressing Cas’s and pulling away. Cas leaned in in response, slotting Dean’s lips against his as he kissed him again, and then again. Dean teased just the tip of his tongue against the seam of Cas’s lips until he opened to Dean, inviting him in. Light and slick, their tongues flitted against each other.
“No Dean!” Sam cried out, trying again to stand, blinking wildly to try and focus, “You’re on a date...lemme go...I’m ‘kay.”
Thank you for coming along on this journey with me so far! If you like the story don't forget to subscribe you get the chapter updates. I will be away this week and will post one more chapter Sunday. I will try to post Thursday but most likely it won't be ready until the following weekend.
Cas shifted, getting one hand on his own cock as he continued to stroke Dean wildly with the other. Cas was still coming- the last thick ropes of it painting the base of Dean’s dick and sending him over the edge.
Dean met Rufus’s eyes with an impassive stare. Rufus waited patiently for Dean to speak. It was Dean who finally broke contact.
His apartment wasn’t that far, and too soon they pulled up onto Cas’s block. As Dean drove them closer Cas noticed the familiar car parked on the street.
Dean was quiet and withdrawn, his eyes closed for the most part. When he did open them, Cas could see some private struggle going on behind his eyes.
“Yeah - the Sundance Kid over there,” Dean smirked without even looking back, pausing to sink another ball. “I’ve been toying with him since we came in here Sammy.”
As for Cas...well Cas only thought he needed Dean. But Cas was wrong. Years ago, when the world seemed new and full of hope Dean made Cas a promise. He would take care of Cas. He would protect him. Make sure no one would hurt him. He didn’t lie. He was keeping his promise.
Dean let the hot water melt the grime and sweat from his body. He normally would relish a long shower after a hunt but tonight he was so physically and emotionally drained that he found himself leaning against the tiled walls for support. For a moment the warmth and exhaustion caused his mind to drift into a half-dream...to another night. He saw Cas lying on the floor, injured and barely able to raise his head as Ishim looked menacingly at Dean. “I'm gonna help you,” he told Cas looking at Dean, “I'm gonna cure you of your human weakness - same way I cured my own. By cutting it out.”
The woman giving out the candy was a teacher at Tommy’s school, so the wait to grab a candy bar had been a little longer than usual as she greeted each little child in the mob that surrounded her porch with smiles, warmhearted praise for their costumes, and inquiries about their Halloween adventures.
Dean sighed audibly, collapsing onto the couch with the phone receiver in hand, “Cas...it's so good to hear your voice buddy.”
“Cas, let me take you home,”  he jerked his head back, signaling him to climb on behind him. A humorless laugh escaped Cas as Dean looked at him expectantly.
Cas was pulling him up the stairs now and honestly, Dean didn’t have the strength or will to fight him. He just wanted to curl up next to Cas and lie down and forget about firecrackers and letters and what a jack-o-lantern stabbed in the head might symbolize.
Dean considered it, if only to see that Cas was okay through the night. Everything about being here in this apartment made him feel awkward and alien. Dean found himself looking around, searching for anything familiar. A plant or an old quilt - a picture frame - something from when he and Cas shared a life and a home. He found nothing. It
He’d told Cas because Dean needed to know. He needed to know if Cas would look at him differently. He needed to look in his eyes to see if there was a trace of blame or revulsion. Dean expected it - had braced himself for it.
“That’s the one. We’re hoping to close by the end of the month. I swear I think Andrea’s in love with that tree and the swing more than the house itself.”
Sam noticed the guy in question had not so subtly come outside to have a smoke, even though smoking inside the hall was perfectly normal.
“You can’t trust any of these sons-a-bitches Cas,” Dean scowled. “Nobody cares about people like us.”
“Is that what you got going on now Crowley?” The man turned to confront him. “Cause stories ‘been going round about you too!”
Dean shivered a bit and pulled his collar forward over his neck as the sun dipped deeper on the horizon and a chill set in. His hands and brow were cold with sweat, no doubt his nerves about tonight manifesting in all manner of unpleasant ways.
With a lopsided smile Cas reminded Dean,“Firstly, April was a woman. Secondly, I was fully human at the time. Thirdly and most importantly I wasn’t in love with April, and the desire I felt in that brief moment of need for her, is nothing compared to my desire, and love for you Dean Winchester.” This last he said placing his hand on Dean’s cheek again and brushing his lips with his thumb. “I want to be sure I don’t accidentally do something that hurts you."
“Cops’ll be here any minute boys!” Crowley announced, sparing a glance to Sam, “Best get him out of here” he said, nodding at Dean.
A week passed and Dean thought that would be the end of it. It pained him too much to allow himself to think on it so he tried to busy himself to keep it out of his mind. Some nights he couldn’t help himself. He thought back to the party where he first saw Cas.
Dean closed his eyes, remembering Cas all laid out for him in white, crazed with desire. White garters, a white nightgown - the perfect fusion of innocence and sin, a shy flush on Cas’s cheeks as Dean fucked into him, claiming his wild bride.
Dean clenched and unclenched his fist, letting go of the t-shirt and looking away, ignoring Cas’s outstretched hand.
“Sammy!” Dean ran over to him, Cas in tow. Sam’s eyes were hollowed out and unfocused, a pained expression on his face.
“After we got together this summer at the club, Jess called a few times to say hello. That’s how we ended up going to lunch that day I came through town with Rachel.”
“You were born for it Cas,” Dean winked. “Being a doctor I mean..caring for people. You took really good care of me before I bolted like a fool.”
“Yeah...tell me again about yesterday Dean. I know you did already but humor me. Start at the beginning and give me everything you remember. I mean
“Thank you for the pumpkins for the kids.” she motioned to the three Jack-o'lanterns now all lit up and sitting out on the porch -  one with an angry face, another with a scared looking expression, and one with a giant Jack-o-lantern grin.
Sam nodded and understood. Privacy, family only. Partners weren’t considered family. In some places getting caught with a homosexual lover could still get you arrested or worse. San Francisco was kind of a safe haven, or safer one, but hospitals still followed official policies.
Music figures in a lot of what happens in these characters' lives so yeah - I'm probably going to put in some cheesy youtube links to some of the songs for mood music.
Now, before he even realized what he was doing he had spilled all of it to Pamela. He didn’t even understand why it was so easy. Something about her maybe, like Dean had the feeling she’d seen a lot of shit in her life too. Maybe it was the Harley she had parked outside that had them talking motorcycles a full half hour after his first session ended, but Dr. Barnes seemed like a regular chick he could have a beer with.
“Let’s go with the boxer I guess. Or whichever you want.” Dean didn’t really care, as long as it was with Cas.
Dean squinted his eyes at the man like his question was incomprehensible. Before he could think better of it he blurted “What the fuck do you think man?” His stomach hurt, his throat felt torn and raw and his head still felt like someone had taken a log splitter to it.
There was another awkward silence as Cas waded through Dean’s words searching for sound footing, every phrase from Dean’s mouth seemed to send out a hundred vibrant tendrils of possible significance and purpose. Which one was true? Which meaning should he cling to and water and nourish?
I understand that now Dean. I understand why you needed to go. I didn’t for a long time. I was angry and hurt and I blamed you. I know now it wasn’t your fault. It wasn’t mine either. This thing that happened, it happened to the whole world, and we were just caught up in it all.
Cas hadn’t told Dean about Michael getting him fired. He knew he needed to look for another job somewhere. “I  may have to work. I’m not sure yet. Why?”
Dean finally broke himself away and returned to his work. He rolled back under the Scamp, a hint of a smile on his face.
“I was wrong to leave the way I did.” he said finally. “It was all I could manage at the time, but that didn’t make it the right thing…. I wanted to tell you I was sorry. It wasn’t you Cas. It was me. It was always me. I was broken...and I couldn’t fix it so I ran. I ran from everyone.”
“I’m not kicking you out if that’s what you were thinking…..in fact I  figured that if your week was as shitty as I imagine it's been the least I can do is invite you for burgers and salads on the deck with me and the kids.”
“You’re mine, aren’t you...fucking my hand so sweetly so I can watch you,” Cas pulled on Dean's erection with firm strokes. It was rhetorical, Cas stating a fact. Dean knew it but found himself nodding anyway, wanting more, wanting to belong to Cas. Dean was high as a fucking kite from nothing else but Cas, and he wanted Cas right up there with him.
“Just the check I guess….and can I borrow a pen?” She finalized their ticket leaving it on the table with an extra pen from her apron.
“I feel like the walls are closing in on me and I don’t even know who you are anymore! You don’t listen to me! You just expect me to fall in line with whatever you and Dean decide is best for everyone!” She yelled at him finally, throwing clothes in a suitcase and storming out, the engagement ring left on the kitchen table.
Dean tried to sleep but was awoken and distracted by the sound of boots in the hall, doors opening and closing, furniture creaking in another room, men’s voices - different voices at different times through the night, talking or laughing with Darlene. Dean listened carefully each night hoping he would finally hear his father’s voice amongst them, but it was almost two weeks before he returned.
“That’s it baby!” Dean praised as he felt Cas’s first hot burst of come spill over onto both of their stomachs and into his hand, continuing to stroke him as burst after burst issued from his cock - Cas’s muscles clenching and fluttering around him bringing Dean finally over the edge.
“Mommy! Mommy! Look!” Jenny found her legs again, pushing herself out of Cas’s arms with chocolate fingers, jumping down to run up the lawn while holding her bucket up, dripping out pieces of candy along the way. Cas scooped them up for her as he and Tommy followed at a slightly slower pace.
“Yes and no…. those stories, they come from the experience of man. I take it you’re not familiar yet with Joseph Campbell? Carl Jung? There’ll be some downtime here. You might want to check out the reading room.”
“You have to promise me you’ll stop the drugs Sam...and if you can’t I’ll get you in a program. I don’t care how much it costs.”
“Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth, for your love is more delightful than wine.” Cas replied playfully leaning in close again, lips brushing Dean’s as he spoke.
Benny paused as he looked around the circle at the thoughtful faces of the men considering his words, some gazing back with rapt attention, others with their eyes focused off in the distance as if considering their own “endless night.” Dean’s eyes were focused on Benny his forearms resting on his legs, leaning in to the story. Benny smiled, this was after all for Dean.
“Just please,” Dean gave his home number to Gabriel, adding. “Tell him I just wanted to make sure he’s okay.”
"Well..let's see." She began counting on her fingers. "You went to study pre-med because your father sent you away. You sacrificed a relationship with your sister because your family told you you would ruin her life by association. Part of you I think believed it when that asshole brother of yours told you you were a curse on the family.” Charlie turned to look up at him now, reaching her hand to his chest. “Then when someone gave you the slightest bit of love...that was it wasn’t it? I think you told yourself that was all you could hope for in life.”
The man leered inching further into Dean’s face. “So what, is Crowley tryna throw us out so he can give you a little something up your ass boy? Cause I heard that’s where John Winchester’s boy likes it."
Dean cringed at the volume of the overly enthusiastic greeting from another clipboard-carrying stranger. This one wearing a short-sleeved dress shirt, tie and dress pants.
“I said some things last night.” he said finally, “did things… I don’t know why. I guess I just lost my mind for a bit.”
Cas approached the table, what looked like a typical business dinner, pen in hand ready to deliver the standard line.
When he opened his eyes again Hannah was staring back at him looking...sad. She chewed her lip a moment, looking downward as if considering something before turning to him again.
“Gross.” Sam rolled his eyes, plopping down next to Dean on the couch again and grabbing another slice of pizza. “Come on Romeo, find a game on TV or something.”
“It would be better if you weren’t such a dick!” he said finally. Cas looked up, pleading, “Can you do that Gabriel? Please, for today, can you not be a dick?”
“Cas!” Dean shouted. Cas turned once more, walking closer again to prevent the entire neighborhood from looking out of their windows at them, not that it wasn’t already too late. He met Dean’s doleful eyes head on with a challenging glare.
“Music would be a good change I think...nothing too heavy though. Head still hurts a bit,” Dean explained.
Over the next hour or so they made small talk, Dean detailing all of Baby’s specs for Cas. He was certain that Cas drifted off a few times. Dean chided himself for boring him, wishing he had something besides cars he could talk so easily about - again that lack of education coming back to haunt him. He imagined Balthazar having all kinds of interesting worldly topics to talk about. And yet - he knew that Cas had never cared about all that stuff. That wasn't why they'd connected. It had always been easy with Cas, so why was he so nervous now? Maybe it was because Dean was afraid now that Cas had a chance to see the world beyond him, he'd want something more.
Dean nodded….“Counted breaths….Stepped outside...Counted 5 things I could see that I wouldn’t see over there.”
, not past him, or into some void. The man opposite him was different for sure, but a person again, not a shell. Still beautiful. Still Dean Winchester.
He felt the hot sting of a hand across his face, his ass hitting the floor before he realized what happened. He brought his hands up defensively but his father had already moved on towards Darlene, shouting angrily.
Sam let Dean nurse the warm cup for a while, sipping and bringing his fingers, warmed by the mug up to press on his tired eyes. It was a comforting habit Dean had since they were teenagers, waking up in cold and drafty apartments. Dean winced as he touched his right eye.
Cas thought now about Dean. Dean had always been brash and impetuous, like the night he first followed Cas home and practically kidnapped him into a date, or the way he arrogantly taunted his competition before each race. He was unstoppable in everything he pursued.
“No.” Dean turned and smiled, leaning into him, pressing their foreheads together. “That would ruin the surprise, Cas.” Dean ducked in, quickly stealing a kiss from Cas’s lips before securing the bike and taking the backpack from him. “My turn to carry this now.”
“Who says it's for you? I been trying for years to get Mildred to run away with me and I figured now's my chance.”
a well-kept home, but anyone could have lived here. There was nothing uniquely 'Cas' within these walls. The stylishly decorated apartment left him empty inside.
“And Cas…..” Dean hesitated, “I have no right to ask...but,” Dean looked him in the eyes, there was no easy way to ask. He of all people didn't want to make Cas feel judged, not after the things Dean had done to himself - but the image of Cas unconscious - half dead and forgotten on the floor of some shithole apartment had been haunting him since that day at the hospital.
“Did you boys start the party without me?” came a thick Louisiana drawl as a hand clapped to Dean’s shoulder.
Cas whispered, rough in Dean’s ear, his commanding voice recovered, but a smile on his lips as he yanked Dean’s underwear back up to cover his soaking cock and catch the last of his leaking come.
Dean felt the very least he owed Cas now, was to not complicate his life any further. So he was trying, and maybe he was even getting better at trying to build back a life for himself. Pushing away the darkness the war left inside him, moment by moment. A dinner with Sam, a song with Jess, a slice of pie and coffee with Fred and Mildred, a conversation with Bobby while his hands moved expertly over metal and grease to fix what was broken. These and other moments, each like a rung on a ladder. Dean used them to climb out of his darkness and closer to the world everyone else seemed to be living in - closer to the person he used to be.
“Oh God Cas!” Dean thrust into him hard with one last stroke before spilling into him. He gasped as Cas’s muscles still tensing from orgasm, pulled more and more pleasure from Dean, milking his cock, until he collapsed, boneless against him.
He found a bench and sat, sheltered in a little nook between some trees and a great column. He thought about the night he first met Cas, about the years they lived together...all of the dreams they shared. Cas had been the whimsical one, always imagining hopes and dreams for their future. Dean would listen, and smile captivated by him. He’d look Cas in the eyes and promise him the world and more, fully believing he’d find a way to deliver. He’d given up...but did he really? Maybe it wasn’t that he’d given up so much as that he’d lost his way. And if you are lost, and find the path again…can you forgive yourself for giving up and pick up where you left off? Dean’s head was swirling with questions and possibilities, it was hard to focus in on any single one.
“If you ever feel like you need to...you know, go out with Meg - do that shit...you can call me first...if you want that is...and we can talk.”
Mildred cried but was also happy for him because she knew how much he missed his brother. She made him promise to visit and come up for dinner at least once every couple of months and Dean agreed, hugging her. He could never pass up her pie forever he teased.
“I’m not afraid.” Dean crossed his arms, his jaw clenched as he studied the wastepaper basket on the floor near Bobby’s desk.
He felt his hand brush against Cas’s as they sat close. Why was he so frozen by the past? Why couldn’t he just take Cas’s hand? He wanted so desperately to do that but he lacked the courage. He’d never lacked courage in that regard before.
Was it his present self that younger Dean sensed? Could time work like that? Was this moment the shadow that passed over him that day? Dean brought his hands to his head to rub away the confusion. His thoughts were only lucid now in waves, like the waves on the shore, the rest were bits of delusion and dream….the end gathering like the tide coming in. In those brief clear moments it hurt to think. It hurt to feel. Coming here was maybe a mistake, or maybe it was the punishment he deserved. Dean downed more pills.
Cas sighed. “I can’t be with Balthazar...I’ve known for a long time I should have gotten out. He was a good friend to me, and he wanted more, but I never did feel the same way he did.” He looked away from her adding, “But what if it's the best I can do? What if….what if I just end up alone?” Cas shook his head, “I told you it's pathetic.”
“I hit my head,” he explained. “I need a cup of water please, and a cup of ice. Quickly please!” Cas grabbed some napkins and pressed hard near his temple where the blood was dripping, glancing back at the car as she turned to grab cups and fill them. Dean hadn’t moved from his spot in the passenger's seat. He fished for his wallet to pay her.
“Hey -I’m leaving tomorrow and you can do whatever you want,” Dean jumped back on the bike “but tonight humor me.”
him if he’s queer over shakes and fries?” Amusement glinted in Cas’s eyes as he gave Dean a lopsided smile.
Since his phone call with Rufus, Dean still hadn’t figured out what he should do. The thought of doing the wrong thing and hurting Cas more paralyzed him. The thought that Cas may have once and for all written him off terrified him. The dream he’d had of Cas at the Palace of Fine Arts still held a kind of dark power over him, the memory of it a shadow over his shoulder.
When the credits rolled, they sat through them all - each unwilling to break the spell. Finally, the lights came up and Dean was shaken, as if from a dream. He stood and offered a hand to Cas, questioningly, “Stay with me for a bit longer?” he asked.
Dean pulled at his jacket as if to warm away the shivers. Cas eyed him curiously. It was unseasonably warm but you wouldn’t know it looking at Dean. Dean looked tired and cold. Best to get this over with so Dean could be on his way.
Cas had stupidly let Michael and his father dictate an end to his relationship with Rachel….excommunicating “the sodomite” as his brother called him, from the family. Well, Rachel was his family too, not just theirs. Cas was going to rectify that. He was taking back their relationship. Cas wasn’t sure if that counted as badass. Probably not, but it was at least a step forward, wasn’t it?
Dean tried to focus his eyes on the face that belonged to the voice in front of him. His brow furrowed.
Dean stared back for a moment confused, then choked on his own spit and erupted into a fit of laughter that had him shaking, tears breaking from his eyes.
“Are we gonna get a lot of candy?” Jenny’s tiny voice could just be heard asking from a distance, her small form nearly bending backward to look up at Cas.
Dean’s eyes relaxed, a broad smile blooming across his face. His gaze drifted suddenly past Cas, his expression falling into a look of disgust. Cas’s eyes widened, wondering what just changed.
Cas tried not to think of Dean but Dean was like the sound of birds in the outdoors or less pleasantly the feel of shoes that are too tight. Ever-present, especially when things in his mind stilled. He could occupy his mind to try to keep from noticing, but thoughts of Dean always crept back in. He wished he could go to Dean right now.
“Not this weekend.. gotta deal with something at the other shop this weekend for Bobby. Next weekend I mean.”
"I do know you," Cas chided. "You give everything to everyone around you and forget to take care of yourself."
Now, in the dark, alone, next to Cas, Dean allowed his emotions to break over the dam. Just a brief moment of release as he choked back a sob and let the tears flow covering his face with his hands.
“Then would you mind grabbing a soda for me?” She asked waving down at her wrapped ankle. “And seriously reconsider while you’re in there. You must have had a long drive...or ride...or whatever you do on a motorcycle.”
Cas nodded, his expression still unreadable even as his heart raced. It was understandable, he thought. He turned to glance again outside the window. But Balthazar could see his breath quicken in the rise and fall of his chest as he processed the news.
Cas turned to walk back to the house allowing the momentum to carry him forward, afraid if he looked back at Dean he would falter and broker some lesser deal.
His hands trembled as he held the photograph. Dean, bundled against the chill of November in his old Mackinaw coat, smiling at something in the distance. Cas had snapped it when he wasn’t looking.
“Cas, wait!” Dean grabbed his hand. He looked back at Sam and then to Cas as if torn, then walked Cas over towards the door.
“That’s … that’s fantastic...Congratulations man.” Dean said. He was simultaneously excited for Benny and disappointed for himself.
“Yeah well, I got in huge trouble for that and ended up cowering in my room when his father complained to mine about it. Wait...What?” Cas’s eyes narrowed, “When did you hate my guts?”
“Dean?” Cas squinted, looking bewildered, unable to reconcile Dean’s presence with his surroundings. Dean shouldn’t be here. Dean didn’t belong here. Why was he here? His gaze sharpened.
Dropping his book in favor of an old black and white mystery, he somehow managed to convince Cas to stay on the line. Dean wasn’t one for long phone calls - hated them in fact,  but this was different. This was the kind of flick he and Cas used to curl up together on the couch and watch. He'd seen it a million times...but if he closed his eyes, phone resting against his ear as Cas spoke, he could pretend everything was right again - could pretend his head was resting in Cas’s lap instead of on just an old pillow.
“Very funny,” Dean said unamused, stepping closer. He towered over the man. “Do you know where I can find Castiel Novak or Meg Masters?”
Cas shifted himself, turning his body around so that he could wrap his arms around Dean again, the slight stubble of his jaw now teasing along Dean’s cheek as his mouth, languid and open, caressed, and licked, and sucked gently along the space near Dean’s ear, toying with his earlobe, before releasing it and moving further down. Dean bared his neck to give Cas better access, humming with the pleasure of it, and still the music pulsed, it's fevered tempo transporting them to some ethereal plane.
. Balthazar had never seen any of the movies which made Cas a little happy because when something was new to someone else it always made him feel like he was seeing it for the first time. He was sure that they would laugh together a little now despite everything that had happened. It would take his mind off things.
There was a long pause until finally he heard “Goodnight Dean,” followed by Cas’s footsteps making their way down the hall to his bedroom.
This post is pretty raw, and originally I had planned to include a little more in this chapter but work has been kicking my ass and I wanted to post something this week. I often find myself going back a few days after posting and cleaning up or fixing or reworking paragraphs or phrases and will probably do this to this chapter as well, but overall the essence doesn't change. Hope you enjoy your week. Postings WILL likely be erratic now that fall is here but I won't abandon you, so if you are still reading I would suggest subscribing to make sure you know when a new chapter is posted.
“Oh..” it came out small and sad. He swallowed against the lump that was building in his tightening throat.
“Thank you. That’s okay though,” he said, biting down and willing the shivers away. He spared a smile for her as another troop of children ascended the lawn laughing. “I’ve never gotten to do this before,” Dean said, helping her dole out the candy. “It’s kind of nice.”
Dean laughed, that big happy jack-o-lantern like grin lighting his face. “I looked away for about a second and next thing I look over and he’s gone! Bolted so fast!” Dean shook his head smiling in memory as he looked out to the streets trying to catch a glimpse of them again.
Dean looked incredulous,  but then scanned the crowd again. Most people weren’t flagging but a few were visible on occasion.
Dean felt like the earth underneath him had shifted violently and he was sliding down a steep hill cluttered with shards of his failings, clutching at them, sharp and filthy - slicing his hands as he attempted to claw his way back - to urge his way closer to reconciliation with Cas - the ground on which he stood giving way like broken shale under his feet.
Dean realized he was staring, grinning ridiculously. Cas was still such a dramatic little bitch sometimes. Dean missed that. He sighed a laugh, fixing his eyes on the ground before looking at each of them one by one.
“Normally yes,” Crowley addressed the man then nodded towards Dean, “but I have something I have to take care of for my friend here. As you can see he’s in no shape to drive home.”
“Heh,” Sam shrugged his shoulders in an unexpected uncertain response and Dean snapped to attention, abandoning his focus on the shot he was about to take and turning his full attention to Sam.
Cas walked down to the curb taking in the glossy shine of the black Impala. He was sure Dean must have just cleaned and waxed it. It really did look sweet.
Cas, shaken by the surprise of seeing his brother, tried to get Phillipe, the waiter in the next section to switch the table with one of his. Castiel would owe him he promised. Philippe however pressed Cas for details he didn’t want to give and with the dining room short-staffed tonight Cas told him to forget it and determined to just be professional and pretend it was any other guest. If it had been Gabriel, the plan might have worked. But unfortunately for Cas, this was Michael.
Benny nodded, "Okay, good...well there's no magic spell that works all the time....And now?” he asked, hand rubbing Dean’s shoulder.
Dean followed Cas’s eyes as he took in the club. “Dance with me, Dean.” Cas said getting up, his voice low and commanding.
Dean stood as Cas got up to leave, pulling him into a hug after all - one that could have been to anyone else’s eyes, platonic. They stepped away. For a moment Cas seemed stuck, eyes flitting from Dean’s face to the ground near their feet, his lips parted as if hoping to summon something more. He swallowed it back down, looking up at Dean and giving a tremulous smile before turning to leave.
he’d taken care of his boy. How it felt afterward, to have Cas pull him close, wrapping Dean in his arms and looking up at him like he was going to keep him forever. Looking at Dean like he was the most beautiful, most desirable, most
“I mean, it would be nice to see you and Sam and Jess again. And you never met Balthazar. You were all such a part of my life. I’d like him to meet you.”
It was a mess, Dean thought, heartsick for them both as he got up to make a pot of coffee. He found himself waking up to a deep melancholy. The sadness he felt about Sam’s state colored every thought of him and Cas. If Sam, who had everything going for him couldn’t make things work, then how could a fuck up like him hope to make anything last with Cas?
Dean’s eyes welled and he choked back a sob. It was all suddenly surreal. The same place, a different time, and a world apart. Dean felt the ghost of his younger self and Cas still here on this beach. If he could punch through time and see them, himself and Cas, vivid, alive, innocent and untouched by the hell that would follow. He would like to take that in. Breathe in the sound of his own laughter one more time. Maybe they were there, his former self and Cas,..just beyond a veil, out of his reach and sight...something he could sense but not touch. Maybe he was already a ghost. Or maybe it was just that the drugs were already having an effect.
The conversation turned from human rights across the globe to the Iron Curtain, and nuclear proliferation. Jess told Sam she’s afraid to have kids with the arms race going on and Benny tried to assure her the Soviets would never launch because of Mutually Assured Destruction. It didn’t help.
“Ahhh...Love!” Gabriel drawled drifting in, empty glass in hand. “Aren’t these crazy kids adorable?” He mixed himself a gin and tonic.
Dean practically shoved him into the truck and drove it to the nearest ER. After a few tests a doctor came out to let Dean know that Bobby was going to be just fine.
“She’s not going anywhere Dean,” Bobby winked. “When the time comes, we’ll see what we can work out,” he said.
“I wear contacts sometimes now,” Cas told her ducking his head a little, his cheeks blooming under the scrutiny.
And if Dean had trouble meeting Cas’s eye this morning, that feeling would fade by the end of the day as the three of them watched old movies and Dean laughed as Cas tried to figure out the cosmic nuances of Young Frankenstein and Abbot and Costello. And if Dean started the day on the opposite side of the room from Cas, he would in time close the distance as Cas was...well Cas, and it only took a short while in his presence to feel at home again. And if Dean sat a little bit closer to Cas than he would anyone else, he would pretend not to notice. Sammy would pretend not to notice. Cas would pretend not to notice, but his heart would be filled with the warmth of Dean’s closeness just the same.
Cas sat silent in the passenger seat of the car as Balthazar drove him home from the hospital. Waiting at a traffic light, Balthazar tentatively reached for Castiel’s hand to hold in the space between them. Cas moved his hand politely to fit inside Balthazar’s.
“True though,” he smirked, brushing by Cas, pie in hand and into the next room. “It’s good to see you smile, kiddo.”
Sam is tired of watching Dean not owning up to his feelings for the angel, Castiel. In order to prove his theory right, Sam makes Dean read one of the most known fics to all of the Supernatural fandom: Twist and Shout. How will Dean react and how will this affect the relationship between him and Castiel?
After what seemed like an eternity, a doctor appeared. Balthazar stood as the man spoke to him in hushed tones. Dean tried to listen but his vision was shifting in strange ways.
Three days ago he tossed his dog tags and St. Michael medal into a gorge. Two days ago he sold his bike. This morning he sent most of the money home to Sam with a note that simply said “Goodbye Sammy. I know you’ll be alright.” The rest he used to pay the cab fare from the last town he stayed in to the shore. It took bribing the driver a fifty upfront, but a guaranteed fare was a fare so he agreed.  Dean didn’t want to be found, just forgotten. Soon he would sleep. He would finally have peace again. The pills and bottle he had in his pack from the last dive of a town he had hit would ensure it. Up front the driver changed the station, struggling to find a channel, settling on whatever came over clearly. Mick Jagger sang through a ghost of static.
Cas tried hard not to put too much stock in the words Dean had spoken. He had seen many times firsthand how delirium could warp one's senses and emotions, so as much as Dean’s declaration of love sang to his heart he was afraid to let himself believe.
“We were seventeen. Will was everything to me. He was funny and sweet and just the best brother." She smiled sadly, letting out a little laugh. "I adored him.” Hannah inhaled, her voice tight as she continued.
Men like him weren’t legally entitled to information about their partners. Dean’s panic deepened as he understood what Missouri clearly had. Balthazar was
If on the odd chance Dean wanted to start fresh, where would this leave them? Cas decided he’d worry about that when and if he ever heard from Dean. It hurt to keep wondering about Dean. He busied himself with looking through the university acceptance packet instead and then called Charlie.
“Thanks.” Dean swallowed at the tight feeling in his throat as he glanced around the circle, nodding his thanks as several of the guys wished him well.
“Not that I could tell. Didn’t seem so. He told me to tell you he hopes everything’s okay, that's all.”
“Bullshit Dean!” Cas said desperately, looking at him now. “You’re not broken! You’ve never been broken. It was just a
The money at the club was so much better than Cas had expected. Not the hourly pay of course, but the tips left by bluebloods out to impress their friends and clientele.
Tentatively Dean stepped nearer and Cas, unmoving, let him. They were close. Too close, Dean thought, for this to be mistaken for anything other than what it was, but still Cas stood there and made no move to back away. Dean took a breath, steeling himself for something - rejection or acceptance. He wondered which would break him more - except really he already knew the answer.
Cas wasn’t a central figure in Dean’s life anymore.  As much as he would like to maybe be just a satellite in that world if only to occasionally delight in Dean’s orbit, everything he felt sitting next to Dean now warned him that he couldn’t stand the price of being so close, without being able to touch and hold and kiss and love him again.
“Tips are good so far.” Cas continued. “I switched some of my shifts at the warehouse to make sure I could get a few days in with the business lunch crowd. Lots of corporate types trying to impress their clients or bosses, throwing money around.”
Seeing Dean now, it was more than reconnecting -more than “catching up” or giving “closure.” They had done those things already. So what was this exactly? Did Dean even know? Cas suddenly felt this was a reckless act, meeting Dean like this, alone, without the buffer of Rachel or Jess. How stupid could he be, thinking he could handle being “friends” with a force so raw and unbridled as Dean Winchester?”
Cas thrummed inside at the sight of him, but whether his body was telling him to fall into Dean’s arms or shove him back on the bike and run in the other direction Cas couldn’t quite make up his mind. He knew he should hear Dean out -
Thank you to those who've left comments and kudos! After a bunch of new subscribers popped up last week I am reminded to say if you are enjoying this so far don't forget to subscribe! I am really thankful to all of you who are still reading!
Cas came around to the passenger side, opening the door and taking his hand. Dean blindly followed Cas through the side door and up the stairs to his apartment.
“You think you can manipulate my kids to get to me? That boy may be stupid but I sure as hell aint.” John took a step towards her, raising his hand.
Lastly, in my head Hannah's twin brother looks like Hannah's male vessel from the show, with that same sweetness and same kind eyes. I think if he had lived and met Cas through Hannah, Will would have fallen head over heels in love with him. Maybe that would be nice to explore in another universe. In this universe, Cas and Dean are it for each other!
“Castiel isn’t causing your flashbacks if that’s what you’re worried about Dean,” Rufus said with a tone of certainty when he was done.
“Hannah, this is Dean. Dean, Hannah,” he said quickly and flatly, not daring to look at either of them.
Cas knew he shouldn’t care, he should relax about it. No one was paying them the least bit of attention. That wasn’t why he was so nervous.
“Dean, he was right. Sounds like he’s gonna make a great doctor, this Castiel of yours. Look, I know you might not feel okay. Sometimes you’re not going to feel okay, but you know more now than you did years ago when we first met don’t you? You knew to call me. You’ve got me anytime you need me Dean. You’ve got Benny, and Fred, you’ve got your family.”
“I like it,” Cas said. “It's bittersweet. There’s a whole history in this song you know - back to the 50’s.” It put Cas in a nostalgic mood, bringing him back to an earlier time in his life. Sure there was a lot of bad shit going on but he was younger then and maybe more hopeful too.
Dean stood looking at himself in the bathroom mirror, hating the thing he saw staring back. His hands were still trembling slightly after all of this time. He was so ashamed.
It had taken a lot to be able to afford that little trip. Dean had insisted Cas forget his library job so he could concentrate on his classes. Cas studied, Dean hustled - the bar, the pool hall, the auto shop, the racing circuit. Cas had been reluctant to let him at first, but Dean had taken pride in providing for them both….in making
Dean could picture it. Picture Andrea pulling Benny over and making him sit with her there. It was a nice image actually. He hoped they would be happy. He could picture the green grass and fireflies of the quiet street in the spring and summer. The houses nicely spaced with big yards, most of them with old established trees and wooded borders between the homes.
“You okay?” Dean asked almost immediately, looking a little concerned and taking Cas’s hand, causing him to blush wondering if somehow his thoughts were written all over his face.
Anyway, I hope you enjoy this chapter! I think there will be one more chapter before the end of the weekend.
“When I left you, you were suddenly having to deal with Sam and how sad he is. That couldn’t have been easy for you Dean.”
“Dammit Sam!” Dean’s glare snapped back up to his brother. “Why do you always ask if I want to talk about something and then ignore me when I say I don’t?”
He looked at the clock wondering what Cas might be doing right now. He’d always like to sleep in on Sundays and
“It’s fine Balthazar,” Cas said, his face turned toward the wall. It wasn’t though. Nothing was fine. They both knew it. “Just please, leave me tonight.”
Sam seemed to suddenly snap out of it, whatever ‘it’ was. “Yeah Dean! I just wish you’d ask the guy out already and put us all out of our misery! Will you?”
“I’m fine, No headache, no flashing lights. Anyway, seems I’m a hell of a lot better than you at the moment.”
“Still can’t take a compliment can you Cas,” Dean said softly, sweeping his fingers gently across Cas’s cheek. “How are we ever gonna remedy that?”
The next day Balthazar went to work and Cas shopped for groceries. He busied himself with as many domestic chores as he could in order to pass the time and checked his closet for some decent work clothes. The Emporium mentioned that he would have an employee discount on anything he bought for work so Cas took a bus downtown to grab some new things. He came home, cleaned a little, and cooked a dinner of pasta with garlic pesto, grilled chicken and tomatoes. Cas chilled a bottle of white wine and had everything set and ready for when Balthazar got home.
The ride in the taxi was quiet until Dean broke the silence. “I had a really nice time. If you hadn’t called, I’d be passed out in front of the TV in Bobby’s apartment and I’d have missed all this.”
What exactly were he and Dean to each other now? They’d had what Cas thought was an amazing date, and then a hot bout of whatever the hell that was in the back of Dean’s car, but were they a couple again?
being honest he’d tell Benny that he was a fucking mess -  how lately most days he felt like he was stuck in a blizzard, shoveling and shoveling to exhaustion just to keep his head above it, just to keep from being crushed and suffocated by an avalanche of thoughts and emotions and fucking regrets. He didn’t want to talk about his goddamn feelings about fucking up the best thing he’d ever had in his life.
One thing that was different about this apartment from the others he’d lived in throughout his life was the quiet. The building was full of tenants but somehow the walls and floors kept the noise of other lives out. It was sometimes possible for Dean to go an entire day without hearing another soul in the building. No doubt most tenants would see this as a pro rather than a con, but Dean, having grown up in shitty noisy spaces with thin walls, had spells where he found the silence oppressive. He sometimes went into the hall, walking down the stairs or even outside just long enough to run into someone so he could nod hello, and get a response, assuring Dean he wasn't the only one left in the world. It wasn't always like this - when Dean came home from work most days his apartment felt like a welcoming haven. But sometimes, there were stretches of days when it felt like a silent prison.
“Michael always invites me to his family’s house. I am sure I will get an invitation again but I am so angry about what he did to you that I’m not going. I'm just sorry about not seeing the kids. I love being an aunt. Do you think he will poison their minds against me?"
Crowley nodded thoughtfully, grabbing the bottle of Jack. “Old Number Seven.” he said pouring a shot, “I know it’s fucking blasphemy where I come from but I prefer the rawness of it now to anything else.”
Within ten minutes of the call Dean was racing towards San Francisco, praying to a god he had long since stopped believing in.
“Get that little lost puppy look off your face. The Cas I remember from high school was a badass who would fight to give everything he could to the people he cared about. Time you fought for yourself for once!”
“False alarm,” Gabriel said, bringing in an enormous floral arrangement and setting it on the table.
“I think I just need to talk to my brother,” he said, giving a reassuring smile that he didn’t actually feel. Bobby seemed to accept that, but worry still shone in his eyes.
Dean, are the unconquered sun.” Benny turned back to the others as he said “All of you are the unconquered sun. Just for god’s sake, don’t give up - and
He knew his voice had an edge to it. It couldn’t be helped. He was back to facing the cushions but heard Cas get up from the chair behind him.
Dean shifted his pointer finger just slightly instead, first as if it might just be an accidental twitch that left him brushing against Cas...then over to touch Cas’s own, sneaking it across some invisible boundary line, as if the trespass of a single finger somehow left Dean less emotionally vulnerable than the grip of an entire hand.
Dean had an early shift at the garage. He was back home around 4 PM and was taking extra time in the shower, enjoying the warmth of the spray as it pounded against his back and shoulders. Showers always felt better at this time of day, when there were fewer tenants home to strain the limited hot water supply. He could hear the phone ringing in the next room but ignored it. Whoever it was could call back.
“That's a promise,” Dean laughed, landing one last soft, aching kiss on Cas’s lips. “Let me get you your reminder.”
The truth, he was starting to realize, was that he found himself on the path of least resistance because he simply failed to choose for himself.
already been.” Cas told Dean, “Wait here though while I call us a cab.” Cas mentioned he had seen a payphone near the sandwich truck around the corner. Dean should finish his beer and he’d be right back.
“It looks like a goddamn disco in here!” Bobby said when Dean finally got him to admit that something was wrong.
“I’m sorry," he cleared his throat as Cas continued to glare. "You can pick up your final check next Friday.”
Dean swallowed, looking down at his hands before deciding finally. “Yeah...yeah,” The decision finally made, Dean found he couldn’t suppress the ridiculous smile that broke over him. “I just...I need to figure out how I’m gonna woo his sweet ass back.”
Dean swallowed, that uncertain feeling coming back, “I wanna share everything with you Cas. My whole life. You’ll see. I really mean it. Never loved anyone before. I mean - Sammy doesn’t count ‘cause that’s different.”
Dean’s whole body thrummed, warm and electric as Cas laid his head back down against Dean’s shoulder, turning his attention back to the screen, and settling in with a contented hum. Dean kissed into his hair, bringing his hand up to smooth a few wavy, almond-scented locks away from Cas’s forehead.
“That’s... actually really romantic,” Cas said, as if he still couldn’t quite believe his eyes. It had been three weeks since the party, and Dean could tell Cas was still trying to reconcile the sharp as a knife’s edge juvenile offender Dean’s reputation made him out to be, with the tender, gentle lover Dean wanted to be for Cas.
“Yeah, right! I still remember how you took on that dirtbag at school for calling me a dyke and tripping me down the bleachers. You kicked his ass...To me that was pretty badass Cas! And that was back when I hated your guts too!”
Cas hadn’t been looking for anything but to blow off steam with friends the night of the Delta party. He especially hadn’t counted on receiving any attention from Dean. In fact, he’d bolted nervously from the scene when Dean, with his reputation for racing, sex, and leather jackets, turned his head and winked at him from across the room.
backyard, and as the twilight came on they would listen to the crickets and cicadas chirping. Cas loved the sound of cicadas which he always said sounded like summer. Then Dean would take Cas by the hand, leading him back inside, into their
“Me too….It’s quiet, and calm, well except for the kids downstairs sometimes,” he smiled.  “But they’re good kids. Aren’t you tired from driving?”
“Balthazar...but he gave the name Novak so that doesn’t help,” Sam was thinking out loud over the phone. “That could be the guy Cas was with when I saw him last.”
“So I have a client to meet at ten tomorrow morning but Jess is off. I’m sure she can help you at the university library if you meet her there. If nothing turns up by the end of work I can meet you there to help.”
“And you too of course,” Rachel smiled. “I’ve heard so much about you. It’s nice to finally meet you.”
“You ready Ribbons?” Dean deadpanned, only holding it a second before he again burst into laughter so strong his sides hurt, earning him what he would ordinarily (now only outside of Jess’s presence of course) refer to as Sam’s “bitchface.”
Cas swallowed, whatever he’d been about to say abandoned, asking, “When can we see each other again?” instead.
As Dean’s words registered, Cas's eyes widened. He took a breath as if realizing he’d been caught in a spell. Cas abruptly straightened up, blinking away the emotion as he fought to recover himself.
“The timing of everything really sucks….but yeah...I guess I will.” Dean sighed. “Really wanna be there for you too though.”
Dean was sleeping late on Sunday morning when the phone rang.  It was 9:00 am. Too early for Dean to feel like he’d gotten his Sunday’s worth of sleep, but too late to avoid a headache from the lack of caffeine his body demanded of him every morning by seven.
Some of you may have caught a not-so-subtle reference to the song "Old Number Seven" by The Devil Makes Three. I first learned about this song in a fic called Crossing Lines by the AMAZING sometimeswelose and when writing the bar scene with Crowley couldn't resist. The fic is part of a two part series and the two taken together, while sad in parts are warm and rich and heart nourishing in others and I honestly can't think of a better ending for our canon Dean, Cas and Sam. Don't be afraid! It is wonderful, and the ending they deserved. Here is a link to that fic and also to the song, which is a very Dean Winchester song!
Benny had been finishing his degree and certification for a few years now, working and taking classes part-time. When he last saw Dean he had just interviewed for a position as a school social worker.
The only person he had ever confided all of this to was Cas. Sammy of course remembered Darlene, but Sam never found out how Dean had gotten the money for groceries - Dean wanted to keep it that way - but Cas knew.
The man leaned down sneering into Dean’s face, clutching a fistful of Dean’s shirt to pull him close, speaking through clenched teeth.
Cas was already up and gone when Balthazar woke, but a note on the guest room door told him he had to stop in at work but he'd be home this afternoon and they would talk. All the better. It gave Balthazar time to steel himself -  to come to terms with it before he had to talk face to face.
A heavy sigh rattled from Dean’s chest and he nuzzled his head into the crook of Cas’s neck. After a moment Cas pulled away to flash a smile at Dean. He wanted so badly to kiss him properly, to lift the shirt over his head and arms and press Dean back into the cushions or better yet, take Dean to his bed, letting his hands and fingers roam along the firm muscles of his chest and arms, laying kisses along the path from Dean’s breastbone to his navel and beyond. But Dean needed to rest and the last thing Cas needed was to end up sick like Dean and have to postpone whatever it was he had in mind by “starting over.”
“Jesus.” Dean said. He had heard stories of the men drifting down helplessly amidst the cutting artillery. Some watching helplessly, unable to control their slow descent, awaiting their inevitable fate as their fellows hung up on steeples or rooftops were shredded by German machine guns.
“So how did you two meet?” Balthazar asked Dean, clearly assuming that he and Benny were “together,”
Cas sighed. Michael was nothing if not vindictive, he wouldn’t put anything past his eldest brother now.
“Hey, I told you if you were drowning I’d send in a lifeboat.” Benny said smiling. Benny glanced at Dean, suddenly serious. “The way you make music, the way your fingers move on that guitar, the way it channels your emotions. That’s your lifeboat Dean. Use that.”
Dean hadn't been thinking straight back then, thought he was doing what was best for Cas at the time, but he was starting to understand the gravity of what he did by leaving Cas with no word, no answers, nothing but endless ‘what ifs?’ What had he been doing these last months if not picking at old wounds and then running away?
Cas took a moment to get over the surprise of his brother's visit. Then nodded, “I appreciate that Gabriel.”
“Raincheck?” Dean asked with a lopsided smile, the regret evident in his knitted brow, his eyes flitting from Rachel to Jess but settling on Cas.
They carried the mugs and plates of toast back to the coffee table. Dean taking up his place on the couch and Cas in the adjacent chair as before. Afternoon soaps were on the TV now. Cas casually left one on as “background noise,” knowing that Dean would never admit to how much he secretly enjoyed it.
“Now we were just telling Dean that he has to bring you right up here to meet us as soon as he can. You’ll come won’t you?”
Dean found himself nodding despite the fact that Sam couldn’t see him. “Hey Sammy, one more thing. Can you look up Novak in the Sacramento phone book?”
As soon as the door closed Cas sighed. It all felt unreal. Like he was in some dream state that dulled his senses. He didn’t know what to do. Cas finished his coffee, showered, and left for work. To say he was preoccupied all day was an understatement.
Cas looked around the living room where he and Hanna had spent the evening hours watching game shows, Sonny and Cher, and now a movie. One network was showing
Dean turned his head back to where Cas went to the bar just in time to see him kissing Balthazar as he gripped Cas’s head with both hands, wildly running his fingers through his hair. Both of them turned back to the bar to take a shot of something.
Mildred momentarily shed her feelings of fear and helplessness in favor of an affectionate spousal irritation, as if her husband's stubbornness was his biggest problem. “Apparently the darn fool was having pains in the night and didn’t say anything. He fell down the stairs this morning, and hurt his hip and back on the way down. Doctor says it was a heart attack but they’ve been running tests all day.” She fought to bring the quiver in her lip under control.
Ever since they reconnected Gabriel seemed to have loosened up about the fact that his brother preferred men. Now he was being a teasing asshole older brother in the best way he knew how. Little did he know that Cas
Dean saw movement in his periphery just in time to block a punch from the guy with the tattoos. It cost him though, because in doing so he had to turn, leaving his back unguarded.
The familiar form of the back of Dean’s head, someone Dean’s height, navy blue jacket, moving swiftly to cross the road.
They ate lunch on a bench in a shady part of a small park. A stream made a soft trickling sound behind them - the light sound of children’s laughter in the distance as a boy blew out the candles on a cake at a birthday picnic.
Dean spilt his coffee as he stood straight up stopping himself from running to the desk. This couldn’t be real.
Cas nodded and finished his own as Dean laid back and closed his eyes again. Cas brought the dishes to the sink and cleaned them quickly.
Crowley scowled. “Can’t. Have to take care of a few things. My place, my rules boys. We’ll reopen nine thirty.”
Cas held his breath as Dean leaned in, ever so slightly, adjusting the cant of his head as he lowered his eyes to Cas’s lips. Cas let his eyes flutter shut, trusting his lips now to find their way home to Dean…
Cas looked over and caught Dean’s eye, and Dean was certain he didn’t imagine the brief smirk on Cas’s lips. Bad Company indeed, Dean thought.
“It’s adorable.” Cas countered, smiling as he took it looking it over. He looked back to Dean, his blue eyes met Dean’s green ones. “And sweet...and nice to know you thought of me.”
“I thought I was better! I thought….” Rufus heard the sigh on the other end of the line. He waited patiently for Dean. “I thought I could be good for him again - that we could go back to the way things were.  But I feel like it’s just gonna keep happening now when I’m with him Rufus.” Dean told Rufus all about how in his words he’d ‘lost his mind again.’ How he’d drank himself into a stupor. It was clear Dean was in a panic that he would ‘lose it’ in front of Cas. “It’s like I’m back to square one.”
“I'm managing for now, thanks. Hey Rachel can I call you tomorrow? I have to do a few things and it will give me time to think.”
Dean eased Cas out of his trench coat and jacket throwing them on a nearby chair as Cas worked on the buttons of his torn shirt revealing a bruised and still somewhat bloody gash in his side. The wound had stopped bleeding but still looked raw and angry, crusted with blood. Dean ran to the sink, wetting a cloth in warm water.
Cas nodded, almost as an afterthought he pulled the tie off his arm and dropped it, following as Dean headed for the door.
He knew the plan was to drive somewhere so Dean could brag about his ‘girlfriend’ with the 2-speed automatic gearbox with rear-wheel drive and 275-horsepower, but he invited Dean in first so he could grab a drink and ‘hit the head’ after his drive.
Even after Jessica offered to give him Cas’s new number Dean had been too afraid of his own neediness to take it, too stubbornly insecure to call. He’d fucked up Cas’s life royally once...twice if you counted his breakup with Balthazar. Cas was making a fresh start. He had Dean’s number. If he had wanted to call he’d have called.  As much as it hurt to stay away, Dean wasn’t about to barge back in unless invited. Dean realized he wasn’t above begging if he thought it would do any good, but he didn’t.
“Just get better Dean,” he repeated, his hand going to the back of Dean’s head so he could pull him in to chastely kiss the hair along his temple again. His eyes flicked down to Dean’s body and he added, “Jesus you look so good in my clothes.”
“All good things come to an end Cassie,” he looked up darkly. “You and I are living proof of that, no?”
“Enjoy your 5-star breakfast. Mr. Winchester” he said turning and walking to the door as an attendant brought in a tray of food, “I’ll be back to talk later.”
“I lost my job at the club last night because my brother can’t accept that I’m gay. He has a lot of pull in certain social circles around here. He probably told you I was unfit to be around families. That’s what he told my boss at the club.”
Anyway! I hope you enjoyed this chapter. It was a lot of reading editing and writing in the wee hours of the mornings this week but I got it done after all! Let me know what you think in the comments!
Dean moved in closer, putting his arm around her and rubbing up and down her arm to comfort her. She laid her head against his shoulder and closed her eyes. Dean allowed his own eyes to close and forced himself to breathe more deeply than he had been.
Dean passed a worried look to Sam and back to Cas  “Let’s get you out of those clothes and we’ll take care of them our way tonight. Don’t waste your grace on this.”
Every time Dean sat by the phone and pulled out the number he froze. What would he say? What if it wasn’t even Cas’s place? How do you just pick up and call someone you totally abandoned? What if calling made whatever situation Cas was in worse?
Dean sighed, starting up the engine on his bike, looking now at Balthazar he added, “Be good to him...or I promise you I’ll come back here and fuck you up.”
Undeterred, Dean told Cas excitedly about the 67 Impala, as they hopped on the Powell -Hyde line back towards Union Square. Dean described the sad state “she” was in when Bobby found her. The tension between them was gone as Cas relaxed and attentively listened. Cas could care less about cars, but he smiled and felt happy seeing Dean practically glow as he detailed the work he was lovingly putting in to restore “her” beauty.
Dean, was now simultaneously totally relieved and totally aroused at the thought that Cas had been thinking about him in that way. Truth be told he had had plenty of thoughts of his own about taking this angel to a different kind of heaven and exactly how he would do it. Emboldened, he took a step closer, his hand resting behind Castiel’s neck, gently weaving his fingers into the dark soft tresses there.
“Thank you Dean.” Cas offered his hand to shake. Dean, for his part, considered pulling Cas in for a hug, thought better of it, opting for the antiseptic handshake.
“That was a one-off,” Dean chuckled. “First and last time for that. You saw how Jess and Benny pushed me into it.”
“Are you hungry?” Dean asked, shouting slightly to be heard above the loud music and chatter from neighboring tables that had started to fill in around them.
Inias nodded, “Believe it or not, that might even be the trickier part of his recovery. He ruptured a disc in his lower back and he's going to need a hip replacement. It’s going to take a delicate balance of rest and physical therapy.” He turned to Mildred again, “Your husband will likely need to use a wheelchair for the first few weeks.”
The world around them was at peace. Birds singing in the distance, a soft warm breeze blowing the scent of pines down from the mountain, the sound of a gentle stream nearby. It was perfect. The world was at peace but not Dean. Dean was damn near terrified.
Dean was still beautiful beyond words but tiredness clung to him. Cas knew instinctively he’d never stop atoning for imagined sins. There was a caution now in Dean’s eyes that had never been there before the war.
They finished their drinks and Cas grabbed a small cooler for the car. Not knowing where they could get something for lunch (and now that he was down to one job) Cas had packed sandwiches and drinks for them both.
He’d show Cas he could atone for having failed him. Dean would be gentle and patient, for both their sakes.
“Yeah! Hey man, that sounds amazing. I’m really happy for you two... I promised Fred and Mildred I’d be there at the end of the month for dinner so If you need any help moving in let me know.”
Cas chuckled. “I didn’t know we were fighting,” the corner of his mouth lifted. “But yeah okay, truce,” His eyes gleamed. “Should we turn this off and put on some music?”
He got up and went to the kitchen to wash some of the dishes that had accumulated since he woke up that morning. The window over the sink looked out onto the backyard of the home. His landlady’s kids were playing outside. Tommy, age seven, laid down on the grass and rolled himself down the hill while five-year-old Jenny chased a cabbage moth around the garden.
“Hell, take a look at the table in the right corner of the room second from the back. Don’t make it look obvious.”
“And if our congressman blocks him I will vote for whoever challenges him the next time,” Cas continued, cutting Dean off.
“You and I both know Cas is better off without me Bobby. He sure as shit knows it too. He’s moved on.”
Dean let out some of the pent-up tension with a breath. He looked away, struggling again to piece things together. Parts of his day with Cas were a blur but other parts were painfully fresh and clear in his memory. He had a vague memory of pouring out some emotional shit to Crowley. Some guys, one with a hat, another tall. He remembered being shoved. He remembered being called a
About an hour after taking his first drink Dean lost count of how much whiskey he’d tipped back, but if the way the room kept spinning every time he turned his head was any indication it was a lot.
“Good!” Fred nodded, ignoring the tremor in Dean’s voice the way he knew Dean would want him to. “Bout time. Get Mildred home would you? Let a tired old man get some sleep,” he winked.
He stepped back in front of the mirrors to fix his hair, attempting to bring some of the rebellious tufts into an ordered arrangement and somehow managing to make an even greater mess of it before finally giving up.
“Thank you Cas. These feel kind of gross,” he said, grabbing at his ripening tee shirt, damp in places from sweat.
Since Dean moved back he and Sam had become closer than ever. They had made a habit of having family dinners at least once or twice a week and almost always, Dean would play on Jess’s guitar, or even sometimes, bring his own over and they would play together. Just messing around on it really - but it was something to pass the time together, maybe the influence of his time with Garth. Sam made the mistake of telling them once he wished he knew how to play an instrument so he could join in. Dean smirked. The next dinner Dean showed up with a tambourine complete with flowers painted on the skin and about 20 frilly, 2 foot long ribbons hanging from the side.
Dean was excited to move home to Sam, but at the same time fearful. Valens had become a haven for him. He tried to conceal the emotion that welled inside him. He couldn’t remember when he had become so fucking soft.
to be with him as more than friends. Now the ball was in Dean’s court and there was some relief in that. He thought about calling Rachel back but it was after 10 now and although she was probably up still he knew she had work tomorrow and didn’t want to run the risk of waking her. Besides, he wasn’t sure he wanted to unpack any of this yet with anyone. His stomach was churning from nerves and he went to pour himself a drink. He saw the note and the box on the kitchen counter.
When I first wrote this I remember listening to Broken by Isak Danielson and getting strong sadness vibes for both Cas and Dean. When getting this ready to post I looked up the song again and a SPN vid edit with Dean. Oh wow - check it out if that's your thing (link in end notes). I'm sorry to take you through what Dean is going through, but if it makes you feel any better, I wrote a future chapter today that was so tooth rottingly sweet I need to schedule a dentist appointment. It's like 'fall in a swirling vat of cotton candy'- sweet. There is at least another roughish one after this before things turn brighter.
I remember how lost you were after the war. It scared me so much to see you like that. Now when I see you I can see that you’ve built a new life for yourself. You are so strong Dean, and I am so proud of you.
Cas put the car in drive and turned the radio to a soft rock station, singing along to himself as he drove home alone, yet somehow feeling like Dean was still right beside him. He glanced at the stuffed bear sitting next to him and laughed, the happiness he felt from this night overtaking all his other feelings. He didn’t ever want to come down from this.
“Hey!” A voice rang distantly in Dean’s ear from his right. “Three more!” Further down, a man in a red baseball cap slammed down an empty bottle. He glanced at Dean and then back to the man in front of Dean with a pinched-nosed glare.
“You got the Price is Right here?” Dean asked hopefully. His face was drained of color and he looked exhausted, but he was speaking more clearly.
He thought about grabbing the children by the hand and just walking through someone’s backyard to break through into the next development, but dismissed the idea of prolonging the night as ridiculous. Little Jenny was already now on her last legs anyway. Cas resorted to carrying her when she sat down on the curb crying that she was too tired and wanted her candy “Now!” It was only about six o’clock and none of them had eaten dinner, but Cas was pretty sure there shouldn’t be rules about such things on a holiday so he carefully checked a Mr. Goodbar before giving it to her as Tommy ran back from the final house, jack-o-lantern bucket filled to overflowing with candy.
They shared a bucket of popcorn and two drinks at a price Dean realized they could never have easily afforded back when Cas was in school, and Dean would brazenly sneak in cheap beers for them, Cas always hiding a stash of store-bought candy in his jacket for Dean.
Later that day Cas walked to the nearest mailbox. Clutching the letter in his hand, he let it hover for just a moment, before letting go, dropping it in and releasing the door.
“How have you been Cas?” Dean whispered, looking from Cas’s arm, where the ghost of a track mark showed on his pale skin, to his face. Cas blushed and pulled down his sleeve looking away. “I’m fine Dean.” he said, his voice suddenly firm and tense.
Dean didn’t seem to be hearing anything. His head was in his hands now as he hunched in the seat, palms over his eyes, fingers grabbing at his own hair. He looked like he was struggling to catch his breath.
He struggled to control his emotions and added more softly, “Dean, go get some rest. I promise you we’ll talk tomorrow.”
Next to him, Hannah let out a soft whistle. “You guys are gonna need some time to talk I think.” She started to grab at her crutches. “Jenny...Tommy Come with me, she said as she struggled to stand.”
and selfless and Dean couldn’t remember all of the words to that verse he’d once heard as a child, but he was pretty sure if you looked up the word ‘Love’ in the dictionary Cas’s picture would be there. Dean rubbed a frustrated hand over his forehead. He knew it didn’t help to beat himself up over it now.
