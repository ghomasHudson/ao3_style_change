“It’s not my gun. It’s a gun, one I stole and hid in your evidence lock-up. Now I need it back. We had a deal, Dean.”
“No.” Cas snarled, “Those sounds belong to me; want to hear every one of your sweet little moans. Want to know how much you want me.” Before he knew it Cas was taking the full length of his cock back into his mouth and sucking like his life depended on it. This time Dean let the sounds fall freely from his lips as he focused his energy on not snapping his hip forward, arms straining with the effort of keeping them in place.
By the time he was home, though, he felt strangely empty. Like his bed was too big and his apartment too quiet. Which was ridiculous. Cas hadn’t ever been here before, his apartment hadn’t changed, so why did he suddenly feel so alone? He started to walk to the washroom but stopped, turning instead to his bed. Somehow the thought of cleaning himself off made him feel worse, like if he washed away the last of Cas then he’d really be alone.
Huh, he thought, that was new. The other man had never been so bold with his touches, always too scared to act without permission. He liked this side of Dean. It was never a question that he was a brave, capable man, but he’d yet to let much of that come through into their arrangement. This was nice, though, and Castiel found himself leaning into the touch, wanting to encourage this new boldness.
“You can’t just cut me out of this investigation! I’m the closest thing you have to an expert on Cas—tiel.”
Castiel schooled his features, hyper aware of how he was expected to react. This was something he could manage; perhaps the other man’s behavior was not what he’d anticipated, but he’d spent months carefully preparing his own performance.
Again he nodded like an idiot, eyes going wide as Cas’ tongue licked a wet stripe from the root to the head of his dick. The sound he made as that experienced tongue swirled around the head, fingers pressing against the thick vein along the shaft, was inhuman. The man smiled mischievously. “God, I love how much you want me. How desperate and needy you get after only a few touches.”
There was a long silence where Dean worried he’d ruined the moment, where he wondered if Cas was going to toss him away and laughed at how pathetic he was. But then Cas said, “I’ll be here,” and tightened his arms around Dean. It was probably just his imagination but he could have sworn he felt Cas kiss the top of his head as he murmured, “In the morning. I’ll be here.”
“Don’t mind Gabe,” she smiled sympathetically at Dean, “he’s never really been one for hospitality. It’s nice to see you again, Dean, and under much pleasanter circumstances.”
“Hey, hey, you’re okay. I’ve got you.” Dean cooed, rubbing a hand along his back as he kept coughing.
They were quiet for a long time, eyes locked on each other, panting from having shouted so much. The frustration and exhaustion was clear on both of their faces, so much so that a big part of wanted nothing more than to let the other man scoop him up in his arms and take them both to bed. But that wasn’t going to happen—this man had never cared about him, everything between them was a lie, a joke to Castiel. He felt pathetic, worthless. “How. How did you do it, tell me.” He said as calmly as possible.
Beside him, Dean’s body was a furnace that radiated a warmth he craved, wanted so desperately to crawl inside of, to give in to, to accept the comfort and solace it promised. Every few steps their fingers would brush together, a brief contact proved to be almost as distressing as it was reassuring. Maybe if he could just feel the solid weight of their fingers entwined together, he could assuage some of this guilt, this worry. Maybe, if they were together—
“Who d’ya think did it? It’s a good thing you’ve got your looks, pretty boy.” Gabriel pinched his nose but just as he was about to snap at the man, he felt a familiar hand on his shoulder.
This was so wrong, he should have walked away and remained firm in his resolve to avoid the detective. A small treacherous part of his brain whispered, my detective, but he quickly banished the thought. Chewing his lip, Castiel tried to suppress all of the emotions warring inside him—a leader, a solider, wasn’t supposed to want selfishly or act on impulsive but once the crime was committed he certainly couldn’t afford to regret.
Tentatively, he took a seat at the kitchen table. Without turning around or acknowledging him, Cas leaned back to set a mug of coffee in front of Dean. He blinked down at the cup, marveling at Cas’s unparalleled ability to make him feel simultaneously worthless and cherished.
“Great.” Cas practically sang, leaning even closer to Dean. “Now that business is out of the way.” He ran his hands up Dean’s thighs then gently pressed them apart. He didn’t apply enough pressure to actually move his legs without Dean’s consent and he realized that Cas was giving him choice, asking permission. He let them fall open, revealing the pink silk of the panties. He heard Castiel’s breath hitch and watched as the man ran a hand across Dean’s now soft cock, almost in awe.
“This better be important, you know how I feel about my four hours.” He all but growled, pausing only to listen to the noise in the background. It sounded like the Captain was barking orders but that was impossible—he wasn’t due back to the station until the afternoon. “Kevin.” Dean tried to sound calm, though a terrible sinking feeling passed through him. “Tell me what’s happened.”
“Yeah, dude, it’s like a million decibels too loud. People are tryna work, and you’re driving us all fucking crazy.”
Everything was wrong. He sat up and scanned the room sleepily, noting the strange colors and smells and sounds, the way the dim light cast a different set of shadows across a differently furnished room. It was warmer here, more comfortable and lived in than his own austere home.
“Professional stopped three shirts ago, Cassie.” Gabriel sighed, “He’s already taking your man-meat, what’s it matter if your shirt is white or off white or off off white?”
“I don’t want to just hear your pleasure. I,” Castiel faltered, suddenly feeling like maybe he shouldn’t have offered to relinquish control like that. He considered rescinding the offer but realized that this was something that he wanted. “It’s not enough just to hear you. I want to feel you come apart in every way.”
Dean laughed and dropped a hand to rest on the small of Castiel’s back, rubbing soothingly along his spine. “You don’t have to be scared of the water, Cas. It won’t bite.”
Castiel bit his lip again, remembering how many time he’d praised Dean’s beauty through the words of others. How many times he’d mooned over the perfection of mind and body that was detective Dean Winchester, never imagining that one day they’d end up tangled together in bed.
Garth laughed, a large goofy grin breaking out across his face. “Robert,” he said, looking around the circle of people as though waiting for everyone else to get his joke. Apparently, Jessica did because her face split into a giant grin and she had to bite her lip to keep from laughing.
He coughed to cover his own smile, drawing everyone’s attention. Looks like it was time to dive in, he took a deep breath and addressed the group. “Before we proceed, I want to inquire as to whether or not you are all prepared to consider Dean a valuable member of our team.”
“Bonus, he’s likely going to want Cassie here to be even closer.” Balthazar said, offering to pour Dean another drink. The gesture made a strange sensation spread out through Castiel’s body, elated that his family was already warming up to the man.
Closing his eyes, he waited for the song to end, knowing full well it would start up again right after.
“Really? Couldn’t convince him to show you his, first? Even with all the negotiating you did last night?”
Castiel pulled his hand free, wiping them both clean on a discarded shirt on the floor before accepting the call. Dean moved, making room for them both to sit beside each other on the couch. The man’s expression was worried, and he felt his heart start racing at the implication of that look. “Hello Anna.”
“Don’t worry, Gabriel told me all about your engagements. I’ve heard a lot about firmness, Cassie, but have you considered the benefits of tightness?”
It was 6:51, so he pushed Dean’s face off his softening cock. “Go get your shirt on, baby, or you’ll be late.” He said, sparing a second to wipe the tears from the other man’s face.
In the years prior to their meeting, Castiel had uncovered much information about Sam and his relationship to Dean—their mother had passed in a fire when they were children, their father was a police officer at the time but quickly lost his job in a downward spiral of revenge and alcoholism. By the time Dean was sixteen, John himself passed hunting down the arsonists rumored to have murdered Mary. From what he could tell, Dean had raised his younger brother as though he were a son and remained the single most important person in his life.
Hazel eyes blinked down at him, a little more on the brown side than green, but even despite the man’s long floppy hair and unusual height there was still a fair resemblance to Dean.
“Was I not good enough for you?” The question fell out of his mouth without any warning, he hadn’t even been aware that he’d been thinking it. “Was it not even worth your time to say goodbye to me?” He sniffled, anger deflating a bit. “You used me, Cas. You used me and then you left me when I was no good anymore.” He all but whispered.
Dean opened his eyes and sighed, turning to drag his clothes back on slowly. He didn’t turn to look back as he left, shame starting to set in, and Cas made no move to stop him. Dean wanted to scream or cry or run back and crawl into Cas’ arms. Everything was muddled in his brain, he needed sleep, needed to go home.
“You were so good, Dean,” he titled Dean’s head up, so that their eyes were level, “So perfect for me.” When he smiled, it was soft and warm and it made Dean’s heart flutter. “Do you still want to kiss me, baby?”
Without wasting another second, he pulled away and began marching back down the quiet alleyway, ignoring the ache to reach back and hold Dean’s hand. Such casual intimacy was nothing more than weakness, and if Balthazar were to see, well, he’d hardly hear the end of it. Later, he vowed, later when they were alone he would wrap his arms tightly around Dean’s body and indulgence in their closeness.
She laughed. “Alright, alright, I’m just kidding. He probably won’t take it further than a heated make out session. I mean, you will still be in public.”
Castiel grimaced, suddenly feeling a hundred times more anxious. What if Dean actually wanted him to do, well,
“I know, I know.” She sighed, voice suddenly quiet and serious. “It’s just, you’ve had a crush on the guy for so long. He doesn’t even live in the same state anymore.” There was no point in looking up, he could feel the concern on her face, hear the sympathy in her voice. “Don’t you get tired of pining after some dumb jock you’ve never even had a conversation with?”
There was a long pointed silence where they were locked in some kind of angry staring contest. After a few moments the other man took a sip of his drink and moved to sit at the table. “Our business isn’t complete.”
“Said they were fine,” Dean’s voice was quiet and husky, smile tugging at his lips as a hand came up to rest on Castiel’s jaw, forcing him to look up.
None of this was strictly necessary, after all, he’d made Dean stretch himself last night to avoid doing any of the prep in the morning. But, there was something about the man that always made him want to go slow, to take him apart piece by piece until he was quivering and crying with need.
Castiel spun around in his chair, shooting the coldest, meanest glare at Dean who almost stumbled back into the hall under the weight of it.
Shaking his head, he tried not to laugh. This was all so ridiculous and wonderful and impossible. He closed his eyes and let the feeling wash over him, course through his veins and infect every damn part of his body.
Castiel gripped Dean’s jaw tightly, forcing it to the side to expose the delicate curve of his neck. He buried his face against it, panting harshly, teeth grazing the sensitive skin as they rutted against one another.
“N-no, it’s fine. It’s totally fine, absolutely—uh—fine.” He cringed at the repetition, eyes darting away to stare holes in the ground as Dean laughed. “Uh, it’s a really great book.” He muttered to the grass.
“Uh, Cas?” The sound barely registered and it wasn’t until Dean repeated himself louder, more firmly, that Castiel looked over at him. God damn was he beautiful, so sweet and doe-eyed and begging to be corrupted. “Man,” he coughed nervously, “my car is back—”
“No, I—” Dean turned his head around to face Cas. The man looked even more beautiful than before, eyes blown black, hand gently rubbing his own cock.
“I just overhead Jo Harvelle talking and—you’re going to flip,” she pulled at his desk chair until he turned around enough to face her. “Guess who got a job at the community pool?”
“Charlie!” He shouted, flushing at the realization that Dean would most definitely see him in a bathing suit.
“That’s the bloody point! You’re smitten; he’s corrupted your thoughts. When was the last time you trusted anybody?”
Cas came into view behind him, naked now, hands falling to his shoulders massaging them while they both stared at Dean in the mirror. “So gorgeous,” he breathed. “You like it too, don’t you? Like being my pretty little boy, huh?” Dean nodded, rocking his hips forward to get a bit more friction. Cas kneeled down behind him and wrapped his around, one playing with his nipples—pinching them until they were tight and hard—while the other started stroking his cock through the material. Dean felt his jaw go slack. He closed his eyes, dropping his head back against Castiel.
Castiel hummed, getting up quickly to retrieve the oil and liberally coat his fingers and cock. When he came back, he was dripping with slick and the sight clearly did something to Dean who moaned lewdly before burying his face in the cushions, ass in the air waiting to be taken.
Dean looked behind him with a grimace. He bolted to his room and dialled Sam's number. He needed to talk to someone about this latest development and since Sam has been there for Dean from the very start and end of Dean’s and Cas’ relationship, then he was the best option to keep Dean from doing or saying something stupid. Something like agreeing to be Castiel’s best man.
“No, don’t drag her into this. She doesn’t need to get involved.” Dean sighed and closed his eyes momentarily. He didn’t want to ruin any chances Sam had with Eileen by dragging her into Dean’s fucked up life.
Eileen gave him a sympathetic look and signed to Sam that he could go to Dean. Dean needed his brother, she had signed perfectly.
“Okay, okay, I’m calmer.” Dean took a deep breath again, “Sam, Cas asked me to be his best man.” Dean sat on his bed, his head going into his free hand.
Dean messily scrawled Cas’ name on the card before quickly sliding it through the slot. He took a little more time with Ellen’s since he wasn’t trying to hide the fact that he was sending her a rose. “All done, thanks Beck’s, see you in P.E.” Dean saluted her and stalked off, a slight sinking feeling settling low in his gut.
“I can't believe you both did all of this.” Cas smiled widely at the beautiful sights. It was all breathtaking. He looked at Dean with that same gummy smile that got Dean to fall in love with him in the first place.
Cas beamed at the mention of the bees. He had purchased wildflower seeds in hopes of saving the bees and bringing them to his garden. He was glad to hear his hard work paid off. If only he was able to see it happen in person. Castiel left his half empty coffee cup on the table as he got up. He was eager to see the garden, more eager than asking Dean that very stupid request. Sometimes even Castiel was surprised by his own stupidity.
“Okay let’s see,” She set the roses down and pulled out a slip of paper, “Dean, you get twelve roses! A record so far!” Becky nearly squealed. She plucked twelve roses out of her bundle and then the cards that went with them. She bounced over to Dean’s desk and deposited them on top. Dean gave her a grateful smile and set them aside. He wasn’t too excited about the roses because the one person he wanted to send him a rose, didn’t of course.
Castiel woke up hard and snuggly tucked against a firm, warm back. It only took a second to orient himself, then he was groaning softly as he breathed in the sleepy scent of the man in his arms. Gently rolling his hips, his cock strained against the curve of Dean’s ass and he leaned forward to press his lips to those endearing freckles shoulders.
A week later the second object appeared in his apartment. This time, it was an expensive bottle of scotch, something Dean would never have been able to afford. In fact, he was pretty sure he didn’t know anyone who could have afforded something as extravagant as that. Looking at the bottle made him feel this strange mix of nervous and excited and he spent the whole day on edge.
The front gate seemed almost ominous as they approached and he stopped, shifting around nervously in the entrance. “Maybe this wasn’t a good idea. I mean, I’m probably just going to read anyway so—”
There was a painful sense of guilt swirling around inside him but, resolving to remedy the situation later, he tried his best to push all thoughts of Dean completely out of his mind. It was nearly seven and there was work to be done, it was time to focus. He walked toward the phone, dreading the conversation to come.
“If Dean goes tonight it could make people raise suspicions! Unless he gets a call from the department, I don’t think we should risk it.”
He thought about rubbing his cock onto the mattress, try to alleviate some of the pressure, but he already knew that would make Cas angry. And now was not the time to be bad. Dean wanted to be a good boy, to be an obedient body for Cas to use. The thought did nothing to help his situation.
With practiced ease Castiel rolled on top of Dean and nudged his willing thighs apart, making room for himself between them. Feet firmly planted on the bed, Dean spread his legs wide in a silent appeal for more touch.
Before he’d even finished the sentence, Dean had jumped out of bed and was rushing toward the kitchen to put the kettle on. With the water boiling on the stove, he started fumbling around in the cabinet looking for the instant. He could see Castiel’s eyes on his back, watching him work, and the thought did nothing to lessen his now substantial erection.
“Because you’re such a good boy, I know you can wait until morning,” he whispered, smiling into his hair. “But if you think I’m wrong, that you’re not my good—”
He nipped at Dean’s inner thigh, sucking against the juncture between thigh and groin. The detective’s cock was straining painfully, precome pearling at the slit and dribbling down onto his stomach.
He set the tray down in the small slot between the bars and was about to leave when he felt Cas’ fingers wrap around his wrist. “Mmm.” He hummed, “That you did, baby. And it looks delicious.” Cas’ eyes ran up the length of Dean’s body as he spoke, smirking perversely the entire way up.
“Uh-huh.” Cas nodded sternly, hands reaching out through the bars to grasp the waist of Dean’s pants, long fingers running along the waistband before sharply tugging him closer. Inches away, he could feel the heat of the other man’s breath ghost across his lips when he spoke. “Know what I think, Dean?”
Before he was fully out of the room, Cas turned back to Dean. “Come by my cell later, Detective. I think you’ll find me to be much more,” he paused to lick his lips before practically purring, “cooperative.”
They collapsed forward on the ground, completely drained and stayed like that for what felt like hours. Dean was almost asleep when he felt Cas stir and watched him silently as the other man padded toward the washroom. He came back a minute later with a warm cloth and, instead of throwing it at Dean, this time he carefully removed the soiled panties and gently wiped him clean.
“Charles often told me that his goal was to limit their influence on the world, to one day be in complete control of the state’s crime so as to limit its reach.”
A sob threatened to overcome Castiel, so he pressed his face against the solid warmth of Dean’s chest as the man rode his cock slowly. Dean’s hands came up to clutch Castiel head, keeping him firmly against his body. Castiel gasped, hands digging into the man’s hips as his body brought them both pleasure.
“That’s more like it.” The other man breathed, smiling into his neck. Dean turned his head, trying to meet Cas’ lips. The kiss was more frantic than before and the contrast between his fingers and tongue made the slow pace even more painful.
Hopefully I'll be able to post a longer chunk of it by the end of today but, just in case I can't, here is a little fluffy moment to tied you over!
—his name is a sigh that melts on your tongue as you breathe it out. Each letter a pleasure to wrap your lips around. The kind of name you look for excuses to say out loud just to hear the way it lingers in the air, walls whispering
Cas put his hands up but didn’t back away, coming to sit next to Dean on the bed. “I’m sorry.” He said earnestly, face looking softer than he’d ever seen it before. A hand reached out to cup Dean’s face and, even though he really wanted to, he resisted the urge to lean into the touch. Cas rubbed his thumb comfortingly against his cheek. “I’m sorry I left without saying goodbye.”
“That’s it, just like that baby.” He gasped, feeling his anger subside as Dean slid up and down, alternating between using the tip and flat of his tongue on the underside of Castiel’s cock. “Suck, baby, suck,” he whispered and immediately felt the man’s mouth become a vacuum, the sensation making him moan and jerk his hips.
“Okay,” he breathed as the man trailed one hand back up the length of his arm, keeping the other firmly planted on his back.
It took no more than a handful of strokes before Dean was coming with a broken sob, ass clenching around nothing. Cas ran a finger up Dean’s softening cock, catching a droplet of come and bringing it to his lips to suck the salty liquid into his mouth. Dean made a keening sound, head collapsing against the bars as he tried to catch his breath. Seconds later, he felt the other man’s hand tracing the edge of his jaw.
“I want your hips still,” he said sternly. Then, more softly, “but I’d like your hands on me, wherever you wish to touch.”
Dean was pure—a good, kind, thoughtful man who craved affection and tried to do right by people. Castiel, on the other hand, was rotten to the core and whatever light he may have had had been snuffed long ago, stained with the blood of Michael’s demands.
Their bodies tangled together, the heat of skin on skin enough to make them feel feverish as they rocked into each other. Dean whimpered, rolling his hips in search of the friction they both needed. He raked his nails down the curve of Castiel’s spine, greedy hands grasping at his ass to better grind their cocks together.
“Good boy.” He cooed, hand reaching out to trace a line down Dean’s spine. The touch made him shiver, a needy heat spiraling through his body. “I want you on all fours, as close to the bars as you can get.” Dean’s heart was in his throat before Cas even finished speaking.
There was a long moment where Dean struggled under the weight of his renewed realization that Cas was still Castiel Novak, The Angel, a criminal. And not just any criminal but a dangerous person, someone whose job it was satisfy the whims of one of the biggest crime families in the U.S. Some estimated that he’d murdered upwards of a hundred people, some even more than that. The problem was that Castiel’s justice was absolute and almost graceful when it came to killing that it was almost impossible to find any evidence.
“Cas,” Dean said unsurely, looking more and more like he’d made the biggest mistake of his life coming here. The look made Castiel’s heart hurt, this wasn’t how he’d envisioned everything happening, he didn’t want Dean to think they were frightening or evil. It was strange how much he cared what this man thought of his lifestyle, of his friends and family.
“I’ll be here.” Cas said, not turning from where he was doing the dishes. He felt his heat sink. Walking into the bathroom Dean realized he already knew that Cas would be gone before he finished showering. He sighed, turning the water as hot as it would go and then curling in on himself on the floor of the tub.
They settled down in a sunny spot as far away from the little tower as possible and, consequently, from the wandering eyes of any lifeguards. It was a busy day, enough people splashing around that he was practically invisible. Castiel stretched out on his stomach, letting the sun fall across his bare skin as he thumbed open his book and let all his worry melt away. Beside him, Charlie’s nose was already buried in a worn copy of The Hobbit, both content to let themselves get lost in their own worlds.
Those words, the way they felt on his skin, the taste of them, the weight. He wanted to swallow them whole, devour them completely. Dean’s lips were pliant, inviting, opening up like this was everything, the world to him. Their tongues and teeth met frantically, hands groping and pulling. Castiel poured himself into it—all of his love, devotion, worship, and awe.
He quirked an eyebrow and returned his attentions to the man’s nipples, pinching them just enough to make Dean whimper. “Who said I wasn’t talk about tomorrow?”
“Well, trusting me means trusting my little friends. I can get us a death certificate, coverage in every major newspaper, and police reports. But I can’t do any of it without help.”
Another silence passed between them. “Oh,” Dean finally whispered, keeping his face hidden against Castiel’s chest.
“So maybe you’ve done somethin’ not so,” he paused, searching for the right word, “above board, in the past. I’m not—you know I wouldn’t judge you, right brother?”
The only flaw in the plan was Dean—Castiel didn’t want to lose him. There was a clear expiration date on their relationship and he was loath for it to end. Being with Dean was everything now, like he’d never truly felt anything before the man had swaggered into his life. Whenever they were together, his heart stuttered and his hands itched to touch, to take, to wrap themselves around his warm body and press against all the safety it offered.
When they got there, though, Dean wasn’t sitting on the tower or standing anywhere else, Jo was. Usually she worked the morning shift but it was already noon so it looked like they’d just switched for the day. “This doesn’t let you off the hook,” Charlie muttered but there was no real malice in her voice.
“I am not hiding from you. I’ve kept quiet and now that I am needed, I have made my presence known. Michael understands this.”
Michael hummed distractedly, nodding into his drink. “Right, right. Of course.” He continued to nod, eyes unfocused. “He’s making a move. I can feel it.”
“Sam could, you know, keep him away from all this. We could get Bobby to go into hiding or something and mess up his apartment to look like a struggle.”
This didn’t make any sense at all. Sam would never have said—he dropped the note, letting it flutter to the ground, and turned his eyes back to the bag in horror. His heart was pounding in his ears, he tried to stand but only ended up stumbling over the chair. No, no, no, no, no, his mind repeated again and again as he practically crawled to the other end of the room. This wasn’t supposed to happen, this should not be happening. Terrified, he brought his knees up to his chest and closed his eyes, trying to breath.
“Good. Show me.” His hands didn’t move from where they were positioned on Castiel’s thigh, making it that much harder to concentrate on his technique. The kick was obviously decent enough because the second he’d finished, Dean was gently tugging him off the flutter board.
After a minute he bent down and gently pressed their lips together. Dean’s eyelashes fluttered but he kept them closed, as though obeying some silent command to keep them that way. “Cas,” he breathed, hot and needy. The sound making Castiel’s chest feel tight, making him glad the other man’s eyes were closed.
Meg sighed. “You know I love to hear that husky voice of yours, but you mind telling me why I’m awake right now?”
“I think maybe a bit more salt. Do you agree?” He asked and the cook nodded nervously. “Castiel,” he spoke without turning, “come, I want you to taste this.”
“Fuck, another. Want to see—” he moaned, cutting himself off as Dean obediently slipped the third finger into his tight, slick hole. The man cried out, body thrusting feverishly between his hand and where his cock was pressing against the counter. Barely a second later, Castiel’s body seized and he was blindsided by his own orgasm. He came all over his stomach and hand, eyes still locked with Dean’s as he mumbled, “Good boy,” before collapsing sated into the pillows.
“Yes, yes. Though I do wish you’d have written. After that frightful business with the police, well, we were all quite worried. Were we not, Uriel?” There was an answering grunt from somewhere behind them but Castiel didn’t turn, smiling slightly at the other man’s discontentment.
“Cas,” he hissed, eyes darting around the room to make sure no one was within earshot. “You can’t call me at work, if they ever found—”
“Losing a dear friend is always difficult. It’s easier to blame others than accept the randomness and chaos of life.”
He took a deep quiet breath before speaking but somewhere in the space between his thoughts and his words he grew shy again, unsure. “You’ll be here when I wake up, right?”
The anxiety was mounting the closer they got to the factory district, nervous voice in his head too loud to silence now. All these what-ifs and should-you-really-trust-hims were bouncing around in his thoughts, screaming at him to turn back.
His heart nearly stopped beating completely. So, he thought, Michael had figured him out after all. How much did he know—did he know about Dean? Castiel tried desperately to quell his fears, to focus on the task.
Dean refused to acknowledge the fact that maybe Castiel knew, but he chose to ignore it in order to spare Dean’s feelings. Instead, Dean chose to believe that Castiel wasn’t aware of the way Dean felt for him. Maybe those adorable head tilts Castiel always did was because he was trying to figure out what Dean was thinking rather than him wondering how to let Dean down gently once and for all. Maybe Castiel’s constant flustered state was because he liked Dean too and not because Dean’s presence made him uncomfortable. Dean would rather live in utter bliss and infatuation rather than in heartbreak.
“Why would you- never mind. What did he say? What did you say?” Sam looked up at Eileen when she lightly tapped his arm. He gave her an apologetic smile and signed to her what was going on as best he could.
A week later, two days before Valentine’s Day, the roses were being sent out. Dean sat in his homeroom class, leg shaking in anticipation. He shared this class with Castiel and to say Dean was nervous was a major understatement. Dean was fucking terrified. What if Castiel laughed? What if he looked at Dean with pity? What if someone else sent Cas a rose, like Mick Davies, and Cas preferred that one over Dean’s? Dean was too busy in his own panic that he hadn’t noticed Becky walking into the classroom with a bundle of roses and cards.
Sorry for delaying for so long. I didn't really like the last chapter so the next was kinda hard to come up with. Hopefully after this chapter I'll be able to stick to the schedule.
“He asked, I said I would, and he thanked me. I-I didn’t know what else to say so I said I had to call you. And here I am now.” Dean stared at the floor of his room.
“Oh! I forgot Gabriel called Castiel Cassie, that’s too adorable, isn’t it? Do you have any adorable nicknames for Sam?” Becky perked up almost instantly.
“I kinda left my car at the hall last night, you think you can stop by and get it for me?” Dean took one more deep breath before going back to the kitchen.
“Dean?” Sam called into his phone. He had tried getting his attention for a couple of minutes now. Maybe he buttdialed him. “Dean, if you just buttdialed me, I’m hanging up-”
Dean laughed slightly, “like I could forget. Every spring there are always bees flying around thanks to those wildflowers you planted.”
“Yes! I haven't thought about that. I'm surprised you even remembered there was one here.” Castiel tried teasing. Both men needed to ease up around one another, perhaps this garden would do the trick. At least Cas hoped the garden would help ease them both.
Dean Winchester was considered to be the most eligible bachelor at Sunny Meadow High school. He was charming and suave, cheeky and handsome, muscular, and smart. The majority of the female population wanted nothing more than to be Dean’s girl. This guy was absolutely perfect. He had the greenest eyes anyone has ever seen, the brightest smile, and his hair was always groomed just right.
All of the sudden the door flung open, light flickering on, startling Dean out of a deep sleep he hadn’t even noticed falling into. The colt was in his hands before even registering being awake, head instinctively snapping to Cas who was clutching the lamp in a sleepy fog. Turning back to their attacker, Dean cocked his gun completely ready to shot first and ask questions later.
“This was all part of some plan. You knew from the beginning that I’d catch you, knew that I was pathetic enough to let you use me, knew you’d easily get away.”
“More?” Cas pushed a third finger in without any warning and let Dean fuck himself, frantically slamming his body back against the bars, trying to work the digits in deeper. “This is what you want, baby?”
“If you want to come,” Cas’s eyes narrowed into a squint as he scanned the room, before returning to Dean with a smirk. “You can jerk off into that cup.”
They all looked so beautiful, so delicate. It was hard to pick out just the right one, the one that would drive Cas crazy to see him wearing. In the end, he settled on the white lace, shivering as the rougher material dragged over his thighs and hypersensitive cock. Like the last pair they fit perfectly, making him wonder how the other man could have guessed his measurements so exactly.
Dean pinched the bridge of his nose, migraine already beginning to bloom. He wasn’t gonna crack the son of bitch. They could be in here all night and it wouldn’t matter. Guy may have been a massive bag of dicks but he was smart and protected, and he fucking knew it too.
Exasperated, Castiel sighed. “If you would all refrain from scaring Dean any further and give me a chance to explain, I would greatly appreciate it.”
Oral sex had never been tender. He face fucked his partners and, occasionally, took them into his mouth but it was never like this. Again and again he buried his nose into soft hair, swallowing and humming around Dean just to hear his little gasps.
“Of course not, baby. Come here,” he opened his arms and Dean tossed away the dirty cloth before crawling up against his chest, cock leaking precome where it throbbed against his thigh. Castiel ran a hand soothingly across the man’s back, placing a light kiss to his forehead.
“I’ll bring him your flowers, but you’ll have to make it up to me later, angel.” Meg leered into the phone.
“Garth is a reporter, if he knows we have total control over the press. My brother’s wife, Jess, she’s a nurse and pretty damn clever. She’ll figure out a way to get you guys death certificates, make sure the autopsy report says what we need it to.”
“I didn’t use you, Dean.” Castiel’s anger was back, lashing out dangerously. Under any other circumstances he’d probably have been afraid but right now he was blinded by his own hurt, anger, the deep sense of betrayal.
At first it looked like she was going to make him keep guessing forever but then she bit her lip, squirming with excitement and blurted, “Dean!”
Suddenly, Castiel felt uncomfortable. This was too much; it felt like Dean had weaseled his way into some part of him where no one was allowed. He wanted to put distance between them, even as his body refused to let go. Finally, he managed to detach himself and turned toward the table.
“Yeah, ‘course I’m freakin’ frustrated,” he snapped. “Dammit, Cas, I’ve been interrogating you for hours!” Dean pushed away from the table, refusing to look at the man sitting smugly across from him. He needed space, needed to put some distance between them, and clear his head. This was obviously going nowhere—it was coming up on hour three and he’d managed to learn jack all.
They’d been chasing him for four years. Four years he’d spent every moment of every day trying to learn the details of the other man’s life—studying his habits and movements, likes and dislikes. By now he knew how Cas took his coffee, where he grew up, and which restaurants he liked best. And all the while Cas had been studying him too; learning god knows what about Dean’s personal and professional life.
As soon as Dean was far enough way he sighed, burying a big stupid grin in his towel. The man was even more perfect up close. Like absolutely flawlessly, disastrously perfect. The kind of perfect that makes you wonder if the whole universe conspired to create every pore, every muscle, every smile. The kind of perfect that almost makes you sick to look at. Freckles, he thought and laughed. Who would have thought Dean Winchester had freckles!
“How does that feel, baby? You want another?” Dean whimpered, nodding his head frantically and Cas obliged, another finger joining the first and stretching him open. It still wasn’t enough. He needed more. Needed to be fuller, wanted something bigger and thicker and deeper. He whined, “More, Cas, please,” as he started rocking back, fucking himself on Castiel’s hand.
Castiel clear his throat awkwardly, pausing to glare at Balthazar before addressing the room. “Yes, Anna, I did.”
“There, it’s okay. I’ve got you, gorgeous.” Cas muttered; his words like a gentle touch, easing him back into his body. “Come on, we can’t stay like this. Wouldn’t want anyone to walk in—you’d lose your job and the uniform is half the appeal.”
But everything hurt too much. His lips were loose and sore, his knees ached, his hand was cramping—it was humiliating. This was probably the worst blowjob Cas had ever had. He wasn’t a
“But why keep it a secret from me? Why sneak around behind my back making shady deals? If he’d told me—”
“I promise.” The words came out without any hesitation, making him relax even further. Normal, he thought, they could make this work. This is what couples—or whatever they were—did.
“I just don’t see why we’re keeping this from Bobby! You seriously don’t think he could help?” Sam shouted, shaking him from a dangerous train of thought.
He sighed, staring out the tiny sliver of a window—a window somehow perfectly angled so the view was obstructed by a concrete wall outside.
Heat radiated between them making him smile and sag into that firm wall of muscle. Normally he’d never indulge like this but right now he was overcome with need and so, before he could talk himself out of it, turned to wrap arms around Dean’s body. The other man didn’t even hesitate returning the hug, gathering Castiel up tightly. He buried his face in the bare skin of Dean’s shoulder and inhaled. “They’re just weary of you.”
Castiel’s face flushed and he coughed to cover up his own awkwardness. “Fine, Bobby,” he must have said the name strangely because once again the table burst into laughter. Irritated and tired and having gone far too long without touching Dean, Castiel pointed cleared his throat. “If you’re all quite done—”
“I will be.” He caught a glimpse of a smile as the man turned to leave the room. “Be safe,” he called but his voice came out barely more than a whisper. Still, Castiel heard, turning back to throw him a cheeky grin. “Always, baby.”
“G’night, Cas.” Came his own tired murmur as he leaned forward to softly kiss the other man’s chest.
Castiel walked quietly from Uriel’s side to where the dark haired man stood, offering a ladle. He briefly considered the likelihood that it was poisoned before pursing his lips and slurping the liquid. Michael’s blue eyes watched him carefully, thoughtfully, as Castiel considered the soup. “Anymore more salt and you’ll ruin it. Let it cook down, Michael.”
He grimaced at the sleeping man in the backseat, shirt torn to pieces and hanging raggedly from his body. It must be cold, he realized briefly wondering why the man hadn’t mentioned anything. Castiel sighed and shrugged off his trench coat, then knocked gently on the window. Dean startled awake, blinking sleepily through the glass. A moment later, the door opened and he wordlessly surrendered the coat.
Dean was speechless. Benny knew him like the back of his hand, they’d been partners ever since the academy, but he’d never expected him to hit the nail so close on the head. “I—” He started but the words seemed to fail him.
Dean opened and closed his mouth a few times before the question snuck in enough to make him angry. “Do I even seem drunk?” He snapped, probably more cruelly than he should have.
“I should make you prove it.” Cas hummed, slowly grinding himself against Dean’s groin. “What do you think, Dean?”
When he got to the kitchen, though, his face fell. Standing over the stove wasn’t his angel but his brother, and the discovery made his heart sink as much as it confused him.
Victor was crouched in front of a pretty looking redhead with a blanket wrapped tightly around her shoulders and what looked like very little else on underneath. Standing beside them was a short brown haired man, expression a mix of concern and fear.
“Take off your pants and turn around.” Dean obeyed without a second thought, fumbling with his belt as he tried to kick his shoes off. After a few minutes of ungraceful struggling, he was naked from the waist down with his back to Castiel and the beginnings of a blush crawling up his skin.
“Because, I’m,” she stopped tossing clothes in the air long enough to narrow her eyes at him. He gestured awkwardly at his body.
“Okay,” he said, facing lighting up with excited as he leaned in conspiratorially, “so get this—Cas works for some big scary gangsters, right? Well, what if he doesn’t actually want to work for them?”
So he set his grand plan in motion, which mostly amounted to sitting in the evidence lock-up all night for a week straight, holding the gun in his hand. Was it pathetic? Sure, but Dean didn’t care. This felt right—Sammy and Benny both supported him with this, both believed that there was something good about Cas. If he could just convince the other man to open up to him, they might be able to do some serious good. Mostly he thought karma was bullshit but hey, it couldn’t hurt to try to put an end to two major sources of crime and violence in the state.
Which was a strange feeling. He’d never had someone who cared that much about his life, had never felt obligated to stay alive for someone else’s benefit. He closed his eyes and silently hoped that everything would go smoothly, made a promise to God that if he survived today he’d make an effort to more considerate of Dean’s feelings. It made him want to laugh, thinking how different he felt. Like he was a new person here, more relaxed, more thoughtful. If Gabriel could hear his thoughts, he rolled his eyes and smiled, making his way to the bathroom for a shower.
As the kiss deepened it slowed, the tension melting away as they moved into more familiar territory. This wasn’t, he decided, going to be something rushed or easily forgotten. If this was to be the last time, then he was going appreciate it.
Eventually Cas stood, pulling Dean’s clothes back on for him, laughing a little at the ruined shirt. “Get up, baby. It’s time to go.” He said, voice fucked out and rougher than usual.
Dean hummed his assent, the vibrations making Cas’s hips buck up and forcing his dick further into Dean’s mouth.
“Oh you know,” Gabriel sucked on the candy contemplatively for a moment. “Wanted to make sure you caught Alastair, that you weren’t ambushed, didn’t die. That sorta thing. Cross the I’s, dot the T’s.”
He took a deep steadying breath before he was able to speak again. “No.” he said plainly. “That’s all you get tonight. Bring me something to wipe up my mess and then we can go to bed.”
“No,” Castiel said dismissively, “I’m to assassinate him.” He turned back to face Gabriel, “We could have brought that up much more delicately, Gabe.”
“Boy, I don’t know how you knew about this but am I ever glad you did.” Bobby said solemnly, walking back toward the entrance to the munitions building. “If yer feelin’ squeamish you might not want to look,” was the only warning they got before the door was pulled open. The first thing that hit him was the smell, the coppery stench of blood and bodies. He cringed, stepping into the dark room.
Michael only ever discussed business in the drawing room so the fact that he was being lead to the kitchen set him on edge again. It was around three in the afternoon but the house was dark enough inside to warrant the electric lights, making everything feel more claustrophobic and worrisome. He tried his best to swallow the uneasiness, to school his features until they were hard and menacing. Michael responded to power, and this is what Castiel had to portray if he was going to convince them all that everything was fine.
“Want you to watch yourself, baby.” He breathed the words into Dean’s skin, giving him goosebumps. “Want you to see how pretty you look like this,” he sucked on Dean’s earlobe, “all flushed and wanting.” He opened his eyes and stared at his reflection. He thought this would make him feel embarrassed but it didn’t, it just turned him on even more. Cas was jerking him off slowly but he could see the stain from the precome steadily growing.
“With something of angelic light.” Dean smiled. “I didn’t know you were a sap, or that you like poetry,” he teased looking at Castiel adoringly.
But that’s not what happened, Cas just smiled slightly and offered over a glass. “I believe congratulations are in order, then.”
Even as his voice quivered with regret his cock thickened, aching to be touched, breath coming in broken little pants, lips swelling beautifully as he tried so valiantly not to keep touching. It was the most breathtaking sight, causing his own body to react.
“Yeah, but he doesn’t seem like a bad guy. After you went to bed I stayed up awhile researching him. I was pretty angry with you, wanted to know how bad the situation really was. So I looked through the files you had here—”
In the days leading up to his brilliant plan, he’d done some research of his own. Castiel had spilled a lot of blood but it always belonged to someone bad. Not that it justified murder, but Dean felt a lot more comfortable with the idea that Cas was some kind of vigilante protecting the innocent than a killer of good men. The discovery only served to strengthen his sense of rightness, that whatever the other man was doing he should support one hundred percent.
His hand was sweating as he nervously clutched the gun between their bodies; so close he could feel the man’s breath, his body heat. “So, what are you waiting for,” he breathed leaning as far into Castiel’s personal space as possible without kissing him. Cas licked his lips, eyes darting down to Dean’s then back up again. “Why don’t you just take what’s yours?”
Castiel’s hand tightened minutely on the cool metal of the colt, thumb brushing against the engraving as he tried to focus on getting as far from the police station as possible. It was useless, though; his mind kept tripping over the danger, the risk, the stupidity of choosing this. What made it worse was the knowledge that there was absolutely no practical or strategic reason for bringing Dean along. He was risking everything, everyone for some pretty little distraction.
By the time Cas slid the second finger inside Dean’s whole body was trembling with the effort of holding his orgasm back. He kept begging and begging but Cas never stopped or slowed down. The third finger pushed inside and that was it—if Cas didn’t stop, like, now, he was going to come. “Cas, gonna—” he gasped.
“Friends of Castiel.” Anna said easily, “he wanted to make sure everything went smoothly once you got here.”
When their eyes finally met, Dean turned such a deep shade of red, the man nearly fell over from the blood loss. “I’m sorry,” he muttered, dropping his cock and looking at the floor, clearly embarrassed.
Dean breathed a small sigh of relief. Kevin was fresh in from the academy, a bit of a nerd, real nervous about being in the field. He wouldn’t come in; he was sane enough to be scared of Castiel.
The man practically wailed, wiggling his hips closer and successfully managing to force in another inch before Castiel stilled him again. “Want it so bad, Cas.”
He fell forward trying to get a better angle, gripping the table so hard it left marks on his hands. Dean wanted to see Cas’s face but didn’t want to risk glancing back, so he just closed his eyes and imagined: blue eyes dark with want, pink lips parted around his name. Fuck he wanted to kiss him, to turn around and push his tongue into that cocky fucking mouth and
Without a second of hesitation Dean responded, “Yes.” And then a moment later added quietly, “Don’t leave. Tonight. Don’t leave before I wake up.”
“Yes,” Castiel turned introducing him to Balthazar, Gabriel, and Anna, before turning back and craning his neck to look into the apartment. “May we come in?”
Ahh, I finally updated! I'm so sorry this took such a long time (ugh, school and work) but I made sure the chapter was extra long, so that totally makes up for it probably maybe hopefully!
“I don’t know if I do, Cassie. Want to tell me more about his firmness? I know how you appreciate a man’s big, throbbing, firm—”
“Apologize, Balthazar.” Castiel replied coolly as he started to drive, refusing to look at either of them.
As he watched Dean disappear down the hall, he couldn’t help feeling a little disappointed. It wasn’t particularly surprising that there had been no kiss goodbye, but it would be a lie to say that he hadn’t hoped for one. After the stunt he just pulled, he was surprised the other man was even letting him come back tonight.
“Mine,” he growled, “You belong to me, no one else can touch you.” His thrusts had lost any semblance of rhythm as that tight white-hot feeling built up the pressure in his body. “No one else can—ah—can use your mouth. D-Dean!” He shouted, slamming into Dean one more time and coming right down his throat. Castiel held him like that until he was completely spent, amazed that Dean had continued gently sucking, milking him for that he was worth.
The thought made him sad and he tried to will the strange mood away. It was important to get his head in order before meeting with Meg or Michael. One slip could mean any number of causalities. This wasn’t the time or the place to be concerned about Dean Winchester. This New Castiel had to be left behind upon leaving the apartment. Here compassion was welcome and here, he decided, it would stay.
Even the little tokens of Dean’s past weren’t enough to occupy the seemingly endless amount of time in the day so, frustrated and bored, Castiel started cleaning. He turned on the radio, something he’d never bothered to do before, and slowly made his way through each room scrubbing and dusty and sweeping. It was so ridiculously domestic that he almost laughed out loud. Here he was The Angel—fearsome, dangerous, with a name that inspired fear—cleaning his lover’s apartment while everyone he cherished was out risking their life.
“I’m just wondering if we’ve become a home for wayward lambs. Or, are we only letting the pretty ones into our business—”
“Okay… nothing happened, right? I’m trusting you enough to say nothing happened.” Sam was in the car with Eileen, getting ready to get Dean’s car.
“She had to work last night. But she said to say congratulations.” Dean ran his hand through his hair.
Four!? Dean was expecting two but, Four? Crap maybe he should have paid for an extra rose for Cas. Maybe that’s what Mick did. Fuck, there was no way Castiel would pick Dean over Mick now. Who else sent Castiel a rose? Maybe Dean had more to worry about than he initially thought.
“I can go over? I mean, I’m with Eileen, but we can swing by? Maybe diffuse your worries?” Sam said as he grabbed his car keys.
Cas smiled at Dean, though it wasn't because he was happy Dean accepted to be his best man. Dean should have laughed in Cas’ face at his ridiculous request. Dean should have yelled at Cas for being an idiot! What kind of ex-boyfriend asks their ex to be their best man? Castiel apparently. Then again what kind of ex accepts the offer to be their ex-boyfriend’s best man?
Castiel smiled slightly, “I always thought she and Sam would be the first one’s to get married.” He admitted.
Dean pushed the gate open to the garden and closed it after Cas walked in. He gestured to the growing crops, trees, bushes, and flowers. “there you go. I hope I didn't mess anything up.” He rubbed the back of his neck, a nervous habit of his.
“She said the same thing,” Sam chuckled, “We’ll be there in a few minutes, in the meantime, keep the conversation from wedding plans, okay?”
“That is literally the cutest name ever, Sammy,” Becky repeated the name with a dreamy sigh, “Sammy Winchester,” Becky giggled and handed Dean two small envelopes to stick the cards in. “Just write the recipient’s name on the envelope and then slide them in the box,” she tapped the box that sat on the table.
So why did Dean think this stupid holiday Dance was a wonderful opportunity to finally ask Castiel out? Well, that’s quite easy actually, Castiel has been getting a lot of attention from this exchange student recently, Mick Davies, and it was really getting on Dean’s nerves to see Castiel get flustered over that British pompous asshole. Dean once thought Castiel’s shy smiles and flushed cheeks could only result from Dean’s flirting. That is until this asshat from across the sea showed up and replaced Dean. Sam said he was overreacting, but Castiel used to prefer to be Dean’s partner for assignments and whatnot, but now, Mick Davies was Castiel’s new partner. So excuse Dean for getting jealous.
“Speaking of Sam, do you know if he has a date to the ball yet? I was thinking of asking him, but I don’t want to seem too desperate, you know?” Becky handed two cards and a pen over to the eldest Winchester.
The topic was already too close to Cas’ wedding, so Dean needed to change the topic. He probably shouldn't have let his thoughts travel back to his hopeless pinning.
“Eileen told me to tell you that she’s coming whether you like it or not.” Sam kissed Eileen’s forehead and smiled slightly.
Dean glanced at Cas’ locker, hoping to catch a glimpse of the other boy, but he wasn’t there anymore. He probably went to class already, after all, he hated being late. Dean dragged his feet to his next lecture, honestly debating about skipping.
“Dean, no, no, you didn't mess anything up!” Cas looked in wonder at all the greens, reds, and purples. The garden looked beautiful. There weren't any weeds in sight, the bushes were pruned into perfection, the trees were getting taller, and the flowers were in full bloom. “how were you able to manage everything?” Cas asked in amazement. He stepped up to a fig tree and lightly touched the leaves.
“Yeah! I'm your best friend, right? Why wouldn't I be your best man? If not me, then who else?” Dean probably should tone down his false eagerness. He didn't want Cas to think it was all a hoax (even though it was). Dean cleared his throat, “I won't let you down, Cas.”
“I-I need you to say it. I need to hear you say it.” Cas pleaded. He needed Dean to look at him and mean what he said.
“Charlie, two roses for you!” Becky went down her list, Dean listening intently for Castiel’s name, “And finally, Castiel, Four for you!” Becky gave a confused Castiel four roses and four cards.
Dean, of course, knew about all the attention he got from various admirers, but he only had eyes for one person, Castiel Novak. Castiel Novak wasn’t one to stick out in a crowd. He wore the same rumpled looking trench coat and his hair was always in a disarray, but Dean could always find him in a crowd. No matter where Dean Winchester went, he would automatically seek out the younger boy. It amazed Dean that no one else seemed to notice his interest in the Novak boy, that or people were really stubborn and chose to ignore his obvious infatuation. It didn’t really bother Dean too much, no, instead, Dean was more concerned about the fact that Castiel didn’t seem to notice Dean’s infatuation.
“oh… Dean, you didn't have to prove yourself to me. You know I'll always be your best friend. You'll always be mine.” Cas’ heart broke a little at Dean’s words. He had thought… he hoped Dean would have said something else.
“Okay… what’s up?” Sam leaned against his seat, his phone pressed to his ear. He was currently with his girlfriend Eileen, so Sam didn’t want to waste time he had with her if Dean didn’t have anything important to say.
Dean led Castiel out to the garden even though he didn't have to; Cas was well aware of where the garden was. Cas did build it after all. Dean used to buy whatever Castiel needed, whether it was soil, fertilizer, seeds, or that damn greenhouse. (The greenhouse was more expensive than anything else). Whatever Cas wanted, Dean would try to get. Dean used to say it was no big deal, but they both knew Dean wanted to express his love in any way he could.
