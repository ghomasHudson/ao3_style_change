“We don’t have time,” Sam insists. “That’s nearly forty years’ worth of memories you’re talking about. We need to approach this strategically: start with the worst memories and work our way outwards.”
Dean managed to wrench his head leftwards and send Sam a withering snort.
******************************
“That’s all I ask.”
“I’m allowed to think of more than that, and you are too. We’re both our own people,” Sam says gently. It’s the same things he said back then, though it’s only now that it occurs to him how patronising he sounds.
Dean falls to his hands and knees, grimacing as he hits the ground. “That hurt.”
“You really think that?”
“My Dad’s a preacher, what do you think?” Cas replied drily. “You?”
“And then today I said the
“We won’t ask again, where are you going?” Ezekiel snapped.
“Now wait a second there Dean. I was hopin’ that you and Sam could show Castiel the old river while I talk to your daddy. That ok?” it was phrased as a question but there was a firm edge to his voice that brokered no argument.  Despite his recent actions, Dean had been raised in the Church, and a disobeying the Pastor was against his deepest levels of conditioning.
“Uh… just somebody that he knew a while back.”
“I’ve got money: enough for a bus out of here at least. Once we get to a city I’ve got stuff I can pawn off.” Cas said slowly, mentally reviewing the contents of his room.
Dean’s hand was in his hair, when had that happened?
Cas tugs at his arm insistently, and Sam lets himself be dragged from the memory, though he keeps his eyes trained on Dean’s silhouette, even as it fades into smoke and then into nothing.
“You know – ” he says “ – the first time this happened he didn’t even particularly look like you. He was about the same height, same eye colour. Different hair though, and we didn’t even try to get your face right. Sometimes it’s better not to overdo things or go for photorealism – you have to let the brain do all the hard work itself. We sketched a vague portrait, copied a few basic gestures and that was it. Still, that was more than enough – he’d been here thirty years and his memory wasn’t what it is, he filled in enough of the details to believe it himself. I can’t wait to see what the actual you will do to him.”
“Something neither you nor I has ever been able to comprehend,” Cas sighs. “If the previous ten years are anything to go by.” The enormity of the task ahead of them weighs heavy on his shoulders – he’s tired and they haven’t even started yet.
“It’s a good thing you’re doin’, trying to get that boy back where he belongs. With us.” There it was. Of course this would relate back to the church. Everything always did. How good would it make Jim look, Castiel tried to imagine it, if the town “heathen” rejoined the fold.
Stunned, all Cas could do was stare through his tears, hand on his reddening cheek. Nobody in the outer circle had reacted to the slap, except for Uriel, whose face suggested something akin to the second coming.
Shrill shrieks from behind them broke the moment as Castiel whirled round to confront the sound.  The freshman had been watching them it seemed, one was making a jerk off motion with his hand. Dean blushed as he realised how they must look, on his knees, Cas’ hand.
Sam opened his mouth to disagree, and then thought better of it, a plan forming in his mind. “Maybe yeah,” he said instead. “I’ll see you soon ok?”
“Missouri...”
“I stabbed you in the heart!”
After a few seconds they break apart, awkwardly, avoiding eye contact. Sam takes stock of their surroundings. They are, once again, in a long, narrow corridor – empty this time but for them and, inevitably, a door. It’s unmarked, and slightly ajar. Dean approaches it, resting his hand on the wood, then stops.
Sam and Dean exchange a look that seems much more meaningful than a simple acknowledgement, yet Cas isn’t sure why. Sam looks back at him and smiles at something as Dean pulls into the side of the road.
“And this time Sammy there is gonna see how low we sunk,” Demon Dean smiles. “Now, if I were me – and I am me – I would rather face Alistair and hellfire for another forty years than look you two in the eyes right now – that’s just my own special brand of pathetic. Wouldn’t you agree: me?” he directs the last over their shoulders to Dean’s memory, who glares at him, but says nothing.
“What do want Hael?” Cas had asked wearily. “Whatever you want to ask me, just say it now. I’m sick of playing your games.”
“Oh thank fuck,” Sam pulls Dean (
Through the window, Cas can see the silhouettes of two figures, a car, and a cemetery. He recognises it at once, of course. How could he not? As the scene brightens, he picks out details he already knew were coming: the scorched ground where Michael had stood, the bloodstained grass, the cracked windshield, Bobby’s corpse in the grass with his neck twisted at a gruesomely impossible angle: cap and gun on the ground next to him. Some of the blood and viscera splattering the scene (including Dean), he realises with an unpleasant lurch to his stomach, is him. Never more aware of his own materiality than in this moment, he shifts his feet – reminding himself that he is still solid, still here, and not there on the grass, intermingling with Dean’s sorrow and pain. Not literally, at least.
“I should probably get that,” Dean murmurs, though without much urgency.
“I told you already
Before either of them can react, he slams the door in the faces.
“What are you doing?” Alistair hisses, lunging for the blade, his hand freezing in mid-air as the tip pierces Sam’s skin.
eek sorry this took a while! Life keeps getting in the way! We're so near the end now so thank you all so much for sticking with me! Love ya.
“Really? Is it that bad for you?”
“Uriel,” Cas had taken a step towards the other boy. “Please, this isn’t –”
“There was this spell…you probably already know. I’m looking for my ticket outta here, any ideas?”
The same can’t be said for the other Harvey.
Uriel guided him into a nearby classroom, talking all the while. “...really is the best school in the district,” he was saying pompously and Castiel nodded as if he’d been listening the whole time. He found Uriel hard to listen to, the boy talked in an eerily similar manner to his father, Pastor Walker, and it was hard to take a seventeen year old who talked like a middle aged preacher seriously.
Eventually, he drifted into an uneasy sleep. His dreams were fleeting, abstract. He dreamed of bright light, of pain. Green eyes stared into his. There were tears in them. Were they tears of happiness or joy? He wanted to ask, but he couldn’t make himself speak. When he tried it was his father’s voice that emerged.
“Don’t be, you weren’t there. Nothin’ you or anyone else could’ve done. ‘Cept God I guess.” His eyes flashed defiantly across Castiel’s face, measuring the reaction to his statement. When Castiel remained silent, he relaxed again. “Y’know Castiel, you don’t act much like a Preacher’s son would act.”
Once he was out of sight, Dean let out a mangled groan of frustration and fear. “That was close, Cas. Real close. We gotta be more careful.” He was getting to his feet as he spoke, reaching down to help Castiel up.
“While we’re on the subject,” Dean broke through the mirth, “I need you to promise me you won’t tell anyone,
“I don’t know. Nothin’ bad. Christ Sam, do you really think so little of me?”
And of course, Castiel already knew what Jim wanted him to say. He tried not to pay attention to the actual words coming out of his mouth. Dean was his friend, his lover. Even though he knew why he had to say it, it still felt like betrayal. Instead, he focused on his father. He watched his father’s face break into his smile – the real one– as his eyes filled with tears of joy.
“What?”
“Sam, no! Go back inside.” Dean’s panicked voice stopped him in his tracks.
“What? Why?”
“Nobody’ll notice, don’t you worry ‘bout it. Now, sit here,  I’m gonna make us some coffee.”
“What am I meant to do now?” Dean demands, still laughing. “With this big fucking hole inside me?”
“Dean. Stop.”  Cas’ tone is strange and there’s a flicker in his eyes, a softening of his mouth so that for a second he almost seems to be pleading.
Somewhat miraculously, he manages to guide the car to a more or less gentle stop on the side of the road. Leaving the engine running, Dean fumbles blindly, first with his seatbelt and then the door – his hands shaking violently. It takes him a few seconds, but soon he’s stumbling out into the cold night air – breath visible in rapid clouds. Cas struggles with his belt too: his own hands are none to stable either. Sam, snoring gently in time with the engine, sleeps on – none the wiser, it seems, to drama of the front.
Bobby rolls his eyes but, mercifully, doesn’t comment. “Fine,” he says instead, in the tone of someone trying to explain why two plus two equals four, “let’s say we do it your way. You got 40 years of blood and torture down here, how are you gonna find what you think you’re lookin’ for before Sam and Cas catch up with ya?”
. The proverbial straw whip on our mutual favourite camel’s back. The thing that kick-started this whole goddamn shitshow
“Since when?”
“Oh I dunno, might be worth a try,” He’d chimed in. “We can just go up to Michael on Monday: ‘hey you a queer? Wanna be our friend?’ we’ll have slumber parties, braid each other’s hair, the whole deal.” They had been too busy laughing to take in Missouri’s reaction. Dean often wondered if seeing it would have made the truth of their situation apparent much, much earlier. If it would’ve saved them the pain and grief that was to come.
“Please,” Cas continued, voice low with rage. “Will you leave me alone? I don’t want anything to do with you anymore.” They’d been saved by the school bell, which had forced Hael to return to her seat.
“It’s Sam and I heard Dean crying. Is he ok? Why’s he in there. Why isn’t he with me?”
“Shit,” Sam starts towards him, but Alistair’s power freezes him in place before he can even take one step.
“Will you just shut up?” How was he supposed to take five minutes of this, let alone a whole day?
need this, Ok?” Sam’s voice was patient but tired – they’d had this conversation every 10 miles or so on the drive over. “It’s been twelve years since we’ve been together, twelve years since we’ve had a family.”
to say it doesn’t matter.”
The moment ends when John releases Dean’s arm – letting him drop onto the hard concrete. Dean gasps in pain as he makes contact, the back of his head bouncing off the recently re-existent plastic lounger. John follows him, looming even larger over Dean’s prone figure, feet on either side of his hips. Sam, futilely, tries to get between them – but John simply walks through him, stopping at Dean’s shoulders – one boot resting on Dean’s chest. From his pinned position on the ground, Dean continues to glare at John. “Oh yeah this isn’t suspicious
Dean had thus far been avoiding thoughts of his father. His involuntary shudder pleased Pastor Walker, for he continued, mercilessly. “He’s not taking it well, I’m afraid. This year’s been hard enough on him already, what with Mary passing, and now you’ve gone and made it that much worse.”
The surprise of seeing Cassie has temporarily eclipsed any revelations around Dean’s sexuality, but Cas’ words bring them straight (heh) back to the fore.
But Missouri wasn’t in her usual spot. Instead a grumpy, old and conspicuously white woman glared at him from Missouri's desk. “Um. Good morning.” He said, awkwardly. A slight ‘hmpf’ was her only reply, her mouth twisting.
The congregation erupted into jeers and boos.
“Why did you lock it?” Sam presses his hand against the door, but draws it back almost immediately with a hiss of pain. “Shit. It’s hot.”
“Yeah, grab the first bus outta there.”
“Yeah,” Dean says shortly. Then, seeing the look on Sam’s face: “Don’t.”
Dean was nonplussed. “I’m sorry Anna, I –” he began but she cut him off again.
“Honestly, Sammy, I think I’m part of both,” Dean says seriously. “Look:” he stretches out his arms towards them as they turn translucent (flannel sleeves and all). The same multi-coloured fluid that was until recently circling lazily around them flows in the shape of Dean’s arms and hands: identical to the how the tunnel had looked, except for the ugly veins of green smoke that are slowly leaking into the surrounding colours. Sam and Cas gape in dismay until Dean pulls his arms away, the skin reverting back to normal.
Sam eyed Dean suspiciously over breakfast. “What happened last night anyway?” His back was to John, so he missed the warning glare that flashed from him to Dean.
what was sure to be an impassioned sermon by Jim.
“Don’t be,” Dean says lightly, eyes flashing. “You weren’t then.”
Dean glances at Sam. “Sure,” he says. “I’ll take one for the road.”
fall and fall again? What is there about this one that Sam,
“You called?” Comes a voice from behind them.
“Shit,” Dean swears loudly, cutting him off. “It’s locked.”
“Sam…” Cas falters, unsure of what to say, knowing he has to try anyway. “It’s in the past, and there’s nothing you can do about it now,” is what he settles on, though even as the words are leaving his mouth he can tell they’re the wrong thing to say.
Dean had followed Cas’ gaze. “Can we talk?” he asked, tugging on Castiel’s arm. “Privately?”
“This is it,” he says, voice equal parts relief and dread.
Jim had been steadily increasing his pace as he talked, and he took a few seconds to catch his breath. “Now folks, I know what some of you will be thinkin’.
“We need to leave,” Sam says, searching in vain for the way they came in– but all his panicked eyes find is wall. “We must’ve come the wrong way. Is there a door on the other side of the room?”
“Dean! God –” Sam reaches forward blindly, hands skittering over where the worst wounds have been burned into his mind, resting on his brother’s face. “We’re here Dean. We’re here.”
“Dean,” Sam stumbles forward, putting his own hand where Dean’s is. “Can you hear me? Dean, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”
The voice whispered.
“I just wanted to give your nerd ass some tips,” Dean says flippantly, “so you could finally get laid.”
“Well I do. I hate you!” Sam was crying too, but that didn’t mean the words hurt any less.
Dean watched him fondly, he recognised the look on Cas’ face, knew what he was feeling. He had felt it himself, after all, that night at the river. He wished Castiel had been there so he could’ve watched Dean’s face, seen Dean’s rebirth.
“So your grace is restricted in here?” Sam smiles, “that explains why you’re so pissed.”
“He’s too strong,” Cas groans and would fall if not for Dean’s hands keeping him steady and upright.
He couldn’t wait until Monday, he had to see Cas.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean murmurs vaguely, and they get the sense he would be waving his hand to wave away their concern if he could stand without the pool cue. He squints up at them like he’s trying to figure something out. “You guys look weird.”
There’s a scream, a dramatic puff of sickly green smoke, and a gunshot. A body hits the floor. Sam and Cas freeze in the doorway. Dean Blinks at them. His eyes feel hot – there’s green smoke flickering over them, clouding his vision. He stretches a hand out – trying to warn them away. They don’t listen. They run forward, Sam grabs his shoulder, Cas grabs his wrist. They begin to ask if he’s ok.
“Cas, I don’t honestly know if he’s been hurt, but if he has we ain’t doin him any favours by arguin’. Just stay here, please.” Missouri left before he could retort.
“Sammy, I’ll be fine ok? I’m not going to be alone; you should go have fun with your friends.”
Bobby steps up to the portal, but his hand refuses to pass through. “Looks like I’ve done all I can,” he says sadly, shaking his head. “Is there anything I can say that’ll make you stop?”
“Every time you leave I worry that you’re not gonna come back – that this will be the end for us and I won’t even know it,” Cassie buries her head on Dean’s shoulder. “But now…it might be end for all of us. Forever.”
“Nope, we won’t tell him.”
“Yeah, tell me what I missed: prom date, college, gay phase?” he wiggled his eyebrows suggestively and Sam blushed: equal parts amused and angry.
“Bobby? What’re you doing here?”
“You should stay longer sometime, or at least the night,” Cassie smiles slyly. “I know you miss my cooking. And Jonah could use some help with his car – not that he’ll ever admit it. I’m scared to go near the damn thing –it’s ‘bout fit to explode.”
Dean shrugged. “Not surprised. You’re his son, the golden child. I’m the resident heathen.”
I’ve only been at this school for four hours he wanted to say. “No I didn’t know about it,” he said instead.
The girl frowned over her pad. “That it? Sure you don’t want some pancakes or something? They’re the best in the country: believe me,” she smiled wanly, “I’ve had ‘em all over and these are the best.”
“Castiel you movin’? You’re gonna to be late if you don’t get up soon.” Jim’s voice was muffled through the door.
“You’re just lucky I don’t remember you in that chair,” Dean throws back, laughing at the cursing he gets instead of a reply– he’s missed this more than he normally lets himself admit. “Don’t worry, it’s not much further,” even as he says it he comes to the place. He stops just inside the tree line and finally lets Bobby catch up. “Here.”
“Do you remember,” Sam said slowly, warily, “the last time we were at this bus stop?”
Dean shrugs.
A familiar resentment rose in his throat. He squashed it before the questions could form. It wasn’t Dad’s fault. He was only trying his best. It wasn’t his fault
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas felt something snap inside him. There was no point in this any longer, he realised. He was doomed either way: he may as well go down fighting. “My loving father? Are you serious?” he spat, face split in a humorous grin.
He had opened his mouth to retort, still not entirely sure what he was going to say, when the kitchen doors opened.
Dean was talking to a girl he saw as he drew closer. It wasn’t the same girl from lunch, she looked younger, and her hair was red. She laughed at something Dean said and turned away, giving him a small wave as she left. Dean stared after her, an unreadable expression on his face. Then he turned and saw Castiel hurrying towards him, and his face broke into a smile.
“Yeah,” Dean’s voice was surprisingly confident, and there was a slight grin on his face. “You got anythin’ you wanna say to me Dad?”
“Alistair.” And as Sam says his name, the demon takes on the more familiar form he remembers. “I killed you.”
“Mom loves us. Both of us. And Dean’s not a degenerate. He’s a good man: the best. You have no idea what he’s been through, what he’s suffered. How strong his love is because of it,” Sam thought of Cas, of Charlie, and it was all he could do to hold his tongue. “And all because of you.”
Distantly, a door slammed. Reality reasserted itself, pushing between them, forcing them apart. They stared at each other. Fear was already devouring the happiness within them, disgust soon followed.
For the first time in days, he felt calm. The physicality of Dean – the coarseness of his hands in Cas’ hair, the softness of his lips, the wetness of tears on their cheeks – reassured his heart in a way that was beyond the scope of words. He pressed in closer, until he could feel Dean’s heartbeat, in sync with his own. He was
“Tell you what,” Dean says. “Both of you look me – any me – dead in the eyes and tell me that we’ll all come through the other side and everything will be the same. You tell me that you won’t see me any differently now that my entire goddamn life’s been paraded out in front of you. And this is before hell, mind you, and hell is before the actual exit. What you’ve seen so far? Nothing compared to what’s coming up. So you look me – any me – dead in the eye and tell me that it’s all gonna be ok and nothing is going to change between us, and I’ll let you walk right on through.”
“Well something changed your mind about me. What was it?”
“You know what they say,” Dean shrugs. “All’s fair. And this is both.”
Seventeen years worth of memories had crowded his mind. Suppressed dreams, glances at boys in the street, a sense of longing barely understood the wave of fear that always followed.
“You don’t need to explain,” Dean told him softly, “It’s ok.” He could read Castiel as surely as Cas could read him, and the hardship and tragedy written into Castiel’s body: his tightly held posture, the military precision of his hairline, the immaculately ironed trench coat and trousers. Castiel’s years, he suspected, had been as rigid and regimentally evil as his had been chaotic and frenzied. “He sent you somewhere didn’t he? To one of those ‘schools’.”
“Thank you, Dean.”
it inside me, Bobby, crawling through my head, putting itself inside me and I know I have to get it out before it eats me from the inside out. But…” he can’t finish his sentence but he doesn’t need to – he’s talking to himself after all.
“I don’t know why you’re trying to deny it,” he spreads his hands in mock confusion.  “You’ve never been shy to admit how bad I’ve been for you, so why do you ignore how bad you’ve been for me?”
“I know honey,” she lay a comforting hand on his shoulder. “I hope he can get away before you go.” She felt him tense up, but pushed on anyway. “It would be for the best if you two left together, but if not – ”
“Fuck.”
Instead, he was treated to stony silence for the entire ride to the school. Anna answered his questions politely but obviously preferred staring out the window than talking to him.  Dean let quiet sit, it wasn’t until they were at the school that it occurred to him that Anna was annoyed him. He was alerted to the possibility when she practically ran from the car to the hall, not stopping to wait.
“What can I say? At least it’s in character.”
“Yeah I get that,” he snaps. “I just need a bit of time, ok?” he sits cross-legged centre stage, refusing to meet the audiences’ (his) eyes. “It’s not like I asked for this.”
“He threw a
“I don’t think that’s possible,” Sam points out. “At least this way, we know we’re somewhere, even if it’s the wrong direction.”
“What about God? If you ignore God you’re being sinful.”
“And what’s that supposed to mean?”
“He hated it that much?”
“Come here Sam,” Missouri pulled the other Winchester down into a hug of his own, “it’s good to see you. How’s Stanford? How’s Jess?”
The rest of his words were swallowed by the bloodthirsty crowd.
“Got to be: these are some of my worst, most shameful memories.”
“What do you want us to say?” Cas asked.
Uriel, Pastor Walker’s son, was by his side pointing officiously at students and teachers as they passed. Dean turned away, angered at his own regret. Of course Pastor Novak would ask Uriel to show his son around, it was probably a good thing. Uriel was popular, the benefits of being a Preacher’s son in a church town, and Castiel would make more friends hanging out with him than with Dean.
There’s a soft tapping on the window. “He said that you should wake him,” Cas says, voice slightly muffled by the glass. “He wants to do it now too.”
“Who?”
“…Like, like the stars or something. There was this rush, as if all the blood in my body was pulling towards you.”
“Yeah, if you weren’t such a reckless idiot then maybe less idiotic things would happen to you.”
Cas could feel the hope blooming in him again. It wasn’t an instant fix, but it would have to do. “Ok,” he said excitedly, “I’ll tell my father tonight. But – ”
“Who?”
It was easier to agree, Cas decided, than to shatter Dean’s convictions. “I don’t think it matters anyway.” He said instead. “She was kind. She offered us a safe place. It’s more than anyone else would do.”
“In the photo on the wall. She was wearing a red dress."
“I’m not lying,” Sam insists, feeling nineteen again. “It nearly killed me to go.”
“I walked mostly, round town. To keep warm y’know? Didn’t realise it got so cold at night here. Then when I got too tired to move anymore I came here, to wait for you.” His eyes met hers for the first time. “Missouri, what are we gonna do?” There was despair in his gaze, yes, but hope too. He wanted her to tell him everything would be ok, that he would see Cas and Sam again. That John would smile at him and look at him; that everything could go back to the way it had been.  It amazed her he could still be so hopeful. It destroyed her that she’d have to dissapoint him.
,” Dean somehow manages to infuse the word ‘sir’ with enough sarcasm to make it sound insulting. “I stand by it. So I don’t know exactly where Sam is right now –
John seemed a little shocked at the offer, but he nodded gratefully. “That would be nice Jimmy, thanks.”
Bobby rolls his eyes so hard Dean’s surprised they don’t get stuck. “Oh yeah,” he says in a voice dripping with sarcasm. “There’s a real winner of an idea: re-visit all your most traumatic and painful experiences one right after the other with no back-up and no support.”
“You haven’t lost me, Dad. I’m right here. I’m – ” John shut the door in his face.
“But you don’t know for sure?”
Dean reached over and clapped Sam on the shoulder affectionately. “Thanks Sammy,” he grinned.
“Gay diner.” Dean reminded him, a hard edge to his voice now, and Sam felt his face heat.
“I gotta say,” he says and his tone is light: conversational. “I’m impressed. Every time you think you’ve seen it all – you humans go and surprise me with the sheer
Dean snorted slightly. “Yeah, you wouldn’t ‘ve. She never goes to church : she’s like the only person in town who doesn’t.”
Dean takes a long drag on the cigarette, blowing smoke across the lake. He passes the lighter to Sam.
3. Americans do not know how to say the word "Abomination". seriously guys, there's an "i" in the middle it's not "A-bomb-nation"
Inwardly, Cas groans, though it’s not as if it’s a surprise. If there’s one thing you can count on Winchesters to do, he reflects ruefully, it’s walk straight into a trap.
“And he’s not, uh, supportive?”
“If only it were that easy.” Castiel smiled weakly. “I hoped that when I moved, if I did what my father wanted. If I seemed normal–” He stopped, “it was stupid.” He admitted, “I just wanted to get out.”
“Sorry,” Cas sounds a little sheepish. “I may have been…overzealous.”
“No. I have to see Sammy. He needs me –” He had to explain, to tell Sam what was really going on.
“We have to trust ourselves. What we think, what we feel.” Dean said earnestly. He leaned closer to Cas until their foreheads were touching. “That’s the only thing we know for sure is true. I don’t care what God or Jim or Dad or anyone else thinks. All I know is that I liked our kiss, and I like you. All I need to know is if you feel the same way. Do you?”
“Good luck out there!” Dean calls after the retreating figure. “Ok, that makes things easier. And saves us from diggin’ at least,” He strides forward.
Unlike the previous two scenes, a new reality does not immediately impose itself upon them. Instead, Sam and Cas are back to walking through nothing – though a distant, warm light is at least giving them something to aim for. They walk, in silence, both desperate to speak, but waiting for the other to go first. This is Sam’s more than his, Cas knows, yet without his grace suppressing the rawness of his emotions he’s finding it hard to hold everything back – and he can tell Sam wants to speak yet is too muddled to really start. Eventually, Sam figures it out.
you?” Sam feels his hand tighten involuntarily into a fist. He wishes their father was in front of them so he could punch something softer than the metal of the impala but harder than the air in front of him.
The park is a shifting sea of rainbows and flags, almost garish in the weak daylight. The sky is an overcast grey wall, threatening ominously towards rain, but no one on the ground seems to care. Dean absentmindedly accepts a clear rain poncho from an official and uses it to obscure the EMF meter in his hand. He walks the perimeter of the event, keeping close to the metal barriers.  A group of teenagers with painted faces eye him with curiosity from the queue. He notices a printed ticket crushed in one of their hands.
He’s barely finished the sentence before Sam pulls him into a hug. It’s quick but fierce, and they both come away smiling. “Ok, I promise to stop trying,” Sam laughs. “But before I do, let me just say that I’m so proud –”
“I hope not,” Sam says fervently. “I think I’ve learned more about you in the last day than in the last thirty years combined.”
They all laugh and even though none of them means it, the rest of the journey passes smoothly.
Sam barely hears him – his whole world has narrowed to slowly shrinking space between him and Dean.
“Shut up!” Dean couldn’t take anymore. “We haven’t done anything wrong.”
“He’s had plenty chances, Son. He could’ve come forward, but he chose to run.”
“Sam I mean it: go back to bed. Dean’s fine. It’s just time for him to sleep on his own again.”
Sam pulls him into a hug. He tries to make it like the ones Dean used to give him, back when he was the taller one – tight and engulfing, becoming the whole world. Dean’s arms reach around and encircle his back, squeezing hard in return. The shakes of one body become the trembling of the other – the heartbeats are indistinguishable. They stay that way for a while.
“Anna!” he caught up to her at the entrance to the gym. Cheesy music drifted out the doors. “What’s wrong?”
“You,” he wheezes, still looking down. “You ripped my fucking heart out. Bit on the nose, isn’t it?”
Dean’s smile faltered slightly. “When your Dad came back he went to ‘talk’ to her. He brought the mayor with him. She took the books off the shelves, but I think she still has them. I used to take Sam there a lot, but after that he wouldn’t go near.”
“Castiel, there is a spare desk next to me, Hael, Inias and Raphael. We think you should sit with us.” He smiled smugly at Dean, “you don’t want to be seen mixing with the wrong people.”
“I really need to get that,” Dean sits up, casting about for the phone.
you, but I believed it was, so what difference does that make? And from now on it always
“You’re a danger to our community,” Michael supplied, his cruel smile marring his handsome face.
Cas doesn’t seem able to hear him. “This didn’t happen,” he says again, eyes filled with pain and rage. “This was just a dream, just a nightmare he sent to taunt me. It wasn’t meant to be real.”
Dean doesn’t know what he’s talking about, but he nods – better to pretend than to risk any more pain than he’s already got coming for him.
“But Sam knows those two memories ain’t exactly exceptions – hell, they’re basically specimens,” Dean laughs. “Sammy’s always known what he is and what he does – haven’t you Sammy? Sucking the life out of my life, isn’t that right?” Sam visibly flinches and Dean laughs again. “What? Nothing to say in your defence?”
“Well we were hoping to study. We’ve got some exams and stuff coming up.” Cas explained.
“Come on,” He snapped eventually. “The others’ll be waiting.” He escorted Dean up towards the house. As he did so, Dean saw his father’s car parked on the street. His heart, which had fallen permanently to his stomach hours ago, somehow managed to sink to knees. He’d never felt anything this bad before, even when Mom had died, but something told him it was about to get a whole lot worse.
“He went out for a smoke,” Cassie tells him, coming to sit on the end of the bed beside him.
“You got a point there,” Dean concedes. Then: “Did you hear anything we talked about – me and Cas?”
“There are quite a few tests in the next few weeks, and SATs.”
“Jim!” Gordon Walker forced himself between father and son. “I think you should go sit on the couch. The situation is obviously too personal for you right now. I’ll handle it. Novak was breathing heavily as he crossed the room, glaring at Dean the entire time.
“Dean’s slipping away from you,” Cas says triumphantly. “He’s fighting.”
“You know what it means,” he said aloud. “It means you’re a faggot. A dirty, disgusting, hell bound pervert.”
“The Ghost. I know what he said.”
“How do we know we can trust you?” Sam asks. “How do we know that you’re part of Dean and not part of the spell?”
His eyes met Castiel’s and seemed to dare him to say something, anything about his disrespect. Castiel knew a good son should stand up for his father, but something about Dean Winchester made him want to laugh instead.
She keeps her face buried against his body, hoping he won’t notice her tears. But he notices, of course, because there’s no sweat for them to mingle with, and probably because he’s an angel who can sense things down to their molecules. She feels him shift, try to pull away so he can look at her with concern in his eyes.  She responds by pushing herself closer.
“Right,” he said, “let’s swing by the library, pick up Missouri and get the hell outta this ass end town.”
were wrong. Because I couldn’t bear another 10 years without my brother – and neither can you. You’re just too stubborn and weak to admit it.” He turned to leave.
“There’s nothing wrong with you,” Cas says patiently. “You’ve just been through a lot.”
“You know,” Dean says to himself, the only other himself on the otherwise bare stage. “It’s not like tricking Sam an’ Cas will actually do anything except piss them off. They’re gonna have to see it all eventually.”
“You said ‘was’,” Sam says as they break apart. “About Dad.”
Dean purses his lips. “I never meant to hide it from him,” he says. “Not really. It just didn’t really happen that often. Me sleeping with men I mean,” he adds at Cas’ confused expression. “I didn’t really even twig that I found men attractive until after Sam left for college and dad gave me some space, and the men I do find attractive are pretty few and far between. I guess I thought’d it all,” he smiles, “come out one day and that’d be the end of it.”
“So you’re saying we can’t kill him?” Sam mutters, barely dodging another swing. “What the hell can we do then?”
“Me too,” Dean lead the way up the stairs, pushing eagerly into the mercifully cool interior.
“Monsters like that are
“Is this the end?” Cas’ voice was small. “Of us, I mean.” His mind had raced far ahead of his body: a thousand scenarios of what awaited them ran through his head.
Castiel nodded. Dean felt rather than saw it and pure happiness burst to life inside of him. He felt like he should be glowing in the morning sun.
…She’s not sure how long she stays like that in Cas’ arms, but she knows when she wants to move again, when the heat in her stomach spreads into desire. They’re kissing again and he’s moving her backwards towards the bed. Her shins hit the frame and there’s the familiar tilting, the protest of springs as her back hits the mattress. For a second Cas looms above her, looking concerned. His face clears when she laughs, however, and she swings herself onto the bed properly, pulling Cas gently until he’s next to her.
Cas shakes his head. “Nothing.”
“That’s all we can ask of you. Take care.”
That meant pious, adoring altar boy. “Of Course. Are the Winchesters old friend’s of yours?” he asked, politely curious.
“We need him. He’s the only one with a chance against the Darkness.”
“When did she tell you?”
Dean managed a weak smile in return. “I guess not.”
“Thank you Cas,” The nickname was as instinctual as the hand on his shoulder had been. The normal rules of social interaction had been suspended for a few shining seconds and they clung to each other.
Falling in complete blackness is something Sam hopes to never experience again. He can’t even tell if he’s moving, not really, or if his stomach is just twisting to give the illusion of falling, and it’s only his own panicked breaths that give any indication of how much time is passing. The hard ground slamming into his feet, throwing him off balance, is almost a relief. At least it’s an indication of something.
“He’s a weird guy. Now, I’m gonna head home and get some food for me and Dean. Cas, are you staying?”
“I think he did but…I don’t know if loving someone is enough to stop you from hurting them. It hasn’t been for me,” Dean sniffs.
They both stood in silence, trying to figure out what it all meant, until a car pulled up opposite them.
Had he kissed Cas? Or had Cas kissed him. Dean didn’t care, couldn’t care. All he knew was that they were kissing and, for the first time, everything made sense. Cas was warmth, he was light. It was as if he were holding the sun. Dean’s whole life had been building to this moment, he thought. All the pain, all the sadness, existed to make this moment perfect by comparison. For the first time, he was happy. Happy in a way he hadn’t known existed until now. He could never could go back. He could never give this up.
“Not to be too graphic,” Dean wheezes through the pain, “but I bottom so…”
“The one you were talking to earlier?” Sam cuts in, “Jesus Dean what did you say to them?”
“Looks like you’re stuck in the bible belt for now,” he said as Castiel gathered his things, trying not to let the disappointment and embarrassment coursing through him creep into his voice. It was stupid. He was being stupid.
Sam hesitated for a second. “Four years ago,” he admitted. He owed Dean the truth. “When I started college.” He watched Dean’s face carefully, searching for…he wasn’t sure. Anger maybe? Or betrayal. But Dean’s face was carefully inscrutable.
“Dean!” a voice barked from behind them. John Winchester stood in the doorway, wearing a ridiculously frilled apron that obviously wasn’t his, glaring daggers at his son.
“You can’t chase demons if your lungs are black.”
. Everything is too large – the table and chair are abnormally tall– the seat about level with Dean’s head. The two beds loom ominously and stretch upwards well beyond what their actual size should allow. Between them is a small crib, the only thing in the room that’s the correct proportions. The shadows are strangely angled and contorted, flickering at the edges of their vision as if alive. Sam flinches as a clawed hand reaches from the corner of his eye, but by the time he turns to face it, it’s gone. Everything is deathly quiet and, overpowering the normal motel smell of cheap detergent, is the unmistakable smell of smoke: thick and cloying.
He still hadn’t grasped his new reality. He still believed everything could somehow go back to normal. Missouri couldn’t help but admire his optimism; she just hoped it wouldn’t cost him too much.
Another cheer.
“Wound or disarm, but don’t kill,” Cas suggests, slashing towards Dean’s arm with his blade. “Try to get around him. We just need to get through that door.”
He realised that the way Hael was looking at him had changed. The placid curiosity had been replaced by something more dynamic, calculating. “Castiel,” she said slowly. “Do you know about the dance on Thursday?”
No matter how he acted towards the church, towards his father, Castiel had always believed in God. He needed to, there needed to be Right and Wrong. Otherwise, how would any of them survive?
“I didn’t say anything.”
Absently, Dean wonders how many times Sam’s practiced that speech, and how long he’s been keeping it up his sleeve: waiting for the perfect opportunity to unleash his emotions. Maybe he asked Jodie or Cas or even Charlie to help him write it. He thinks about the kid in the queue, how they probably would’ve killed to hear a speech like that from their brother. He’s lucky, he supposes, that Sam is bending over backwards to accept him. But try as he might, he can’t bring himself to be anything but mildly pissed off at the whole situation.
Castiel sighed in relief once he was alone. It was Friday; he wouldn’t have to see Dean again until Monday. By then he could steel himself against temptation. By then he could stay away.
Dean too had ideas of what was coming. None of them were good. He couldn’t say any of them out loud.
“Every time you’re gone – for whatever reason – it’s like a piece of my world is gone too, and I mean that literally.” Sam says. “It’s like if you woke up one day and all the mountains had just vanished. How are you supposed to continue with half the landscape missing?”
“Well look and check.”
Cas feels his heart twist at the cruelty of John’s words – the needless and borderline sadistic power play – and at the sullen slump of Dean’s shoulders under the onslaught. He doesn’t answer the question, but continues to stare at the ground.
There was no avoiding it now.
He smiled weakly at his older brother. “Hi.” Dean had changed. The slim, haughty figure of his memories had filled out: broad shoulders, strong arms and light stubble over a well defined jaw. Even his eyes had changed. They were still the same bright green (
A movement out the corner of his eye sent his head snapping back up. Cas felt cool air fill the space where Dean had been and he turned to see his father approaching. Panic screamed inside him, and he barley heard his Jim’s greeting.
“Yes. I found the bus stop, the one outside town. There’s a bus every Wednesday night that goes to the city. From there, we can go anywhere. We can get to the other side of the country if we have to.”
Sam decided he didn’t need to know what ‘other stuff’ meant. He doubted Dean would tell him anyway. “You’re still not giving me much,” he griped. “What about Castiel?”
“It’s me.”
“Actually,” Sam cuts in, “you’re the best, uh, ‘person’ to ask about this. You know where it’s hidden, don’t you?”
“Sulphur,” Dean says, vaguely, not seeming to hear them. “I can smell sulphur. And smoke.”
What did he have left?
“Ah but of course,” Alistair seems unconcerned. “It’s early days yet. I know you don’t remember that you remember this – but we have so much fun still to come. Don’t worry.”
“I’ve let this go on long enough.” John’s voice was suspiciously calm. He wasn’t looking at Dean, but at the wall just past his head. “Sam’s at Ruby’s. By the time he gets back I want you gone.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean was beginning to panic. “No, please, Dad. You don’t understand. I need Sam. I can’t...I can’t be alone. Please.” He begged, caution and pride thrown to the wind. It was this, the grovelling desperation, so unlike the Dean he knew, that pushed John over the edge.
She’s not sure what to do with them when he lets go, except that she wants to be touching him again, and so she leans in close, pressing her body against his. She can feel the unnecessary beating of his heart (slow and steady) as she puts an ear to his chest, letting the vibrations reverberate through her: calming her own rapid heartbeats, leaving a warmth to settle into her stomach…
It was lunch time; Castiel had hidden from the omnipresent Hael and managed to sneak to Dean’s table. Without talking, Dean had led him outside onto the overgrown grass alongside football pitch. It was good to be outside, despite the muggy clouds. There were a couple of snotty looking freshmen eating together (too weird to sit with everyone else, too scared to ditch like the older kids) but apart from that they were alone.
Dean finishes his cigarette, makes to flick the butt into the lake then reconsiders – placing it back in the box instead. “I’m trying to: I really am but…all I ever wanted to do was keep you safe, Sam. You
In front of them, Dean laughs softly as the man presses in close and whispers something in his ear. Sam catches Cas staring at him out of the corner of his eyes.
Sam hums in agreement. “I never really realised he was ever like that.”
“Like what?”
Sam opens his mouth to protest, but Cas beats him to it. “We won’t force you to talk about this or anything else Dean,” he assures him, squinting meaningfully in Sam’s direction. “
“Cas, wait!” Dean called hopelessly after him. He didn’t know what we would’ve said or done, but it didn’t matter, for Cas kept running.
“Huh,” he surveys the scene in front of him, “who knew the inside of my brain was so…ineffable?” He squints slightly, and the tunnel melts into the familiar interior of the bunker: the golden lights dim, flatten, and stretch into doors: each with a long series of numbers on the front. “There,” Dean says, satisfied. “That’s a bit easier to work with conceptually, ain’t it?”
This should make them all happy, he thought bitterly. His father would love Hael. He would hold them up as shining examples of American youth in one of his next sermons. He wondered if Dean was going to the dance. He hoped so.
Suddenly, the gentle heat was oppressive. Dean wanted to get out, but he was pinned by Sam on one side and the Talbots on the other. It would be too suspicious if he tried to leave. In the front pew, Castiel had frozen. To him it felt as if a spotlight was pointed at him.
Red blotches spread over Jim’s face and he took a step towards Dean as if to strike him.
“Let him go,” Missouri sounded tired. “He needs to let his head clear.”
As we watches their silent conversation, he fights to keep back tears of his own, Dean’s words from the motel still running through his mind. Is this one of those ‘in-betweens’ Dean had dreamed of? As much as the earlier revelations into Dean’s sexuality had surprised him, he (not to mention the rest of the goddamn world both supernatural and otherwise) isn’t exactly blind. That Dean’s feelings aren’t a notable exception to a lifelong pattern; that there might be more than simple sexual repression that’s kept him from acting all these years; that he and Cas have been restrained by a shared fear that links them even as it drives them apart, and that Cas may have irrevocably broken what’s between them without even knowing it, elevates the entire situation from a farce to something more tragic than Sam could ever have possibly imagined. Fiercely (futilely) he prays to a god he knows isn’t listening (and probably never cared much to begin with) that the real Dean will somehow buck a forty year trend and actually talk about this when they get back to the real world.
well this is it! thank you everyone for sticking with me through this and for all the encouragement. <3
Sam is surprised to find himself almost shy – now that the moment is finally here he finds almost doesn’t want to go through with it. “Can we talk?”
“We find Dean, the real Dean” Sam says grimly, forcing himself to start walking forward in the blackness. “Stay beside me.”
“Where – ah.” Bobby cuts off. It’s obvious. Beyond where they’re standing like rows of trees: flattened by some (as yet) unknown force into an almost perfect circle. The grass too is pressed flat into the ground – even scorched in a couple of places. At the dead centre of the clearing is a mound of dirt with a wooden cross sticking out of it.
“Uh-huh. You too.”
“And that was just kissing,” Deans eyes get a faraway look. “Imagine what everything else will be like.”
As they walked up to the front door, he saw that the garden was more run down than would normally be allowed, the lawn was overgrown, and weeds were creeping up through the flower beds. The front porch needed a fresh coat of paint as well. Such things would normally warrant a concerned visit from the neighbours in a town like this, he supposed having a dead wife allowed some leeway.
“You don’t have to hurt anymore,” he tells Dean, taking a deep, shaky breath. “You don’t need to try. I’m here for you, whatever happens. Do what you have to.” Keeping one hand on Dean’s face, he moves the other back to the knife, pulling it gently towards his chest.
.” Sam laughed bitterly. “I thought I’d changed
“You like photography then?” he asked, thrilling at the way Cas’ eyes lit up as he began to talk. Dean couldn’t really follow what he was saying, something about exposure times, but he enjoyed the sound of Cas’ voice.
The room is dark, almost pitch black, but he’s been in enough motel rooms to feel his way to the bed, kicking off his shoes and stripping off his shirt and pants as he goes. His eyes are drooping closed by the time he hits the pillow, and he’s asleep in seconds.
Eventually they pulled back, Cas wanted to look at Dean’s face. His features had hardened, sharpened, in their years apart but Cas could still see the softness that was Dean’s true self: a self only Cas had ever seen. It was in the glow of his eyes, the blush of his cheeks, the softness of his lips. This was a Dean that, through necessity and choice, was long hidden from the world, but he was still there, for Castiel. Waiting.
“Hi Missouri,” he squeezed out.“Glad you’re back.”
“Where am I supposed to go, Dad? What am I supposed to do?”  He watched for something: sadness, anger, grief, anything. But if John felt for his eldest anymore he didn’t let it show on his face.
“You do?”
“He’ll catch up eventually: just make sure you’re not going where
you two can somehow reach me before my mind snaps again–”
The two Dean’s square off – one standing calmly with a sly smile on his face, the other tense and poised: a look of cold contempt twisting his features.
“That’s what you think, Deano,” Alistair grins. “It’s going to be an honour to break you. It always is.”
There was so little left of that month for Dean. More and more faded every time. He’d tried to write things down, to make them permanent, but it wasn’t the same. He’d never be able to create words that accurately described Sam’s laugh or the taste of Cas’ lips. Nothing could capture the feeling, the freedom, the happiness of that time.
“Castiel,” his father had abruptly turned serious. “Tonight, I need you at your best behaviour.”
“Yeah I remember – kinda,” Dean frowns.
“Good,” Sam can’t see Cas in the dark (pressing them in tight on either side), but he can hear the relief in his voice. “That was…disconcerting.”
“But –”
He smiles to himself, “As you wish.” Then he vanishes, leaving Dean alone on the stage once more. The audience mutters: some seem annoyed, others seem scared, a few seem pleased. There’s rustling towards the back: and the crowd of Deans begins to part, their faces bearing expressions that seem equal parts surprise, respect and fear.
“Hey, I don’t write the script: I just say my lines. Chuck’s the one who’s got it out for me.”
“Hey,” Sam harrumphs. That prompts a watery chuckle and weak smile as young Dean nods – old Dean beams back.
“What made you decide now was the time?”
He felt shame burning within him, anger too but mostly shame. Shame that he wasn’t strong enough to be himself: shame that he wasn’t brave enough to do it anyway.
The other Harvey has thrown Sam god knows where and Cas headfirst into a giant gravestone with an angel on top (Dean would laugh at the irony if he wasn’t about to die) and currently has his hands in Dean’s chest, cold fingers trying to find his heart.
There were times when he was sure it had to have been longer. Too much had happened, an entire lifetime, to be contained into those short weeks.
The sound of wheels on the road was all the warning they got.
“His broadcast was amazing!” Hester was telling them, the eighth person to bring it up so far. “You must be so happy Castiel.”
“And?”  Sam prompts, oblivious to the effect he’s having.
Inwardly, Sam smiled in relief. Life was much easier when John and Dean got along. The conversation faded as they ate, each of them retreating into their own thoughts.
There’d been no point in going after him, what could they have said? What could they have done? That hadn’t stopped them from trying, of course.  They’d caught site of his small figure, reuniting with his friends at the last bus. They’d had to watch, helpless as he’d climbed on, and the bus had pulled away. He’d get home first.
“I should’ve been there,” Dean’s voice was so soft Sam thought he’d imagined it at first. But when he turned, finally, to look at his brother, he saw that Dean’s face was etched with grief and regret. His eyes were glassy, and he kept them fixed determinedly ahead.
Sam opened his mouth to reply, then closed it again, disturbed by her bluntness.
He smiled at Castiel. “I knew it was worth bringing you here.” He said happily, glad his investment was paying off. “Now, you’re not the only one who had an excitin’ day let me tell you. I got an interesting call from the radio station today...”
“Not a complete idiot,” Sam clarifies hastily. “He knows how this is gonna have to go down: or at least part of him does. We just need to find that part.”
“I’m so sick of that word,” Alistair sighs dramatically. “Sing me a song I haven’t heard before.” Without warning, he steps forwards, plunging his hand into Dean’s chest and pulling.
They wander slowly through the stalls: Cas stopping to examine each and every one, picking up the merchandise and talking to the owners. Most of the stuff is the same stall to stall, but Dean enjoys watching Cas enjoy himself.  He hears Sam settle in beside him.
Dean considers. “I hid it in the dead centre of myself: the part of me where I begin and end,” he says eventually.
“He’s seventeen,  that counts.” John snapped over his shoulder.
Cas rounds on the other Dean. “What have you done?” He snarls.
Dean gets to his feet, trying to brush off the worst of the mud from his clothes. The dirt falls from his clothes and dissolves into nothingness as it hits the floor, and he stops, not really sure if he should even bother anyway. Above him, there’s an ominous grumbling and creaking as the hole leading back to the surface closes up, taking the last of the sunlight with it. Dean ignores the dull dread that’s pooling in his stomach, pushes aside the thought that he’s just trapped himself here and takes stock of his surroundings – unimpressed Bobby included. They’re standing in a long passageway, carved unevenly from bedrock – the floor scored with what could be claw marks or could just be lines. The passage stretches into darkness in either direction. The only light source is the faint red glow seeping through cracks in the rock: dimly illuminating their faces, but leaving puddles of shadows that aren’t actually shadows on the walls. “What were you expecting?” he asks.
right for the first time ever. I finally feel right.”
A few moments pass, in which time nothing really happens – except for the distant sound of an owl hooting, and the unmistakable feel of a breeze along Sam’s neck. Carefully, he and Cas straighten and let go of each other, glancing warily around. They’re outside now, on a long, deserted stretch of road, dimly illuminated by a weak moon and a few stars, with a dark forest of tree trunks on either side. There are no signs or billboards or anything identifiable – just a road.  It, like the bar, is a scene so anonymously familiar that it could be anywhere – or anywhen.
“I don’t know.”
If he saw Cas today, would his heart still dance at the sight of him? The way it had back then? Or would he now just be another face? To be passed over in a crowd. A stranger. The thought pained him more than he could admit.
“Dean this is serious. I don’t know what to do, what to think. Everything’s changed. I don’t know we’re going to get back to normal.”
“You had every right to be upset.”
“You said he
“Sam,” he says, “that’s –”
“You did this for me,” Sam ignores Alistair, ignores the first flashes of pain and the warm bursts of blood. All he lets himself be aware of is Dean. Dean’s shaking hand, his clammy skin, his ragged breaths, the black hole in his chest. “For thirty years you’ve been doing this for me. You always do this for me. This time, let me do this for you. We’ll get through it. We always get through it. Ok?” He meets Dean’s eyes and tries to push everything into them from his own.
“Doesn’t matter: we acted like he was mine. For the first few months, I was so fucking terrified I’d do what Dad did. I couldn’t even tell him to take out the trash without freaking out that I’d been too harsh: that he was only doin’ it because he was scared of me. But I couldn’t explain why, not even to myself. I didn’t even know enough to know that I was scared, I just felt this tension building inside me and I didn’t know when it was going to burst through. Then…” Dean stops again, hands twisting into knots in his lap.  “He and Lisa had a fight about something – I don’t remember what. A school trip maybe.
“Enjoying yourselves Faggots?” one of them called.
Cas takes a deep breath. “I’ve hurt you a lot – in the past,” he says. “And you’ve hurt me. And others have used us to hurt each other – or hurt us to hurt the other. If we are together – and I want us to be together – it will be one more way that those against us (big or small) can exploit us, can hurt us.”
“Just…that was around the same time he really started to lose it. I wonder what happened.”
Dean woke around lunchtime, starving. Missouri set out some lunch for them and kept the conversation light. She could sense Dean didn’t want to talk about what was happening, and she figured he was owed a break at least. He couldn’t hide from the world forever but he deserved a break.
“You never thought for a second Dad would change his mind did you?” Sam asked, dismayed.
“What,” he asks in a slow, even, tone that has Sam tensing on pure instinct alone, “the
“With everything that’s been happening the past year – all the disasters, all the death... we thought it was your type of thing but we didn’t think…” Cassie trails off – her body beginning to shake with suppressed sobs.
literal hell where I stabbed you in the goddamn heart. So
“Yeah well, what would you know about it?” Dean turns away, walking past the dark holes in the wall. He pauses in front of one, considering. Each one is identical to the one before it, and there’s nothing on the walls that gives any clue to when exactly they might be. He stops in front of a random patch of darkness, considering. They must be near the end, if he came in through his grave – which means, at least, there shouldn’t be hordes of demons on the other side. Just something much worse.
So that was it, Castiel realised. He dimly remembered Jim mentioning some friction between Dean and Pastor Walker, this must be where Uriel’s dislike stemmed from. He was certainly the type to hold a grudge.
“Really?” Dean didn’t sound hopeful.
“I wouldn’t say that,” He could already feel himself relaxing around Dean. They had only known each other for a few days but it felt longer. “Uriel has been very...thorough.”
“How did –” Sam begins to ask, but Cas is already walking away. Supressing both a sigh and his curiosity, Sam reaches into the front and taps Dean on the shoulder. “Hey,” he murmurs as Dean begins to shift. “Dean, wake up.”
“These two gentlemen run a...school for boys like you. They
The parishioners bowed their heads as one, and Dean sank back into his own thoughts again. He would ask Anna on Monday.  Anna was pretty, he supposed, and it would make Dad happy. He knew Dad was worried about him, wanted him to take an interest in “normal” things like girls. Perhaps he wouldn’t be so angry all the time if Dean had a girlfriend...
In the pool of the impala’s headlights, they watch Cas shift onto his knees, groaning as he does so and clutching his arms tightly around himself. He wavers for a second, before pitching forward until his forehead is resting on the hard concrete. “Dean,” he mutters, and the voice, though clearly deep in pain, is the appropriate gravel.
“News travels fast round here,” Dean seemed unconcerned. “You get used to it. Besides,” he smiled evilly, “a handsome stranger always attracts attention.”
“Listen to me!” He was sick of listening to the endless appeals to god, he was sick of ‘paths’ and ‘redemption’.
Cas and Sam exchange a glance. “The park is also where the parade will start,” Cas says slowly.
“Dean told you what happened?” he asked when she released him. “Is he here?”
“I can’t. I can’t.”
Dean snorts. “You wish: I’m just a discarded habit from an old life. I’m barely scratching the surface.”
“When were they together?”
“That’s not what I meant.”
Cas felt a weight lift off his shoulders, and he turned to Dean. “Thanks.”
Doubts still crowded the edge of his mind, but he tried to push them aside. He had to trust himself, who else was there?
“It’s nn…” his memory grunts and bucks in pain, the words descending into incoherency.
It had felt so good. Everything had made sense to him. Finally.
“Did Dad know?”
actor, after all.”
“Ah c’mon, when has a Winchester
“That’s hardly fair – you never exactly advertised it.”
Sam and Cas exchange disturbed looks, unable to tell if it’s the spell or Dean talking.
“For what?”
“That’s what I thought about here,” Cas admitted. “I didn’t think about where I was going so long as it wasn’t where I was.”
“Uh yeah, of course.” Did they care about anything other than Jim, he wondered. It didn’t seem like it.
“Yeah, you were a mess,” Dean grins. “And you abandoned me. And before that you’d been crazy, and before that you’d been dead, and before that you’d been evil. In a weird way, Purgatory was the first time I could process it all. I cut my way through half the damn monsters in the place to reach you: you were all I could think about. And when I did fucking finally find you, it was like a piece of my soul slipped back into place. I was angry, I wanted to hate you, but instead everything just felt right again. That’s when I knew,” he swears under his breath, gaze sliding back to the road. “Shit, that was sappy.”
Cas’ head was turned away as Dean approached, he was smiling politely at some well wisher, but he turned and their eyes met.
“I loved humanity from the moment they were created – but I loved them in the way you love the stars, or the flowers. Beautiful, but worlds away. Most angels do, I think, they just don’t like to admit it. They think it makes them weak.”
“Dean Winchester? Studying? Never thought I’d live to see the day” Missouri laughed at the annoyance that flashed in Dean’s eyes. “Don’t get angry at me son you’re smart but lazy and you know it. C’mon, there should a table at the back that ain’t too wobbly.”
Now the silence is awkward – Sam casts about for something to say, and settles on one of the least important questions currently on his mind. “So…you let Cas drive?”
“When we get back,” Cas begins as Dean puts his hand on the door. “I’ll –”
), and
is stretched out on the rack – jagged metal shards piercing cloth, skin, muscles and bones alike, pinning him place. The flesh around the wounds is torn and ragged from where, forgetting himself in his pain, he’s pulled against the bindings. His clothing is indistinguishable from his skin: both are so caked with layers of blood that it’s all just red. There’s much, much more blood than a human can safely lose in life (though this isn’t life of course). Some of it is dull and rusty, long dry, while some is sparkling scarlet – newly spilt.
“Shut up,” Dean says, but there’s a small smile on his lips. Sam can’t see in the dimness, but he’s sure Dean is blushing a little too. “He’s better than you were at least. At least he didn’t almost kill some old lady.”
“You still have a scar there,” Cas murmurs. “I never noticed until now.”
a snake. No, he’s a perverted snake. A faggot snake.
Dad had always burned them all anyway. “Missouri told me.”
“And maybe if you stopped running headfirst into danger,” Cas interjects from the side, voice strained, “you wouldn’t always be the first to get hit.”
that it’s right. I
“Wait,” Dean stops him. “I can’t talk about that…not yet. We will, I promise, just not right now.”
“What about Dean?”
“Dean we don’t blame you for anything that we saw,” Cas takes a step forward. “If anything it’s –”
Missouri raised a sceptical eyebrow, but said nothing.
“Cas what the hell is he talking about?” Sam rounds on the angel immediately.
Dean smiled wanly. “It’s the only high school around, everybody knows everybody. And they’ll definitely know you.”
“Sorry, but you have to admit it’s pretty...”
“No?”
Dean froze. “What?”
“And how are you going to do that exactly?” Sam asks, eyeing the demon dubiously.
He didn’t have to reach for the next memory, it was always there. It would always be there. How was it that the good memories faded while the bad ones refused to leave?
you feel like telling us?” Sam snaps in Dean’s direction, forgetting his earlier warning to Cas.
Cas snorted derisively. “They switch between guilt ridden at not realising I was being ‘tempted’ to awe struck at how my father rescued me from the jaws of sin.” His face fell as he remembered their conversation that morning. “I’m not sure Dad trusts me though, he’s suspicious.”
If you ignored the bruise on Dean’s face; the sadness in Missouri’s eyes and the fact they were eating in a library, it was a normal night. They kept the conversation light, Missouri gave them book recommendations and museums to check out. It was almost as if they were going on holiday, Cas reflected, rather than leaving forever. He wondered if he’d ever see anybody here again. Aside from Missouri and Dean, he realised, there was nobody for him here. No other friends or family. He hoped that, wherever they ended up, there was family to be made.
Dean shook his head. “Nobody: they all live here. Shit,” he swore, “we are so fucked.”
closing the kitchen? You. Has hell frozen over?” She was looking at Sam with equal parts awe and suspicion. “Just who is this guy?”
“With no telling what we’ll see.”
Sam doesn’t need to ask who: the whole scenario is achingly familiar to him. He adjusts his hold so that he’s gripping Cas’ forearms, both to comfort him and to hold him back when Dean lets out his own gasp of pain and surprise. “We can’t do anything –” he says, though it kills him to say it, and he knows he’s a hypocrite for saying it. “ – Except try and stay out of the way. Let’s not make it any more painful or confusing than it already was.”
“And bad?”
“Do you have faith in the Lord?” His father’s voice cut through din, and Cas flinched at the sound of it.
“we can get jobs...” Cas faltered, the gaps in his plan were becoming clearer and clearer. But still, anything was better than staying here.
“No? Well I’m the only one that’s ever tried to do something about it at least.”
“Let’s get comfortable,” he tells Cas. “There’s no telling how long this will take.”
“How many times I gotta ask you to call me Missouri? All this ‘Ms Moseley’ nonsense makes me feel old.” Missouri’s eyes twinkled comfortingly as she regarded the two boys. “An’ I’m fine, thanks for askin'. It’s been quiet here, but that’s to be expected,” she turned to Cas, “Your Daddy’s none too pleased with me so people’ve been keeping their distance.”
“No it’s not Dean,” John had sighed. “I expected you to be an adult after Mary’s death: I treated you as if you were. I was so worried that you’d lost your way. Instead of trying to help you back onto the right path, I pushed you further into the mud.” He’d managed a weak smile. “But, you’re back on track now Son, I know I don’t have to worry about you anymore. I’m proud of you.”
“Thank you Uriel, but I’m fine here.” Castiel said coldly. Uriel’s face twisted into a strange grimace. It took the boys a second to realise he was smiling.
“I don’t care. You’re gone, you understand me? One way or the other, you’re gone.” His voice was flat, controlled. Yet it was more threatening than his shouts had ever been.
“An’ folks, this wasn’t no Coppermouth nor was it a Diamondback; it was much, much more dangerous. See, those snakes don’t pretend to be anything but what they are. This snake, he hides in plain sight. He pretends to be just like you an’ me. But he ain’t like you an’ me. An’ just like the serpent that ensnared Eve all those years ago, he’s here to tempt you, to take you from the Lord’s loving hands and damn you to hell for all eternity, except he’s worse. Because he ain’t
“He’s, uh, he’s not coming back either.”

Dean’s raised head was a blond beacon of heresy, but he refused to look away from Cas. He was hoping for a repeat of last week, when their eyes had first met. He wasn’t sure what he could convey in a single glance, but he had to try.  Castiel’s head remained resolutely bowed until he heard his father’s “Amen”.
“Thanks Jimmy.” John’s face was a mask of righteous fury, “To think of all the years I wasted on that boy. All the years Mary spent loving him...” for a brief moment, grief flickered over his face. Then it was gone, and the eyes were hard again. “Truth be told, it almost makes me glad Mary’s not here to see this. It would’ve broken her heart.”
“What?” Cas was aghast  “How can you want to stay after all this?”
Sam barely hears him over the rushing in his ears. He coughs and feels blood spill down his chin, tears down his cheeks. The world around them is fading – everything is shrinking to the agony in his chest as Dean hacks and slices and carves and…
“Then don’t. There’s got to be another way. There’s
“Turn left here,” Sam says instead of answering. “And go slow.”
“Sammy...” Dean began, but Uriel cut him off.
“Call Sam and Cas,” Bobby pleads. “You don’t have to do this alone.”
Pain and fear flicker across Dean’s face in equal measure. It’s clear he wants nothing more than to help, but still, he hangs back, hand drifting towards his waistband, eyeing the prostrate figure in front of him suspiciously.
“I thought so too Cas,” Dean said mournfully. “But, it’s only been four days and I’m exhausted. I need Sam back,  I need you back.”
Castiel felt like a visiting Statesman, Uriel led him from kid to another; everyone of them seemed to be expecting something of him. He did all he could do: he shook hands, smiled, and listened politely as they gushed about his father.
“We know,” he calls from the audience, “but tough shit. When has it ever been easy for us? When has hiding ever worked? Let’s just get it over with: rip the band aid off.”
He had barely taken 4 steps in, when a vice-like pair of arms wrapped around his chest. “What the hell you doin’ back here you foolish boy?”
Sam stopped, but didn’t say anything.
There’s a flicker of movement, and Dean is wrenched upwards by John’s hand clutched bruisingly tight around his arm. His feet scramble desperately for purchase on the ground, John the only thing keeping him upright. “You think you know better than me?” He’s pulled Dean close to his face so he can whisper – but Cas can hear him as clearly as if he were in Dean’s position. “You think you can question
The skin, and muscles have been carved away, the ribs ripped out and discarded carelessly on the ground. Dean’s heart (the source of the erratic beating) pulses furiously – fluttering and convulsing as his lungs expand faintly as he’s forced to watch it all. Now that they’re close, they can hear his shallow, frantic breaths.
“Where
As the sun crept reluctantly over the horizon, Dean headed back to the house. Sam would be waking up soon.  Then it would be time for school, he could see Castiel again.
The vitriol in voice shocked Castiel, as did the blatant rudeness of his comment. Dean was smiling same as ever at Uriel, but his fists were clenched under the desk and his eyes had darkened somehow.
“No point prayin’ to him,” Dean says bitterly, pulling a t-shirt on roughly over his head. “He ain’t gonna do jack fucking shit.”
“What’s this got to do with anything?” Sam demands, “I wasn’t even there for most of it. Neither of us was.”
“Huh?” Dean turns to look at him, eyes quickly sharpening as he comes awake. “Hey, Sammy.”
“You know what I need to hear before I can do that.”
“You’re right about that. Human beings are stronger together, never alone. But even with two of you, it can get lonely.” He hadn’t believed her at the time, he couldn’t believe her. He hadn’t understood then what it meant to be alone.
“Well we’re back to where we started then aren’t we?” Alistair tugs casually on a piece of metal embedded in Dean’s arm, and he screams – exposed heart fluttering. Sam flinches, Alistair notices.
“Sam.”
“Did he now?” Dean sighs. “I guess he wanted the first shake at the heart to heart game.”
“Not deliberately,” Dean says quickly, putting his hand on Sam’s wrist and squeezing until Sam’s fingers relax. “And not consciously either – I don’t think. It was just like, if I was being slow or not doing what he ordered he’d ask you to do it instead. He started taking you on hunts with us and I couldn’t let you get hurt, so it was easier to just do what he said and not think too much about it. He didn’t really care who did it – he just wanted it done.”
Dean rolled his eyes and moved slowly, as if it cost him a great effort, across the room to shake Jim and Castiel’s hands. “It’s truly blessed to see you today Father,” he intoned monotonously.
“How is it that you two always know exactly what I need?” Dean asks playfully, leaning back into the man’s touches.
Neither was quite willing to move yet, so Dean compared the barren, empty lawn in front of him to the space in his memories. When Mom was still alive, there had been rose bushes in the now empty beds. They had withered into skeletons alongside her, with nobody able to tend to them. Now even the brittle branches were gone, and only dust remained.  More to distract himself from such a dour line of thought, he forced himself out the car. Sam scrambled out after him, and they warily ascended the steps to the front door.
“Did you ever –” Cas begins to ask, but Dean cuts him off with a shake of his head.
“No,” Dean cuts him off flatly. “You weren’t. If I can ‘t lie here then neither can you.”
“Yes but,” Cas pauses, “only with you.”
“I don’t have much time,” Cas says to Dean. “He’s going to come back soon and I have something I want – no,
“Well maybe if I’d also drastically re-altered my psyche through magic I’d be crying too.”
“Dean, do us all a favour and get some clean shirts.” Sam said from across the room. He was already fully dressed and his eyes were disgustingly bright considering the time. Dean made a face at him.
“Is that what you got into fights about?” he asked, gently.  When all Castiel could do was nod, Dean squeezed his arm in sympathy. “Idiots, that’s all they were.” He assured Cas, “fuck ‘em.”
“We have literally no way of knowing how much – if anything – it’s said so far is true,” Cas surmises.
,” he whispers urgently. “I do. What you described…it’s all I can think about sometimes. I just never thought it would be something an angel could ever want. It’s so…human. So small.”
“Cas,” he said softly, but the other boy was too distraught to hear him.
“Well he needs to show his new catch off while he can,” Dean explained bitterly. “Before you outshine him and become homecoming king or whatever.”
“What the fuck am I doing here?”
Dean was the one to break the silence. “Who was the girl?”
“You mean this is because of the spell? Like some weird side effect?”
Dean pulls back – just to breathe – then kisses him again. And again. And again. Each time is exactly the same as the one before it – except that they’re each totally different. Each kiss brings that same rush, that same joy, even as the physical particularities change. The closest feeling Cas can remember – the only feeling somewhat comparable – is the moment of his own creation (back when everything was created) when, for one brief second, he had been everything all at once. Every possible shape, every possible thought, colour, action, wish, dream, desire – he had felt them all, had been them all until suddenly he wasn’t anymore. Until now.
“...just go. It’s only for a night: no big deal.” Sam’s room now. This wasn’t about the library – that’d been a no go – this was a few days (maybe a week?) later.
Worry gnawed at him as he watched the clock. The second hand ticked by with agonizing slowness, the minute hand didn’t seem to move at all. His impotence at the situation stung. He couldn’t just sit here, doing nothing while Dean was out there doing god knew what. But Missouri was right, of course, them being seen together would only make everything worse. He was searching for batteries when he heard the door open.
“You cold?” Dean asks instantly. “We should probably head home.”
Then Dean is stumbling, arms grasping air, as the witch’s house slides back into place around them – the witch’s body lying in a pool of blood at their feet.
“Keep Sammy safe,” Dean intones, still not looking at John.
Cas embraced him, feeling the shake of Dean’s shoulders as he tried to suppress his sobs. “If we’re together, we’ll always be ok,” he murmured softly. “We’re enough.”
“Everything else?”
“It’s been awhile since I was here,” he said.
There were nods in the crowd, murmurs of agreement.
“I’m being serious, Dean!”
“What? But I said –”
“Everyone’s friends round here.” Jim replied wryly. He thought for a moment. “John Winchester’s a good man; he’s always done right by the church. Last year his wife, Mary, died, and he had a hard time dealing with it. They were sweethearts since the 6th grade practically, meant to be. He didn’t know how to function without her. Still doesn’t.”
Dean’s eyes crinkle and he laughs softly. “Yeah: course. Do you, uh, wanna drive somewhere else? I think it’ll be easier in the car.”
“Can’t think of anything more you,” Dean says, stepping beside Cas as he turns to pay. “Wait did you just pay $15 for that?” He shakes his head, winding his arm around Cas’ waist and determinedly not looking at Sam. “Christ this place is such a rip-off.”
“Then we meet at the bus station?”

“And if you do see someone falling to sin, do not despair. Christ is love, and he will accept any past sinner once they have renounced their evil ways. But,” his tone darkened abruptly, and his voice began to rise again, “if they refuse redemption, if they refuse God, then we must be strong. Once someone has refused forgiveness they ain’t a child of god anymore, they’re a child of sin, of the devil himself. Do not think you can save them, for you may end up damning yourself.

. “It’s me,” he says as looks down at himself. There are few scratches on his face and arms, blood splatters on his shirt and a haunted look in his eyes, but otherwise he seems unhurt. “More or less.”.
“No, I don’t want to hurt you.”
“Huh?”
“I think it was my grace – reacting to your presence,” Cas explains. “I didn’t realise you’d also be able to sense it.”
Eventually, however, they were left in relative seclusion. Missouri retreated to her desk, though occasionally her eyes would drift back to the curious sight.
“Well I’m as close as you’re gonna get.”
Sam and Cas share another quick look. “Fine,” Cas says, exasperated, Sam nodding along with him. “We won’t force you to talk about it here.”
…everything falls away. The rack, the chains, the knife all vanish. Sam collapses to the ground, clutching at his chest. When he raises a shaking hand to his face, swimming in and out of focus, the fingers are clean and dry. Before he really has time to process anything, something is pulling him roughly to his feet.
For the first time in a long time, Castiel actually prayed.
an exit?” Dean wants to know, sounding gloomy. “We might just be stuck in here forever.”
of your stupidity and arrogance.”
“I don’t think that would be an appropriate use of my powers, Dean.”
“What do you mean?” Cas was intrigued now. All the adults in town (and the kids too) seemed to worship his father, it would be refreshing to meet someone who didn’t.
“I said almost.” A breeze from the lake passes through them. Sam pulls his jacket closer, shivering slightly.
“Put it back,” Cas hisses, trying to free his arms and pick it up, his voice barely audible over Dean’s heaving sobs. “Put it back you vile –”
“How did you do that?” Cas asks.
“Good.” She stood briskly, back in librarian mode. “Now, Dean, I know Sam don’t want to see me no more but I just got in the latest Vonnegut, and he
“Just some kid,” Dean says dismissively, hoping fervently that Sam hadn’t heard any of their conversation. “Did you know it costs forty bucks to get in here? What kind of scam are they running?” he ploughs on before either have a chance to answer. “Did you guys pick up anything?”
“Why not?” Cas demands.
“And we have a long way to go, I think,”
“Uh-huh?”
Sam stares at the writhing mass of flesh and hands for a few seconds, then whirls around so fast he almost collides with Cas, who is squinting towards the bed in confusion.
“It’s nice to see you too.”
Sam met the eyes of one customer, a bearded man about Dean’s age, and looked away quickly when the man winked. “Well do they have to be so open?”
It takes another fifteen minutes of unbearably loaded eye contact before he cracks.
He had finally caught a glimpse of the raven haired boy, descending the church steps alone. The service was long over, but Dean had hung around as the crowd outside the doors slowly depleted. He had drawn some odd looks, he wasn’t exactly known for his piety after all, but no one had asked him what he was doing.
“You don’t have to do that John, I only did what the Lord expected of me, and I would’ve done it anyway. Mary was such a bright woman...her passing has truly darkened the world.”
“Where would you go?”
to understand it for a long time either – it made things too complicated. But the more time I was around you – and other humans – the harder it became to ignore.”
“Yes.”
“That’s different, the dance didn’t mean anything.” Dean insisted stubbornly. “Marriage though... It’s better to be alone than to be with someone you don’t love.”
Dean shakes his head. “Not a fucking clue.”
) from the booth nearest the door smiled at him and Sam jerked his eyes away.
Even so, he found sleep elusive that night. When he did, eventually, drift off his dreams were fitful, uneasy.
“I’m...Sorry.” it was all he could think to say. Dean shook his head furiously, rubbing the back of his covered hand across his face.
“I’m sorry Dean. I’m sorry.”
“And how’s that worked out for you so far?” Dean asked wryly.
The Pastor was taking his sweet time, letting the excitement and anticipation build. When he did eventually emerge, Dean expected to hear cheers and claps, as if he were a rock star and not some small town priest. Instead, an expectant silence swept in waves through the crowd. By the time Jim reached his podium, the hall was silent. Waiting.
Dean’s only answer is to spit in his face. Sam’s breath freezes in his throat and it’s only the distant awareness that this has already happened that stops his fear for Dean overwhelming all sensible thought.  There’s dead silence as the blood-soaked saliva spatters Lucifer’s (Cas’) cheek and begins to ooze slowly down. With a stunned expression that would be comical if it weren’t also so deadly, Lucifer raises his fingers to his face, as if he can’t actually believe what has just happened. Dean takes the opportunity to throw himself to the side, rolling away and managing to spring to his feet with surprising speed and agility. He reaches back and pulls a knife – an angel blade – from his waistband in one smooth movement, breaths heavy but steady. The presence of a weapon, however ineffectual it may turn out to be, between him and Lucifer seems to steady him. Lucifer regards him, a slight smile pulling at his still bloodied lips.
“I have to stay. For Sammy. He’s already lost Mom, he can’t lose me too.” Dean’s voice was firm, but toneless. His face expressionless, shaking shoulders were the only sign of emotion.
“Then wouldn’t the
“Oh yeah? Lockin’ yourself away, keeping Sam and Cas out? What kinda strategy is that?” Bobby crosses his arms.
“Ah you’ll learn.” Jim dismissed him with a wave of the hand. “’sides it’s a nice touch, I fix their souls: you fix their engines.”
“Something like that,” Cas replies, perhaps a little hoarsely.
Sam allows himself to be pushed onto the sofa, Cas perching uncertainly beside him as Dean fusses with the TV. It only takes him a few seconds of muttered swearing before the title appears on screen. “Move your ass Sammy,” he orders – squeezing himself between Sam and Cas. “And Cas: relax. It’s a movie, not an exam.”
“You’re such a pessimist Dean. The universe hasn’t got it out for you; it hasn’t got it out for anybody.”
“Those bastards...”
Jim’s attention snapped back to his son. “No son, you need to listen. Not to me, not to that Winchester fag but to God. You know what you’re doing is bad, you just ain’t accepted it. And by doin that you ain’t just taking yourself to hell, you’re hinderin my efforts to save others. You think anyone’s gonna listen to a Preacher with a queer for a son?  Stop thinkin of just yourself.”
“Don’t you have literally anything else to do?” Dean had asked as she approached.  Hael had ignored him, as was her custom, focussing entirely on Castiel.
A small noise has Sam turning to look at the other Dean – still rooted to the spot. He’s been so quiet all this time that Sam had forgotten he was there. There are tears trailing silently down his face as he watches his younger self, dripping off his chin and onto the floor. Sam’s eyes upon him seems to snap him out of whatever state he’s been in, for he wipes the tears away, nodding at whatever it is he needs to see in Sam’s gaze. He walks forward until he’s in front of his younger self and kneels down so they’re at eye level. “Hey,” he says softly. “Can I show you something?”
“C’mon Bobby, keep up,” Dean throws over his shoulder, striding through the forest. “We haven’t got all day.”
angry, for so long and you were god only knows where going through god only knows what while I was sat at home listening to the bullshit Pastor Novak and everyone else was spinning,” It was hard to fit ten years worth of apologies into one sentence –he knew his words were becoming jumbled – but he had to try.
“Castiel wait,” Missouri grabbed his hand, stopping him in his tracks. “You’re right, but if you go to him it’ll only cause trouble.”
“He’s hurting, Dad. Really bad. I just want to help him find peace” he tried to inject the words with the moral  superiority that had made him want to punch Uriel. He worried he may have gone overboard with it, but his father was convinced.
Tentatively, Sam takes another drag – managing to keep from coughing this time. The ghost of their father floats in the smoke between them. “Why didn’t you ever tell me?”
His brother let out a breath, running a hand through his hair. “I don’t know Sammy,” he confessed, “God knows I miss Cas but,” he sighed again, “who knows where he is, or
“What do you mean? I’m still me, Dad, I’m still Dean.”
Sam registers these gruesome but expected details quickly, his mind pushing them to the periphery of his perception – he can come back to them once the focal points are processed.
Cas moves first, pulling the door fully open and stepping into the dark. Sam follows, but pauses on the threshold of the doorway. “What do you do next?” he asks, almost despite himself.
Dean shrugs, the movement propelling him into a disembodied and headless torso, spilling it’s drink over a floating hand next to it. “Sorry,” he lurches back. “I dunno where I am, but –” he drops the pool cue and fumbles in his pockets, wrestling car keys from his jeans. “– I’ll help you look for me. Alwayss happy to help. C’mon, let’s get to the car.” He takes a lurching step, and Sam automatically jumps forward to support him – taking the familiar weight on his shoulder as he has a million times before and will do a million times again.
“Now why would I do that?” Dean laughs, “I finally have him right where I want him.” Cas lunges with the blade, but it passes straight through, leaving only a faint puff of green smoke in its wake. Dean (both Deans) disappear: the frozen memory disintegrating into nothingness, the spell melting away.
“No.” He had answered without thinking, but Castiel knew instantly it was true. “I...” he thought about his father’s sermon, the anger he had felt. “I think... I thought I knew what was right and wrong; I thought I knew what God wanted. But... it all comes from my father, and what he thinks. What we did... when we kissed, it felt right to me. But according to everyone else, it’s wrong.”
“So the exit…”
“I love you, Dean.” Cas gasps out.
“I’m not gonna lie to you son, it won’t be easy. You’ll need to do a lot to make up for your transgressions against god”.
“Idjit,” says a gruff voice, and Dean looks up in surprise as Bobby elbows his way to the front. He’s greyer than he was in life, and slightly more wrinkled; trucker cap somehow more battered. He looks, Dean figures, how he thinks Bobby would look today. Or maybe he looks how Dean treated him as looking. “You know that’s exactly what the spell wants.”
“Yeah,” Dean wipes his face with the back of his hand and they start moving again.
“You watch your tone with me boy, I’m your father and you owe me–”
“Why don’t we start,” Pastor Novak began, voice controlled, “by havin’ Uriel tell you two what he saw?”
Stumbling, Sam and Cas make their way to the door. Cas passes over the threshold instantly, but Sam hesitates for a second – risking one last glance back. The Demon is the only Dean left, slowly dissolving yet seemingly unconcerned by his own fragmentation.
“And do you think you’ve done a good job keeping him safe?”
say it. Yes, what?”
“Scared of what?”
“Oh really?” Dean raised his eyebrows in mock surprise. “I wonder why? I heard you got a girlfriend though so congrats!”
“You know, I don’t think I will,” Alistair drifts back to Dean and rests a bloody hand on his heaving shoulder. “Not when I think we’re finally making progress.” As he speaks, the tone of Dean’s cries begins to shift. Slowly, then all at once, the pain gives way to laughter – hard and hysterical. It bounces and echoes off the air around them, multiplying and surrounding them like a hyena pack, circling from the shadows.
Pls heed that some of the warnings have changed, there's a spoliery trigger warning in the end notes xx
“’K good,” Dean breathes an exaggerated sigh of relief. “’Cos, lemme tell ya, I don’t wanna go through that ag-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g –” his voice catches abruptly, repeating on a rapid loop – as if it’s playing on an old, scratched CD.
“You think I’m not keeping Sam safe?” John asks, ignoring Dean’s words, pressing down on his chest until Dean is grimacing in pain. “You think you know even a fraction of what I do to protect you boys? What I’ve sacrificed so your worthless ass could mouth off at me? Do you know how many times I’ve had to cover you? Do both our jobs so you could go off and play video games or nap in the sun? That
He stood, casting one last futile glance behind. There was no one there of course.
Uriel, it seemed, had been assigned as Cas’ permanent guard. It reminded him of his first few days, before he knew Dean, except worse.
“We’re sorry,” Sam says, and means it. “But we can’t just forget, and neither can you.”
“Felt what.”
Sammy is. Like a giraffe or something, right?”
“Where are we?” Sam asks hastily, thinking an indirect path might be more effective.
Sam looked disappointed but stood to go. Feeling slightly awkward, Castiel followed the brothers out through the kitchen and into their back yard. It was another square of forlorn looking grass, a few balls strewn haphazardly about. A small gate at the bottom led onto a river bank. The water moved sluggishly in the evening heat.
Dean’s jaw twitched, though his eyes remained flat and unreadable. “Yeah, I understand,” his voice too was expressionless as he dug in his pockets and pulled out his car keys, chucking them towards Sam without looking at him. Then he turned and walked out the house, slamming the front door behind him.
manage, I won’t even want to come with you anyway, meaning you’ll be stuck in here forever. I’m just here to make things easier. For you and for me,” his voice is almost kind.
She’d meant what she’d said (Bert and Ernie
“No!” she says, crossing her arms tightly over her chest. “I was only…look, don’t call it ‘copulating’ like we’re watching the discovery channel or something, it’s creepy! I just… you don’t want to die a virgin, do you?”
“No,” Cas points to Dean’s chest, where his anti-possession tattoo is clearly visible, “it’s more recent than that.”
“You are
“Your boy ok there John?” he called across the church good naturedly, “or did the Holy Spirit get caught in his throat?” the whole parish laughed as Sam, bright red and still coughing weakly, tried to hide from the stares.
“Yeah I know what you said,” Dean cut him off, perfectly happy not to be reminded of the details. “But you were thirteen: a fucking idiot, like you said. Besides what could you have done? I didn’t want you to go through what I went through: that’s why I left,” he squeezed Sam’s arm, “and you’re here now, that’s the important part.” He waited patiently for Sam to finally meet his eyes again. Sam found them as warm and open as they were in his memories. It was as if a piece of him had been returned: one he hadn’t realised was missing until he had it back. He wondered how he had survived this long without it. He had his big brother again.
“Who was that girl you were talking to?” Castiel asked as they emerged into daylight. “Your girlfriend?”
town: you’n Missouri still like me, right?”
Cas kissed him back with an almost reverent gentleness, amazed at the gift he had been granted. The weight that hand hung upon his shoulders for nearly ten years had transformed into a soaring, lifting joy.
Sam’s shoulders slump slightly in defeat. “No, no: of course not. But will you at least tell me why you didn’t just stay the night?”
“You’re not sleeping in there.” John informed him. “You are not to go near my son, especially while he’s sleeping. Use your own bed like a goddam man.” The words stung more than anything Dean had heard that night, which was saying something.
“No you didn’t,” Bobby mutters darkly. “How many times’ve you died now?”
He didn’t have a destination as he ran through empty streets. It felt wrong somehow, that the Sun was shining yet no one was outside – he felt like the last person on earth.  Except he could still feel their eyes on him, burning through his coat, his shirt, his skin, right down to his soul – all brimming with hatred.
“So?”
“Cas?” Sam reaches out to grab his shoulder, simultaneously turning his head to see whatever it is that Cas is seeing.
Jim grabbed his shoulders, pulling his face in close. “You don’t understand, boy. This is not a negotiation: this is
Dean was laughing so hard he nearly tipped over, and he slung an arm round Castiel to steady himself. The easy contact shocked both boys and they drew apart abruptly. Avoiding Castiel’s eyes, Dean couldn’t understand why his heart was beating so fast. He risked a glance to his right and saw that Castiel too was blushing. He opened his mouth, though he didn’t know what he was going to say, when a boyish shout saved him the trouble.
Pain. All there is is Pain. Pain and blood. Enough to drown in, except that he’s learned how to breathe in it. Pain and blood and Alistair. Alistair crooning above him, sawing with a tenderness so paradoxical it’s enough to make Dean laugh – or try to laugh. All that comes out is a sob. A sob and some blood.
Before Dean could say anything, he turned and ran back towards the town.
“Oh,” Cas finally checks his phone. “He sent me a text two hours ago asking me to do the same.”
“No,” Cas’ mouth presses into a thin line. “He was always special that way.”
“You’re a little too late here pumpkin,” it mocks him, “What you’re lookin’ for is 8 doors down thattaway,” He jerks his head to the left, smiles, and a section of his cheek corrodes, so the smile reaches all the way back. “Though why not just skip to the end and join the fun? You know how it is down here. We could always use an extra pair of –”
“We didn’t change them,” Cas corrects him. “We can’t change the past. We altered your perception of them – of yourself.”
“’Cos that’s where Missouri is, c’mon.”
Sam’s face had lit up when Dean had agreed to go to church with them again. John had smiled too, and everything had felt normal for a second.
“No,” Sam says slowly. “You’re scared. And stretched to your limit. You wouldn’t’ve brought
“I can’t wait to meet her. What happened with the books?”
“So you said.”
“Why tell me about the women then?”
Dean forced himself to stay calm. It would just be for tonight, John was hot headed but he cooled off with a good night’s sleep. He would be fine one night on his own.
“Well I did carry a magically personified version of my psyche out of its metaphorical cage – that’s probably worth about twenty years of therapy.”
Dean feels hot around the ears. “Oh.”
Cas,” Sam’s hands bunch into fists at his sides, his own eyes glittering dangerously. “And the way he looked at me – like I’d shot him or something. Destroyed his whole fucking world. You honestly think he still doesn’t feel any of that?
“Yeah,” Dean smiled. “Tomorrow”
If Cas had known those would be his last words to Dean, he’d have tried to make them more meaningful.
“Dean I’m sorry,” Sam says immediately.
. They were free, for a time, from the constant fear; from looking over their shoulders; from checking both sides of the road before holding hands.
“Yeah,” it’s Dean’s turn to sneer – face twisted and bloody but still proud. “We beat you last time, we’ll do it again.”
“No…” Dean grunts. “Let go – you’re
“How do I look?”
“Well if I can’t make you renounce your sins, I’ll find someone who can.” The threat was too naked to be anything but serious. It was offset by a gentle hand on his shoulder. He flinched. “Son,” Jim’s voice was soft, loving. “You’ll make things so much easier if you just admit what Dean’s done to you was wrong. Just think about what’s happened. You’ll soon see the truth”
“Then folks, let us pray...” He lowered his voice and the rolling crowd calmed under his artful control. “Guide me, O thou great redeemer, Pilgrim through this barren land; I am weak, but thou art mighty...”
hear from us again. Let me live my life.”
Sam’s instinctual wave of shock is almost instantly superseded by an even larger wave of joy which is quickly eclipsed by a veritable tsunami of dread.
“They found out.” It wasn’t a question.
“Yeah, well, it’s nothin’ I ain’t heard before. It’s fine.”
“I guess…I guess, I like having somethings for myself…moments between everything else,” Dean hesitates, his face a mixture of embarrassment and something else. There’s clearly more he’s fighting hard not to say as he clenches his hands into fists at his sides. He looks so young, vulnerable and unguarded that, all at once, Cas is acutely aware that Sam is currently the older brother.
how much of me that is. And when I broke, it was like my world ended,” he laughs hollowly, “and then I got out and I found out that the world
“It was a nice night,” Sam smiled as the memory came flooding back. “It was my junior prom and Dad was thrilled that I was taking her that he even let me drive the car by myself…” he faltered, as what he was saying caught up with him.
Dean ignores him. Dimly, he can already see the road ahead: just a re-run of the road so far, paved (he knows) with the best of intentions and leading straight too…
“Like this is the end. Of you. Of –”
gay) and she hasn’t been fucked in a long time so it’s two birds with one stone, really. Plus, they can finally get that stick out of Cas’ ass by getting him into her – and maybe some divine intervention (penetration?) will chase out the last of the demon smoke and whoever else she’s been carrying inside herself since she was fifteen. And it’s not like Cas isn’t good looking, and it’s not like she hasn’t noticed a flash or spark or something in his eyes during all those meaningful gazes (and unlike all the other men that’ve been looking at her recently, she doesn’t smell sulphur on Cas’ breath) so it’s not like he won’t enjoy this either. The whisky probably helps in this respect – gives her the certainty she needs to get to her feet.
“What in the Hell you doing out here?” she didn’t sound angry, just worried.
“Cas,” Dean’s voice was hoarse with emotion when they finally broke apart. “I didn’t think I’d ever see you again.”
“Well,” Dean says once he’s caught his balance and his breath. “At least we don’t have to worry about that.”
“I never!”
The other boy shrugged. “Don’t mention it, I’m the one who made it awkward to begin with. Shall we get out of here?” Castiel nodded, and they made for propped open door at the back of the gym. It led out onto the football pitches.
much, but here I am – twelve years later still expecting my big brother to come in and make everything better,” He shook his head.  “I made you choose between family and safety. I made it so you could only be my brother again on my terms. I thought I needed exactly the family I’d had as a kid, and I didn’t ever stop to think what that family would cost you. And it took me dragging you halfway across the country to realise I already have all the family I need.”
“I know it might sound wrong, it might even sound hateful. But see, he ain’t really a person anymore. He’s refused every opportunity to return to the Lord. He clearly relishes the dark depravities of hell. An’ that’s where he belongs.”
John just nodded, satisfied by Dean’s normalcy for now. Dean stared out the window, trying to think of how to approach this. It would have been so much easier if he liked Anna; or anyone really. He’d seen the movies, even read the books. He was supposed to want steal the moon for them, or hide it lest it make them feel ugly. He’d seen the way Dad stared at Mom, the same in every photo whether they were twelve or thirty. He’d never met any girl that made him feel like that.
With a snarl, Dean lunges for Lucifer with the blade, but it passes through empty air. A second later, it crashes to the ground as Dean drops to his knees, staring at the spot where Lucifer had stood.
“Yes,” Cas says irritably. “The spell was designed to trap us: it’s going to use anything it can find to distract or hinder us from finding the exit and to keep us from accessing it,
“There are cigarettes in the glove box: do you want one?”
There were too many cars parked on the driveway. Cas tried to remember if Jim had mentioned an interview or meeting for today. It wasn’t the kind of thing his father would neglect to tell him, especially if there were photographers. Still, this would probably make it easier for Castiel: if Jim was entertaining guests he wouldn’t notice that Cas had gone until it was too late.
“Sam still thinks you’re a good man, deep down,” Dean shrugged, the movement lifting him from the doorframe so that he stood tall and straight. “Sure is sad to see him proved wrong.”
“Pastor Jim!” He beamed, “come in, dinner’ll be about 5 minutes ‘k?”
“You can’t stay here Dean, you have to know that.” She forced herself to meet his horrified stare, she wouldn’t look away.
Dean feels his face heat. “Well, thanks for listening I guess.”
“Leave it Sam,” insists the old (young) Dean. “We’re nearly there.” He starts walking again, and Cas begins to follow. Sam and the other Dean, however, remain in place.
Cas, the Cas beside Sam, frowns. “I don’t remember this happening,” he says. “I never…”
Cas wasn’t sure if he wanted to hug Dean for his altruism or slap him for his  disregard of his own safety. “Don’t be stupid Dean, I’m not throwing you under the bus. I have a plan. I think we can get out.”
“Isn’t it?” Dean asked. “I’m the outcast, the weird one. I know what everyone says about me. I don’t know why she said yes in the first place.” His voice cracked, and something in Cas broke. He wanted to scream at the school, at the town, at the world, for doing this to Dean. He wanted to protect him from them, to save him.
They’d laughed at that. Even now, the remembered sound could brighten Dean’s mood. He’d wanted to do something, to make it up to Sam. Sam hadn’t known then, he hadn’t known that Dean had already abandoned him. Neither of them knew, yet.
“Thank you.” Cas was already halfway across the room. Dean was curled up on an old sofa, his face twisted into a grimace at an unpleasant dream.
“Thank you,” he replied stiffly. Uriel was watching him expectantly, wanting something more explicit.
“Don’t,” she says into his skin. “Please. I’m fine. I promise. I’m fine.”
“You lied to me son, you lied this whole time.” Jim’s voice shook.
The lighter in Sam’s hand flickers out, plunging them back into darkness, allowing them to move again.
“Oh yeah?”
Something waivers at the edge of his consciousness – a brief flash of blue, like the sky. He tries to focus on it, and the rack seems to fade away. Memories begin to flicker in front of his eyes – fast like stop motion. A hunt, a witch, Bobby – trying to tell him something. What had it been? What had he said?
“You aren’t even sorry are you?” Sam asked, ignoring his words. “Why aren’t you sorry Dean?”
There was a light in the distance, making its way towards him.
Dean didn’t hear a word of what Pastor Walker was saying. A sense of foreboding had settled over him, and he silently urged Gordon to talk longer. Anything to avoid whatever was coming next. He didn’t know where it was coming from, this dread, but it filled his ears with his heartbeat as he forced himself to stay seated. Every cell in his body wanted to be somewhere else right now but he had to stick to the plan.
Sam doesn’t know what to do. He doesn’t want to look anymore. He can’t turn away. He wants to be sick but he can barely even breathe. There’s a horrible gagging sound. It’s coming from his mouth. His hand is on Cas’ shoulder, and he faintly hears the angel’s gasp of pain as he squeezes hard enough to bruise, but he can’t do anything except squeeze harder.
“Hi Ms. Moseley, how you been?” Dean had always liked librarian, though he rarely saw her. She was practically hermit, rarely leaving the library, except to walk to her small house a few streets down. Her husband worked out of town and tended to stay away for weeks at a time.
“I don’t care: if he doesn’t think love is right then he’s wrong.”
, y’know?”
“...ck to bed Sammy.” That was John
Sam and Cas, as the door flies off its hinges. It hits the ground with a large metallic clang and then dissipates into nothing, leaving only vaguely scorched grass.
“Castiel,” Pastor Walker began, tone measured. “Your father has some...concerns about your recent behaviour.”
“Yeah,” Dean admits and his voice cracks slightly. Immediately, Jonah embraces him, arms encircling him tightly.   Dean brings his arms up and around, clutching onto Jonah tightly. It’s a moment so tender and intimate, that both Sam and Cas have to look away – even moreso than the earlier sex, watching this moment feels like the ultimate invasion of Dean’s privacy.
“What?”
please enjoy this sequel that i did not intend to write but somehow also ended up writing?
Much to Sam’s surprise (and, he suspects, disappointment) Dean has actually been to a pride parade before.
Dean shrugs. “What’s one more wound?”
“I thought we wouldn’t have to pretend anymore, I thought our love would be enough.”  Cas lamented.
Missouri cut him off with a wave of her hand. “Please, who else could you be?” She smiled kindly at him. “Don’t worry, I don’t hold it against you, I prefer the quiet anyway. Now, I suppose you boys are needin’ books for Sam? He ain’t been here in a while so I know he’s finished the last lot.”
“Sam?” Dean took a step forward, heart sinking as Sam took one back. “Sammy, what’s wrong?”
“No Sir.”
“But our kindness has turned into weakness. We’ve let this evil live among us for too long. We’ve excused his transgressions time and time again. We’ve opened our hearts an' our homes to him to be repaid in nothing but insolence and hatred.
