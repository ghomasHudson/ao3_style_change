They stepped out of the car, the gravel crunching under their boots, as Sherlock grabbed John's suitcase from the back seat, positioning it next to the car before looking back up to his partner.
"Please." Sherlock swallowed the lump in his throat and resolutely ignored the logical voice in his head demanding him to shut himself off to this vulnerability, to straighten up and walk out, to not get involved. He realised soon after that the voice remarkably resembled his brother's.
He barely heard his conscience in the back of his head being drowned out by the delicious noises pouring from Sherlock's lips. In fact, John was sure he could sense Sherlock pushing his hips against the wall with his own, but barely had a chance to register the movement before those icy hands were working hastily at the buttons of his now wrinkled white shirt.
"Just following orders." John smirked, reaching forward to touch a finger to Sherlock's collar bone, caressing along to his shoulder, pushing the material of the polo shirt aside.
Surrounded by the dissipating warmth of the air, Doctor John Watson forced himself not to watch as the young man he had become so enraptured by climbed into a car sheathed in shadows.
"Interesting." Said Mycroft, his expression not changing in the slightest. He took all the information he needed about the receptionist's character from one look, and had to struggle through conversation for the rest. "So, a Mr Brugière, and a Mr...?"
"Sherlock-
The bartender cleared his throat. "They're on the house."
"So you've spoken to him?"
"What? From who?" He stood from his seat immediately, walking over to where Sherlock's desk was.
"Sherlock Holmes? A2 Biology, I believe, you teach him? Correct?"
"A goodbye?" the doctor frowned, his forehead wrinkling.
John watched with confusion as Greg visibly swallowed, looking entirely flustered as he gripped the man's hand. "Yes, yes- And you are?"
John saw the look of panic on his face and something in his stomach dropped. "What is it?"
"Oh, so she
"Oh, so that's why. You're using me for something. Predictable."
- the majority of them loathe me."
"I had no idea." John mused to himself, his voice laced with shock.
"As always, John, you underestimate me." Sherlock smiled crookedly at the confusion on the doctor's face, finally driving off down the road and turning onto the main road, putting his foot down.
Greg stared at him for a moment, his mouth agape. "Surely you don't think I know where your brother is." he asked.
Apologies for the slow update, its been the UK equivalent of finals at university for me over the past few months so I've had no time to continue the story. But now I'm free to write!
"I trust you have no further news after your futile attempts to contact your employee Doctor John Watson?" Mycroft's voice sliced through the quiet.
"I've just never been, is all." he said, sliding his hand down to Sherlock's thigh. "I've heard that it's beautiful."
"Sounds great. We could have our own little adventure." John smiled to himself, looking up as soon as Sherlock walked back in.
John tampered down the frustration rising to his chest, "You and your logic, for God's sakes, Sherlock- did you even stop to think about what I want? I don't
So no more was said, they chatted needlessly and sporadically until falling asleep without the knowledge that their sheltered fantasy life up in the breathtaking Scottish hillside couldn't last forever, and that sooner or later, their world would inevitably come crashing back down around them .
"Come
"God no- haven't you seen the movies? We'd be caught at the airport, probably shot down by SWAT teams sent by your brother."
"Not a clue, half of my tutor is missing-" Greg counted the heads of the sixth-formers in front of him, John stood to the side helplessly, thankful he doesn't have a tutor group of his own.
long, Gregory," he said, "I would be surprised if you knew everything about me."
"I assume you don't share the same view as me." Greg asked him.
Five minutes later, once Sherlock had explained to him the nature of the smoking complaint made by the member of staff through the head teacher, Lestrade packed up his folders and shoved them into a drawer close to his desk. "Okay, we're about done here. You can go for lunch. See you on Thursday."
"Unattached then," John nodded, turning in a circle and walking back to his desk, saying under his breath "Just like me" and half hoping Sherlock had heard it.
He often felt quite positive he was about to develop heart-shaped pupils, or that he would begin burping actual butterflies from the swarm in his stomach, whenever he thought about the world's most intelligent and captivating human who was waiting for him at the end of each day.
"So, not exactly the best person that could have overheard our conversation from earlier." Sherlock stated with a raised eyebrow.
Greg interrupted before John could ask, however, stepping forward into the shadow of the ambulance. "Excuse me, I don't believe we've been introduced, I'm-"
Sherlock pressed his mobile phone to the sealed line of his lips, his eyes flitting over the surroundings of the spines of books in the library. He detected a familiar voice faintly drifting into his consciousness from the other side of the racks, immediately cringing when he realised that the voice belonged to Anderson.
Greg thanked the driver as he climbed out of the car, who nodded back to him and started off down the way they'd came. Greg stood on the pavement outside the mass of a building, eyes flickering over the wrought iron gates either side of the closed front door. He wiped his palms on his trousers, smoothed the creases out of his shirt, and reached forward to press the doorbell.
Sherlock scowled at John's grin, letting his fingers trail the edge of the small plate sitting on the bed-sheets. "You know you're the exception."
"I'm sure the opera won't miss you, then" the calm voice sounded closer as Mycroft walks upstairs, heading for his own room.
"Yes." Sherlock supplied, his lips pressed together.
His thoughts were interrupted by the heavy scent of smoke drifting into the classroom.
"Can't you get one of your... operatives, to do it for you?" Greg waved his hand absently towards the door leading to the collection of workers in the next room.
John holds the door of the wooden lodge open for Sherlock, who storms in guns blazing demanding all numbers of equipment from the staff on hand. John trails immediately after, apologising for the rudeness of his student and asking politely if they have any vets or medical resources on site.
John lifted his head, registering the uncertainty splayed across the young man's face. "Of course"
Sherlock's eyes were drawn to the ring of puckered scar tissue in the doctor's left shoulder, slightly raised and tinged in a soft pink colour. His fingers fell just underneath it, circling gently, unaware of John's fond and watchful gaze on him.
"MYCROFT!" Sherlock shouted, slamming the door shut behind him with his foot.
But Sherlock was quiet again, staring hard at his own hands, expressionless.
John shrugged, "Teacher privileges".
"Okay?" John paused, looking back into Sherlock's eyes, searching his facial expression for any of the uncertainty or panic he had found before, the first time they'd shared a bed together.
Sherlock hauled himself up from the ground, brushing off his suit trousers and flicking out his coat, the collar flinging up. He stooped to help John up with his un-injured hand, making sure not to linger too long on the up-take.
He made it a point to not look anybody in the eye as he descended the steps of the plane, sniffing rudely even at the air hostesses who were their usual irritating and jolly selves stood at the exits wishing him a safe journey home.
"Unfortunately not, Mr Holmes."
"I'm afraid so, sir." his assistant replied, avoiding all eye contact in order to not be at the end of Mycroft's foul mood.
"Some days will be better than others, but you're making progress. You need to try not to bury it." He advised, twirling some of Sherlock's curly hair around his forefinger.
"Oi, there's a lot of things you don't know about me, I'll have you know." he grabbed at Sherlock's hand as he swayed past him towards the wardrobe, pulling him onto the bed next to him.
John had settled on watching Sherlock stretch out against the settee, having deposited his coat over the banister of John's stairs and toed his dress shoes off at the door. His body resembled something feline-like as he twisted and turned to find comfort, curving around John's square cushions.
John smiled politely back at him, "You are a good looking guy, don't get me wrong, but I'm afraid I'll have to politely decline." He smiled one of his most charming smiles at the man who was obviously disappointed, lingering for a moment in embarrassment and then excusing himself.
John hummed in response as Sherlock swung his satchel underneath his arm, pushed towards his back. "Who's the new girl?" John asked, referring to the lady who was gesticulating wildly to a confused Lestrade.
"Sherlock- wear a tie", Mycroft called from downstairs.
"I'm fine, John." Sherlock replied calmly, feeling his lover's thumb stroking at his temple. "Thank you." he said, a touch emotional at the extra care John was taking to ensure his happiness.
It'd been only just a week since his car's decision to break down, and had then been mysteriously repaired as if upon a miracle by the end of the day, standing proudly in the same spot that he'd left it, looking if anything as though it had had an entire new paint-job and new mirrors alongside (upon inspection) an entire new engine compartment that now ran as smooth as anything.
"I've had express orders from your brother to retrieve you from sixth form and transport you home. "
"You're upset- no...conflicted. Increased heart-rate and breathing, restlessness-"
Sherlock clasped his hands together, positioning them in a steeple underneath his chin. "I haven't decided yet."
"We received a call this morning, from the guardian of one of our upper sixth students." Mr Frays began, scratching at his thinning hair.
Greg's eyebrows pulled together in confusion. "What?"
Greg's eyes lit up with unquestionable anger, just about to lapse into a well-deserved lecture when a tall man appeared quite literally from nowhere.
__________________________________________________________________________________
No, it will be fine. Just curious mate.
"You said you liked it!" John cried, indignant.
"I am eighteen, legal to make my own decisions." Sherlock frowned at his former teacher, crossing his arms stubbornly across his chest.
She hesitated, and then continued to study her nails. "The beds are divans, so they can be split, but they're proper old, so the hinge is pretty much rusted. Don't reckon you'd be able to separate them now."
John smiled warmly at him in return, knowing that most would interpret Sherlock's attitude towards the exam as arrogance, whereas after coming to know Sherlock as well as he did now, he knew of the truth the young man spoke, knowing that he was more than likely one of the smartest people John would ever have the pleasure to encounter in his life.
Sherlock snorted, picking up his book again. "Are we talking about the same person, here?"
Some of the most memorable being simple competitions of who could talk over each other the loudest to get their opinion across, or literally trying to lock Sherlock in his classroom so he would be forced to endure their tutor sessions without a way of escape. Greg thought himself quite clever after that one, that was until Sherlock pointed out there were 5 different escape routes he could have utilised during the entire meeting before strolling out the door, the tail of his coat disappearing round the corner.
"You shouldn't smoke" John scolds, and Sherlock laughs.
"Oh," John stretched his hand by his side. "I didn't know you had one"
"No, myself and Sherlock live in the same house we always have, even preceding our parents' death." He looked down and buttoned his suit, the material slightly creased from being in the same cramped conditions all day.
Greg pulled out Sherlock's progress reports and sighed. "How are your lessons? Are you finding them challenging enough?"
Sherlock's eyebrows pulled together momentarily, deducing the amount of stress John seemed to be putting himself under just to try and explain himself.
His tie was loosened slightly around his still buttoned collar, the navy blue fabric of it peeking out from underneath his grey jumper. He surveyed John's posture, stood with his hands on his hips, face open and anxious, bottom lip slightly reddened from where he'd been clearly been biting at it apprehensively.
Sherlock held the door open for his teacher, stepping into the empty hallway, most students and teachers had, as usual, gone home by this time, so Sherlock and John were alone in the silence.
Sherlock sent John the most desperate look he could muster, mentally
know the meaning of cleanliness and is definitely a poor excuse for a teacher. I do not understand why I am encouraged to
"Maybe," John sighed. "Who knows anymore. But I can't take much more of this, being apart from you all the time. A few scattered minutes at school isn't enough."
Agents Harding, Jackson, and Smith of the CCTV team on-duty that day had only been able to follow the young man to the edge of a shadowed flat where the boy slipped into the darkness in a swift feline-like movement, effectively finding a security-camera blind-spot.
"You were in there, mate. Why'd you shoot him down? Was it the age?"
John looked around, knowing that his own regular parking space was quite secluded towards the back of the car-park, shadowed under the darkness of a large willow tree, creating flickering shadows in the dim light of the evening. Such a split-second decision made alarm bells ring in his head as he gestured for Sherlock to go around the car and come sit in the passenger seat next to him.
John stared at the ceiling and realised that he'd probably drank too much, and probably shouldn't be discussing a student via text to another teacher, but he trusted Greg, and he knew he wouldn't tell anybody.
And there he was. Covered in black soot and hunched over on the floor. Clawing his way along the carpet. Trying desperately to open his eyes from the intensity of the smoke to see if it really was his teacher or if his idiotically hopeful mind was hallucinating his figure.
Mr Frays nodded, stuffing his hands in his suit pockets uncomfortably just as John noticed a browned stain on his tie. "Only, he didn't mention a name, just expressed a desire for this to be addressed, so, I guess what I'm asking here John is..."
Mycroft tried extremely hard not to snap at the dim-witted woman, who was clearly more interested in her nails than her conversation with Mycroft, a man she clearly didn't realise the importance of.
"Yes, Sir." The deep voice returned, tinged with humour and something akin to flirtation. John shifted in his seat and kept his eyes resolutely on the road.
"Then which way?" he asked impatiently, confusing seeped into the irises that were trained solely on John's.
Sherlock deduced the teacher's discomfort and withdrew himself, snapping back his mask of cool indifference and stepping out of the room, walking briskly away without looking back.
"I thought I'd been hiding it quite well, actually" he brushed back Sherlock's thick fringe.
John tried so desperately hard not to let his eyes follow downwards when Sherlock's shirt lifts and exposes the tiniest show of pale skin, his hipbone jutting out from his skinny frame.
"Ready to go, mate" he nodded to the driver and stepped into the aisle as the vehicle pulled away from the kerb.
Sherlock blinked back at him, the look of lust fighting with an expression of love and devotion as he gazed at John's handsome face, his heart thudding painfully in his chest. "Come here," John gasped, placing his hands either side of Sherlock's neck and tugging him to meet his lips.
?" Mycroft scoffed, folding his napkin into an even triangle. "I don't need perspective, I need him to stop being such a
Frays is cheating on her husband with a fireman from East London.
The suited man leant back in his chair, looking suddenly like most exhausted person in the world. Greg's face softened, he moved his elbows to his desk and leant forward on them, looking directly at Mycroft.
Sherlock itched for a cigarette but remembered how John disapproved the last time he smoked, and tightened his hands around his cup instead as they leaned against the bonnet of the car.
With a pause of uncertainty, Sherlock watched Dr Watson's face for signs of regret or repulsion, but there are none, only calmness with an open and trusting expression which scared Sherlock just a little bit.
"Oh don't pretend you won't miss our tutor sessions- me screaming at you... You sitting not listening to a word I'm saying-
"I will summon the maid in a moment, just give me a-"
"It's a necessary evil." He muttered, letting his hand fall to the side as he looked back up to John.
"Greg Lestrade speaking."
__________________________________________________________________________________
He sipped silently at the cool spirit in his hand, taking in the new information, and watching Mycroft's hardened expression turn gradually to that of an exhausted man.
"I'm sorry?" He fixed the teacher with a deep frown.
He didn't check his phone again until reaching home, having read some statistic in the papers that morning about the amount of road accidents caused by mobile phones, he decided it would be much safer to wait until he was in the security of his own house before reading the rest of his messages.
"Mr Holmes has arrived," he hears a high voice announce and immediately mentally plans out all possible escape routes from the head-teacher's office. He is just contemplating the precise elevation angle needed to land onto the next building from the 7x10 single window when his brother enters the room.
Sherlock stretched out against his lover like a cat, toes curling against John's calves, before retracting inwards and tucking his head underneath John's chin with a satisfied little grunt.
John chuckled to himself, his biceps flexing as he tucked the loose towel in further against his hips. "Maybe..."
"I thought so" Sherlock smirked to himself.
"My house? Is that okay?" He said carefully.
Greg was exhausted. He'd been phoning, texting, emailing, God knows bloody everyone who had ever had any contact with John or Sherlock, desperately trying to reach them. He'd been at odds with everyone in the staff room who had questioned John's credibility as a teacher or human being. It was safe to say he was angry. He'd also managed to cause an argument with just about all of his colleagues whom he was previously pretty close with.
With a quick check to his timetable, he saw that he had a free period and thanked his lucky stars, scooping up his box of folders and ignoring the shoot of pain his leg sent him, a tell tale sign that it was getting worse again.
Not only had he not got anything done for the entire first half of his day, but he had thought of nothing else but that damn controlling man, wondering why he was suddenly deciding to not get in contact at all, and wondering who he had offended up there to be handed such a nightmare on a plate. Helping one stubborn Holmes brother to find the other stubborn Holmes brother. Somebody should make a sitcom about his life, he thought.
His mouth snapped shut, and the light of amusement came into his eyes as he faced forward again, his mind steering towards thoughts that it was going to be an interesting end to the night indeed.
"What the hell is he doing?" Greg muttered to himself.
"Rules."
"He's run before, hasn't he?" he asked softly, when realisation dawned.
John blinked back at him, "You're driving?"
______________________________________________________________________________
"Don't shave," Sherlock replied. "We should be employing every possible tactic that we can access to widen the gap between our normal appearances and our new appearances."
John barely escaped, clambering up taking the steps two at a time as the air began to get thicker and the sweat around his collar started to drip onto the fabric. John was either hallucinating from the fear or his tie was definitely trying to strangle him.
John blinked, keeping his eyes straight ahead and away from his student. "I'm just glad nobody was seriously hurt." he attempted to sound as sincere and professional as he could, feeling even more daunted by the older Holmes' looming stance and blank facial expression.
"Short...blond..."
"He turned seventeen three days after the accident."
"Doing more important things" Sherlock mumbled from underneath the mass of blankets and pillows he had buried his body in. He heard a sigh from his brother and a shutting of the door.
"As you probably already know, Sherlock has been issued with another suspension, this time of three days away from school."
John mustered a sad smile and turned back to the wheel. "Shall we go on a drive?" he cleared his throat at the nod of consent from Sherlock and pulled out from the parking space.  Sherlock gets his phone out to scroll through so he can keep his head down and concealed from prying eyes.
"Shhh!" Sherlock hissed into the darkness. "Stop clobbering everything together."
John felt the weight lift from his shoulders but the tension remained, his foot tapping nervously. "I don't think anyone ever truly gets through to Sherlock, or ever will" John joked, and the moment is gone. That doesn't stop John becoming increasingly paranoid as soon as any other teacher walks through the door, his irrational brain insisting to him that everyone knew.
"Can I help you, Kevin?" John moved closer to the Physics teacher, attempting to block Sherlock from view to hopefully move all potential suspicious thoughts from the intruding teacher's mind.
"It's something that I have come to believe, from my experiences- that it is easier to expect the worst from people, so when they inevitably let you down, I find it to be less of a tedious drama."
?" Mycroft raised his eyebrows, looking genuinely taken aback by Sherlock's use of the Doctor's first name.
John turned his head to catch Sherlock's lips as they pulled away, his hand coming just under his defined jaw, thumb stroking rhythmically against the hollow under the young man's cheekbone.
"Go on then," he grinned, hinting.
Doctor Watson checked his own pulse for signs of an approaching anxiety attack and excused himself to the bathroom.
Mycroft turned, his eyes boring straight into Greg's. "You have no idea, do you?"
"Right," John patted his knees and stood, lifting the stool he was sitting on and shoving it back behind the tables. "Okay, well, I just wanted to know you were okay, I suppose" John scratched his head. If he was honest with himself, he didn't even know why he'd wanted to speak to Sherlock alone, was it to see if he lived up to the hype? To see if he matched all those rumours floating around the staff room?
Ten minutes later, they pulled up to a side road boasting a large sign proclaiming their location as '
Greg sighed, shaking his head at the pity-party that was going on in his head. Whilst lunch yesterday had felt like a breakthrough to Greg, getting Mycroft to open up to him slightly about Sherlock, he knew that the stubborn suited man would try his absolute hardest not to let his composure slip again. And once again Greg would be shut out in the cold.
"Taking a leaf out of your book," he sassed in return, stepping in and onto the bear-skin rug sprawled out on the dark hardwood floor. He shut the door with a click.
"Well, Have fun without me." Sherlock raised his nose slightly, turning from the conversation back to a thick textbook he had lugged into John's classroom at the start of lunch, his head buried in the pages so intently that he'd nearly knocked John's coffee out of his hands from their collision.
Sherlock stood again, facing John. "I need a thin cotton bandage, some spring water and an elastic band." he deadpanned.
Sherlock shook his head in amusement, eyes trained on Mycroft's king as he moved.
"I'm to take you home."
The two guards on school-duty who were to survey Sherlock Holmes' movements had been distracted when a 'ridiculously attractive' teacher in a crimson red dress and legs longer than anything had crossed their path on the way to her car, stopping for a 30 second chat and officially, yet unbeknownst to her, concealing Sherlock's speedy movements past their checkpoint (later indicated by the CCTV footage).
"Give it another week" Greg laughed to Mike, raising his mug in the air.
"I would have thought you'd know, considering she's a teacher." Sherlock's baritone voice replied.
"You deserve more than this," John sighed as if he were praying. "More than this secrecy, and scandal. More than what people will think and say when they find ou-"
"What?" he asked finally, folding the newspaper and dropping it onto his lap.
Greg raised his eyebrows, "Mycroft?" he was just about to start walking again when he noticed a lustrous black car to the left of him, a chauffeur stepped out abruptly and held open the door with an expectant look.
Mycroft didn't give his brother an answer, simply stopped his movements, watching Sherlock closely.
Lestrade noticed John glancing over to them, standing shorter than Sherlock, he really did not look like a teacher compared to the young Holmes. "That one there next to him is John, he teaches Biology. He's a doctor, actually."
Sherlock proved his point by marching over to the window instead.
The teacher watched him thoughtfully, "I wouldn't say no."
"Oh- I'm sorry, but I have an appointment with-"
Sherlock cursed under his breath and reaches for his only tie, skinny black patterned silk, one his mother had bought him years ago for his birthday after he had started to dress up in suits similar to his father's and Mycroft's.
John bit out a bitter laugh, completely done with  anything Sherlock had to say. He pushed off from the wall and stormed off in the direction of the school.
He shuffled on the other side of the call. "I didn't say you had, I was merely stating a fact-"
A scoff in return, "Barely" Sherlock picked at the wood of the table in front of him with his fingernails and refused eye contact.
He slid off his suit jacket and unbuttoned his shirt in a haste, yanking at the zip of his trousers until he was stood in his boxers in front of the mirror, staring at the wide uncertain eyes in the reflection. His eyes slid down the pale expanse of his own skin, muscled in places, smooth and flat in others, smatterings of hair around scars, blemishes and marks of blush, the blush rising straight to his cheeks.
"Fuck," John groaned, "Sherlock, we can't. We
Which is why he was sat at his kitchen table in silence, staring at the blank phone in his hand, with no plans whatsoever, waiting for it to light up with
John closed his eyes as soon as the door closed behind the man, his expression holding the weariness of someone who was barely holding himself together. Sherlock watched him with the same level of scrutiny as he always did, and was met with a still unexpected wave of sadness, recognising the effect and strain their relationship was putting on the usually strong, resilient and untouchable man.
The suited man regarded him for a moment before facing the computer screen once again.
The car twisted and turned around unfamiliar streets, until they ended up in a quieter and significantly grander area of central London. Greg frowned at the towering pallid terraced houses, recognising the location instantly from a sign showing
Sherlock narrowed his eyes slightly, something in the back of his mind registering that such a characteristic had recently been inherited from Mycroft, which irritated Sherlock to no end. He deduced what he could from the way John was standing, apprehensively with his fingers grasping the material on the inside of his pockets, the state of his un-buttoned cuffs rolled to the elbow and his dress shoes covered in a slight sheen from walking across the wet grass to the block where he knew Sherlock usually went to smoke.
He squinted at the screen of his computer, feeling progressively more tired of scrolling his finger along the zoom controls. He was startled by a sharp knock at the door.
"Right- you know the deal, no funny business, we'll be there in about 40 minutes. Don't chuck your rubbish on the floor or you'll be staying behind to clean the entire coach after school." John's eyes were inevitably drawn to the group of troublemakers huddled at the back of the bus, shooting them a meaningful warning look before taking his seat back next to Molly. "Oh, and make sure your seatbelts are on!" he called over his shoulder before fastening his own.
Sherlock cleared his throat. "You are under the assumption that I remember the name of my own teachers, let alone others in the departments of my subjects."
"I have my ways of keeping Mycroft distracted. Come on, John."
Sherlock had just left the chemistry lab at 5:52pm, supposing that reception staff had left by now, he headed for an alternative exit. Mrs Hudson had been more chipper today, Sherlock had deduced it definitely had something to do with her new lover she'd managed to secure three days ago at a bingo game in West London but not mentioned anything about it.
"What was your first impression of me?" John asked, his face peeking up from under Sherlock's arm around him.
After reaching the nature reserve site they had booked into, they were lead straight into an over-run field bordering smatterings of forest containing ridiculously tall trees.
Having stuffed themselves with packaged pastries and fresh coffee from a nearby petrol station, Sherlock had returned to the reception and handed in their keys with a flourish; thanking the irritated receptionist loudly in a broken French accent, effectively waking her from her peaceful daydream.
John sighed. "We aren't in some fantasy fiction novel, Sherlock."
"We are not going back to Belgravia." the elder Holmes said quickly, his hands tightening on the steering wheel.
"Any progress?"
Wishing for the 100th time that he was taller, John took a deep breath and pushed himself up onto his tiptoes to press his forehead to Sherlock's, his own gloved hand resting against the nape of his neck.
"Yes." Mycroft replied, rotating his head slightly until an audible crack sounded from his protesting spine and neck.
Not meeting his eyes, Sherlock glanced nervously to the side and let out a breath, startling John with the sudden prominent appearance of his youth in one simple action. "Promise?" he asked, apprehensively.
His heart skipped slightly at the term of endearment he was still unused to, quickly racing again as he pressed his hips more forcefully against John's, his ears being treated to a guttural moan from his teacher.
John was sat looking like a man in turmoil, which he supposed that's what he was.
"This won't be the last time you'll see me, Lestrade." Sherlock said with confidence, an expressionless face making the sentence seem slightly strange.
John wished that he could reach out and stroke his thumb across Sherlock's knuckles, but kept his hands firmly glued to his cup instead. "Will you be doing anything to celebrate?"
The door opened before he'd even made contact with the button, and Greg was faced with yet another smartly dressed stranger who looked him up and down once, and stepped aside with an arm gesturing further into the house.
Sherlock misses another two and a half lessons in the next week, and John is concerned by the content that he is missing, no matter how much of a genius he claims to be.
They sat in another one of their comfortable silences until John gestured to the radio, telling Sherlock to put on what he would like. "I don't care much for the music of today" Sherlock replied quietly.
"Don't give me that-"
"Shush, it's only for tonight," Sherlock checked the handbrake and lifted his hips to feel his back pocket for his phone, pulling it out alongside his wallet. "Come on." he climbed out of his side, closing the door and waiting for a sleepless John to follow.
He settled his glass down on the fireplace before responding, tugging his top button open which was threatening to strangle him completely. "Yes. It was easier for us to stay here after our parents' death."
"No-" He glared back stubbornly, marching away back in the direction of which they came. Greg followed, hopping over the sludge of soft mud surrounding the bank of the river.
John's stomach turned. "God, Sherlock." he whispered, placing his hand at the back of the genius' neck. "How old were you?"
Sherlock's adam's apple bobbed defiantly, "Smoking."
"Har-har, very funny." John responded with a half-hearted glare. "What's that?" he asked after a brief pause, noticing a bulge of fabric underneath Sherlock's arm, positioned more towards his back, hidden from view.
He was dressed in a full piece suit, jet black and pin-striped with a crimson red tie Windsor-knotted at the stiff wing-tip collar. With an air of familiarity and confidence, the man marched straight over to Sherlock, grasping tightly a hawk-ended umbrella and reaching straight for Sherlock's face. John felt immediately intimidated by his presence.
"Hi," Greg said, hovering in the doorway.
"Of course he can," John looked up at him. "I could go to jail, if any of this goes any further."
John laughed at Greg's mumblings. "Don't worry," he smiled, clapping a hand on Greg's forearm.
"Are you staying behind?" John asked after realising he had stopped.
"You have lost almost half a stone with stress since our whole secret ordeal began, you are more than often tired, irritable and on edge. Jumpy whenever anybody comes around a corner. Afraid of Mycroft's inconsistent and unexpected appearances in which he continues to threaten you. Far from the John Watson I met at the beginning of our relationship."
Sherlock hesitated, which went un-noticed by Lestrade who was still insisting to the student to correct his unkempt uniform. "Perhaps."
"Well, considering I didn't know the schedule, let alone that I would even
"I'm eighteen. In my last year of sixth form, soon I'll be gone anyway-"
Sherlock was just about the push the door open when John turned, blinking rapidly with confusion as soon as he noticed the proximity of his student, stumbling backwards and knocking over his chair in a rush to put distance between them.
"Promise." John smiled, his arms fully wrapped around Sherlock's waist. "Now come on, I don't bite."
"Okay? that is."
Sherlock straightened his lips into a line. "Where to?"
"Yes, yes, much better than those last ones Dr Chase gave me, I even said to Mrs Turner last week- you know how she gets with her gossip, though she can't talk really, she's got all sorts- anyway, she was put on the same ones I was, and then-"
"I meant as in muscle, too, you've definitely gained more of that. It must be those morning runs you've started doing." John crossed his own legs perpendicular to Sherlock's, their feet almost touching on the table. "And your newly obtained lumberjack skills." he grinned, his teeth white in the dim light.
is yet, but-"
"Come now- Doctor Watson." Mycroft entered the black car, sliding over the panel seat to make room for John, who numbly managed to follow, closing the door behind him.
"Don't you dare-" John yanked him back by his sleeve with slightly too much force. "We're not done. Now shut up, sit down and listen." He ordered, and Sherlock was surprised to hear John's authoritive 'teacher' voice ordering him.
"Sherlock-" He gasped, hands at the younger man's hips now, feeling the roughness of barely-there stubble brushing against his own lips and chin, revelling in the dizziness of emotion and pleasure that plagued his senses, something he hadn't experienced in a long time just from kissing.
but I won't hide it. Not from
"Is his brother still messing you around?" Greg asked casually, concern lacing his gaze. "Because if it gets serious, you know I used to be a copper-" he placed his own mug on the coffee table in front of them.
John slapped his arm playfully, "Sherlock Holmes, you cannot fight me on this-"
Greg awoke to the sound of a car alarm insistently blaring from his open window.
"Which other A-levels do you take? Apart from Biology?" John inquired.
Sherlock sighed. "Nineteen."
Both men resolutely ignore the brush of fingertips that the radio decisions had caused, John listening intently to the new genre of music that Sherlock had introduced him to.
us to happen this way."
"It's Biology." Sherlock stated, the upset still lingering in his features. "I want to drop it, I was told I had to discuss it with my tutor and get permission beforehand-"
"Your phone-" He protested weakly, his gaze flickering to the closeness of Sherlock's damp lips.
Sherlock paused momentarily and surveyed his surroundings, noticing that the entirety of the bench to his right side had been decorated with the remainders of the first phases of his experiment on the saliva sample of his neighbour's dog he had collected that morning.
"Now who's being a drama queen?"
Sherlock held his gaze for a moment, before curling back up into a cross-legged position on the sofa, his fingers idle. "It's your house, John, you decide." he said at last, his voice coming across deeper than before.
With the prelude of heavy footsteps and laboured breath, Mycroft is chased down by a man with cropped hair and a striped blue tie blowing over the shoulder of his pressed white shirt. "Excuse me? Do you have the time?"
It wasn't until John had been sat reading the newspaper he had grabbed from the side for a couple of minutes that he had noticed something was different.
"I can't" he growled in return, turning with a swish of thick fabric as he slid his lighter back into his pocket and rubbed his hands together.
Sherlock nodded, his hands falling back to John's strong hips, moving to the small of his muscled back, shirtless and golden. He worked his way under the waistband of his jeans and boxers, hands resting fully on full and glorious cheeks. John groaned, feeling his way back to Sherlock's exposed cock, still slightly perturbed by the above average size
Sherlock raised an eyebrow, pulled his hand from John's with a small smile and turned the key in the ignition.
"Why are you wasting your time with a boring old biddy like me anyway?  I doubt you've been in this area of the school for a good few years, too busy slaving away in that science department of yours."
John paused, cup of tea half way to his mouth, and slowly lowered his mug.  "Please try not to get yourself suspended, it really doesn't look good on your record, Sherlock."
words with John when he returns." The man sat back in his chair with his hands folded, seemingly satisfied with his defence.
He waited 42 minutes inside the biology lab, expecting John to appear, laden with his usual morning coffee, newspaper and satchel.
Sherlock sighed. "Fine."
"Jesus," He groaned, covering his face with his hands. "I'm such an idiot."
"Yes, Madam..." Greg checked the time on his phone quickly, sliding it back into his pocket and getting ready to turn the handle and enter "Have a pleasant evening, Madam."
John was half-way through explaining to a year seven student the importance of manners when a sharp ringing trilled through the air. He startled when recognising the sound as the fire alarm, not recalling a notice about a fire drill in the all staff email that morning.
"Okay?" He asked breathily, pressing a kiss underneath Sherlock's ear, his lengthy curls tickling John's nose where they curled around his ear and stuck out haphazardly from the nape of his neck.
"You have an irritating habit of underestimating yourself, John." Sherlock replied simply, taking the final bite of his biscuit.
"You are way above target for all five lessons. Impressive, as always." Greg thought aloud, flicking through more documents in the plastic sleeve.
His displeasure was clear through the video feed, "So, Miss Riley, tell me again," he sighed, staring at the woman who was popping gum-bubbles in the face of her laptop camera. "What was the name of the two gentlemen you encountered at the reception desk?"
The sound of the traffic and the clock ticking in the background became an absent buzzing in the back of his mind as Mycroft Holmes sighed, feeling the weight of the world on his shoulders. "If I am stable, I am in a better position to help Sherlock remain stable. Did he
"John!" Sherlock snapped in anger.
"The universe is rarely so lazy," Sherlock sighed, "No- the rumours are about us. You will be called into the head's office first thing tomorrow morning, probably me too."
__________________________________________________________________________________
"Most likely." Mycroft sighed, stretching out his fingers.
"With all due respect, Colin, surely
Sherlock scowled as Mycroft took his face in one hand, gripping him by his chin and tilting his head  to check for signs of trauma with a direct look into his eyes. After a moment he let go, his fingers hovering.
Greg squinted at him, folding his arms. "What are you up to, Sherlock?"
"I'm used to seeing you as the quick minded, fast-paced, brilliant Sherlock Holmes. You're considerably...slower, right now. It's nice to have you on my level."
"Yes, us." John insisted.
He stopped without turning his head. "What?"John's eyes fell upon the dark silhouette of wide shoulders encased in the length of Sherlock's textured collared coat, the distinguished figure that John had come to know so well.
"I just assumed, you're here all the time. Don't think I've ever seen you leave, actually." His eyebrows pulled together.
Mycroft met his gaze over his screen. "Not yet."
His mind wandered to John as it often did these days, which left Sherlock  buried in a stubborn bubble of silence that he only realised he was in 45 minutes later when he shook himself out of it. Mrs Hudson was gone, Sherlock realised she must have attempted to speak to him and realised that he'd sunk into his mind palace again.
"Wait- hold on a minute-" Greg shook his head, bringing his palm to his face. "This has come from nowhere! John-I mean, Dr Watson was telling me just the other day how you're excelling in lesson, starting to involve yourself more, getting 100% on all past-papers-"
The servant opened his mouth to speak, but was interrupted by a new voice coming from behind Greg.  "Of course."
"The folder entitled 'Correspondence'" Mycroft supplied, and Sherlock hears rustling and muffled voices in the background of the call and goes towards the locked drawer in Mycroft's desk.
He gasped at the feeling of John's hand pulling deliciously at his erection, distracted by the combination of hands and tongue, until John was looking up at him with a hint of mischief in his eyes, and some hesitation.
Sherlock stared back at Lestrade as if he had just asked him to time-travel back in time and change history. Lestrade simply raised his eyebrows, pushing a pen towards his student until the boy frowned down at the paper and began to scribble one-worded statements.
"Just- what you did. It reminded me..."
"Mycroft," he said, impatiently, moving to John's neck, seeking the location of the sensitive skin of his pressure point.
The line went dead and he rose to his feet, pulling the mask back down over his face and holstering his gun, heading for the door.
They fell into the house, shaking off the water like dogs and peeling sodden layers of clothing off with a grimace. John hobbled over to the closest sofa, hearing Sherlock flick the kettle on followed by a loud whistling as it boiled in the kitchen.
"Sherlock," Mycroft glances at him, eyes sharp and challenging. Sherlock scowls at him in return and continues talking.
With a blur of dark clothes and curls, Sherlock barged in without introduction.
Sherlock appeared with two mugs, settling one down on the coffee table next to John. "Oh dear, shall I call a doctor?" he asked innocently.
"At home" He wandered to the back of the classroom.
Sherlock responded with a raised eyebrow.
"No, but I am a doctor, Sherlock."
"Sure-erm, just turn to the next page, guys, start on questions two and three, and we'll go over them when I get back."
"Your career is important to you." He stated.
Sherlock sprung up. "Can we all stop lurking around like lacklustre animals and get out of here." he snapped, reaching for his discarded coat that lay abandoned on the ambulance step, still reeking of smoke. With the final affirmation from paramedics that they were acceptably medically relieved, Sherlock stormed off ahead, wrapped in his coat, collar up and dress-shoes crunching the broken glass particles under his feet.
"So, let's leave." John said decidedly. "I've already determined that there's nothing more important to me right now than
"So, what are you doing when you get home tonight?" John asked finally, snapping the genius out of his brainstorm..
"It's not my fault everyone is so-"
Long tentative fingers fell onto his skin as if by magic, and John couldn't remember ever feeling so intensely captured in bed with any other lover before. Sherlock grounded him. He stared up at the face above him, clearly enthralled, eyes piercing and curious as a newborn baby, and John couldn't find it in him to feel self conscious under his gaze, if anything it calmed him.
He lifted Sherlock's hips under his hands as he approached climax, his hot tongue sliding down the short stretch of flesh to place a final deft lick to Sherlock's puckered entrance, the final straw before the younger man was crying out, shooting stripes of come against his stomach, hand fisted tightly around his cock.
"'Scuse me." he mumbled in apology, pushing up from his chair with his free hand, having a sudden desire to eat alone in his own classroom instead.
" Sherlock took his cock in hand and stroked quickly, pulling himself towards orgasm as John's mouth moved over his balls.
"Sherlock," he whispered, his voice private, reminiscent of the whispers of lovers on the run from a world who didn't understand them, and didn't try to, either. "You already do please me."
"Yes," he said finally, and with a twirl of fabric, he descended down the stairs to the labs, leaving John to go his separate ways.
John paused, watching his student cover his face with his hand, sliding his palm upwards into his hair and gripping. "You can't wh-"
"This is an extremely rare tree, John." Sherlock told him, his hand touching the trunk as gently as John imagined one to hold a newborn.  "A Cork oak." he nodded.
He felt a hand at the back of his neck, strong but not forceful; caressing, almost. "John..."
"Our mother." Mycroft looked away, out through the window onto the busy hustle and bustle of the streets of London.
Sherlock snapped his head around, sending the deadliest glare he could muster towards the new boy who was content on spending every waking second trying to outsmart him and prove he was the most intelligent.
"I am too advanced for her." Sherlock raised his chin.
"You are not fine." Sherlock stated, glancing in his rear view mirror automatically, scanning his view for the appearance of any over-friendly or familiar cars that could be following them.
John in fact was not sick, but had called in that morning with the fabricated excuse of a nasty stomach bug; and was now sitting alone in his silent living room, wondering what he should do.
John leant over and jabbed at the buttons with his free hand, "Nonsense, there's loads on here. You're bound to find something you like." John skipped over the channels until Sherlock's hand stopped him, pressing the back button onto
The point being, was that Greg had found over the years that he had known the enigma of the young man, that Sherlock Holmes was a machine capable of inflicting any deduction of his to get his own way, and 90% of the time, he did.
"Mycroft Holmes" they shook hands. "Are you the teacher that retrieved my brother from the fire? I believe I ought to express my utmost gratitude-"
"And then, you should've seen the look on her face, she almost- John?" Greg poked his colleague's leg.
He worked at the buttons of the doctor's shirt with long cold fingers, as John's hands fell to his throat, worked their way up to his hair where he tugged sharply at the thick mass of curls, guiding Sherlock's mouth to the space under his jaw. He'd just managed to undo the last button, pulling the shirt out of the belted jeans, when John spoke, desperately and quickly. "Let's go upstairs."
can't." he swore, running his hands over his face with a muffled voice.
" Sherlock hissed.
reaction.
Sherlock moved to stand behind John's figure, feeling responsible for John's reaction. "We can leave." he said immediately, "This is perfect timing."
"Plus I would probably be skinned alive by your brother, and he would have me ejected from the country for high treason or something equally ridiculous and terrifying-"
John stood, his hands over his face, trying to take deep breaths and figure out how he could get his student out of his house before Sherlock's brother came knocking.
Greg was extremely annoyed with himself, he'd decided.
"Don't give me an opportunity to insult your intellect," the suited man leant back. "Despite your disposition, you are an intelligent man. What do you think I am asking you?"
"I am thankful", his icy sharp eyes flicked upwards, meeting John's gaze for a moment, a fleeting chance of softness and invitation before the connection was lost and Sherlock dropped his sight to the ground once more.
In order to not let his composure slip, John immediately launched back into teaching, going through the mark scheme for questions on the repercussions of kidney dialysis. Sherlock entered the room again 5 minutes later with a forceful shove to the door behind him with his foot to close it. He trudged back to his chair without looking at anyone, buried in his own head.
He exhaled suddenly, something that sounded close to a sigh of defeat, and turned towards his desk, retrieving a blank white CD contained within a clear plastic wallet casing.
"You don't seem to have any problems helping Sherlock Holmes out-" Sebastian challenged, a perfectly plucked eyebrow raised, and John's face noticeably sobered. "No wonder he always gets top marks, no one could be that clever...unless they had
Sherlock glared at him, mentally mapping out the 26 items that could be utilised for murder in the room.
John closed his eyes, waiting for the fatal blow.
Sherlock frowned to himself, reaching for his phone deposited at the bottom of his suit-trouser pocket, thumbing the screen to open and compose a text whilst still focused on John.
Only a couple of hours had passed since Sherlock had last seen John, and he was sensing that in order to avoid him longer, he should probably evade the science department. However, it was imperative that he checked his mould experiments sitting in Petri dishes on the windowsill of Chemistry lab number 3 before he left for home, which is where he found himself when John came storming in.
He nodded in answer.
"John-" he sighed, between kisses, feeling John's body warm and pliant under his hands. He spun the shorter man around with ease, meeting the fire in John's eyes with the intense iciness of his own.
John hyperventilates, imagining Sherlock trapped in that building, choking from smoke inhalation and crowded by flames.
Sherlock's eyes watched him still, fond and awestruck at the sensations flowing through his body. He could feel both his own and John's arousal pressed together still from the waist down, the feeling blinding and potentially dizzying, however it was nothing compared to the tingling in his chest, his rapid heartbeat thumping as if alight as he watched John's face so close to his own.
The crackle of gravel under the car tires shook the two men slightly as they approached a small gaggle of trees, giving way to a small white old-style cottage decorated with thick wooden beams, barely lit with a few glowing lamps in the small windows.
"What do I know, John?" Sherlock stared at him.
Sherlock paused, his breath heavy against John's ear.  "You shouldn't be thinking about trousers."
Greg held up his hands, "Okay," he laughed. "Okay, forget I said anything." He stared at the 6 o'clock shadow starting to form on Mycroft's jaw, admiring the way it made his still youthful face look that tinier bit more mature.
Greg frowned back at him in the small car, his mouth agape with confusion, "But where-"
"And, uh- I mean, I don't know what your plans are but, I get my break in an hour or so, so if you fancied hanging around? I could buy you another drink?"
Greg didn't look startled at being addressed, as if he had wanted John to ask him, which made the doctor feel slightly uneasy. "Have you seen Sherlock today?"
"Sherlock-" he gasped, feeling possessive hands at his waist.
"You're worried he's right." Sherlock said into the quiet, his voice accusatory.
Sherlock nodded once, his eyes scanning John's face, his emotions apparent in the curve of his lower lip and the deepness of his frown. "You were very close, but your father intervened." He deduced aloud.
"I'm not joking. I thought I'd made that pretty clear by expressing my wishes to terminate my Biology studies in order for our affair to continue-"
"He also said that Dr. Watson propositioned him with a similar offer when Mr Holmes was not in the room."
Sherlock grunted noncommittally, fiddling with the peeling border of an English display board on Thomas Hardy's
"Motel." Sherlock corrected.
"Doctor Watson? Could I have a quick word?"
John knew Sherlock well enough to detect the undertones of hurt in his voice, but cringed nevertheless, sighing again and turning around as if not knowing where to put himself in his own home.
John frowned at the pair in the distance, seeing Sherlock cradling something fluffy to his chest with both hands cupped, long legs carrying him quickly away from Greg, who looked red in the face stumbling after him and waving his hands in the air.
He turned to meet the suspicions of his mind and was faced with the sheepish looking teacher, hands stuffed in his pockets, tie askew and loosened at the knot with a night's worth of stubble making a light appearance on his jaw and chin, curving around the softness of his open lips.
"No- I don't..." Sherlock sighed. "I don't mean that, John. I mean--" his lips pressed tight together.
Anderson sent a triumphantly smug look over to Sherlock and sat up straighter and more primly on his stool, folding his hands over one another.
Sherlock looked at him. "So...?"
Reaching for the lanyard around his neck that held his keys, John pulled away, trying not to pay attention to the brushing of fabric as his arm grazed Sherlock's, and his student turned to look at him far more intently than he should. John tries to find a reason to care about what he should and shouldn't be doing anymore, and finds it difficult to locate one.
"It's getting late." Sherlock heard John's voice behind him.
"My health?" John raised his eyebrows.
He hounded Sherlock for weeks before he managed to force himself into Sherlock's bedroom. He claimed he was frustrated with Sherlock's unresponsiveness towards him, and it was the most logical solution for them to work out their 'problem' physically. Having found the most opportune time, Sherlock's temporary apartment was vacant whilst his parents were out for a club meeting, and James would touch him, always being stronger than the gangly young boy.
The ceilings in the rest of the rooms were quite low compared to the hallway, as to be expected of a traditional old British cottage. The beams were thick oak, looming above their heads and framing some of the walls. Inside, the decor was quaint, subtle, old-fashioned and warm. John had never imagined Sherlock to choose something like this for their getaway home.
"Please, answer the question, Miss Riley. I assure you all information you give is useful to us."
of all people, the only person he had let in for years, his throat still felt caught, restricted, thick with dastardly emotion. He recalled the first time he laid eyes upon the trademark smirk he'd become so accustomed to over the month that he was involved with the boy.
Sherlock walked out of the exam hall with a feeling of exhaustion, he'd finished his penultimate exam within the first 20 minutes, and spent the rest of the 70 remaining minutes attempting to make himself sleep. He'd been just approaching the threshold of hypnagogic sleep when he was shaken by a stern envidulator who was convinced he was cheating somehow by hiding his face in his arms on the table. He had simply glared at the woman with the short unkempt hair and hauled his upper body to sitting position, frowning at the sluggishly ticking clock.
The blonde man who's name-tag indicated he was called Matthew, practically dragged himself away from the pair, flirty smile not gone from his face as he turned his back and bent over to reach the pint glasses.
"Uh, well, there kind of is someone actually. But nothing has happened between us yet." John spoke cautiously.
John resisted placing a hand on Sherlock's moving shoulder as he crouched at his feet carefully wrapping the injured bird in his soft scarf and returned it to the safety of his chest.
The stretch of fitted material over the muscles of his chest was tenting the shirt somewhat, buttons straining slightly; and John was having a difficult time remembering that Sherlock was his student, since he looked like he had just stepped off a model runway, his dark curls tousled by the wind, cheekbones sharp as ever, but his eyes soft and focused.
Greg bit his lips together, chewing on the inside absently as he took in Mycroft's meaning. "I doubt they would contact me."
He nudged the door open with the steel-cap of his toe, turning quickly around the corner, gun raised to fire, and came face-to-face with shelves full of beakers and pipettes.
"Oh, I volunteered." Lestrade smiled, taking a bite out an apple he'd been shining on his thigh.
Greg stood in his bleary haze, focusing on the familiar figure, and immediately felt the adrenaline wash through him, his brain recognising a familiar pair of cerulean eyes, albeit shaped differently, and placed closer together. "That's me."
_________________________________________________________________________________
highlight the truth when a teacher obviously incapable of teaching is dictating to me the importance of something as elementary as
sorry- I...fuck. I promised I wouldn't- and I..." He rubbed his eyes with his fists and tried to figure out a way to prise Sherlock from the door and convince him that he wasn't about to force him into anything he didn't want to do. Which was going to be difficult considering his previous actions from just a moment ago.
Mycroft was careful to keep his face still, staring at his sibling.
"Have you noticed Sherlock becoming distracted by any other students? Perhaps, any other boys he sits near? Or his lab partner, maybe?"
In fact, the closest to his mother that Sherlock could be now, was by sitting in Mycroft's office, staring into the beady eyes of the portrait above his brother's desk, silently seething that the artist hadn't captured the warmth in the flecks of amber that had once faintly encircled his mother's icy blue irises.
"What were you doing down there?" John asked, rubbing at his damp hair with a towel. Sherlock watched the water drip down the doctor's muscled chest, struck with desire but hesitancy to touch.
His lips were slightly swollen from John's attention, dusty pink much like the attractive blush that now coloured his skin, resting high on his cheeks in two spots. John's eyes were drawn to the obvious bulge at Sherlock's crotch, his tight suit trousers slightly impractical for straddling one's lover on a small sofa. His eyes were dark and heavy, pupils blown wide and hair sticking out in every which way, his chest rising and falling quicker than usual as his eyes appreciated John's body.
Sherlock found himself in the chemistry lab after school again on the same day that Dr Watson had defended him from the stupidity of other students.
"I, uh..." John attempted to form a sentence.
"Thank you, Sir." he replied dutifully, rising from his chair and leaving without another word.
"Nothing I've done so far constitutes remotely as an overtly romantic gestur-"
." He let his hand fall atop Sherlock's folded ones and squeezed. "I just had a bit of a panic and forgot, that's all."
Sherlock looked up, blinked at John, and moved further into the crowds where John lost him.
Mycroft frowned with clear impatience. "I just told yo-"
"Shut up." Sherlock grouched, reaching for his violin to play something horrendous until Mycroft leaves.
"I am." Sherlock frowned, pushing at John's chest until he rolled onto his back and pushed himself up onto his elbows to hover over him. "Are you hungry? Isn't that something that you do...breakfast?"
Thankfully, most of the time, Greg was captain oblivious, so John had no problem avoiding giving any further more risqué details that could expose the fact that it was Sherlock Holmes he was talking about; Greg's rather opinionated, loud and insanely intelligent student, the one Greg had the smallest soft spot for, but would never admit to his face to spare the boy the ego-boost.
"Oh- John..."
"You've been promoted" He stated into the silence.
John felt as if he were in another world as he laid his head back against the seat as they sped off down the road, the fresh air blowing persistently in, tousling Sherlock's hair and carrying the intoxicating scent of his cologne straight to John.
John managed to undo the last button, and was desperate to push the shirt from Sherlock's shoulders to see the gorgeous stretch of marble skin underneath, attaching his mouth to the expanse of freckles across his shoulders and chest. "John, my god..."
Mycroft barely contains an eye-roll. "I am aware. I would appreciate knowing the reason for your decision." he questions.
"Of course I do." John frowned in bewilderment, wondering how the boy could even doubt it. "In fact, I can't remember a time when I didn't feel so frustratingly and wonderfully head over heels for you, Sherlock Holmes."
__________________________________________________________________________________
John pulled himself up, scrambling off the bed and towards Sherlock who looked as though he were being approached by a mass murderer. He held his hands out to request distance, and John paused, his chest rising and falling with short of breath.
Noticing the silence to his left, Greg paused. "Oh, is there someone special?"
John hummed and shook his head, a small smile pinched at his lips. He looked back over to the slim young bartender, and was able to admire the fit of material at his waist, the attractive curve of his behind in suit trousers, and admitted to himself that, yeah, this guy was eye-catching.
"Close enough." John laughed dryly, tapping his thumb against the rim of his mug.
He broke away from John's lips with a gasp, his head moving to the left, leaving John's lips at the space underneath Sherlock's ear, breathing heavily. "We should probably leave." he said.
"How are you getting home?" John asked when they reached the cars.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yeah it has, thank you so much Doctor Watson, sorry for intruding on your free time." the student mumbled in reply, smiling shyly and stepping around Sherlock's tall form towards the door.
"In your eyes, maybe. But there will be consequences attached to those sorts of plans- you must have seen the news and all the gossip, when things like this have happened before. You'll be deemed abducted, regardless of your age, because of the circumstances in which we met."
"Get out." John growled, his anger coming off him in waves, and Sebastian had the decency of being startled by the shout from the undersized Biology teacher.
"Erm...Doctor Watson?" A voice sounded from the doorway.
"Brilliant, as always. Well done, Sherlock" he praised him quietly and moved on to the next student, as Sherlock looked down at his A* with inexpressive eyes, sliding it into the back compartment of his satchel.
Sherlock froze, then immediately moved closer to the warmth, his mouth falling open as he crowded John back against the bricked wall of the alley way behind them. With a great deal of uncertainty, he placed his hand on the wall to the side of John's head, his eyes burning with the same question John's brain was screaming.
__________________________________________________________________________________
John's eyes fell to the way the creases smoothed out under his fingertips, stretched over solid chest muscles. He shook his head. "You can't do that," he insisted.
Sherlock checked his watch. "96 minutes. You're getting slow."
He felt his phone vibrate in his pocket as soon as he left the stuffy office-room, he answered without checking the ID, heading outside to the staff smoking area.
Sherlock sat tentatively down on the seat next to his teacher, yanking his seatbelt across and providing his address when John asked for it.
"I can't do it anymore." Sherlock gasped simply.
The older man's mouth pulled into a slow contented smile, lifting his hands above his head to grasp the headboard behind him, noticing Sherlock's eyes following the stretch of muscle in his bicep with a hooded gaze.
Sherlock paused, clearly in thought, before he rolled onto his side in John's arms to face him. "Yes, but I only did all of that because it was hurting me to see you the way you were. It was like you'd had the life sucked out of you, all because of me."
He needed to know why seeing him made his mind blank and deductions felt like he was desperately grasping at straws or forcing his mind through a garlic press. Sherlock wanted to know if everyone had this problem with Dr Watson, did everybody become so poisoned with confusion and contempt at the increase of heart rate for no logical reason?
He took Sherlock's hand into his own without any hesitation.
Sherlock beamed back at him. "Check"
Mycroft frowned for the fourth time that day. "Again?"
can understand how much of a lying tosser Kevin is? You know what he's like! All the trouble he's caused since he's been here speaks for itself. How can you tell this isn't just another one of his lies?"
"So, what? You're just waiting for something to appear? Scotland is bloody massive!"  Greg stood from his seat.
"Well, I'm sorry i'm such a problem for you."
__________________________________________________________________________________
Sherlock nodded, absorbing everything that was John Watson and trying to catch his breath.
Sherlock glared at him and shut the textbook with a snap, "I'm capable of hatred, too, you know" he hinted.
He sighed, checking his pocket watch which sat snugly in the pocket of his waistcoat. "Hourly report, Michael?" He called, stood to the side of Greg offering no explanation.
"You don't seem very frightening." John straightened his pose, refusing to be handled.
"See you tomorrow then?" John sounded hopeful, and Sherlock rocked on his heels in response, digging his hands into his coat pockets.
"Why would you let that stop you? If you're into him."
The two men were sat on the stools at the bar, conversing quietly at the end, just in proximity with a gaggle of university students to their left who were downing no-handed shots of
"No-" The head-teacher stopped him, holding a fat hand up to him. "I know you are worried for your friend. And I know you were close to Sherlock, too. But this is as far is it goes now, I appreciate your efforts in trying to contact John, but please let us handle it from now on."
John raised an eyebrow, holding out Sherlock's coffee mug regardless.
This is partly the reason why he decides to corner him the upcoming Wednesday.
"Goodbye, Gregory."
"Are you gonna be at this the whole night?" he asked cautiously, watching the slow blinks of Mycroft's eyelashes, like weights pounding against his tired eyes.
"Oh marvellous idea," he sighed, "kill for a cuppa."
John had tried extremely hard not to feel intimidated by his role of being elected as the new biology teacher of a class containing Sherlock Holmes. He'd heard about him, of course he had. The student from hell, apparently.
John wasn't a particularly worrisome human being, but Sherlock Holmes had always had a habit of just appearing as soon as you were thinking about him. In this case however, John couldn't lay eyes on him anywhere.
"No, Sherlock-" John sat up, a frown on his face. "You can't just drop an entire subject after a year and a half of work! Exams are in three weeks!"
"Lestrade." He remained standing at a considerable distance. "Said that you'd appreciate a goodbye from me."
Sherlock rolled his eyes in true two-year-old fashion and  swung back on his chair.
"Why do you care?" Sherlock looked genuinely confused with the concept that John cared about his wellbeing, which made the teacher internally curse whatever made Sherlock feel like he was so alone in this world.
Sherlock was panting, in awe of how worked up he could get from just a few fleeting touches of John's skin against his own. "John-" he wriggled his hips, urging John's slow fingers to move faster, lower.
"I presume I'm in the right place?" Greg asked unsurely, looking around at the high ceilings and large pristine mirrors framed with vases.
"That's a good thing, isn't it?" John tapped his pen steadily against his leg.
"What do you want?"
"Stay on topic, John."
"Fuck!" He swore, his hands flying to John's hair and gripping, pulling a particularly gorgeous moan from the older man. Sherlock grunted at the vibrations against his cock, the two men setting a steady rhythm as John's head bobbed up and down, Sherlock's hand atop it guiding him up and down the length of his erection.
"Good morning, Greg. I trust you slept well."
John squeezed his eyes shut from the sight of his dishevelled student stood before him, tamed down the wild arousal thrumming and buzzing underneath his skin and tried not to focus on the husky tone of Sherlock's deep voice.
He couldn't resist leaning over and pressing an up-side down kiss to Sherlock's open lips, lasting only a moment before he returning to his previous position. "Sorry-" he shrugged. "Couldn't resist the Spiderman kiss."
"How long do we have?" he asked, his eyes full of something Sherlock couldn't quite place. The street was dark and practically empty, save for a few drunken women singing at the top of the road as they clambered into a taxi.
"You know I don't do those idiotic classes, John" he grunted, looking directly out of the window and avoiding John's eyes.
A war was going on in the doctor's mind, as his body fought against sliding his arms around Sherlock's narrow waist, pressing his hand to his stomach and pulling him flush against John's own body. His skin tingled at the prospect of pressing his nose against the line of Sherlock pale neck, his stubble burning the column of undisturbed marble skin, his lips pressing softly with urgency against the gap behind Sherlock's ear and along his jagged hairline. He stopped himself from taking Sherlock and swaying him, to the music in his head, stopped himself from turning him and begging with his eyes for Sherlock to just

With the electricity of eye-contact threatening to break John's self-restraint of desire, he looked away. "This, Sherlock. Whatever
when John did that. It explained why he got up every morning to make John's tea and toast, it explained why he wanted John to have everything, anything he wanted.
"I'll be gone, and you won't see me again, Mycroft. And you remember last time- you remember how well I can hide-"
"I told you, I already have an acceptable escape route planned." Sherlock blinked at him.
"Hello to you too" Greg commented as he sorted through his tutor folders. "How's your personal statement coming along?"
The surrounding workers were silent, waiting with bated breath as Mycroft moved closer to the screen, irises flickering quickly across the enlarged photo of the boy. Greg's eyes were drawn to the collar of the boy's shirt, noticing the lack of thin and prominent collar bones from Sherlock's gaunt form.
"-Don't know what he was thinking, the silly prick"
"Yeah," Greg replied, head down, watching Sherlock in his peripheral vision as he wandered over to the rear end of the bus. "Just checking the registers."
They'd cleaned up lazily, pulling the covers back over themselves in a silent agreement that they would spend the rest of the evening in bed, instead of going down to do something productive like the washing up, or tidying up the living room. Instead, they slouched against each other in bed, mostly in silence as Sherlock read John parts of a new book he'd picked up at one of their visits into the village, it was originally named
John shivered, wondering how the hell a young virgin could be so confident and successful in turning him on every single time, with such little effort.
Considering that exam season was well and truly underway, sixth form staff were having a great time hounding students into attending revision sessions for exams. In fact, Sherlock was beginning to get increasingly more irritated every time he came face to face with the bright yellow headache-worthy notices that were plastered on every wall, door, and entrance, stating available classes for students to access in free periods.
"Threatened you how?" Greg straightened his back.
Even without seeing the elder Holmes' face, Greg knew it hadn't faltered. Mycroft was holding his composure inexplicably considering his younger brother had all but disappeared off the bloody ends of the earth. He could tell, though. Maybe it was his experience with said younger Holmes brother, but Greg knew the signs of a Holmes beginning to crack under the pressure. And Mycroft was still
John wasn't sure if it was his tiredness convincing him that Sherlock's voice sounded so fond, nevertheless, he didn't have a chance to determine where the emotional haze had come from, as he drifted into sleep. Sherlock remained on the other side of the line until John's breathing slowed, eventually hanging up after the sound of what could only be described as a snuffle.
"So, what you are telling me," the haughty voice began, tension crushing like a vice over the inferior soldier. "Is that the highest capable soldiers and guards under my company, hand selected agents-have been outsmarted by a single eighteen year old?"
Molly nodded enthusiastically, as John seemed to notice she responded to most things with eagerness. "I love it there"
"John?"  a muted voice filtered into his consciousness.
Surprised at the
Sherlock drew his eyes to his lover's face, noticing the smoothness of his jaw and chin, surprisingly accompanied by the lengthier stubble on his upper lip.
John sighed. "I don't know, Sherlock. I'd lose my job." he said quietly, his eyes on Sherlock's shoes.
Sherlock stared at him, looking confused, eyes slightly unfocussed and dazed.
"Mycroft"
"Well, is there evidence? How trustworthy is Moran as a source?" He questioned immediately.
"I told you, I dunno how you pronounce that French-sounding one. Sounded like Brujeuur to me."
John sighed. "I just thought you should know."
"Oh let me guess, you'll have me stalked by brainless and insolent secret service agents for the next few weeks until you have enough information to amuse you."
"I don't disregard that, but you know how these things go." Their eyes were glued to each other, the raw element of delicate and dangerous conversation inside the last place they should be having said conversation seemed to ignite an electrical charge between the two men. "What would your brother do? He'll kill us- no, he'd kill me- you'd probably be fine, but... we just wouldn't get away with it, Sherlock-"
John shook his head in bewilderment, barely hearing the head-teacher's words past the ringing in his ears.
John found himself laughing a little hysterically, as Sherlock allowed his lips to stretch slowly into a smile in response.
"Then explain it to me." John asked him. "Please. I know your head races round a mile a minute sometimes but--help me understand it, Sherlock."
"Why shouldn't I? It's freezing out here, stop being so damn irritating and get in." John unlocked the car with his key-fob and climbed into the driver's seat, wiping the condensation from the windscreen with a sponge tucked in the holder at his right.
John heard the softest tap on the glass to his right, and pulled away from his bubble of self-pity to be met with the concerned face of Sherlock Holmes, his knuckles hovering against the window. He'd heard a clear "John?" before he had made probably one of the most risky and possibly stupid decisions of the day.
"I'm not going to stop trying, Mycroft. Because you need to think about something other than finding Sherlock, looking for Sherlock, worrying about Sherlock. I can see what this is doing to you, and it's only been a few days since I got involved."
Sherlock nodded, and then foolishly realised that John couldn't see his face, "Yes, fine."
"No! No- Sherlock," He blurted, smoothing a hand down the back of Sherlock's neck, resting it there as they pulled up to a lull in traffic. "Good- very good." he pressed a kiss to the corner of Sherlock's mouth, thrilling at the way his head turned to the left as if a magnetic force drew their lips together.
"Sibling rivalry?" Sherlock supplied at last.
"To what are you referring?" the baritone voice replied, and John swore he could detect a touch of innocence.
"Get in the car." the voice said, sounding way too familiar to be coincidental.
Sherlock eventually grimaced, ripping the photos into halves and quarters, sitting down and saying nothing.
"What the hell are you playing at?" John hissed in response, arms flailing about.
"Yes?" He prompts impatiently, finding the folder.
Sherlock remained still as John moved towards him, his hand settling on Sherlock's knee, where he was sat on one of the stools.
a teacher?" John wondered aloud, noticing how they were both standing apart from the general gaggle of students who were gathered by the coaches. "What else can you deduce?"
"You've got Dr Watson now, right? He's a nice guy, good teacher too." Lestrade nodded to himself. "Have you driven him spare yet?"
"Bloody car-" he muttered to himself as soon as he managed to haul himself up and over to the window, slamming it shut. He paused mid-yawn, stretching out his spine and wincing at the cracks, looking towards his forgotten phone on the bed-side table.
John vaguely noticed that most of the students that had been lined up had been evacuated to the field further away, cordoned off by tape and firemen surrounding the engines with three supporting ambulances. "Sherlock?  I- Are you- Is he okay?" John questioned earnestly, craning his neck around to see Sherlock's legs dangling from the back of the other ambulance, still coughing everywhere.
"Think about it?" Sherlock sighs finally, a hint of annoyance in his typical impatient manner, the brightness of the genius' eyes lighting the shadows that cast upon them behind the pillar. John's own eyes took in every inch of Sherlock's face before nodding slowly, letting his hand come to the back of Sherlock's neck and pressing his head forward with three strong spaced fingers.
Sherlock paused, "How realistic is it for us to continue this affair?"

Sherlock grunted at the idiocy of emotional bodily responses and immediately stormed back to his station, resolutely ignoring John who was now having a hard time controlling his laughter.
"Scotland?" John asked, bewildered.
"He called in sick, now if you don't mind-" Lestrade moved towards him, shooing him out of the door with a disapproving look on his face.
"John-" he gasped, his head falling backwards onto the pillow, as John's lips made their way up the column of his pale throat, making Sherlock question if he was even in the room anymore, his body felt so alight he wasn't sure he was even still connected to it.
Sherlock nodded once and rose, heading straight for the chemistry labs to purposefully avoid the student infested cafeteria.
Greg sighed, realising that his attempts were probably futile, and  threw his napkin on his plate, leaning back in his chair and gazing out of the window.
Sherlock stood, threading his fingers through the older man's damp hair at the back of his head. "Let's have dinner." he said, his voice surprisingly sultry.
They wound around each other, warming each other's skin with their hands and mouths, John flicking his tongue directly against one of Sherlock's nipples, which was obviously becoming a pressure point as Sherlock began to squirm underneath him.
Sherlock entered and walked straight over to John, who was slumped over his desk wearing reading glasses that slid down his nose persistently every time he straightened them.
"The thing is about Sherlock Holmes," he starts, "is you'll never really know if you're teaching him or if he is teaching you"
"Everything you're doing clearly isn't working, so why don't you take the next step? If you think he's in Scotland, get up there!" A voice somewhere in the back of Greg's head told him that he was probably being a bit too pushy, but his conscience wanted to scream and shout at Mycroft Holmes for just

hours
" He gritted his teeth. "What have you said to John?"
Greg didn't even hesitate, climbing into the dimly lit car with tinted windows. Foolishly, for some reason he'd expected Mycroft to be in one of the back seats, but they were empty. He didn't try to reason with the driver, just submitted silently and watched the buildings pass by with a gnawing touch of anxiety.
And that was it, Sherlock watched as John broke down before him, ­his frame shook with the pressure of bottling it all in, and Sherlock felt his knees weaken beneath him as he dropped to the floor in front of John's seat. "John-"
secret.

"Couldn't you  hear her?" he asked with confusion, clearing his throat and putting his hands in his pockets with the decency of being embarrassed by John's awestruck expression.
"How do you know?" John frowned, still breathing slightly irregularly from the running.
"Irritating", he fiddled with the knot at his throat.
"I- well," the head-teacher harrumphs in displeasure. "Yes. It is." He stands behind his desk.
"John," he hissed, keeping his voice down due to the open door. "Those classes are for imbeciles! I refuse to be deemed as the same standard as the scum of the school."
Sherlock brought his gaze back to the man before him, seeing the vulnerability in his eyes and feeling the anxiousness and anticipation coming off him in waves. He felt an increase of heartbeat, his pulse thrumming against his skin, and looked down at his own body with a frown as if it were betraying him personally. He suddenly heard Mycroft's warning in his head, knowing he should head straight home, not linger in the same place for too long, but John was asking him directly. John was asking
"Clearly." Mycroft grimaced.
Sherlock wasn't in John's class on Monday, and he found himself missing the sarcastic commentaries that he sometimes muttered under his breath from the front row that usually only John could hear. It was true that the class was quiet without him, not only because the students had nothing to laugh at or taunt, they sat stoically and copied notes from the board.
"Wha- wait a minute. What is it- it looks dead to me?" John pushed at the material of Sherlock's scarf covering the bird's head.
As soon as the door closed, he peeled off his coat and watched John's small but sturdy frame standing off to the side looking back at him with hooded eyes.
He dressed quickly afterwards, opting for a pale blue shirt and his second favourite suit.
"It wasn't like that." he sniffed in response, rolling his eyes up indignantly. John knew that it was, even if Sherlock wasn't willing to admit it, or hadn't realised the extent of it himself yet.
Before he had a chance to say anything, a knock sounded at the door, and John rushed to open it, revealing a Physics teacher that Sherlock wasn't familiar with. He slid out the door behind them while John was in conversation, and headed towards the stretch of Astroturf adjoined to the sports field to smoke.
The elder Holmes stumbled backwards from the force of Sherlock's aggressive push, colliding with the desk behind him, which skidded on its legs until reaching a raised floorboard.
"Soon I will know everything there is to know." Sherlock looked up at him, his eyes dancing like blue pools of excitement.
"There's never been anyone with your brain, your voice, your eyes, or your ridiculous upturned collar, or your stupid smoking habit, or your outrageously tempting lips-"
"Hate you," Sherlock bounces back. "And I have no idea why."
He smiled politely to his boss.
"I shouldn't have to push you into it, Sherlock. You're an expert Biology student, you know how poorly the body functions without any food source." John lectured.
"My house is closer. You may use the guest bedroom." he said, clearly uncomfortable with the surprising kindness of his gesture, and hoping silently that Lestrade wouldn't make a big fuss of it.
"I'm- God- Sherlock. I'm
I remember us alone, waiting for the light to go,
They were...staring at each-other.  Greg frowned.
"We shouldn't-" John started, contradicting himself by curling his hands in the folds of Sherlock's thick coat and urging Sherlock's body closer to his own.
"Maybe that
Mycroft crowded over him, a hand on the back of his chair. Greg certainly didn't envy the poor kid, having the pressure of such a man as Mycroft Holmes breathing down his neck.
"You...don't have friends?" John repeated.
With another frown, Mycroft decides he has had enough of this place today and leads the way back to the car.
"It's nothing I can't handle," John rushed to reassure him, "We just won't ever get to spend any time alone with him lurking, I guess he's.. protective?"
John shook his head, "Oh, but-"
"John?" he offered the packet to the shell-shocked man before him, attempting to send him a look that said
"Come on, hermit. Live a little." John winked at him before hauling himself up from the tangled heap of limbs on the sofa and heading straight for the coat rack. He shrugged on his own hoodless number before reaching for Sherlock's Belstaff, holding it out as an invitation for Sherlock to step into it.
