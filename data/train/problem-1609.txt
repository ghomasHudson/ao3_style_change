Sherlock thanks him with a nod before closing the door behind him, and John breathes out deeply. He heads to his room quickly, letting the towel fall and he can't help but grin as he finally notices the beginning of a erection making itself known. With no time to linger on the matter anymore, he changes into his clothes for the day, and he ignores another pang of disappointment when Sherlock exits the bathroom fully clothed.
Sherlock forces himself to regain some control over his own body, and replies quickly, “Over there. Baker Street.”
John looks back at him, licking his lips, and Sherlock leans in for another kiss. He rocks back against him, finding courage in the unknown, and he smiles when John’s moan echoes in the room. They kiss for a long moment, simply rubbing against each other until Sherlock isn’t sure he can take it any longer, “Please,” he breathes against John’s lips, arching on the bed, “More.”
“I won’t lie, I’m glad I am,” John laughs, fingers playing with his fork. “What do people usually do?”
He waits until she's taking her bag upstairs before taking a deep breath and heading to Sherlock's lab. He knocks twice, softly, "Sherlock?" With no reply, he opens the door slowly and peeks inside only to find Sherlock lying on the sofa there, eyes closed. He hesitates just a second before stepping in, deciding here and now he's not going to doubt himself again, and walks to the sofa. "Sherlock, I know you're not sleeping," he says, brushing a finger against Sherlock's temple, "or even locked in there."
“Serial killer,” Sherlock replies, remembering the thrill of a good chase. “They’re the best. Caught two already, but they tend to be rare.”
I only have to close my eyes to see the two of us lying in your bed, face to face, not speaking a word and yet telling the other
John wakes up alone the next morning, no longer facing the wall but Sherlock’s side of the bed. He wonders, just for an instant, how exactly they were lying when Sherlock woke up. He sure would have prefered to be the one waking up first. It takes a second more to remember the day before and Victor. Well aware of how much his attitude yesterday betrayed, John doesn’t waste another minute in bed. The last few days had been particularly perfect, bringing them closer than they had ever been, and he intends to make sure this Victor Trevor isn’t going to ruin it all.
And so John does, Sherlock’s eyes meeting his midway. He tries a small smile, silently telling this beautiful man that he doesn’t meant all that he said this week, that it was the fatigue and stress talking, and that he’s forgiving him for all his harsh words too. Sherlock smiles back, almost insecure, but John reads it all there too. The apologies, the doubts and promises.
“Sherlock, I don’t remember saying I was repulsed by the idea.” He gets up, breathing in deeply. “I simply don’t like the lying that it implies.”
Sherlock dismisses both the demand and compliment with a wave of his hand, focusing on the mass of people dancing in front of him. He plays for a time, deducing people here and there, partners or not, people who came in the hope of meeting someone, people who came for the first time, people who came simply to find someone to spend the rest night with. He looks at them all, read their life stories, ambitions and secrets, but finds that he does not care about any of them. Each and every one of those people, boring and without interest. He did not come here for them, but knows he’s going to have to become part of the group, part of the crowd.
Sherlock remains silent for a long moment, and when John looks back at him, he’s faced with a bright, trusting smile that makes his heart miss a beat, “I have no idea what I’m doing, John, but just like you seemed to know what you want from me, I know that this is what I want right now.”
Sherlock sits back next to him, glancing at Lestrade’s phone, “Are you saying I should reply, then?” Lestrade looks confused for a moment, and Sherlock rolls his eyes, “Yes, I’m asking for your advice.”
Sherlock nods, “I’m sorry I didn’t say anything, but you weren’t talking about it so I wasn’t sure what to d-”
Sherlock watches in awe as John’s entire body shiver with pleasure when he presses his own thigh to his pelvis. The heat radiating from John’s lower body, from the erect shape of his cock trapped in his pants, makes Sherlock want to ravish him. He shifts ever closer, if possible, and soon their faces are only inches apart. Staring down at John’s lips, Sherlock feels himself grow harder. But he looks down, focusing on all the point of contact between their bodies. Another sharp thrust of John’s thigh makes him gasp, and he pushes himself harder against John.
“No, I leave that to you, but I do have a bit of experience with post-coital people.” John smiled, feeling incredibly content that Sherlock hadn’t sprung up immediately after coming back to his senses. He had no idea how long it would stay like this but he was determined to enjoy it as long as possible.
"It's going to be just fine," Sherlock says, startling him, and John turns to look at him. "I'm certain Mummy has already set up her room with all too much toys and stuffed animals."
Lestrade glances at Sherlock, "You need to tell me if you did. I'd understand considering the situation. But if he claims that he's been maltreated during the arrest, he could-"
“No”, John shook his head, eyes wide, “Not by a long shot. That was amazing.” John paused, still staring at Sherlock before smiling as he asked, “If I bother you with how you did it, will you give me some evasive answer again or will you answer?”
Frozen in place, Sherlock watched as John secured the man’s arm and feet, his lips moving fast and his chest rising quickly. John was in his element, his body ready for any act of defense from Marks, and Sherlock felt an unfamiliar heat spread through his entire body.
I hated being part of making it happen. I hated being by your side. I hated playing that song for all of those people. I hated watching you dance with her. I hated giving that speech for all that was left unsaid, all that was to be read between the lines. I hated that the only pleasure I took was from solving the case because for just a second, it wasn’t your wedding anymore, for just a second, I forgot where I was. I hated that you laughed and smiled and held and kissed her. I hated your vows and your shaking hands when you took hers. I hated that I couldn’t control this
"Oh please, do shut up," Sherlock sighs, barely glancing at him as he walks out to the street to meet Lestrade.
Sherlock finds himself closing his eyes, desperately trying to hold onto the memory and flexing his own fingers slowly. He needs more data, he realises, looking up sharply toward the house.
John waits until he sees him disappear around the corner before closing his eyes and letting out a deep breath, "It's all right. Everything is going to be all right."
Happy to oblige, John pushes deeper, setting a pace without ever searching for Sherlock's prostate yet. He waits for another long minute before placing a second finger against Sherlock's hole, not inside but there, giving him the time to adjust. It's only when Sherlock nods at him that he pushes it inside, stretching Sherlock with each thrust. He resumes kissing his thigh when he feels him tense just a little, trying to distract him from any pain, and slowly, Sherlock is rocking back on his fingers again.
Case solved. Lestrade was right, it was an interesting one. 7/10. John would have loved it, just the right amount of clues and mysteries at the same time.
Sherlock drops his gaze, biting his lower lips before turning to walk away. He feels John’s stare on him all the way down the nearest corner.
As weird it sounds, it makes sense. Of course they would have needed each other after the pool incident. Even I, back then, could barely restrain myself from pulling John close and never letting go. It would have been so easy in the end. If this Sherlock managed to do so, why couldn’t I have done the same? Would John have gone into my arms and stayed there?
"Everything's fine," Sherlock asserts, walking past him to the kitchen and pouring himself a glass of water. He keeps his back turned to him, and John clenches his jaw, trying to shake the surprise off. "But you can't stay. Go home."
Mycroft doesn't reply just yet, and Sherlock hears in his silence all the lies he told himself over the years. "What could have been done before doesn't matter now, don't you think?"
With the contraction of Sherlock’s muscles as he came, John was pulled over the edge too, his eyes fluttering half way close. He pushed a couple of more times into the other, milking his own orgasm as well as providing additional stimulation. The way Sherlock had cried out, his face so very open and his hand moving fast on his gorgeous cock, everything had burned itself into John’s memory. Whatever would happened after that, this is how John wanted to remember Sherlock.
He wakes up again to the sound of violin being played downstairs. He doesn’t open his eyes just yet, chasing the ghost of Sherlock’s body against his. Having no idea how long he ended up sleeping, John figures just a few minutes more won’t hurt. He rolls to his stomach, looking for Sherlock’s pillow but finding that it doesn’t compare to thick, deep curls. Still, the fantasy of this morning lives on just a little longer.
The sound of Sherlock’s sharp inhale fills the room. John realises he really needs to go before finding himself walking back to him. He’s about to disappear in the hallway when he looks one last time to Sherlock.
Three whole months. That’s how long John had been back and yet, Sherlock would argue it had already been three years. Strange, how time seems to fly by when all is
Without breaking eye contact, John shifts their positions just so each new thrust are now making Sherlock shudder with pleasure. Feeling the first sign of an upcoming, shattering orgasm, Sherlock tries to warn John, but only another moan escapes his lips, a mix between John’s name and a groan.
John's breath catches, the knot in his chest loosening and his entire body shuddering, "A case?" he asks, relief flooding through his veins with each second that ticks by.
“I don’t,” John answers for him. “I’m fucking terrified of what it means, but I don’t regret it. The truth is, I’ve been thinking about that kiss for so long that it felt absolutely amazing, even more than I ever imagined, and if you’d only ask me, I’d be kissing you again right now.”
In less than a second, John is being dragged behind a staff door. The music fades away once the door is closed, and for a long moment, only the sound of breathing echoes in the small room. John doesn't dare to look up at Sherlock's face, focusing on getting his breath back under control instead and his entire body shivers when the hand still around his arm squeezes.
All coherent thoughts fall apart after that, and Sherlock holds on tighter to John, trying to pull him ever closer. He had never imagined kissing someone would be like
“Good thing I’ve found an army doctor then.” Sherlock smiled before opening the door to the airport, John smiling back at him before shaking his head.
Timothy glances back at his friend, his face breaking into something much sadder, “I was drunk,” he says, almost too quietly. “I was drunk and you had talked about that girl all day, and I realise I couldn’t do this anymore.”
John takes a first step towards the alley, the now complete silence sending him on the edge. He places a hand on his mouth, focusing on what might be happening, on each little sound and a sudden loud noise makes his heart stop. Not hesitating another second, he barges in to find Sherlock holding Matthew to the ground, a syringe in one hand and the other on Matthew's head.
“I will have so much fun taking you apart.” he hummed as he let his hands trail down Sherlock’s body. “You won’t know what’s happened to you.” John’s tongue was tracing a small pattern across Sherlock’s chest, occasionally sucking a small bruise to any body part that caught his eye. Quicker than he had planned he was on one height with Sherlock’s groin and once he had got a proper glimpse of the other’s cock, he didn’t really feel like holding back anymore. His mouth closed around the head first, letting his tongue enjoy playing with the frenulum for a bit.
But before he can gather up the courage to ask anything, John breathes, “Why don’t you get ready for bed, and I’ll make us some tea.”
In the end, when John finally broke the silence, it was to surprise Sherlock one more time. “So, what are your plans for Christmas?”
“Sherlock,” John smiles, leaning back in to kiss over his closed eyelids. “It’s not a bad idea, you know. It’ll take the edge off until later.”
"You," John breathes, now backed against the door. "With him." Sherlock arches an eyebrow, not saying a word, and John swallows with difficulty. "I couldn't believe you’re engaged," he continues. "I was convinced it was for a case, that you could be in danger."
“Then don’t think about it,” John cuts him, kissin the top of his head. “Don’t ever think about it again, because I’m never going to want to move from this bed ever again.”
It only takes twenty-five minutes for Montgomery to arrive, take the painting and drop them back home. John is already feeling the first signs of sleepiness as Toby greets them both with loud barks and happy jumps.
“Yes, of course. We could see about that case you told me about, and maybe go out for dinner, if you want?”
The mere notion of “parallel universes” was unknown to me before that, but John said he had read many books about these other realities as a teenager, and he seemed quite thrilled about the discovery. As you can expect, soon organisations all over the world were offering to find out about all the other universes you exist in. John and I stayed away from all of them at first, neither of us caring much about some other version of ourselves. Eventually something changed our mind, but we’ll talk about that later.
Sherlock rolls his eyes but there is a smile on his lips and John kisses it with a passion he had never believed imaginable. They kiss lazily for a long moment, neither of them moving until Sherlock is canting his hips in a clear invitation. John guides himself blindly, massaging Sherlock's entrance with the head of his cock before beginning to push in slowly.
“I was chasing a suspect,” Sherlock replies, already feeling more at ease with the change of subject.
The sound of the door opening behind John makes them both jump, Mrs Hudson’s voice just a bit surprised as she says, “Boys, what are you doing standing there?”
John smiled softly and kissed him gently. “Bit of a romantic?”, he asked but didn’t really leave time for an answer as he claimed Sherlock’s lips again in an instant. After all he was a doctor, he didn’t need to see to know what he was doing. Carefully, as if Sherlock was a prized possession which could easily break in half if you touched him wrongly, John circled one slick finger around the puckered muscle. It was a simple act of persuading a few muscles to relax, nothing more. The first breach of his finger was punctuated with a soft whine. John stopped, making sure Sherlock eased into the sensation before he continued to prep him with one finger. He liked to used just one single digit for a  nearly torturous amount of time. It usually got his partner back into the game and Sherlock was no different. Soon he was writhing and pushing down.
Sherlock studies him for a long moment, reading all of it, now bare on John's face, "I couldn't trust myself. Couldn't let myself believe what I was seeing," he breathes. "What if I had been wrong? It could have ruined what we already had."
Sherlock joins him for diner, and as their feet brush under the table, John accepts the silent apology.
This can’t ruin the chance he’s not even sure he has in the first place. A chance he’s been trying to ask for too long. For Christ sake, for
Sherlock watches silently as Lestrade’s fingers begin to type on his phone quickly. He stares and can’t help but recite the words he already knows by heart in his head. John, after just one kiss, had been looking for him all over the Internet, trying to find him again. It could only mean he had liked the kiss just as much, that maybe he hadn’t been able to think about anything else since, and for a moment, Sherlock feels better about it all. It can only mean it’ll be alright, that John has done this before and he’ll know what to do next, he could guide him, guide them both and there’s a chance Sherlock could pretend he knows what he’s doing too.
“You’ve talked a lot, mostly nonsense about the case or some experiment,” John continues, the hand between them playing with the sheet. “You’ve said some things about me too.”
Sherlock nods quickly, letting one hand slide down John’s back, hoping to be obvious enough, but John stops him, “Hold on, love. There’s no need for that now, is there?”
Unable to suppress a wave of relief, John finds himself now expecting impatiently Sherlock’s footsteps up. He’s been sleeping for the last four nights and there’s a high chance he’ll soon decide sleep is boring again, but not tonight apparently. John doesn’t give any sign of being awake when Sherlock joins him, keeping the lights off and getting into bed almost too quietly.
“Okay, well you know where to find me if you get bored.” John hummed and grabbed his key card, “Feel free to join me any time.”
“No you wouldn’t,” John smiles, getting into the car after him. “It was silly and filled with magical creatures.”
, this is exactly how he wants to wake up for the rest of his life. This is exactly how he wants to fall back asleep, even just for a few minutes.
John represses a laugh at the confusion on Sherlock’s face, and he kisses him softly, “We’ll deal with that later.”
Sherlock complied, letting John undressed him slowly and he couldn’t help but noticed how the pace had changed as John took his time to remove each sleeve. Sherlock watched him, not saying a word as John continued to kiss his now naked upper body. First the inside of his wrist, his tongue darting out to lick along one prominent vein before moving to the crook of his elbow, nipping gently at it. It was all so tender and Sherlock closed his eyes, letting out a content sigh as John continued his discovery. He had thought the previous frenzy of their movements would have lead to a storm of passion but John seemed to have decided otherwise. Sherlock almost felt as if John was taking his time on purpose, exploring Sherlock’s body with precision. Just the way Sherlock would have done it if he wanted to commit every detail to memory.
Sherlock shrugs, moving ever closer. John inhales deeply, eyes falling to Sherlock’s lips. Both of their rapid breathing are echoing in the room. John uses his free hand to stroke up Sherlock’s arm, shoulder and neck, settling against his nape and pulling just a little.
John smiles, tilting his head to the side, and Sherlock realise he’s now cupping it in one hand, “I know exactly what you means, and even if I would have also love to let it hang in the air a little longer, I also know I cannot go another second without kissing you.”
I can't remember the exact moment when I realised the two people that count the most for me weren't entirely happy.
That was what you got, wasn’t it? Keeping up a relationship long distance was already hard and not made easier if one party was in the army. He saw the way his mates suffered. The way they bashed out every last piece of opportunity and time to get an e-mail, a letter or a call in to their loved ones. While John really missed the security and love a relationship offered, he also felt lucky at least as long as he was on deployment. Now, the thought of returning to a partner for the holidays was so much more appealing than going to his sister. He sighed. Getting down about something you couldn’t change simply wouldn’t cut it tonight. Even if Sherlock wasn’t down here and even if it was just one night, John would do his damnedest to get that.
He could catch the early train and be there by ten if he hurries, having learned the train schedule years ago. He glances around the room, taking it all in one last time, this room he had hated with all of his being the first time he slept here. The room that had been the silent witness of his dreams for more and his tears when facing reality. Still, he smiles when his gaze stops on the drawing Rosie made when she was five, still spending all of her free time trying to improve her art skills, and decides to pull it off the wall and fold it into the suitcase. Sherlock always loved this drawing. In the end, he only need to reach into his pocket to find the small piece of paper that could have changed his life years ago, the edges frayed and the ink used to write down the address almost dried out.
“Yes,” Sherlock replies, somehow managing to keep his eyes on John the whole time. “Sure you don’t want to come, John?”
Sherlock remains silent and still for a long minute, just the time for John to truly get around what he just offered. Obviously an half naked Sherlock has never been much help to clear thinking, and the currently advanced hour isn’t helping in the slightest, but with each seconds ticking by, John realises he might have talked too fast.
Sherlock shuts his eyes tight, the words he wished to speak so many times on the tip of his tongue and the same fear he’s experienced all these years spreading throughout his entire body. Is this why John had come then? To be friends again? To continue just like they had done all this time?
He walks past his bedroom door, eyes fixed on the kitchen table, certain he could do it this morning, could just ignore it and just have one normal day. But there is a hole in his chest, ever expanding, and without bothering to repress a sigh, he goes back in, directly for the night stand. He checks, because really, who is he kidding, and it almost doesn’t hurt when Rosie’s picture appears on the screen. Just her picture.
This is important, Sherlock. It took me months to let it sink in, months where I should have been enjoying the little moments with John, but instead I spent them worrying about
He had almost forgotten John’s presence. To Sherlock’s surprise, John hadn’t tried to ask any further questions and had stayed silent for the last ten minutes without complaining. Surely the army had taught him to stay in place for a long time and not make a sound, but Sherlock had expected more curiosity from the man. He hadn’t even explained the whole situation, but John didn’t seem to mind. Sherlock couldn’t help but wonder when John would stop surprising him.
John lets him close it back silently, unable to move for a long moment. A thousand new pieces of information race through his head, a delirious mix of ‘Sherlock isn't engaged’ and ‘Sherlock is in danger’ that makes it hard to focus on anything else. With one finger lingering against his lips, he takes a deep breath and looks up sharply at the door. Danger. He needs to focus on that only now. Sherlock needs him to be prepared, needs him to remain close, needs him.
"I was happy you came back home," Sherlock breathes, refusing to meet John's eyes again. "But the years that followed only made it harder and harder to remain silent."
Tom had arrived at the clinic a few months ago, and somehow, one drunken night at the club, John had confessed his undying love for his gorgeous flatmate/bestfriend (Tom’s words the next day). Burning shame had followed John’s around for days after that, each time they cross path, but turned out Tom had, also quite drunkenly, sworn to help him get that fine beauty genius (his words again) and intended to do so very seriously.
With one last slightly harder nip to one of the red buds, he pushed Sherlock’s hand down towards his trousers. “I’m sure your clever fingers can get me out of these” He breathed and then straightened up again, looking down at Sherlock hungrily.
He's not sure how long he stands still as his ringtone fills the air, but when his brain catches up on the fact, his phone has stopped. He takes it out quickly, fearing for the briefest of seconds that John might be in trouble, but he's surprised to read Mycroft's name on the screen. His hesitation lasts barely a second before he's calling him back, focusing back on his breathing as he waits for his brother to answer.
Leading the way, Sherlock goes over the details of the case one last time,  and John listens carefully. An old woman died in her bed a month ago, all doors and windows locked and yet the death had been noted as an homicide. The Police had tried to determine how she had been murdered for weeks, but when her children decided to ask for a second autopsy it was determined it was in fact a natural death. Still, Montgomery had kept the file and the second Sherlock had seen the picture of her bedroom, he had declared they needed to go.
Sherlock hums his agreement, remaining exactly where he is, watching, for another long moment. John doesn’t pay more attention to him than usual. Sherlock tends to watch closely each time cuisine is involved, not quite often doing it himself, but apparently enjoying the making of it all.
“I want…” Sherlock tries again but apparently chooses to kiss him instead, and John happily lets him. His own moans get swallowed when Sherlock’s hands end up on his arse, adding more pressure to their rocking bodies, and he threads his own fingers into Sherlock’s curls. “This.”
“You didn’t!” John laughed, maybe two hours later as Sherlock explained how he confronted the chief of police on national television. “You’re completely mad.”
“Not really,” Sherlock replies, not looking up. “That lawyer was clearly driven by resentment and did a poor job covering his trace.”
Sherlock is certain he’s blushing again, and he pretends to be searching for Angelo to look away from John. He needs to regain some posture or else this is going to end with John laughing in his face, or even worse, realising just how lost he feels.
Since Sherlock and John are now talking, I'm gonna use this format a bit more,  I hope it won't be too confusing.
“What about your cabin?” John says, wincing as he straightens back up. Kneeling for so long really hadn’t been a good idea. “I want to see that too.”
“It was, despite it all, a very nice evening,” John smiles, sounding hesitant all the sudden. “Yeah?”
John licks his lips, dozens of questions on the tips of his tongue. "The two of you seemed pretty close," he says instead.
"This is insane," John breathes, once again stricken by just how much Sherlock had put himself in danger.
She stares at him, eyes still full with sleep, before looking at Sherlock. John follows her stares, and finds Sherlock looking back.
John forces himself to breathe out slowly. He checks his suit one last time, hands shaking as he tightens his tie. He looks back at the road just in time to see Lestrade waving at them, pointing to an empty parking place just across the road. Harriet parks quickly and they get out to meet him.
It’s not the first time he’s gone to a club. He used to go every week back when drugs were so easy to find in such places, but he has to admit it’s been a while since he indulged in simply
The victim was divorced, his ex-wife remarried, happy and most of all, living across the Atlantic Ocean. No close family, not many friends, no relationship known to his neighbors.
John reaches for his leg, pulling it up until he can lock them together better, now perfectly feeling the outline of Sherlock's erection against his own. “God, you’re so beautiful.”
Sherlock nods, too focused on watching John stand up and walk to the bathroom to reply anything at all. He waits until he hears the door closing before letting out a deep sigh and closing his eyes. He’s still stroking the journal, trying to find that warm feeling that had overwhelmed him when he had opened his gift, remembering with a trembling precision the smile that had lit John’s face then. Of course, he had himself spent hours trying to find the perfect gift for John, and he had little doubt the set of authentic books John liked so much would be a bad idea, but still. He hadn’t expected to feel this incandescently happy opening a present, and the fact that it came from John had, in the end, everything to do with it.
“That was fast,” Lestrade says, the smile obvious in his voice, and Sherlock finds he can’t help but smile either. “Molly is a bit young to have studi-”
As you can see, this letter is introducing the whole sexual aspect of this fic, so this is a little reminder that this fic will be an explicit one, just in case this isn't something some of you enjoy.
John holds his stare, searching Sherlock's eyes for any sign he might be lying but finding only determination and focus there. They both jump in surprise when Lestrade gets into the car, turning the engine on with a loud sigh. They drive in silence for a long moment, Lestrade talking over the radio to his officer.
Sherlock doesn’t reply, simply going for the cupboard above the sink and bringing back scotch and two glasses with him. He pours them both some before sitting in his chair, raising his glass towards John’s and taking a first sip. John remembers to do the same, not watching Sherlock’s lips closing around the glass. The liquor is warm down his throat, his head already buzzing.
“I have a feeling you’ve been adding more than there was when you told him,” John says, not sure when exactly Sherlock had woken up and what he already heard.
That being said I know you’re still going to need time to process everything that happened, and I expect the two of you to still
Sherlock complies immediately, pressing their bodies together and melting against him. John lets him find the position he wants, leaving kisses here and there and enjoying the small shivers running up and down Sherlock’s arms. When Sherlock finally decides that he’s best with his back pressed to John’s chest, he stops and breathes out deeply.
“Sorry about your plan.” John’s voice came on his right and Sherlock didn’t try to hide his smile as he turned to face him.
Sherlock nods, and they both walk to the kitchen without another word. Sherlock sits down, coat still on, and he finds himself wondering if he should take it off. John is wearing his usual green dressing gown, looking strangely awake for the hour, and once again, Sherlock bites back each questions threatening to breach his lips.
John swallows back a laugh, searching for the right words for a long moment, “But you know it can be, an issue I mean.”
He really knows you - the other you. I’m jealous of their relationship. They have no secrets. They tell each other everything. That’s what I want for us. I want to know all that’s going through your head each time you look at me for long minutes, not talking, not moving. I want to know what you see, what you read on me that’s so mesmerizing. You’ve always looked at me so differently than everyone else, and I always - always - loved being under your studying stare. It made me feel special, somehow. But yesterday, the two of us sitting at that table in a crowded restaurant, your stare made me feel as if we were completely alone. You’ve stopped hiding, Sherlock, and being able to read it all on
“Just making sure,” Victor replies, smiling again. “I didn’t want to try anything again if you two were a thing.”
Sherlock is about to contest that when he comes to realise what John is implying. Feeling himself blush again, he breathes in slowly, “Interesting?”
Sherlock, apparently pleased, heads back downstairs, leaving him alone. John falls on his back again, sighing louder. So much for compromising positions. He doesn’t linger on the slight disappointment washing over him, getting to his feet instead and picking an outfit for the day. Sherlock is pacing when he gets downstairs. His phone in hand, he looks up while John puts on his shoes.
"I know," John replies, taking Sherlock by surprise as he presses his lips to his forehead slowly. "But I'm glad I had those years with you. I'm glad Rosie got to grow up surrounded with love. I'm glad I got to go to bed every night knowing you were safe."
John stands up, hiding his hands behind his back, “We’re not.” He focuses on his breathing, in and out, slow. “I’m going to go get what we need to eat.”
John stares at him for a long moment and Sherlock realises what he just said must sound like. Here he is, vocally wishing there were more serial killers to catch. Exactly the sort of behavior that makes every officer at the Yard hate him. He looks down at his plate, trying to find a way to fix it before John can find an excuse to leave, but another laugh makes him look up.
“You told me that, yes, it was all fragile and uncertain, but not for us. Because we deserve this, because we fought our way to each other for years and when all had seemed lost, we found our way back. You told me there was nothing fragile about us or the love we shared, nothing uncertain about the future we are heading towards together. Because you’re you and I’m me, and that’s all that matters. So, as I said, you are absolutely brilliant, John Watson, and I am the luckiest person on earth to be loved by you.”
“I know,” Sherlock replies, smiling. “I thought you would never fall asleep. I was too afraid to go first and do something in my sleep while you were still awake.”
"She knows my name," Sherlock breathes, and only loud laughter from across the street stops John from pulling him into his arms. Sherlock's eyes glance to the group of students, tensing again. "I'll wait for you upstairs," he declares, opening the door and John watches him climb the stairs without a word.
John stops dead, eyes going from Sherlock’s figure, wearing only his pajamas pants, to the giant, greenish hole in his matress. Relief washes over, accompanied by an uncontrollable giggle.
Sherlock feels his own lips curl into a smile, feeling John’s heartbeat under his fingers and finding it pounding just as hard  as his.
XX32: So you just expect me to believe you got a letter, no wait, TWO letters from another Sherlock in some other universe. (
Sherlock doesn't move, and John stops when he's close enough to discern his profile. Yes, he smiles, staring at the stars. They remain silent for what could be hours, but John knows barely a few minutes pass before his lets his voice fill the air, "Why didn't you tell me?"
“I used a cellphone and a roof, and hurt you,” Sherlock replies, hating how his own body remains him of all the places John had left scars on, visible and not. “But this morning, you used your hands and your lips and kissed me, John, and I’d rather focus on that than anything else.”
. The private smiles blooming on John’s lips whenever their eyes meet in public. The hand against his back when they get into a cab. John stepping just a bit closer whenever they’re walking together. Sharing an umbrella on rainy days. Holding hands while watching tv, shopping, walking in the park or falling asleep. John’s panting breath against his lips, his neck, his thighs. The soft and quiet “Ok?” whenever he emerges from his mind palace. John’s feet against his own under the table. Snuggling for warmth. John’s laugh, especially when he can feel it directly against his skin. John’s eyes when he wakes up, John’s eyes when he’s about to fall asleep. John’s hand exploring all of him, John’s mouth exploring all of him. John, John,
Sherlock lifted himself up, resting on his elbows for a moment as he watched John get up. He let his eyes run over the detailed muscular chest in front of him, not quite missing the way John smirked when he caught him staring. Sherlock shook his head, his hands already unbuttoning his trousers as John searched for the supplied they needed. He efficiently removed both trousers and pants in one smooth movement, John’s words still echoing in his mind. He barely had the time to lie back before John turned to face him again. Sherlock let one of his hand slide down his chest, the other tightening in the sheets. He smiled as John licked his lips, the habit giving away John’s obvious thoughts.
“I-” John begins but stops, sighing. “She’s been helping me with what I did to you, with my anger, with all the things I’ve kept to myself.”
Sherlock’s parents are busy in the kitchen when they come in, getting everything ready for lunch. Sherlock pretends he needs to check on something, remaining vague about it all, but John knows he probably just needs a some time alone to process all they just talked about. He lets him go with one last squeeze around his hand, smiling until Sherlock disappears up the stairs. He then goes to join Violet and help set up the table, making small talk. Sherlock comes back down only when Patrick calls for lunch. John keeps the seat next to him free and smiles at him softly when Sherlock sits down.
John shifts closer, taking him by surprise, and places their still laced fingers against his heart. Sherlock can feel it pounding and he stares down at John's chest. "That's the reason why now," John declares, so very close. "There's no more hiding now."
Sherlock whimpered and pushed his body upward again as he took hold of his own throbbing cock, knowing too well John would love to see him touch himself while riding his cock. He didn’t try to hold back any of his moans, the room already filled with the obscene of their bodies slamming together. Sherlock stroke himself quickly, his hand wet with sweat and precome. He made sure to look at John while he brought himself off, knowing his orgasm would send John over the edge himself and Sherlock wanted to engrave John’s face as he came into his memory into his memory.
He isn’t sure yet how to let himself experience all the mixed feelings that had erupted inside his chest after finishing Sherlock’s letter, but John is finding that slow anticipation and excitement - as well as a paralyzing fear - are starting to take over everything else. He straightens his back, reaching for the letter and reading over the last few lines once again. He already knows most of it by heart, but he can’t help himself, smiling as he reads once again Sherlock’s description of his wedding. He knows he should be at least a bit upset, after all his own best friend is saying how much he hated this very special day they spent hours planning, but John couldn’t care less about all he
They stare at each other just a little too long. John clears his throat, looking down and giving up on finding anything else to say. He nods twice instead, fleeing. The bed upstairs is just as they left it this morning, unmade and undeniably baring the traces of both their bodies. John gets to his side, breathing in and out slowly. Treacherous as always, time flies by, and before John can totally assimilate the fact that they’ll be spending another night together, Sherlock is climbing up the stairs and joining him.
John raised a questioning eyebrow, and Sherlock shrugs, "Silence of the Lambs, a serial killer that removes his victim's skin."
Sherlock shakes his head, kissing him again and pressing their bodies even closer together. “Why can’t it be both?”
John nods slowly, “The moment I noticed you, I couldn’t stop myself. Someone was trying to get closer, to dance with you, but you had your eyes closed and he wasn’t sure, but when he reached for you and you pushed him back, I knew I couldn’t just stand there and wait for the one that you wouldn’t push away.”
He looks back at Sherlock, unclenching his fingers and standing up, "Sherlock," he calls, waiting for him to turn around and face him. "Will you have any breakfast?"
The strangest thing has happened to me in the past few days, and it seems I can’t keep it to myself any longer. Please, do try to understand before thinking I’ve lost my mind.
You said at the end of your letter that you want us not to be afraid, but the truth is that I am. Just writing this letter is scaring me to no end. I am not allowed to ruin what we’re slowly building. I can’t be the source of what goes wrong or else I would never forgive myself. I can’t let my inexperience get in the way, can’t let my fear of what’s all yet to come be in the way. But at the same time, I can’t remain silent. I can’t do that to you. You deserve to know, deserve to be trusted with these feelings I can’t seem to be able to control. You opened yourself up to me, bared your thoughts and left nothing to hide. How could I not do the same?
“Sherlock?” John’s concerned voice asks, and Sherlock realises they’ve stopped in the middle of the kitchen.
It takes another deep breath before Sherlock finally manages to say it out loud, the three words that had been dancing in his head without never breaching his lips. "John loves me."
“You’ve changed a lot since that last rehab,” Lestrade continues anyway. “And despite what everyone else thinks, I know you care about people. You deserve to know what it’s like to have someone who cares for you in their own special way.”
Sherlock considers the DI’s words for a second, his mind blank and his heart beating just a little too fast. He looks down at the phone, still in Lestrade’s hand, and finds himself thinking about John. Is he staring at his own phone, waiting for him to reply? Lestrade starts to type, making him jump, “What are you doing?”
And Sherlock doesn’t want to hear it, doesn’t want to listen to excuses for what they’re about to. He shakes his head, staring down at John’s hand still pressed on his chest, and takes a deep breath, “Continue.”
Can you still remember this day? Or the one that followed? Six years has passed, and yet I can remember each minute with a strange accuracy. Some days, I wonder if I’d ever forget. I am not sure I can. I cherish these memories John. They marked the beginning of our friendship, of the life we shared, even just for a while. I often find myself thinking back on those first few days, when you hadn’t moved in yet, when you chose to save my life after barely knowing anything about me. We never did talked about this, not like we oathed to have.
It’s written all over John’s face, in each wrinkles around his eyes, in each smiles directed only at him, in each lingering brush of their hands. John Watson is going to kiss him, and Sherlock’s entire body is shivering with anticipation. He knows John is going to wait for Rosie to be in her room, unlikely to come out again, and then, he might even wait just a little longer just to be sure. But it’s alright, more than alright, because Sherlock has been waiting for this moment a very long time, and really, what are a few more minutes?
he said, as if knowing a secret John still hasn’t discovered. The time to get ready for the date comes quicker than expected, and suddenly, a bundle of stress begins to grow down John’s stomach. He takes a rather long time in the bathroom, pretending Sherlock hasn’t deduced why already. He goes through one two, three different shirts before picking one and then makes sure to put on his date shoes, glad to have taken them with him for the trip. He’s still isn’t sure why Sherlock called them so, probably because they are his fanciest, but John finds that if it proves Sherlock just how serious he is about it all, then he can call those shoes whatever he wants.
John slacked his lips around Sherlock’s cock and pulled off slowly. He batted his eyelashes up at his lover. “So desperate already? God, I haven’t even started with you, yet.” He chuckled and gently pulled his teeth over one protruding hipbone. “Let’s see if I can make you scream in the end. What do you think about the whole hotel knowing that you were fucked through the mattress on Christmas? I think it would be a marvellous idea, finding out if that posh voice of you can get hoarse and rough.” John had noticed that Sherlock had been completely thrown off his game when he had first started talking to him, as if no one had ever voiced a word during sex with him. Even if he wanted to John couldn’t hold himself back with all the dirty thoughts running through his head. Sherlock simply inspired a string of profanities and a tug of possessiveness that John resolutely pushed aside. He only had tonight but he would make it count.
You wake up next to him and it’s like all winning numbers on your lottery ticket, it’s like bursting into bright laugher at the most unexpected time, it’s like pushing the door open and thinking with a smile
They board the train barely two minutes before departure, Quentin having gone silent again. None of them talk much for the entire travel actually. Sherlock, having clearly found something interesting enough there, spends the next two and half hours on his phone. John takes advantage of the peace and quiet to close his eyes and rest. Somehow managing to shut down every distracting thoughts, he ends up teasing the edge of sleep far enough to actually feel a bit more alarmed when they arrive.
“You,” Sherlock repeats. “With your ugly jumpers and your tendency to run after suspect and tackle them to the ground. Very distracting.”
“Sherlock, this is Tom, a colleague,” John says, unable to stop himself from smiling. “Tom, this is Sherlock, my boyfriend.”
Feeling himself blush, he begins to retreat, taking back his hand from John’s, but John tugs him back in. “No,” he whispers. “Body heat.” Sherlock wants to laugh, wants to tell him he really doesn’t have to, but the words are a thorn inside his throat. “It’s perfectly normal,” John continues. “Closeness tends to do that to people.”
Sherlock meets his eyes, the two of them staring at each other from across the room, before nodding and disappearing into the bathroom. John sets down the table quickly, stopping the music and putting the main dish on the table. He sits down, taking advantage of the few minutes left to check his mail and ends up saving one that seems quite urgent.
3) It’s probably the right time to confess that I never loved Mary. There’s not much to say about this, really. I was fond of her, liked her very much, but never loved her like I should have. In the end, it’s probably for the best, considering all she did, and maybe I even knew deep down what kind of woman she truly was. In any case, she was simply the woman I married because I was too afraid to do anything else.
surprising fact, receiving a letter from another version of myself, or that other version of myself is married to John?
It takes a few minutes more for Sherlock to speak again. John waits patiently with some more kissing, smiling when he feels Sherlock relax in his arms again.
That’s why, as he came into the next of the airport hotels, walking into a fully decorated foyer, John had to bite his lip when he spotted the dark mop of curls in front of him. He could just walk past Sherlock and hope the other would either not see or simply ignore him. But that was too much effort, and in total honesty, John had learned not to let a second chance pass right before his eyes. So he stalked up behind Sherlock, ready to face whatever the night would offer.
"He's alright, don't worry," she says quickly, but still showing no signs of letting him inside. "But maybe tonight isn't a good time."
So really, tonight is only taking the next step, the one Sherlock has been dreaming about for years and even more so in the past few weeks. He knows John is just as eager and nervous, and that he’s probably thinking about it right now too, and it makes his own anticipation build up.
“The guests will understand,” Harriet says, stopping at a red light. “I’m sure most of them bet that something like this would happen.”
Still no answer. Anger building up again, he grabs his keys and heads out without a goodbye. He purposely doesn’t look up once out, not willing to know whether Sherlock is still there, watching. The whole way to work, John tries to get Victor out of his head, and especially all that he was and could still be.
It all happens in a blur, from John’s mouth descending to his neck to the feeling of their bare erections brushing together when they finally manage to remove both of their pants. Sherlock catalogues it all, in between moments of complete bliss, and hopes each time will feel just a marvelous as this one. On a silent accord, they slow back down the moment John’s fingers slide down his sides and to his hips. Sherlock exhales loudly, nails dug into John’s back, and looks down to watch him kiss his way to his navel.
"I'll take Batman," John replies, taking out his debit card and paying quickly. "Can I change here?"
She gets out first, and Sherlock holds him back when John moves to follow, "I do too," he says quickly, holding on tightly to his hand. "Love you."
, he thinks. The perfect to start they’re holiday where they are supposed to be a family and, apparently, madly in love. Sherlock can’t be sulking as soon as they arrive.
John doesn't reply just yet, studying Sherlock closely and realising he had been suspecting something was off for a while now. Ever since Mummy Holmes had called, actually. Sherlock had informed him that they were going to spend four days there, and John had barely been able to ask why before Sherlock had stormed out of the flat. He had continued to avoid the subject ever since, and John had only managed to find out that his parents had been asking to see Rosie for quite some time now.
“Not sure he thanked us the last time we earned him a meeting with his superior,” John points out, pushing the TV back against the wall.
Let’s begin this letter with what you’ve probably been obsessing about since the first one (don’t try to deny it, I would have too): yes, I’m married to John Watson. We’ve been married for twenty-seven years now, but I’m not here to talk about that.
John doesn't quite meet her eyes as he says, "Thank you again, Mrs H." He waits until he hears the door closing to walk down the street, refusing to let himself think about whether Sherlock is or isn't currently showering with his fiancé. He needs to focus, need to master his plan. But first of all, he needs to find a costume.
Sherlock doesn’t reply just yet, eyes fixed on his drink, and his voice is barely above a whispers when he finally says, “It was written all over their home, in every picture or notes on the fridge. Timothy spends his days in that flat, living with the person he feels so strongly about, and has to watch him see and date other people. Of course leaving was his only solution.”
"Yes or No answer?" John replies, smiling. Sherlock rolls his eyes, and John kisses him softly. "Go ahead."
. He keeps his eyes shut, knowing he isn’t going to fool Sherlock anyway. He waits until he’s under the cover, dozen of questions on his lips but none getting out.
John chuckles, all of their guests joining in. A small, private smile blooms on Sherlock’s lips, and John loves him just a little harder.
“Why?” John asks in a whisper. “Why would you want to remember it all when it means we can never move past it?”
“I’m sorry dear, I’ve looked for Sherlock but he isn’t here. Did you know there is a hole in his mattress?”
"That's the thing you had to do," Arnold says, and John catches him nodding toward Sherlock. "Ex-boyfriend?"
“You don’t want to continue for hours, trust me. One room will be fine. I’m used to worse places than a hotel room floor. We’ll take the room.” He smiled friendly and already put down his card on the desk, trying to prevent Sherlock from arguing. He was a bit surprised when the other actually kept quiet and let him sort out their accommodation.
Sherlock doesn’t have time to reply, the woman coming back with their main meal, but John doesn’t need him too. He can see it on his face, clear as day. All that there is left to tell each other and all that there is yet discover about each other. John finds that he cannot wait to embark on the journey.
They kiss once more, Sherlock being the one to resume their movement. John pulls away, staring down to Sherlock’s eyes again. He finds himself whispering, surely nonsense, but Sherlock smiles and moans and calls out his name until finally John is fully inside him.
John, pleased to no end that Sherlock is acting like himself again, chooses this moment to say, “Do you want to look at what we did so far?”
“No,” he protests the second John pulls away, and doesn’t give him the time to say anything before chasing back his mouth in a demanding kiss. He’s the one to part John’s lips this time, keeping both hands in his hair to make sure he won’t try to escape again. John is smiling, and Sherlock marvels at the mere possibilities of tasting that smile, of making it his in every sense of the word.
John’s entire body is now itching to be touching Sherlock’s, the two of them on the edge of their chairs, and the memory of a blurry night comes back to John without warning, taking all the breath out of him. He’s not sure who moved first, or if they just acted as one, but suddenly his hands are cupping Sherlock’s face and their lips are brushing ever so softly. Not bothering to repress yet another shiver, John presses in and,
Their mixed scent was still settled deeply in the sheets and Sherlock knew it would take him hours to fall asleep.
He closes his eyes, wishing all thoughts away and practically falling off the bed at the sound of the front door closing. Heart racing, he pushes away Sherlock pillow and rolls to his back, hands clasped on his stomach. Footsteps to the first floor, kitchen, bathroom. Shower then, quick, teeth and pajamas. The stairs.
1) I failed my mom and sister. No matter what Harry said, no matter what my mom used to say, I didn’t protect them the way I should have. My dad hurt them in ways he never dared to use on me, and I let him. I was too scared to do anything, too scared he would lash out if I said something, did something. Too afraid he’d hit them harder, just to punish me. So I never tried, never raised my voice, and simply closed my eyes and covered my ears when my mom’s cries were too loud. I was a coward, and it doesn’t matter that I was only a child, we hear stories every day of kids doing the
"I didn't even think when I came to lie down here," Sherlock replies, closing his eyes. "I left you alone to deal with the dishes and Rosie and Mrs Hudson."
never said anything, I know what I could have done the very next day after John moved in. I know that I came close to doing so many times by now.
2) Ella would have probably loved to hear this one, and yet I’ve never managed to get it out, but I’m going to try. I, and it really shouldn’t be so bloody hard to say, always felt romantic/sexual attraction to both women and men. Even when I was just a kid, playing at school and pretending to get married to my best friend, Pierre. We didn’t care, not the slightest, and when his big brother told us boys are supposed to love and get married to girls, it only striked me as very unfair. Pierre grew out of it, probably, but I didn’t. I kissed girls in middle school but dreamt of holding hands with this boy in my math class every night. It’s not that I didn’t like kissing girls - I enjoyed it a lot, in fact, but when I finally kissed Mark Steven in High School, I realised kissing boys was just as enjoyable, maybe even a bit more so. And, Christ, enjoy kissing him I did. Still now, those are some of my most cherished memories, hidden in the back of the rugby field, hands daring to explore the other’s body freely. And yet, I continued to date women in public, cutting all relations with Mark and boys after graduation and focusing on women only. At least… At least until the army. Maybe this should be another number on this list, but let’s just say the army turned out to be much more open than I had imagined. I kissed and held and touched men, letting myself discover this part of my sexuality that I’d always feared. And then I was back home, back to women, dating and even marrying one. If I were to be completely honest (that being the purpose of this letter in fact) I’d say that I’ve always prefered being with men, but felt more comfortable being out with women. It doesn’t take your genius mind to know what it means…
"I didn't bloody care about my engagement," John asserts. "I should have put an end to it all sooner, when I realised I would never love her the way I love you, that I would never care for her the way I care for you. For god’s sake, she shot you Sherlock. For a minute there, you were dead. You died and she didn’t apologized, never.” He closes his eyes, breathing out deeply. “You've always been the one person I imagined myself growing old with, Sherlock." Sherlock remains silent, watching him closely for several seconds. "I hope you'll find a way to forgive me, one day."
