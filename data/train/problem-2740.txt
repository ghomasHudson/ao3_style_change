“Breathe through your mouth.” I open the door and fetch the nasal spray from the living room. I’m exhausted. I didn’t get much sleep lately. It’s almost as bad as when I was living with Sherlock.
Sherlock can see the anger crawling onto his husband’s face. “Oh so that’s the issue here? You were afraid I wasn’t
John smiled and felt Sherlock chuckle next to Rosie. They exchanged a look over her head.
It would be much easier to hate Mary, Sherlock thinks. He could blame her for his misery and everything would be fine. But how can he hate someone who puts John’s happiness above her own? How can he hate someone who loves John that much?
“What?!”
Frantically, he runs his hands through his hair and starts pacing the flat back and forth. Has the only constancy in his life, the one thing he was sure would never happen to him, finally come to pass? Did he really do something as ludicrous and predictable and ordinary as fall in love with his person, his
Up in the room, Sherlock seems puzzled. “You’ve already started?”
“When are we leaving?”
“Yes, that’s my name,” John responds. His voice is firmer now and he can already lift his head a bit. “So, what happened, Doctor? Why am I here?”
When John looks down at his hands again Sherlock realises what he’s just said. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean that –”
“So this is our flat?” John asks.
“I guess I should be go–“
“Morning,” Sherlock murmured.
Sherlock doesn’t even recall getting back to the hotel. He finds himself in a large chair next to a fireplace, with a shaking whiskey glass in hand. John is uttering words, but he fails to understand their meaning.
“I’m your… best…” He finally got it!
Is he talking to me? How does he know about that? “Sorry?”
“You don’t have to look out for me. I can handle a bit of flirting, John,” Sherlock interrupts his thought process.
Sherlock’s stare is intense, and all of a sudden it’s too much for John.
“You thought the drug was in the sugar,” John explains, crossing his arms. “You were convinced it was.”
“Ah Molly, coffee, thank you!” The lad says while handing me back my phone. He asks her something about her lipstick, which seems quite rude, but she doesn’t seem to mind. Maybe they are friends.
Back at the flat, Sherlock brings Rosie up for a nap. When he returns to the living room, I hand him a mug and we sit down in our chairs again. It’s almost like our little Sunday afternoon routine. I’d usually grab a book now or watch crap telly with Sherlock. Now, however, I crease my brows and examine my best friend’s expression. It seems neutral, like usual.
“Now you have to dance with Papa,” she said.
“Cleared off before we got here. Unfortunately, we’ve got nothing to go on.”
“No, of course not.”
We start working in silence, setting up the crib together. I can hear the distant sound of the TV from downstairs. The girl at the store told me that this crib was easy to install. Well, damn her. I curse silently as I try to figure out the instructions. Suddenly, Sherlock steals it from me and studies it deeply.
“Yeah?” I whisper in response.
He got up with one swift motion and headed towards the kitchen. The blue dressing gown fluttered around him like a cape.
“You’ve no idea,” Mike agrees. The guy looks up at us for a second before returning to his work. His eyes are green (or perhaps blue?).
With that, John turns around and heads to their bedroom. Sherlock stays on the sofa, frozen in place; frozen in this horrible moment of time that he and John will both never forget.
“I’d say he must have died about three hours ago. That’s strange. I somehow thought he might have something to do with the kidnap,” John says.
. He prays for the alcohol to have wrapped John into a state of oblivion.
“Observant?” John asks.
“As a matter of fact, John, we do,” Sherlock says, still avoiding to look at me. “We’re going out for dinner.”
“That’s okay – coffee is great,” John replies with his deep, post-alcoholic voice. Sherlock watches him lightly blow onto the liquid before taking a sip.
“What?”
bother him. He’s just not sure why. He has Mary, for god’s sake, and Sherlock has never shown any sign of bothering or complaint about her.
“No, it’s fine, John. I’m sorry, I was just about to come pick you up,” Mike replies. He turns towards the stranger, not making amends to introduce him to Sherlock.
“Really?”
, I immediately got back to tell you! I would never have had an affair whilst we were still sharing a bed!”
John isn’t convinced, but he can’t think of anything better at the moment. Sherlock’s closet reveals a number of colour-coordinated shirts, and John picks out the purple one Sherlock once wore. He throws it over to the bed, but Sherlock gives him a questioning look.
“Wh- what? Why? Why did you never say anything?” It’s the first question that comes to my mind.
He practically jumps forward, only managing to murmur a quiet “Sherl– “ before enveloping him in a tight hug. Once he touches Sherlock and realises that the man in his arms is not an illusion, he gets even closer, taking in the distinct scent he’s been trying so hard to prevail. Sherlock’s muscles seem to respond automatically, as he leans forward and closes his arms around John. Sherlock’s body feels alarmingly slim. John feels the burning anticipation of tears but he doesn’t care. All that matters is that Sherlock has come home.
John helps Sherlock into a seating position in order to pad him on his back. They’re very close on the small tank and John can see water drops falling from Sherlock’s curls. For a moment he’s mesmerised by it and blends out his surroundings completely. He doesn’t hear the rushing of the water anymore, the cries of the killer or Sherlock’s heavy breathing. He doesn’t care that he’s mad at Sherlock, or that he’s lying bare-chested in a freezing warehouse. All he can do is fight the urge to lean forward and touch those dark, wet curls.
They’re standing in the living room of 221B and Sherlock can’t help but feel slightly embarrassed by the messiness of their home. There are piles of magazines everywhere, a microscope and plenty of Petri dishes on the kitchen counter and books on the coffee table. In short, the room looks just like it always does after a long case. Mrs. Hudson greeted them downstairs, thankfully already being informed about John’s amnesia. Temporary amnesia. She introduced herself to John and they shook hands, which was more than awkward for Sherlock to watch. Now that they’re left alone in their home, Sherlock will have to do some explaining. John enters the flat and instinctively sits down in his chair. Sherlock takes it as a good sign. He settles in his own and slightly bends forward. Where does he even start?
The other option that I sometimes allow myself to think of is also quite unlikely. I could – hypothetically speaking – move into Sherlock’s room and leave my room as the nursery. Of course that’s never gonna happen, so I better spare myself the time of thinking about sharing a bed with Sherlock too much.
He wondered whether Sherlock was awake but there was no sound coming from his bedroom. John took his time preparing everything and only when the scrambled eggs were almost done did he hear someone’s footsteps on the stairs.
John pauses. Does he want to tell Sherlock how they fought because of him? How Mary freaked out when John mentioned something Sherlock said during dinner? How she tried to force him to break off their contact? How he told his wife that he doesn’t want to stop spending time with his person?
“I’m afraid not, Mrs. H., but don’t mind me. Aren’t you off to your sister’s?”
Mike suggests to introduce me to said person right away, a guy who apparently works at Bart’s, too. It’s not a far walk from the park. Mike needs to go back after his lunch break, anyway. Being back at the hospital feels strange. This is a place I used to spend most of my time, I used to have friends here, colleagues, and I even met a couple of my girlfriends here. Being here now makes me feel out of place. I don’t belong here, not anymore. We go through the large corridors of the building until we reach the lab area. Mike holds the door open for me as we enter one of the labs. The room is empty except for a tall man who stands at one of the tables extracting a liquid from a pipette into a petri dish. He has dark curly hair and a very tall and slim figure. He’s probably about my age, maybe a bit younger, his skin is quite pale and he’s wearing a suit (in a lab), which makes him look a bit posh. He seems focused on his task.
“But why not? I want to see it! Just once, please.” She looked up at Sherlock with pleading eyes, knowing very well that her Papa was unable to resist her charm. John was almost proud of her.
“You really are married!” Rosie squealed and rushed into John’s arms, causing him to part from Sherlock. John held her tightly and stopped caring that both his clothes and the carpet were covered in wall paint.
Trust the lady to deduce emotions better than anyone.
Two days ago, however, John got a call from a number that made his heart perform a tiny jump. Sherlock told him about Henry Knight and his post-traumatic monster and asked him to join the investigation. John agreed immediately. He feared that convincing Mary wouldn’t be an easy task, but for some reason she didn’t seem all too interested in his weekend plans. Lately she’s been spending more of her evenings with friends from the gym, leaving John home alone or going out for a pint with Greg or Mike. God, he doesn’t even remember the last time he had sex.
“How would you feel if we kept the rings on for a little longer?” he asked.
John pushes back into his chair – he hasn’t even realised leaning forward – and quickly stands up.
“What do you think?”
“Go, John. Go now.”
“Sorry, Mike. I was just... I know someone who lives in that building over there. I think I should better check out if they’re okay.” John doesn’t know why the lie came so easy from his lips.
“Oh, so you’re unattached? That’s good.”
“I’m sorry for leaving you. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done,” Sherlock continues.
Sherlock doesn’t reply, his face as unreadable as ever.
John feels it safe to look, and finds Sherlock fully dressed, to his relief. He walks over to the chair and unwinds the blue scarf from its back, before handing it to Sherlock and going into the kitchen. He finds Sherlock’s tea and even a canny soup that’s non-perishable, and prepares both before returning to the bedroom.
“I know... I’m sorry. Are you busy?”
“Let’s do that after Christmas, shall we? I just want to enjoy the holidays with you first.”
Sherlock continues with a monologue about this guy that apparently saved three hospitals from closure and ran a couple of children’s homes in north England. When I can’t take it anymore, I interrupt him. “For my wedding! For me. I need a best man.” I say. Is he trying to mock me?
They arrive at Sumatra Road fifteen minutes later. Sherlock jogs down the stairs to the station, trying to shift his attention back to the case. What used to be an unspoken law – that a case provides distraction from even his worst addictions – no longer applies. Instead, he found himself thinking about his fight with John during the whole ride over.
“No,” John interrupts him. “I’d rather you not lie to me anymore, Sherlock. We both know it’s true. You know I’d love to get my memories back, but I can’t do anything about it. This whole situation is a fucking mess!”
John seems to just have woken up as well. He stretches his arms and blinks at Sherlock sleepily with a bare chest and a blanket wrapped around his torso, certainly being the most interesting person Sherlock has ever laid eyes on. The sight causes a knot to form in Sherlock’s chest.
“Yeah, I’m not the John Watson,” I reply, probably a bit too snippy. I clench my hand into a fist. I may not know much about my future, but I do know about my past. The war has changed me. I’m not the ‘bright young’ man I used to be. That’s what I know for sure.
“This is amazing, John. We need to see Dr. Molder and ask about the consequences for your recovery immediately.”
With this realisation John let their lips part.
“He’s the bravest and kindest and wisest human being I’ve ever been fortunate enough to meet. He’s the best man I’ve ever known,” he concludes.
“We need to go to Mr. Saltire’s house. I’ll explain everything there. Then we can drive back home.”
“And what can I wish for?”
“Are you – sick?”
“I wouldn’t say close.”
“Thank you,” Sherlock replies.
“John, you don’t have to go back outside.”
“Alright, okay I get it!” I interrupt him. “So what’s the iodine for?” I ask, deliberately trying to change the subject.
know you. And I wouldn’t change it for the world.”
“Yeah, I think not taking a nap yesterday in order to learn the Greek alphabet might’ve been a bad idea.”
Greg gives me an expectant look, as if I could explain Sherlock’s behaviour to him. All I can do is shrug with my shoulders.
“No, it’s actually a gift from Sherlock.”
Sherlock takes a deep breath to shoot out his deduction: “Do you see that in the gravel, right here? These are traces of green paint, in two specific patches, about a metre apart. So, a ladder, obviously. There are no windows in the wall so it’s an unusual place to put a ladder. And if you were to put a ladder here, you’d put it in the flower bed, not on the path. Conclusion: The ladder was brought to the house and placed here on purpose. Since Jack’s wife is superstitious, balance of probability tells us that she shares common interests with her husband and that, therefore, he was superstitious, as well. Keith probably knew about his brother’s superstition and arranged for a friend to put a green ladder here once Jack was out of the house for his friend’s stag night. So, Jack drinks a bit too much, returns home in the dark, doesn’t want to walk under the ladder so walks around it, straight into the pond where he drowns. If Keith Downing has a green ladder, he’s the murderer.”
“Fine. Are you hungry?”
When Sherlock has finished the open discussion with himself, it’s close to midnight. John proposes they go out to watch the fireworks, so they wrap themselves up in their coats and leave the flat. Outside, the streets are already crowded with people.
before entering.
“Yes, of course. Isn’t he the one you went out to dinner with the other night?”
“Not with this case.”
“Yes, anyway... I wanted to ask whether you still need that slide of my presentation from last week? You said you needed if for your work, so I put it on a flash drive.” He places a metal-grey flash drive onto the lab table, smiling quickly before turning away.
“I had to, it was an experiment.”
Dr Molder leaves to give John some privacy and Sherlock offers his hand to help John get up. John takes it and slowly moves towards the pile of clothes in the corner of the room. He looks at the clothes, then at Sherlock, then at the clothes again.
It’s harder than I thought. Even though I leave Rosie for a couple of hours four times a week, I can’t help but think that this is different. I should take her with me to Baker Street, it’s where we belong. I kiss her again and explain everything to Molly.
John opens the door and heads out into the dark night, unable to see the smile briefly appearing on Sherlock’s face.
“Was today our first date?”
This time it’s Sherlock who laughs out loud. “You don’t really expect me to own anything close to a jumper, do you?”
“Oh for god’s sake – “
Sherlock decides she doesn’t deserve the rude answer he’s given to many of the other incompetent doctors and nurses, and replies: “Thank you for the concern, Nancy, but I’d rather not leave my husband alone, which I’m sure you understand. Besides, I’ve slept less and had even less food before, so please stop worrying about me.”
“Oh, everything’s fine. No news here either.”
“Look, Sherlock, about yesterday – “ he started.
John closes the living room door and uses the short pause to gather up his courage. “Sherlock? You do know we have all the time in the world, right?”
“I’m sorry, Dr. Watson, but my brother’s instructions were very clear. He doesn’t want either of us to contact him. I was informed, however, that he left you a
“I’d say the police don’t consult amateurs, but I saw what you were able to do yesterday...”
“I just wanted to thank you, for being so supportive and understanding of my – of our situation. The way you take care of me is more than I could ever ask for. I hope you know that I don’t take this for granted.” He shifts his position even closer to Sherlock.
about the woman again. I spare myself the time of asking how a make-up brush is gonna help him with that, get up from my chair and up to my room to get dressed. Before leaving the flat I check on Sherlock again, who is lying still on the sofa and apparently lost in his thoughts. I turn around to leave, almost not hearing the quiet “Thank you, John” Sherlock whispers. I clear my throat and head out.
The cold water hits him like stone, numbing his body within seconds. Luckily it’s not salt water, but his wound hurts nonetheless. Sherlock tries to keep his head above water with his hands and feet still tied together, which already costs him more energy than he has left. He swallows a large gulp of water whilst cursing before he manages to keep up.
John sunk deeper into his chair before muttering. “Maybe we should grant it to her.”
After work, I leave for the tube. Usually I take the 4 that takes me straight to my flat or I exit one station earlier and go grocery shopping. Today, however, I planned on doing something else, I remind myself. I want to visit Mrs. Hudson. Reluctantly, I go into the opposite direction at the station and exit the tube at Baker Street.
“I simply don’t think you need it,” Sherlock says with a quick glance down John's body. He needs to focus! Why are there cow traces everywhere?!
Rosie starts crying almost reproachfully, and I return my attention to her.
“We don’t have any at home, darling.”
“What’s that?”
“I didn’t run –“
On my way back to the flat, I see Molly Hooper on the other side of the street. For a second, I think of ignoring her, but then a feeling of guilt crawls up inside me and I wink over at her. She sees me, smiles and crosses the street.
John shakes his head and starts laughing. “Never mind,” he chuckles.
“You obviously told her that we’re friends,” Sherlock finally said. “And that you and I love her no matter the nature of our relationship.”
“What? And you’re only telling me this now? We need to find her and see if she’s okay!” I say with a significant amount of anger in my voice. We need to get to Mrs. Hudson as quickly as possible. I look around to see where we’re actually at. This place looks a lot like one of the labs at Bart’s, only that there are tables and chairs everywhere and a waiter has just placed two plates loaded with food next to a microscope.
“So we can’t switch the bomb off? And the bomb disposal will be here too late?”
“We shouldn’t bother, John, the hound has probably already killed her,” he pants, trying to keep up with me.
“Until his body decides that he’s had enough rest and wakes up on his own,” Sherlock interrupts, repeating the words he has heard so many times by now. “He’s in a vegetative state caused by a traumatic brain injury. If he stays in this condition for four weeks, it’s going to be a persistent vegetative state, which would minimise the chances of his recovery significantly. Believe me, my husband’s a doctor and I’ve heard this all before.”
way.” John feels heat crawling onto his face. Why are they even having this conversation?
of some sort,” Mycroft replies.
Sherlock sat down next to him and looked at John expectantly.
The surprise and joy of seeing him are quickly replaced by concern. Scanning Sherlock from head to toe, John notices that the detective looks miserable, much like a mirror of John. He’s got dark under-eye circles and seems even thinner than the last time. John wonders whether he eats sufficiently; Sherlock already told him about his unhealthy relationship with food and ‘transport’ when they were at that restaurant in January.
“John,” Sherlock says, his voice even deeper than usual. His eyes that currently shine dark blue in the dim light of the hallway stare at me, before he adds “We should leave.”
The relief washing through John makes him exhale deeply. “It won’t, I’m sure of it.”
Mary doesn’t reply.
He has to react quickly. What is the best excuse, what can he say? He tries to think but his brilliant mind has apparently decided to leave him in this very moment.
“Is that so? You know I’m quicker than most people.”
“Thank you Dr. Watson. I’ll see you on Monday?”
Back at home, I explain to Mary what has happened and why I missed out on dinner. When I get to the part of Sherlock’s reaction to my request, she starts to giggle. She doesn’t seem to be mad at me for staying away for so long. We also talk about the case and I notice her rising interest in it. It feels nice to go over the details with someone who doesn’t have the slightest idea, either, for a change. When we go to bed, it’s already past midnight. I lay down next to my fiancé and close my eyes. It’s really been a quite successful day. I asked Sherlock to be my best man and we worked on a new case. I finally sensed the feeling again that Sherlock was talking about the night he returned. Even though I would never admit it to him, the thrill of the chase feels bloody good. I place one hand underneath my cheek and can’t stop myself from smiling. It really has been the best 29th of January in a long time.
“Will you see Sherlock today?” She asks after taking a sip of the coffee.
Before I climb up the stairs to my room, I hear Sherlock approaching behind me.
“I’m teaching there. Yeah, bright young things like we used to be. God, I hate them,” he replies. I have to laugh at that. I can’t really imagine Mike being a teacher kind of person, but I think he secretly enjoys it. He’s always been more of a down-to-earth type of guy.
I watch Rosie in Sherlock’s arms and have to smile. For a moment, I allow myself to lean closer towards Sherlock and stroke Rosie’s head. Her blonde curls have grown quite a bit lately, which somehow makes her hair look like a mixture of Mary’s and Sherlock’s. Suddenly, I feel a squeeze on my hand and look up. Sherlock is staring at me with a curious expression. When his blue eyes find mine, I can see the brown dot in his left eye and it feels like my heart skips a beat. He’s so close that our noses could almost be touching. I risk a look down at his heart-shaped lips and immediately stare back into his eyes. I can even feel his breath on my face and it sends a shiver down my spine.
“You’ve already had your time off, otherwise you wouldn’t have called, brother dear.”
“Daddy!” Rosie squeaked and turned around in her chair.
“Yes, okay.” John seems insecure. He doesn’t know where to go, so Sherlock reaches for his hand, as usual, and is surprised to feel John’s hand stiffen.
The sadness in his voice is almost killing John. But how could he know?
Greg doesn’t seem to notice my confusion in his rage. “Tomorrow is Sunday!” When neither Sherlock nor I respond, he adds through gritted teeth “Well, I hope it’s worth it then. I’ll call you tomorrow.” With that, he turns around and leaves. I shout a goodbye after him, which he probably doesn’t hear.
Sherlock knows what he has to do, but he hesitates. Just for a moment, he allows himself to store this image of John in his mind palace. It might be the last image of him wearing the wedding band with Sherlock’s initials. The last moment of John being his husband.
“It was. And it helped me solve the case.”
“Rosie, Sherlock, thank god! I’ve been looking for you two!” John said as the adrenaline started to vanish.
“Er, no.”
When I started going back to work after moving in, Sherlock insisted on taking care of Rosie. He said it was unnecessary for me to hire someone to watch her if he could do it just as well. He was right of course, but I didn’t want to steal all his free-time and occupy him with a toddler. Sherlock, however, surprised me by telling me that he wanted to take care of her and that he liked spending time with little Watson. He still calls her Watson, sometimes, although I don’t think she likes it. Rosie refuses to call Sherlock by his name, she only ever utters an incomprehensible combination of vowels at him. I think it’s because Sherlock is still too difficult to pronounce, Sherlock thinks it’s because she secretly doesn’t like him. If he knew how wrong he is. Rosie adores him, probably even more than I do. It’s ridiculous.
They are stopped in front of the entrance by a man with a ferret-looking face in a coverall.
This whole topic is frustrating. Usually, Sherlock gives more information than anyone wants to hear during his deductions, but with this particular topic he’s always shut himself down. Irene Adler is beautiful, she’s intelligent and intriguing. If Sherlock doesn’t want to make a move there can only be so many possible explanations. Maybe it’s because she’s a woman.
Sherlock stops. John looks intimidated and Sherlock already half expects him to run to his coat and storm off, if he’s anything like the John from ten years ago. Instead, John reaches for Sherlock’s shoulder and squeezes it with his hand, then rests it there and smiles.
John had somehow forgotten about that. He opened the book and started reading.
“You bastard!” the man shouts while waves of blood flood out of his upper leg.
John felt heat rising to his cheeks, but not in the good way. Why was Sherlock being such an ass? John had known that Sherlock regretted the kiss as soon as John had broken off and seen the expression of horror on Sherlock’s face. But with everything they’d been through, didn’t John deserve at least some sort of explanation? Had he truly been misreading everything these past couple of weeks because of wish-thinking?
It has become a routine of theirs, reading the newspaper during breakfast. For lunch, they’re both at work most of the time, and during dinner they usually watch whatever’s on the telly. Mary looks up from the local news with a raised eyebrow.
“But –“
“John, please,” Sherlock grunts. “I want –“
during his deductions, but whenever he turns around only the same boring faces stare at him with doubt in their eyes. It seems like the one thing that used to be the sole focus of his attention, the only purpose in his life, isn’t enough anymore. And it’s driving him insane.
Upon entering the living room of 221B, he threw his work bag into a corner and fell into his chair. He pressed his hands to his eyes to reduce the growing headache and took three deep breaths. It took him surprisingly long to notice the absence of Sherlock and Rosie, who were usually playing hide and seek or Monopoly at this time of day.
“Sherlock, is that...?”
Suddenly he realises that John expects him to answer, so he quickly looks in the opposite direction while replying: “I don’t think you do.”
“Sherlock?”
When John’s eyes found his, he added: “I would do anything for her.”
“Problem?” I can’t help but smile. There’s something strangely charming about him. He does seem like the perfect flatmate for me, he doesn’t ask too many questions and he doesn’t even mind that we don’t know each other, at all. Still, I have to at least know the address and his name.
“My landlady Mrs. Hudson would love to meet you. She’s been annoying me with questions and I would very much like her to stop. That is, if you don’t mind.”
Sherlock lets out a cry before opening his eyes. John stares at him in disbelief, no words needed to understand Sherlock’s failure.
It’s like entering a different world; there are stacks of magazines on the coffee table, Petri dishes in the sink, notebooks all over the floor and a skull on the mantelpiece. The wallpaper has an old-fashioned black and white print on one side and a reddish-brown print on the other. When Sherlock offers him tea and opens the fridge in order to get milk John catches sight of a box of – according to his anatomical knowledge – human thumbs lying right next to a can of soup.
My thoughts swirl around for another couple of minutes, until I finally decide that I won’t find any more sleep. I get up and check on Rosie, who’s still fast asleep. I smile and make sure the baby monitor is turned on before leaving the room to go downstairs.
“You know that’s not true. And there’s no need to shout, John.”
“Because no one ever has,” Sherlock admits.
“Fine,” John said, and Rosie rewarded him with a smile.
“So, the big question.” I start. This is a hint he is going to get.
His face is now even closer, so close that John can see the tiny brown spot in Sherlock’s right eye. He doesn’t know what to say or do; all he can focus on is Sherlock’s face, and the feeling of his hot breath against his own.
“But I don’t KNOW what we’ve been through! For me it’s like I’ve only known you for a couple of months!” John has started to yell, which only makes Sherlock more furious.
“What? What are you apologising for? Wait a second, you don’t still have that goose liver from Tuesday hidden, do you?”
“Sherlock, what is this?”
“I’ve missed something, haven’t I?”
“You – tired?”
“What time is it?”
“Clearly,” Sherlock replies and resumes his attempt at deducing her. Without the clothes and with the additional make-up, it’s harder than he ever thought it could be.
“What? Can’t a sister just call her brother without a proper reason?”
“Fine. I’ll see you later, brother mine.”
“Sherlock, what are you doing here? Is everything alright?”
“Hmwrwhm.”
“I left her at home, with Molly.”
The man takes a left turn and opens a side door leading into the warehouse. He looks left and right before entering the building, not closing the door completely. Sherlock follows him without a second thought. If his calculations are correct, he should find Miller torturing yet another female victim inside the building.
“Sherlock’s not a girl’s name!”
He helped Sherlock up into a seating position and felt the sticky orange mess transform onto his own hands. They were now on equal height, Rosie still lying on the floor next to them. She looked at them expectantly so John mustered up all the courage he had left and leaned closer to Sherlock.
John could tell from Sherlock’s expression that he agreed with Rosie on the matter.
“Hey, Sherlock. Sergeant Donavan’s just been explaining everything to me. Two pills, how dreadful.”
“Yeah, well. That was how I first met him. He’s really not at all how he’s described in the papers. He’s –“ John’s thoughts wander to Sherlock for a moment and he feels his face turning into a grin – “Brilliant.”
“I need REAL nasal spray.”
“I don’t think I can go to work today,” Mary says in a nasal voice. She coughs for emphasis.
“That’s… I don’t know what to say. This is a family unicum! You should keep it, it should stay in your family.” I clear my throat. This is truly a thoughtful gift. And it is for Mary’s and my child. I’m not sure we deserve it. Bloody hell, I know we don’t.
“Thank you. You were very observant.”
The rest of the week passed by rather unspectacularly. Rosie was happy to spend more time with her two Dads, who were both trying to avoid each other whilst doing so. In conclusion, John felt miserable.
“Yes. I’m so sorry, John.”
Sherlock quickly types away a message into the phone while simultaneously deducing the man in front of him. The words fly across Dr. Watson’s body and Sherlock reads them with practiced ease.
At home, Sherlock declares that it’s still too early to go to bed. He sits down in his chair and John, as usual, follows him. Whiskey glasses in hand, they share a comfortable silence and John wonders, not for the first time, if the girl had a point earlier.
“I work at a clinic near Hyde park. The job is good, yeah, very good. I mean it’s not like chasing criminals across London, but it pays the rent.”
Sherlock is already halfway around the corner when John catches up. “Wait! I’ll just have to make a quick call... someone’s expecting me.”
“You locked me in that bloody lab!”
“But I haven’t finished…”
“I honestly don’t even remember how I ended up here, Sherlock.” John replies pointing at the couch.
“What was that? I don’t think I’ve heard this before.”
“It’s alright, honey. Sherlock?”
He mustered up all the courage he could find and sat down on the kitchen table. If they were going to talk about it, now would be the best time, with Rosie still asleep.
Sherlock smiles at him, and John knows that he’ll never get enough of it.
From this angle, he can see every shadow on John’s face. His eyes are closed but Sherlock knows their distinguishing colour of grey-blue by heart. He hovers over John, staring at his silvery hair, his grey stubble and the creases on John’s forehead, thinking about that distinct smile of John’s that makes Sherlock feel like he’s the only person in the world, when all of a sudden he just knows. It feels like being hit by a stone wall; it feels like falling off the edge of a cliff.
“This is the friend I just mentioned, Dr. John Watson. John, this is Sherlock Holmes, a colleague of mine.”
“I hope she understood. It’s hard enough for her without Mary and with two fathers, instead. Do you think the other kids will make fun of her when they’re older?”
“There’s more in the cab,” I say, panting and placing the bag onto the floor. I return with the second and third bag full of supplies and heap them into the living room, as well. Mary seems amused and frightened at the same time.
He clears his throat. A woman sitting across from him gives him a gorgeous smile. She raises an eyebrow expectantly, probably trying to flirt with John, so he politely returns the smile before looking away. His divorce has gone through a couple of months ago, in May, feeling even more rushed than his marriage, but he’s certainly not looking for a new partner. He knows that he’ll never be as happy as he was with Sherlock, and he has no desire to be with anyone else.
Back at the flat, Mrs. Hudson greets them by the door and Sherlock decides to stay with her for tea. John kindly declines, saying that he’s a bit tired and intends to lay down for a while. When John has trotted up the seventeen steps to 221B, Mrs. Hudson and Sherlock sit down in her kitchen and talk about John’s state. She’s just as worried as Sherlock that John might not regain his memory. It’s something Sherlock avoids thinking about, because how could he imagine a life with John only as his friend, now that he knows what it’s like with John as his husband? They chatter through three cups of tea until Sherlock decides to go back up and look after John.
The clinic is bursting with patients today, mainly the flu and occasionally a more serious influenza.  I barely have time for a lunch break. After just finishing a bagel between two patients I receive a text.
After a while, John realises that they’ve been staring at each other for longer than strictly necessary, so he retrieves his hand and pushes his chair back into its initial position.
This cannot be true; the gardener cannot have killed Mr. Scott. It shouldn’t be possible, at least not according to his deductions. Lestrade is mad at him, but that doesn’t bother Sherlock. Sergeant Donovan made fun of him for having lost his ‘creepy superpower’, but that doesn’t bother him either. What does bother him is the fear residing inside him that she might be right. It wasn’t the first time this week that he led the whole of Scotland Yard on a wrong track.
It had been a warm summer evening in late August when Sherlock got bored and decided to phone Lestrade in search of a case. John was still at the surgery and the day without him had been dreadful and a complete waste so far. Since Greg didn’t have anything interesting, he told Sherlock about a series of burglaries going on in the south of London. He said he needed someone to observe the houses that were most likely to be in the burglar’s pattern this evening. Sherlock didn’t have anything better to do, so he accepted and went straight to Lestrade to pick up the car. Greg greeted him and threw the car keys at Sherlock with an eyebrow raise, and Sherlock offered him to come along. He had already texted John the exact spot where he wanted to spend the night observing and waiting for the burglars, so that he could join him after his shift. Greg declined the offer politely, murmuring that he didn’t intend to spend the night next to a snogging couple. That was alright with Sherlock, who had made similar plans already. He took Lestrade’s car and drove directly to the parking lot of a small supermarket near the predicted crime scene. He had a good view of the three houses most likely to be broken into from where he was. After a long hour, John finally arrived from the tube and joined him in the passenger’s seat. He gave Sherlock a brief kiss and told him all about his day at the clinic. It was already pitch black outside when he finished his story about the boy who had had a hiccup since last Wednesday. Sherlock was more than glad to have John with him and so they spent the next couple of hours in the car passing the time. When John caressed his curly hair and stroked the back of his neck unconsciously, like he had done so many times, Sherlock figured that the day might not have been such a waste after all. He was just observing his husband (almost forgetting about the potential burglary) with a content smile when it happened. He felt the bang of the car crashing into them from behind before he saw it. For a terribly long moment, he could see it all in slow motion – John’s eyes widening, the impact causing his body to slam forward and break right through the windshield, while Sherlock, who had his seatbelt still fastened from the drive, stayed in his seat. He heard the sound of glass cracking and then the sound of a body landing hard on the bonnet.
“What brings you here three hours before the New Year starts? I thought you and Mary were celebrating with friends.” He emphasises the last word as if it were an insult.
I ignore his comment. “So what do we do now?”
“Just play along, I’ll fill you in later.”
“Can I ask you one thing, John? You can say no if you don’t want to.”
“How could I have forgotten? We’ve got a case, John. The game is on!” he exclaims while storming out of the kitchen and into his bedroom. He returns a couple of minutes later, fully dressed in a black suit.
“I love you, John.”
“Then why did you run away again?”
“Merry Christmas. To both of you,” Sherlock adds with a look over John’s shoulder. There’s a smile on Mary’s face that doesn’t quite reach her eyes.
“Two.”
“Really? Then I’ll get you some, later.” John looks around the room. “Do you need anything else?”
“For god’s sake!” He yells, after apparently not seeing the anticipated result.
“But it’s so hot,” Sherlock complains.
“Hello, Mr. Holmes. I’ve been waiting for you.”
Sherlock raises an eyebrow in response. “Okay.”
“Of course, dear. The little girl and I have a lot of catching up to do, anyway.”
“I’ll go to bed right after. Would you switch off the lights once you go upstairs?” Sherlock asked, pulling John from his thoughts.
“I just… what you said reminded me of something you… didn’t say.” He finally looks up from his tea and smiles. Something in his look tells me to let it drop.
They decide to walk home. The sky is clear and they can see the stars. Is it really that late already, John wonders. He seems to forget the time when he’s with his flatmate.
When the food is ready, I set up the kitchen table and place everything onto it. I heat up some leftover Thai food from yesterday for Sherlock and me. We sit down to eat and Rosie tells us about the games she played with Nanny. I feed her in her highchair and keep exchanging looks with Sherlock. We definitely need to talk later. When Rosie refuses to eat and throws her spoon over at Sherlock, who catches it but ends up with sprinkles of mash in his face nevertheless, I don’t think I’ve ever been happier.
“Sherlock, do you remember when I asked you to spend time with John because it made him feel better?”
“So, I guess that’s it, then.”
Oh for heaven’s sake. “No, Mike’s great, but he’s not my best friend.” Who would’ve thought that Sherlock could be so slow? He gives me a long look, probably trying to invent some other friend for me. I should definitely enlighten him before he suggests Mycroft.
“Hey, Mary.”
When Sherlock returned with two steaming mugs, he handed one to John and sat down again, leaning forward in his chair. His eyes were fixed on John, and John suddenly remembered why he both loathed and loved to be the sole focus of Sherlock’s attention.
“I then proceeded to play the melody you just heard,” Sherlock adds. He doesn’t say that John vowed to never forget that they have a once in a lifetime love, and promised that no matter what challenges might carry them apart, they’d always find a way back to each other.
“I’m assuming it’s my brother you’re talking about?”
. The picturesque cottage and the sand stone walls remind John of his home, where he spent his childhood with his father and Harry. It’s not a particularly fond memory, but he quickly dismisses the thought. He hasn’t even told Mary what he went through in his infancy, and he doesn’t think he’ll ever entrust anyone with the knowledge – except for maybe the posh git with the perfect parents next to him.
When Sherlock examines me I can see the worry clear on his face. Is he worried I can’t take this? That it reminds me of everything I’ve lost? Well, he’s right, to be fair, but I need to get myself together. This is our first proper case in ages and I want to get it right.
“I’m sorry, Sherlock, I can’t do this...” John turns towards the door, trying to ignore the feeling in his gut that wants him to stay. He opens the door with a shaking hand, and leaves.
“Amazing!” I finish for him. “Now come back up here.”
I wake up from a weird dream that I forget immediately. I sit up in bed and automatically look over at Rosie’s crib. She seems to still be asleep. I lay back down and stare at the ceiling of 221B. It felt natural to move back in after everything that happened with Sherlock’s sister. I spent most of my time at Baker Street, anyway, and kept going back and forth between my flat, the clinic and this flat. Rosie babbles in her sleep and I notice it with a heavy heart. She’s going to be two years old in May, which is still a semi-appropriate age for a parent and a child to share a room. At the age of four and five and thirteen, however, it’s not going to be. I keep wondering what I’m going to do about it. Maybe I can sleep on the couch, at first, and when Rosie’s old enough she can move to 221C. I can already feel the back pain thinking about sleeping on the couch for the next 16 years. It’s not really an option.
“I got is as a gift from a client and never had any use for it.”
“It does not, John. If anything, you staying shows that you are the complete opposite of horrible. I’m so incredibly sorry that you had to go through this.”
He leans down closer to the bomb and starts patting around the device, searching for it. When he finally feels the tiny stick attached to the side of the bomb with his fingers, he lets out a deep breath before clicking it.
“I’m afraid I don’t have anything for breakfast.”
A couple of minutes later, John emerges from the bathroom, his hair still wet from the shower. He’s wearing his old shirt and trousers again and leans back onto the kitchen counter, rubbing a towel through his hair. Sherlock has never imagined kissing John before a few days ago, and he hasn’t stopped imagining it since.
I briefly wonder since when Sherlock cares about such things, but decide to let the topic rest. This case was probably one of the quickest he has ever solved. My help clearly wasn’t necessary, but it feels nice to be included nonetheless. I shift in my chair and watch Sherlock. There’s one thing I’ve been meaning to ask him, preferably before my daughter arrives. I clear my throat and brace myself. It’s gonna get awkward, but I have to know.
“What was that?”
“We really have been through a lot, haven’t we?  Do you realise that we met exactly seven years ago today? I can’t believe how much has happened since then. You completely turned my life around, Sherlock Holmes,” I say with a slight giggle to hide the profoundness of my words.
“Please, John, your answer is practically written across your face,” Sherlock replied with a snarl.
“Yes, John?”
Fifteen minutes later, the cab pulls over in front of a shabby sky scraper. Sherlock hurries out of the car so I roll my eyes and pay the cabbie. The man, Mr. Simon, lets us into the house and tells us that his apartment is on the thirteenth floor. He waits at the door and gives us a short nod and handshake.
“I can’t go myself as I am currently busy thinking,” I hear Sherlock say from the living room. I roll my eyes in response and forego answering verbally. Instead, I make two cups of Earl Grey, add milk to both and sugar to one cup, and return. I place one mug on the coffee table next to the sofa and sit down on my desk to drink from my own. Sherlock still hasn’t moved, but he has his fingers tucked underneath his chin, a pose which I secretly call the ‘thinking-Sherlock’ pose. Maybe I shouldn’t be too harsh with him at the moment, considering what had happened lately. I observe Sherlock, who has apparently drifted off into his mind palace, and can’t help myself from thinking back to the events of New Year’s Eve. Sherlock is probably mad at Irene for lying to him. He grieved her, as far as I can tell, and now it turned out that she faked her own death. Who would do something like that? Of course she wanted my help to return her bloody phone, which is still in Sherlock’s possession. But that’s not the only reason why I keep thinking about that night. Sherlock is probably in love with her. She thought I was jealous because of my anger, but I really wasn’t. I was just worried for my friend, and a bit annoyed at the amount of text messages he had received from her before her faked death. It was 57 messages up until Christmas Eve alone, and who can focus on anything with this stupid text alert noise going off every other minute? It was annoying, that’s all. To be completely honest, I was a tiny bit relieved when Sherlock identified her body, because that meant the playing games thing was finally over, or so I thought. I regretted that thought right away, however, when I found Sherlock at home, silent, playing sad music on his violin and barely eating anything. I know he does that all the time anyway but I’m fairly sure it must have had to do with –
The next morning John woke up early and silently made his way downstairs. He wanted to let Rosie sleep for as long as possible and decided to prepare a nice Sunday breakfast for the three of them. He had managed to push aside his worries yesterday night, hoping that his sleep-deprived daughter might have forgotten her wish already.
The puzzle I am trying to solve is not only what I could have said, but also why he told me that lie. Was it because he wanted to make his death easier for me? Did he think I wouldn’t grieve him if I believed he was a liar? Did Moriarty force him to say that to me? I keep replaying our last conversation in my mind, trying to figure out his intentions. When he stood there and instructed me to stay where I was, I did, because I thought that he’d jump if I moved. But he jumped anyway. I can still hear his broken voice saying
“I was informed that we are to expect a terrorist strike… in London.”
Her expression is honest when she adds: “I only want what’s best for John.”
“God, I want to touch you here,” he whispers before licking the shaft and covering it with his mouth. He can hear Sherlock make a delicious sound of surprise, his hips coming forward involuntarily.
“John, we need to see whether the basement door is locked, or whether we could hypothetically climb through one of the windows.” Even though it’s fairly dark, I can see that he’s making puppy eyes at me. That bastard.
Sherlock extracts the flashlight Lestrade gave him earlier from his coat pocket, aiming the light towards the darkened tunnel. With a quick motion, he jumps down onto the tracks, only stopping because of John’s concerned voice.
“Of course nothing happened between us. John is... he is –“
Sherlock takes a sip from his coffee when the couple on the neighbouring table catches his attention. They seem to be fairly young spouses, probably spending their honeymoon at this hotel. Their eyes are glued at each other, and the man is holding his wife’s hand like it’s the most delicate thing in the world. A knot tightens in Sherlock’s chest at the sight. Their gestures are so intimate and so filled with love that it’s almost painful to watch; and it’s definitely something Sherlock never imagined he’d ever long for. He knows now that it’s something he’ll never have.
“Oh John, dear, how are you?” she asks upon seeing me.
Suddenly, her face is close and Sherlock blinks it into focus. Mrs. Hudson looks concerned.
I am too astonished to find an answer.
“Gavin Lestrade. He’s a man and good at it.” It slowly dawns on me that Sherlock, although the most intelligent man I’ve ever met, might be more ignorant than I thought.
When he rocks her back and forth to try and stop her from sobbing, I can’t help but think back to what Mrs. Hudson told me at the therapist’s house.
“No, actually I happen to have some in the kitchen.”
“Jesus! What just happened? Sherlock, was that...?”
“Oh… okay.” Rosie still seemed content, the briefness of John’s and Sherlock’s wish-marriage unable to reduce her excitement.
“One.”
I glance over at Sherlock who’s making an annoyed face and lean over closer to Mr. Simon. I pat his arm and try to comfort him as best as possible, but there’s really not much else I can do. I know what it feels like to lose your wife, and I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy.
They say their goodbyes in the hallway, yet halfway down the stairs Mary turns around again.
“John, I really am glad to hear that you’re doing okay. I know the one and a half years weren’t easy for you, so it’s good to know that you’re doing better,” she gives me a slight smile.
He turns his coat collar up and pushes his hands into the pockets of the Belstaff, rolling his eyes even though there’s no one around to see it.
“Mycroft? He couldn’t even deal with this if it had my birthday as a pin code.”
Once the tea is prepared, they sit down on the two armchairs facing each other. Sherlock realises that John hasn’t even seen the flat, yet. And he never will, he reminds himself.
“Would you mind watching her for a little longer? I need to talk to Sherlock.”
“I’m right here, just take two steps to the front and one step to the left and you should feel the bed.”
“Well, to be fair, you never told me when your birthday is. So while we’re at it – “
I stroke his penis more quickly and move my fingers inside of him just a bit. I can feel his prostate, so I slide my finger against it and feel the body underneath me shiver.
I want to make a forest
“But why?”
“When you wrote in your letter that you wanted me to be with the person who truly makes me happy, you didn’t realise…” He stops to take a deep breath. “You are that person, Sherlock.”
John stares into the distance, not knowing what to say. It can’t end like this, it just can’t.
Later that day, I decide to take a walk to the park. It wasn’t really a conscious decision. Sometimes the room just gets a bit too small, and I feel like the gun in the drawer stares at me. So I go out. I like to watch other people, strangers. Watch them enjoy their lives. I envy them, because they do not realise how lucky they are. However, when I actually reach the park, I always want to leave as soon as possible. I don’t like walking around with my cane. I feel like people are staring at me.
On the sixth day, they had managed to go through with their arrangement without any major incidents. Sherlock had told Mrs. Hudson on Sunday when he had gone down for tea and John had texted most of the people he thought would notice and question them in Rosie’s presence. Rosie had been as happy as ever and Sherlock and John had been fine. Apart from a couple of stares from some Mums at kindergarten, nothing had actually changed.
“Er, well, I’ve got my methods.”
“Let’s say, Mycroft’s field of work proves to be helpful sometimes.”
John, however, feels the need to correct the manager. Sherlock introduces the two of them, but Angelo continues to ignore John’s denial by bringing them a tea-light to the table. After John has finally decided on the most boring dish on the menu, he starts questioning Sherlock further.
It’s only now that Sherlock realises that they have to finish a case. The sooner they get it done, the faster he can focus on more important things.
The doctor explains most of the events to John, telling him that he’s had an accident and a major brain surgery; that he woke up after three days of a vegetative state; that he suffers from retrograde amnesia and that instead of January 2010 it’s August 2020. John’s eyes widen at the explanation and for a moment Sherlock thinks John’s about to start crying, but his face hardens instead. Ever the soldier. Dr. Molder deliberately leaves out details about John’s personal life in the last decade, and turns to look at Sherlock to do the explaining thereof. Sherlock shifts his weight from one foot to the other and starts talking. It feels more than uncomfortable to talk to John in this formal manner, being so unacceptably far away from him.
Sherlock runs his hands through his hair, tucking at the curls in frustration. He hasn’t been having the best day when Mike Stamford enters the lab at six in the evening. He unsuccessfully tried to convince Lestrade that the series of suicides threatening the dull idyll of crime-free London is, instead, a series of cold-blooded, well-planned murders. However, Scotland Yard’s incompetence has once again succeeded Sherlock’s already low expectations, leaving him sulking in his lab with a couple of unimportant experiments to pass the time, waiting for the next strike of the killer.
“It was worth a try. Now tell me, is this where you killed five women in the last four weeks, Mr. Miller?”
The expression on the other man’s face shifts to blatant anger. “Oh don’t pretend you worked that out, somebody told you that.”
A hand comes up behind his head that gently guides him down, closer to Sherlock’s face. “I felt it, too,” Sherlock says before kissing him.
Just in that moment, Sherlock recognises the look on John’s face. It’s the expression he makes when he feels slightly uncomfortable, mostly around strangers who ask him inappropriate questions. Sherlock feels like he’s going to faint and tightens his grip on the armrest.
“No, no it’s fine. Maybe we can repeat this some other time? I’ll call you,” he says while getting back into his jacket. He pulls a couple of bills from his purse and gives Mike a reassuring nod before leaving the dusty pub.
“It’s really just a small thing, not worth mentioning. You can return it if you don’t like it; I just saw it at the store the other day and couldn’t pass by.” John’s thumb is now drawing tiny circles across Sherlock’s hand, and it’s more calming and also arousing than it has any right to be.
They both take a sip of their drinks in silence. Sherlock feels the burning liquor running down his throat, and he focusses on the feeling of it.
After a not long enough eternity, Sherlock pulls away. He has to ask this now, otherwise he probably never will. They have never been good at talking about such things.
“Not yet,” John murmurs. He has almost drifted off curled in Sherlock’s arm.
He really was afraid I’d believe Moriarty. Did he really think so little of me, or did he think so little of himself?
“Your person.”
I leave for work. I only started going back to work recently, mainly because of financial issues. After the… after last June I couldn’t work, I couldn’t do anything. I only felt numbness and pain, when I allowed the memories and feelings to consume me. Everyone was so worried as to why I was behaving like that, Molly, Mrs. Hudson, and even Greg, but they just don’t understand. He was my whole world. He was my flatmate, my best friend, he gave me a reason to live in a time when I desperately needed one. Being with him healed me, but it was more than that. We were, I can see that now in retrospect, perfect for each other. We fit together like two halves of a puzzle piece. I never used to believe in something as corny as soulmates, but it is the best term to describe what he was to me. Now that he’s gone, I constantly feel like someone ripped out a part of myself that I never knew I had before I lost it. I don’t assume people to understand the relationship we shared, they often misinterpreted it and thought that he was my boyfriend. But even though he wasn’t, he was so much more. He was my partner and I would’ve spent the rest of my life with him. And now it’s too late.
John, unaware of Sherlock’s revelation and subsequent panic attack, wakes up. Sherlock quickly sits down in his armchair and steeples his hands underneath his chin, trying to appear deep in thought. He watches John putting aside the blanket with a confused look and stretching his arms.
Before I have the chance to answer, Mary announces through the two-way intercom that Mr Geller is arriving with a continuing hiccup.
Suddenly I realise that I’m still holding his hand, and release it immediately. Sherlock briefly stares at me before rushing towards the street, leaving me in the dark.
“Yes. The poor thing has exhausted herself today.”
person?
“Just, you know, because of the case. I actually asked Molly to bring her around later, if you don’t mind.”
Panic rises up in Sherlock. Up until now, everything involving The Work has always been fun for him, even the danger. He gladly accepted the fights, the broken noses and the loaded guns; he even enjoyed the threat to his life. It was the legal way of getting high without going through the trouble of having to purchase cocaine first. But that was before John. Or rather, before one of said guns was directed at John.
“You don’t need to say anything. It’s a miracle you fell in love with me the first time, I shouldn’t have expected it to happen again. But you could’ve at least talked to me before running off with the next best woman you could find.”
“Yes, sorry. Yes, Mike. Hello. Hi.” I shake his hand. He smiles at me. I don’t usually like meeting old acquaintances. They remind me of the life I used to have and never will have again.
“What about when you made that thing with peas once?”
The worst thing of all is that, even though it’s selfish and not understandable and horrible to even think about, Sherlock starts to get angry with John. He can’t even explain why – because this is all Sherlock’s fault and John is doing his best to remember – but sometimes between all the understanding and consideration he feels the tiniest bit of anger flickering inside him.
“We don’t know a thing about each other. I don’t know where we’re meeting, I don’t even know your name.”
“But I haven’t ordered…”
“John?”
The frustration is audible in his voice. I have to swallow the accusation that I went to Tesco for nothing down and instead try to think of something to cheer him up. “Why don’t we ask Greg to give us a new case? Could be fun.”
His last thought before falling asleep is Sherlock, and he will be his first thought upon waking.
“Thank you. I’ll see you in the morning then,” he says and it sounds too formal.
John laughs out loud. It’s this mixture between a giggle and a proper laugh that is unique to John Watson. Sherlock thinks it’s the most beautiful sound he’s ever heard.
It’s easier to leave those words unsaid now, because I know they wouldn’t change anything. Sherlock Holmes is dead. I’ve learned to accept that. He’s not coming back from the dead like in some of those cheesy movies. He’s just dead. Suddenly, my eyes fill with tears. That is one of the reasons why I don’t come here often. I always start to cry and it’s embarrassing. I’ve never been the emotional type. It’s not even that I think about him more when I’m here, it’s just that the finality of his death and therefore the finality of our time together hits me whenever I see his grave.
“Thanks. For letting us stay.”
John pulls apart after a while, but his hands rest on Sherlock’s shoulders. “I just want you to know that what happened to me wasn’t your fault. It was an accident. The fact that you wanted me to come along after work doesn’t change anything. Do you understand?”
“No, it’s fine. We do exchange presents, I just wasn’t expecting anything this year.”
“John, you’re staring at me.”
“Why would you say that, John? I’m an expert in everything.”
A knock on the door pulled him from his thoughts.
I was definitely not prepared for this answer! Why didn’t he ever tell me? How can I let the subject rest now?
All of a sudden, a million pieces I never understood come together in my mind. I can see the images clearly. Sherlock claiming being married to his work. Irene saying ‘Look at us both’. Sherlock playing sad music on Christmas. Mine and Sherlock’s dinner at Angelo’s on our one-year anniversary. Sherlock being jealous of my girlfriends. Sherlock calling me his conductor of light. Sherlock saving my life over and over again. Sherlock’s words before he jumped. Sherlock begging me for forgiveness. Sherlock’s expression when he realised he was my best friend. The stag night. Sherlock calling me the bravest, wisest and kindest human being. Sherlock leaving my wedding early. Sherlock shooting Magnussen to save my wife. Sherlock’s look when he said ‘Sherlock is actually a girl’s name’. Sherlock forgiving Mary for shooting him. Sherlock helping me set up Rosie’s nursery. Sherlock allowing me to hit him because he thought he deserved it. Sherlock treating Rosie like his own daughter. Sherlock pointing a gun at his own brother and not me.
“Oh,” Sherlock said and looked up from his microscope for the first time. “I suppose we will.”
“You... you think she’s still alive?” Mr. Simon seems hopeful and terrified at the same time. When Sherlock nods, I can’t help but feel envy for this man.
For a second, Sherlock seems speechless. “What do you mean…”
“I moved in after you left London. I hope you don’t – mind?”
The weather is cold and I zip my coat all the way up to prevent the cool air from tickling down my neck. I walk to the nearest Tesco, gather all the supplies and throw some milk into the shopping trolley, as well. I don’t think Sherlock bothered buying any. On my way back to Baker Street, I see a woman walk by wearing red lipstick and a dress (in January?). I can’t help but stare to make sure I didn’t just pass Irene Adler. It isn’t her. Damn that woman. Sherlock had better solve this case sooner than later and we can finally move on from her. I have to think about our conversation at Battersea again.
“Oh, I thought you take Rosie along.”
“Trust me, mate, I do. And it’s pretty urgent so…”
“We wait.”
“I don’t think we’re exactly like Lilly’s parents.”
One and a half hours later I arrive back home. Mary is crawled up on the sofa, looking miserable. When she sees me, her eyes widen.
John pinches the back of his nose and closes his eyes. It was a bloody long day; during which he was entrapped in a laboratory; found out that he had been drugged; returned to the Hollow; kept their client from killing himself; shot a dog; ran after a surprisingly fast senior murderer and watched him die during an explosion.
Sherlock increases his pace, stamping his foot on the ground with each step. He wants to get home and sulk on the couch as quickly as possible.
“Dr. Watson? Is everything okay?”
“I’m not in the mood for hide and seek tonight,” he added.
