Even though next to Sherlock, John is walking briskly, shining his torch on the branch-strewn, pot-holed tarmac, navigating them around mud and puddles, Sherlock can tell that he is nervous. Every rustle in the dark, every snap of a branch makes the torch-beam twitch and leap there, but apart from a surprised fox and what might have been a pine marten glaring at them from one of the trees, they don’t encounter any living things.
They walk at a leisurely pace, and given the fair weather, it’s surprisingly pleasant. There is little traffic on the narrow road that winds between hedgerows. About half way, just out of Halstead village (no more than a string of houses along the main road), they pass by a plum tree laden with fruit. John takes off his hat and plucks some of them into it before offering it to Sherlock, who takes some gratefully. They walk on, chewing plums and occasionally spitting out a stone. When Knockholt Pound village, their final destination, comes into view, Sherlock asks a question that has been occupying him ever since John informed him about his medical care of him on the train.
“I’m sure we’ll find out later. Excuse me for a moment.” With that, Sherlock dashes off in the direction of the privies as fast as he can manage with his dodgy leg.
“I’m looking for signs that a car stopped here. I had a strange encounter with one up at the crossroads last night on my way home. There aren’t many cars about in these parts, particularly now with the petrol rationing. Hearing about the body made me wonder whether the two instances might be connected. The time sounds about right.”
“Oh, I didn’t think you missed anything,” says Molly. “And well done with the message. You must tell me all about it later, if you can. Anyway, as for what I found ... perhaps you know that Jenny’s parents were here to claim her body and take it back to Wales with them. They also visited us and spoke to Mrs. Suffield and her husband, and had a look at Jenny’s room and the rest of the house. I think it helped them to see that Jenny had been looked after well at her billet. Some of the girls aren’t as lucky as we are. Mr. and Mrs. Wilson took some of her things. Personal ones, you see, to remember her by. But most of her belongings, her clothes and make-up and magazines, they didn’t want those, and they said that we, that is Sally and I, and her friends from ... er ... work should take our pick and donate the rest. So last night some girls came over, and those on nightshift came this morning, and we sorted through her things. At first I didn’t want to take anything. It didn’t seem proper, you know, especially when it came to personal stuff like underwear. But on the other hand ... many things are so scarce right now, and she had such nice clothes, and silk stockings, and other garments I wouldn’t have been able to afford even before the war. It would be a waste to throw them away, wouldn’t it? I didn’t take any of her knickers, mind, but—”
“So, what is going on?” he asked bluntly. “To be honest, that photo surprised me when it came. Of course I’d assumed there was something going on between the two of you almost from the start. The very fact that he seemed to tolerate and even like you, and you him, was novel. But I didn’t really expect you to ... you know.” He waved a hand vaguely, looking embarrassed.
Instead he said, “And then he faked his suicide to protect me and was gone for nine months. Afterwards, we needed some time to ... you know ... rebuild our friendship. I was furious with him for not telling me about his plans, for letting me believe he was truly dead. I mourned him, had a really rough time. And then he turns up out of the blue. I was that close to hitting him. On the other hand, during the time he was gone, I realised how much in fact I’d lost. More than a friend, even my best friend.”
When Sherlock had shifted his weight according to the instruction, a change had come over the horse. It’s body seemed to stretch and elongate, and the long leaps of the gallop melted into one smooth constant movement. John understood now why this was called ‘flying pace’. The horse seemed to fly indeed, its legs barely touching the ground as they beat out a quick staccato, the speed accentuated by the flying mane and tail while the rider sat quite still, upright and majestic, like a monarch on a fast moving throne. John thought that this was the perfect gait for Sherlock to ride at because it resembled his character: difficult, quite singular,  with his tight control and composure on the one hand and his moments of thought and stillness, while his mind ran a mile a minute like Fenja's legs on the other. It was quite a sight to     behold, and John felt his heart leap at it.
by Giovanni Gabrieli. I used to play second violin at the school orchestra during my first year at Harrow, and this and the Banchieri piece were parts of the repertoire.”
“Yes, I get that, but again, what are they hoping to find here?” A thought struck John. “You don’t think they’re some of those UFO-fanatics looking for parts of an alien spacecraft, do you? You know, folks trying to prove that something did crash-land here over thirty years ago.”
At his side, John chuckles. “Actually, this should be the perfect show for you. It’s all about baking, and you can deduce the contestants.”
“So there he was groaning on the floor holding his head, and in the next instance crying for his bodyguards. And I ran. Kicked him between the legs for good measure, and bolted. I leapt overboard – to run right into the arms of the idiot thugs hired by one of his gambling companions when I emerged from the sea in the harbour. That actually improved my evening, come to think of it,” he ended with a wry smile at John – who was fuming silently.
Sherlock shrugs. “There is no proof that Miss Wilson was indeed suicidal. She didn’t leave a farewell note, and all who knew her describe her as cheerful, and as someone who enjoyed life as best she could. Also, there is the fact that she was dropped off close to where she died, and that the driver is yet unaccounted for.”
“It’s unlikely to stay this way,” mused Katie as she set cereal, fruit and milk before the two men. “The forecast announced more rain for this afternoon.”
“Very well. I wouldn’t mind engaging in some further experimentation on you, too, if you’re willing. And you can wash my hair again. I enjoyed that last time.”
Sherlock has reached for his mobile phone and is reading something on the small screen. Shaking his head, John settles on his side with his back to Sherlock. He dozes off to the steady breathing of his bedmate and dreams of mountains, and himself riding up one dressed as a bee.
Jim nods and with a sigh, pushes himself away from the wall which he seems to have required to steady himself. “Yes, Ray, I’m fine.”
“Haha,” quips John and pinches his side, only to withdraw his hand and mock-glaring at it. “What a mess. We should clean up a bit.”
“You look presentable without your uniform, too,” comments Sherlock, watching John get out of bed and search for his pyjamas, very much approving of the view.
“Indeed. I must speak with Victor tomorrow, perhaps even put a little pressure on him. He’ll be nervous about the time trial and will hopefully be off his guard.”
Sherlock didn’t react, but sat quite still, staring into the small flame with a grave expression. John reached out to gently touch his right hand which he had extended towards it, resting it close to the glass.
, obviously,” says Pedersoli, tall and large for a rider, who is nicknamed ‘Bud’ – because, he explains, he bears the same real name as film legend Bud Spencer. He jokes about Girotti’s nickname ‘Super Mario’. “We tried calling him Terry, for Terence Hill, but Super Mario stuck.”
thinks John Watson when he unloads his bags onto one of the two beds and looks around. The window of his hotel room overlooks The Strand. Despite heavy traffic on the street, the room remains fairly quiet, the joys of double or even triple glazing.
“Obviously,” he says, and then, as if he can’t help it, he chuckles, and then begins to laugh in earnest. Sherlock wonders whether he should feel affronted, whether John is making fun of him. But no, his mirth seems genuine. Sherlock begins to laugh as well, running a hand through his hair.
“That was a close shave, you twat. Almost gave me a heart-attack,” admonishes John. “Found anything interesting in there?”
An agonised cry of “John,” echoes through the room. Sherlock barely recognises his own, high-pitched, terrified voice. He can’t see John clearly, Moran’s bulky form is blocking the view. Sherlock can’t assess how much damage he has done. John is still alive because his legs are moving, trying to kick at Moran’s, but he can’t get to his feet. What is plain to see, however, is that Moran is ready to strike again, to rid himself of the nuisance that is John Watson once and for all.
After a few hundred metres the trees began to increase in density, drawing together in small thickets and copses, with the forest swerving in from the right. The sandy ground rose and fell in rolling ridges. When the riders had reached the top of one, Sherlock held out a hand and reined in his horse. He sniffed the air. “Lucky Strike”, he said.
“Thank you,” he says. Feeling the weight of John’s worried glance on him, he reaches up with his left and strokes the hand still resting on his shoulder. John lets out a long breath. Some of the tension in his face eases. Lestrade drinks the last of his coffee.
Sherlock laughs humourlessly. “Yes, I bet. Sebastian Wilkes and I weren’t exactly friends back at Uni. And arrogance – neither mine nor yours – will help you in your current situation. I will talk to these people – in the case of Dr. Rawlings, I’ve already done that. She was the one to alert Dr. Watson and myself to this matter.”
The leader jerked his head, and the elder of the brothers gripped Sherlock round the middle in an attempt to pull him off the horse. Sherlock held on to Fenja with his thighs, pulling her up so that she reared on her hind legs. But the other brother had dropped his shovel and had attached himself to her bridle, effectively pulling her head down with his weight. She landed heavily on her forelegs again, snorting and trying to toss her head. It was obvious he knew how to deal with frisky horses and wasn’t afraid of upsetting this particular one.
John woke to sunlight flooding the room, and to an empty space next to him. Angling for his watch, he was surprised to find that it was only twenty past nine, meaning he had slept little more than an hour. He stretched carefully, smiling when he felt the residue of their early morning activities in his trousers. He let out a happy laugh, which, however, turned into a groan when he sat up. His shoulder twinged, as did his ribs, and the less said about his thighs, the better.
Mrs. Herdman nodded. “I was making preserves. We have so many quince this year. Walter was complaining. Oh dear,” she started sobbing again, obviously still in shock. Lestrade looked up at Sherlock who was weighing the glass in his hand with a thoughtful expression. Abruptly, he set it down and nodded at John, indicating to him to follow him out into the corridor.
A few riders ahead, he can see Sherlock, weaving elegantly through the narrow bends. The only interactions they’ve had so far today have been a few glances and a nod to one another. They haven’t spoken. Sherlock managed to somehow get changed into his cycling gear, slather himself in sunblock, pack his things and vacate their room when John wasn’t there. According to Molly, he ate breakfast in her’s and Soo Lin’s room and hung out there until it was time for the sign-in. Afterward, he suffered some interaction with the press, his answers curt and evasive. One reporter asked him about his thoughts concerning Victor Trevor’s departure and Sherlock’s predictions for the time trial on the penultimate day of the Tour. Sherlock had fixed the man with a keen look and said, “If I survive the Pyrenees, I will win the time trial.”
“Oh yes, she inherited quite a lot of money,” explains Mrs. Turner. “Enough to buy a house in London.”
Sherlock smiles to himself at the thought. There were times when he would have laughed at anybody suggesting he’d make it past thirty with the kind of life he leads. But he’ll turn forty next year, and now with John apparently determined to stay for good (for now), and moreover Mrs. Hudson beginning to increasingly depend on him, and not to forget Lestrade – the poor man and indeed the entire Metropolitan Police would be utterly lost without Sherlock – the incentive to look after himself has become rather pressing. He’d better last for another ten years, then. Twenty, preferably. Or thirty, forty. In forty years, the trees will have reached full maturity and will be impressive in their height and girth, particularly those on the outer edges of the henge. Suddenly, Sherlock knows that he’d like to see that.
Once again a big thank you to the faithful and undaunted readers of this story who braved the cliffhanger (another warning here: chapter 3 is going to end in one, too), and always to my equally faithful and undaunted beta rifleman_s.
Sherlock nodded. “Quite, yes. I’m terribly excited about it, and admittedly equally apprehensive. But I’m also rather uncomfortably aroused. So ...,” he shrugged, smiling a little sheepishly, “if you would do the honours of deflowering me, I’d be obliged and indeed grateful. I think.”
The girl, apparently eager to have found an audience, carried on regardlessly. “Weißt du wie der Yoda dem Luke sein Raumschiff aus dem Sumpf gezogen hat?” She sprang up, stood firmly on both feet and stretched out her arms, mimicking a concentrated Jedi-pose. “So nämlich. Mit der Macht. Und der Luke, der konnte das da noch nicht. Und der Yoda, der hat dem Luke seinen Müsliriegel gegessen, der hat ihm aber nicht geschmeckt. Magst du Müsliriegel? Ich mag die mit Erdnüssen und Schokolade. Die schmecken wie Snickers.”
To their surprise, Churchill rises from his chair, walks round the desk wreathed in acrid smoke, and proceeds to shake their hands, his grip firm, although Sherlock notices that he is surprisingly gentle with Brenda Connolly and her injury. “Good morning, ladies, gents,” says Churchill. “It’s good of you to come. Your involvement in certain developments both here and in London have been brought to my attention by Commander Denniston and Mycroft here, and seeing that your discoveries and feats of bravery have been made at personal risk, as well as showing that particular kind of doggedness, perseverance and intelligence we, as a nation, should value more, I thought it only appropriate to thank you personally. Mr. Holmes,” he inclines his head towards Sherlock, “Misses Hooper and Connolly, please note that thanks to your contributions which have been much lauded by your superiors to whom I have just spoken, extra funding will be given to ‘Station X’, the Government Code and Cypher School here at Bletchley, which, as I understand, is sorely needed to maintain the excellence of this institution. Commendations will also go to the Metropolitan Police for their conduct in the case of Sebastian Moran, and for the skilful investigation of the delicate case pertaining to the demise of Miss Jennifer Wilson. Dr. Watson, you will be commended for your services, too. Personally, I have to say I am impressed by the conduct by all of you. Utmost professionalism. This is the only way we can win this war. Carry on, ladies and gentlemen.”
“Or she lied to you and Lestrade. Lord Moran’s death is public knowledge. And Moran Jr. has constructed a heroic tale about his involvement in the evacuation at Dunkirk. Why would he tell her he was wounded in Egypt instead? Well, it should be fairly easy to consult his military records to find out whether he really was stationed in North Africa at some point. Anyway, either he lied, or she did.”
Cold, desperate fear grips Sherlock’s heart. What if he sheltered here with his sheep when the cyclone struck? Sherlock looks at the mess of tangled, broken trees. Nobody would survive in this. He strips off his heavy rucksack and lets it drop where he stands, before leaping down the dyke into the mess below. Against common sense but with a sliver of hope that Jan may be around as he promised in the summer, Sherlock begins to cry out his friend’s name. His voice echoes through the mist, sounding high-pitched and desperate even to his ears.
“Nobody. Although given her family’s history, her helping those who persecute her relatives is very unlikely. According to what we learned, an aunt Miss Adler values very highly was recently deported to Dachau. We do not know what happened to her there. Miss Adler is and has always been highly independent and perhaps also somewhat ambiguous when it comes to what is commonly accepted as morals, but she does know right from wrong.”
Soo Lin cocks an eyebrow. “Yeah, right. With a sack over your head or what? A different bike doesn’t make a different man, you know. You’re well known, and so is John.”
“Yes. So far, we’ve assumed that Jenny procured the message from work, that she encountered it while working on her teleprinter, that it looked unusual to her, bright as she was, and that therefore, she tried to find out more about it.”
“Anyway, after I’d been told off like a naughty child, had apologised and peace had been restored, the steward, Arthur by name, provided me with tea, cake and, well, Toblerone. He seems to be an ardent fan, buys it at every airport’s duty free. He gave me one bar of dark chocolate, for dark times.” He swallowed slightly, his gaze absent, a frown creasing his brows.
Sherlock beams at him. “Yes, you see. Not much has changed. Formerly, you treated the living, now you treat the dead. The same goes for me. Those people I solved cases for in the past few weeks must have been ghosts, too. Perhaps this is why there wasn’t a murder. Not sure if we can actually die again, or cease to be ghosts somehow. Oh, John, this is fascinating. An entire new field of study and scientific exploration. Oh, I don’t think I’ll be bored again for a long time while we explore this new state of existence.”
the constant hooting of the motorcycles and the tolling of cow-bells by the fans, the harsh croaks of ravens flying overhead can be heard.
clean. I’d need proof of rehab and all that. Without it, no chance, I’m afraid – which would be a real shame.”
Sherlock feels his head twitch in a tiny nod. There is no way back now. The truth will be out in a moment, his heart laid bare. He is terrified of John’s reaction. Everything is going to change now. He closes his eyes – only to startle and blink when a knock sounds at the door. John curses under his breath, and the curse, of all things, snaps Sherlock out of his shocked state. He starts to chuckle, and after a moment, John joins him.
“You can, actually. It’s over there,” says Sherlock round a mouthful of dessert. He points at the blue line of hills in the distance. “But I was surveilling something closer at hand. Train the camera over there, on the new part of the town beyond the old city wall. The building with the many gables, and particularly the car park next to it.”
John swallowed, but checked himself when he saw Sherlock watching him keenly, his expression grave but set. “Remember what I told you about pitying me, John,” he said, giving John once more the uncanny feeling that he’d just read his thoughts.
Wilcox looks down at the dancers for a while. “She’s one in a million, that woman,” he says, his expression strangely grave. He turns to Sherlock. “I’d be lying if I claimed that I’m not enjoying my outings here in London. Kent is exceedingly boring in comparison. And Irene ... if it weren’t for my task at hand, I’d woo her in earnest, I think.”
“Indeed not, and well for it. Okay, you go in front again. And I'll take you up on the offer of taking the rucksack. My shoulder is playing up, and I don't want to aggravate it further by the extra weight.”
John didn’t catch what his companion told the uniformed woman behind the counter, but a short while later Sherlock waved to him to bring up the luggage. Together they entered via the First Class lane and managed to jump the queue both at passport controls and security, to then hurry onto the train.
“No,” he said earnestly, manoeuvring their joined hands from under the blanket, raising them to his lips and kissing Sherlock’s knuckles lightly.
John laughed nervously at the astute observation and its frank delivery, his cheeks burning. “Yes, there is all that,” he admitted meekly.
After about two hundred yards of winding through the undergrowth, the path turns sharply to the right and descends more steeply down an earthy, slippery slope. Molly pushed her bike up here, as can be seen clearly by the tracks she and her conveyance left behind. Carefully, the men climb down. On the bottom, they are greeted with moist air and the smell of clay. Through the slender willows, alders and birches that grow on the level stretch out of patches of reeds and rushes and flowering purple loosestrife, Sherlock can see the crumbling, earthy walls of the old clay pit. Erosion lines where water ran down the sides of the quarry have created fascinating patterns in the clay, which is stacked in layers of different colour, starting with reds and ochres and fading to a light grey near the bottom of the pit where the light of the early sun is reflected on the still surface of a small pond. Its waters are slightly opaque and of an intense light blue, almost turquoise colour, and they are thickly grown with all kinds of weeds and waterplants.
John leans closer to the frame, obviously searching for a signature, before glancing at Sherlock. “What’s on the back?”
John’s eyebrows shot up into his hairline. “You, a dancer?” he asked in surprise. But when he thought about it, the idea didn’t seem so preposterous. Sherlock definitely had the looks and figure to pull it off, and moreover he moved with a grace and poise that spoke of great body control, almost hinted at formal training. John knew that despite his slender frame, he was strong and fit. And he was musical.
Faint, shuffling footsteps sound from the other room, the door opens as the other limps into the bathroom. Sherlock can hear the light switch, followed by running water. He realises he is thirsty as well. Hasn’t drunk enough during the day, should have done so before he brushed his teeth. The light in the bathroom is switched off. Sherlock decides to wait until the other has returned to his room before he makes a foray to the tap. But the doctor seems to have other plans. The stairs creak as he carefully makes his way down, likely to the kitchen.
Sherlock nods. Something bugs him about this. It’s all too ... tidy, isn’t it? Something is off about this mysterious valet. He hopes Wiggins and his contacts have found out more about him in the meantime. The valet being in the employ of Naval Intelligence or the Secret Service makes sense if Moran was in their sights all along, but why have The Woman spy on him as well? Is this a case of one branch of the intelligence services not knowing what another is up to? Or is this valet not who he seems? Could he have fooled his superiors? Is he in league with Moran, even, and has been all along?
Trafalgar Square is a riot of colourful advertising. A large crowd has assembled in front of the stage and screens, eager to see the teams and their bicycles, and to snatch a water bottle or some other promotional item. Flags, balloons and giant hand-shaped signs are waving in the audience. Many onlookers have arrived on bicycles and are wearing yellow jerseys, or green ones or white ones with red polka dots similar to the one awarded to the winner of the Mountain classification. Others have donned jerseys of last year’s Tour de France teams, or of local cycling clubs. Some have come straight from work, their suit jackets over their arms and their shirt-sleeves rolled up because of the heat. Tourists have flocked to the square as well. Some have climbed onto the lion statues for a better view. The mood is expectant and quite buoyant. Whatever anxiety befell John back in his room, it’s abated somewhat now. He’s in his element, dressed in cycling gear, surrounded by his teammates, many of whom he counts as his friends. The adoration of the onlookers ... The only time he is happier and more at ease with himself and the world is when he is actually riding his bicycle.
John smiles at him. “Before I went in after the two goons, I heard what they told the driver to get for them. The smaller bloke ordered ... I don’t remember all of it, but it was decaf, and sounded disgustingly sweet. Double caramel macchiato or some fancy shit like that. It’s not hot anymore, but—oi, take it slow, Sherlock.”
A hand appears on his shoulder, squeezing it gently and disappearing almost immediately. “Friend,” Jan suggests, pointing at Lightning, and then at Sherlock and himself. Sherlock sniffs and beams at him. “Really? But he is yours. I mean, you need him to look after the sheep.”
“I told you before that sometimes, the top floor is used by others for storage. Also, the owner could have sent someone. Guess how pleased he’d be to find two bodies in his property.”
Sherlock frowns. Is this what kids talk about nowadays? School must be even more hellish than when he was a boy. “That’s utter rubbish.”
A tiny voice in John’s head perks up to firmly object, to repeat his usual sermon of ‘it’s not like it, I’m not actually gay, bla bla bla’. But somehow, it gets silenced by Sherlock’s wary expression. He looks as if he, too, is expecting these words and is bracing himself for the hurt they must cause him. John tells the voice to shut up, because Sherlock is right. These are his friends, people he trusts. And he likes Sherlock, he really, really does. So what if they believe there’s actually something going on between them? Sherlock said he wasn’t interested, but on the other hand he offered a flatshare. And the more John thinks about it, the more he realises that the idea really appeals to him. And he hasn’t even seen the bloody flat yet. It could be the most hideous dive. But then he’d be sharing it with Sherlock ...
An old, squat brick building is situated next to the bridge. From there, the longest of the weirs extends all the way across the river to their hotel. If one were careful, John guesses, one could walk along the crest of the weir and cross the river this way. Due to the heat and lack of rain during the past months, water levels are fairly low. Flat, stony islands have appeared in the river below the weir. Here, what looks like an old lock and water-gate extend into the clear waters. John assumes that the building used to be a watermill, and that the channel and lock once provided a strong current to turn the wheel. The building looks deserted, but the walls of the lock reaching into the river are still touched by the evening sun. Taking a careful look around for warning signs, but not finding any – he doesn’t want to be caught trespassing – John rounds the mill building and walks out onto one of the arms of the lock. Small trees, scrubs and flowering plants are growing at its base, dipping into the water. The rough cement plaster of the brick wall is cracked and crumbling in places, exposing the brick beneath.
Returning from his lunch break, Stamford visits him in the lab, bringing with him the perfect candidate. In retrospect, Sherlock isn’t sure whether he falls in love with John right away, or whether it takes another day, a chase, a shot and a late Chinese dinner. But fall he does. He doesn’t realise what’s going on at first. It takes some getting used to suddenly having a flatmate – and what’s more, a friend.
Wilkes regards John with new interest before looking at Sherlock. “What’s this then, Sherlock? Got yourself not just an admirer, but an assistant?”
Sherlock picks up another bit of rubble, weighing it in his hands. “I don’t know. I don’t ... I have no comparison. I wanted his friendship and approval. I enjoyed his attention. Some of the physical affection, too, before it became too much, too overwhelming. I don’t know whether this was love.”
“Did you grow up there?” he asks, nodding ahead. They have reached Hyde Park Corner. The tall trees of the park are looming darkly behind Wellington’s Arch. How long they are going to endure when the war doesn’t end soon and rationing gets even more severe, with even more coal being used for factories instead of heating private households? Sherlock never thought much about the trees before, but with a sudden, fierce realisation he knows that he would miss them. As a child, he enjoyed spending time in Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens, at one point vowing to live there like Peter Pan and never grow up. Well, some people would argue that he hasn’t grown up much, at least not when it comes to the acquisition of certain experiences.
“I’m going to new Covent Garden Flower Market to have a look around. Business should be mostly done for today, but some of the traders may still be about. I also need to ... contact a few people. I know some folks who usually hang out in the Battersea area. Perhaps they saw something. How much cash have you got?”
“Sundew,” he said. “Oh, I loved flesh-eating plants as a kid, too. Had several venus flytraps, only most didn’t last long because Harry would shut them by sticking in her fingers. So, you had some, too.”
Sherlock smiles at him, open and unguarded for a moment. He’d love to lean in and kiss him again, but even though Lestrade might not mind, others certainly would.
“I’d say that’s very probable,” he declares. “In all likelihood, Moran met her at this or a similar event. I also wonder whether she has ever appeared in any films, either as a singer or as an actress.”
Sherlock sighs. It’s still embarrassing to admit that at times, he has to lower himself to engage in an activity as base and tedious as masturbation. It makes him human, that’s what John would probably say. But Sherlock has striven for years to hold himself above the demands of his body. And now he’s supposed to submit to them. “Nothing out of the ordinary. It just continues to run through the tasks I set it. It’s nothing like what just happened. It’s never been this ... intense.”
“Again possible, but improbable. The children would have taken their treasure and brought it to their den to consume at their leisure, or to trade the chocolate for other things.”
“It’s awfully remote,” stated Sherlock. “It's a marvel they have electricity up here. According to common perception, however, I grant you it has a certain romantic quality, particularly with the rough weather moving in.”
“Oi,” protested John, but without any ire. Sherlock only cocked an eyebrow in challenge and grinned, and John couldn’t contain the laughter bubbling up in him. Good God, he’d just had sex with Sherlock Holmes, his best friend, and it had been sweet and awkward and a bit clumsy and touching and altogether special and spectacular. Now Sherlock was watching him with a peculiar expression which John could only describe as fond. There was a small trace of insecurity lingering in the faint frown lines on his forehead, but his eyes were large and gentle, and he was smiling. “You liked it, then,” he concluded, his words not quite a question.
John, Gregson and Anderson meet them in the team bus. It provides some shelter from the cold wind that is blasting the almost tree-less plateau while they wait for the rest of the team to arrive. Their hotel is in Foix, some fifty kilometres northwards at the foot of the mountains, meaning a short transfer once all riders are assembled. Both Sherlock and Kit look as exhausted as John feels. As they review some of the race footage on a tv-screen, some wonder about what happened with Moriarty and Wilkes.
John laughs. “Lucky them.” He licks his lips, trying not to look at Sherlock’s crotch and failing. Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Nothing you haven’t seen before, John,” he says.
“We can take a cab if you’re cold,” suggested John as they waited for a break in traffic in order to cross the road.
Sherlock turns to him and regards him, one eyebrow raised. “We’ll see. First, I need some food while cooling down, and then shower and massage. My legs are shaking so much I can barely stand.”
Upstairs in his room, Sherlock barely waits for John to step through the door before pulling him inside, shutting the door with a click and backing him up against, it. He dislodges Sherlock’s dressing gown in the process which slides off its hook and to the ground, the dark-blue silk pooling round John’s polished shoes. John doesn’t seem very surprised by the gesture. He makes a small sound at being so manhandled, but grins all the same when Sherlock crowds him against the door, towering over him, his eyes boring into the doctor’s which are already large and dark, the pupils dilated by arousal.
Again he curses the lack of light and the fact his watch has been taken. He could have listened to the seconds ticking by to time the exact interval of the trains, and thus determine which line it might be. No watch was left on Nora Perkins, either. He checked. Her phone is gone, too (of course, it went offline when she vanished), as is her wallet. They left her bracelet and the ear piercings, though, and her ring. She wasn’t wealthy, anyway, and her jewellery was plain and unspectacular, nothing to attract robbers. No, she must have been killed for another reason, and it seems to be linked to her knowledge of some of these strange subterranean spaces.
Sherlock swallows again, fighting down images from the past that wash up with the force of a tidal wave. Suddenly, he has difficulty focusing his eyes, and when he reaches up to scuff at them, he feels wetness. This is ... unexpected. And yet perhaps not, given that the last time he was here, the same eyes witnessed utter destruction.
“Feeling better?” enquires Lestrade concernedly. He draws up a chair and sits down. The table is covered in paperwork: police files and photographs, and what looks like an old map of Brompton Road Station. John has already given his statement, there’s a form near Lestrade’s elbow filled in with his regular handwriting, and signed with John’s doctor’s scrawl.
Kit, who has been watching Lachapelle sign in, relaxes gradually and sighs. “I know. I know all that. It’s just ... I feel good today.”
Sherlock casts a quick glance at him as he places the case on the chair and opens it. John seems nervous. Why is he nervous? He’s only supposed to listen and to fall asleep eventually. Sherlock has all reason to be nervous. He’s about to play. It’s been a long time since he last played for an audience deliberately and voluntarily, and he hasn’t had a lot of practice lately. He doubts that John is a harsh critic when it comes to solo violin performances, certainly not as harsh as Sherlock is of his own skills, but he doesn’t want to disappoint him, either. He wants to impress him. John has just called him extraordinary. The word has lodged in Sherlock’s chest like a warm, glowing ember. He wants to feed it with more praise from John, make it spark and flame.
He watched Sherlock swallow, and also took in the slight flush colouring his cheeks and the dilation of his pupils which had nothing to do with the failing light. “You wouldn’t do this without my expressed consent,” said Sherlock, his voice rougher than usual, eyeing John with a mixture of wariness and excitement.
“We look a little like that, too,” observed Sherlock, giving John’s bare arms a glance. Because of the atypical English summer, there was a line at his wrists where the cycling gloves began, with an accompanying line further up where the jersey’s sleeve ended, now hidden by the sleeve of John’s shirt.
John straightens and looks at him, sighing and shaking his head. “Don’t be silly. I meant what I told Gregson. I do feel my age today. The Pyrenees have left their mark. And even though I might generally feel invigorated by present company, this doesn’t change the fact that I’m almost forty, that this is the final week of the Tour de France, and that I’m exhausted. No, seriously, Sherlock. It’s kind of you to say that, but I’d really prefer to be your
What remains even more obscure than the identity of the kidnappers is the motive. The Warringtons are well off. Sherlock has done some light research into their circumstances since receiving the initial email. Vanessa Warrington works for Worthing Council while Daniel is part of the management of a medium-sized IT company based near Brighton, with a subsidiary branch specialising in developing mobile apps based in London’s East End. Tiffany is their only child.
Sherlock stares at him in surprise at the admission, then begins to chuckle. “So I’m your personal hot water bottle now?”
Sherlock studies him gravely. “But welcome?” he enquires, the caution and gentleness in his voice surprising in light of his previous, blunt deduction.
a grown-up Gordie typed into a computer looking like it was from the stone-age, reminding John how much had changed since the mid-1980s despite them not seeming so long ago. “
Mounting proved painful and difficult, but with Sherlock giving him a hand up, John managed. Cradling his left arm to his abdomen, he held the reins only lightly with his right, hoping that there wasn’t going to be much steering required on the way back. Sherlock mounted as well. “Do you want me to take your reins?”
“Have you?” asks John softly. “I’ve been wondering, to be honest. You’ve been ... different, lately.”
Eager to talk to Sherlock, John hurries towards their room. He is familiar with the hotel, having stayed there during a previous Tour. He likes it, particularly the indoor pool (which will probably be occupied throughout the entire evening as the hotel is fully booked by their team and two others with their retinues. It’s situated in the small ski resort of La Clusaz, about ten minutes’ drive from Le Grand-Bornand, on the south-facing slopes of a valley where it overlooks an impressive range of hills dotted with ski-lifts, mostly dormant now during the summer months, although some are used by hikers and mountain-bikers throughout the year. Most of the rooms are decorated in a chalet style typical for the area with wooden cladding covering walls and ceilings, wooden furniture and colourful soft furnishings, creating a cosy, rustic and yet modern look.
“Right, in the stomach contents. Even though livestock may eat the leaves and flowers of this plant without danger, the roots are highly poisonous, containing oenanthotoxin. About one root usually suffices to kill a cow – or a horse for that matter, even a large one like Rædwald. That’s why Hensley recognised the toxin, I guess, as there are a few cases each year of livestock poisoning themselves by eating the roots when they’ve been exposed by strong rains or drainage works.”
and I expect there’ll be plenty of attacks. Those of you who feel they can’t be of help to Sherlock, Kit or Philip, you can sit back and ride
Sherlock inclines his head. “And yet. I had a thorough look at the rear brake cable. It was frayed, as it would be if it snapped of its own accord. But it’s not as frayed as it should have been. Also, the breaking point is very close to the actual brake, where the cable isn’t protected by the tubing of the frame.”
“Oh,” breathes Sherlock, who realises that in all this excitement, he must have deleted that intercourse potentially involves nakedness. The thought of seeing John completely bare before he dives under the covers again, even if it’s just in the dim light of early morning, thrills him. “Yes, please. Do you need help with the vest?”
Nevertheless, Sherlock douses the light and steps over to the window to pull aside the curtains and open it. He is greeted by a gust of cold wind carrying a faint trace of petrichor. Rain must be approaching. Between racing clouds, faint stars are visible through the branches and many-fingered leaves of the large chestnut tree growing outside the window. Sherlock frequently used that tree as an escape route into the garden when officially, he was confined to his room. Sometimes, he even climbed the wall of the property to visit the nearby cemetery or roam further, into Hyde Park or down into Chelsea to walk the mudflats of the Thames during low tide.
Just when Magnussen increases the tempo yet again, Moriarty rises in the saddle to speed after him. While doing so, he lurches close to one of the spectators. Some part of his bike catches the Basque flag the man is holding, effectively bringing him to an abrupt halt. Moriarty struggles to free his feet from the pedals, fails to unclip them and crashes to his left, taking down Kit who was riding right behind him. Wilkes manages to swerve just in time and avoid getting caught in the cash and rides on, gazing over his shoulder. John and Sherlock avoid the crash as well. John sees Kit leap back to his feet and mount, seemingly unhurt but for a few scratches, while Moriarty struggles to free his bike from the flag. Eventually, he tears it free, stumbles as he tries to mount, almost crashes again, but then makes it into the saddle. The shocked Basque fan and some others rush to Moriarty and try to push him to get him going again. Moriarty swats at him angrily. The man jumps back, raising both hands in apology. The other bystanders desist interfering as well.
had by now also reached the summit and were rushing into the descent, but John hardly saw it, lost in his memories. The drumming of Sherlock’s fingers on the armrest of his chair brought him back to the present. When John looked at him, he noticed that his flatmate was watching him with a curiously tender expression which was immediately replaced by a faked bored look.
The peloton has left Greenwich and is approaching London’s Green Belt when the many small, mostly solitary breakaway attempts coalesce into something more coordinated and potentially more dangerous for Team Speedy’s. A group of seven riders has distanced itself from the peloton. Working together by taking turns of riding in the wind, their lead has quickly amounted to two minutes, and is increasing. The stage is long, more than two hundred kilometres in total, meaning a lead like this won’t worry Greg or Sally. Normally, an organised peloton interested in catching breakaways can gain a minute or more on them over the course of ten kilometres. They haven’t even reached Kent yet, so there’s no hurry.
shouldn’t be so surprised, but it had still felt novel to experience through his body how much indeed Sherlock cared. All the fears and worries John – and Sherlock, too – had harboured for so long had been groundless. It worked, their brand of intimacy, awkward and experimental though it was at this stage. John knew that it would get better once they’d become more attuned to each other’s needs. Like in so many other things, they clicked in bed. Not just John had enjoyed their tryst, but apparently so had Sherlock, his reluctance to let himself be touched aside.
John turned to him fully. “I don’t know. They looked pretty shaken, and not just from your deduction. Was that really necessary?”
Lestrade rubs the back of his neck. “Well, with James Sholto out, we needed someone who’d do well in the time trials and would fit in with the team. Those riders of our own not selected for the Tour were already booked for other races or unavailable due to injuries. I didn’t even know that Sherlock was back on the market again, so to say, until a mutual acquaintance pointed out his availability. We met, discussed things, he was interested in joining. It took a while to sort out logistics and stuff, but here he is, and I’m excited that he’s with us.”
“The Hunterian Collection,” explains John, stepping forward to come to stand at Sherlock’s side. “It’s fine, Daniel, don’t worry. I went there as a kid, too, and it didn’t scar me for life. Quite the contrary, really. It made me want to become a doctor.”
Sherlock watches him. Again, John finds it impossible to read his expression. Is he angry, sad, or simply resigned? Or is he amused, in a dry, sarcastic way? Eventually, Sherlock’s shoulders twitch in a shrug. “I was disqualified for intravenous drug use. You saw my arm.”
Sherlock sucks in a breath in surprise, seems about to protest. John holds up a hand. “I mean it, you know. You’re ... I mean, you can be extremely sharp and cutting, and I’m sure there are lots of people who can’t deal with your directness, and the fact that often, you blurt out things about them they’d rather not hear. But here you are, trying to ... don’t know. Cheer me up, give me advice – which may not be exactly welcome, but necessary, I think. You’re right, I have been trying to hide certain things and probably made life a little hard for myself because of it. You’re not a sociopath, not really. You’re actually quite—”
The replay is showing John’s little group during their descent from Port de Pailhères. Gregson laughs. “Oh nothing, only Johnny here playing the Good Samaritan and helping a rider from another team. Trevor seems to have been overdoing things yesterday. He struggled a bit downhill – completely done in, probably. Had us worried he’d crash. So John told him to ride between us and follow his lead. We got him down in one piece.”
Sherlock tenses. His heart is beating so forcefully that he is sure that John must be able to hear it, and see the pulse racing in his throat. John licks his lips, his eyes steady on Sherlock’s, his expression kind as he continues.
Not only French onlookers are lining the route. Cycling fans from a great variety of nations have travelled to the region Rhône-Alpes, their cars and caravans parked along the route as their owners stand happily waving their flags while wearing colourful outfits. Emmanuel Macron, the French President, is expected to meet today’s winner at Le Grand-Bornand, being flown in from Paris after the traditional parade on Champs-Élysées. French cyclists in particular are burning for a stage win on this special day, which leads to several attacks and breakaway attempts on the first kilometres, which, however, are thwarted by the sprinter teams interested in their men winning points in the first intermediate sprint of the day, not long after the start. The second is going to be after the first mountain, meaning most sprinters will have fallen behind by then.
He digs out the notebook and writes down the number. John looks at it curiously. “Whose number is that?”
They don’t meet anybody on the stairs nor in the corridor leading to the back door. The mechanics are still at work as evidenced by the sounds coming from their cellar room. John and Sherlock slip past quickly and head outside. Their bicycles and helmets are where they left them in front of the hotel. Some of the black Brook Consulting team cars are gone. With John in tow, Sherlock cycles to a nearby sports supplies shop. It mostly caters to alpine skiers but also offers climbing and hiking gear, as well as some basic cycling supplies.
“Right, guys, I’m off,” Katie called through the open car door. “Good luck with the two ladies here.” She nodded at the horses. “And text me if there’s anything new. I’ll be round once I’m finished down at Hollesley.”
Sherlock grins at him. “Oh John, as soon you’ll learn – or perhaps remember already – I’m all for experimentation. Just stay clear of the mole. The rest of me is all yours.”
“You can drop me off there,” growls John, hating himself for having to admit that he’s in that bad a shape today. “I won’t be of much use to you after this climb, or even for what remains of it. I’m completely done in. Sorry.”
“Let’s just say Wiggins has been very helpful, and so have others – and of course there are our own investigations which have brought interesting things to light. But there is no clear proof yet, no official confirmation, therefore it’s too early to reveal anything. I expect to see other revelations first.”
John stares at him in shock. Sherlock has a way of cutting right to the bone, taking no prisoners. John swallows, feeling hot all of a sudden. This is not how he expected this day to begin. “I ... what teammate are you referring to?”
John shook his head, grinning. Then he looked up at Sherlock. “Sounds like a fairly normal bloke to me. Why would anybody assassinate him, if that’s what happened – and the evidence so far does point in that direction. Oh ... wait a moment. Wasn’t the other florist found murdered also in Kensington? And how can an average flower dealer afford to live in Notting Hill? He’d need a fairly large place, too, if he’s got several water tanks standing round for his plants and corals. Does he offer them online?”
“How about we have a cup of tea at the canteen?” suggests Molly brightly. She is still floating on air due to her promotion, smiling all over and almost skipping along. Brenda nods enthusiastically. “Yes, I’m dying for a cuppa. They should have offered us a drink at least. So much for hospitality. Are you coming as well, Mr. Lestrade?”
, to be precise. His wife, who had been baking the gingerbread, claims her recipe was ordinary, handed down from her German grandmother. I have been experimenting with ways of slipping poison into it without said substances showing up in toxicology screenings or being detectable by taste.”
“He’s a detective, too,” added Lucy helpfully. “And a knight of the White Rose. And they fight the Red Rose. And they eat sweet buns all the time because Eva-Lotta’s daddy is a baker.”
A big thank you for your patience, all of you who have been waiting for this story to be finished for the past ... four years. It will be. Soon(ish). Also thank you again to the faithful readers and commenters, and always to rifleman_s for betaing.
Sherlock’s eyes lingered on John’s face before he turned to the window again and lifted his shoulders in a shrug. “I don’t know. Perhaps eventually, after being together for a while, to see what all the fuss was about. But it didn’t happen, so all speculation is purely hypothetical anyway. And before you ask, no, I certainly didn’t want to sleep with the Woman. There is only one person I can imagine doing that with, and you know who that is. And to return to your initial enquiry, because I think that’s what you were aiming for and wanting to ask in the first place but are too embarrassed to actually say, yes, I do feel the urge to be close to you, and I find myself increasingly wanting to touch you or be touched by you. Moreover, as you’ve correctly spotted, my control on my libido has somewhat slackened lately, a sad fact which can entirely be blamed on you.”
John snorted, his eyes wide in a mixture of shock and amusement. “You sent Mrs. H. to buy you new underwear?”
Despite him riding neither to improve his standing in the GC nor for the stage win, as soon as he is out on the road, John can feel the adoration of the onlookers like a wave engulfing him and spurring him on to begin his ride faster than he intended. The cheers and calls of
“I’m still awake,” he rumbles. His words are slurred though, and his movements sluggish and slow when he tries to rouse himself and push more than his head out of the water.
After getting ready for bed, John spends some time researching Jefferson Hope and the team he rides for, but doesn’t find anything to bolster theories that Hope caused John to crash on purpose. Googling Team Brook Consulting inevitably leads to fan sites about Moriarty and Moran, which in turn leads to social media entries about Sherlock and John. Most of it is fun: people making wallpapers of their favourite riders, or tweeting about the stages. There are the usual trolls. John finds a few following his twitter account, blocks most of them and reports two who lashed out with vile racist and homophobic talk.
Sherlock thinks for a moment. They should have discussed this instead of planning a future together that may never come to pass, he realises. But on the other hand, he wouldn’t want to have missed John’s confession for the world. The memory fills him with warmth, and he has to force his thoughts back to the present.
Lestrade sighs, motioning over to the desk he’s just occupied. “Please, have a seat, madam.” One of the policemen receives a nodded command to organise another chair, which he promptly supplies.
“Nice of you to correct them,” John replied good-naturedly. “Did you inform them of the error of their ways?”
“For me, too. But as I promised, the next one will be better,” said John, kissing Sherlock’s temple. His eyes fell on the mug on the coffee table. “Are you going to drink your milk at all?”
“I needed the loo. Look, I know I’m not the only one having nightmares. And I can prescribe you something to help you sleep, if you want. Perhaps it would also help if you talked about what’s troubling you. To me, or a professional, whatever you prefer. Your time abroad ... I know that’s still troubling you. And what happened with Magnussen was—”
“Yes, yes, there are. How about ...,” Victor motions towards the other side of the patio where fewer people have congregated. When Sherlock doesn’t immediately set into motion, after a moment’s hesitation, Victor raises his hand and touches him lightly between the shoulder-blades, steering him away from the other two. Sherlock tenses slightly at the touch. John sees him swallow. But he lets himself be swept away. John feels the acute urge to follow, but a brief glance from Sherlock over his shoulder and a minute shake of his head stop him. He lets out a deep breath, his hand clenching at his side.
To distract himself from his own confusing emotions, he lets his eyes wander through the room. Some members of the band have joined Jim in his corner. All have sad and sombre looks on their faces. Ray is standing with his arm round Jim’s shoulders and handing him a handkerchief, most likely to dry his eyes and blow his nose, both of which look rather red and blotchy. He surmises that Jim has informed his fellow band members about Jenny’s death, and they appear to share his grief. The longer he watches the band leader, the more Sherlock is convinced that he told them the truth, and that he had no hand in her demise.
“Let me unwrap your hand. I’ll apply a new bandage afterwards. I’d like to check the swelling, anyway, and we should put on some more Voltarol after the bath,” he says.
Taking out his mobile to check for a reaction from Lestrade or Mycroft – there isn’t one, worryingly –, he leans his back against the door – and almost looses his footing when it swings inwards.
Sherlock rolls his eyes but looks pleased all the same. “It’s not actually difficult, particularly not when one has mastered basic chemistry.”
“Basically, yes. Comes in a nice package, too. Anyway, feel free to use me as your personal pillow in exchange.”
John shrugs, half turning to him. “You tell me. You could just ask, you know, instead of trying to deduce it.”
John’s eyebrows shoot up. “Emotional, you? Oh dear, what happened to the aloof, rational codebreaker I met less than a week ago?”
“Okay. Can you make it into the bathroom? Good. Guess you’ll need help with undressing. I’ll be with you in a moment. Let me just briefly use the loo.”
“How can we know all this now? How do people find out all these things?” Tiffany wants to know. Sherlock smiles, pleased by her genuine interest.
While he is talking, Sherlock sees how John’s eyes have begun to shine. He looks sad and strangely elated at the same time. At length, he swallows and runs a hand over his eyes. “It sounds lovely, all of it. Well, of course not the bad, hurtful bits. But the rest ... the domesticity ... You’ll tell me everything, won’t you? What really happened at Barts, and with my wife, and why I was so angry at you?”
Moran, however, is an experienced fencer himself. He parries Sherlock’s attack almost effortlessly, only conceding a little space by stepping back into the room, avoiding the tiger head. His eyes are glinting dangerously, strands of his formerly slicked-back hair are falling into his forehead, and the corner or his mouth is lifted in a faint, mocking smile. He seems utterly convinced of his superior skills. Sherlock is determined to wipe the smirk from his face.
“Listening. Trying to cheer me up. All this talk about relationships – and sex – it really isn’t something I’d have picked as a fun activity. Especially not before eight in the morning while sober. But it was ... good. Helpful, I guess.”
“Distraction,” he said, adding, “obviously,” in his habitual haughty tone, as if to maintain a last vestige of his steely, impregnable outer shell.
When he turns a corner and the house becomes fully visible, he decides to have a look at the landlady first and base the further course of proceeding on the impression she makes. As he approaches, he spots two women in the small courtyard in front of the main entrance and the majestic elm tree. Apparently, one has visited the other to fetch vegetables and eggs, which are assembled in a large enamelled bowl. In exchange, she seems to have brought a bucket containing some kind of sludge which at another glance turns out to be kitchen scraps, probably to feed a pig or some other kind of animal.
“Billy here told us you need our expertise, Mr. Holmes,” says Joan. She talks with a slight German accent. Not born in England, then, but has been living in Spitalfields for a while. Sherlock wonders whether her real name is Johanna.
receive a warning they’re going to try to back it up by testing extra carefully. Doping is still a very contentious and sensitive topic.”
Mr. Suffield shakes his hand. “Our lad’s in the navy, too, a radio operator. He’s currently stationed in the Mediterranean. Where were you serving, sir, if I may ask?”
Sherlock does. The package contains a scarf of soft dark-blue wool, about the same colour as John’s uniform. He smiles a little sheepishly when Sherlock runs his hands over the wool. It’s expensive, made of Merino and Cashmere wool. “I found it in London. And I thought ... with you being somewhat sensitive to colds and sore throats after your struggle with pneumonia, and with winter coming, and you cycling to work in cold weather ... Anyway, I hope you like it. Something to remember me by.”
Sherlock studies him, smiles thinly. The man knows more than he is letting on. “Isn’t there supposed to be a protective fleece or tarpaulin under the gravel beds to prevent weeds from growing?” he enquires.
“We are doing our best, Mr. Moriarty, rest assured,” Lestrade tells him. “As I said before, I am sorry to spring this information on you like this. Thank you for your cooperation. For now, I think it would be best if we returned inside. Do you think you will be able to continue?”
John cocks his head. “Why the frown, then?” He reaches up to gently trace the lines on Sherlock’s forehead.
“True. But I wasn’t finished. The fact that she rummaged in her pocket for a napkin suggests she wasn’t sitting down at a restaurant for her meal and that she didn’t use cutlery, meaning she didn’t have a slice of cake at a café but something you eat out of your hand. The same is indicated by the stains on her t-shirt. She ate something on the go, and some of the juices dribbled onto her front. Seems to have been something healthy, perhaps vegetarian, containing fresh salad with either red cabbage or beetroot.”
Sherlock huffs softly as he lets John step past him into the building and shuts the door behind them. A motion sensor ignites the overhead lighting of the corridor they’re standing in. “There wasn’t any guesswork involved, just observation and a quick online search. The lock is fairly old. I was worried one would need a keycard to get access, as you do at our hotel. But this of course is far more convenient for us. The number, when it was installed, was chosen so that staff and users could remember it easily. They haven’t changed it since. Few people do. Six digits. The first one, as one can see from the residue left on it, is clearly a seven. Somebody with dirty, oily hands used it recently. A mechanic. The last digit is the asterisk. It’s slightly damaged because people tend to hack onto it impatiently to get the door to open. So, five numbers plus asterisk, starting with a seven, and easy to remember. Come on, John, it’s not that difficult.”
“Has someone had a look at the fodder?” asked Sherlock, his eyes darting over the clipboard. “In both cases? If the toxins were indeed fed to the animals as seems likely based on the evidence we have, how easy would it have been to mix the respective plants into their fodder, do you reckon?”
John flips back the blanket and motions with his hand. “Why don’t you get in here and explain things to me to make sure I understand what you’ve drawn.”
“Yes, he has,” says Joan. “Thank you, sir. Let us know if you need our help. Billy here claimed the case was very important. Of national importance, even, he said.”
“It’s not important,” growled Sherlock. “I know what he wants, and I’ve told him very clearly that I’m not interested. I wish he’d simply take my word for it and let the matter rest.”
Sherlock gave him a long, grave look, then ducked his head and bit his lip, worrying his bottom one with his teeth. He swallowed, then raised his eyes to return John’s steady gaze. “I know,” he murmured. “And I appreciate your offer, I really do. But right now ...” He sighed and wriggling free of John, did flop onto his back, extending his arms stiffly along his sides. John thought he looked both exasperated at himself as well as strangely sad. “There is just so much going on in my head. So many new impressions, new data that needs to be catalogued and stored away. There is so much to think about, John, that I don’t believe I could ... I doubt I’d enjoy it, now. I’d be distracted. I’d be overwhelmed. I ...,” he let out a long breath. “I’m sorry, John. It’s not about you, you know that. I do want you, very much so. Just not … right now, I guess.”
“Yes, I’ve been there, many years ago,” says Sherlock quietly. He withdraws his phone from the inner pocket of his jacket and begins to snap photographs of the most recent pictures, particularly of the one showing Tiffany with her strange, impossible friend.
“Well, have it your way, Mister Show Off. I’ll find out eventually. You can order some drinks while I refill the bottles. Oh my god, what is that?”
Thanks a lot to all those who commented and left kudos on chapter 1. It means a lot. Chapter 2 is rather short, but chapter 3 is written and just lacks editing and an illustration, and thus should be up in the foreseeable future.
She looked at him, frowning. Sherlock detected the slightest hesitation. She was thinking of a convincing story. “I was at home, preparing to travel to Dartford the next day – yesterday.”
Sherlock opened his mouth and shut it again. He blinked. “Thanks for the warning,” he then managed, a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. “Do note that it is not my intention to die again any time soon. Also note that should you entertain the idea of deceasing before me, your final resting place will receive the same treatment.”
“Well, do you like it?” John’s tentative question breaks through his thoughts, and Sherlock becomes aware that he has been staring at the gift for some time. He feels strangely ... moved by it. It’s practical, but also a thoughtful present from someone who obviously took the trouble of considering what he might like.
Less than ten minutes later, the peloton arrives in Castelsarrasin to the cheers of the masses. There is a sprint for the remaining few points which is won by a Team Netflix rider. Bainbridge comes third but retains the green jersey. The other special jerseys stay with their riders as well: yellow with Moriarty, white with Lachapelle, the mountain-jersey with Baskerville. The combativity award goes to Camenzind for his spirited attack out of the breakaway group – a respectable reward for this hard work, even if the actual stage win was snatched from him by a jubilant Kit.
.” He almost spat out the word. “Most of them were idiots: manipulative, spoiled brats. I was glad to avoid them when I could.”
“He wouldn’t have won the stage. He is experienced and wily, but he’s no longer able to summon the high speeds and explosiveness necessary to beat men like Morstan or Bainbridge on the last stretch. And he knows it. Here, look at this.”
“Oh, it’s just round the corner, down Ivy Lane,” says the woman, Mrs. Cook. “You really can’t miss it. The village has become quite busy ever since the army moved into that house. Some soldiers are now stationed here round the clock, and there’s a number of young women billeted all over the place. Some are staying at our inn, too. Lovely ladies, and so hard working, although I haven’t got a clue what exactly they’re up to at Ivy Farm. Nobody ever tells us a thing,” she finishes somewhat disappointedly, giving John and Sherlock an expectant gaze as if hoping that they might illuminate her.
“There is a bruise here,” John presses slightly and Sherlock draws in a sharp breath at the stab of pain, “but nothing seems broken. You’ll have to move gently for a while, and not overdo the cycling. Every deep breath is likely going to hurt for a few weeks.” He rolls down the vest again.
John’s eyes widen, he swallows, then nods. His features harden and his entire posture changes as he switches into soldier mode, tense and alert, ready for battle. Sherlock is no stranger to fight and danger himself, nevertheless he is always grateful for John’s stalwart, competent presence at his side. John slides out of bed, reaches for his gun, then nods at Sherlock.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Just so you know, I loathe champagne. As for wine, it can be acceptable, but I don’t usually drink much alcohol, anyway.”
“We have an appointment with Commander Wilcox,” he says after telling the guards their names, and in John’s case, his naval and medical credentials. “We were meant to arrive earlier, but were delayed in London.”
“May I kiss you before we head out there?” enquires John softly. “I’ve been wanting to do this for ages, even before you jumped, and I’d hate to miss my chance yet again, should anything happen to us.”
Sherlock studies him calmly. “Basically, yes. Shoes are optional, though, as are proper clothes. I think I might order something for further expeditions and have it delivered to our next hotel. In a few days, we will even be sharing accommodation with one of the teams in question. Surveillance should be easier then.”
“I hope so,” says Sam darkly. “We don’t want a repeat of the prologue when he almost fainted afterwards.”
Sherlock whirls round to him and fixes him with a fierce gaze. John’s eyes widen as they take him in. For a brief moment, Sherlock wonders what he must look like, standing there in his vest and drawers, his hair a fluffy mess around his head, his eyes wild and his cheeks likely flushed with excitement. Despite his dishevelled appearance, however, John seems to appreciate the view.
Molly nods and just as she begins to talk, Anthea returns with the drinks which she serves quickly and efficiently, before settling down on a chair next to the commander’s desk and readying a notepad and pencil.
“It’s your house, of course, Mr. Suffield,” he says, trying to keep exasperation at the narrow-mindedness of people out of his voice. “If you insist, we can wait until my colleague Dr. Watson arrives with Miss Hooper so that she can confirm my story. Or we can wait for the police, although that may be hours yet, or even a day. However, every minute that passes in idleness may play into the hands of those responsible for Miss Wilson’s demise. You can accompany me if you want. Actually, I suggest you do. I won’t change anything. Likely I won’t even touch anything. A thorough look around usually suffices.”
John’s German being even more rusty than his French, he considered replying in English, but recalling the long conversation he’d once had with his then-girlfriend Jeanette (the ‘boring teacher’, as Sherlock had called her) about teaching foreign languages in primary school, he rather supposed that the girl’s command of English would not exceed counting to ten, naming her favourite colour and singing “Old MacDonald had a farm”.
“So what if it is (which isn’t true, because I know plenty people who love or at least like you)? Listen to me, you stupid git, I love you. And were circumstances different, I would love to raise my daughter with you. You are good with children, far better than you believe. Tiffany adores you. And so do I. So let go of his self-deprecating shit.”
John snuggles closer under the thin blanket, delighting in the feel of warm skin. He laughs softly. “Instead, you’re saddled with me now.”
Sherlock nods. He wants to have a look around before they go in, to get a feel for the area again, and to check all the entrances to the venue, particularly the stage door. He estimates it’s on Archer Street, which runs along the back of the theatre.
“I’ve ordered a new table,” Sherlock announced, blinking as well. John knew that his eyes were very sensitive to light. Sherlock pulled a face. “Should be here Tuesday. It has two drawers, too, which should come in handy for storing some of my science equipment.”
Sherlock almost drops his phone. Tiffany has appeared next to him without him noticing. He has withdrawn to a corner of the garden where a small gazebo is situated, surrounded by a border of thick lavender bushes.
For a few seconds, he simply lies there on his back, watching the front wheel spin idly against the cloud-dotted blue sky. A bird of prey is cycling there. John’s sunglasses are ... somewhere. Something is dangling in the region of his chin and making soft gargling noises. He lets go of the handlebars with one hand and fishes for it. It’s the earbud with has slipped out of his ear and become detached from his helmet-strap. Holding it up to his ear in a half-dazed state, “John, John Watson has just crashed. Slipped right off the road and down a bit of a slope. No, I can’t see him. The cameras have lost track of him. We haven’t got a car nearby. One of the motorcyclists has stopped and a neutral Tour car is on its way. John, John can you hear me? Are you okay?” It’s Sam’s voice, high with anxiety.
“I would, if I could move,” returned John, trying to shift slightly and failing. Despite his slender frame, Sherlock was surprisingly heavy. “I can’t reach properly with my left hand with you all sprawled over me and pinning it to my side, and I can’t turn to use my other arm.”
and a fashionable hat. Her crimson lipstick is visible even over the distance. Something is sparkling round her neck, some kind of necklace, apparently. Probably a gift from one of her many suitors.
“I don’t remember your exact words, but you invited me to visit you after the war to look through your books. And in that moment, I realised I really, really wanted that. That I wasn’t just infatuated with you because of your brains and your looks. I imagined us sharing a flat, reading those books together. You playing the violin or pickling toads in the kitchen, or whatever you do with your chemical experiments. I saw us solving cases together, running through London, sharing cabs, bothering Lestrade for information. That, and all those things other couples do. Domestic things. Bickering about tidying up the flat and who’s doing the washing up, and all those things.” He blushes. “Other couply things, too, if I’m honest. And I realised I wanted all of those, badly.”
According to what John hears via radio, Sherlock is doing well in the favourites’ group that has split from the peloton. He has Kit at his side to help him. Together with the other GC contenders they make it over Port de Balès despite several attempts by Magnussen, Wilkes and Ricoletti and their
John strides over to the group, introduces himself and states his medical credentials, at which the women look relieved and begin to explain about the children’s injuries.
Sherlock sniffed contemptuously. “The last time anybody called me ‘cute’ was over thirty years ago, the day we dropped off Mycroft at Harrow. The family of one of his obnoxious friends came up to us and the mother pinched my cheek and ruffled my hair and said I looked like a ‘cute little angel’. It was utterly humiliating.”
When the peloton reaches Angoulême and has about two kilometres to go, John falls in line to provide a train for Brainbridge for the impending sprint of the peloton. Even with the stage win already decided, there are still several sprint points to be gained. The sprint itself is chaotic with the riders narrowly avoiding another mass crash. It’s won by the ‘God of Thunder’ Søren Fantoft with Stephen Bainbridge coming second and Harry Lyons third, securing the green jersey on Bainbridge’s shoulders so that now, even if Jefferson Hope of Team Brook Consulting who is in second place in the points classification wins the final stage with all its intermediate sprints, he won’t win the points required to dethrone Stephen, who only has to make it through the time trial tomorrow and across the finish in Paris now. The mountain jersey is out of reach for Anderson, who is likely to clock in at third place – still a more than respectable achievement. The battle for the white jersey of the best rider under twenty-five years of age isn’t over yet, but it seems unlikely that anybody will manage to take it from Lachapelle now, considering that he is a decent time trialist – better, at least on paper, than his two closest competitors. Kit is ranked seventh in this classification now with the option of rising to sixth or even fifth with a good time trial, all in all a brilliant result for his first Tour.
“Are we supposed to be kissing?” asks Sherlock, leaning in to gaze over John’s shoulder. John catches a whiff of his hair-product and hopes Sherlock doesn’t notice the goose-bumps rising on his arms. “The lighting of the profiles is all wrong, as are the proportions. Not very convincing, the whole thing. Clearly a manipulation.”
“So you think this Riley had a hand in sabotaging your bikes?” he asks, arms folded in front of his chest. Sherlock’s radiant smile is wiped from his features as he faces his old flame. “Some evidence points that way, yes, but we need more to be certain. A chat with Kitty Riley would certainly be helpful.”
Sherlock laughs softly. He’s going to have to thank Mycroft for this one. Yet another favour he owes his big brother. Perhaps he’ll just let him have his slice of Christmas cake at their parents’ tomorrow to make amends. Obviously, Mycroft has had more to do with bringing John home than just providing him with Sherlock’s new address. Not telling his little brother about it and planning John’s surprise return as a Christmas gift just shows that deep down, Mycroft is as sentimental as the rest of the population, despite always claiming the opposite.
Mycroft raised an eyebrow but didn’t seem perturbed or offended by his brother’s terse tone. “Obviously, as you so imaginatively demonstrated. I won’t keep you long, but as I said, this is a matter of interest to both of you.”
“What do you mean?” Sherlock wants to know, until it dawns on him. “Oh. Well, I haven’t used it for ... that, obviously. Not sure I intend to, either. It seems to be rather ... unhygienic.”
“I know. And it might hurt a bit more when I examine it. But you’ve been very brave so far. Can you move it?”
“Your jumper. It used to be a man’s but you shortened the sleeves and altered the shoulders slightly to fit you. You also removed the epaulets. The stitching was done by hand and is slightly uneven, so it’s unlikely you bought the garment like this. You could of course be simply sharing with your partner, but the changes are irreversible. Ergo, your partner served in the navy but isn’t around any longer to wear his jumper.”
John sighed as he sat up. “Sherlock?” he asked softly, debating whether he should touch his friend’s shoulders in a soothing gesture but decided against it when Sherlock wrapped his arms round himself. “Sherlock, I’m sorry. I got carried away a little, I fear. I didn’t mean to scare you.”
John appears next to the bed, grinning down at him. “Would it be okay with you if we resumed last night’s activities for a bit?”
And what was more, John seemed grateful for his presence. In this moment, so important for John, he was relieved to have his best friend at his side. He raised his eyes from his daughter’s face and gazed at Sherlock, his expression full of wonder. Sherlock knew that the vow he had made at the wedding to always protect all three of them truly extended to the little one (although Mary’s status had become a bit more questionable). John smiled at him, beckoning him closer. Sherlock advanced, his heart pounding when John indicated he should hold out his arms. He did, hesitantly, anxious about what was to come. After all, who in their right mind would entrust Sherlock Holmes, self-proclaimed high-functioning sociopath, with a newborn? Well, John Watson, apparently.
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth not buried in the pillow twitched in a minute smile. His hand snuck out and came to rest on John’s side, squeezing it once. Then it relaxed when Sherlock drifted off entirely.
surrounds her, as well as an air of imperiousness. Even though she must be in her mid-seventies, she wears her shoulder-length hair open and fashionably coiffed in sharp waves. It looks dyed, too, to bring out the silver strands even more. Her make-up is tasteful yet with a hint of the dramatic, with carefully plucked eyebrows redrawn in bold curves, rouge making her sharp cheekbones stand out more, and dark red lipstick creating a striking contrast against her pale skin. She reminds Sherlock of the German actress Marlene Dietrich he saw in a mildly entertaining movie about stolen pearls a few years ago. To his surprise, thinking about the film, he now realises that he remembers the male lead in greater detail than the female, even though he was less interesting as a character. He was very handsome, though. He chances a quick glance at John, and feels the by now familiar acceleration of his heartbeat. Perhaps he’s always had certain proclivities, then. That actor
He has made remarks about John’s lack of dating efforts even before lockdown and quarantine. The truth is, ever since Mary’s disappearance and the subsequent dissolution of their marriage, John hasn’t even thought about taking up dating again. He is happy back at Baker Street with his Consulting Detective. Their life is almost back to how it was before the Fall, unless one counts those strange moments of tension, the stolen glances and light touches and the increased, infuriating closeness. If only John knew what to make of it ...
Once again a big thank you goes to the faithful readers of this story, to whom I apologise for the delay of this chapter. Due to RL interfering, the summer holidays didn’t leave me as much time for writing as I’d hoped. I’m also, as always, indebted to my wonderful beta rifleman_s.
John chuckles darkly. “Perhaps they only got the one, and you nicked it. And they can’t even go to the police, because what’d they say? ‘Please help us, somebody stole the very secret and highly illegal device we used for cheating during the Tour de France? And the
They gaze at each other and burst out laughing once more, until the distant toll of church bells causes them to sober up. “Three in the morning,” observes John. “Oh dear, perhaps we should try and catch some more sleep, especially you. How’s your head?”
“How long were you ill?” asks John quietly from where he stands. “When you really were, I mean. Pneumonia, wasn’t it?”
“They should choose the rock formation,” stated Sherlock after a thorough look at the six proposals. “It looks like one of the tors in Dartmoor.”
Sherlock nods, switching on the overhead light to aid John as he searches the foot space. When he comes up holding the phone, Sherlock starts the engine again and switches off the light. “Phone okay?”
“Yes. Excellent deduction. And if you ask me ‘why’, I’ll kick you. Yes, I find you attractive. And I don’t care if you’re a man, or taller than me, or a bloody pain in the arse most of the time, or that you’re a posh public school git who most likely prefers cricket to any decent sport, or that you take up far too much space of my mental harddrive. You’re the most important person in my life, and I don’t want to lose you again, to anything or anyone.”
For a while he just lay cocooned in the warmth of his bed, absently watching the sunny stripes distort the pattern of Mrs. Hudson’s 1970s style wallpaper. He relished the thought that he didn’t have to work this Sunday. Traffic up and down Baker Street was very moderate, and even down on busy Marylebone Road only a soft hum hinted at cars going to and fro. The wind was still strong, gusty blasts sighing outside the window and tearing at Speedy’s awning down below, but thankfully they weren’t of the same force as the ferocious St. Jude storm last Monday. The flat was quiet apart from a soft gurgling in the pipes. Apparently the heating was struggling again. They really needed someone to have a look at it before winter arrived, particularly if that turned out to be as cold and snowy as the last.
Heaving another sigh, John peels himself out of bed. “All right. And Sherlock” – the other looks up from where he’s begun to rummage in his bag – “thanks.”
John could not find anything on the body, either, so he moved on to the woman’s belongings, too. He examined the clothes, looking particularly for animal hairs as a common source for allergens, although he thought it unlikely that the woman had never noticed if she had reacted to pets. Apart from her clothes and shoes, there was only a pair of sunglasses, a used tissue and a labello stick. John picked it up and opened it. It looked new, barely used. It smelled nice, though, particularly in this morgue with its reek of death and disinfectant. ‘Milk and Honey’, it said on the side.
Anderson is not the only one with a less than ideal day. Bernard, the current bearer of the jersey, is affected as well. He crashed on the descent from Col de la Pierre Saint-Martin (but without injuring himself badly) and suffered a defect shortly before the ascent to Marie-Blanque, meaning the polka-dot jersey is going to get a new owner yet to be determined.
The room is beautiful, with visible dark beams in the whitewashed ceiling, smooth flagstone floors, and tasteful modern furnishings, one of which is a double bed. John stands and stares at its white coverlets and subtly patterned pillows for a while, his mind too tired to process the information his eyes are providing, and even less the repercussions of sharing such close quarters with Sherlock. It’s not unusual to share doubles with roommates during races. John has done it before plenty of times. Still, sharing with Sherlock feels ... special, somehow. Sherlock’s violin case lies on one pillow, his luggage and clothes are spread about the room. He has claimed the right side of the bed. John’s luggage has been brought up, too, occupying the floor next to a small table and one of the dark wooden chairs.
Sally’s eyes widen, and she smiles slightly. “Not bad, but of course Molly could have told you that.”
Sherlock nods. “I’m really tired,” he says, which is only partly true. He longs to withdraw to the solitude of his room and lock the door behind him. Enduring two more hours of hateful company while being bored by a film doesn’t sound like a good way to spend the evening.
Sherlock doesn’t hesitate any longer and lowers himself completely down into the shaft. His feet hit water, deep enough to seep into his shoes. The ground is uneven because rubble as accumulated there. But the shaft isn’t deep. Sherlock’s shoulders are about level with the floor above, meaning he’ll manage to pull himself out again. For now, however, he ducks, pressing himself against the wall nearest the staircase.
Which indeed he has. Almost every table surface in the living room is covered with baking trays. There’s also baking paper resting on plates and all of their wooden chopping boards. All of them are adorned with different shapes and sizes of gingerbread. Some appear to be labelled with small paper cards, all contain writing in icing sugar – mostly letters and numbers which weirdly (or not weirdly for Sherlock) appear to be chemical and even structural formulas. The smell is overwhelming and very, very nice. John stomach growls.
Sherlock eats some more chips, thinking. The last time he tried to tell what happened, his explanations were met with scepticism and disbelief. He was told to grow up, to overcome his childish imaginings. Nobody took him seriously, even those he trusted most. But this is John ...
. Wilkes is in this group as well, obviously still impeded by his injuries. They are less than ten seconds behind Moriarty’s group and expected to catch up again with it during the descent
“Ah, yes, I forgot. You’re not like us other idiots. That magnificent brain of yours is only entertaining itself with pure thoughts far above the dirty cravings of us mundane creatures. Composing music when wanking, that kind of thing.”
There’s a scraping sound of something heavy being dragged across the floor, followed by a thud when it hits the door. Sherlock sighs. So much for trying to escape on his own. It would have been easy to open the bolts and then simply push open the doors despite them being locked. Apparently he is well and truly stuck in here. Ah well, could be worse. The only thing he rues slightly is the lost opportunity to go and explore the countryside. There is a hill near the village that looked promising on the drive to his cousins’ house. He recalls wanting to go there the last time he was here and had to endure birthday celebrations, but the weather was bad that day, and then he had the accident, and they had to drive to A&E.
Sherlock is, in fact. Very few people know that he absolutely loves dancing, and that he is quite adept at it. He was one of the few boys who actually enjoyed the lessons at school, even though he was careful never to disclose this to the others. He didn’t want to provide them with even more ammunition to harass him. But yes, he loved it, moving to the music, getting lost in the sensation. Sometimes when he plays his violin, he begins to sway and even dance to the music when it really grips him. These are some of the few occasions when he feels his ever active, ever running mind at rest. His body takes over, either his fingers or his legs, or both, along with the rest of his limbs, and he is at peace, not having to think but allowing himself to feel for as long as the piece lasts.
“Well, at least I’m not scared of acting on whatever sexuality I have, unlike others who get frightened by the smallest of touches and either retreat or lash out.”
“Yes, please, dress Dr. Watson first,” says Sherlock. John raises an eyebrow at him, and Sherlock hides a grin, before sitting back to watch John being outfitted in a plain navy three-piece suit. The colour accentuates his eyes, and the jacket, a single-breasted design with fashionable, slightly pointed lapels fits him perfectly. Sherlock commends himself on estimating his measurements so precisely. The trousers are a little too long, and Mr. Norton hands them over to his assistant to alter the hems accordingly. John suggests wearing his old braces (despite some blood-stains on one), but Sherlock insists on getting him new ones, also choosing a silk tie with a geometric pattern of black, grey and gold to go with the suit.
They walk in silence for a while, dodging other pedestrians on the pavement. To distract himself from his companion, Sherlock takes stock of the damage that has been wrought since last he passed down this street. University College has sustained considerable damage, it seems, like many of its neighbouring buildings. The Great Hall looks as if it has taken a direct hit and has been mostly reduced to a pile of rubble. Not much teaching going on there now, anyway, with most of the students and many of the professors busy with the war effort. Or dead. Considering the fact that so many British men are in actual danger of getting shot or blown up, Sherlock and his fellow codebreakers truly have an easy time in Bletchley.
Hensley and the others stared at him with the usual expressions of those encountering Sherlock Holmes’ brilliance and rapid fire deductions for the first time. Katie was the first to overcome her awe. “What do you need, doctor?” she asked, taking off her jacket and rolling up the sleeves of her jumper.
“You upped my game on countless cases,” comes the immediate reply. “You improve my thinking, are brilliant in channelling my thoughts, leading them in the right direction when I can’t see it for myself. Your questions and remarks help me see connections that eluded me before. You provide a moral compass I ... well, I don’t exactly lack it, but I don’t see the necessity to heed it most of the time. But most of all, John, you make me want to be human. You make me want to care about people and not shut them out. You’re the first person I actually want to be involved with romantically, even sexually, perhaps. The matter is still up for debate, but the jury appears to be increasingly swaying towards a favourable verdict. I won’t say you complete me, because that’s a lot of sentimental nonsense. But you do fill some of the glaring gaps I have. Without you, I wouldn’t be here. Without you, I wouldn’t
“Not there, perhaps, but for your detective work, surely a general knowledge of contemporary literature would be helpful. Do you ever read for pleasure?”
John suspected that the true reason for Sherlock’s surprising volunteering to acquire dinner was that the movie and the subsequent talk had hit a little too close to home. Sherlock needed a private stroll through fresh air to sort through his feelings or memories or whatever else the day had evoked so far. John was more than willing to give him some alone time, feeling that he could do with some as well.
He nods towards Watson’s right leg. “There is nothing physically wrong with it, despite it still lacking the musculature it used to have. Your limp is psychosomatic. It’s really bad when you walk, particularly when you’re stressed or upset about something, for example the entire situation here. You don’t want to be at Bletchley, you’d prefer to be back at sea, or at least to work in a field hospital, anywhere where you feel your skills as a doctor are being appreciated. Then again it is likely your career as a surgeon is over. You have an intermittent tremor in your dominant hand, it showed clearly when you were forced to relate the account of your heroic deed, and I felt it when we shook hands. All of this indicates you are traumatised by the events that ultimately brought you here. That’s why you don’t wear your medal, either. It’s almost like you’re ashamed you got one and live to wear it, while your perished friends and companions only received the honours posthumously.”
