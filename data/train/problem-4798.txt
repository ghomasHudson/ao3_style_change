“Well, we’ve got stuff to do for the benefit show, especially if we have to find a replacement for you and Dean.”
In his pain and anger in the aftermath of what happened, he attacked his own son.
An hour later found them all giggling like teenage girls at their first boy-girl party. Gabriel was still in Sam’s lap, his tongue down his human’s throat and both of their hands searching for skin. At some point Cas crawled into Dean’s lap, and was now whispering dirty poetry into Dean’s ear, making the man blush and grind his hips up.
languages:
He forced himself not to be overwhelmed, but to take what Cas was feeling and soothe it. He focused on warming the cold spots and cooling the hot spots, painting over the angry reds and blacks with white light to soften the edges, pushing his own feelings of love and loss and guilt at his own choices leading to this disaster and forgiveness of what Castiel deemed his own fault. He wrapped Cas’ pain with his own, not taking it from him but letting him know he wasn’t alone, would never be alone. And the angel fell into his arms, releasing his own tears as the two men sank to the floor and held onto each other for dear life.
Cas took the folder from Dean and opened it to look at the first page. His head tilted to one side as he looked over it briefly, then he set the folder under his chair. “Thank you, Dean. Perhaps we can discuss this further after rehearsal, maybe over dinner?”
The entire room was awkwardly silent for a minute before Dean cleared his throat. “Going somewhere MJ?” he asked in his best ‘dad’ voice.

started, Dean nodded his head to the music for a few measures before joining in, pounding out the beat. His attack on the drumset was brutal, but it gave him a better outlet for his anger than grabbing the bottle of Johnnie Walker Black he had sitting in the kitchen. He was so for that for the weekend, but no way was he gonna give Cas the satisfaction of showing up at practice tomorrow with a screaming hangover.
with that conceited asshole!” Dean yelled. Sammy bodily stopped him from stomping off.
"I don't think so. I think the age difference will throw them off, no one knows they're from the future. But that doesn't matter, they're still Nephilim, and it's brought the Grigori out of hiding."
Dean took Cas’ hand, then pulled him close. “Not yet, you haven’t,” he said with a smirk, then kissed Cas hard.
Sam smiled down at his angel and said softly, “thank you for today, it was amazing.”
He got home after rehearsals Friday evening and, as always, set his mom’s cello next to his electric one. Sam wasn’t giving any lessons that afternoon, but he was scribbling away putting the finishing touches on his arrangement of
gonna happen,” Gabriel replied, making Sam groan.
Cas chuckled. “I don’t see what good that would do,” he said, “but if it makes you feel better, I’ll hold him down for you.” Dean laughed at that and turned to kiss his angel on the cheek.
Sam was surprised they had any kind of friends in the future, let alone family friends. That would imply these people would know they bonded with angels. Angels in male vessels. And they were cool with it. "Like who?"
“Yeah, I know. Have you made any more progress on how we’re gonna handle things in our own time?” She put the picture back in her pocket as Bobby sat down next to her with his trusty tablet.
didn't want to think about,
!” Immediately, the hand Dean was reaching back to his scalp to scratch froze, his entire body immobilized.
Before Dean could beat a hasty retreat, Castiel appeared right in front of him, his persistent disregard for personal space blocking Dean's escape.
“No, it’s for our chair challenge after rehearsal,” Cas replied.
“But if we change anything about their timeline, will they remember that, or will they remember what they went through the first time?” Sam asked.
Gabriel wrapped one arm around Sam’s waist then snapped his fingers, taking them to their room.
“I know,” Gabriel all but whined. “But you gotta admit, it’s smokin’ hot, and I was just trying to get Cassie into trying it.”
"I'm guessing whatever's been messing with us pulled his wings out," Sam said. "There's a lot of wing kink in the online fanfiction."
Cas was still tense, but Dean was awarded another one of those awesome smiles. Dean stood and offered him a hand to help him up. Cas took his hand and ended up standing very, very close to Dean, just looking into his eyes, trying to school his features.
"The bad fish taco was just for shits and giggles," Gabriel said, another gumdrop sailing into his mouth. "Nothing like playing to urban legends."
"How the hell..." Dean wondered, his gaze following Cas.
MJ laughed again. "I know better than to make a deal with a demon off the cuff, especially you. Call with some leads," she said waving the phone at him, "and then we'll talk."
"Everyone agreed that if they were going to help care for Samuel that he should have his own room, so as not to disturb us," Cas told him. "I know you value your personal space, but since I spend more time in your room than mine I have moved my things into your room. I hope that does not bother you." Cas looked calm as ever, but Dean could feel he was worried about his reaction. Dean was actually just surprised he hadn't thought of that sooner.
"Kevin," Dean said, pushing MJ towards him, "get my mom and the kids to a defensible room and have MJ lock it down with sigils."
Deanna grinned bashfully. "What can I say? I'm weird."
“Oh, you know
when Gabriel and Bobby popped in. Sam was relieved to see his eyes were back to normal at this point.
“And you should have done it somewhere your dads couldn’t find you,” Lucifer interjected.
"You gotta get me a list of those," Dean laughed. "You know, just for comparison."
want an adventure, but was this what he had in mind?.
When Castiel walked into the living room, he found Dean idly flipping through potential shows to watch on Netflix, nothing really catching his attention. He’d seemed despondent for days now, restless and a bit sad at the same time, yet trying to not show it.
“Sam!” Gabriel said, grabbing a discarded shirt and wiping away the slickness between his legs. Sam rolled to his back and looked up at his angel. “We need to stop,” he said as he pulled on a pair of boxers, some Grateful Dead tie-dye lounge pants, and a clean white undershirt. “Go take a shower and get some real food.” Gabriel gave him a hard glare as he very humanly stumbled out of the room and shut the door firmly behind him.
is proportional to your height," Cas stated.
"This is a sacred space," Castiel said quietly, yet loud enough for all to hear.
Bobby scoffed, smirking. “Look who my parents are.”
The opening act was a Kansas cover band. Dean sang along with every song, Cas joining in on the chorus of
Really?!?"
This time, it was Cas that pulled back, looking like a spooked animal.
“Sam’ll do the arrangements,” Dean said, grinning. “He said he had some great ideas, and he’s already started putting them on paper. We should have something to work with next week, maybe the week after, depending on how many lessons he has coming up.”
“Don’t borrow trouble, sweetheart,” Mary told her. “We still have enough on our plates.”
Sam nodded. “I think I could swing it, but we need a backup plan, just in case.”
“What’s up Dad? You look bummed out. No plans for tonight?”
“Uh huh,” Gabriel hummed. “And you’re doing this just because, not to impress anyone or anything.”
Gabriel took Sam's hand and said, "I'm the lucky bastard. Awesome, isn't it?" Gabriel smiled so wide that Sam's heart did a little flip-flop. To Kevin's credit, it didn't seem to bother him in the slightest.
“Yeah, it kind of does, but it’s still frustrating. I mean, I’d like to know how the hell you and I end up bonded. Hell, I think I’d settle for knowing what that actually means.”
Gabriel blinked once, then laughed. If it were possible, Sam would have turned even more red. “Is that all?” Gabriel asked. “Kiddo, I’m not gonna stop you from going out and finding yourself someone when you have an itch to scratch, but I’m hoping you won’t want to when you’ll have me willing and waiting at home.”
wanted.
“My trusty handmaiden hasn’t been gossiping? That’s a first!” Now Charlie was standing as if she were royalty, addressing her subjects. It made Castiel even more curious.
Sam tried to give him a bitchface, but found that he couldn’t. He was too happy that the kids were finally safe, his whole little family was safe and happy, and that his son was celebrating another birthday. “Whatever, jerk.”
“I got him!” Sam said, grabbing Cas’ shoulder and pushing the image into the angel’s mind. Castiel grabbed Dean with his other hand and they were gone in an instant.
He pulled on Gabriel’s grace tentatively at first, not wanting to take too much, but found he was able to control himself much more if he pushed a matching amount of his soul into Gabriel to hold onto, as if balancing each other out.
Gabriel withdrew so much that, even though Sam knew he didn’t sleep, he wasn’t coming to their bed anymore to lay with Sam as he slept. They would talk during the day, but not like they used to. And their intimacy was almost nil, relegated to a few comforting hugs to assure Sam that Gabriel was okay. Sam missed the closeness he was developing with his angel and was unsure how to fix it, if it could be fixed.
“What happened, Dean?” Sam asked calmly, trying to keep the peace.
He and Dean hadn’t even progressed any further than those touches. He had assumed with Dean’s “player” reputation that the man would push for another round, but he simply cleaned him up, fed him, and chatted with him. It was very pleasant, but it was completely contrary to what he had previously thought about Dean. Had he missed something before while his head was lost in his work?
Cas stopped in front of Dean and crossed his arms over his chest, frowning. “Are you telling me that when you watch movies that contain elements you have knowledge about, that you don’t get irritated when it’s incorrect?”
the point, Dad?" MJ asked. "I did the job and I did it well."
“Take what you can get,” Dean responded, still looking off into the trees. “We don’t get much happy in our life, nature of the beast. But somehow we found a little. Hold onto that, and then whenever you get that little feeling inside you that tells you that you gotta do something, then chase it. For me, I’m good until I get the itch that something’s gotta be done about the shit no one else will deal with. For you? I’d say just do what you always do, and listen for whatever it was that drew you to that girl’s prayers. It’s not perfect, but it’s what you can do without destroying yourself or your family.”
“You ready to play?” he asked Cas with a grin, taking a seat with his electric cello. He sat there and waited, bow in the ready position, as Cas tried to orient himself. Dean smiled patiently and watched as Cas removed his trench coat and blazer, unpack his sheet music, unpack his cello, and settle in. When he looked at Dean, Dean just cocked an eyebrow at him in an ‘are you ready yet?’ manner.
He turned to Dean. “When you saw how well MJ fought, how strong she was, how she kept a level head, you allowed her to hunt with you and Uncle Cas. Hunting people, saving things, the family business. She was ecstatic, because all she ever wanted was to be like you.” Dean’s ego went through the roof at that. “She saved your butt on more than one occasion because you were too lazy to do your research or you rushed in with a ‘kill them all, let God sort them out’ attitude.” And there went Dean’s pride, right down the drain.
“It wasn’t witches,” Dean told Sam when he called a couple hours later.
Castiel pulled his pants up and tucked himself in, fumbling with the button as he fastened them up and tucked his shirt back in. “It has been a while for me, so my stamina was not up to par, either.”
Both men startled at the sound, Gabe pretty much falling off of Sam and landing on the floor with a thud. They tried to stifle their drunken giggling, but they were just too amused at themselves. They laughed so hard Sam almost couldn’t get Gabe up off the floor. Dean just shook his head at the pair.
* * * * *
Sam just looked from his son to Gabriel and back again, mouth agape. He planted his hands on his hips and stared down Gabriel and shouted, “what the Hell kind of parent are you that our son treats you like this?”
ideas on taking the rest of them out quickly. And I mean solid,” he said, eyeballing Bobby and MJ, “no half-assed brain-droppings.” The kids nodded.
Three Winchesters against a full coven of Witches at the height of their power was not what Dean considered a milk run. He had hoped it had just been a bunch of New Age Wiccans getting together for the holidays, but it had been a real, honest-to-goodness coven of thirteen witches trying to summon the Green Man himself. Being figured out for who and what they were shortly after rolling into Salem didn’t help matters much, either, but in the end they put a stop to the shenanigans before anything was summoned or any damage was really done. They couldn’t do anything about the abnormal weather patterns, but they did stay an extra day to help board up windows at the motel they had stayed at, all the glass broken by flying debris from the freak wind gusts.
Dean was cranky. He loved baby Sammy to death, but he had never realized how exhausting newborns could be. It seemed like all Sammy did was eat, shit, fuss, and sleep. He tried to sleep when Sammy slept, but the longest he'd sleep in one stretch was about four hours. He'd fall into bed next to Cas and barely start kissing him when he passed out from exhaustion. He hadn't been on a hunt in weeks, sending MJ with Sam on salt and burns and Gabriel going with his brother for anything more dangerous. He knew he didn't have to try to take care of Sammy by himself, but it's how he was wired; it was all he knew how to do.
Dean stood up from where he sat, slammed his hands on the table and cried, "this is bullshit!" Everyone looked up at him, startled but not surprised by his outrage. "What the hell are we doing? Huh? We can research all we want but we're still just guessing here. We need real answers, and we're not going to find them here." He picked up the book that was sitting in front of him and stomped off, the slamming of his bedroom door echoing down the hall.
“So yeah, if God could let something like that happen, then I don’t think I’d want his kind of help, you know?”
Without a change in his expression, Cas began to play. At the first few notes, Dean recognized the song and was assailed by memories of his mom feeding baby Sammy while he laid his head in her lap. Sam was a colicky baby, and his mom swore that singing to him while he ate made him feel better. As Cas continued to play, Dean could hear his mom singing in his head.
“We did the angel thing, we bonded, but even if I’m not gonna get old or die or anything because of that, I’m still human. And humans do things differently.” Still palming the box, he flipped the lid open with his thumb before showing Castiel the ring inside, angel wings etched into the simple silver band. “I know that because you’re an angel we can’t legally get married or anything like that, but I love you, and I want everyone to know you’re my husband.”
“Pops…” Bobby warned. “Be careful what you say, I kind of like being alive. You piss off Dad enough, we could both cease to exist.” Bobby turned to Sam and Dean. “Basically, you bond with them by them sharing their grace with you and you sharing some of your soul with them. That’s all you need to know right now.” He crossed his arms over his chest and leveled a bitchface at Gabriel that dared him to say more.
Dean sat the spatula down on the counter and backed away from the stove with his hands up in surrender, making Cas laugh. He picked up Cas’ Tupperware container of beige stuff and asked, “what’s this stuff?” as he opened it and took a whiff. Whatever it was smelled pretty tasty.
, bopping her head in time with the song. He was about to tear her a new one for her poor choice in music when he leaned back just enough to see Cas’ head bobbing in time with the music as well.
Sam laughed at that, then asked “did you ever think we would bond? I mean, before the kids showed up?”
… It was something to talk to Gabe about, seeing if they could do it in smaller doses. That wasn’t a feeling he wanted to lose.
With a smile, Dean said, “Yeah, I think we could do that.”
"There is no such thing," Cas said thoughtfully, eyeing the blade in Bobby's hand.
"Okay angel, here we go." Dean removed his fingers from Cas' now open hole and placed his hand on his hip to steady him. He stroked himself a few times, slicking himself with his precome before he lined the head up and pressed forward slowly. Dean couldn't believe how tight this was, and he probably would've stopped already if Cas weren't squirming and making whining noises. When the head of his dick slid in with a slight pop, Cas' back arched and he cried out a soft "oh!"
"I believe I ingested a small amount," Castiel said in his normal monotone voice. However, he seemed to be fidgeting where he stood.
, one of Dean’s favorite songs. Dean grinned and joined in. One by one, people gravitated towards them, watching in awe as they rocked out on the classical instruments. Money started filling that ridiculous hat.
Dean let his head fall against the car. He let out a sharp laugh. “We made an angel, Cas,” he said disbelievingly. “How the hell did we manage that?”
MJ, looking despondent, shrugged one shoulder and held out the copy of

him, then visibly relaxed. He looked at one Dean, then the other before saying, "we have a son."
“Drive down where?” Sam asked skeptically.
He decided to walk back to the bunker instead of his usual popping in, gave him time to figure out what he was doing. When he got to the library and saw Sam sitting at a table surrounded by books, eyebrows drawn as his mouth moved silently along with the words on the page, he wondered why he worried. This was his Samshine, after all.
Castiel pulled his cello back out and, without even reapplying rosin to his bow, began to play.
Castiel grinned wildly as he and Dean completed their set for the MADD benefit at The Speakeasy. While the lineup included many talented musicians and DJs, Gabriel had touted them as top billing, both being First Chair for the Kansas City Orchestra.
Claire just shook it off. “Nah, hunting is much easier with angel mojo behind it. I can just zap the bastards instead of memorizing spells.”
They were silent for a while longer, Lucifer processing the information. Yeah, he was a heartless bastard, but Gabriel was still his little brother, and the thought of anyone doing something like that to him cut him to the core. He reached one hand out through the bars, taking MJ’s hand.
MJ sighed at Lucifer’s attitude. “Yeah, I’m done. He’s not gonna listen, either.” She stood up and walked up to her cousin and hugged him.

Cas tilted his head in confusion. He turned to see what the Winchesters were staring at and was greeted with the sight of his own wings materialized on their plane of existence. There was still plenty of damage to be seen on them, but they were recovering nicely. Still, if there was ever a time for the Winchesters to see his wings, Castiel would not have picked this moment. Patchy spots of new growth were interspersed with his existing feathers and bald spots from where they were yanked out at the root during the Fall. Some laid down neatly in place, while others were sticking out at odd angles.
. The physical sensations of Gabriel’s warm passage pulled him to the edge, but the feedback loop of Gabriel’s emotions got him off. Sam was flooded with friendship, companionship, love, loyalty, devotion, safety, possession, and
“That is very fortunate, I wish more of your hunts were that simple.”
"Like I said, he's hopping from vessel to vessel, I can't get a bead on him. If you could have your network of demons keeping an eye out for him, I could get to him before he changes his meat suit and gets away from me again. Your resources, my skills-it's a win/win situation."
Castiel stood back, watching Dean. He had heard both sides of the conversation, hearing Anna, Lady Antonia Bevell’s… housekeeper?... tell Dean that shortly after dawn in England, Lady Toni and a couple of hunters from Cardiff engaged one of the Grigori at
Cas stood up then and headed towards the door. "I believe it would be best if you got some rest as well," he told Dean. "It is my understanding that newborns do not sleep through the night, and Samuel will need to be attended to in a few hours. I will retrieve my nightclothes and return shortly."
“Get on with what?” Lucifer asked cockily. “You want to have your say too? You want to tell me how much you hate me because your dad is my true vessel, the only one I won’t wear out? You want to have an emo moment of your own?”
Gabriel sighed. “It has come to my attention that I have been a dick lately.” Sam laughed, and Gabriel backed up, hands in front in a sign of surrender. “No, just hear me out. I love you, Sam, and I am in no way sorry for saving your life, but what I am sorry for marking you like that. I wasn’t thinking about anything but keeping you here with me. No thoughts of if you wanted it or not.” Gabriel placed his hands back on Sam’s hips, but not pulling him close, not yet. He exhaled. “Sam, you need to know I wouldn’t do anything to you that you didn’t want, definitely not without your consent.”
“Castiel,” she replied curtly, arms crossed over her chest.
Cas handed Sammy to Gabriel and went to Dean. He shook him by the shoulders but he still didn’t respond. “Dean!” he said quietly, but with the force of his true voice underneath it. Dean blinked once. Twice. Then stared Castiel in the eyes. “I made an angel, Cas,” he said, right before passing out.
“Oh, so there’s something there?” Sam asked innocently, enjoying riling up his big brother. He looked over towards them, MJ cradling Sammy while Kevin played with the baby’s toes and smiling at MJ. “Nothing wrong with that, they’re cute together.”
"NO!" "NOPE!" Sam and Gabriel said simultaneously, and just a little too quickly. "How about you guys?" Sam asked. "You run into any problems?"
Dean and Cas, still red and wet-faced, came running down the hall at the commotion. Dean tried pulling him off of Bobby, but Sam was feral.
“What are you up to Gabe?” Sam asked, bitchface on the horizon.
They had reservations for the best seat at Blue Fin in Times Square on a night when the executive chef was actually there preparing the meals himself. Kevin still looked nervous, but not nearly as so as when he was facing down Dean Winchester. This was more of a cute,
Dean squeezed his hand before raising it to his lips and kissing his angel’s knuckles. He appeared more relaxed, but Cas didn’t miss that the knuckles on Dean’s hand were still white where he gripped the steering wheel.
Gabriel just waggled his eyebrows at him and said, “ah, but I’m your ham, gorgeous,” before giving Sam a quick turn and a dip before pulling him back into the rhythm of the music.
With a snap of Gabriel's fingers, all of Dean's clothes were gone and his arms pulled tight behind his back. Dean tried to struggle, but couldn't move. His mouth opened and closed, but no sound came out. He looked almost frantic. Gabriel snapped his fingers, and words came pouring out of Dean's mouth.
Dean smirked. Yeah, he timed his shower to get the best reaction outta Cas. Fucker sat there all day at practice looking adorable as he concentrated on his sheet music and his playing, Dean just wanted to sit on his lap and muss him up.
“Sure, I get it,” Dean said with a grin. “Just let me know when you’re up for some
The sounds of skin on skin were soon drowned out by the crescendos of the angels' moans and cries. Castiel and Gabriel took everything the Winchesters gave them. Neither Sam nor Dean were quiet, either, thoroughly enjoying fucking into their angels' hot bodies. Dean grasped Cas' hips and started pulling him into each thrust, desperate to make Cas come before he lost his own battle. Another few thrusts and Cas' head snapped back as he came, yelling loud enough to rattle the glass in the room.
As Dean rocked his hips, he pushed Cas step by step backwards towards the bed, pushing him down to lay underneath him, legs spread to accommodate Dean between them. Dean looked down to see their erections side by side, Cas' leaking a significant amount of precome. He wrapped his hand around Cas' cock and ran his thumb through the wetness at the tip, causing Cas to arch his back and let out a feral groan. Dean coated his hand with their precome and wrapped his hand around both of their cocks. Looking Cas in the eyes, he began to stroke them together. They both shuddered as Dean squeezed on the upstroke, Cas making the most beautiful pornographic sounds Dean had ever heard. He had hoped to draw this out, enjoy his angel, but Cas felt too damned good and was so goddamned beautiful like this. He bent over to kiss Cas, both their kisses and his strokes becoming more demanding until all they could do was pant and moan into each other's mouths.
want to get out of bed, despite being there for almost a week now. Since they completed the bond, he could feel everything Gabriel felt and Gabriel could feel everything Sam felt until it became one giant feedback loop of ecstasy. He couldn’t comprehend how Dean and Cas hadn’t locked themselves in their rooms for days like this, if they had the same experience.
“The hell was that for, bitch?” Dean grumbled.
“Get enough rest, gorgeous?” Gabriel asked as he turned Sam around to rinse the suds from his hair.
have some of my favorite actors standing in my apartment?" she said a little more confidently. She crossed her arms over her chest and cocked a hip out, giving Dean a skeptical look. "Shouldn't you be at home with Danneel? The woman just had twins; if it were me you'd be elbows-deep in dirty diapers with me."
They were in a small, cluttered apartment. To the left was a large television with multiple game consoles hooked up, games left out around the front of it. The wall to the right was covered in framed photos; they all held the same five people, but no one picture had all five of them in one shot. One had a woman with two small children standing together in red Star Trek uniforms. Another had three children together, and still another had two, showing the children when they were very young. One picture had the woman with the two smaller children and a very tall young man hugging in a restaurant. Then there were numerous pictures of the woman with various actors, mainly from Star Trek, but one that stood out had the woman standing next to a man who
"Perhaps I am a bit envious of their physical intimacy," Cas whispered, not looking Dean in the eyes. "Although I do not require it to be content with our bond."
looked like Gabriel.
“Ancestors are not fair game. You can’t have a time-travelling demon go back to before the deal was made and kill off any Winchesters. That affects future generations of Winchesters, which are off-limits.”
“Leave her alone for now,” Gabriel warned him. “She’s embarrassed, angry, and upset. You go after her now, who knows what she’ll do.” Sam nodded in agreement, and Castiel just snarled at him. “She’s still in the bunker, so just leave her be, okay?”
“Are they back yet?” he asked excitedly. He no longer feared Dean or Castiel; he had grown more confident in himself and his abilities over the years, and they all held a lot of respect for each other.
“I dunno, Cas,” Dean said, bouncing baby Sammy in his arms. “I was able to save this little guy. Maybe Sam and Gabe’s kid is a part of what fixes the future for MJ and Bobby.”
* * * * *
Gabriel let go of Sam and walked over to Bobby. He pretended to check his eyes, nose, and throat before giving a diagnosis of “teenage angst.”
MJ got an evil look on her face. She looked right at Dean and said “
“Not a bad idea,” Dean said, “but can we eat first?”
His mother rushed around the table and tried to pry their hands apart. “Stop that, Castiel!” she ground out just loud enough so that no one else would hear. “You’re going to embarrass me as well as yourself!”
As Cas left the room, MJ threw her arms around his neck and cried into his shoulder.
Gabriel leaned into the kiss, hands on Sam’s hips, accepting everything Sam was offering him-that unconditional love and unfailing loyalty that he had missed for millennia. It warmed his heart, it warmed his grace, it warmed his…
“That too.”
“What’s going on Cas?” Dean asked him, sidling back up to his angel’s side. “Something happen you wanna tell me about?”
“Bobby?” Sam asked his brother. “With the baby,” he replied, and Sam nodded.
*  *  *  *  *
Sam let out a low whistle. He looked over to Gabriel and said "thank you so much for giving me a son instead of a daughter." Gabriel laughed and replied "my pleasure, Samsquatch." Dean gave them both an evil glare, and they both just laughed harder.
Dean had to cover his mouth to keep from laughing at the picture of Cas and MJ in matching suits and trench coats, his daughter's hair cut in a short pixie cut and tousled to look like Cas'.
Sam chuckled. “I know, just checking.” He gave Gabriel another quick kiss. “You ready for this?”
"So, we're in agreement about meeting with Crowley?" MJ asked her dads and uncles.
When Dean didn’t stop scratching half an hour later, his scalp raw and burning, MJ felt really, really bad about doing that to her dad. She insisted they stop and see if anyone could help them find a counter-curse to get the itch to stop. She grabbed the jar and her dad’s hand and drug him to the library.
glad I wasn’t there for that conversation,” Bobby admitted to MJ. “I wouldn’t have been able to keep from making jokes.”
Gabriel waggled his eyebrows. “Of course!” He snapped his fingers, and a Twister box appeared. “This is probably one of the most ingenious human inventions ever. You basically just pile on top of each other without trying to fall down. It’s more fun if you’re drunk, and way better if you’re naked,” he said with a wink.
Lucifer’s interest was piqued. “Oh? What happened to my brother?”
“Cypress from Israel,” Gabriel replied. “It’ll hold spellwork better than other wood. Figured we’d reinforce the doorframe with it and we can add some protection spells to it."
Tagging for birthday sex,
“Hey, hey! None of that in my house!” Dean called out to the Scribe, trying to stifle a laugh. “Say goodnight, Gracie.”
Gabriel rocked back and forth on his heels, hands behind his back, looking like innocence personified. “Have you tried praying to him?”
. His brother tried to convince him it was far superior to
“I’m gonna do a very chick-flick-y kinda thing, so you gotta let me get through this before you say anything,” Dean said with a woosh of the breath he was holding. “Also, just so you know, it’s really me, so don’t try to exorcise anything out of me, okay?”
The kids were packed and ready to go. Dean had picked up an old Army surplus duffel bag to pack as much of baby Sammy’s stuff in as he could. MJ and Bobby had their own backpacks packed and ready, which were currently on the floor. As Sam and Bobby worked on the spell together, Dean and Castiel spent the last few moments they could with their children. They were huddled together in a group hug, holding onto each other and whispering how much their dads would miss them and making MJ promise to look out for Sammy.
That surprised Dean. Cas had given them the whole 'angels don't have a gender' speech before, but his vessel was male. Surely he couldn't enjoy catching instead of pitching
But listening to Cas trip over
“Probably both,” Gabriel replied. “Like I said, time is a fickle thing. They gave me all the information we need to figure out where the problems started, what the results were, and where we could fix it so when they go back to their own time things will be different, hopefully better.”
Castiel looked at his ring again, then watched his husband’s retreating form.
Castiel nodded, and not knowing what to do next decided to disappear, leaving Gabriel laughing.

Sam’s beers off the table as he went. Cas waited a heartbeat before following him.
“There’s my little man!” Dean called out, walking towards them with his arms outstretched. “Da!” Sammy called out, reaching towards Dean. Dean just laughed and scooped him out of MJ’s arms.
Cas just smiled at him, that small amused smile that has been coming out more frequently since he and Dean bonded. “He’s fine, Dean,” Cas assured him, “he’s just stretching his wings.” Cas stroked the air again, where Sammy’s wings were, Dean guessed.
Sammy popped out of Dean’s hands again, back into Sam’s lap. Dean huffed and picked him up again, but Sammy just popped right back to his Uncle Sam. “I’m his favorite uncle,” Sammy told him with a grin. Once again, Dean picked up the baby, and once again, the baby popped back into Sam’s lap.
"Claire, grab me some cuffs, the ones with the devil's trap on them," he said to the woman. She nodded and headed down the hall.
awesome. Cas asked questions throughout all three movies, earning them harsh shushes from the other theatergoers and keeping Dean from enjoying the experience. Did the man not know how to suspend belief for a couple hours and enjoy the movies?
kind of nervous. He told MJ stories about how he met Dean and Sam, listened to her stories about her family. When the waiter came, MJ ordered for both of them.
*  *  *  *  *
Cas' hands scrabbled frantically over Dean's back and shoulders the closer he came to the edge, trying to find purchase to keep from flying over. He wanted this feeling to never end, but he was lost when Dean said, "come for me angel." His hips bucked, thrusting into Dean's hand until he came with a soft cry of "Dean!" He spilled over Dean's hand, Dean using his come to slick his hand as he continued to stroke Cas through his orgasm and into his own.
trust a smile like the one he got earlier?
Cas' hands slid from Dean's hair to his shoulders, pushing his jacket and flannel down his shoulders. Dean stepped forward and let go of Cas to shrug the offending garments off, letting them drop to the floor. He then proceeded to unbutton Cas' shirt and practically rip it off his body. Dean let his hands map the exposed skin while his mouth traveled down Cas' jaw, sucking little bruises across his exposed throat.
Gabriel turned to him and yelled "get the hell out of here, the baby has to come out
“Gabriel,” Castiel said sternly, looking his brother up and down, “what were you thinking?”
Sam closed his laptop and picked it up, shooting a smug look at his brother. “Looks like I’m going on a Wendigo hunt. Have fun!” He dropped a kiss on Gabriel’s head and left with their mom.
"Think that's such a good idea?" Sam asked warily. "This thing is powerful enough to compel you, compel us both. Might be asking for trouble."
“Huh,” Dean said, trying to keep his fingertips from digging into his scalp.
“Oh yeah,” MJ said solemnly. “She’s still around in twenty years, but after that last year of running she got a lot of wear and tear and was starting to look a little rough around the edges.” She smiled a bit, lost in melancholy memories. “I remember when you taught me how to drive. I was fifteen, and you drove me hundreds of miles to the Mall of America, not only the biggest mall in the country but the biggest unobstructed parking lot. For about two weeks, we would sleep during the day, and at night after the lot was empty you’d let me drive her, teaching me everything you could when there was smooth pavement and absolutely nothing around for me to hit. Heaven help anyone who scratched your Baby, including me.”
Unfortunately, not knowing angel anatomy, when the surgeon cut the cord the sac split open. A blue-white spark of light emerged. It flitted in circles for a moment before slamming into Gabriel’s skin once, twice, then dissipating into the Veil. Then a burst of blood sprayed from the surgeon’s chest and he dropped to the floor.
loaded, and he read the lyrics as the song played.
Sam sank to his knees between Gabriel’s legs and took his angel’s hands in his own. “What do I do, Gabe? I can’t fix this.” He kissed his angel’s fingers one at a time, silently begging his forgiveness.
When they got back to the bunker, the party was ready to start. Dean had cooked up a couple dozen burgers, while Sam insisted on making a salad and slicing tomatoes and lettuce for the burgers. They scrounged up some chips to go with it, including Sam’s sea salt seaweed chips, which Dean made a gagging face at. Sodas and beers rounded out the food table.
Gabriel shook his head. "I'm not sure the entire timeline can be changed, but I know more now than before the kids left. It all starts with the Book of Enoch on the angel side. The Grigori didn't start off bad, but the floods came and their wives and children were wiped out. I don't know how, but Samyaza survived. He was their leader, and he rallied the surviving Grigori to eliminate any Nephilim not born to the original two hundred Grigori. When they were cut off from the Host they had to get their power from somewhere, so they started eating human souls. That quickly drove them insane. No Nephilim, angel, or human sympathetic to angels are safe as long as even one of them lives, especially Samyaza. Kill him, the others will be easy to destroy."
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dude,” Dean said, “people piss us off all the time, doesn’t mean we don’t want them around. I mean, look at all the shit Cas and I went through, and I kept
“Actually, I think I do. You remember when Uncle Cas bonded to Uncle Dean when he pulled him from Hell? He felt pretty much the same way, and that’s why he kept his distance for so long. He felt guilty because he unintentionally bonded to him in a moment of saving the person he loved. He didn’t have Uncle Dean’s consent, either. Hell, Uncle Dean didn’t even believe angels were real at the time. Just talk to Dad about it, okay?” Bobby asked. “Just because you bond to a Winchester doesn’t mean you inherit the need to internalize and angst over everything.”
That left Sam and Dean to take care of the werewolves.
Finally remembering that the trumpet player was the one who dragged Sam over to introduce to Cas, he replied, “yeah, he’s my kid brother. How do you know short stack here?” He heard the short blonde humph at the comment, but he just grinned widely.
“How should I know? I haven’t even been born yet,” she said flippantly.
Dean pulled a folder of music out of his messenger bag and approached Cas, not disrupting his practice. When Cas finished and opened his eyes, he saw Dean standing there and smiled. Dean’s stomach did something funny, but he thought that was probably just the McMuffin he grabbed on the way in.
"Surprise!" Dean said with a grin on his face, earning both boys a skeptical look from the sheriff. Both boys threw an arm over her shoulder and led her over to the group of people they were standing with earlier. Dean grabbed the hand of a pretty blonde lady and dragged her up to Jody. "This is our mom, Mary Winchester."
just think that). “Sam, this isn’t something that anyone could just do. This takes a lot of talent, which you repeatedly display in spades.” He quickly scanned through the piece to find a difficult part he was just going over and pointed it out to Sammy. “
“Yeah, no problem.” MJ huffed and sat down on the ground just outside the cage. “I’ve been praying for you, you know.”
Castiel grabbed one of Sam’s arms and chicken-winged it behind his back, forcing him against the wall next to where he had pinned Bobby. “Sam, Bobby knew nothing about this,” Cas said forcefully next to Sam’s ear. “He was just as surprised about Gabriel’s pregnancy as everyone else. Had he known, he would have tried to prevent this from happening.”
“But Gabe in the future said he felt the shift after they’d already come back to us,” Dean pointed out. “He said that Sammy here didn’t make it the first time, before I showed up there.”
"Dean."
"Penises," Castiel supplied matter-of-factly.
“Don’t sweat it, man,” Dean said with a smile. “Sammy’s always putting together fun shit for me to play.” Dean looked up at Sam as he returned to the room with Gabriel. “Did you still wanna give this a shot tonight?” he asked his brother.
“Special delivery!” Bobby called out as he popped into the library, holding a large gift basket. Sam looked up from the notes he was writing. Gabriel had sent Bobby out to check on Dean and Cas to see when they’d be back, since neither was answering their phone. He stood up and took the note Bobby was holding out to him and read it.
bouncing him in his arms, his son calming his nerves. Dean about lost his shit when the little angel popped out of his arms.
Gabriel just laughed. “Oh man, you don’t know?” He turned to Castiel. “You didn’t tell him?”
“Uncle Dean said he’d bring your laptop back with them, they’re still using it. They’re planning on leaving Saturday morning and should be home by Monday evening,” Bobby relayed the message. “Where’s Pops at?”
They all met up near the door, Castiel holding the finger bone, Sam holding the jar of blood, and Dean smiling at his snow globe.
Gabriel, still chuckling, wrapped his arms around Sam’s waist and asked “what’s up Sammich?”
He kissed her forehead and said, "count me in. I'm the king of karaoke."
"Why are you sorry, Dean?" he asked with that adorable tilt to his head.
Bobby just grinned sheepishly and said, “I thought it would be more fun for you guys to find out the old fashioned way.”
He once again relived the previous Friday evening in his mind as he brushed his teeth and stripped down to his boxers before climbing into bed. If Castiel kept his eyes closed, he could imagine it was Dean grabbing a fistful of his hair instead of himself. He could lightly run his fingertips over his lips and ghost them down his naked torso, and in his mind’s eye they would be Dean’s lips on him. He could take his testicles into hand firmly and give a gentle tug, almost feeling the suction from Dean’s mouth.

Tagging for fabulous first-time penetrative sex (be prepared to replace disintegrated panties). Also tagging for humor, because you will most likely laugh your ass off towards the end of the chapter. Just sayin'.
. However, every time he would get settled in, he’d get yet another text from Gabriel. It was very middle school, with questions like “Did Dean say anything about Sam?” or “Has Sam talked about me to Dean?” He was very tempted to turn his phone off, but couldn’t find it in himself to not respond to his cousin, even if it was in the negative to his questions.
Cas moaned at the feeling, leaning in to kiss Dean despite their morning breath. He rocked his ass against Dean’s cock as one arm reached for the box of condoms on the nightstand, plucking one out. His mouth broke from Dean’s long enough to bite one corner of the foil packet and ripping it open, then dove back in for more as he reached around and rolled it down the man’s thick shaft. Still loose from the hours before, Cas slowly worked himself down Dean’s erection, both men moaning in pleasure. Once fully seated. Dean took Cas’ hands in his to provide him leverage as Castiel worked himself up and down.
“My son,” Toni smiled. “You’ll learn soon enough that you’re not really the ones in charge,” she said with a wink. She pointed to the locket she handed Castiel. “That should give you something to home in onto Anna with. It was a gift from her.”
“Hello, Dean.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"I call bullshit," he said smugly.
Castiel nodded at that, the conversation petering out. The strains of Beethoven’s 5th on repeat filling the silence. But the longer he stood there with Sam and Gabriel’s focus on him, the more he fidgeted, feeling judged. He wanted to say more, but was interrupted by Sam.
“There is a reason, Sam,” Chuck said, as if reading Sam’s mind. “It might not make sense, and it probably hurt like a sonofabitch, but there was still a reason.”
Gabriel hopped out of bed, snapping his fingers to clean up the evidence of their early morning lovemaking. Sam propped himself up on his elbow and watched as Gabriel walked to their dresser naked and start pulling out clothes. "What do we have going on today?" he asked.
* * * * *
And that was how their first family Fourth of July picnic officially ended, with both brothers bonded to their angels, their mom and their kids looking at them with love and hope in their eyes.
“You lost me, Cas. How do angels get pregnant without sex?” Dean sat down on his bed, confused. Castiel sat next to him, careful to keep his distance so as not to make Dean more nervous than he already was.
"Prostate," was all Cas could say, he was breathing so hard. Dean smiled and hit that spot again, making Cas damned near scream. He kept up the assault until Cas was jello and practically sobbing.
Dean stood just inside the door, flabbergasted. The place was packed but smelled like a greasy Nirvana. He turned to one wall, which had the full Dyer's story posted for all to read. Next to that was the menu, but Cas stepped up to the counter and ordered them each a Dyer's Triple Triple Combo-a burger with three patties and three cheeses, along with home-cut fries and large Cokes. A table miraculously opened up and Cas led Dean over to take a seat.
“Holy shit,” Dean whispered and pressed the bear’s stomach again.
Deanna grinned back. "I can try."
"Has anyone figured out they're related to us?" Sam asked.
A few hours later he heard a faint knock on his door, barely audible over the music he had playing. He turned to see the door open, Dean standing on the other side. He paused the song and stood to greet Dean. “How are you feeling?”
As he finished cleaning up the popcorn that had crash-landed on the floor, his brain made circles around that kiss. Actually, it was more about the man behind that kiss. Cas
“Dude, let him go!” Dean yelled at him. “Stop it Sam! That’s your son!”
“But we’re their family,” Dean interrupted him.
Charlie spun him around and slammed him into his car, surprising him with the strength her size disguised. “Now you listen to me, Dean Winchester,” she almost yelled, poking him in the chest with her dainty but sharp pointer finger. “You have
"Did I do something amusing, Dean?" Cas asked. "Was it my hair? Almost every story I read had assumed that you would like my hair messy, though I do not understand why."
not getting it.
"Sammy," Dean choked out, "it's me. It's 2017 me. I used the same spell the kids used to come back to us."
Chuck held baby Sammy, bouncing him and making faces at him as MJ and Bobby got all of the stuff they accumulated while in 2017. In hushed tones, Sam and Gabe talked out how they felt about Chuck’s lack of response to their prayers, Gabriel holding Sam’s hand and letting him know everything
“Expecting what?”
“What did Crowley want with you two?” Sam asked his son.
"Not gonna happen, Dad," he said, eyes still on the door. "This is my family and I'm tired of running."
“It’s ok, Cas,” Sam smiled. “You just take care of yourself and we’ll see you later.” Castiel walked behind them to the door, seeing them out. Alone again, he wondered in Dean was still angry and how he was handling their fall-out. Hopefully better than he was.
"What do you need angel?"
Gabriel must have felt Sam’s pain through their bond and wrapped his arms around Sam, pulling him to lean back against his chest. Gabriel snapped his fingers to turn off the TV and he and his hunter got comfortable on the couch. Sammy fell asleep on Sam’s chest as his uncles rubbed their fingers up and down his back and let silent tears fall for the baby they lost.
"You two decent in there?" Gabriel asked from the other side of the door.
“Yeah,” Claire said with a bright smile. “She’s still alive and kicking, running the sheriff’s department there in Sioux Falls. She complains about being stuck behind a desk, but I know for a fact she loves that it gives her more time at home to help Alex and Aaron rebuild the Judah Initiative. Even though we haven’t heard from the Thule again, Aaron thinks it’s important to keep the movement going to keep the history alive.”
“Yeah,” Sam said, wondering if this counted as a chick-flick moment. “Yeah, okay.”
“Hey!” Dean and MJ said indignantly at the same time.
"Sammy?" Dean said groggily, blinking his eyes and starting to stretch until he remembered where he was and what state he was in. He pulled the blanket off Gabriel and wrapped it around himself as he sat up. "I think whatever's fucking with us knows what's in our heads. I mean, no one knew-" Dean stopped his train of thought as he stared over Sam's shoulder in awe. Sam turned to see what caused that kind of reaction in his brother, and was greeted by the sight of Cas with large black wings protruding from his back.
Dean stopped and looked at Cas, both of their eyes going wide. Dean ran over to the bear and picked it up. He felt around and deep inside its tummy was a little box. He squeezed it.
“Is it over yet?” Bobby yelled from outside the room. “Yeah, it’s over!” MJ replied. Bobby came back in and sat down next to MJ, who was finally starting to calm down.
“I guess there’s no time like the present,” he said hesitantly. When Charlie left him with a cheery, “bitchin’!”, Kevin made his way over for hellos. Dean and Sam returned in time for Sam to answer a knock at the door.
Well, shit. Dean had to let go of Cas' dick and grab the base of his own to keep from ending this show before it began. Looked like that dirty talk thing worked both ways.
After anchoring the ropes suspending Sam, he stepped back and looked reverently at his handiwork. He was right, Sam looked absolutely gorgeous-a light sheen of sweat coated flushed skin, nipples stiff and begging to be touched, heavy balls hanging below a proud erection, Gabriel’s mark showing from the center of the pentagram of ropes across his heaving chest. Sam’s hair hung over his face, and Gabriel gently pushed it back and kissed him on the cheek.
"Yeah, because you're so irresistible," Gabriel said, getting the hunters' attention. Sam rolled his eyes and Dean snorted.
"What does that mean?" Mary asked, concern written clearly on her face. "Is he alright?"
“Oh yeah?” Sam asked genuinely curious now. “Like what?”
Cas gave a nod, but before he could fly out, Gabriel grabbed him.
The angels advanced. Sam fired a salt round into Anane's chest, not doing any damage but knocking him back out the door. Gabriel and Cas locked in battle with Danel, their shorter blades parrying against his sword. Sam shot a salt round into Turel as Anane rejoined the battle, advancing on Dean. Sam aimed at Danel, trying to get a clear shot and just barely saw Turel come flying towards Bobby, sword held high above his head. Sam yelled as he dove to push Bobby out of the way, taking the full force of Turel's sword through his chest.
Sam had to admit, he and Gabriel both needed this. They’d both decided on slacks and dress shirts, sleeves rolled up to the elbows. Castiel, who wanted to give the two some semblance of privacy, tagged along in what Dean referred to as his ‘angel stealth-mode’, sliding into an ethereal plane of existence so that he could watch his charges without being seen. Sam and Gabriel talked and laughed over a nice steak dinner before heading to the dance studio, aptly named Care to Dance.
Gabriel was practically bouncing with excitement. “Get to the car, Dean!” he exclaimed. “We’ve got a surprise planned for you guys!” He looked at Cas expectantly. Dean had gotten really good at reading his facial expressions, and if he weren’t mistaken, his angel was a little excited about Gabriel’s surprise, too.
“Come
"Well," Sam pondered, "have any other hunters been here during your time?"
Everyone looked at Bobby, who had his hands over his ears and singing “LALALALALA” loudly to drown out the song and the associated memory. MJ laughed so hard that Sammy started squirming in her arms. Dean just walked over and stuck his head right up to see the minuscule distance between the metal object and his Baby’s glass.
"Yes, ma'am!" Gabriel replied playfully, rocking his hips against hers and once again rendering her speechless. As the music changed to a mashup of Beethoven and Led Zeppelin and the tempo picked up, Gabriel hauled them into a sitting position. He wrapped his arms around her, hands coming up from behind and hands grasping her shoulders to pull her down onto his cock with every thrust. Deanna just wrapped her arms around his neck, letting her head fall back and enjoying the ride. Gabriel leaned into her as he pounded up into her, sucking bruises into her skin. Another snap of his fingers held her body in place so he was free to let his hands do as they pleased. One hand snaked down her back, his fingers teasing at her ass, while the other dropped to her lap to tease at her clit.
"We never speak of this again," Dean said.
Bobby laughed and snapped his fingers again, freeing Gabriel. “He’s not a bad parent at all Dad, Uncle Dean from my time thought the look on your face would be priceless if you thought he was a crap parent, and he was right.” He looked up at Dean, grinning and trying to get a high five. Dean started laughing all over again and slapped him five. “Although it was pretty crappy of you to take off on everyone after the Elysian Fields Hotel and not tell anyone you were brought back. Letting Dad think you were just as bad in the future as you are now is pretty good ‘just desserts’, wouldn’t you say?”
“Seven years, Gabriel!” Sam yells. “Seven
"That would be it!" Gabriel said, pointing a finger at Sam. "Now we just gotta find which ones have a Sam and Dean Winchester that teenage girls obsess over and narrow it down to the right one. Difficult, but it shouldn't be as hard as actually getting there."
Once again, Sam and Gabriel were hiding in their room. It wasn’t a grace-filled sex-fest like last time, but more taking the time to heal each other’s wounds. When the sun went down and the stars came out, they slept tangled up in each other. While Castiel and Mary sifted through notes on the Grigori, they told stories to each other of their lives before they were an ‘us’. While MJ was in the nursery with Baby Sammy trying to get him to sit up on his own, they simply touched each other and breathed each other’s air. And while Bobby sat in his room trying to comprehend his parent’s evolution, they whispered promises to each other that one day they’d be the best parents ever.
The archangel started at his ankles, massaging up and down Sam’s calves with both hands while kissing the insides of his knees. He licked up the inside of his left thigh, nipping and sucking little bruises into the sensitive skin, making Sam squirm before repeating the process on his right thigh. Bypassing his groin, he moved up to his hipbones, sucking deep purple bruises into each. Sam gasped at a sharp bite to his right hip, which Gabriel soothed over with his tongue.
“I’ll even let you set the whole thing up, sit next to me, whatever it takes to make you feel okay about this, Dad,” MJ told him. “We need that information.”
Dean and Castiel were starting to give Kevin the stink-eye. If he didn’t answer this right, he could end up having his wings yanked out. “We’re still young,” he said nervously, “she hasn’t even been born yet. Give us a few decades.”
"I'm sure he'll be just fine," Dean told him, slapping his shoulder. "Like you said, part archangel."
Dean leaned into the driver’s side window, pushed the tape into the tape deck, then cranked the volume.
Sam gave Gabriel a bitchface. “Seriously? You want to use me as a guinea pig?”
Gabriel just smiled and said, “already ahead of you,” with a wink.
Just one little date. We haven’t even
“In my stomach,” Cas responded, as if the question wasn’t meant to be humorous. That made Dean laugh even more.
“Probably,” Mary replied with a smile, “but you can probably let him have some of the frosting.”
Lucifer dropped Bobby’s hand like he’d been burned. He stalked over to Gabriel, getting right in his face and said, “you didn’t!”
"Do you think someone saw you with Gabriel and Bobby when he had his little growth spurt?" Dean asked.
,” Bobby grinned.
Feeling more confident, he gave Gabriel's hair a gentle tug. Gabriel's fingers dug into Sam's hips and he fairly plunged into his mouth. Their kiss became frantic with a life of its own. Hands were scrabbling to find purchase where they could. One of Gabriel's hands slid up under the back of his shirt, feeling the scarred satin under his fingertips before dragging his nails down the man's back.
Gabriel and Dean stared at him in shock before they were both laughing so hard it hurt. “Dammit, Cassie! You and your morbid sense of humor!” He wrapped an arm around his cousin’s shoulder and kept laughing so that he wouldn’t cry.
Gabriel slowly reached for the hilt of his sword. “It was too high of a cost, brother, and it damned you all.” In one swift movement, Gabriel pulled his sword from its scabbard as he turned, bringing the tip of the blade to Samyaza’s throat on the upswing. He held steady, the tip biting into his opponent’s flesh. Where there would be the bluish-white of grace, there was black ichor slowly trickling from the wound. “It has to stop.”
"What are you doing here?" Sam asked. "Have you guys figured out how to stop all of this yet?"
“A little bit of everything,” he grinned. He picked out a fast Spanish ballad, smoothly transitioning to the opening notes of
” echoed throughout the amphitheater as he struggled to remove all of the restraints. As the collar came off, Gabriel’s body healed itself, but Gabriel lost consciousness. Sam cradled him in his arms and rocked back and forth, sobs wracking his body. Dean extinguished the holy fire and he and Castiel approached Sam and Gabriel. Dean had tears sliding down his cheeks too, devastated at his brother’s loss. They saved Gabriel, but they were too late to save the baby.
Castiel was sure this was Dean’s revenge for the short kiss Monday night, and the lack thereof the rest of the week. Their evening would definitely be interesting.
“We’re down to five,” Dean said, draining his beer and tossing the empty in the trash.
Castiel shrugged one shoulder as he scooped a bite onto his fork. “I enjoy both the flavor and the texture. Here,” Cas put another bite onto his fork and held it out for Dean to try. Dean gave it a skeptical look before accepting it, then gave Cas an approving nod.
Later that evening while everyone was taking a break, Kevin came by. He was nervous as hell to be around Dean and Castiel again, but Dean was his friend and he loved MJ, and knowing that they needed to make peace if he was going to be a part of their lives decided to take the first step.
“Hey Mom,” Dean said, leaning in to give her a hug and a quick kiss on the cheek. “We both really appreciate you taking care of him for us. I hope he wasn’t too much trouble.”
“Yeah, we figured that out. Why didn’t you answer your phones? We could have given you a heads up, or even sent Gabriel over for backup.”
“Hello Dean,” Cas said, holding up a shopping bag of movie snacks in one hand and a pie from the corner bakery in the other like an offering.
* * * * *
angel revels in the things your hands and mouth could do, if you weren’t so careful.”
They sat there a little longer catching Kevin up on everything that had happened recently. When Sam told Kevin about Dean and Cas, he just laughed and said it didn't surprise him.
Dean stood up and started pacing, hands wiping down his face to try to wipe away the flush and sweat. He could not picture his innocent angel of the Lord working a stripper pole. Actually, now that MJ had told the story, he was starting to picture it, and that was starting to cause a problem in his pants.
“Yeah,” he said. A silence fell between the two men, neither comfortable nor uncomfortable. After a few minutes, Dean asked, “what were you listening to?”
Lucifer let out a gasp in mock indignation. “You were going to leave without saying goodbye? That hurts, MJ. I thought I meant more to you than that.”
"Doing so good for me, angel. Just relax and let me take care of you." He rotated his wrist a bit as he kept working his fingers in and out. When they slid in easily, he started spreading his fingers apart to make room. One of his fingers brushed up against something inside of him and Cas nearly shot off the bed.
They looked up when the closet door slammed open, Dean practically falling through before slamming it behind him and smearing blood from his hand across it. He looked like hell, filthy and flannel ripped in a few places, duffel over one shoulder and holding a baby in one arm.
When the song ended, Dean was gasping for breath and heaving with exertion. He was gearing up for another go on the next song, but Sammy his the power button. Before Dean could start bitching, Sammy got a word in edgewise.
Dean was flabbergasted. If Cas hadn’t had sex since college, then that means he’d been dry for at least three or four years. He couldn’t fathom going that long without sex.
It was adorable how red Cas got when he was nervous. Dean wanted to just keep teasing him, but figured nothing would get done if he did. Cas cleared his throat before telling him, “I have an affection for burgers of all kinds. I was planning on making you one of my favorite recipes.”
Kevin arrived in the middle of the battle between the Winchesters and the remaining four Grigori. Castiel and Gabriel were holding their own against Ramuel and Ertael; Asael was down. Sam and Mary were struggling against Danel, both Winchesters sluggish and losing blood. Kevin, taking a page from Dean’s battle strategy at Moondor, rushed Danel screaming, angel blade held high. Danel, somewhat perplexed at the Scribe rushing towards him, paused long enough to give the Winchesters the advantage. Mary slashed at the Grigori’s neck with her own blade, Sam grabbing him by the shoulder and plunging Gabriel’s angel blade through his heart. Kevin stuttered to a stop in front of the falling body.
Sam looked uncomfortably at Bobby, almost too scared to ask. “Um, who is your, um, mom?” he started. “I mean, which angel carried you?”
Castiel never thought himself a great cook, but he could make his own meals. However, he made a
“Your messages came about a half an hour after we got here, looks like. You might have caught us if I didn’t break a dozen speed limits trying to get that drive over with. MJ insisted on playing old school rap the entire drive up here,” he bitched.
Dean was pretty sure he had a handle on how to take care of his angel. He loved how Cas let him touch and explore his body, discovering how to take him apart and put him back together. He relished gently running his hands over Cas’ body, his angel so responsive under Dean. But if Cas wanted to play teacher for a night, far be it for Dean to deny him.
“Robert- what’s your middle name?”
Sam just paced as MJ tried to explain herself. He was feeling more agitated than he thought he would. Bobby was his son, or would be his son, and the thought of him trapped in the cage with Lucifer like he was makes his stomach churn with nausea. In the past he had thought about having kids when Jess was still alive and he was considering a future with her, without hunting. He never wanted his own kids involved in this life, and now it seems like it would be inevitable. Bobby was an amazing kid, but now Sam was seriously second-guessing bonding with Gabriel and bringing kids into the life of a hunter. Dejectedly, he turned from the group to go check on his son.
Crowley knew if he let those two lose and still managed to reclaim Hell, it would be a farce. These two would hold more power than he ever would, despite his demonic powers. They would be able to stop anything and everything he ever tried. The demons would see it, and if they heard he was the one who set them loose, then every demon in Hell would rebel against him.
"Sorry about that Uncle Dean," Bobby said, looking distressed. "I was just trying to help."
“Because I’m an archangel,” he grinned, “I get special privileges. But seriously, time is fluid. Every day they’re here, their own future fluctuates. The more they tell you guys, the more of a chance they mess with your free will and their own timeline. By telling you guys the bare minimum, they’re allowing you guys to continue making your own choices without feeling trapped by what you’d feel you’d have to do in order to keep their timeline intact. Does that make any sense?”
Just then, Gabriel’s phone notified him of a text message. When he opened it, Gabriel grinned like a kid in a candy store. “His name’s Sam,” Gabriel told him, “and you might just get to meet him. Looks like he and his brother are coming out tonight.”
Gabriel let go of MJ and faced Sam, Dean, and Castiel, purpose lighting his eyes. “We’re one step closer to finishing this. Let’s do it right.”
"You've got a point, Deano. I've never taken a sacrifice that wasn't willingly given. So how about I make it good for you, hmmm? Make you willing?" Gabriel quirked an eyebrow, and with a flick of his wrist a jolt of arousal hit Dean. It started from behind his balls and raced up his spine, unable to shiver at the sensation but wanting to desperately. His mouth dropped open and his eyes widened as he started at Gabriel in shock. The archangel simply smirked.
"But we're of Michael's vessel's bloodline, too," Bobby pointed out, "and both Michael and Lucifer are archangels. Even though Lucifer fell, there was nothing demonic about him except his attitude."
“Blow out your candles before you ruin the pie,” the girl said to Dean. “Seriously, pie is sacred.”
This declaration startled everyone. To Sam and Dean’s knowledge, the only threat left facing the kids in the future were the Grigori, and the Men of Letters wouldn’t stand a chance against one of them. “Keep talking,” Dean said neutrally.
“Do you trust me Dean?” Castiel asked. Dean looked down to see Cas looking up at him under hooded eyes. Trying to catch his breath, he nodded. Cas removed a hand from one of Dean’s thighs and felt a slight shift. He watched Cas take his cock in his mouth, slick warmth sliding down his length before feeling his teeth gently scrape back up, catching the underside of the head and holding there as he felt Cas’ tongue trace around it. Then Dean felt one lubed finger slide between his ass cheeks before massaging around his asshole.
“Dean, Samuel,” he greeted them with a solemn nod.
Dean closed his eyes and forced himself to relax. Cas' touch was nice, soothing even. Eventually, Cas' fingers slid behind his balls, massaging the area just behind them with firm pressure. It felt good. Good enough that his dick was twitching and filling. A small sigh escaped his lips and his body relaxed even further into Castiel's. Without warning, he felt Cas' lips on his. It made Dean tense up again for a second, then relaxed as the angel continued to simply brush his lips against Dean's, no pushing for anything more than that.
He was not expecting the man to face him with an icy blue gaze and to say, “hello Dean.”
Everyone’s heads whipped around to see Chuck standing there. While Mary and the kids were confused about who it was, Sam, Dean, Gabriel, and Castiel were all speechless, an onslaught of emotions rolling through them.
Well, if that didn’t sober his ass up, nothing would.
Gabriel sat there on his knees until darkness was fully upon him, praying for the hundreds of souls lost to the Grigori, praying they made it through the veil to their true rewards. He prayed to his Father, begged him for forgiveness for another death and that he hoped it was righteous. And he prayed to Sam. He prayed that his hunter remained safe. He prayed that the man would still love him after this, would never leave him.
“Nerd,” MJ muttered, but everyone could tell that Dean was as proud of Bobby as he was of his own daughter.
The guys dragged in late that night, expecting everyone to already be out for the night. However, Cas and Gabriel were in the library deep in discussion. It looked pretty serious, and they wondered if it was something they should worry about. They must have been heard because the angels looked up and Gabriel waved them in.
Yep, it went there. Castiel wanted Sam to fuck him right there in Chuck's house. He knew he should say no, should find a way to extricate himself from the situation, but whatever it was compelling them to do these things wasn't letting up and Sam could feel his fingers itching to reach for the angel. Fuck it. This was happening whether they wanted it to or not, so Sam yanked Cas towards him by the waist of his pants, undid the belt and his fly, yanked his pants down to his knees, turned him around, and bent him over Chuck's desk, scattering papers everywhere. Sam quickly uncapped the bottle of lube and slicked up his fingers, then slid his forefinger into Cas easily, all the way to the third knuckle in one smooth movement. The intrusion pulled a deep

"Probably both," Dean said, turning his face towards Sam's. "It's also cheesier than any porn I've ever seen, and that's saying something." Dean nosed along Sam's jaw, nipping at the soft skin. Sam actually whined, grinding his throbbing erection against Dean's leg. Dean shuddered and felt the need to come rise fast inside him. "We've got two options, Sammy," Dean tried to explain, despite Sam quickly losing the battle to fuck his brother against the shower wall. "We can either fuck each other, or get in on that action," he said, waving a hand towards the angels.
“I’m glad to see you guys are getting along again,” MJ said, hugging her dads. “I’m gonna crash, I’ve got stuff to do tomorrow. Love you guys!” She kissed her dads on their cheeks, then hugged her uncles before heading off to her room.
Castiel examined one of the photographs Gabriel handed him as the archangel continued on with his monologue on the fundamentals of shibari. It showed Sam’s body from just above the pubic bone, not revealing his genitalia. A rope was tied around his waist, and another crossed over his chest several times in the shape of a pentagram. While the rope almost completely obscured his anti-possession tattoo, is showcased Gabriel’s mark on him completely from the center of the rope formation. His arms were pulled backwards as if bound, and Sam’s head hung downward with his hair hiding most of his face, except for his parted lips, which looked to be struggling for breath. His skin was flushed with a fine sheen of sweat that made it appear that Sam was  glowing. The photograph itself was aesthetically pleasing; the subject matter continued to make Castiel uncomfortable.
