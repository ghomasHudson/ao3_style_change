Steve bent down, pressed his lips into his hair, “I cannot lose you. I cannot lose you right now, alright. I know it’s selfish but God, Tony, I cannot.”
“Steve? Baby? You need to wash up, alright? Can you do that for me?”
“He’s just taking them out, I actually bought them,” Tony complains, continuing to chop vegetables, “I remembered you like mini sausages. I went and bought extra. Well, I didn’t buy them myself. I told Jarvis to put it on the shopping list but still. I remembered. I want that known before that trash pile gets all the credit.”
They had walked back from the park slowly, as the sun got higher in the sky and got lost in the lunch break crowd; people in suits, in various work attire creating a bubble around them: two young men with nothing to do but pay attention to each other.
“Sure,” Steve ran a hand through Tony’s hair as he put the marker between the pages with his other, “where to?”
“You don’t have to apologize for talking, Tony.”
Tony covered it hastily, “No he- He wouldn’t. He was-” he smiled, “Actually he was the one who saved me.”
“Not in the kitchen, Tony,” Steve whispers in his ear, if he didn’t have self control, God knows Steve would have taken Tony right away. He sweeps Tony off of his feet, taking him towards the elevator, “You look beautiful. You always do.”
Obie had barged into his room the moment he was awake, voice booming. His cheer felt fake. Tony had flinched at his touch but his discomfort at Obie touching him had been mistaken as surprise, thankfully.
It had been a pain in the ass to keep his bruised wrist a secret from him, especially with the restricted movement, but at least Tony had experience hiding injuries. Maybe the one good thing that came out of his on again off again relationship with Ty was that it taught him how to be sneaky.
Tony smiles, “Like I needed a competition to tell me that.” He loops his arms around Steve’s shoulders, “Think I bagged the win a long time ago.”
“HEY!” Steve shouts into the headset, then winces, “Hey, yeah, I’m here I just- I just didn’t expect it to happen, uh, like this.”
Tony put the notebook back into its place. Pulled out another, bigger one. This one had people in it. Sitting down in cafes, walking in the streets, running… Tony realized Steve had more than one drawing of the yoga group he passed by in Central Park, thrilled by the fact that they paid attention to the same thing.
“Alright,” Steve walked up to the bed. He sat down beside him, inhaling his metal and herb scent and bent down to press a lingering kiss to his husband’s lips, “I’ll ogle you instead.”
Tony took a shaky breath, thick grass bruised under his knees.
a thousand stars don’t shine as bright as the one on your chest tonight
And the smell haunted him when he awoke.
Tony wrapped his hands around his wrists, “Come on,” and Steve came willingly.
Oh God. What if he wins? He designed the arena. What if he actually wins? Should he record it?
Oh God, the neighbors.
“I can explain.”
There was no clue to where the smell was coming from. One moment, it was there, swimming through the air to reach him. If Steve moved to suddenly, if he made loud noises, it got sharper. Then it disappeared mysteriously.
the phone tree’s still on and i’m getting all the news
Tony pecked his cheek, “I know.”
“And at first I was going to ask them to name it Steve Rogers Petting Zoo but then I thought that was maybe kind of invasive, you know, naming it like that without your input, and then I thought about naming it Captain America Petting Zoo but then that kind of sounded silly and- Oh my God, Captain’s Petting Zoo is even sillier than that isn’t it-”
“Yeah, well, don’t really worry about it. I’m not- I mean, we’re not really expecting you to work for us. Unless you’d want to. I mean I’d need- We’d need your portfolio but it could be done. Anyway, I was just wondering what you’d come up with. Not for like, adding it into the game. But that can be done! If you want, I mean,” Iron Man sighs, “What I’m trying to say is that I genuinely didn’t use my brain when I added that map maker into your menu.”
What he doesn’t expect is this chain of events: Steve asks Dum-E to bring him a fork. Dum-E, being the absolute fucking dummy that it is, grabs the foot-long carving fork from the drawer. Steve panics. Dum-E panics. Then Tony panics.
Tony had been in beds where arms and legs mixed, under the influence of way too many shit to ever be safe, in places he didn’t know with people whose faces he couldn’t recall and still… This was the thing that broke him at last. This was the thing that would make him throw everything aside if asked. He wouldn’t be able to go back. If Steve ever sent him away, he would be incomplete.
“Recognize? How,” Steve had been confused.
The lack of sleep, energy, the fact that he hadn't been able to eat hit him, slowly took over him. He swayed where he sat. Vanilla wafted around him, surrounding him, getting more and more powerful the more he sat.
“Okay,” Tony drawled, he was sensing… Things. Sensy things. Yeah… “So when are his owners picking him up?”
The goose must be taking this stuff somewhere. This is almost a one-man organized crime at this point. The bird must have a stash and that stash must be somewhere in this little town.
“Uh-huh.”
Saturday morning is the worst, most horrible time Steve has had in years. His clothes feel awkward on him, even though he logically knows that they look just like how they do any other day. He looks exceptionally worse in the mirror.
“Steve.”
A Couple Of Months Later
“Tony-”
“Why are you shouting?!”
There, stands the goose, with a chain hanging from its beak. It happily waddles inside once Steve steps aside and drops the chain onto its pile.
He hadn’t realized Tony was the cure to both. Tony was eager to explain everything, and Steve learned fast. So their conversation moved on to other things. And that became a friendship. And that became more.
They spent the night under the blankets, talking. Every second of it, Tony made and remade his plans, backtracking Steve’s steps. In the end their talk turned around and came to them.
but i think i will survive, yes i do
Of all things, they actually end up arguing about the work Steve is doing for the Avengers. And they are not even past the inventory page yet. The thing is, Steve doesn’t want to argue with Iron Man; but the pushy boss-character-man just makes it so hard to stay calm.
He stands there for a couple minutes under fading daylight, with a defeated expression on his face before turning around and leaving for his garage. Maybe he should go back to his ideas for cutting-edge anti-goose technology.
“Uh. Cap?”
And Tony is only human. And gay. So sue him.
He turned, burying his face into the pillows. Steve had slept here. Giddy, he took a deep breath, trying to find his smell in the sheets.
i’ll take the blame
How long until someone from the Stone’s end realized Obie fiddled with the evidence? That Tony fiddled with evidence? How long until someone tracked it back to him? It wouldn’t take much time for the truth to come out after someone realized he had dug up old files from decades ago. The government would get involved. How long? How long?
“Yes?” Steve has to remind himself at that moment, that Iron Man is an AI and can’t really think about the implications of that. Hell, he can’t think. Unless someone has coded that into him, which seems pretty unlikely, still…
“I hope you weren’t too attached to this guy,” Steve had said when he picked up.
Tony pushed his welding goggles on top of his head in confusion, “What?”
“The lights?” Tony shifted at the door of his office, “Aren’t lights brighter normally?”
Tony can only stare at him incredulously, undecided if he should be sad or mad.
Okay, no going down that road. He did it once already. And he’s still pacing. Tony’s feelings and opinions about Steve Rogers are not the answer to this dilemma.
It was new, still. But Steve could feel that this was it. Tony was the one.
Or worse. Sealed up again.
So, he’d make one. Simple.
A few quiet moments pass, but neither has fallen asleep, Tony knows Steve isn’t asleep. He looks up at Steve. The moonlight from the window perfectly casts soft beams across Steve’s face, the light dances across his features and Tony feels like he falls in love everytime he sees him. But there’s a time for that, “Steve? You okay?”
Tony preened under Steve’s sparkling gaze, bit his cinnamon roll, licking his lips showily. He was supposed to be used to being looked at but Steve’s attention was like no other. Tony had been high on his affection since last night. He knew he was putting things off, that they would catch up with him. He needed to go back to the mansion. He needed to make an excuse to Obie. He needed to-
A quiet little brunch is where things come to head. And it’s all Dum-E’s fault. And in relation, Steve’s own fault because Tony had told him Dum-E was bound fuck something up. Steve, for some reason, cannot understand the bots are just bots and just feels an immense fondness for them.
Steve smiled, coming around Tony to plant a kiss on his brow, “Sure, let’s find out the Iron Tsum’s favorites too.”
Tony poked at him, “Nope. In fact, you should wear your old jeans and trekking shoes.”
He pulled Steve to himself, whispering, “Oh baby.”
“I’ll hold them.”
“Steven, no, no, I thought we agreed you wouldn’t call me mista, my brain isn’t much use when it’s turned to mush.”
And after ten years, he still felt compelled to rub his hands over them whenever he took his crown off at the end of the day.
“Caaap?”
“You should sit down and have some babe. Chicken salad, tasty and healthy. Prepared by yours truly,” pulling out a chair for Steve, Tony takes the seat right next to him and dishes out some of the salad.
“Well, explain,” Steve gestured in between them.
The first official rule was dinner: Always be there for dinner.
So he had killed again, or at least got his hands bloody somehow. Tony wanted to shake his head. Not- Not because of what he did. But really, Steve was going around with blood on his hands. He knew from the files that he couldn’t really catch anything himself, but Tony wondered how he hadn’t gotten caught yet with all his recklessness. Impulsiveness. I am here now, he wanted to say, I will protect you. There is not one piece of evidence that I cannot destroy. Instead he chewed on his sweet pastry.
“All I’m saying is Cap, normally people do want to get paid for stuff like this. I’m just saying.”
“Don’t put too much.”
“You’ll get used to it,” said Tony as he took a sip of his coffee.
“Ribbit!”
He could call him. He could call him now. God. He had forgotten about the phone.
“Did you think I could just let it go?” Tony lowered his voice, suddenly aware of how open, how vulnerable they are outside, “I used to have nightmares about him. Now I have nightmares of him coming back from death. Every time I wake up I just cry with relief that he is fucking gone, I-”
Tony pulled them both into the bathroom, turned on the tap with one hand for water to warm up. Steve flinched at the sudden sound of water sloshing down. Tony shushed him.
Tony scrambled up to catch the notifications of his activity sweep. There it was, telling Tony one file was breached since he had been to his computer, and one had been removed or displaced. He clicked on the notification to see which file it was.
Tony wanted to give him everything. He laughed with him, “It’s a relief to know you’re so clean.”
“You don’t know tabloids.”
Thumping down the stairs, he burst into the workshop.
But it feels good, in some odd way, to experience Iron Man being an actual person because, well, because he makes Steve feel seen. He remembers things Steve told him, brings them back and asks about them. It feels like he cares. For some reason Steve can't quite comprehend that he has caught the eye, or well, ear of Iron Man and now they talk about game design and try to virtually stab each other.
“Of course,” he rests his chin on Steve’s head, “what are you going to be doing for the rest of the day.”
The wide, disbelieving eyes touched something in Tony. Oh God, but they were so blue.
One step down. Stop. Listen. Barely breathing, one step more. Stop. Listen.
Steve laughed.
It was unheard of a royal returning alone. Or… Well, not returning, more like. Because he was to not return until he found his consort.
That is, until the jangling of the chain is dulled by grass and the white feathery bum disappears between someone’s broken garden fence. But not just anyone’s garden fence. Oh no. Because Tony Stark’s life cannot be without drama and complications once, even in a remote little town like this.
So Steve being a fucking weirdo instead of him, is something he actually welcomes. And clearly, Steve is soothed by the fact that Tony simply just… Doesn’t care all that much.
Now, three hours later, Steve still has no idea if the thing can actually discern things about his fighting style from their conversation or if this is just a way of messing with his flow. He doesn’t even use the microphone normally, he doesn’t know if he forgot it on or if the boss fight overrides things like that.
Since the eggs can wait and the sausages will take their sweet time cooking, they have no reason to hurry. Which brings them to Steve's insistence that Dum-E gets to do something Tony would not allow any other time: Help with setting the table.
The sun peaks above the horizon, suddenly blinding, not yet heating the ground but a sliver of hope, of salvation. Steve lifts his head. It will be easier to move, once he is warmed up. Once his metabolism kicks up again. He survived alone before, but that was before he knew what it was like to not feel lonely again. Everything feels- Feels more. He wants to give up, give in to that invisible weight on his shoulders.
This time, Tony cups Steve’s cheeks between his hands, “And..?” He prompts.
“Shit! No, no, no, no, no…”
An invisible hand closed around Tony’s heart, it’s a heavy weight in his chest. He got hurt because of me. No, for me. A slight pout. A constant arch to his brows.
When Stark Industries had decided to get into the MMORPG scene, no one had expected them to actually succeed. Ex-firearms-turned-green-energy company, coming out with a game for a rapidly declining genre. Not exactly the best business move.
“You were. You were supposed to die and Obadiah was supposed to inherit Stark Industries and we were supposed to merge. It was a foolproof plan, really. Though I think you know how that all went, right? I think you were there.”
Tony Stark, saved by Captain America. Yeah, cool story bro.
He giggles as he reads the message, “Hi! This is Steve the goose-sitter.”
Tony considered that, looking at Steve who already pulled the bare mattress that was still in its plastic cover onto the floor. Steve sat down onto it. Tony perched on a padded box, now labeled “desk”. He could see the appeal of not calling strangers here.
“Love you too.”
“Crystals? Crystals! Well, could have fooled me. If I had never seen crystals before!”
And now that he had gone and ruined it; lied, kept secrets, went against even the littlest things Tony wanted, he was lonely again.
“But you like sausages,” Steve pouts.
He reached for Steve’s hands, one fist clenched in his hair, the other around the keys still. A shiver ran through him as Tony held his hands, rubbed his thumbs over his knuckles, feeling the bumps and the valleys of new and old scars. He ran his hands up Steve’s arms as he went pliant under his attention.
The wall came apart.
Tony heard his muted footsteps on the lush carpet before the man himself appeared at the entrance.
Needless to say, he can’t sleep and he’s more than a little bit out of it throughout all his classes. Also his back definitely makes it known that the way he sits in front of the computer needs to change.
“Well I’m sorry!”
In a couple of minutes, this was going to be his house.
And Tony was sure there was a reason for that. He just wasn’t sure if he wanted to hear that reason or not.
Stone twitched. Once. Twice. Then slumped into the pool of his own blood.
“My pleasure, now let’s settle down before my lasagne gets cold,” he slides off Tony’s jacket and ditches it on the counter, in a very un-Steve like fashion.
Tony pouts and crosses his arms, “I think we’re all scared of her. But she makes Pepper happy, and you make me happy so we’re all one big happy family.”
Steve sighed, “That’s because he was busy eating a 24-pack of toilet paper when I found him. And oh- I called a vet for that, I think they will have to take him away to get that fixed,” he grimaced.
But at least, Steve was happy.
“You knew that,” Steve has no idea what Iron Man truly means or why he is so surprised but on the other hand, maybe he understands a little. A lot of other people would capitalize on such fame. “Well, you know, I like the anonymity of it. I could be just… Anyone. And that makes me, uh, relatable? I guess?”
Steve Rogers was standing on his porch, heaving and contemplating: Are ghosts real?
Eventually.
Surrounded by little moans that slowly faded away, Steve sat there, going numb both bodily and mentally until the daylight mixed with the lamp he had no energy to turn off.
“What was that doll??” Steve crowds up behind him, placing his hands, strategically, on Tony’s waist, his lips ghosting Tony’s neck,  “somethin’ about,” the shell of his ear, “proving something to me.”
Tony pushes the plate out of the way and moves over to kiss him, “Only took me half a day.”
Steve pointed to the sign over the entrance, saying Captain’s Petting Zoo in big bold letters tentatively, “Is this? What is this?”
Steve.
And still, their hands were interlocked over Tony’s shoulder, where Steve had wrapped his arm over, and his hold was the gentlest.
The similarities were there though. Steve couldn’t stand unfairness. Howard used to say Captain America had started out with a kid who always stood up to bullies and never knew how to back down, before the obsession and the alcohol, before, when Tony was just old enough to understand.
Just when he is about to fall asleep, he realizes. Iron Man really did hit him with a hexagonal beam. He made something. Huh. Shit.
Goose just honks again.
“You can’t mod an online game-”
Rats!! Oh no!
The mushrooms got bigger and bigger as he walked. The foliage was so thick, if this was a regular forest there would be no way Tony would be able to see where he was going. He had no idea how there was even a path this deep.
The map maker that greets him is both overwhelming and exciting. There is basically everything. Or seems like it to Steve. He has never really dabbled in modding but then again this is more like a tool pack. And basic things, he can figure out after a little fiddling.
“No!”
Iron Man laughs.
or i assume
Steve laughs, and gets both of their toothbrushes, “I did not say you were, nor did I insinuate that.”
The goose doesn’t turn around. Naturally, since geese would never admit to understanding something as pathetic as spoken language.
Steve balks, “Did you just- Did you hack my game files?”
“Tony.”
Funny how pigs went crazy for blood.
They had went to three different pig farms over two weeks. Coolers in the back of a truck, shoes two sizes bigger on their feet. It was almost like the pigs had known they were coming, lining up by the pen in anticipation, their cute pink snouts sniffing the air.
Steve’s face twisted.
“I don’t know how to be a king!”
“Base shots? Thirty six?”
Steve lowered the gun, looking at Tony in confusion.
Now that he was found, battered and bruised but not dead, there was going to be a week or so where Obie wouldn’t be so strict with him. He had been almost fatally alcohol poisoned once. And once after that he had almost overdosed on cocaine.
But the other stuff? No way.
Steve blushed at that, “Yes, and he is making a- Ugh,” he laughed, “A computer that makes his coffee for him.”
“Well, keep holding that to your wrist. If you need anything else, just call out boys, alright?”
It isn’t until Tony catches the fat feathery fury of hell making off with an entire bundle of fiber optic cable that he fully recognizes the extent of the crimes committed by this goose.
The Omega nodded imperceptibly.
Steve looked down, bashful, his anger seemingly forgotten, “I can’t remember the last time someone was worried about me.
If Steve had closed his eyes, he would have said here, someone is crying right here, beside me.
“He’s not lovesick Tony, also you know how to swim.”
Tony looked around, there really was nobody around. He had crossed a couple runners, a trio of yogis in various states of stretchiness. But the more he advanced in his path, the less and less frequent people had become. And now he was all alone.
Tony had told himself that he would try to make it seem like it was a coincidence if he got caught snooping. Obie was from the Howard Stark school of there is no such thing as coincidence though so that might not have worked but still, he had done it anyway.
“Hey, no, it’s alright,” Tony reached for him.
New landline, no cameras, no WiFi, everything closed circuit .
“r u doing quests rn, can i join”
“We could just go to bed, stay in, watch a movie.”
The genius slouches back in his chair, looking between his friend and his phone, “It’s Hammer tech, they’re making the same advances as Howard did in the eighties. Mind-blowingly numb!”
Steve’s mind didn’t work that way. He swayed in the darkness, ruined wall and crying Omega still right in front of him.
Steve is unable to determine what exactly he’s feeling. Accomplished because he realized something before about the game no one else did? Well, two things. The rocks and the Iron Man. Proud because he actually wanted to see what kind of designs he would come up with? Cared for because Iron Man remembered his condition? Important, at least to Iron Man, because he’s taken Steve’s comments to heart and actually had taken action about improving game design?
Tony would stay at that little apartment for forever, but he has to go home at some point so that Obie wouldn’t come looking after him. Obie never really looked for him before when he spent the night somewhere else, but then again back then he knew Tony was with Ty, that Ty dragged him wherever he went.
But they were just suspicions. Strong ones, Tony knew, but no real evidence. He also suspected that Fury knew about the things Obie and Stone had done, both to Tony and S.I. so maybe he, like him and Steve, just couldn’t quite bring himself to care.
“Sweetcheeks! Surprise date time!” Tony threw himself onto the bed beside Steve, who was lounging with a book in his hand after breakfast.
He had ran to his ensuite and puked whatever junk he had eaten for dinner, then went back to watching with shaking hands and an aching throat.
Tony looked at him, calculating, “Well, you know we can send him back ourselves. We definitely do have the money for that, if the owners are already troubled.”
“So weak,” Steve’s lips trailed his jaw with a gentleness that contrasted the vice of his arms, found his lips, planted little whispers of kisses, “I’d do anything for you. Anything.”
Rustling noises came from the tree, no one peaked out behind it. ‘Have I been discovered?’ thought Steve. Wouldn’t be surprising in this tower.
He had made Steve angry. You have to get used to that, said Tony to himself as he started remote data collection as he changed, knowing you, probably won’t be the last time he’ll be angry at you. Still, it was hard to hear his strained voice directed at him.
“Well, are you going to call me Tony?”
Deciding on a grid pattern over the largest empty wall, Steve picked up a couple nails in his mouth. He laid his hand on the wall. Soft. Steve pushed. Cushiony. He ran his hands over the expanse of the walls. Were they insulated? Stone hadn’t talked about anything like that. But it was almost like the walls were covered in layers.
“Tony?”
How could they do that? How could they have done that? He had been drifting, slipping in and out of uncontrollable rage. Hiding had become harder after that, but then again, he had been caring less and less about that.
“Obie?”
Maybe it was better he didn’t go back.
I am hallucinating, Steve told himself. This isn’t real.
Tony claps his hands and quickly lays out the table, he grabs an extra water bottle for his supersoldier boyfriend who drinks unnecessary amounts of water per day.
Steve perked up as the tree shook once more, as if someone was fiddling with the branches. They did have incidents with baubles before. One memorable time, Thor had superglued little jelly dicks onto the tree, claiming that his research on human customs yielded the result that phallic forms were used throughout history to represent prosperity. The poor tree still had bald spots left from that day.
“With all due respect, my assistance is required.”
He coded until morning and then some. His focus seemed fragile. Normally he would be in the zone, deep enough that he wouldn’t hear if a bomb went off beside him but this time he was disconnected from the world by a soap bubble that threatened to pop and let the panic sink in the moment he quit working. I have to be useful. In the end though, exhaustion had consumed him.
Simultaneously, “Oh fuck,” Tony says.
“Brushing our teeth?” Tony furrows his brows.
And it’s good. It makes Steve ache a little because he would like to have this outside of the game too. He cannot be sure if he’s projecting his feelings onto Iron Man but he feels like Iron Man is having fun. They do just stand around, idle, and talk about nothing.
It wasn’t only Obie who could throw money at his problems and make them disappear. He turned off his systems and closed his laptop, Tony knew what he was good for.
“It’s not selfish. Steve, I’m here and fuck- He- Obie relocated the files of- The security footage from the first night. He knows. I mean, I don’t know if he knows it’s me but he knows something, Steve I-”
The house had gotten colder, thanks to the windows he had left open to let the smell out. But that was the only reason why Steve could feel the minute difference between his right and left side.
Oh he will eat raw sausages though, no hesitation whatsoever.
“We’ll do a couple layovers. We’ll act like we were already gone. By the time someone gets suspicious we’ll have ten thousand alibis. I’m good at the show off boyfriend act, you’ll see.”
He sits there, looking at his computer screen, trying to understand what just happened. Then he gives up. Closes the game. Turns off his computer and slowly makes his way back to his bed.
Pepper slides on her heels, “I can vouch for that.”
The connection sizzles, cuts off. Steve knows there is almost no way Tony heard him. There is also no reason for him to come and rescue Steve. Not after what happened. Not after the fights. Not after the one too many clashing opinions. For all Steve knows those could have been shit said in the heat of the moment.
“Is that an offer to cook for me?” Steve leans forward too, challenging him, the cheeky glint in his eyes sparkling under the glowing lights.
“Steve?”
Tony rubbed his clammy hands on his pants. He could take Stone but if someone came to check the voices he’d be fucked. If there was anyone in the mansion, at that. Stone was still droning on his villain monologue.
The day was swelteringly hot. But you can shed clothes. Steve has nothing but his slightly damp stealth gear leeching even more heat from his body, instead of keeping him warm.
He would make this house feel like home. One step at a time.
And then Steve had ran away.
Pepper laughs, and takes her stuff as they get to the elevator, they exchange pleasantries and end with a kiss on the cheek as she leaves.
That didn’t change the fact that he was a mess though. All throughout the process of sneaking back out of the mansion, on the taxi, there was just one thing on his mind, almost pushing him to the edge: I was supposed to be useful.
He slumps. The guy lives fifteen minutes away. He really couldn’t have come up with a more offensive way of returning the stuff and making the situation even more uncomfortable. He could even add a note. Hey remember how rudely I turned you down the first time we met? Well I still don’t want to see your face, just so you know.
Tony scoffed, “Yeah sure, of course there are rabbits! What kind of petting zoo-”
Grudgingly, he had to admit there was an eerie beauty to the morning light streaming through the mist. Not quite foggy yet, but there was a blur to everything. But then again, that could have been the lack of sleep on Tony’s part too. Dew covered the  grass like a glossy coating. The smell of it was enough to keep him awake and on the path, reminding him what he was about to do. Excitement fluttered in his stomach, something between childish glee and desire.
Complimenting Steve’s cute little beanie had worked, definitely.
“Maybe you should take a vacation, huh?” Obie had said, “Get away from the concrete jungle a little bit, unwind a little after- After everything.”
“In my defense Sirs, I was about to,” JARVIS sounded amused.
Not that that had stopped the guy.
It is the sausages. They are not only burnt, but also smoking.
“Oh for fuck’s sake! Will you keep repeating that? Because I will need you to sign an NDA at this rate.”
And Steve hates to wait himself, but there is really nothing else left to do.
It had taken years to find their footing, with Tony taking over the company and Steve trying to let go of past hurts and them learning to be together after the initial high of their relationship mellowed. It had been good, back then, to just be the two of them as Tony Stark the genius and the C.E.O. of Stark Industries and his elusive boyfriend.
Before he could lose whatever was left of his courage, Tony bent over and kissed the frog on top of his head.
He had wondered if Steve would pick up on what he was saying but he did. He seemed sheepish; still, he was not secretive when talking to Tony about someone he killed. Tony didn’t know why that made him happy, but it did.
“Who?”
Steve pressed a kiss onto his shoulder, “What’s that?”
Steve groaned, turning away in mock indignancy. Tony laughed at his antics. They would be just fine.
oh you’re far away from me, you’re far away from me
i’ve been watching from the rooftop
And anywhere else, in any other place but in Steve’s arms, he would have acted like it was a nonchalant kind of carelessness. But here, he could admit that no one ever cared about him and he didn’t care about them. Tony was familiar with being used for money, sex, access. The sparkliest of the necklaces and cufflinks, the biggest bottle of vodka with the best cocaine in the city, clubs and penthouses with beds that covered half the room…
“I don’t have a phone.” What? What?! If there was ever a good time for a meteor to fall onto me and just onto me, now is it, Tony thinks.
Just restless.
Steve looked at him, the fold between his eyebrows were back. Then he slowly leaned in and pressed his lips to the corner of Tony lips. They traveled along his smooth cheek, pressed against his ear. Steve whispered, “I’d say I want to kill him for what he did to you, what he let happen,  but then again death would be too easy.”
“Will you sign the NDA?”
“Shh,” Tony couldn’t take it anymore, he got up, closing the distance between them, the acrid smell burning his nose, “Steve, let me help you baby, let’s get you out of these, huh?”
It was a surreal experience, showering with Steve. It hadn’t been something Tony ever fantasized about, though, to be fair, he wouldn’t know what to imagine if he had fantasized. But not this, never this.
Aimless chaos, that’s what it is.
They both sit in silence for a second as Steve realizes he can actually do many things with this information. Then the NDA appears in front of him. Steve clicks “I accept,” after barely skimming it.
It just hadn't seemed real until he heard it from another person’s mouth; Tiberius Stone is dead.
Tony pouts and creates a hologram, placing his phone down, “I’m stuck Pep.”
“I-” the changeling cleaned his throat, “I’m sorry for being late. I felt you coming this way and I hopped as quick as I could but- Uh- I’m a little small and I get tired a lot, so-”
Apart from him.
“May I say how I rejoice in the fact, I do not need sustenance to survive.”
Tony didn’t want to be hopeful though. He… Kind of wanted to curl up and cry at this point.
The room was way too bright for that, morning light spilling in. Tony shivered.
Tony knows Steve will come over after he’s done teaching kids how to draw and will give him as many kisses as he wants and then a little bit more. He will cook because Tony really cannot but helps by providing any ingredient Steve needs for his recipes, no matter how obscure. They will sit in Tony’s little kitchen and chat and eat and kiss a little bit more. And when Steve gets up to go home, his overgrown duck with itsy-bitsy razor teeth will follow him back home loyally.
He giggles and lays back down, this time, resting his head on Steve’s chest. “You know, all dopey, and love-sick. Everyone knows, it’s when you look at people you love. Meaning me.” He grins and looks up at him.
“Well, I make it,” Tony runs a hand through his hair, “I quit drinking a while ago, like, completely cold turkey, you cannot imagine how much of a businessman’s life is just standing around and drinking when there are hundreds of other people doing the business part for you. Coffee?”
Iron Man squeaks and sputters, “I mean- I could be? Sometimes maybe I am? Maybe I am right now? How is- I mean- Humans right? Am I even human? I survive on coffee and goji berries. Exclusively. Can a human do that?”
“And let Obie win? Take the company and do whatever he wants with shit that has my name on it?”
A deep blush covers Steve’s face, “You think I can’t hold my own?”
“But your- Your weirdness was never a turn-off Steve. You’re weird? I’m weird! Do you know how many of my dates just got up and left because I- Well, I can’t remember what I talked about in any of those occasions, probably something tech related but- I mean, you listened to a lecture about Dum-E! And it was a lecture, really, I shouldn’t have talked for that long, I’m still sorry-”
He can’t help it. He laughs.
The days refuse to pass. Thursday is a blur. He’s at the school but his mind is elsewhere. Even Steve doesn’t know where. He forgets the graded designs from his students at home and just tells them everyone got an A. Because why not. He’s the teacher, he can do whatever he wants and then goes on a tangent about how art is about expressing yourself and that part cannot be graded.
Steve comes back to his house and his incriminating balled up papers, hiding and evading the town people throughout the whole way. And he’s already having a freak-out about just how much he has overshared in what was supposed to be a tiny note saying “Hey, I have your things I think, would you like to pick them up or would you like me to bring them over.”
They get out of the boss arena for the first time, to fuck around in the game. It’s an experience.
“Yes Mr, Rogers, we were waiting for you. Mr. Stark is ready to see you, if you please take the elevator-”
“Oh my God!”
Tony was scared shitless, to say the least.
They travel around the map. TheCaptain’s fame travels with them. Iron Man keeps poking him about it and it’s good. It’s, well, it’s just like playing with an actual friend. They take some notes about what kind of health items, drops and environmental clues could be used in the upcoming boss. Iron Man likes Steve’s idea that back to back phases should be from wildly different but previously traversed areas, so that it will be both challenging and not boring.
Here, it felt a little bit disrespectful, subconsciously, taping up his sketches on someone else’s walls carelessly.
That- Tony shivered. He hugged Steve’s arm. Steve smiled down at him. They walked in silence after that, world around them getting quieter as they left the streets lined with cafes and shops and made their way into the housing dense areas.
He also learns that Iron Man doesn’t really have that much free time and has many other responsibilities and that’s why many things are automated even though he exists. Though he gives away that whatever is controlling Iron Man when his human is not around is much better than any other regular AI.
So Tony definitely expects a broken glass or two. Or a plate. Spilled coffee. It’s bound to happen.
“Sure, let’s roll,” Iron Man puts up a shielding spell around them, “But I- I know what you mean, Cap. Real world selves come with baggage.”
But no Steve had to go and be all hopelessly romantic and embarrassing and overshare. At least he didn’t outright say stuff like your eyes are beautiful or you’re really confident and I don’t know how to talk to you or… Yeah.
Steve knew the moment the Omega’s chin started to tremble, he was already gone. He didn’t know where to start. He didn’t know what they would do, where they would go from here, come morning.
Tony smiled at him, then the idea struck, “Greatest gift of all time?”
He got defensive and well… Some needlessly rude things had been said and assumptions had been made. By Steve. Because Steve is great at acting without thinking apparently.
He has no idea why or what he's doing this for.
“Tony,” Steve breathed his name against his lips, “I used to live day by day. After,” he sighs, “everything. Everyone I knew died. their memories faded from everywhere but my mind, I just- The fucking rage- Sorry.” He apologized and squirmed, looking like he couldn’t find the words but Tony felt like he knew what was coming. He had accepted it already. I’m yours, he wanted to say, you can say it too. But he waited for Steve to collect his thoughts.
Steve pulled out almost completely before fucking into him again. Tony clenched around him, his body still unresponsive. It only took a couple pumps for Steve’s cock to start twitching inside him. He slumped almost completely over Tony.
And to think Tony had stolen them just in case. Just in case.
Sleep addled, Steve reached out a hand, unthinking, and touched the wall.
Tony had gotten rusty. Dealing with Ty, trying to forget that he existed while he was just there hadn’t been good to his brain. But Ty was gone and he was still here and that had to mean something.
“Nah,” Steve grabbed the little Iron Tsum and placed him on his shoulder, “I woke up hungry and we’re out of milk upstairs in the mini-fridge so-”
Which is an exhilarating thought as it is frightening.
Along the kitchen wall, Steve positioned himself. He could hear it now. One step, two steps. Wait. Listen. Just one step until it was right in front of him.
He reached into the cracked wall, gently pulling the Omega through the splintered wood.
“Nothing,” he whispers, his eyes don’t meet Steve’s, just to make this more ridiculous, his face is flushed deep red, an almost ironic way to how Steve blushes.
“No Jarvis, 89th floor please.”
Was the smell embedded into whatever the wall padding was? But who had scared an Omega that bad? For the smell to sink in like that. That permanently.
Obie had stood up to leave, turned around, then pointed to a covered platter sitting on his side table, “I had some food brought up while you were sleeping, the pot stickers with the crab filling that you liked. It must have gone cold by now but heat it up, yeah,” he had patted his shoulder, bending over to reach him, alarmingly close, “eat something real for a change.”
“No! I will roast you for Thanksgiving! Hell, I will roast you for a completely insignificant mid-week lunch you-” Tony stands back up as the surprisingly agile goose makes it off with his screwdriver, ducking under the table as it runs away. For the third time that day.
"I'm sorry," says Steve, pink all over. "I don't know what came over me, I'm sorry. It won't happen again."
The silence was deafening.
That seemed to shake off whatever had came onto Steve for a second, he lifted his head, incredulous, “He is your godfather?”
“Those are not rocks? Those are crystals,” Iron Man adds through the “You died!” screen.
“And, well, uh- I’m Tony,” he sticks out his hand.
The owner of the goat thanked them a million times on the phone for handling the animal and returning him themselves. Tony had Pepper deal with the transportation and such, considering she was much more knowledgeable than him about, yes, even animal transportation. Because who knew you couldn’t send livestock with a private jet. Not Tony, definitely. He asked her to make a small donation to the goat farm and please, for the love of God, to call an expert cleaning and decontamination service for the common area.
The white gold crown sat heavily on Steve’s head. It was identical to Tony’s yellow gold one. They both had rubies adorning the folds and twists of the precious metals.
Tony slaps his ass on the way out and grins before heading back to the kitchen and getting started on breakfast.
Or, maybe he can just mail it!
hey there my dear captain, i’ve been maudlin far too often
The forest wants you to be here, a hopeful voice in his head said, it wants you to keep walking on.
A little hiss of clothing, a brush against the walls. Just the hint of a sound and he was pulled away from dreamland.
Steve slowly rose from his bed and walked up to the door.
Steve’s character twitches from left to right behind the rock he’s hiding, “Well, I have scoliosis. I either die now or I will actually die because of my back.”
Oh so everyone is in on it. Steve will walk in there and Steve will give that man a piece of his mind because-
Tony didn’t dare move. His head on Steve’s shoulder, one hand carding through the short strands on the nape of his neck; they sat like that long after Steve ran out of things to say. The room got colder and colder as the sun started to set.
All these years and still, no one had connected them to the disappearance of Obie and Stone. Or the previous murders. Tony knew Fury had suspicions, since the day his kidnapping forced Steve to come out of hiding, to reveal himself as Captain America.
“They don’t know me and how I will go on a tangent when it comes to accessibility in gaming, come on.”
The sparkly A they had plopped on top of the tree as a topper fell to the floor. The top branches rustled once again, to reveal… Some kind of blob, precariously trying to find its footing on the slippery plastic needles.
“Yeah, a microphone it seems like,” Tony cringes as soon as the words leave his mouth. Yes Tony, amazing, insert your foot a little bit deeper into your mouth.
It starts with Steve instinctively pushing shit off of Tony's table. Tony wants to show him his new projects, get Steve involved because that's what they're doing now. Getting involved in each other's stuff. Because they are boyfriends.
He’s stalling. He’s stalling so much.
So much that he almost didn’t hear the keys jangling outside the door. He jumped at the sudden click of the lock. A cold gust of air brought the smell of something into the room. Tony pushed his laptop off to the side, blind in the dark after the bright screen.
Steve peeked discreetly from the entryway of the communal floor, trying to see where the rustling noise was coming from. Clint, he assumed, trying to get a glimpse of what other people bought for everyone else to get an idea. He was always the last one to buy gifts and Steve had his theories about why. Or maybe, someone was placing gifts in secret at night.
They laid there in a weird half sandwich until Steve softened. Tony giggled.
Tony steps into the elevator, “JARVIS, get ready for the best food of your life.”
“Tony, did something happen?”
He wanted to jump to action at the whisper, take Steve into his arms, rid him of his soiled shirt but held himself back, “Yes baby,” he got up, but didn’t go any closer, “What do you need?”
The “You died!” screen fades. Loading screen takes its place and in seconds, Steve is transported back to the lobby.
“But, no, it’s not an offer babe.” He wipes his mouth with his napkin and stands up. “I can cook, I don’t need to prove anything.” Gathering up the rest of the dishes, he heads over to the kitchen and places them into the dishwasher.
And then he thinks, maybe, maybe it really could. Yup, this is definitely going to be the best way of testing the waters. Steve is a genius.
“I legally bought this house from-” he couldn’t bring himself to say the name, “from him about a week ago.”
“Look all I’m saying is that that can’t be healthy is all.”
With some of his older painted canvases and canvas prints under one arm and a hammer in one hand, Steve came back down. He placed everything on his couch and looked around consideringly. This was a good idea. The only good idea he had since moving in, honestly. No wonder he couldn’t paint. His muses did not surround him here. He didn’t feel at home.
Tony grinns giddily. Okay, maybe he’s a little head over heels here but at least he knows he’s not the only one.
“Then why did you- What happened?”
The worst part is, Iron Man doesn’t stop talking. It had been what threw Steve off for the first half of the fight. Iron Man doesn’t seem to have pre-existing dialogue. He responds to Steve.
If Tony was asked if he was crying, then he would deny it, he was absolutely not crying! His glossy eyes and streaked face would perhaps say differently, “I want all that too. And so much more. And I always get what I want.”
“Did you recognize me? That day?,” Tony had asked.
Steve laughs, honest to God laughs at him and his misery on the phone, “Like you know how to cook.”
“Tony?” Steve tried to be gentler.
He reached over to smooth the crease between Steve’s eyebrows, “You’re not doing this out of obligation or anything, right? I mean we can just- I don’t know. Stay here. Be free-range superheroes or something.”
He does trim his beard though. Looking put together never hurt anybody. Definitely a plus, if you’re going to see the guy you’ve had a crush on for over a month. For the second time. After a total fucking disaster.
“Yeah,” Tony’s heart was beating double time, “I am. Steve,” he pulled back to look into Steve’s eyes, pupils dilated, they only left a thin ring of that sky blue irises, “I’m yours and you’re mine and that’s exactly why I’m going to keep deleting information off of state databases.” He pressed a kiss, very lightly, to Steve’s lips, feeling his hitched breath on his own mouth, “So tell me where you’ve been, baby.”
He had almost went victim to homicide, not to mention Obie thought him and Ty were a thing by mutual choice. So in his eyes, he had also lost his boyfriend. Well, good riddance.
Steve had immediately left the apartment, coming over to deal with the mess, berating himself about leaving Tony alone. He had pressed his lips to Tony’s forehead, neck, over his pulse right at the door, engulfing him in his arms, “Never again, you’re not dealing with anything by yourself again.”
He checked his pocket to find his phone and wallet untouched. 27 missed calls from Obie. He’d deal with that in a minute.
He had lost everyone. It was hard to talk about, for him, and Tony didn’t want to push but he could see it in Steve’s eyes. Everyone had left him. He wanted to follow them too.
Tony shifts on his chair, “Okay, so, I am planning on making a- A security system, but also like, a smart house software but not like those that open and close your lights from your phone, something that will monitor the entire house, keep track of everything that comes in and leaves, connected to the internet and satellite and- Well, yeah.”
Tony locked himself into the basement with his computers after his next encounter with Obie. Even thinking about it made his skin crawl, but he couldn’t even explain what bothered him so much. Still, everything Obie did started to grate on his nerves. Everything he did and said kept playing over and over in his head as he laid in bed at night; every second he got distracted, he remembered that the video that was still in Obie’s hard drive.
He goes all the way back to his high school sketches. He gets lost browsing through things he couldn’t finish before his surgery, back when his scoliosis was giving him more trouble. He’s surprised to see he still feels an interest, looking through his sketches of elven archers that are definitely not Legolas but brunette.
“You won’t! I promise you, Steve, just, yeah. I love you. I will love you with your cat ears and tail too. Honestly, I’m just more worried that Pepper will faint when she hears that you’re the Crown Prince. It’s a bit of an organizational nightmare for any future occasions we want to attend to, I guess.”
Well… Tony had to kiss the frog if he wanted to be able to talk. But then again, that would tie the changeling frog to him. Maybe he could run away. Or he could stay here, never kiss the frog. And… Whatever happened would happen.
He listened all night for another clue of a sound, laid in bed with the whisper of a smell in his nose. Vanilla, underneath it all.
it will be like we never fought again
He wanted to lift his head, to push him away. But his head bobbed up and down with Ty’s manhandling, hitting and scraping against the asphalt against his will. His hands felt like static, his legs didn’t listen to him. What did you give me, you motherfucker. Tony wanted to scream but his mouth just leaked more vomit and spit against his will. I’m going to choke and die, Tony thought, I’m going to die with my pants down in an alley. His head swam.
Steve with his straw blond hair translucent at the tips under pale sunlight, with his clenched jaw and  icy blue eyes shadowed under his creased brows.
Tony spoke gently, “You can, like, not answer this if you don’t want to. Like, you can- I mean, you don’t have to answer anything you don’t want to, obviously, but-” He bit his lip, “Do you- How was Howard when you had met him?”
He braced himself. Carefully turning the knob, Steve pulled the door open, made his way downstairs.
Tony was allowed to go crazy at this point. He was allowed this frenzy, surely.
Tony wasn’t really scared of someone prosecuting Captain America of murder, really. He was more concerned with the fact that Captain America had gone of the radar, and was willingly living like a homeless person instead of reaping the benefits of… Well… Being Captain America.
For some reason, that didn’t sit right with him.
Steve, at least, seems mollified, “I’m really sorry. It’s just that- They’re there and I just-”
“Tony.”
Tony pouts, “I’m not a child,” he crosses his arms over his chest.
“But the smell-”
“Wow.”
Nothing but a mattress in the room.
And oh God, his back. His fucking back.
Steve and him… It feels like they have a once in a lifetime thing going on. Tony, at this point, is quite sure that Steve is the one. Whether it’s when it’s Tony losing the track of time with projects, Steve agonizing over correspondances, arguing about the balance of keeping their relationship private from the public but not really a secret from their friends and family…
He looked at the code he had abandoned years ago. A self learning security system. God. He could have finished a working draft of it when he was seventeen but no. Obie had said it was impossible. Obie had said it was too ambitious. Obie had said that he should lean more towards engineering rather than coding. Obie, Obie, Obie…
“You’ll have to forgive my shoddy work with the wallpaper,” Stone said as the movers brought in last of Steve’s boxes and piled them up in the living room, “I had to change them once- Well, after I lost my Omega.”
“You’re not an AI.”
hey cap i can promise you, the next time i lay eyes on you
Tony laughed, moving into the kitchen, “I could dunk a couple of cookies into milk.”
All right, maybe he could let go of the bananas. The little dude, or dudette, has probably already demolished what was supposed to be Tony’s attempt at starting healthy eating habits three weeks ago.
Stone handed him the keys, shook his hand and left in a sleek black car. The moving company took his signature for the last paperwork and drove off.
Steve squinted at the screen of his phone, “I don’t know. Last time I had a phone, they still had buttons.”
Tony slowly lost the time. Steve’s tempo never faltered. It felt like they actually been in bed for the entire day, Steve fucking him for forever now, but also as if he had just started. When he came for a second time, it was slow and long. Heat coiled in his belly, slowly spread around his body as his cock pulsed, pressed against the pillow under his hips with Steve’s weight. He shook, feeling the force of it in the back of his throat. He couldn’t breathe.
“You’re up! Not that I don’t love your morning voice, but go freshen up!” He heads over and pecks Steve’s lips, “I’m making breakfast!” Tony grins and brushes Steve’s hair back from his forehead, “Pancakes, gotta keep my eyes on the prize baby.”
Steve pops another one in his mouth, fake guilt on his face, “We have enough.”
This, thought Tony, I cannot lose this.
“Did you just give me the biggest tip ever or am I hearing things?”
Barely eating. Almost never sleeping. Having no thoughts other than the thoughts of death and pain, he was at the end of his resolve here.
That Howard’s files were still in this mansion. They were protected but Obie still had a right to everything with the name Stark on it for another year. Until Tony turned twenty one, he basically owned nothing.
And weeks, no scratch that, years of fear from Ty, Obie’s straight out dismissal of everything he had done to Tony, every hurt he had compartmentalized, that he had bottled up and put on the shelf came out. Tony put his face into Steve’s chest and cried like he hasn't in years.
They both throw their heads back in laughter, “We should head back to work now.” Steve stands up, keeping Tony in his arms, he gently lowers them so Tony can stand. “I’ll get your stuff.” The man heads towards their bedroom, grabbing his own jacket as well as the many things Tony carries around.
Steve lifted one eyebrow. His hand on the armrest was ready to rip apart the upholstery.
They enter the elevator. And then the elevator speaks, “Miss. Potts, Mr. Rogers; to the penthouse, I assume?”
Oh Gods! Tony panicked. This was not a dream. This was not a dream and he was going to be king and here was his consort and he had just offered to carry him.
He talked about Howard and how he remembered him to be. He talked about Dr. Erskine, who would only be the first person on the long list of loved ones Steve would lose in the years to come after the serum. He talked about Peggy. Tony could still remember Aunt Peg, even if the memories were hazy. Still, Steve was happier, after Tony told his own tales about her no bullshit attitude and the times she spent with him when he was little.
He was so close now, he could almost pinpoint the place the tinkering was coming from. A little below his waistline, as if someone’s hands were feeling along the planes of wood that made the house.
and our friends make fun of me, but i can laugh along you see
It was there. Then it was not.
“Okay! Fine! Why are you shouting?”
Alas, he’s an art teacher with scoliosis. And his love for games did spurr his interest in art and character design. It did open a new world to him, in which he built the career he loves now. Still...
“HONK!”
“hewwooo!!”
Unfortunately, his reputation had preceded him, even after Tony had chosen a quieter life. Less alcohol, less women, less men, less… Everything.
Tony sat up in bed and pulled his laptop bag to himself. If he was going to wait, at least he could be useful while he waited. Opening his interpreter, he got to work.
“No, Steve,” Tony sighed, “Do you really think you hadn’t left any of your blood on Ty?” he felt Steve tense underneath him, arms locking in their constrictive embrace, “Babe, I had your back from the start.”
“You shouldn’t have come here,” he grabbed Tony’s wrist, “You shouldn’t be around me. Especially you.”
They stand there for a moment. Just holding hands and looking at each other with smiling eyes. But it’s okay. Tony thinks it is. Yes, they had lost many good sausages and possibly half of the frittata muffins but his relationship is intact. And that is all that matters.
Tony was stranded and desperate. He wanted that known. It wasn’t like he went around kissing frogs on the regular. Nope.
“I’m joking!” Tony raises his brows,  “Wait, why are you scared?”
“This was fun,” says Tony. The setting sun paints them both gold. “You’re hired!”
Steve looked at him with an unreadable expression on his face, “Are there rabbits also?”
They look at each other for a moment, then Iron Man, well, Tony breaks down laughing, which in turn makes Steve laugh. Maybe it’s a bit of a manic laugh on both of their parts but it is a laugh nevertheless and it breaks the ice.
“He seemed like a sweet boy,” the nosy woman had said, “he didn’t come out much, only with Tiberius. He was quite shy, I guess, but they looked so good together. Fit so well, was a shame, really.”
Something as responsive as Iron Man is just… Fun to mess with.
Tangibly real with scarred knuckles, right hand visibly swollen, darker than the left one.
Tony sputters, phone in hand and eyes locked onto the little criminal currently pat-pat-ing greasy footprints all over his beautiful and once clean car. With a harmonica in its beak.
Tony laughs, “When did you get so snippy.”
Steve took a deep breath.
It rang and rang and rang, then a sleepy voice was on the line, “T-ny?”
“An A.I. Steve, the coffee thing was just an example. Artificial intelligence and all from scratch, I might add,” Tony took a bite of his cinnamon roll, “I have no idea why I thought I could mix like C++, Python and Prolog. It doesn’t even make sense.”
“Uh… Alright,” Iron Man drawls, “different how?”
He was standing on the edge of his sanity, ready to fall. He couldn’t sleep. He couldn’t go out. What felt like an escape, now meant his mind staying back home while his body moved, his rationality thinning out the further away he got.
Steve gave him another glass of water.
And now he was trying to send Tony away. Tony had been realizing he was getting more and more separated from SI every passing year but he hadn’t cared then.
“I can-”
They laid like that as they came down, Steve still half splayed over Tony, still sucking whatever skin he could reach and Tony playing with the frankly ridiculous amount of come soaking through his clothes, rubbing it into his skin.
“And I understood so much, I understood that I want to live with you, I want to marry you, I want to wake up by your side every day, and I know we already do most of those things, but I just know, that you’re going to be in my future, no matter what.”
How long until he slipped?
“No,” Tony picks up a shallot, cutting into it, “they cannot be. You get your mini sausages and I get my frittatas. It's a compromise.”
“I’m Tony.”
“I cannot be sure if you’re underestimating yourself or overestimating the entire world. Also, please, take the Hand and let’s roll, better drop won’t materialize in your inventory the more you scroll.”
All of it had been a daze.
Did ghosts remember danger? The way they went or got stuck in between? What would scare somebody, if they were already dead? Could ghosts still feel pain?
“I quite like cooking for you though,” he looks up into Steve’s eyes, “Thank you for this, it’s all truly wonderful.”
“I just got you, please, Tony. I just found you, please no.”
It took him ten hours to hack into the databases untracked. Three days to connect him to other cases. Another week to find him, head low with a tattered sketchpad under his arm, living out of a duffle bag.
Steve whips his head up, pointing at his screen, “You’re human!”
They both bent instinctively towards Tony’s ringing phone as Obie’s name lit up the screen. Cold anxiety coiled in his stomach, leaving no trace of the loving warmth of the day. Tony’s eyes immediately went to Steve, no matter what Steve said about not being worried about him, Tony’s fear was not for himself but him.
And that was all the encouragement Tony needed really.
“Nope. Not attached at all,” Tony had looked at Stone’s lifeless body, laying on the ground before him, “And tell me about it. Do you think I can dismember a body with a kitchen carver?”
“Baby,” Tony ran his hands up and down Steve’s back as far as he could reach, “Let me go see what they want. Let me find out what they’re up to. Maybe it’s nothing. But if not, we have each other’s back, right?”
“Steve,” Tony snuck up a hand through his embrace, caressing his rough cheek, “I’m okay, I’m alright, I- I couldn’t talk in the house, I was- Obie could-”
Steve smiles at him, bringing his other hand to their clasped ones, “I like that too. I didn’t want it to change. I- I don’t know why I thought it would. I don’t know. It all seems so silly right now.”
After a few dozen broken eggs, flour on most of the counters and on his forehead, Tony manages to present a stack of pancakes to Steve. Drizzled with maple syrup and too many berries, but Tony made it, so it was his choice.
No one had seen Stone’s Omega in the last three years. Because Tony had been dead for the last three years. For three years, people came inside the house, talked to Stone, shook his hand, made small talk with him and felt sorry about this poor lonely Alpha who had lost his-
In the end, Tony had to move his legs, “Ow,” he moved his toes that fell asleep in his shoes, making them wiggle. Steve turned, wrapping an arm around Tony, he pulled him into his chest.
It had been a little cringy for Steve to watch the interviews where the usual magazine reporters who knew jack shit about games tried to make sense of a billionaire’s love for something they saw so menial.
21st century had been a big jumble of confusion and loneliness for Steve. There was very little left that he still understood and there was no one, but absolutely no one left that he remembered. Then Tony had came.
Light suddenly filled the room, temporarily blinding him again. Tony blinked. His heart clenched at the sight when his eyes adjust.
“I’m just saying,” Iron Man presses on, “at some point, the game will need fresh ideas Cap. This is an online game, that’s how it works. Avengers will need innovation in the design department, and if it’s going to come from someone who can actually understand game strategies besides art stuff, I think people would be, you know, interested.”
“Sometimes, I hoped to get caught, it’s hard out there in winter, or,” he had looked out of the window, then back at Tony, “it used to be. Maybe not so much anymore.”
“I’m sure Bucky can help. I mean he did help me keep my identity secret for so long and if he didn’t blurt it out himself, then I’m sure we can just… Ease the media into it.”
Oh my God, Tony wanted to say, I love you, but toned it down for a still enthusiastic affirmation, “Yes, exactly, but for that first one would need to know the language of the program they’re working with, I am making one from scratch.”
They look at each other. Dum-E slowly lowers his pincher, laying the beanie back on Steve’s head on its side.
“Did you leave Obie there in the apartment?”
Both the women smile and laugh at him. “If you weren’t too busy drooling over your boyfriend, you’d know that my girlfriend has an office right outside mine and is my assistant.”
Fuck, Obie had been trying to kill him, “Where is Obie?”
“I will have to think about that.” Steve pulls the blanket closer to them, tucking it right under Tony’s chin.
When he finally decided to get up and put his cock in, Tony was already at the edge of an orgasm, skin hot and too tight, everything oversensitized. It didn’t take more than Steve settling inside him fully for him to come, his cock hot and heavy against his insides, almost pressing his prostate but not quite.
“Seriously?” Now that was surprising.
So Tony gives Steve his number. Steve sends him a text. After a polite goodbye he leaves, clutching his tools to his chest and all but runs back to his house. He throws the bag onto his work table on his way up and immediately goes searching for his phone.
“No, no, no, you should leave. You should have just left, you-”
Tony squints at him, failing to hide his own smile, “Sure, you know me, I can never just have one thought, I’m a man of taste Steven.”
Truly lonely. There was nothing he could go back to now. His home was burned to cinders.
“Great! I’ll answer one question for every ten gold orbs you get out of me. Now let’s start,” and then without waiting, Iron Man fires.
Steve bared his face enough to look at him, his hands revealing a blotchy blush spreading over his face, “You were so beautiful,” his pink patches got suddenly darker.
“You won the competition.”
Steve could have brought home a sickly cat or a dog and they could have kept it. Really, not all of them were always in the tower but there was always someone and that was enough to look after a normal pet. Steve could have fallen in love with anything from a regular old goldfish to exotic tropical fish and Tony would have built him an enormous aquarium overnight. He had no idea what fish needed but there were professional care teams that provided aquariums like that. He’d hire one in a heartbeat for Steve.
Tony shakes Steve’s hand and also his entire world because… What does this even mean?
“Don’t leave.”
His dream, his new beginning, crumbled around him the more he stayed in this place. But God, oh God he couldn’t leave.
For three years Stone had lived in this house where his Omega had died. Had it been finally too much? Did he have enough of looking around and seeing memories everywhere? Or had he stayed deliberately? Had he tried to stay close to the Omega he lost for one more day, telling himself this would be the last every time he woke up, only to find himself going to bed without posting an ad?
Tony hadn’t been able to leave with him that night maybe; but he had left with a phone number and a promise to have coffee. Just coffee. Really. Nothing else.
“How did you find me?”
All the kings and queens of Starkia went into the forest to find their life long partner. The true changeling would find their way to the king or queen-to-be. Changelings were magic. The forest was magic. No matter how deep it got, the sunlight was always visible. Colors were vibrant. Flowers always bloomed. It was made ions ago, to tie the humans and the magical creatures. To fall in love.
He tried to tell himself Obie could have moved or deleted the file simply because that kind of shit was incriminating to have. Maybe it had nothing to do with Tony. Maybe he had no idea Tony had ever been in his files. Maybe he really just wanted Tony to be there for a dinner with the father of his deceased boyfriend and that was all in his eyes.
But Tony had gotten him these. It was before Steve had drilled into his head that sentimental gifts held more value to him then expensive ones but this had been Tony’s sentimental back when they were young and naive. Much later Steve had learned that Tony had put them there himself. Welding and all...
He got into the apartment on the edge of tears, hands fumbling with the keys. He opened the door, only to be swallowed up by another body, arms coming around him, vice tight.
“Oh,” Steve shuffled closer, “really?”
It doesn’t cover the two orange tabby cat ears.
“I mean it would but, anyway, the compiler I made for that is trash now. That’s sad. But I’m working on a new one, the interpreter doesn’t even feel forced, would you believe it, making shit up is easier than trying to stick other people’s shit together and hope it would work, no offence but I have special make-shit-up powers,” Tony wiggled his brows over his coffee cup.
Now, Tony from a couple years ago had been more, uncontrollably impulsive. He would have bought a goat, stuck a red bow on its head and three days later gone crazy because he had no idea what to do with a goat. Nevermind the fact that goats cannot live indoors. They had just confirmed that.
He swung the cleaver with all his strength but Stone caught up to his plan half way. Still, it was clear the moment a gleaming meat cleaver had lodged itself into his forearm to the bone, he had been expecting to be hit by something much duller. He screamed.
“I can explain it.”
It was Steve who broke the silence, “I don’t want them to touch you.”
“You think I don’t have an alibi? You think we didn’t disable the cameras in here? Let everyone out early like the benevolent employers that we are?” He chuckled, “No one,” Stone opened his arms to the sides, “no one saw me coming in.”
“Yeah?”
“It’s fine,” Tony flashed a quick smile, “It’s nothing, really,” he could feel Steve’s eyes on him as he lifted his ice bag to make room for their food.
“Ribi-ribbit!”
“Ah- Yea,” Iron Man sounds… He almost sounds sheepish. Can an AI sound sheepish? He does. If he is an AI, at that. “Map tools weren’t really a thing, until yesterday, and then they were. So if the user interface is a bit shitty, yea, it’s because of that.” The in-game model claps his hands and jumps in place, “Music or no music?”
Everyone who worked at the mansion reported to Obie. This wasn’t even supposed to be his house, didn’t he have a penthouse somewhere in New York. But he had slowly moved himself in, asserting more of himself into Tony’s life. Pulling himself like a divider in between Tony and Stark Industries.
Tony almost expected someone to come up and say that no, Tiberius wasn’t actually dead, there had been a mistake.
He had sighed, “He was such a good kid, good head for business, he was going to go to places!”
Overall, they are productive classes but it definitely doesn’t help him get the looming meeting out of his mind. It’s just hard for Steve to reconcile the idea of Iron Man, the in-game character with Iron Man, the Stark Industries employee who has several other work obligations.
“I really don’t like that.”
His mind. His soul.
One (1) Bonus Scene, Some Years Later:
Steve got up, turning around to look at his boxes. He could finish the clothes and books all tonight. He was just going to unpack and place them in drawers and shelves after all. Then he could do the kitchen stuff tomorrow as he made breakfast. Leave the paints and brushes in the living room, take them out as he needed them.
“You couldn’t have been less interested,” Pepper amuses, as she collects the remaining files.
“Oh!” Steve had fixed it with a little touch on the side, “I- My ears get cold, so,” he had shrugged.
Tony is clearly very against the idea, seeing that he’s changing his t-shirt for the fourth time instead of just leaving his house like a normal person.
Tony couldn’t remember the last time someone held him like this, no other motive but to hold him close. Other than Steve, he could remember no one.
“Steve.”
Steve peeks around the rock to deal some more damage and gather more orbs, “How do you like the arena?”
“Let’s go get your prize.”
He let the mattress flop back down onto the floor, sat down and took out his phone. Someone probably had found Ty already. He had probably been in bad shape. And Obie knew… He knew Ty and him. Not the whole story but, oh well. He also knew Tony wouldn’t be able to put Ty in that shape so he probably had already figured out there had been a third party involved.
The man in question squints his eyes and furrows his brows, “Eat your food, Rogers,” he huffs and folds his arms, “We’ll see about manners.”
“It was too much like,” he made a stilted gesture towards him, cutting himself off.
He wasn’t supposed to die. You were.
Steve bundled him up in his arms, pressed his face to his tear wrecked one, “No more, Tony, oh God, never again, okay? I’m here now. You- You’re-” Tony felt Steve’s face warm up, “Mine.”
There’s no doubt The Avengers are busy people. From aliens, to gods with a bag of cats for brains, to a weak attempt of robots wreaking havoc in New York City... To say relationships were hard to maintain was not an understatement, but somehow through the havoc and the chaos, Tony Stark and Steve Rogers had made it work.
Yes, that Captain America.
This was supposed to be someone’s dream house, he thought to himself. Someone’s dream family with the loving Omega, kids and a dog.
But that was Steve and he would go down onto his knees and weep on the kitchen floor for some other Alpha’s dead Omega.
Pepper chuckles, “Remember your omelet? You spent three hours making that. They’re eggs Tony!!”
“Yeah,” an asset, that was what sons were to Obie. And that summed up things perfectly.
It tore through the wallpaper. Layers upon layers of thick, heavy wallpaper divided with foam. Wood underneath it splintered. The walls, the middle of the walls were hollow.
He found the bakery he preferred and the office supplies shop where he bought his sketchbooks and his 2B pencils and his route through Central Park on the five  out of seven mornings that he ran and the place he sat down to draw on the other two.
“Salad stuff?” Pepper laughs and stands up. “Good luck, I’ll speak to Steve in the afternoon to make sure he’s okay.”
“God, do you have any idea how scared you got me here? Huh?” He pulled back and looked into Tony’s eyes, “All I could do was pacing and pacing, no idea if you were in trouble or not, not being able to do anything Tony I-”
“Go wash your face and I will pay.”
Steve gave up on painting. He woke up way too early and taking his coffee on the porch, standing, ready to duck in the moment the neighbourhood started to wake up. He felt listless and drained at the same time. He hadn’t slept well since he came here. It was almost like something just at the edge of his detection was keeping him awake.
“God, I am so fucking weak for you,” Steve whispered into his neck, pressing his nose in so hard, he must have been cutting off his own air, Tony thought. His hips continued their aborted little thrusts and circles above Tony, grinding their hard cocks together through layers of clothing.
And then the crying began.
The owner knew Steve. Tony had guessed she would but it was so strange to see Steve well-known for being so gentle and polite. Somehow it just fit right into the puzzle that was Captain America in Tony’s mind. Kind. He even held the door open when they were coming into the cafe.
Steve stood there, back to the door with blood and bile soaked into his clothes. His haphazardly wiped hands had left faint, bloody prints on the light switch. His right hand gripped his keys still. Tony’s brain was immediately firing at full speed; where had he been, where was the body, where did he touch, which subdivision’s database did he need to hack into?
So, he will wait and he will follow. Because if there is one thing he knows, it’s that that goose cannot resist the sweet, sweet call of free knick-knacks that are absolutely of no use to it.
Steve continues, “I just thought this one would fall apart like my previous relationships. Bucky- He sets me up with people all the time. Sometimes it turns out they just wanted to climb higher on the social ladder. Sometimes it’s the political ladder,” he gestures broadly, “and that’s just even worse!”
Steve dipped his hands under his clothes, stroking his back, strong arms lifting him and settling him back on the bed as his hands traveled. It was almost as if Tony didn’t weigh anything. His hipbone aligned with Tony’s crotch, pressing in, so he lifted his leg to feel Steve’s erection pressing on his thigh through their clothes. They both trembled.
And Tony was missing.
Tony scoffs and backs away from him, “I, Tony Stark, am not a house-wife! I refuse to make my husband food when he comes home every day from a day of tiring work.!
Tony hugged his knees, “I think your disappearance did a number on him.”
That had set off a series of events which Tony wouldn’t be able to make up if he tried to.
Tony laughs again, this time, his head thrown back as he hears Steve’s words, “I can most definitely cook, it’s you that can’t. Remember Milan? Breakfast was terrible.”
Laying Tony down on the bed, he brushes the stray hair from his forehead.  Taking off both their shirts, Steve pulls the blanket over their bodies and kisses him. “This.”
They look into each other's eyes for a few moments, “Yes.”
“Hey! Those rocks shouldn’t reflect the beams like that!”
And if that festive spirit involved a little sneaking here and there… Well.
Steve’s mother had been a nurse. From how he talked about her, Tony could tell he loved his mother. Steve had lost her to tuberculosis. He had thought he had come to terms with losing her.
The garden was rather barren, so they had gone inside immediately as the moving company brought in Steve’s furniture.
Ty’s breath was sour on his face, hands uncoordinated as they ran over his body, pushing his clothing aside with a single minded determination that said I don’t care about your body, I get what I want, I want you humiliated.
Then there was him.
So, Ty was dead. But he knew that already.
He’s been in the development team, since the beginning of the game. He loves MMORPGs and kind of hates FPS games, which is a sentiment Steve can actually get behind. He’s actually not that good at playing, or so he says, which Steve is surprised to hear. But he’s good at coding on the go and strategizing. And he waves Steve away when he tells Iron Man being able to modify code like that on the go is more impressive than being able to play good.
“Huh,” says Steve, because he is a smart individual who can process information.
“Look,” he said, taking the glass back and dumping it out into the sink, then he turned on the tap, “Tony, look. It’s clean. Tap water. Look.”
Steve can’t help but laugh, pulling him onto his lap and keeping his arms looped around his waist, “Dinner at eight?”
“Wha- What would you like to do?” Steve’s fingers found the edge of his hoodie, fiddling with it. “You can have anything too, Tony,” cheeks pink, he averted his eyes, looking down at his own hands, “anything you want.”
It’s nice. It’s homely. It’s everything Tony didn’t know he needed until he got it. He can only hope Steve feels the same.
He also cannot take stuff from strangers when they pass things from hand to hand. He cannot drink very specific alcohol combinations because they trigger his depression. He can’t stand to be in cars when someone else is driving. And he definitely has trouble trusting people which turns forming relationships into a fucking hurdle race where hurdles have their own minds.
“Make them… Hexagonal? Uh- Whiplashy?” he cringes inwardly.
“That sounds,” Steve’s eyebrows creased, “vulnerable?”
“And an address.”
Dark eyes met his for a fleeting second before being tightly closed again. It almost seemed like the Omega was bracing himself.
Now though, a year after it’s release, it’s very easy to say that the game is a success. Buttery smooth servers, secret nooks and crannies to every level area, a lively world, engaging and evolving combat, several branches of stories along with sandbox servers, constant content updates… It is the online RPG every player dreamed of.
“You-”
And he would be settled in. This would be his new home. He could make it, take it step by step.
Or, he had been shaken up by the gossip a little too much.
Dinner, much to Tony’s relief, consists of a five-star meal prepared by Tony’s personal chef. Tony had never spoken negatively about his cooking. As a Stark, he knows he can get the best and he does, especially when he's sharing with Steve.
He still had trouble connecting the Steve he had in his arms just last night to the man Howard went on and on about. Steve Rogers to Captain America.
So they ended up sitting side by side in a cafe with ice held up to Tony’s wrist, waiting for their almond croissants to arrive. Steve was still sniffling every once in a while. Tony could still feel the last dregs of adrenaline coursing through his veins, feel the tightness in his own hunched shoulders that he couldn’t relax. All of it acting as little signs that told people to stay the fuck away.
There was so much he wished he could ask Howard too. What had pushed him to cut his ties with the remaining scientists from the super soldier project? What had pushed him to cut ties with the government projects? Howard had talked so much about Captain America and so little about his ties to the project.
“Well, uh, a hunch? I don’t- I mean you were the first one to actually see through the act, you know? But also, that fucking glittery rock has been there for a very long time and let me tell you, Captain, a truly huge team worked on this game. After your indignancy about the glittery rock thing, I made- Uh- Contacted some teams about the previous fights and you know what, literally, nobody used that glittery reflective rock things. No one knew about those. You were right. That is shitty design.”
So nothing was safe in this house anymore. Still, Tony also couldn’t take anything out of the house either. So he had done the only logical thing and had stripped all the previous connection to his workshop that Obie didn’t give two shits about.
“Is it the charcoal? Steve, it’s not a big deal.”
And wouldn’t that be the best. He might not be exactly friendly with a lot of people but it is a small town and he is the only mechanic. So if the goose is hiding his stuff in someone’s garden, he’ll just knock on their door and retrieve his stuff. Done.
“HOOONK!!”
There would be time, time for everything else. Tony would make sure of it. He lifted his coffee cup to Tony’s lips carefully after each bite. Steve had even let Tony sip his blueberry muffin flavored tea. It was horribly fake and way too sweet but he had laughed at the face Tony had made so Tony counted that as a win.
Children were waiting for the school bus a couple of houses over. Next door was washing plates in the sink. Down the street, someone was mowing their lawn.
“Oh my God, Steve, they will ask us how we met!”
He should have run downstairs, not up, Steve realized. He could have gotten out of the house. He could have gotten into his God damned car and left, but no. He had locked himself up into the house with whatever that thing was.
“It’s delicious.” Tony takes a sip of his wine, while waiting for Steve to sit down as he dishes out a portion for them both. “I hope you like it.”
If there was some world-ending emergency, then a phone call would suffice, but nevertheless they always made it to dinner. There had been the one occasion where Tony had missed dinner because he’d fallen asleep, and when Steve had found him, he’d practically swooned over him, but bygones are bygones.
Steve scrambled away from the wall, away from this cloud of vile smell and the moaning cries and the house. He threw himself out of the front door and onto the porch.
“I heard you buddy, I’m on it,” Steve slowly rises from his chair and leaves his brooding aside to open his door.
“It’s not necessary, I can lift-”
If this is the kind of artificial intelligence Tony Stark can come up with, Steve doesn’t want to know just how the inside of the man’s mind is.
His eyes caught Tony, sitting on the bed, abruptly he crumbled, “Oh God, Tony.”
Someone helping you get a job when you asked for help is one thing. Thinking you got somewhere on your own merit and discovering it’s all been a lie is something else entirely. And it’s just, Steve cannot stand dishonesty. He cannot stand unwanted favours. He cannot stand-
Steve also had called it a “family brunch” and had said without “the kids” it wouldn’t be complete and Tony had been too full of emotions to properly argue with that.
He wants Steve’s opinion. Well, TheCaptain’s opinion. Same thing.
“Oh, no. Well, I can’t really,” Tony felt his eyes sting. He didn’t know why he felt like crying after Howard now, when he hadn’t even cried at the funeral. He didn’t really miss Howard, but maybe the idea of a man that Steve remembered made him wistful. A version of his own father that he had never met, “He died three years ago. Along with mom. With Maria,” he sniffed, “yeah.
Some of his fantasy landscape studies are suitable. He sets them aside. There are some sketches he did as examples at school recently, when he had given his students the character and map creation prompts; those, he can flesh out. He sets them aside as well.
Then Steve started to talk.
This couldn’t be hard. He flicks through the easy, fool-proof recipe and claps his hands, “Right, let’s do this.”
“So now you’re making a new one that can do all the things,” Steve gestures vaguely, “the other ones can do?”
Steve looks at the menu. The menu looks at Steve. And he thinks; okay, yeah, why not.
“And you don’t have to apologize because you don’t drink coffee. I’m serious Steve, just- I’m serious, tell me what kibble you like and I’ll get you kibble. This all seems very , well, inconsequential to me. Like, there isn’t anything else, right?”
Steve pushes the bolt off the table. The wrench. That almost gets Tony on the foot. A screw. Another screw when Tony leaves the garage to make coffee for himself and bring water for Steve.
Steve continues to eat his food, it drives Tony absolutely crazy not knowing what Steve is thinking, he knows he can’t lose. It’s mathematically and probably impossible for him to lose. He’s brought this point up before, but he can’t help but wonder if Steve likes the food he’s prepared. Steve always made him feel weird and soft inside, he made him care about things Tony hasn’t thought two moments about.
it’s really been that many lonely days
No. Not only Obie knew but he had allowed it. He had allowed Ty to do whatever he wanted with Tony. Hell, he had encouraged it. They both did, Ty’s own father did.
“I have dinner to attend. And if I remember correctly, you have a dinner to cook, you best be off. Mr I-want-five-out-of-five-stars.”
He laughs again, breathless and beautiful, “Okay, as long as I get to call you mine,” Steve rolls over, pulling Tony onto his chest, “If it slips out, I can’t help it.”
“Hm? What was it you were saying?”  Steve swirls Tony round and backs him into the kitchen island.
And oh God. When it hit him, the acrid smell of fear, Steve almost doubled over, instincts raging. Burnt vanilla under a hazy cloud of something akin ammonia and putrid smoke. Something vile was wafting through the house.
“You got me a petting zoo because I liked a goat?”
Iron Man doesn’t let up, “Why would you lie about having scoliosis. I- You know what? Alright, here you go.”
“It sounds really stupid when you said it like that but yeah; I mean you get to pet a goat, kids get to pet a goat. And to be honest, babe, I can get you a petting zoo. A petting zoo where professionals take care of the animals and we get to reap the benefits so why not? You should get to pet as many goats as you want to.”
Delirious with the possibility of a modicum of normalcy, Steve brought the hammer down fast and sure.
The walk back to the apartment had been tense but affectionate. Tony pulled up the hood of his hoodie just in case. Steve’s hand would momentarily get too tight around his shoulder, then he would realize and press a kiss to his head, whispering sorry into his ear.
Steve knows Iron Man won’t be able to do it, he can recognize patterns, he can rework what he knows, but he cannot create something new from scratch. The fact that he understood what Steve is asking for is an accomplishment in itself. But he cannot create something new. Not without a human behind the wheel.
“H-hey! Are you- Were you looking for me?”
Under a hedge, possibly. Or in a ditch.
“Oh no! That was just the worst thing to say. It’s not about you, really! Wait no! Ugh!” He takes a deep breath. “I just wanted someone to care about me for just who I am! Being a royal is- God I sound vain. But, well, yeah.”
It wasn’t quite desire that he felt, watching himself being carried away on the screen, but it spread through his core like molten lava. Giddy. Coiled tight. Tony couldn’t remember the last time someone just held him. Ty never held him. They weren’t the hugging type of boyfriends. No, they were the in between the two of us we have this many billion dollars kind of boyfriends.
He checked the premises, using the tail of his shirt to open the doors. The two other rooms were covered in dust, as was expected from an empty flat. He didn’t walk into them, there was nothing in them that he wanted. Tony turned back to the room where the mattress was. Looked at the doorknob, the window latches, anywhere that would require touch. Rubbed clean.
The house looked more like a house than the last time he had been here. Steve had finished assembling the furniture. It still looked a bit bare, a bit makeshift but it was alright. For now.
Tony attacked the glass of water.
“They will write that I seduced my employee.”
So they had packed up, Howard’s super secret super soldier files safely tucked away and went all the way over to Malibu.
He Googled “what to do if my house is haunted”. He burned the sage he ripped out of herbal tea bags.
A voice came through the open doors of  the sitting room to his left, “My son wasn’t supposed to die, you know.”
Rogers hadn’t looked like a bigot then, and with all that he has heard about him, Tony doesn’t think he’s one either. Maybe he’s straight. A huge possibility. But that alone still doesn’t explain his hostility.
He wasn’t going to do that. Oh no. Wouldn’t be the first illegal thing he turned a blind eye to. Luckily, Tony Stark with an impulsive plan was a Tony Stark in his element.
Once inside, Steve slumps against the door frame for two seconds, needing to regroup. This is harder than he thought it would be and Tony looks better than he has any right to with his perfect curl falling on his forehead and his perfect facial hair and- Well, at least he didn’t bring up the note, or the delivery method, Steve thinks, not that he gave him any time to speak.
“I didn’t- Ah, well. Maybe it’s because of the…” Obie had gestured to his head sympathetically.
Tony looked at him questioningly, but the plan was already formed in his mind, from the moment Stone started walking up to him, all swagger and confidence. He was close enough now.
Steve hid the carrot under one of the three buckets he had and started moving them like a shell game. After a dizzyingly long time, he stopped. The goat nudged the bucket on the left, which had the carrot underneath and started munching as Steve gazed at him proudly.
Tony squirmed, “Anything baby, you can have anything.”
Steve’s face, as they parked, was… A bit blank. Tony would have considered himself good at reading Steve’s facial expressions normally but right now, addled with his own apprehension, he was drawing blank himself. He pressed the button to turn off the car and wiped his sweaty hands on his jeans. He really wanted this to go well.
Sliding her heels back off, Pepper laughs, walking around and sitting next to him, “What’s got you so distracted anyway. Are you plotting something?”
When he crouched down to press the glass onto Tony’s lips, they remained tightly sealed. His eyes didn’t open either.
Steve looked at him in the eyes, “I don’t want you to go there. Tony,” his arms got painfully tight around Tony, “I want to take you and run away. Go, anywhere but here, never let you get out of my sight.”
He sighs, “That was cruel and you know it but I’ll let it go if you come here and give me a kiss.”
“Goodnight, wife to be.” They both laugh, and Steve squeezes Tony in his arms just a little tighter that night. Just like always, the blond presses a soft kiss into Tony’s soft brunet locks, before closing his eyes and getting some shut-eye.
They sat in silence for a while, watching the dust from the opened boxes dance and slowly settle in the sunbeams.
“What?” Iron Man does the first attack. Skrulls do their thing and all turn into Steve’s and Iron Man’s character but their shield allows them to just blast off area damages without worrying about friendly fire. They get all the Skrulls down to half of their health bar in three seconds and their mirroring spells break.
It was like holding a bag of bones, very stiffly tied together. He clearly favored the shoulder Steve ruined with the hammer. His stomach lurched.
“You’re a smart boy. I told Obadiah that if he played with your mind a little, you’d be confused enough, try to act before you planned everything through, you were bound to leave a trail. You hid the apartment thing well, I’ll give you that. We had to hire a detective, one of those guys who follow cheating husbands and shit, you know those guys. That and well, the curtains you ordered and their size. Cross searched with the apartments sold in the last couple of months around the town... “
“Yeah, what am I going to do with this information?”
But he could have done that days ago. He could have done that the first time he had been surrounded with weird smells and unexplained sounds.
This time the genius squints his eyes, “Well nothing, now,” he’s met with another laugh as Steve folds up the newspaper and places it back onto the counter, for anyone, mostly Clint, to do the crossword puzzle. “So what’s for lunch, doll?”
Tony’s eyes blurred with tears, from the vice grip on his wrist or from the clear cut dismissal, he wasn’t sure.
“Uh- Ms. Potts, this is about the art department still, right? I wouldn’t want to-”
Suddenly, Steve was exhausted. The anger left him. The anxiety drained away. He was tired. Bone deep, crushingly tired. He swayed on his feet. He turned towards the staircase. His head was empty. No thoughts formed in his brain. Even his own footsteps were too loud.
“An entire art team worked on just this arena! They are glittery! They are crystals.”
Steve plays with the kind of precision you wouldn’t expect even from a pre-rendered cutscene. And so, it’s not really surprising that he gets to the famous last boss of The Avengers, breaking records left and right. The Iron Man.
The said goat, now done with the lamp, started exploring the kitchen area, his little hooves clicking on the tiles.
Because Iron Man seems interested in Steve, but also, that could mean anything. And that’s the sad thing, that Iron Man is probably just a thoughtful guy who genuinely saw something in Steve’s gameplay style and doesn’t mind becoming friends. Kind of friends. Doesn’t mean he would be interested like that.
“Did you just say what we had? Are we breaking up? Are you breaking up with me right now?”
“Sure,” Steve fiddled with the hem of his shirt, “can we place them outside?”
“Hey,” he leaned into Steve over the small table, his stomach swooped when their eyes met but he didn’t avert his gaze, “That’s  probably the first time anyone said that to me and actually meant it, you know. Or maybe, no wait, it might actually be the first time ever that someone called me beautiful,” he laughed maybe a little bitterly.
it’s all fine if a bit rowdy, without you
Steve sighed. Putting the glass on the counter, he pulled the Omega back up and onto the counter. It was very hard, maneuvering with how stiff he was, but he managed to sit him on the granite top.
“Are you there Captain? Hello! You seem online still. This wouldn’t be the first time someone rage quitted to be honest but you didn’t seem like-”
Steve hates many things. He hates bananas and cucumbers in any shape of form. Hates raw tomatoes but will eat them cooked. Garlic, he’s allergic to. And onions, he can tolerate in very small quantities when cooked thoroughly.
He had big hammers in his closet. Left over from the times he made his own frames. What was a wall to a hammer, swung with the helpless anger that brewed in him for days now.
If at that moment Steve had asked for his life, he would have given it willingly.
Tony looks to the left. Then to the right. Then for good measure, he pokes his head out of the garage and looks around. There is nobody.
Tony is pacing his garage. He needs his 3mm plier that is somewhere in Steve Rogers’ garden. He cannot go there. He has ordered a new one but the two day shipping is… Well, two days away. And he just has nothing else to do but pace and think.
i’m watching over new york tonight
“Well, I started working here,” Steve goes over the statement Miss Potts prepared for them, for the millionth time, “After we started working together, we got close.”
He knew what the problem was, Steve realized in a sudden moment of clarity. He stood at the door, looking around in his living room, taking in the barren walls. He didn’t feel at home here. To Steve, this was still someone else’s house.
He spent the entire day in a daze, being ushered from one makeshift interrogation room to the other at the hospital while doctors tended to his wounds and gave him IV fluids.
But then there was the fact that, even if he really hadn’t been remembering correctly, Obie still had been in his room while he slept. Sure, his ideas of Obie were souring real fast lately but Obie wouldn’t try to hurt him directly. He wouldn’t try anything like suffocating him in his sleep.
“I am not cleaning your weird misshapen dog though,” he sulks into his phone.
“Brush your teeth.”
As he came back to himself, Steve realized he was shaking. His entire body trembling. He laid there, looking at the blue sky, the clouds passing by. He couldn’t bring himself to get up. He couldn’t bring himself to go in.
“What? No! I mean- I don’t want to? I’m just trying to apologize!”
“Tony,” Steve looked at him with his trademark Come On Now expression, so, okay, maybe this was Steve, “what was I supposed to do? Leave him there in the supermarket?”
“While Obie was coming to you, Stone was waiting for me here,” Tony shivered, the fact that Obie had planned to kill him only now setting in, “He might have tried to kill me. I kind of might have buried a meat cleaver in his head. He might have pissed all over the kitchen floor, I don’t know.”
There is no rescue coming. There is no rescue coming because no one knows he’s here.
Steve sighs, “Tony, the main topic is supposed to be the new accessibility controllers. Our relationship is literally the secondary topic here.”
But it only took about half an hour for the absurd blood results that he stole from and rewrote in the hospital system to bring up decades old files from his father’s personal collection, scanned and protected behind firewalls.
“He allows that man into your house?” His hands went to Tony’s hands, then grabbed the legs of Tony’s chair, pulling him close. He buried his face into Tony’s legs, Tony could barely hear him whispering.
Steve Googled the shit out of ways to get rid of smells. He boiled coffee. Wiped the floors with said coffee.
Steve follows after her and thinks, clearly, there must be something wrong. Surely, they must have confused him with someone else. Steve Rogers isn’t an entirely unique name. It would just be Steve’s luck if another Steve Rogers had applied for a higher positioned job. He has been confused with people named Rodgers before.
Stone toppled over to the floor, taking Tony down with him. He had the advantage of his body weight but Tony was running on adrenaline. Stone made to grab him again with his good hand. Tony averted him and rolled to the side, shaking him off.
He will still grade their technique, though. They can’t run away from that.
“Steven!” There’s a soft kiss on Steve’s chest, “I love you too.”
He slowly jacked them both off, exploring in a way he never had before with any other partner. Steve was uncut. Tony’s thumb fit just right under his foreskin, so he pushed it there, rubbing the moist head. Steve shuddered violently above him, his chest rumbling against Tony’s. He was leaking so much. Tony wanted to taste him. Some other time, he promised himself.
He flipped open one of the notebooks, one of the half-sized ones that Steve had in Central Park too. Small trees, bushes, dogs and squirrels covered the pages. Some were more realistic than the others. Some, Steve had left unfinished; head too crooked, one limb too long to waste more time on.
“Oh! Hi darling, you’re the one Tiberius sold the house to then,” a middle-aged woman with already coiffed chestnut hair had poked her head above the tall separator between the houses.
The music bloomed in a crescendo for a second. A door forcefully shut. Ty was suddenly gone, a sudden burst of cold air filling the place he vacated. Tony wanted to curl up against it, with Ty’s body suddenly gone, but his body refused to budge.
They stood under water, close, then closer. Tony had washed Steve’s hair, raising himself on his tiptoes to reach, Steve dipping his head unconsciously, pinkish water collecting around the drain, then slowly clearing away.
“Sweetheart?” Tony sat back down onto the bed, “Steve, tell me what you need.”
And for Tony too! The magic of the place probably knew how forgetful he was, how he would get caught up in his own inventions and forget about ruling. Forget about his consort too, probably.
“I just! Oh God, this is a mess,” Steve buries his face into his hands, his ears flatten on his head, “I didn’t think we’d get this far.”
The cold sweat on Tony’s back clashed with the excitement bubbling in his stomach. Captain America had been living like this for decades. Surely he wouldn’t slip that easily. Still, Tony had seen the seemingly uncontrollable way he had went at Ty’s face.
All Tony could do was return the sentiment, “Me too baby, Steve,” he panted, “anything baby, for you, anything.”
“Tony-”
He had carried Tony in his arms so carefully and had made sure he didn’t choke or drown and he was Captain America.
“Why were you awake in the first place,” Tony asked quietly, “nightmare?”
“Yes Steve, we can even place a cookie by their side for when they wake up.”
He nodded, stroking Steve’s cheek, “Yeah, well, pick up your phone then, before Fury decides to invite himself over.”
His friends from MIT had slowly disappeared, he only saw people from the same business circle and then Ty had appeared. After Ty was just… Ty.
Also, Steve had called the goose, the town criminal, without specifying that he was talking about the bird, which will always be written as about 10 points in his corner. Even if this thing doesn’t work out. It
Steve wasn’t mooning. He definitely refused to accept that he was moping. But Tony was literally right there and he could see Steve looking at the gauges the goat had made in the salt lamp longingly so really, he didn’t need Steve to accept it. He wanted a goat.
He’s a weirdo. But he’s Tony’s weirdo and Tony loves him. Also, Steve, in turn, says nothing about Tony’s dried berry and coffee addiction so it all balances out, really.
He wasn’t that far away from the lounge, Tony realized. A flash of last night came into his mind, a ghost sensation of Ty’s hands attacked him suddenly. He shuddered. His stomach made a poor attempt at turning. When he walked in the direction of the venue, no one gave him a second look in the morning crowd. His absolutely revolting state was a bonus at making people look away.
Just the image of a hand, battered and bruised, had kept him going. One step after another. The knowledge that the video was in Obie’s computer and Tony wouldn’t be able to just destroy it because then Obie would know and he could find people to match the dots and it would take time but it would happen and then…
“I am not,” Steve trails off, looking at the article about the Lovelace test. Yep, this is it. This will be fun, “How- How many attacks do you have?”
Steve sits up and flips them over so Tony is underneath his body, while Tony’s head is cradled in Steve’s suspiciously delicate hands, “You called me your husband. Do you really want that?”
It followed.
Iron Man waves away a couple attacks Steve makes in the meantime, and continues babbling on, “So that was bad obviously. Someone is getting fired. I mean, not really, but still. Bad. Still, I- Well, I wondered what kind of things you’d come up with. I also felt a little bad about egging you on after you said you had scoliosis. Don’t get me wrong, I’m sure you’re- Uh- You’re living with it. Do you have a good set up? Be honest. I’m ready to feel worse if you’re playing on a little laptop on your kitchen table right now.”
“Slowly,” Steve said, trying to pace him. He asked once it was done, “want another one?”
“What now, you little- Oh!”
Avengers Initiative. It would be fine. Steve and him, they would be fine no matter what. They had been laying low, staying quiet for so long, trying to figure out what they were.
Steve still cannot really wrap his brain around it. He’s supposed to… What? Have a one versus one with Iron Man in an arena he designed just for the shits and giggles? Who’s giggles? Is this an official match? What if he wins?
Steve slowly turned to him. Eyes closed and his forehead creased, he looked every bit the murdered who caved Ty’s head in. He took a deep, shaky breath. Let go of the doorknob. When he opened them, his eyes were almost all black, swallowed by the dilated pupils.
Steve had smiled at his berating, “You’ve been here for three hours now.”
He had gotten there last night after a couple of hours of grind and left the game there, not wanting to mess with his chances because his back decided to cramp halfway through the fight. He isn’t underleveled. He’s got every single item and engraving and bonus that is rumored to help with fighting the boss. Yet, here he is, looking at the fight arena door with trepidation.
“You think? What does that mean?” Tony puts his hands on his hips.
