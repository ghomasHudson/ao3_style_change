“You’re not supposed to be finding sex appeal at all, you beautiful asexual flamingo!” Charlie shouts, but Dorothy only rolls her eyes, marks her place in her book, and leaves. Charlie huffs when she’s gone. “Me and Dorothy were best friends in high school. She was ace, and I was lesbian, and everyone thought we were weird. Then she said she’d had enough of people treating her like shit because she wasn’t interested in sex. We came here together because she wanted to be ‘cured,’ and I wanted to keep an eye on her. She was fine until she got to stage seven,
“I’m seeing someone too,” Bela counters, licking her way down his throat. People are starting to stare.
“Maybe they’re stealing your mail,” Charlie offers after seeing Cas' face fall with another week of an empty mail hole. “I’m still convinced they took the first few letters I wrote to Gilda. When I started addressing them to Gladys Bradbury, my ‘sister’, her replies magically started coming.”
His plan, while heroic and romantic and meaningful, well, it hadn’t been perfect. Use the spell Nick left to open the door to the Empty. Find Cas. Tell him he loves him, tell him he wants him home, tell him there’s nothing,
Dean settled into his new spot, and a chair was quickly procured for Castiel to sit beside him.
He’d jokingly told Castiel to romance him, but he honestly had no idea what Castiel would do.
Dean got passionate, too, about ancient engineering and weaponry and tools, all kinds of stuff. But he was a muddy grunt in comparison to Castiel.
Cautious, unsure where they now stood, Castiel reached across and gently hooked his finger under Dean’s chin to draw his gaze back up. “Do I need to tell you again that I wanted you from the start?” he asked smoothly. “That I just didn’t realize you’d be interested in having me this way, too?”
As the water around Gabriel began to slowly thicken and darken to blue once more, Dean licked his lips and gave Gabriel a small nod.
Dean tucked Baby away in the underground garage when they finally got back. Sometimes he’d leave her on the road if they were heading back out, as no one ever came to this abandoned, industrial area of town anyway, but he knew they were likely heading into a long stretch of research. So, comfily stowed away with her friends in the Men of Letters’ hangar it was.
As he was swallowing down his anger, Dean felt his phone buzzing against his thigh. He pulled it out of his pocket, briefly, in case it was an update from Cas, or something urgent from Sam or Bobby—but his notifications announced a string of texts from Charlie, several rows back.
“Enough with the Venom jokes.”
“Yeah,” Dean agreed. “Doubtful that would work, given that she can’t even talk about… Y’know, them.” He indicated the door of the officer’s room with his shoulder.
Of. Fucking. Course.
Turning on the heat in the dark car, Dean retucked his shirt sleeves behind his elbows and leaned closer to Castiel on the bench seat, so he could cup his jaw in his hand. Running a thumb along Castiel’s stubble affectionately, Dean nodded as he said, “Just as I predicted...it was perfect. Because it was us.”
Castiel just sat still, as if Dean’s words had pressed a pause button. He looked at Dean’s hand, too; Dean didn’t move it.
“Very nice, Dean-o. If I didn’t already know far too much about you, I would.”
“HEY!” Castiel yelled, looking over to see the pig rooting through his open suitcase on the porch.
Castiel stiffened in his saddle, making Connie jerk her head in complaint, but it was only for a moment before his shoulders slumped down. “I would have thought that you’d have heard. It was quite the juicy scandal, really.”
Laughing as he sat himself down in the vacant seat to Castiel’s left, Dean felt like—just perhaps—he already had.
They were pressed together, Castiel could feel Dean’s breath on his lips. He swallowed harshly, nodding. “Yes. Thank you,” he said.

The next vehicle on his list for the afternoon was a Ford Focus that needed new tires. Easy. After grabbing the clipboard from Bobby’s desk, Dean walked out onto the shop floor. The Ford was parked on the other side of the bay, ready to be lifted.
“Hey Cas, can you do the—” Dean waved his palms at the holo-table, making dramatic
“Don’t see anyone else around here I even like, so it’s gotta be for you.”
“Why not?” Dean said, reaching across to gloop the thick maple-flavored liquid across the three fluffy pancakes on Castiel’s plate. “It all tastes the same to you anyway, right?”
He pushed the volume up, increasing the vibration to distract himself from his own thoughts.
“I’m a riot in my middle age,’ Dean confirmed sarcastically. “My younger self would be so disappointed in me.”
“Bet he’d go if you asked him, though.”
Dean grinned, strolling into the kitchen. “Woke up just a few minutes ago. I thought I said I’d cook you breakfast?”
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel managed to say.
Have a good week, folks.
For fuck’s sake. This looked so
Even the air in the tiny waiting area made Dean feel like he was going to catch something from it, hanging thick and soupy in the weak, yellowish light. Never mind catching something from the
Castiel’s hand moved up, damp against Dean’s cheek as he ducked down, searching for his eyes. “Dean, why are
There was, of course, no answer. Castiel shook his head to himself in mild amusement, before letting out a long breath. He should probably start to make a few lists, he decided.
Dean nodded in Castiel’s hands, understanding.
The nebulous thought of in the future made Dean’s breath catch.
“It’s you,” he said, his low voice even raspier than Dean recalled it.
Quiet fell around the table, and the Jiffy Burger’s lack of other patrons suddenly became a loud thing, too much silence trapped within the grease-streaked, advertisement-adorned walls. Dean sucked in a rough breath and shifted in his seat. Castiel was unmoving, and when Dean looked across at him he saw that the angel was staring down at his own lap, his hands clenched atop his thighs.
After a while, Dean nodded. “Yea. Okay. If that’s what you want.”
Do you think you’ll
forever?
“No, but you spent a year with her after Sam went into the cage.” Dean considered that, and shook his head. “No, that’s what Sammy wanted me to do. But Cas… That’s not what happened alright? Cas pulled Sammy out, but forgot part of him,” he glared at Castiel before continuing, “And Cas and I…” Dean’s cheeks flamed. So apparently still not good with talking about feelings.
Cas cleared his throat, “uh, you’re dreaming Dean.”
“Jesus, Jack. Warn a girl, would ya?” He had assumed a greeting was warning enough and couldn’t think of an appropriate response, so instead he said nothing. “What happened, Jack? I woke up on the side of the road, all alone.”
Jack struggled with his answer. He knew Lucifer was hated, but he had never thought of Lucifer as his father. He hesitated, “Well… my father… well, you are my father.”
In the safety of his room Cas leaned his head back against the cold glass of the mirror on the back of the door. His right hand was clenched tight around the doorknob and his left in a fist against the hard fabric of his trench coat. When he finally released the tension, there were fingernail indentations on his left hand and his right throbbed with arthritic pain.
This one is different 'cause he's lonely
“Cas, what are you –” Cas cut him off by sealing his lips to Dean’s. Dean was obviously shocked but it didn’t take long before he started participating in the kiss. Their mouths moved together seamlessly. Dean wound his fingers through Cas’ hair, and Cas pressed down on top of Dean. Dean responded by rolling his hips up into Cas’ groin. Cas broke the kiss to groan.
“Lucifer. Dean is dreaming. I’m going to see if I can enter and tell him where we are.” For once Lucifer didn’t have anything to say. He had an indecipherable expression on his face, but he just nodded his understanding. Cas laid back down and focused as hard as he could on channeling his grace into entering Dean’s dream. It was difficult to get it to focus and he was sure he wouldn’t be able to project himself for long, but after what felt like a very long time he felt himself slip into Dean’s dream world.

“We told each other how we felt about each other,” Castiel finished.
“I’m Jack. We were trying to rescue you, but I lost Sam and Dean and Kaia on the way. There were so many doors. I… maybe we should start at the beginning.” Mary didn’t look like she understood much of that, but instead of explaining he gripped her tightly and focused on their universe. That one was easiest to locate because it was home. He focused the source of his power on separating the walls between the universes and spread his wings wide to gain leverage over keeping it open, then he quickly flapped his wings and pulled them through.
He struggled to find the appropriate response, “I’m alright. I was… Nothing of import. Just wandering.” He quickly fled before his traitorous body could reveal anything he wasn’t prepared to deal with.
Cas stood in front of the mirror behind the door and commanded his angel blade to him. He popped the top of the tube and held it against his neck. Then he slowly sliced the skin above the tube with his angel blade and winced when his grace reacted to the pain. The tube was a heavenly object, designed to attract raw grace. His grace came out in tendrils and compacted itself inside the tube, swirling with discomfort at leaving its host. His body immediately felt heavy with ache and loss, so he capped the tube now containing his grace and stumbled to the bed.
He didn’t know where he had been expecting to end up, so he was surprised to find himself standing in the bunker, in front of Dean and Castiel. On his entry, Castiel shoved Dean behind him and pulled his angel blade out. “Who are you? How did you find us here?” he demanded.
“Like you haven’t,” Cas scoffed, picking up the second bottle in front of him and waving it to accentuate his point. “You’ve done nothing but yell at me since you slammed into me in the Nest, not looking where you were going!”
Dean wanted it back. The music thumped through his bones and echoed in the cavity of his chest, warming him, and the spot where Castiel’s hand had been resting felt oddly cold by comparison.
Circling gulls called overhead, crying out into the thin, cloudy, early-afternoon light. It had rained recently, and Dean’s boots left deep prints in the sandy ground between the troughs of the van’s tire tracks.
“Okay?” Dean asked, unsure. “Are you...sad?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean linked his fingers tightly with Castiel’s, and shamelessly tugged him the direction of the small parking area. Their walk back to the Impala suddenly became a lot swifter, their bodies brushing often across the space between them, coy smiles and looks exchanged out of the corner of their eyes. The sun was down by then and the breeze was picking up, blowing the grass around their feet as they cut across it to where Baby waited.
The grout left on Castiel’s thumb felt gross and sticky, and in desperately trying
Dean felt his chest heat strangely, and he hoped he wasn’t blushing like he thought he was. What a way to make Cas think he was a total weirdo.
Dean felt Castiel leaning forward. One of his hands slid up Dean’s abdomen until it reached his sternum, and his chin hooked over Dean’s shoulder.
Dean sucked in a deep breath and smiled. “Oh, really?”
“I’m real glad you’re here,” Dean said simply.
I can’t wait to see you, Cas
Thank you so much for reading!
“You need help?” Dean asked, already mentally running through a packing list in the back of his mind.
“Of course,” Dean muttered, flopping back onto his side. “Just our fucking luck.”
If you enjoyed it, would you consider
When he reached the beach, he looked back up to the cliff-top where the cabin stood, dark and quiet. Maybe he should have put the porch light on...ahh, well. Fuck if he was making the journey back up, not with all this weight.
Castiel’s smile was slightly wolfish. “Not if you’re too uncomfortable to do so, of course. But it does make it more fun.”
…the fuck?
he’d said to Cas.
ing as another elbow jabbed her in the ribs.
Speaking of gorgeous pictures...that's right, there's one down there. Liz has been at it again! If you want to go and give her some love
Dean paused to bite his lip, suddenly doubtful again, wondering if he was being too bold. He wouldn’t want Castiel to feel obligated, simply because Dean paid his wages and provided the large cottage on the outskirts of the estate that Castiel now resided in. Hastily, Dean added a few more lines.
“What? I’ll ask Cas as a last resort?”
Castiel really
In the end, Dean decided to be the one to step up… or step down, as the case may be. He was still up on the stage, after all. One of them had to be the one to approach, and it seemed like Castiel was a stubborn shit. So, Dean would be the bigger man, even if he was only an inch or so taller.
“Thank you, then. Of course, I will remain, and stay working here at the house. It will be my pleasure—I’m grateful for the employment, of course, but…” Castiel’s hand rose to push nervously through his hair, creating ever more attractive disarray. “I enjoy your company very much, too.”
“Then I’m gonna choose wrong.”
Hello, folks!
“I, uh, I just wanted to check—”
Dean seemed to think about it for a moment, though whether he was thinking about his answer or whether or not to give a response at all wasn’t clear. He lifted his beer to his lower lip, letting it sit there for a moment as his eyes drifted over the garden, the metaphorical fruits of his labor. Eventually, he took a long draw of the fresh, foamy beer before turning to look at Castiel.
Castiel snorted in amusement. “That’s a fair deal. Can I get a coffee to go, too, when I’m done with this one—and one for Dean?”
Castiel frowned again, more firmly, the wrinkles across his brow deepening. “What do you mean?”
He smelled clean but musky, somehow like cinnamon and fresh laundry, all at once.
Castiel was waiting for him atop Connie now, near the lane, as Baby was brought out for him. The morning had been pretty, bright and full of sunbeams that gleamed on motes of pollen above the fields. Now, though, a few clouds had begun to gather, and a chiller breeze had begun to blow, making Dean glad of his green jacket no matter if it was well fitting or not.
Dean’s thighs shook as he tried to recall.
Dean became more and more aware of the fabric of his boxers shifting over his cock, a soft throbbing making itself known as his body reacted more and more to the gorgeous, hot merman above him.
The door swung open…and then bounced back and kept going, swinging straight off its hinges and toppling onto the porch, hitting an old rocking chair with a resounding
“Actually, I did,” Castiel said, tying his scarf back around his neck before he started to walk away from the quad. “While you may have certain ideas about how you should fit in or what you deserve, Professor Adler has responsibilities not only to the college but under the law. That’s part of what the Academic Access Office does, Dean—remind him of that. I’m not
Finally, Dean dared to look over to the other wall, to the darker side of the room. He knew what he’d find there, but even so, he was unprepared.
“She sure did,” Claire said, and it was adorable how much pride shone in her eyes. “Kaia is fluent in pastry.”
Castiel looked back up then, some of their tension easing as they focused on a plan. His eyes—
“We’re going to need someone to find him, to bring him home, while the rest of the angels and myself work to close this world off from the Empty before we all go with it,” Michael intones heavily. He keeps his hand on Dean like he’s holding him up. Dean can’t feel his body anymore, so he might be. “The timing is very important. If we wait too long, we won’t be able to stop the fabric of Earth unraveling just like every other plane in this universe. But if we close it up too soon, Castiel may be stuck. Do you understand what I’m saying?”
Castiel showered, more for Meg than himself. He was miserable that he’d lost his job and wasted years on a place that didn’t appreciate him and left him with nothing. And he was also sad and angry that he’d wasted those same years on a boyfriend who didn’t appreciate him, either. Castiel wasn’t perfect, but he did, at least, know he deserved better than that.
Castiel shook his arm out of one sleeve, revealing the full acreage of his tanned, strong chest to Dean. He was well-muscled; clearly he worked out—lifted weights or ran—shirtless, something that would account for both the firmness of his body and the uninterrupted golden hue of his skin. He had the barest smattering of chest hair, the odd silvery strand in amongst the dark only making his body even closer to perfection for Dean. Whereas Dean was subtly freckled all over, Castiel had barely a blemish maring his skin. There were a few tiny lines or dots here or there, hardly noticeable, but the only mark that stood out was a dark freckle just northwest of his right nipple—it cried out for Dean’s tongue to taste it, so much so that he got distracted from sucking on Castiel’s thumb.
Dean’s viewers, though, loved him. Probably (as Castiel pointed out regularly) because they loved Dean, but still. It was heartwarming, how he’d been welcomed into Dean’s strange, extended internet family.
He was barely even tired, the nervousness in his muscles keeping him at a low, alert buzz.
Dropping his voice low and sounding as suggestive as he could, Dean quietly asked, “Enjoying the movie there, Cas?”
The doorbell jingled more forlornly as Claire and Kaia exchanged a confused look.
that Dean felt rather than heard had him sprawling sideways.
“Probably not,” Dean said, spraying down the front of Gabriel’s chocolate case and beginning to rub the fingerprints from the glass.
“Yes, yes—
“How much—”
in simple, printed letters. Castiel was almost distracted by the man’s fantastic biceps, but then his eyes reached his face—hair the color of damp, Labor Day sand, a teasing smirk, and eyes like the olives from a really good martini.
Dean hoped he wasn’t squinting too hard, but he could feel his brow pulling as he tried desperately to concentrate on the woman’s lips. She was speaking so damn
“Look here,
Dean rolled his eyes, pushing Castiel’s hand gently away as he lifted his head from the pillow and wiggled upward a little. “Seriously, I mean it.”
Standing on opposite sides of the bed, Castiel could feel Dean’s gaze crawling across his skin as he reached up and began unbuttoning the soft, navy shirt he’d eventually settled on wearing for the day.
“I, uh—” Castiel’s throat clicked. “Yes. It’s very, uh, suspenseful.”
So, Dean did just that, noting with some pleasure that Castiel was eyeing Dean’s chosen outfit with just as much enjoyment as Dean had for his. Dean smiled as he stepped up to Castiel, letting his gaze drag deliberately up and down his body. Reaching out, he curled his hand into the side of Castiel’s neck and pulled them close, pressing their lips together sweetly for a long minute before he pulled back just enough to breathe out, “Hey, Cas.”
It took six days for Castiel to feel like a human being again. On the sixth day, a bright Tuesday morning, Castiel decided to swallow his pride, fire up the golf cart, and head into town. (Though, actually, thinking of it as a “town” was a bit of a stretch, but Castiel didn’t know what else to call it.) He took his time, chatting with Meg on speakerphone as he rattled down the country lanes.
with it,” Castiel said, sounding as frustrated as Dean felt.
“Cassie,” Balthazar said, pausing in his napkin-mopping to look pointedly at Castiel across the table. He sighed, and his brows lofted into a resigned, put upon expression. “You know that the reason you got that job with Garrison is because I suggested to my Uncle Zachariah that they hire you,” he murmured, somehow both condescending and sweet. “I just don’t want you to go out there, into the world, and be…be
Castiel’s lips thinned only fractionally, but his expression clearly stated that he thought Dean knew perfectly well that
Amara’s eyes left Dean and Castiel very slowly, her brow knitted together like she wasn’t entirely sure what she was seeing, and even less sure that she liked it.
Sam shook himself and shoved his hair back behind his ears. “That’s so cool,” he said, “but I’ll never get used to it.”
“Oh-kay,” Dean said swiftly, tightening his grip on Castiel’s arm before he could make things any worse. “I think we need a timeout in the angel staredown brawl. C’mon, Cas. How about some fresh air, huh?”
“Well, if you would just move,” Castiel threw back at him.
It looked familiar, but Dean had never connected it so literally to the word before. Love.
Advertising boards and ribbon in place for the cutting and photographs—check. Rufus gave Castiel a brief nod through the kitchen window, carrying a large placard listing all the green technology that Dean had spent months installing and upgrading. Behind him came Bobby, looking very pretty with his arms piled full of thick ribbon to string between the two trees that grew either side of the porch.
For a moment Castiel’s eyes closed and he let slip a shaky breath against Dean’s lips. “I’m so glad you made it home to Winchester Hall, Dean.”
“A voice from a different A.I.?” Castiel interjected helpfully, still looking up at Dean as he perched on the bunk.
“Michael,” Castiel greeted Adam politely, dipping his head as he settled into position, smoothing his trench coat around himself.
Dean prickled and grumbled to himself as he sank into the lukewarm water that Alfie—Dean’s personal orderly ever since he’d enlisted—had managed to prepare for him, leaving his muddy clothes in a careless pile on the floor. Castiel wasn’t incorrect by any means, but Dean was going to have to have words with his brother.
Fuck, no, his temperature was fine, Dean realized. A bit damn nippy, actually, without his sheet.
“Cas?” he called, trying to project his voice over the running water, but sounding weak and fearful anyway. “Are you okay in there?”
that we’re all we’ve got? Us and MEG? She says even Xenon is offline.”
Castiel didn’t speak. Instead, his head lolled forward and he nodded against his chest. It was a small motion, but enough to loosen something in Dean's chest.
With a sigh, Castiel stretched his arms up over his head, loosening his tight back muscles, and headed off to the kitchen. If he didn’t find something to entertain Fatback, he’d end up with snout-prints in his paint and missing paintbrushes that turned up halfway up the stairs or in the backyard, dripping fat droplets of
“Dean!” Sam called loudly through the front door, drawing Dean’s head up from the depths of the cardboard box he was buried in. “We’re here!”
“Here,” Castiel said, shrugging his way out of Dean’s red checked shirt. “Take this back, you must be freezing.”
Shaking his head, Castiel huffed out a laugh. “You’re like a toddler. But yes, tomorrow, Dean. You can take me on a blind date with Bellbird Valley.”
“It’s very good,” Castiel said seriously, his gaze fixed on Dean’s face.
Even Sam was giving Dean a little beseeching look. Traitor.
Dean eyed the tan coat with surprise as he lowered their coffees to the table. Castiel didn’t usually wear his trench coat on the weekends. Dean had seen a red leather jacket and a denim one, and one Saturday when he’d looked a bit under the weather, a severely over-washed maroon hoodie. Usually the wrinkled flasher coat was reserved for school, where it hung shapelessly—but strangely endearingly—over Castiel’s staid suits.
Reaching the angled spanking bench, Dean paused to look back over his shoulder. “How would you like me, Sir?”
Castiel frowned a little at that. “I’m sure no one thinks that. Honestly, I’m sure most people have never heard of you.”
“Before Amara was first locked up and the Mark of Cain was originally created, what was the world like?” Sam reached across the table, tugging his untouched coffee toward himself. “Does that back up the theory that even if Chuck is still alive, locking him away will negate his effects?”
But no, it had a use. This was going to be where Dean said goodbye to Cas.
In the tiny bathroom at Trick or Sweet, Dean quickly discarded his floury scrubs into a plastic bag that he’d brought to work specially—Castiel must be rubbing off on him in more than one way, Dean realized with amusement.
come up during exams. His brain was extremely tired, so a little Dr. Sexy while he ordered pizza and waited for Castiel seemed like just the thing.
- Mal <3
Sam made a mumble of agreement, and Dean dawdled back to his bedroom to grab his khaki jacket and deposit the book on his nightstand.
“Yes, please,” Castiel said, reaching down to grab his empty bottle from the floor near his foot and passing it up to Dean. Their fingers brushed around the partially peeled Texan Star label, and Dean found himself biting back a goofy smile.
“Nah, man, it’s cool,” Dean said quickly, waving his hand and returning to the casserole. “I’m just nervous enough without anyone thinking that the only reason I got this job is because I stood in front of a camera, y’know?”
sensation swallowed Dean up, occupying all of his senses...until a wash of darkness came, bringing with it silent, black relief.
“You’re gonna be in big trouble, lover boy.”
“We just said it—souls are powerful. The very strongest magic available to humans, dark or light, taps into souls. Gabriel wasn’t just looking to see if you were strong enough—I think he was looking to see if you had the motivation to do it, the strength of
He found a ship-issue white t-shirt with the
He didn’t want to push Cas into anything he didn’t want, of course, but if Castiel’s elevated breathing was anything to go by, he was definitely getting the idea.
“Alright,” Dean said, grinning cheerfully. “Let me just wash up quickly then, and I’ll drive. My treat.”
“I have plenty of experience with this, Sir. Years. Started at nineteen. I’m fine using red, yellow, and green, and I use ‘Impala’ as an additional safe word. I don’t have any physical boundaries or triggers, though I’m definitely not as flexible as I was ten years ago. My pain tolerance is moderately high, though nothing on some of the women I’ve seen. Health is good—no asthma, nothing like that, no meds like blood thinners that would make suspension a bad idea, if you’re into that.”
Dean didn’t know Lord Armstrong well, but as he moved away from the small circle with Castiel at his side, he couldn’t help but think that his friend looked rather relieved to have been interrupted. Directing them to neutral ground, Dean headed for the drinks table so that he could refill his and Castiel’s punch while they spoke.
“Cas, please,” he said, giving Dean an uncertain smile as he hurriedly cleaned himself. “And you’re Officer Winchester, yes? I’d salute and stuff, but, uh—” He raised a damp hand half-heartedly toward his slimy hair. “—I’m a little underdressed.”
Still looking apprehensive, Castiel nodded.
“Yes,” Castiel admitted, a little faster. “Arousing.”
and Liz on
“No one else I’d ever want connected to it.” Castiel smiled as he echoed Dean’s words. “Though I still want you to tell me the details of all of this—finding Gabriel, and the amulet, and working out how to do this.”
Castiel’s gaze flicked between the open tube in Dean’s hand and himself, nodding silently.
His eyes darted open. Dean flailed, coughing and retching desperately, overcome with panic. He reacted instinctively to the sensation of liquid filling his lungs—by opening his mouth and trying to suck in more air. Something warm, slimy, and thick filled his mouth, only succeeding in choking him further.
“There’s a place on the coast of the U.S.—not entirely clear which state, but southward somewhere? There’s a weird little museum-kinda-thing there. Real kooky place. They have what they claim is the body of a mermaid on display.”
Castiel went stock still, the small rise and dip of his lungs under Dean’s hand catching for a moment. “Yes, I suppose,” he said cautiously after a long pause. “Just…being close. Comfort and companionship, that’s part of it.”
,” the voice droned unhelpfully.
“But you just
, Dean thought, as he stepped firmly into The Lucky Elephant. And that was what mattered.
Working Dean slowly, his hand loose, Castiel rutted up against Dean. Twisting, Dean reached back to kiss whatever he could reach, and was rewarded with the rough stubble of Castiel’s chin.
P.S. As always, if you want updates when I post, please do
bigots here. There were living neanderthals everywhere. But she hadn’t had any issues, and there were plenty of kind, supportive folks.
Dean took his time—he wasn’t an idiot, he was going to savor every second of this. The buttons were small and black, and Dean used the fingers of both hands to push them deliberately though the holes, one by one. Once he’d reached the bottom, tugging the last crumpled few inches of shirt out of Castiel’s pants where he’d had it neatly tucked, Dean reached back up and tugged lightly at his collar—a silent, mouth-occupied request.
Dean wasn’t wearing his badge like he did at work. He hadn’t wanted to stand out, hadn’t wanted to make things harder. Briefly, for the first time all day, he regretted it. His chest was painfully tight, like it was trying to pull back his arm as he raised his hand toward his ear.
“You already know Charlie. You’ve been living in each other's pockets since school started. And you've met Harry, and Ed, and Dorothy,” Sam said, entirely too reasonably.
If you want to chat, send potential prompts, or ask questions, come and join me!
Dean’s jaw ached quickly, though, and there was only so much abuse his throat could take before the discomfort overpowered the eroticism off it. Pulling back caused Castiel to shudder above him, clinging to Dean’s shoulders longingly as he curled forward to catch Dean’s lips with his own again.
They turned left, toward the same engineering lab that Dean had initially used to hack the powerpack and enable MEG’s hologrammatic form. The lights were on within, and as they approached Dean could hear voices.
Dean bit the inside of his cheek.
Phone in hand, Charlie hit the voice-to-text button, her lips moving quickly before she turned the screen to show Dean. They were headed out the door, and Dean stepped aside to let her lock it while he read.
With a tiny, cold smile, Alder looked at Dean. Then he turned, and walked to the other side of the classroom, angling away from Dean entirely as he addressed the room.
awfully as Dean and Sam pushed in unison, shunting it across the floor, against the far wall. Sam grimaced at the noise before grabbing a long-handled broom to sweep the center of the floor. Following his lead, Dean took the second broom from where they’d been propped in the corner.
Grinning triumphantly, Dean turned back to Castiel. Their eyes met for a moment—
Castiel’s blade came forward in an arc that would have been deadly if this was any other fight. He embedded it just below Amara’s collarbone, inchest deep, but she didn’t even flinch. Dark smoke poured from the wound.
“Benny’s getting him set up for the day,” Dean said, feeling strangely proud. Benny was an old friend from grad school that he’d worked with a few times over the years. He’d always kept Dean up to date with the sites that he was overseeing, and it was him that had reached out to let Dean know about the palace they were currently working on, long before its discovery became public.
It wasn’t like the fucker was right, or anything like that.
for her time and patience.
“Oh?” said Castiel, digging his wallet out of his pocket and strolling past the busy tables up to the register. “Who by?”
It didn’t take too long to pull up to one of Dean’s favorite diners, just outside of town on the other side of Lebabon.

It’s all Dean has left.
“Yeah, have breakfast with me,” Sam offered before Castiel could answer. “My wife is out of town visiting my in-laws, so some company would be nice. And you did promise to tell me all about your plans for Bellbird Valley Farm.”
We've got another gorgeous (and funny!) art piece from the amazing
“He loved you,” Sam begins, clear and loud and entirely obscene for a time earlier than breakfast.
Castiel held out his punch glass with another of the tiny smiles that Dean had noticed earlier—he didn’t seem prone to overwhelming outbursts of emotion, almost stoic, but his eyes...every time Dean dared to look into them, he drowned. They were deep, even if he kept the rest of himself carefully shallow.
“So,” Balthazar finally said, as if he’d spent the whole time trying to work out what to say, “tell me about this place you’re in.”
Dean’s skepticism was written in the air by the smooth rise and fall of his eyebrow once more, but he didn’t leave, and as close as they were, Castiel could detect his low, sudden intake of breath.
For a split second, Dean took in the slick, black spill of oil that coated the floor beneath his feet. Something was…
The popcorn smell, the hot dogs, the people…a lot of people. Dean had mentioned it to Sam, so of course, Sam had come to support him. Along with Jo, and Charlie. Castiel had mentioned the movie at home, so a whole truckload of his siblings had turned up, too. After all, who doesn’t love Bruce Willis movies?
he got to react the same way as everyone around him; the movie went on and he laughed when they laughed, and gasped when they gasped, and by the time Leeloo was escaping through the ventilation system, Dean’s throat was tight and there was a strange prickling behind his eyes.
“You’re right,” Dean admitted. “We really haven’t communicated well. Especially the last few years, but not ever. And I’m sorry for my part in that. I’ve messed up a lot, Cas. Not just in life but…with you.”
Trying his very best to forget about death by suffocation and killing three million people including his own brother, Dean took to the stage and belted out a rip-roaring rendition of AC/DC’s “Thunderstruck”.
Hello, folks!
Smiling, Dean went off to take his shower. It used to be hard to watch Castiel drag himself around. But eventually, Dean had adjusted his view. Castiel would ask for Dean’s help if he needed it, and Dean carried him from A to B. But within the cabin, Castiel needed his independence. He hated the way Dean cared for him on land—he didn’t hate Dean for doing it, but Dean knew it reminded him of the fact he should have been able to stand and walk and do everything for himself. Dean had learned that to truly help Castiel, he had to let him be stubborn. The worst thing he could do was make him feel weak.
The tiniest flush rose behind Castiel’s ears, and Dean immediately decided that he would try and recreate it as often as possible.
When they landed, Michael’s grip loosening on Dean’s shoulder, they were in a small room with reddish, planked walls and gently blowing yellow curtains. It was quiet. Incense tickled Dean’s nose, wafting cones and dishes of
Castiel allowed himself one big, deep sigh of frustration before moving back down the desolate platform and back to his suitcase and backpack. Now that the train had screeched its way on southwards and away, Castiel could see that there was a road on the opposite side of the tracks which led downhill and off between the fields. He squinted back and forth, but…that was it. A single road. No bus stop, no subway, not a building in sight. How was he even supposed to get over there?
Castiel frowned but looked curious despite himself. “Does that help us?”
“Oh,” she drawled slowly, “I am
He’d connected with Castiel.
“So,” Castiel began, “how do you think our first date went?”
Dean felt the slow smile spread over his face. “You might be onto something there, Novak. Who needs a medic, huh? Not when you’ve got a…” he trailed off, realizing that he had no idea what Castiel did.
Dean was barely aware of Castiel beside him, gazing out across the universes, until he blurted, “Do you think this is too far to be any part of us?”
No, this was definitely real life. The fruit punch seeping into his sock through the hole in the bottom of his shoe confirmed that.
And I will begrudgingly admit that was quite funny.
Internally, Dean made a crushed, despairing sound like the dying groan of a pitiful creature. Externally, he plastered on a smile and made a damn coffee.
at midnight.”
I have an important question this week, though! I have another fic that needs to start posting soon - it's a Deaf Dean mature student AU, a slow burn fic with Dean learning a lot more than Engineering from his time at school.
“Just a quick form,” Castiel said, noticing, as he sat back down. He shoved his hand into his pocket—causing Dean to register, for the first time, that Castiel was dressed in grey sweatpants and an old Kansas State t-shirt, as if he’d run out of the house in what he’d slept in—and pulling out his wallet. From within he retrieved a red license, credit-card sized, and began to swiftly input the numbers and details onto the form. “As I’m not family, this facility requires that I be licensed in order to stay with you and interpret.”
“Cas—Cas,” Dean panted into the side of Castiel’s face.
Castiel frowned and slowly slid his hands back in front of himself so that he could sign as he talked.
Castiel gave him a strange look, tilting his head to the side in bafflement. “Yes…?” he responded, entirely unsure.
With two black coffees and a handful of honey packets, Dean made his way to the window seat that Castiel had found, a small bistro table beneath an industrial-looking hanging light. It looked out over the pavement to the pretty sandstone bricks of Seaton Hall, huge and overbearing, not at all like the modern bulk of Engineering Hall or the square bleakness of Cardwell, where Dean’s math classes were.
for me,” Dean responded instantly, returning his boyfriend’s grin. “But that’s just it, they’re for me.”
Suppressing a yawn, Dean shook his head and asked, “How have you and your family been doing with all this social distancing, Cas? You said you were calling your brother the other day.”
So, Dean left Cole’s backpack where it was and headed to the office.
“God, it even sounds like a hick town. Really, Cas—”
Then back up.
Castiel’s eyes were huge as they rested on Dean, an unspoken question very evident on his parted lips, though he kept it to himself. Instead he turned, walking toward the chair where Dean had deposited his trench coat and shucking the suit jacket and white dress shirt from his arms to leave them there with his outer layer.
Dean was just as thwarted for the rest of the evening. He found his eyes pulling to Castiel whenever he was near, and more than once (he hoped, though he realized it may well have been wishful thinking) he caught Castiel turning his head swiftly as if he’d been caught in much the same action.
Sam didn’t seem to mind the bunker grind as much, but then Sam was a man who had “huge ancient library” at the top of the list for his dream home if there ever was one. Dean’s dream home, on the other hand, just had a picket fence, a couple of La-Z-Boys in front of a widescreen TV, and an oven that heated evenly.
The coffee was the pick-me-up. Not the absolutely beautiful barista. Or so Castiel kept trying to remind himself.
With one final look around the bedroom he’d spent nearly an hour setting up, Dean took a deep breath. “Yeah, come on in, Cas.”
Castiel didn’t speak up and rescue him, so Dean had to get the rest of the words out before the silence became too awkward.
“I’m gonna carry you,” Dean stated. “There’s a car outside. I can get you somewhere with water in under an hour. You said thirty minutes before, so I hope you can make it that long.”
So back over the bar he leaped, laying claim to an actual bottle of Johnnie Walker whiskey from up on the top shelves, where the genuine Earth liquor was stocked. The label said it had been made in 2209, so it was at least ninety years old. That, he guessed, might be the real difference between the officers’ bar and the one he’d been permitted to frequent.
With a click, the door Dean was standing in front of unlocked and he pushed it wide. Not even stopping to see what kind of creature occupied the room, Dean called within, “Run! The building’s on fire!”
But that was as far as they’d managed to get.
Once he’d wrestled his way into the pajama pants and given up on a shirt, Castiel’s final coffee stirrer of energy seemed to snap, and he flopped back into the bed.
“I kept all of yours, too,” Dean said, wanting to put him at ease. It seemed natural to reach out for Castiel’s hand, to pull him close, to press their lips together again, soft and sure and with growing familiarity.
shirt and some old sweat pants so that he could begin taking a look at the parts Bobby had provided. The pants were a little low in the waist and tight in the butt, washed far too many times, but they’d do just fine for the mess he was bound to make of himself while attempting this.
“So,” Dean continued, unable to contain his grin as he pulled Castiel into his side, “from me and my handsome, adventurous fiancé...thank you so much for watching, and don’t forget to like, comment, and subscribe for more of our wedding adventure!”
“There’s no one,” Dean said, taking deliberate steps forward as he spoke. When they were almost chest to chest, he tossed his mask onto the chair and grabbed the pen without even looking at it, then scrawled heavily across the bottom of the waiver that sat—right where Dean had left it—atop the table. “Only one person has caught my eye since I moved to Charming Acres.”
From the gummy smile and the fluttering kisses, Dean guessed that Castiel was pleased with his response.
Obediently, Dean moved over to stand next to Castiel, crunching over the sandy ground. “How’s it going?” he asked, peering sideways at their work.
he continued, fists balled, focusing everything he could on Cas, and his desperate desire for him to come back,
If Cas wanted to hover, Dean was going to let him hover.
Dean stopped making Baby express his mood, swinging her smoothly into the parking lot behind Harrington’s Diner. She certainly didn’t need to bear the brunt of his frustration and boredom. As the love of his life, she deserved better. His car was the one part of Dean’s life that looked like it fit here in Charming Acres—the gleaming 1967 Chevrolet Impala was a gorgeous classic that he lovingly maintained and preened over. He got a lot of compliments on her, especially at the diner.
Not wet enough, though, Dean decided.
After weaving around a few vehicles in various states of repair, she stopped and held out the keys to Dean. “Here you go. She’s all yours—fix her up good, now.”
There it was. The door of the walk-in closet, on the other side of the empty room, was shut but rattling.
Bobby chuckled, handing both of the taps back to Castiel. “Well, we all start somewhere, son.”
Dean was surprised—but immensely pleased—to see that Castiel spoke clearly and calmly enough that Dean barely missed a word. He looked back at Ms. Moseley, asking, “I’d still get the same credits that I need, just like if I did the in-person class?”
“Let me help you with that,” Dean said, still grinning. He pushed past Castiel to the buffet table and grabbed a handful of mismatched party napkins, returning in two confident strides. “It’s nice to finally meet you, I gotta say.”
Room four was a small, standard examination room. A tall, black doctor in a knee-length white coat over simple black scrubs waited for them inside.
“Yes, Winchester.”
As soon as the back of his tattered trench coat had disappeared, Michael turned to Dean.
Hello, folks!
, or check out my
Dean’s favorite time to be in the Bunker was during the downtime between their smaller cases. He enjoyed when the current Big Bad had been vanquished and they weren’t dodging any beings from higher planes who thought humans were just toys, or chess pieces, or ants. The times when it was quieter, when everything was calmer, when they weren’t running in circles…Dean really liked the bunker then. When it was busy, Dean spent his time eternally looping between his bedroom, the war room, and the library, with occasional stops for food and whiskey. It got stuff done, sure, but it was pretty dull.
“Thank you,” Dean quickly signed to Castiel as Professor Adler moved to close the door and begin. He didn’t like causing a problem, standing out—but Castiel hadn’t made a big deal of it, hadn’t made Dean feel like he was somehow more work than anyone else. It felt like a simple problem with a simple solution.
“Actually, you can’t.”
“Just you and me,” Castiel repeated in agreement, nodding. “How it should always be.”
Castiel forced a smile onto his face. This was fine. He was fine.
Thank you so much for reading! Did you like Liz's art of Cas all hunched up in his trenchcoat? I loved it, I just want to smush his little cheeks, haha!
“You can’t talk about classy drinking habits anyway,” Dean pointed out as he watched Castiel scan the shelves. “You drank half a bottle of cheap tequila the last time we were here.”
The hallway was thicker with sooty smoke than Castiel’s room had been. Even as close as they were, Castiel’s eyes were getting harder to see, the lights above them failing to penetrate the gloom as Dean moved further away from Castiel’s room. Even so, he saw the merman gaze listlessly around, frowning curiously at the corridor.
for other social media.
What else is coming up soon, writing-wise? Well, of course, next Tuesday we'll be back to these two for their not-date-date, but I also have a one-shot fic posting in the next week for one of my lovely Patreon supporters, and there's also an update to
Dean looked across at Adam—his posture was straighter than it had been only moments before and his face more solemn.
Have a great week!
Dean shrugged as he made his way toward Sam, kicking a box of books into a spot opposite the couch and lowering himself down onto it, leaving the space next to Sam for Eileen. Apparently, shrugging was a poor move, because Sam’s eyebrows rose, wandering their way up his large forehead thoughtfully.
Castiel blinked, abandoning his fluffy pastry for a moment. “I didn’t mean to offend him! He provided a service, is all, and it’s not like we’ve known each other long or even really—”
“Jo,” Dean protested, touched. “You don’t have to do that.”
Dean was a man of action, not words.
“Wanna explain that, buddy?” Dean choked out, his over-moistened mouth all of a sudden dry, pulled along behind this strange, half-naked man as he trudged swiftly down the corridor, moving as fast as their wet feet would safely let them.
He could…
“You did,” Castiel admitted. He slid onto the cushions and into the space Meg had offered, pulling up his feet and making a small misery-ball in the middle of the couch. He settled, and then threw back the shot glass that Meg handed over without so much as a grimace.
Apologies for texting you so late, but my plans for Saturday just changed. I’m free after 2 now, if you’d like to meet for a lesson?
Castiel frowned. “I don’t snore, I’m not sure why it is so very offensive that—”
“Almost ready outside,” he said. “Sam’s got the sound system set up, chairs are out, food is going onto the tables, and Bobby and Rufus are getting the ribbon up.”
“Not out here you can’t.”
Dean felt his cheeks pinching from the huge, helpless grin that spread across his face. It was mirrored on Castiel, a pinkish flush from the cold—and, perhaps, Dean hoped, from a little something else—highlighting the apples of his cheeks as he beamed, wide enough to show his gums and perfectly straight upper teeth.
“See?” Dean asks, putting her gently back in her bed. “Nothing to be afraid of, bug.” He kisses her forehead and wipes away what’s left of her tears. “You gonna be okay to sleep again?” he asks her, and she squirms deeper beneath her covers so that only her bright green eyes are showing.
“Love you, bug,” Dean murmurs, skimming his fingers over her corn silk hair. He turns away from her and moves to hang her princess dress back in the closet. He steals one last look at her steadily moving chest and fluttering eyes before smiling and leaving her room.
“Dean,” Sam says pointedly, but Dean just cuts him a glare. Ellen approaches and wraps them each in a big hug.
Dean hangs up the phone, puts the voicemails away. He barely leaves his bed that day, doesn’t leave the house at all.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Cas,” Dean murmurs, a dark, slow sadness filling his chest.
“Yes! I-” but then Dean is dragging Cas in by the bare of his shoulders and kissing him, open-mouthed and desperate and needy. Cas kisses him back fiercely, his hands wild and frantic, his tongue demanding, but then everything is gone as Cas shoves him away roughly, eyes shining.
The years pass just like that. Dean splits his time between his house and Cas’, laughing and crying and telling everything to Cas, watching out for Sammy. Twelve years later finds them much in the same place. A few differences, of course. Dean’s hair is darker, leveling out at a light brown, sandy blonde if you squint. Cas’ hair is darkest, coming in at a shocking coal, chocolate brown in just the right light. Anna turned out hot, thin and curved and porcelain. Sam turned out tall, what he lacks in muscle made up for in his ever growing height. Cas turned out gay, trusting only Dean with the fact. Dean is in the drama club, but none of that matters. The only thing that matters is the silence falling around them.
An eternity of silence passes.
Slight self-harm in this chapter. Not cutting or anything, but Dean being a dumbass and hitting shit until his knuckles split, also homophobia,
“Jerk,” Sam calls, bringing a smile to Dean’s lips. When Dean makes it to bed, he lays there for hours. He’d be lying if he said he was thinking of anything other than Cas. Dean was right though, Saturday morning breaks around them with rays of sun struggling to cut through the thick clouds. Dean has slept in intervals of twenty minutes at a time, each time snapping himself awake with sharp blue eyes on his mind. He’s spent the time he isn’t dreaming of Cas, thinking of Cas, and feeling pussy as fuck for it. It doesn’t matter though. None of it matters. All that matters is that he can’t, for the life of him, stop thinking that he wants Cas for real, and eventually, he has had enough.
“How do I know that if I leave, you won’t go back on our deal?” Dean is weak. Dean wants Sam to have the world, and he’s not dumb enough to think he can give it to him, try as he might.
“Same for you,” she says, a grin on her face, and Dean smiles.
“Why didn’t you answer?”
Then, he lowers himself down, pressing them together collar to ankle.

Dean’s brain goes to static. His fist clenches at Cas’ back, the trench coat straining under his fingers.

in the otherwise void.
“I love you,” Dean whispers finally, voice just as soft as the very first time. Cas offers Dean a small smile.
“Love you too,” Dean murmurs after a moment of stunned silence, a smile tugging on his lips.
They start slow. After all, it’s been ten years, and there is a lot of lost time to make up for. They start by making themselves familiar again with the other’s mouth, licking and groaning and moaning and only stopping to breathe long enough to assure them both that this is real, that after ten years of wrong and ten years of
“Oh,” she says, stretching out the word to follow her understanding. “That makes more sense. So his wife took their daughter, and he blames you?” Cas nods. He tosses back the rest of his coffee. “That’s rough,” she says, and Cas nods again.

“I-I would love nothing—ah!—nothing more than to fuck you,” he bites out, panting as Dean sucks hickey after hickey into his neck.
“Bobby’s…Lebanon…Vermont. I don’t know.” He doesn’t know anything anymore. He just knows he can’t stay here with her, with his father, with
They stop by Bobby’s room to relay the story—surprise, surprise, Bobby doesn’t think it’s a great idea to go see John—and then head out with Dean once again behind the wheel of his Baby. He just sits in her for a while, listening to her purr as he revs her. Then he drives he like he’s never driven anything so superb in his life, and to him, he hasn’t. Baby is his, and he is Baby’s, and that is a bond that should never have been broken.
Then she disappeared for a few hours, and when she came back, she was tear stained and laughing. She was
Dean grins wolfishly at them as they all leave, but when he turns back to Cas, his grin softens and eyes roam slowly. He steps forward with an arm outstretched, and when he’s close enough, his palm brushes across Cas’ stubbled cheeks and pull him softly closer.
“Great,” Meg drawls, stepping closer and wrapping an easy arm around Cas’ waist. Dean watches his downfall without emotion on his face. He watches Meg sidle closer and closer to Cas, and he watches Cas grin back at her before Dean decides he’s had enough and walks away. If he weren’t so busy deciding that he never had a shot with Cas anyway, he might applaud Meg on her form. If he’d just said what he was trying to ten seconds sooner, then maybe Cas would be
“You’re going to unzip my pants and take out my cock,” Castiel instructed. “You’re going to take a condom from my back pocket and put it on me. Then, I’m going to fuck your mouth.”
And eventually, several weeks later, he decided to mention it.
Castiel nodded. “Yes. My dating attempts before that weren’t great either. So, clearly, you can see why I gave up on dating entirely and resigned myself to living at home and reading poetry on roofs.”
After the successful spell, Castiel can take human form for the first time in years. Once they return to the cabin, he requests to share something with Dean that he's never been able to do before, an experience at least somewhat untainted by his time imprisoned at the Ranch. Dean happily acquiesces, and when they're done, they snuggle up in the bed together and talk. Dean tells Castiel that, as strange as it may sound, he misses his talons. Castiel is surprised, and Dean reiterates that he loves Cas in every form, and he doesn't expect or want him to always look human now just because he can. Dean also gently brings up the idea of cutting back on hunting, staying closer to the sea, closer to Cas - after all, he can't just go riding around the country and leave part of his soul behind, can he? Although tentative, Castiel is very happy indeed that Dean would consider that.
As a younger man, Dean would have balked at being described as pretty. He was
Dean pulled himself up onto the rock, so he could perch on the edge of it with his feet in the water below. The water was cold, but not freezing, too early in the season for him to give up his frequent sea paddles just yet.
Dean, or perhaps somewhere
Above him, Castiel watched with wide, dark eyes, his hand still knotted gently in Dean’s hair. He let go only to push up on the couch a little, lifting his hips and settling into the perfect position.
It wasn’t like he’d
Dean’s palms were sweating, and his heartbeat was picking up in a way that wasn’t sexy in the slightest.
Before he looked up to answer, Castiel slowly pulled his sandwich out of its parchment wrapping, taking care to catch all of the paper and shove it back into the bigger bag so that it didn’t blow around in the breeze. He smiled gratefully, sinking his teeth in for a big bite—and
history, not just analyzing and theorizing and writing. He could do this. Dean had convinced him, over and over, during the entire academic year while they waited, hand in hand, for the summer to roll around, that he could do this. That he was allowed. That he deserved to.
They’d talked for hours a day for several weeks by then. He was just used to it, Dean reasoned.
He looked like some kind of reverse raccoon. Castiel bit his lip in amusement. “So, a bird’s nest,” he said lightly.
Dean continued staring at Adler’s back, picking out a pull of thread in his sweater vest. Dean wanted to yank at it and choke the asshole with the resulting yarn.
“Good,” Claire said, sounding genuinely happy. “It’s about time that old house felt loved again, and I think it’s good for Dean. You too, actually—you’ve got way less of a stick up your butt than when you arrived.”
“MEG,” Castiel called out, throwing his arms up in the air. “Can you explain to us how to get this working?”
For now, lets get back to Dean and Castiel and their space disaster, woo!
Dean had no idea what the note was or what it meant, but from the way Castiel’s shoulder fins shot upward like wings about to take flight, Dean took it to be a positive sound.
Despite dreaming of it for months, Dean was totally unprepared for how good being kissed by Castiel actually felt. He smelled musky and lemony and warm, his jaw was strong and rough with the tiniest bit of stubble, and he was just the slightest bit shorter than Dean was, their faces slotting together just right, puzzle piece perfect.
Castiel thought fondly.
, just a deal they made. That sounded more like the start of something.
Castiel’s hand was efficient, skilled in a way that Dean didn’t want to think about. He just wanted to lose himself in this, instead—this all-encompassing feeling of
At Sam’s encouraging nod, he threw them in.
Turning, doing up his own shirt, Castiel smiled at the sight of his handsome boyfriend in a white dress shirt, holding a tie up close to his neck. He was still lightly flushed, his hair mussed, the right kind of afterglow noticeable to anyone who might know to look. In the morning sunshine that lit their bedroom with bright, spring light, he looked glorious.
Dean looked warily at Sam before giving up and explaining, “He always publishes as C. Novak and that’s it. I wasn’t even sure which pronouns were right for a long time. Then, when I started googling, I realized that it was useless without a first name, because there is a Czech figure skater who goes by C. Novak, too. He’s very prolific. Great spins.”
The carrots flew everywhere, and Dean let out a high-pitched
“Then you should have been shunned!” Dean shouted, feeling heat in his face and fists. “You never deserved to be his family in the first place!”
“Uh.” Castiel didn’t seem sure. He rolled his shoulders, looking torn, as Dean slipped one of his favorite mixtapes into the tape deck.
Dean turned his gaze to Sam, disbelieving.
- Mal <3
Hello, Dean. This is Castiel, again. I wanted to apologize if I offended you before, by offering to pay for your kindness. I did not intend to.
Cabin forgotten, Dean turned.
The guy raised one of those stupidly perfect eyebrows and gave out a tiny, snarky grin. “I’m the one that’s lived here my whole life, so maybe you’re the one where I am,” he suggested.
Within minutes, Dean gave up trying to lipread and relied wholly on Castiel. The doctor was kind and thorough, but she spoke way too fast and moved her hands distractingly while she went through his forms and asked additional questions.
The world is reforming—they have a plan, they’re working, fighting.
“I’m sorry that I was late. This morning I accompanied my older brother Joshua to an appointment and his doctor was running behind. Then I was supposed to go with ~~ to sit in on an interview with his peer review committee, but they moved it to a later time slot because we were late, and then Gabriel—”
Castiel turned more fully, pulling back from Dean to look at him oddly.
“Oh, unused, is it?” the snarky man said, stepping back to let Castiel closer to the car.
“Yes?”
Was something
With his core tightening, pressure low in his pelvis that he could no longer ignore, Dean squeezed his eyes shut and cried out desperately, a formless sound.
“Apologies if that was rude,” Dean said, “barging in like that, but I’ve been wanting to speak to you all night.”
“Why you
That was a bad sign. That was a really bad sign.
Sitting up straighter, Dean pushes his hands up over his face and breathes in a little more air. “Sure. Right. Yeah, I’ll—I’ll get dressed.”
“So, what are you going to tell him?”
Moving one hand down to Castiel’s hip, he encouraged him up and over, resting on Dean instead, his tail between Dean’s legs. On top; in control.
Dean wiped the rest of the lubricant that was clinging to his hand onto his inner thighs before closing them, clamping them firmly—but not too tight—around Castiel’s dick.
one of the shot glasses against Cas’ and threw it back. It was some kind of vodka, he thought. A flavored kind? By then he could barely taste and barely cared. He grimaced, forcing it to stay down, before he looked back up at Castiel.
This man—the man he’d near enough fallen in love with just from ink on pages—turned out to be everything Dean had ever desired, and so much more. Dean felt full of it, full to breaking, and he just had to—
Morbidly curious, Dean strolled around to the other side of the table to take a peek, and—
Castiel smirked into his bottle as he brought it to his lips. “When
what Dean expected.
“How do you have three ladles but no bowls?” Sam asked, lifting up his container of wonton soup and slurping from the edge.
Above Dean, Castiel shook softly as he strained to thrust into Dean’s hand—but Dean held Castiel’s hip firm, stroking with a steady, slow rhythm.
Was this...was this in the book?
“We’ve got quite the list of sexy activities to try,” Dean said as they strolled along the tarmac path beside the water.
Stepping back toward Dean, Castiel’s fingers landed on the ties of his undershirt. For a moment his gaze rested on his own hands, paused, before he looked beseechingly up at Dean through his eyelashes.
Once he’d made it halfway across the beach, to a patch of dry, relatively flat sand, Dean dumped the heavy duffle he was hauling down from his shoulder. Witchcraft—he hated it. It was always creepy, and involved, and often heavy. And usually stinky, too, now that he thought of it.
That was…an unfortunate point, Castiel had to concede. And where was his phone, anyway? He looked around, trying to work out if he’d accidentally packed it, or—
And it was bothering him. It made him feel strangely vulnerable in a way he didn’t like. Dean was getting better at making friends—though if he was honest, it was mostly that Charlie was doing it for him, these days. She didn’t stand for his nonsense, which was as refreshing as it was annoying. But Cas…Cas was something different.
“Coffee’s already on the table, Cas,” Claire called, harried and greasy and looking like she was having a terrible day.
But this was for the best. Better now than later.
After hovering awkwardly in the seat for a long enough minute that Dean raised an eyebrow in concern, Castiel forcibly cleared his throat. “I had a great time today, Dean.”
- Mal <3
“Bigger than yours,” she said, winking. “Drink your coffee, Romeo. I don’t wanna be here until four in the morning.”
Already striding off down the path, all wranglers and paint splatters and fantastic shoulders, the man slipped straight back into the shiny black Impala, which was parked right in front of the house, and slammed the door even as Castiel shouted behind him, “Wait! How am I supposed to call you? I don’t even know your name!”
