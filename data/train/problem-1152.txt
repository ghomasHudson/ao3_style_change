After a moment, she reached for a cup with a straw, allowing Sherlock to drink. “Where's John? Rosie?” He asked after he had taken a small sip. Mrs Hudson and stiffened and placed the cup back down, with nothing in her hands, she placed them on her knees, fiddling with the material of a hospital gown. But still stared at Sherlock, her eyes glistening with unshed tears.
"John"? Sherlock's whisper startled John out of his musing, and he turned to face him. "Well?" Sherlock asked carefully, his voice soft, gentle as though he was approaching a wounded animal.
“I'm sure Anthea or Mycroft has told you about the situation?” He asked, placing one hand against the cot bed, turning to put himself in the way of his daughter. No matter how kind the man looked, John was taking no chances.
"John?" Sherlock asked, watching with interest. He scanned the basket and his heart hammered against his chest, this is not something he had planned for. But he his his panic well and watched his best friend closely.
John looked up from his laptop, a raised brow but a smirk on his face. "Or. It could be twins?"
“Mycroft.” John held his quiet, sleeping daughter close to him. “Sherlock's in surgery and I need the best paediatrician that you have and that you trust with Anthea's niece. Rosie was with those two sick bastards and I need to know she's okay. She's too quiet, to tired and too warm.” John didn't falter, he was in soldier mode. He couldn't lose it, not now. The people he cared most about, the people that he loves are injured by a mad man. Silently he vows to make sure the next bullet hits Moriarty between the eyes.
(Edited: 02/01/2018)
“Do it.” Was all Sherlock said as Mycroft entered the room, holding a brown envelope in his hand and a look of utter murder on his face. “Molly, would you mind taking Rosie out of the room for just a moment please.” He said, his calm demeanor never waving but his eyes not giving her a chance to argue. She did as was asked, giving Sherlock's hand a quick squeeze, and Lestrade a quick kiss on her way out.
Sherlock stared at the two photos a little more and grinned. “Oh. Of course. How could I have ever missed that!?”
“I take it this is all about Sherlock!” John hissed, anger in his voice, “if you so much as..” John paused for a second, anger never leaving his face. “Me? Why has this got to do with … What!? … I don't … Fine! You want a trade I will give you one. Return Rosie to the hospital and I'll leave with you … Of course there's no tricks, I'm still suffering from the pissing truth serum idiot! … What? .. yes I do … What do you mean Say ,.. FINE! I love Sherlock! There! Now, as you said … hello. Hello? Hello!!” With that, John threw the phone against the wall in a fit of rage, the scream escaping him full on anguish and despair Sherlock shifted slightly.
“No, actually. He killed himself.. He probably knew what you were up to and rescheduled our little meeting. He was suicidal anyway, sentiment.” Sherlock shrugged, John flinched as Jim growled, Rosie wailed and the two agents rose from their knees, one in front of John, blocking his view of Rosie and raised his gun, the other in front of Sherlock The difference was that as soon as Jim pointed towards Sherlock, the agent fired and Sherlock went down with a gasp.
“Oi!” The man dared to stop John in his tracks, a hand laid to rest against his chest. John glared. “you're not going anywhere...” The man's sentence ended with a cry of pain, as John took the offending hand off of his chest and twisted until the wrist broke. The chief Inspector ended on his knees.
John had opened the letter, read quickly and crushed the paper in his hands. The child was his. The child wasn't even named. Born two weeks ago, premature, Mary had left her at his door step and vanished. she had mentioned she did not want anything to do with the child, but had care to know John wanted children at some point, and would make a great father. The note had confirmed that she will not be back to make a claim for their daughter and only had one wish, that he will look after her.
Once upstairs in the bedroom, he watched Sherlock with Rosie, his leg touching the other man's. He watched as Rosie fell asleep in his arms and watched as Sherlock put her back in her cot gently. No one could ever tell John this man didn't care.
(See the end of the chapter for
Thinking back on that short conversation made John want to cry but he couldn't. Their daughter needed him now, and true to the caller's word, a car had pulled up at the pick up point of the hospital. John was wheeled to the car and Mycroft stepped back as two men came to help John into the back seat. No words were spoken as John was driven away. He turned to look out of the back window in time to see Rosie passed to Mycroft, and then there was nothing as he felt a jab in his neck. Darkness surrounded him and he slipped into blissful unconsciousness once more.
There was a sound of a door opening and closing behind him, a few sets of footsteps coming closer, one stopping just short of himself, the other sets going around behind him. He assumed one was gathering the chain from a hook in the wall. John was right as he felt his arms being pulled, bringing his legs up just so his toes scraped across the concrete floor. It was then that he realised he was only in his boxers, nothing else covering him and again he groaned. A laugh caught his attention but he kept his head down to his chest, if he tried to lift it up, he would defiantly be sick.
“Carl Powers. Jim had to stop him from laughing. He never said who he was laughing at.” Sherlock did feel a pang of pity for Richard, only slightly. After all, he still threatened His John.
"We have a case, my little Rosie." Sherlock whispered as he gently lifted the child from the crib and held her close. She wasn't crying, just wanted to be held.
Sherlock stormed into the interview room, “This stops right now! Can't you see that man is having a panic attack! He suffers from PTSD and you shove pictures of his ex partner in his face, a woman who had loved is dead and this is how you tell him!” Sherlock was more than angry, he was furious. “I will have your badge for this Donovan, you mark my words! I'll have the chief's job as well, interviewing a man without so much as a lawyer in attendance and for what!?”
Then he texted Lestrade. He needed details, he needed answers and he needed to know why Lestrade had not warned them first.
(See the end of the chapter for
Just gonna put a warning here for mentions of suicide - very slight and tiny but still.
As soon as the cab reached his destination, Sherlock practically threw notes at the driver and all but jumped from the cab. Lestrade was waiting as directed.
“I just got the call.” Greg said as in welcome, walking in step with Sherlock. He sounded out of breath, must have ran from the Morgue. Dating Molly seems to be going well …
“Hello?” John asked as he took the phone, Sherlock sitting up and watching intently, ignoring his brother as he watched John stiffen, the grip on phone tightening. If only he could hear the other end of the conversation.
John went silent and limp as the hand released his hair, his head dropping back to his chest. John's shoulders shook, but not due to cold or the want of more serum. But due to tears that fell for his fallen comrades.
Sherlock sighed heavily and looked up, his heat ache showing on his face and he heard Molly gasp.
Sherlock came round slowly, pain building but it was manageable. More like a dull ache really. Morphine was a lovely drug. Though, with his tolerance, he would surely need a top up soon. He had always wondered what it would be like to be shot, often asking John how it felt. Well, now he knew, and he hated it!
"Therefore, you found that you hand too stick your nose in where it is not wanted. John does not, and will not be on his own in this. We don't need you and your sniveling. Good day."
Sherlock worked best with everything in front of him. He never understood how John could work from the laptop alone. He needed to see everything, every bit of data laid out in front of him. It was easier to deduce when he had all the data. The cases were obviously Moriarty haunting him, taunting him. Possibly even laughing at him. But why now? Sherlock had been back for a couple of months now, so why not the day he returned? What was he planning?
"Stop!" Sherlock forced out, staring at his best friend, taking in the worry, fear, panic. Everything that John was going through at that very moment screamed at Sherlock. "You are not alone. You and Rosie will stay here for as long as you need to. Forever and longer if needs be. No one is going to hurt her, no one is going to take her away from you, I promise."
John was wheeled to the front of the hospital, his body shivering and it wasn't from the cold. His face was killing him, his stomach felt heavy and empty all at the same time and he felt sick. He knew what was coming and he knew he couldn't prevent it. He was unconscious for the effects of the serum but his body remembered. His body wanting more, refusing the logic of John's mind and his will power. His body was betraying as it always does.
The crowd fell into a silence all on a sudden as everyone stared at the detective who was standing beside his brother at that moment.
“Could be…who knows?”
In recognition to their top notch service, Sherlock and John are awarded in a grand dinner. The detective meets a familiar face whom he once and still, dislikes and John gets to spend time with his old chap. Sherlock's ramblings continue as John remains occupied with his fiancee which later takes form of a medley that leaves John drowning into thoughts once again.
“Who said we're going to Highlands?” Sherlock asked with a hint of amusement. “Neither dead nor alive.” His face slowly lost the smirk as a clear smile took its place. “We shall disappear from Baker Street, from London itself.”
He was rather angry, disappointed, and sad than being delighted to see him at that moment. Why should he? How he grieved, how he cried, how he prayed and wished for Sherlock to return for once more- to him. How he wanted to see the tall, skinny figure pacing across the room and asking him for a case. On the other hand, he kept fleeing from one place to another time-to-time, faking identities, lurking in the woods, searching for underground organizations and connections.
The next moments were of listening to Sherlock’s monologue for both John and Lestrade- how Sherlock got into all these, consequently solving the murder.
He placed his fingers steadily on the strings and soon, notes of music started to fill the silent atmosphere.
“Me? What's going on in there?”
Mary, on the other hand, was having a quality time with John in the Richmond Park – just a few meters away from the Pen Ponds as well as Richmond Park. They went to visit Pembroke Lodge, the old Georgian mansion and had lunch in the gardens which offered the most breathtaking views from there. It was truly beautiful, spending the moments of her lifetime in such a wondrous place with the person she loved and cared for the most. They even rode on horseback and John enjoyed fishing in the ponds, although his patience soon wore off and couldn’t catch a single fish, unfortunately. Even fishing reminded him of Sherlock. That man perhaps, had all the patience and skill in the world when it came to this subject; something apart from detective work. He even once talked about fishing, how he was the one catching most of the fishes in a short amount of time, leaving the others startled on one of his visits to a certain lake which John could not remember the name of at the present.
“Of course I’m not _lying.”_
It was near about nine in the morning when Sherlock was laying on his bed with his eyes fixed on the ceiling. Words of different sorts were rambling inside his head on this point, the aftermath of an expected but again, the least expected case he had got himself into early this morning.
After a span of twenty minutes searching around the apartment for that piece of paper, Sherlock pulled to an end. “Unless... John has it with him.” The Detective glanced at her; never had he seen Mary so anxious.
“That’s the part of your job, not mine.” Sherlock replied with nonchalance, still shifting his gaze while his brother shot an annoyed glance at him.
Look at your left.”
When the two addicts mysteriously disappeared, as a part of their routine, in the darkness of the night, Sherlock and Wiggins managed to creep out of the flat and keep up to their tails undetected. Despite those multiple times when the two got lost in the way, they finally managed to get out with the help of the homeless network. Yes, a bunch of people spreading like a net across the streets of London, mingling in the public unnoticed, yet they are the ones who have been playing an important role from the very beginning of this investigation.
The two of them remained quiet for the rest of the time. He was annoyed, much more than the last time when he was standing and listening to the chattering of his brother.
“Molly said that he was found shot by the riverbank.”
' or 'Just leave me alone!' was not something he actually meant these days. It's just that he wanted to be on his own, like he had always loved to be. But, the presence of John himself was something he required on the process.
“You're saying that we're gonna leave everyone and everything behind and just vanish into thin air? Like what you did two years ago?” He asked with a hint of both confusion and surprise.
“I gotta go, Mary's not feeling well.” He said while hurrying up from his seat, “I'll see you tomorrow.”
At the precise moment the detective had placed the phone on the coffee table, the landlady popped her head through the slightly opened door. “There’s a client waiting for you downstairs.” Her thin pitched voice spoke.
“A few more minutes and I could've won...” John sighed and then let out a chuckle on his own. “Like the hare.” John's soft yet amused laughter left the detective frowning in a slight amount of confusion. “What?”
Sherlock exhaled softly while rolling his eyes, “Who else but the two of us?”
“He had a note in his pocket bearing the words,
“I don’t like repeating the same thing over and over but I am not just that typical journalist who is still just in search of the big scoop. I’ve got enough stuff to feed the newspaper with already.”
But again, Mary may not be as bad as he would probably think her to be; perhaps it’s him who’s being overreacting to things nowadays.
For two minutes, John went on lecturing himself on abandoning the bizarre thoughts and concentrate on the case.
“Ah yes, the great Sherlock Holmes wouldn't exist then!” He scoffed and leaned his back on the couch once again, crossing his arms. “And the fable you spoke of, what is it about?”
It was legit for him to think so; she had not been very generous when it came to sharing information on the stalker or the letter. Moreover, she claims that the letter is lost, which is not out of the probability to become a lie. Mary is capable of lying and is cunning enough to mask it without any struggle at all. He knew liars pretty well; sadly, the truth was, his best friend’s fiancée was one of them. But if it were a lie, and if everything here was really not the true case at all, then why would Mary come asking for his help?
John was ready for this and rose from his seat. He deposited the laptop on Sherlock and began to pace the room as he spoke, ensuring Sherlock was following the evidence provided to him.
It was a very long and busy morning for the boys of Baker Street. Not only did Sherlock have to adapt to John and his hidden sentiment, but they now had to arrange themselves around a small little bundle of tears. Because that's all she seemed to do, other than sleep, was to cry her frustrations out on the world. He watched as John struggled to come to terms with the new addition to their lives. Their lives? Surly it would be John's life? And not for the first time that morning, Sherlock's heart had frozen in terror.
Sherlock jumped and moved around John, “I'll get her, you make her midnight bottle,” and with that Sherlock vanished up the stairs, heading for the crying child. When he entered the room, he quickly scooped her into his arms and held her close against his chest, supporting her head against his shoulder as he bounced her gently. “You have the worst timing, little one..” Sherlock whispered and settled to sit on the bed, just as John entered with the night time feed. He passed the bottle to Sherlock without a word and sat beside him on the bed, so close their legs were touching.
John and Sherlock had been wheeled into the same, private hospital room. This was against hospital regulations, but with the hefty donation the hospital had just received, they were in no position to argue. Sherlock was not fully recovered, but he forced himself to lay awake until John had come around. The blonde man was still out cold on the bed beside him, and Sherlock couldn't help but take a note of the injuries John had sustained. A broken nose, fractured cheek bone and concussion, Sherlock noted with a grimace. His face was black, blue, purple and yellow in places. It appears to be swollen considerably, with few stitches around the left eye. 'Must have been drained of gathering fluid', Sherlock thought and grimaced once again.
“I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.” Moriarty pouted and pulled himself up slowly, his eyes stuck on Sherlock, but John could see the rage that burnt behind them. “You had appeared to become quite attached to that wailing thing over there, in what? A week!” Moriarty screeched the last part, making Rosie wail a little more, John inched closer, dying to hold her.
“At least tell me why I'm here?” John said after a while. “Is this pay back for breaking the Chief Inspector's nose? Is he watching right now.” John glared at the glass. “I'd happily provide a replay if you're asking for one.”
“But you've found something.” Sherlock answered, his eyes flickering over to Lestrade. “What is it?”
“Mycroft and John's lawyer are in the other room,” He answered and shrugged, “They've got John's release papers and Mycroft has informed of an impending investigation of the way this was dealt with this morning, and has ensured that I am back on the case.” With that Lestrade nodded and left the room.
Sherlock ignored John's pottering about in order to glare at his brother, "Stop spying on me!" He hissed, keeping his voice down. He knew that if the child was not in the living room in close view then she must be resting someplace else. John's room most likely, after all the man was her father, and he did have a new monitor clasped to his belt as he drifted between the two brothers.
John's head snapped back with such force behind Jim's fist. “That's enough!” He all but screeched. “I have something set aside for Sherlock in regards to that, and you're going to help me.” Jim's hand rested softly against John's cheek, bringing his face back towards Jim's very own.
“Just like father?” Sherlock asked, searching for Mycroft's answer before he said it. He needed that acknowledgement, somehow he was a young boy again, feeling the boot, the fist and then the belt of his father. Almost dying at those hands when Mycroft saved him. Such rage from his older brother, so much like Father's but Sherlock knew that rage would always be used to protect him, never to hurt him.
John took deep calming breaths and stood straight, “Let's go.” He didn't wait for a reply, instead he stormed from the interview room and down the hall, were he bumped into the Chief Inspector.
“It's all we've got. Mycroft dismissed it.”
John went silent, realising tears were falling as he was forced to remember those nights, those horrendous nights that haunt his dreams. He lost his only friends that week, and he lost someone he cared about greatly and he cried for them. The kick to his chest was not what he was expecting and again he curled in on himself, coughing up a lung.
Just as he went to sip his tea, the door bell went. John stiffened. It was so early in the morning, he wouldn't think a client would come at this time, especially with the brutal cold wind howling. But then again, cases never wait for anyone really. john had placed his cup against the small table by his chair, just as Sherlock exited his bedroom, hair in all directions and rubbing sleep from his eyes, "tell them to piss off!" Sherlock had called after John when he went to get the door before Mrs Hudson woke.
please, enjoy and I will try to get another chapter up over the next few days, but R/L is so busy right now <3 x
“You attacked a fellow recovering soldier during your stay in a rehabilitation unit. Such rage in you Doctor Watson, is it possible that that rage was directed towards Miss Morstan for abandoning your daughter?” Donovan smirked. “You killed her didn't you! You left the flat and hunted her down in the dead of night and killed her!” Donovan slammed a fist against the desk, John didn't flinch. He just clung to the words, Mary was murdered and they're pinning it on him. Mary was dead. Mary .. Mary was dead.
“How?” came the voice and again, John answered without wanting to. He has lost all control of his voice.
"No!" John glared from the entry way into the kitchen, his arms crossed. "No experimenting on my daughter."
After what had seemed like an age, Sherlock spewed his deductions and they were finally on their way home. John couldn't keep still and he was worse the closer they got. As soon as 221B was in view, John exited the cab and went straight for Mrs Hudson's flat. Finally, with Rosie in his arms he could relax a little and he made his way after Sherlock.
“This is all your fault!” John hissed, ignoring the pounding of rushed steps behind him and Greg's call for calm. “If you had only just used your pissing brain then I would have been at home in bed, while my little girl slept in the cot beside me. I would have been there to protect her. But no!” John twisted the wrist again, “Because of you and your stupidity, some psychopath has my daughter and may have possibly injured my landlady, who I am rather fond of I'll have you know!” John was pulled away before he could do more damage by Greg, whoo had shoved him into Sherlock's arms.
At some point into the early evening, John had gripped his arm tightly, grounding him and bringing back from a major explosion with Anderson. The sky was darkening and John was getting fidgety. It was no wonder, what with the message and his daughter at home. So Sherlock gave his deductions at lightening speed and whisked John away in a taxi.
“John..” Sherlock had managed to calm Rosie a little and was moving to calm John. He stopped when Sally raised the gun towards them. Big mistake.
He couldn't lose him, not again. Not after all that time they had spent apart. He had died for that man, and he can't lose him now. But what if he did? What if John realised Sherlock is not the kind of man he wanted around his daughter? What if John moved out because it wasn't safe? What if..? What if..?
They didn't say anything after a while, not until Sherlock's phone buzzed;
“What of it?” Mike replied. John felt rough hands against his back, cleaning and covering with gauze, but no stitching.
He watched Sherlock as he retold the story of Vicky, he watched Sherlock as he leaned in that little bit close. He watched as he whispered gently, looking out for all the signs Sherlock had told him to look out in the past. He saw Sherlock swallow hard, he saw his pupils dilate a little, and he saw the little vain in Sherlock's neck pulse. Then Rosie cried, and he stepped back.
"Or. It could be twins."
“I have my own reasons John, none of which concern you. Well, actually, maybe they do.” Mike pressed a little too hard against one of the cuts on John's back, and he hissed through the pain, his body stiffening up once more. “Back in university I made a promise to a very close friend of mine, that no matter what happens, I will always be there for him and his family. They got me into Med school when my parents died and they gave me meaning to keep going. I owe him and his sister everything John and that's why I am here. I am fulfilling a promise I made years ago, I know it may be morally wrong but I have no choice,” Mike backed up once he had finished and wiped his hands on a cloth that was provided to him. “It's this or they take my family," Mike whispered before he left the room, leaving John a shivering mess.
But there was no other word. Plus, John had said this was about him. The murders and the kidnapping, and Jim was just a pawn in the whole scheme of things. But why? Why John?
"I told you Sherlock." Lestrade was saying. "You needed to see this one."
Alright? Of course he was not alright? Wait. John was holding Rosie a second ago, where is she? His eyes flickered around the living room, it was a mess of boxes and rubbish and Mycroft and ... Wait, Mycroft!?
That was when John noticed it. A camera, recording live just behind that Westwood wearing psychopath. John's eyes widened and he struggled against his bounds, there was no way he would be used against Sherlock, not again. He couldn't. But it was useless. Whatever they were planning, it appeared that the game had changed.
This one got away with me I think ... Hope you enjoyed it
"I'm sorry Sherlock." John sighed, and pulled away gently, staring back at Sherlock. "I was not really expecting this."
He had ordered everyone from his room once John had left, even Mycroft when he returned with Rosie. He did advise that she was fine, no more sedatives remained in her system and she was resting peacefully, ass all new born children tend to do.
(See the end of the chapter for
“At eight weeks early, she's doing well. I'll get the bloods assessed and get back to you as soon as possible, but by the looks of things, she'll be sleeping for a while yet. The temperature is not too much but I'll get a nurse to give her something for it anyway. I'll make sure she's monitored and have Mycroft or Anthea assess each nurse and doctor before they enter this room.” With that Doctor Harrison left and John relaxed a little.
“Every identical twin has slight differences, not easy to spot. But then again, I'm a doctor. Plus I've been staring at these two for months! I know the differences.”
"What are you doing here!?" Sherlock hissed, ignoring John for the time being. How long was he in his mind palace for this time?
“Another threat Doctor Watson?” Donovan answered. “You are currently in no position to make threats.”
“Such as Jim's eyes are slightly closer together, Richard has thinning hair, smaller lips, Jim is a little taller, more muscular. Richard's skinny..”
Then the door opened, something wheeled in just behind the measured steps of someone he was sure he had seen before, but not while he was captured here. “Oh Johnny boy, oh Johnny boy.” came an Irish lilt and John stiffened, his head raising ever so slowly as he met Jim's gaze, and suddenly a murderous calm settled over John. He was sure he would die here, but at least he could take Jim with him.
"John!" Sherlock startled John from his ramblings. "I was without you for six months, I'm not about to abandon you now, just because things have changed a little."
Thank you for sticking with this, let me know if you like it so far, will try and update as much and as quickly as I can going forwards x
Sherlock blinked and swallowed. No one moved. It felt like an age, and yet only ten seconds had passed. Then Rosie cried.
“Get him home! I'll follow.” Greg had yelled as John was yet again dragged away, Sherlock holding him back but keeping him steady as they went.
“We need to ask you a few questions Doctor Watson.” John noticed the formality, and also noticed she still didn't lower her weapon. He slowly moved to place the gun on his bedside table, and raised his hands in surrender.
John wasn't quite sure when he became so comfortable with being so close to Sherlock, or even when he became aware of his own feelings for Sherlock. Maybe it was after loosing him, and then getting him back that made him realise, or maybe it was having a daughter, but whatever it was, he was sure of one thing. He felt something for Sherlock Holmes, something more than friendship. Something more than brotherhood. But he could not define it. It was more than love, more than a crush, it was just something more.
That was when Sargent Donovan came bursting into John's room, gun also raised. She was damn lucky John was a steady man with the gun, otherwise she'd have been shot in the pissing head. Still, John did not lower the weapon. Instead he glared his best captain glare, hearing his daughter's cries was breaking his heart. He spoke before Sherlock could even open his mouth.
“What do you want?” He heard Sherlock ask. He hadn't even noticed the man enter the flat. And by Moriarty and Moran's reactions, neither did they.
That was when Lestrade walked in with Molly behind him, looking as nervous as she always did. Sherlock kept his gaze on Rosie, making sure he catalogued everything so he would know when she breathed out of turn.
John shrugged and shook his head. "You turned up and I just ... Forgot about it. Until today."
Sherlock went to John, ignoring Donovan's comments, he glared at Smith, daring him to say something, and turned back towards his friend. “John,” he called gently, his hands moved to hold John's face gently. He wasn't sure when Lestrade came by his side, but he was thankful for him, as he had released John's cuffs and stepped back. “John, look at me, it's Sherlock.” Sherlock's voice was so soft, so gentle as he brought John's face up so he can stare into the man's eyes. “You're safe John. Both you and Rosie. You're safe, I promise.” Sherlock kept talking softly, enticing John from his mind. He couldn't help but smile softly as John blink and shuddered.
“Ah yes, the mysterious little girl. Mary her mother? It must have made you so angry that she would just abandon your child like that?” Donovan looked up at John and he flinched. But still he kept quiet. The Sherlock in his head telling him to say nothing more, there was something not right about this whole thing. He had no legal representative, he was uncomfortable and in pain. He had always thought Donovan was a bitch, but he had always admired her passion for the job she did. Although, his ideas about her were quickly changing.
As an approval to his primary deductions there
The next few minutes of the speech went the usual way of showing gratitude to the guests for their attendance and then the man describing a Turkish jewelry box made out of gold and ivory that were robbed during one of their auctions. The guests continued to listen to the owner of Roseberys Fine Art Auctioneers with profound attention while Sherlock and John exchanged a few glances. After all, the duo succeeded to get to the robbers and rescue the artifact when the police were almost lost in the maze.
“She's great,” John let out a small, polite smile at the old lady. “Mrs. Hudson, could you make me some tea, please?”
He began to smile out of nowhere while thinking of the evening he had spent with the detective. Moreover, about that particular piece of music he played at the last moment.
“Perhaps John’s been thinking about something else.” The pathologist replied with a typical shrug and the usual smile.
Soon as he saw Mary disappearing round the corner of the street, he closed the curtains and landed on his bed once again. Not to sleep; to think.
“No, not  yet, I didn’t spot anyone loitering around, nor matching your details. I’ll let you know if I find something.”
Sherlock stared at the frame, a corner of his lips crooking ever so small to form a smile although it did not succeed quite neatly. A sigh, barely audible, escaped as he placed it back on the end table and turned around to have a look at the rooms in front of his eyes, everywhere but nowhere, it would be pointless and a wastage of time if searched once again. The detective found himself a seat on one of the dining chairs, elbows resting upon the hard surface of the table whilst the right thumb and index finger fidgeted, touching his thin lips now and then.
“What?”
“Hmm.”
Just the usual scene- the tall man in black coat bending over a pale dead body while checking every single detail with the help of his magnifying glass.
“Oh, he would love to.” Mycroft replied with a beaming face.
His tall, slim figure quivered from the chilling cold of December. He remembered a night when he and John decided to go through a competition to see who can stay awake for most of the part. No doubt that it was he who won, for John fell asleep on the verge of winning.
He did not even bother to put on his blue evening robe even in the cold weather before comforting himself in the couch. Beside him stood the fireplace in which the dimly lit fire crackled on its own, dimly illuminating Sherlock's blank face.
And just between the differences of a few months, now he is sitting on the same couch, at the same time: two thirty at night, same room. In front of him stood that very armchair where his companion used to sit; but the only thing missing was- John himself.
Sherlock did not utter a single word on the whole way, just listening to him talking about a thing or two- mostly about what happened in 221B during his absence. Surely John knew that his companion was not very interested in hearing but again, he did not have much to talk about but he was really eager to talk to Sherlock today.
“To be frank, John, you sound quite possessive.” A chuckle could be heard from the other side of the phone. Sherlock truly was trying to be amusing.
“Did you notice how Dr. Watson was looking at the freak today?” Donovan asked in a casual manner.
The music which Sherlock played at the party is “Valse Sentimentale” by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky
“Who does not like them? People tend to devour-” She replied with a sly smile.
Replying with a smirk, Kitty Riley took the detective’s hand as he led her in the center of the hall and began to dance in no time.
Furrowing, Sherlock turned on his back to face her. “What do you mean? You’re supposed to keep it somewhere safe…”
“Where did you find this?” He asked in a low tone, not averting his stare from the neatly typed words.
But to his utter shock, the detective himself had managed to reach their hideout near the station at night.
“Sure, I was about to make some for myself anyway.” Sharing a nod and a brief smile with the man she headed for downstairs.
“But he deserves to know what’s going on and one way-”
“Riley.” Sherlock finished with the last name. “Seems like you’ve made your way up to a position since the last time I encountered you.”
“Oh?” The doctor frowned a little in confusion, “never heard of that one.”
“He’d look ridiculously hilarious, believe me.” John laughed.
The younger Holmes was sincerely hoping for someone to pop up once again and begin chitchat with his brother. Luckily, his wish had come true. A man came up to them and whispered something in Mycroft's ear, making him leave his brother and walk toward the other side.

The first place he went to was the same flat where they had visited early in the morning accompanied by Wiggins- both in disguise and it was already obvious that no one could detect the duo. After gathering ample information about everyone and particularly of the two addicts who were too damned to care about the newcomers, Sherlock decided to spend the rest of the time inside.
“John’s in his chamber now, I called him a while ago. He didn’t say anything about the letter, sounded rather normal.”
“Hmm…” Sherlock puckered his lips, looking at the floor as if he had something more interesting there.
“Out. You stay here.”
“He should’ve come, you know. Why didn’t you try convincing him? You’re the one who knows him well after all, wasn’t there any other way to distract him from the case just for a day?”
Miss Riley let out a small chuckle before concentrating on her meal once again. “The Guardian.” She eventually spoke again.
“No, don’t. Don’t do that; you are lying, Sherlock. There’s something going on, isn’t it? And you don’t want me to know that.”
“You haven’t told John, have you?”
What pined Sherlock the most was John sitting across him, smiling and talking with the other diners around him, not having the slightest idea of the man staring at him oh, very often. For most of the times, the two used to have seats beside each other when Sherlock used to ramble on with his assumptions and John used to play the good listener and sometimes asking questions in the middle, a boost to the thinking process at times.
John stood still with his arms crossed while shifting his eyes between the man and his friend. The descriptions seemed to be perfectly accurate, leaving the old chap startled and a little annoyed. Nevertheless, what was bigger- John started to feel a tinge of embarrassment due to all the remarks his friend had just made, after all, this old man was one wonderful and brave leader to the doctor.
Two, seeing John with his
The rest of the program went on without any inconvenience. A few more officials were to deliver short speeches including Mycroft, about not only the robbery of the particular artifact but also the present situation in London concerning both local and international crimes and the ways to deal with them all through cooperation and zero tolerance towards the outlaws.
“John Hamish Watson.” Sherlock muttered, throwing his blank gaze at the wall.
“But this is the last time I’m saying this. It does not hurt much to have someone related to the press by your side.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Mrs. Hudson, why don’t you go get some sleep?” Sherlock spoke in a normal tone.
“Dinner?” Sherlock asked in brief, eyeing the doctor.
“I don’t want things get ruined for me, and that’s why, I’ve come to ask you for help. You must help me to-”
“Oh no no no, it’s alright.” Sherlock said in a typical voice. “You guys go and have fun, Lestrade seems to keep a case on store, and it’s quite something. I’d rather stay here and go on with it.”
“Do you see the bushes behind those fields? There's a route behind which leads straight out of this place, towards the Highlands.”
The detective could not but sigh at the thought of John and Mary spending their weekend together in Richmond. It seemed as if he himself avoided the trip on purpose; but it was not like that, was it? Of course he had reasons… Many reasons.
The two of them were standing on a mound one bright morning, their eyes fixed on a rivulet a few yards away below them. Soft spring breeze blew through the leaves, creating a sweet, murmuring sound that added another level of tranquil in the atmosphere. Sherlock remained mute, standing in his usual smart pose with a face lacking expressions. Like many other times, this was just another moment of ease before going on a chase. A moment when Sherlock usually thinks and analyses the entire plot in front of his eyes while breathing in the atmosphere around him. But this morning seemed a little...different. He somehow felt that Sherlock was not into one of his thinking moments rather something he seems to be secretive about. But it was known to John that keeping silence was the best thing for these types of moments; even though his stomach was bulging with a load of questions by now. At last, the detective was the one to break the silence.
Sherlock put on a fake bright smile in reply and nodded.
“Is everything alright, dear? What are you doing here so early-” The old lady asked in confusion.
“And Mycroft? Won't he-”
“I’m not in the mood of dancing. How about you go talk with that man over there, he might-”
“Oh, and tell Sherlock I said hi.” With a smile, she walked into the kitchen. “Mrs. Hudson as well.”
“But Sherlock-”
It was all so quiet around him that he could even hear his own breathing, the air entering and exiting his lungs. A faint sound of the clock was flowing inside- the only thing that he could define as company. He wanted to turn to his left side but he did not want to disturb Mary either. She seemed to be in full ease, diving deep into the sea of slumber. Letting out a soft sigh, he shifted his eyes from his fiancée toward the ceiling. The dream was somewhat ridiculous, yet there was something he could not but think about.
“Kitty,” the woman let out a small smirk before sipping from her glass of water.
“And, Mary…?” Sherlock hesitated for a brief moment. “How’s John doing?”
One, certainly he did not want to ruin the case he had taken.
“Everything’s fine, John. Mary was talking about her plan of going on a trip, we three of us and kept insisting over and over again.” Replied Sherlock with something barely resembling a smile, on his lips accompanied with calm and influencing tone of speaking. “She even wanted to surprise you.” The smile became quite visible by now. “Am I not right, Mary?”
“So it’s you, the stalker.” Sherlock muttered, gawking on the Indian who was now walking across the street, probably returning for the time being.
“No, it’s not.”
Hearing the question, Molly stopped the last test she was running to detect more of the poison and looked up at the sergeant who was sent to receive the file after the test was done. “What do you mean?”
“I don’t want, to endanger his life, Sherlock!” Mary interrupted desperately.
A jolly laughter echoed back and forth the hall as he said the last words. While John managed a small grin to join the others, Sherlock looked around him maintaining a bright, fake smile.
John scoffed a little while looking away, trying to piece up all of what this man had just said. Disappear? Just the two of them, from England?
At the precise moment of spotting the two, the mild sarcasm that was gracing his face earlier disappeared and his face turned blank once again. Wait; was it really the same emotionless face of his? No. He was trying not to let the sudden attack of sadness or disappointment take over his face. He stood still, staring at the couple. They seem happy, very happy although their dancing was comparatively slow than the other couples but still, they are enjoying. His eyes kept looking at his old flat mate, wishing if there was a way to spend some time with him.
The Hat Man gets away.
“....Hmm....” The taller one remained mute for the rest of the path, his eyebrows slightly furrowed. The subject of Mary was something he did not really expect to hear, not at this moment.
At the precise moment, the front door crackled and slowly was opened from the outside, it was John. The very sight of him made both the detective and his fiancée stop in an instance.
Surely one may ask, “And how do you remain alone while another person is present in your flat already?”
John was lying in his bed, fast asleep. On the end table lay a gun, fully loaded, a knife on his right side where his fiancée would lay. She had taken every step as a part of the precaution in order to keep him safe, for her husband he had not the slightest idea about what was going on.
Here’s the link, in case you guys want to hear it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUuusqy50yk
Playing the violin at 3am in the night was something he found utterly annoying in the first place. Nowadays, his mind longs for the music often in the long, sleepless nights. Just like this night. They were never a source of headache for John, never an annoyance. It helped his best friend to think, and him, to close his eyes and listen while pretending to be asleep. However, he would soon doze off within a short span of time for most of the part, but he did not mind. They were his lullabies that helped him to fall asleep... However, not tonight.
“He isn’t coming.” John mumbled, still holding the phone in his ear.
Sherlock could not think of a proper answer than thanking her politely in return while beholding her face.
At the precise moment when John placed his empty cup on the table, his phone jingled- a text.
“Alright, alright.” The woman nodded to herself as she turned towards the open door. “Call me if necessary…”
“Where’s the letter now?” Sherlock asked, scrutinizing the woman.
“It’s Sherlock we’re dealing with here.”
The sun had set almost three hours ago, and John has been sitting all the time in his armchair, his eyes fixed on the screen of his laptop. Mary paid a visit a while ago- surely a relief from the endless boredom, but also a little annoying because of the continuous chit chat of Mrs. Hudson. He had finished two cups of tea already and was about to pour himself another and right then, his phone rang. It was Lestrade who too, was unaware of Sherlock's whereabouts and complained that he isn't receiving any response from him after a call drop. John ended the conversation with a knot on his eyebrows.
“Oh he’s fine.” She smiled. “We’re about to go to the golf course now, I’ll talk later.”
“Oh come on now, Sherlock. Just one day, spare it!” Mary patted his shoulder as Sherlock replied with a quick ‘fake’ smile.
“Mr. Holmes,” the woman moved in front of him, “don’t think that I’m just the same as I was. As you can see, I have worked a lot these two years. I suggest you to stop underestimating me.”
“You're not gonna believe this. Things have turned out to be far deeper than expected.”
“John’s alright. He’s asleep.” Saying so, Mary looked at the old lady with the corner of her eye.
John kept wondering if he ever crossed Sherlock’s mind even for once in the days that have gone by. In addition, the ultimate question- Will he ever be able to listen to Sherlock play the violin in the middle of the night again?
Sherlock threw the phone beside him as he lay in his bed. It was near about nine in the morning and Missus Hudson will be arriving just after a few minutes with his tea, a morning ritual somewhat.
“Oh dear Lord...” John whispered to himself and nodded. “Well, it's about a hare and a tortoise who decide to run a race. Whoever would reach the finish line first…”
The misty veil that covered the quiet streets of London was yet to lift when John slowly opened his eyes. It took a few moments for the doctor to realize that the slender hand resting on his chest was not of someone whom he dared to imagine about, following the short yet detailed dream he had just woken up from.
Sherlock's fingers swiftly traveled across the keyboard while his eyes scrutinized the screen. An underground organization is something Holmes was always keen to know more about but somehow they always managed to leave a hint of mystery that kept the detective thinking and thinking. The murderer was certainly, a mere worker- as the detective had already assumed before going through his mails and texts. John had finally managed to put full concentration into the work. They were very close to unveil this mysterious organization they've been in search of for quite a long time. All on a sudden, Sherlock grabbed his coat and whirled it around him without uttering a word.
“No, I don’t want him stepping into this nuisance.” She looked at the man sitting across her. “Will you help me, Sherlock, please?”
“Yeah, well, now that you’ve already said it out aloud.” Mary grinned softly at John. “How about a visit to Richmond Park? Hills, woodlands, trees – a perfect place for sightseeing.”
“Forget everyone, forget everything. Just the two of us, John. That's what they do right? They forget everything around them except themselves.” His tall figure leaned forward, closer to the doctor's ears and whispered. “When everything turns against them and a break is essential.”
All the guests agreed that the Orchestra did a wonderful performance, except Sherlock. He did not miss to notice the smallest mistakes made by the man who was playing the flute, not even of the woman who missed a minor part with her cello during the second verse, even though it was not traceable at all because her fellow musicians backed her up. That was one of his qualities besides being a man of logic- classical music enthusiast with fair amount knowledge on different musicians and their works, which are, even after so many decades, admired and praised by a good number of critics and listeners.
was something… something he… Oh well, better leave that to be on its own.
“Well, for now it’s just the two of us.” Doctor Watson smiled, cuddling Mary. “Let’s just enjoy the time here.”
“Enough, Mr. Holmes, thank you very much.” The man cut off in the middle in a straight voice. “Seems like, Captain Watson was not wrong at all.” After letting out a forced polite smile, the officer walked across the hall, leaving the two standing in front of a pedestal.
“He’s probably asleep now. But what’s the matter? Is John alright?”
“The Crime-Solving Junkie.” She remarked, bringing up another smile of amusement out of John as she got ahold of the steering wheel and soon, drove themselves away to their destination.
The Detective stared along, carefully listening to his best friend’s fiancée. He opened his mouth to ay something but once again got interrupted.
"You promise?" John replied, his voice soft but shaking. His hands were shaking. His whole body trembling as he looked desperately at Sherlock.
“John?” He asked, just as Mycroft was moving towards him.
John was receiving a number of stares as he was led to the interview rooms, not straight to a cell as he had thought. He straightened and glared at anyone he could. The look on his face was enough to make them scatter quite quickly. This was going to be a long arsed night, and they still haven't told them why he was arrested in the bleeding first place. John silently hoped Sherlock was alright and his daughter. Just as he said a prayer for their safety, he was shoved into a dull looking interview room, a floor to ceiling on way mirror at the end, and shoved into a chair, he winced his his shoulder pulled again.
Sherlock didn't speak. His eyes flickered across the screen in front of him. His hands shifting over the mouse, pulling up different bits of information at a time. "Did you show this to Mycroft?" He finally answered.
They had been together for five months, met in a local pub one night when John was drowning his sorrows. They got chatting and one thing led to another and John had spent the night with her, in her bed. This was the case most nights for five months, the Sherlock returned from the dead and whisked John away into the night. He had still been seeing Mary for a couple more months before had given him an ultimatum. So he chose, and that was just over a month ago.
“Sherlock,” Lestrade started and made his way over. A hand ran through his silver hair and he heaved a sigh. “We've got nothing. Even with Mycroft's resources, we can't find him.”
“Have you found her?” He hissed, not taking his eyes from his brother.
It was some while later when John awoke. Another hour or two had passed while he was out cold in the chair. His many aches and pains where making themselves very clear right now and he couldn't help a groan and a soft sob that escaped him. His body shivered and his mind felt sluggish. One good thing about the truth serum was that it dulled the pain. If only he could have some of that now. He needed it. He was desperate, he may do just about anythi … 'No!' the logic in his mind supplied. 'Stop it, you're fine. You'll be fine.'
I noticed a bit of discrepancy so I tried to fix it here.
"I only came to offer my congratulations." Mycroft smirked softly, the fat git must know what turmoil Sherlock's mind palace is in right now. "And also offer up some of my contacts for support. After all, not everyone in London can owe you a favor Sherlock. Getting a pram and a cot is easy enough. But clothes and toys, not so much. But not to worry, Anthea has plenty going spare."
“You told me something once.” John mused, staring at Sherlock.
When they finally reached the hospital, Sherlock's heart had only stopped the once. But they had it beating again, to the utter relief of John. Sherlock was in surgery as Mrs Hudson was wheeled in, followed by Mycroft and Anthea. John heading straight towards the pair, noticing Anthea was not attached to her phone, but instead linking an arm protectively around Mycroft's arm, walking at his side and close enough to comfort. Maybe the politician did have a heart after all.
John couldn't stop herself. “Major Charlotte Green, Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers. Second in command of my unit. Died in action.” John muttered, his eyes owed.
"That is my vow and always will be. I will always be here for the two of you. I will protect you always and I will die before anyone hurts her." Sherlock replied and pulled John into a hug once more. He was being overly sentimental today, but he could see John needed it.
“Seb. Do as he says, we're done here. I have what I need.” Jim hissed in pain. Sebastian lowered Rosie on the couch, inched away from John and went straight to Jim. John followed them, gun poised and ready to fire as the two mad men escaped from the flat. John was unsure how long he stood there for, but Rosie's wailing brought him back to himself. He reached for her and held her close as he went to Sherlock's still form, blood seeping from the gun shot wound to his chest.
It was not long till John woke with a groan. “Rosie?” He murmured, sitting up right with a jolt and a cry. “Rosie!” He yelled.
"Rosie. It suits her perfectly." Sherlock gave John a little squeeze and then moved away, swooping down to grab his phone, his fingers flying across the keys. "We will need clothing, bottles, formula. We'll need baby proofing and the like. I'm sure I have a few favors to call in."
Thank you to all reading this, and I apologies for taking so long to update. Real life is a bitch sometimes.
“We were on a mission to seek and destroy a Taliban nest. People who would traffic British children, strap them to Semtex and force them into bitch compounds and detonate. We had excellent Intel on one of those nests and our mission was to destroy the lot. It didn't go well, we had a leak in command and our position was compromised. I ordered to evacuate but it was too late. We were captured and tortured over a week. There was ten of us, and only three of us survived the week. We were released into the desert and shot. Two bled out into the sand before the evac team found us. I survived. Charlotte had not survived the torture.”
“Hello Johnny Boy,” Moriarty cooed, sitting in Sherlock's chair no less. Moran was by the window, rocking a twisty Rosie. He was holding her gently, watching her closely. John's instinct was to go straight to her. “Ah, ah, ah.” Moriarty tutted, making John stop but not taking his eyes away from his daughter. “I think Seb here has become quite attached.
“Yeah,” John whispered, “You said, 'There's always something'. The first day we met.” And John grinned. He sly, only-for-Sherlock grin.
“Well, just John's army records really. They were pretty much blank but from what John has told me before, I was able to fill in the blanks and we may have some leads to follow. I wanted to run it by you first. I feel like I'm grasping at straws here.” Lestrade sighed and took a seat by Sherlock. “John has told me once or twice that he and a unit under his command would run special ops, top secrete and all that jazz. Finding and securing criminals of war, drug and weapons trade, child trafficking, you name it, him and his team would take it down. One mission went wrong. Him and his team were captured and killed, leaving him the only survivor. The mission report is blank, just that it went wrong, the team was assumed killed in action and then a few days later John radioed in for evacuation and he was found shot in the desert with two others, the rest of team was found burned in an abandoned village.”
John smirked a little and stared. He had his findings on the laptop in front of him, ready to argue his case. If anyone can pick it apart, it would be Sherlock. But then again, this was solid evidence.
“Yes.” Was all Mycroft said, and shifted a little. Mrs Hudson had clung to Sherlock's other hand and squeezed gently. “On the other hand, Doctor Watson's blood results have returned. It's a strange mixture of things, and doctors are working endlessly to counter act the effects. It appears that someone has stolen the idea for a new truth drug, and mixed it with a very strong sedative. So when he does come around, he may still be under the influence, and he will be in withdrawal stages. This new drug has additive elements.”
Then they were home and they both rushed out of the cab and straight into Mrs Hudson's home, not really assessing the situation. John didn't hold back, he ran straight in and looked in every room he could, not finding Rosie his panic began to rise. Finally, in the living room was Sherlock, leaning over an unconscious Mrs Hudson, his hand holding her wrist, checking her pulse.
Over the next hour or so, John watched as people came and went, attaching wires to his daughter and watching the machines, John knew each wire did something to help his daughter but was still rather unnerving to see. He wondered how Mary had felt when she was born, she should have been attached to some machinery to help in the first few days of her life. Maybe Mary knew what her fate had been so that was why she had abandoned Rosie. It made more sense that the daft excuse she had left in the note.
“No, it's a promise.” John replied in his 'captains' voice. “And I will be making a formal complaint about this, mark my words. Where's Lestrade?”
"Twins? It's never twins."
John turned slowly, his face blank, “Sherlock?” He shifted but he couldn't quite move, his body will not co-operate and a shiver brought him back down to lie against the pillows. “Someone's taken our daughter Sherlock and I bet you my soul that Moriarty was involved in some way the bastard.” John muttered. “I will kill him with my bare hands if I have to, but I will kill him. I will kill them all. I will burn them ..”
John was a mess most of the evening. His nerves were on edge at the crime scene, seeing the body like that, the message. His face had paled he rang Mrs Hudson straight away. Rosie was fine, of course she was. But still, needed to be sure. He saw Sherlock watching him so he nodded, ended the call with Mrs Hudson and texted Mycroft to get someone at the flat ASAP.
John was left to crumble on the floor after the whip had struck his back no less than ten times. His screams had whittled down to small grunts after the third strike, not wanting to give this man any sick pleasure. He felt the blood sticking and drying to his back as his body lay against the cold floor, shivering and trembling. He saw the feet come back into view and heard the rasping of breath, but John refused to look into the man's eyes. He will not give him the pleasure of seeing him in such pain, because it fucking hurt!
Neither of of them spoke as they headed back to 221B Baker Streets, Sherlock slipping completely into his mind palace once they were home. He played that day on the roof of Barts over and over again. Watching from different angles, analysing every corner, every word, every little blink. But there was nothing. Sherlock could not understand it. Moriarty had committed suicide that day. He put a gun in his mouth and ate a bullet. There was no coming away from that.
I should've mentioned that in this chapter is talk of bullying and suicide attempts.
The first wooden spike entered the space between John's nail and the skin, the hammer taking it right down to the nail bed. John screamed in pain. It was complete agony and just as he was getting used to the throbbing pain, a wooden stick was hammered home in the next nail. John struggled for all he was worth, his throat sore with yelling. He has gone from screaming to swearing to spouting threats and curse words. Anything he could think of. He has never had this before, but he had seen it done to other's, it fucking hurt more than the whips. He would prefer that. Fuck, he would prefer being shot again.
The trip back to Baker Street took too long in John's opinion. Sherlock was click clacking away on his phone, his posture and face remained calm, but John could see a slight tremble in his hands as he texted. There was no report from Mycroft as of yet, which annoyed John to no end, but he breathed deeply, trying to calm himself down. John focused on Sherlock, his trembling hands and his bouncing knee. It was a reflex really, he reached out and rested a gentle hand onto Sherlock's knee and gave it a gentle squeeze, but said nothing.
"Now Sherlock." Mycroft droned. "You of all people should know that getting a child into 221B would not escape my notice."
There was silence for a moment before John broke it once again, "What the fuck do I do Sherlock?!"
“Yes, I was at home feeding my child that had just turned up on the doorstep. Which can be verified by my flat mate and landlady. Now, what's all this about?” John replied, shifting and trying to take the pressure off of his shoulder.
He didn't hear anything in the room, he was lost in his own head. The images of Mary, and of his unit drifting into his mind, taking control of the situation. He didn't even realise he had begun to hyperventilate as the worst panic attack he has ever had since Sherlock took a nose dive off Saint Bart's roof took complete control.
He lunged forwards, shocking the man in front of him and let his fists fly. If he could knock the guy out then ring the alarm before he passed out then Rosie would be safe. His hits were a little of and sloppy as the drug was taking effect, but he connected. The man appeared to have recovered from his shock and swung at John, landing a hard punch to his face, John felt his nose break. He went down, and he struggled. He grabbed at the man's legs and pulled, the man kicked back, hitting John on the side of his face. His head snapped back, his cheek burned and blackness surrounded him.
John laughed. “No. I was actually going to say that these two are a rare set of twins, in that Richard has brown eyes, Jim has blue.”
it could have been 10 minuets, or ten seconds, John wasn't so sure any more when he heard further footsteps and scraping sounds against the floor. The chains were pulled and John yelled as he was once again forced to stand, his toes scraping against the concrete floor. The bed was removed and John was lowered to a chair, the chains removed from his wrists and he was tied to the arms of the chair. It appeared to be a funny sort of contraption. At the end of the chair arms were plates carved into hands. John noticed that they were perfect to fit his hands against them with his fingers outstretched. Which is what the people around him had forced him to do, each finger was then held against the contraption with its own metal clamp. John couldn't move either fingers now that he was clamped down for a better term.
Mycroft nodded, and Anthea disconnected an arm from him but stayed close as she got her mobile and her fingers flew across the keys. “Follow me Doctor Watson.” She looked up, warmth in her eyes for a second, then turned to Mycroft, squeezed his arm gently and led John down the corridor, to a private room. “Doctor Harrison will be by shortly, he's Lisa's doctor. I would trust him with my life. And hers.”
"Copy cat killer," Sherlock finally muttered. "Has to be."
“Don't” John's voice stilled the pair of them. “They're doing a trade. This is about me, the killings, the kidnapping, everything. Moriarty was just a pawn, he has his own score to settle with you Sherlock so you'd better be bloody careful. Once he's dealt with then you come and find me OK, not before. Someone will have to ensure Rosie is safe and protected and unharmed. No arguing. If this is not done they will kill her.”
“Anthea has given me the history yes.” He stopped in his approach and waiting for confirmation from John. “I'm Doctor Harrison.” He held out a hand, again he waited, letting John make the move, allowing him some form of control over the situation.. John felt 8immediate respect for the man in front of him. John stepped forward and shook the offered hand and stood slightly to the side, but still close enough to the cot so that he ensured his daughter always remained in his line of sight. He was beginning to wish he had brought his gun with him, just for the comfort.
Again Sherlock shifted, ignoring the pain, “Mrs Hudson..” He managed through gritted teeth.
“Mary Morstan was found dead in her flat, and an anonymous tip that placed John at the scene, just after 2am Tuesday.” Greg finished, pulling open the door and let Sherlock stalk on ahead. “The Chief Inspector allowed the warrant and wanted John questioned immediately. He's with Donovan and Smith now, has he got a lawyer?”
“Threatening an officer Doctor Watson?” Sally replied, voice shaking but she lowered her gun anyway.
"Well actually, this could be twins. I wasn't completely bone idle while you were gone you know. Mary said I was obsessed. Maybe I was but I rufused to believe you would just jump because you were a fake. Bollocks to that." John sighed and pointed to the laptop. "I made Mycroft give me everything he had on Moriarty and I mean everything. I even took Kitty Riley's article and picked it apart. I hadn't lived with you for years without picking up on a few things. Plus I'm a doctor. And looking back when we met Richard, it's so blaringly obvious they're identical twins. You'll see the school photo posted on the social media page. There's a school reunion. Maybe we should hit it up."
“It appears she may have had a mild sedative, but to know for sure I need to get the samples assessed. But other than that, she's perfectly healthy. Am I right in assuming she's a premature baby?” He asked as he stepped away to allow John to stand back at her side.
“No...” John whispered shaking his head. He slumped and his body began shaking and he shook his head, “no...”
"No, and that's final." He accepted the mug from Sherlock just as Rosie stirred softly from her nap. John went to put his mug back down, but Sherlock was faster. He headed straight up the stairs, just as he had heard Lestrade come in through the front door.
Just then the door down stairs went and feet thundered against the stairs. “Sherlock's been shot!” John said in greeting as Mycroft burst through the door.
The results from Rosie's bloods did show a very mild sedative, only strong enough to make John dizzy if he had been given it, but enough to get a child sleeping. The temperature was the side effect, and nothing life threatening was found. John could relax. He made sure that the people coming and going kept him up to date with Sherlock and Mrs Hudson. He hated leaving them on his own, but he dare not leave his daughter, not now, not ever.
He ignored Sherlock and went running up the stairs and slammed into 221B Baker street, only to be welcomed by two mad men and the cowering agents.
“Yeah. Right, sorry.” John scratched his chin and breathed deeply, catching his breath. “Anyway, this fan had said she knew you were for real. Not because she met you or because of the blog, but because she knew the Moriarty twins. That's what she said. So obviously I took the bate and we'd been emailing back and forth. She told me they were inseparable, sometimes even traded places just to fool the teachers. Richard was bullied a lot because of his autism, which caused him to develop anxiety. Vicky had said that the only escape for Richard was acting classes. He was a sweet kid she said, but tried to commit suicide a couple of times.” Sherlock stared at the photo of Richard Brooke, now knowing to be Richard Moriarty.
"You had escaped into you head for well over five hours Sherlock, just after sending out a million text. I don't know what you did but there were deliveries and handy men and even some homeless kids all rushing about, setting up a cot, playpen, I think there's a pram down stairs. Mrs Hudson was beside herself. I showed her the note and explained the situation. I think she's happy. Then your brother turned up, clothes toys and nappies, bottles and formula. Even had a home visit from a doctor. She's doing well for being early." John was rambling. why was he rambling? He only did that when he was overly nervous, or scared.
John was unaware of how much time had passed when he came to. His arms were chained above his head, the chain looping over a link in the ceiling and down the wall. He couldn't really take in much of the place, it was damp, cold and dungeon like. He must be in a cellar of some kind. His knees were beginning to ache but he felt too weak to stand. His head was spinning, his stomach was churning and he was sure he will end up spilling his breakfast all over himself. He tried taking deep breaths which did not help at all, he groaned instead, trying to take in everything but gave up when his head began to protest.
With that done, he had eased a little, but not a lot. He was still on edge, biting his tongue a lot harder than normal. He still couldn't understand how the bloody police thought this was a dump and run. This was staged obviously, even John saw that. Even a monkey would be able to see that the building being assigned for demolition was nothing but a coincidence.
“Not here. He's off this case now. He's too close.” Sally moved towards John and put a hand on his arm, “You'll have to come to the station to answer a few questions.”
It felt like an age before someone finally entered the room. He appeared to be on the shorter side with greying hair and the kindest eyes. He was on the chubbier side but he held himself well, and the smile he held as he saw John was enough to relax him, but only very slightly.
"Yes. Yes, her niece. It's not that we need hand-me-downs Mycroft. We can mange." Sherlock growled.
The unknown man carefully disconnected the wires from the sleeping child and picked her up, grinning as he took his prize and fled the hospital. No one stopped him, no one noticed him and John was not found for another hour, when the nurse had came back to check on Rosie's stats.
"Of course." Mycroft knew defeat. "If you both need anything, anything at all. Do not hesitate to ask."
Sherlock pocketed his phone and chewed on his nail. He never chewed his nails, but he didn't have any cigarettes near by at the moment. What exactly was going on? This had to have Moriarty written all over it. It just had to be.
“Yes. It was Colonel Sebastian Moran. He was running a drug, weapon and child trade within the country, and the tip off with one of the nests was one of his own. He couldn't allow us to get so close because that would mean the end of him, or something like that anyway. I'm not so sure any more, but I remember him being there. He was the one who initiated the torture on my team, he was the one to have burnt the bodies before the surviving three, and he was the one to shoot us on the desert. His sniper skill unprecedented. No one could match him and he knew it. Probably still knows it the smug bastard.”
“Well, not long after your .. Well, hiatus .. Yes, lets call it hiatus. Anyway, not long after that, about two weeks, maybe three. I received an email from a fan. Well she said she liked the stories, and she knew you weren't a fake. Kitty's article had sold like hot cakes by the way. Everyone breathed in that pile of rubbish. I sued for slander by the way. I won in case you were bothered. Mycroft had the best ...”
