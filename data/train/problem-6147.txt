“I don’t want to go anywhere without you now. If I’d have to leave you here again, I think I might go mad.”
"Later, doll," Steve said with a smirk. "Let's make it to Hydra first and have that meeting with my leader, then you can go down on my knot as much as you like."
“Well… I was looking for you after everyone returned from the mission… and when I found you on the floor when you just passed out, I… well, I saved you, Tony.” Howard put his hand gently on the arc reactor embedded in his son’s chest. “I had to save you…”
“Well, hello there.”
“I’m hoping for that option.” Maria smiled as she pulled Tony into the first store.
Tony kept reminding himself that the baby inside him belonged to Steve as he and his mother drove back home. It was honestly the only thought keeping him grounded and preventing him from flying off the handle and going into an anxiety induced panic. The calmer and happier he was, the better for both his own and his baby’s health, according to the doctors. He wanted to stay healthy, at least for the baby, and Maria was going to make sure he didn’t do or eat anything wasn’t healthy, he was sure of it. Still, he appreciated that she was going to take care of him. The whole pregnancy news came as quite a shock to him.
"I know how an omega wants to be treated," Steve replied. "Not many alphas can say that."
Tony gagged again and turned his face back to the toilet, shaking terribly and whining between heaving. When he was finally finished, he clung to the toilet like letting go would cause him to throw up again. Of course, he didn’t when Maria coaxed him away and cleaned up his face, but his stomach was still upset.
“I love you two so much,” Tony said. “But I have a chance at not being sick any more. There’s a chance Steve is still alive and is just waiting to be found, and I want to be there when he wakes up. Mate sickness goes both ways, after all. I don’t want him to suffer like I have for five long years.”
"The way I see it, he's an ex of Tony's for a reason," the blond alpha responded.
“Sure, man. Cups are in the upper cupboard to the right of the sink.”
“Tony, why are you filling me in about your love life?” Peggy asked, smiling. “I don’t need to know every detail of your relationship.”
“Well, we don’t have time for me to sit on your knot this morning. You’re not a quick-releaser.” Tony rolled over onto his back and looked up at Steve, taking in how he looked with his lower face covered in slick, “You have a bill to pay and I have some packing to do.”
“We should set up a checkup appointment first,” the doctor said. “Just to look over things and make sure the baby is healthy and on a good growing rate.”
Tony hadn't realized up until that point just how much bigger Steve was after having the serum injected into him. Steve wasn't the little guy that Tony met on that fateful day; he was undoubtedly a super soldier, a man that honestly fit in better as an alpha than the scrawny beta he had been before. Tony groaned as he continued to look over the alpha's body, noting the differences the serum had brought on. Hell, Tony even dared to glance down at Steve's groin, promptly whining again and bringing his hands up to grasp Steve's biceps. Good lord, he had no idea how this was going to work.
Christmas came and went with Steve being gone and Tony being left in London. The omega was having a ton of time to think over what had happened with Steve, and he had basically come to  the point of forgiving Steve. It took time, but he really didn’t want to lose Steve. They had been together for such a long time already, most couples in their position would already be married and have a kid on the way. But Steve and Tony were a special pair to say the least, and with Steve being Captain America still, Tony couldn’t really do much but sit back and wait for the blond to return, which was always stressful. Tony didn’t ever have a way of communicating with Steve, and Howard was absolutely against Tony ever going on missions with the blond, especially if they were taking down a Hydra base, which was what the mission was that took Steve away during Christmas.
Steve nodded, looking down on the floor again. “I’ll make this up to you.”
Maria shook her head. “No worries, I’m just glad you’re back. I was so worried about your health the whole time. More worried over if your cycles were going to stay normal or not. I know you usually have heats every two or three months.”
“Well you were staring off into space, to be fair,” the alpha said. “But you shouldn’t be lifting things. Steve said you cracked your rib again.”
“Can’t blame me!” Tony said, finally crawling out from behind the TV with his tools and putting things away, “The man’s too hot to not try to court! Plus he seems really sweet. I don't get sweet alphas that often. Mostly find the jerks. Or the jerks that pretend to be sweet. But I’m not worried of that since Rhodey already likes him enough to invite him over, and Rhodey always has a good sense about these things.”
Steve looked at the radio, feeling confused and uneasy. This wasn’t where he last remembered he was. The last thing he remembered was trying to send out a vibration to Tony through their rings. The alpha looked down at his hands. The ring was missing.
“You’ll love it, I get really funny when I’m drunk. Or stupid. I’ve been told I’m both, so it’s a 50/50 shot.”
As soon as they entered, Tony slammed a picture frame down on its face, hiding a picture of the two of them smiling and hugging. Tony loathed that picture as he sat down at his desk, crossing his arms and staring at the blond alpha as he sat opposite of him on the bed. “I’m not going to forgive you any time soon, I hope you know.”
“On top of my price you’ll have a charge on your bill for renting a room.” the omega added as he punched in a code to unlock a door.
“You’re the one who now has two friends who are attracted to each other.”
“I think they’ll be more than willing to join the fight again,” Steve countered. “They’ve been through hell but they’re still soldiers. They’d defend their home to their dying breath if they could.”
"So did Howard Stark. The two of them worked hard to get us where we are today. We owe a lot to them."
“I don’t care as long as there’s pepperoni.” Clint said.
Tony could practically feel Steve’s rock hard cock pressing to his entrance, their clothing the only barrier keeping them from going all the way. He could imagine just how wet he would--or no, maybe he wasn’t imagining that part, he realized as he felt his underwear go damp and cling to his ass. He shifted both hands back behind him, as if he was simply walking with his hands folded behind him the way many high-ranking military alphas tend to do when they meant business or wanted to seem imposing. Then he glanced around, and deciding no one was paying attention to him, he quickly plucked at his backside to loosen his underwear before they gave him a major wet wedgie as he tried to calm his cheeks so they wouldn’t get annoyingly red. The last thing he needed was for anyone to know the state he’d worked himself up into--and the alphas would be the most likely to notice as they were able to smell it, he was sure.
“It wasn’t your fault.”
The grandfather clock in the parlor finally stuck midnight, and Maria finished her song with the beginning of the chimes.
“There’s no other omegas like me.” Tony shrugged.
he wanted to be alone. Once the two saw each other, it would probably be a different story.
The blond nodded, his mind stuck on Tony. "What year are we in?"
Maria and Jarvis had busied themselves in the kitchen early one afternoon preparing foods for both alpha and omega, both knowing that with Steve in full rut, that Tony was likely to fall into heat soon. It could have been a couple more days, it could have been a couple more hours. It was all a guessing game as to when Tony might go into heat. At least the omega had his alpha around again, but it was still a but scary for Maria to know her son was going to go into heat around an alpha in rut. Usually when ruts and heats were spent together, clear thinking and sound minds weren’t a common practice. The mother just hoped that Tony and Steve would be smart about their decisions.
“Other than my back still hurting, I feel okay,” Tony replied, smiling at his mother.  “Thanks for taking care of me… I thought I could just take care of myself like I’ve done before.”
The exasperated mother raised a hand to her forehead and sighed. “I’m sorry, Tony, I wish your father didn’t have to bring those topics up all the time, as if he doesn’t curse as well.”
The voice on the radio was hard to make out, but Steve wasn’t exactly focused on that noise just yet. His mind was still hazy, cold, like he had been sleeping for a very long time. He hadn’t opened his eyes yet, but he could tell that it was bright behind his eyelids.
Tony shook his head, hot tears forming in his eyes. “No… no you’re not. You don’t care. If you did, you wouldn’t be greeting me with shouting and anger.”
“If they have anything for you,” Maria continued, “I’m sure it’ll be more scandalous things than normal every-day clothing.”
Peggy aimed her gun and shot at the alpha, her face scrunched up in anger, but her shots didn’t help anything. The alpha grabbed Tony and hauled him back to his feet and pulled him flush against his body. “Shoot again and I’ll make sure you hit this omega,” the alpha shouted, his alpha tone coming through strong.
Nothing. No response came, and that was that. Steve was gone, and Tony didn’t want to admit it was true. “Steve?
"Welcome to SHIELD, Captain," Fury announced. "We're still working out some things, but thanks to Margaret Carter, we're a lot further along than we would have been."
“It just might...being drunk, I am more easily intimidated by overbearing alphas, and in my attempt to get away I could trip and hurt my ankle.”
“Tony, if I end up going overseas and you come with me, you’ll be put behind enemy lines most likely.”
Her expression was gentle and worrisome, and Tony couldn’t help but give her an expression that made him look a little overwhelmed. “Okay, Mom....”
“I’m sure he missed you just as much as you missed him,” Bucky spoke up, poking his head into Tony’s field of vision.
“As nice as she is, there’s no way I could live with her. She’d be making me dress up like a pretty omega in a matter of weeks.”
“A starving artist, then.”
Tony looked up at Steve, suddenly concerned. “What?”
“Pretty much healed at this point,” Tony replied, stepping back so he could look at both alphas that meant so much to him. “Doctor got onto me about not letting my original injury heal all the way before I dove into a fight.”
"You know," Tony said as Steve started kissing his neck. "I wasn't like this like ten minutes ago."
Tony closed his eyes. Such a violent way to die… Who knows how long they would have lived if the driver of that car hadn’t run off the road. “Thank you… that’s not really what I wanted to hear, but… it’s better than not knowing at all. I just hope that they were happy still after I left them. I’d feel really guilty if I knew they were unhappy.”
Fuck, it was hot.
“Are you sure? I can find something else to wear.”
“Sounds like you’re leaving again,” Tony said, taking a bite of his own sandwich while looking over at Steve. It had been a few days since the omega had been released from the hospital, and he was finally out of his heat and back to his normal self. His rib was still healing, but he had the ice pack the hospital sent home with him tapped down to his side.
"Hey now, don't sell yourself short. Your personality didn't change just because you were turned into an alpha supersoldier. Who knows, I might have been interested in you when you were a beta."
Tony made eye contact with his father and sighed. “Hopefully I get all of the lecture from him tonight. He’s got more important things to focus on for you tomorrow.”
“We’ll have a room as soon as we get back to the manor,” the omega said while shifting his weight to one side. “And it’s far away from my parents’ room, so we don’t have to worry too much about being too loud.”
Tony nodded, though he whined again as they walked towards the hangar. There were so many people around and not one of them that he saw was Steve. Was it too much to ask for just a small sign that would point the omega in the direction of his alpha?
"We'll do all we can now. I just hope we can spark some hope in our son. He's got more than one life to take care of now."
“Captain Rogers, wait!” the woman called after him, but he didn’t stop.
my chest?"
"Don't worry, I'm not rescuing hundreds of soldiers this time. I should be back late tonight."
The brunet sat in silence, his anger rising once more. "Steve, we're at a point in our lives where alphas and omegas are settled down and not playing around anymore. We're both 25 years old. Others our age would already be married and have kids. If you want to behave like you're 16 again and play around with other partners, let me know, because I don't want to be in this relationship anymore if that's the case."
When they arrived at Steve’s apartment, Tony took a deep breath, taking in the look and smell of the alpha’s temporary home. Everything about it felt safe, smelled safe, and Tony felt the best he had all day. He stood to the side as Steve and Bucky brought his things in, keeping the things that weren’t clothes, nesting supplies, or toiletries in the front room so they were ready to go when Tony would be leaving. Tony was relieved when Bucky bid farewell and left the couple alone in the apartment.
Sighing, Tony looked at the outfit he was going to wear to the date. It was nothing fancy, just some decent slacks that fit tightly around his butt and a simple button-up shirt with a vest to go over it. His tie was a nice red color with gold accents. It was a very nice outfit, one that Steve would have liked, but now everything was ruined, and all because Steve had chosen to kiss some random beta blonde that had crawled all over him.
“I don’t mind collars and leashes, you know. They can be fun.” tony hummed, hopping up to his feet, “Anyway, lab time, Mr. Artist?”
“No he’s not,” Howard snapped, standing up and striding over to his son. “Tony, you’ve got to be crazy going out there and fighting. You’re an omega, you can get hurt, or killed.”
That got a smile out of the brunet. “A shopping trip sounds great. Let me put on different clothes. You know there’s going to be alphas that can smell my heat coming.”
“Sorry, love, I’m just the messenger.”
“I just finished a heat a couple days ago.”
Steve’s head whipped around to Tony quicker than the agents could blink, and before they realized what was happening, Tony was smirking and preparing for Steve to come barreling towards them.
Thor looked up at Steve and held out his hand. “Wonderful to meet you Steve!”
Tony smiled and closed his eyes, “I’m going to nap. I don’t mind if you carry me back to the bed once the water starts getting cold.” he muttered.
Tony could barely get his lips around Steve’s not quite inflated knot, and he knew in the back of his mind that having Steve knot in his mouth was a bad idea… But still, it was entertaining to think of how that might feel. In the long run, his jaw would ache for hours, especially after being forced to keep an open position for an hour or so after the alpha knotted. But in the moment, it sure as hell would feel pretty good.
Once Obadiah walked off to disappear into the crowd, Tony sighed and turned to smile up at Steve, “Sorry about him. He’s been kind of like an overbearing parent ever since I lost my parents. I think he forgets I’m not a teenager anymore.”
With Steve tugging off Tony's pants, he managed to turn the brunet and push him down onto his back. The end result of these actions was Tony laying naked on the cot, knees brought up while the omega peeked around them at his alpha. Steve looked down at him with need, feeling his clothes get tight as his body reacted to Tony's scent. He took off the top of his costume, which he had even started to admit was ugly, and tossed it to the side, exposing his chest for the first intimate time to Tony. Next came his pants he wore on top of the costume, and the boots and socks. Lastly, his costume pants came off, leaving him in his briefs.
Maria shook her head and brushed back some of Tony’s hair. “Looks like you need a haircut. Your hair is getting long, unless you’ve been trying to grow it out for Steve.”
Except that he wasn’t at the same time. He, Steve, Peggy, and his father were all cramped underneath the streets of London in some secret base that held untold secrets from the world. Tony thought there were so many secrets that the world would never get the chance to know them unless a huge leak in information occurred. Which was highly unlikely because this base wasn’t known to the public. Hell, it also acted as a bunker in case nuclear war broke out. Tony hoped that would never be the case.
“Omega,” Steve growled out, looking up at Tony through his lashes. His blue eyes seemed to turn darker the longer Tony grinded against him, and his alpha side was going absolutely wild. No clear thoughts made their way to the front of his mind, because all he could focus on was the omega on top of him and his need to flip Tony over and fuck him until the sun rose.
After several minutes of simply kissing and feeling each other up, Steve pulled back and cleared his throat, knowing just how red his face was. “We probably shouldn’t wait too long to get to Malibu…”
“No, you were definitely going to say something.”
“It still hurts like it happened yesterday,” Tony choked out. “I never got to know the gender of the baby, but I miss them so much, Steve.”
Steve shrugged as he got out of the car, letting Tony climb out. As much as he wanted to kiss the omega good night, he knew that would be pushing the limits of Howard’s patience. He opted for a simple smile. “Good night, Tony, Mr. Stark.”
"I do have a car. I'll let you know what to do before I pay in the morning, then while I pay you can talk to your friend and meet me by my car when I'm done."
Steve rolled his eyes. “I meant within the next 24 hours. I can smell your scent start to change.”
“Alphaaaaa,” Tony responded with a whine.
Steve’s eyes widened as he leaned against the shelves in the closet. “You’re really eager to do this…”
Tony shrugged, his finger rubbing the paint splotch on Steve’s shirt. “I kind of like it.”
“It still hurts… I hurt, Mama…” Tony’s eyes filled with new tears as his mother held him.
"I'll try not to be gone long," the blond said as he leaned down to kiss Tony's forehead.
Steve tossed his head to the side like an animal and exhaled through his nose. He was fighting back against something, but whatever he was fighting against didn’t take long to beat down, because the alpha was grabbing Tony’s hips and flipping the omega over onto his stomach, forcing him into the submissive position that Steve went crazy over. He groaned lowly yet again as he grabbed Tony’s ass cheeks and spread them apart, shoving his face forward to lap up the slick that just seemed to be pouring out of Tony’s ass.
Tony got a few more visitors that day, the remaining Howling Commandos coming by to see how he was; shocked and pained to see their little friend in such a bad state. They all were hopeful, knowing that Tony was a tough omega and could survive anything if he put his mind to it. With their hopeful condolences, the Howling Commandos each left their wing patches with the omega, along with a little cash to help the family, because they knew more than anyone in the room, except for Tony, how hard it was to lose friends in war.
Steve looked confused. “Tony, that’s not how I meant that to come out.”
Tony blinked over at Steve then snapped his fingers, “Ah, hot artist alpha!”
“I should have told Steve before we attacked the Hydra base, or told him over the radio when he was on that plane. Maybe he wouldn’t have decided to go down with the damned thing.”
“Hardly. He told me what happened… and then he just disappeared. He won’t stay in his apartment for long, so we had hoped that having you here would help him cope better.”
Going through his things and packing them away in their respective places, Tony couldn’t help but let his heart ache from being away from Steve. They hadn’t officially bonded, but he couldn’t count how many times they had scented each other, so they might as well have been bonded.
“I’ll keep holding him,” Howard said as Jarivs left. “See how bad it is, Maria…”
“Jarvis has some heating on the stove.” she nodded.
“I was just wondering if you were free tonight. I’m having a couple of friends over to play cards and maybe some Mario Cart as well. I thought you could probably use some more friends since you’re new to the area, and this would be a good opportunity. Plus there’ll be beer.”
“Got it.”
Happy and content, Tony didn’t even notice when another alpha approached and tapped Steve on the shoulder.
Tony offered a dry laugh. “I’ll show you how, just make sure you come home…”
It was a long night for Tony. He went back and forth between being hot and cold. He tossed and turned, touched himself and held himself back from touching. Nothing felt right, nothing was comfortable. He wanted Steve so bad, even though he had the alpha’s scent surrounding him. He needed Steve to hold him down, to tell him he was going to be okay, to be with him through his heat, to calm his nerves.
“What are you doing here,” Steve asked. “I thought you were up in London.”
"The SSR… did we win the war?" Steve asked at he watched skyscrapers pass by.
"You are a good omega. The best, in fact, and it's because of your skills in robotics. Screw what Justin said, you don't need to be controlled or forced to have a family when you're not ready for it. You're entitled to just as much freedom as every alpha you've ever come into contact with."
“It’s alright, Tony. When you told me you were with Mr. Rogers, I knew you were going to be safe, no matter where you were.”
“I’d love to.” Clint smiled, taking Bucky’s hand.
“You say sorry as if you aren’t talking to a guy who still has a grease stain on his pants from an incident earlier today.”
Sighing softly, Steve pulled Tony close and hugged him tight, attempting to ease the distressed omega as best as he could without upsetting Tony. Of course the whole situation was already upsetting, but Steve did his best to make it less upsetting. Knowing that his omega was going to be shipped home as soon as his heat was over was distressing even to him.
“I’m sorry, Tony…”
“I’m a spoiled brat. I never learned how to be shy. Dad never let me be shy, even as a tiny little thing just learning to walk.”
“You two are very serious about each other, aren’t you?”
“It’s the least I can do after scaring you so bad you smacked your face into a mirror.” Steve held his hand out for Tony to take.
Tony shrugged weakly, looking quite tired.
“You sure it works?” Steve asked, taking it in his hand and looking over it.
"Still, I would have found some way to stop it. You were more focused on your education, I'm sure. And if you weren't well… I still would have respected you a lot more than he did. He's an asshole."
Steve’s shoulders noticeably fell. Tony and Peggy could only see his back, but his whole body language changed in mere seconds. The omega stepped forward and put his hand on Steve’s arm, offering any amount of comfort he could. Hearing the news that his best friend had died was very hard on the young alpha. Then suddenly his shoulders lifted again, blue eyes piercing as he looked at Phillips.
“Well, I was thinking… since I stay at our base here in London all the time… maybe I could do more this time.”
“So, J, Pepper hired him to paint a mural in the main lobby. Bring up some of the funner designs for him to draw inspiration from. He’s already signed an NDA, so no worries on any of that.”
“Let the man in,” Howard said. “It’s cold outside and I don’t want to pay an extra large heating bill this month.”
“I still had hoped we’d have a nice evening all the way through despite knowing Ty and Justin would be there. I should have known better.”
my fault. I neglected my own needs, I let myself fall to my anxiety! I failed, Steve,
“Responsible for what?!”
Tony sighed and nuzzled Steve's arm lightly. Since their A&W date, the two had explored their relationship a bit. Really they were still in their courting phase, but Tony felt like that was coming to a close, especially since his next heat was due so soon. Steve might be willing to join Tony for their first heat together. Sighing Tony turned his head and pressed a small kiss to Steve's shoulder, looking down at what the alpha had drawn.
“We don’t want that, now do we?” Tony rolled over, despite Steve’s whine of opposition, and kissed the alpha’s nose. “I’m gonna be right by your side until this war ends, no matter what.”
Tony took in a shaking breath. “Mom said… that you were working on finding Steve.”
The trip to the military base felt too long to Tony. He watched trees and cars pass by, but he still felt like the drive was taking far too long already. Time seemed to stand still when Tony was waiting on his alpha.
“The right partner… but I suppose I can fancy a dance with a soldier for now, if only to let these two have a dance together as well.” Peggy took the arm Bucky offered her, chuckling as Tony flushed darkly. “Oh eight-hundred, Captain,” she said to Steve just before she disappeared with Bucky.
“Wow, yes, I… yes, sleeping with me… sleeping in the same bed as me. Yes.” Steve cleared his throat, suddenly feeling warm.
Tony seemed to be happy with that. He snuggled up close to Steve and took in his sharp alpha scent. His sigh was a happy one, and as he relaxed, he eventually fell into a deep sleep that he hadn’t gotten the luxury of for a long time. With Steve next to him, Tony was safe. Tony would be well taken care of, and that was perfect to him. In his sleep, he dreamed of the perfect life he would have with Steve after the war ended. Starting a family, getting married, it all sounded so nice, and he wasn’t usually one to settle for typical alpha and omega family fantasies. It was just that in his moment of being in heat, having several strong blond alpha pups sounded so good, and maybe one day, his dream would come true.
“It’ll still be hard, but you’re not going anywhere, young man,” came Howard’s voice as he approached the small group. “I’ve had enough of you getting in the middle of things in this war.”
“Tony, this isn’t what it looks like,” Steve tried, only to be shut down very quickly by the brunet.
“No, you don’t understand… You need to know this. Steve and I shared my heat… and he was in rut at the same time. We…” Tony swallowed again, putting a hand over his stomach subconsciously. “We forgot to use protection and… Peggy, I’m pregnant!”
Steve smiled. “I wasn’t saying you couldn’t go. I still believe in the little guys fighting. I’m just telling you that you’ll be in enemy territory. Plus you’ll be around a… lot of alphas. The army is basically all alphas.”
"Did your father ever get better?"
“I’m fine, it’s just bruised, that’s all.”
. Grabbing a grenade off of his belt, Tony stood up straighter and widened his stance.
As the day dragged on, Tony only started to feel worse. He was hot, but every time he checked his temperature, he never had a fever of any kind. His chest was tender every time he went to touch it, he was almost constantly dizzy and nauseous, and he kept getting more upset and irritated the longer he wasn’t well. Another trip to the bathroom left him in tears and screaming profanities as loud as he could.
“Don’t apologize, I understand, Tony.” The blond pushed his omega back slightly and made him look up. “The great thing about relationships is that there are two people to consider. If this is moving too fast for you, all you have to do is tell me, and I’ll slow down.”
Steve stayed quiet for a bit while they danced, holding Tony close and smiling. When he spoke up again, it was to comment about the music.
“Then make it look like you’re just worried,” Steve said, glaring down at Howard. “Don’t restrict Tony from doing what he wants when he’s a full grown adult omega and you claim you support omega rights.”
By the time Steve had finished, Tony still had not eaten a single bite, and it made the alpha sink a little. He had wanted this night to be nice for the both of them, but instead he had opened his mouth and said things he shouldn’t have. Tony thought that he was dumping him, for crying out loud. Tony thought Steve didn’t like him, which was a flat out lie. Steve had honestly liked Tony ever since they met. Even when he was still a beta, the blond had found Tony to be an attractive omega. Of course he hadn’t said anything before, because what omega wants a scrawny beta as a partner? But now… After his change into an alpha, his attraction to Tony just intensified; it was actually possible that he’d have a chance.
Waiting for that moment of Tony’s awakening was proving to become more difficult, and Howard began to worry about making a call to Maria and break the news to her. He didn’t want to make the call, but by the end of the second day, the chances of Tony waking up and surviving seemed very slim. Howard probably had an understanding of why, but Peggy knew the situation better, and if Tony had made his decision that living without Steve wasn’t worth it, even with a baby that Steve was the father of, Tony wasn’t going to wake up ever.
Night was falling quickly, and Tony’s heat was only intensifying by the minute. Peggy tugged him back towards the camp. “Come on, we’ll get you your own tent set up close to the medical tent.”
“I promise I’ll show you. I can do this.”
“That’s alright. The longer I get to stay next to you, the better I’ll be tonight.”
“Steve, you’ll die out there,” Tony said in a shaking tone. If wasn’t out of fear. Of course the little alpha show only minutes before had set off what he hoped would have waited a few more days. He shivered, making his knees buckle a little. “D-damn it, Steve…”
“Gross. That old alpha would never be the perfect roommate.”
If the banging on the door wasn’t enough to wake alpha and omega from their sleep, Maria’s yelling through the closed door was. Tony and Steve jolted awake and tried to process what was going on. Steve was out of the bed first, putting on a t-shirt and  hurrying out the door before Tony had even a chance to take a guess at what needed Steve’s attention so badly.
Steve, feeling Tony tense up, pulled his hand away quickly. “Sorry… I think I need to get used to being an alpha before I try touching you again.”
Steve hung up and pocketed his phone before closing up paint cans and washing roller and brushes with him on the scaffolding. In little time he was back on the floor and throwing his jacket on to brave against the slightly chilly New York City air. By the time he was outside Stark Tower, the address to James’s place had been sent to him, and getting into his car, he drove to the location given to him.
Though the baby still wasn’t very big, Tony swore he could feel the extra weight already. Or maybe that was him just eating too much and thinking it was baby weight. Either way, every time he managed to think of his baby, the slightest hint of a smile graced his lips.
this morning he was shoving his face in my ass and licking up my slick like I was the fountian of fucking youth or something.”
“Hush, baby, maybe there’s still a chance…”
Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck and kissed his cheek. “Peggy called and told me what happened… I… I couldn’t let you be alone.”
“It’s true,” Pepper said, defending Tony.
Tony managed to leave the Stark apartment with a small smile on his face, carrying a ball of blankets that vaguely smelled like his alpha. That scent would be renewed soon, something that Tony looked forward to. He was still upset, however, that his heat was basically being forced to happen. This heat was probably going to be the worst one yet, which held almost no promise of feeling anything but pain, even if Steve was there to accompany him. However, despite the pain that was surely to come for at least a few days, Tony was determined not to let it hinder him. He was still a soldier, although having only brief training, and soldiers pushed through the worst of times.
The alpha flushed when his mind came to those latter thoughts. Now was definitely not the time to get excited. He willed himself to calm back down before he returned to the kitchen, the smell of a fresh meatloaf filling his nostrils.
“Of course not. The Tony Stark inner circle shares information on how to take care of Tony Stark. Steve’s now part of the group.”
Tony whined, clearly not wanting to worry about his clothes getting ruined by slick or cum. “I think you should just keep your mouth shut for now.”
“Tell me as much as you want, honey,” Maria encouraged.
“I’ll say I want to speak with more high-up representatives of this Hydra group to make sure it’s not just sounding too good to be true. We omegas can’t be too careful, after all. Many like to take advantage of us.”
Another promise made to him in the same night. Tony was glad he had good friends that understood him better than his parents did. Simply having someone who told him it was okay for him to act this way during his heat was far better than what his father or even his mother had ever told him, though the Maria had always tried to be supportive and understanding.
“Hey, Tony,” Howard said gently, smiling a little when the omega leaned into the touch. “I have some water for you, and some food if you feel like eating.”
“So? Just because I’m an omega, that doesn’t mean I don’t have the ability to take care of myself. And don’t use the day you went super soldier as an example. I was in pre-heat, I wasn’t at my full strength.”
“Splendid!” Thor turned to the living room and approached the couch, his smile seeming to get wider and wider. “I’m here Bruce,” he crooned while shoving his nose into his omega’s neck.
The brunet shook his head. “I won’t forgive you so easily. I’m still convinced you aren’t ready to settle with me, so give me some time to think…”
Tony’s words faded as Howard approached his family, and without a second thought, the older man wrapped his arms around his son and wife, sandwiching Tony between his parents. The omega couldn’t hold onto his tears anymore. For the first time in his life, that he could remember, both his parents were supporting him, but the situation existed because Steve was gone, and that by itself was already so painful for the poor omega that the hug almost felt healing in a way.
Steve
“I still need to make you a better costume. The one you continue to wear, despite my complaining, is still a monstrosity. Besides, if you’re ever going to go into actual combat, that costume wouldn’t keep you safe for two seconds.” Tony reached over Steve’s lap and grabbed the sketchbook, turning to a blank page and starting to sketch a design.
“According to my new best friend, under 24 hours,” Phillips said.
The blond turned towards the sound of his name being called out, blue eyes wide as he caught sight of Tony pushing through the crowd to get to him. Steve smiled and laughed, holding his arms out to catch the omega in a tight hug.
Tony winced at Howards sharp words, every one of them true. Tony had put himself out on the line and willingly made himself a target of Hydra. It was a bad situation to be in, but Steve and Bucky had protected him the whole time. Surely that could mean that they would keep protecting him, and Howard would be okay with that.
"You brought my son into a warzone?!"
Peggy was waiting for Tony when he got off the plane and all his things were unloaded. He hugged her so tight when he saw her again, another round of crying shaking his body as he hugged Peggy. She did her best to soothe him, but she knew Steve was better at soothing, even if he was not in a good mental state.
“What can I say? It’s been months since I was able to share a heat with you.”
Tony bit his bottom lip, closing his eyes as his body shook with silent sobs. “This won’t be fixed easily, you know…”
“The game. It’s from May 1941. I know because I was there.”
“Anthony Edward Stark!”
Nodding, the omega closed his door, wanting nothing more but to crawl back into bed and sleep more. He returned to the desk and looked over the scattered papers filled with drawings. A new design for Steve’s suit was all planned out. Tony must have gotten up in the middle of the night to draw it.
“Through a wall? Good god, Steve, I didn’t throw people through walls when I woke up.” Tony managed a small smile, but it was so full of pain that Steve wondered what all his omega had gone through without him.
“Welcome home, Tony,” the butler said when the omega was within hearing range.
Turning her head, Peggy, raised an eyebrow. “Are you sure? It can’t wait until we get back to London?”
The omega’s body shook with his sobs. He wanted to speak, to object to Steve’s plan, but he physically couldn’t speak without wailing. He remained silent, listening to the last sentences his alpha was ever going to say to him. The new pain he felt was gut deep and heart aching, and there was no escaping or healing it. Tony knew he only had a short time left with his alpha, and he wanted to badly to hold Steve as tightly as he could.
Tony paused, swallowing and taking shaky breaths. “I know you were there for the whole thing… but losing your daddy hurts… it hurts a lot, Little Bitsy.”
Steve said nothing else as he and Tony continued to cuddle through the movie JARVIS had chosen for them. Occasionally one of them would move to grab a snack, but for the most part the two just remained in a cuddling position, so only enjoying being together at home rather than at the gala where paparazzi and exes lurked about. Here at home it was better, warmer, happier. And to Steve, perhaps home didn't just mean the place he lived anymore. Home was Tony curled up with him on the couch watching a movie and simply enjoying each other's presence.
“Mom, I don’t wanna be sick anymore,” he wailed through his tears.
Howard and Maria walked in, Maria looking like she had been crying for a while. Tony didn’t pay attention to that though, because as soon as he saw his mother, his own eyes grew wet and he attempted to reach his arms out and sit up, which of course caused him more pain.
“Let’s get this briefing done quickly so you can leave,” Peggy said. “The Hydra camp is in Krausberg tucked between these two mountain ranges.” She pulled out a map and pointed to where she was talking about. “It’s a factory of some kind. Howard should be able to drop you almost on the doorstep.”
Tony, you just exposed yourself to the enemy. They know who you are now, you have an identity out there that Hydra is out for now. You’re on Hydra’s hit list now! They want to kill you!”
As April and March flew past, Tony found himself being occupied by daily chores that an omega in a normal household might perform. It wasn’t because he was forced, but he needed something to keep himself from worrying about Steve. Cleaning and cooking and washing all seemed like good activities to pursue while being left alone for most of the day. Jarvis had gladly accepted the help from Tony, though he insisted several times that he didn’t need additional help cleaning up the manor. Still, he wasn’t going to tell the omega no if he really wanted to help. Having a friend to help do chores with was always more fun than doing chores alone.
“Well I hope that’s a comfort to the both of you when they come shut this division down.”
"Honestly I wanted to do this the day I caught you kissing that private," the omega said in a rough tone. "But I made you wait, and I've made myself wait, and I can't wait any longer." Tony reached down and unbuckled Steve's belt while maintaining eye contact with those intense blue eyes.
“I ruined everything. I ruined Steve’s clothes, I lost his baby, I…” Tony choked on a sob. “
“Relax,” Fury said. “I know you want to know all about him, but we can’t really tell you much right now.”
The date didn't happen at all that night. Tony was too pissed off at Steve to even want to go just for the food, and he really didn’t want to see the stupid alpha’s face either. He had hoped that shooting at Steve had discouraged him from coming by the apartment to try to make things up. However, knowing Steve, Tony knew he would try just that, and that really wasn’t something that Tony could handle for a while. He needed time to cool down, think about his options. Maybe he could just let Steve go quietly, forget they had ever been together and move back home to be with his worried mother again.
The omega whined and closed his eyes, his vision swirling far too much for him to even see straight. “I don’t feel good,” he said, though his mother already knew that.
“I may be interested. Too bad you didn’t go with that guy to the club last night, I would have offered you a private session.” Clint said, gesturing behind them at the other couple.
“I suppose. It doesn’t matter much now anyways, considering they’re both dead…” Tony let out a sad sigh as he saw Steve get up out of the corner of his eye. “I mean it does matter to me…  I just wanna know if they were happy the rest of their lives.”
“Probably. Depends on how things play out, alpha.” Tony said,smirking at Steve.
“Don’t get carried away, Tony, and do not blow up the artist.”
“Hey, I’m sure you’re fine, honey,” Maria said softly, rubbing Tony’s back. “Just relax, and let it out if it needs to.”
"I'm so sorry, Tony," Steve crooned softly. "If I had known you when you were in college, I would have tried to stop what he did to you."
Tony took in a shaking breath and hid his face in his mother’s neck. “I’m pregnant… I can’t believe it.”
“I will, I promise. I’m sorry about what I said earlier, accusing you of cheating on me. I panicked because you saw me with the private.”
Looking around Steve halted, tapping Bucky and Tony lightly to get them to stop as well. Instinctively the three stood with their backs to each other, looking around for any signs of movement from the vehicles. There was nothing that they could see, but it was still suspicious that there weren’t any Hydra agents just milling about the entrance to the base. Then there was a small metallic sound, a sound that caught Tony’s attention and drew it towards one of the cars near him. Hurried footsteps followed soon after, to which Tony raised his gun and moved to watch the fleeing Hydra agent. He was going to shoot, until he noticed the grenade right next to his feet.
“He must be. Otherwise I doubt you would have asked to dance.”
“There’s always that chance anywhere we go outside private areas.” Tony shrugged. “I’m used to them, so it’s up to you if you want to risk that.”
The omega looked over at the man. “I must have missed it. Then again, this is the first thing I’ve seen in here that I actually like.”
Looking back at the bed, Tony smiled. His alpha was sound asleep with the covers half off his body, mouth open in a quiet snore. Tony let Steve sleep a little longer as he grabbed some fresh clothes and some peanuts that Maria had put in a dish for them before his heat started. Tony was starving, but he needed a shower more than anything.
“I was let in to get inspiration for the mural,” Steve confirmed. “Amazing stuff.”
There were a lot of nurses, and one man who looked like a doctor, who smiled at Steve before stepping out of his way. And then there, right in front of him being supported by a couple of nurses, was a little brunet omega with long dark curls and a hint of facial hair. Soft brown eyes, gentle hands gripping tightly onto the nurses, and a glowing blue disk in his chest. He was dressed in soft clothing, a loose t-shirt that had the bolded letters of ARMY across the chest, and a pair of jeans that seemed to barely stay on the man’s hips. He looked just a little older, but that was him. That was Steve’s omega.
“Well, I was just thinking of how many major bases we had left to take down. Is this the last major base before we find the last one?”
“I told you they’d look good on you,” she said as she reached around and grabbed her necklace, fastening it around her neck. “Eyeliner is right there.”
Tony pouted at her, “I eat.”
After several hours of shopping and seeing the sights, Tony was taken to his favorite restaurant for dinner, and he was genuinely smiling through most of the night. He felt happy for the first time in so very long, and he knew he was sad to be leaving his parents soon, but he was happy to spend his last day with them being a happy family and simply enjoying the pleasures in life he still had. Soon Tony wouldn’t be so lonely anymore, and eventually he would see his parents again, and he’d give them a huge hug on that day.
!” Tony woke up, humming out soft moans of pleasure that confused his sleep-fogy mind until it caught up to what his body already knew.
Once they had a wine picked out that both would enjoy drinking, they began looking over the menu, sitting in happy silence while they decided what they wanted. Before too long the waiter came back with the wine and glasses to put it in, plus some water glasses. He took the couple’s orders and went back to the kitchen to get their meals started.
“That won’t be necessary,” Phillips replied, a smile pulling at the corners of his mouth.
"None of it matters now. What matters is that we get our son back to top health and we save that baby of his. In this condition, I don't think either of them will survive if we don't try harder."
"Thanks, I have a feeling I'll need someone more my age to be with me until Steve gets back."
"Sounds good. I think I saw an A&W nearby, does that sound good?”
"Yeah, I think it works." The omega tossed the gun back on the table and left the lab.
“Oh, about a week ago,” the omega replied as he took Steve’s arm and walked through the crowding people to the parlor.
Noticing his omega gagging, Steve rubbed Tony’s thigh comfortingly. “Easy… After today, things will be better.”
“That’s hardly a good way of thinking…”
The blond finally left the briefing room, thinking about his future and how his country was going to change in the next few months.
“And when are you planning on moving out? Sooner rather than later?”
“Justine Hammer, by the way.” he said, offering a handshake to Steve.
"Kentucky Tavern."
The first day of waiting went by with nurses coming in to check Tony’s heart rate and wounds every hour or so. Nothing dramatic happened, which was good, but also not really desired. Howard hardly got any sleep worrying over his son, and Peggy was in much of the same position. Both worried endlessly over the omega, but they let the nurses and doctors do their jobs.
“No, never any real name… but I did start calling them Little Bitsy, as a pet name.” Tony shrugged as he turned his head to look out at the rain.
Howard brought up a chair next to the bed and sat in it, not wanting to upset Tony’s stomach with the smell of food in case his stomach wasn’t well. Tony didn’t move when Howard reached his hand over to brush through his son’s hair long dark curls clumped together with sweat and tears.
“How do you feel about makeup?” Peggy asked as she unlocked the door to her apartment, pushing it open and going inside, turning on the lights.
“I’ve been trying my best,” Howard said gently. “You know I haven’t given up on finding Steve.”
now, plus he was travelling with a trusted alpha, so it wasn't like he was alone and without protection.
“This would be a good time for me to try out my suit’s shielding ability,” the omega said in a serious tone. “I can help draw fire away from the other commandos.”
"I care about you, Tony. I know I can't fix what happened in the past, but I want you to help you have a better future at least." Steve hugged Tony close, kissing the top of the omega's' head.
When the metal casing was sterilized and transferred to the hole in Tony’s chest, Howard took a few seconds to breathe and refocus, taking materials from the first aid kit Tony had carried as a soldier and doing his best to sew up the open skin around the casing until he was sure the casing wasn’t going to go anywhere. It was embedded almost as deep as the shrapnel was, and Howard hoped that was enough to hold the reactor in place.
When the lab had been cleaned, both Peggy and Steve came in, the alpha looking very upset and ashamed. Tony ignored them, opting instead to look over his designs angrily and consider tearing them up so they would never be used. He ignored a lot of the conversations that the three were having until Howard mentioned something about vibranium, which caught Tony's attention. One shield the older Stark had constructed was perfectly round, shiny, and was apparently made of the only vibranium that was available at the time. Tony was aware that Steve turned towards him with the shield in hand, and he lowered his eyebrows when Steve smiled.
“Steve, is that you?! Are you alright?” Tony pushed the commando out of the chair and sat down with wide eyes, Peggy grabbing the chair behind him.
The omega looked up mid bite, eyes wide. He lowered his spoon into the bowl of cereal he had been eating and got up. “Who is it? Why do you look so down?”
Placing their drinks to the side, Tony and Steve made their way to the dance floor, which didn’t escape the attention of Peggy. She smiled as she watched them assume a normal dancing position and start to sway to the time of the music. The dancing was a bit stiff at first, but both seemed to relax after a bit and flow much easier. There was silence between them, just eye contact and physical touch as they danced. Everything melted away to Tony and Steve. It was just them, dancing to the music and looking at each other with nothing but pure love. God, the moment would have been so cheesy had it not been romantic to the point of Tony stepping closer and wrapping his arms around Steve, simply swaying as his head rested against the alpha’s chest.
"Officially, I'm not here at all." Peggy sat down and looked at the two men. "That was quite a performance, Steve."
“Agent Carter, coordinate with MI6. I want every allied eyeball looking for that main Hydra base.”
"War gets in the way. It's hard to be able to enjoy a holiday, and you know that."
Steve crawled onto the cot slowly, one foot still on the ground so he didn’t flip the cot over. He gently placed his hands on Tony’s knees, silently asking for permission to spread them. There was a bit of hesitation, but before long, Tony relaxed his legs and nodded at Steve, taking in a deep breath and letting it out slowly.
“Far enough, I promise.”
The omega laughed when Steve raised an eyebrow at him. “Oh relax, you big dumb alpha. Your alphaness isn’t so sensitive that you’re offended by what I said.”
“I have to go find Bucky,” he said after a pause. “I know you want me to stay here with you, and even more so now that you’re going into heat. I… I want to protect you, but the best thing for you to do is stay here and wait for me to get back. If you go with me, you’ll be a liability. I hate saying that, but it’s the truth.”
“Always a pleasure, Mister Stark.” The butler bowed with a smile, watching Tony walk away as he cleaned up the empty glasses and the bottle of whiskey. “And don’t forget that water.”
“Well, you can look over the videos your father recorded for you. We do have those on file and ready for you to watch if you would like.”
Tony held back the new wave of tears remembering Steve’s sacrifice. “You never seemed like you wanted to save me before… you always yelled at me and wanted me to stay home, and now… I…”
“Hopefully not the latter option.” Steve squeezed Tony’s hand. “Don’t worry about it, you helped us take down the base that had the location of the Hydra headquarters. That’s got to count for something in his book, I hope.”
Tony gasped, “I’d never!”
The alpha looked down at the paint and sighed. “Sorry, I thought this shirt was clean when I changed into it before coming here.”
“Don’t blame yourself for this, Tony,” Steve said, stepping closer to the omega. “This is my fault. I brought you here with me, I put you in danger.” He sighed and cupped the side of Tony’s face with his hand. “I’m sorry, but I can’t stay with you right now. I have to find those soldiers.”
"I wouldn't care either way," Steve said with a shrug. He spotted a gas station and pulled into a parking space. "Alright, let's get you two some food."
“I’d hate to be the person you test that out on,” Steve said with a smirk.
“We’ll have to get someone else in to look at him then,” the doctor said, his tone very serious.
February first was a day that Tony hoped he didn’t have to see come so soon. It began like any other day; waking up, going to the bathroom, foraging for breakfast while deciding what to wear for the day. Tony was in the middle of his breakfast when the main phone line rang in the manor. He thought nothing of it until Jarvis came into the kitchen where Tony was eating.
“Yes?” Tony stopped, repressing a sigh. He knew it’d only be a matter of time before someone he was passing by would do something to grab his attention—and part of his job was to humor such customers.
Being satisfied with his performance, Steve sat back finally and wiped his face off, not bothering to wipe his hands on the sheets before he was grabbing Tony’s hips and pulling them up more. He settled his cock between the omega’s ass cheeks and thrusted a couple times to coat himself in Tony’s slick. He was pleased with all the noises his omega was making, so he growled back as a response, and then finally he pressed the tip of his cock against Tony’s waiting hole.
“Great! I’ll text you my address. Don’t worry about bringing anything, I won a bet and tonight’s being funded by my friend, Tones, which means he’s bringing the good pizza and not just the Hot and Ready stuff.”
“Relax, Mr. Stark,” the medic said, putting a calm hand on the father’s shoulder. “It’s alright. It looked like you dressed the wounds well. And… this?” He tapped the arc reactor in wonder.
A heavy sigh escaped Tony’s lips as he let his arms drop back to his sides. "It won't, but I'll stay. I don't want to be around a bunch of drunk alphas anyways."
Tony excitedly jumped into the car when they were out back of the theater Steve had just performed in. Tony had wanted to drive so bad, but he never was allowed to because of his father believing in the ways of old. Besides, it was illegal for omegas to drive, vote, or even buy alcohol without the consent of an alpha, and even then, the alpha did all the work anyways, so really the omegas couldn’t do anything but watch their alphas do things for them. Unless, of course, it was house-keeping or raising the family, by which the omega was always responsible. Not things Tony really ever wanted to do.
The meeting with the Howling Commandos and Peggy went about as well as it could have gone. All the soldiers were supportive and willing to help a new soldier out, while Peggy was sworn to secrecy as she supported her friends, especially Tony. Everything was going so much better than Tony could have even dreamed. The fact that he was being supported by so many made him feel that he really could go through with this.
“Should have grabbed my coat before we left,” Tony grumbled, letting Peggy go ahead of him and lead him to her apartment. “I hope what you’re planning on having me wear is warm.”
At those words, Steve looked back down at Tony, eyes locking onto the omega’s. If only there was a bit of sunlight coming through the clouds, Tony’s eyes would light up such a beautiful golden color. Steve wanted to see that, to see Tony shining like the sun, happy and bright, eyes lit up and a smile on his face. Steve wanted to see that more than anything else, he realized. He also realized how close their faces actually were, and how easily he could just lean in and kiss Tony. They were away from prying eyes, the moment was right. He leaned in closer, and so did Tony, those bright brown eyes wide as he also realized what was happening. Then Tony’s eyes were closing, and so were Steve’s and they were almost touching, almost kissing.
Flying to Malibu had been relaxing and serene. They were on a private jet that very clearly had a logo for Stark Industries on the side of it, which had excited Tony greatly when he saw it. It meant that Howard had achieved something absolutely fantastic while Tony was sleeping away the years. Tony was sure that he was going to learn more about Stark Industries in the near future.
Steve shook his head with a smile. “Sorry, you need to wait to see it. Otherwise all the excitement would be taken out of it.”
Tony’s eyes widened as Phillips raised his pen to point at Peggy.
Steve smiled and rubbed a thumb over the omega’s cheek. “I’d like to do some gift giving as well… We’ll see if we get to have Christmas off of all this mess. If we do, I’ll take you somewhere special.”
“Yeah? Well, if you came to watch me work once in a while, you’d see more paint splattered all over my clothes.”
"I saw the one about the puppet with the growing nose. Haven't seen any other of Disney's movies, but I agree, I think they're going to get really popular."
“Are you okay?” Steve asked, pulling back enough to look at Tony.
“We need to get Steve on that plane,” Peggy said when Colonel Phillips met them near a row of cars that had been parked in the hangar. “Otherwise we lose this fight.”
The omega laid in silence for a while, glancing around his room and noticing the bouquet of flowers sitting on the counter next to the sink. He couldn’t make out what the card said next to the vase, but he guessed they were from his mother.
“I think that’s a good plan,” Steve said with a nod. “We can get some nice flowers for them as well.”
After a while, Steve pulled away, keeping his hands on Tony’s face. “I couldn’t leave you behind, Tony. Not in a million years. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to leave you or take you with me because I care about you a lot. I don’t want to see you get hurt, or worse, while in Europe.”
He smiled and moved to sit down in the chair next to Steve, only to be interrupted.
Tony was smiling like an idiot as he rushed to finish getting ready. He was minutes away from seeing his alpha again, so he was giddy and walked with a spring in his step. He was ignoring the fact that Howard would also be there because he didn’t want anything to ruin the day. Tony was going to see Steve again after several months of being apart, and the omega was dying to get his hands on that blond alpha once more.
“Your audience contained what was left the of the 107th. The rest were killed or captured.”
“You did everything you could, Steve.” Peggy sighed and shifted the chair closer that she had sat down in. “Did you believe in Bucky? Did you respect him?”
Tony was going to have the whole nest soaked if he didn’t wake Steve up right that moment, but he just couldn’t bring himself to do it yet. His stomach growled from hunger and need, and both feelings were equally as intense. Tony really needed to eat before he was ready to take on Steve once more, but…
Tony whined again, feeling so happy to have pleased his alpha. This was what he had wanted, and he hadn’t known that until Steve called him omega and held him closer. He felt even better when Steve put a hand on his belly and gently caressed it. God that would feel so good later on down the road when they decided they wanted to have kids.
“The scandal! Being lied to by the honorable Pepper Potts!”
“Even so, he’s devising a strategy--”
Tony sighed with yet another round of tears. "Mom played the piano for me the day I went into suspended animation. It was so beautiful… I already miss my parents so much."
“You don’t know how badly I want that to be true,” the brunet said as he grabbed Steve’s hand and held it tight.
And perhaps, his Little Bitsy would be waiting for him on the other side, playing with their grandparents with a huge smile on their face.
“So when’s the next base attack planned for?” he asked, planning on bringing the plan up gently to Steve.
“Super soldier who wakes up in a strange time and gets bombarded with agents, wouldn’t you think I’d try something to escape?”
“What’s he gonna do? Lecture your ears off?” Tony shook his head and grabbed his now refilled drink. “I doubt anything will happen to you.”
Looking around the store, there were several racks of clothes that were either brand new or on sale, most of which were not exactly in styles that Tony liked. He wandered around until something, hopefully anything, would catch his eye. It took going through most of the store before he finally found something on a rack hidden away at the back of the store. It was mostly clearance, but the one thing he did find on the rack was something about as flashy as Tony could imagine himself wearing.
“Yeah, I just… I’m a Stark, yeah, but I’m also an omega. I see mostly alphas in here, maybe some betas, but no omegas.”
After several songs, Tony was holding back yawn after yawn and leaning heavily into Steve. He could honestly fall asleep in Steve’s arms, but he had to get back to his father. Howard would be upset if he stayed out any longer. Besides, Steve had to be at the base in the morning bright and early. He needed rest just as much as Tony did.
“I can bring some snacks if you’re hungry,” she said with a sigh.
to this meeting, Pep?”
Happy was standing outside the limo, ready to open the door for the two of them once they got close enough. “Everything okay?”
"Why are we here?" Steve asked, though his mind was jumping to conclusions as to why exactly they were there.
“We didn’t take into account that the procedure would turn Steve into an alpha, or that it would have an affect on you to suddenly have a fresh alpha scent fill the air.”
story of an alpha and an omega. This was how most of those stories went. The omega sees an alpha and falls in love, the alpha slowly realizes that and finally accepts the omega and they have wonderful and magical sex together.
Steve flushed a little. “I… I do care about your health. I want to see you happy and healthy, of course.”
“I didn’t want her, Tony, I was trying to push her away.”
“Tony, don’t worry about it. The important thing is that you’re safe now and you’re healing.”
Moving to the kitchen, Howard rubbed his face as he tried to gather his thoughts. Now knowing that his son had been pregnant while fighting in a war, the father felt horrible for just letting Tony go do what he wanted. Tony had willingly fought while knowing his own condition, and it worried Howard to no end what might be going through the omega’s mind after being back home. Who knew what Tony might try next that would put him in harm’s way once more? If he had fought in a war while pregnant, what other stupid ideas could he get in that smart head of his? Tony Stark was math smart. He knew numbers like the back of his hands, could practically do calculus in his sleep. But when it came to common sense in situations that didn’t require math, he often was impulsive and gave little thought to the long term effects. It was his downfall, the stubbornness to jump into action and help someone when he needed to keep himself safe on the sidelines. It just wasn’t in his nature to leave someone who needed help, but in his willingness to help, he often disregarded self preservation.
“Does he have that intense alpha gaze when he’s focused on you?” the mother pressed, not really ever having a conversation like this with her son before.
Tony mostly kept to himself as the days passed by. He merely laid in his bed and stared blankly at walls or the ceiling while talking to his baby. He would say how excited he was to meet the child and all they would do when they were growing up. But Tony had absolutely no clue what he was doing to his baby, and the refusal of food and the neglect to do something about his panic attacks were doing a number on both him and the baby.
When they were finally in position, the Hydra headquarters just barely visible, Tony kept watch with a few other alphas while Colonel Phillips radioed in to the Howling Commandos and Steve that the assault team was ready. It was then only a matter of waiting. The forest was quiet, foggy, cold. Where Tony expected there to be chatter, there was none. No one looking at each other, just at the surrounding forest, waiting, watching, listening. The suspense in the air was so thick, Tony was sure he could cut it with a butter knife. Even the smallest bit of noise from a squirrel or bird caused some of the soldiers to flinch and scare themselves. It wasn’t like Hydra knew they were there, but there were some doubts that they were completely safe within the trees.
“I don’t know how I missed you buying it. It looks very good on you,” Steve complimented, leaning down to kiss Tony’s cheek.
Maria nodded, seemingly satisfied with that answer. “Well, since you seem to be feeling better, think you could handle a shopping trip today? I was going to go with Jarvis to get groceries.”
“You really need to let me set you up with a better system, Honeybear.” a muffled voice was saying from behind the TV setup, as if whomever was speaking had something held in their mouth.
“Tony,” Howard’s voice drifted over. “We’re leaving soon, get ready to go.”
Tony sighed, deciding he wasn’t hungry enough to snack on cereal. “I thought I finally found an alpha I could be with, but then he just goes and kisses that damned beta girl like she was his savior.”
“And drama-free, with any luck. There’s two of my exes here who both love to stir up crap and antagonize me. I’ll be trying to avoid them fully.”
Steve smiled. "Don't worry, you can admit when you're tired. I'll carry you when you do get tired."
“Eh, I’ve shot at you before, you can handle being a test subject for a bullet proof material.” Tony chuckled as he took a drink of his water.
Phillips looked down at the paper he was signing, then sighed and picked it up, carrying it with him as he stepped away from his desk. “I signed more of these condolence letters today than I would care to count… but the name does sound familiar. I’m sorry.”
"I know, I do too. I think celebrating a holiday is the kind of pick-me-up we need."
Tony sighed, shifting closer. “I’m glad the others don’t mind us. Some time together like this is nice. Especially before a battle.”
“Meatloaf,” Howard replied. “I take it you will be joining me tonight.”
Tony’s heart dropped to his stomach. “Don’t tell me it’s about Steve. Steve’s okay, right?”
The omega responded with a broken moan before clearing his throat and clinging tighter to the alpha, “Won’t know until I try to walk. If I can’t, then I’m more than alright, alpha.”
Steve was gone for good this time.
Tony shrugged. “I don’t care. He took away my freedom that you gave me, and there’s no point in going back to the pharmacy to get my refill. That bottle was supposed to last me for months. If I go back now, they’ll assume I’m a drug addict or something.”
“I’m sure you’ve told me several times, but I won’t be opposed to being told again.” Steve smiled as he shifted to kiss Tony's neck.
With a smile on his face, Tony got up from where he was sitting on his bed and left his drawing supplies, moving over to his closet to pull out the sparkling red outfit. If someone had told him a couple years prior that he’d be wearing fancy omega outfits for parties, Tony would have laughed. But as time had gone on and Tony had stayed by Steve’s side, part of his omega self was starting to enjoy dressing up on the rare occasion, as long as Steve was also there looking as handsome as ever. Otherwise, Tony wasn’t going to dress as nice.
“Hey Steve.” James Rhodes’ voice responded with a laugh, “You do realize I called your personal phone number you gave me, right? I would have been confused if it wasn’t you who picked up. Like, shit, man, the guy gave me a fake number and I wasn’t even trying to get a date out of him when we met at the veteran's pub.” he joked.
If his father didn’t kill him when they got back to London.
The three were silent until they got back to their little camp. Tony couldn’t exactly control his thoughts very well as he helped pack up and get ready to move to the extraction point. It was hard enough not to glance over at his alpha and think of how they missed spending yet another heat together. Sure, the suppressants were working well and keeping his heat at bay, but as soon as they got back to London, Tony was sure that his father would take away the pills, and the poor omega would careen into a heat with him being totally unprepared. It wasn’t the most ideal situation.
“Oh, so are you getting more into omegan fashion then? I know she’s a beta, but you know that a lot of omegas wear clothes that most ladies wear now.”
Cars honked at Steve as he ran into the middle of the road, and he growled at them involuntarily before he started sprinting away. He vaguely recognized where he was at, and Times Square was just up ahead. He ran as fast as he could, then he had to stop. Everything was so unrecognizable. Lights and flashing advertisements blew his mind enough to let several vehicles close him into the space he had halted in.
“I don’t know how you could think I’m a quick releaser. I’m a top alpha, my knot stays long after orgasm.”
Tony shook his head and stood up, hearing the part of the song where Steve would lift up a girl on each of his shoulders. He looked through the curtains and watched. Secretly he wished he was on one of those broad shoulders, but he would never be caught wearing those outfits the dancers wore. Not that they weren't in good fashion, but Tony was not about the skirts and tube tops. He much preferred button up shirts and suspenders. He clearly wasn't a typical omega, nor did he ever plan to be, and it seemed that Steve didn't seem to care about that, luckily for Tony. He could be the omega he had always been, and Steve would accept him just the way he was.
Peggy sighed. “He was an agent of Hydra, the Nazis’ scientific branch. Hydra is led by Johann Schmidt, a man whose power is based off of fantasy and legend. His goals are somewhat similar to Hitler’s, though we think Schmidt might be trying to break away from the Third Reich.”
She gave an unimpressed look. “Must I remind you of just last week with that model from France?”
“A job? I heard something about a promotion, not a new job.”
“Really? You smell strong so I figured you were heavy on the alpha cologne to cover up the smell of alcohol. Plenty of alphas here do that.” Tony turned the lights to a low setting and switched on the soft music that helped make any outside noises from the club seem non-existent. Then he moved over to the bed and sat down, waiting for the alpha to hint at what kind of session he’d prefer.
Steve didn’t respond right away, simply blinking as he processed what Tony had told him. “A baby… Our baby? Biologically?”
“It’s nice that you have your own work space. I know I always like to have a space separate from everything else that I can be creative and not worry about things being in my way.”
Once the two had cleaned up and made themselves look presentable once more, Tony ventured out of the closet and to a more open area, halfway searching for his father while Steve waited a few minutes to leave. They couldn’t risk leaving at the same time and looking
“Oh, now don’t go talking like that. I can sit out here and wait for you,” Maria reassured her son. “Go on, find something nice.”
“Fuck you’re huge. Totally not overcompensating for anything with your giant arms…” he moaned and closed his eyes, “This size natural or was it that serum stuff you claimed to have been given? Because any omega would beg for a cock like this one...shit.”
Steve was confused by the last sentence. He knew about such machines that kept people alive who were diagnosed with polio. If Tony had some how contracted that disease, Steve was going to feel even worse. The idea of leaving his omega and letting him get sick was just about the worst thing Steve could have imagined.
“We are going to set a fire under Johann Schmidt’s ass,” the older man replied, taking a stack of papers from a blonde female agent. “What do you say, Rogers? It’s your map. You think you can wipe Hydra off it?”
“No, no! I’m not leaving for London again yet. But this concerns your heat.” Steve sighed. “You know alphas typically go into rut around the same time their omega has a heat. They line up after the two have been around each other for a while.”
Tony fell silent as he watched Steve’s reaction, or lack thereof. He hoped that he hadn’t made Steve upset, because that would have been two date nights that they ended with sour notes.
“Sounds good. I’ll see you soon.”
They entered Steve’s dressing room with a stumble. Tony stood near the entrance as he watched the alpha pick up a few items and stash them on his belt, then he took off his jacket and threw on his cargo pants. He tucked them into his boots before straightening up.
“Think we already did with that kiss, but I’m not opposed.”
“When’s he coming by?” Tony asked, “Normally he comes with you.”
For several minutes, the couple watched the rain, trying to make sense of the new world they lived in while mourning what they had lost. Their baby, Tony’s parents, Peggy, Bucky, the Howling Commandos, every bit of their old lives was lost to time, and thus they had to make their way in the new world they had been thrust into. It was going to take time to adjust. Steve was already overwhelmed by how much things had changed, but at least they still had each other and their relationship. No matter what came their way, Tony and Steve knew they could make in this new world, as long as they could stand together holding hands in the process.
“Of course not. Nothing says we can’t eat in the car, you know. We don’t have to walk into a burger joint in our fancy tuxedos to show off. We can just hit a drive through.”
“Where is he now?” another commando asked.
Shivering, he let himself imagine what it’d be like to be Steve’s, to share both heat and ruts with him, to, every night before bed, be fucked so raw that the next morning everyone would know what they had done just by how he’d be walking into a lab to work on his latest invention and show up all the alpha scientists at Hydra.
Yawning, he stumbled out of bed and moved at a much slower pace, over to the bathroom to empty his bladder. He then cleaned himself up with a shower and put on fresh clothes before leaving his room. His stomach growled right as he went through the door, and briefly he panicked before realizing that he was just hungry and not about to throw up again.
“Tony,” the blond groaned when his omega shook his hips a little.
It was clear Steve loved Tony suddenly being more awake, because he kissed back with his own growl, pinning Tony down by his shoulders. When they pulled away to breathe, Tony tried growling again. It was a far cry from Steve’s alpha growl, but it was still more prominent than the first time he had tried it out in Czechoslovakia.
“Please, just call me Steve,” the blond alpha said before standing. “Lead the way.”
Obadiah raised his hands and smiled. "Hey, I'm not trying to start anything here. I just thought Tony would like to know who is here, that's all."
Steve tilted his head as he looked the newcomer over. Though he was dirty, and small, he was actually… not that bad looking, though Steve didn't really recognize him until he remembered a recent magazine cover with Tony Stark on it. Blinking, he sat back a little.
Again, the omega nodded, carefully taking the bowl of soup he had been offered. He took a small spoonful into his mouth before he managed a slight chuckle. “You need to go to bed.”
Tony kicked a scrap piece of metal as hard as he could, facing the door when his father stepped in. Howard took one look around the room, then raised an eyebrow at his son.
“Perfect.”
Tony was damned to hell for sure. He felt Steve rumble with his growl, and the moan he produced from feeling that would have put most other omegas to shame. He wasn’t usually this vocal during a heat, but Steve brought out something in him that had waited some 25 odd long years to awaken.
Steve laughed. “Right, I won’t disturb your mechanic.”
“I really wanted bread,” Tony argued. “My stomach isn’t upset right now anyways. I figured I can eat what I wanted.”
“I have to agree with you on this one,” the blond said. “Some quiet before the storm is always nice, but you know things are going to get bad soon.”
Rain began falling as the plane flew over the mountains and returned to London. Somehow Tony had found the ability to cry once more on the plane, and everyone who heard and saw him couldn’t bear to feel the pain saturating the poor omega’s scent. Peggy was lucky she was a beta, because she would have broken down for sure just by Tony’s scent alone. The whole plane was filled with grief-laced scents, and it only made Tony more miserable.
Steve couldn’t really help the slight blush that crossed his cheeks. “I’m sorry about all that happened to you. I tried to save you sooner, but…”
“The whole world is interested in me in one way or the other. It’ll be more that I’m interested in you.” Tony smiled, tilting his head back in anticipation of a kiss on the dance floor.
Steve nodded. "Yeah, everything went good. Crowd loved when I lifted the girls on my shoulders."
“I only adjusted what I told you so that I wouldn’t have to hunt you down and drag you up here by your ear again.” She said simply.
“I’m sure you’ll at least want to hold him.” Looking over her shoulder, Peggy saw the shadow of Tony’s figure cast across the door frame to the room she and Steve were in. She cleared her throat and smiled when the omega came into view.
“Yeah. most are just fun things for myself in this lab. I keep most of my Stark Industries work in the development lab where my employed engineers can do their part more easily. But I can bring up the files in here where it’s less likely that we’d end up in the way of hard workers.
“That’s the hope.” Tony said, moving over to plop himself back down into Steve’s lap.
“Fuck me, alpha,” Tony demanded, squeezing his legs around Steve tighter, and he got exactly what he wanted as soon as the words were out of his mouth.
Tony sighed, “I know Dad wanted me to mate with Justin, and you wanted me to mate with Ty, but both those guys really were not good at treating me right. Steve does.”
“Come in, this is Captain rogers, do you read me?!”
“Some of my clothes may be a bit big on you, but I think the right pair of pants and the right top will make you look like the world’s most attractive omega.”
“I do want to fight, and I’m going to,” Tony said, a hint of a growl underneath his voice. “I’m doing my duty to America. How can you tell me no after knowing what I’m fighting for?”
“Yes, my date. Not just for tonight, either. We’ve been courting properly. And no, I’m not going to dance with you if your plan is to hand me off to your boss because he’s actually the one wanting to dance with me, but he knows I’d sooner knee his groin than accept a dance invite from him.” Tony huffed.
“It’s rare, but when we got a day off that didn’t include suffering a heat alone, we got to go out and do some shopping or any other approved for omegas activities. Being out meant we would get to get our own food that day and not have to eat the strict healthy diets that the boss fed us the rest of the time.” Tony explained, “I get so tired of chicken salad and tomato soup… Would it be so hard to give us a nice donut once in a while?”
