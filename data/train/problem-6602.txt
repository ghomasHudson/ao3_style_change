Steve turns back to the three pups huddled on the bed and slowly makes his way toward them. The oldest growls and tries to keep his siblings away from the strange omega coming toward them. It’s painful to witness his children so afraid of him and for them to not recognize who he is.
“You did...well.”
“What’s wrong?”
“Is he okay? What’s wrong?” Tony asks, his voice laced with concern. He places his hand over the bump, feeling the strong pressure against his palm.
“We’re...shut up. Just be thankful that I actually like someone you brought home. Usually they’re sleazy.”
“None for me, thanks,” Tony tells her when she begins to pour herself a glass.
But she doesn’t yell or beat him like he knows he deserves. He doesn’t want to accuse her of turning soft because that would definitely result in a beating.
The nightmares never stop. Some nights they’re not as intense, but other nights, this like one, are when they are at their worst.
Don’t worry I swear Flash will come around 😊
Peter gasps and his tears immediately dry up. “Me! I get to be Captain America!”
By the time Tony gets downstairs, he’s not surprised to find Alexander Pierce waiting for him in the lobby. For once he’s not surrounded by his two big goons. The smile Alexander greets him with is still uncomfortable, but Tony pushes that aside.
“His name was Steve Rogers. You know...Captain America…”
“What’s that?” Tony asks, pulling away slightly so their eyes can meet.
“Alpha wants to see you.”
Tony wraps an arm around Steve and brings him close, then he presses his lips to his head. “I love you.”
Peter is both relieved and terrified.
“Exactly. What if I had been successful? What if the serum couldn’t bring me back?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Don’t look at me like that. I’m the cool uncle. Don’t listen to whatever Sam says. And I think I’m the coolest godfather too…” Bucky trails off, sending a glance Steve’s way to confirm.
“Sorry,” Steve quickly apologizes. “I just needed a minute.”
Bucky storms off. No one goes after him, knowing he needed some time to calm down.
Peter frowns at his own words. Of course his dad liked him. He was his son. A father was supposed to love their son. His dad was just scared. Tony had said it himself that he was unsure of what to do and how to act. Peter just had to give him the benefit of the doubt.
“That was hours ago!”
Steve’s legs are forced open and the alpha crawls between them, pressing Steve deeper into the mattress. Pierce’s lips are on him again, his tongue forcefully making his way into Steve’s mouth. The omega fights back, using his strength to push the alpha away.
“Guess who’s spending the weekend cleaning? You are, little man,” Tony tells his son.
Peter shakes his head and reaches for the glasses, ready to take them off. “Dad, I don’t like this.”
“Is he okay?” The beta asks. Tony nods and plops down in the empty seat he had been occupying earlier. He’s used to this space belonging to Happy while he occupies a seat in the middle of the jet and enjoys a glass of whiskey. That seat now has a scared and pregnant omega sitting in it.
“Oh shit.” Tony winces. He had forgotten that Steve’s caffeine intake was limited now. “I’ll still trade you.”
Haha poor Happy.
“You sure? Darling, don’t rush because of me. I can wait.”
“What about the omega?” Rollins asks. This captures Tony’s attention and he glances at Pierce, his stomach coiling at the smirk the alpha wears.
“Hi, Maguna,” Tony coos. His daughter’s eyes open and lock with his own. “Daddy’s here, sweetheart. I’m here.”
Peter nods and wipes at his eyes. “Thank you. I love it. I’ll keep it with me all the time.”
“Yes you do. Look how wet you’re getting.”
“You could never do that. Maybe one more night? I’ve just got a lot on my mind and you being here helps.”
“Pep, please!” Tony grows frustrated. He takes a deep breath to calm himself. “I’m sorry. Just please reschedule for me. Tell him I’m away and I’ll contact him later. Don’t interact with him after this.”
“Hey, look at me.” Steve doesn’t and Tony sighs. “Honey, it’s not your fault. I don’t blame you.”
“Wait, wait.” Steve pulls away and his eyes flicker down to the bump between them. “The baby…” he places a hand over Tony’s belly.
But then the scene changes and Tony is there. He’s beaten and bruised, broken down and crumpled on the floor. Steve almost doesn’t recognize the strong alpha he knew Tony to be. And then there’s the painful cries of his son.
“That’s cold.” Sam frowns before following Bucky to the front door.
“You’re so perfect,” Tony whispers and gently runs his finger along Steve’s swollen lips. He parts them even further, taking Tony’s finger into his mouth and sucking softly. Tony’s breath hitches in his throat and his cock twitches with arousal. He had wanted to take it soft and slow, but now he had the sudden urge to fuck Steve into the bed. “Fuck, honey,” Tony moans.
“I know. I trust you.” Steve smiles and leans up, cupping Tony’s face again and bringing him in for another kiss.
“I know it’s...a little much.” Tony waves a hand in the air, growing awkward when Steve frowns and glances around the large space. “Make yourself at home. I’m just gonna get the bags from Happy and...yeah.”
Happy doesn’t appear convinced but he has no choice but to trust that Steve was right. “If you say so,” he says, then pulls out of the driveway and speeds off toward the road.
“I guess. At least you don’t have to do this. This was the plan all along right? You get to stay buff while I blow up.”
Happy goes ignored.
“Before Wilson? I must be special.”
I just want to say thank you for all the lovely comments, kudos and for reading this story. It means so much!
Tony scoffs but doesn’t add anything else. Steve smiles softly and takes his hand once the exam starts. It’s mostly nothing but questions about Tony’s medical history followed up by a physical exam. Steve can’t help but wince while he watches Tony get poked and prodded; it reminds him of the days when he was constantly being looked over by doctors. His stomach is queasy again.
Steve’s oblivious to it. He believes the tears are for their loss. A part of it is, but the rest is the guilt. This was Tony’s fault.
But there was hope of a future. There was a promise of a life without abuse and hurt. He would finally be free from Hydra’s cold hands. There would be no more days locked away while he wondered what was going to be done to him. That cruel alpha was gone now and in his place arose one that made Steve feel safe, cared for. Maybe even loved.
Steve hasn’t stopped looking at his son since he was placed in his arms for the first time. It still hasn’t sunk in that he had just given birth. The proof was right in front of him, but yet he still struggled to fully comprehend it.
“Yeah. Me too.” Tony smiles and rubs the bump lovingly. The idea of becoming a father was still terrifying and in all honesty Tony didn't know how he was going to do it. But at the same time he was excited to meet the little boy that was transforming his life.
“So then why am I here?” Bruce frowns.
“Hi, Tony,” Steve greets, his tone sounds unsure. The other night was still something they refused to talk about. Both were too stubborn to bring up the kiss that almost happened.
She’s not so fast this time around and he’s left taking care of the fussy newborn. Steve takes Peter into his arms, immediately checking for a wet diaper, and when he’s met with one, he sighs and gets out of bed. He makes the small trip down the hall to the nursery and gets to work on getting Peter changed.
Tony does his best to make up for forgetting about Valentine’s Day. Steve honestly can’t blame him for letting the holiday slip his mind. Their lives were always chaotic and Tony was often down in his lab fixing broken suits or offering upgrades for his teammates, completely getting lost in his headspace. It’s a miracle Tony even remembers to get dressed in the morning.
“I’ve said too much or not enough or…”
He knew it was a mistake letting Steve go on a mission. He didn’t care if it was important or if the team needed him; it was all excuses for Steve to go. The team would have been just fine without him and no mission was more important than Steve.
He waves Happy over.
“How is he?” Bruce is the first to ask.
“I uh...wanted to meet you.” Peter is finally able to get out. He cringes at his own words. This wasn’t going well.
Steve glances up at his mate, ready to apologize for coming on too strong. Tony had assured him that he wanted to take the pups in and raise them as his own, but Steve still can’t help but fear that he’s said something wrong.
He stops when he gets to one that has Steve in it. Peter looks to be about 8 years old. His tiny arms are wrapped around Steve’s neck while they both smile for the picture. It’s the smile on Steve’s face that Tony notices a little bit more. He looked so happy.
“I never said that. He can stay here until we figure it out. But first I have to talk to Mr. Pierce.”
“I just do. He’s an alpha.”
“-but you’re changing and working at becoming a better person. Peter recognizes your efforts and the rest of the team will too.”
“Wait until you see what he has.” The way Tony winks has Steve growing suspicious again, and he just knows their night was not going to be simple.
The voice is back, forcing Steve to stop in his tracks and pause his dinner preparations. He grips the knife in his hand tightly, taking deep breaths to calm himself. He wasn’t going to listen. That voice was wrong.
Tony squeezes his eyes shut when more tears threaten to fall. His heart aches for his son. “I’m sorry. I never should’ve let you do that. It was a mistake.”
Tony doesn’t really deserve any chances...well, I don’t know. He definitely needs to earn Peter’s trust and it’s going to take a lot of work on his part.
The doctor catches on quickly and she helps remove the clothes from his lower half, then she settles between his spread legs. He hears a gasp from beside him; it’s one of the nurses. Her surprised reaction has Steve opening his eyes and glancing down, panic setting in at the sight of the blood between his legs.
“I know.”
“Hey, you two need to learn to get along. You’re brothers and sometimes yes you fight, but at the end of the day you’re all you guys have. It’s important to stick together.”
But this doctor was telling him something different. Maybe he wasn’t a bad mother after all.
Maybe there was time to make it right.
“Oh my God.” Tony breathes out. His gaze snaps up to Steve’s face at the scream he produces. Tony can’t help but wince at the sound. “I know. Just push. I can see the head.”
The team was supposed to return in a couple of days. Peter felt confident that he could take care of himself until their return, but it wasn’t being unsupervised that had him so on edge. He needed his family to come back. They were all he had left.
“What he did to you wasn’t your fault. You didn’t say it out loud but I know inside you’re blaming yourself and asking why this happened to you. I wish I could tell you why but unfortunately I don’t have the answers. What I can tell you is that you’re innocent. You’re not at fault here, Steve. And I know right now it doesn’t feel that way, but one day it will. He didn’t rob you completely okay? You’re still you. Maybe even better than before. Definitely stronger. You can overcome this. I promise.”
“Is this you being nice or your way of keeping me here to help when your son starts crying?” Bruce teases.
“Forget it. Can we...start over? The last meetups have been…”
“Actually, can I stay a little longer? I can tell them Ned invited me to stay over or something.”
“Back up, kid. Mr. Stark isn’t doing autographs,” the man says.
“Tony?”
“Take all the time you need. Pretty soon this room is going to be full of rowdy Avengers demanding they hold the baby. Fights are going to break out. My money is on Widow.”
“I...I need you to come back.”
Well Steve is doing better and now he can come out from hiding and live his best life. There's only one chapter left but I do have plans for a sequel. They need to live a happy life and have another pup, remember? ;)
“I just didn’t think I could have this. I think that’s why when something was off I didn’t think it would be because of him.”
Steve smiles back. “Hi.”
“I’m kind of jealous. I couldn’t even get a compliment out of my old man.”
He just wanted to be left alone so he could think and plan and then think again. He could figure this out. He was smart enough.
“He really didn’t,” Tony adds, his brows still furrowed as he looks over the picture again. He finally hands it back to his son. “So how do you feel?”
Tony rips his fingers free at the last second and Steve cries out in frustration.
“Sarah,” Steve whispers. She’s too little to understand, but the sound of his voice has her lifting her head and settling her blue eyes on his face. He smiles and moves toward the bed. This time James doesn’t protest.
Peter glances at his dad, hating the big ugly bruise decorating his left cheek. The blood from the wound flows steadily down his face, droplets of red forming on the nice button up Tony had worn for the occasion. He wonders how his papa would have acted if he had been there. Peter knows exactly how. It’s what he plans on doing now.
Sarah was quiet and liked to keep to herself. She enjoyed playing with the new toys daddy had gotten her. She only loses her temper when her older brothers try to intervene. That’s when she became feisty. Definitely a Rogers trait.
“I’m sorry,” Steve whispers to their son as he continues to stroke the baby’s cheek. The tears haven’t stopped since they both discovered that their son had died in the womb.
Tony rolls his eyes and goes in search of the first aid kit. He returns to find Steve already drifting off to sleep.
Steve chuckles. “I guess I did. Make sure to tell your dad about it when he gets home. Which should be-” Steve pauses to glance at his watch. He frowns. “Honestly, with him it’s hard to say.”
Steve chokes back sob and brings his son closer, quietly shushing him when the baby’s face scrunches up and he whimpers. The nurse lingers around for a moment to make sure the new parents are comfortable, then she excuses herself and quietly shuts the door behind her.
“No, you need to go. I’ll be fine. Morgan and I can...I don’t know. We’ll figure it out.”
“Good.” Tony pats Happy on the shoulder, then he heads toward the elevator. “Don’t freak him out!” he makes sure to call out before the doors close.
“Okay,” Bruce types away on his laptop. “Have you been active recently?”
Tony frowns. “For what? You haven’t done anything."
“Please? The doctor said everything’s okay,” Steve argues. He wasn’t going to back down.
“Will do.”
“He’s okay. Our son is going to be fine.”
Steve is left to watch as his mate is thrown into the backseat of the SUV before a sack is placed over his own head and he’s given the same treatment.
Tony makes sure to give Flash one last look before leaving the room.
“Get up!” Brock orders.
Steve sniffs the air, growing more and more uncomfortable by the second. It wasn’t just the three new people that were throwing him off. The whole room was filled with a team. A mixture of alphas, betas, and omegas.
Bucky sniffs and places out a hand to touch the casket. “I’m gonna miss you, pal. Till the end of the line.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s my choice, Tony,” Steve says, and dammit he’s right. It is his choice. No one gets the final say but him.
It’s set up in the middle of the room, almost as if it was done on purpose. Like it’s meant to be the first thing Tony sees.
“Do you regret anything else?”
Steve complies easily until his son is cheering from being up so high. Steve brings him back down and hugs him close, then he kisses his son on the head.
Peter doesn’t respond and instead tries to slip out of the bathroom. But he’s not that lucky and Flash is stopping him, the hand on his shoulder tightening
Tony responds by sucking and biting down on the sensitive flesh, desperate to hear those noises again. Steve rewards him with more. His hand trails between them, down Tony’s chest and torso until it's hovering over Tony’s crotch.
“Pete,” Steve says softy, his heart shattering at the sobs his son makes. Peter refuses to look at him, keeping his eyes on his lap. “Pete, look at me.”
“If you want you can sleep some more.”
With Steve tied down, Tony works on removing the tie still around Steve’s neck and carefully placing it over Steve’s eyes and tying it tight. Steve gasps and writhes in his restraints.
“Yes, but not because of you. Steve, I swear I’d never turn you in. I’d never hurt you again.”
Tony inhales sharply and glances at the elevator doors, wishing they’d open and save him from the difficult questions.
“Pep, let’s talk okay? Give me five minutes alone with him. Please?”
Steve sighs harshly. “Maybe he can help. I know it’s crazy but they’re his weapons. The least he could do is help us.”
“It’s okay, kiddo,” Tony assures and Peter rushes to him, wrapping his arms around Tony’s body and holding him close. “This is my fault. I’m sorry for causing more pain. I never meant-”
Steve frowns. Tony can practically see the gears turning in his head. “No, sorry.”
The room fills with Steve’s voice.
“Eat,” the alpha instructs. He takes the seat opposite of the omega and brings the glass to his lips, grinning behind the rim. “I can assure you that this isn’t some kind of trick. It’s a celebration. You’re carrying the next generation of Hydra.”
He finds none of those things upon entering the kitchen space. He frowns, brows wrinkling in confusion as he wonders where the alpha had gone. There’s no note or any sign of his presence. It’s a little unnerving.
Peter jumps at the disembodied voice and glances around the room, eyes wide and full of confusion. “What the hell…”
I took a day off...sort of. I helped my son with school and then rested when I could. I had some of this chapter complete and then forced myself to finish it and now here it is!
“I know what your name is. Tony told me about you.”
“Are we talking about Steve or-”
Steve silences him with a kiss. They break apart and Steve leans forward to rest their foreheads together. “I promise. No more missions. I’ll hang up the shield.”
“It’s fine.”
She lacked superhuman strength like her papa and brother, but she wasn’t about to complain about drawing the shortest stick. She had the brains like her dad, and maybe one day she would be wearing a suit of armor like him.
“Need help?” A familiar voice reaches Steve’s ears and he snaps his head up. Tony is lingering in the doorway of the bedroom, an amused grin plastered over his face.
“There’s plenty of other doctors in New York.”
Sam looks like he wants to question him again, but instead he drops it and together they enter the jet.
“Yeah.” Steve nods. “Thank you. It really helped.”
A part of Tony wants to tell her everything he knew so far, but he stops himself. He starts to listen to what she’s saying. Maybe she was right. Maybe it was a lie Steve fabricated to get money and a moment in the spotlight. The story Steve had told him was insane. Was that all a lie too? Was it just a reason for Tony to feel sorry for him and give him anything he wanted?
The man points his gun, but Steve doesn’t give him a chance to pull the trigger. He grips the man’s wrist and twists, breaking the bones and forcing the gun from the damaged hand and onto the floor. Steve brings him down to the ground hard, the man’s head hitting the hard surface with an audible crack.
Between the process of signing over his company and taking care of any business that needs his attention, there is barely any time for Tony to work on the preparations for the nursery. The last thing Tony wanted was to plan another trip out to New York to build the room, so with whatever time he does have, it goes to Peter’s room.
“Are you happy?”
“But my rut-soon it will be worse and...you know what will happen when I can’t stop.”
“Even before that.”
Steve sighs and tips his head back, letting it rest on the edge of the bed. “You’re not talking about my hand, are you?”
“There’s nothing to be afraid of. No one’s going to hurt you anymore.”
Steve scoffs and peers down at his son when Peter squirms. He calms him down again, running his finger soothingly along his face. “We tried,” Steve says. “It didn’t work. It never works.”
With a sigh of defeat Steve allows himself to be led away.
“I think that’s enough,” Nick interrupts. He too notices how uncomfortable the omega has gotten. He rises to his feet and Maria joins him. “You’re free to go. I’m sure your pups need you.”
“Fine, Fine. Thanks, Pep,” Tony sends her a smile, then he leaves the large office.
“I’ll do it,” Pepper says and she rises to her feet. She walks toward the door, then she turns around to face him. “Be careful, Tony.”
“Or maybe it was because of the cute doctor. I know you like short brunettes.”
“Really? What about the others?” Peter’s eyes flicker in the direction of the many suits lining the walls. “What about those?”
Peter gasps, brown eyes going wide. “Why! Was the baby sick? Is the baby better now?”
Peter’s brows furrow and his stomach coils. For a second he wonders if Flash knows, but then he realizes Flash is referring to the party.
“Why did you wake me up?”
“Yeah.” Steve rises to his feet, deciding he’s had enough of the conversation. God knows they’ll only be having another one just like it tomorrow. “I’m going to lie down for a bit.”
“Fine, I guess. My hubby over here…” Tony gestures with his chin in Steve’s direction.
“Whoa!” Peter cries at the sight of his daddy’s appearance. “You look just like papa!”
“No! No, he’s not here. He’s gone. Steve, listen to me. I need you to show me what he looks like.”
“I guess. I just know I’m gonna screw up.”
“Yeah what was up with that? You told me he wouldn’t hit me.”
I really wanted to do a few fluffy chapters before some of the angst comes in. This family deserves some happiness 😊
He’s starting to come to, the realization of what he's just done dawning on him. Tony’s eyes shoot open and he jumps away.
The chance to talk with Tony comes a few minutes before Steve is set to leave for one of his group sessions. Ideally Steve would have preferred them to talk when he wasn’t needed. He loved talking and hearing the omega’s that needed him, but it was obvious his mate needed him too.
“Right now it’s the cut on my face,” Steve points at the large gash running down the side of his head. “It’s okay. I’ll be brand new in the morning.”
The bell rings and he’s thankful it saves him from the awkwardness between them.
“Huh? Yeah, I guess.”
“I love you, mama,” James smiles and places a big, wet kiss to Steve’s cheek.
He has to act quickly. Every day the baby was growing stronger, and so was Steve’s love for it. Tony wanted so badly to feel the same thing or even something for the child they created, but all he feels is fear and regret. He wishes they had been more careful. This could have easily been prevented.
I just want to say thank you for all of the lovely comments. I know this story is rough and probably not what you’re expecting, but I want to thank you all for pushing through this with me. The support means a lot ❤️❤️❤️
“Yeah?”
“I like it but he still needs a middle name.”
Steve picks himself back up just like Tony knew he would. He gets back into a normal routine and even attends briefings and leads missions. He smiles again and doesn’t hide away anymore. But deep down that ache was still there.
Tears gather in Peter’s eyes, momentarily blurring the two lines staring back at him, but when he blinks and clears the tears away, the results are clear and bringing more tears and a choked sob. He grips the test tightly and sits down on the closed lid of the toilet, his body hunching forward and the sobs wrack through him.
“Let me...please…” Steve begs, making a point to pull on the cuffs.
“The B word? You mean the baby? The baby that you two are having? That B word?”
“I know. But...I can’t help it. I don’t want to leave and then it upsets you or Uncle Bucky.”
If he could have it his way, he wouldn’t participate in anymore missions. His son was his main priority now. The missions, being Iron man. None of it mattered anymore. Peter came first.
“I always remember to breathe. Do you want to try?”
“Ah yes! It will help your child sleep. One drop of this before bed and he’ll be out like a light,” Thor explains, smiling proudly at his gift.
“We’ll tell them.”
Tony smiles and reaches out to pet Dodger. “Yeah, I guess I did get some practice.”
The silence that lingers over them is heavy and uncomfortable. Ever since that confrontation between them things had changed. Tony was distant, and Steve blames himself.
It takes a moment for Tony to lift his head in Steve’s direction, and when he does, his heart breaks at the sight. Steve is crying, his body shaking with each painful sob. He struggles to pull his pants up, emitting a whimper from the pain the motion brings. He curls up, making himself as small as possible, his back facing Tony.
Not much has been said about Tony’s surprising return. It was obvious the team wanted to sit down and talk about it, but finding the time was difficult. Sam’s injury was on everyone’s mind and their main priority. But it wasn’t the only reason for the delayed discussion. Talking about Tony wasn’t easy.
“You won’t leave me.”
“Shit!” Tony cries out in surprise and leaps up from the couch.
Tony walked towards them, circling around the man and woman until he was between them and Steve.  He shot Steve a questioning look, which Steve took to ask whether he was alright or not.  He nodded, and Tony turned back to Lady Bain and her companion.
” Tony said, mimicking Cam’s high-pitched, excited voice.  Steve burst out laughing, his shoulders shaking with mirth.  “You should hear him when you aren’t around. He’s full of stories about you. To hear him tell it, you routinely sing my praises, pine for my presence, and are virtually inconsolable when my duties take me away from you.  You do, I assume, regularly cry into your pillow at my absence, do you not? I thought so,” he said with a nod, a smile dancing over his features. “Young Cam is the cleverest of us all, I do believe,” he added, chewing a bit on the inside of his cheek.
Steve knew he should be asking questions.  Get the business part on the table.  How do you want to arrange payment?  What are your expectations?  When was the last time you were tested and what were the results?  Those were the proper types of questions to be asking.  What he really wanted to know, however, was what are you going to ask me to do? Will it be something I can be okay with?  If I don’t want to, what happens?  What if I mess up and it isn’t good?  Of course, he couldn’t really ask these questions.  Tony had no idea this was his first time doing something like this.  He expected someone who knew the gig, not some nervous schoolboy.  Tucking and rolling was looking more and more like a viable option.  Clamping down on his anxiety, Steve stared fixedly at the window as the miles passed by.
“Love you too, Shellhead,” Steve said fondly, curving a hand around Tony’s neck and patting softly. He aimed for romantic or at least reassuring, but it actually came out too sleepy for either.  He groaned a little as Tony pulled out of him.  It felt weird.  Empty.  He rolled to his side and watched Tony walk to the bathroom and return with a towel, carefully, almost reverentially wiping Steve down, earning a raised eyebrow when Steve’s cock started paying attention. Steve just shrugged and yawned widely.  Tony grinned wickedly and cast the towel aside, climbing back into bed with Steve and wrapping an arm around him, pressing light kisses to his shoulders and back.  Steve sighed and turned his head enough to capture Tony’s mouth for a lazy kiss.  He was asleep before he could manage to do anything else.
Tony looked…hurt. By Steve.  By…by Steve not coming home last night.  By Steve being with someone else.  That had hurt Tony in some indefinable way that had honestly never even occurred to Steve.  And if it had, he would have discarded it as wishful thinking or delusion.  But it was right there in high-definition, thanks to Tony’s paranoia and lack of any sense of boundaries.
“They took you from me.  They took you, and I couldn’t find you,” Steve husked out.  The hand on Tony’s neck flexed, not hard, not really, but hard enough Tony could feel the power there.  He leaned into it, feeling Steve’s thumb rub soothingly against the pulse point there.  “Three months.  Three months.  I couldn’t eat.  I couldn’t sleep.  All I could think about was if you were hurt.  Or scared.  Or—“ he stopped, looked away.  One hand dropped to his leg, rubbing at the top of his thigh.  Tony covered Steve’s hand with his own, stilling the motion, then locking his fingers between Steve’s.
“Motor,” Tony explained.
Steve nodded and watched Tony slide out of his chair and walk away, then pulled out his own phone to check the messages.  Nothing.  Odd, he thought, glancing over at where Tony had his head dipped down to his chest, shoulders hunched and the phone glued to his ear under a neon sign that formed an arrow and pointed to the restrooms.
“Better get a move on then.  Time’s a’wasting,” Steve said.  His voice shook. He wondered if Shellhead could hear it.  Probably. He felt a tentacle brush over his hand. Lightly, barely a touch, but he felt it.  Steve closed his eyes and drew in a hard, cold breath, then moved towards the boat. He didn’t look back, and felt, more than saw, Shellhead come up behind him and grip the other side of the boat.
felt good.  Great, even. Better than he had since before the cave, maybe better than he ever had, he realized.
“General Rhodes went to the port.  I thought you must know this?” Cam said, wide-eyed and innocent-faced.  Steve was fairly sure it was an act.  “He was gone for nearly almost a full week.  Erdé is his chambermaid, so she knows.  She said the King summoned him from his dinner one night and sent him off,” Cam replied.

Shellhead frowned, opened his mouth, then looked down and clutched at his blue stone necklace. His hand seemed to almost reflexively open and close around it, but he finally dragged his gaze back up to Steve and sighed, sounding a bit frustrated, before he seemed to force himself to relax, his eyes going soft and crinkling at the corners.  He patted Steve’s hand, stroking his knuckles almost absently against the skin there. They hadn’t, not since that night, of course. It had been a one-time thing, Steve knew. Him leaving, the rum, the rush of finishing the
“I just, I literally cannot,” Pepper said, holding her hands in a stop-motion, though she took a plate and piled it high with food before taking a seat at the dining table with a long-suffering sigh.
“I don’t think you have any idea how important this is to me,” Tony said quietly as he looked up at Steve.  “Now, go.  Enjoy the water.  I’m fine, really,” Tony promised at Steve’s skeptical look.  “Just going to get some work done.”
Happy hurried to shoo the tourists away and held the door open for Steve and Tony.  Steve held out his hand, and Tony took it as he crawled out, then didn’t let go because that was what couples did. He felt Steve give his hand a squeeze, and he looked up and caught Steve’s eye.  Steve leaned his head down and sort of nudged at Tony’s cheek.  Not quite a kiss, but somehow even more intimate than any kiss Tony had ever experienced.
Tony turned around and reached a hand out to wrap it around the edge of the front door.  One of the few changes.  Out of necessity, he thought, with a small, wistful smile as he remembered Steve propping the poor, splintered door parts against the frame the morning after their first time.   Steve found a serviceable replacement door at the local home improvement store.  This one, though. This one was dark oak, elaborately carved with floral swirls wrapping around pheasants, deer, and, at the top, two frolicking squirrels and a stack of acorns, which had sealed the deal.
A loud pounding noise woke him, and he looked up to see a bleary-eyed Clint padding out of his room.  Clint went to the kitchen and opened the refrigerator, which, unsurprisingly, did little to stop the pounding, so Steve pushed himself off the sofa and went to answer the door.  He stared in something like wonder at the tall, African-American man dressed head to toe in black and sporting an eyepatch over one eye.  “Um, can I help you?” Steve asked cautiously.
“Fine,” Matt acquiesced after a moment.  “I don’t like it, but fine.  I want approval on whatever you’re going to say, though.  Just stick to the script.”
“After before, when you nodded your head, then entirely ignored our advice and did the completely awesome thing with the press where it somehow made it sound like I was the knight in shining armor they should be nice to here?  Yeah, you know, going out on a limb…I’m really okay with the risk,” Tony replied with a half-smile. “Anyway, Pepper says we need to get in front of this, and Matt’s onboard, if we stay on point, which, I’d normally say is directed at me, but you’re a wild card, so, there could be a tranq-gun involved.  I’m not sure, but I feel the need to mention the possibility. Don’t worry, he’s surprisingly accurate for a blind guy,” Tony said with a grin while Steve puffed out a short laugh.

“Yes,” Tony said with a short nod.  He looked up at Steve, who gave him a small, encouraging smile in return.  “That sounds…are you using gravitational radiation?”
“Ah. Fine. I guess—“ Steve started.
, he admonished himself.
“You do help, Tony,” Steve said gently with a sort of crooked half-smile that was almost sad.  “More than you can imagine.”
Just one of those space things.
beautiful when Steve looked at him.  He supposed maybe that was what made it true.
“Not you,” Kirk said, sitting up more and holding Steve’s eye.  “You’re not, are you?  You’re like…what’s the word I’m looking for…nice,” he finally settled on, pursing his lips around the word as if it tasted bad.  “Ugh, you are.  You’re all,” Kirk waved a hand at Steve.  “Nice and good and shit.”
.  What is it that you want?  Hmmm?” Tony cut in sharply.  He leaned his hands on the table, splaying his fingers and rocked forward, closing his eyes for a moment before turning his head to look at Steve. “Tell me. What do you want that I have not already given you?  That is why you are here, is it not? Finally figured it out, did you?  Well. Out with it.  What is it? What is it that you want so very badly that you come here like this?  Speak it. This thing that you want,” Tony sneered, nearly vibrating with the effort to keep his anger contained.
Tony stared at him a moment, lifted his glass to his mouth and swirled the liquid around a bit, then took a long drink.  “You’re...more interesting than you should be,” Tony said, eyes narrowing, smacking his lips a bit as he set his glass down.  “It’s currently hovering somewhere between annoying and insanely intriguing.”
, Tony!  Why is it so hard?”
“Thought you were headed to bed,” Steve said, looking up at him with a sharp, surprised look.
“There is absolutely nothing about this game that makes sense,” Steve protested when he lost again.  He sat down heavily on the stool next to Tony, a deep furrow appearing in the center of his brow.  He was worrying at his bottom lip with his teeth again, something he did when he was thinking, Tony had noticed.  Noticed because he’d been staring again, sure, but, in all fairness, only because he was awake.  Tony sighed and rubbed a hand over his face, closing his eyes behind it.  When he opened them again, he promptly wished he hadn’t.
He drew back enough to tongue the slit, licking the pre-come as it dripped, before swirling his tongue around the head and then swallowing Tony whole, feeling his nose press against the springy hair below Tony’s navel, the tip of Tony’s cock hitting the back of his throat as he moved up and down.
, his mind urged, throbbing with an almost overwhelming insistence. Which, he couldn’t do, of course. Not with Ross and the entirety of the global security forces on the hunt for him.  Steve sighed and tossed his keys down on the counter by the sink, then pulled a bottle of beer out of what the landlord, spitting a wad of something onto the gravel by the door, had told him was a cooling box in such a thick Irish accent, Steve had barely been able to decipher the garbled words as English, and sat down on the narrow bed that was shoved against the far wall and acted as the room’s sole piece of furniture.  The laptop was stashed in a hollowed space between two water pipes that served the small toilet on the other side of the wall, behind what had quickly become a loose concrete block just under the bedframe.  He didn’t reach for it right away, just sat and sipped his beer, staring at the yellowed window above the kitchen sink where the towel that served as a curtain was pulled back at one corner just enough for Steve to see anyone who might be bold enough or stupid enough to try the front door. He nudged his boot at the floor and clasped the bottle between his hands in his lap, then glanced over at the newspaper spread out on the end of the bed.
Tony looked away again, his eyes scanning the rocks, seeing nothing, Steve was sure. Steve studied Tony, his heartbeat pounding in his ears to the rhythm of the water falling next to them. He knew what he was going to say before the words left his mouth. He wasn’t sure he could stop himself, even if he wanted to, and he didn’t want to.
Picking his swim trunks up off the floor, Steve laid them out on a chair on the balcony and left the suit from the night before in the same clothes bag that had covered the outfit he wore now--simple slacks and a blue knit shirt, though they both fit incredibly well and had labels that Steve recognized, but had certainly never been anywhere near his closet.
“’Bout six,” a voice called out from the apartment behind him.
,” Brock laughed, shaking his head with an incredulous expression.  “A million dollars and he has to be reminded.  You believe this guy?” he asked the silent room. “Come one, up and at ‘em,” he added, pushing himself up off the futon.  “Remember, the guys are coming over tonight.  After that, how about you and I give that whole taking it slow thing a shot, huh?”
Joking and teasing where the punchline was acceptance.  Arguments and debates where the outcome was compromise.  Someone who paid attention to him, who saw him, in ways he’d tried for so long not to allow to be seen.  Who saw those things and pushed for more?  When had anyone asked Tony to be more of himself?  It was almost too much to comprehend, somehow far more difficult to fathom than gravitational waves.
“Worth a shot, I guess, right?” Steve replied with a casual shrug of his shoulders. Tony could practically hear the inner monologue of don't get your hopes up in Steve's tight voice and the way he suddenly seemed fascinated with the contents of Tony's desktop, but what was there to say about it? Sorry you almost got blown up? Could've been worse. Look at Barnes. Though, there was something to be said for losing something entirely versus having just enough of something to still feel close enough to it that it hurt every time you got near to having it.
Since that seemed to be a dismissal if Steve had ever heard one, he headed for the door. This time, he didn’t look back. He felt better, though. Not perfect. It wasn’t as if one incredible night erased everything. But, better. He wasn’t sure he could articulate why, he just knew it was true. When he got back to the Tower, he slept for eight hours straight, and managed to make it down to dinner with the team.
Tony shifted slightly, wrapping his legs around Steve’s waist. That earned him a soft sigh.  One of Steve’s hands found Tony’s nipple and toyed with it, almost absently, through the gown, until Steve bent his head and sucked the hardened peak into his mouth through the silk, making Tony moan, then pulled back his head and smiled at Tony, that sweet, sloe-eyed, lopsided grin that Tony adored.
He followed. A curtain of green hung in front of them as lattice-work vines twisted up and down between the earth and trees.  There was a small opening at the edge, where it looked like the others must have passed this way, even if not recently. Tony pushed the vines aside and held them for Steve to pass through.
“Jesus Christ,” Stane said, kneeling there on the dock, splattered with water, one hand running back and forth over the smooth plate of his head.  “Jesus
“Do you want me to tell you that he changed?  That one guy went into that cave and someone else came out?  That’s not how it works, son,” Steve said, his voice going louder.  “People don’t suddenly become other people in a crisis. Trust me, you only take with you what you already have.  All it does is make you figure out who you are, and Tony’s about the finest man I’ve ever met, only, just like all of you, I couldn’t see it the first time. Maybe he couldn’t, either, but he was always the kind of man I’d be honored to stand up with.  Look, we both got a good, up-close look at just how fragile this life is, and yeah, it made us re-evaluate exactly what was important. So, now, if we want to do something a little crazy, maybe take a chance on something good, is that really so hard to understand?  The guy who met him on that tarmac back in Bagram wouldn’t have done it, true. Maybe none of you fine people would do it. But this is Vegas, and I guess I’m a bit of a gambler,” Steve finished, trying to contain a small, wry smile. He looked over at Tony, who was watching him with a warm, open, almost awestruck expression.  “What can I say? I like my odds.”
“Seventeen more holes of information are coming my way,” Tony proclaimed, balancing his hands on the top of his club like a cane.  “Bring it on.”
He hadn’t seen Steve do anything artistic except paint the increasingly disturbing series of dark swirls that Tony had begun to think of as part of Steve’s Timmy’s In the Well Period, because they looked like a cry for help if Tony had ever seen one, not that he was about to mention that to his Alpha.  But this…this was beautiful.  Surreal and almost sensual, with her blank-faced, human-like form.  Not clunky or functional like his own ‘bots, but smooth, undulating metal forming a single, cohesive body, more like a sculpture than a machine.
, and it was hard to deny that knowledge, even if it flew in the face of all logic, and he had every reason to suspect it.
“Just trying to get a little ahead of things with Stern and all of that,” Tony said.  “Plus, I thought it went pretty well, my press conference track record being what it is. Look on the bright side, at least I didn’t close down another one of SI’s divisions.”
, inkwells and ponytails?  Damn Bruce and his stupid Little House on the Prairie analogies getting all in his head up in that cabin.  At least Steve had seemed to blame the drugs for most of it, Tony thought with a slight jerk of what was trying to be a laugh and failing miserably.
This time, it was Steve that kissed Tony, startling the other man as he pressed his mouth against his, letting his lips part and tongue slip along Tony’s lips, seeking entrance.  Tony let out a groan and opened his mouth, giving Steve all the permission he needed to explore fully, letting his tongue war with Tony’s as they tumbled onto the bed.  He realized this was the first time that he had actually been the one to initiate the kiss.  It was always Tony taking the first step, closing the distance between them.  When Tony pulled back, Steve saw something flicker in the deep brown pools of his eyes, like a switch had been flicked, and then Tony was kissing him again, hands on the sides of his face, moving Steve’s mouth under his.  This time, Tony’s lips were bruising, teeth scraping and biting, leaving Steve’s mouth swollen and sore, sensitive to the slightest swipe of Tony’s tongue.
Tony slumped forward and ran a hand up and down over his face, fidgeting in his seat while he watched the clock tick down towards the time when Steve was due to arrive home. It wasn't like he didn't know that he'd let himself get a tad carried away with his transient bit of freedom. He'd basically approached it in the way that Augustus Gloop handled a chocolate river. Get it while you can and drink down everything you can swallow before you get Oompa-Loompa'd.
“I’m in the middle of a class,” the professor objected.
“So, she came up with a way to get what turned out to be the mind stone out of Vision’s head, which Wanda then kindly blew to smithereens,” Tony finished, spreading his hands wide.  “Yes, there is still the time stone,” he added when Steve opened his mouth to object. “We’re working on it. But, honestly, even a mad Titan is going to think twice about going too far back in time.  You might be ever so slightly familiar with unforeseeable consequences? Yeah, they’re a bitch. Point is, we have a plan. We’re preparing. Iron Legion’s up and running. Ultron is the first line of defense, sure, but we’ve got some surprises up our sleeves if and when Thanos heads this way.”
“Exactly!” Cam exclaimed, clearly pleased. “When you go to the Free States, will you bring Peter, do you think?”
“Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  But, they worked.
To say that Cam was slightly annoyed with him was probably not quite capturing the extent of the boy’s displeasure, Steve thought grimly.  Not that he could blame Cam, not really.  Steve wasn’t unaware of how precarious their lives were, particularly this life, the one where they had their own servants at their beck and call, soft, warm beds and more food than either of them could eat.  The one where they were favored and protected by Tony’s power, and not subject to the ordinary perils of their status.  This life was built on little more than footholds of straw, perhaps even more than Cam realized.
--how they understood each other. After everything they went through over there, Brock was one of the few people who got thatSteve didn’t need to be crowded, for one thing. Didn’t need all that pressure to keep up with people.  Be social.  All that. Sometimes, it was easier if it were just the two of them.  Brock was right about that, even if it annoyed Bucky.  Brock was just trying to look out for him, and sure, Steve knew Bucky was, too, but--but they both just wanted what was best for him, even if they didn’t see eye to eye about what that was.
“We’re not losing both of you to this,” she said, though she was still staring at the displays, as if they held answers.
“I’m just supposed to ignore the punchy-kicky thing, I suppose,” Steve replied with a loose smile.  Tony waffled his head back and forth and took another bite of pasta.  “What do you mean, plan?”
“You’re—hard on yourself,” Steve told him.
“Come here often?” Tony supplied with a low chuckle, waggling his eyebrows in mock suggestiveness.  Steve threw a wadded up napkin at him, hitting him square in the chest and bouncing into Tony’s drink, of course, the bastard.  Tony grappled for his own napkin, balled it up and launched his retaliatory strike at Steve, who shot him a look that clearly said he thought Tony was crazy for continuing that particular game.  Tony grabbed the silver napkin dispenser and dropped it into the booth behind him.  Better safe than sorry, he thought to himself and just shrugged at Steve’s exaggerated eye roll.  “First time.  At least for me.  I think maybe you and the spy bros came a time or two before.  Why?”
, he missed him.  The time his parents forgot his birthday when he was eleven, and he spent it alone in his treehouse.  It had been so cold up there, so very, very cold. All around him, and he ached, it hurt, it hurt so much, even now, when it shouldn’t.  The smell of his mother’s perfume. She put the little glass bottle back down on her vanity next to a picture from his parents’ wedding day, when they were smiling and happy for what Tony could only assume was the last time.  Jarvis, putting a cool cloth on his head when he had a fever.
He wanted more. So much more.
“Congratulate me.  Steve here made me an honest man,” Tony said, drawing Hammer’s shocked gaze to his.  “That’s right.  Tied the knot.  I’m officially off the market.”  As he said it, Tony leaned back on his stool until his shoulder bumped into Steve’s chest.  He groped behind him with one hand and finally managed to wind his arm through Steve’s, tugging Steve’s hand forward to thread their fingers together.  Huh, he thought as he looked down.  He should really see about getting them rings.  Complete the picture and all that.  People would probably notice.
“I used to do a lot of sketching,” Steve told him. “But, I haven’t...for a while. Paints were expensive, so I didn’t, at least until, ah, recently, I didn’t do much of that. The painting is...it’s supposed to help--to help, ah…”
“They’re…awaiting arrest,” Steve said, drawing back and looking slightly over his shoulder, then down at Tony with the most innocent expression this side of—of unicorn whisperers and baby goats.  Steve held out his hand to Tony, who grabbed it and let Steve heft him up, which, whee, that was fun.  God, he was clearly still drugged. Tony peered around the side of the van, where four other black-clad would-be kidnappers were currently in states of not-being-conscious.  “I was worried,” Steve said with a light shrug.
“You’re kidding me with this, right?” Tony demanded, throwing his cloth napkin on the table in apparent disgust.  “Not hurt, he says,” he muttered under his breath.  “Why don’t you just ask me for the money?”
“They were.  Amazing,” Tony replied in a rough, thick voice, looking down at his left hand where the band now gleamed from the third finger.  “They’d have liked you,” he added softly, feeling his eyes sting.  The wind, he told himself.
“Hi Tony,” he said, not looking up.
,” he growled.
He just...had to try harder.  He couldn’t put that on Tony. It wasn’t fair.  It was on him to figure this out.  Come up with a plan. That was what he did, right? Some great strategist he was, he sighed. So far, he had managed to search the Internet for useless information and barely avoid pornography in the process.  Let’s hear it for Captain America, he snorted.
“What then?  The money?  I told you, we should get a pre-nup.  Or, what do they call it?  Post-nup?  Something.  If we did, then maybe—“ Steve started.
He watched Tony pull his tie off, the silk zipping through his nimble fingers, and felt his throat go dry. Heat stirred deep within him as forbidden images filled his mind. His eyes blindfolded with the tie, seeing only the deep, dark edges of red.  His hands tied to the bed above his head, feeling the silk against his wrists.
“Ah.  Good.  Hope the bastard is losing his shit over this,” Rhodey announced vehemently.
Tony heard the click of the cup as Steve put it down on the table, then the bed sank down next to his shoulder.  He felt the lightest of touches across his chest, enough to make the shadows move, like a campfire game.  What shape will he make of me?
“War is a terrible thing.  David talks about what he saw, maybe now more than ever.  I think he knows there isn’t much time left for those who were there.  Who remember what its really like.  He insists on coming to these things because he wants them, the young ones, to know.  Sees it as his responsibility,” Charles explained.  “He thinks we shouldn’t have been so quick with ‘Nam.”
“It’s my favorite, too,” Steve told him.    That was true. Of all of them, it meant the most.  It always had. Though now, standing here, he finally felt he understood exactly what it meant.  He thought it might mean a lot more than he had ever imagined. He thought it might mean just this side of everything.  Steve cleared his throat and looked down at Tony. His bowtie was askew, dangling from around his neck. His shirt was untucked.  His hair mussed, his lips swollen and red, his eyes dark with desire, and Steve thought to himself that he had done that to Tony. It felt amazing, that knowledge, that he could make Tony feel like that.  Tony, who could have anyone, and wanted him for some unfathomable reason.
Look Ma!  I did fluff!
“Will do,” Tony said.  “Wish me luck.”
“Of course, he’s interested in the company, Jarvis!” Tony burst out, slumping back against his chair.  “Of course, he…”
Steve thought to himself, feeling it warm him, as it always did.
Tony squelched his face up and glanced at Rhodey.
“That’s true.  I had no idea I would be getting someone like this when we Bonded,” Steve said back to him, though the way he said it, all soft and husky, like the words were pulled from deep inside, torn and broken a bit on their way out.  “Tony, look at me.  Please?” he asked, thumb tracing a line back and forth over Tony’s cheekbone.
“So, ah.  Is the spark gone, or--” Tony began, clearing his throat and aiming for a humor that he didn’t at all feel.  “Look, I’m just--this is weird, okay? I think of myself as pretty open, bit of a risk-taker, and, hey, nothing like being on death’s door to really open yourself up to new adventures, but, this, well.  It’s a lot, you’ve got to understand, I just need to know what I’m getting myself into here, that’s-- “
“I should like to meet them very much,” Cam said eagerly.  “The King said I could have a talking bird. That must be a spell, don’t you think? Did your witch make animals talk?”
“You’re an ass,” Steve replied good-naturedly.
try that thing the Reverend suggested.  Though, it wasn’t as if he felt out of sorts or anything. Quite the opposite, really.  He always woke up from these dream-nights feeling sated and worn, but good, too.  Exhilarated. Like his body was brimming with energy.
“Why, my purpose is the same as always, Your Highness, of course.  To see to your pleasure and comfort, as is my highest duty,” Zola said in a high, lilting voice that made Steve want to grind his teeth together.  “I thought, perhaps, you might be inclined to enjoy some company this evening?  To celebrate the occasion?  A virgin, untrained, but eager to please, I assure you, Your Highness.”
“I want you to be my friend, too,” Tony piped up.
“Bring it over,” Zola ordered, coming around the table and holding out his hands.  The attendant brought the box forward and Zola lifted the strands of metal from the case.  They fell in cascades of finely-honed metal chains from a belt that Zola wrapped around Steve’s waist so that the chains formed a metal curtain that swung low in front and back, then arched up high over Steve’s hips.  It didn’t hide much of anything, but caught the light and glimmered when he moved, making small clinking sounds as the chains rubbed together.
, do you understand?” Ty hissed into his ear, his fingers tightening on Tony’s chin.  “It’s just a couple of blow jobs, Tony.  Don’t be a fucking prude.”  Tony stared at him for a long moment, then nodded. Ty let go of his chin, leaned back up and patted Tony’s shoulder with one hand.  Tony looked down at the floor, blinking back against the burning behind his eyes.  Ty rubbed at his shoulders, giving them a light squeeze.  “We’ll go home as soon we’re done celebrating, okay? Deal?” Ty said.  Tony nodded, something sick twisting in his gut.  His eyes stung.  He could feel hot tears running down his cheeks.  He just wanted to go home.
“Tony…
“Good,” Tony replied.
“Did you really try to go to class like this?” Steve asked as the door closed behind Rhodey.
It was true, he had no
“I saw…” Tony began, then broke off, an uneasy expression crossing his face.
“I made some, just a few, completely safe, don't worry—but, don't touch them, like, at all, definitely a no-go there—modifications to the power supply lines,” Tony finished with a wince twisting across his face.
“Uh-huh,” Bucky nodded.  “That good, huh?”
I just have to be better.  For him.  Better for him. Find a way. A way in.
He didn’t want to tell Steve why it was so important to him that they find people before winter set in. For one, he wasn’t entirely sure yet. It was early, and things could happen. As a Healer, he knew plenty about that. But, soon. Soon, he would have to tell Steve. And then, what? He would be a burden during a long, hard winter with just the two of them and Dummy struggling to make it, and Steve would worry, and when the time came, what if something went wrong and there was no Healer to help?
A moment later, Tony’s hand was wrapped around Steve’s cock again, warm and slick with something this time. Some kind of oil, Steve thought distantly, feeling Tony’s hand glide up and down, wrist twisting around the head.  A few more strokes, harder and faster, the sound of flesh on flesh filling Steve’s ears.  Tony leaned down and mouthed at the heated skin there, catching on his Adam’s apple as it bobbed, sucking small circles of bruises on the flesh where Steve’s shoulder curved into his throat.
“Be my guest,” Tony said after a moment. Steve pushed himself up and took the condom from Tony, placing the circled opening over the head of Tony’s cock.  He heard Tony’s sharp intake of breath and glanced up, noting the pinched expression on Tony’s face.  “Fuck, that’s hot,” Tony breathed out, biting his lip as Steve held Tony’s cock with one hand and slowly rolled the condom on with the other.
“God, it’s cold. Is it always this cold?  Who knew my fate would be a half-frozen corpse with a bus-pass?  Page Six will go nuts,” Tony muttered, watching his breath come in puffs that quickly blew away with the wind and rain.
,” Anthony announced, sitting down on the bed next to Steve.  He was warm, Steve could almost swear he felt it, though it was the words as much as anything. They were warm words.  Thoughts. Whatever. It didn’t matter. None of it was real.
He was also fairly sure that was the definition of giving himself false hope, but he couldn’t think of a better option at the moment.  Tony could. Tony would have known what to grab from the bits and pieces of plane parts and would probably have weaponized the cabin’s sad looking portable stove by now.
“I’ve got sketch after sketch of you.  Your eyes, your mouth, your hands—I must really like your hands, because I’ve drawn them from every possible angle,” Steve continued, embarrassed, but clearly determined to get answers Tony wasn’t sure he had.  “Last I remember, we could barely tolerate each other when we weren’t saving the world, and now…now we have inside jokes and you—you touch me.  All the time.  I don’t know if you even realize you do it.  But it’s—it’s familiar.  Comforting, and I—“ he stopped himself.  “Just tell me.”
Steve’s head was so full of thoughts of Tony and fishing and what it all might mean, might lead to--and yeah, he was jumping ahead, he couldn’t help it-- that he didn’t pick up on what he was hearing right away, but there was something about the cadence or the combination of voices, something that slithered through the tide of thoughts in his mind.  A sense of wrongness.  Something being off, something...something.  Steve stopped, listening, body tightening instinctively, muscles bunching.  Alert readiness flooded him.  It was a familiar enough feeling, the switch being flicked right before a fight, but it took him a moment longer than usual to process
“Buck,” Steve said.
“She’s not going to be there?  Is everything okay?” Steve asked.
Tony let out a long breath against Steve’s side and felt something break open and release inside him.  He didn’t believe it, but Steve did, and that was enough for now.  Until he could make it, not right.  He couldn’t do that.  But, he could make it count for something.
Steve gave him a long look, then placed one hand over the center of Tony’s chest where the reactor hummed inside a casing of peeled-back skin, keeping him alive.  Tony’s teeth ground together as he returned Steve’s look, then he reached up and wrapped his hand around Steve’s wrist, pulling the other man’s hand back until he could twine their fingers together, letting the pads of his fingers scrape over Steve’s knuckles, through the caked on blood there, and over the back of his hand.
In front of him, the gate began to slowly retract.  The security bar raised and the tire spikes that were embedded in the ground lowered.  Tony eased the car through the narrow opening, then put his foot on the gas hard enough to make the engine jump as he zoomed down the long stretch of road that led to the building’s entrance.  He could feel his heart thumping.  If he pulled his shirt up, he was half afraid he would see the skin bulge in time with each beat.  There was a fluttery sort of nervousness vibrating just under his skin that made it almost impossible to sit still, even in the confines of the car.  The urge to move, to do something, to be in motion was almost unbearable, as if something was on his heels, something he wouldn’t be able to quite catch if he looked over his shoulder, but knew it was there, and if he stopped, it would catch up to him.  It was crazy, but he couldn’t shake the feeling.  The need to
“I’ll take care of it,” Coulson promised.
“Because I’ve been a slave my whole life.  You learn to pay attention.  Hear the things the masters want, but don’t say.  Sometimes, they trick you, because they can, but if you pay attention, then sometimes you’ll know,” Cam explained.  “I don’t think the King’s like that, though.  He just doesn’t want to order you to like him.”
“When’d you get so smart?” Steve asked with a small huff.
“She did.  I swear it, she did, threw a plate right at him, you should’ve seen it!” Jarvis said from his place on the sofa next to Peggy’s chair.  “It was brilliant.”
He wanted to be Tony’s, all of him, because that was what Tony deserved, no less than the whole, but he had given pieces of himself to someone who had no right to them, who had taken them from him, and until now, he hadn’t known how to begin to get those back.
The same thread, Steve thought hazily as he drifted into slumber. The same thread. Forged in blood and ash and bound by something more, something strong.
Intercranial pressure monitor.
Steve let out a surprised puff of laughter, then shook his head, letting it dip down.  One hand came up to rub at his forehead, before he dropped it and looked at Tony.
“Well...that’s not at all terrifying,” Tony muttered under his breath.
“You would,” Rhodes shot back, rolling his eyes a bit while Strucker’s bulged, watching the interplay between the two of them.
“That’s totally understandable, Buck,” Steve told him.
“Nat’s…massager,” Barnes added, shooting a surreptitious look at Nat.
“It’s cute that you think that’s going to happen just because I love you,” Tony said mildly, lifting his head enough to start trailing light kisses up the column of Steve’s throat.
“Bad men,” Steve said, frowning.   Tony gazed up at him, startled.  It was the first thing in his language that Steve had said.
He was torn between being pissed off and just so tired of even thinking about it, or studiously avoiding thinking about it, that he wasn’t sure which way was up half the time.  It felt good to hand the baton off to them for a moment, though he wouldn’t admit it to them.  He suspected it wasn’t exactly a secret.  Team Johnny Cash for the win, he thought with a wisp of a laugh that rattled through his chest and broke something loose that he hadn’t quite realize had been winding its way through him.
“That’s comforting…by the way, I have something to run by you when you finish telling me how Steve’s roommate is good at killing people,” Tony replied, mouth twisting into a grimace.
“Gentrification,” Tony replied.
“Up with you,” Tony said to Cam, taking the boy’s hand and pulling him to his feet. “My Raj’Inama wishes to learn a lesson in humility, and I think we all agree that is past due, do we not?”
“Tell him, Tony. Tell him how you feel,” Jarvis encouraged.  “I think he is waiting for you to answer.”
“I’m pretty sure I did a fairly bang-up job of screwing things up, too,” Tony replied. “I was the one who broke it off,” he pointed out.
Tony, he thought with a sigh.
“Hey, man, I said we should leave you alone!” Mitchell pleaded, throwing his hands up in front of him.
“I didn't...I should have realized that you'd...worry. I'm—damn, okay. This is--I'm--Tony, I'm not—I'm not going to do anything to—to punish you. I wouldn't...” Steve broke off, rolling his lower lip between his teeth, his whole posture going rigid.
The two agents nodded at Tony in greeting, and one waved him over towards one of the large bay doors that had the SHIELD eagle etched on the glass, which slid open as they approached.
, right? Outside the window, the unknown sun glowed a bright yellow-white and seemed to chide him for not Occam’s razoring the whole situation.
“Don’t worry.  Not going to drop you, Cap,” Tony said as he picked up speed.
“I believe that will be enough for tonight,” Tony said to Cam.  “With my thanks for your very able assistance,” he added and pulled out another silver coin.  Cam glanced over at Steve.  Steve tipped his chin at him and gave him a small, encouraging smile.
That roused a small chuckle from Steve. “Nick sent me papers, Nat brought me the mask, I got a flight-ticket, that’s kinda as far as my plan went.”
A beat.
Right now, Tony’d let Steve take him wherever and however he wanted. His body burned with need. All restraint was gone—reservation chucked successfully out the window. Because wallowing in the past never did anyone any good. He’d hurt Steve, Steve’d hurt him, but they were still together. He was still in his arms.
“You’re getting a bit personal, there, don’t you think?” he asked, and then, without taking his eyes off the man, motioned for the paper draft in front of them. “You’re here to discuss the latest changes with me, aren’t you? I think we should stick to that.”
“Good. Tell Steve I said hi. And have fun tonight.”
“I’m not sure how mourning someone makes Tony a—”
Their nanny sure had come over during crazy hours once or twice already, but Steve tried not to make a habit out of it. After a weeklong background check as well as double-checking her references, Veronica had been the only nanny that Tony had deemed acceptable, and Steve really tried not to push her patience if he could help it.
“Good. Keep them busy until Fury and Nat ensure control over the Triskelion.”
“Maybe it’s not,” Steve amended. “But Obadiah is controlling you. Don’t you see that? He exploited your weakness after her death, trying to lead the company as his own. And now that you want to take back control, he’s looking for ways to stop you.”
And that kiss, for some reason, felt a lot like saying goodbye.
Tony leered at Steve. “And then the
“You’ve been busy,” Steve commented with a nod towards T’Challa and Peter. “Didn’t we say no more strays?”
It wasn’t just that one vision, that one moment in the barracks, it was a whole life creeping up on him as he lay on the floor gasping for air. The headache, while painful, was far in the background as it all came crashing down. He saw more than he wanted to know, and the things he saw playing out in front of his eyes were wrapped around experiences that had once been his.
Tony’s mind supplied helpfully, as he took in Steve’s form. He was… every bit as gorgeous as Tony had imagined he would be. This was how it had started, with Tony appreciating the way Steve’s always-a-little-too-tight shirts hugged his chest, or the way his arms flexed whenever he’d carried the new lab equipment around the room. It had been a physical attraction for a whole long while, but now that Tony finally got to see him in the nude, well...
Steve took several shuddering breaths as he fell back down on the mattress, taking Tony with him. For several minutes, they were just lying there. Tony was wheezing for air, burying his face into Steve’s neck as he tried to regain composure.
"You know that I am," Steve answered, fastening both arms around Tony's waist now, to keep them close. He watched those beautiful brown eyes for a moment before nodding his head. "Guess we're in luck, since I feel the same."
So Thor had left for Asgard, that was sort of a relief, considering that the guy usually bore solutions with him when he returned from his excursions. He could wait until Thor came back with an answer, provided his visions remained more or less the same. "And uh… did," Steve paused, thinking of how to put it in a way that wouldn't bring up any suspicions on Tony's side. Sadly, there was no way to do that, and Steve still had to ask. "Did they report any visions about things that… that never happened?"
He turned a little, brushing his nose against Steve’s jaw line and pressing a soft kiss on the skin there. “Sorry for that pedophile comment. He crossed a line with that one…”
He was leaning against the rock, and only now, when Tony let his head fall back in his neck, a soft moan hitting the air, Steve saw his hand move back and forth under the water.
Tony grinned at him provokingly. “Can’t keep your hands off me, can you?”
“I did, yes. But if I’d chosen your side, Bucky would’ve died without a doubt.”
Tony looked slightly amused as he kneeled on the bed, settling down on top of Steve’s thighs.
“Obi,” Tony said, his pleasant voice bringing Steve back to himself. “I didn't expect the whole staff to greet us. I think I told you that it wasn’t necessary.”
“I know,” Steve said. There was no attempt at deception in his tone; he knew exactly what he was doing, what he was risking. But he was brutally determined.
“Barnes,” Tony acknowledged with a curt nod. His eyes didn’t leave the tablet.
“תפוס מחסה!” she called to the scientist.
“Steve?” Tony called, looking squarely at him.
Despite the fact that he was the subject of the conversation, Bucky sat perfectly still in the corner of the room, glancing out of the window.
That had Steve smile, even as he heard Tony scoffing. “That’s no reason for you to manhandling my boyfriend. Could you stop that? I’d like to introduce him to Rhodey.”
A dry, humorless chuckle rose to Tony’s throat.
But still Steve held off, afraid to touch him. “I don’t want to hurt you.”
“When was that?”
“Let’s not find out, then,” he said determinately, brushing a kiss across Steve’s lips. He let one of his hands wander downwards, fingers tracing a path along Steve’s abdomen and eventually curling around his cock, relishing the harsh gasp that rode off Steve’s lips.
children.
Tony frowned as he looked down at himself. He felt all kinds of not presentable right now, and if Steve thought that him not showing up would raise more questions than him showing up like
* * *
It was stupid, okay? Silly even, but Steve didn't really care, and even if he had, there would be no way for him to stop the flood of happiness inside. He'd stopped hoping, at one time, that he'd ever find anyone to call his boyfriend, or girlfriend for that matter. He'd contented himself to a life of fighting the good fight and having no one to come home to. And he’d been fine with that.
“Who are you?” he asked. He pointedly put his right hand on the table, his watch gleaming under the bright electric lights. One movement and he’d have the Iron Man gauntlet at the ready. The guy wouldn’t even know what was coming for him.
“It’s not over yet, Steve,” he whispered, and then, because there was no point in holding back anything at this point, Tony closed the distance between them.
“No,” Tony shot back, and Steve instantly knew he was lying. “Sounds like a solid plan. We’ll only see each other as often as we absolutely need to, and that’s that.”
“You’re the
Steve’s arms flung around his neck. He couldn’t let him leave. Not now. Not ever. He’d just found this.
. Why the hell was Steve even coming here, snapping at Tony, when he had someone with him?
Steve rolled off of Tony and pulled him into his arms. He usually didn't display the full extent of his power with his one night stands. He didn't need to, and was worried it would freak them out. But this wasn't a one night stand, and Tony knew his powers well enough. So he encircled the man in his arms and breathed him in. It would all be fine. He and Tony would work it all out.
“Mister Rogers?”
good friends. Right?”
There was a noise, Tony realized.
“Copy,” Steve said and sent Tony a pointed glance. “You ready?”
“Rhodey will take over for me.”
There was a sudden harsh note in his voice that hadn’t been there during their latest calls. And Steve would be lying if he said the shield that he withdrew from his bag didn’t come as a massive surprise. And now Tony was coming toward him, his body wracked with resentment and determination.
“Go easy on me, big guy,” Tony looks over his shoulder when he hears the familiar pop of a lid. Steve nods and pours the lube over his fingers. Tony faces forward again, taking deep breaths to calm himself. He can’t help but jerk when Steve rubs at his entrance.
Sam chuckles and waves back.
“I said I didn’t want to hear it.”
Alexander gives a nonchalant shrug and turns to pour himself another drink. He makes another and offers it to Steve.
“I’m not expecting you to remember everything. It was part of the plan.”
“Deal,” Tony holds out a hand for Peter to take. “Last chance. And if I fuck it up then you can disown me and kick my ass. I’d deserve it.”
He finds out the reason behind the laughter when he enters the living room. There’s a white cat in his uncle Bucky’s lap, meowing and purring as it crawls around him, rubbing its head against his uncle’s face.
Bucky winces at those words. “That sucks.”
“Tony, scaring them is not going to make the situation any better. They need us on their side.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Tony, it’s okay. I don’t need-”
“Of course, sir,” Jarvis replies. “Enjoy the rest of your evening.”
Steve is able to nod. He adjusts himself and spreads his legs, then he’s pushing again. The small grunts and pants he makes are the only sounds that fill the room. Steve’s eyes are shut in concentration, and when the next contraction comes, he pushes along with it.
The couch is just fine, but Tony would be lying if he said he didn’t want to be curled up around Steve instead. He huffs and adjusts the pillow Steve had given him, but sleep never comes. He can’t roll over much unless he plans on sleeping on the floor, so he lies on his back, his eyes glued to the dark ceiling above him.
He can’t eat anymore, even though he knows his body needs it. His stomach is churning, and he can’t tell if it’s from the usual nausea that comes with pregnancy or the fact that Tony was being different toward him.
“I...I guess.”
“Will you stop!” Pepper cries in frustration. Tony blinks a few times as he tries to register her last words. He had zoned out again.
Sam’s smile widens and he cups Bucky’s face, using his thumbs to brush away the tears that have now left wet tracks down Bucky’s cheeks.
Tony groans when his cock brushes against Steve’s thigh. He ruts against the omega, smearing his leaking cock against Steve’s leg, marking him in his musky scent. Tony leans forward, burying his face in the crook of Steve’s neck, shaky breaths slipping past his lips.
I don't think that's how BARF works so I tweaked with it. Oh well :)
At the mention of their son, whatever is left of Tony’s heart finally shatters. Their son. Their little boy. He was so excited to meet his baby brother or sister. Now they had to break the worst news to him. It wasn’t fair.
“I think you need to grow into this,” Steve says and gently removes the helmet from Peter's head. “I’ll keep it for now okay?”
Please don't hate Tony. He doesn't know what's going on with Steve and honestly, he's scared because Steve isn't the same and he's not sure what to do. But this was an awakening for the both of them and the next chapter is going to focus on Steve finally getting the help he needs. Also, Steve would never hurt his baby. He's hurting right now, but he'd never hurt anyone else. I will try and get the next part up soon.
James’ eyes widen and he nods his head frantically. “Yes please!”
“I’m coming. But are you eventually going to come out here? I know you can practically run SI from wherever you are but-”
“More or less. He’s tough but I’m tougher.” Natasha grins.
Tony’s not expecting Peter to answer the question, though he’d be lying if he said he wasn’t curious. He had dated throughout the years. Well, he wouldn’t go as far as to use the word dated. The relationships he had were meaningless and would never amount to anything other than sex. It was just another pathetic coping mechanism.
“Yes?” Peter says, unsurely, still confused about the glasses. “This is it? But they’re just sunglasses.”
Steve grimaces down at his barely touched beverage for a moment, then does as he’s told and takes another drink. He eventually finishes it and Tony takes the empty mug to the kitchen and places it in the sink. He glances back toward the living room, finding his husband curled up on the sofa and clutching his stomach.
“Yeah,” Peter murmurs and tries to adjust his hoodie when it bunches in the front and creates a small curve. Pretty soon his own belly would be doing that.
Tony is locked up in his workshop when he gets the alert that Steve has returned home. He allows him access and pauses his work. It was about time they talked.
“I think that’s a good idea.” The doctor nods her head in agreement. “Steve, let me take a look okay? We can go to the room across the hall.”
Steve smiles back. Then it’s faltering. This was it. They were finally going to talk.
The alpha laps hungrily at the slick. With his tongue he follows the trail that coats the inside of Steve’s thigh, and then back up again to the source of the sweetness. He works a finger in along with his tongue, thrusting in roughly, searching for that spot that will bring Steve over the edge.
“He really liked that place, huh? I used to think maybe it was because he had missed so much, but he was just a big dork.”
“Do I smell like coffee? Mama says I do.” Tony chuckles softly. When James doesn’t respond and pulls back to curl up with Steve again, Tony frowns. It was going to take a lot to get the pups to open up to him.
“Aren’t we all? Here at Hydra, we believe that mankind needs a step in a new direction, to change our ways of living.”
Steve grunts, eyes squeezing shut. He waits for the pain to erupt and set his body on fire. But it never comes. Tony isn’t forcing himself inside, he’s taking his time, slowly pushing inch by inch of himself until they're pressed together.
Tony snorted, as he opened his faceplate, leaning a bit against Thor. “Whatever else happens, it’s always comforting to see you guys smashing things.”
“Casualties?”
“You want it?” he whispered into his ear, while he made quick work of his tie and dress shirt, throwing both on the floor. As soon as the arc reactor was laid bare, the dark surrounding was cast into a soft, blue light, bathing Steve’s skin with it.
Steve was wearing some sort of pajama pants, and not much else. The pants had some goofy red and gold pattern that was so unlike Steve that Bucky had to physically fight back a snarky comment. It was showing the robot he’d fought on the bridge.
Tony couldn’t help it. He laughed richly when, instead of giving him a real answer, Steve all but started to strip right in front of him, tearing off his boots and socks like they had personally offended him.
He could barely make out Fury’s form in the darkness, covered as he was in dark clothing, blending into the curtains behind him. A low quiet laugh resounded in the air between them. “Believe it or not, but this is bigger than your ego, Stark.”
Tony ever since their return. After he’d left with Pepper and Rhodes, Steve hadn’t heard of him again. From Natasha, he knew that Tony’d agreed to hold a press conference about their fight against Thanos in a day or two, and from an offhanded comment from Peter to Vision, he had gathered that Tony was already back to tinkering in his makeshift workshop, designing tools and components for reconstruction work, building things for Stark Industries or working on Avengers gear.
confusing. Steve almost couldn’t get the thought around his head, knowing he was taller than most people now. But Tony only raised his chin high, staring Steve down despite their height difference.
But instead of deterring the conversation further, Tony tried for a smile, and boldly leaned up to press a small kiss on Steve’s lips. “What did you think I was talking about?”
Back then, Steve hadn’t realized how significant it had been that Tony had told him all that. Only later, when he had asked Rhodey if he could show him a photo of Jarvis, he’d realized that Tony had
And sure enough, when Tony had finished talking, the frown on Steve’s forehead was a prominent fixture and it didn’t smooth out again for a good few hours. Tony had basically watched him retreat inwards, pondering the idea in his head for a whole long while. Only when Helen had shown him the remodeled Cradle, throwing all kinds of neuroscience terms at him, Steve had come out of his stupor and instead started to ask about a hundred questions.
"You have me," he said, short of breath, right against Tony's shoulder. He licked at the skin and nipped on it, decidedly aiming to leave a mark.
[TStark] [chat_server:46953] is offline
messy,” Tony replied, and managed a weak, hopeful smile. Steve opened his mouth, probably to explain that he was talking a long-term relationship and not their little back and forth, but Tony stopped him.
Tony shrugged as he leaned against Steve. “We could take the Northern route. I hear Lake Michigan is nice this time of the year.”
“Maybe what’s going through your head right now. No filters, no second thoughts, just tell me.”
“About what?”
When Steve stood up, he cast him a small smile that Steve returned immediately.
Just as Tony had predicted, it hadn’t taken long for the police to confirm the body in the boat was female, and not much longer for them to identify it was indeed that of Indries Stark.
Steve startled, whirling around. Bucky stood at the other side of the corridor, casually leaning against the wall as he smiled at him.
Obi huffed, and it was a nasty sort of sound Tony was pretty sure he hadn’t heard from him so far. “So you’re actually whoring yourself out to older men now, is that it? Goddammit, Tony, if your father was still alive, he’d—”
And the only thing Tony contributed was trying not to blow it all apart again.
He opened his eyes, and with that, Tony was gone. The strange luxurious room had vanished, leaving him cold and alone in his own bed.
He had let himself fall in love with Steve Rogers. Of course he would have. Given the slightest chance, given only a few months—weeks—of being at Steve’s side in a peaceful manner would unlock all of the things he’d kept very close to his heart for all these past years.
Tony didn’t have to look to know that this didn’t look all that good.
Steve pulled back, eyes narrowing. “You shut yourself off,” he retorted. “I wanted to talk to you and you brushed past me with a ‘fuck off’. And then you deleted me on all your accounts. For some reason, that gave me the impression that you didn’t wanna talk.”
“And the other Steve?” Steve asked. “What was he like?”
They were sitting on a large log next to their fireplace. Tony was busy fiddling with his tools and a piece of wood, while Steve just sat there, gazing into the strange yellow sky.
Steve gathered all the courage he had—the courage that always came so easily on the battlefield, but not when it came to matters of the heart. It felt like he was baring himself, making himself oddly vulnerable, and he’d never liked that feeling. And yet… not risking this—not risking himself—felt worse than knowing he’d never given it a try.
“I can’t do this officially, but I’ll let you get to that Quinjet. You gotta do it alone, or Ross will cut us off for good. Leave the others behind. I’ll come after you with reinforcements.”
Clint only grinned. “Second that.”
And what was he going to do about Tony? There were so many conflicting thoughts running through his head, but after the conversation with Bruce, all he could think of was that he should try and help Tony—
“Trying to come up with something intellectual,” he told Ian, “but the only thing I remember is
“He’ll love to,” Steve assured her and squeezed her hand. “The photo, can I—”
“He wants to steal a biological weapon?” Steve asked, then looked at Tony accusingly. “See—that’s what I mean. You keep doing that, throwing information at me and… How would you possibly know that? And if you say that JARVIS got his hands on some reports, I swear, Tony—”
“That wasn’t because I couldn’t stand him but because I basically got a boner every time he tried to teach me the star constellations. And last year… you know… with the crazy trip to MIT? Well, the guy at the physic’s lab had asked me once if I wanted to grab dinner with him sometime, and I kind of stalked him for a week after that, and—”
good. All this time Tony had hooked up with random guys and girls, he had never felt fire like this.
“Right,” Tony said, as if remembering what he ought to do for this to work. With a frown on his forehead, he raised the other leg as well, bracketing Steve’s hips.
this. Don’t let it go. He will love you, too. Believe that. Believe in us.”
Peter dropped his hands to his sides, his nose scrunching up for a moment. “She’s great. I’m just… nervous.”
He couldn’t, however, help the small smile when Rhodey flicked him off.
And when he finally made his move, swallowing him in a fierce kiss, Tony had seen it coming. There was still that lost moment of surprise that it was happening
Steve looked him up and down. It was true, Tony’s undersuit and his hands and bare feet were covered in a sticky amber-colored fluid.
A few minutes later, he was down in the workshop, putting the phone’s parts back together.
“I knew this would happen again,” Bucky told him quietly. “Everything HYDRA put inside me is still there. The last few times I lost control, at home or down in Bruce’s lab, it was just… short flashbacks. But this felt like my mind resetting to zero. All they had to do was say the goddamn words. I’m not safe. You should’ve never taken me home with you.”
When Steve stiffened in implication, a sigh of concession rumbled through Tony’s lips. “Sweetheart, it wasn’t your fault. You did everything you could. Absolutely, positively, one-hundred-percent everything you could. Far more than you should have, and certainly more than he deserved. My point is, this is the first time that your mission of ‘Saving Bucky Barnes’ only requires you to do nothing but wait. Of course that makes you uncomfortable. You just have to trust me and Bruce to get the job done.”
Something opened in front of him.
Slowly, Steve walked up the stairway and then further towards the corridor leading to the west wing. He stopped just before the corner, staying very still.
“I told you you didn’t want to know,” he whispered, fear-stricken that he might’ve lost this after all.
“They thought I could help their cause,” Zola agreed. “I also helped my own.”
"No, you were fantastic," Steve said, following his words with a deep, satisfied sigh. "I can't imagine a better first time."
“If we don’t do this now,” Tony said, his voice gentle, “it’s going to be done to us later. That’s a fact. And it won’t be pretty.”
Steve was right. This was his chance.
Taking hold of his arms, Steve gently pushed Tony off his chest and rolled them over until Steve was more or less on top of him. “In that case… How do you feel about having sex with a father-to-be?” he teased.
Eyeing him worriedly, Steve made to kneel right behind Tony’s head, one arm wrapped around his shoulders, the other grabbing for Tony’s hand. Distantly, Tony noticed Thor stepping up to his feet, pushing both hands down on his ankles, and Natasha and Clint almost casually taking stand on the other side of the bed. Honestly, he wasn’t even sure he’d have the energy to put up a fight at this point. The morphine was making him far too drowsy.
At that, he whimpered Tony’s name against into his mouth—a sound of surrender, even to his ears. That was it. There was no more fighting this.
It might have something to do with Phil still getting that awestruck fanboy-look whenever he talked to Steve, but Tony guessed he was also overprotective of the brown-haired Inhuman-girl.
“I want to talk about the fact that we got married,” Steve said and exhaled a long breath. “In
“Every bite. What do you want to drink?”
Whew, next chap's already gonna be the last one! I'm so giddy about writing Civil War, though, it's lots of fun so far, and I hope you guys will be there for it :)
“And we’ll do it together.”
“Alright. Don’t know about you,” Tony said, and his tone was all the indication Steve needed to know that he was teetering on the edge of reason, “but I’ve had about enough of this bullshit.”
Tony seemed to know that, too, and tugged on Steve hand gently. “Come on.”
"I can give you his excuse. Will that work for you?" Bruce didn't seem too affected by Steve's rant, he just stared at Steve contemplatively. "He's finishing his PhD."
Steve crouched behind his shield, his eyes darting around the room before setting on the window, moving about quickly until he’d located what he was looking for. “A shooter,” he breathed, then leaned down to Tony. He pushed two fingers against Fury’s pulse point before his gaze snapped back to Tony. “Were you—”
“Last night… I wasn’t myself. Obi’s driving me nuts, and I…” A long, broken laugh. “I’m sorry. So sorry. I shouldn’t have done it. Not without your consent.”
“He is coming to terms,” Natasha said with a narrow expression.
“I’m gonna go get more drinks,” Steve announced. “Anything particular?”
Barnes raised his hand to nudge the shoulder where the metal arm was sewn into his body, his eyebrows knit in confusion. “I’m still expecting to wake up,” he said after a long moment, not quite meeting Tony’s eyes. “Sometimes I’m just drifting off and I’m back in the basement where they kept me…”
“Good night, boss.” Maria was watching them both, bemused affection lighting her eyes.
Tony could feel Steve’s heart thundering, his pulse humming melodically against Tony’s chest. He was nervous, no doubt about that now, but he also wanted this. He could feel it with every shiver, and the way his eyes begged him to do something already.
And Tony found he didn’t want to lie to him, too.
“I’m sorry?” Tony asked, his eyes flickering to Bucky’s arm for a second before he looked back up. “What was that? I couldn’t hear you over the pot calling the kettle black.”
“Water under the bridge,” Tony whispered, and his mouth found Steve’s in a blink. Steve’s mind collapsed and his body fell pliant in Tony’s arms. It amazed him that Tony’s kisses still had that enthralling effect over him.
He felt Steve sink into him with relaxation, felt him brush kisses across his forehead. Felt his ridiculous long lashes dance against his skin. “Love this,” Steve said, as he pulled back, brushing strands of Tony’s hair away from his face with gentle attention. “Love you.”
Hammer scoffed. “Do you really think you could replace his wife at Stark Mansion? Mrs. Stark was an enigma. Everybody loved her.
Bucky hadn’t wanted to come down here, and the others had agreed that they didn’t want to spoil their reunion.
“Come, sit with us,” Natasha said as she tugged him forward. “Steve, this is Agent Clint Barton, and Agent Phil Coulson.”
There were already enough secrets between them as it was.
He had given the kick his all, every bit of strength he possessed, and the man ended on the floor, unconscious for now, though Steve had a feeling those were just fleeting moments.
. It was… Ultron. It had to be.
“Settled you down.” Steve snapped his teeth teasingly. “Tamed you.”
"Me neither," Steve supplied weakly.
Either way, Steve still had to protect Tony and Ian from every threat, including human ones. Maybe now more so than ever. And even though he couldn’t sign the Accords like this, he knew they’d have to make a few compromises to make it work.
“I… don’t know,” he admitted and took a deep breath. “We’ll just have to keep fighting.”
“I’ll hold you to that,” he said, just as Steve had slipped the ring on his finger, brushing his thumb over it reverently. “One condition, though. You will never leave it to Clint again to pass on any sort of message to me, because hearing that you need ‘time out’, going to
“Okay, forget it. I won’t last through a blowie,” Tony gasped and closed his eyes. “You’re too much. Just get on with the lube.”
Bucky sighed. “If they made up, they’d be busy.”
He was in bed, naked, with a man. He was in bed, naked, with Tony Stark.
But, here they were, and Tony was clearly interested in switching. Steve wanted to give Tony what he wanted, and he knew Tony wouldn't hurt him.
“I had wondered what had happened to you,” Steve admitted. “It’s been a while since I heard anything about you. Maria said you were recruited by the CIA?”
He closed his mouth around the tip, sucking on it briefly before letting go again. “Might as well have some fun,” he drawled, “Seeing as this is my dream and all.”
Tony kind of hated himself for all of this, but he’d get him—and all of the others—out soon. He had to.
, he announced via the Avenger’s comm-line.
Tony straightened up and stared right at him. “Do you want us to go back into the kitchen?”
Steve looked back to Tony, then turned around. “I’ll do it,” he said shortly, and left the room with quick, angry strides.
It was almost painful to watch. He’d gotten used to 2022’s Tony with all his emotions so vivid on his face. He remembered when he first met that Tony, all bounce and vitality, flirting, smirking, laughing, kissing him. His emotions had been out in the open then.
Words abandoned him completely. Tony swallowed down the lump in his throat and stepped closer. He opened his mouth to tell Steve how very wrong he was, but Steve momentarily pressed a finger over his lips, his eyes boring into him.
“Tony…” His voice and face both filled with trepidation.
,” Tony snapped, though the futility of his resistance was slowly dawning on him, too.
with you?” Tony asked, despair leaking into his voice. “I’m
the prettiest girl in high school, cheerleader captain, prom queen, but also intelligent, a genuinely nice person and actually interested in science and not just faking it—how a girl like that had just one day decided to look at Rhodey and fall madly in love with him was beyond Tony.
“Not yet,” Tony said, then snorted when he saw Steve’s disapproving expression. “I will—in a bit. The 2018-Avengers have just arrived in Latveria. Reed is already tracking their movements. And that means we gotta prepare everything from our end.”
They were growing on each other, and it made Steve’s heart swell with warmth.
“And you got yourself a whole new family, while I was away.” He resumed pacing around the bedroom and came to a stop in front of a row of picture frames. He took up one of them, and Steve didn’t have to look to know that it was one of their wedding photos. “And a husband.”
And thank you for reading so far! We'll be posting the next chapter sometime this week.
Carol huffed. “Who here didn’t see that coming?” She turned to Rhodes and shrugged with a smile. “Guess that leaves us to the king bed.”
And yet, there was no reason to be afraid. It wasn’t just the two of them—the whole team had grown close, each and every one of them. No matter what, they always had each other’s back, and Steve was sure there was nothing that could drive them apart.
He settled his hands on Tony’s back, letting his fingertips wander downwards ever so slightly. He could feel the firmness of Tony’s muscles beneath that fancy shirt; he could feel his heat and smell the scent of his skin.
Steve felt himself nod. He was glad that Tony decided to pursue this invention he’d been working on for so long. Still… “When are you leaving?”
An elderly man stepped in and Steve was so very relieved to see it was Jarvis and not Stane. He cast Steve a warm and gentle smile.
“I don’t. I just…” Tony sighed and trailed off. “Never mind,” he said, sitting down next to Steve.
Steve chuckled. “Where’s the trust?”
His mind could do nothing but pick out the objectionable portion of that statement. “Who?”
. Because it’s me. I’m no good at loving —
Steve frowned at that, and only realized that Clint’s daughter had come down the stairway, when he turned around. Clint leaned casually in the doorway, folding his arms over his chest as he looked down at the little brown-haired girl.
—opened up to push his tongue between Steve’s lips. And Steve tasted… well, of whiskey mostly, which wasn’t bad, but there were also a million of other things Tony tried to memorize. The hint of mouthwash, sweat, adrenaline. He was warm and slick, the brush of his lips insistent as his fingers dug more into Tony’s waist as if he’d run away if he didn’t hold on to him.
With that, Steve hastily kicked his shoes off and worked his way out of his pants. Tony got the drift, and rummaged through their bedside drawer for a moment, before throwing the bottle of lube on the mattress. When Steve was free of all bothersome barriers, Tony took a good, long minute to run his eyes appreciatively over his body, then peppered his chest with ravenous, ardent kisses. That was, until Steve pressed the full length of his body down against Tony’s.
“Tony?”
“Tell me,” Tony demanded. “
She drew a slow deep breath, nodding curtly. “We know him,” she said, then pulled her shoulders back. “He’s ex KGB. One of the best in the business. Clint and I met him on a few missions. Your shooter, he’s… he’s credited with over two dozen assassinations in the last fifty years. Most of the intelligence community doesn’t believe he exists. The ones who do call him
Steve snorted, and then, when he couldn’t help himself, laughed out loud. “If you
“Tada,” Vision confirmed, smiling. “Like a magic trick, exactly. You’re a clever guy.”
The flimsy smile on Pepper’s face turned a little wider. “My resume says I’m very adaptable.”
He didn’t deserve to remember being Steve’s friend.
“Very much,” Steve said truthfully.
He kind of missed touching Tony, but if it meant they had a chance to get along a little better, and maybe get to actually know each other, Steve was okay with that. For the moment.
Natasha closed her eyes as Bucky’s fingers dipped beneath the waistband of her pants, though he knew she tried not to. He traced the hem around her waist and grinned when she quickly reopened her eyes as he ground his middle against her, pressing her further into the mattress of his bed. His mouth was millimeters away from hers when he said, “You missed me. I know you did.”
, someone he’d barely known for a few months, and not the man he’d known since he’d been a child?
Tony startled, then looked up.
… you’re changing the world, Tony. You never needed Extremis for that.”
“Why would you want me around?” he asked, when he couldn’t hold the words in any longer. “You don’t owe me anything. I know I’m Steve’s friend, and I’ll always be, but you don’t have to pretend to like me. I’m Steve’s friend,
It was completely surreal and Tony had a hard time figuring out what the hell had just happened. He’d known… or
The cell phone Steve had left on the backseat of his car rung and he almost didn’t bother to get it—he was too busy freaking out again.
The pork had tasted really good last night and wasn’t half bad this morning either. They sat next to each other, eating in pointed silence, and Steve felt his good mood vaporizing.
Pietro joined her a moment later, and while his face was pointedly void of any emotions, Tony had a feeling he’d twist Ross balls without anyone even noticing if he so much as raised a word against his sister.
“I knew it was bound to be a bit weird,” Tony offered. “I know you never wanted to see me again, and I tried to respect that. I really did. Once this is over, I’ll go back to my life, and you’ll figure out what to do with yours, right?”
“We would never even
“What do you mean?”
he remembered Tony saying, a lifetime ago.
Soon enough, he had the upper hand. Clint was an awesome fighter, Tony had to give him that. But FRIDAY had studied all of his moves for years. He knew how Clint operated, and eventually, he had him pinned down on the ground.
"Alright, Mr. Stane,” Pepper answered with a sweet voice. “I'll have Happy help you out. Do let me know how you plan to go against SI’s lawyers." She got his attention there, and he his gaze briefly left Steve in favor of looking at Tony, then at her in turn.
—but that was just how Steve was; he was always close, and always a bit handsy with the people he liked.
* * *
* * *
He’d sacrifice anything to kill Thanos. And to avenge those who’d died at his hand.
He could feel Tony’s mouth curling into a smile. “Yes…
Even if he couldn’t do it face to face, he had to leave him some form of goodbye.
Tony felt his cheeks heating up and broke his gaze from Steve’s, rubbing his wrist when he couldn’t find anything to do with his free hand. He then stood up and sidestepped Steve, because if he didn’t get away right now, he might do something really stupid.
Tony scrunched up his nose, and Steve knew it was an easy thing for him to say—and something he couldn’t exactly know.
anything?!”
The sight had Steve stopping in his tracks. He gulped, watching Bucky’s metal hand tighten and his nostrils flare.
“What do you want, Steve?” Tony asked, eventually. “Politics aside, what do you want?”
Steve hesitated slightly. “Wasn’t gonna.”
“You’re admittedly a pretty face,” Hammer continued. “An innocent boy he’ll want to defile. Men like Stark enjoy dirtying up their conquests, but he’ll get tired of you soon, and where will that leave you? People will talk about you, they will know you like to spread your bony legs for other men. Trust me, boy, once Stark stops caring about you, you’ll be done for.”
An all too relieved breath. “God, yes,” Tony said and chuckled when Steve pressed him down and settled his whole body on top of him. “And what’s that now?”
Steve reached for one of the hidden letters, turning it around and looking at the inscription. That definitely wasn’t Tony’s handwriting. It almost looked angry, cold and—
“It’s not about the Accords!” Tony suddenly hissed it so fiercely Steve took a step back in surprise. “All of this, it wrecked everything! Don’t you get it? You’ll have to
“Probably not,” Strange said. “But you can never truly predict the impact of your actions, can you?”
Fury’s jaw tightened. “Alright. I call for further investigations,” he said, looking back at each of them, then at Tony. “I’ll have to consult legal authorities, Mister Stark. Until then, we’ll bring you to our Headquarter.”
But it was too late. Steve had already vanished, his fingers brushing Tony’s one last time, almost gently. And Tony…
She rolled her eyes. “Please. Just making an exception for the special ones.”
“Yeah, come for me,” Tony bid him hoarsely.
, Tony declared, then,
His son looked at him with his big azure blue eyes that were one hundred percent Steve’s, and smiled. A real smile, all big and happy.
Tony offered an annoyed grunt and pleadingly thrust forward. “Need to come. Please.”
Steve let his gaze sweep across the room, landing on a little monitor that held on old picture of Arnim Zola from the time when Steve had taken him prisoner in 1943. “His name was Arnim Zola. He was a German scientist who worked for the Red Skull,” he explained slowly. “He’s been dead for years.”
“Still can’t believe we all live here,” Steve said from behind Tony as they walked back to the elevator.  “Though, Natasha told me my last apartment got shot up by my non-dead best friend.  That seems to be something of a job hazard for us, come to think.  You sure you’re okay with that? Having a literal A-shaped target on your building, I mean. After what happened in California…” Steve trailed off as they entered the elevator.
Too long.  It had been too long.  He’d come too close to losing this.  He was shaking. Small, hitching breaths of it at first that seemed to struggle to get out of his throat.  Then deeper, lower, shuddering breaths that sounded like the last part of a scream.  He knew that sound.  The one your body kept making when it didn’t know it was out of air.  He wanted it to stop. Wanted to make it stop.  It didn’t seem like something he could stop, though, because every effort he made to make himself stop left him shaking even more violently.
“Me?” Tony said.
“Answer your letters, Tony,” Steve laughed.  He curled himself back over his sketch, holding the charcoal stick against his lip for a moment, then setting back to his drawing while the scratch of Tony’s quill against paper and the crackle of the fire set a pleasant buzz in his mind.
“That’s true.  I had no idea I would be getting someone like this when we Bonded,” Steve said back to him, though the way he said it, all soft and husky, like the words were pulled from deep inside, torn and broken a bit on their way out.  “Tony, look at me.  Please?” he asked, thumb tracing a line back and forth over Tony’s cheekbone.
to keep you safe.  I can’t lose you,” Tony ground out, standing up so quickly, the stool’s wheels spun it back into the legs of the worktable with a metallic clang.  “I need to be ready,” he muttered, nodding his head for emphasis. “For the next time.  For what’s coming.  And it is coming, Steve.  I’ve seen it.  This wasn’t a one and done, dammit, you know that!”
“Not that I don’t appreciate what he did,” Steve assured him so quickly, Tony wasn’t sure if he quite believed him or not.   “Must’ve been proud as punch of you, though,” Steve said with a slight smile as he looked over his shoulder at Tony.  “I read your file.  M.I.T. and all that,” Steve continued, pushing off the window and turning back to Tony.  “I’m sorry about what happened to them.  Your parents.  I’m sure they would have loved to be able to see what you’ve accomplished.”
“Sure,” Tony answered warily.  I’ve been designing advanced weapons systems while you shopped for toiletries I don’t need.  All in all, a great day.  Probably shouldn’t say that out loud, though. “Fine.”
“What was that, Barton?  I couldn’t hear you over all the not thinking about new arrow designs I was doing,” Tony called out over his shoulder.  Clint just stepped into the elevator car and saluted Tony with the arrow as the doors slid shut.
“It’s barely eight in the morning, Tony, but, yes, I’m on it,” Pepper responded with a thread of exasperation in her voice.  “The resignation paperwork has been drawn up.  I’ll deliver it personally this afternoon.  If there’s a problem, I’ll let you know.”
“Let me out.  I’ll walk,” Steve deadpanned, giving Rhodey a withering look.
“I—well.  I mean, yeah.  I—you, too, you know,” Tony stammered.  “Yeah.  I--you, too.” He sounded surprised, which hurt, Steve could admit, but he sounded pleased, too.  He cleared his throat once, then again, almost like he couldn’t quite catch his breath.  Steve’s chest tightened, warmed, filled to near brimming with the force of it.  He loved this man, broken and wondrous as he was.  “Number, ah-“ he coughed.  “Number four’s kids.  Just saying.”
Thanks again to everyone reading along!  Very much appreciate the comments and kudos. I'm not able to reply, but that doesn't mean that I don't do a twirly little happy dance with each one.
“I believe that,” Stark nodded, a slight smile slipping out before it was quickly muted.  “But, that’s a reflex answer because you view this as a hypothetical. Say there was real money behind it.  Let’s say, I’m not kidding. A million dollars.  The night would come and go, but the money could last a lifetime. Think of it.  A million dollars--a lifetime of security. For one night.”
“Didn’t know you were already Bonded,” Rumlow offered in a placating voice, looking down and away.  “Sorry, man.  Congrats, though.  That’s great, really.  Hey, who’s the lucky O?  Anyone I’d know?  Must be a helluva Omega, huh?”
“You went through my stuff?” Steve asked quietly, his hands gripping the seams of the red backpack that was laying, partially open, on top of the desk.
, but I know,” Tony replied, sounding slightly frustrated.  He pulled back slightly, looking up at Steve from the shadow of the stairwell.  “How about we get out of here, what do you say?  Find a coffee shop or, I don’t know, go back to the Tower, whatever you want.”
The silence that rang and dissolved around Tony in tinny circles felt as if it wanted to choke him.
She glanced to the pillow on his bed, then back at him. “Get some sleep, now. Or do I have to knock you out?”
“Then finish it,” Steve murmured, clinging to consciousness. Clinging to anything—
Steve nodded at that, because of course it would be SHIELD, goddamnit, then he put his hands on both of Tony’s shoulders, shaking him out of—wherever he was. “We gotta get out of here right now,” he ordered. “Not up for discussion. Come on.”
he remembered himself saying.
Merry Christmas everyone! <3
“You were one step from drooling,” Tony said, leaning up and brushing his lips over Steve’s. His hands slid over his back, nimble fingers massaging his skin through Steve’s shirt. “Can I?” he whispered, sliding his hands down to the hem of his shirt so he would not mistake his intent.
Still. Tony realized he’d take all that if only Steve wouldn’t be sitting here all night, drowning himself in whatever morals-misery he’d conjured up in his mind.
Tony recognized the instant Steve became aware of him. The instant he remembered everything that had happened. And, while Tony was prepared for almost every reaction—disappointment, hurt, despise—Steve’s eyes only found Tony's with sleepy relief, and banished all of his worries at once.
Then, however, something strange happened. Within seconds, the shock leaked from Steve’s eyes and something everyone at LAPD had dubbed “Detective Rogers’ Look of Disappointment” appeared on his face.
Last chap will be up sometime next weekend. If I can make it online after watching IW, that is.
The words were not even out of his mouth before he felt himself blushing for real.
It was gone in a blink.
“I thought I could at least say goodbye to Rhodes,” Tony said, unable to contain his annoyance. He’d known Obi would be like this as soon as Tony got his papers and he could finally dig his claws into him but still… He surely could at least wrap things up here on his own time, right?
you could have done to prevent this. You went there because we knew Rumlow had been up to something. We traced him, we got proof, and we decided to hunt him down. If you hadn’t been there, God knows what he would have done.”
Tony frowned and reached forward to dig in his other pocket. This time he found the right key. Steve held him steady as he unlocked the door. It took several tries, but eventually he got it open. He all but carried Tony inside and set him on the bed, trying to be quiet, so not to wake the others.
Steve heaved a frustrated sigh, racing harder, faster, pushing beyond his body’s capabilities. For the moment, the man had the advantage, and he was using it well. This was no human speed, not by far. Steve’s thunderous paces quaked beneath his feet. The world was spinning as he pushed the shield and himself through the first door, sending it to the ground. He cursed, nearly falling over as he sharply turned around the next corner.
Tony exhaled slowly and regained his breath. He squeezed Steve’s hand lightly. “I think you shouldn’t be so hard on yourself. You’ve braved yourself into things this far.”
Tony frowned a bit with the way Steve pressed his eyes close, a look of firm concentration etched into his features. He knew Steve would tell him if he didn’t want him to go on, and anyway… it
It was… it shouldn’t surprise Steve. Dammit, it surely shouldn’t leave him open-mouthed and outright
Tony inhaled a shaky breath. “This ends tomorrow, doesn’t it?”
“It seems very far away, doesn’t it?” Pietro asked, once again glancing out of the window.
Tony came to stand in front of Steve’s room. For a weird moment, he didn’t know if he should knock, but figured Steve wouldn’t answer him either way, so he just pushed the door open and walked in.
“So, talk it over,” Ross told them.
Well, that was really comforting. Steve turned to run into the building at full speed. What he hadn’t anticipated at all, however, were another good dozen HYDRA goons stepping out from the entryway. They had their guns drawn and were completely dressed in black, even their faces were masked. At first, Steve assumed they were additional back-up. At least until one of them stepped aside and revealed—
Steve nodded, as he let his gaze wander over the meadow. After days of rain, the weather had finally calmed down. It didn't exactly reach summerlike temperatures, but the sun was casting a nice warmth down on them.
“10 seconds.”
So much contempt flooded his tone that nearly all of them flinched. Tony glanced up at Bucky and while the man fought to keep his expression neutral, Tony could see his jaw tensing. There had never been an official death toll before, and that really wasn’t something Tony’d wished for him to know.
If that didn't wake him properly, nothing would.
That was one of those conversations he’d hoped to delay as long as possible.
“In the flesh. Or, no, not yet. Not this… chrysalis. But I’m ready. I’m on a mission.”
Tony pointed a finger at Fury, shoving it right into the middle of his tie. “Would you prefer people lose faith in superheroes all together? You were the one who said we were needed. We have to win back people’s respect.”
But so far, Tony had been nothing short of perfect. He’d shown Steve the world—or at least more of it than Steve had ever expected to see. He’d told him stories about each landmark they’d come across, or simply sat next to Steve while he tried to capture it on paper.
tell him not risk his life when it was obviously for the greater good.
“The world will see a new day without either of your help,” Natasha said. She pushed herself off the wall and walked over to him, a hand on his shoulder. “You’ve done enough.”
Tony snorted, raising his hands. “Apparently? How would I know?”
“It’s my secret superpower,” Steve confessed, and brushed his nose along Tony’s.
“Exactly! We
It took a while for Tony get comfortable, but he was a good driver, after all. Steve’s mind started drifting off and eventually, even Coca-Cola didn’t keep him from getting sleepy. “Should be there soon, right?” he mumbled, and Tony hummed in agreement. He sounded entirely too cheerful. Then, he blinked.
Tony supposed this was interesting to anyone who entertained the idea of ghosts. However, he spent the most of the hour-long-tour rolling his eyes and scowling at Steve for bringing him here in the first place.
—would feel goddamn wonderful.
Steve returned the pressure he was applying. “You’re not gonna tell me, are you?”
walked in on
Tony raised a brow, clearly surprised. “You don’t have to say that just to make me feel better.”
“Can I…?” Steve asked, his voice raspy as he stared down at Ian, who was raising his chubby little arms expectantly.
—the one he'd told Bucky he would pursue, the quiet life—he didn’t want to ruin it.
But Dummy was already speeding across the next room and now that Steve had stepped into it, he saw that there was indeed an open pathway towards the beach.
The rhythm Steve set was tender—he couldn’t help it. After the hints Tony had dropped about his first and only time, he couldn’t do rough. Not the first time they did this.
That was… unexpected.
Enjoy this final plot chapter.
first.”
Tony nodded, then nodded some more. He half expected to suffer from a seizure any moment, because his brain just didn’t manage to wrap itself around this.
Tony cringed, and he was probably making it worse instead of actually confessing what he felt, but he couldn’t really do better. Not yet.
. They had so little time with each other, just the two of them. And Steve wanted to see him happy, wanted his smiles, his breathy little laughs, his manic energy.
It was the only thing to hold on to.
Steve was at a loss for words and neither of them spoke for a long moment, watching the oven as it baked the pizza with its fiery heat.
“I got that reference,” Steve stated and laughed when Tony tried to glare at him. “Am I Heath Ledger in that analogy?”
Steve just hugged him, and when Tony's voice faded, he finally kissed his cheek. "You don't have to say anything back."
“Ohh,” Tony gasped. “He didn’t do that yesterday.”
Steve turned around, letting his eyes sweep over the cave walls. He spotted Zemo behind a glass door, staring at them impassively. So he had killed the Winter Soldiers. The guy didn’t look gleeful, though, or overly excited. He just looked at Steve numbly as he came to a stop in front of the door that separated them.
“Goddammit, Tony!” Steve shouted, his tone hard. “That is exactly the problem! ‘One of my little group debates’? Is that really something you find so ridiculous? That I would like to be let in on things beforehand and not have a psychotic robot suddenly try to kill me in the middle of a party?!”
TS 3:22 A.M.>God, Rogers. You’re killing me
The steps were coming closer, and when they came to a stop right behind him, Tony noticed a scent in the air, and it grew with identity and made his heart pause.
With a soft sigh, Tony finished towel drying his son’s hair and wrapped a towel around him, then scooped him up and carried him over to the bedroom.
“Don’t know what triggered me.” Bucky’s voice was soft and frightened, and almost so quiet that even Steve couldn’t hear him. “I was just warming up a bottle for Ian and someone in that stupid movie said something and I…” He shook his head, pressing his eyes closed.
Steve ran across the path leading towards the bay. The sky was still illuminated by thunder, and the ocean looked almost angry as it whipped against the cliffs. And no matter how fast Steve ran, the bay seemed a thousand miles away.
Tony rolled his eyes. “It’s not a move to get you naked, if that’s what you want to know. Your husband was very specific on what you could take with you, and that’s… nothing. Sorry.”
“Oh, fuck off.”
Despite the fact that Natasha had meant those words to soothe Tony, Steve knew the second they had left her mouth that Tony would, in fact, freak out right now.
How do you fight someone who’s… everywhere? Who’s the very essence of being himself?
Thus, his body followed first instinct and walked over to Steve, who was now sitting alone at the bar, clearly not in the mood for talking, and still with a slight scowl on his face.
A small shiver rippled across Tony’s skin and his breath hitched slightly, encouraging Steve to roll his hips against him, making them both groan.
Steve’s plan was good, no question—nearly infallible with everyone’s cooperation, and that was what made Tony nervous. They were always relying greatly on absolutes, and he couldn’t help reciting all those other possibilities.
Those few stolen hours might be all he had left.
"See this?" Bucky pointed to his missing arm. "I'm a disabled man, Steve. I need escort." And there was no venom in his voice, nor his expression. If anything, the tilt of his head and quirk of lips read more like amusement. "This is non-negotiable so get your ass off that couch. Thirty minutes. Go."
Barnes had finally settled in and little by little, his attitudes began to change. His suffering didn’t alleviate, but his ability to tolerate it progressed by leaps and bounds. There was a yearning in his eyes that hadn’t been there before—a yearning to know, to take part in the life happening around him.
Tony winced and looked at Steve. “I don’t mean being gay. Hell, I know it’s not
Tony looked up, frowning as if he hadn’t understood him properly. “What do you mean?”
So gloriously wrong.
, not his dreary reality.
“Ah,” Tony said, momentarily flustered. “Well—We can always buy something. Or we make do with what we have, right? We managed pretty well the last time.”
* * *
“Ah,” Steve replied, mimicking his smile. “I’ll remember that next time we’re sparring.”
“You can’t override it?”
The interior, the light, the smell of the air, and—
him. Today’s events hadn’t changed that.
A sigh rolled off his shoulders. “He’s still wrong about this. He’s been wrong about this since I met him.”
Steve and Bucky were out helping the movers with their bed—a situation full of nonstop funny as far as Tony was concerned—while he and Rhodey tended to the more tedious aspects of moving day. Tony acknowledged that it was likely a bit cruel to have Bucky move something that he didn’t want to even consider in relation to him and Steve, but similarly, he enjoyed the hell out of it.
He really didn’t know how to react when he closed his eyes and found himself in the strange room again. He’d never had the same dream twice before, and every detail was exactly the same.
I'm deeply sorry that it took me so long to post a new chapter to this. I plan to post the final chapter in the next couple of days, tho, so you won't have to wait as long again!
“If I had to guess: they just don’t want to lose face; having to admit they have to rely on a potentially unstable group of super humans. But they can’t just say so, and instead bring up personal shit from my past as if that has anything to do with the Initiative.”
“I can’t! I…” He pulled away from her and, with one hand, picked his tablet off the table. “Yesterday, I was trying to make a simple grocery list for him, but all I could do was stare at this blank document. I kept thinking about what I’d need to make meals, only I realized I don’t know how to make the things Ian likes without a recipe, and Steve never left any. He had them all in his head, and I never asked because I thought I wouldn’t
And maybe they’d do this. Raising a kid and—
. No one mistrusted her, and it was easy for her to gain access to all areas every minute of every day.
He had come to love those eyes fiercely, and now, they were empty. And they stayed that way when Tony’s gauntlet crashed right into Bucky’s face.
“I really can’t believe you,” Tony said, shying away from Steve as he tried reaching for him. There wasn’t much room to maneuver on the steep trail however, and he ended up almost stumbling into the greenery. Steve caught him around the waist, pulling him near even as Tony glared at him. “You’ve gotten us lost in the middle of nowhere,” he complained.
. The rest of the plans had gone through with no difficulties, but as soon as they tried to step out of the facility for that walk…
The thing about being awake in the middle of most nights and talking on the phone with your assumed enemy was that it made you awfully introspective.
Tony groaned as he stretched. For centuries, pain had been such a foreign sensation. Only when meeting Steve, his immortal skin had suddenly hummed with awareness, making Tony feel alive, maybe for the first time ever. Steve had made him vulnerable, not just physically, but an all-encompassing vulnerability that transcended everything Tony had ever experienced.
Only when Jocasta gently reminded him that he’d just torn through the last available bag, he dropped his hands and just… stopped. He shuffled over to the showers and let the scalding hot water fall down on him.
nice dinner, which was overpriced in a way that still had Steve’s toes curl, but he could admit he loved seeing Tony’s eyes twinkle whenever he tasted something he liked, and they hadn’t been to a nice restaurant in ages, so Steve guessed they could indulge in a little luxury.
Natasha glanced up at Tony. There was a cold pause as they stared each other down. “Some cards better stay hidden until the time is right.”
Steve knew the last year hadn’t been easy, the loss of Extremis forcing Tony to once more learn how to function without the ability to perform inventions and improvements at his fingertips. On the other hand, there was the government, calling him over to DC almost every other day. And there was Ian.
A shuddering breath left Steve’s lips and he looked equally relieved.
It was hard to find words for how much he’d hoped to hear those three words from Tony. He hadn’t dared to hope that someone like Tony could ever love someone like Steve. And now that he had them, he didn’t know what to do with it.
Walking into the facility felt surreal. After witnessing those horrors, they now stepped out of the Quinjet and everything seemed as if nothing had happened. The walls were the same, the furniture was the same, it smelled the same, felt the same, and when Steve heard his team talking in the distance, his eyes watered.
True to his promise, Tony arrived at T’Challa’s palace around noon next day. T’Challa was there to greet him, and in under one minute, Ian roused the first laugh Steve had ever heard T’Challa make out of him.
Steve said nothing because he knew his voice would break. He wished he had Tony’s way with words. But it felt like a good time for some of that action he was usually so big on.
Tony smiled. “I’ve been right here.”
“What he feels for you, it’s… more than he’s ever felt for anything or anyone,” Natasha added softly. “You understand what that means, right?”
“Thaddeus,” Phil exclaimed. Everyone fell quiet as he walked up to their guest, shaking his hand with an easy-going smile.
So this was apparently happening now. For a moment, he was a bit unsure about what he should be doing with his hands, if it was truly alright to touch Tony like he wanted to.
Bucky cast Barton a pointedly broad smile, pulled the door shut and locked it.
“Oh, look at you,” Tony said, laughing, when Ian glanced at them sleepily. He sat down next to Steve and brushed a finger along the baby’s forehead, stopping at his mouth when it made some suckling motions.
"What you're suggesting is… It's too risky for me," he added, and immediately knew this would backfire. He knew he shouldn't be saying anything to give any illusion that he might be interested but he couldn't bring himself to lie. "I'm sorry."
To his credit, Steve only paused for a second when he stepped inside. His body stiffened and Tony could hear a small sigh, before he walked around one of the torn Iron Legion suits, and set Tony down on the still mostly intact bed.
other than the feeling of his arms wrapped around him, but it seemed fruitless.
Tony still hadn’t gotten used to this, to Steve looking at him like this and kissing him whenever he felt like it, and it made his heart race in a way that was both frightening and exhilarating. “You won’t regret this later and hate me forever, will you?”
“I didn’t ask for this, either!” Steve stood up once more and turned away, shaking hard. He really wished he could just walk through that door and be done with it. “Don’t pretend it’s been just hard on you, Tony. I would’ve sacrificed
Trying to block one of Tony’s punches, Steve’s fist hit his shoulder hard and it knocked him backwards.
, anyway.
“‘m glad we got to be friends,” Tony said, raising a hand to Steve’s cheek.
Strangely enough, while their conversations were still tense, still agitated, they both seemed to be more willing to actually listen to the other’s standpoint, at least—most of the time.
Rhodey gave him a look when he returned. “We need you strong now.” He shoved the plate into Tony’s hand, holding the coffee at arm’s length. “Eat. Then drink your coffee.”
What the
“I… I was told you couldn’t.”
“We can’t. Not right now.” A sigh from Steve. “Ross won’t believe a word we say, and we have to find out what the game plan is before something happens. We’re on our own.”
have been anyone else, Tony. It's only you." He took a shaky breath and let it out slowly. "The triggers, the visions… it’s
Not anymore.
“You wouldn’t have,” Tony said, not unkindly, then cleared his throat. “And to be fair, it wasn’t anything you could have reasonably agreed to—not anything we could have discussed by looking at pros and cons. It was… the logical conclusion of everything that has happened to us so far, a look into the future, if you will. The Chitauri was just the beginning when it comes to us against an infinity of otherworldly threats, and I
“The truth,” Tony said. He quirked a smile. “Or do you want to say that I’m lying to our baby?”
“He’s
Baffled, he could only stare at the man. Then he looked down at himself, staring down to where some sort of metal arm—some
When the glass door opened, Obi merely glanced up at them; He nodded and held up a hand to signify his need to end the call. Tony nodded in turn, and steered Steve in the direction of the worktable.
He was met with six bemused smiles. Bruce shrugged, saying, “Well, that’s really not going to be a problem.”
, Tones,” Rhodes said and stood up. He leaned over to where Natasha was holding Ian, smiling down at him. “We’ll keep the little nugget entertained, won’t we? You love hanging around your Ol’ Namesake, don’t you, buddy?”
They were both sitting on the benches in the hallway now. The clock next to Bucky’s room was ticking away, loud and relentless, making it hard to ignore how long Tony and Bruce had been in there by now.

, a nothingness.
proud,” Steve confirmed. “You did make me very happy. You always do.”
“Well, he married you,” Bucky said. “So of course he pined after you at some point.”
The man’s name sent a shiver down Steve’s spine. “He was very… informative,” he said diplomatically.
Heck, Tony even
* * *
Steve glanced up when he caught movement out the corner of his eye. He instinctively covered the note and pulled it towards himself, not wanting anyone to see what he was writing, but when he saw Tony's face all other thoughts flew out of his head. What the hell happened?
And therefore, one day might as well have been years he’d spent without Steve. He hadn’t just missed him while they were apart, he’d felt the longing so intensely strong it amounted to physical pain. For one day, he’d lived in the fear of Steve’s abandonment, and now that he welcomed him back into his embrace—Tony felt an overwhelming sense of gratitude and relief.
Tony stood in the doorway and watched as Steve started to shave off his beard.
Tony rolled his eyes. “What, KGB records?”
Steve was entirely unable to hide his smile. “Me? I’m the one with the…” He cleared his throat, “punctuality issue?”
Tony stilled momentarily, and the feel of his fingertips on him brought gooseflesh to Steve’s skin. “Well,” he said at last and grinned when Steve raised a brow at him in question. “I did always love a challenge.”
It would be easy to blame everything on SHIELD and Stark Industries. After all, it was the combination of their time-consuming jobs that had them both make the decision to live in different cities for a couple of months. In the end, though, it had been he who’d said yes to Fury and sometimes… and it was probably weak to feel like it… he regretted that decision.
Okay, so, his Alpha was not unattractive.  He’d have to be blind not to notice.  Blind, living on another planet under a rock at the bottom of a frozen ocean of nitrogen.  So, basically, your standard unable to observe.  Looked like Steve had just come from one of those perfect jogs that somehow managed to leave him looking like he’d stepped out of some workout video, glowing with just the right sheen of sweat, hair slightly mussed by the wind, and wearing workout clothes that were doing the Lord’s work.
“Did you just—” Tony started, then broke off at Rhodey’s exaggerated, wide-eyed look.  “Fine, fine, I’m calling him.  I feel your silent judgment.”
“Look, Tony, I get that Barnes is probably all over this whole thing with you and Steve like white on rice, and who can blame him? From where he’s sitting, this has to be a lifeline.  But, bringing him into this, I don’t know, man,” Rhodey warned with a heavy sigh.
Bucky just shook his head. “Quit trying to fix the past, Steve! That’s not how it works. You’re not fixing shit, and sure as hell aren’t fixing yourself,” he ground out, a muscle flexing in his jaw at the effort. “You’ve got a real chance to build something new here. But you gotta walk away from this. All of this. I’m not saying don’t fight when it has to be done, but there’s always going to be another fight, Steve. Always. It’s never going to be enough.   Never. Stop using the chance to die as a substitute for actually living ,” Bucky said vehemently, sweeping his hands out in front of him, sending the shadows on the wall of the tent to dancing.
“See? He believes you now,” Bruce grumbled.
“No, no—I—I know you mean what you say, Tony, I do.  I just…you make everything sound so easy, Tony, but people change. Things happen that you can’t predict, and what then?  What about what your future consort thinks of all this?  Your children?  You’ve told me how you watched your mother and father live separate lives, how confused you were by their indifference to one another…is that truly what you want?” Steve pressed.
“Something amiss, my treasure?” Tony asked in a light, teasing voice.  “Just trying to make sure you are…up and about this fine morning,” he continued, clearly amused.
Natasha grinned back and shrugged. “Steve’s a trooper.”
“But—”
It was terrible. And beautiful in its power.
. Because Tony and him were going to get
“I’d be more grateful if you could stop pestering me about fucking
“No,” Tony shook his head reverently and looked back up to the hole in the sky. In a moment of complete clarity, he knew that he wouldn’t remember everything. But that was alright, too.
"What are you going to do?"
needed to fuck me like three weeks ago,” Tony interrupted Steve. The thoughts going through Steve’s head were obvious, and that just wouldn’t do. He wouldn’t have him decide to be reasonable about this, to go back to—what had they even been doing—
“Well… yes.”
“You… fell… for me?”
"We need to get you out of all this. Think you can help me?" At the very least, the material looked sturdy enough to be put to other uses.
Tony’s eyes snapped back in the direction they’d come from and zeroed in on the red and blue cradle. “Steve,” he breathed, tapping Steve’s naked shoulder gently. The guy didn’t even twitch. ‘Light sleeper’ my
but polite enough. For a moment, he pondered if beating around the bush would make this any easier, then decided that the direct approach usually worked best with Obi, and cleared his throat. “My boyfriend, actually,” he said, raising his shoulders in a ‘Yeah, I know’ gesture, and trying for a smile.
“Tony…” Bruce said, though he was smiling.
“Yeah. He’s… adjusting,” Steve replied. “Observing everyone, all the time. And sticking close to Wanda.”
Steve swallowed. “Thank you.”
“Huh,” Tony offered, leaning back on the chair. “That was easier than I expected.”
"Dr. Banner," Steve said, turning to Bruce. "Did Tony ever dispose of that bulb you brought him?" And he knew the answer because he'd been there last, but he had to ask, and saw Bruce frowning.
“I’m not asking you to trust him blindly, Steve. I’m asking you to cut him a little slack.”
Flecks of red appeared all around his vision. There was something… penetrating… his head, his mind, flowing into his thoughts and… Oh, this couldn’t be good, Steve thought, and the next thing he knew,
Steve kissed his shoulders, his arms holding him tight, their breathing settled into something resembling normalcy. He realized his hands were shaking when he tried to turn Tony around, gathering him close and holding him in the aftermath. Tony burrowed into his arms, his hand reaching for him, drawing it over his side.
At that, Steve cocked a brow and after a moment’s consideration, he leaned back, giving the mentioned area a long, thoughtful glance before nodding his consent. “True.”
“Guys, come on. I can hear the smacking,” Clint said with a little whiny noise.
That. Goddamn. Phone.
The Hulk looked far more enraged, and far more violent than Tony had ever seen him before. If the others would only have half the mind to pay attention to him, they’d know that Bruce was faking it. The fact that he was able to control the Hulk like this was making Tony insanely proud, but he guessed that didn’t quite matter right now.
And that, Steve thought, is why teenagers weren't supposed to drink. It made them irrational to the point of pain. Steve only took a moment to recover from the shock. He'd never been so angrily dismissed, aside for a few occasions with Bu—that was a bad direction to go.
“Oh God,” Steve whimpered, arching upward and urging his cock deeper inside Tony’s mouth.
, wasn’t it? Almost instantly, his gaze wandered across the motel room, across the abstract painting, and for some reason, he couldn’t doubt Tony’s words. The room, everything had always seemed just the tiniest bit off, like it was something that didn’t belong in Steve’s world.
Tony was standing in front of the mirror, more staring into middle distance than actually looking at his attire.
Strange nodded. “That’s not uncommon. The flow of time has always been unsteady at best.”
Almost blindly, Tony reached out. The relief inside him was fierce and all-consuming, and some innate part of him had to touch Steve. When his hand found Steve’s shoulder, he nearly crumpled at the raw strength that coursed beneath his fingertips.
“That’s not a no,” Steve said, because if he’d learned
Steve visibly reined his frustration in, his voice trying to stay even. “I know we’re not perfect, Tony, but the safest hands are still our own. I don’t see how—”
Of course, there was every chance he might die today, and if he didn’t—he simply didn’t want to lose anyone else.
“Good.” She probably couldn’t look more satisfied if she tried. “You holding up?”
“But…” Bucky started, leaning closer to Steve’s ear, “what about Peggy? And Sharon? You were so sickeningly in love with them…”
Tony frowned, as if he had completely forgotten about their argument on the balcony. Then, when the memory seemed to come back to him, he shook his head. “Oh, Steve… You did nothing wrong,” he murmured. “I just… I lost my head. It wasn’t your fault. It’s me who should be apologizing.”
. Steve’s visions… not so much. He was sure he would've remembered wearing full centurion gear, and he would've
“I’ll go looking through the ruins again,” Tony said, after they had finished. “Try and see if I can find some food, or blankets.”
“Tony!” Steve hissed. “That’s what he wants! Stop!”
Tony didn’t seem bothered. “Yeah, well, marrying a man—and me of all people—might’ve put a little damper on your political popularity, but the people adore you, and they know that. You’re still every bit America’s beacon of hope, now more so than ever, and trust me—if you offer, they will plaster themselves on you before you can even start quoting the Constitution’s first article.”
He was far out of his comfort zone, and he’d always been scared by that. Feeling so strongly about someone was both the most exhilarating and the most frightening thing in the entire world.
“I would agree with you if there weren’t things well beyond human imagination threatening the world. You and I, we both have seen what is out there. We have seen what kinds of evils are waiting to dig their claws into Earth. And as long as we are our only defense system, we
“You haven’t,” Natasha said, more forcefully. “And even if that were the case, Steve’s a big boy. He’s making his own decisions.”
Another punch. And one more. With no mind to go up to his newly assigned guest room, he went on punching. He just went at it aimlessly, remembering a time when the scariest thing in his life had been Red Skull.
Slowly, Steve opened the door and walked inside the room that had been his favorite place in all these last months. The workshop itself was empty, but that didn’t surprise him much. On his way to the adjoining room, he petted Dummy’s claw, smiling at the short whirring sound, then moved further.
Tony smiled and leaned further into Steve. So that’s how it was. He was,
, he wrote down. Then, for some inexplicable reason—
“And Steve’s definitely home?” Tony asked, while leaning back in the driver’s seat.
He cupped Tony’s cheek reverently.
Steve groaned. He briefly put his face in his hands, felt his cheeks flush slightly. “It’s none of your business, Natasha.”
“Then perhaps it wasn’t about beating the storm,” Jarvis retorted. “As I said, she—”
Tony swallowed hard and gathered himself. If he wavered, he would collapse with Steve still around him, and never let him go.
amazing,” Steve breathed and turned his head to look at him. “Never felt so… I think I nearly blacked out.”
Clint raised a brow as he looked at Tony. “You put me back on the team?”
Tony bit his lower lip, a little dazed, and honestly a little short-breathed, as he leaned up on one elbow, staring down at Steve.
about everything he did. He’d spent hours upon hours with helping Steve with his physics test, even though he must’ve been bored to tears by the subject, and they’d been talking, always talking, and somewhere along the way, Tony had easily become one of the most important persons in Steve’s life.
“I only said yes after we got married.”
Damn. He hadn’t meant to say it like that. So bluntly. He’d wanted to slowly make Tony understand about his fears and not just throw them at him at once.
The part of Steve determined to keep his heart out of this pseudo-reality had apparently quit on him, and everything became painstakingly real. The feel of his erection pushing into Tony’s mouth, the hot whimpers tearing off his own lips, and the humiliating way his body responded.
That was—that was
“Charming,” Tony replied with a tiny smile. “I’m just tired, it’s fine.”
Tony swallowed. Hard. He didn’t know what to say, because this—this truly was a version of Steve Rogers who loved him. And he had never known a love like this. Somehow, Tony had always felt isolated, imprisoned by his own emotions—feeling alone even when in the company of others.
, if you gonna tease me now, I’ll just—”
That's it, folks!
this is moving forward, but in order to do that, we have to take this step.”
Right now, though, they were basically spitting into each other’s faces.
“Good,” Tony said, “You’ll bring him to his room while I’m at it.”
“It is not a phase,” Tony sputtered, and tried to make Steve stop, “
Rhodey groaned, glancing around uncomfortably. Of course, no one was paying them any attention. Down on the playfield, their team had already scored the first touchdown and Tony rolled his eyes at Steve’s typical little happy dance. Infamous Captain Steve Rogers, Quarterback Extraordinaire, and the guy was easily the world’s biggest dork.
No one said a word when Steve stormed angrily into the RV and simply dropped down on his part of the sofa, clothes and shoes and all.
“Yes,” he said, turning to glance at him over his shoulder again. “I only wish we could stay here.”
And true enough, there had been no remembrance in Tony’s voice. Maybe it wasn’t Tony after all, and his mind was just playing tricks on him?
“I’ll figure it out,” was all he could say, the volume of his own voice jarring him out of the long stretch of silence that spread between them.
“Those one or two disagreements can clearly be overlooked.”
It was a loving sense of being unloved. A moment of love and hate wrapped into something that was purely them.
Bracing himself for another hour of a horrible back and forth of arguments, Tony walked in.
“Are we on the path yet?” Natasha asked, while glancing down on the streets. They had still about thirty miles to go, and the traffic didn’t seem to let up any time soon.
. Let me be proud of all the cool things I can do.”
“If your information is correct,” Tony added. “Who’s your contact, by the way?”
. But I still stand by what I said.”
Steve sighed. "I will put you in bed, but I'm not undressing you," he said, looking away from Tony's face as he entered the building. "Even if you weren't…" he cleared his throat. Maybe mentioning Tony's age wouldn't be the best idea right now. "You're drunk off your ass."
“Wouldn’t expect anything else,” Rhodey said, smiling. “I’m sorry you had to go through all that.”
“No, please don’t,” Tony said, running after him when Steve stormed towards the door, trying to follow. “Steve—
Tony almost bucked off the ground, when Steve edged his finger inside after a moment. “God, you’re gonna kill me.”
This was it. He needed to be aware. Was he aware? How much time had passed already?
Tony laughed. “Oh, I can relate. Imagine my difficulty believing I’m a dad. It’s a whole new world for us, isn’t it, darling?” he asked the sleeping baby in his arms. “You’re the boss now, gotta tell us where to go.”
“It’s true that Indries pushed herself all the time,” Obadiah said, “but she wasn’t stupid about it. The storm would’ve stopped her.”
“You don’t get to scare me away, either,” he told him with a surprisingly strong voice.
The grin turned softer and he looked after her for a moment, before he turned back around to finish the dishes.
* * *
Still. It didn’t prepare Steve for the next words that left Tony’s lips.
In some way, Tony had known that he would find himself here in this place. It had been the most likely outcome. Bucky Barnes had been Steve's best friend to an extent that Tony would likely never understand. He'd just hoped that maybe... Tony frowned. Maybe what? Have Steve call it a night when things didn't go as planned? Have him surrender even though there was still a chance he might actually save his friend?
“Yours and Clint’s, yes. Fury ordered me to secure data from the ship’s server.”
“Maybe,” he confirmed with a smile. “It’s cute.”
They were… they were flirting, weren’t they? Or was Steve not aware of how all of that sounded? It was a possibility, since Steve sure as hell had never made a move on him before.
“’Course you didn’t. I made them long before I became Iron Man,” Tony explained. “As I said, they never made it past prototype. Obviously, I could do much better today, but at the time, those babies were badass.”
And yet, condemning Obadiah Stane had exhausted Tony in a way he had never experienced.
Natasha laughed. “Fair enough.”
and pleading for Steve to not hold back.
The mansion, it seemed, never slept.
…” Sam started, but when Steve turned around and glared at him disapprovingly, he shut his mouth and raised both hands in defense. “Just saying, man. Clint was very graphic. Not that I needed to know which way around you guys are doing it.”
“You are late. Again,” Nat exclaimed as she pointed accusingly at Bucky. “We’ve got to be at the hangar in five minutes.”
Nope, he really wasn’t getting any younger.
“I’m okay,” Steve said and stood up. Tony’s eyes took him in, and now he felt insanely stupid that he hadn’t recognized that wide set of shoulders.
“There’s another missile coming,” Tony called back. “
“No,” she said, even though she made no move to resist him when his tongue darted out to seek entrance to her mouth. Despite her efforts to look and sound unaffected, Natasha always kissed with passion like no other, kissed like she didn’t know if Bucky would save her life or end it, biting and sucking, thrusting against him, exhaling on his lips before diving in again. Bucky almost got lost in the kisses, and that’s why he didn’t realize Natasha took advantage when he loosened his grip on her hands and quickly pushed him off of her.
Bucky winced. “Me. Yeah, I know.”
Tony shrugged. “Thought you flew south, like all those other little birds.”
And Steve wouldn’t know. He would never know, much less believe, how much Tony had cared for him. And that Tony was glad, that—if nothing else—Steve had been at his side during their last minutes. Pepper, Rhodey, Happy… they all knew how much Tony cared for them.
The guy was so in love with her, Steve really doubted that she hadn’t noticed yet.
When they’d started this, Tony had done most of the talking. There was so much he’d needed Steve to hear, things he’d never thought to tell him before. Tony had felt he owed him an explanation for a lot of things. Why he’d wanted to give up Iron Man for Pepper, why he’d built Ultron, why he’d supported the Sokovia Accords. He told him about how hard it had become… how hard
Someone knocked on the door. They both looked up as Rhodey stepped inside, carting a wheelchair in front of him that had Tony heave an annoyed breath. “Ready to go, everyone?”
“Then drop your shield,” Tony said, knowing full well that he wouldn’t. “It’s the only way to end this.”
“You don’t
Tony rolled his eyes. “Well, I don’t like sleeping warm and dry while you’re out there getting wet. We know shit about the climate in this dimension. Feels like it could be getting real cold at night, and when you’re wet, that cold is going to feel a thousand times worse.”
“I’ll show you ‘pencil pusher’ when you’re back home,” Bucky said, and Steve could hear the amusement in his voice. “I seem to remember you wheezing on the gym floor and pleading for mercy.”
“You’ll do great,” Tony whispered, and there wasn’t an ounce of doubt in his voice.
“That’s my favorite tractor!”
Tony grew silent for a second, considering. No, it didn’t matter where they went. As long as they were together nothing seemed to matter. The last few weeks had opened doors Tony had never even considered. And though they might lead down tumultuous paths, he was confident he and Steve could emerge from any conflict better for it.
“I told you I like the stretch. You’re perfect, stop worrying,” Tony echoed. His chest heaved with pants and he forced his eyes open, taking Steve in with his heated gaze. “Are
Tony believed him. Even though Steve never liked Extremis, he knew he hadn’t wanted for this to happen. Only then he saw the horrible burn mark on Steve’s waist, and cursed. “Shit, that was me, wasn’t it?”
And with that, Tony’s mind was suddenly all but thrown back to the room, Extremis fading from his grasp. There was nothing for a beat, as if a wire had been cut, before the connection was forced back online.
The gasp he released upon the first finger was a little exaggerated—they had been doing this not even twenty-four hours ago, and while he wasn’t loose anymore, one finger wasn’t much of a problem. He pressed his lips to Steve’s jawline, moving the digit around a bit before plunging a second inside. His need was definitely too great to keep it slow right now, and everything else quickly blanked out. He thrust the fingers into his body, grinding his cock against Steve’s, eyes soaking up his wide stare.
“I’ll go with them,” Natasha said softly, putting a hand on Steve’s shoulder as she stood up. “You go check on the mad scientists. See if they still got all their limbs attached.”
“He wanted to salvage,” Steve continued. “I told him everything had to go. No deceits, and no middle grounds anymore.”
“I asked her once how she managed to master diplomacy and espionage at a time when no one wanted to see a woman succeed at either,” Sharon said with a small smile. “And she said, ‘Compromise when you can. When you can’t, don’t. Even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right. Even if the whole world is telling you to move, it is your duty, to plant yourself like a tree, look them in they eye and say: No, you move’.”
There was a long pause. Eventually, Tony took a long breath. “I said we’re going,” he ground out. “Rhodey?”
He could nearly weep. “No.”
The last years hadn’t done anything to right his many wrongs, it seemed. He’d been climbing a mountain steadily, and mostly alone since the day he’d returned from Afghanistan. He’d started such a long time ago. A reluctant acceptance in the face of his kidnapping had sealed his fate—the knowledge that the playboy life he’d been leading was over. He’d gone with it because there was no alternative, not for him, not anymore.
Today, he wouldn’t leave his bed. Tomorrow he would deal with the consequences. Tomorrow he would start to pick up what was left of him and try to figure out where he would go from here.
Goddammit, how had all of this happened? How the hell had they gotten to this point?
A quick thought beforehand: I know Civil War is about taking sides, but I want you to know that I didn't. Take sides. I'm seeing just as much reason in Tony's standpoint as in Steve's. That's kinda the beauty and tragedy of it. In the movie, it's basically just a very shitty situation and in my opinion, they didn't have the time or opportunity to settle this issue peacefully. And while there will be scenes and dialogues in this fic that blame certain people for certain things, I want to emphasize: This is NOT my opinion, I'm NOT trying to diss any characters, I LOVE THEM BOTH EQUALLY. These things are said because there will be strong emotions blinding the characters who say them. They might very well realize later that they were wrong to think and say such things. So this is not me blaming anyone for anything, or saying that 'Tony's right' or 'Steve's right'. It'd be wonderful if you'd just bear with me till the end :-)
He’d never imagined that life could be like this for him. To have someone he could simply touch and kiss whenever he wanted.
“I wager you’re gonna piss me off at some point, again,” Tony mused, as Steve eventually pulled out slowly and flopped down on the bed next to him.
Tony crooked a small grin. “Just come by the tower whenever you like. JARVIS will guide you to the top floors. You can move in, or you can just visit sometimes, it’s your call. You’re part of the team now, as far as I’m concerned, and since our leader is out of commission right now, my word’s law.”
“Oh my God, kiddo, it’s the law, okay?”
Everything in Tony itched to take scans of his bionic arm, itched to prod and improve, but he knew a thing or two about objects being stuffed onto one’s body without consent. The arm seemed to be functional for now, and everything else would have to wait until Barnes was awake.
to fuse together. As though once they understood that there was no motive for fighting anymore, they might as well do this instead. Just a different sort of battle—it seemed they couldn’t stop battling each other if they tried.
There was an almost imperceptible nod from Tony, a searching look in the brown eyes, but nothing more. Nothing demanding. Somehow, it made things much easier. “No, it isn’t. But it’s one thing, trying to find out what happened with Bucky, but it’s another altogether if the whole world is trying to stop you while you’re doing that.”
* * 4/29/18, 11:33 AM * *
more,” he whispered back. “You’ll have as much as I can give you.”
“I need to go.” Bucky slips himself free from Sam’s grasp and leaves the room.
Thank God. She was listening.
“I know. I promise not to hurt him.”
Sarah reaches out and places one small hand over Peter’s head. “Ba?”
Yikes their interaction probably could’ve gone a lot better. Poor Peter just wants to know who his dad is and Tony just...yeah. ugh he’s a pain in the butt.
At least Tony can exclude Pierce from all this.
Steve takes a moment to compose himself then he takes a step forward, only to turn around when he hears someone call out for him. Peter is rushing toward him.
Tony smiles. “What else?” He asks, wanting to know more. Despite living with Steve for a few years, he still felt as if he didn’t truly know him. Or at least he didn’t know him the way Peter had.
“I’m sorry,” Steve whispers and more tears escape.
“What?” Bruce frowns. “You saw what happened back there. The building-”
Tony nods and continues to work. He needs a distraction too. “Yeah. It was tough to watch.”
It was just going to take more time.
Tony shifts under Bruce’s uncomfortable gaze. “Uh.” Tony rubs the back of his neck. “He mentioned doing this before.”
“Fine,” Tony gives in, doing his best to ignore the pleased smile that’s plastered on his son’s face. “Five minutes, got it?”
He doesn’t shake him awake this time, and instead, he crawls into bed with him and holds him close. His behavior shocks him but he can’t pull away from the omega. His alpha won’t let him.
“Yes.”
“He’s asleep,” Tony says, smiling down at the sleeping toddler.
Tony doesn’t even wait for Steve to get her, not that he was really expecting him to. Morgan is calmer now that she’s in Tony’s arms, her brown eyes transfixed on his face and warm smile.
“I never did.”
“You were sick. I remember you saying that,” Tony says. He can see the shiny appearance Steve’s eyes had taken.
“I’m sorry.” Steve peers up at Tony with red-rimmed eyes.
Peter is in the kitchen when they get downstairs, chugging down a bottle of water like his life depended on it.
“No, I know he does but…” Tony sighs harshly. “Never mind. You’d have to see it for yourself.”
It hurts when Tony leaves with just Morgan. She’s already asleep once he has her in the car. Tony’s eyes land on the large building, tears threatening to fall at the thought of Steve being in there alone. But this was good for him. This is what had to be done.
Tony sighs. “Fine, I guess. I zoned out a few times. I couldn’t stop thinking about this really great guy.”
Steve wants to go home. He wants to be with his son and curl up with him on the sofa to watch the movie they never got to finish. But the bleeding and intense cramping was alarming and couldn’t be ignored. It was Tony who dragged him to the emergency room. Steve didn’t blame him for caring so much.
“Everyone is already here,” Peter explains as they ascend to their destination. “Just be...um...careful with Uncle Bucky.”
Bruce nods in understanding. He appeared tired himself and Steve suddenly has the urge to ask him to stay. It wasn’t like Tony didn’t have a room to spare.
They share a smile, and it’s at that moment when Steve realizes that not all alphas were bad. There were still some good ones in the world. And he was lucky enough to consider one a friend.
“I love you, too.”
Happy doesn’t budge from where he’s standing. “I’m not leaving you alone with him.”
His husband is in the rocking chair, one elbow propped on the armrest and his head resting in his hand. He’s snoring softly, chest rising and falling with each breath he takes. His other arm is wrapped around the growing bump.
James shakes his head.
“You’re hurting, sir. It’s okay to grieve.”
Steve nods. “I think you need to think it over. It’s a big decision.”
Natasha winces. “You still have...three months. You sure you can wait that long? I’d get checked out.”
Her papa is in the kitchen, sitting at the table with an array of papers and envelopes laid out in front of him. Steve lifts his head from one of the files to send a smile his daughter’s way.
His disguise of a baseball cap and sunglasses didn’t always work, but today he hoped it would pull through. The last thing he wanted was someone to recognize him shopping for baby items.
“That’s so messed up. I’m here for you, though. I’ll even babysit.”
Steve sighs. “Looks like daddy is at it again.”
“Hey, Pe-”
“You won’t. I promise you’ll be out of here soon. You’re getting better, Steve. You may not see it but I do.”
“I wouldn’t say he doesn’t care. He loves her-”
“What if they see me? How do we know all of Hydra is gone?”
Not getting to say his goodbyes was what haunted Tony for years. The last time they spoke wasn’t exactly the happiest. He would give anything to go back and have things turn out differently.
Bucky blows out a breath, doing everything he can not to cry again. Sam senses this and lays a hand over his shoulder, squeezing it reassuringly. He decides to change the subject.
Bruce sighs again. “I can’t be here all the time. If something happens you’ll need to call a doctor here-” Tony rolls his eyes and Bruce frowns. “This is serious!”
“Shh. I’m here, Maguna. Daddy’s here. Daddy won’t leave you again.”
“I miss him.”
“He doesn’t. He has no idea you’re here. And he never will.”
“They were with Steve.”
“Yeah. Hey if you don’t feel up to shopping today then-”
“Yeah,” Steve agrees with a nod of his head. He rises to his feet and crosses the room to get more paper towels. He hands them to Tony. “The baby looks good. I’m happy.”
And to be honest he doesn’t find it very fair. Tony knew he was far from perfect and had made some shitty choices, but the situation he finds himself in isn’t because of all of his doings. Steve wasn’t so innocent.
Steve is exhausted by the time they get back to the compound. He wasn’t used to the fatigue. The serum made sure to take care of that in the past, but as of late he’s found himself struggling with the new changes his body was going through. Now that the pregnancy was over, he thought he would be bouncing back to what he used to be, but he was quickly learning how wrong he was.
“Because you were supposed to be the one to do this part and you can't!”
“Okay!” Peter exclaims before running back to the living room.
Steve frowns. “I’ll bathe him before bed.”
The atmosphere in the space has changed. Everyone else is still going about their morning and continuing their conversations, but Tony notices the way they send worried glances Steve’s way. Steve doesn’t notice, or if he does, he ignores them and goes back to picking at the muffin.
Tony smiles and takes Steve’s hand again, bringing it up to his lips and kissing it. “I’ll pick you up at 6.”
“He needs you too.”
“I hope Steve doesn’t mind,” Tony mutters to himself before making the call.
“That’s so cool! Did he give it to you! Does it smell like him?”
Peter reaches the cemetery and runs toward the familiar gravesite. He stares up at the face of his father, no longer able to keep the tears from falling. Peter glares, his hands rolling into tight fists.
“He would’ve been the greatest,” Peter says and gestures toward the shirt.
Peter shakes his head. “I’m not like you. I can’t do it. I can’t be Captain America.”
“Daddy?” Peter sits up and hugs his bear close. “We really get to keep this baby, right?”
Tony lingers around the nursery, putting away the new items. He can’t help but smile to himself as he pictures bringing his son home and showing him the room they’ve built.
Tony smiles. It falters quickly. He doesn’t want to go. He doesn’t want to leave Steve behind. But this had to be done. Steve needed this.
Tony smiles softly. “I’ll be fine. I don’t want you doing a damn thing while I’m gone. If you need to nest then fine but don’t worry about anything else. I don’t want a phone call in the middle of the night because you’ve gone into labor.”
“Sorry. Just making sure. I know we said we’d move on but-”
“I want him back.”
The moment they finished lunch and returned home, Steve was on Tony in seconds, crashing their lips together in a passionate and desperate kiss. Tony had been shocked at first. They hadn’t been intimate in some time, not that Tony was going to voice his complaints out loud, but he’d be lying if he said he didn’t miss this part of their relationship.
“No,” Sam shakes his head. “I know you won’t hurt us.”
“Let him watch.”
Steve quickly shakes his head at the idea. Even if he tried to talk about it, he wouldn’t make much sense. It wasn’t something he understood himself.
“Tony…”
“Papa?” Peter asks, peering up at Steve again. “Do we get to keep him forever?”
“Don’t tease me, darling. We have four pups that will gladly cockblock us,” Tony reminds.
“You can do this,” Tony encourages and squeezes Steve’s hand. “Come on, Steve. Push.”
Peter hugs Tony tightly. “I love you, Daddy. I’ll give you lots and lots of kisses too.”
Steve chuckles softly. “Yeah? You won’t go crazy?”
Tony watches with a smile.
And even if there was the slightest chance of them becoming mates Steve was sure he had already ruined it. He hadn’t meant to lose his temper in front of the alpha. If it had been anyone else Steve would have been reprimanded in a heartbeat. Disrespecting an alpha was a punishable crime. At least that’s what he had been trained to believe.
“Don’t be...it’s...it’s…” Tony stumbles over his own words. He’s not angry at Steve. It was obvious from Steve’s reaction that he didn’t know about the baby, but it still left Tony wondering how they missed this.
“Hm?” Steve mumbles and his eyes flutter open. He yawns and sits up to stretch. “What’s wrong?”
Steve smiles and gives the bump another kiss before taking his original spot beside Tony and pulling him close. He knows they should probably get cleaned up and change the sheets, but he’s enjoying holding Tony.
“Thanks.” Steve takes the offered glass and brings it up to his lips, taking a small drink.
“Okay.”
“I know but I need you to do it. If I’m right, and I’m pretty sure I am, then...then you can’t stay here.”
“I’m not saying anything. It’s not his decision anyway,” Peter says, though a part of him knows Flash should have a say. He pushes that thought aside. He didn’t need Flash involved.
“He’s mine,” Pierce threatens. “That mark you put there means nothing once you're dead.”
“Are they that bad?” Steve asks.
“Is it making you sick?” Steve asks and Peter nods. Steve gets up and takes both his mug and Tony’s.
Peter says nothing and just continues to cry. Tony holds him close, willing to comfort him for as long as he needs to.
Bruce smiles. “We all would.”
“Then why are we running?”
He was struggling with himself.
Of course Peter would have to be living with him. It wasn’t like he didn’t have the space. He could easily transform one of the spare rooms into a place for his son to crash in or do whatever else the kid likes to do.
Steve rushes to grab the burping cloth when more than just air escapes Morgan’s mouth. Tony doesn’t even care that a bit gets on his hand. He knew babies were messy, and honestly he loved being this hands on. He loved being a dad.
“It’s a...crazy story.”
“What’s wrong, princess?” Tony asks. He drops his current task of making cookies to attend to his daughter, only to stop himself when he realizes his hands are sticky with dough and not acceptable to touch Sarah’s favorite outfit.
“You don’t know how happy I am, Steve.” Tony reaches across the table to take Steve’s hand, brushing his thumb over the wedding band he had put there two years ago. “You and Morgan mean everything to me. I can’t live without you.”
Steve has to turn away to hide his growing blush. And just in time too because he catches Harley climbing up the stage steps and toward the podium.
All but one friend.
“Wow,” Tony can’t help the word that slips out. Steve glances up at him, his lips curving into a small smile. Steve gently brushes his hand against Tony's and Tony flinches, eyes darting down to lock on their hands. He doesn’t pull away.
Tony sighs. “Fine.”
“I gotta go.”
The room remains silent. Tony is relieved.
It wasn’t, at least not entirely. He never considered his unborn child a mistake. Unplanned was what it was. Never a mistake.
Tony gasps dramatically. “You are!” He tickles Peter and the little boy erupts in a fit of giggles. “Is it daddy?”
Tony isn’t looking at him anymore. His gaze is cast down, glued to the stone floor beneath him.
“Where’s Steve?”
Steve prays they don’t notice anything.
“Yes,” Bruce replies with a nod. He steps away from the exam bed to grab his tablet from off the countertop, tapping away on the screen and pulling up the data he’s entered so far. “All your pups are okay.”
Bucky flips Sam off before returning to petting his cat. She meows again and rubs herself against his belly, the strange behavior capturing Bucky’s attention. He ignores it, but something tells him he shouldn’t.
“And it’s not because of her,” Steve says. He answers the question Tony had been wanting to ask. “I swear I’m happy we have her. I just...God, Tony I don’t know how to explain it. I’m sorry.”
Steve watches as they leave, and for the first time, wishes they wouldn’t. The door shuts behind them.
Tony curses to himself when his brain refuses to remember the details. There was an omega, but the image of him is blurry. Tony would never forget his eyes, though. They were the bluest eyes he’d ever seen.
He hears the front door open, followed by the mixed voices of both Happy and Flash. Peter rushes downstairs just in time to catch Happy threatening the kid that’s picked on Peter for years.
“Peter?”
They continue to drive until the city disappears behind them. It only fuels Steve’s curiosity. They never ventured outside of the city; it was their home.
His eyes grow heavy and he shuts them, giving in to the exhaustion that consumes him. He dreams of a time when he wasn’t locked up and abused. Of a time when he was free and surrounded by people he loved.
Peter smiles. “Yeah.”
They fall into a comfortable silence. For a moment Tony believes Peter has fallen asleep. He’s ready to get up and grab a blanket for his son, but then Peter says something he doesn’t catch at first.
“What? This is a party, right? Come on, Pete. Your Pop’s would want to see you having a good time. I know I do.”
“I’m trying to figure everything out. I miss you so much and I wish you could be here to see everyone. We all miss you. And now dad’s back so...it’s what you wanted. I promise to keep everyone together. I promise to make you proud.”
“Tony, you need to rest.”
“Is he okay?”
“I can’t believe...I’m gonna be a dad. Me. I’m not...Steve, I’m not…”
Steve shifts uncomfortably under the doctor’s gaze. Dr. Stephen Strange was intimidating, and not just because of his alpha status, though that didn’t help Steve in the slightest. What makes their first meeting worse is that Tony wasn’t with him for it. But perhaps it was for the best. The last thing Steve needed was two alphas trying to outdo the other.
“I know, but little pups like you need to sleep. And mama and daddy need to sleep. We can play tomorrow.”
“You and me both.”
Tony smirks behind his glass. The donation was never ‘small’.
They break apart and she disappears down the hall. Steve takes a moment to compose himself before going back into the room. Harley is asleep again and Peter has just finished nursing. Bucky is holding him while Tony struggles to clean up the mess Peter has made on his shirt.
“It’s okay. Pete’s gonna be fine.”
Tears are streaming down Steve’s face now. Tony hates seeing the pain he’s putting his husband through, but this pain was necessary. They didn’t need to try again. He was trying to save Steve from more heartache. He was trying to save Steve from himself.
