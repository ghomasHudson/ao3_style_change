"No." Cas brought the beer to his mouth, swallowing a mouthful. "Not together. We're just trying to figure out what being soulmates means for us."
"Okay Perdition. That only adds more questions to the angel link you know." Dean said with a pointed look.
"Don't be mean." Balthazar responded narrowing his eyes at the threat. "Fine, but I am not responsible for what shape he's in!"
Jo dropped the act and smiled at him, dropping down on the grass beside him and leaning against his shoulder. "That's alright. I don't blame you. I blame him!"
The band was surprisingly good. He wasn't usually big on punk rock, but they had a great sound. Unlike most bar bands these guys were well put together, all in tune with each other and if there were any missed or wrong notes, well he couldn't pick them up. He looked more closely at each of the band members. The drummer seemed to use his entire body play, not even his head stayed still for more than a moment. The sight would be amusing if he hadn't caught a glimpse of the guys blond mullet, what the hell man! The keyboardist was a small Asian kid with lightning-fast fingers, Dean could tell even at a distance that the kid was completely consumed in the music only looking up from his instrument to smile at his bandmates. He seemed completely oblivious to the crowd of jumping and dancing fans at his feet. On the electric guitar was a shorter guy with a plunging neckline and a shit-eating grin that danced around the stage playing up the crowd and making sexually suggestive motions to his bandmates which had the keyboardist laughing and the bassist driving him away with a few sassy moves of her own. The bassist was gorgeous women with a leather jacket and high-heeled boots that screamed badass. She was the type of women Dean would be taken with usually, but standing next to the lead singer, she was barely on his radar.
Cas stared at the ceiling, slowing his breathing and reminding himself that Dean wasn't his to play with. "I know I said that I wouldn't interfere but can I ask why so many people have a problem with your relationship?"
"Wait, how do you know he didn't sleep?" Kevin asked, looking up from his keyboard.
"Of course, I could." He said more confidently. "I've never had trouble discussing our debates with you afterwards."
"But that's so far..." Charlie moaned, pulling the pillow over her face.
Dean handed him a coffee cup and what he was assuming to be some kind of burger and motioned for him to follow as he led the way outside and ignoring the calls from a table filled with jocks wearing football jerseys. It struck Cas that Dean was walking away from his usual group for the second time that day to be with him instead. He didn't fight the smile that crept across his face at the thought.
Dean watched as the man chuckled at Bennys interruption, grinning at him over Deans shoulder and tipping his head at Benny in thanks. This had Dean scrubbing a hand across his face swallowing the embarrassment of these two laughing at him.
"You shouldn't have to choose." Cas pleaded quietly, dropping his head to look at his feet, as the guilt washed over him.
"They're doing just fine." He peered at her over the rim of his mug. "You haven't said why you're here yet. You're not planning on arresting the kid are you?"
"So, you're a fag." The guy challenged.
"Exactly!" Cas said with a grimace. "And that will not be repeated again!"
"Staying another night then?" Dean asked handing him a soda as they sat at the edge of the shed watching darkness creep in.
Cas smirked at Charlies scandalized expression and walking around the back, where Dean had opened the trunk to dump his bag inside after fishing his wallet out. Dean pulled off the tie, tossing it in on top of his thing, before undoing the cuffs and holding the cufflinks out to Cas.
"Sure," Dean smiled, "You're not gonna be upset when I beat you right?"
“Fine.” Dean groaned in frustration, pushing himself up off the couch and out of Cass arms. “Stay here.”
"What other plans could I possibly have at this point?" Cas rolled his eyes and listed his reasons on his fingers. "No car. All my friends and usual hangouts are an hour and a half away. I know a grand total of, what, six people in this school?"
"Anti-possession symbol" Dean said, dipping his head to kiss the crook of his neck. "A reminder more than anything, that our choice makes a difference."
All emotion drained out of Castiel's face like colour. Dean watched as his fingers started taping at one of his pockets. The tension in the group had been fluctuating since he had sat down. Now, it was thick enough to cut with a knife. Nobody dared move as they waited for Castiel's response. When he spoke it came out too formally. Too formally to suit the situation. The only one there who wasn't thrown by this change in his speech was Ash.
Cas shrugged, twirling a spanner in his hands as he thought. "I don't know, really. Right now all I want is the chance to spend some time getting to know you and actually seeing if we can be friends without the soulmate label and take it from there."
"We're in!" Charlie grinned.
"Okay. Can't argue with that." He said looking at Cas. "I have a little brother too... I'd probably be worse to be honest”.
Dean looked at it carefully when he was done. It was thick and heavy, clearly designed to look more mechanical than a normal chain, and the face held a similar mechanical look with black stones embedded in the design.
"How do I know if I'm getting it right?"
"You didn't tell me you played." Cas accused, picking up the bag and walking over to the bed, dropping it at his feet as he took the guitar gently from his hands.
Cas gave up. He didn't have much of an argument there either. If Dean had been single, they likely would have crossed that line already, they were having enough trouble staying friends as it was. At very least through the week they couldn't physically touch but get them in the same room and that changed quickly.
Cas shrugged. "Seems fair. I won't date yours if you don't date mine. I don't think I could handle the idea of you and Balth."
"Alright." Balth said slowly. "New bet. Who kills Cassy first? His parents or his girlfriend?"
"Can you dump her for being a bitch instead?" Kevin asked, as Charlie giggled.
"I told you I haven't been laid in months!" Cas grinned. "She hasn't seen me without my shirt since it appeared."
"Any way you want to handle it Sammy." Dean confirmed as Meg smirked at them.
"Am I?" He sighed, without looking at him.
Benny quirked an eyebrow and watched him waiting for a response. Dean swivelled around to where the guy had been standing just moments ago. He took a moment to scan the crowd before it registered that he was gone. Crap. He scanned the bar again thinking he might have missed him in the crowd. Disappointment set in again as a hand reached across to drop a bottle next to his beer.
"You were being deliberately difficult, trying to get out of wearing a tie! I warned you, you push, and I'll push back."
"You cooked; I'll clean." Cas winked at Dean before he could pick up the tea towel.
"He's pretty." Meg stated. “I can see how he grabbed Cassy’s attention.”
Dean let out a breathe of relief, "Really?" he asked with a grin.
Cas stepped into the kitchen properly now, holding his hand out to a still frozen Bobby. "Nice to meet you Sir."
Bobby watched the boys close themselves off as they spoke, Dean keeping his arm tight around Cas.
"Holy shit!" Charles exclaimed loudly as she watched them.
Cas made his way to the lounge looking for his band mates, only to find three at the same table with a surprising addition to their group. He sauntered up to them, kicking the back of Gabriel's chair to get their attention.
Cas drained the rest of his beer slowly, "Yeah I get that. I'm not usually one for crowds either."
"Fuck this!" Adam stood quickly. "I'm leaving!"
Where did you find each other?"
"Alright."
Cas pulled himself away from Dean slowly, brushing his hand against his thigh, as he came to his senses. Dean cleared his throat as he dropped his arm regretfully.
"I was kidnapped." Benny replied looking up at Cas, like he wasn't sure if he had just been rescued or if things had just gotten worse.
"Alright, I'll concede that point. That would suck."
"Be honest with me for a minute, would you?" Meg looked at him seriously now, fingering one of the shots. "Your girlfriend broke up with you for meeting your soulmate. Your soulmate has a girlfriend who he isn't planning on dumping anytime soon. What would you rather be doing tonight?"
Castiel chuckled quietly at their antics as he stared at his phone. Sending Gabriel a quick text to let him know that he was at the tournament and would let him know how it went later.
"Come on. We're not done yet."
"What is it? If I did something wrong...."
"I don't have too much to tell yet. He was on the other team. He's smart and cocky and has no clue how to tie a tie!"
"Are you going to wash me?" He asked cheekily.
"That would be Hannah." Meg said turning to give her order to the barista.
"Who is this?" Sam asked, unsure of who had picked up. "Where is Castiel?"
Ellen shrugged. "Depends on what she has tucked away. Their lawyers will help them find a place to live within their means while the case takes place. I doubt it'll be like what they're used to, but they'll adjust."
"At what point do you realise that she won't change?" Charlie asked softly. "She flipped the switch the moment you started hanging out with us. What are you going to do after finals? Go back to being a jock and ignoring us? Just to please her?"
"You're going to teach me?" Cas asked curiously.
Cas smacked the back of Ash's head before accepting the keys Dean held out. Picking up the box again he left for the parking lot.
"What the devil are you talking about Cassy?" Balthazar piped in. "Who is Benny? and why would I talk to him?"
Cas stopped what he was doing to lean against the door and watch his progress with a smile growing on his face. He hadn't thought to ask Dean if he played, he had gotten the impression that between the cars, the football and the demands of popularity that he wouldn't have time for much else. He was pretty good, not great, but enough knowledge and skill there that could be developed over time. His voice was surprising as well, though he was actively trying not to sing, Cas could hear him hitting the notes nicely. He felt like someone had pulled the rug out from under his feet on this one. Biting his lip to keep from beaming.
"You sound a little jealous there Cas." Dean laughed, moving his legs to rest against Cass under the table.
"No. You have to be very good to see me shirtless.." Cass said suggestively, sending a wink in Deans direction.
"huh." Dean remembered the different guitars in Cass room, he had said that the upside to his parents not being home, was the ability to play as loud and as long as he liked. Though he hadn't considered that might be a coping method. "I suppose so. When did he tell you that?"
"I was reminded in vivid detail, why I avoid those parties!" Cas said rubbing hand over his eyes. "I'm paying for it."
"It is the semi-finals Balth." Castiel replied absently.
"That's incredibly sweet." Cas smiled, as Dean interlinked their fingers. "I wouldn't have thought Bobby would be the type."
"What?"
"Okay," Dean could hear him rummaging through his wardrobe, "I can work with that. Is there anything I need to know before I walk in there tomorrow?"
"I don't need to, no. If I'm bored enough I'll crash at Balthazar's place, but his parents are never home either and he tends to have a lot of parties. You need to be pretty desperate to hang around there too long."
"Not you Balth." He responded, helping load Ash’s drums and scrubbing his face with his hands. "These three, over here." He gestured to Gabe, Meg and Kevin.
Cas kept the pace steady as his hands roamed his body, groaning in approval as Dean picked up his hips to meet his thrusts. Dean dug his fingers into the hard lines of Cass body, marvelling at the way his muscles moved under his hands, as he grazed his teeth along his shoulder enjoying the salty taste of his sweat. Cas cursed into his neck and picked up the pace. Dean moaned as he gently bit him again. He arched back calling Cass name as he was pushed over the edge, Cas chased him over moments later, catching his weight on his elbows and burying his face in Deans neck.
"Sounds like Castiel would like to do more than that." Ellen said with equal parts of worry and annoyance.
"Are you saying every public school has musicians amongst the student population? That seems like an overstatement."
"I didn't tell him... But it's not hard to look at the back and figure it out. They're diamonds, by the way."
"Two visits in one day? What's going on?"
They all watched as Adam stomped to his car and slammed the door as he jumped in. Reversing quickly as he flicked the headlights on and tore down the road, leaving a dust cloud behind him.
"He. It's a he Gabe."
"So instead of getting away from the noise... You deliberately make it louder?"
"He would flog me."
"Seriously though," Benny asked. "Why is he wearing your clothes? He was in a different set earlier."
He was dreading this. Which was why he was so defensive in the first place. It hadn't even been two days.
Cas closed the space between bringing his hand up slowly to cup the back of Deans neck. He waited there for a beat giving Dean time to step back and stop him. But Dean didn't stop him, instead hands came up to rest on Cass waist as his eyes slid to his mouth in anticipation. Cas leaned in, gently guiding him into the kiss, as his heart raced. Deans hands left goosebumps as they moved up his back pulling him closer. He lost himself in Deans scent as he deepened the kiss. Unable to think of anything but the pleasing combination of beer, engine oil and leather and the feel of Deans body pressed firmly against his own.
"He's out with his girlfriend." Cas admitted slowly, feeling his stomach churn. "I might need more than four."
"I found the program. Did you know they have us facing a public school?" he asked derisively. "A public school! I thought we were here for a challenge."
Adam lost confidence as his eyes darted around the group, avoiding Castiel. "Alright, I apologise. I think I just need a beer or two."
"You haven't heard anything from them yet?"
Cas ran his finger down the overlapping fabric of Deans shirt, where the buttons joined, taking a moment to appreciate the maroon dress shirt he had worn.
Kevin shrugged, looking unimpressed. "Knight in shining armour still get trumped by soulmate though."
"Well that's a sure fire way to end things. God knows how many people would be happy to see that."
"Huh," Dean thought back over the day in concern now. "Is that a problem? I didn't think you minded."
"Nice watch." Cas commented studying Deans appearance, while the stress left his face, now that Hannah was gone. He recognised the Rolex around his wrist as the same watch he had abandoned on his bedside table last week. "Not that I'm complaining, but what are you two doing here?"
The club was in full swing as Dean walked in. Flashing lights pulsating with the live music to the right. A well-lit bar as a centre piece to the building with bar tenders, dressed in white shirts and black vests, working all four sides. Several pool tables littered the left with small tables and bar stools scattered for those watching the games and from what Dean could see a more relaxed lounge section down the back.
"What? Only cute?" Dean looked at him, mildly offended.
Ellen looked between the pair carefully before responding slowly. "I'll see what I can do."
"She's right!" Cas interjected, when he couldn't face it anymore, breaking the escalating argument up. "I shouldn't have shown up unannounced. You have plans and I don't want to get in the way of that. I can talk to you later."
Cas grinned at her, ignoring Dean who had dropped his head onto the table at some point and was refusing to move while his shoulders still shook with laughter. Kevin looked between the three of them as he packed his books into his bag.
"No, that's part of the reason I'm here." He admitted.
Dean gave their order to the barista as Meg stepped aside, quickly paying as he kept one eye on the girl across the table from his soulmate.
Cas laughed openly and the muffled thump sounded like he had dropped down onto his bed now. Dean could picture him there and if he closed his eyes, he could imagine Cas was on the bed beside him as they talked into the night.
Balthazar stared uncomprehendingly between the two of them as Dean rolled his sleeve back down and Cas continued to drink from his cup.
Ash looking more alive, flicked his attention in between the two of them as Dean started wiping down the countertops and walls where blood had been splashed.
"I'm nothing special and I'm more flawed than most." Dean studied his face curiously, not quite ready to believe him.
"Maybe you don't!" She argued.
It was late afternoon when Sam wandered inside accompanied by a tall boy who stopped at the sight of Cas leaning over the engine bay as Deans feet poked out from under the car. Cas looked over the new comer carefully, unsure of where he stood in Deans world, as Sam came up beside him to check their progress.
The moment was interrupted as a blond man threw an arm around the guys shoulders and standing way too close for Deans liking.
Sam apologised to both Bobby and Ellen as she was getting ready to leave, makin sure to point out that Bobby was his parent so it was no compliment to say how much they were like John and Mary. They were all taken aback by the conviction in his tone having never consider that side of things before. Dean pulled him in for a hug, giving Cas a nod of thanks over his head.
Cas beamed at his confidence. He had told Balthazar not to underestimate their competition and now he was sure, that if nothing else, the would be in for an interesting debate.
They sat through several more arguments as they waited for the next round to begin. Daniel joined them in the crowd, claiming the empty seat next to Cas, as Dean came back out for their second debate of the night.
"Wait. Really?" Dean asked, clearly taken aback. "You lived with your brother?"
Dean laughed as he dropped the cups on the table, grabbing a seat from a nearby table and sitting on in backwards, between Cas and Hannah. He winked at Cas as he slid Sam's cup across the table between them, before resting his arms along the back of the chair in front of him. Meg held Cass coffee out to him, sitting uncomfortably close to Hannah, with her arm thrown across the back of her chair.
"Looks like we're hanging with the nerds today." He gestured to the seats behind Charlie and Kevin. A quick scan of the room showed Cas that they were the only two empty seats placed side by side. Dean had abandoned his usual place with his jock friends at the back, to sit beside Cas at the front of the class room and by the looks on his friends faces, they weren't too pleased by the development. Lisa especially. Cas however, was more than happy to spend the lesson with Dean by his side. They had a habit of being physically close to each other, even without touching, when given the chance and sitting across the room within eye sight but unable to speak would have been frustrating to say the least.
"Ouch! Sucks to be you." Charlie said sympathetically.
"Of course." Cas agreed with a smile. "Now what was that about Charlie recognising me from a recording?"
They woke, with a start to the blaring noise of an alarm. Cas scrambled for his phone thinking it must be Ash. Only after checking to see no new calls or messages had come through did he realise that it was Deans phone.
Cas looked at Dean carefully, before stepping out of the car and rounding the hood to lean inside the driver window.
Cas assured him time after time that he was in fact, okay with it all, as they found themselves in the back shed again, lifting the engine out of the challenger and continuing to strip everything out of it. Cas may have come over for a crash course in Dean Winchester, but he was leaving with more knowledge of cars than he ever thought he'd possess, and he found that he enjoyed ever moment of it. The skill and knowledge that went into building cars was incredible and exhausting, with him and Dean getting up and down and constantly moving to reach the different parts and connections, and getting covered in grease oil and soot for their trouble. He loved it. He wasn't sure yet how they would piece all of this back together, but it was satisfying to rip it apart, even with Dean laughing maniacally at the surprise on Cass at how filthy he had manage to get in the process and not stopping to care that it was his clothes that were covered in it.
"I didn't know what to expect." He answered honestly. "I was hoping for some-one that would understand me. Maybe some-one I could argue with without damaging our relationship. You turned out to be everything I didn't know I wanted in my life."
"Well Sammy. There he is, why don't you go say hello while I get the drinks?" He suggested.
Dean looked at him steadily. Holding Cass gaze and wishing desperately to agree on the spot. "I have to take these two home."
"No. It's nice to know I'm not the only one in the group."
It was easy to be together like that. Joking and laughing as they worked on pulling apart the car, with Dean going over the each piece to see what was salvageable, and Cas building his knowledge of cars. Falling into calm silence on occasion as Dean sung along with the music and Sam flitting in and out of the shed to see what they were doing.
"Is that really the worst thing that could happen?" He teased gently as Cas chuckled. "I don't think we're that bad!"
"Stop! Stop." He said stepping quickly in front of Bobby and Dean. "There's no use yelling. Let me talk to him, okay?"
"Can we just bring a mattress in here and crash on the floor?" Charlie asked, pointing out the empty space at the foot of his bed. "No offence but it feels too empty in the rest of the house."
"I didn't know you were such a rock fan." Dean gestured around the walls.
"Leave him alone Meg. Shit happens when you're drunk." He said glancing at Sam. "I'm not sure Cas is up to coming with us, kiddo."
"I have to go this way," Cas stopped at the split in the room, looking at Dean. "I'll see you after?"
"Yeah, that works for me."
The voice to his left had him snapping to attention.
"You look more awake than I am." he accused.
Cas looked at him. Then down and away again. Emotions clearly unsettled within him. He tried once... Then twice, to try and explain himself again before Dean placed both hands on his shoulders. Forcing him to look at him.
"Boy. You want to do some explaining?" Bobby asked gruffly.
"Go-on then." Benny sighed at the wounded puppy look on Deans face. "I could use a drink anyhow."
The expression on Deans face when he came back, was that of pure horror. "Why Cas.... What happened that lung cancer sounded like a good idea?"
Dean chuckled as Cas ran his hands over his face, trying to relieve the tension building in his head. Letting his head drop back with his eyes closed, he felt his hands being replaced by Dean's. Massaging the back of his neck and down along his shoulders. His touch eased his muscles.
"You're a prick, aren't you?" Dean asked Balthazar redundantly. "I'll give you a ride home Cas. Come on, you're not going to leave before we get a chance to talk are you?"
"Oh, you think? That would have been nice to know earlier."
"Alright then," he said after a moment. "Enough of the crappy childhoods." Cas laughed as Dean jumped off the bench and pulled two more bottles from the fridge. "I think we both need this."
Sam pulled Cas to the table, pulling a chair out and telling him to sit. Cas wasn't sure he had seen a family interact so comfortably before, watching as they took their places around him at the table, with Sammy grinning ear to ear and Bobby waiting patiently for Dean to explain how they met.
Dean pouted, but allowed Cas to bully him under the sheets, sighing in contentment as Cas trailed a hand down his side as his eyes slipped closed. Cas watched him drift off with a small smile on his lips and let his own eyes shut.
Cas knew they were about to lose, but he conferred quietly with Balth as Dean brought his argument to a close, the least they could do was save face. Balth took to the stage as Dean returned to his seat. Closing their argument by stressing the human failure that came with having those words on your skin. Peoples innate desire to chase the dream would be their downfall and therefore people would have a better chance of finding and keeping those strong connections if they were not prompted to find them. Drawing the crowds attention again to the messy situations like divorce, that frequently occurred when some-one found those words written across their skin, because people were flawed. Wouldn't it save a world of heartache to those people, those families, if the cosmos didn't put up those signposts?
It was a great shot, capturing Deans whole body, hands behind him on the hood of the car, legs crossed casually as he laughed at Cass comments. Cas sent the pic to Gabe without waiting, thinking that he might set that as his background at some point, and walking back to show Dean. Dean took his phone, looking at the picture with a smirk.
Dean looked at him softly, with uncertainty in his eyes. "I.. I don't want you to leave... not just yet..."
Cas smiled at the display of brotherly affection. "I can see that."
"You poor innocent lamb." Balthazar said clapping Kevin on the back.
He jumped himself to his feet heading directly for his friend. Ash, who was still trying to figure out how he ended up covered in beer and glass, didn't see Cas until he was being hauled off to the bathrooms by the scruff of his neck.
"Don't look at your feet." Dean said quietly, holding his gaze. "Dancing is about getting in tune with your partner. You won't do that with your eyes on the ground. You look at me."
“Holy shit!” Dean moaned as Cas grinned up at him.
"I don't know..." Dean sighed leaning back. "She made me promise not to break up with her no matter how hot my soulmate turned out to be! But I don't think she was expecting you to be a guy."
"No. That's just myth." Bobby chuckled as Cas looked at Dean in confusion.
"You got a problem with nerds?" He challenged sweetly.
"You did well tonight. I was impressed that you managed to behave on stage." He teased.
Cas looked down at the bag he had dropped on the floor. "You said I should keep some clothes at your place for next time, so, I figured if I hand you a bag to stash in your room. I'll be covered for any more impromptu stays. If your okay with the idea?"
"I told Dean I wouldn't lie to him." Cas stated in return. "I don't want to screw things up through omission wingman."
"His family are religious homophobes. His pompous friends explained that they consider it a sin to have a soulmate of the same sex."
"Yes." Cas smiled lifting his face to watch him. "That was my brother Gabriel, I forgot to call him earlier and tell him how the debate went."
"I wasn't out late." Dean said pulling a mug out of the cabinet. Not wanting to dwell on the night he spent trying to reassure his paranoid girlfriend that he wasn't cheating on her. Honestly, the whole thing night had left him with a bad taste in his mouth as she continued to blame him for having a soulmate. "I promised Sam I'd take him to the movies today."
Dean stopped in his track, pulling out his phone to see if Cas had messaged him, as both Lisa and Sam looked at him for an explanation.
Castiel looked carefully the her, before shaking his head slowly. "I don't think so. I'm usually pretty good with faces."
"Consider how easy it would be for me to leave a hickey right now."
"There not open." He defended quickly, not recognising that he had no reason to be defensive, before seeing the shock on Deans face and realising he might have to explain that further now. "I used to smoke. As in past tense. I've been off them for about a year now, same time the band started getting regular gigs actually." He elaborated, moving to grab his stuff of Dean, who was staring at him intently. "I'll admit I break every now and then when life turns to crap. But. I haven't had one in months." He dropped them on the counter to deal with later. "I just like having them on hand, as a kind of stress relief just knowing it's there."
"He crashed at my place last night." Dean stated, clearing his throat at Charlies giggle. "He couldn't exactly walk around all day in lasts night clothes, could he. And the garage is no place for a suit. "
"Daniel and Balth spent the rest of the night bitching about you. God forbid they get knocked down a peg by a public school."
"What's wrong with my tie?" He asked in offense.
Samandriel stepped forward grinning cheekily. "Because they're all rich, religious pricks who simultaneously believe that soulmates are your god given spouse and being gay is a sin. So..."
"What is it about you, Castiel, that has my boys wrapped so tightly around your fingers?" Ellen arched her eyebrow at Cas.
"This is nice Cas, where'd you get this?" Dean asked in appreciation.
Benny shook his head in disbelief. "If you're lucky enough to find your soulmate, none of that stuff should matter. I couldn't imagine judging someone for there soulmate no being what you expect."
"I'm not saying that you're not flawed Dean." He chuckled. "But you're wrong about not being special. I couldn't find someone better for me, even if I knew what I was looking for."
"This has potential!" Cas smiled at him. "You can really fix it up?"
"You would need a band behind you before I allowed that!" he stated. "Danny boy and his friends showed up a while ago too, I think they headed upstairs, somewhere."
"Is it weird not having them all home?" Dean asked watching him make coffee with a shiny machine.
Mr B paused his lecture long enough to deliver a warning to Dean against corrupting the new students. Giving Cas a new round of material to work with every time it looked like Deans was gaining control again.
"I've got the first aid kit. What can I do?" He asked setting up the kit on the other side of Ash.
"So you met your soulmate.." Balth clarified, "On the opposite side of a debate about soulmates?"
"What are you doing?" He asked vaguely, not even slightly worried about his soulmates actions.
Dean had fantasized about being with another guy for years, but nothing prepared him for the shocks that ran through his system each time Cas used his mouth to kiss or suck at different places on his skin, each spot a little lower than the last. While his hands teased his sides, running under his body and kneading at his ass, and down his thighs. Slotting himself firmly between Deans legs as his mouth reached his cock. He lost himself in the feeling, fingers clenching in the doona as curses spilled from his lips matched only by low moans. A particularly sharp spike of pleasure had him arching up with a curse. Castiels rough chuckle helped in sink in that it wasn’t his mouth that produced that reaction, rather it was one of his long fingers probing at his entrance.
Dean stalked off to the house without waiting with Sam hot on his heels. He didn't wait to see Lisa's reaction to the information. He was too concerned with Cass sudden arrival to worry about how she would react. Cas hadn't said anything about coming down here to him, he hadn't received a single message or missed call, which was in complete contradiction to his desire not to interfere in his established life. All of this told him that Cas hadn't planned to be here, which meant that something was wrong. You don't travel for over an hour without having a reason to make the trip.
Dean took in his calm, easy smile, and relaxed slightly. "What should it be about then?"
"Don't give me that! I've seen you change directions in an argument within seconds before. So what the hell happened tonight?" Balth demanded.
"You both know full well I've pulled later nights than this and still made it to work on time! I thought we could talk for a bit...." He began, unsure of how to word it. "About Ash."
He felt like he had just been called into the principal’s office, with no-idea what he had done to then be handed a reward a the last second. Cass hands teased his sides, pulling at the hem of his shirt. Waiting for him to give the okay. He dropped his head against his chest with a smile. Raising his arms to allow him to pull the shirt over his head. The smirk slowly dropped from Castiel's face as he trailed his fingers over Deans features, lingering over his eyes and lips before running them down his neck and shoulders. Dean didn't see any of the badass lead singer on his face anymore. Instead, a warm vulnerability of some-one who had seen too much. Done too much. Far too soon in life. He didn't see any regret, just acceptance.
“Come on,” he ordered, tugging at the doona below them. “You need to get under the covers, you know.”
"A real man would never look at or speak to a woman the way you have in the past half hour alone."
Friday morning and not nearly enough coffee to face the day, Bobby found himself in the shop as always, running through his of jobs so far and contemplating his need to find an extra hand for a few hours a week. The problem with hiring mechanics, is that the pay wasn't especially great and most guys worth their salt couldn't live of anything less than full time work. He just didn't have enough hours to give to make it worth their time. Having Dean pitch in around the place helped a fair bit but left him feeling guilty knowing the kid was giving up his own plans, and even with him, Bobby was pulling over time left right and centre, trying to keep up with the demand.
"No wonder you lost." Meg muttered quietly.
"She just wants you all to herself again. You finish with that team and she'll settle down." Benny drawled.
Cas had called almost daily. Some-times it was only for a few minutes through the day, some-times they spent hours talking through the night, and he sent photos of his progress on the car throughout the week, plus selfies and comments he hoped would brighten his day. Cas and his Mom had gotten a small two bed house some-where. The where was a mystery. Castiel was soo overwhelmed with the move and lawyers walking in and out everyday, dropping mounds of paperwork off for him to go through (Mom had buried herself in vodka) and giving updates on there progress, that he had no clue where he actually was. The best Dean had managed to get out of him was that he was pretty sure they now lived closer to him than they had before. But in which direction he couldn't tell. But the worst thing in his mind, he had sold the car! His Mom hadn't had enough in the bank to get the place outright, and without a job getting a loan wasn't going to be easy. So Cas had sold both their cars to get the house. He had gotten his Mom a cheap car so they weren't without transport but hadn't been able to justify the expense of buying a second for himself.
Cas looked over his shoulder to find his face right next to his own.
Dean kicked his foot in admonishment, but didn't hide the blinding smile that had settled on his face. Cas didn't fight the grin taking over his face in return, as he chuckled at Deans outburst.
"I got an email the other day, saying they should be back Sunday/Monday sometime." Cas explained, not quiet understanding the problem. "It's fine. This is normal Dean."
"You dirty, sneaky cheat!"
"Hey Cas!" Dean grinned as Cas stepped into their area.
"Any advice?" Kevin asked, pulling his jacket on now.
"It's not, okay." Dean could hear the sigh that followed, but he wasn't sure which one it came from. "I had a bad night alright. But I didn't mean to do this. It was not intentional. Come on, you know when I'm lying Cassy."
"The poor kid spoke about his inability to share his life with his absent family. Out of curiosity I asked him for an example and he told me how he had met his soulmate a few weeks back, something he should be celebrating, but he hadn't told them because of their views towards same-sex relations despite him not being romantically involved with the guy. What kind of family would tell a kid that meeting their soulmate could be a bad thing?"
"Yeah," Cas laughed, glancing at Dean. "They came in second last year. Daniel and I had a running competition going throughout the tournament. We've been meeting up to argue with each other all year."
"She won't let you play, at all?" Dean stared at him. Cas shook his head and began picking at the burger in his hands. Dean tapped his foot against the tree roots as he thought. "It doesn't matter," Cas sent him an incredulous look, probably getting ready to tear into him once he finished the food in his mouth. "You can use my place."
Benny looked at him curiously as Dean pulled a face at his brother. "Well the other option is grabbing a few people and heading out to the dam for a few hours."
"I'd believe that. He walked around the place like it was his, didn't even hesitate going into his parents rooms, the only time he faltered was finding a safe in his fathers closet. Even then, a quick call to one of the brothers and he opened the whole thing up for us. I tell ya, their lawyers are going to be pissed."
"That was incredible!" Dean said honestly. "How long have you played?"
"Do you prefer Cassy?" Dean countered.
"Out of curiosity, when did yours show up?"
"No. You mentioned Bobby the other night so I assumed you might head over this way. I've known this old bastard for years." She explained watching as Dean grabbed his hand and pulled the boy to his feet.
"It's just Jo." She corrected.
"He seemed pretty pleased with you, from what I saw." Dean said alluding to the way they had re-joined the group.
"Long enough to see your victory dance." Cas admitted, pulling him in to kiss his neck.
"Both." Cas said kissing his neck. "How do you take it?"
The downside to living so far away from each other was that they couldn't stay long after breakfast, with the clock fast approaching midday already after their late night. Dean pulled him in for a quick hug, promising to call him the next day, before Cas found himself watching them drive away. His life hadn't changed much in the past week, but without Dean there he found that everything was slightly duller. Or maybe he had gotten so used to the heightened feeling of belonging around his soulmate that the absence made him forget what it was to be normal. It was like standing in the sun, if you look directly at it, you find yourself blinded to the things you could see perfectly only moments ago.
Cas moved to the door only to be blocked by both Sam and Dean. "You're not leaving!" Sam said throwing a nasty glare at Lisa.
"I know she's being a bitch." Dean said carefully, "But I agreed to try and make it work with her, okay?"
Cas turned his back on him then. The guy wasn't worth his time, but he hoped desperately that some-one would put him in his place soon. The girl came back few minutes later, her face red and her head down as she took her seat beside Faith again. He spent the rest of the lesson ignoring his desk-mate and was more than happy to see that he was the first one up and out off the door when the bell rang.
"And their final speaker was really shitty about it too!" Kevin called out with a smirk.
Deans reply came in the form of hot kisses starting at his shoulder and moving up his neck. Cas chuckled as he felt Dean press his whole body against his back. Yep. Definitely awake.
Bobby made a non-committal noise, turning to his whiskey. He never had kids. He had no idea how to broach these subjects with them and no freaking clue what to say next. His only point of comfort at this point was that Ellen looked like she was in the same boat on this one.
"Then why are you kind of celebrating?"
Dean collapsed into him, as Cas came down from his own high, panting and cursing. “You’re killing me, Cas.” He said nipping at his jaw. “I’m not sure if I can move.”
"I should take this." He excused himself as the music started again, heading for the door.
"Fuck you!"
"No. Why?"
Cas lead them down the hall without hurry. Asking quietly about which room they were heading to along the way. Pausing to push him against the wall and deepen the kiss and grinning each time Dean found the courage to do the same. Cas took his time, drawing out the process of undressing them, asking if it was alright before removing Deans jeans and underwear. Giving him the time to say ‘no’ or slow things down. Of all the badass’ Dean had been attracted to over the years, Cas was the only one who wasn’t rushing into sex looking for that quick fix, he was savouring it and enjoying the process all while checking in with Dean to make sure they were on the same page.
"Probably, I think I would still have ended up in mechanics though." He considered. "I might have looked into engineering if I had the chance, that would be fun."
"You might be right." He answered, standing up.
"Alright perverts, what do you want to know?" Cas asked moving to bench at the side to plug his phone into the spare charger they kept there.
The poor girl had gotten her period unexpectedly, and obviously was not prepared. The same thing had happen to Meg in middle school while they were on a field trip. She had been soo mortified at having to tie a jacket around her waist until the got back to school that Cas had sworn to help out any girl who found themselves in that position in future. He had gone straight home to ask his sister how he could help. Anna had sat him down to go into greater detail about women's biology and bodily functions than school had taught him and shown him what girls needed. Ever since that day, he had carried tampons and painkillers in one of the inner pockets of his bag for just this kind of situation, although he had never had to bring it up with girls he had never met before.
"What do you think?" he asked handing him another drink. "Better than sitting at home."
Castiel didn't want to admit the need to be cautious, but he couldn't refuse his brothers pure intentions. Gabriel had always wanted to keep him safe, even when he couldn't. Gabe’s sincere concern managed to take the edge of his annoyance.
"Blond. Male model mofo." Piped in the smaller kid next to them nursing a can of soda.
"We need more than you flirting with the judges! Help me out Kevin!"
"No, I haven't had the chance." he said quietly.
"Yeah Dean. Story time!" Charlie smirked at them.
"We have plans." Lisa said to Dean, with an air of impatience, as Cas stepped away from Sam.
"Holy Spirit has been competing there as long as Madison has." Cas said packing away his books with an air of indifference. "How did you think I met him."
That didn't sound like a good thing. "Basically, every-one who talks to me now will have an ulterior motive?"
Dean looked over the car, acutely aware of how easy it would be to fall for this guy, and reminding himself that he had Lisa and friends in his life that he needed to consider as well. "I like that, the friends thing. And I have to say, this, hanging out and working on cars together, this is something I would love to do with you again."
"Who's the cop?" Dean asked, looking over Ellen as the smile slipped from Cass face.
"Last chance, Castiel!" Came Gabriels' voice with more than a hint of resignation in it. Cas turned his head just enough to bring Gabe into his vision.
Cas turned in his arms, pulling him in for a deep kiss before they started down the hall. This trip was quicker than the last stopping only three times before the bedroom to make-out along the way.
"How about a shower?"
"He's here for me." Cas stated simply, "and Ash."
"No!" Dean smacked the table and glared at Mr B. "You said until finals! There was no mention of doing it this term."
"Heard of him. I know he's done a lot to keep Ash in line for the past couple of years. This is the first time I've met him though." She said raising an eyebrow at Dean. "How did you meet him before me?"
Cas sat with his back to the door, knee resting on the seat and arm slung over the back of the of the seat, giving him the full view of Deans profile as they drove through the streets. He hadn't asked where they were heading. And Dean didn't say. Credence played through the car as they sat in comfortable silence. Cas was the first to break it.
"I think Kevin should have the final say on who gets Cas." Dean decided with a cheeky grin.
"What music did you want?"
"Unbelievable!" Cas laughed, shaking his head.
"Where Cas is going to take me on our date." Kevin teased, relaxing back in his chair. "I was thinking movies but he's talking candlelit dinners."
"Talk about what?" Benny asked, turning around to observe his friends with him.
"As long as they don't have a problem with me." He shrugged at Dean.
"No. Not really. Alcohol and poor choices seem to be a mantra across the board."
He didn’t need to be told twice to lift his arms as Cas pulled his shirt off. He simple set about ridding Cas of his own clothes in return. As quickly as he could while he continued to get lost in Cass kisses.
"Really?" Charlie questioned, cautiously. "Everything we've heard so far has been 'go out swinging', you want us to play it down?"
Cas was looking at him in disbelief. He looked down at himself trying to figure out what was wrong. Sure, he could have changed his shirt, but considering the time he didn't think it was a high priority. He hadn't spilled anything on it. Had he? Cas climbed onto the bed and straddled him. Causing him to lose all train of thought that didn't involve using his mouth on Cass collar bones.
"Will you consider staying with me tonight if I promise that if Ash rings, I'll drive. If you're worried, we can drop him of tonight and I can ask Ellen to keep an eye out for him as well."
Dean looked up from where he was unlocking his car. His eyes growing wide as Cas walked towards him.
Dean wasn't sure if it was the lights or his imagination, but the singer was staring straight at him, and he couldn't tear his eyes away. The deep voice belting out rough lyrics riddled with anger and a hefty dose of sarcasm, paired with the defined muscles showing through his shirt that backed up the badass appearance, Dean was more than willing to indulge in the illusion that this guys eyes had managed to find him in the crowded club. On the final note of the song the singer pulled the mic away from his mouth and smirked. His eyes didn't waver from Deans until the band moved into the next song. Dean pulled in a shaky breath and swivelled around to grab his beer and wondered what the hell was wrong with him, as he turned back to the band.
"Why would I?" Cas asked in confusion. "I didn't even know this was Dean's school this morning. Am I supposed to go around announcing who my soulmate is to every-one I meet?"
Cas grabbed the front of his shirt and used it to pull him in for a soft kiss.
"I don't sleep well." He admitted. "It's not about anything. I just thought that was sweet and you might like to see it."
"What did Castiel say about that guy earlier?" Came the smoky southern drawl of the woman pulling a stool up at the table next to his.
Cas chuckled at the rough way Bobby asked. The last thing he wanted to do was spend more time stressing over his life going down the toilet.
"Don't worry about it!" Dean said placing a hand on his shoulder with a grin. "I'll drive you home, you can show me the way, alright?"
Dean smiled softly. "Just focus on me. I'll let you know if you need to do anything."
"And Hannah isn't a problem anymore." Meg said smugly, sipping her drink.
"Sam sits in the back every time you get in the car Charlie!"
Dean glared at the back of his head briefly before he turned to Mr B. "I'm in."
"18 Dean. You can relax." He said with a chuckle. Dean eyed him with a small grin.
"If you want me too."
Cas walked to the party that night, Balth only live a few streets away and he knew that he wouldn't be fit to drive home, he also had no intention of staying there overnight. The house was already overflowing with bodies as he entered. In true Balthazar style, pop music was blaring out of the surround sound system that was plumbed through the house, with people drinking and dancing in every room. It took him 20 minutes and his first beer before he found his friends out of the back deck watching the people brave enough to jump in the pool.
"So, when did you start. Smoking that is?" He asked before wandering down the hall to dump the clothes in the wash.
'Well, this competition just got a lot more interesting!'. Those were the words. Castiel had pondered their potential meaning for hours at a time. What competition? When? Was it organised sports? A five dollar bet at a party? It could mean anything! The one thing he knew for certain was that worrying over how and when might actually cause him to miss the moment. There was plenty of information to be found on the multitudes of ways soulmates could miss their chances. The one thing all scientists agreed on was that it took both soulmates staying on their particular life course for them to actually meet. Just one change of mind, or unexpected reaction from one of them, could cause them to pass each other without every meeting. He should know. He had been researching this subject extensively for the past few days.
"I wasn't kidding Dean." Ash tilted back on his chair, looking after Cas. "You might want to consider that."
"Grabbing the coffee. So, what are your plans?"
Kevin shook his hand with a smile and expressing his condolences at his circumstances but stating how happy he was that Cas got dumped at their school of all places. As much as he loved Dean and Charlies extroverted energy, he was glad Kevin was there to put things into balance. The words meant more coming from one who didn't over react.
Cas had snagged the fresh bandages and disinfectant Dean had stopped for earlier and followed Ash through the back where he was assuming his room was. He on the other hand, heading through the restaurant in search of Ellen. Years of working here had taught him that she liked to do the books in a clean booth at the end of the night. He got lucky when he came across Ellen and Bobby holed up together going over their paperwork. He had always loved watching the unique version of snark and love that seemed to define their relationship. Dean dropped into the open seat next to Bobby, gaining their attention.
'I spoke to Hannah. All things considered, it went far better than I was expecting. She listened as I told her how I met my soulmate. Even wished me good luck in the future.'
When Dean looked up, he went red at the sight of Cas watching him silently from the doorway. Cas was looking at him like he had just hung the moon.
"Option one; we part ways here, no harm no foul...."
Dean hadn't wanted to admit to himself how scared he had been when Cas had stepped away. Feeling Cass arms wrap him in a gentle embrace put his mind to ease and made his heart flutter.
Cas shook his head, of course he would ask that. "I have a girlfriend Gabe."
Dean chuckled at the ways in which her mind worked. She and Charlie would get along, if Charlie didn't have the need to come clean straightaway. He watched the table as he considered how best to make their presence known.
"Beats the PD" She chuckled lightly.
"I've already claimed the new kid as my knight in shining armour, you're not allowed to steal him, Winchester!"
"Ew Dude. No!" Charlie looked at him in disgust. "I don't sleep with guys!"
"We're going to drop him off at Ellen's tonight."
"I'm not a sore loser. I'm just shocked by the unexpected change in their presentation." Daniel hedged carefully.
"Sure." Kevin grinned.
Dean jumped, placing the mug on the counter quickly, having forgotten that she was there. Cas laughed as he let out a string of curses, damning her to hell.
"I'm bacon now?"
"So, home time?" Gabe asked.
"Bull Cassy. Okay, tell me this, what is lover-boy out doing tonight?"
Cas smiled as Dean ran his lips along each mark. "Protection symbols, from a few different languages."
Cas left with a smile. Thinking that as much as he loved his brother, he was going to have to explain his interference with Deans friend.
Cas stared between the two of them, unsure what their relationship was, before sending Faith an encouraging smile as she folded herself delicately into a spot against Kevin's tree.
"It's mid conversation because I was talking to Charlie originally, Dean just happened to be with her, until he got cocky."
"Wonderful!" Mr B clapped his hands together. "Mr Novak, we could use a sub?"
He stepped away to make the coffee only to be pulled into Deans arms a moment later. Now looking directly into his face Dean was smirking.
"Not tonight" Cas responded, turning his attention to draining his beer.
Cas laughed, not wanting to admit his disappointment at stopping, rolling to the side to get some space between their bodies again. "It might be better not to try that again while you have a girlfriend. I doubt she'd be to happy with you showing up with hickeys from some-one else."
"Where's your soul mark?" Sam asked pointing to Cass arms. "Don't soulmates have them in the same place?"
"He's the one that keeps Dean from being a complete ass on stage." Charlie added with a smirk as she dropped into her seat again.
"I can understand how a new school can turn your mood sour," Dean began, nudging Cass shoulder, "but you weren't that pissed last night. What happened? Do I need to kick some-one’s arse?"
It was here as he waited that he started to take in the other customers. Watching each of them briefly as if he were unsure or still getting a feel for the crowd. Dean could see now the two shiny spikes threaded through his left eyebrow and the ring that sat in the right corner of his mouth, circled through his bottom lip.  This brought out the edge of sharpness to his face. Considering this Dean began to wonder if his gaze was less observing and more predatory. Watching his eyes now Dean was struck with the realisation that he wasn't so much looking at the other people as through them, like he was stripping away their layers to see their very souls. Deans' breath hitched as it hit him, those eyes were now looking directly into his. He could not look away. He seemed to be frozen in place, feeling stripped raw and on display with every second that his gaze held him. Dean was certain that time had frozen with him as the noise of the club faded out leaving only the sound of the blood rushing through his ears as he remained trapped in the strangers’ eyes.
"I dunno. How would you announce it?" Benny challenged with a smirk.
"I am not getting ice-cream with them. You can find your own way home, Cassy."
"I think we need to figure out how this affects us from here. We both have girlfriends and people are going to expect us to get together, so, how do we deal with that?" Dean asked wheeling his tool box over and looking through it.
"You sure? He gets a bit touchy when people mention our parents."
After Cas was gone, Dean spent the rest of the day cleaning up. Catching up on the household chores and washing that he hadn't gotten to throughout the week. With all the chores completed, beds stripped and re-made, and the last load of washing hung on the line, he found himself unable to sit still. Any other weekend and he would be sitting back with a beer, enjoying the clean house and feeling accomplished. But tonight, with Sammy gone and the house quiet, his attention was on the owner of the black jeans now drying on his line. He flopped on the couch and turned Netflix on to some random movie that came up in the suggestions bar, hoping to distract his brain for a few hours.
"Regret what?" Cas asked opening his eyes finally and surveying the troubled look on Deans face as he traced the words over his heart.
"We finish at midnight. Give me say... 20 to pack up?" He shrugged his shoulders. "Where will I find you?"
Dean laughed. "How did you explain that? Did you tell him about me?"
"Three months ago. Yours?" Cas countered.
"Ah...."
"What... What happened?" He asked seriously. Cas ran his hands through his hair, worried at how Dean might react to this.
"I found Benny cornered by a few of my bandmates after I left you. My brother included." Cas admitted without hesitation. "I'm not entirely sure what happened there."
Castiel was on his schools debate team, and tonight they would be attending the semi-final rounds of the interschool tournament. They had been given the subject matter just days before hand to prepare their arguments before going up against and an opposing school tonight. Their subject, Soulmates: Fate or Hinderance. They had been given hinderance. Which suited them with the vast amounts of evidence supporting the idea most people lost their jobs, family or friends in pursuit of a faceless nameless person the universe had chosen for them. All the research he had done in preparation had help to solidify his decision to keep those pesky words to himself. Which made him grateful that they had appeared on his chest, where he could keep them easily covered. Some of his friends had theirs on places like the back of their hands or across their necks, which meant they were on display wherever they went.
"Hello Dean" He said stopping directly in front of him. Deans eyes darted from Cas to Gabe behind him in confusion.
"It's, Meg?" Sam shrugged his shoulders.
"Speaking of which, how did you come to be running around with Ash and his Castiel after midnight?" He asked.
Lisa had spent the week making a convincing show out of moving past her anger about the soulmate thing and getting back to being a happier, less bitchy, version of herself. Thanks to this Dean had been lured, somewhat hesitantly, into thinking that they could in fact make the relationship work again. Which is how she came to be sitting in the impala as he picked Sam up from school. He had agreed to head out and join their friends at the diner, after dropping Sam off, since Bobby didn't need him in the shop this afternoon. Sam, however, was less than thrilled to find her occupying his seat when he got into the car.
Cas grabbed the edges of Deans shirt. Pulling him forward between his legs until they were chest to chest. He enjoyed Deans gasp of surprise at the action.
Truth was, Deans new behaviour was amusing the hell out of him. He was almost certain that his friend wasn't even aware of how hard he was falling. He had watched Dean put every-one else's needs before his own over the years and he deserved a slice of happiness for himself. Benny wasn't about to get in the way of that.
"Madison Preparatory Academy." Cas answered picking up his mug again.
"Which was the basis of our argument!" Kevin called out in triumph.
"Yeah, alright." he conceded.
"And if it's a guy Hannah?" Cas asked harshly. "What then? Could you still forgive me?"
They few silent again as the moderator stepped out to announce the results. Cas applauded when they announced that Forest Glen would be going through to the next round, knocking Holy Spirit out of the finals. The annoyance on Daniels face was clear as he congratulated the other side, his face hardening as he shook hands with Dean before they filed off to be replaced by the next debate.
"Hey! I am not that bad." Dean called across the room.
"Well... it looks to me like you have three options" Cas said trailing his hand down Deans chest and resting it at his waist.
"There is a cinema close to where they live. I've already printed out the schedule." Sam grinned at them cheekily.
Bobby swore like a sailor as he worked. Cursing every single part, he found that didn't work perfectly. Cas found that his explanations of the tasks were cruder than he received from Dean, being far blunter and to the point, whereas Dean would go into detail to explain why it was important to the whole car. But even with this difference, Bobby had him working, showing him what to look for and how to get the jobs done efficiently. It was funny to see Bobby speaking sweetly to the cars only after they were finished. As he had with Dean, Cas enjoyed the work. It kept his mind off what was happening at home. Bobby had probed for details through the course of the day, usually in the middle of something that required his attention, where he found himself answering without much thought. He didn't realise that it was Bobby's way of keeping his getting him to talk it through without falling into despair again. He just saw it as them working, he didn't even notice just how much he had told him by the end, but he felt lighter regardless.
"Oh, shut it. How am I supposed to market you as a badass band if you don't live up to the expectation?"
"Sure."
"Ellen here, was good friends with me and your parents way back in the day. Before she upped and joined the FBI. You won't remember her, but it's not the first time she's meet you boys." He gestured to Dean and Sam, who was following the conversation from across the room. "Don't worry, no-ones in trouble."
"Dean. I haven't seen you around in a while." She all but purred.
"I haven't broken my dry streak yet, if that's what you're asking. "Cas admitted, with a cheeky grin. "Why? Are you offering?"
They had spent the morning comfortably consuming copious amounts of coffee and discussing everything from Deans work at Singers to how the band had come about, and Deans limited repertoire on the acoustic guitar in the corner of his lounge room. But, time moves on and Dean offered to drive Cas to rehearsal.
How about you?" he asked, taking the time look at Dean properly. Noting the leather necklace and golden pendant he wore, the ring on each hand, the AC/DC shirt and the scuffed-up work boots that told him Dean wasn't one for fashion or expensive jewellery. He smiled at that.
Dean pulled back out of Cass arm, glancing between the two of them, and Cas made no move to stop him.
"Well boys any plans? Preferably more interesting than our friends?" Balthazar tried again, looking between him and Gabriel.
"I'm fine." Cas argued, sitting up again and blinking rapidly. "What are we seeing?"
Dean cursed them out a few times before they would believe that they didn't jump into bed last night to screw each other senseless. They both lied and told them that Cas had in fact slept on the couch, rather than in Deans bed, and after the first few reiterations they began to accept it. Cas still wasn't sure why Benny had felt the need to gather his friends up there, but after the back and forth of Dean and Castiel's explanations, he was looking far more comfortable than he appeared in Deans shed earlier that day. But that didn't stop Cas from following him to the waters edge after he slipped away.
Cas laughed, thinking about Gabe's reaction. "Gabriel is determined to cross off every sin in the book, in the most outlandish ways, before he dies. He is more than happy to hear that I'm doing anything other than following our parents. So, me telling him that I'm the first person in our family to meet their soulmate, and that it's a guy... Gabe will be on cloud nine for the next month."
Dean chuckled as his heart beat began to slow again. "The suit and tie won't go down well with student population, no."
"Looking for you inside for the past half hour."
"I'll tell you what, if you’re good. I'll convince Gabe to take his shirt off okay?"
He pulled his cap off to scratch at his head when a last years’ model, white, Porsche pulled up at the front of the office. He didn't see brand new cars very often, certainly not ones worth this much, the owners preferred to get everything done through the dealerships. The owner still hadn't stepped out of the car when he walked out of the office to greet them. It looked like they were lost in thought, one hand still on the wheel and the other brushing slowly along his jawline as he stared into space, he was far too young to have bought the car himself. When he caught sight of Bobby, he opened the door and pulled himself slowly out of the car. The deep red dress shirt, the material alone screaming money, let Bobby know that this kid wasn't from around here. The unshaven scruff made him look older than he was, but it was the red rimmed eyes that caught his attention most. Stress was written across Castiel's, as visible as graffiti on a white wall, as he stood there opening and closing his mouth, not quite able to form the words he was looking for.
"If I tell you, can you keep it to yourself for a while?" Cas asked earnestly, glancing at Dean through the window.
"Yes Dean, but I don't have any clothes."
"I didn't go back to sleep." Dean answered softly. "Come on."
"If we're done here. I've got places to be." Meg wandered off, messing up Cass hair as she passed.
Cas found himself with Sam's arms wrapped around his waist and squeezing tight. He automatically held his mug away from the boy as he looked down in surprise, patting Sam gently on the back while Dean winked at him.
"Ellen Harville of Harville's Bar" Ash piped in.
"Bobby. Sammy. This is Castiel!" Dean introduced.
"Way too private school for me. Can you do something more simple?"
"That's what I want." Dean commented as they watched.
"He's a smartarse, is what he is!" Jo disagreed. "I spent bio with him making up stories about each person in the class, and calling Dr Campbell a remote operated robot."
"Together." Bobby responded awkwardly.
"Give it up already! They had the better argument. We lost!" Cas threw his hands up in exasperation.
"Dad's had lawyers coming in and out of the house all week." Cas started, sitting up more and glancing at him. "I didn't think anything of it, he doesn't talk about his work and it's not unusual for people to show up when he's home. -" He sat back running a shaking hand through his hair. "- The police showed up last night, warrant in hand. They arrested him... They've been in the house all night going through everything....
"Sure." Cas mocked lightly. "Jo, Faith, have you met my soulmate, Dean Winchester?"
Cas stepped forward, lifting the tie out off her hands and stooping to place his coffee and bag on the ground.
"Yeah..." Gabe admitted quietly, somewhat defeated. Honestly, he'd rather a screaming match over logic. "Just... be careful please..."
Charlie stepped back, folding her arms, to look him up and down. A small smile tugging at her lips. "You think you're up to my standards, Private School?"
Cas chuckled. "What, and you're not? You think I end up in other guys beds so often?"
Ellen looked at him and smiled. "You know where it is. Knock yourself out." she looked at the untouched food on the table. "I'll put this in the kitchen till you’re ready, shall I?"
"It wasn't my fault!" Charlie brandished her pencil in defence.
"Yeah Cas, never better." He said pulling him down into another kiss. "We should clean up. I suppose"
"He told us that Dean's a mechanic." Kevin smiled, trying to reassure him.
"I didn't get a chance to introduce my friend," Faith gestured to the girl on the other side of him, "This is Joanna."
"Is it okay that I'm here?" Cas asked as he realised that Dean couldn't have had time to clear this with his Uncle. "I don't want you getting in trouble for sneaking me in after midnight."
Dean grabbed hold of his arm, pulling him over gently until Cas was laying across his chest, he could feel his breath through his shirt as Cas chuckled. Dropping down to put his full weight on him, Cas slid his hand up his chest and nuzzled in closer, breathing in Deans scent with a smile.
Castiel thought that this would be the type of group that would have Balth ready to tear his hair out. But he found them interesting to watch as he waited for his coffee to be made. Their energetic movements wouldn't be tolerated at his school, it would be seen as too distracting, too unruly, something he envied, to him it just looked like they were having a good time. He thanked the barrister as he accepted a large cup of the strongest coffee they had, and wandered to the side, out of the way of the other customers. He picked a spot not far from the group he had been watching to lean on the wall and check his phone as he downed the first mouthful of his drink, hoping the caffeine would kick in before he had to be on stage.
"What the fuck did I do?" Dean wanted to know as Jo glared at him.
"That packet still unopened?"
The first finger to slip inside him was a shock, not painful, but cold and uncomfortable. Cas eased him through it by licking at his arousal and helping his body relax. It didn’t take long for Cas to find the spot that had Dean arching up in pleasure again and he took advantage of it to work him open, slipping a second finger and a third, until Dean was almost begging for him. He still groaned in disappointment when Cass hand disappeared, only to pick his head up and watch as Cas rolled them condom on himself and prepared himself with lube.
"Blond, green eyes. Looks like he just stepped off a photo shoot." Cas said with a wink, "Yeah, he's hot!"
"Knight in shining armour?" Kevin dropped his curious look at Faith to ask.
"Dude, you have Nirvana cufflinks! You're not much better than I am." Dean said as they navigated the crowds inside.
Deans expression went from shit-eating grin to I'm picturing you naked in my head. The instantaneous change brought a smirk to his face.
Without going into detail about the history Cas had given him, he gave Ellen and Bobby the basic run down of Cass concerns and explaining the conversation he had overheard from the two earlier that day.
Cas slanted a look at Dean who was finally coming up for air. "Only if he asks nicely."
Dean put the guitar on the bed gently before following him out to Gabe's old room.
"You know you don't have to leave right?"
"So you don't stay with any-one or check in with any-one?" Bobby asked in concern.
He chuckled sadly at the thought. His families hypocrisy didn't surprise him, it just made him wonder how much he was setting himself up to lose at this point. Dean shifted closer, wrapping his arm around him and pulling him against his side.
Dean cursed as heat rushed to his face. It wasn’t often that he caught off guard, but Cass blatant and unrepentant desire for him had him blushing like a schoolgirl. All he could think about is what Cas planned to do with, the things Dean hadn’t done with any-one else but felt so damn good that he was left desperate for more.
Cas nodded tentively. Doing as he was asked and keeping his focus solely on Dean. He moved slowly, allowing Cas the time to adjust to his movements, stepping back as he moved forward. He wasn't sure about dancing but moving in tune with Dean was one of the easiest thing he could do. He lost himself in Deans eyes as he led them around the room. Dean grew bolder with each passing song, picking up the pace and challenging his foot work, until he was twirling Cas around the floor. Cas became more confident with every step, laughing openly as Dean attempted new things.
Dean chased him through the streets, following him home and at Cas direction, pulling into the garage beside him as Charlie ogled the house.
"It's my life Charles." Dean ended the argument. "What are you two talking about?"
"Well, that answers the techno question." he laughed, "How about the band?"
"He's a nerd." Kevin argued with a sharp grin. "Not a gentleman!"
After some muffled cursing and quiet laughter, Dean rolled out first rubbing the top of his head, Cas followed soon after grinning from ear to ear.
"Who the fuck is that?" Dean demanded as the girl pleaded with Cas, her eyes wide in the same way that Sam used on him.
"That's some steady progress." He commented, as they scrubbed the worst of the dirt off themselves. "I wasn't sure how much you would be getting done down here, but it doesn't look like you've stopped."
"Maybe not with the subject, but debates are always unpredictable and we don't know anything about our opposition. I'm going to get a coffee. Did you want anything?" He asked grabbing his bag and throwing it over his shoulder.
"I've applied for several colleges, and I think I'll defer for a year to give Perdition a proper shot and go from there."
"I think that's a story for another day Dean. How about the pentagram?" He asked in return, running his hands over Deans chest where his own tattoo sat.
Dean sighed, running the back of his hand over his mouth. "I was only on the team as a punishment Cas. It's not a great incentive to stay."
Cas shrugged pulling up a slow music playlist on Spotify. He usually went for rock, but Dean was the one deciding here. He dropped his phone next to the speaker as 'Chasing cars' began reverberating through the sound system.
If Cas had trouble accepting that he had actually met his soulmate that night, he had no trouble accepting it in the morning, when he woke to find Deans head on his shoulder and his arm and leg thrown over his own body. After recognising where he was and with who, Cas relaxed back into the bed, enjoying the way he and Dean had tangled together in their sleep. Unfortunately, nature called far too soon, Cas tried to slip out of his embrace without waking him only to be pulled back by a startled Dean, with blurry eyes and messy hair.
"They played covers originally," Benny replied shifting in his seat to give Dean his full attention. "They made a deal with the owner to start introducing originals, just one or two mind you, in the beginning to see how the crowd would react. And the people loved it" he said tapping his fingers on the bar for emphasis. "Honestly, I don't think Jerry expected them to do so well" he added with a shake of his head.
"So, it was just you and your brother that left? I'm guessing you don't want to tell me why?" he asked softly.
Cas explained everything slowly, in stops and starts, as he played with bracelet around Deans wrist and his head rested on his shoulder. Dean didn't speak, just hummed occasionally, letting him know that he was following. He almost broke a second time as he told him that they were planning on seizing the house and all the accounts with his father’s name, which was almost everything, leaving him out of home and out of school.
"Yes. But on the same token, don't take crap from anyone. You might have a few kids push you're buttons a bit to see if they can pick on you. Let them know you won't be an easy target, keep your head high."
"It is." Dean stared at the Porsche in recognition, as he pulled on the handbrakes and jumped out of the car.
They lay there comfortably with Cas running his hands through Deans hair absently while Dean traced patterns along his ribs. Cas could spend hours like that happily. Wrapped up in the feeling of Dean pressed against him, awake and with no desire to move, simply enjoy the touch of each other. It would have been better however, if their friends weren't laying at the end of the bed, it would only take Charlie getting up and seeing them to cause big problems for Dean. So, when Kevin teased loudly that 'sleeping beauty' was finally waking up, Cas tapped Deans shoulder and dropped his arms, allowing him to roll away from him.
"I never got to have a look at your car." Dean reminded him, running a hand through his hair and ignoring everyone but Cas. "That's supposed to be impossible to steal right? Keyless entry, push start... Can I have a look at the key?"
"Having a same sex soulmate doesn't necessarily mean you're LGBT." Cas argued.
"What...?" Embarrassment crept across his face as he stared at the keys dangling from Cass finger.
Dean sighed heavily running his hand through his hair. "I just met him Bobby. We're not exactly anything at the moment."
They sat quietly as the panel conferred. Discussing the debate in whispers on either side of the room. Cas was pleased to think that they had saved enough of their argument to wipe the cocky grin off Deans face. But he knew that when it came right down to it, Deans team had the better argument, and it had been presented in such a way that could sway even the coldest heart. Instead of promising absolutes, they had offered hope, something far more valuable to the lives of people around the globe.
"Trying to manage it well enough that I don't find him dead somewhere."
"Do I look respectable now?" He asked the group sarcastically, picking up his leather jacket.
"First things first Cas." Dean spoke for the first time in hours, running his hand gently through Cass hair. "Whatever happens, you have a home here, okay. You don't ever have to doubt that."
"My parents, not me." Cas said pulling of his borrowed boots to drop in the trunk, before grabbing his things. "Come in, I'll show you around."
"Finally, some-one who understands. You're single, go get drunk!" Balth applauded.
"You haven't heard a word I've said, have you?" Benny exclaimed. It took him a moment to register the amused annoyance in his friends’ voice.
"I offered."
"Look at it this way," came Deans voice, "if they send you to a public school, you'll actually be able to start a band."
"He called me his brother?" Cas stared in shock.
Dean pulled him gently into his arms, placing his hands around his waist, and placing his hands accordingly. He looked down at the arrangement of their bodies, trying to work out if he had it right, when Dean caught his chin in his hand, forcing him to look into his eyes.
"I thought you said he was nice Ash." Ellen said grimly, tracing her fingers around the lip of her glass as she stared after Castiel.
Cas, Dean and Kevin laughed at her reaction as Meg eyed her curiously. Cas pulled her closer to rub her arm sympathetically. Beside them, Dean stripped his tie off, flicking Cass collar up to drape the tie around his neck before smoothing it back down. Daniel watched the movements intently.
"Sure." Dean looked at the phone over his shoulder to see them. "What were you and Benny talking about?"
Daniel held his hands up in surrender. "What's with the musical tie?"
"That's mean Cas!" He said shaking his head.
Instead of putting himself in a position of having to listen to her sulk or bitch to their friends, Dean joined Charlie and Kevin for lunch. These two were smart enough to get away from the crowds and had claimed a small patch of grass under some trees as their place. He liked it there, away from all the madness of the football team and cheerleaders, it reminded him that he wasn't a precise fit for the stereotypes around the school. He was a jock at times sure, but he could keep up with the nerds well enough as well, and his home life wasn't even close to normal. Charlie and Kevin had helped him to accept the fact that he didn't quite fit in the past few months, which is why Lisa was so pissed at them. He no longer felt the need to pretend. He had stepped out of that mould and challenged his friends and Lisa to be more than that as well. Unfortunately, they were either too comfortable in their roles or the really were that simple.
"I'd like that Dean."
"What are you on about?"
Kevin rolled his eyes and gave him a pointed look.
"Who the hell are you?"
Dean covered his mouth with his hand, as his mask broke, laughing quietly as he leaned forward with his shoulders shaking. Cas kicked his legs out, crossing his ankles casually and leaning back, as he bit back a laugh of his own.
Meg led him inside, moving through the crowd to the kitchen, setting out several shot glasses and lining them up along the bench. She found a bottle of tequila and poured the liquid into each of the shots.
"Can't. I have to get up and help Bobby soon." He sighed, propping himself up on his elbow to look down at Cas. "Do you regret it?"
Cas was further from home than he initially thought. It took them over an hour to reach his neighborhood, with Deans eyes growing steadily wider as they as they pulled up to his house.
Unsure of what to say and not wanting to make it worse, Dean sat in silence, gently running his hand up and down Cass leg. Hoping that he would find it soothing as they slowly drank together. When the whisky was gone and the stress temporarily eased, he convinced Cas that a few hours of sleep would be better than none. Considering they both had to be up early that morning. He pulled Cas to his feet and kept hold of his hand as they walked to the bedroom. Stopping once so he could raid Sammy's room for the spare charger, he knew his brother had in there. Cass phone had made it through the night twice already without dying, but with his luck the one-time Cas was waiting on a call would be the time everything died. He stripped of his jeans and climbed into bed resting his back against the headboard as Cas connected his phone to the charger and fiddled with the outlet behind the bedside table. Cas looked at him in confusion as he stripped down to his boxers.
"I know," he conceded with a sigh, "I love you. I do. But if this is a mistake Gabe.... It's one I need to make for myself... Do you understand?"
Cas pulled a face at Dean, utterly confused with the brief interaction with their teacher. Dean shrugged in return. It wasn't unusual for Mr B be cryptic and he wasn't to worried about it.
Dean leaned back in his chair, running his hand through his hair, as Cas finished his coffee and waited to see what was going on. "Do you know anything about cars Cas?"
"A friend of Cassy's that has been trying to get into his pants for the past year." Meg explained with a smirk, as Cas gagged at the thought. "He managed to stick his tongue down his throat last night, before Cassy realised what he was doing."
They lost track of time quickly, noticing only when the songs change as they changed tempo to match, but neither could guess at how many songs had passed as the night moved on. Keeping their attention closely on each other and failing to register anything else around them. Cas lost himself as Dean dipped him. Smiling broadly with a chuckle gracing his lips as Dean brought him back up again.
"No, but a heads up when I sat down would have been nice."
"Can you give me a lift Kev?" Ash called after him.
"I never told her about it." Cas admitted, glancing at him. "I didn't actually tell anyone about it. No -one in my family ever met their soulmate so I just tried to convince myself that that would happen to me to. I didn't want to get caught up hoping."
"What do you think Cas? Can you handle hanging out with a few of our friends for the night?"
Cas stood in the doorway, unsure of what to do next as he gained the attention of Deans family. Dean however, cheerily pulled two mugs from the cupboard, holding one up with a silent question. Cas nodded, slipping his hands into his pockets as Bobby turned to Dean and Sammy continued to eye him.
Cas smoothed down his collar when he was done, stepping back to look him over. "I'm free. Did you want to meet back here after?"
"So, you could meet them again without getting upset?"
"None at all." Cas answered, staring at Charlie tucked under his arm with a bright smile. "Daniel, this is Charlie and Kevin."
Gabriel smiled innocently up at him.
“Ah… top draw.” He said nodding to the right side of the bed and hoping that he did in fact have condoms there. It had been a while since he had needed them. Cas seemed to find what he was looking for, stripping the rings from his fingers and dropping them on the table as he did, before dropping the lube and condom neatly beside Deans hip and returning quickly to their kiss.
"You won't lie to me... and I won't lie to you." Dean said carefully. "That's the deal right. I'm not always the best with my feelings Cas. So, if you need time. I get it." He said, reaching out to cup Cass face gently. "No need to explain. I can wait, alright?"
"Take the compliment." Cas said, positioning his hand on the guitar. "Not many people can sing well."
"Is he hot?" Asked Meg with a smirk.
Cas took it, allowing Dean to pull him to his feet, grabbing his phone. He pulled Dean into the hall by the hand, walking down the flights of stairs and leading him into the living room, where there was plenty of open room. He dropped Deans hand to look at the speakers in the corner.
Cas rocked back on his chair as he laughed. "Why not go all out and have dinner under the stars?"
"Oh...ok" Cas responded, obviously taken aback. Not wanting him to feel pressured, Cas felt that moving back to the bench to give Dean a bit of breathing space was the best move. He missed the hurt that crossed Deans face for an instant. Leaning on the bench again he began to think a bit more clearly.
"Cut the crap Dean. I could see the shadow of your feet under the door." He said referring to earlier. "You're not as subtle as you think."
Cas looked around their faces. Gabriel's uncaring sass, Megs amusement, Kevin's quiet guilty expression and in comparison, Balthazar looked like he had been slapped and couldn't configure out why, whereas Ash was leaning against the van looking like he was watching his favourite program.
"Are we what, Bobby." Dean looked pointedly at him.
Cas chuckled, running his hands through his hair, as he searched the ceiling carefully for his next words.
"Do they know that?" Balthazar asked in amusement, winking at Meg.
Dean grinned at him. "You're still riding home with me, yeah?" Cas nodded at him. "We can grab your gear and take it over to my place then. Unless you have other plans?"
They found a group of chairs next to the middle aisle, giving them a great view of both sides of the stage. They talked quietly about Balth plans for a party over the weekend, with him trying to convince Cas to make an appearance, as they waited for the show to begin. The stopped talking as the moderator stepped onto the stage to introduce the teams. Cas applauded politely as they introduced Holy Spirit, smiling as Daniel spotted him in the crowd sending him a quick wave before Cas turned his attention to the moderator announcing Deans team. Charlie came out calmly, keeping her eyes on the moderator or the panel, as she took her seat. Kevin followed her example, keeping his eyes away from the other team. They might actually be following his advice. He watched closely as Dean came out, head held high and a small smile on his face, but the cocky smirk was gone as was the swagger he usually had in his walk. Cas smiled widely, noting that Daniel and his team were conversing quietly, not paying any attention to their opposition. Cas nodded slightly as Dean caught his eye.
Dean ignored his brother’s outburst. A quick surveillance of where each band member stood, and he chose to lean on the wall beside Ash with a quiet greeting.
"You know full well they don't listen to me. I need you." he pleaded, stepping closer with his back to Dean.
"Okay. So, it doesn't bother you then?" Dean asked, playing with the ring on Cass little finger.
"And you don't get embarrassed at all?" She asked curiously, lifting her chin.
In a world where soulmates exist, in a real and acknowledged way, people remain divided about love. Scientists have studied soulmates for years and they have not yet reached a distinct conclusion about how the process works. What they do know for sure, is that the words that appear on a persons skin, like a tattoo, are the first words your soulmate will speak directly too you. This is important. You may hear your soulmate speak to others and walk past them none the wiser about who they are to you. Some people may never be sure who their soulmate is, because if their soulmate doesn't speak directly to them, no words would ever appear on their skin.
"He's stronger than he looks."
"Charlie and Kevin are only children." Dean commented. "The idea of siblings baffle them."
"This crap with his Dad has shaken him. But he won't break, not my Cas." Dean added glancing at Ellen. "What will happen to him and his Mom?"
"Christ, even losing he's arrogant!" Daniel grumbled.
"My brother cornered Benny earlier to ask about you."
Dean sighed heavily beside him, running his fingers absently over Cass arm. "She seems to have this idea about us being the ideal couple, the quarter back and the cheerleader trope, and she expects that it'll stay that way. So, when I got put on the debate team and started actually using my brain in school, talking to other people instead of just hanging with the same crowd, she saw that image falling apart. Of course having the soul-mark show up soon after just reinforced that concept, reminding her that I have some-one out there that might replace her. She just kind of lost it after that. Became really possessive, trying to control where I went, who I was with and she made sure every-one was aware that I was hers.
Cas patted his shoulder with a tight smile. It was hard for every one to figure out how to work their soulmates into their lives at the beginning. You couldn't be sure what kind of expectations they might have around the idea and Cas figured that he and Dean would need to speak about all of that too. But Dean seemed to be having problems with his girlfriend that weren't strictly connected to him, so he wasn't sure what to say about it.
"And what school do you go to son?"
"He's a musician." He explained at Bobby raised eyebrow. "It's like me with my car. When he stresses, he plays. You can't take that away from him as well."
"Unfortunately, I have to go. Maybe I'll see you here again?"
"Don't."
He found Cas in the men's room with a miserable looking Ash staring into space as Cas picked the glass out of his arms.
"Seriously though, do you think our argument is good enough? The school we're up against is pretty good."
"She probably would have killed him, if that's anything to go by." Dean sat now, breathing easier now that he had shaken off the stress of talking to Lisa. "I can understand why he doesn't care for his families opinions now. Could you imagine."
"Jeeze, he really wasn't kidding about her was he?" Charlie said, examining the photo closely.
"Am I under surveillance?" He questioned, trying to think if he had told anyone where he was going. He was sure he hadn't, he hadn't spoken to his friends yet, and his family didn't know about Dean let alone where he lived.
"Is it just Sam or are there more?" Cas asked, watching Dean shift smoothly through the gears.
Balthazar congratulated them on another successful night as they packed away their instruments and asked about every-ones plans for the rest of the night.
"I'm sure he would, unfortunately." Cas sighed. "You should go."
What the guy hadn't been anticipating was his teenaged son, who had learnt of his fathers charges from the arresting officers rather than his parents, being rather frustrated with the idea that his father who had promoted a religious and law abiding lifestyle had himself broken his own morals. Ellen explained how this kid upon reading the warrant intently, while his mother and her lawyers sat around the kitchen table, had moved from room to room opening every drawer and cupboard door in the house while she and her team had followed behind him. She wasn't allowed to question him without a parent present, but they did make inconsequential small talk as her team raided the house. During this she had pieced together a small outline of the kids life. Youngest of five kids, raised with high expectations but not a whole lot of love or care who didn't share his parents beliefs but held a strong sense of right and wrong of his own.
Meg and Samandriel laughed as Cas flipped Balth off. "You're such an asshole!"
"He argues harder if he thinks you're a threat." Cas explained seriously. "He's second. So, don't give him anything to attack. Wait him out. Present your argument confidently and professionally, avoid looking at their team for too long. That means you Dean. Wait until the end to drive home your point, it'll have more impact then."
"Are you really not going to stay with them?"
"Yeah. Our parents died when we were younger. Bobby took us in." Dean explained as they walked to the house. "We'll have to be quiet. They'll be asleep by now."
Cas didn't reach the bed before Dean was pulling him into a bear hug. His surprise only lasted a moment before he wrapped his arms around him, burying his face in his neck in response, breathing in Deans scent as they pressed together. He would be lying if he said he hadn’t been thinking about having Dean in his arms again all week. He hadn’t thought much about it last weekend, slipping into this connection with Dean and going with the flow, but once he was home again, he was shocked to realise that Dean was the first man he had been attracted to. Not just a passing ‘that guy is hot’, but the lingering desire to have his hands on him and discover what it would be like to kiss him properly. A temptation that hit him strongly as they pressed together.
He packed his things slowly, giving the prick plenty of time to get far away from him before he got up. As he was watching the door, the two girls took up positions on either side of him, staring at him in interest.
"I'm sure I'll run into them."
"Balthazar was the one that drove you last night, right?" Dean clarified, trying to change the topic before Bobby decided to track his parents down and abuse them for neglecting their kid.
"Ah... no. Not really..." He began as the man watched him. Dean cursed internally, especially as Benny choose this moment to start laughing behind him. So much for playing it off cool. "Okay, maybe."
Castiel did a double take at the words. It couldn't be. Could it? He looked at the guy closely now. Spiky blond hair, bright green eyes and a spattering of freckles across his face. He was struggling to process the idea that his soulmate was standing right in front of him after spending months trying to convince himself that it was unlikely to find them anytime soon, if at all.
"Fine!" Dean hissed, stealing his coffee back from Cas and smirking as he saw how much had been drank. "You coming Cas? Or do you have somewhere else to be?"
Cas shook his head in disbelief. "Ignore her.” He said with a pointed glare at Meg. “Dean this is Daniel, Daniel I'm sure you remember Dean from earlier."
"There's more to life than money. As it stands you're already one up on them. They don't have soulmates, or any decent relationships for that matter." He added more quietly.
"Why do you keep telling me to behave?" Dean questions, resting his arm around Cass shoulders.
"He seemed very close." He said trying to catch the bartender’s attention.
Cas finished the coffees and was sitting at the table with Kevin discussing the different schools they had faced in the tournament, by the time Dean and Charlie stumbled into the room.
"I think so." Cas laughed. "Consider how badly Bobby would have reacted if you had spent the night in bed with a stranger that wasn't your soulmate."
"What are you doing?" Dean asked as Cas stood over him, phone in hand.
"But you have to admit not all work requires a formal education. If I had finished high school before starting my apprenticeship, I'd still be working on it now. Which is no help to any-one when I have bills to pay and a kid to feed."
Cas turned over and pinned him to the bed. Taking the time to appreciate the sleepy arousal in his eyes, before leaning down and capturing Deans mouth. Neither man considered it a bad way to start the day, as Cas reached for the lube again.
Cas laughed quietly, pulling his belt from his pants and sitting on the bed. "So you're betting on them being okay with waking up to find me here?"
Dean gently pushed him down onto the bed, letting him know that he was sure about this, and took a moment to marvel at Cass naked, toned body. Clearly defined muscle structure and not even a hint of softness to him. He was almost drooling just looking at him spread out on the bed, running his hands up the hard lines of muscles as he made his way up to Cass mouth had him groaning in anticipation as he nipped at his hips, nipples and jaw. Cas pulled him into a deep kiss, taking advantage of the way Dean melted against him to flip their positions.
"We are." Dean winked at him, as he leant back again.
"I didn't lose it." Dean defended, throwing his hands up. "I just didn't bring it!"
"Alright, I need help." Cas sighed through the phone when Dean picked up Sunday night.
Charlie and Kevin picked their heads up at this piece of information, watching them closely as the nudged each other, with excited smiles.
Dean took his time to down another mouthful before responding this time. "Didn't you say that they were a cover band? I've never heard any of these songs before" he challenged his friend.
"He's going to get all his guitars back, right?"
Dean studied Cas in the mirror. He was meticulously going over Ash's wound making sure he didn't miss any glass. But what struck him most was in their short acquaintance; he had never seen Cas so completely devoid of emotions. There was no trace of the smile he usually had when he looked at Dean. There wasn't any sadness or anger, just a blank slate that had his heart dropping into his stomach.
"Fuck. No wonder you're horny!" Dean laughed.
The next problem is that as the world changes, situations change and how you meet your soulmate changes. This causes the words on your skin to shift and change. The words you have at 16 may change when you're 20 or fade all together if the path that brings two soulmates together changes. These acknowledged aspects of the soulmate system had caused rift in the public perception around soulmates. Some believed that you should do everything in your power to find your soulmate, where others felt that it was too subjective and people should focus on living their lives regardless of who your soulmate turned out to be. That being said, life moved on like normal. People fell in and out of love. Got married and divorced. Worked and socialised, all without much thought about who the universe wished them to be with.
"Getting stuck with me for a soulmate."
*****
"Has any-one been home this week at all?" Dean asked in concern. Cas shook his head, arranging four coffees on the bench in front of him and cleaning down the machine. Dean placed a hand on his shoulder, turning him so they were facing each other. Cas looked at him in confusion, dropping the cloth on the bench. "You've been here alone for the past week? Have you even spoken to your parents?"
"Rightfully so! Considering we won." he smirked as Cas chuckled.
They pulled into an all-night diner after a long drawn out argument over the fact that Cas didn't watch TV shows. Or many movies, either, and Charlie refusing to accept his lack of knowledge on the subject. Castiel had tried to explain that he spent most of his spare time on music rather than television, but that only seemed to upset her more. Dean laughed at him when he gave up the argument as they claimed a booth next to the front window, switching the conversation to the soul-mark instead.
He turned and walked towards his area, shaking his head at the strange turn in events. Who would have thought that he would end up with such a cocky soulmate. Dean was right, this just got a lot more interesting.
"What's this about Kevin."
"Just tell me what to do." Cas agreed, already removing his cufflinks and rolling up his sleeves, exposing the leather watch Bobby recognised as Deans, still wrapped around his wrist.
"Ah.... Hi" Dean said slipping the keys back into his pocket.
"Probably in the garage, business and pleasure run together for him." Dean said, pulling eggs and bacon from the fridge.
Cas dropped his hold on the guitar. Opting to run both hands through his hair before answering.
Even as he laughed along with Sam, Dean could see the stress etched into his features, and the barely contained emotions he was working to fight back. There was no trace of the sarcastic expression that usually defined his face. Dean didn't bother to draw their attention to his presence. Instead, he closed the distance, pulling Cas to his feet, and wrapping him in his embrace. Cas stiffened at the sudden change, relaxing after he recognised his attacker and running his arms around Dean’s back to pull him closer. The carefully constructed wall that had been holding back his emotions broke as he buried his face in Deans neck breathing in his unique scent. Dean held him tightly as the sobs wracked his body, nodding a quick thanks to Sam who slipped out to the room quietly, as Cas clung to the back of his shirt.
Castiel waited in the wings of the stage with Balthazar and Uriel watching the moderator on stage as he announced the next debate. From here he could see Dean and his friends waiting opposite, with Charles whispering to them. Cas missed the name of the school as he watched the group, but paid close attention as the moderator announced Charlene Bradbury as First speaker. Charlene walked out on stage with her head high, waving politely to the crowd before taking her seat. The next person he announced was Kevin Tran, who followed Charlene out nodding at the panel and taking his seat next to her. Lastly, he announced the final speaker, Dean Winchester. Cas repeated the named under his breath. Dean Winchester. He rolled it around his tongue as Dean sauntered on stage, cocky smile in place as he winked at him across the stage before taking his seat. Dean leaned back in his chair grinning as a cheer went up from a few audience members on his side of the stage. It looked like the juvenile delinquent had a few supporters in the crowd.
Cas watched the debate with interest, keeping an eye on Deans expressions throughout, he could tell by the look on his face at the end of his argument, that the decision would be close. Balthazar and Daniel cheered at the result, while Cas applauded politely refusing to join in their enthusiasm as Dean congratulated the opposing team on their victory. Charlie was muttering to herself as she left the stage, Cas didn't need to hear it to know that it would be her own unique string of curses, Dean didn't seem too upset, sending Cas a wink before leading Kevin off with a hand on his shoulder.
"I like him." Faith commented happily.
Cas considered the blunt statements carefully before responding. "I don't know Meg."
"Charlie wasn't sure whether or not to take your advice on that. If it had come from anyone else, I would have ignored it too." Dean admitted with a smirk. "You were right though; they were fuming when they announced us as the winners."
"Blond guy on the end. What was his name Dean?"
"Because I called him this morning to see where the hell he was." Gabe stated dramatically. "And he was bitching about being woken up at 11am!"
Dean smiled softly, reaching out to take his hand. "I know the feeling. You're in my house, in my bed, I promise I'll still be here in the morning. Will you?"
Dean adjusted slightly, running his hand along the length of Castiel's arm as he dropped slowly into sleep.
He looked at her in confused amusement for a moment, before ordering burger from the menu. She smiled brightly telling them the order would be right out and winking at Dean as she left. Dean reading the baffled expression on his face attempted to explain that Jo was Ellens' daughter, who had unfortunately been crushing on him for a few years, but he only saw her as a sister.
"Yeah. He's good."
"Okay." Dean agreed, trying to keep his eyes off his mouth. "I'm a little jealous."
"Is it mad to miss some-one this much after a week." Dean murmured against his ear.
"Yes!" She stated mockingly, smacking him on the chest. "Now go say hello to your boyfriend!"
Neither boy knew how long they stood like that. They only knew that by the time Cas had worn himself out Deans shirt was covered in his tears, not that he minded. He brushed off every apology Cas aimed at him over it, taking his hand and pulling him down the hall, showing him easy it was to fix as he found a new shirt in his cupboard. Stripping the old one off and tossing it in the laundry pile. Cas made his way to the bathroom as Dean changed, washing his face with cold water, trying to calm the blotchy skin. Dean joined him at the sink, running his hand firmly up and down his back, as he cleaned himself up. Dean didn't push him to explain, and he was grateful for that, he just took his hand and led him to the bed. Pulling him down into his arms and letting him get comfortable.
"You were being cocky!"
"My soulmate Hannah. Would you be this
"Do you not believe him?" Dean asked. "When he said it wasn't on purpose."
"Really. You remember Ash right?" Dean waited for Cass murmur of agreement before continuing. "He plays drums, but you won't find him hanging around the music department. There are plenty of musicians in public schools, you just have to find them."
Cas once again had every-ones eyes on him as he unbuttoned his shirt in the same manner he had last night, confused by the sudden change, he pulled the fabric aside exposing the words written above his heart. Just like last night, Deans eyes strayed to the words, taking his time to drink them in again. Sam and Bobby looked at the mark curiously adding it up with the words they had read on Deans arm everyday for months.
"You guys still need to get dressed you know!" the small red-head laughed, kicking one of the boys playfully.
"They openly said he was screwed the moment they realised Dean was his." Kevin added, kicking his legs out in front of him. "Poor bastard."
"Point taken. But I've never even heard of their school before, they certainly weren't here last year."
"Did you get busy?" Came the exaggerated question from Ash, punctuated by several hip thrusts.
"Not that it isn't nice to see you, but it's been over 10 years, what brought you back here now?"
Cas smirked at her, "Eldridge knot."
"What do you think she would have done if she had known his soulmate was a guy?" Kevin asked.
"Don't you have to go home?" Sam asked in confusion, glancing between Dean and Bobby.
"Son. Of. A. Bitch." The guitarist punctuated each word darkly.
His voice was barely above a whisper and Cas had to strain to catch it, despite the quite night around them. "No. I told you, my family is out for the weekend and I don't have any where to be tomorrow."
Cas chuckled. He appreciated the show of strength from the girl who had been embarrassed by his intervention earlier. He schooled his features into a neutral expression before making a exaggerated bow and offering her his arm. She looked down her nose at him proudly, with a small smile tugging at the corner of her mouth, as she slipped her arm into his.
"I'm not trying to grope you." Cas said quietly. "I'm just having trouble accepting tonight actually happened. I've been telling myself for the past three months that we probably wouldn't end up meeting."
"But not as satisfying!" Dean grinned.
"You're young, you're hot and you're going to bed with a man that has already seen every inch of you." Cas stated with that damn smirk again. "Why the ever-loving fuck, is your shirt still on?"
Cas fiddled with his bracelet around Deans wrist the next morning. Dean was asleep on his shoulder, with his arm resting across his chest. Cas hadn't been awake for long and he was unwilling to move out from under his soulmate. Girlfriend or not, he and Dean had something between them that couldn't be changed, and Cas lay there wondering how and when that might come to a head. He doubted either of them could go for long without crossing that carefully drawn line and the more time they spent around each other the harder it got. He was however determined to give Dean whatever time he needed to come to terms with that. If he needed more time to deal with his personal life, Cas could find the control to give him that, even if it hurt to watch. His bracelet hanging from Deans wrist showed him that Dean wasn't ready to walk away from this either.
"Okay." He said, pushing off the wall and saluting his friends with his middle finger. "I'll see you guys later."
Kevin mumbled something into his coffee that sounded an awful lot like 'so did Dean'.
Dean glared at his coffee trying to decide which was worse, Charlie threatening to tell Lisa he spent the night in Cass bed or Kevin flirting with him, he could kill them both, but he thought it was likely he would start with Kevin first.
'Looks like you're having a great day! can I interrupt it with a call later tonight?'
The guy blinked at him slowly, the cocky smirk slipping from his face, as Charles eyed the symbol on his jacket. "You're from Madison Prep! That's why you look familiar!"
"I'm wearing some-one else's clothes, so I clearly haven't been home yet. Safe bet that yes I did in fact 'get busy'" Cas pointed out, rolling his eyes.
