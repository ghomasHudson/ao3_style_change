Beady black eyes peered out of the crowd, turning John’s heart and stomach to pure ice. Nearly losing his erection, he tightened his hand on Sherlock’s hair in a prearranged signal. John closed his eyes and pushed all thought of Moriarty aside. This, after all, was the reason they were here.
As the man gripped the back of his head, Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut and uttered a prayer to the one person he knew could save him.
“Such a good boy,” John praised around a moan when Sherlock’s mouth made contact with the tip of his cock. “If anyone else would like to come help him move his head…” John called to the crowd, “Same rules as before, thirty seconds or so. Keep your cocks to yourself please.”
"I don't like the quiet game. Mycroft always won the quiet game." Sherlock frowned. He sounded scared again, like a child being asked to be brave while getting a shot at the doctor's. John had never seen Sherlock in the throes of his addiction, he'd entered Sherlock's life too late to be of any assistance with recovery. But it seemed Greg had been right. For all intents and purposes, Sherlock had reverted to a very childlike state. Gone were the intense flashes of his eyes, and his sharp wit. The Sherlock John knew had been replaced by a child masquerading as a man.
“Jesus, I’m sorry,” John said softly while squeezing Sherlock’s knee.
“We’re going through food faster now.” John had been standing in front of the fridge for two solid minutes, letting the cold air out while surveying the contents.
“Jesus, I’m going to come if you keep that up.”
“Look at me,” John said. Sherlock opened his eyes and watched as John wiped his hands on a towel. “Until that comes off,” he said, nodding to the cage, “you can’t touch me. Perhaps I’m being extreme, but for Christ’s sake, you need to learn that your life is not your own. By telling me you loved me, you shared yourself with me. I’ll be damned if I let you throw your life away for some dumb puzzle.”
The sub grabbed on the other's wrist more tightly, before releasing it with a hiss. His hands went on his nape, his finger interlaced with rage, he ignored the pain on his wounded knuckles.
Dominants were used to the idea, radicated even in the most progressive ones by porn and media, that subs were just a little more than a walking fuck toy, that they would bend to their Dominant voice, trembling to submit at their power. With his sub certificate, Mycroft wasn't considered a threat anymore, and that had been by far his biggest advantage, that allowed him to climb in the darkness the stairs to reach a power that would probably be unreachable without becoming a target by any Dominant.
With the singular grandeur aura of dominance she seemed to have even toward fellow Doms,  she had taught him how to deal with even with the more troubled submissives, using her little personal harem as targets to teach John's how to punish for the longest time without damage, how to recognize symptoms of sub drop, discomfort, and need of submission that problematic subs weren't able to verbalize or even realize.
“The only thing that is left to you, the only control over your life is this” he left the pill fell on his own palm, “You should have seen the faces of the subs when they were given freedom of choice over their own life” Sherlock opened the tube, “Free for the first time in their life.” The bang of a shot broke the window.
After Mycroft and Greg left, John invited Sherlock on the couch, embracing him tenderly.
John came, a salty flavor invaded Sherlock's mouth, the sub swallowed part of it and kept sucking, covering the Dom's softening length with slow moments, opening his eyes to meet John's deep black pupils, “Stop,” the doctor panted, Sherlock immediately obeyed.
After a few hours of failing attempts, the detective had finally solved the puzzle, it wasn't that much of a challenge, really: unsurprisingly, it was the humiliation that would scare them off, the perfect way to kill their pride and wish to try to dominate him, and Sherlock needed just a few minutes to find out their deepest weakness and promptly pointing it out, in a stream of cold sharp words.
“I can smell the reek of my brother's anti-loss shampoo from a mile away” Sherlock commented dryly, “So unless you had a not programmed shower at his house after an intense chatting, I would assume you did something else.”
I hope you are all fine, thank you for keeping reading this.
John woke up, gasping for air as if he had been drowning, sweat was running on his skin.
He walked slowly, covering with far too many steps the short distance that separated him from his Dominant, feeling his knees trembling a bit as he did. John's hand pushed him, in a soothing sweet way, guiding him to bend and lay on the couch, over his knee.
All force was drained from Sherlock, his struggling let space to floating exhaustion, turning liquid beneath his Dominant, and he let himself get lost in John's rumbling carps matching the pulsing friction inside him.
“Sorry,” the Dom said smiling, “I couldn't resist”. The sub panted, unable to even express what he thought of John's apology. He heard a click as the cage was closed, weighting now on his cock. It wasn't so uncomfortable as he imagined it to be, it fastidiously pulled his pubes occasionally, and for once Sherlock was thankful he never had much hair anyway, but it wasn't such an annoyance, more a weird weight he needed to get used to.
Silence fell. John looked down at his sub, confused by what had just happened, Mycroft's smile grew bigger.
The Dominant had started to hit him quite intensely, letting his own sore pulsing palm fall on him with full force, elated by Sherlock's lustfully sounds, concentrating the strokes on few spots, covering them over and over again with rapid smacks while the sub was wetting with warm precum his other hand.
“I wanted to know if I got it right” Sherlock answered, shrugging a bit as if he couldn't see the reason for John's rage.
“All forgiven now,” John continued reassuring him, “You are so good, my good little boy”, he kissed his neck beneath his collar repeatedly, making the sub giggle. The icing blue eyes, still shining with tears but yet smiling, met John's gentle glare, and the Dom kissed his cheeks, bringing new giggles to rise.
He felt John slowly caressed his thighs as he lowered his pants and trouser, then a hand rested on his lower back, pinning him on position and somehow reassuring.
Sherlock was kneeling on the floor of his living room. His legs had started to tingle shortly after he had fallen to the position, he wondered if he was doing something wrong or if it was just a matter of practice.
He felt the leader length running beneath his curve, the friction warming him up, before the next stroke fell again, making his flesh wobbling and letting a white line across his backside.
The change in Sherlock had been so fast, he was sure the sub was on the verge of subspace, not totally gone but very close to it.
Sherlock purred, he didn't stand, he turned around, immersing himself in the other man's trousers, holding tightly the fabric, vaguely sensing the magnetic smell of arousal of John's arousal.
“Stay,” Greg ordered when they reached the bed feet, a little danger in his voice even if he knew his sub wouldn't dare to move anyway. Mycroft stood on his knees, his hands laid behind his back, waiting.
John kissed his forehead, “You did a good job, boy” he whispered, rising Sherlock's chin to force his eyes away from his crotch to meet his eyes, “I think you deserve your reward, good boy” he said. His finger brushed Sherlock's cock, teasing him through the cage for a short moment before he made it tinged opened.
His hand went to the metal legs of the bench, he grabbed them tightly, soothed by the cold of his on his fingers.
He opened his mouth in disbelief, almost choking in the silicon ball, and he shouted his eyes open, only to meet the darkness of the blindfold.
Love you all, hope you are alright.
The detective was making a point of not opening his eyes again, even if John was sure he was hearing closely any movement he did. He grabbed Sherlock's ear between his fingers, and he jerked him up from the couch.
There was a pause, “Can I read it?” Sherlock asked again, John sighed closing the laptop.
He heard a little tube's cap snapping open, and cold liquid stuff suddenly touching the intern of his thighs. The sub jumped immediately gasping.
“Forehead to the floor, hands clasped together on your back, Sherlock” John commanded. The submissive obeyed, his head hit the wooden floor with a deaf thud. He heard John retrieving the bag he had explored early, searching for something.
A young woman looked at him for a split second, the phone at her side had been ringing for a while now “The queue is right there, sir” she said, pointing at the end of the line and giving them an almost despising glare as they didn’t move. Sherlock was standing where he was, ignoring the order of the woman to go away and the protests becoming more and more colourful by the minute behind them.
The sudden emptiness made Sherlock whimpered as John exited from him, his whole body was covered with sweat and the cum and lube were sticking in a pleasant warmth his sore hole.
“Why did you wait so long to do this?” he asked, ignoring deliberately John's previous reprimand, “It is one of your favorite<, kinks, obviously” he hesitated for a brief second, “Are you aroused, already?” he dared.
The sub froze immediately, allowing himself only to bite his lips.
The Dom had told him to not have any hesitancy on calling him, even during the night, “You will be here again tomorrow, I'm sure I can manage to bear your absence for a few hours, sir” Sherlock had answered, his supposedly respectful address sounded quite sarcastic, but John was satisfied with him just using it. The sub had closed the door behind him still surprised by the light kiss through which John had told him good night.
He was kissing him, praising him with murmured words, and ensuring his total and earned forgiveness.  Sherlock let himself to be hugged, he nuzzled his face in the Doctor's soft cardigan, inhaling deeply as the sobs subsided, not quite ready to see the world yet.
John knew that he couldn't really demand Sherlock's mind to focus on his punishment for a long time and to forget the case, so he had to pick something effective and quick but still intense.
Silence fell for a few seconds, Sherlock could hear his own heart pumping, his ear was still hurting and every muscle of his body was tensing, he didn't seem able to calm his breath as much as he tried. He focused his gazed on John's shoes, he had seen anger and disappointment in the Dom's eyes that had stroke him deep in his soul.
His greenish blue eyes were moving slowly from one corpse to the other, looking at them as if he was seeing something behind them. He didn’t seem to notice the two strangers, looking at him right behind the glass door.
The Dominant stopped, he was still holding Sherlock's hair. He forced his head up, pulling firmly his head back. The sub's eyes had traces of tears and he was breathing furiously, glaring at John menacingly.
He sighed, deep in his thoughts, through the brisk air of the young evening.
He watched the catlike detective, curled up naked against him, his chest rising up and down in calm, and he wanted now to just take care of that little sub, so good for him, he wanted to protect him and treasure him so intensely.
The doctor kissed him sweetly and possessive, biting his lips as he did, and grabbing his curls, "You are mine now, Sherlock"
Sherlock looked at him with his icy clouded eyes, as his teeth bit the zip, and carefully, teasingly slowly he opened it. John fastened his belt, the sub was looking at him in trepidation, lost in his lust and smiling weakly waiting.
The crop was indeed such a wonderful instrument, an icon even, it could be so sweet and at the same time break easily the skin. John had met subs who liked to bleed under it, to be whipped without the minimum preparation, to just feel the white pain of few powerful strokes, but he didn't really enjoy it as much as he enjoyed this, to slowly see the heat building up, the colour change, going darker and beautiful red and the moans becoming screams and tears.
The pain building inexorably was pushing him to an edge, he wasn't sure if it was close to surrender or to come, his chest struggled to breathe, a lump suffocated his throat.
“Why?” Sherlock asked as John was soaking a sponge with soapy water.
The strap fell with a loud crack. The holes in the thick leather allowed the full speed to arrive on Sherlock's skin.
He felt leather fastening around his neck and a metal cold buckle being closed on his nape. John's fingers checked that the collar wasn't being too tight, Sherlock looked at him in surprise.
Sherlock finally came to a stop, grumbling at the long queue of the immigration office in front of them.
Before John could answer, the door slammed open.
He had been a trainer for years now. Most subs who needed professional training were abused ones who couldn't always remember how a sane relationship was supposed to work, but Sherlock just had never had a direct experience in the matter and, apparently, he had never cared to have one before.
His Dom had asked him to make it easy for his brother, that John counted on their cooperation to do so, and reminded that, unlike any other sub, Sherlock had never been trained before, not even the basic etiquette that was thought in school.
John coddled him for a long while, never stopping to run slow circles on his back, occasionally kissing his forehead and hair. Sherlock was looking in a not precise point in front of him, it was weird, he thought, to be comforted by the same very hands that had just punished him. His breath had returned to his normal pace, may be lighter than it was before.
Unlike Sherlock, who stubbornly liked to be the outcast genius, he had learned at a young age how to read people, not only the exterior clues of where they had been, who they slept with or similar stuff, but also what they feared, what they like to hear from him, and he had used this ability at every occasion. He had been always the one in charge, even at school, no bully would dare to come near him despite he would have been an easy target given his weight, teachers loved him and feared him at the same time, he was the headmaster pet and the youngest prefect and later head of school to ever be nominated.
When Sherlock panted breath started to calm down a bit, the Dom let the spoon fall, without stopping anymore. The sound of the swats mixed with Sherlock's poorly suffocated complaints was almost deafening him, he watched the sub struggling, curling his toes and squirming away,  almost making the chair fall under him as his skin reddened and went warmer.
Sherlock wanted to get up, to return to his mind palace, but yet something in John's tone forced him to assume the kneeling position that was becoming more and more familiar to him. As he delayed to fully obey, John twisted his ear painfully, “I said heel, Sherlock” he barked, the anger was red in his voice and his tone had raised.
The DI had arrived in the apartment after Sherlock hadn't been answering for hours, and he had found the young man lying on the armchair, half chocked in his vomit, with the elastic tourniquet still around his arm.
He stood up, throwing the disposable cup in the bin.
Love you all.
Greg walked around him, inspecting him closely, contemplating his naked, obscenely exposed sub. He pinched his ass cheek, Mycroft let a little adorable scream of surprise and shifted away.
It hadn't been his fault.
John chuckled, “Your kind?”, he asked, “That's a pretty strong statement from someone who used to be on this side of the barricade less than a week ago.”
“So,” the Dom continued, changing the subject and straightening back on his seat, “We will start with simple rules” he stated.
The belt fell, again and again, each time Sherlock would try to scream, biting down in the soap instead, he panted and drowned in the disgusting flavor as the surface of the bar went melting from his saliva, Moans tried to climb from his throat.
“It would have been a shame, to lose that amazing musical talent of yours out of such a bastard's face,”   Lestrade had commented when he had visited him, checked on him. He hadn't said anything about Sherlock's new revealed dynamic, he had kept it quiet, even if the detective had seen a concern he hadn't ever noticed on his brother's dominant's face.
There were moments in which he couldn't feel the plug, the coldness of the metal had completely subside, washed out by Sherlock's body warmth, and he was almost able to forget about it in him until a new pulse would suddenly remind him.
They had asked him about his brother's Dominant, “They could help him to set, once he wakes up,” Mycroft's world had collapsed. He had coldly answered Sherlock had been registered as Dominant, the doctor had scoffed at that, filling Mycroft with deep irritation. He wasn't used to playing the fool.
“I want to be punished,” he heard himself saying.
Mycroft's mouth curved almost imperceptibly, in that the Dom recognized the kinship with Sherlock: he had said something stupidly obvious.  The older Holmes, however, was too polite to point it out as the detective would. The sub smiled instead, “Yes, I am, Doctor, and I worry deeply for my brother's state,” he said gravely “and that's why I would like to follow every improvement he does, very closely".  The last words had been said with more emphasis.
Mycroft shrieked as he entered him, slowly but forcefully, moaning as his whole length rested for a moment inside his sub. He once again grabbed with two fingers Mycroft collar, pulling him against his cock, preventing any escape.
The familiar sensation of trepidation mixed with fear filled Sherlock's chest as he shakily climbed over the chair, hands flat on the seat. The air was cold on his naked legs, he was still wearing his pants, but not for long, he was sure.
But with Sherlock, things had gone differently. He had managed to sleep, the first night it had been out of actual exhaustion, he had chased a killer, he had shot with a steady hand, the heavy cloud of the forced civil life had been lifted and he had slept, finally. And from that night the pain in his leg had been gone and so had the nightmares.
The detective mind rushed in and out of his mind palace, he turned, quickly finding the route.
The detective obeyed, his face flushed and he avoided looking at John's eyes as he rose up.
Use your imagination, or google, for their upstairs room now (Which also needs a name, if anyone has a fancy name for it) Some of the stuff I made up (like the weird sex arbor) but you can find a ton of images of whipping benches on google.
“Yes, well, Mycroft does have that look about him. He’s always accusing someone of doing something he disapproves of. I think his face froze that way. Mummy did warn him.”
As they left the cozy internet cafe where they'd met the friends of Lilianne and Moon Young, John let out an excited exhalation of breath. Watching Sherlock out of the corner of his eyes, while trying to flag down a taxi during peak rush hour he said “They’d seen him, our Kraken tattoo guy! He was there the weekend before both Lilianne and Moon Young went missing.”
“No hospitals,” Sherlock whispered as John helped him into the back of a town car, driven by Mycroft himself. “Please, just take me home.”
“How soon, Jesper?” Sherlock asked.
“Come here,” he murmured, tugging gently at John’s dusty blond hair, “kiss me.”
“I am, and you’re wearing my collar,” John replied, reaching out to run a finger along the crimson line on Sherlock’s neck. “Okay?”
“John,” Sherlock began when Mycroft dropped them off in front of 221B. “I am truly sorry.
"Too deep, felt like I was being split open. I liked it hard and fast. It just hurt when he went too far in."
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah, I’ll head over to the club now.”
“And if all we find is an empty building and Sherlock’s clothes?” John asked while hating himself for allowing that thought room to grow inside his already worried mind.
“No, I would not. I would like my bossy and sumptuous sub to learn his place. I had such high hopes after last night,” John said. The disappointment in his voice caused Sherlock to wince in regret.
“When this stops being enjoyable,” Sherlock responded.
“I stopped by, after dropping you off here. Habit, perhaps?” Casting his brother an apologetic smile, Mycroft picked at a piece of lint on his knee. “Part of me was expecting John to drag you in, I wanted to be on hand, should my assistance be required. I stumbled upon Detective Lestrade and your club owner friend pacing the waiting room. Neither being friends or family, they weren’t allowed inside her room. With a bit of gentle persuasion from me, Lestrade was allowed inside to wait with her until her mother arrived. Under the guise of getting her statement, of course.”
“Because you are, Sherlock. This is why I’m going to suggest we pull ourselves out of bed and go have a long talk about what we want from this relationship.” There was a hint of regret in John’s voice, his desire to stay in bed all day apparent. “I’m going to propose a contract, not as a binding document, but mainly as an organized piece of paper with all our desires and expectations. Typically I don’t request one at the start, but this is the first time I’ve ever lived with my sub. We have our lives we need to take into account, and a contract will help us with that.”
“Great, so you replaced drugs with sex?” John asked, wondering what Sherlock’s sexual history looked like on paper.
“I want to feel safe again, John. I desire for someone to
The faint
“Sort of, yeah… we haven’t really… I just want you to be comfortable.” John stammered out then let out an embarrassed laugh. “Jesus, I’m a doctor for crying out loud, yet you’ve gone and turned me into a blushing teenager again. I’m fine, with anal sex. With our without douching. How about I just lay a towel down, and we take it moment by moment? I’ll stop over-analyzing it.”
“You’re slipping, old man,” John ribbed, moving around behind the chair, guiding Sherlock’s right arm into the proper place. “I like this on you,” John whispered as he slipped the leather bracelet higher up Sherlock’s arm, making room for the rope. Sherlock watched, breath coming in short gasps as John wound the rope around his wrist and the back of the chair.
“Two girls are missing,” John said softly, though he understood Sherlock’s excitement. It had been weeks since the last case that hadn’t been missing jewelry or a domestic squabble.
“Yeah, we’ll do it,” John said, without hesitation. “Whatever you need, we’ll get it done.”
here,” John said grumpily.
The army had taught him how to handle men like Mycroft. Ten years ago, a man like him would have frayed every ounce of John’s patience. Now he simply felt annoyed, like he had a mosquito bite that wouldn’t stop itching. The army had also taught him that respect could be earned, and it was his turn to show Mycroft that he was worthy of even a small measure of respect.
“Oi, take a man's collar off for a flight and suddenly he thinks he’s the one calling the shots,” John whispered then pulled Sherlock’s thighs apart to keel between them. “I did bring the infinity collar if you’d like to take a spin on top for a day or two.”
Though his question was directed at Zed, John didn’t take his eyes off Sherlock’s intense gaze. Having read his lips, Sherlock smirked and rolled his eyes.
John ran his hand down Sherlock’s back once more, then turned his back to the crowd so no one could see his mouth.
The two men stared at each other, sizing one another up with stern looks. John found himself thankful that both hands were currently occupied, helping mitigate the desire to introduce his fist to the other man’s eye socket. After what felt like an eternity to John, the other man snorted, then turned and began walking towards the exit. John blew a hard breath out through pursed lips, then went to join Sherlock on unsteady feet.
Matching Sherlock’s chuckle John knelt on the bed, he ran his hands down Sherlock’s thighs and let out a slow breath.
“I should have played the lottery while I was out.”
I'm sorry, I guess?
“Alright,” John agreed while he pressed a soft kiss to Sherlock’s forehead. “Do you need to do anything… to be more comfortable?”
"It's alright if you don't love me back. Sherlock..." It was like someone hit him over the head with a croquet mallet.
"Fuck. Dear God, yes Sherlock. That feels... You feel fucking amazing. You're actually amazing at this." John groaned. By now his hand had moved to grip Sherlock's hair, clenching and releasing in rhythm to invisible thrusting. Sherlock took as much of the thick shaft into his mouth as he could and used his other hand to stimulate the lower half. The stretching out of his lips and throat and the ache in his jaw intensified but he was too overjoyed to hear John coming undone under his work to even consider stopping. He bobbed his head up and sank back down, again and again, working his hand on the part of the shaft he couldn't fit in his mouth in a concurrent rhythm. After another deep groan and raspy gasp and Sherlock bobbed up and down faster.
He wrapped his lips around the head once more, and this time was gifted by a groan so deep it was nearly subsonic.
Sherlock swallowed. He was bad with these things but then never in his life did he want to protect and comfort and help another person as much as he did John.
Should he continue? Should he let John rest?
"Oh darling. It's just... I want you to be happy and I know you." Now it was her turn to cup his pale face. "I
He didn't understand? Was she upset with him? Was she ashamed of him? She'd never been embarrassed for his lifestyle before. She and daddy had always known he was gay and together they had never been anything but supportive.
Sherlock froze, his face growing hot. In that second, Sherlock could feel the air rushing in and out of his lungs, his relentlessly rapid heartbeat, a needy sort of joy rising up inside him. "John, I ..."
Feeling that the right thing would be the latter he pulled back his hand, ruffled his curls and let out a tired sign. He knew John needed sleep, the dark bags under his eyes were nearly black. The good thing would be to let him go back to sleep, but part of Sherlock couldn't bear to leave him. "Do you want some water?" he asked, making to stand up. John's hand flew and gripped his shoulder tightly, bringing him back down to the bed.
Luckily, society didn't have the biases it did in the past. So while some still frowned upon it, most just rolled their eyes when Sherlock garbled on and on about his latest Alpha conquest.
When Mycroft found himself bent on the padded trestle, with his ankles and wrists cuffed, his breath was already accelerating, his heart pounding, the sweat sticking his skin to the leather as the blood rushed to his head.
He then pulled back, to enter him again with renovated force.
Greg made a sign to his men, they immediately went to the room Sherlock had indicated, “I told you hundreds of times, Sherlock, you can't steal pieces of evidence or heads will roll, including mine” the Dom yelled, getting menacingly nearer to the sub.
Sherlock's head was spinning, he looked at his hands on the floor in front of him, his feet were barely touching the ground.
“Sir,” he started, his voice sounded pleading, a bit more than a whisper, he stopped, did he really deserve it? Would John refused as he had ruined the scene already, maybe he had screwed up his chance, “What is it, pet?” the Doctor encouraged him, he had noticed the blue eyes had been staring at the crop. Sherlock licked his lips, trying to find his words again “Would you please use it on me?”
Sherlock inhaled deeply, returning with a little pleading moan to his position.
“Is that some kind of leftover from your military past, or it just turns you on?” Sherlock asked acrimoniously. The Dom smiled and answered, “It's a pretty standard sign of respect and politeness,”  he still was not giving the sub the satisfaction of visibly irritating him, “that you seem to have forgotten already”.
Guess what, more smut!
Love you all and I hope you enjoy it!
The morning after the detective had dryly texted him he had work to do and wouldn't be available. John had respected his need for space, he would still check on him daily, he texted him on how he was doing, if he was eating and sleeping regularly, he had obtained only short dismissive answers but nothing that sounded like a drill of danger.
“Oh, I know you are busy,” John said, “Detective inspector Lestrade called me,” he added. Sherlock opened his eyes for a brief moment, he glared at John, sighed, and then returned to his strange meditation position.
“Mmmh” John considered while he pushed the end a bit further in him, the sub moaned, “I guess we can try,” he said finally.
John stroke his hair, hushing him with sweet words and inviting him to stand up.
John didn't care to answer the statement, limiting himself to just fold his arms.
He could feel the musky scent of John's pubes and the salty taste of pre-cum, it was inebriating, he closed his eyes, losing himself in it.
He hadn't been lying when he had told Sherlock he didn't like to repeat himself, the fact he had to punish him for the second time for the same offense actually annoyed him, but he couldn't help to feel pleasure on seeing Sherlock sticking up his pearly arse, obediently waiting for his punishment.
Greg gave a sharp swat on Mycroft's ass, it resonated on the room, barely muffed by the sub's trousers, “Do you want to join your brother, since you find it so amusing?” he reprimanded him. The older sub flushed red to the point of his ears, “No, please, sir” he begged with his head bowed down, “I apologize, sir”.
The position Sherlock was now on was quite uncomfortable, his legs' muscles had started to hurt, stretched out as they were.
Mycroft entered Sherlock's flat and for once, he was surprised and, judging by his Dom's face, Greg was surprised too. The living room was tidy, it looked bigger than before and the light, that first was disturbed by the number of things piled up everywhere, made it looked like a completely different room.
John had actually chuckled at them, finding them even more entertaining than the show itself.
Or that was was he hoping to be able to show, Sherlock had indeed been rather good lately, he had cleaned his flat as John had asked him to, he had started to let the pleasure of obedience in small things show, enjoying deeply his rewards and feeling sorry for his infractions.
With his surprise though, John smiled, widely. It wasn't the sweet proud smile with which he was rewarded when he did something good, it was an almost frightening smile.
Sherlock panted, and obeyed, his brain barely thinking about the words, he stammered, “Thank you, Sir”, the last word got on a pinching tone as John stroke his cock again, sending a new lightening on his oversensitive skin and the pleasant trembling in his legs.
“Come on, I'm too uncomfortable here, I'm too old for this” John said, and with Sherlock's surprise and an exaggerated huff, he lifted the sub. Despite the height difference, Sherlock was still quite underweight and Captain Watson managed to pick him up in his arms and carry him.
Sherlock let out a scream, it hurt, so much that he couldn't help it, despite himself. John let him recovered a bit from the surprise, watching the redness the spoon had already let on Sherlock's pale skin.
His ropes had been removed, he shifted against Greg, nuzzling in his chest. The DI hugged him, caressing his sweaty hair, and kissed him, “Are you feeling better now, pet?” he asked with a voice so sweet that melted Mycroft's heart, “Yes, thank you, sir” he murmured.
. He closed his eyes for a brief moment, sighing loudly, trying to ease the instinct of punching the younger man right away.
Greg knew he was too much of a good sub to do such a thing unless it really wasn't necessary for his job, but yet, Mycroft had bowed down, touching his Dom's shoes with his forehead and he had begged for his penance and absolution. And his Dom had obliged.
The sub's skin soon turned of a deep red colour, and his legs were trembling visibly now, but still waiting with conflicted wish the next time the paddle would fall, arching back to position. Greg chuckled deeply as he left the paddle aside.
The Doctor was still holding the crop in his hand, as Sherlock saw it moving, he shouted his eyes closed, embracing himself for the blow that never came. John raised his chin with the crop extremity, “Don't forget your position, boy” he said, quite sweetly. Sherlock, surprised, straightened up again instantly.
“Have you packed anything at all?” He asked, glaring at his roommate. Sherlock’s fingers finally stopped for a moment, raising his eyes from the display “What for?” was his frowned replay. The doctor looked up again, taking a deep breath, “Right, what for” he muttered, finally getting in the car while Sherlock returned to his typing.
“I didn't curse at you, or insult you,” John continued failing to acknowledge his sub clearly infuriated eyes, “I treated you with the basic respect any civilized person would use without receiving the same favor from you.”
They had crossed the road and went to the restaurant near Baker Street flat.
“You don't have sugar?” John asked, almost spitting the coffee back in the mug with a disgusted face. Sherlock was kneeling at his side, “I didn't have coffee in this house before you,” he said dryly, he had always preferred tea over coffee, if he needed to sharpen the mind he usually recurred to way stronger resources than caffeine.
She was sitting on the couch in front of him, wearing latex as she loved to, it drew her legs beautifully, crossed elegantly over the white sofa.
Sherlock looked at him with defiance as he stood up, with a last exasperated sigh he interlaced his finger behind his head.
“I took my collar off without permission,” the older Holmes had explained, feeling Sherlock's glare.
John's hand opened his cheeks with careful movements, tasting Sherlock's pinched whimpers swallowed by the sheets. He opened him revealing the sub's pulsing hole, he caressed it with the tip of the crop, draining pitiful sounds from the boy, and then hit it with a quick smack.
Sherlock shook his head,
But becoming a trainer wasn't so immediate as someone might think. If in a normal relationship the Dom could always count on the sub knowing their own limits, to safeword easily when they recognize the start of panic rising, in training that knowledge wasn't granted at all. Irene, besides her work as a disciplinarian, also trained both Dominants and subs.
He was dragged, with not much delicacy, and thrown across the coffee table. His arms ached, he could feel his wrist signed by the coarse rope, the clamps hurt as his nibbles touched the cold hard surface of the wood. John was holding the jute, making it even tighter around his arms. Almost unconsciously, Sherlock moved his fingers, they tingled and felt a bit cold but he could move them. It really was sort of reassuring.
John was truly done with him, but seeing those eyes flashing, and immediately cast down as the sub's cheeks reddened made him smile deep down.
“Those too, boy,” John told sternly, without even glaring at him, still observing the riding crop as it had never seen one before.
When Greg stopped, Mycroft was crying, tears and spit had gone mixing, wetting the sheets.
John rolled his eyes, he grasped without the least trace of delicacy Sherlock's hair, dragging him to the living room. The sub, taken by surprise, tried to fight, managing only to yell an “Oi!” as he was forced to crawl, after all, scrambling his feet as he tried to catch up with the Doctor's pace to not get his scalp torn away.
Every order John's commanding voice gave started to have an effect on him, and he, every time more and sincerely, whispered “Yes, Sir” as he rushed to oblige.
Greg smiled delighted, accepting the sub plead, he kissed his shoulders blades, and slowly he reached the sub's hole with his hand, starting to open it watching as the sub gasped out of the air at the pain, and yet started to thrust himself against it, moving back as much as the cuffs would allow him, opening his hole and tensing it, milking his finger as Greg had taught him to do with his cock.
Only after he had asked again if he was fine, hours after Sherlock's very first punishment, and the detective had rolled his eyes and answered exhausted, “Yes, I am fine, you are repeating yourself to exasperation,” and yet added a Sir (even if quite belated and only after seeing John's eyebrow rose), the Doctor had been satisfied with the sub's state of mind.
In front of her, a female sub was tied up, on all four on the floor. She was gagged and blindfolded, the purple silk ropes were sinking in her white flesh, the pink diamond end of a but plug was shining between her legs. On her back, precariously balanced, a glass of white wine was sweating pearly water that rolled on her skin. John was sure if even a drop of wine got spilled, the sub would pay harshly.
John grasped his hard cock. The sub gulped with a panted breath, immediately stopping his trashing and tensing rigidly, “You are not taking this very gracefully, are you, boy?” he asked tauntingly. Sherlock didn't answer, limiting himself to let a huff in the pillow beneath him.
He had always been a weird Dominant, he was actually so bad at acting like one that the fact nobody had ever suspected the truth before his dramatic sub drop was surprising even considering the idiocy of humankind. But on the other hand, he had never acted as a sub either, happy in his limbo between the two and far from both sides.
The doctor glared at that annoying light that had followed them throughout that infinite trip, giving him the alien and unpleasant sensation of an unnatural long day.
“What are you writing?” Sherlock asked, leaning behind John's shoulder.
As he grabbed a chair, Sherlock's heart started to pump loudly on his ears, the little part of him still out of play noticed that the door of the room had been left open. Mycroft and Greg could definitely hear them and likely even watch them from the living room.
The Dom tutted, coloring his skin with a sharp slap, “Only a few days and you already forget how to behave?” he asked teasingly, pleasure ran in him as he saw the sub tensing.
“Why do you have Lestrade's phone?” John asked, he was trying to be calm with the sub, the absurdity of the situation was kind of helping him with the rage he knew he should be feeling.
“You know,” the cabbie said, “I was twelve when I resulted submissive,” he said, “A bit early, even for those times” he sighed heavily, “It was different back then, subs would be frown upon if they had a job, you were supposed to be meek, shy, not seen or heard, stay home be a good pet” his resent permeated his voice., “You know where being a good pet lead me to?” he asked rhetorically, “My Domme left me for a better sub, the children I raise barely find time to see me, I had no experience in any job, I didn't even finish the school, my dad didn't see why bothering to pay for the education of a submissive,” he paused, “fifty fifty, it seemed fair to this world, I don't see why it shouldn't be fair for this” he added smiling.
Sherlock had been suspended from the case, with the order to go home, get himself set, and ready to behave like a civilized person again.
The sub's teeth bit the sheets, his eyes opened wide as his breath was taken away.  John's hand grabbed his, forcing his arm to bend over his back, interlacing his fingers with his own, reassuring and yet possessive. His cock entered him repeatedly, in and out with more and more force, John's grunts mixed with Sherlock's moans turning in screams as he went rougher and the bed cracking.
He had been sitting, in the DI's office, bored by Lestrade's lecture on how to properly behave in a crime scene or something.
“I'm not sure I follow you,” John said, frowning.
Mycroft was smiling too, Greg grabbed his thin hair, “And you,” he said menacingly, “Try not to make it so hard for your brother for once” he commanded. “Yes, sir” Mycroft answered immediately.
“I don't see why it should go otherwise,” John answered dryly, something in his tone sent a sparkle down the sub's spine.
The agents returned in the living room, holding a striking pink suitcase, “Well, good luck, Doctor Watson,” Greg said, “I will let you deal with him”.
Sherlock was panting around the gag ball, his cock was hard, fully erected, and covered with John's saliva, his skin was pearled with sweat.
The sub wheezed with painful relief as the pressure on his erection was finally released. John kissed him once more, and then stroke his cock. Sherlock whimpered, hiding his face against Dom's chest, breathing deeply against his shirt, smelling his scent.
The panted shrieks each blow provoked were a true blessing and each time the sub exposed himself a bit more, going liquid beneath the pain that he was inflicting, he could feel he was losing his mind.
Shakingly, Sherlock straightened up his legs, forcing his arms to stretch so that his hands went to his ankles again.
Sherlock had fought it a bit, pulling it repeatedly and finally, he had resigned, letting himself fall face down on the floor with a complaining groan. At that John, truly done, had asked him if he really preferred to welcome his brother while kneeling in the corner and with new marks of the belt on his bottom instead and Sherlock immediately, even if not exactly graciously, had obeyed and knelt.
John bit the base of his neck, his teeth pressed painfully on his skin as the warm blessed liquid entered him, heating his insides. The sub felt the Dom's body trembling over him as he came inside him, his fingers, still squeezing his hand, became an almost painful grip.
Sherlock continued “And for the same reason you followed that cab with me, for the same reason you went to meet a serial killer alone, without calling any help, with just a gun in your hands” he added, “And don't tell me there was no time for the backup to arrive, you met my brother after all,” he was meeting John's eyes, “And for the same reason you forgot about your walking stick a while ago” he finished.
The detective's gaze was more than a sufficient answer to the obviously rhetorical question.
Love you all.
Sherlock's broken tears wet the soft wool of John's cardigan, together with white soap stains, while the doctor kept praising him, for how good he had taken his punishment, for how beautiful he was like this, and assuring him his so agonized forgiveness.
He could hear John was starting to moan, that almost drove him insane, he was making his Dom happy, filling him with pleasure, reproaching the favor John had made him earlier that morning. He was useful, fulfilled, “My good boy”. He sensed vaguely his own cock was twisting inside his pants but he didn't let it distract him this was about his Dom and his pleasure alone.
“Do you know what is this?” The doctor asked, ignoring Sherlock's silent sulking, he showed the detective a little metal object, the look the young man gave him was more than eloquent, but the Dom waited for a verbal response. Sherlock sighed loudly, “It's a chastity cage” he answered dryly, trying desperately to suppress the blush flushing violently on his cheeks.
A hand caressed Sherlock's shoulders, gently making return him to a resemblance of reality, “Time is up,” John's voice cuddled him, “You have been such a good boy”.
“That you are an addict, as much as I am” Sherlock answered ignoring the sparkle Dom's anger had lighted in him, “And that you ignored your needs as much as I did, and pretended to be someone else,” he added, more cautiously.
The red words “Tattle Crime” on the top of the screen of his phone, were glowing gloomily on the black background. The doctor -- after he had managed to convince Sherlock to give him that bit of information at least -- had spent his flight skimming through the news articles. They were a showcase of opinions, suggestions intertwined with insubstantial facts and evidence mostly gathered while violating crime scene regulations or private property rights.
Sherlock sighed deeply, “Bedroom, closet,” he said simply.
The detective could feel his whole new life being dissected by his brother's glare, his newfound tastes, the punishments he deep down enjoyed, and the rules he followed now, all was, despite himself, transpiring and bringing a subtle smile on Mycroft's face.
Only instead of meeting storm blue eyes and a disappointed frown, the gaze that met his was black as night. Jim Moriarty stood with his hip leaning against the doorway. As casually as if he belonged inside Baker Street. His midnight blue suit looked almost black in the dim light, and the shadows from the hall caused the twisted grin on his face to ooze a mix of lust and hatred.
“I think you’ll find my request for secrecy to be well founded, but allow me to explain. And listen well, we might not have a chance to speak again before your assistance is required.”
to whatever image was floating in that brain of his. Pulling John’s jumper a bit more snugly over his groin, Sherlock’s lips floated into a smile as he shifted on the chair.
texted me. Asking if I
“Of course, orgasms and physical affection have no effect on me.” Sherlock teased back as John sauntered up to his side.
Sherlock nearly rolled his eyes a second time as he muttered a quick apology, then pushing past the embarrassing task of being polite, quickly caught Mycroft up on the instructions given to him by Moriarty.
It wasn’t unlikely that he could have slipped past the check-in point, both nights had been busy, and Zed didn’t charge an entrance fee. So there would be no need to stop a single man if he had entered with a party or with someone he was pretending to be with. Sherlock had first wondered how Zed managed to keep the club afloat, but a quick look at the price of drinks and food answered that. Plus, those who had been singing karaoke had needed to produce a raffle ticket to get on stage; no doubt Zed charged a small fee for that.
Friday dragged by for John. He felt as if time were moving backward. Towards the end of his shift, he even began fantasizing about leaving early, wondering if he gave the order if Sherlock would create a mock emergency that required his immediate attention at home.
“Does it matter? Yes, I can see it matters to you, thirty seconds at most. I heard him come up the stairs. Flip over the notepad, John, if you don’t want him reading that.” Sherlock’s hands darted to the rope around his neck then his panicked gaze fell on John’s face.
"Third, and lastly, John and I need your assistance in a missing persons case."
“No, it should be fine,” Zed spoke up, glancing over at Page, who nods. “Paige is a Dominatrix who specializes in male subs.”
“I assume the police were alerted. A report made?” John asked, and to Sherlock’s annoyance, he leaned forward a fraction of an inch, his feet sliding out in front of him and nearly brushing against one of her dark heels.
Sherlock thought,
“Curious about the lifestyle, but not willing to commit,” Sherlock stated softly, having once been there, he understood.
“Hers, though I’m a concerned party.” Zed started to say, but he was cut off by a sharp trill echoing up the stairs.
“Let’s just say it didn’t make it to evidence. Things do go missing now and then.” Greg chuckled darkly. After a moment he looked over at John and gave him an appraising look. “You alright, mate?”
This is like the 5th time I've edited these damned notes LOL. If you spot any typos in the fic please let me know. I'll admit that I'm practically blind to typos after reading over a chapter umpteen times. I'm trying hard to catch them all, but I'm only human.
“They never take me, dressed like this. I would have had to walk home if you hadn’t been there tonight.”
Sherlock’s first reaction was to shut John’s theory down. John might be capable of thinking up clever punishments and mind-blowing sex. But his powers of deduction were lacking. Instead, Sherlock stamped down the desire to remind John to leave the thinking to the genius (him) and gave John a pleasant smile before kindly explaining how his theory was wrong.
“We’ve been calling,” Mycroft said, his voice pinched with annoyance.
Sherlock began toying his tongue slowly along the underside of the shaft in his mouth. He applied no real amount of suction, nor did he bob his head. He simply knelt there, gliding his tongue left and right, flicking it up once just far enough that he felt the groves of John’s glans, before sliding back down to the base.
“Your brother? Are we suddenly expecting him?” John didn’t bother smoothing out the edge of annoyance in his voice. Mycroft Holmes never visited for pleasure. He only visited when he wanted something, usually at Sherlock's expense. His visits usually sent Sherlock into a black mood, making life in the flat unbearable for both of them.
.” John tapped the pen on the paper again, leaving dark blue dots behind in its wake. “Oh.”
“We could, if you would like, consider this to be your first step in training. If we agree to continue at the end of the week, we can upgrade you to the next collar.”
“Of course you’d enjoy this,” John muttered darkly, “But let’s see how you enjoy it when your cock is locked away, unable to get stimulated no matter how hard you try.”
Sherlock stood and began to walk away, but John quickly grabbed his hand, stopping him before he’d taken more than a single step.
Sherlock crept closer, very carefully and very softly, placed his hand on John's upper left chest, warm and solid under his touch. With the smallest of shifts, he began gently rubbing along John's shoulder, feeling the muscles there tense and bunch. All the time he tried comforting John in the softest of voices.
That night he went home and sobbed into his pillow until he passed out.
“Yes Sherlock. That’s very good. So good."
He started going faster and watched John stroked his cock in time with the new speed. The sights and smells were intoxicating. Sherlock felt himself reach that edge and thank God, John's hand became a blur over his cock and he knew he must be close. Sherlock cried out as he came inside John.
Sherlock immediately bounded out of bed and ran upstairs to find the man in the middle of one of his truly terrible nightmares; he was jerking back and forth, making broad sweeping motions with his fists as if he was fighting someone off.
"That was amazing." John chuckled. Sherlock looked at John who's entire face was dripping with sweat. He had the insane notion of licking it off.
"John, it's alright. You're alright." He whispered; he knew he had to be careful. One wrong move and John could go wild and break  -- in a flash John's groans roared into a loud shout. He bolted upright and his hand snapped closed around Sherlock's wrist before he could pull it away.
Sherlock wanted to keep exploring him a bit, so he worked around the thighs and abdomen, pinched and licked the salty sweaty skin from time to time. Just to see what sort of reactions they would elicit. Always positive ones he noted with a grin.
There was just no getting around it. Sherlock loved Alphas.
(See the end of the chapter for
." He managed to get out between moans.
Inwardly he cringed at the thought of even touching an Omega, but for his mother...His lovely, beautiful sweet mother, surly he could at least see what was out there.
He encouraged John to stroke himself while he set a steady rhythm. He changed the angle a few times until a guttural moan ripped out John's throat. "God yes!"
..." In a flash, John had Sherlock on his back and his hot, hot mouth had sucked down the entirely of Sherlock's erection. "Ah!" He keened and arched and couldn't help but thrust inside John's mouth. But his mind was still able to process the situation. The last thing he wanted was John having to pay attention to Sherlock. This was about Sherlock paying attention to
He might not have had any working experience with this, but he's read up enough times, watched enough porn, and quite frankly, Sherlock had dreamed of this moment for so long it was as if he were doing it all by rote. John tasted as salty and bitter as he imagined, and smelled even muskier. A heavenly aroma of pure male. Best of all, John was reacting even better than he could have fantasized.
His mother sobbed when he came home after turning 26 and instead of telling her about a pretty Omega he'd had a relationship with, told her at joyful length about the hunky bartender he'd met in Soho and dear god did he have a knot on him.
The morning started out not entirely unusual in apartment 221B. Sherlock woke to low deep groaning that sounded like a man in pain and he froze. It was muffled and came from the ceiling, meaning only one thing. John's room, which meant he was having another nightmare.
Sherlock gave up Omegas entirely after that. But something broke inside him, too. There was the plain fact that he really did want children. Before this silly jaunt into speed dating he'd been able to lie to himself, ignore the fact it was unlikely he would ever have any of his own naturally. Now, in the cold, sad light of his first post-attempt into finding an Omega, any Omega, attractive, he saw just how impossible it was.
Spluttering Sherlock's face turned a bright peony color. "Are you sure."
Sherlock giggled at the innuendo.
"Nothing compared to you," Sherlock breathed. He kissed John again, once more dominating the kiss and letting John taste himself, simultaneously tasting his own precome on John's tongue. John hummed and bent his knees so that Sherlock could press a finger inside. God, he was blood hot. Hot and perfect. "Oh John. I can't wait to be inside you."
John lifted Sherlock to his feet and then they both, in one motion together, sat on the bed and clasped each others hands, seeking and giving comfort mutually. It was Sherlock who was more insistent, however, and after he tried a few dominating gestures a few times, John finally submitted to the detective's soft hands stroking his face and wiping away his tears. John finally looked up, his gorgeous cobalt navy blue eyes meeting Sherlock's pale blue, aero eyes.
"Okay. Now you're turn. Get these off," Sherlock whined, clawing at the waistband of John's boxers until they joined the heap. "Oh." He breathed out.
He didn't even realize he was doing it until it was too late. He leaned over and kissed John square on the mouth. It was both instantaneous and lifelong. John's lips were surprisingly hot, full of blood, and even though John didn't react to the kiss, Sherlock felt an electric spark zing through him.
"No. I don't suppose you do. This is your first foray since you broke up with you Alpha after all. Oh, sorry. I should say since he broke up with you. Your penchant for online shopping wasn't it?" Sherlock didn't even get to finish the last sentence before the glass of water was tossed in his face.
Unfortunately, the next Omega smelled even worse: cupcakes and apricots.
Sherlock gasped. "Never." He said solemnly.
"No!" Sherlock cried. "How can you even think of saying sorry when you were hurting and I...I was the one who should have...should have known what to do... I should always be there for you." His hand suddenly found itself in the thick short bristles on John's greying hair. It felt amazing to finally get to feel John's hair. It was slightly sweaty but Sherlock didn't care. "I made a vow, remember. To be there for you."
Heartened, and ardently turned on by the reactions he was getting out of the man, Sherlock slid an inch or two of the thick shaft into his mouth, feeling the cock stretch his throat. He was rewarded by a throaty rumble that he could practically feel reverberate through his chest, so he put one hand around the base and slid further down John's cock, feeling the thick, hot, hardness of it filling his throat.
Because of my belated visit.
Asking someone for a miracle.
The doctor looked up to the detective. He seemed to be completely consumed by the book. Should he ask him? John felt heat rushing to his head. Due to his tan, he didn’t blush as fast as Sherlock, but he felt that the blush was coming. Watson closed his eyes and concentrated on his breathing. It didn’t happen. It just couldn’t have been. But even if it did happen… What, actually, happened? He came home really knackered. And a friend just helped him clean up. He would have helped him, too, if the chance arose. He means not the chance, of course, but the need. Yes!  If the need arose!
I interrupted. I think I’ll go…
Let me tell you “I am sorry”
The detective held on until he heard the front door shut on the first floor. So he climbed out from the blanket and read the message. Although John was writing in an uncomfortable position, his handwriting was much better than that of the detective.
Is a big weight upon my shoulders.
Sherlock put aside the sponge. Took one of Watson’s feet and put it on his knee. The knee that was wrapped by the wet denim fabric. Glancing over his torso, covered by the moist cloth, John focused on the detective’s delicate hands, which caressed his ankle, whipping shower gel into foam. He gently began to massage the heel, the arch of the foot, and then — surprisingly gently — each toe.
John wasn’t surprised anymore. Later, when he wakes up somewhere on the couch, or even on the hospital floor, he’ll think about all the glitches, but now, leaning on Sherlock’s shoulder, it took all his power to put one foot in front of the other and walk to his room. There, he was seated on the bed, unraveled from the towel, dressed in a T-shirt and trousers he had been sleeping in recently.
“I could be wrong…”
John sat down and stared at the plate. He woke up in bed. In his own bed. Not in a hospital, blighted by glitches. So he did walk home last night. But that doesn’t mean yesterday’s bathing…
“Did I hear you? The great and powerful Sherlock said ‘I could be wrong’? This has to be remembered. And written down. You will deny that you said that.”
“I’d carry you in my arms,” said Sherlock, looking the completely naked doctor up and down, “but unfortunately, I can’t. So come on, lean against my shoulder and slowly, carefully…”
Don't get out of your comfort zone
The movements of Sherlock’s fingers cleared out all his thoughts out of his head.
“How many will be punished?”
No, he didn’t go in with the sponge. But the, slick with gel, fingers…
He didn’t know who shouted it, but it was clear that there would be no respite.
After finishing his feet, Sherlock performed another general cleansing and turned off the water. Then wrapped John in a big fluffy towel and just held him for a few moments. Once again, “my love” was whispered in his ear.
He almost jumped when his own phone vibrated. Thank heavens, if there’s something to occupy the brain, the heart can be ignored.
“What… what happened? How could that happen?!”
Crouching beside my poor gravestone,
Tired of languishing on the doorstep.
“Really? I didn’t notice. If I didn’t notice something, then it’s not relevant. Relax and have fun, you really deserve it. And far better than what I’ve been able to give you so far.”
“Of course. I don’t remember things like that. And neither should you.”
“I like it but… but I’m embarrassed. There’s rough skin and calluses… besides…”
He lurched on the stool. Sherlock was right there. The doctor put his nose in his shoulder. In the wet shirt. Seems to be the same one he gave the detective last Christmas. Yeah, synthesising hallucinations the brain takes real things and…
The zombie closed the door, leaned his back against it and slowly crawled to the floor. Sherlock was following this chain of events with great interest. When the struggle against gravity was finally lost, he rose, with a sigh of regret, put the book on the chair, and headed for the door.
"I don't normally see an Alpha wearing such tight trousers. It shows off your plump butt." Her voice was high and lilting and Sherlock instantly hated it. Worse of all was her scent. It was light and sweet and made Sherlock feel sick every time he had to breath it in.
want children. Like a persistent ache, however, he learned to live around it, beside it. Not having children wasn't the end of the world after all. He raised his face and bit his bottom lip as his mother continued, his baby blue eyes meeting her identical pair. "Oh, I don't mind that you're gay, Sherlock, nor does your father. It's your life and ultimately your decision, but there's no getting around the fact that, well, having sex only with other Alphas will never get you a family. You should at least
now, is it? I'll have you know I didn't go to years and years of medical school and training just to be called..." John shouted a gruff, drawn out, inarticulate syllable when Sherlock's mouth opened wide and tentatively engulfed the head of John's cock. Sherlock kept John like that for several moments, just appreciating the blissful fullness of the head stuffed inside his mouth. John hissed and cursed, his hands at his sides, fisting the bed sheets.
Sherlock tried, and failed, to suppress a giggle, despite the heat of the John's words. "Nice turn of phrase,
John pulled back with a slurp, and grinned. "Sorry. I definitely want you in me, but couldn't help myself. You taste delicious."
"I won't." He said ruefully. "At least I'll try to push them away." A broad grin formed on his face. "But you know, if I do have another nightmare, I have that to look forward to." He then burst into laughter and Sherlock started giggling, too. They kept like this for almost a full minute. John brought Sherlock's curly head closer to his chest, and Sherlock, his hiccupping giggles now finally abated, wrapped his arms around John best he could, and let his eyes flutter closed as he fell asleep. Holding John as John held him they fell asleep together.
“Oh God. You’re so good." The husk of John's gravelly voice and the burning hot words he spoke caused Sherlock to mewl around the length, and move faster with his mouth and his hand. He felt powerful and desired and completely in control and extremely aroused. Having John Watson completely at his mercy due to Sherlock giving him pleasure. It was a heady combination of sensations.
"I'm fine. John," he gasped. "It's you...you were having a nightmare. I wanted to wake you gently. It's worked in the past. I must not have as quiet as I thought."
"None of that now." He pushed John's hand away. "This is about you, Mr. Watson."
anymore."
"John you are my entire world. You are perfect. Those nightmares. They aren't you. I deserved those...instances. You know it and I know it. Your subconscious wants to make you feel guilty but please know there's nothing to be guilty about. I was the one who left you without explaining why. Mary performed psychological torture on both of us. We have each other now. She's gone now. Please don't let me spoil
Everyone who knew him knew Sherlock was gay.
He didn't need anyone after all.
Sherlock yelped at the strong grip. John certainly knew many ways to break a wrist but right now it felt as if he was going to simply squeeze the delicate bones together until they crumbled under the intense pressure.
Sherlock squirmed in his seat as the Omega sitting across from the table batted her lashes and brought her index finger to her mouth, an obvious seduction maneuver. Her nails were painted the same red shade as her lips, which were so plump she had to use filler.
"Oh, it's
Head spinning at the smell and feel of another man beneath him, Sherlock couldn't stop making small moans and breathless gasps, and hearing John's echoing sexy groans just intensified the passion inside his core. After he deemed John 'snogged silly,' Sherlock released him and wandered down his impressively muscled body. Nothing showy, just the natural breadth and strength of an ex-soldier. John's hands did the same with his body, and on that account Sherlock had nothing to be embarrassed about. He knew he was quite fit, as he secretly employed a personal trainer. But it just made him more in awe of how gorgeous John looked without the special workouts and yoga Sherlock employed consistently. Sherlock played with John's nipples until they were a dark ruddy colour, very much appreciating how John groaned and sighed at the lavish attention paid there. Moving further down he admired how John's skin wasn't fully bronzed like it got in the summer months but it was still several shades darker than Sherlock's hands, making for a lovely contrast. Made more gorgeous at how ruddy and flushed his skin became as Sherlock worked his way down until there, at the center of the man, between two thick, muscular legs, a thicket of wild pubic hair, stood his gorgeous cock. It pulsed, a gentle throb, in time with John's heartbeat.
"You’re going to make me come soon." Thrilled to think he would be able to make John come from his first attempt at a blow job, an emboldened Sherlock looked up, just for a second, and saw John's dark eyes looking back at him. Gone was the normal navy blue colour of before, it was entirely  black in desire.
I need to do
"No. Don't leave me. Please."
In an instant and sounding like a wounded animal, John was on the ground next to him, rattling his shoulders, shaking Sherlock's body like a ragdoll under his strong hands. "Sherlock, Sherlock, I'm so sorry." John sobbed thickly. Sherlock could see he was crying now, tears starting to fall against his cheek.
if he was being honest with himself. He pulled back and narrowed his eyes, seeing John smirking down at him.
John chuckled a bit, staring ahead and looking a bit uncomfortable. He scrubbed a hand across his face and sighed deeply while they continued sitting next to each other, not saying a word. In those minutes of aching silence, Sherlock couldn't stop looking at his handsome face, every crevice and line and curve was gorgeous. His eyes fell to his lips, thin and slightly chapped, and surrounded by a day old beard. They were the most beautiful pair of lips in the world, Sherlock thought frantically, and suddenly an idle thought of what stubble burn would feel like crossed his mind.
John.
John grunted, his breath came out hot and heavy as it left his heaving chest. His brows knit together as the fog of his nightmare began to lift. Sherlock was pulling away with all his might when John suddenly released him, causing Sherlock to topple backwards.
"Sherlock, no." John suddenly hauled him back by his shoulders, a wet popping sound made when Sherlock pulled off. "You don't have to do this."
But what was making it infinitely worse, was how close he was to coming. "John...stop, or I'll come. I want to come inside you.
In turn Sherlock let his hands roam across the wide planes of John's back and shoulders, squeezing the robust muscles, next tugging up the man's t-shirt to wander over his chest. John groaned thickly. Encouraged Sherlock found a nipple and gave it a gentle pinch. "Fuck," John sighed deeply. "I'm in love with you," he suddenly added.
In that brief moment John lost control and snapped his hips forward. Sherlock fought the instinct to gag hard, but couldn't help from drawing off, choking wetly. He planned on going back but John grabbed him and pulled him up, kissing him deeply, on the lips and then moving to the neck. John licked up Sherlock's neck, and growled, "I want you to fuck me."
"Sorry." John added pitifully, letting his head lower.
"I'm serious Sherlock. How can I make it up to you?" His voice had gone stiff with suppressed emotions.
"I love you so much there aren't words in the English language to properly convey it." He breathed out in a rush of emotion, and clasped John's firm jaw with both hands on either side and before kissing him once more. Not chaste or careful like before. Dominating and exploring John's mouth like he was finally allowed to do. John tasted like morning breath and old whisky and John. Intoxicating.
