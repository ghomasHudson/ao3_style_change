He stands up, tip toeing around the bed, picking his scattered clothing up, and throwing one last guilty look at the man,- Max? Matt? something like that; and shuts the door behind him quietly - at least sparring him the jarring corridor light, If not having to clean as soon as he woke up.
The armour opens and Tony steps out; graceful, if slightly wobbly. Steve is relieved. The world needed at least one of them up and running. He takes his helmet off and turns off the engine, walking forward.
Steve shakes his head. Burdening Tony was fruitless. He'd appreciate a talk: but not about this. Not with Tony who loved Steve with an abandon bordering on obsessed worship. He can't talk to Tony, especially with something like this.
The tree branches rustled against ice-encrusted windows, and Tony shivered. This place was just creepy.
Outside, the air is new-day fresh, the dew clings to the leaves, and a large snail crawls sleepily down the driveway. The sky is grey and dreary,- but that speaks more for the dawn breaking over the horizon rather than rain. Usually, Steve would have stopped. He would have stopped and wished for an easel and some paint. He'd have stopped to greet the early morning patrons.
" The moan slid willingly past his lips and he felt the hand around his cock slow to milk it gently.
"The report said you ingested 14 zoloft and 40 paxil, Tony. You must have been planning this for some time."
His light-hearted tone seemed to shatter the atmosphere like ice, and Clint surged forwards to give his boyfriend a hand, while Tony choose to sidle up to Steve on the sofa. He was busy fiddling the TV remote, his lap full of Xbox controllers, their lights glowing luminous blue, green and white.
"Your mom seems real nice." Steve had dropped his voice to a quiet murmur, despite the fact they were far away across the kitchen enough that Maria wouldn't be able to hear them.
Feather-light fingertips ghosted over his bicep and Tony jumped; Steve was at his side, an amused half-smile tweaking the corners of his mouth. "You alright?"
Steve's other hand, which had been holding his drink, freed itself and snaked around Tony's middle and squeezed him gently, before retreating a little to rub soothingly up and down his upper arm.
"You sure? What about your father?" Steve was assessing him from under furrowed brows, equal measures of suspicion and confusion masking his expression.
"Fuck." His voice was nothing more than a rasping croak, as if roughed with weeks of disuse, instead of the unshed tears stinging his eyes and burning in the back of his throat.
The blonde pressed a kiss against Tony's temple. "Well, he seems like he's doing okay now." He bumped their shoulders together and Tony turned his head to see the other two boys fighting playfully over the cans of energy drink that had been residing in the minibar fridge. James was attempting to wrestle them off Clint, while laughing breathlessly, as the other fruitlessly wriggled in his grip. Tony rolled his eyes but laughed.
The sudden sharp screech of chair legs on linoleum sent his head jerking up painfully. The greasy blonde guy had shoved his chair back violently and was stalking out of the room, shoulders hunched and fists clenched.
"Not yet, but I think he might soon." Steve pinched the bridge of his nose and exhaled slowly. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make this about James. "
Heavy-footed steps echoed down the polished hall and Tony flinched upright in his seat, his thundering pulse soaring as the oxygen to his lungs suddenly seemed to restrict. As Howard Stark entered the room, the first thing Tony noticed was the expression of unfiltered annoyance that was set bone-deep into his already exhaustion-lined features. Any resemblance of confidence drained from the teenager's entire being, his shoulders hunching up to his jaw as anxiety flooded his veins, so strong he could taste its bitter slick coating his mouth like bile.
Tony could do nothing more than nod in response - arguing would be pointless and ultimately lead nowhere. "Okay. Thank you."
For several moments, the only noise in the limited space of the car was the duet of their post-orgasmic panting, the heavy scent of sex sitting low in their senses.
As he pried his sweat-slicked palms away from his face, he was relieved to see that, at least, she wasn't gloating at him or smirking one of those little I-told-you-so smirks. Instead, that unopinionated soothing look was back, gentle and radiating ease.
"I think you should eat something." Maria turned away from him and busied herself clicking open cabinets and restlessly shuffling spare cutlery about on the marble.
them to keep picking on you?" He straightened up again and rubbed his temples with the callous-threaded tips of his fingers. "
Eventually, they settled in front of the TV with Steve and Tony on the sofa, the dark haired boy's back pressed up against his boyfriend's chest as he sat snuggly between his spread thighs. On the floor, James and Clint had taken over one of the immense bean bags, with James sitting upright and Clint draped messily across his lap, like a weird fleshy blanket. Halo Multiplayer mode flickered across the television screen in bright colours and intense gunfire; their remotes clicked and vibrated aggressively under their rapid thumbs. It didn't take long for their competitive nature to make itself well-known, as Tony and James stalked each other across the maps, shooting each other mercilessly, regardless of their respective teams.
"Right. Well, I've got a lot to do and my work obviously has to come first. Maybe if I have a spare moment, I'll come by and your- your-" Howard Stark opened and closed his mouth like a fish out of water for a moment, words choking him to silence. "Your
Steve sighed again, but softly this time, more like a gentle exhale than one of exasperation. "Tony, I'm not going to let you walk to the damn Youth Centre and back, okay? That's at least forty minutes that I could do easily in ten or fifteen. It's only once a week and it's really not that big of a deal." He stopped and wet his lips uncomfortably before speaking again. "Also, I think James might end up going there, at some point."
Stark looked at Steve, blue eyes glinting in some distant memory, “We never talked about it after,” he whispered half to himself. “Not really. We fought about it a whole lot, but never… we never really talked about
This time Steve didn’t even bother taking off his pajamas. When Tony inevitably squealed like he had that
Steve opened the visor staring at him, half understanding - mostly disappointed. Tony distantly wondered if he should apologize, perhaps make a glaring declaration of love. It seemed too tame, too petty; not after where they’d been, not after what they’d done. He kissed Steve instead, and Steve kissed him back.
Tony ignored Steve’s sulking completely. Over the years, he had definitely built up some kind of immunity to it. He closed his eyes as some shampoo commercial rolled on the ancient television. He’d just have a bit of a shut-eye, and worry about his diminishing relationship with Steve when he wasn’t quite so cold and floating in gallons of hot chocolate.
Maybe putting on a show for a friend would have been more embarrassing, but Thor had known Tony since he was twenty-one years old, and clothes had always had the bad habit of disappearing in Tony's general vicinity. Shame was a distant utopia. He skirts his hand up his throat, let the other reach back and sink into his hair, grabbing a fist full, pulling it back - exposing his all too vulnerable-
But he’s staring at the hotel clerk wildly, having no idea how much to pay them. The meager dollar bills Tony has left are complicated and difficult to understand. He shrugs and gives them half of what he has.
Steve gets up to fetch bandages and disinfectant. He moves Tony's body as he cleans and bandages the deeper cuts turning him over to get his back, but leaves the purpling bruises alone. Tony doesn't wake up.
: a sham of a faith that they both pretended they still had in each other. Like this, he shamefully wishes Tony were more like Sharon. Sharon who understood the ideals that dominated Steve’s life better than anyone else.
Steve came back, victorious, happy and proud of his team. He glowed and smiled and laughed; passion, heart and full of life.
He leaves the taps be, and the water warms in slow increments, slower than the snail that morning and Steve
Before picking him up and rushing to the hospital, Steve had briefly turned his head heavenward and apologized to God for all his sins.
He hugs Tony back, locking his wrists together over the soft dip of his spine. The constant teeth grinding fear and grief fading to almost silence, he could never have peace (
is all there is in the world. His entire being a rhapsody of music and art. Tony had surrendered even before the ice was broken.
Steve sighs and leaves him be. He had more important things to do than catering to Tony Stark's endless needs.
Tony grins back lazily, unashamed. He won’t admit to how happy it makes him; some kind of abstract satisfaction in watching Thor at his element: how sublime he was, how
Moreover, it had helped Steve make another important decision too. Steve knew he'd have done it all again, a million times over, even with all the pain and grief and loss, If only just for this beautiful amazing ridiculous man, he would one day (hope to) marry.
Tony pulls away when he reaches too hard, a wet strand of drool connecting Steve’s flushed red skin to Tony’s mouth, “Or what I could be,” he hums.
practiced. It was just meditation really. Meditation with beats - a time tested method to come down from a panic attack.
“You are too far,” Steve says, lays a hand enclosing Tony’s cock almost entirely in his own massive palm, “You cannot claim victory if you’re too late to the battle Thor.” Steve grins, and rubs his hand down, squeezing, almost massaging Tony’s cock. Tony moans, pushing his hips frivolously into Steve, almost painfully hard in his hand. Thor grins back, both of them ignoring Tony; predators circling around each other. It’s almost adorable: for how unnecessary it is.
Tony being in a coma, and Steve wishing he’d wake up is a frighteningly normal thing in their lives.
Tony mumbles his name again, face hidden in Steve's throat, tugging at the zipper of his stupid old biker jacket.
Tony opens his mouth, but Thor gets his words in: “Join us, Captain. The water is warm,” he flicked his head toward the water, before turning around to look at Tony, “The company,-
Finally, Stark seemed to win some kind of personal battle. He upended the chair and moved to stand by the window, looking at the wide stretch of nothing around them. There was no view, Steve already knew that, just barren lands stretching on as far as he could see. Steve didn’t bother putting his chair back up straight. It was a hot, summer afternoon, and Steve couldn’t muster up the required energy it would take to nudge it up with his foot.
Besides, Steve had a sure enough grip on Tony’s body to break it in two whenever the need struck, or rage called for it. Tony’s entire being, by now, is long accustomed to crushing beneath the weight of Steve’s shield; This feels inanely trivial.
Tony smiles, pulls his hands off his body, slides into Thor’s lose grasp, “On the contrary, Thor, - I always need to ask.” Thor smiles at him, an achingly fond look in his eyes, “Have we not gotten past this?” he murmurs into Tony’s lips. “This- this banal need to ask each other what we think? Do we not know each other better?” Tony lays his head over Thor’s chest, “We do” he agrees, “But times like these, people like us,-” Thor’s arms tighten over Tony’s body. It may have been years, but fights amongst lovers always tended to leave its mark. “We do not need to remember weaker times,” he says.
on the sheets, completely gone. He pulls away when she cums, moaning wantonly, her body rising of the bed and nearly bending in half.
“Neither of you is aware, on what you want, or what you need.” he shrugs, carelessly, “ you do not even know
with the effort of not just grabbing Tony and having him again. It shoots sharp tingles of pleasure up his spine, his legs spread open accommodating and ready in response.
Realistically, Steve knows it's stupid. In a few months time, one of them would probably get mind controlled. Or the world would end and Steve and Tony would have a huge fight that left Steve's fists aching to punch someone, and Tony brain-tired with guilt, and mouth twisted in the apologies he tried not to mean, because Tony would
Tony stumbled forward, ignoring the monologue, the world was ending; everything was dying; and Tony should have really kissed Steve before he left. He placed his hand on the warm alive metal of Steve’s chest plate, a hand over his heart.  Steve had always thrummed with life, warmth, compassion, even while wearing what was debatably the world's greatest killing machine.
Instead of answering, his mom took a generous swallow from her three-quarters-full wine glass and drifted her gaze over to their butler Jarvis.
Eventually, Steve had returned with two grease-spotted brown paper bags clutched in one hand and two bottles of coke in the other. Dumping the feverishly hot packages onto Tony's lap, Steve had left the parking lot heading away from the city. Living in the suburbs meant it hadn't taken too long to reach a hiking area, where they'd pulled off down the side of a service road and parked with the bonnet of the car pointing into the dense treeline of a small forest.
Without a moment's hesitation, Tony's hands fell to the other boy's jeans and popped the buttons from their holes, attempting to wrestle them impatiently down the hips of their wearer. Steve laughed.
Tony blinked in surprise and looked at his boyfriend incredulously. "You what? Since when have you met her?!"
"Oh." Tony fumbled for the right words, "I've invited Steve - my boyfriend - over for dinner this evening and I was wondering if you would join us and mom." He stumbled over himself slightly in the middle but refused to let himself be ashamed of admitting having a same-sex partner to his dad.
Tony nodded and turned back to his fries, dipping them in one of the little individual portion ketchup packets that had come from the diner.
. But now, hearing the musical laughter of himself, his boyfriend and his mom, it was hard to imagine the heaviness of the house had ever existed at all.
"I feel guilty for hurting my mom. She already goes through enough on a daily basis from dealing with my dad. She didn't deserve to have more shit from me, piled on top of that. She keeps getting all teary when she sees me, and checking in on me all the time, like it's her responsibility to make sure I'm okay all the time, and like if she doesn't check, I'll feel shit again and it'll be her fault."
It wasn't like Tony didn't have his own car, but since the whole suicide attempt thing, his parents had been somewhat reluctant to let him go driving on his own. It wasn't like he didn't understand their reasoning, but that didn't make it any less annoying and inconvenient.
Tony nodded slowly; he could feel the eyes of his friends burning into him, expectantly. "Uhm, thanks." Refusing to let his father's contagious discomfort infect him, he added "this is Steve, James and Clint, by the way." He gestured to them in turn and in his peripheral vision, he saw Steve flash his father one of his winning golden smiles.
The brown-haired teen sighed. "Yep. Dad hates the whole idea of it - the support group, I mean. Says he doesn't want anyone outside of the house knowing I'm fucked up, because it'll bring shame on the family name, or something like that. So basically, he doesn't want my issues creating bad shit for him." After a moment, he added, "he'd refusing to let Jarvis drive me to the Youth Centre, but also won't let me drive my car, still."
The girl's smile seemed to stretch her already contorted skin even tighter over the sharp points of her facial bones. "Hi, I'm Jane. I'm here because I have anorexia nervosa." She turned her head and looked at the guy to her left. Tony let himself slump down a little in his seat, quietly wishing he'd gotten more sleep the night before. He squeezed his fingertips into his numbly throbbing temples and exhaled softly.
Tony pulled his mouth away for a moment, working up a steady rhythm with the thrust of his hips, as Steve groaned under him.
"Yeah," Tony replied, "just wondering how two such different people can have so much to talk about." From where she was pulling plates out of the cupboard, Maria laughed.
. I refuse to believe that." His almost inability to keep the smile off his face felt oddly foreign but genuine. "You two ladies want another cocktail?"
Tony swallowed with an audible click. "My mom. She wasn't meant to-" He cut himself off and shook his head slowly. "I don't know who was meant to, really. But it definitely wasn't her." He flexed his fingers carefully and watched the circulation flood pink warmth through the tight white skin. "She found me out on the balcony, half with it, all slobbery and slurred, pissed outta my mind. I don't know who called the ambulance, but it wasn't her. Jarvis ended up being the one who made me vomit; she was in too much shock and dad- dad was-" the words caught in his throat and choked him off.
Quick measured footsteps down the hall beside the dinning room yanked Tony sharply out of the moment.
Leaning by the stage, Tony shut his eyes, quietly counting backwards from 100. The tick-tick of the kitchen clock jarringly loud in the quiet room.
He looks back up. Thor looks satisfied with himself, and Tony has competitiveness issues a mile too wide. He has a score to settle.
Steve looked down and rubbed his nape. “You were screaming my name,” he muttered quietly. Tony flushed and shook his head. He had done a lot more embarrassing things in his life than calling out Steve’s name in his sleep.
She looks startled at Steve's sudden eagerness, and pulls her clothes on in rapid motions, quick and jerky, like she was in a hurry, or scared. Steve stops to pick her stilettos by the door, and offers it to her. She takes it and sends him an unsure smile. Steve smiles back at her weakly. Her face softens from the confusion to mild concern. She looks at him assessing, and then her eyes widen. She nods jerkily, and scampers out of the room.
Thor roves his eyes over Tony’s body: a satisfaction: the conquering victor. “You needn’t ask Dear Friend,” he says, his voice thrums, deep and resounding.
He opened the door, and walked in throwing his luggage in one of the spacious rooms. He leaned by the large window, the cool sea breeze messing his hair up. He feels rather than sees Steve slide in next to him, he leans his head down on his elbows and Tony gently pats his hair. Steve takes his hand and tugs it close, placing a kiss on his knuckles.
Thor stares right through Tony, eyes boring holes into his skull, “Why do we need Enlightenment?” a jerk of the head, “you and I?”
Tony felt hot tears soak his beard as he ran the torch over Steve’s torso, trying to find the source of the blood. There was a sharp jagged wound right over his heart, and Tony took another terrified breath, placing the phone on the ground. He desperately cupped Steve’s face, lying limp and still in his arms.
“I didn’t always,” Tony agrees, easily enough. There is an undercurrent of guilt in his tone, but no regrets. Steve wants to hate him for that. He tightens the arm-thrown over Tony’s waist instead, slides his palm down the slope of Tony’s back, skirting the inside of Tony’s sweaty thighs. It's almost whimsical, an opportunity to hold Tony in his arms again. More for the fact that he won't get to do it for long. He lets his nails catch at the parts where he knows Tony is most sensitive, up to spread his cheeks open to the dark air, and slide a digit in where Tony is swollen and dribbling over Steve’s fingers. He scoops some out. Plays his obscenely large fingers over Tony’s readily available body, rubbing his spend into Tony’s skin.
Steve’s other hand slides behind his body, opening him up where he is still swollen and red, sliding a finger in with remarkable ease. “Seems you even finished without me,” he says, fingers wet with Thor’s spend inside Tony.
Honestly! That was just, so,-typical really. It kept in line with how everything else in his life was going on; and the food,-the food seems to gotten just about everywhere. From the bed to the carpet, to even the
Steve is a level of beauty Tony has never been able to successfully quantify, or even comprehend. So he lays there, ogling at him unashamedly, let’s his eyes slide over the mighty shoulders, the dip of his spine, the curve of his ass, the crease in between - like it was nothing but a great tantalising secret - a secret he longed to explore - to open it up, and play his tongue over, feel Steve wiggle and gasp beneath his tongue - easily conquered, glad to surrender.
Steve thinks there was once a happier time when he and Tony could speak their minds and not cover in fear of the other’s thoughts.
Every charlatan has a charade, and every charade comes to an end. Tony Stark knew this better than most, he’d been there and lived through it.
“One cannot forget a concept so easy.” Tony smirks, shrugging away past grievances, “I’d lay fault with you both if you did.”
He admits defeat before re-routing to the nearest roadway motel. It's slightly better than the usual accommodations Steve favoured, but Steve doesn't want to risk riding his bike until he finds a cheaper place.
Jessica had been dragged kicking and screaming through hell when it'd been discovered that her counterpart was a skrull.
As he continued, Stark choked out, “I got you killed, Steve. I got you killed and then, and then I got you back… I’d always thought, Well it can’t get worse than that, can it ? and we survived.”
Thor smiles, pushing Tony out of his arms and into Steve’s. “You mistake me,” he says, ever so patient, “The honour of singing your glories is a privilege I shall not soon forget.” musing - Thor runs a hand down Steve’s face, “You are,- neither of you, the easily forgotten types.”
Tony laughs, looks down, pretentiously coy, “Oh! You know” he flutters his fingers through the air. “Enlightenment.”
However, everyone seems all too eager to absolve Steve of all of his sins. Steve wishes someone would just
Tony managed to cup Steve’s face in his hands, running a hand through his hair, checking for bumps. Steve calmly pulled away from his fussing, gently taking Tony’s hands into his own. Tony stared at him blankly as Steve's school-boy smile turned into a menacing shark-like grin, his pale Irish skin darkening into a familiar sick green. The Skrull soldier tilted his head like a bird, as though he was trying to delve into Tony's mind. Tony took a sharp breath. “Where’s Steve?” he demanded, his voice letting out a faint squeak in the end. The Skrull just shook his head, a look of fake sadness in his face. He tightened his grip on Tony’s hands and squeezed. Tony immediately fell to his knees with a scream, as the soldier's claws practically shattered the bones in his hand, but the Skrull clearly had something else in mind. He continued squeezing until Tony had no air left to scream with, until his hands were nothing but bleeding lumps of unrecognizable flesh.
Tony shifted uncomfortably on the ratty couch. When all of this inevitably went wrong, he wanted it filed that this had not been his idea. He wiggled his feet between Steve and the inside of the couch insolently. Steve glared at him. Tony ignored him. Tony hadn’t insisted Steve come to the conclusion that a tactical retreat was needed, nor had he invited him to sit on  a ratty couch and watch lame TV in the middle of nowhere. Though, to be fair, Steve hadn’t either. That was all Thor. Again, when all this inevitably went wrong Tony wanted it on paper that he’d had nothing to do with it.
Steve keened over Tony, his ‘hmm’ thrumming into Tony’s own body, the pleasured sound shorting out Tony’s brain. “Steve” he gasped, reaching an arm out to his hair, sinking his fingers into the lovely golden folds; pushing himself down into Steve’s face. Steve whined some more, pulling back, peppering sweet chaste kisses into Tony’s skin, mouth still so very eager like he could not get enough of him. When Tony arches and whimpers, Steve grunts out -
There were so many things he could've said instead. 'He always considered you his home.' 'He trusted you with a ferocity that would surprise you.' 'He was so protective of you, that he could hardly
Stark remained silent and Steve let him stew. Experience had taught him better than to interrupt Tony when he was in one of his melancholic moods, it wouldn’t get him anywhere apart from getting his head ripped off.
Tony had learnt the lovely art of hope. Even Faith seemed an alluring concept - faith in Steve had always come easy. It was a line he skirted, love and adoration for Steve, Steve’s tender skin and Steve’s own self - the messy, judgemental, cruel one, that Tony had grown to love almost as much as the bright sunlight and the rolling hills of everything else Steve.
Tony is explaining something about the armour with elaborate gestures. He grabs Steve's hand and drags him deeper into the lab, still talking a mile a minute. Steve interrupts Tony because
When one lived the life of a superhero; it was an easy enough thing to assume that family was home, and love - the threads of content sewing them together. Easy enough to accept victory as a given; success a team effort for good rather than glory.
Tony woke up slowly. He nuzzled into the soft warm skin beneath him, comfortably warm for the first time all day, and rubbed his eyes. Steve had one arm thrown over Tony’s shoulder, and the other resting softly at his nape. Tony stifled a small smile, gently pushing away from 250 pounds of gorgeous super soldier and slipping his feet into the fluffy red and gold shoes he had insisted on bringing along. Steve had sulked over them all the way to the cottage.
Steve was convulsing into the water, sharp and uncoordinated, hips clenching and pumping, his hands tightening over Tony’s ass, opening him almost painfully wide. Tongue dancing inside his body with focused intent. Whatever was left of Thor long cleaned out. Its Steve’s flesh over Tony’s own. Rubbing into his walls, his lips mouthing wetly where Tony was speared open. The pleasure is almost too much, too overwhelming. Tony wiggled and gasped, his body twisting and digging into the rock in uncomfortable places, wiggled as Steve curled his tongue inside Tony, curled it, opened Tony up with his thumbs, pushing himself in further like he could barely get enough- all the while hips pistoning into Thor’s fist under the water: sweat gleaming in wet drops on his forehead, glinting at the tips of his blond lashes, shoulders bunching with the weight of Tony’s legs, thumbs holding him open: like this was all he’d ever wanted.
trust you,” he whispers. His breath blows hot over Steve’s bare nipple. He says it like it's of any actual consolation, like Tony’s own faith would make up for all that he’s lost. The towering self-assurance of it all makes Steve shift; uncomfortable.
How far could one go to survive? Was murder justifiable if it was done with the proverbial ‘greater good’? Killing a world to save another? Things like these were too massive, too all-consuming for the frailty of the human mind to process. Lies and beliefs helped them believe they were a smaller part of a structural whole. That personal integrity would keep the building together - and it would, to a remarkable extent, Tony would admit to that, at least.
Tony shrugged off his misgivings and walked back to Steve, pulling the blanket over his shoulder and leaning into his warmth.  He pressed the cold tip of his nose into Steve’s neck and Steve snuffled, disgruntled in his sleep. Tony just smirked and settled down, shoving his cold hands in between them for warmth. Tony felt something warm trickle into his hands and he shuffled away, thrusting Steve further back trying to gain some traction. The warmth gushed further, and Tony, all too familiar with the feel of blood in his hands, pushed himself off of Steve with a yell.
They’d laid flat on the bed, Steve holding Tony down, both breathing fast, exchanging harsh kisses, when Tony had abruptly pulled away and declared he couldn’t have sex with Scott Summers’ long-lost twin brother. Steve had stared at Tony blankly, and may or may have not made an ill-thought-out comment on Sam’s more unfortunate wardrobe choices and Tony’s closet inspirations. Tony had rapidly colored a blotchy red and promptly ran to the mirror to confirm Steve’s words.
Now Tony grins. He turns around and waves the armour away. Simultaneously putting both his back to Steve and making his only source of protection leave. Steve aches at it. There is still a part ofTony that trusts in Steve absolutely, in spite of everything.
He raised his hand, fingers trembling violently where they were splayed over his stomach, as the wires went lower, and lower, He stepped back and away from the mirror, rushing to the door.
Tony woke up slowly. He nuzzled into the soft warm skin beneath him, comfortably warm for the first time all day, and rubbed his eyes. Steve had one arm thrown over Tony’s shoulder, and the other resting softly at his nape. Tony stifled a small smile, gently pushing away from 250 pounds of gorgeous super soldier and slipping his feet into the fluffy red and gold shoes he had insisted on bringing along. Steve had sulked over them all the way to the cottage.
Steve sets a palm over his nape, turning his head to rest on Steve’s chest again. He can’t bear to look at Tony sometimes.
Bright blue lights flickered in Tony's lab, rolling translucent figurines of one cherished team-mate after another. Thor with his bright red cape fluttering in a non-existent breeze, Wolverine's claws glinting in the sun. The models of Carol and Jess lay comfortably on the ground, laughing, perfectly happy and content with each other, even as holograms.  They represented everything good about the world. Happiness, strength and hope. At least, Tony knew they would to Steve. The Avengers had always been quintessential to his existence. They gave him drive and purpose. Something to fight for, something to come home to.  He couldn't think of a better distraction.
It shouldn’t have been so surprising. His cock shouldn’t have jumped to attention, hard and leaking over his stomach, flushed and so very ready for Thor’s aesthetic pursuits.
To think of Sharon. Her soft lovely blonde hair, and the way she smiled, the way she’d rest her head against his shoulder, the curve of her waist fitting into Steve’s palm. The way she’d hold his hand in a grip almost as strong as his own.
Civility hardly lasts and soon they’re screaming at each other over the bars, hurling accusations and below the belt blows.
He doesn't  tell Tony that over their rare phone calls. Tony had always felt that he'd had to rip his own heart out to save Steve's.
"Any time you boys are done disgracing that corner of my kitchen, dinner will be ready." Maria's light teasing tone drew Tony back into the moment and he eased himself down off his tiptoes; he was almost glad to see the flaming blush he felt spreading over his cheeks was mirrored across Steve's.
"Because he just couldn't seem to make his disappointment clear quick enough. He didn't stay around with my mom, after she found me, while she was waiting for the ambulance. He didn't ever come visit me in the hospital - not even a fucking
. Sometimes Tony felt out of place in the group - like the rest of the teenagers sitting around the circle were 'sicker' than him in some way. He was like an imposter, pretending to be more fucked up than he was and making use of something he didn't even need. Nauseous anxiety surged through him and he bit into the flesh around his thumb nail, trying not to think about it.
By about the third week, Tony had become accustomed to the routine of the group. Steve dropped him off as usual, his soft-lipped kiss a sure promise of pleasure later. As the dark haired teenager entered the Youth Centre, he noted a few unfamiliar faces already lingering inside the meeting room, most of them sitting on chairs. It was always easier to pick out the newbies like that; their parents dropped them early to talk to Holly the Social Worker and their lack of familiarity with anyone often led them to sitting with rigid anxiety in the uncomfortable plastic chairs organised in a circle in the centre of the room. Those who had been before usually chose to stand and socialise bitterly, plastic cups of watery juice or half-stale biscuits from the refreshments table clasped in their pale fingers.
His mom inhaled sharply, as if she'd just caught herself on the pointed edge of something. Without looking at him, she said "we are very lucky to have your father supporting our family like this. A lot of families are not nearly as lucky as us. Your father loves us dearly."
"Well?" His father was resting his fingertips together in front of him. "Jarvis said you had something to share, Anthony. Better get on with it."
"Well, sometimes you're not ready to leave when I get here and I don't know if you've noticed, Tony Stark, but you do have the tendency to take record-breakingly-long showers-"
Maria's face crumpled into an expression of regret, tactfully ignoring Tony's swearing. "I know. I'm sorry on his behalf, and I know that doesn't excuse his behaviour at all, but you and I both know how he is when it comes to apologies." Her face contorted then, and her eyes hardened, the dark pencilled brows drawing in low over them. "I plan on having a good discussion with him about this later." Taking a swallow from her drink, the muscles in her expression relaxed and she gestured toward the door with her drink hand. "Why don't you two go out and cool off a bit; take a walk; I'll clean up the kitchen."
Clint stayed oddly silent throughout the conversation and remained the same as they climbed the stairs and unloaded into the games room on the second floor. The room was lengthy and comfortable, with deep blue walls and a polished wooden floor, covered in places with soft grey rugs. There was a minibar-style setup in one corner of the room, which was regularly restocked with snacks, soft drinks and alcohol. Off to one side of the room was a large flatscreen TV, fixed to the wall and wired-up to numerous gaming consoles, opposite a wide plushy leather sofa, scattered with comfortably squishy cushions and boxed in by bean bags. The centre of the room was taken up by a vivid green pool table and an oak card table, squatted next to floor to ceiling bookshelf, stuffed achingly full with books and all manner of board games.
"I mean, of course, me growin' up in poverty and you like this has an impact, on that." Tony knew the other boy's unbothered tone was hiding the harboured feelings of imposition that boiled beneath the surface, but decided not to comment on it; Clint was all about keeping up appearances.
The blonde picked up his stroke rhythm slightly and Tony felt his back arch as his vision whited and ropes of sticky heat smeared across his stomach.
"D'you have any condoms in here?" Tony spoke between pants of pleasure as he picked his thrust rhythm back up again. Even though he knew they were both clean, condoms would at least mean he wouldn't have to go back inside to clean up; lube was less of an issue, as, though it wasn't the most comfortable thing in the world, saliva could make-do.
The first time had been the day Tony had come home from the hospital; his dad had co-incidentally been stalking, stony-faced, out of his mahogany-doored office as Tony had been stood in the front all of their oversized house, peeling off his coat and handing it to Jarvis.
if you're not hungry, Tony. You look tired and like you haven't been eating enough. I feel like I haven't seen you properly in- in
Tony refused to be embarrassed about the sheer size of the Stark mansion as he thumbed passcode into the keypad set into the expansive stone wall beside the front door (he could have just knocked and Jarvis would have answered the door, but that had just seemed a little much, really). The cutting remarks from James and Clint had been mercifully light and low in numbers; he wasn't sure if they were deliberately holding back, but to be honest, he didn't really care to know. Finally, the keypad beeped cheerily at him and the celebratory green light flashed as a soft low-pitched
Tony did not know. All he knew were the bruise dark circles, permanently etched into the sallowed skin beneath the hungry caves of his eye sockets.
Too tired to make forced small-talk with anyone, Tony sat down heavily on a chair, across the circle from a guy who couldn't seem to sit still. His blonde hair was a spiked greasy mess and his fingers jittered against his forearms in tandem with his shaking knees; it was hard to tell if he was having withdrawal, high on caffeine or generally anxious. Studying him casually, Tony figured he wouldn't be too surprised if it was actually a mix of all three.
"Taxi?" Tony teased as he got in, throwing his bag into the backseat. Leaning over, he kissed the well-muscled blonde in the driver's seat, both out of affection and to ground himself before he began to bump against the roof of the car like a half-soft helium balloon.
The quietness of usually one of the most boisterous members of the group (after Tony himself), was beginning to unnerve the dark haired teen.
They stood silently for several long moments, until James clambered out from behind the minibar, his hands clutching desperately at an armful of snack packets. "Not to interrupt or anything, but if you're done having your moment, would you mind giving me a hand?"
"Yeah, I think so." He frowned, suddenly a little unsure - the guy hadn't been verging on anything serious, but then again... "At least, he's not not okay, I don't think."
For several long moments, there was silence. Tony could easily read through his fathers words, through the uncomfortable insecurity, to understand Howard Stark had been encouraging him to have his friends over more often, because maybe, just maybe, he wanted to get to know them better.
"Yep. It's been only Jarvis for a few years though, now. We had a live-in cook and maid when I was a kid, but Mom let them go during freshman year because she wanted things to do around the house. Now there's just a maid who visits, like, once or twice a week, I think."
resided from the door. Pushing it open, he gestured grandly to the other three teenagers for them to enter.
Then he turned and looked over his shoulder at them. "You know, the television in the living room is pretty damn good for watching films on - the surround sound system is all plugged in now." Letting go of the wooden frame, he exited fully, shutting the door behind him gently.
She regarded this answer, nodding slowly, as if she felt he did know, but just wasn't ready to discuss it yet. Maybe he wasn't. But then again, maybe he just didn't
of standing by and watching you get knocked down by him again and again. Yes, he's your father, but there's got to be a point where it isn't worth it anymore. Let him come to you instead, okay?"
Nauseating guilt welled in his stomach and Tony struggled to swallow back the sour bile that rose up inside. "I don't want it to reflect bad on Dad."
it about him. It's just how the conversation happened to go." He hesitated. "I know him and I may not always see eye-to-eye but he's not a complete pain in the ass."
Steve looked back at him with saliva moistened lips and dilated pupils. "No need to apologise. I was liking where that was going."
be upset you reached the point where suicide seemed like the only option, but he will also want to help and support you."
The therapist sitting in the chair across from him in the comfortably cluttered Mental Health centre office was watching him with a soothing gaze. When he started seeing her weekly after his attempt, he'd been very glad to find she wasn't one of the pushy pity-ers, who make you talk about your shit before you're ready, all the while staring at you with wide wet eyes, like a whining puppy.
A boy sitting a few seats to the right of where Clint had been seated cleared his throat discreetly. "Uh, I'm Bruce. I'm here because I have severe anxiety and intermittent explosive disorder. I lost control and nearly killed someone."
"I'll be nice and let you think you're the dominant one, shall I?" The blonde teased, his voice hoarse with arousal.
"It's better for both of us that way!" Tony burst out, his forehead creasing with an exasperated frown. "He doesn't get hurt and won't have to worry about me all the time, like mom is. And I don't have to feel guilty about it."
The door swung forth and Howard Stark stepped cautiously through the frame, his usual confidence seemingly lacking. Tony's eyes widened in pure and untamed surprise - there was no way he could cover that one up.
Suddenly Tony sat back, his chest rising and falling on the edge of panting. "I'm sorry, I just can't stand any more emotional shit this evening."
Weighty silence lingered lengthy and and stifling over the room before Tony relented and nodded. "Okay, yeah."
"What about your dad?" The therapist's tone was deliberately measured and even: cautious but not fearful.
Looking back on it, it was almost amusing how he hadn't noticed as his hours of sleep had trickled off. At one point, he'd regularly been getting ten hours, but then, somehow, it'd become two. God forbid you ask him what he did in those extra eight hours, 'cause
"Is that why you wanted to get out?" Steve's brow had puckered into a stern frown, though, he didn't look surprised.
As Maria turned to the stove to begin mixing a pot of cooked and drained pasta into another of thick creamy sauce, Tony turned to look at Steve expectantly. "And you?"
It had been a little while since they'd parked the only noise had been the rustling of takeaway bags and muffled crunching of burgers and crispy skin-on fries.
shut softly behind him, Tony approached the large glossy mahogany desk that squatted in the centre of the office, surrounded by award and book littered shelves of the same rich wood. Howard Stark was sat dressed in a deep royal blue suit behind his desk, ink fountain pen in his hand, pouring over sheaves of documents and elegantly swirling out his curled signature at the bottom of each one. Somehow, Tony had failed to inherit legible handwriting from either of his parents; though, he supposed, he'd only ever really seen his father's signature and supposedly, the more intelligent you are the messier your handwriting, so there was still hope.
"No, thanks, it's fine. I'm sure he's too busy at the moment anyway." Despite the fact he knew that Jarvis was well aware of the conflict that often smouldered within the confines of the house between Howard and his son, and then also his wife, Tony often avoided speaking too ill of his father around the butler. In all honesty, he wasn't too sure why; maybe it was because he didn't want to insult the man who served his father so closely. Or perhaps simply because it seemed
"Good. The last thing I need is you making more of a fool of yourself than you previously have. You're already a disappointment to the Stark family name; don't make it any worse." Then he turned swiftly on his heel and strode off down the hallway into the depths of the house, his hands clasped behind his back.
Tony felt the stiffness in his shoulders release as swiftly as it had arrived. Pure and unrelenting exhaustion swept over him, filling the space left by the tension and suddenly all he wanted to do was cling to his mom and cry into her sweater like he hadn't done since he was barely past her hip. Relenting to the bone-deep ache, he slumped into one of the cushy leather-covered barstools tucked under the island. As he rested his forehead against the soothing cold marble top, worn fingers carded with motherly affection through the tangled locks of his hair (when was the last time he'd washed that?).
Rolling off his boyfriend's lap for a moment, Tony undid his own jeans and wriggled them off his legs as best he could, leaving them in an untidy heap, inside out, in the footwell of the backseat with his shoes. As soon as Steve's bare thighs were exposed, he took his seat back up again, his cock already aching almost painfully. Lurching forward, he thrust their boxer-clad crotches together again and moaned as the euphoria laced his veins.
At school, all the kids would clamour endlessly about the latest bit of tech from Stark industries. Their juice-sticky hands would tug over and over at his shirt sleeves, demanding to know about the new StarkPhone and what it was like to live to be the son of an inventor such as he.
. I'm your mother, let me take care of you, okay?" As she spoke, her gaze remained fixed away from him, at the slate-tiled wall behind the eight-slot toaster.
There was a soft but assertive knock at the door, so sudden that Tony - admittedly - jumped a little. A frown creased his brow; his mom wouldn't knock in such a way and anyway, she'd never bothered him whilst he'd been in the games room before. Jarvis tended to announce his arrival before entering a room, meaning it was unlikely to be him either, so-
"He doesn't know." The teenager squeezed his eyes shut and dragged his hand over his face, digging his fingertips into his temples. "I know, I should have told him. But it's not like we're actually
"I'll just pop some toast in, shall I? Not much point cooking anything big up." She said, as if he hadn't spoken at all.
He was only three steps out of the dinning room, when the slam of the front door echoed out through the house. Within an instant, all of the icy power that had been swelling like an abscess suddenly seemed to burst and drain out through his feet into the floor, leaving his limbs like lead and his eyes itchy and burning. Tony refused to acknowledge the tears burning into the shadowed skin beneath his eyes as he stared uselessly at the inside of the front door.
Somehow, 'taking a walk' turned into Tony sitting on Steve's lap in the backseat of his Camaro, his shins pressed into the leather-upholstered seat either side of his boyfriend's heavily muscled thighs, straddling them. His arms were wrapped comfortably around Steve's neck, his chin hooked over his shoulder. Steve's arms looped around him, his hands cupped at Tony's lower back, the side of his face pressed against the top of Tony's head.
His father looked up and nodded politely to teenager stood before him. "Anthony. What can I do for you? Make it quick, I'm up to my elbows, here."
"No. Haven't gotten around to picking any up yet. Sorry." Steve sounded genuinely apologetic, but Tony just shrugged nonchalantly.
He looked up expectantly at the doorway, just in time to see his father striding past without a thought to even glance in at them. An icy jolt of frustration burst through Tony; there was no way his dad wouldn't have heard them. The door was open and the corridor was pretty damn long - long enough that he would have heard the voices for a good several paces before he came upon the door.
"Do you want to go see someone about it?" There was careful concern in her voice, as if she didn't want to upset him or overstep and set him off, like a landmine.
The weighted blanket invaded his nose, his throat, his lungs with every inhale. He was suffocating in a room filled with air.
Howard inclined his head. "Yes, it's nice to meet you all. Hopefully I'll be seeing more of the three of you - it isn't often this house gets visitors." He was looking awkward again and he nodded to himself. "Just call you mother or I if you need anything, Anthony." He turned to leave the room, but paused in the doorframe, one hand wrapped around the jamb, as if having second thoughts.
It's funny how you don't notice the small things changing, how you only realise there's an issue when you trip and suddenly it's like your eyes are fully open for the first time and everything is different.
The blonde was quiet for a moment, deep in thought. "I agree with your therapist - I think it would be a good idea, too. Yes, perhaps not the most enjoyable way to spend your time, but maybe it'll help give you a different perspective of your depression."
hurting him Tony: you're hurting both of you. Steve will inevitably find out at some point and will be more hurt to find out you lied to him, than if you just told him sooner. You're also hurting yourself by keeping it from him because you will always feel that guilt of having kept something so serious and significant from someone you really care about." She paused and took a deep breath. "The truth is almost always better and this is one of those times. I know you find it difficult to comprehend it, but Steve cares about you, truly, and yes he
But now, standing outside his dad's office, twisting his fingers together, he wondered if he'd been right to trust his friends and his mom's judgement. It had been a good few minutes since his original knock and now he was contemplating whether knocking again would be a good idea or a death sentence. On one hand, his dad might not have heard the first knock, but then again, he may just have been finishing up something and a second knock would sour the mood greatly, ruining his chances.
Howard Stark was yet to make an appearance, but Tony figured the night was still young and there was plenty of time for his dad to come striding in, all arrogance and permanently-furrowed eyebrows. Even though he knew his dad's judgement and approval wasn't everything, part of him was desperate for Howard to meet Steve, because Steve was basically everything Tony wasn't. And everything Tony wasn't, was exactly what his father had wanted in a son.
window: upstairs would be easier to access without being seen, but climbing down from the third or even second floor would be questionable. However, going out a window on the first floor would risk being seen, and at that point he may as well use the front door.
His mom smiled gently at him, her eyes finally allowing the warmth of it to seep into them. "I'll ring the doctor's practise when you've gone to school, okay?" She glanced over her shoulder. "I think your toast may have gone cold, though."
Sometimes, Tony wished he'd been born into a family like Steve's and not rigid upper class environment of his own.
The blonde looked at him with cautious but calm eyes; he didn't look like he was on the edge of a freak-out, or about to flip out, which calmed Tony's flighty nerves at least a little.
"Tony-" Maria's voice fell futilely against his deaf ears. In a blink he was half out into the hall, his legs working faster than his mind. He didn't know what he would say if he caught up to his father, but he was sure the right words would come when they needed to. The wet anger bubbling up into his throat was assuring him of that.
His dad just nodded and gestured at him dismissively, his attention already back on his paperwork. Leaving the room, Tony found he didn't feel entirely disappointed; maybe it was the fact his father had openly acknowledge his son was truly not just in a 'phase' and had actually used the word 'boyfriend'. Admittedly, it was frustrating he likely wouldn't be there for dinner, but maybe that wasn't such a bad thing.
Gently, he teased his hand up and down Steve's cock, steadily picking up speed until he could feel the blonde's muscles tensing beneath him. Steve moaned breathily against his ear, kissing him sloppily and fervently, his eyes screwed closed and his mouth hanging half open; a face of pure fucking pleasure. As he approached the edge of orgasm, Tony slowed the rate of his jerks and Steve blinked open his eyes to frown at him. The dark haired teen knew his boyfriend wasn't truly annoyed at him, despite the edging.
Tony shrugged nonchalantly and took another bite from his bacon and cheese filled bun. "I mean, if that's what she thinks is best, then I'm all go. Yeah, the idea of listening to other teenagers whine about their equally shitty problems sounds like a bore, but then again, I'm not the professional." He glanced up and made eye-contact with Steve. "What do you think about it?"
"Your mother has informed me you are to see a therapist, which I have reluctantly agreed to only on the basis that it may quieten her woes. I do not expect to see your grades slip any lower than they already have, nor hear that you have been using this stunt as any kind of excuse for laziness, do you hear me?" His stern tone retained a commanding quality that ricocheted around inside Tony's skull like a ping pong ball.
Against his better judgement, Tony stood suddenly, knocking his chair back to swing wildly on its two back legs; the frustration had spiked horribly into something he didn't quite want to think about. Something as bitter as bile and slick like a coiling snake in his stomach, ready to strike.
His mom had met James and Clint once before when Steve had dropped him off after they'd spent an afternoon hanging out and faffing about at a local park. Tony figured she'd been too overjoyed by the fact he actually had friends and let her meet them, to be too bothered by James' cryptically dark aura or Clint's urban dialect and awful potty mouth. To be fair to the guy, it was what he had grown up with; not that Tony had much of an insight into Clint's childhood, but from what him, Steve and James had hinted at, it had been filled with abuse of all flavours, shitty parents and foster homes.
" His voice turned desperate as he hit the edge of his orgasm, his cock twitching violently in Tony's hand and splattering cum across the two of them and down his fingers.
Tony sighed tiredly. "I know, I know, I should have learnt by now. I should be used to his incompetence and unreliability." Tony tipped his head back against Steve's arm, which was extended along the back of the sofa behind him. "I just hoped that once,
The rest of the evening felt misaligned and disjointed, like he was stuck on delay. Maria's mouth seemed permanently twisted into a pained pucker, as if her cocktail had been replaced with lemon juice.
"Clint..." Holly called after the guy half-heartedly; she spoke as if this had occurred before and for a moment Tony wondered if the guy wasn't actually new after all. That he just hadn't been present the two previous weeks Tony had gone and this was his first week back in a while. Though, it quite obviously wasn't going too well.
"My mom won't be home until late. We can crash at mine." Tony's voice broke through the still air of the car, leaving thickening silence in its wake; he had always avoided bringing the group back to the Stark mansion, for fear of something happening, or his dad appearing and making a fuss.
Tony rolled his eyes. "Don't be so humble, Steve." He turned to his mom. "What he means is yes, and a damn good one."
At that, he sat back on his heels and pulled the waistband of Steve's boxers down, tucking the hem of his shirt out the way. The inside of his underwear and the head of his swollen cock were sticky with pre-cum and Tony's cock twitched at the sight. Spitting into the palm of his hand, he grasped the shaft of his boyfriend's prick and slowly stroked upward, revelling as the boy under him moaned throatily in response.
Steve laughed softly. "Thanks. I know how highly you think of her, so her approval really means a lot to me." Before he could think twice about it, Tony stretched up and pressed a kiss against Steve's warmth-flushed lips. The accompanying affection that swelled in his chest was comfortable in a way that would have once frightened Tony and made him want to push his boyfriend away, but now it felt empowering.
Leaning back against one of the marble countertops in the kitchen, the skin of his elbows pressed against the refreshingly cool surface. A now slightly-warmed glass of whiskey and coke sat comfortably in his grasp, the ice just beginning to shrink, but not enough to water back the bite of the alcohol too much. At the island, Maria was stood, folding dressing through an overly-green salad, though her eyes weren't focused on the bowl in front of her. Instead, the resided in contact with Steve, who was talking animatedly to her in the way that only Steve seemed capable of; he was one of those people who was just so naturally charismatic that they could just go up to anyone and find something to talk about. In moments like this, Tony found himself wondering how someone as fucked up as him, had manage to win over someone as golden as Steve.
Warmth unfurled in his chest, like a blooming flower bud, extending its tendrils out into his stomach and creeping down his limbs to his lightly trembling fingers. A part of him hated how one person had so much control over him, but another part of him loved it - loved the burning affection and the feel of sculpted muscles under endless expanses of tanned skin; the tang of sweat and sweetened coffee against his lips and the aching pleasure of hormonal bodies rocking together in fluid motion. The fear of vulnerability had scalded his heart, but the fervour of love was nurturing.
A pleasant atmosphere hung about the room as they talked and ate, like the factory smell in a new car: refreshing. Far too often, the Stark mansion seemed cloaked in a suffocating and heady air that seemed to soak into your every being. It was suffocating at best and frequently drove Tony to anywhere outside of the place. There had been times before, at night, staring up at the ceiling in an insomniac daze, breathing in that clotted silence had felt like having his face smothered in a wet blanket. After a while he usually gave up and would scale down from his window to walk the streetlamp-yellow washed streets, earphones in, just so he could
Sitting on the concrete curb outside the house, it didn't take long for Steve's Chevrolet Camaro '69 rumble down the street and pull up smoothly beside him.
. Sometimes, Tony wondered if anyone truly knew what was going on inside his father's high-walled mind.
The impatience in his mom's voice made him falter; she'd been more and more short-tempered as of late and the last thing he wanted to do was give her a reason to spend equally as little time with him as his father did.
To be fair, when he looked back on his childhood, Tony considered it a happy one. Images of picnics out in the (at the time) small, neatly trimmed garden with his mom, perched delicately on the blanket, leaning back on her palms, a syrup-sweet smile on her face. His father would wander out of the cramped workshop, his suspenders hanging loosely about his narrow hips like withered vines and wiping his grease-ingrained hands on a rag. He would slip his top few buttons free, airing the sweat-slicked skin of his chest, before easing himself with youthful grace onto the blanket beside his mother. They would sit and sip something sour and bubbly while he roared about the grass, pretending to be some car or plane.
Steve is in the road again when he hears the high pitched whine of the repulsors above him. He jerks to a stop immediately. Not sure if it was Tony or something else, Tony had his armor taken over more than once, and apparently Dr. Doom had run around as Iron Man for a bit. His eyes burn with the thought
“Thor” Tony gasps. He raises to the balls of his feet, but Thor was too massive, too insurmountable - his strength so vast, Tony feels like a squirming elk between them. A pup, a plaything, a toy: so absolutely owned - wagging his tail for the master who’d dared to tame him. “Thor” he moans again, as Thor rests a thumb over his tip, rolling over the skin. He wouldn’t let his hand stray anywhere else. He had no need to, Thor’s hand something far too distinct to be human - Tony would recognize it anywhere in all the world.
Jarvis cleared his throat softly. "I believe Mister Stark was intending to attend dinner." He paused for a response but when there wasn't one, he followed up with "would you like me go remind him?"
In retaliation, Steve forcefully pulled Tony's boxer's down as far as they would go, allowing his hardened cock to spring free. He opted with just Tony's pre-cum and wrapped his long lean fingers around his cock, picking up a sharp and heady rhythm. Taking this as his cue to do the same, Tony sped up his own strokes and they quickly fell into sync. Steve's other hand was still braced against his back, holding their curled forms together as their kiss-bruised lips locked again. Their heads twisted as their eyes fell half shut arousal drunk. Tongues slid saliva slick over teeth and each other. Their moans were like music to their ears, singing their love and pleasure. The heat in Tony's stomach had roared up his entirety and was beginning to build behind his eyes as his orgasm loomed.
him. Even Tony seems all too eager to forget anything had ever happened. In spite of all that Steve had done to him. Although, he would only talk to Steve over the phone. There was probably something to that, if Steve had the energy to spare, he'd worry.
Steve would introduce Tony to the softer nipple clamps he had gotten much earlier when he forgave him for what they now called ‘The Incident with the Dicks and Bees (The Unmentionable IDB for short)’.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blue-eyed Tony sat across, hands folded over his chest restlessly tapping his fingers on his forearm, giving Steve an extremely familiar defensive look. He seemed to want to say something, but promptly thought the better of it. Clearly the Steves and Tonys didn’t have it easy, in any universe.
need to go” she even sounds apologetic. Steve suddenly feels guilty. She had been nothing but nice and kind to Steve; and Steve hadn't even bothered learning her name! He looks at her, rosy cheeks and white teeth. She's so very
The teenager dug his teeth into his lower lip. He hoped that questions was rhetorical because it was one he really didn't want to have to give an answer to.
Jarvis gave a single nod again. "As you wish, sir. If you need anything, please do not hesitate to ask." He smiled briefly at the group of them, then left in the direction of the dining room and trophy room in the belly of the mansion.
, and those were only the things he was sure weren't usual. God only knows what other shit was going on that wasn't supposed to be. Shit he had continually brushed off because it was fine.
Everyone has blue days sometimes; that's just life. But at what point does it stop being life and start being a problem? That heavy set feeling of cloying numbness seemed to have crept upon him overnight, settling over his entirety like a second skin. Some days were okay, manageable: he could get up, function, pretend the darkness at the corners of his vision wasn't there. Those days were fine. Other days were like being anesthetised and swallowing glass, at once. Agonising numbness. Numb agony. It was all the same. On those days, he could stare up at the ceiling for what felt like mere moments, but in reality hours had passed, yet somehow, the day seemed to ooze by as slow as bitter molasses.
The dark hair teenager sat back on his heels for a moment, then surged forwards to kiss the face in before him. Steve's hands suddenly spread against his lower back, splayed fingers stretching out over his tee shirt clad skin, pulling his body in towards his own.
"I- Yeah, she is." Tony found himself hesitating over nothing. "I'm glad she likes you. Not that I thought she wouldn't but-"
There was something about her tone, something he couldn't quite name, that made him want to tell her everything: the insomnia, the forgetfulness, the low moods and the numb self-hatred that had bled in unabated with them, the constant aches that wracked his muscles, no matter how much or how little he stretched, the disassociated detachment he felt from
Switching off his phone and rolling onto his back to stare up at the ceiling, Tony considered his options, of which he had two: first, going out through the front door of the house. This would involve having to get closer to the yelling and risk being seen by someone, but would ultimately be easier. Second, going out through a window. Technically, the second option could be broken down further to specific
"Mister Stark, I will go and ask if he is otherwise occupied." Jarvis turned fluidly on his heel and strode from the dining room. Squirming in his seat, Tony felt as if he'd shrunk in his seat, back to the time when he was nine and had accidentally broken one of the fancy looking glass statuettes on the sitting room mantle piece. He'd had to wait outside his dad's office for what must have been hours, fidgeting anxiously and chewing on the edges of his nails until they were down to the quick and oozing hot pin-pricks of blood.
"Hey, no, don't start that. You've done nothing wrong, okay?" The blonde rubbed his thumb absently against Tony's lower spine. "I mean that."
"No." A tightening sensation he hadn't even been aware of until that very moment suddenly seemed to release - like a breath he hadn't been aware he was holding. Gone.
She gave him a pointed look. "I'm just expressing my outside perspective. To me, it seems like you're concerned you'll have hurt him by attempting suicide, so instead of being honest, you're choosing to keep it from him."
"True that. My dad's a big fan of using money to both 'make-up for' being shitty and to shutter me away, so I'm less of a disappointment."
"I don't feel guilty because of him, if that's what you mean." He was deliberately skirting around the question and both of them knew it. "I regret it, I guess, but I don't feel guilty."
what you wanted me to hear?" The unrelenting malice in his voice was undeniable, no matter how much Tony told himself it was just his imagination. "Do you
Steve sighed. "Tony, look. I know you're used to doing things independently, but sometimes you've got to let other people help you."
Steve was apparently having the same thought as his hands shifted lower onto the dark haired teen's ass. He pulled Tony up against himself, grinding their crotches together, and even through the double layers of denim jeans and cloth boxers, pleasure shot in rivets up through his nerves like liquid gold. A breathless moan slipped from a pair of lips; in the moment, it was hard to tell who it belonged to. Letting go of his boyfriend's head, Tony braced himself against the car's interior - one hand against the refreshingly cool glass of the window, the other grasping the firm thickness of the leather backseat. Using the two points as leverage, he ground his hips forward and down against the swollen heat that was Steve's cock, pulling his jeans uncomfortably taut.
Steve's expression was as readable as ever - a boy who wore his heart on his sleeve always. The corners of his mouth were rounded with supple amusement, but his eyes retained a hardness that told Tony that his boyfriend could just as easily see straight through him. Suddenly his throat felt like sandpaper, rubbing roughly on itself every time he swallowed.
Maria Stark half-heartedly hid her sigh of irritation. "No. It's fine, Jarvis. Thank you." Tiredly, she put down her wine glass and stared resentfully at the long-cold vegetables on her plate.
Clint nodded slowly. "Had my dad actually been able to hold down a job and not drink everythin' he earned, I'm sure he woulda been the same."
. At this point, I'm probably going to have to walk - which is fine, really. It's not overly far and it might help clear my head and stuff a bit before and after." He shrugged. "Not like I've got much choice, at this point."
That was, at least, until his dad's work started to gain some traction. Until his dad started having less and less time for him, or his mother. Until his father started shutting himself away in his office-come-workshop for hours on end. Until the only time he would really see his dad was in the morning or sitting through a stony-silent dinner.
After getting up and digging through the mess on his floor, he found some wearable shoes and a jacket, then briefly threw together a bag in case he ended up staying overnight at Steve's. Heading to the second floor, Tony chose library-come-lounge, which had a balcony attached to it, and a sturdy trellis that snaked up the wall of the house beside it. Straddling the metal railing, it wasn't too difficult to find a foothold on the wall structure. The trellis stopped about a meter and a half above the ground, and he simply pushed off from the wall and twisting in the air, to land with only a slight stumble on the paving slabs in the stretching backyard.
He shook his head. "No, thanks. Not hungry."
