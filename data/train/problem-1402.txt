''Because I think that is somehow worsening,'' and I make a full body motion with my hand, ''this. This problem. These problems. Not just with eating. With everything, in a sense. I think it's connecting a lot of things - a lot of fears - for you. The red thread tying a lot of weighty stuff together.''
I work a belt through the appropriate places and tighten everything up several notches, somewhat surprised to see the gap of space between flesh and clothing. The bones of my hips are creating a ridge of empty space and I sigh in discomfort, the tightness of the belt making the skin around the bones ache even more than it normally does. When I inspect my sides, I realize they are lightly bruised. Not badly - but speckled with green and yellow bruising. I try to determine if I've recently fallen, or walked into anything clumsily, but I cannot recall any such event. What's more - the bruising is fairly evenly distributed, on both sides of my body.
Sherlock suddenly smiles. A smile that looks so much fuller than any I've ever seen that I almost look away. It's a fleeting smile, too - gone far too quickly - and painful to behold.
Sherlock starts to shake his head quickly back and forth at that - rising shakily on deer thin legs.
''It felt like it was mine. All mine. I knew it wasn't healthy, but I knew I made it exist. This thing that no one wanted me to do. But what did it matter? When they had done whatever they wanted to do to me, for nine years? Who were they to judge me? To take that away?''
Or rather, some part of my subconscious has thought about this: doing this, with him, in a different world, a different time.
'You think Mycroft is yours, don't you? You always want Mycroft. Never Daddy. Only Mycroft is good enough for the Little Prince, is he? Well Mycroft is mummy's, and mine - and you are no one's. And no one is yours. And no one will ever be yours, because you don't even want to love anyone. Look at you, Little Prince. You don't even want Daddy to touch you.'
''And what, Sally? You think you are onto something, and now you are owed an explaination? Sherlock owes you nothing! Nothing about himself! After how you have treated him, the terms you have called him! Since when does the personal issues of a 'freak' concern you, anyway?''
''Well, if Dr. Rouse arrives in the next few moments, please just let him know that I will only be but a minute.''
Mummy had to pick me up from Kindergarten because even my teacher couldn't get me calm. Couldn't get me to Be Quiet. And I screamed for Myco. Because he was gone.
“What do you mean, “grief”? I just told you that I feel like killing him. That’s not grief! I don’t grieve him! What is there to grieve other than the fact that I didn’t?”
This is only about him relieving the worst of his pain, and having me witness that reunion in present-time.
''How do you remember what happened, then? You were with him, you told me. You were with him sexually. What memories do you have of that time, Sherlock?''
''Of course not! I'm appealing to your common sense! I know you think I am a better choice to go up and talk to him, but you're considering sectioning him and if you think I will be the better choice to-''
I can be honest with him, or I can avoid the question. But he asked for me to be honest, so I close my eyes and press against the table with my hands. It feels grounding. Firm. Pressing back.
My own gaze locked onto Sherlock's tending, as long fingers placed the barest amount of resistance against the arm, which I could see had been shattered, portions of bone protruding through the flesh.
Sherlock continues to stare directly ahead of himself, while John nods briefly, then turns to his friend - obviously wanting collective assent.
I pad over to the small fridge and return a few moments later with water for them both, and an Italian Soda for myself.
“Ideally things like a DEXA scan – to determine current bone health and to reassess bone health and density as you progress. It will make a difference when calculating your target weight with greater accuracy as well as creating a more complete profile of health risks and relative strengths.”
She had no longer been sleeping and was on many different medications to control depression and issues relating to severe insomnia and severe panic attacks. She was thanatophobic, and at the time of this writing we still do not have the results back from the toxicologist (held up due to covid-19). The presumption at this time is that the recent increase of three medications that impede lung function (but which were used to control her depression, anxiety and insomnia) may have caused her lungs to stop working as efficiently and she may have passed suddenly in the night. (She had been born with hyaline membrane disease and had congenitally weak lungs). Her case is currently under investigation to see if medical malpractice might be an issue, since her health issues and lung weakness were well documented.
It’s a state of wholeness in which every part of my being works in congruence. Not the willful ignoring of that which might be painful, even minutely, for that which captures my attention because it lacks pain.
In our (admittedly) truncated therapy session together, I even got to witness the rapidity of his speech; his jumbled, frenzied way of speaking when upset. So, too, can I sense the pressure behind his writing as he races about with words and posts on his webpage - expounding about this substance or that substance, this assay or that titration.
''He used to read to Mycroft, though. Before Mycroft left for school in France. And I'd hear his voice, and he sounded so loving. Everyone thought he was so kind. Just a wonderful man, a wonderful father. I would sometimes open the door and sit in the hallway to listen to the stories. I know he was liked by a lot of people. I wasn't liked by anyone. The common denominator was me. Is me, John. It's me that people don't like. They didn't like me then, and they don't like me now.''
"'Sense'?," and his eyes are angry and hard, but when he speaks, it sounds like a sob, "How does it make sense? In your professional opinion, how would something like that explain me away? Go on! You tell me how something like that makes sense! How it could ever make sense, Doctor Watson!"
''When Sherlock arrived at the A&E he was lucid, but very frightened. I was one of the initial doctors ascribed to him, and later assisted with his operation. At initial intake he presented with a rapid heart rate, low pulse. So low that I was surprised he was still conscious. He had arrived with a woman, a detective, I believe.''
''You think I am being ridiculous too, don't you? You and he are on the same team, so what difference does it make what I even-''
Not when this disorder has been with him for the vast majority of his life with only superficial patches of physical health concealing the deeper issues.
''No,'' my mouth contorts in anger at the utterance. ''Nothing is okay,'' I get out before I can stop myself.
''You're not behind in any way! You're so much ahead of me in social skills alone,'' he retorts, his mouth a near-grimace.
''You're letting him win,'' he whispers now. ''When you hurt yourself like this, it's like he's winning.''
''What?'' I rasp, barely recognizing my voice. ''My God...they are *people* Sherlock...they, I would never-''
He now takes a seat to Sherlock's left, depositing his well-tailored form between Sherlock and Dr. Rouse.
Sometimes the pain doesn't come for an obscenely long time following an injury; more so if the injury is sharp and decisive and made by my own hand, in rage.
He looks away to the fridge, biting his tongue when he sees a plastic Ziploc bag with cut brain segments of a goat.
If I feel this pressing need to lance this poison from my throat, then what is Sherlock dealing with?
''That we can do,'' Lestrade admits, grabbing his scarf and gloves and rising from his chair. ''And I'll even keep you in the loop if we hear about any new developments, so long as you promise to take care of yourself - and not argue with John if he asks you to do something.''
“Yes. You are making excellent progress. The issue here isn’t so much that you are not making the ideal progress we want to see – but it really comes down to what I can do to help you and John formulate a plan that addresses issues such as nausea, gastric pain, gastroparesis symptoms – you name it. A gastrectomy is no small operation, and from your files it appears that the degree of damage to your stomach was severe. From that information alone, I know that you are in a substantial amount of physical pain, even now. Adapting to any diet is a challenge after a surgery. My goal is to help create a lifestyle plan that surrounds dietary practices and changes in exercise that will help you feel physically better. Ideally, in the future, I would also want to see you get you off some of these medications as we go further along.”
'Please don't. Please not,' I whisper into the sand. 'I don't want it, please. Please - I want to go back home. Be Done. Be Done now,' I beg.
The comment itself could mean so many things, and I feel my ears burn as I remember Mycroft's insinuations from just a few days prior.
Perhaps the memory of those past experiences will be enough to console him. Enough to remind him of moments when he was healthier, and seemingly happier, than he is currently.
I ease back to Sherlock. Words are still hard to choose right now. It would be too easy to speak and say anything.
I awake feeling a gnawing cold and survey my room; frosty light, white and piercing, is streaming through the venetians and it makes me want to groan and turn away from the source.
''You know exactly 'what','' Sally breathes, harshly. ''My God - it's all over him. Like soot. Like...something worse, and you know exactly what I'm talking about, so do not play games with me. He could have a neon sign swinging from around his neck and it wouldn't make it any more obvious!''
And it's not just his knowledge, or his passion, but the innovative way he fuses science with something that seems to me (and which I believe he'd be loath to admit) strikingly intuitive. However, he is ultimately drawn to the structured composition of science being undertaken. Science being lived out, if only just because he can test for something, test for a variable. Make an alteration to a condition, and see the changes in the situation.
I continue to read and learn that pairing an Ensure with a solid meal is likely not a good idea (the site discourages the consumption of liquids and solids at the same time, and recommends waiting 1/2 hour after finishing a solid meal before drinking anything, even water).
I close my eyes, and for the tenth time since hearing that doctor's condemning words, I silently wish for a get-out-of-jail-free card. A way to bypass the impending invasion into my personal life.
So the questions posed now seem all the more strange in their formality and their no-doubt false 'calmness.'
''I like you most of all,'' he whispers, bringing his wounded hand across his lap. I can see the spreading purple.
On this occasion I do not knock. I enter as soundlessly as possible and move as quietly as I am able, leaving my umbrella at the bottom of the stairs.
But he's doing this with me. He's doing this completely outpatient, and he wanted to know, he wanted to see.
Most people - if they did not have true compassion or respect for Sherlock - would have undoubtedly left the flat by now. Looked for a place to live elsewhere. Because, obviously, Sherlock is going through hell. But equally obvious is the fact that John is sticking by him and isn't about to walk away any time soon.
I can't meet his eyes any longer, and if he tries to get me to talk right now, I don't know how I am going to respond.
Even from this distance, I can make out John, black-patched coat and sandy hair, waiting on the steps.
I wake up to warm light glittering against my face and neck, and for a moment, I feel okay. I feel cloistered in between early morning dawn and John. Two calming realities.
His hand jumps out for mine; his fingers play with my fingers. I'm suddenly reminded of a child. He taps at my thumb with his pointer finger as if trying to get my attention without meeting my eyes.
“Yes, you did - because you are excellent at what you do. You are an excellent detective, and from what I can infer – you are likewise excellent at helping others in need – because you care and not in spite of caring. You are the antithesis of a sociopath. So let me just say this once more: I want that to be your next homework assignment. To stop using false labels when describing yourself.”
But I have come to learn that what he says, and the deeper motivations for why he does what he does - very rarely line up.
''Do you suspect you are repressing sexual feelings for men? Have you felt sexually attracted to males before?''
I pull back against my chair. Feel the leather ridges. The little nubs of buttons digging into my legs. Funny how I couldn't perceive them before.
"You git! Don't take your anger out on me! I was trying to help you last night, and I was trying to help you this morning. Don't you see, Sherlock? You can barely contain it right now! You never lose it on cases. But you did on this one! And if you can do it once, you can do it again! It means there are very real-"
''Don't worry about me. I'm fine with this weather. Just do whatever would be more comfortable for you,'' he responded with a practiced smile, face squinting against the board, nudging the now cast aside creamers to the side of the table.
He's breathing too rapidly. At this rate, he's going to start hyperventilating; it's then that I realize he's not simply woozy from shock of the injury or the blood loss as I had supposed in the past. He's been steadily becoming more and more anxious over the course of the evening and his deviation in routine was a giant, neon warning sign of this.
''I didn't care one whit if he were a Holmes. Because I did not care about lineage. But I did not want him to be cast aside, John. And, even as a child - even before he was born - I knew that was to be his fate. I thought, stupidly, that if I gave him a name that brought pride to the Holmes family, that one day the weight of the name would raise their estimation of Sherlock. I thought - in that way small children sometimes do - that I could make something better because I wished so hard for it to be better. I might as well have believed in faeries.''
I realize that I should have called him on his behaviour a long time ago, and that my willingness to indulge his odd little 'quirks' is not actually helping him at all. Especially since I know no one else would ever look out for him, like I would.
My eyes travel and land on my overnight bag, filled with toothbrush and comb, Sherlock's favourite soap and pajama bottoms. Snacks. What was I even thinking? Throwing crackers into my bag?
I battle away a surge of bitterness and anger at the situation. At being demoted, so to speak, from the case at all.
''I get that you are dealing with something incredibly difficult to describe, and that a lot of this stems from a lack of trust. Maybe even all of this stems from broken trust,'' I reply, the words thick against my teeth, and my tongue gummy. ''But can you try doing something for me? We can test something out, not unlike an experiment. You are excellent with experimentation. So let's look at this issue not from an emotional state. Let's try something new, alright? Can we try doing that?''
But I give him a brief smile of my own, then saddle on over to a circular Formica table, revelling in the screech of the plastic chair as it grates against the floor.
I don’t respond. I merely open the door, dabbing at the last of the cinnamon toothpaste that is starting to dry on my lips.
''Hello?,'' I say amicably into the phone, wondering if Sherlock's finally retracted his decision and is asking me to join him.
My brain does a static hiss. Like when you turn on the telly and there is no reception for the channel, so it comes in as white noise. Not readable. Not anything.
'''Best friend?','' he quips, and I realize he looks younger. ''Is that what they are calling it these days?''
''Everyone says that I need to gain weight, yet our meals are equal in size. So my meal is not an amount that is different to what people would eat normally, who are considered to be at a healthy weight. Yet - if I am underweight - then I feel that you'd have made mine larger. But it's not larger. So it causes me to think that perhaps you have no problem with my weight. Maybe I am not underweight at all. Maybe not.''
''John?,'' and Sherlock is watching me carefully, his eyes skirting back and forth. Studying my face for clues.
''You're my best friend! My best friend! And right now I am beyond confused, because I know you are scared of something really huge, but I don't know what the hell that is! So just tell me, Sherlock! Please just tell me!''
“So let’s go over the assignment. Let’s be methodical here. We know that we can extract all the information that we need to solve this, right?”
“Then why am I in therapy if what I’m doing – how I am responding – isn’t abnormal? Isn’t therapy for abnormal people? Not people coping in a normal fashion?”
''Do you want to continue?,'' he asks, and he seems genuinely patient. I realize then that I don't know if this is Sherlock's first kiss, or his 100th. I don't know anything about the man, in this regard. I don't know if this is pure affection, how he views the act. How he thinks of touch, or sex, or if this is pure, deep affection. I don't know if what I feel for him is sexualized, or romantic.
And even then I had been drawn to psychiatry and had considered it as my profession of choice if I were to proceed in any direction based on personal interest and not parental expectation – so I began looking at my friend from the perspective of one motivated by the study of human behavior as it applied to mental health issues.
''I know, sweetheart,'' I respond quickly. Too quickly, voice perhaps too raw in affection for his current taste. ''But you see that you have to, don't you? This has a limit, Sherlock. No one can do this to themselves without an end. This has to stop.''
From the break room kitchen, I watch him flounce through the door, and walk down the hallway. Before he reaches the end of the path, I see his shoulders slump and his entire chest rattle and shake, his hands in taut fists at his side.
''It's...look: I have no problem with her being gay. But everything got messed up. Her sexual identity and her drinking. And sometimes that lead to some pretty bad stuff.''
''So you're worried that - what? You have difficulty understanding who you are? Without those experiences? Without the feeling of hunger?''
He's quiet for an impossibly long moment and when he begins to speak again, his voice is rough and low and husky, as if his lungs are congested.
I won't no way be able to run away now. I should have listened to the Trees. But where would I go? Even if I could get to the gate, the Martian would send others in space vehicles and they'd pick me up. And they'd take me back.
''Seven months back? That's before the case with Harrison. That's months before Toby was even taken,'' I say pertly, my stomach revolting.
''I don't know how to answer that,'' he says primly. ''There is my body and then there is my mind, and they are not in collaboration any longer.''
''You promised me. You said you wouldn't leave me. You said you wouldn't. Because everyone else did. You made it sound like you actually cared!''
'It's only three more years, Sherlock,' he whispers, rubbing my back. 'One day, three years will seem so fast. Like you blink, and it's all over.'
Could I have been so unaware as to not consider that John has been drinking – and even eating – much of the same beverages and foods as I have been doing these last few weeks? That these were the concessions he has made silently while I’ve gripped about decaffeinated coffee as if it was the end of the world?
''I guess so,'' I breathe out harshly, ''I...do you mind?,'' I ask carefully, not sure if I've offended him.
Sherlock nods slightly, his hands clenched into fists. The blankets are trapped between his fingers.
''You WON'T? You are deranged! I'm calling Inspector Lestrade right now! Don't you dare take one extra step with my child!''
''I hate this,'' he stutters against my ear, repeating his earlier words. ''I hate what I feel. Please, I just need-,'' but he stops, because even he seems to know that the words speak of disorder.
I just looked at him and saw weakness pervading his body and obsessiveness pervading his mind. I saw his withering form and associated it with a withering of sanity, too, but at some level he is all-too sane.
''Yes - yes he is,'' I replied, engrossed with the man's quick stride, purposeful, as he came over slightly at last.
And that, somehow, then made the ache even worse. So eventually you tried to separate from your family outright. Because that would be easier than having to see their faces as the decades wore on, with the realization that out of four people - only one really survived.
''I don't have a problem with anyone else's sexuality,'' I say, insistent. The last thing I want is for my not-yet therapist to take offense. ''My sister is homosexual.''
''What is it?,'' he asks petulantly, as if my anxiety is not something he is observing. As if I'm just waking him up from a nap for the sake of being a pest.
''His doctor told me that upon admittance he was mumbling, ''Tell John I'm sorry.'' So, yes - it's fairly clear that he knows what he's done. At least in some basic capacity, as it stands. That he regrets doing what he's done tonight? I have no doubt that his self-loathing has just increased due to his impetuous actions.''
''Blasted fucking shrinks,'' I rage. ''The man has two free spaces per week and is denying me access to both.''
''I'm thirsty,'' he says suddenly - imperiously - and out of the blue. ''I'd like some orange juice. No pulp. And no ice. A straw.''
I blink, then look over abruptly. Without meaning to. Find myself studying the photo and feeling something like...
''Well that's a foundation. Something to work with - and that's important. It would explain the confusion you feel. You probably feel very, very torn about a lot of what you do and a lot of what you are encouraged to do by people who care about you, too.''
John retrieves my coffee mug, and I rise quickly, placing my hands over my belly. I can already feel the slight swell of skin as my stomach puffs out with the weight of the food.
''I'll be over here,'' John says simply, touching the sleeping bag. His voice closed in upon itself. Like an echo of a voice.
I sit up abruptly, certain that I know what to say now that the shock is wearing off, and as I do so I turn on the opposing table lamp, flooding our living room in the white luminescence of the halogen.
''It's all fine now,'' I get out - not knowing if I want to break contact with him and run up the stairs, or if I want him to fully hug me again.
''Can I have some more water first?,'' I say uneasily, suddenly feeling off. Feeling strange. I can smell a slight floral scent of her shampoo. Lily of the Valley, something like that. It reminds me of something. Something.
''You are not observing, John. You don't get it and I can't make you get it, and I don't want you to get it and-''
''It doesn't work that way. You don't just wish for something to change, and have it happen. It's doesn't make sense, biologically, John. But I did it, somehow.''
''Yes! DON'T you think I know how everyone sees me? Why do you think I call myself a sociopath? It doesn't matter how much I try to understand what people feel! I can't! I'm empty inside! I've always been empty inside! Yuri's not going to help, inpatient isn't going to help! And Harrison? I just as surely killed him as the murderer did!''
''Do I know of a non-defective nutritionist?,'' I repeat, slowly, if only to qualify that he wasn't trying to insult an entire profession. Which I suspect he actually was, if only to drive my attention away from the proceeding topic.
''Wha- for?,'' I question, garbled, my mouth full of Red Delicious. I don't know what I think I am doing, requesting a more extracted admission. What I think it will accomplish.
A brief allusion to a hospital stay, and Sherlock not feeling 'up' to visitors. And I didn't push, I didn't pry, but I still feel like I should reach out in some low key way.
'You'll know you'll feel worse. Bloated. Swollen. It'll just touch you all over. The food. From the inside. Until you get it out again.'
He looks so small. It's hard to believe he's over 6 feet under those contorted angles pulled in and covered up in blankets.
'''It's going to be okay','' he says with his sore voice, repeating the statement as if it's a mantra.
''I-,'' Sherlock gets out in fatigue. Just the single word. Just an ''I.'' Nothing follows. It is the start of a sentence that could lead to a rivulet of emotion, and then a stream, and then to a torrential downpour of anxiety and shame and conflicting views. Paradoxical views.
''What's it going to be like?,'' he asks tentatively. ''What's it going to feel like? How are you going to feel if you, say, eat this sandwich?''
I can't indulge in the thoughts with him in my presence, however. And John, unfortunately, is still studying me. I feel a little dreadful considering the prospect that maybe this is just how things are going to be between us now. I have a hard enough time being seen in physical pain or weakness. Even emotions relating to pleasure, or joy, make me feel strange. Uneasy. As if my enjoyment of anything sensorial - be it eating a meal, or smelling a scent, or delighting in the feel of new soft clothing against my skin - is skirting a reality tinged with something perverse. As if it is wrong to feel good emotionally, and certainly physically.
''I don't think it's about what you're 'supposed' to feel,'' I manage to get out, almost dizzy with grief. ''There's simply what you feel, and what you don't feel - and healthy or unhealthy responses to those emotions. That response – to harm yourself - is an unhealthy one. I think you know that much. I think you appreciate that intellectually.''
I give him a raised eyebrow before taking the book and trying to quell my need to act in an imperiously dismissive fashion.
''Sherlock-,'' he starts, wanting me - I know - to eat something, and not knowing how to address the subject with any force. Especially since I've just done one large thing that he's wanted me to do for days now.
I smile into the air, finding John's tone amusing, then pull my feet up and under my body. Sitting cross legged, I watch him as he prepares the meal.
"I realize that. I do," and I pause for a moment, to get a bit of oxygen into my cells. "And - God - I am not criticizing Sherlock. I'm not. I just had no idea. I didn't even consider that he had been hurt like that."
''John?,'' Sherlock asks hesitantly, his legs tapping up and down against the lino. ''I just wanted to show you that I could, for you-''
Then I think of John, and his habit of always wearing layers. I've never even asked him if he's cold. Just assumed that it was his preferred style too.
My brother rolls his eyes. Actually rolls his eyes at me in derision, and something inside tears apart. Like a loose filling in my tooth. Pulled or extracted or suddenly lost.
It's had been nearing 7 pm by the time we decided to call it an evening. The game itself was fast paced and interesting, but I failed spectacularly against Sherlock on all three games we played together.
''Yes, I understand you. Nothing out of your mouth is ever so difficult to comprehend that I don't immediately understand.''
''Okay,'' I repeat, mirroring his sentiment. ''Good. You did really well, Sherlock. It's going to be okay.''
I pass a small canopy bed, and a toy chest. The bed is made, and absolutely covered in soft plush dolls and stuffed animals. I recognize the grubby white snow owl doll, taking center space, along with a mammoth dragon, a brontosaurus, a mucky looking teddy bear wearing corduroy trousers, a satin hare, a bright pink pig, and a Cabbage Patch doll.
''Little while,'' Sherlock breaths out, and abruptly stops playing with the blocks, sitting back against the sofa, and wrapping one arm around his belly. ''Not long.''
I put my phone on mute and decide to get a Pepsi from the vending machine. Something with some caffeine. It's not the healthiest thing, no - but it will do in a pinch. My energy is flagging. Then I slump down in a chair in the 'family room.'
''What is it, eh? You're dropping weight, dearheart,'' I muttered to his side, against his ear, and he pulled back. Microscopically pulled back.
Whether that is part of the reason behind his recent loss of weight and self-abuse needs to covered in therapy, but I can't help feeling that if these feelings are new for him - that if he's, indeed, feeling anything skirting the romantic - that the self-abuse may have developed yet again out of confusion of those feelings or revulsion of what those feelings indicate.
"Trying to help," I scoff. "He's just trying to appease his own guilty conscience. If he spoke to you - believe me - it was more for his benefit, not mine."
“I guess I am off then. You need the shower first? I mean, you do look a tad on the crappy side,” Patrick interjects, pulling me out of my thoughts. “No offense.”
The fact that he is disheartened with me is actually makes me feel sick inside. Sick, anxious, and nervous.
I extricate myself from the duvet, and turn lightly against the wall, trying not to tug on the sheets and awaken him. After a few seconds of lightly maneuvering myself around as slowly and carefully as I can, I make it to the edge of the bed, where I slowly slide out and walk carefully to my chest of drawers, collecting clothes for the day. My mobile sits on top of the oak top surface, and I take it quickly, pocketing in my dressing gown pocket before padding away as softly as I can.
At the time of his admittance to Evelina, four of his toenails had previously darkened and fallen off due to compression of his shoes and swelling of his feet. This actually happens in any runner without the respite of normal and proper breaks. Additionally, Devon's nipples were bleeding from the constant rubbing of his skin against his running shirt (over many hundreds of kilometers in less than a weeks time). His gums were recessed from a combination of malnutrition and vomiting. His hair had fallen out in patches.
I'm fuming mad, but not with Sherlock, and I don't want him mistakenly taking my anger at the situation as anger with him.
''I'm sorry; I have very little additional information. But when we get an update, I will alert you. And one of the surgeon's may speak to you once they are finished.''
"It hasn't impacted his entire life. Sherlock's performed admirably, given what he had to live through."
I touch his wrist. Stroke the flesh carefully. Hate the fact that I can feel old pin-prick scars from needle use. A history of red constellations when starving wasn't enough.
''Sherlock said he'd need an internal, and he had that look in his eyes - you know the one - like he's seeing something that no one else can see?,'' Donovan tries again, her breath coming out in a rattle. ''And for once in his life he seemed to care about someone else too, so-''
My flat mate lays back lazily in the black plastic chair. It's an attempt at looking disinterested. Passive, in that posh-brat-schoolboy way. But I'm not buying his act for a second.
''Oh, come off it!,'' John interrupts, seemingly tired of Sherlock's excuses. ''I am more than sensitive to 'variations in bodily compositions', so let's stop with this. All of this. This is about you not taking care of yourself. That's why we are here. And nothing I have said or done seems to make a difference, and I think - if you were honest with everyone right now, in this room - you'd admit that you are doing some very unhealthy things. Things that don't make sense. But rather than own them, you are trying to make it seem like the essentials that all people need - food being a very big one, Sherlock! - don't apply to you. And they do. Of course they do! Just admit that much!,'' and John's voice is craggy now. ''Please just stop trying to deny that!''
''Aside from sick of questions, how are you feeling?,'' the doctor clarifies. ''Physically, emotionally?''
My arms are heavy with the weight of the four double bagged groceries, and I fumble for my keys. Which is rather pointless, as I hear the door lock start to turn on its own. And then suddenly John is there, staring at me with a look of disappointment. He silently takes three of the bags and marches back up the stairs before I can protest.
Neither of us mention the fact that I've slept through the entire day already and am still exhausted.
“I was very safe there,” he whispers, and I have to strain once more to hear the admission. “He never found me. Not once. Who would think that I could hide up on a curtain rod, anyway? It was peaceful and dark. Everything was blue from moonlight, and eventually I fell asleep high up by the ceiling, behind the venetians.”
I then hear the rustling of someone getting up abruptly, and Lestrade's distinct voice - ''Yeah,'' calling out.
Still, some things have improved. I have been granted access to an electric razor that I can use whenever I feel fit. So I wash my face, then lather up some shaving foam, and go at sprucing myself up for my upcoming appointment.
''You need a painkiller, maybe?,'' I ask cautiously, softly. Loud noises can be just as bad as harsh lights when you are suffering from a migraine. ''Or is it just auric symptoms? Nausea and the like?''
John's eyes are still studying mine, looking at the empty bottle, squinting, trying to piece everything together.
''Lestrade might be better off for it. Might prompt him to actually invest in something that looks a bit more sanitary.''
“Sherlock? Listen to me, alright? We are going to solve this, okay? I know I have said this before, but we are going to get this all straightened out.”
I look at the glass filled with water, let myself hear the sounds of the refrigerator running in the background, the wail of am ambulance further off, the sound of cars making their way to work outside.
The small stone house is illuminated by two hanging lanterns. A flower garden swims out and around the house, and towards the back. Wildflowers, maybe some irises. It looks very natural. Very beautiful.
He stacks four blocks on top of one another. His shoulders are still tight, and he gives me a strange, childlike shrug.
''Some of those go straight through cartilage,'' he mutters, looking sick. ''They could have done themselves real harm if they didn't know what they were doing. Which...being that they are only in year 8 or something...I doubt-,'' and again he trails off. He's trailing off quite a bit lately.
''It's what I have, John, when everything else is absent,'' he whispers, insistent. ''You are asking me to give up what I have. It makes me feel like I can breathe,'' he says in a rush, an edge of something dark and dangerous and full of fight lining his words. ''It doesn't just make things feel ok. It's how I can breathe.''
Pureed foods are recommended and seem to be tolerated best by most patients still in the recovery phase of surgery.
So when he decides I'm too much for him to deal with, it's just going to be all the more cutting when he goes away.
When I look back down at the boy, pulled by the flurry of movement, he's holding the packet of unopened digestives in his hand. He's holding them out for me.
“I could kill him, you know. If he were still alive, I could kill him. I could. I’m not just saying that. I could do it,” he responds with forced composure and repetitious words - as if by repeating his position, I will believe it.  Or maybe that he’ll believe it.
His eyes clench up, as if he's squinting against bright light. Even though the day is moody and grey with melting pockets of snow and a frosty edge turning the air into something sharp, and yet oddly clean. Like breathing in ice-cold alpine air. Invigorating, but brisk. A sensation of something good, but nestled on the cusp of being almost too painful.
“The sense of rejection and all that entails when your biological father denied wanting to establish a relationship with you. The sense of anxiety that can accompany any shift with a significant other – certainly a best friend – out of fear of what could change. The horror that accompanied a brutal case, especially one with parallels to your own childhood and the grief – yes, grief - over not being able to save those children.”
''I wasn't rejecting you,'' John says stiffly, almost out of the blue. Bringing me back to the present. ''I just need a little bit of time to process what you're saying, because I didn't expect that sentiment. Not that level of intensity, maybe,'' he whispers, voice just a hair away from trembling. ''But that's my issue, Sherlock. Not yours. My reaction wasn't a rejection of you, or your words.''
''Exactly. Unfortunately the site of bleeding was too profuse to stem via the avenue of the endoscopy, and so we determined that he'd need surgery to stop the bleed. Another concern that I had during this time was the presentation of necrotic tissue. Not simply a rupture due to ulceration, but tissue that would need to be excised in addition to stopping the primary bleed. That was actually the reason for the length of the surgery.''
''Please promise me. Because I might not be okay for awhile, and I don't want you to leave. It might not be gone right away.''
''Sherlock has inserted himself into this case to this degree because it's personal, but if he's having some sort of-''
''He's with me, Miss Jenkins,'' Mycroft says smoothly, although when I turn to look up I can see the corners of pain edging along his eyes and a slight haggard look about his face. His movements lack their typical crispness as he turns and moves towards me.
''Is this the room where the doctors dole out the bad news?,'' my voice rushes forward, all high notes and barely restrained terror.
Sherlock looks wan. His face, additionally, looks thinned out more than it ever has before... The ridgeline of the bones of his face are even more prominent now, and the sunken look around his temples is alarming. Without thinking, truly without thinking, my fingertips connect with the bones and I tentatively feel the temple area of his skull, before lightly stroking down to his cheek, and rubbing the pad of my thumb over his face.
When he's standing in nothing but his pants, he turns back to face me. Lightly presses against his bladder for show.
''Look, Greg - I'm in Tesco's. I...can I-?,'' and I stop and calm myself, ''can I call you back in a few?''
And from what?  I don't even know. If pressed, I wouldn't be able to explain the fear, the revulsion. Not for everyone else, but for myself. For the expectations that I should be partaking in things, in events, in ways of being - with others - that I have no interest in.
Took another sip of red, then. Some of the wine dribbled down the corner of his mouth, and I moved in and kissed the wine away with my tongue.
Sherlock's scrapes another bit of yogurt from the bowl and while internally I'm cheering, externally I don't want to come across as a push-over. He's eating, thank God, but he's still lazing about when he should be out of the flat and on his way to see his psychiatrist.
''I like numbers. I like to control them,'' he says softly, quietly, quickly. ''None of this will change immediately, even if I wanted it to...''
We pull up to the entrance and as the vehicle stops I see the door open to reveal Mycroft's presence. He watches me carefully, his face looking rather inscrutable.
''You seem...,'' I hesitate for a second, then continue on, certain I am doing the right thing. ''We aren't playing, right? You want me to be straight. So I'll say what I mean. You are unhealthy, Sherlock. You are unhealthy, and you are scaring me. And I'm not the only one whose noticing what's happening.''
I tread carefully, stopping when I see the familiar black boots, the swoosh and flow of a navy blue trench. The blue scarf has been discarded to the floor - probably to keep it away from the line of sick.
That he's considering the dynamic of my friend engaging so skillfully with a traumatized boy as being evidence for something more.
''It's Sherlock. He's - I don't know - Sally says he was holding his stomach, and we had to call A&E and-''
It's then - when someone is being comforting - it is then that I feel the most intense self-loathing imaginable. I have no idea why, and part of me wishes those feelings could depart.
"She told me that she had been concerned for Toby for awhile. That he had said and done things that she found inappropriate. Sexually inappropriate."
Below is a photo of me and my sister when we were around six months old. The little girl on (your) the left is my sister. (It is easy to tell us apart even as infants as she was cheerier and had wide and welcoming eyes.)
Miso is essentially broth. While healthy enough as part of a balanced meal structure, on its own it's not enough to sustain a mouse.
''I don't know,'' he says primly, and it's only now that I hear it: a raspy edge to his voice. A hoarseness.
Lestrade swallows. I see his adam's apple bob. He's pinching the inside of his cheek with his teeth.
The apartment, I notice, is very clean, just like the hallway. Surprisingly, it is not how I envisioned it to be. Dark wood floors, and a grey-blue sofa. Two sets of floor to ceiling mahogany bookshelves, crammed with books, papers, magazines, medical journals. And lots of plants. Climbing plants, ferns, potted trees. It almost feels like a forest. Yellow walls. Warm. And I can smell vanilla. I sit down on the sofa, and take in the soft throw, in something like a herringbone print. Grey and brown, flecks of black. Muted, subtle. More sophisticated than I'd expect.
And not. In some ways - things are running better. Smoother. He's picking up after himself, he's washing his dishes. He's gone to Tesco for milk and creamer. So in some ways things seem better.
''I've cleaned the table now,'' I assure my doctor. Wanting to put my head on the table and close my eyes and sleep.
''Well, I never told him - though I think he may have suspected. He was always very gentle with me.''
And there we have the contradictory nature of emotions and logic. I logically know that Sherlock is the victim. I fully appreciate it emotionally. Yet, just as intense - I know my own emotional feelings wouldn't be all that different to Sherlock's. He obviously went through a much harder adolescent than even I did, but the feeling of wanting to hide? Of feeling as if you have something *to* hide?
Soon I can't breathe very much at all, and the explorer removes his helmet, and picks me up out of my space car. 'Come here, baby,' the explorer says, and I feel woozy. Because I can't breathe on Mars without my space helmet and oxygen tank. I shake my head back and forth. It's too far to go. I won't make it. I will die from not enough oxygen.
Suddenly the innocuous has become the demonic. The innocent is dark and brutal and laden with sickness and threat.
You don't walk away because you stop loving a person. You walk away from the arguments and the trials and the tantrums and the deception because you do love them. But sometimes you forget that you are not fighting them, you are fighting a disorder.
He's scared at the prospect of stopping his abnormal habits and eating normally. Or, as normally as he ate before. Which certainly wasn't normal, by any stretch of the imagination, but it was certainly better than his eating as of late.
"I'm sure he wanted to keep you safe, honey," and the endearment slips out too quickly, too easily, and it's because all of this bloody hurts to even hear about. I can't comprehend how he feels. And knowing that - I take a deep breath, and try to avoid calling attention to the slip. "I'm sure he really wanted to, Sherlock. Even to this day, he seems to be concerned with that very issue. Of keeping you safe."
I always regret it, but rarely seem to be able to avoid succumbing to my mercurial happenings. These mindless ventures out towards something. Something ill-defined.
He was – and always has been - brilliantly funny, relentlessly kind, and quirky in all the best ways. Yet at the time he seemed like the type of rascal I used to consider a “player.” Of course, this wasn’t based on me actually knowing the man with anything approaching depth and more my appreciation of the stereotypes.
''We want you to speak to one of our liaison psychiatrists,'' Dr. Riley says evenly, not seemingly put off by Sherlock's rudeness.
The inability to identify or describe emotions as they present to our own selves. The inability, at times, to fully register the feelings as they encroach.
I look down abruptly then, fiercely angry with myself. And there is so much that I could say now. But all of it would look pretty awful. Pretty horrible.
''I'm not bringing anyone else into this, John! It's none of Lestrade's business! He can take me off this case, for all I care.'
''I'm afraid that's not going to happen,'' I whisper through the door. ''I will give you five seconds, and then we are talking. Without the partition.''
He stands up quickly then, wipes his mouth on some more toilet paper, then moves to exit the stall. I respond first, and slam the door closed. Something is not right.
''I'm proud of you, yeah? You know that, right? You're the bravest person I know. To tell me what you've told me tonight? To confide in me like that?''
''Sherlock?,'' I say softly, though my voice seems to reverberate and come out far more loudly than the sound of the man retching up at the end of the hallway.
''I thought, I thought maybe...,'' but I don't know how to finish the idea. I don't know if it's wise to do so, even if I could.
No, the Sherlock of my brain (of my 'mind palace' if such a thing exists) is the Sherlock of yester-year. When I first met him, really.
And bizarrely enough, those words scare me even more than Yuri's previous talk about suspected childhood psychosis.
And perhaps, deep down, it could make sense. But only from the perspective of one who considers someone in the trap of such behaviour to be subconsciously flirting with death. To be, perhaps, prone to suicidal ideation.
''Children?,'' I say carefully, not thinking that this is what he means at all - but wanting to prove a point.
"He opened his eyes this morning. About 3 am. His mother called Lestrade a couple hours later. She wants to talk to you. I think she wants you to talk to her son too, actually."
Mycroft slowly gets up, and walks across the study to stand near the bay windows. The sun has now completely set, and the lamps lining the street outside have turned on to illuminate the roads.
I take another sip of tea. It burns my stomach and makes my body feel even more hollow and strange. I don't know if I like the sensation, or hate it.
Second later - which feel like minutes, truthfully - I see her pad from her work station and tentatively open the door.
''Alright, Sherlock. I understand,'' I test carefully. ''And I know you are probably feeling pretty overwhelmed right now. So I want you to text John and ask him to come back to the flat as soon as possible, alright? Is that okay with you?''
It was a sketching of a woman's interior. A heavily pregnant woman. The drawing focused in greatest detail on the curvature of the fetus, the hands so miniaturized, the face serene.
''If you take this as something you are doing, to yourself, to hurt yourself - you're not seeing what I'm seeing. Not entirely. What I'm seeing in you.''
I think of kindness - to receive kindness, or comfort - in a way I imagine some who are more puritanical might think about sex.
"It can also be triggered by emotional trauma, Sherlock," I say gingerly, a minute later. "It's fairly common in children who have been sexually assaulted. It's fairly well known, in fact."
''Your mouth showed signs of inflammation, which could indicate a previous history of vomiting. Have you been recently been sick, beyond today?''
Moreover, the sting of their rejection was still newly painful and isolating, and the last thing I wanted to do was give an ultimatum to a friend who also seemed to be caught up in something equally painful and isolating.
I quickly, inconspicuously, try to take in his demeanor and his form. His frame is solid, but he's lost weight recently. It shows in his face. His body doesn't naturally edge towards being lanky or gangly, I can tell, so the weight loss doesn't accent natural thinness. It just makes him look sickly. He has well defined muscles, but also carries no excess weight. A standard, but usually physically healthy mesomorph. He's shorter than I would have been at 9 years of age - and I could tell this quickly just from the night when I had picked him up. He's likely not even in the 4 foot range yet. His face is round and full, but not chubby. His eyes are dark blue, normally, but are now marred by intracranial bleeding, and the sclera is now a disturbing rosy pink. He's a towhead, but his hair is starting to darken into something sandy.
He even seems to have the capacity to work well with others when he sets his mind to the task. Yet, Sherlock has fashioned a life around his controls, and his ability to reject or allow the continued procession of a routine.
I resist the urge to squirm in my seat. Shake my limbs. Try to flick off this restlessness in my cells. This agitation.
''So you're coming?,'' he confirms, a moment later. Staring at his yogurt, still only partially consumed.
I know that his actions have shocked me, but the anger I feel isn't really generated by him. Rather the situation, and the fact that so many have convinced him that sooner or later - anyone, especially one who says that they love him - will expect, if not demand things he cannot give without huge and tormenting doubt, if not panic.
And despite my attempts to give him his privacy, I find that I still traipse back down the hall and listen silently to the sound of his splashing, the sounds he makes as he brushes his teeth, and the sound of swirling water as it runs down the drain.
''This is not something to be ashamed about, love,'' I rush to assure him, the endearment reasserting itself unplanned once more. Released automatically. I do not fail to notice that the word almost seems to cause a greater increase in Sherlock`s fidgeting. Oddly, rather than putting him at greater ease - it's increasing his apparent anxiety. Yet since I don't know why this could be, I carry on. ''Anymore than having diabetes, or appendicitis or any other-''
He can scarcely maintain eye contact, and instead lets his vision settle on the damnable skull on the mantle. That morbid thing.
It can make patients do impulsive things. It can make them act out in unusual, unexpected ways. Ways that don’t necessarily help reduce their rage. Ways that only serve to cause themselves more pain.
I don't care anymore about the label, though. Or the fear in my gut at how I identify, or what my parents would think, or about romantic issues or anything else.
"Sherlock," I say uncomfortably, suddenly irritated by my discomfiture. I don't know what to do, I don't even know if he needs anything I can provide, but I don't want to pretend that everything is okay when we both know that's really not true.
''Eat your food, please,'' I state cleanly when he makes no move to do likewise. No obsequiousness in my tone, however - nothing that should grate on his nerves.
He doesn't get the fact that the thought of eating anything else right now makes me want to scream. Makes me want to gag.
Sherlock takes the paper warily, as if the exercise is a trick. His eyes are scanning my face, roaming over the landscape of my features. Trying to catch the deception.
Sherlock shrugs, takes a bite. Moves towards a bench, as if fatigued. We've been walking through the park for about 45 minutes, true, but he's never shown such fatigue in all the years I've known him.
Honestly, I don't know what will ever work for Sherlock. Even Mycroft's no doubt countless attempts to get his brother help, since childhood, have obviously not done the trick. All that money, all those resources, and all those no-doubt high powered shrinks haven't lessened the impact of what he had to live through, because that's what this is all about, isn't it?
I give John a slight smile to show my awareness that they have to get going. That they are already, no doubt, running late.
Following my twin's passing I lost our mum to a rare and aggressive form of cancer. She passed on Mother's Day. (I was resting beside her in her hospital bed. I hope it brought her some peace).
Sherlock studies me silently, then rises from his little blanket cocoon on the couch and trots up the stairs back to his room.
I realized then that he was speaking to me as if discussing a science problem. Keeping the language too far away from my innards.
''We're about to speak to Toby's mother. Do you want to be present for that, or have you had your fill of stuff today, Sherlock?''
''I don't...I never had a number in mind. I just like to see it change, knowing I made the change happen. I did. No one else did that, I did that.''
I study him briefly and note that he looks spooked, but is calming down in rapid progressions as I sit upright.
''I like you more hands-on like this, Lock,'' I assured him. ''I hated seeing you so fearful. Hated feeling like I pushed you, or something.''
His hands smell of citrus dish soap, and he brings the calloused tips across my forehead, coming to let the digits fall against my eyes. They feel cool and grounding contrasted against the heat swelling up under my eyelids.
''There's more than those. Some on my arms, although most...most of them you can't feel with your body because they weren't as deep when I - when I made them,'' he whispers, his eyes closed. ''But I didn't want to hide them from you anymore. I want you to feel them. Feel everything.''
''How did he die?,'' I ask suddenly. Not knowing what photos are still to come, and not knowing if I want to be presented with certain images given how I am currently feeling.
''I saw that there was a chance, and I found him. And it's not to my credit, John. It doesn't make me a good person that I continued on,'' his voice falters, and I repress an urge to hug him, ''but I saw what I could do for him. And now, I can see what I can do for him, again, and no one else seems to see it. No one else is taking this seriously!''
''Of course I was upset! I had just woken up from a horrible nightmare!,'' and the words come out as a hiss. A long, drawn out hiss. Like an engine that has overheated. ''Was I supposed to be okay with remembering how my father had worked up to having intercourse with me? On my eighth birthday, no less, the sick bastard,'' Sherlock finishes, his whole body the very picture of misery. ''Except I was the bastard, wasn't I? Fucking sick...monster,'' he whispers to no one. To his duvet perhaps, which he suddenly swats away with his hand as if it is an irksome fly.
My shivering has increased since the shower, and now - even with the clothing, I find I am feeling pretty cold. I decide to check my wardrobe for a jumper, which I eventually find. A soft wool jumper all in navy blue, that I haven't actually donned in about a decade, believe it or not. A turtle neck fashion, so it compresses against my body a bit more than I'd like, but the benefit of it is that I quickly do feel warmer. And right now, I will take heat over some ridiculous Mycroft-purchased style.
A strange disconnect cuts through my mind, because this looks superficially like something sexual. Undeniably he's trying to make this sexual. He's trying to make himself aroused, and in the process he's trying to make me aroused; and it's a desperate sort of rocking, now, but the motions seem akin to those of someone reliving a trauma. That awareness makes it all too real: his body damp with sweat, his thighs flexing against my shocked form, his hands curled up into little fists, pulled against his belly, his eyes scrunched up tightly as if terrified.
''It's not just one low night. I've seen people with conditions like yours... felled like trees. It can happen to anyone. Even someone as spectacular as you!''
The real healing, for him, will occur when he feels that insistent tug towards self-care and self-compassion.
"I mean, in my head - I became a ghost. I crawled up the side of the wall. And I looked down, and I could see I was crying. My body was shaking, and I was crying, and then I focused on the moon, and the blueness. The entire room was blue, John. My face, my hands, the dresser. My bear. And then I wasn't scared anymore because if I was a ghost, nothing could hurt me."
''Of course he got clean! He's right as rain now, John. Hard work for him, too. It's why I think he keeps himself so busy, see. Doesn't want that old anxiety to come calling. You know how he likes to keep busy. Keeps saying he's bored. But it's more than boredom, I think. It's his need to always be...ahead of any impulse that would take him back there,'' and Mrs. Hudson suddenly clasps my hands, lifting them off the table and giving me a brighter grin. ''Don't you go worrying about that. It's an old chapter of his life. He's a strong one, and that chapter is done now.''
In his child-hands, Sherlock is holding onto a bright red ball, the colour of blood. A parody of a toy, really, because there is no play in his expression. No whimsical cheeky grin. No enjoyment in holding the ball. He has likely been commanded to do so, as the pinched fingers holding the ball are whiter than even the rest of his pallid-self.
“Uh huh. Sure. I’ll see you later, sweets,” he says, rooting around for his coat and gloves. “And Yuri?”
“So I’m off now, Mr. Serious. Are we still going to that whole Jenny dinner thingamajig tonight? Or do you think we can use your cold as an excuse to skip? Aelish has the flu, so I mean-”
I had pushed myself up from the chair. Pointed at the black and white photo of a little girl. The photo had been taken in the autopsy bay. A metal tray, a Y incision, and a five year old child with water slicked hair, combed back and away from her mottled face by the ME.
“Grief is a response to loss, Sherlock. You may not grieve the loss of the man that was your father. But that doesn’t mean that you cannot grieve everything else that usually accompanies such a death. The loss of what you know you can never have: the childhood that you never got to experience - the type of childhood that you could see others enjoying and wished for yourself, or the bonds with your parents that you rightfully should have experienced and would have experienced if they had been loving and mentally healthy people. Those are all losses. The most terrible kinds of losses.”
I have no way of knowing one way or the other if Mycroft is annoyed with me at all. I can't read him at the best of times.
''I've thought about what you said,'' he admits shakily. ''About how I should be trying to focus on everything with less emotion than I have in the past.''
So John leaves, his brows creased in worry and for a second or two I simply stare at the mirror. Just stare, and imagine what it would feel like to have everything stop. The hunger, the fullness, the guilt, the fear.
In the next second, I am staring at the years-old smiley face on the wall. The neon yellow slanted face.
''Or I can work something out with you, and with his current psychiatrist. It would be stricter than what he currently has had to deal with, but it would still leave him some basic liberties that he would not have if he were to be hospitalized.''
In fact, one time - just once - I tried to ask him about it, and ended up with a flurry of ''I'''s and ''umm's'' and the oddest deflections before he pulled his satchel across his chest and informed me that he was late to a tutoring session.
““At the core of the unattached is a deep-seated rage, far beyond normal anger. This rage is a natural byproduct of protracted, severed trust to a degree that is found in the most serious cases of childhood abuse, especially in cases of rape or molestation. Confusion and physical pain alone do not generally account for the detachment. Instead, an underlying motivation – one rooted in the preservation of a sane but self-imposed reality-,” I stop, breathing harshly. The heat in my head is almost unbearable. It feels like a gasket, ready to burst.
The first time I realized that Sherlock was actually becoming gaunt, and that his eating (or not eating, as the case may be) was out of control was after he had revealed to me that he had been hurt as a child.
''If you must know - yes, it's a family name, and additionally my brother chose it for me when he was a child. He undoubtedly felt adrift in a world of normal-sounding names and resolved to do something about it.''
I take everything back to the countertop, then take out a salad bowl, and pour a gigantic serving of Shreddies and Cheerios into the bowl. Top with milk. Top with 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Eat standing up. I don't even pull up a chair.
I wanted him to fear the possibility of loss. Not the loss of my love, but the loss of us. As friends or...anything at all.
"I never thought you were bad when you were a child, Sherlock," I say carefully. Feeling as if I am walking into emotional land-mine territory, and having no idea why. "Did someone say you were bad as a child?"
''So, whatever you'd like,'' she starts awkwardly, in typical Molly-fashion, but with such compassion that I look up at her and give her a slight smile.
I look at the box of the brown, large, free run, organic 12 pack in my hand and suddenly agree with Sherlock.
I can't help but wonder if he's putting his own feelings into the 'sentiment' camp. It would be an easy way of claiming an inability to discuss the matter at hand. He can't discuss emotions if he doesn't have any.
''No,'' he quickly corrects. ''I'm implying that at one time, Sherlock may have been considered for that diagnosis. Or for another condition manifesting with psychotic features. People can experience psychosis without being schizophrenic.''
''No! It's not about that!,'' Sherlock seethes, although there is something newly taut in his anger that makes me think that, yes, he's royally pissed at me for those words, too.
He was playing music, in the courtyard outside of the Sheldonian Theatre. Others were playing, too. But as I watched his hands move up and down over a violin with a sort of rapacious concentration, I fell into a trance.
And just as I know he's aware of what he did - the enormity of what he almost achieved - I also suspect that his impulsive nature scares him, still. That he's scared not only by what he almost did, but the potential of what he could still do if those feelings were ever to make a reappearance.
''Okay,'' Dr. Riley says soothingly. ''Okay, that's your call. I just thought you might want a bit of privacy, but if you wish for John to be present, we can work with that. If that's okay with John.''
After a minute or two I stop vomiting, and proceed to pant against the bucket, still holding it against my mouth with both hands. Molly, in turn, has wrapped her arms around my middle, and the thought of her touching me at all - even in kindness - makes me pull my stomach up, suck it in. The revulsion and the knowledge of what I am doing hits me, and I vomit again, this time bringing up only bile. Dry retching.
He arched his hands down, as if needing the pressure of the table top. Pressed until he left smudgy damp spots - imprints - of his palms against the Formica.
''I am always ready to go when it comes to hospitals. I hate these places. I could be half dead, and I'd hate these places.''
I feel sucker punched, and watch him for a few seconds as his fingertips ghost over the tabletop, leaving sweat marks.
''Do you honestly believe that?,'' I ask, trying to keep the incredulity out of my voice. Because - could he really believe that? Is it possible that he could really be that far in denial?
There is enough light from the hallway to clarify the objects. It's visible in here, just not bright.
I know that it was something that would make my heart slow down, and destroy my keening need to cry, and that's all that really mattered to me then. And all that really matters to me now, if I'm being honest.
Except Sherlock only sees deepness in everything else around him. He hasn't begun to look deeply at himself. He hasn't even scratched the surface of who he is and what he deserves. He can't even sense what he needs.
''Come on, come sit down,'' she says softly, and her kind tone - though not vastly different from how she normally speaks to me - makes something jolt in my chest.
Look back down to my mobile messages. From three days back. A string from John. Concerns, roundabout concerns. Wanting to ask without wanting to tell me what was happening. So typical of the soldier. Of Sherlock's loyal and true friend.
There is no way I can stay in this room with him any longer. Not for another second, never mind throughout dinner and the rest of the evening.
Tidy he is not, but he ventures around to my side and helps me put the last of the game into the box before shoving the entire thing under the coffee table. It’s not where it goes either, really, but I know better than to comment. It would fall on deaf ears. Just as would be my request that he put his socks and running kit into the laundry hamper at the end of each run and not leave it nestled between the shower and the toilet.
"You 'guess you were upset'?,'' and his voice is parsed slowly, as if he can't fathom what I've just said. ''You were upset? So you took a knife and cut your legs and-"
When I've removed the majority of glass debris and deposits from the kitchen floor, I assess the damage to my friends' limb.
But just for a second, I can see it so clearly in my mind. A razor blade, a fluorescent light growing dim in the washroom. My hand lacing around my throat, and in one swift motion, the gurgling heat of blood, and everything else coming out. Warmth, salt on the air, a bright staining red, and life. All over my throat and down the front of my pajamas. All over the floor. All down an invisible drain that leads nowhere but to sleep. Sleep, forever.
Sally turns the handle, as if to leave; I can tell that the fight is leaving her body. Her eyes are hollowed and black, too. Sherlock is not the only one who has not been sleeping recently it would seem.
I see his thin face dart around quickly, searching for something. He looks restless, and I wonder how long it will take to put him at ease. Most of my clients seem to find my mannerisms comforting enough. I am not known for being off putting or overly intrusive. I must, at times, press clients. But it's usually in a testing capacity when they resort to going silent for extended periods of time. Or in serious situations involving suicidal ideation or self-harm. Things I cannot let go unchecked.
To be fair, if the situation were reversed I doubt I'd want people knowing at all. Ever. Even my friends. Maybe even Sherlock, himself. So it'd be hypocritical of me to demand he deal with this differently. Because how he is dealing with this makes perfect sense when you look at the psychology of how victims often feel after being brutalized. Especially by a parent figure, and especially when little.
Then her arms are at my sides, holding me still. The entire Yard is staring, I am sure - and I push at her arms with my hands.
So he's likely either ashamed, or angry over being here - but not so angry that John's presence fails to provide necessary comfort.
The door clicks with the turning of a lock, and I pound at the base of the wooden frame with my foot, ignoring the sting against my toes.
I feel a weird wash of shame at my willingness to pass the blame to the only person that has really been there for Sherlock since the beginning.
The image of me, as a child, running a blade over my wrist, humming ''Mary had a Little Lamb'' while crying comes to me immediately, and I step back from the table alarmed. Stare at the pealing blood as if dribbles over my wrist. Over my radial artery.
Now, the trees held shimmering promises of green and brown. Now the trees seemed like they could be real, true lifeforms. Not merely black and white nerves, burnt-out against a faded, anemic landscape.
I have very, very sketchy net access right now and I may be in this boat for another 2 or so months. Perhaps longer. :/ I apologize. I have wanted to get some writing done for a long time now, and I hope everyone enjoys the update. It's shorter than a normal chapter, but I hope it's better than nothing. I'm currently having to write in cyber-cafes, which can be costly, so please know I will be finishing in a more timely manner as soon as I am able. Thanks, guys!
''Protective,'' my voice is speaking of its own volition now, ''And sometimes unduly affectionate towards him. Sometimes almost preoccupied with how he's doing - because he's been sick, maybe. But also, well, I'll see his face, the angles of his face in the light and I'll just feel wholly connected. Attached.''
He takes a step back, his face twisted into an expression that doesn't bely anger, nor pain. But something else.
''I want to go home, John,'' he manages to get out after a few minutes, now wiping at his eyes. ''Right now. Please.''
It's shortly after noon, on Sunday, when John Watson calls me. Soft voice, not quite a whisper - but definitely quiet. Subdued.
''Nothing,'' Sherlock says much too quickly, looking back down to the table. His brow is suddenly furrowed.
Sherlock stares at me silently. Absolute quietude. I hear him swallow. I can sense the tension in his lean shoulders, the weariness in his entire body.
''Inevitable WHAT?,'' I stress, anxiety making my voice strident. ''There are so many things about my life which would bother John, Yuri. You'll have to clarify.''
I glance at the clock. It’s edging to half-past twelve. I know John’s schedule well enough to be aware that he will be doing rounds at the clinic until nearly 4:30. And Sherlock is my only patient on Saturdays.
He's silent, and I place my hand on his leg gently, which causes him to stop his attack on the walkway.
''Your sexual orientation wouldn't change simply because of your flatmate's issues, John. You might not choose to act on your feelings - many people choose this option, for a variety of reasons. But those feelings wouldn't be completely absent. You'd know if you were sexually attracted towards Sherlock.''
I want to imagine what it could feel like to grow up from the time I am very small and to live here throughout all my early years, and to emerge from childhood without euthanasia on my mind.
''Are you even real?,'' I mutter, while the man stares back, looking more like a corpse than a man. I realize then that the man's lips are dry, so I open up the medicine cabinet and root around for some camphor salve. Finding the little red tin, I apply it over my fingertips and rub it over my lips.
"I only remember bits and pieces. I don't remember actually, well - I don't remember anybody doing anything to me. I just remember mostly the after. The breathing. My crying. Pain. Not being real."
I turn abruptly to head up the stairs so that I can give Sherlock a bit of space, only to see Mrs. Hudson on the landing, one step down. She seems to be wavering with indecision about whether or not she should leave, or if she should stay and talk to me.
