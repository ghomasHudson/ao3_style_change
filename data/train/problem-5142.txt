“No, Tony. You can’t live on coffee non-stop,” he heard Steve reprimand him. “How long has it been since you ate something healthy?”
“Why? Does that bother you?” Thor asked taken aback, looking at him already getting on the defensive.
“You have to believe me, I didn’t know what was going to happen. Up to that point, I didn’t know the song, I don’t even know where Natasha found it. I mean, I suspected she had noticed something, but I never thought she would have done something about it.”
,” he added, trying to restrain his smile when Tony playfully wiggled his eyebrow. “Before,” he repeated, “I thought it all felt natural, that coming to bed with you was the right thing to do. And then I realised that we’ve been doing this for a while and that there’s no one else I would rather come home to.”
The living room was empty except for Tony who entered stealthily with his arms full of bags and boxes. He placed them all under the tree until only a squared package was left. Looking at it, he took a deep breath and stroked it gently with a calm and relaxed expression you could not easily find on him, before putting it with the other presents and go straight towards the elevator.
At first, he thought he’d stop there, but then words just came, and he just poured them, suddenly feeling the urge to say them just this once to the man he was in love with. “I’ve loved you for months now, I don’t even know when it all began, but I do. You’re kind, you’re compassionate, you’re incredibly smart, you make me feel part of something, something good, something that is worth, and you’re an arse, you’re self-absorbed, legitimately so even if sometimes you behave like a prick, and I love it all. I just love all of you.”
“So? Steve made more pancakes,” said Clint. “I remember well that morning because you told me to shut up and just eat when I asked if there were any. In fact, then I stole a couple from Tony’s plate.”
The words weren’t on the screen anymore. The room was silent. And again, no one dared to say a word. No one dared to look at someone else.
During the instrumental part, Steve and Tony didn’t move at all, being careful of keeping their eyes fixed on the screen. They didn’t know it, but both were thinking whether it was worse to serenade to the love of your life, who clearly, obviously, categorically didn’t love you back or if the worst part was yet to come. They both yearned for the song to be over and at the same time feared that moment.
“Me and Nat?” Clint pointed back and forth at themselves, surprised. “We already have a golden couple in the team, no need to fake one,” he said carelessly.
She was always the first one to finish but today she was late because she wasted time looking for the blue scrunchie she was adamant to use. So, when she entered the living room she was a little taken aback by the scene in front of her.
He made a sandwich, poured a cup of coffee with no milk and little sugar, just how Tony liked it, put everything on a tray and entered the lift.
The battle with the villain du jour – some repressed guy with a brain and reasonable ability, whose life had been a sequence of injustice, come back to take his revenge yadda yadda -  had been long and exhausting. Seriously, it took all six of them to take him down, and even then they managed to catch him only because by some miracle he landed exactly between the Hulk and Thor.
Shy, awkward, gentle Steve, with a young face but old eyes that made you easily forget he was only 25. A strong man with a strong temper and soft hands that were able to bake, to draw, to play.
,” moaned Tony. “If I hear another whoo-whoo-whoo I’ll scream,” he sighed theatrically, hiding his head in Steve’s shoulder.
“Who, me?” Clint snorted. “Not a chance. It’s just that when I finally realised it, I also figured out that they’re together for a long time now,” he explained. “And I really cannot fathom how could I have missed it!”
So, Thor sparred with Steve anytime he realised was holding back during a training session because he didn’t want to harm anyone but needed to blow off steam. He always chose old cult movies during movie night because he knew Steve wanted to watch them but didn’t want to impose on the others. With the excuse of discovering the many beauties of America, he dragged him around the country, and often this trip became little vacations for all the team.
“Wait a minute,” he said straightening up and looking at the ceiling - he never talked to Jarvis like that before Steve, it was outrageous that he out of all people picked up the habit. “You said that no one apart the Avengers is going to see the footage. They’re spying on us, aren’t they?”
“I’ve been told,” Bruce replied with a smirk. “So, what do you want to talk about? And please,” he added when Tony opened his mouth. “Don’t beat around the bush. Whatever it is, I won’t judge.”
He knew how it was to be in a foreign environment, but he didn’t imagine how hard it could be to feel a stranger in your home. Thor just wanted to be sure that Steve didn’t feel lonely.
The blinds slowly closed, and the lights dimmed. In the half-shadowed kitchen appeared a hologram and after a few moments of silence, a video taken from the security footage of the tower began.
“Why- Um. Do you remember when Clint thought Tony and I were a pair?” he asked looking at her a little awkward but otherwise calm.
She studied him for a moment, her face unreadable as always. He could never have said what she was thinking, and it was both amazing and distressing.
Steve looked at him and suddenly burst out laughing, leaving Tony puzzled for a moment. “This-,” he gasped. “This means there’s totally a betting pool on us.”
After a mission, Natasha liked to pamper herself using the coconut shower gel Clint gave her for Christmas and braiding her hair loosely so that the next day it would be naturally wavy.
After Clint’s faux pas, things went on smoothly as always. No one talked about Steve and Tony just like before. It was their own business after all, and as long as they were happy the team was happy too.
“Alright, boys,” she said a couple of days later during breakfast when it was only her, Clint, and Bruce. She had specifically waited for a moment in which both the lovebirds wouldn’t be there, and finally this morning Tony was still buried in his lab and Steve was already out for his morning run. “Who noticed
Tony burst out laughing, he stood up and took Steve’s hand in his, dragging him on the open space between the island and the countertop and starting to sway in place at the first notes of I Got You Babe (bless Jarvis for starting the song without needing to be told).
“That’s beside the point,” Tony brushed off easily, making Steve smile a little. “She kidnapped me, I tell you! To add insult to injury, I only drank a cup of coffee. Only one, Steve!” he exclaimed. “And just because Happy bought it when he picked me up.”
“I think someone here had too much beer. Time to go to bed, boys,” she said cryptically, putting an end at the evening.
Tony was so drowsy that he didn’t even say the usual ‘traitor’ that shot back every time Jarvis teamed up with someone. Especially when said someone was Steve.
Months went by as always: some battles, some injuries, some arguing, a lot of movie nights, pizza, and love. After so much time spent trying to settle down, they all began to believe that maybe they finally found a place to call home. All was well.
“I don’t usually speak for the others but let me do it just this time. If you think you can do whatever you please, ripping us apart and play with us as if we were nothing more than pawns, then you don’t know shit,” he spat. And with that he left the office, leaving behind a taken aback Fury.
They had to wait three more days to find another moment for themselves where Tony and Steve wouldn’t be within earshot. In the meantime, now that they knew, Steve and Tony’s pine seemed impossible not to notice, so much so that one time Natasha had to kick Clint’s shin under the table to prevent him to laugh out loud.
“I know you’re never wrong but…” he went on. After seeing her expression, though, he gave up. “I know, you’re never wrong. Go on.”
“WHAT?!” he squawked, spitting cereals all over the kitchen countertop and straightening up so fast that he fell off the stool with a loud thud.
“You were talking about the fact that Natasha probably discovered you’re in love with me, tried to make you confess and you didn’t want to, but then you thought I understood and I was angry at you, isn’t it?” Tony asked abruptly.
“Chop, chop guys,” Nat interrupted them. “We’ve got no time to spare. Jarvis, show them the next one, please.”
At that moment, though, Steve entered the room with his t-shirt clinging to his sweaty chest and his hair rumpled by the run.
“I’M MR ROGERS’ FAMILY!” Tony suddenly roared, his face red with rage. His voice thundered in the hallway and everyone fell silent, looking at him with wide eyes. “Don’t you dare say otherwise,” he growled with a cold low voice. “And now take me to him.”
Even so, it was uncommon to find Bruce up late. Circumstances permitting, he always tried to get up early and to go to bed by midnight. He found out that a routine helped him to handle the Hulk and even the Big Guy - however dynamic - was happier if he could have his beauty sleep.
Natasha stared at him for a while, then placed the book on the small table, pulled her legs towards her to make him room and patted the spot beside her. A little more decidedly, he sat down. Then, she waited.
Maybe it was because of the Tesseract, maybe it wasn’t, but even when everybody thought that the Avengers project was a pipe dream, Clint never had a doubt.
“Why didn’t you back me up?” Clint asked offended when he was sure they wouldn’t hear them. “Now they will think you all hate them!”
“Why? I mean- Even if Clint was the only one to speak at that time, I realised that you – all of you – thought that we were together, too. So I was wondering what made you think that,” he explained, sincerely curious.
“Yeah, thanks, J,” Tony barged in. “I’m not joking, by the way, I’ve never been so serious in all my life,” he said firmly to Steve. “So… what do you want to do about it?” asked a little shyly. “I am not exactly good at the all relationship thing.”
Steve and Tony were sitting on their loveseat (the one that overtime for one reason or another had become theirs, however) and that was fairly normal.
Tony and Steve managed to avoid each other for the next three days. Actually, it wasn’t that difficult. Tony locked himself in his workshop, knowing that sooner or later they needed to talk, but trying not to think about it, and Steve kept a strictly normal routine, counting on Jarvis to let Tony know when he was around.
It was one of those rare quiet afternoons in which by some miracle no villain had the heart to attack the city, maybe because of the sudden burst of heat that hit a couple of days before. Normally, they kept doing what they had to, but in companionable silence or a soft buzzing.
She eyed him nonplussed, crossing her harms. “Please. Who do you think ordered all our presents from Tony?”
“I’m a genius, duh,” he retorted on autopilot. When Steve swatted weakly his shoulder, he sniggered and then replied seriously. “I’ve been thinking about it, too.”
Tony looked at him flabbergasted and after a moment hugged him from behind, placing his chin on his shoulder. More minutes passed in silence until Steve said, “I’m not heartbroken anymore, but it always upsets me when I have this dream. It’s just… It’s been an emotional moment and it’s not an easy one to re-experience.”
Steve looked at him confused. “Forgive you? Tony, what are you talking about? I could never despise you, ever,” he said, shaking feebly his head. “I know it’s not your fault. On the contrary, I should be the one to apologize. I know we’re friends now, but it’s not fair to ask you something like that. I didn’t want you to find out like this. I thought Natasha might have realized it too, but I didn’t want to do anything because it’s something that is just not possible,” he said the last bit bowing his head.
It was clear that there were few left-overs, not enough to feed a grown man who probably came from a three-day session in the lab. But before anyone could say a word, Steve was already up saying: “I was just about to do more pancakes, do you want some?”
When he raised his head towards the clock and saw it was already past 3 in the morning, he decided to take a cup of tea before going to bed and that for once he could sleep in.
“Morning,” he mumbled. They knew he wasn’t very talkative when he just got up, so Steve didn’t mind.
The only source of light was a small spotlight underneath the kitchen hood that cast a warm glow and soft shadows all around and wrapped everything in a bubble frozen in time.
“The usual. I’m on a train with Bucky and just when I think this time I will save him, he falls,” he says with a dull voice. “All of a sudden, I’m on the plane, sitting on that bloody uncomfortable leather seat and I’m talking to Peggie. And then… the usual, I told you,” he sighed again.
Despite not being Midgardian, Thor felt a strong connection with this world and its inhabitants. The first time he set foot on Earth, he didn’t think that he would’ve found such great companions, but after the battle of New York, he was happy to say he did.
At first, he didn’t understand why the Captain seemed so out of his element. From what he’d heard, he was a hero, a legend even. So how could he be so uncomfortable and out of touch in his own home?
It all began one day when Natasha walked in on them sitting on the couch after a particularly harsh mission.
“Well, now it seems clear that they’re really in love with each other,” Bruce said. “What are we going to do?” he asked, speaking to Natasha.
Like little soldiers, they all stood up and tidied the room, cleaning up for good no matter how many people would’ve come the next day for this specific reason. After that, they all bade goodnight.
“The door,” Bruce pointed out, raising his voice a little and watching Tony manage a last-minute veer off and leave with his head in the clouds. Then, he shook his head with a smirk and shut down the lab. For today he worked enough.
“What?” Tony asked laughing. “I mean no offence,” he said looking again towards Steve, “We all know you’re the peak of human perfection but-” and then he started laughing again.
Bruce knew far too well that tone. When Tony combined nicknames, tea and coffee and a fake, detached smile it could only mean that he wanted to talk about feelings. Heaving a deep sigh, even if the other man hadn’t spoken yet, he surrendered to the difficult talk he was about to go through.
He shut down the lab and took the lift to the common floor. Everyone had their own suites, but they took the habit of staying mostly together especially at breakfast and dinner, so pretty much everything to eat or drink was stored there.
“You’re my friend, Tony,” Steve said losing himself in his eyes. “I think I proved that in the last few years. And I never had–” he faltered a little but then went on. “I’ve never been with someone, but… Lately, I’ve been thinking and before, when we were coming to bed –
He was ready to internally rant about his (apparently) lacking visual skills when he realized he’d never seen Tony so relaxed and at ease and Steve’s smile so tender, and he suddenly calmed down.
Steve stood up and went to the fridge to take more orange juice since Thor had finished it. At that moment Tony entered the room with a sleepy face, his eyes still half-closed and his hair ruffled. As soon as Steve saw him, he took his favourite mug and filled it with hot coffee, placing it carefully in Tony’s hands and letting go only when he was sure Tony was holding it. Then Steve took the juice and sat again at his place.
“No, they aren’t. Didn’t you see? Tony was too relaxed and even if Steve blushed a little he was absolutely honest. And we all know he’s shit at lying,” she remarked.
“If it were for anyone else, I would suggest to let them spent some time together, maybe after a mission abroad where they would be forced to wait for the AvenJet,” Natasha said.
“I heard you,” he said in a thin voice. Tony looked at him disoriented but before he could ask something, Steve went on. “This time, before the impact I heard your voice. When-” he cleared his throat, trying to sound more confident. “When I asked you- When I asked Peggie to post-pone our date, she told me she would’ve waited for me the following Saturday at 8 o’clock but- but I still didn’t know how to dance. And then I heard you say, ‘I’ll show you how, just be there’, just like she did,” he explained absentmindedly caressing Tony’s knuckles with his thumb.
Bruce stood there, looking from a distance who now recognized to be Steve and Tony. Something must’ve happened because they were silent. Steve was sitting on a stool with his elbows on the countertop and his head bowed, while Tony was warming up something in a small pot.
It was only when Steve and Tony stood on the opposite sides of the bed in Tony’s room, already in sleepwear and with the covers pulled aside that they realised they went in the same room on autopilot like it was the most natural thing to do. Like it was the right thing to do.
“Well…” repeated Tony a little less bold, remembering what he just said. “How do you want me, Cap? You feel more comfortable with Cotton eye Joe or The house of the rising sun?” he said half-heartedly with a smile. But those who knew him could see he was a little nervous.
“But,” she continued ignoring him, “since they’re not anyone else, I think we can rule the option out. There had been plenty of missions overseas in the last six months and nothing happened. I bet they just spent every night moping for not being able to sleep in the same bed,” Natasha said almost distasteful.
“What you are looking at, is Tony caressing his present for Steve with doe eyes,” replied her. “And now tell me that this behaviour is on character,” added with a daring tone.
“How could you n- Ow!” Clint yelled, spinning his head towards Natasha, and squeezing the shin she just kicked. “What was that for?!” he asked indignantly with a high pitch.
“I arrived about an hour ago,” she answered. Then, seeing that he stood there, seemingly hesitant and waiting for something, she added, “Do you want to talk?”
Bruce kept quiet a little taken aback. It had been months by now. An answer was due, though, especially since Tony stood there uncharacteristically honest.
After a couple of minutes, Tony took the pan and poured some milk in a mug, added a dash of cinnamon and a teaspoon of honey, and put it in front of Steve placing a comforting hand between his shoulder blades.
He respected him, he didn’t question his capability as a soldier or a leader, because it was obvious he was of high-value. Technically speaking, on the battlefield the Captain was perfect. But then, when all was said and done, the Captain took off his cowl and what remained was Steve.
,” he punctuated, pointing his finger towards the corridor where the patients’ rooms were, “Is my mate and I will not leave until I see him with my own eyes!”
So, despite what the vast majority of fanfiction claimed, he was not some dull buffoon with a peculiar obsession for the ventilation system, on the contrary, he was always the first to notice something. It gave him a sensation of control, he felt safe. It didn’t matter if it was something strange, something trivial or something bad. He just noticed.
“Come here,” Steve said. And just when Clint was going to walk into the kitchen, he saw Steve picking up Tony bridal style and put him down on a stool. “If I leave you now, will you fall off?” he asked with a smile, placing a hand on his shoulder.
Evidently, villains really hated extreme temperature swings, because now that it was nearly Christmas none of them seemed interested so much in taking over the world.
The unusual thing that made her come suddenly to a halt was that Steve was sitting cross-legged with Tony between his legs, his back facing Steve’s chest, his hands resting gently on the soldier’s knees and his feet dangling a few inches from the ground. His eyes were closed in a blissful expression and his head was tilted back while Steve dried off his dump hair with a towel.
After all, of all the things he could’ve missed, he didn’t mind that it was something this good. He was just happy it happened.
“Jarvis!” Clint exclaimed. “By the way, aren’t you breaking some sort of NDA?” he asked, eyeing the ceiling.
“You never had a relationship, Steve, but I never had a conventional one. The only person I’ve truly been with it’s Pepper and we were boss and employee, we knew each other basically by force of circumstances,” he explained. “Maybe–” he said, looking at Steve dead in the eye. “Maybe that’s why it took me so long,” he heaved a deep sigh.
They stood there for a moment, a bit unsure of what to do and then smiled, huffing a small laugh, and lied in bed side by side. They couldn’t pinpoint when sleeping together had become a habit but was it really so wrong?
“Hey, Nat,” Steve called her from the door. “I didn’t know you were already home,” he said moving closer.
“Ah, my hero!” exclaimed Tony with a stage gasp. “Those are my favourites, how could I refuse?” said with a small smile while Steve’s ears flushed red.
“Don’t play coy with me, sunshine! They sneaked into the control room and you let them see!” Tony exclaimed.
“Well, since I value my family jewels I think I will sing,” he said with a smile, standing up and taking a microphone.
“It is probably true that Sir wouldn’t be too pleased if he were to know of the existence of this video, yet technically none of this material had been restricted to any of you, so I’m just… supporting the project,” the AI answered far too smug for an artificial voice.
“You didn’t,” she pointed out. “What about you, Bruce? Make me proud,” she said the other man, who was sipping his tea before heading down to the lab like every morning. No coffee for him, but he still needed the energy boost.
“Like I had a choice with you,” Steve said still a little misty-eyed but with a small private smile.
“Basically, you spin the bottle and the two people that are drawn have to either sing a song together or kiss,” she replied smugly. “Since you all complained of me never singing, I will open the dances. The next one chosen by the bottle has to decide his fate,” she explained a little too menacingly.
“Yes… All things considered, after such a blow we have to wait for things to settle a little,” Bruce agreed.
What a surprise. As if she didn’t practice all week to train her arm with the right amount of strength required to land the bottle where she wanted.
Later on, Clint and Bruce had told him his story and he finally knew why the Captain stood out like a sore thumb.
Since the battle of New York, it was a tradition for the Avengers to come home, take a hot shower and gather on the communal floor to spend the rest of the day together.
New Year’s Eve, Easter and Memorial Day have come and gone, and now summer was just around the corner. Natasha sat on the couch, her legs stretched on the cushion beside her and a massive book written in Russian on her lap. She just came back from a mission and after a shower, she was planning to spend the afternoon loafing about since dinner.
“You seemed comfortable with one another, you took care of each other and talked a lot. You were spontaneous,” he answered. “You still are,” he pointed out.
He knew that, on an ordinary day, if he’d gone in the kitchen at 7:30 in the morning - like he was doing that day - he would’ve seen Steve newly showered after his morning run already cooking, he knew that Bruce would’ve had his tea and by now was probably in his lab, that Tony might have been in there too after pulling an all-nighter in the workshop and he knew with absolute certainty that Thor and Natasha wouldn’t appear before 9 a.m.
How could this bloody song be so specific?! Was a song at all or was it an invention of Natasha who, he suspected, had guessed what was in his mind for a long time?
“Oh, look at that. It’s already midnight,” said Tony, checking his non-existing watch. Well, you know how they say, time for a princess to come home,” Tony said on autopilot. “Besides, I believe the specs for that project I was working on before should be ready now, isn’t it J?” asked at the ceiling, already heading towards the lift.
Natasha wasn’t exactly surprised, she could sense their sexual tension from miles away. What amazed her was the straightforwardness of the scene before her eyes. It was probably the first time she saw them so natural, so effortlessly domestic with each other.
“Thank you, Miss Tasha. Good morning Master Banner, Master Barton,” the disembodied voice greeted them with the thick British accent. “I suggest we hurry up if we don’t want Captain Rogers to witness our… display of evidence.”
“It could work…” Clint murmured. After a moment of silence lost in their thoughts, they agreed. “Well, now we just have to pick the song.”
“Of course, thanks, J,” Nat replied ignoring the archer. “If we want it to work we better get started.”
“Tony has his flaws, like each one of us. But he’s also funny, caring, he’s smart as hell but at the same time so approachable that it’s a wonder when you understand who the real Tony is,” he went on vehemently. “During the last year, he’s been so kind, so patient to me. He gave me the chance and the strength to truly live in this century. Now I’m
The first notes of Little Talks blared in the room and everyone started dancing with their arms in the air and swaying their hips following the rhythm of the song while Nat and Bruce sang a line each.
The soft sound of a piano and violins filled the air. Tony and Steve briefly looked at each other puzzled. That didn’t seem exactly the typical song to sing on karaoke. But then again the playlist was filled with cheesy songs, so that one may be one of them. Just chance, really. Well, chance and Natasha.
“Geez, you’re so distrustful,” huffed Natasha. “Fine. Jarvis, show them the last one, please,” said looking briefly at the ceiling.
“You’re serious? There aren’t video cameras scattered around the floor and a crew ready to shoot my debacle, right?” asked only half-jokingly.
“Not as you are with Tony,” she said. “Neither physically nor platonically,” she added prodding him a little.
They stayed there, eyes fixed on the ceiling, looking at the lights that came in from the window wall, basking in the quiet atmosphere of the room that sort of lulled them.
“I know you could never feel the same as I do and I’m so sorry for what happened the other day,” Steve said.
This footage was dated a couple of months after the first one. It must’ve been near Christmas since the tree was in the middle of the living room and there were plenty of decorations on the walls. That day it wasn’t raining but the sky was full of grey clouds, a warning sign of a snowstorm.
“No, that’s true. Considering Tony, it’s a little strange,” agreed Bruce. “But how can you be so sure that it was Steve’s one?”
Tony and Steve exchanged a confused glance and then burst out laughing. At that, even the others, who were paying little attention at the discussion, turned towards them.
“Yeah mate,” backed up Clint, finally standing up. “How can Tony and Steve possibly pine for each other? It’s like… like… I don’t know, it’s so absurd that I can’t come up with anything just as much ridiculous.”
Tony snorted. “Affairs? Yeah, I had them. I don’t know when it stopped, though. Not the exact moment, at least,” he added as an afterthought.
“Brucieee, Bruce, Bruciebear,” Tony entered the lab with a mug in each hand and a press-smile plastered on his face.
“Uh,” he said after a while. “Alright,” he stood up, smiling at her. “Thanks for the talk, I missed you.”
“Well, it’s been a long day,” said Steve after some moments, without looking at them in the eyes. “I had fun,” murmured with a smile that didn’t really reach his eyes. “Goodnight.”
“How long is it since you dated someone?” he asked with a soft voice. Maybe it was the dim light in the room, the late hour, or the fact that they were so close, but it seemed right.
“Absolutely,” smiled back Tony. He could always worry later, now it was an entirely too much perfect moment to care.
“Well…” he delayed. “Tony’s been a little strange, recently,” he answered after a brief pause, while Clint was still coughing on the floor. “He was in that particular mood – when he’s halfway between a schoolgirl dealing with her first crush and a grumpy depressed octogenarian – and I thought it had something to do with Pepper, since he behaved like that only with her, but I realized it was not the case. Then it slipped my mind but- Steve? You think he’s like this for Steve?” he asked a little sceptical.
“That your goal today was to lose your team,” Steve replied coldly. Fury didn’t react. “Maybe you’re right,” he continued. “At first, Tony didn’t want to be in the Avengers. Hell, probably none of us did. We were strangers, we didn’t trust each other, we were nothing. But that’s your mistake – this is the past. We’re no longer just teammates. We’re not even friends. We are family,” he said in a dead-serious tone.
And since it was almost Christmas, soon the Maria Stark Foundation would have hosted his annual charity gala.
Since no one had a real family to come back to, they decided to spend the day together and even if they told “no presents”, the tree began to host more and more packages until it became a giant Secret Santa free-for-all.
He stared at the nurse dead in the eye until she pulled a deep sigh and led the way to Steve’s room.
It goes without saying that as soon as they arrived at the Avengers Tower they headed towards their suites, and no one cared to stop Tony when he asked Jarvis if he could order pizza for everybody.
Probably due to his exhaustion, he didn’t notice immediately, but at a certain point, he saw that Steve and Tony were sitting together.
For a moment no one said anything then, carefully placing a knife beside her, Natasha said, “You know, too. Don’t you?”
“Alright, bye,” Steve greeted them, going towards the elevator where Tony was already waiting for him.
Steve swayed in place tasting the waters, with a smirk on his face and sparkly eyes fixed on Tony, unknowingly observed by the others.
Steve was too judgemental, Tony was too proud, Natasha was too harsh, Bruce was too reclusive, Thor was too condescending, and Clint was too distressed to think straight.
On the black screen appeared red and blue lines that matched the colour of their microphones to help them understand who had to sing which line. The first one was blue, so when the words lit up, Steve started singing.
Steve froze, his eyes growing comically, and before he even thought of reciprocating, Tony pulled away.
“Well, Captain,” inquired Jarvis. “There’s always me, but no one apart the Avengers is going to see this footage,” assured him.
“I– I don’t know. I didn’t notice,” he said lost in his thoughts. “Do I really act differently with him?” he asked, looking at her a little bewildered.
“Come on, Cap. You don’t have to be shy!” Clint tried to reassure him. “We’ve known since forever and if it’s not clear, we support you,” he highlighted for the sake of it. “If you don’t want to come out yet we understand you, but there’s no need to fake it in front of us.”
“I don’t give a fuck!” Tony screamed at the top of his lungs in the middle of the waiting room, throwing his arms upwards. “I don’t care about the hospital policy!
Bruce saw Steve laughing out loud while Tony led him around the kitchen, not really dancing but nevertheless moving to the rhythm.
Tony had stripped off of his armour and now was in his undersuit, his head leaning against the headrest, his mouth a little open, and a lap full of Steve. Steve had removed just his cowl and now his dump blonde hair was shooting in all directions, also thanks to Tony’s fingers intertwined in his locks, that were massaging his scalp.
Tony didn’t answer and Bruce thought that he might hide but eventually, he spoke. “It’s just that– At first I didn’t think much of it, Clint’s always been a prankster. But then I realised that maybe you agreed with him and… I don’t know, I just wanted to know why.”
“It’s settled then,” smiled Steve. “I want it too, I’ve wanted for long. I say we at least try. You onboard with the idea?”
“Pepper woke me up at 6 in the morning. She barely left me time to prepare and dragged me at SI for a multitude of meetings that ended only half an hour ago,” he complained.
Bruce, on the other hand, was smoking weed slouched on the couch with a dopey smile (namely literally the only way the Hulk could endure a karaoke night – Bruce was well aware of it when he proposed it but even the Hulk couldn’t put up with all the pining Tony and Steve had for each other and he was so tired of it that if this meant he wouldn’t be forced to see them with doe eyes every other then, he could be a good boy on karaoke night).
Natasha leaned against the recliner, drinking vodka directly from the bottle as if it were water, Tony was dancing and occasionally altered it with a dreamy voice while he remembered the “good old times of MIT! You can’t even imagine how much Robbie Williams helped Rhodey and me hooking up”, even if not a minute earlier he said that ‘Robbie Williams was sooo boring’.
Natasha and Clint came almost at the same moment. She sat on the rug displaying her collection of knives all around her and began to polish them neatly. Instead, Clint slouched on the big couch with his ankles propped on the small table drinking what was probably the most sugary cup of coffee, with little coffee and a lot of whipped cream, that he could find at the café across the street.
Steve let him finish - just to be sure it was all true - then moved closer, placing his hand on Tony’s cheek, and stroking it lightly. He looked at him with dreamy eyes savouring the moment, just because he felt he could, then leaned down and kissed him softly on his lips.
When the song finished Nat exchanged a glance with Clint and Bruce, hoping they would be enough in themselves for understand and said, “Alright boys, time to liven up the night.”
In a couple of minutes, they found themselves crouched again on the carpet or sitting on the sofa, watching the bottle spin among them, and waiting to see who would be chosen for the next round.
“What do you mean ‘who it is’?” Clint was befuddled. “It’s you and Steve,” answered as if it was obvious.
On one hand, Steve was grateful that she was like this, that she was a good listener and didn’t rush you into something. On the other hand, he almost wanted her to speak because he really didn’t know how to phrase what he wanted to say.
When the lift door opened, however, he immediately sensed he was not alone. He waited for his eyes to adjust to the darkness and when he finally could see a little better he noticed two people at the kitchen island.
think about how Tony and Steve were close. Especially Clint refused to think that he was wrong. It took him time to understand that there was something between them, now that he saw it, he wasn’t willing to let it go. Evidently, he didn’t say a word to the happy not-couple, he knew that such a thing would’ve split them, but it didn’t mean that they forgot.
“Of course I knew, Steve. I’m a genius,” he said with a small smile. “But I never would’ve acted on it, ever. I can only imagine how much difficult it is for you. I know you probably despise me now and that’s why I didn’t want to say anything. The last thing I want is to make you uncomfortable because of me. Say we can go back as we were before. Say you can forgive me,” almost plead Tony looking at him dead in the eye.
“Whatever it is, it’s good for you. The both of you,” she told him, picking up her book and finally settling to read it.
In the afternoon of the fourth day, when the team just finished lunch Steve decided the time had come.
A project in the lab had kept him busy more than he thought initially, and he had lost track of time.
God, surely Tony understood Steve had feelings for him and now hated him. Sure, they had a good relationship but just because they were friends - and above all had boundaries, Steve – it didn’t mean that they could be more. Even so, he knew he had to talk to Tony, for the sake of the team if not for anything else.
“Steve,” Tony murmured, placing his hand on his cheek, and stroking it lightly. “Do you want to – apparently – keep on staying with me?”
After a little pause, he went on. “I’m happy, you know?” he said, raising his head and looking at Tony. “In the last few days I thought you didn’t want to talk to me anymore, I thought you were angry and that our friendship was over. But when you said you wanted to go back as we were before… I felt so happy. I was so relieved you wanted me, even if just as a friend,” he said smiling at him.
Tony unzipped his large black and white duffel bag and fiddled with what sounded like a machine without taking it out of the bag.  Colored lights played along his forearms briefly.  Then he shut the device off, and zipped the bag shut.
Peter had gravitated over to the group by now, and for once it was Harry who hung back a step, resisting the urge to still his hands by shoving them deep in his pockets of his cords.
“No, not since last Friday.  I didn’t follow him then because I had Harry with me, and it’s not like this guy’s
Instead he turned in midair, leaning sideways casually until the cushion of compressed air slipped out from beneath his boots and he began to fell Earthwards, accelerating horribly fast.  He began to feel lightheaded again, and shut off the flow of extra oxygen to the tube in his helmet.  Tony broke mach two as he dived, arms stiff and streamlined at his sides. He watched New York resolve itself out into rivers and land, neighborhoods, individual blocks like tiny squares on a circuit board…
“Well, actually all you need is a compressed gas cylinder,” Tony explained, “-a can of PAM or hairspray would work too.”
War Machine unfolded himself after a long moment, standing tall above the railing of the roof, then jumped clean over it into the deep gulf of air below, no jets.  He fired them barely thirty stories from the ground, caught himself, and cruised away unobtrusively in the direction his shoulder-weapon had tracked earlier.  War Machine -had- the Avengers’ communication frequencies already, and even if he couldn’t decode Tony and Peter’s private channel, it would probably get his attention.
“Go ahead then,” Steve agreed, “-debriefing is at ten-hundred tomorrow at the tower unless I call you.”
Tony got up, and paced around the garage floor backwards and forwards for a moment, eyes fixed on the screen of the gray scanner in his outstretched hand, as if he was dancing with it.  Forward… back… over… …-there-.
It was his signet ring, the one he’d inherited from his father.  Gold with a dark red stone, and the capitol letter ‘S’.
The look he got when he tried to explain the physics of a Roman Legionnaire’s armor, or simple astronavigation, or-
“I tried to keep you out of it, but… you’re kind of a hero yourself,” Peter shrugged, uncomfortably.
“Yeah, that’s…”  Peter broke off and sighed, taking up one of Harry’s long-fingered hands and squeezing it.  He wasn’t really sure what to -do- with the hand afterwards, so he put it down and took a step back.   “-Just… sort yourself out and meet me in the quad for lunch, all right?”
Tony smiled then.  It started slow and devious at either corner of his mustache, and spread into a look of such smug complacency that Peter actually retreated up his web line about half a foot.
Dr. Strange from a slight down-angle, caught with one hand gripping the edge of his high-collared cloak, his serious expression and the frost caught in his dark hair making him seem far older.
“Two more of the Goblin’s gliders, and… part of a machine we don’t understand at all.  We’re also standing on a
Norman was -still- talking confidentially to a rather uncomfortable Peter, one arm around the boy’s shoulders as if Harry and Tony
Small metallic clicks.  The soft creak of a chair as the person sitting leaned forwards.  A muttered curse.  Something hard and plastic being set down on a wooden desk.  …More clicks.
Tony’s eyes caught Steve’s glance, and held it fast.  Tony was fascinated.  Horrified.  Riveted.  No longer altogether sane, but watching Steve’s explorations of his person as if he couldn’t quite believe what his eyes were seeing.
“It’s very important to practice resisting interrogations, Captain Stark,” Steve pointed out, virtuously.
Tony broke momentarily into a cold sweat, took his cup of coffee from under the spout, and walked away as unobtrusively as possible.
“Where are they-” Peter peered out towards the lights of the bridge, and spotted movement, “-ah, there, right.  See ya-” -Thwip!-
He squared his shoulders and walked out onto the uneven ground where the Iron Horse Garage used to stand.  Near the center there was a fused patch of gritty glass, worn almost clean by the wind and cold spring rain.  Tony stopped in the middle of it, and in a single motion, dropped his right knee and shattered the ground with his fist in a glittering explosion.
Tony snorted, but smiled, looking back down at his scanner.  Something wasn’t adding up.  He had isolated the bug on the bike and filtered that frequency out, but the scanner was still picking up a signal from somewhe-
“Thank you, Tony,” Steve said, in a tone that was just a shade too sincere for a man simply talking to his mechanic.
“-So I was thinking of doing my history paper on the biker gangs of the fifties- you know, because we’ve got some customers who were around for that, and we could ask to them-”  Peter began, without preamble.
“Mostly it’s Reed alternately bragging and geeking out about the fact that he can travel to alternate realities,” Tony began derisively, “-but it’s
She was a contradiction, a bright flower in the middle of a film noire, shedding gloves and a long lavender scarf onto a nearby chair as she went.
Tony squinted against the too-bright kitchen lights overhead.  It was a modern room, with a long white sweep of contoured cabinets, a steel-topped kitchen island, and an espresso machine.  Jan had gotten tired of the 1960’s primary colors thing, apparently…
“You scared the hell out of me,” Steve said simply, and pulled him into a hug.  “-When you didn’t answer your radio- …I thought you were dead.”
“Oh yeah, you’ve got that new Avenger induction ceremony…  How did War Machine get picked for that, anyway?”  Peter asked curiously, beginning to peel and eat the banana he’d grabbed earlier.
A thought struck Spider Man, and he snagged one of the scattering blue barrels with a web-line.  He swung it wide, aiming towards but not -at- his opponent.  Whirlwind took the bait, and spun easily out of range… right into Spider Man’s second web line.  The crook rolled up the line fast-
“You got them?”  Tony asked, getting up quickly.  He was unshaven, and wearing the same green fatigue pants and oatmeal-colored thermal shirt he’d had on the day before.
“Oh-!”  Tony saw his helmet, and the tension in his face melted into a grateful smile, “-you found it- -that’s
Harry was alive, but Harry was -only- alive due to an extraordinary combination of luck and coordination by both War Machine and Tony, apparently completely unscripted.
Consciously, he evened out his breathing and just -felt- what Steve was doing to him, holding onto the cadence of his breath, and nothing else.  Damn… he was close already, but-
“If it weren’t for that day - the worst day of your life, it seems - I wouldn’t have met you.” Tony‘s jaw tightens, his words so sincere they make Steve look up and meet his gaze.
Her response is a gif from the Price is Right telling a contestant to ‘come on down’, which honestly makes him even more nervous than he was before.
“I am thankful every single day for you, Steve. This team would not even exist without you. I wanted to do something to celebrate that. To celebrate you… coming into my life.” He smiles, but Steve can tell it’s forced - hiding something - and for an instant there’s hope sparking deep inside of Steve that he hasn’t felt in a long time.
“No, Tony. Wait.” Steve says, walking over to him - closing the distance between them a bit. He takes another deep breath, and swallows before he can talk again - but at least Tony doesn’t say anything, giving him a chance to get his words together.
Tony seems to buy his reaction, since he puts an arm around Steve’s shoulders - as best he can anyway - and turns him towards the rest of the party.
He stands there for what must be almost a full minute, silent and trying to think straight - and Tony is silent, thankfully. He’s suddenly so tired.
Eventually Tony takes a few steps forward, closing the distance between them even more now - and reaches over to put a hand on Steve’s shoulder.
He makes his way across the street - looking both ways first - and she’s rolling her eyes at him as he gets to her.
The idea of Tony ‘working on something for him’ makes his feet go slightly numb, as that could mean literally anything, but he gets up and is outside in exactly eight minutes and 45 seconds - spotting Natasha across the way on a bench with a foil package in her hand along with a cup of coffee.
What if some busy little muck-raking weasel dug up the fact that Peter was roommates with Norman Osborne’s
“No, I- -not yet.  I want to, uh…”  Steve blushed deeply.  He was getting really, really angry with himself.
The Avengers in full sunlight on the steps of their headquarters a week later, with Steve and Thor standing in the middle.
War Machine’s helmet didn’t come off in one piece the way Tony’s did.  The shell of the helmet slid off of a kind of guard extending from his flexible neck-armor up to cover the very back of his head.  His face was fully visible though, competent, experienced, and a bit worried.  Steve didn’t recognize the man.
It was a moment, one of hundreds Tony had seen through iron eyeslits over the years.  They were there- -and gone- -and if he could remember them at the right times later, it was moments like that that kept him from going mad.
“If you or any of your known vigilante associates should happen to see him, please see that he gets this.”
Tony smiled, and picked it up between finger and thumb.  Still bright, after all these years.  The yellow metal was covered with a coating of minute scratches, and the old-fashioned styling felt heavy and solid in his hand.  Tony didn’t have a pocket at the moment, so he put it on his right ring finger.
Tony took a breath, forcibly, and slid down the wall to his knees on the cool concrete floor.  The rear edges of his leg-armor dug into the backs of his knees at this angle, but he could barely even feel it, reaching determinedly into a hinged matte-black plate on the back of the jukebox.  His fingers felt heavy.  Numb.  He found the end of the power cord he needed more from memory than anything else, and half-turned so he could lean back against the wall.
War Machine grabbed Tony’s other ankle, and swung him against the cracked street to the side of them like a club, face first.
“You know, my identity as Captain America has often required me to deceive my commanding officers and NCOs in the past.  Not by directly lying you understand, but by pretending to be the laziest, cheekiest, most useless goldbrick in my platoon.  In short, by ensuring that the question ‘are you Captain America?’ would never enter their minds at all.  The times and the situation demanded it.  The
“Shoe’s on the other foot, eh? Now you know how I feel watching you pull all the dangerous shit you do,” he countered, and Tony had to fight the urge to just say ‘fuck it’ and hug the everliving shit out him. “Now help me up, dumbass. We have a purple ass to kick.”
. His skin was paler, greyer than it had been in his memories, the wrinkles more prominently engraved in his face. He looked…
A sudden loud groan drew everyone’s eyes to Rhodey, who had his face in his hands. He peeked through his gauntleted fingers at them. “Do you all really not realize this is the beginning of the end? He’s going to be
that it would be enough. And when the alien army started crumbling to dust, dissolving to pieces in front of his eyes, he didn’t feel gleeful but instead felt merely wearily relieved.
“I really need to block all the old videos of me so you’ll stop stealing all my insults,” he said wearily, though his lips quirked up in a small grin. “Seriously, kid, 2010 me is
He heard Steve’s footsteps getting close and turned to see the super soldier hot on his heels. Desperately, he threw his arsenal, hitting Steve in his impressive chest and abs. This, unsurprisingly, did not stop Steve.
Tony didn’t think anything else of it as they all settled in to watch “Home Alone,” sprawled out on the couches and sipping hot chocolate. In the dark, he didn’t even notice Clint was missing, until –
But he was distracted from his amusement by the sound of a very loud THUD behind him, and he turned, the rest of the team with him tensing momentarily, then relaxing. A blue-and-grey armor was standing across from him, its face unreadable until the helmet retracted, and then Tony had to resist the urge to beg its inhabitant to
“As if I could forget it, after your overly dramatic declaration that got played over every news channel ever for
Timeline #2 has gotten quite a few requests, so there will probably be several more chapters from that timeline in this collection :)
Tony exhaled, feeling simultaneously tired and determined. “So what happens next?” he asked, wondering which world he’d end up in. God, he hoped with all his heart it wasn’t one of the ones where Morgan and Pepper were both dead. Or Peter. Or Harley. Or Steve, or Rhodey, or Nebula. It was starting to truly hit him just how awful this might be.
make the argument worse just for the sake of riling Steve or Morgan up.” Tony let out an affronted gasp, clutching his chest.
“Daaaaad, Uncle Steve says my shield design isn’t cool enough for him! Tell him he’s being mean!” Morgan called, voice petulant as Steve’s laughter echoed enough for Tony to hear. He rolled his eyes, grinning at Pepper.
And Steve smiled so happily at that, like Tony had given him the world, that Tony could only stare stupidly. “Me too,” Steve said quietly, eyes dancing with a pleasure that Tony felt like was reserved for only him in this moment. He blinked, trying to shake off these silly thoughts.
you – as in past tense. That trumps what you need,” he spat, and Rhodey’s hand settled on his shoulder in a way meant to offer support rather than restraint. He knew his Rhodey bear had been just as infuriated, just as irked that Tony had been disregarded at the cost of half the universe in his old memories. It bolstered him to know he still had his Platypus’s support in this. “I seem to recall telling you this was going to happen – for
“I sent some of my scouts out to locations we know were frequented by Thanos and his followers, and they reported that it looked like his armies were regrouping,” she said solemnly.
“Good. If that’s all?” There were hums of agreement, and Natasha nodded. “Alright, then. Stay safe, everyone.” And with that, she shut off the holograms. The group dispersed rather quickly, and Tony took advantage of Natasha approaching Steve, likely to talk strategy, to slip past the super soldier and escape from the briefing room.
A few weeks after his and Morgan’s little talk, and he still hadn’t broached the subject with Cap – though his dreams had very pointedly taken a turn to focus on that particular person of interest. But still, he hesitated, because for one thing, was he even sure Steve was interested in him? It was entirely possible he was reading into things, projecting his own wants and desires onto someone who was conveniently close by and happened to also be an all-around amazing guy. For another, he wasn’t even sure how to bring it up. ‘Hey, Cap, so I’ve spent the last two years grieving for my wife, and my daughter told me I have her blessing to get back in the dating game, wanna go out sometime?’
And then the spy twins sashayed away, leaving Tony staring after them until he shrugged. “Guess we better get going, then,” Tony said, turning to look at Steve with a smirk, only to see Steve gazing at him with an inscrutable expression. “What, do I have something on my face?” Tony asked, rubbing at it self-consciously.
to fix this. It was what Pepper did – she put him back together, she patched him up and made him as whole as he could ever be. But not this time. Not this time, FRIDAY.
He waited patiently for her to speak. “I knew you were different when you came back from fighting Thanos when I was a little girl,” she said finally, and he nodded, unsurprised. She looked at him searchingly for a moment, and he wondered what she saw. “Are you going to tell me about it?”
“What are these decorations you speak of, friend Clinton?” Thor asked, eyes suddenly gleaming eagerly, and Tony had a bad feeling.
- and that footage had quickly become popularized. Peter had been thrilled, memeing the shit out of it, as Tony had expected – of course, that was
He’d known it was coming; she’d been growing steadily sicker and weaker for months, though her eyes remained as bright and fiery as they’d been the moment he met her. He’d had ample time to prepare himself, and yet watching the flame in her eyes fade until it was extinguished could only be described as a shock to the system, a thousand volts coursing through him and dragging him to his knees as he clutched her hand, limp in his own, not even trying to hold back the tears.
me,” he said in horror, looking at the black-and-blue bruises that littered his torso. He glanced at Steve, eyes narrowing further. “And you don’t even have a
“So we have no idea where he’s going, no idea what he’s after, and no good way to stop him,” Rocket summed up, folding his arms and looking more pissed off than usual. “Great, I’m lovin’ our chances here.”
“She’s asleep, Tones,” Rhodey said softly, steadily, resting one hand on Tony’s shoulder. “She hasn’t been sleeping well lately. Why don’t you let her rest and see her first thing in the morning?”
Pepper eyed him contemplatively. “As you did not know this, perhaps there is one more thing we should tell you,” she said thoughtfully. “When we state that you do not die while wielding us, that includes your original timeline.”
Bolstered by the thought, Tony pushed himself out of bed and pulled on some casual clothes of his that were still in the dresser drawers – and a little touched that the team had never cleared them out, had left his room exactly as he’d had it before he’d left the Avengers. Eyes bright, he opened the door and wove through the hallways, heading for the kitchen, fairly certain that was where he’d find his daughter – only to be disappointed.
“We will not take no for an answer,” Harley said, eyes twinkling with something akin to mischief. “Think on it – you will have the time.”
“That’s slander, Mrs. Stark,” he said, pointing an accusatory finger at her. She stood, moving closer and wrapping her arms around his waist.
“Wow, this is awesome! Damn, wish I had money like this,” Clint said, awed as he looked around the expansive log cabin with its tall, roaring fireplace and comfy rustic furniture. To one side, there was a stairway that led to the second floor, which was mostly just storage, though it had a balcony that overlooked the living room.
Side note in case anyone is questioning the fic/chapter titles - so when I first named TMM, it was a reference to Panic! at the Disco's Oh Glory, because I was humming that lyric 'if I wake in the morning, I only need two more miracles to be a saint' and the first scene in TMM where Tony wakes up after thinking he's going to die popped into my head, and so yeah that's how that story got named. Then all the chapters in TMM ended up being little snippets of the lyrics from that song that I thought went with the chapter. Soooo I ended up carrying on that trend this work. Yes, I'm a dork, I'm very aware.
“I do not understand,” Thor was whispering to Bruce. “You warm these puffy clouds over the fire then place them on top of chocolate and crackers? This seems a strange dish, even for Midgard.”
“Hey kid,” he started, glancing over and face pinching as he tried to decide how best to word this. “Is there – do you need to let anyone know you’re sticking around here? If that’s what you’re doing?”
“Yeah, that sounds just like me, doesn’t it, Cap?” he said, voice dangerous as he pushed himself off the bed, standing. “Lazy, arrogant, not much of a worker, right? Nothing more than a spoiled billionaire who lets everyone else do all the work for him – that’s who
And Steve was laughing, a sound so gorgeous that Tony wished he could bottle it, and then they were wrestling, and Tony squeaked (though he would deny it to his dying day) as they tumbled off the bed and onto the floor, then continued their wrestling match.
Tony grinned at Steve, who smiled back at him. “You handled that really well,” Steve said softly, and Tony felt something warm flutter through him.
. His children, his sons and daughter who he didn’t want to leave behind. At least he could leave them a world that wouldn’t be threatened by Thanos or, if his teammates had any sense, the infinity stones.
“That’s terrifying,” Steve muttered darkly under his breath, but Tony still heard him and smiled winningly before swanning out of the room.
the major milestones – to see her graduate high school, then college, then grad school. To see her get married and have children of her own, and to get to be a grandfather for those children. To see her blossom, take over first as head of R&D
That struck Tony as strange. “With you?” he asked, exhaustion preventing him from vocalizing any more of the question but knowing Rhodey would understand.
A knock sounded on the door. “Tony,” Natasha’s voice called, and both Steve and Tony snapped to alert, knowing that tone: something was really, horribly wrong. “Tony, are you in there?”
A sense of peace swept through him, the sensation of knowing exactly what he needed to do draining the urgency of the battlefield. He knew, now, what his purpose here was.
This chapter was partially a request by NightHunterDeath (I promise to get to the rest of the request ASAP, this one-shot just ended up having a nice spot to end on, so the rest of your request will be in a diff one-shot in this collection!!)
“I can’t say you’re not gonna lose me,” Tony said firmly when he pulled back, shaking his head at Steve’s immediate protest. “I can’t, because none of us can make that promise, as much as we all want to. But what I
Nebula had opted to go with the Guardians when it was all finished, and Tony had only requested that she keep in contact. He’d been a little
closer, and it was doing bad things to his blood pressure, and really Steve was a hazard to his health, 0/10 should not be allowed to be so perfect.
YES I REALIZE THIS IS ALL SUPER CONVENIENT BUT IT'S A FIX-IT FIC AND I WILL DO WHAT THE FUCK I WANT, YOU WERE WARNED IN THE TAGS :')
But for now, they were friends, and that was more than enough for him; his life was perfect and full and
“I’m fine, worrywart,” he said flippantly, batting Steve’s hands away and giving the super soldier a reassuring smile. He didn’t look particularly reassured. Tony didn’t blame him.
Breakfast was mostly uneventful, with Natasha threatening to stab Clint if he hogged the syrup, Thor breaking a few plates, and Bruce and Tony being near-catatonic until they’d consumed about eight cups of coffee each, as per the norm, and the rest of the day passed much the same. Steve had apparently decided today was going to be a lazy day, so they tugged out some board games that Bruce had brought and settled in.
Tony’s heart panged. “I’m glad you’re alive, too, kid. How are you?” He left the question purposely broad, leaving it up to Harley as to what he wanted to reveal.
“Activating Old Man Bifocals protocol, Boss,” FRIDAY responded, and Tony let out an indignant squawk.
“Why don’t we get you to bed, Tones,” Rhodey broke the silence quietly, pressing a bit more firmly on his shoulder. Tony blew out air through his nose, exhaustion sweeping through him.
“But Stephen, this is soooo at least partially your fault! If you weren’t a cool badass sexy magician, this would never have happened!” Tony argued, and Stephen’s brow furrowed before one eye peeked open, mouth opening to retort – and then promptly splitting into a wide grin.
“Yup, looks like it,” he said as flippantly as he could muster, pasting on a cocky smile and leading the way down the hall. “I’ll try to keep the innuendos to a minimum to preserve your delicate forties sensibilities, but no promises,” he called over his shoulder with a wink, but Steve just rolled his eyes. Well, damn, Tony was going to have to up his game if Cap was that used to him already.
“Adopting another one, Tones?” Rhodey asked knowingly, the barest hint of a smile quirking at his lips, and Tony shrugged. The trio followed Steve, a once-again-very-blond Natasha, and Captain Marvel – Carol, she’d said – back.
“You have made the selfless wish and taken upon yourself more than any one being should have to,” Morgan said, her voice sweet and serene. “We think it only fair that you ask something of us intended for your benefit and yours alone.”
“I’m sure I can think of something,” he reassured him, voice low. “I’m a genius, after all.” Stephen hummed, smirk deepening as he leaned in to kiss Tony more thoroughly.
Clint whooped, and there was clapping, and when Tony turned, Steve’s arm snaking around his waist, it was Natasha and Bruce, the former looking unimpressed and the latter appearing pleased. Thor was lifting one arm triumphantly, and thunder crashed in the distance.
, at least on Tony’s part, though he didn’t think he was imagining Steve returning his heated glances or staring at him a little too long when he was dressed up (or down, apparently Steve wasn’t picky) or dropping particularly flirty lines. He hoped he wasn’t imagining it at least, though he’d been out of the game so long with…with Pepper that he couldn’t be entirely certain.
“Who told you that?” Tony interrupted, recalling how this conversation had gone in his old memories, the old hurt, fury,
“Yeah, some of the adults in the town are taking care of any of the kids who don’t have parents. Benefits of living in a small town, I guess. They’re looking out for us,” Harley reassured him, though his voice still sounded heartbreakingly bleak.
. Oh God, he’d be able to raise Morgan. He could see Pepper again to tell her how much he loved her. He could be there for Peter and Harley. He could re-adopt Nebula, since he hadn’t done as much as he’d wanted to in his original timeline – if he could tear her away from the Guardians, that was. If not, weekly space calls could be a thing. They would work it out.
With a jolt, Tony jerked awake, sitting up rapidly. Peter was looking at him with concern, one hand on his shoulder as he gave him a tentative smile. “Hey Mr. Stark, you looked like you were having a bad dream, so I thought I’d try to get you up,” Peter said, his voice carefully easy. Glancing around, Tony realized he must’ve fallen asleep on the couch. Morgan was curled up on the other end, breathing soft and even, and seeing her settled the pinched, worried knot inside him.
. He couldn’t regret the time he’d stolen with them, the moments he’d get to remember forever now that he hadn’t had before.
“Why don’t we get you inside, Tones? You look like you need medical care,” Rhodey prompted, and there were noises of agreement from the others. Tony nodded, Nebula stepping back so Peter and Rhodey could help him. He watched as Rocket walked past him, heading for Nebula, who was looking so alone standing at the bottom of the step of the ships.
“Guess I better go mediate before the children get into it,” he said, standing, and Pepper raised an eyebrow at him.
He expected the burning sensation this time, the stones’ power sliding like liquid fire through his veins – but it still hurt like hell. Gritting his teeth, he focused, mentally pushing forward the same thought, wish,
But even with all that, Thanos appeared more vaguely amused than anything; it was clear he was just toying with them, likely bored while waiting on his cronies to bring Tony to him and seeking out a way to entertain himself. He could destroy the Avengers facing him with the stones in a heartbeat if he really wanted to, but he was fighting lazily, countering every attack with unerring precision.
All five heads turned to face the doorway, where Harley and Peter had burst into the room, eyes wild.
Tony swallowed, the lives he’d seen in his dreams flashing before his eyes. “And what would happen, if I did?” he asked hoarsely.
“Yeah, it should be on the counter to your left,” he responded, and Tony stepped forward, toward the kitchen.
“I’m looking for Morgan – have you seen her?” he asked, trying to keep the desperation out of his voice and only partially succeeding, if Rhodey’s amused by sympathetic expression was anything to go by.
“Thanks, Peter,” Tony croaked, and he blinked. With surprise, he brushed a palm against his face, realizing his cheeks were wet.
“You a little tired there, kid?” Tony asked, stepping away from the coffeemaker and sitting back down at the kitchen table.
“Are you certain, Man of Iron?” Thor called, brow pinched with concern as he made his way over, Valkyrie and Nebula hot on his heels. Tony didn’t need to turn to know that Rhodey had already come to stand beside him; he could feel the James Rhodes Concerned Mother Hen Routine activating without even looking his way. “You became very pale,” Thor continued, and Tony just gave him a quick, easy grin.
“Everyone suspects themselves of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine; I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known,” Morgan responded smartly, and Tony let his mouth drop open exaggeratedly.
“Well well well, someone’s looking particularly alert this morning considering they haven’t even had their coffee yet. Are we sure that’s Tony Stark and not some clone?” Rhodey teased from where he was seated at the breakfast table, coffee in hand and plate of eggs and bacon in front of him, and though Tony knew he was joking, he felt a jolt of fear run through him – they didn’t
Tony went through a few different emotions that he was very proud of himself for not immediately expressing, taking a deep, calming breath, before saying, “If you don’t let us out of here right fucking now I swear to
“What’s up, I’m Jared, I’m 19, and I never fucking learned how to read,” Peter’s voice cried over from overhead, and Tony startled.
Tony was going to tell Fury that, too, when he was inevitably called to the pirate’s office for traumatizing Captain America by springing an awkward boner.
“Yeah, Cap, but it’s like 20 degrees out and there’s snow over everything. All the wood will be wet,” Tony said dubiously, but Steve only smiled.
Tony scoffed. “Please, I refused Stan Lee’s offer to go out to lunch one time, and that guy’s more of a god than Thanos will ever be.”
“No name-calling, squirt,” Tony reprimanded automatically, but he smiled. “But your sis is right, guys. Clearly I have a lot to teach you about women.” He winked, and the two boys groaned.

“Careful, your marshmallow’s on fire,” Steve warned, a smile in his voice, and Tony drew his mind back to the present in time to notice that his marshmallow was, indeed, burning. Tony drew it off the fire quickly blowing the flames out, but his marshmallow was already scorched. He shrugged.
, stayed safe. It wouldn’t help, he told himself. He’d be playing right into Thanos’s hands, and, worse, he’d probably be a distraction and could end up getting the others hurt. He tried to focus on his own fights instead but couldn’t resist having FRIDAY patch him through to Rhodey’s suit camera so he could see how they were doing.
