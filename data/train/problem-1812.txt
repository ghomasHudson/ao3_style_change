“Faire is square, I’d say” the attempted humor sounded strange to both of their ears.
“I don’t believe this is the right tone to address your significant other-“
it, then), it’d be nice to celebrate it properly.”
. They made him feel confused and small, like a child lost in the woods. It had made him angry, not knowing why they were there. Now he knew… and wished he didn’t. Was actually glad that he couldn’t remember everything. Still…. Mycroft had lied to him. Why did that feel like such a grand betrayal? Maybe because it sometimes felt like he had deleted too much. Like he was now missing something…. important. A connection between the images his mind reproduced and the feelings that floated around unattached in his mind palace.
“I’ll wait right here” Something akin to relief flashed in those eyes, before John lowered his gaze in apparent embarrassment. Then he stood, a little shaky, a little awkward, a little lost, and staggered towards his drawer, pulled out a random boxershorts and t-shirt, and vanished in the bathroom without a word. When the shower started running, Sherlock released a breath he didn’t realize he had been holding. The next twenty minutes, he busied himself with changing John’s bedding, putting on pajama pants and a tattered shirt, and making two fresh cups of tea- always with a sense of peace surrounding him.
. Nothing was fine.
“Yeah, oh.”
.  It was the perfect solution, John would feel valued and respected. But….
John sighed, still smoothing over his friend’s arm. “I’m not having a crisis, Sherlock. I’m pretty damn sure about this” (‘But I’m still not sure about you’ he added in his mind) “But... listen, let’s talk at home. I’m just finishing my last pint. You can wait here or go ahead”
, John had no idea. He used some gentle words, which hopefully showed the government official that he shouldn’t feel as guilty as he did, and at the same time expressed his deep fondness for Sherlock. They at least weren’t dismissed, which John interpreted as a success.
pressing their lips together.
(He didn’t even let Sherlock see it.)
“I’ll be there when you wake up”
John watches helplessly how their possessions get jostled about (if Sherlock realizes that they’re playing around with Billy the Skull, he will probably murder them) and commented on. The blonde guy (Bob…Bobby?) shouts visons about improved interior design to nobody (the camera, John presumes) while the athletic brunette (something with an ‘A’….) steals away to the kitchen.
Everything stops for a moment.
John chewed his lower lip, while trying to pay attention to the soft, breathy crying of the subsect's mother, keeping Sherlock always in his field of vision.
“But it’s
“But you should have told me. I wouldn’t have made the- admittedly unnecessary- request”
“I love you, too,” John smiled, before continuing his story. And if he noticed Sherlock inching even closer to him, he didn’t comment on it, just silently enjoying the happiness it brought him.
They passed Donovan and Anderson, and John could pinpoint the exact moment that Donovan suddenly realized that maybe, maybe the freak wasn’t so bad, after all. Maybe, just maybe him and his doctor found their happiness in the unusual and twisted lifestyle they were living. Maybe, just maybe the child was lucky to have not one, but two adults who looked after her lovingly. It was the moment when Anderson opened his mouth and was shut up quite rudely by the female officer’s sneer: “Give ‘em a rest”.
, that this reason was one of mutual
“Well, too bad, you’re going to, anyway” Sherlock shot his blogger a glare which, he hoped, communicated his non-consent with this situation. “Since when are you on
Then John would appear in the kitchen, and make tea, and tell Sherlock about his schedule in the surgery. He’d talk, and shove some toast in Sherlock’s face, and then he’d leave for the day. He never realized the melancholy in the detective’s expression.

“That’s right, sweetheart. See? She gets it.”
“That’s bullshit!”
That night, when they lay entwined among the sheets, and Sherlock was fast asleep, John pressed a gentle kiss against his partner’s sleep-warm lips.
As he points to the fridge, his fingers are trembling. “Blood. Pig head. Fucking
~ Two hours later ~
“Good morning Sher-“
'Ta, Greg. - JW'
“C’mon.” Sherlock murmured against his best friend’s hair once they were alone. “Let’s go home” his warm breath caressed softly against John’s neck.
Panicking slightly, John doubled his efforts. They were around two blocks away from Baker Street. He was eager to get to the safety of their flat, away from the glares. He crouched down on Rosie’s eyelevel and settled for his best ‘no nonsense’ glare. It worked on Sherlock, after all.
Sherlock grumbled to himself, but made no further move to protest, since his favourite little human was occupying the backseat with him. They would have lovely chats, just like they always did, on this surely immensely
“I’m being really polite and gentle about this now, but your kitchen was a disaster.”
It was a level of sass Sherlock didn't know John was capable of. He forgot to sulk for a moment, to let the deep affection he felt for that man in this very moment overtake him. His John was brilliant and eloquent, and even the tedious Mycroft couldn't scare him away! How lucky he was to have him in his life as his ... companion. Sherlock made a face. His thoughts were running wild this morning. This amount of sentiment in his system would most likely cause him to blackout any minute! It had to prevented at an instant.
Greg sighed. The increased desperation in Sherlock’s voice was tugging at his heartstrings. “Rows happen. That’s part of the deal”
“To be honest, I’m not sure. You see, yesterday”-
was not only unsettling, but also downright humiliating. He had been humiliating himself a little bit too often for his taste lately. However, he couldn’t concentrate enough to put his indifferent mask back on. Not with John’s hand not leaving his thigh the entire ride home.
When the yellow “do not cross” tape of the crime scene came into sight, John felt like it welcomed him; like a colleague, an acquaintance, almost a friend. It was part of his extraordinary lifestyle as much as the eyeballs in the fridge. ‘Who am I kidding?’, John thought to himself when he paid their fare and stepped out of the cab. An ordinary life would kill the adrenaline junkie in his heart. He tried with Mary, and it had worked for some time. But during this time, emptiness creeped inside of his body and stayed; infecting all the tremendously normal aspects of everyday life. He needed the excitement, he knew. He needed the running, and the eyeballs, and the crime scenes and the insufferable git of a flatmate. He was addicted to Sherlock.
“Yet I can’t get that moment out of my head when I saw you falling. It’s haunting me whenever I close my eyes. I know now that…it wasn’t real but… I didn’t know then. Hell, part of me still doesn’t believe that I have you back”
This, however. This was different.
John eyed the ceiling some more and sighed eventually. He was being a silly old romantic again, wasn't he? But there was something about this damn Sherlock Holmes that made him weak. He spend enough time denying the blooming feelings in his chest (He called his glorious "not gay"-phase), and frankly he just grew tired of lying to himself after Sherlock had jumped off a fucking building. And now, he kind of acknowledged them, these strange, irrational, impossible feelings for his even stranger and even more impossible flatmate; but refused to show them. What would be the point of that, anyway? Sherlock wasn't interested.
look while they were mingling around the party-goers; the look like John was the most brilliant thing he ever laid his eyes upon.
His favorite so far included learning that Sherlock had been obsessed with pirates and space, thus resulting his strong determination to become a ‘space pirate’ some day.
“It was the mid-wife. Had an affair with the father. Murder-weapon will be found in the garden pond.” he finished his deduction hurriedly, no longer caring about showing off his intellect. Not when John was obviously having a panic attack, a panic attack he very obviously noticed but ignored in favor of boasting.
Everybody in the car shrieks.
Sherlock only exhaled heavily against the soft fabric. He had missed this. He didn’t know he still harbored these desires to be wrapped in safety and security, but now they reminded him of…. Easier times… where affection was given, and he felt more than just a strange mixture of exhaustion and constant attention…where his brother had been My, where they had been friends, where feelings were not a strange concept.
Which humiliated him deeply. He had tracked down Moriarty’s web, alone. He survived months of torture and pain, without ever being terrified for one second. Because he knew it had purpose for his work. He knew it was the right thing to survive, and he had been arrogant enough to assume (correctly) that he would. After all, Mycroft wouldn’t let him die. And he couldn’t die, not with John Watson waiting for him at home.
“Cute!”, Jonathan pipes from the backseat, despite the fact that he hardly has enough information to make this judgement; but that’s not the point. Jonathan has the gift of finding something cute in everything.
At that exclamation, John looked up in surprise, self-deprivation forgotten for a second. He stared flabbergasted, until an involuntary giggle slipped through his lips. “Sorry. It’s just, I thought I’d never see the day where a posh bastard like you swears” He covered his mouth, still smiling despite himself.
He’s not used to that at all.
. It made John feel excited.
“What do you say, captain? Can he stay on board of our beloved ‘Night Hawk’?”
“Yeah.”
Greg stared at the mess for some seconds with a patient resignation, before he turned to look at the other mess in the room. Sherlock had slight down against the wall and was now seated on the floor, knees bend and face buried in his hands. He looked young, so insanely young; it was so easy to forget between the coat and the arrogant demeanour, but Sherlock was so damn insecure most of the time. For some moments, there was silence, except for Sherlock’s hurried breaths.
The last two weeks had been quiet, without exciting cases and much too much time to think, to mop around, to worry about Sherlock’s breakdown, about his role in this all, about what it meant for the dynamics of their relationship. Sure, he knew that he was in love with Sherlock (he came to terms with calling it that roughly three days prior, when he realized that he passed the point where he would have been able to lie to himself about it), but did Sherlock know, too? Did Sherlock
Greg smiled fondly at the young man, as he was stumbling to his feet in a hurry to get home. Already in the doorframe, Sherlock turned once more and gave the inspector a tiny, but genuine smile. “Thank you, Greg”
But it could.
"He is your brother" A pause. (Sherlock considered bluntly storming into the room to prevent this treason)
It wasn’t awkward as John had anticipated. It was
Some minutes later in the shower, John wouldn’t be able to recall what the hell had gotten into him to throw all his cautions to the wind and just do it. He’d been fantasising about it for weeks, yet he never managed to bring up the courage to act upon those fantasies. He was always worrying. About fucking this up. About the prospect of an unrequired love. Awkward gestures of pity. Uneasiness. Sherlock leaving.
Fighting the tremor out of his voice, John spoke softly: “What’s wrong, sweetheart? How can Daddy help you?” It sounded far more confident than before and John dared to get his hopes up. However, when Rosie turned to him with a heart-breaking expression written all over her face, John didn’t feel so sure anymore. Fat, ugly tears rolled down her reddened cheeks, but she toned down the small whimpering noises in her throat. She had probably tried to hide her state of distress from John. It wasn’t the first time she had done that; although she was only small, Rosie already had the pride of a Watson, who would much rather appear angry than sad. Didn’t mean it made John feel less bad; his little princess shouldn’t hesitate to come to him with her every need. But she did.
So now, when he stood there and made it seem like it was the easiest thing in the world to get over Sherlock, John finally snapped. It didn’t happen as one would suppose from a passionate man like John Watson. There was no yelling, or punches, or tears. Just a clenched jaw and one, icy comment: “Stay away from me for the rest of the evening”
“I like the sound of that”
The politician already put is icy mask back on, and was already in the middle of standing up, with a forcibly polite “It is getting rather late, I shouldn’t take up any more of your time”, when the unexpected happened. John Watson vowed to mark the day in his calendar.
didn’t he have the right to make certain requests towards their relationship as well?
John only nodded, and hoped Sherlock would be able to put the pieces together on his own and didn’t make him actually voice them. The idea of talking about his insecurities and anxiety somehow made him awfully embarrassed. Although Sherlock was his partner, John still didn’t feel fully comfortable to share his vulnerability with him. He was used to being tough and strong, stripping the layers of control and authority off to lay all his fears bare did impress him. It always took a lot, but when he did, after he shared a part of himself he strongly disliked, he always ended up feeling more connected to the younger man. Still, it didn’t mean that this trust came easy.
Well.
John was a sorry sight. The detective had never actually seen him have a nightmare, and now he sort of wished he hadn’t come up the stairs. The pictures (let alone the
“Up already?” John entered the picture, all friendly doctor charm and comfortable jumpers, and Sherlock just couldn’t
Life was fucking fantastic.
He still couldn’t believe that this was his life now. But just one look at the expression on John’s face told him, that he didn’t really matter either way.
considering it and- oh God- he had acted like a fucking teenager yesterday. That was your masterplan, sentiment? Getting drunk and making John jealous? Really?! Well, mission failed. That must have been the opposite of attractive.
“I have to go home” He looked up, his eyes pleading. “Please”
“You still remember?”
something, they were nothing but fake niceties.
"John" he whimpered and slacked against the strong body of the smaller man like dead weight. He felt utterly cold and shaking terribly, but her voice was no longer in his mind. Slowly, his mind came back online (Case, late spring, probably around 6 in the evening, approximately a 20 minutes’ drive away from Baker Street, trauma-induced anxiety attack). Breathing irrationally hurt, but he tried it anyway for John's sake. There was a dull pain in his temples and the faint taste of bile in his mouth; but frankly it didn't matter, because it was real.
“You should go with your-“
And maybe, just maybe – John thought to himself when he waited for a taxi with his partner’s arms around his waist and his chin resting lightly on his shoulder; with his daughter’s comfortable weight in his arms and her delighted giggles in his ear about the kisses Sherlock showered her nose with – they were jealous. After all, nobody had thought (John included) that from all the people at the Yard, the sociopathic, arrogant detective and the crippled, broken army doctor were the ones who found peace in a domestic family life.
Without another word, he stormed past Lestrade and was gone. Sherlock stood there, simply blinking for around 30 seconds. All his thoughts came to screeching halt when he watched his partner disappear, disappear to get home without him, to have dinner without him, to read Rosie a bed-time story without him, to sleep in their bed without him. No. This is not right. That’s not the correct way to end this argument. No. That’s not the way any day was supposed to end. John always forgave him at the end of the day. They have had fights before, but they always ended them when they cuddled together in bed and John would tell him that it’s ‘okay now’, because they were together and that was the most important part, but now they were NOT together and what if John WOULDN’T cuddle with him or-NO, this is not right.
was the worst that could happen. Maybe Sherlock was right. Maybe John Watson was an idiot, after all.
“I don’t want a fucking coffee. You might be incredibly stupid, but even your attention spawn can’t be so short that-“
Mycroft raised an eyebrow, amused.
When Sherlock emerged from his deep musings, the sun hung low in the sky and voices seeped through his closed bedroom door. It was time.
John felt just so fucking alone and helpless. He needed Mr. super detective to save the day.
“See you, Greg” He left a slightly confused DI behind and stomped towards the bar, trying to look casually and failing.
“That’s a stupid cause for fear” he said, good-naturedly. “I told you, I won’t leave.”
Antoni- as it is his habit- immediately pulls open the refrigerator door. He is delighted (animatedly talking to the camera) that there are two fridges in this house- “Surely an indicator of immense culinary experimentation”- when he encounters the toes.
It was just the exhaustion talking, making him weary, old, not at all himself.
“Good luck,” he murmurs in John’s general direction, his rich baritone laced with amusement.
John smirked a little, for he knew how to deal with Sherlock's little temper tantrums. But, more importantly, would he care about John's value system? Knowing Sherlock, probably not. He would most possibly laugh, and dismiss it as stupid sentiment. Still....wasn't it worth a try? You only have one brother, even if he's shite at times. And Mycroft had moments that were so far away from shite, that John even felt a little sorry for thinking him such a nuisance at times. When all he ever did was
The first time Sherlock noticed it, he tried to ignore it.  He should be used to it, by now. John had pretty violent episodes of night terrors in the first year that they’d known each other, caused by his PTSD. Although he never talked about it, Sherlock could tell it was wearing him thin, and at the same time embarrassing him deeply. Still, they happened so frequently, that the flatmates even developed a routine to deal with them. Sherlock would play Vivaldi’s “Summer” (John’s favorite) on his violin at the first sighs of a nightmare (which was, more often than not, the muffled distressed noises travelling down the stairs), steadily increasing the volume, until the noises upstairs came to a stop. Then, he’d prepare two cups of tea, place them on the coffee table, and wait. John would emerge some minutes later, looking like death. He’d smile to thank Sherlock for the tea, but he wouldn’t speak. He’d plop down on the couch beside Sherlock, turn on the TV. They’d watch some crap shows about cars or teenage pregnancies in silence, until John drifted off to sleep again. Of course, the doctor never acknowledged it in the morning; and Sherlock would be dammed if he tried to touch the subject.
‘Now, that came out of nowhere’, John thought to himself.
He slowly gets an idea what it might mean. But then again, maybe that’s just wishful thinking. You never know with a man as unfathomable as Sherlock Holmes.
“I’m not a child” the detective scoffed, but felt his cheeks heat up under the praise he so very dearly graved. He sighed and pushed his fists against his eyelids, suddenly feeling a nervous energy bubble inside of his stomach.
He stops the train of though right there. Why deflate the nice atmosphere with weirdly insecure thoughts about his sexuality?
John can’t really describe how a game of rugby, a couple of refreshments, and snippets of conversations has managed to give him back some of the confidence he thought he had lost since the army. He feels good and capable and strong- and can’t stop telling Karamo this all the way back to the hotel.
He decides not to think about it too much.
“I’m sorry” he choked with a small, trembling voice. “I..I… sorry, everything is fucked up”.
an interesting conversation with Christoph here-“
Absolutely nothing could ruin his mood.
John didn’t miss the tiny smile flashing over Mycroft’s face and the way he subtly touched his left ring finger (more precisely the decent golden band situated there, something John had never observed before. Had it always been there?)
“Sherlock” John said in his low, dangerous voice. “He will visit and we’ll express our gratitude. This man has put up with your bullshit since you were born, and
The next hour was filled with stories told in that quiet and warm voice, stories about unexpected beauty, stories about why people were more important than things, stories of survival and hope.
The thought made John flush with an emotion he couldn’t quite place, so he chose to ignore it. Not as easy to ignore was the way this special attention made him feel. Small. Vulnerable. Loved. Things that did not really fit the image he had of himself; things he normally deny he needed; things he shouldn’t disclose in front of anyone. He was John H. Watson from the British Army. He was a doctor, a safer of lives. Nobody would take him seriously anymore if they knew that the great John Watson sometimes needed to be coddled in order to function. Sherlock most certainly didn’t take him seriously anymore.
“Hmm, what was that for?” John hummed softly.
“He won’t leave you, Sherlock. But you” he sighed. Maybe this was the chance to finally give him a lecture to get through his thick scull. “the things you do… the stupid, careless, dangerous things, they scare him.”
“You’re doing alright, mate? You look rather shaken.”
“No, Sherlock. Now you listen to ME!” The younger man pressed his lips in a thin line. He’d rather die than admit it, but he dreaded the feeling of John’s anger. It made him strangely…. Anxious? He couldn’t remember being anxious since he had been a child.
“You’re never convenient,” John interrupted again.
A long sequence of words and numbers followed at lightning speed, until Sherlock was presented with another screen.
“Do you want to go for a walk later?”
Sherlock turns to look at John and nods slowly.
“John?”
“No, Sherlock. Sherlock, wait,” John said quickly, before Sherlock managed to roll away and leave the bed. He grabbed Sherlock’s arm and tugged him back. “I didn’t mean it that way.”
my only friend, I didn’t know what else to do,” Sherlock babbled. He felt like the entire world was slipping through his fingers and he couldn’t stop it. “I wanted to spare you the grief. I’m sorry, I know I was wrong, I was selfish and I’m sorry.”
A few hours later, all of Mrs Hudson’s biscuits gone and an army of mugs filled with cold tea strewn around the coffee table, Sherlock finally managed to gain access to one of the folders. All the others remained stubbornly encrypted and unreadable.
“Come here,” John said as he lifted his left arm, only to drape it around Sherlock’s back. Sherlock hummed happily and slumped against John’s side, tucking his head against John’s neck. “You could’ve said you wanted a cuddle.”
“How clever?”
Lestrade was amazed at the affection between the two friends. He’s seen, first hand, how curt and terse Sherlock can be at crime scenes, even towards John. Lestrade often wondered whether Sherlock might push too far one day and drive John away, irreparably destroying the friendship they’ve built over the last year. But it seemed that in their own flat, shielded from the outside world, those two were more than fine. Their affection towards each other was a testament to their strong friendship and Lestrade felt privileged to witness it. Even though he was still pretending to sleep and was effectively spying on them. It was, as John was fond of saying, all fine.
Jane heard Sherlock get up as she started to brush her teeth.  Sherlock walked into the bathroom, yawning so hard Jane could see her tonsils, less than a minute later. Jane continued brushing her teeth and watched with mild amusement as Sherlock navigated the short walk from the door to the loo.
“I missed you too,” John murmured. “So much.”
Sherlock glanced guiltily towards the bathroom door, as if John could sense what he was about to do. But no, John was still happily and obliviously showering.
"I’ll take it from here, officers, sorry to have bothered you.”
John gently tipped his chin up and kissed his forehead.
Not satisfied with the intensity of the smell, Sherlock buried his nose in the collar of the cardigan and inhaled again. The feel of the wool against his face and John’s scent was almost overpowering, and Sherlock couldn’t stop a small whimper escaping his lips. The cardigan smelled like John’s soap and shampoo and fabric softener, his aftershave and deodorant and cologne, hints of tea and coffee and Indian food he had throughout the day; but beneath it all was the unmistakable musk of sweat and
“Oh,” Sherlock exhaled softly. He let go of John’s shirt only to wrap his arms around John’s shoulders. He hid his face in John’s neck. “I’m not saying no. It’s just-- a lot. Very quickly. I would never say no, John.”
Sherlock slowly got his breathing under control and relaxed his vice-like grip on John’s back and shoulders.
Sherlock could’ve sworn Watson sounded almost playful when he said that, and definitely cheerful. He seemed chuffed to bits he managed to surprise Sherlock.
“Whenever I dream about you it isn’t because you’re the most convenient choice. It’s because I—” John paused again and sighed. “I
John walked over to wrap his arms around Sherlock’s waist, and rose up on his toes to place a quick kiss on Sherlock’s lips. By the time John leaned away, Sherlock had only just recovered from the momentary surprise at such a tender welcome. He wrapped his arms around John’s shoulders, not letting him pull away completely.
John grinned in response as he rolled up his sleeves. “I would be delighted to hear
Sherlock could hear John in the kitchen, putting finishing touches to the food and humming quietly to himself. John being in a good mood meant his lunch with Harry went well. She must be sticking to her rehab then, just over six months of being completely sober, and it seemed she was set on seeing it through this time. Though he would never say it, Sherlock knew the difficulties of keeping an addiction in check and felt a pang of sympathy for her efforts.
,” Sherlock clarified, a blush creeping up his neck. He meant to say he had made a new friend, but. Well.
“Sherlock,” Jane sighed as Sherlock kissed up and down her neck. “I really need to pee.”
John added a twist of hand on every upstroke, and at the same time used his teeth and tongue on Sherlock’s nipple. His left hand wandered further down Sherlock’s arse, fingers just grazing the space between the arse cheeks. Sherlock kept pushing his cock into the tight space of John’s fist, his thrusts growing shorter and his hips losing rhythm.
“I’d like to see him try,” John said. He looked down at his watch. “How long do you reckon the rest of this will take?” He gestured vaguely at the crime scene and the police officers getting into their cars.
“You like it? Harry gave me the recipe.”
“Maybe if you made your blog more exciting, more people would read it. A bit more drama and adventure, among the ash analyses.”
Sherlock prepared his bow and violin, while John settled in the armchair facing him. It was the chair that has been no one’s, the one which Sherlock had looked at with such longing just a few nights ago. Now, John was here. And he would stay here, across from Sherlock, smiling with tender affection in his eyes. Neither of them were lonely any longer.
“I know what you’re thinking, and you can’t stop it.” Mycroft pressed his lips into a thin line, a clear sign he was debating how much information he could reveal. “There is a major defence AI being developed, the M Project, and it is beyond my power to influence its trajectory. The awakening of Watson is simply a convenient way to speed it along. It is both out of your hands and mine.”
Sherlock imagined smelling John himself, all those fragrances coming directly from his skin. How he longed to bury his nose in John’s neck, his hair, his armpit, and—
“I will not mention it again. Excuse me,” Sherlock bit out and started to extricate himself from John’s grasp. He was going to shower, dress and go downstairs to breakfast, and erase this whole incident from memory. He would bury his feelings in the deepest pits of his mind palace and never inconvenience John again. He only hopes John would forget it too so they could go on as before.
“Marry me,” John whispered against Sherlock’s lips, his hands caressing Sherlock’s sides and slipping under his shirt to touch bare skin. Sherlock clung to him, throwing a leg over both of John’s and clutching fistfuls of John’s shirt, kissing him in answer.
“No, I understand
John swept his thumb across Sherlock’s cheek, and met his eyes. Something like recognition lit up his features for the first time.
Jane giggled and kissed Sherlock’s frown away, before getting up and walking to the wardrobe. She rooted at the bottom of it until she found the right shoebox, all the while being aware Sherlock was most likely ogling her arse as she did so. A quick glance at the bed confirmed that Sherlock, now sat up, was staring shamelessly.
“Play something?”
“Alright, alright.” John snuggled up to Darcy and gave her a kiss on the cheek in apology. Mollified, Darcy turned to Sherlock.
Shame stained Sherlock’s cheeks red. How utterly
“Sherlock, hey, wake up. Please.”
Sherlock typed those two words with irritated emphasis, even though he knew Watson couldn’t tell,
“If you die, I will bring you back to life and

them.
“Sometimes,” he admitted. “Life back there was pretty rough, but it was home.”
Sherlock felt himself being pushed gently back onto the bed, on his side, and then gathered up in John’s arms. John peppered Sherlock’s face with kisses, running his hands reverently over Sherlock’s back and sides. He murmured praise and endearments, and Sherlock felt as if the love pouring out of John was filling him up and bringing him back to life.
“I think… I’d like to stay. If that’s okay?”
“Exactly.”
“Instead you’re just a giant cat, needing constant attention,” John mused. He smiled down at Sherlock. “Cat Sherlock. Cat-lock.”
“John—”
When Sherlock emerged from the bathroom, the sight before him nearly took his breath away. The only light in the room was the small lamp on the bedside table. John’s skin shone like gold, his hair like the purest silver. He was on his side, facing the empty part of the bed, his outstretched hands ready to embrace whoever climbed in next to him. Sherlock could imagine, just for a second, that this was their shared bed and he was coming back to settle into John’s arms.
“Given the information and reports we have received to date, I propose to terminate Watson with immediate effect.”
The Lab exploded when they were still in the lift on their way up. The whole building shuddered and the lights flickered. The fire and bomb alarms went off immediately, and the lift stopped. An automated message blared from the lift speakers, informing them the auxiliary backup would start up soon to allow them to exit the lift on the next floor. After less than a minute the emergency power supply came on, much to Sherlock’s relief. He hoped the explosion had been sufficient to destroy everything, and if not, that the oxygen fueled fire would finish the job.
“Shush,” John whispered, as he lifted his own mug to his lips and took a careful sip. “Lestrade’s still asleep.”
John’s chaste kiss on the corner of his mouth was startling. Sherlock opened his eyes—he didn’t remember closing them—to see John looking cautiously hopeful and infinitely tender.
Sherlock looked up from his book with mild surprise.
Well after dinner, after the sun had finally set and the cloudless sky became an endless expanse of dark dotted with stars, the Holmes family (which now firmly included John) sat outside in the back garden. The night was warm and the conditions were perfect for watching the Perseid meteor shower.
Now that John was safe, Sherlock could catalogue his physical appearance in more detail. John looked to be around thirty-six, give or take a year or two since no records of his “birth” had been kept. He was shorter than Sherlock but broader, more compact. He had lost a lot of muscle mass due to prolonged stasis but Sherlock imagined John could get fit quickly if he put his mind to it. He had dark blonde hair, streaked with silver and grey. His eyes, big and dark blue, were mesmerising. As were the laugh lines around his mouth whenever he smiled. His habit of licking his lips, however, was wholly distracting.
“Oh,” he exhaled softly as he reached out to touch it. His scarf. One of his scarves from
Sherlock rested their forehead against John’s, letting their emotions and thoughts flow freely between them. John felt the excitement, the wonder, the immense gratitude, and above all the overwhelming love. Sherlock kept whirring and purring but John didn’t need to speak their language to know what they were saying.
Sherlock felt shame burning up his cheeks, he knew he should stop and leave the bed, at the very least wake John up and put a stop to this. He knew was doing something Very Not Good by taking advantage like this but he couldn’t help himself, not when John snuffled like that and tightened his grip around him, when he felt John’s thigh muscles flex under his cock, when he could feel the damp spot on John’s pants rub against his belly.
“It’s okay, little bee. We’re fine now,” John assured as he hugged her back.
“Tell me what you know. Please.”
“How?” Sherlock whirled around to glare at his brother. “You said you can't stop them.”
Unless it was just a sex dream. Nothing more, nothing more significant than John’s brain conjuring up a sex fantasy with the first person who popped into his mind. Why wouldn’t it be Sherlock? They spend all their time together, live in each other’s pockets as far as anyone was concerned. It was perfectly natural and not uncommon to have sex dreams about your friends. It didn’t have to mean anything. It almost certainly didn’t mean anything.
“Mmm, of course not.” Sherlock could hear the smile in John’s voice, and then felt it against his forehead when John kissed him there. “You don’t have to hold back, ever,” John whispered against Sherlock’s skin.
Sherlock stopped what she was doing and looked up at Jane with a frown.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t know the whole time, I couldn’t do anything about it, they—I don’t—John, please—”
“Yes, they do.” Sherlock gave her a small smile. “They live happily ever after.”
“Sherlock, I love you too, I love you so much, so much,” John murmured against Sherlock’s lips. He kept saying it until Sherlock couldn’t hold back the wave of emotions overtaking him. He hid his face in John's neck, hot tears finally escaping his eyes. He breathed in John’s scent and released it in a half-sob. John
Sherlock pouted as the screen announced his entry into the archives, giving him a list of items to explore. He had been hoping for a decent distraction, something to occupy him for a few hours, maybe even a day, but alas no such luck. Sherlock scrolled through the various folders and subfolders and sub-subfolders lazily, exploring a few subsets to see if there was anything worth his attention.
Watson took a few long seconds to reply, and the silence spoke volumes.
John smiled at Darcy and then at Sherlock. Darcy’s latest obsession was dragons, all she wanted to talk and read about were the mythical creatures, and the theme also crept into her clothes. The pyjamas she was wearing had tiny, colourful dragons all over them.
“After you left—” John paused and inhaled sharply. Sherlock felt a pang of sympathy and guilt, but said nothing, knowing John didn’t need to hear more of his apologies no matter how sincere they were. “After you left, I kept this. I never touched it or did anything with it while you were—while you were gone. But I kept it.” John reached out to touch the scarf gently, reverently. “Then you were back but everything was so different. I took it out a lot. Sometimes, when I—it still smelled like you. I could pretend nothing changed.”
John tried to pull Sherlock even closer but broke away from their kiss groaning and wincing in pain.
“We need to talk,” John interrupted.
That wasn’t what Sherlock expected John to say but he gave no indication of his surprise, and remained still. He heard John enter the room somewhat hesitantly and close the door. John walked around the bed to the side Sherlock was on, still so soft and gentle as if Sherlock was an easily spooked animal.
’ Sherlock replied, throwing the insult back at Watson. ‘
Then there were the reports detailing the AI transfer tests, all of which had failed to some degree. Some had been complete failures, killing the host body in the process. Some had been partially successful, but impaired the body to such degree they were in vegetative state or comatose. Others still had been successful in preserving the health of the body, but the AI transfer had been minimal and insufficient.
“No, that’s all I needed.” Sherlock strode off in the direction of the hologram suite. They berated themselves for not checking it earlier. They knew John had been spending a lot of his time in there lately.
Sherlock snorted. “If you’re not careful my mother is going to adopt you.”
“Sherlock? It’s Watson.”
It was a website. Similar to his in layout but with brighter colours. A blog with only two posts, both written by John. The first was about how they met and the first night they spent talking. The second one was about their first, and probably last, case together.
“Why?”
“Why are you doing this?”
“Is this the part where you tell me John is my pirate?” Sherlock couldn’t keep the exasperation from his voice.
He opened his eyes blearily and looked around the room. Spotting his phone on the coffee table, he reached out for it to check the time. Nearly nine. Groaning, Lestrade threw the blanket over his face, desperately hoping to catch just a bit more sleep. Just before he dozed off again, Lestrade thought that, all in all, it wasn’t such a bad start to his day off.
They exchanged closed mouth kisses for some time, straying to kiss cheeks, chins, eyes and even necks. This was their morning ritual on days when there wasn’t a case and they could fully indulge in each other.
“Shit, shit,
“I thought you treated me like an equal, when no one else did.” John’s quiet and angry words cut Sherlock to the bone.
“Thanks, Sh’lock.”
“Don’t thank me yet, you might wake up with a hangover tomorrow,” John chuckled. They bid their goodbyes and Lestrade fell asleep almost immediately.
“Get to the point, Mycroft.” Sherlock snapped. He walked over to the desk to grab the folder, and began rifling through it.
Sherlock walked up to John and peered down at the small planet between them. Patches of blue, green, white and brown on a spherical planet, the origin of humanity and John Watson.
“Go to sleep, love.”
Sherlock couldn’t bring himself to do it, no matter how many opportunities presented themselves. It was in his nature to be an addict, and John was more powerful than any drug he’d ever taken.
“I picked up some junk parts at the last port we were in,” John explained with a small smile. “I think they belonged to a survey ship because there were loads of data logs about— well, it doesn’t matter really but I found something about your planet. From before— from before. When it was there.”
Watson was taking the piss. As much as it rubbed Sherlock the wrong way, he did huff out a breathless laugh at the… cheekiness of the AI. What a personality, indeed.
“I understand your childish need to annoy me, Sherlock, but making a mess of the MI6 archives is beyond petty,” Mycroft said in a tight voice.
Sherlock knew the government, and the military in particular, employed sophisticated AIs to help in the smooth running of the country - something which the general population was largely unaware of. Sherlock had no interest in exposing this fact—the only reason the healthcare service was functioning, and functioning well, was because of the AI that ran it at the highest levels of decision making—but he was curious to see which aspects of his life were affected by intelligent robots.
The case had been exciting but took far longer than predicted, and they had missed the last train to London. On top of that, John had had to perform a rather spectacular rugby tackle on the suspect they were pursuing, which wouldn’t have been a problem if not for the fact that John tackled the man with his left shoulder. The suspect had been apprehended, the case got solved, but John sprained his shoulder rather badly and for once Sherlock insisted on going to the hospital rather than enduring John’s stoic agony.
Sherlock did his best to ignore the warmth of John’s hand on his hip, the warmth of the body pressed against his back, and the soft breaths against his neck. He couldn’t tell how long he stayed awake, keeping himself as still as possible and cataloguing every second, before sleep finally claimed him.
“You know, having parents that love you to bits is not as bad as you make it sound.” John squeezed Sherlock’s waist one last time before stepping away and grabbing his bag. Sherlock followed suit and rang the doorbell. Sounds of great excitement and commotion could be heard from inside, followed by hurried footsteps towards the front door. Sherlock couldn’t suppress an eye roll while John just grinned.
Movie started, they tucked into their food. Sherlock made appreciative noises over the sounds of the opening credits.
about Sherlock’s penguin collection.”
“John,” Sherlock said with a bit more urgency in his voice and tugged on John’s hand. John finally turned his head to look at Sherlock and whatever he was about to say died on his lips when he saw Sherlock’s face. He rolled onto his side to face Sherlock and scooted closer.
It would be so easy to push John away now, make him angry and fight him, sever the connection while it was still fresh. End it before Sherlock got too involved. Anxiety and fear lodged itself in Sherlock’s stomach, a heavy weight deep in his guts.
The sensation of John’s lips on his own was not something Sherlock ever managed to imagine correctly. They were softer, still tasted faintly of mint from John’s toothpaste. They were perfect, and Sherlock never wanted to stop kissing them, stop being kissed
“Dreams don’t mean anything, I was just a convenient—”
“Hello, little bee,” he said softly. He caressed her hair and back, trying to soothe and calm her down, as she clung to him.
“Neither have I,” Sherlock admitted. The fragile, quiet moment between them lingered, and Sherlock felt the knots in his stomach loosen.
“While your assistance is appreciated I would have handled th--“
“John, darling, stop with this Mrs Holmes nonsense. Call me Margaret, or better yet call me Mum. You are part of the family, as far as Thomas and I are concerned,” Mrs Holmes said with a twinkle in her eyes, ignoring John’s vague noises of protest and Sherlock’s sudden blush.
“I can’t even remember what I’ve forgotten,” John had said with a rueful smile.
Sherlock wrapped his arm around John’s waist and pressed them closer together, nuzzling his nose against John’s and mouthing “I love you” back to him.
to the imagination. Sherlock couldn’t help cataloguing John’s penis size, something he’d been fantasising about for years, and he felt his face flush. John was impressive. Huge, even. Bigger than Sherlock’s already generous estimations. It made Sherlock’s mouth water.
“As I was saying,” Sherlock continued, “the older brother wasn’t a very good brother at all. The prince argued and bickered with his brother constantly, no matter how much their parents tried to make them get along. The prince spent his time alone, away from everyone. He loved to learn from books but he also liked adventures, so he often went for walks in the nearby forest. But he always did it alone and it made him very sad.”
Somewhere ahead there was the person he was looking for. A shadow, a silhouette in the darkness. The shape disappeared, along with the maze and the lights and the cables, as he surfaced from his dream.
Sherlock gnawed on his bottom lip as he considered all the possible scenarios. Too many variables to take into account, the end result was unpredictable.
“Alright?”
Outside, the night sky was finally clear.
It was, in short, almost perfect.
The horizon and the sky were indistinguishable in the complete darkness. Above them, the faint outline of the Milky Way cut across the sky. They were lying down on the blanket, among tall grasses, the sounds of crickets their only companion. They held hands, John’s thumb rubbing shapeless patterns into Sherlock skin. John was pointing at the sky, talking about Orion’s belt and the Andromeda galaxy, the Milky Way and Mars, Venus and Mercury. Sherlock was only half paying attention to any of it, he was watching something far more interesting and breathtaking. He was watching John.
John shrugged a little sheepishly. “Anywhere. Regent’s Park? We haven’t been in a while.”
Mycroft pressed his lips into a thin line and frowned. He looked down at his shoes and tapped his umbrella against the floor.
“I have to get up,” Jane tried to placate her. She dropped a chaste kiss just above Sherlock’s eyebrow. “I need the loo.”
"Sir, could you--"
John looked up from Earth and smiled at Sherlock sadly.
Sherlock watched Earth move slowly away from them, considering the question. They looked back at John and squinted.
“Let’s go back to bed. Lestrade won’t be up for at least a few more hours.”
“Because we always are,” John answered simply. He reached over and cupped Sherlock’s cheek. “The prince and the knight are in love, they have adventures, and they live happily ever after.”
Later, once they had composed themselves and the reality of their situation had settled in, Sherlock helped John bathe and eat. John was still somewhat unstable on his feet, the confusion and dizziness from prolonged stasis having not worn off, but his mind was sharp. John remembered Sherlock and everything that happened since they had met just a few days ago. He had also retained his military knowledge, and curiously enough his medical expertise. Even though John had never put either of those to practice in his new body, he explained it felt like he had the dusty muscle memory to go with his knowledge. Some of his memories from before meeting Sherlock were patchy, and vast amounts of his knowledge were lost forever.
“You’re back just in time.”
“Sherlock? Can I come in? Please?” John still sounded so hatefully careful. Sherlock said nothing and wished for his evaporation harder.
“I’m not saying no. I just...” Sherlock cut himself off with an annoyed huff.
and you kept it from me,” John voice was like ice, cold and sharp. For the first time since they met Sherlock was afraid of his voice.
“How can you know that?”
“This is what you do for a job? It’s nothing like what you describe on your site,” John chuckled.
Sherlock could see the tips of John’s ears had gone red.
Sherlock drifted in and out of consciousness while John undressed, cocooned in bed and feeling full to the brim with love. His final thought before drifting off was that, even though their movie nights still contained all the familiar elements from before, they were now far more worthy of storing in the mind palace, romance and all.
“I think it’s a little bit special this year,” John murmured and kissed him again, longer this time. John gently licked and bit at Sherlock’s lower lip before ending the kiss, and Sherlock couldn’t help but lean into John a bit more, chasing after his lips. A small sound escaped him and John pecked him once more, chuckling.
“Do you remember me?” Sherlock murmured.
Sherlock wanted to stop, wanted to be able to stop, but his mind was conjuring up desperate scenarios where they were both awake and having lazy morning sex. Where any second now John would gasp his name and bend down to kiss him, where they would undress each other slowly and kick off the covers, where John would wrap his hand around Sherlock’s cock, where Sherlock would use his mouth to—
Sherlock wasted no time in getting all the documents and reports out of the folder, arranging them all over the floor, and memorising as much as he could in the two scant hours he had.
“I…I..I didn’t…” He sucked in a sharp breath. Greg felt almost bad for exposing the vulnerable genius to all these complex emotions.
Sherlock pursed his lips, a small blush rising to his cheeks.
“But today was unnecessary” the younger man countered. “I just… wanted to have you around.” He cleared his throat, slightly embarrassed. “Pat my ego with your praise. To gain your… approval again.”
Who was he kidding, he would -undoubtedly! - loose John at some point, because nobody in his right mind would want any kind of deeper
With a mildly annoyed groan, he eyed the sleeping figure of his object of desperation(/desire). Sherlock still happily snored on without a care in the world. The doctor felt his annoyance crumble almost instantly. How, for the love of God, how could a grown-up, crime hunting, more-brain-than-person lunatic be so adorable? John smiled warmly at his best friend, stretched and ruffled the mop of dark curls. The detective made a little mewling sound after being touched so gently, but didn't stir or wake. "You're gonna be the death of me," he mumbled affectionate before he left the room quietly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Perhaps” the older Holmes cleared his throat, a clear sign that he was nervous. Never thought John he’d see the day where the British Government was nervous.
It wasn’t often that John Watson had a bad day. Sure, he had ‘this day is fucking surreal what is actually happening’- days, but one might guess that’s a common by-product from working and being in a relationship with Sherlock Holmes.
, Sherlock,
They didn’t know
He was the experienced one here, yet he somehow managed to handle all of this with the worst approaches possible. And now they came to a place where they had hurt each other on this new personal level, and John knew he had to fix it quickly, otherwise their relationship would be over before it even began.
John stopped petting the dark curls (Sherlock discreetly swallowed down a whine) and gave him his best ‘no nonsense’ glare.
At this, he crumbled in on himself again, hugging his own knees, making himself as small as possible. Hiding.
"Sherlock" he tried again when his friend didn't react right away. He sat a bit more upright (Sherlock tightened his grip on John's favorite jumper) and proceeded to stand up. The world's only consulting detective looked up at him (Since it obviously didn't occur to the self-proclaimed genius that he might needed to stand up as well in order for this to work) through a tousle of wild curls and gave him an utterly lost look, while still fisting the poor Jumper for his dear life. Gently, as gently as he could, John entangled his friend's grip on the fabric and took the large hands of a scientist, of a violinist, of a scholar in his smaller, sturdy, worker hands. He pulled until the tall body came to a wobbly stand.
After Sherlock had returned, they had talked. Sherlock had told him everything he needed to know, from the snipers to the torture in Serbia. He had told him everything and John had cried and thanked him for everything he had done. He had taken him to bed and worshipped every single scar on his back, slowly and sensually taking him apart and lovingly sewing him back together again, until Sherlock felt nothing more but fuzzy warmth and a deep happiness. On the other hand, John hadn’t told him anything. And after all the harrowing things happening in the aquarium and with Eurus, Sherlock had never asked. It was simply a thing they did not talk about. Sherlock supposed John got over him quickly, after all he found himself a woman and got attached enough to marry her in around two years. Only John knew how very wrong he was.
“I love you”
Just as he learned that Sherlock somehow managed to delete the taste of ice-cream, he excused himself to wander to the Tesco’s around the block, to reminisce the experience (because ‘Honestly, Ice-cream, Sherlock! Unacceptable!’). He took a few calming breaths in the warm afternoon air. That worked better than anticipated. Way better than hoped, even. The sight of the two idiots finally working out their issues made him extremely proud. Technically it was wrong to mingle like that, but he couldn’t bring himself to have a moral crisis about it. It had worked, didn’t it?!
“She doesn’t really like you” the doctor added good-naturedly.
But Sherlock looked at him like
It just is something he had always said. And now it comes out almost like a mechanical response. Like the words don’t actually mean anything beside their sound.
. They even came barefoot to the campground; forgotten all thoughts of upholding a certain appearance. It was a becoming look on them.
All this touching.
Sherlock stared into this face; this stupid annoying pitiful face of the meddling, cold, unbearably sad looking git; the face he wanted to scream at, the face he always sneered at, the face he couldn’t stand on most days … and …. didn’t. The need to make his displeasure known, to be mad at his brother for lying to him, for being so condescending and controlling, for leaving him and still pretending that he had any control over his life... the idea of fulfillment didn’t make him satisfied. He had felt so much anger, so much frustration over the years; nicely built up and directed at his brother- the man right before him, who clearly looked anything but hate-deserving right now. He had searched a culprit all along and found it in the only person he allowed near enough to actually be a target- and Mycroft took his faith enthusiastically, as if punishing himself for mistakes he didn’t even make. Of course, he didn’t make them…. He had been a child, damnit. Why… why had he been angry at his brother all the time? He couldn’t safe him from the coping mechanisms, which had been chosen for him and he later on choose for himself. It was easier to direct self-hate at someone else, but also so wrong. So damn
Or was it?
John, now attempting to light the mood despite the guilt this statement has caused him to feel, pinched Sherlock’s thigh lightly.
“Thanks for deserting me, git,” the doctor replies just as quietly, but the insult is lost in a smile. Sherlock does that to him, these days.
Rosie’s eyes were dropping by the minute- Greg and John took her swimming after her little nap, joined later on by a pair of very excited Holmes brothers (they really,
'A bit out of it, but we'll get trough- JW'
He gave John a look, all sad determination. “I just don’t want you to leave. But if we start this, you will. I’m not… not good enough”
to acknowledge his efforts as well?!)
His movements came to a standstill, when he felt something, someone, grip his hand with vigor. Surprised, John turned around again.
This wasn’t about doubting the attraction that formed between them, this was about trust. John didn’t know anything about Sherlock’s past experience, but placed an intelligent guess that there was next to nothing. Had the detective ever been kissed? Touched intimately? Let himself go enough to just… feel?
“But” Sherlock bit his lip, fumbled with his hands. “It’s past Rosie’s bedtime; but she needs her bedtime story and John just can’t do the voices right. I have to go home”
Instead of answering, Mycroft smiled, brighter than he had smiled all day (hell, probably all week) and splashed some water in Sherlock’s direction.
When Lestrade had the suspect in cuffs, both of them were in high spirits. The chase had been tiring, but exciting, left them filled with adrenaline and a deep satisfaction. Sherlock’s head was clearer than it had been in days. A good case really solved all problems.
“Shut your trap, you git”, he told him, gently. Sherlock, stunned into silence, stared at their clasped hands like it was the first time he had seen them. Somehow, John had managed to find the only thing to bring this gigantic brain network to a screeching halt.
Hair-Loving Guy claps his hands in enthusiastic approval. “Yes! A little princess only turns two once in her life! She deserves to party like the gorgeous queen she will become!”
Rosie is, though, so she matches them in enthusiasm. She gurgles and waves at each of them, while they swarm around her like he’s the most precious thing in the room (which… she is). John thought Sherlock might vanish mysteriously as soon as they entered the flat (through the window to avoid an encounter, presumably) yet he stays right where he is, sipping his tea and pretending to read an article in a scientific journal, while deducing their houseguests quietly.
“How can you be so sure of that? How do you know you won’t get tired of me…. Needing you? Of… caring for me?”
“We’re done here.” Sherlock softly pulled his blogger closer to him, who gratefully sagged against him. The detective felt eyes upon his back, until Lestrade’s hushed orders made them disappear. Silently, all the Yarders left the crime scene to give the pair some privacy. Lestrade squeezed Sherlock’s shoulder on his way out in an appreciative gesture, and Sherlock nodded in his direction.
Sherlock had developed a soft spot for the people surrounding him after Euros had happened. The changes were minimal, invisible for the unschooled eye- but John had become fluent in speaking Sherlock. It was almost as if the experience made him realize that he, in fact, wasn't so much of a sociopath as he would like to be. There were times where he looked almost lost- a complexion so un-Sherlock like that it genuinely hurt John to see his friend like that.
“I didn’t really mind” he started tentatively, still figuring the shift of mood out. “I like your hugs, why would I suddenly dislike them?” A small pause. Considering. “If it’s about the new cologne you’re using, don’t worry, I’ve come accommodated to the new set of olfactory sensation a week ago…“. Despite his uneasiness, John couldn’t help but give Sherlock his ‘You’re an idiot in your own special way’ look that always,
Of course, he had picked up the signs, but thought perhaps John just felt a bit under the weather, like he had the past three days. Maybe, if he had taken down his ‘genius detective’ attitude long enough to take a look at his friend properly, he would have shortened this experience for his troubled friend. But he didn’t. The realization punched him in the gut.
It was the third night spend in that fashion when it happened. John had a nightmare. Sherlock realized the telltale sounds instantaneously. He thought the doctor had overcome the deep psychological problem, but apparently, they still happened from time to time. Maybe, he’d been having them the whole time since he had been back. Maybe he had just managed to hide it. Maybe Sherlock just didn’t notice it, because he tried to give John the privacy he seemed to desire. Maybe he could have helped John again. If only he chose to notice.
“Oh.”
In the moment the doctor’s eyes flew open, his dominant fist connected forcefully with Sherlock’s jaw. There was a sickening sound when Sherlock’s teeth crashed together, and a gush of blood splattered through his now split-open lower lip. The detective staggered backwards with the force of it, crashing into the doorframe. John was heaving, gulping in deep breaths of air, as if he’d been suffocated. Sherlock was too shocked to move for some seconds, rooted right to his cramped spot against the wood, a sharp blinding pain throbbing through his whole lower jaw.
John should probably be annoyed at their indecency and total respect for their privacy, but just couldn’t care less when Sherlock hummed happily and even casually chatted with Lestrade once the detective returned with a possibly buzzing Rosie trailing at his side. All the while, his partner’s protective arms never left him. John didn’t feel one tad embarrassed for not really participating in the conversation and just leaning against Sherlock’s warm chest. Rosie was, as anticipated, totally gone on the little bunnies and went on happily pestering John about her absolute need for a pet. John declined every time, but Rosie was far too happy to really care about it, trying to charm Lestrade in buying her a bunny instead. The detective wavered, and compromised to buying her a stuffed animal some time. John was glad Rosie seemed to like Lestrade very much; so he was a protentional babysitter for the evenings he’d like to spend with his partner alone.
. How he still managed to be smug, in a breathtaking moment like this, was beyond the lovesick doctor. “Took you long enough” A pleasant rumble against his parted lips was all it took and John lost it. Before he could stop it a, definitely not high-pitched giggle, small laugh (which bared close resemblance to a giggle…. Only it was manly as hell) bubbled in his throat. The look on the detective’s face was absolutely priceless. “Are you…. Are you in shock? Shall I get the blanket-“                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 “No” John tried to regain his composure, but the happiness spilled out of him like a waterfall. Somewhere deep inside John entertained the possibility that he had gone completely bonkers. But oh, he didn’t
since he returned from the war? Why couldn’t he be
Sherlock rolled his eyes in a fond kind of way. “Yes,
His friend just looks at him with an arched eyebrow but doesn’t say anything. John’s already used to the evenings where Sherlock is mostly non-verbal, and the friendly silence isn’t unwelcomed today. It settles the loud thoughts in John’s head.
