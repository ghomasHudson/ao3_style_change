The two of them fall into an easy rhythm. It's clear that Cas spends at least some time in the kitchen like Dean. The way he easily cracks the eggs with one hand is pretty impressive and Dean will have to have Cas teach him that trick sometime. While Cas is mixing in the flour Dean takes the opportunity to flick some flour from the bowl into his face. The resulting murderous glare is completely ruined by the splattering of flour in his hair and on his face. Dean bursts into quiet laughter, mindful of the other sleeping guests still, and clutches at his stomach when it starts to hurt. Cas’ lips start to twitch and it only takes a couple more seconds until he too is laughing.
“Yeah, I heard ya. You know I can’t do that, Sammy. I have that big Christmas piece this year and I have to go down to Aspen for it. I’ve told you how big this piece is and how much I need it,” Dean says, hoping his brother will drop the topic now and leave it somewhere far, far behind them. It’s not like Dean is even lying or making this up! He really does have to go to Aspen to write a Christmas article for Roman Magazine. Dean practically begged his boss, so that he would be considered to take the piece on. And that's saying something, because Dean Winchester does not beg for anything. His boss is a total dick too, both metaphorically and literally a dick. Let no one say Dick Roman was inappropriately named.
Grabbing his bags Castiel makes his way out of the room. He takes one last look before shutting the door and turning towards the stairs only to find Carol standing there, confusion clear on her face.
Carol and Chris stand in front of the fireplace admiring the newly framed picture of the two of them. It had been lost for so long and they are so thankful Castiel was able to find it.
“What?!” Dean snaps and turns to find a shocked, and slightly offended, Charlie standing behind him.
“Sweet jesus this mattress is incredible,” he nearly moans. It doesn't take him long at all to find a comfortable position. The lamp flicks off and the mattress shifts as Cas gets comfortable and what really should be an awkward situation it doesn't feel that way at all. Cas was right, there is plenty of space for them to share without any wayward limbs touching. Silence surrounds them once more and it only takes a few minutes for Dean to drift off into the best sleep he has had all week.
“I’m your only brother, Jerk.” Aaaannnnd there is that perfected bitch face again. The thought brings a smile to Dean’s face, he loves annoying his little brother. There’s a little shuffling on the other end and Dean assumes it’s Eileen, his brother’s wife, trying to make Sam feel better. The slight kissing sound a moment later confirms that thought. Knowing his brother, Sam probably has a dopey grin on his face now. Damn, that woman is way too good for his little brother.
Castiel gives him a grateful smile and Dean can see some of the tension drain from the man’s body. They quickly exchange numbers and thank Jody for her time before ushering the girls outside. Dean had almost forgotten about the weather during their time inside, but the blast of icy air is a harsh reminder of why he was late himself. The roads are a blanket of white with tire tracks and footprints zig-zagging around with more snow gently falling from the sky.
“Thank you,” she smiles innocently before practically skipping to the next hole. Dean follows behind with his own small smile in place. The teenager may be annoying at times but he can’t help but love her. And he's happy to see her feeling better. He knows they’ll have to talk eventually, but for now he is happy to just give her this and hopes she has a good time.
“I want to hear more about this, but I gotta get back to work. I’m picking the girls up after school today. Would you want to come over for dinner tonight?”
With his thoughts running wild about a future with a guy he’s not even with, Castiel is incredibly grateful when a beautiful young woman walks around the corner to see what's going on.
“Yeah, alright,” there is a heavy sigh from the other end of the line causing guilt to settle heavy in Dean’s stomach. “I guess we will see you for New Year’s then.”
Cas makes his way up into the attic to see if he can find the certificate that can save the inn. There are dozens of boxes filled with old decorations and pictures and papers. It's so overwhelming that Castiel has no idea where to start. The first box he sees is as good as it's going to get and he resigns himself to a long night of research.
“Does Harrison Ford count?” Dean deflects with his normal humor. Cas huffs in response which brings a small smile to Dean’s face. “No I have not. There's not many things I’m afraid of, besides flying obviously, but falling in love is definitely pretty high on the list.”
The rest of the day passes in easy laughter and time in the water. Dean gets the chance to see Cas shirtless again and it still takes his breath away even though he sees it nearly every night. There's just something about seeing Cas dive into the water and pop back up, shaking his head and sending droplets of water in every direction. What really makes Dean’s mouth go dry, though, is when Cas opens his eyes and the blue is so vibrant and captivating that Dean gets lost in a trance every time.
“Alright. Go do what you have to do and text me later. If you want me to take her for the night I have no problem with that,” Dean offers. He knows they still don't know each other very well, but Cas looks like he really needs time to himself to figure stuff out and
He double checks Emma has her puffy coat on and is bundled up before leading the way to his truck. Cas explains to his daughter that she's going to go home with the Winchesters for a little while. The girls are ecstatic about the extra time they get to spend together and don't question the situation. Once Dean makes sure both are secured in the back seat he shuts the door and turns his attention back to Castiel.
“Thank you everyone for joining us here today. I know you all have been working hard the last two years on bringing this hotel back to life and I can’t thank you enough. This project was just an idea I had for many years. It was a mess of passing thoughts that I eventually started writing down and keeping track of. Somehow it became this thing I couldn’t stop thinking about and needed to do. Luckily I knew a pretty handy contractor that was crazy enough to agree to this massive project.” Cas turns to look back at Dean, his face so full of love it makes Dean’s heart sing. “Dean, I will forever be grateful for everything you have done for me. You helped me make my life mine again and showed me just how much is out there in the world. None of this would have been possible without you. So thank you, Dean. Thank you for making my dream come true. Thank you for keeping this family together. And thank you for making me the happiest I have ever been. I love you so much.”
“I know, it's just that we're new here. Just moved in a couple weeks ago,” the man replies in that same deep voice that drew Dean’s attention in the first place.
Dean remembers being so mad when Castiel was telling him about their past. Everyone knows you never leave a child alone, especially when they are so young. Honestly Dean still has trouble leaving Emma all alone and she's fifteen!
Dean is dying and there is absolutely nowhere to hide. Benny’s boat is big, but it’s not that big. Plus Dean loves watching the ocean move, so he accepts his fate of having his attractive best friend shirtless a few feet away from him and enjoys the view (the ocean, not Cas). The gentle waves are soothing and the color of the water is beautiful. A light blue green mix that sparkles when the sun hits it just right.
They reach the house and Emma is still going on and on about something that has to do with a tiger. Dean lost track of the conversation a few minutes ago but he’s not too worried about it since he knows he will hear it again at dinner. The three of them exit the truck and enter the home, kicking off their shoes at the door and wandering into the kitchen for an afternoon snack.
Other letters kids write that all they want are for their parents to stop fighting. Or a little bit of extra cash so that their family could have a real meal for once. It breaks Dean’s heart and forces him to remember how lucky he is and was growing up. His life wasn’t perfect but he never had to worry about where his next meal would come from or if he would never have a roof over his head. Dean reads through a few more letters before he reads one and it hits way too close to home for him and he is forced to stop.
“We did, but Dean, this is what I was wanting! Something big to take my mind off everything and I think it will be fun!” Cas explains, smiling slightly. In the daylight, Dean can now see the slight hesitancy his friend has, even if what he is saying is true. This thing is huge, bigger than anything any of them have ever done. Dean knows that no matter how much work has to go into this, they are going to see it through to the end. He nods his head and Cas smiles at his acceptance.
“Sure. We can just be the new Jesse and Cesar,” Dean replies, only half joking. The more they talked to their two hosts the more Dean liked them. They learned more about their lives and Jesse shared that they didn’t come from very supportive families or a safe place in the states for a gay couple so they just left and came to the island and have been loving life ever since.
Dean looks up from the plans he's going over with a couple of his guys. He finds Mark waving him over, so with a sigh he quickly finishes going over the plans then heads over to see what on Earth Mark wants.
“Sure I’ll miss soccer, but I mean it’s just a game I tried because it looked fun,” Emma says easily and Dean can tell she’s telling the truth. “As for friends, I have Claire. Really she’s the only one I need.”
Dean watches his daughter make her way to two kids standing by the cubbies. They all smile at each other and Dean knows Emma will be just fine. He looks up and finds the teacher also watching the three before she goes over to them. Dean can just barely hear her introduce herself as Mrs. Mills and Emma replying back shyly with her name. Mrs. Mills shows Emma her own cubby where she can put her backpack and lunch. Emma gives her a bright smile and does just that before turning her attention back to the other kids.
“We love you too,” Emma and Claire say into the space between them all. Dean kisses both girls on the forehead before kissing Cas again. When the four of them break apart they find everyone watching them with smiles on their faces and even a few (Benny) are wiping tears from their eyes.
Dean settles down and is smiling up at the ceiling before the rest of the day's events catch up to him. The roller coaster of emotions he went through the last twelve hours. The frustration of dealing with yet another problem and then the good news from Charlie only to come crashing back down after seeing Cas.
“Dean, somehow we didn't pay the electricity bill so they’re asking for $4,000 by the end of the day or they’ll shut the power off.”
“Oh yes! I was wondering if you wanted to read my article tonight after the festival?” Dean asks with a slight blush coloring his cheeks. He would never admit it out loud but he really is nervous about Castiel not returning his feelings. But then there are moments like right now where Cas is looking at him like he’s the only person in the room and the only one that matters and their hands are still pressed together.
Dean’s breath catches in his throat. This is the one topic they have avoided for all of the years they have known each other. They never talk about their love lives or anything like that. Dean knows why he has avoided the topic over the years, but he doesn’t know why Cas has. “What are you talking about Cas?”
dating Cas. That weekend with Sammy in town Dean told him everything. How it started innocently enough with just the girls hanging out after school, how that progressed to dinners and movie nights at Dean’s, and then the lake trip. That's what clued Sam in on how far his brother had really fallen. Sam left with a sympathetic, yet encouraging, smile and his reassurance that things will work out eventually.
“We have a roll away cot I can bring in for you guys, if that'll make it better?” Mrs. Winters suggests with a hopeful smile.
“Hey guys, I was just going to step outside for a breath of fresh air real quick,” He says through clenched teeth praying to whatever god is out there that he doesn't look as sick as he feels. Cas stares at him and Dean can see him searching for the right words to say. Dean’s not sure how Cas is feeling exactly, but it's obvious there's an internal argument going on by the way Cas’ eye keeps flicking back and forth between Deans. Not wanting to make this any harder on any of them Dean makes the decision for them. “It's okay. You can go.”
Dean takes a moment to notice how much Claire has grown since he first met her. He remembers the shy angry eight year old his daughter befriended and honestly that much hasn't changed. She's still pretty shy and still pretty angry. No one can blame her for any of that. The girl hasn’t had it easy. She's gotten strong though. Claire isn’t afraid to say what she thinks even if it hurts and she knows what she wants. Dean’s pretty sure she wants to just get away. Why she came to him, he has no idea.
“Dean!” a high pitched voice calls to him from one of the poolside chaises. Dean pauses his stride and closes his eyes before turning to face Claire. She stares at his packed bag with her brows pulled together in an expression so similar to her father’s it breaks Dean’s heart all over again. “Where are you going?”
daughter. I’m the one that tells her what to do,” Cas growls. Both Claire and Dean tense up in anger. Before Claire can snap at her dad, Dean widens his stance and crosses his arms over his chest, letting the full extent of his anger from the last day show.
Three o’clock rolls around and Dean leaves the site in Benny’s hands while he hurries to the school to pick up the girls. When he gets there he sees them waiting outside, sitting on one of the benches engaged deeply in a conversation. There are a few other students and teachers wandering about, waiting for the rest of the parents to arrive. Dean waves to the girls’ teacher through the car window which prompts her to nudge the girls in his direction. Emma looks up with a big smile on her face and immediately heads his way with Claire trailing right behind.
“What are you talking about Claire?” Cas asks, tearing his eyes from Dean to watch his daughter cautiously.
“Nah, you go ahead,” Dean replies, leaning back and closing his eyes. Cas stands up using Dean’s shoulder for support and gives a gentle squeeze before heading into the villa. The phantom touch on his shoulder that lingers leaves Dean feeling like he already lost something he never had.
Thick black frames perch on the bridge of Castiel’s nose marking his eyes bigger and bluer. Something Dean didn’t think was possible. He always knew Castiel’s eyes were blue, they’re really freaking hard to not notice. Now though, they are a mix of dark blues from the ocean and light blues from the sky. Coming together to form a burst of color that draws you in and drowns you until you don't know which way is up.
“I thought I scared you away after not understanding your jokes and being a grump after I saw that one family. I didn’t think you would want to be with someone as boring as me,” Cas explains.
“What's up dad?” Emma asks while popping a few grapes into her mouth. She inherited her father's awful table manners, much to his amusement and everyone else’s dismay.
But words refuse to come out of his gaping mouth. He watches as Cas’ head falls forward in defeat and his shoulders slump with the weight of the world upon them.
“What's all this raucous I hear?” a different voice comes from the hallway. Castiel turns in time to see an older man round the corner in a wheelchair with a scowl firmly set on his face. “What the hell are ya doin’ here, ya idjit?”
“Mind if I cut in?” Ketch asks in his smarmy British accent. Dean is so in shock from the turn of events he can't do anything, but watch as Ketch grabs Castiel’s hand and pulls him away from Dean. Ketch pulls Castiel into his arms and they start dancing similarly to what Dean and him were doing only moments before. Castiel looks at Dean with something in his eyes that Dean can’t make out clearly. Not able to watch them anymore Dean turns away and finds the closest source of alcohol.
“Not quite Emma,” Cas says before Dean snaps. “I know a fun game that we can play that will make the time go by faster if you want to play?”
“I was unaware you didn’t enjoy flying,” Cas’ deep gravelly voice is barely heard over the roaring in Dean’s own head. Dean, not wanting to waste precious air on talking, remains silent and closes his eyes, trying to picture a white sand beach and bright blue water. It helps that their destination is a tropical island in the Bahamas which is exactly that. He can’t wait to sit his ass down into the sun warmed sand with an ice cold beer in his hand enjoying a relaxing vacation for once in his life.
Cas thinks back to all of the time they spent together the last week. All of the soft touches. The shy smiles. The laughter. The happiness. The love. Dean loves him. And Castiel is pretty sure he loves him too.
He sets down his half eaten burger and fixes Claire with a serious look. “Please open up to me Claire? It's driving me crazy not knowing what caused you to run away this morning.”
Mrs. Winters finds him lying defeated on one of the couches in one of the many sitting rooms the inn has to offer.
“Well you don’t have to worry about anything because we are both already enrolled in online classes for next term,” Claire states like that’s not a bombshell that just dropped in Dean’s kitchen.
“Um, yeah,” Nice going Winchester, at least try to act like you have a brain. “Yes, the kids already know their groups and I have two parent volunteers to go with one group and I'll go with the other.”
Dean makes sure he has his keys and everything else with him before walking to his truck. Claire follows behind and gets into the passenger seat without a word. The silence fills the car, not awkward by any means but it is strained. Suddenly an idea pops into Dean’s head and he starts the truck with a small smile on his face. Fifteen minutes later he pulls into the parking lot and finds a spot before turning to look at Claire with a giant smile on his face.
“Hey guys, I was just going to step outside for a breath of fresh air real quick,” Dean says and his voice is off too. Somethings wrong but Cas doesn’t know what it is. He wants to stay and figure it out, make sure Dean is okay. Ketch has different plans though because Cas can feel him getting agitated and impatient. Dean's face softens slightly and his shoulders drop from where they were held tight with tension. “It’s okay. You can go.”
Dean leads them out into the hallway and to the main area where most of the crew is working hard. With an encouraging nod Dean tells Cas to head for the villa and he will join him later with some food.
Instantly dread creeps into Dean’s heart. It's Emma. It has to be Emma. Who else would it be? What could be so wrong that she couldn’t call him and had to come down to the construction site? Also, why isn’t she in school??
“Oh shut up Sasquatch,” Dean glowers at his brother but there is no heat behind his words. They join the rest of the family and serve up their plates. Cas was worried there wouldn’t be enough food since they are technically unexpected guests but Eileen assures him they have plenty to go around even with Dean there. Her comment earns another half hearted protest on Dean’s part but the second he bites into the homemade bun all is forgiven.
With a heavy sigh Castiel finally looks at Dean and he can see hints of sadness swirling in the blue seas. “I was supposed to spend the holidays with Arthur and his family this year.”
The more the girls hung out, the more the dads hung out. Which is awesome for Dean since he really doesn’t hang out with many people his age. On Cas’ rare days off (seriously the guy works too hard) the two pairs would get together and just hang out. Most of the time they would go to Dean’s house and let the girls play while Dean and Cas talk. It has always been hard for Dean to make friends. Sure he's an outgoing guy and has no problem talking to people, but normally they are just random strangers and they tend to stay strangers. He has very few people he would actually consider to be his friends. Cas quickly went from Emma’s best friend’s dad to Dean’s best friend.
The deeper they get into the place, the more issues they find. Cracked floors, walls, and ceilings. Water damage almost everywhere. And the basement... Don't even get Dean started on the basement. The place smells like something (hopefully not someone) died down there and the whole place is just one gigantic mess. Dean can’t get a read on Cas’ reaction to the place either, which is weird since Dean normally can read Cas pretty well. They make their way back out to fresh sunny air and find Benny waiting for them.
“Really Cas? Have we not been co parenting the two of them for years now? Do you not trust me with Claire? Have I not proven how much I love Claire? How far I am willing to go to make sure she remains safe, happy, and well cared for?” Dean demands, his anger dripping off of every word. “I see Claire as my own. I have for as long as I can remember. I love her just like I love Emma. The two of them are the most important people in my life. And now you’re telling me that you’re the only one that gets a say in what Claire gets to do? I have raised her just as much as you have, if not more.”
Taking a few minutes to get himself back under control, Castiel takes one last look at his festive apartment and goes through one of his breathing exercises. Once he feels calmer and is absolutely sure Ketch would be gone, he walks out his door and locks it behind him. His cab is waiting for him when he reaches the street, and then he’s off to the airport at last.
He sees Chris walk to the main entrance and greet someone. They hand him a few letters and then a giant sack. His curiosity peaked Dean watches as Chris brings the giant sack to the table in front of him and dump it out. Hundreds and hundreds of letters come pouring out of the sack. Dean catches a few addressed to Santa Claus.
Cas wouldn’t do any of that if he didn’t return Dean’s feelings right? Cas doesn’t have to be in love with him back right away, Dean isn’t expecting that. But if Cas would give him a chance? A chance to prove that Dean can be a good partner and treat Castiel right like he deserves then Dean would be the happiest person in the world.
“I haven’t slept with anyone in years Cas! I have no idea what you’re talking about!” Dean doesn’t even realize his accidental confession. It's true though, he hasn’t even been able to look at another person since Cas came into his life.
The guilt inside Dean threatens to choke him and it's only thanks to Claire's small arms around his waist squeezing him that he is able to continue breathing.
“Castiel, we just order from the Chinese place around the corner. Super easy. No need for the pie or whatever,” Ketch waves his hand around before turning his attention back to his phone. Cas stares at him in shock. That sounds like the absolute worst way to spend Christmas.
Sam and Eileen’s coworker turned romance relationship had reaffirmed Dean’s belief in love at first sight. Dean remembers thinking there’s no way the firecracker with long wavy brown hair could actually be interested in his nerdy little brother the first time he met her. He tried to convince her to date him, the much cooler and more handsome brother, but she wouldn’t go for it. Said something about having a “thing” for the nerdy type. After spending the weekend with the couple, it was quite clear that they were perfect for each other. Dean couldn’t be more happy for his little brother, even if he does tease him for how whipped he is all the time.
Benny gently guides the boat to shore, waves lapping against the side. Claire and Emma hop out as soon as the boat stops moving and race up the sandy beach to the hotel property. Benny hangs back to finish up with the boat while Dean and Cas follow the girls at a much slower pace, taking in everything as they go. Everything is a disaster. The pool is filled with  disgusting murky green water with branches and who knows what else. All of the walkways are covered with sand and debris. Most of the small villas they can see are battered and broken. Dean looks around as dread settles heavy in his stomach.
Dean sits on the floors in front of the fireplace with a giant fluffy pink tutu around his waist. Mary and Liz sit around him in their matching tutus playing with their new dolls. He loves his nieces, he really does, but they're really pushing their limits of what he can handle right now. There is glitter
Cas continues on, walking towards the main hotel block which houses the kitchen, a dozen hotel rooms, dining area, lounge, and everything else one would need to successfully run a hotel. Dean follows close behind as they enter through the front doors. The inside is just as bad as the outside. Abandoned items are strewn about: broken chairs and tables, old moldy mattresses, and a whole bunch of other stuff Dean doesn’t even want to get close to identifying. An old musty smell hangs over the entire place, causing Dean to wrinkle his nose and wish to get out as soon as he can. Cas keeps pushing forward though and Dean will follow him anywhere.
It's only minutes later when both baskets are empty and Dean is tempted to ask for more even if he's already feeling pretty full. Cesar and Jesse lead them to a golf cart, luckily with enough seating for all of them, and they head out on the gravel road to their home for the next week.
“Shurley Engineering, this is Becky,” a high pitched voice comes through the phone's speakers, causing Dean to cringe. Shurley Engineering has never been one of his favorite firms to work with. Their over energetic receptionist just adds to his already monumentally high levels of dread about working with them. Running a hand down his face, Dean pastes on his best customer service smile, even if Becky can’t see him, and attitude before responding.
Dean happily accepts and his mood brightens immediately. Sometimes Castiel wishes a simple candy cane would make everything better again. He accepts one anyway and puts it in his pocket to save for later.
“Damn brotha, I’m sorry. You’re welcome to stay as long as you need to,” Benny says, patting him on the arm.
“Good night Dean,” Cas’ soft voice breaks the silence, and entirely against his will Dean’s entire mind calms at just hearing those few words.
“Thank you,” he says in a very stoic manner. Dean falters a little at the response and focuses his attention back on Emma. His smile returns when he sees her sitting next to the other blond girl, both smiling and talking. Leave it to his daughter to seek out the new kid and instantly become friends with them.
project. Not hers. Yours. You are the one who has put your heart and soul into this thing. Your plans are amazing. You don't need to change every idea you have just because Meg doesn’t agree with it. She is not the one in charge of this thing okay? This is yours and yours alone. Got it?”
“No, that's not going to work,” Dean protests. The idea of Cas moving out of the villa scares him. No more sleeping next to Cas and waking up with them sometimes plastered together from head to toe.
Dean glances at the guy next to him hoping to share the experience of their girls hopefully becoming friends. Instead of watching the girls like Dean the other guy has turned and moved a few steps away.
Protests sound from around the room, Dean and Castiel included. A raise of Roman’s hand quickly quiets everyone.
“It's done!” Cas says excitedly. Dean blinks his eyes a few times trying to figure out what Cas is talking about... when he remembers the villa! His eyes widen in realization and Cas starts nodding his head enthusiastically before grabbing Dean’s wrist and leading the way to the small villa on the beach. Claire and Emma stand outside, bouncing on their toes in anticipation.
“Looked pretty intense too,” Dean mumbles. He doesn't want to picture the way his best friend had Meg pinned against the wall with her arms wrapped tightly around his neck.
“Ugh Mr. Winchester you’re giraffe-ing me crazy with all of these puns,” Cas replies while pointing over his shoulder to the giraffe habitat behind them. Dean turns to stare at the man with shock in his bright green eyes. Then the biggest smile Cas has seen all day splits across the handsome man's face and it’s like pure sunshine.  The kids sense the switch of attention and head over to the giraffes while the two men stand and stare at each other with smiles on their faces.
“Well I suppose there is the Christmas Eve festival we host here at the inn each year. The whole town attends and we have food and drinks and music and dancing. It really is a wonderful time,” Mrs. Winters describes the party.
Castiel finishes his burger quickly and wipes his hands on a napkin before pinning Dean with one of his rare gummy smiles. “Thank you Dean, those make me very happy.”
Dean fist pumps next to him as Castiel stares at Charlie in shock. “Him?! Why does he get the biggest assignment?”
“Oh Dean, no that wasn’t it at all! I saw a family that was taunting the other cats, which we don’t tolerate at all,  and they left their trash on the ground. I didn’t even hear you say that,” Cas explains with a pleading look.
“Yes, Cas I really mean that,” Dean says with a soft smile. He moves his hand to slide through Cas’ hair before settling on the back of his neck. The two men get lost in each other’s gazes, the rest of the world falling away around them.
“He shoots! And he scores!” Dean exclaims as he tosses a shirt into his duffle bag. He wanders around his cramped apartment sniffing shirts as he goes trying to find something clean. Normally he’s not this bad, he used to pride himself on a clean and neat apartment. When he first moved into the place it was a complete dump but living in New York is expensive as hell and it was all he could afford at the time. Eventually, he put in the time and money (when he had it) into making it look halfway decent and now he's pretty proud of the place he lives. For how much he pays rent, Dean’s got quite a large apartment which he absolutely loves. Although right now you wouldn’t be able to tell with all the junk and trash laying around. Unfortunately, work has gotten more and more hectic the last couple of years and he has slacked off on his organization skills. Something he regrets immensely right now since it's hard to distinguish between his clean and dirty laundry. On the bright side, there is always some kind of take out leftovers to be found in his fridge!
“Most of them have been following along on Insta and everything since the beginning so when I posted this morning that we are now taking bookings they didn't even hesitate. Look there are two more now,” Charlie points to the little icon in the corner with a small number two and Dean stares in awe.
Seven months in, with who knows how many more to go, and Dean is in hell. Day after day, they are destroying one thing and fixing another. The list is endless and new things get added to it every time Dean looks at it. The crew is tired. Dean is tired. Everyone is tired.
Dean finds it so peaceful camping at the lake and even though he has an amazing memory foam mattress back at home, he always sleeps so well under the stars. He lets the quiet sound of the lake's waves washing over the gravel shore and the crickets singing lull him into a peaceful sleep. The only thing that would make the night any more comfortable would be if he and Cas were curled around one another, but Dean knows just how wrong that would be so he does his best to enjoy the comfort of his daughter next to him. If he just so happens to dream about a certain dark haired blue eyed man, no one needs to know but him.
Dean can feel someone’s gaze on him but he refuses to take his eyes off the seat in front of him. He starts counting his breathing. In for six, hold for four, out for six. He repeats the motions as the engines turn on and the plane starts to move. His eyes squeeze shut and his grip tightens on the armrest.
“But it's a hip-potato-mus! You would think they would eat potatoes if it's in their name,” Dean grins at the other man. Once again the kids giggle around him and this time Dean focuses solely on their reaction and not the attractive man next to him. When they move on from the hungry, hungry hippos, Dean is proud of himself. It’s a small thing, but it still counts. He knows he's funny and his kids know he's funny.
Later that night the girls are curled up together on the pull out bed and Benny is passed out in his room while Dean and Cas make themselves as comfortable as they possibly can while sleeping out on the bow of the boat. Benny’s boat only has the two beds, and there was no way Dean was going to allow the girls to sleep out in the open, so it was clear they would get the spare bed. Benny offered to share his since he has a queen, but Dean turned down the offer since that would leave Cas out in the open by himself. Cas said he would be fine but truthfully Dean just doesn’t want to turn down the chance to sleep close to Cas. The front of the boat isn’t very big and they are both over six feet tall and well built men.
“And what happens to the person that doesn’t get the most traffic?” Dean asks hesitantly. For once Castiel is grateful for the other man's presence, asking the question that he doesn't want to ask.
He has a lot of money from a trust fund, which Dean teased him endlessly about when he discovered that fact. However, Cas is always quick to remind Dean that he hasn’t once touched the money. Castiel told him that it feels like his parents just threw money at him instead of attention or affection while growing up, so he has always hated his parents' money and refuses to touch it. His mother owns a very successful law firm which turned into the family business of sorts with three of Cas’ siblings now working there. His father is a published author with a widely popular sci-fi series that brought in even more money to the family. With two successful parents that are entirely focused on their separate careers, it doesn’t leave much time, if any, to raise kids. So it was nanny after nanny for the Novak children.
“Positive. Don’t give up hope yet Dean-o, I can see you already blaming yourself for messing this up. How about this? A couple of us go to this bar every Friday night and Castiel promised he would go with us this time. Why don't you show up and then maybe you will have another chance with him?” Gabe suggests.
“Dean, thank you again. You have no idea how much this means to me,” Cas says, his breath coming out in small puffs. Dean takes in his exhausted face again, the cold making the bags under his eyes stand out even more than before.
Dean knew Castiel was going to file for divorce months ago. He didn’t realize that he had the papers though. Cas had made a plan to sit Claire down to talk to her about it before he went any further in the process. They both knew that the situation would upset Claire, but he had no idea it would cause her to think that her own father would abandon her!
It only takes a few minutes for the coffee to kick in which Dean uses to study the man in front of him. Dean doesn’t remember the last time he was this comfortable with and didn’t mind sitting in a silence. Usually Dean is the one to fill the space with noise when it gets to be too quiet. But with Cas he is perfectly content to sit next to him for hours without a word said between the two. Dean has also never introduced anybody to his family but spending the day with them yesterday with Cas by his side was a dream come true. Everyone accepted Cas immediately and Dean could tell how much it meant to Cas to be surrounded by people this time of year.
“Hey there Claire bear,” Cas crouches down to pull his daughter more into his arms and closes his eyes in contentment. Dean watches the pair with a soft smile on his face. He remembers it took a while for Claire to warm up to the move, but once she did Cas’ relationship with her got stronger. Dean has a feeling that it has something to do with the personal problems Cas hasn’t mentioned much about. Cas told him that Emma has been a huge help too, which made Dean’s chest swell with pride.
Cas flicks his eyes back and forth between the two men not having a single idea of what to do. “Um Ketch this is Dean, Dean this is Arthur Ketch.”
“Dude, what is with you? I’ve never seen you get this worked up about a guy before,” Sam says while watching Dean pace across the room.
“Meg. Cas.” Dean keeps his voice even, looking between the two through steely eyes and making sure his mask is firmly in place. There is no way in hell he is going to give Meg the satisfaction of how much walking in on them is affecting him. He’s hurt. He’s pissed. He’s disappointed. But he’s not surprised in all honesty. Turning around to walk back out the door, Dean calls over his shoulder. “Sorry to interrupt, don't let me stop you.”
“Eh one more kiss wouldn’t hurt,” Dean says puckering his lips. Cas gives in, of course, and softly kisses the teacher again. With a satisfied smirk Dean hops on the bus and gives the all good to the driver.
Dean locates their spot and parks Baby before stepping out and breathing in the fresh air. There is nothing like going out into the forest and enjoying some quality time in the wilderness to embrace the arrival of summer. Ever since Emma was old enough to enjoy it, Dean has taken her out to the lake every year. Somehow Emma forgets and is always shocked when they arrive. Her surprise and excitement causes Dean to smile from ear to ear until his cheeks start to hurt.
The rest of the journey down to the little island in the Bahamas is smooth sailing for all of them. They move from the plane to a large boat that carries both supplies and passengers to the islands south of the mainland. Dean spends the boat ride staring out at the vast ocean with Emma at his side. He doesn’t remember the last time either of them saw the ocean, let alone on a boat sailing to a tropical island. These kinds of vacations are something Dean has never made the time for. They always have the trip to the lake and a couple other road trips to different parts of the country. But anything that requires flying, Dean has never wanted to do.
Dean laughs, a very self deprecating sound. “Froze really. Didn’t know what to do except stare. Meg noticed me eventually and I just walked away after that.”
With a nod, Benny heads outside to gather the rest of the crew while Dean calls upon everyone inside. A few minutes later Dean has nearly twenty sets of eyes focusing on him. He doesn’t like the attention but he is good at his job which includes leading crews like this.
He gets halfway down the hallway when he hears his name called from behind him. Already feeling the tears prickle at his eyes Dean keeps walking, praying that he can get somewhere safe before he completely breaks down.
Dean has never regretted something more in his life than this moment right here. Why he thought this was a good idea will forever confuse him. At the time he thought it would be freeing and awesome! Now all he feels is trapped and his mood is so not awesome.
“It's probably carollers,” Bobby grumbles. Dean gets up and heads to the door expecting to see a few of the neighborhood members. Instead, when he opens the door he is shocked into silence by the sight of Cas standing on the doorstep smiling at him.
Y'all! This chapter was so much fun to write and was originally what I had planned for this story but then it grew into something bigger which I'm okay with!
Emma turns to look at Dean with a blank look on her face. Dean tries once again to hide his nerves, but he's pretty sure him chewing on his bottom lip gives him away. He can't tell exactly what his daughter is thinking and he starts to panic.
“Dean are you alright?” Castiel asks from the king sized bed after Dean hasn’t stopped shifting around the last couple minutes.
“You might be able to. Are there any traditions or special events that go on in this town during this time of year?” He asks in his professional voice.
“I know it’s not ideal, but it is a king so there is plenty of room and we wouldn’t fit very well in the twins and plus this is more comfortable than the boat and… wait, did you say okay?” Cas rambles before cutting off short. Dean throws his head back in laughter at the shocked look on his friend's face.
Now he stands on the corner across from the school with his daughter at his side practically jumping up and down. Dean takes a deep breath, looks both ways, grabs hold of Emma’s hand, and crosses the street. Ready to take on the next year with his daughter growing up all too quickly. They find the class lists posted on the front windows then make their way to the correct classroom. Dean made the mistake a few years ago of not checking the list beforehand and getting lost in the halls before one of the staff members took pity on him and showed them the right way. He is an absolute pro at this whole 'dropping his kid off on the first day of school' thing. At least that's what he tells himself so he doesn’t break down in the middle of the hallway saying goodbye to his precious little girl.
“Hey Cas, what would bears be without bees?” Dean asks with a smile lighting up his face. Castiel thinks to himself for a little, Dean has never done this one before. He will also admit he’s quite curious about the answer, so Cas indulges the teacher in his game.
“Oh good, we’re moving! All of this waiting has been un-bear-able,” Dean chuckles along with a few of his students. The pun quickly turns Cas’ smile into a glare directed at the man. Of course, it doesn’t help matters at all. Dean’s smile just grows bigger from his reaction. Cas lets out a sigh and continues walking, he knows he shouldn’t let the man’s antics get to him. He makes a promise to himself to try harder not to react to Dean’s puns and just enjoy the tour with the students. If Cas is being honest with himself though, he is a little curious to see if Dean has any new puns from the previous year. You would think he would’ve  run out of new puns by now, but no such luck. So far, Cas has heard all of these in previous years. Dean always has at least one new one each year though. With the tour starting it is a slight relief knowing that Dean has to follow in the back to make sure they don’t lose any kids, so Cas gets a small break.
There are people everywhere, way more than he thought could fit in the small inn. Some are sitting on the comfy looking couches reading the paper or a book. Others are in the small dining room already eating breakfast. Dean sees most of them with coffee and immediately perks up. He goes in search and almost jumps for joy when he finds the heavenly beverage. There are several different flavors available so he chooses a dark roast and adds a splash of creamer.
“Help me fix it up?” Cas replies with his voice going up at the end, seeming unsure if Dean will support him. As if Dean could deny him anything he ever asks for. Dean stares at his best friend, taking in the dark messy hair that Cas has probably been running his fingers through all day while working up the nerve to ask. He can see Cas wringing his hands together, still shifting his weight from foot to foot. The biggest tell, though, is Cas refusing to make eye contact with Dean.
As if Cas read his mind, he lets his head lean towards Dean until it settles comfortably against his. Dean sucks in a sharp breath and wills his body to stay relaxed. Not wanting to ruin the moment Dean stays quiet and leans his head more against Cas’. Cas lets out a soft hum and they settle in the sand for the rest of the evening. They stay just like until the last light disappears and the stars start to sparkle in the night sky.
Ketch doesn’t wait for a response and is already out the door before he finishes talking. Huffing in slight irritation Castiel follows behind and shuts the door to the bland hotel room. They make it to the airport with plenty of time to spare and find a couple seats by their gate to wait until they board. Ketch immediately starts tapping his foot impatiently and keeps glancing down at his watch as if that will make time go faster. Rolling his eyes Castiel takes in the rest of the people around them. There are not many, which doesn't surprise him as it is Christmas day after all and most people are already at home with their families celebrating.
Now it’s a month into the new school year, and Dean knows he made the best decision of his life. He loves the city, loves the school and his coworkers, and he especially loves his kids. It’s been his dream for as long as he can remember, to be a teacher. Now he gets to live that dream every day. Sure there are hard days, but there are hard days in any job. The good days are unbelievable though. When he can see kids write their name in cursive for the first time and how their face lights up. Or when one of them beats the timer for their addition tables and gets another scoop of ice cream on their paper cone, and a real popsicle of course. Those kids deserve all of the awards they earn. They also laugh at his stupid puns and jokes, so yeah, he loves these kids.
“We do tend to talk about them and not much else. I knew you did construction, but that's about it,” Cas’ voice brings Dean back to the present. “ Anyways, what can I do for you Dean?”
Dean Winchester. The man moved to town eight years ago when he took the job opening at one of the local elementary schools. First thing he had done was insist on taking his class to the zoo every year since it is one of his own fond memories from his schooling days. So every fall, without fail, the class has come to the zoo for a field trip. Normally Castiel would love having a class there for a field trip, but the very first second he laid sight on Mr. Winchester, he knew it was a very very bad idea. The man is unfairly attractive and instantly had Cas straining to remain professional and appropriate in front of a whole bunch of eight year olds. It didn’t help matters when the teacher flashed him that mesmerizing smile the very first time. Cas was a goner instantly.
“Maybe!” Dean agrees. “At least it's something the majority of the population will relate too and can actually experience.”
Dean’s stomach drops at the news, not the sleigh ride part that actually sounds pretty awesome.  How is he supposed to write the article that will literally make or break his career if he can't even get to the destination he's supposed to reach? With his appetite officially gone Dean pushes his plate away. Castiel must feel the same since he also pushes his half finished breakfast further away from himself.
That’s the second time in the same day that Dean has seen Cas laugh. Probably the second time he has ever seen him actually genuinely laugh. The sight is breathtaking. His nose scrunches up like when he has that really big gummy smile and the corner of his eyes scrunch up too. It makes Dean's smile turn from teasing to something more soft and adoring. Cas is adorable, and hot at as hell somehow at the same time. Some of the flour got in his hair giving him a salt and pepper look that the guy can pull off real well. It also gives Dean thoughts of what Cas would look like ten years down the road and how much he would love to see that which is very sobering.
“Alright dear, let me know if you need anything alright?” Carol says and with one last pat on his arm, she turns to join the rest of her guests downstairs.
Dean looks up to find miles and miles of tan skin. His mouth goes dry with Cas standing behind him in just his sleep pants, seeming to forget to put a shirt on, with his dark hair in a wet messy pile on top of his head. Dean is just barely able to hold back an embarrassing whimper at the beautiful sight. Cas runs every day and it shows with his lean muscled body and thick runner thighs that Dean has had many fantasies about.
“Oh look at you all dressed up!” Carol gushes at him while running her hands down his arms and giving him an approving look. Dean sends her a wink paired with his trademark smirk and is overjoyed with the elderly women blushes.
“Any word from Cas?” Eileen asks. Dean gives her a sad smile and shakes his head. He refuses to get his hopes up. It's most likely that Cas is already on a plane heading back to New York and away from Dean. Cas also chose to go back with Ketch, so he probably wants nothing to do with Dean anyway.
Something reflective had caught Castiel’s attention through the mirror and distracted him. It was that damp picture frame sitting on the shelf. The one with two people smiling at him. Instead of smiling back like he used to, Castiel friended and slammed the picture down on its face. Thankfully (or not) it didn’t break and send glass everywhere.
Two strong arms wrap around Dean, causing him to hum happily and lean back into the strong body behind him. Cas hooks his chin over Dean’s shoulder, looking out at the ocean. They are perfectly content to stand there together, watching the vibrant blue waves crash on the golden sand. Dean feels a light kiss pressed into his shoulder and smiles softly. Some days he still can't believe he gets to call the beautiful man behind him his.
It took a while to convince Dean that this is a good idea. He still isn’t entirely convinced and even now sitting on a plane he thinks it was a very very bad idea. Why would Cas go on a vacation with another guy instead of his wife? Cas had confided in him months ago after a few drinks that his marriage with Amelia is practically over except for on paper and by law. In Cas’, and Amelia’s, mind their marriage ended years ago. For Claire, and other legal reasons, they have stayed together though. Cas has shared with him a little of what has been going on regarding that whole situation, but he knows there is still a lot unsaid that Cas will tell him when he is ready.
“Bye Claire,” a deep voice to Dean’s right draws his attention. He turns in time to see another young blond girl steadily walk into the classroom without a backwards glance. Dean turns a little further and finds a man standing there with a disappointed look on his face. Taking in the messy dark hair, the slight scruff, and the rumpled looking suit, Dean takes a guess that the guy has not had the best day so far.
Castiel quickly scans through the article and sees that Dean managed to find the certificate in Chris’ jacket.
Dean doesn’t doubt that one bit. The lady has a way of knowing things before you even open your mouth and Dean stopped questioning her about it months ago.
Dean shoots a glare in Gabe’s direction hoping his anger comes off clearly. How dare he set this up without giving Cas any warning? What if Cas doesn’t even want to see Dean again, and then they just ambushed him tonight. Dean meets Cas’ gaze and lets out a defeated sigh. Honesty is probably the best option here.
“What do you mean? It's a big piece and could really help my career,” Dean answers, hoping Cas will accept it and move in. Of course, that's not the case though.
“Let me go grab my stuff and I’ll be right back down,” Castiel says hurriedly before rushing up the stairs. As soon as he reaches the room he slams the door and sinks down to the floor. Everything hurts inside and he doesn’t understand why. Deans rejection should not have hurt that much. It’s not like Cas was expecting Dean to beg him to stay even though he knows he would’ve if Dean has just asked. Something about the way Dean was acting worries him but it was clear that Dean didn’t want to fall about it so Cas has to let it go.
“Uncle Dee!” the little girl shrieks, before taking off in a dead sprint. Laughing, Dean bends down and opens his arms wide. His young niece barrels into him, nearly causing him to fall over from the force.
“This is pretty awesome Cas,” Dean says into the open air, wishing he had a beer. Maybe he should talk to Cesar or Jesse to see if there is a local beer they enjoy and where he can find it.
Dean realizes his hand is still on Cas’ knee and reluctantly moves it back to his own body before they go back to staring out the window in silence. Time passes but neither seem to notice or care. Castiel is a solid presence beside him that he takes comfort in. For the first time since this whole thing started Dean is incredibly grateful that Castiel is the one that is on this trip with him.
Dean shrugs and exits the vehicle with Claire right behind him. He orders them both bacon burgers, fries, and shakes. Vanilla for himself and chocolate for Claire. It's still a relatively warm day for being the middle of October so the two of them find a table outside before digging into their food. Dean only lasts about ten minutes before his curiosity gets the better of him.
“That's good to hear!” Chris says behind Castiel as he makes his way over to his wife for a chaste kiss.
They return to Jesse and Cesar’s and Cas goes to find the two men to ask them about something while Dean and the girls head back to their cabin. The four of them plan on heading to the famous shaved ice place Jesse mentioned and then sitting on the beach to watch the sunset over the ocean like they have every night they’ve been there. Dean loves those quiet moments with just the four of them sitting in the sand watching the sky change colors with vibrant reds and oranges for as far as they can see. He somehow always ends up shoulder to shoulder with Cas, leaning against him as they watch the sun go down. Neither one of them mentions it and Dean savors every tiny moment he gets.
“The fighting. Dean said you guys were fighting last night and I panicked so I ran. I can’t go through this again and this time would be much worse,” Claire explains, flicking her eyes back and forth between them.
“Down boy, he’s married,” Dean mutters, but then breaks out laughing at the look on his brother’s face. He looks so shocked and a bit scared of the shorter man. Which is ridiculous given the eight inches he has on the guy.
The girls share a look, seeming to have an entire conversation without saying a single word to each other. That's what happens when you've been best  friends with someone for half your life. Dean and Cas took a while longer for their friendship to get to that level but they are able to have conversations with just a glance too. More often than not, Dean just gets lost in those bright blue orbs and forgets everything else around him, so they just end up staring at each other for extended periods of time.
“We call the twins!” Emma calls before gripping Claire’s wrist and dragging her through to the other bedroom. They have twin smiles on their faces that Dean doesn’t trust one bit. It doesn’t quite compute what she means until Dean turns back to Cas to find him shuffling his feet nervously.
“Yes, I was planning on attending,” Dean chuckles before taking a sip of his heavenly beverage. Carol pats his cheek then stands up to attend to the other guests. He finishes his breakfast consisting of chocolate chip pancakes and bacon before moving to one of the sitting rooms and the spot he has claimed as his. Just as he is pulling out his laptop Castiel appears in front of him holding his own cup of coffee. He’s wearing his glasses again, which is not fair, and looks like he didn’t bother to fix his hair at all. Dean loves it.
Dean’s words are met with silence from both his daughter and the love of his life. Emma stares at them with a mixture of curiosity and worry while Cas stares at him with pain and guilt in his eyes. Now is not the time to deal with what is between them and they can deal with that after they find Claire. He tells them as much and they both nod their heads in agreement.
He gives his eyes a moment to adjust to the light and smiles at the sight that greets him. The landscape crew did an amazing job with Cas’ design with palm trees scattered throughout the courtyard and beautiful bursts of color from the hundreds of different flowers Cas picked out. Dean knows the courtyard looks even more breathtaking at night when the thousands of little lights turn on, illuminating the pathways.
Dean’s grip on the steering wheel increases with each statement until his knuckles are bone-white against the black leather. Castiel reaches out hesitantly and places his hand over Dean’s. He pries Dean’s hand away and brings it to his lap where he holds it rubbing gently circles along the back with his thumb. Slowly Dean starts to relax and his hold on the steering wheel loosens. Castiel knows the story isn’t finished, so he waits patiently for Dean to continue.
Several seconds go by with a tense silence between them. Dean is willing to wait her out even if his insides are twisting into knots not knowing.
are, but Dean doesn’t believe that, so he ignores that part. Even Sam, the first time he met Cas, gave Dean a confused look when he explained that no he is in fact
Dean mentally kicks himself when he remembers where he is. This is Cas’ workplace. He shouldn't be trying to hit on the guy here, especially in front of all of the kids. Dean wouldn’t want someone to come into his classroom and try to hit on him while he’s working. The silence hangs between the two men and grows increasingly uncomfortable. At least for Dean, Castiel doesn’t seem like it is affecting him at all. The man just stands there watching the kids and the other guests. With a heavy sigh, Dean turns his attention from the blue-eyed man to his group of kids.
“She’s okay? Claire’s with you?” Cas asks and the vulnerability in his gravelly voice has Dean close to tears. His friend had to have been so worried about his daughter.
Lydia and Dean met in college one night. Dean was out at one of the fancier bars in town with some friends when the striking strawberry blonde caught his attention in a beautiful deep purple dress. The two immediately hit it off over a couple of drinks and one thing led to another, which eventually ended with Emma coming into the picture. It was never meant to be more than a one night stand. They used protection and everything, but accidents still happen. Dean will forever be grateful for that accident though.
He enters the building on their left and is instantly hit with Christmas joy. There are decorations everywhere, even more than at the inn which Castiel didn’t think was possible. Kids are running around everywhere with parents chasing after them. Fake snow litters the ground and covers the trees. Castiel spins in a slight circle raking everything in and sees Dean has followed him into the shop. They continue further into the building, following the crowd, until the big red throne comes into view and Castiel sees who is sitting on top.
“Thanks, man,” Dean explains his joke and hands the shorter man a handful of small packages. They do their best to hide them from the kids and since none of them ask a question it seems like a success. Gabe heads out with his group to see the big cat exhibits leaving Dean with Castiel and his group of kids.
“The next time your parents talked after that your dad gave her an ultimatum. She gives up the drugs or he takes you away from her. He didn’t want you growing up with that kind of influence.”
Dean recovers first and answers, “Um, no. Cas and I work together in New York and got sent on this trip together.”
“Yeah you’re not wrong,” he agrees. “Your mom did try though. She loved you very much and couldn’t stand never seeing you again so she tried. The withdrawal was brutal though. She made it about a month before she went back to her dealer. Amelia hid it so well that it took your dad months to realize she was back on drugs. They argued again and he gave her a different ultimatum. They move as a family to somewhere new, away from the triggers and known dealers, or he takes you and moves away. Once again she chose you and you guys moved here.
Claire and Emma are already lounging by the pool talking to a dark haired girl around their age. Dean can see a hint of pink on Claire’s fair skin, but can’t tell if it's from the sun or from the unfamiliar girl she is smiling at. Dean can’t help the wide grin that spreads across his own face and as he walks by he makes sure to catch Claire’s attention and give her an exaggerated thumbs up. She rolls her eyes fondly in a manner that reminds Dean so much of Cas.
They sit quietly watching the water come and go, drinking their coffee, pressed side to side. After a few moments, when their coffee is gone, Cas shifts a little bit closer and rests his head on Dean’s shoulder. Dean tenses for a second before relaxing and just enjoying the moment. He tilts his head to rest on Cas’ and closes his eyes to soak it all in. This is okay. They are okay. Everything will be okay.
“Alright, let's go check out the villas to see how we will be living for who knows how long,” Dean mumbles before leading the way to the nearest villa. They agreed that they should have an amazing view of the ocean while they live here so they chose one of the beach side villas as their home.
With those final words, the two brothers grab their jackets and head out the door. They pile into the impala and take off towards the bar Gabe told Dean about. The brothers walk in a little before 8:00  and head straight for the bar. Dean looks around but doesn’t see Gabe or Castiel yet. He orders a beer and gulps it down quickly before ordering a second. Sam gives him a worried look but Dean ignores it in favor of sipping his new beer.
“Let's go,” Dean says gruffly, the emotion clogging his throat making it difficult to force words out. Cas doesn’t say anything as Dean leads him back to the truck to look at other places on the way back to the hotel. They’ve only been on the road for a couple minutes when Dean sees it. He doesn't know why he didn’t think of it before. Without any warning Dean parks the car and jumps out, leaving Cas to follow behind him. Dean races through the open door into the shop and all his air leaves him in one breath.
“Don't you ma’am me boy!” There is a twinkle in her eye that lets Dean know she's not actually mad. He hands the truck keys to Claire who leaves the shop hesitantly, looking at her dad. Cas still hasn’t said a word since Claire yelled at them. He turns to leave when Missouri’s voice stops him. “Dean. Castiel. Remember you have to be honest about everything to make it work.”
Dean wipes the sweat from his forehead, taking a second to rest. He looks around the demolished hotel room with a frown. This was supposed to be easier. When they cleaned everything out all those months ago they discovered immense water damage in nearly every wall. Replacing the studs sounds easy enough until they realized all of the walls are not a typical size you see in the states. So they had to order a bunch of custom wood (which took freaking forever) and then they could get to work on fixing everything. Once the wood did arrive the actual installment went pretty quickly with little to no problem.
“Well, what do you think brotha?” Benny asks with a broad smile. Dean turns to Cas, dying to know what Cas is thinking. Does he regret it? Is it possible to get their money back on everything they pre ordered? Is it too late to turn back and head home?
Once the burgers are done Dean and Cas set the table up with the rest of the food they brought for dinner. Bags full of different kinds of chips, all of the most important condiments for the burgers, and a bowl of mixed fruit that Castiel absolutely insisted on. Dean gets Em’s plate all set up with her plain bacon cheeseburger and chips before starting on his own masterpiece. For whatever reason it became tradition that when the Novak duo came over for burger nights, Dean would put together his and Cas’ burger the same way. Sometimes it varies if Dean is feeling creative and Cas has loved every single creation, so Dean just keeps doing it.
Cas takes a walk through once they have a majority of the damage taken care of, and between all of them they deem it structurally sound and get back to work. The next load that Cesar and Jesse bring over includes the new windows and doors which are insanely heavy due to the thick glass. Luckily with their help Dean and Benny are able to get them all installed relatively quickly. With no more heavy lifting they say their goodbyes to their new friends and promise that they will be ready for the local crew to come out in a few days.
There are only a couple more exhibits to go and Cas is counting down the minutes. He needs more coffee. Or a nap. They reach the elephants and Cas says his piece before letting the kids watch the giant animals get a bath from some other zoo employees. They have a hose and a kitty pool out for the animals trying their best to get them a little cleaner. One of the elephants finishes getting sprayed off before stomping over to the other side of the habitat. Cas knows this particular elephant never likes being clean for too long so he watches with all the kids as the animal flops down in the dirt causing a dust cloud to fly into the air. The elephant rolls around trying to get all his still wet surfaces covered in a nice layer of dirt. Laughter fills the air as the guests watch the elephant and zoo employees in the habitat. Dean of course doesn’t miss the perfect opportunity either.
“Hey sweetheart, you ready to go home?” Dean feels her nod her head before they both let go. He looks back at his daughter’s teacher. “Thanks for staying with her, sorry I was late. Work went late and the roads are a disaster.”
“Huh,” Cas looks like he's thinking about something and then smiles slightly. “I never thought about it before but they actually would make a perfect couple.”
“Thank you, Gabriel. Now if you two will excuse me I have a meeting later this afternoon I have to get ready for. It was nice to meet you, Dean,” Cas says politely then he turns and walks further into the zoo. Dean doesn’t even realize he's watching the man walk away until he hears a throat clear next to him. He turns to see Gabe smirking at him again.
“Now hold on a minute Castiel,” Charlie replies with a slight hesitation. “You are also on the Aspen assignment.”
Cas rolls his eyes at Ash’s intro for him, but stands up and makes his way to the stage anyway. There are a lot of cheers and wolf whistles that follow him to the stage which causes him to blush a little. He silently prays that people can’t tell too much because of the low lighting. When he reaches the stage, he finds Ash still standing there with a smirk on his face which is odd, usually the man goes back to his music station behind the stage. He sends a wink towards Cas before turning back to the crowd.
The shorter man snorts, and the taller man just squints a little bit more. Definitely not the reaction Dean was going for. His smile falters a little before he hears quiet giggles behind him. A couple of his kids catch the pun and smile up at him which brings back Dean’s smile in full force. Who cares what the zookeepers think about his puns? He says them for the kids' entertainment and they love them. So ha! Dean Winchester is still freaking awesome.
“Uncle Dee!” Two girls scream when they come into view. With a happy laugh Dean kneels down and gathers both girls into his arms as they crash into him. They wrap their little arms around his neck and he squeezes them tight to his body. Cas knew Dean was good with kids, the little girl at the airport and the boy from the other day showed that. Seeing him now with his nieces trying to listen to all the information the girls are telling him it's clear to anyone with eyes that Dean is a family man. It makes Castiel wonder if Dean would ever want kids of his own someday. He can picture a little blonde girl with bright green eyes running around in their apartment and maybe a little boy with dark hair and blue eyes like Cas’.
A few moments later they both have a fresh cup of steaming coffee and blissful smiles on their faces. Dean leads Cas over to the dock, quietly assuring him the girls will be fine, and they settle on the end with their feet dangling close to the lake's surface. The wind gusts over them, causing Cas to shiver. Dean unwraps himself before wrapping the blanket around both his and Cas’ shoulders. It forces them to shift closer together so that they are pressed from knee to shoulder. Dean almost doesn’t feel the need for the blanket anymore but absolutely refuses to move even an inch away from Cas.
“We can share the bed. It’s large enough for the both of us and I will not let you go another night without any rest! It's already almost three a.m. so get your butt over here so that we can go to bed.” Cas’ tone leaves no room for argument so Dean gets up as he's told and moves to the opposite side of the bed. Pulling the covers back Dean crawls in and immediately melts into the mattress.
“Thanks, Carol, but I think I’m just going to turn in for the night. The party was great though! You guys did an amazing job,” Dean forces a smile onto his face but he knows it's more of a grimace than anything else.
“Christmas miracle my ass,” Dean mumbles under his breath. Castiel can’t help but chuckle slightly. Yeah, a Christmas miracle would be real nice right about now.
“You didn’t see that?” Castiel asks curiously. If what the legend told him was true and that only those that truly believe in the Christmas spirit can see the light then he wouldn’t be very surprised if Ketch didn’t see it.
Castiel looks at him in disbelief. Didn’t he literally just say he was going to the airport? Apparently, Castiel took too long to reply or Ketch really doesn’t care at all, because Ketch waltzed right out the door with a slight wave and a half-hearted thanks before Castiel could answer.
He knows it is not his place to tell Claire any of this, but he has to do something to make her see what's really going on. Castiel trusted him enough to tell him everything and Dean knows he is planning on telling Claire everything too. Dean figures if he tells Claire enough then Cas can fill in the rest later and be better suited to answering Claire’s questions.
Dean feels tears prickling at the back of his eyes and blinks furiously to keep them at bay. He refuses to cry in front of his little brother. Dragging Claire and Emma with him, Dean moves forwards and pulls Cas into his arms, squishing their girls between them.
“Her name is Kaia, her family is visiting from the states,” she finally says with a blush staining her cheeks.
“Just come on,” Dean replies heading towards the door he just came in not too long ago. With a frown Castiel gets up to follow grabbing his trench coat from the back of the coach on his way. The cold winter air hits him hard and he instantly starts to shiver. Dean hands him his surprisingly still full and hot coffee cup. He takes it gratefully letting the heat seep through to his hands and brings the cup up to his face to relish in the delicious smell of coffee. “You can drink it too, you know?”
A few short minutes later the group reaches the exhibit holding the cheetahs. Castiel waits for the kids to gather around him, letting them have a minute to admire the beautiful animals. Cheetahs are on the smaller side of all the big cats but no less impressive. Just watching the way they move you can tell these animals are powerful.
Emma pulls back to look at her dad. Water still pools in her eyes, making the green more vibrant than ever. Dean gently swipes his thumb on her cheeks, making the tear tracks disappear. “What?”
“What’s the special of the week?” He likes trying the rotating beer special before getting his usual.
With all these thoughts flying through his head Dean really should have seen it coming, but it hits him like a freight train and he realizes he likes Castiel. Not in a just friends kind of way but in a I want to spend more time with you to get to know you better kind of way. Or if he really wants to be honest with himself, he’s already halfway to falling in love with the guy.
Cas mumbles something unintelligible, refusing to look up from the ground. Dean releases a heavy sigh and turns around, frustrated. He gets Cas is scared, hell Dean is scared too! He has seen Claire as a second daughter for years now. He loves that sassy blonde as if she was his own. What he doesn’t understand is why Cas looks like he has given up. Dean knows Cas would never give up on Claire so that just means Cas has given up on something else. Dean doesn't believe in any higher power but he prays like hell Cas isn’t giving up on him.
Finally the other end of the line goes quiet. Dean closes his eyes and runs his hand over his face to calm himself down. He takes a deep breath and opens his eyes to find Claire standing in front of him with a mixture of worry and guilt on her face. With his free hand he reaches out and pulls her into his side for a hug. To his surprise, and great relief, she wraps her arms around his waist and clings to him tighter. She buries her face in his chest and he leans down to gently kiss the top of her head while running his hand up and down her back soothingly.
If Dean were to ever admit he had a specific type it would be Cas. Messy dark hair that Dean would give just about anything to run his fingers through to see if it feels as soft as it looks. Bright blue eyes that he could get lost staring into for hours on end. That’s happened a few times now and Dean can’t wait for the next time. A lean but muscular and strong body type that he knows Cas has. When they were ice skating Dean could feel the man's arms and was shocked by how much muscle he felt. And Cas has that one pair of jeans he wears sometimes on casual Fridays that fit him just right and Dean always has to force himself not to stare at those same thick thighs and ass from earlier. Now add in the glasses and Deans a goner.
“Alright guys, my name is Cas, and I’ll be your guide for the day. We’re going to head to see the bears first, so if any of you have any questions feel free to ask at any time,” Cas says with a friendly smile. When no one races their hand with any questions Cas takes it as his cue to start moving in the direction of the bear habitats.
“What he means to say is that I get almost all my fruits from here on the island and the rest I have imported from a trusted source and then use as few additives as possible for my flavors,” Missouri explains while handing a bowl of shaved ice with red, orange, and yellow coloring making it look like a sunset. “Here you go, sweetheart. That is mango and strawberry.”
They reach the island around noon which gives them some time to take in everything with fresh eyes. The last time they were here the hotel was just a cool landmark they had stumbled upon and nothing more. Now it is a project, and a big one at that. Dean doesn’t remember the place being this big, but the closer they get the more nervous he becomes. What have they gotten themselves into?
“I honestly don’t know the full answer to that one Claire. All I know is that your parents' marriage hasn’t been much more than a piece of paper for a while now. I know your dad loves your mom and will always care for her, but I don’t think he is still in love with her. This might be a chance to give your dad an opportunity to move forward in his life and maybe find a new partner?”
“Yes, we are,” Cas replies with a small smile that warms Dean’s heart. “Is it a fancy event? I don’t have anything fancy other than my normal suit which I dont think will work.”
“Hey! Wait up!” Dean calls before rushing over and placing a hand on his shoulder. “I wanna show you something real quick.”
“Hey kids, check out the lion up there! He has his very own cat-walk,” Dean exclaims with a smile. The kids giggle at his pun and look up at the magnificent creature strutting across the rocks. Without meaning to, Dean’s eyes skip over to Cas to see his reaction. To his great disappointment, the man seems to have a very angry scowl on his face. Dean’s smile falls instantly. He doesn’t know why the zookeeper is getting so upset about some stupid puns, but it's really starting to irritate him right back. Dean is here for the kids, trying to make this trip more entertaining and fun for them. What does it matter if their tour guide doesn’t like his jokes? Funny how Dean has to keep reminding himself that.
“It wasn’t long before we moved here. I remember waking up and hearing them arguing and yelling at each other. I sat at the top of the stairs listening. I don’t remember much of what was said but I was so scared. I had never heard them like that before. Especially dad. He's so quiet and awkward half the time that it scared me to hear him yelling like that. I remember hearing something break, glass or something, and then a door slam. I rushed back to my room and climbed into bed. Then dad came up a few minutes later and I remember him sitting next to me and stroking my hair. I refused to look at him though, I didn't want him to see me crying, so I pretended I was asleep,” she explains with tears threatening to spill.
“I’m sorry, but who are you?” Dean demands, getting tired of not knowing what's going on and how these two strangers know them.
“Sammy does his own thing for Christmas, I’ll see them for New Years which works perfectly for me this year since we were supposed to be in Aspen.” It’s a half lie which Dean thinks is better than a whole lie. Castiel seems to accept the answer, but now Dean is curious. “What about you? Do you have any family you usually spend the holidays with?”
“Is it possible to get two separate rooms?” Castiel asks, refusing to look at Dean. Mr. and Mrs. Winters share a look causing Castiel’s stomach to drop.
“This is Steve!” Mary exclaims holding up a unicorn plushie Bobby got her. Dean stares the unicorn in the eye through narrowed eyes. He doesn't trust it.
As if that summoned them, suddenly all 23 kids and the four parent volunteers are standing behind their teacher looking up at them with anticipation filled faces. Dean turns to address his group of students after doing a quick headcount to make sure everyone is there.
The kids look up at the man in awe thinking he’s the smartest person ever. Dean takes the chance to remind them of their paper, “Hey guys remember the paper we handed out to you on the bus? That might be a good thing to write down next to polar bears. You can even write their names or what Mr. Cas said about where they live.”
“Yeah, unlikely, old man,” she responds with her usual snark. Normally Dean would scowl and protest the fact that he is really not that old, but the return of Claire’s attitude just brings a smile to his face. Snarky sarcastic teenage girl he can work with.
“Now these bears are known as sun bears. They’re new to the zoo this year and are incredibly rare. They also happen to be the smallest species of bears in the world. Despite their small size they have extremely long tongues, which allows them to get the honey they enjoy so much from the bee nests.”
Dean laughs, “Nope! You’re just going to have to wait and see! I’ll even offer to read yours for all of your spelling errors too.”
“May I ask a question?” Chirs asks, dragging Dean out of his thoughts. He nods his head, thankful for the interruption, and the older man continues. “Why are you here?”
“Thank God,” Dean breathes out while standing. His knees pop and he groans as he stretches out. The tutu comes off immediately and the tiara soon follows. Getting the glitter off is a lost cause at the moment so Dean chooses to pretend it's not there. When he reaches the kitchen the girls give him twin pouts which he promptly ignores knowing he will cave if he takes one look at them.
“Heya Winchester!” she greets brightly. The borrowed shirt swallows her lithe frame and Dean can’t tell if she's wearing anything underneath. Jo must read his mind or something because she rolls her eyes and glides forward to the table to sit next to Benny. She smirks in Dean’s direction as Benny turns a bright shade of red.
Castiel huffs in disbelief. Charlie would never accept an article written only about coffee. This article is supposed to be about the Christmas spirit and joy of the holidays. Not an every day beverage.
, for making this actually readable and the encouragement I needed to finish this. Also I would not have known about the Western and Cowboy Museum without them.
“No really, name one of my articles. Just one,” Cas urges with a self-satisfied grin. He watches Ketch flounder and it brings him a lot more joy than he thought it would.
Gabe leads them over to a booth in the corner. Sam slides in and Dean sits down next to him with Cas directly across from him.
“Dean,” She replies, her voice sounding a little off but clear nevertheless. Dean embraces her in a warm hug just like he has done with the rest of his family. When they break apart Eileen looks at Dean expectantly before looking at Cas and back again.
The question shocks Dean so much that he can't help the bark of laughter that escapes him. “Cas, buddy, if I had a problem with you being gay then I would have a major problem with myself.”
She smirks up at him from where she is leaning against the door frame with her arms crossed. “We were just having a little fun, Deanie weanie! No need to get so uptight about everything.”
Cas just makes it so easy for Dean to feel comfortable and actually want to get to know someone beyond the superficial. They have spent many Saturdays getting to know one another. Dean has learned that Cas comes from a very large, very rich family but isn’t very close with any of his siblings. Except maybe Gabriel, but Cas said he isn’t always too big of a fan of the guy.
“Do you even know how long it has been since I’ve kissed anyone Dean?” Cas asks, finally striding ahead and turning to face Dean, halting their walking. “Sixteen years! I have gone sixteen years with not even a kiss! Excuse me for getting a little carried away when someone actually shows interest in me for once.”
“Claire and her dad are going to join us for dinner tonight, so you two will have more time to play together!” he explains and is rewarded with shrill shrieks from his daughter. Claire even smiles at him, which is so rare that he is slightly shocked. If he knew the girls would’ve been this happy he would’ve asked Castiel to join them for dinner a long time ago.
“Damn, I can still look though right?” Gabe says sending a wink to Sam. Before Sam can respond Gabe orders drinks for himself and Castiel. The bartender hands Gabe some sugary concoction, causing the other three men to wrinkle their noses, and hands Cas a beer. “Shall we?”
By the time he catches up with the other man they are nearly at the entrance to the hotel. Dean can see the brand new sign they installed just last week and marvels at how beautiful Cas’ design is and how it fits with the surrounding greenery. Cas doesn’t turn around even when Dean knows he heard his approach. Dean stops a few feet away and wills his breathing to even out.
They go from hole to hole trading the lead back and forth. Dean plays up his antics as much as possible, trying to get Claire to crack a smile. She already knows how much of a dork Dean is after spending the last six years at his house almost every day.
“Nothing! Tensions are just high right now with this whole hotel project and I need time to cool off before I do or say something I will regret,” Dean says honestly, walking over to where Claire is now standing. He gently kisses her on the forehead and wraps her into a tight hug, savoring the contact a little more than usual. “I’ll see you in the morning Claire-bear, tell Ems I love her alright?”
Cas is frozen in shock as he sees a man make his way to the stage, being pushed by a short blonde woman Cas recognizes as Jo. As they come closer Cas can clearly see that this is in fact the very same Dean Winchester. And for some reason, which makes absolutely no sense to Castiel, Dean is even more attractive in person than he is in the countless amount of pictures Cas has seen of the guy. He's not a stalker or weirdo,  but he just might have a really big crush on the guy. To be fair Cas never actually expected to meet the guy. That was the whole point of celebrity crushes; you look and appreciate from a far, but nothing is ever supposed to come from it!
“You say it didn’t mean anything and that it wasn’t a big deal, but I gotta say that sounds like a hell of a big deal to me buddy,” Dean tries not to let Cas’ words affect him. He didn’t know it had been that long, but it makes sense knowing what happened with Amelia.
“He told me how disgusting it is to be with another man and that my mom would be so disappointed in me. That's the part that hurt the most you know? Using my mom against me like that. Said it was disrespectful to prance around holding another man’s hand on the anniversary of my moms death and around her favorite holiday. He kicked me out right then and there. All I had was my car and a duffle full of some clothes from my apartment. I didn’t even get to see Sammy that year.”
They both nod their heads obediently. The redhead is a firey grudge-holder, and everyone knows to not get on her bad side.
Someone please shoot him right now. God could he have been any more embarrassing? Rambling on about how great Cas is?
“It's fine Dean,” Cas replies but his tone is tense so Dean doesn't know if it's actually fine. “I’m more upset about the fact that finding that certificate is nearly impossible and I won't have anything for my article.”
Castiel has never spent a Christmas surrounded by family like this before. Being surrounded by laughter and happiness makes him smile. Even if it's not his family he can still feel the love in the air. He loves seeing Dean interact with his family. Cas has never seen him so relaxed and enjoying what's around him. Their usual interactions revolve around work and are usually in the conference room. Castiel regrets never actually getting to know the guy in the three years that they worked together but honestly he always thought Dean didn't know who he was. Also Dean is so far out of his league that it wouldn’t have mattered anyways and the fact that he always thought Dean was straight. The only way Cas was able to form words around the other man was if he pretended he hated him. Eventually that's just how Cas started to see Dean. Castiel has never regretted something more.
Castiel sits in the conference room, fifteen minutes early of course, repositioning all of his belongings so they sit straight on the table in front of him. He woke up right at 6:05 like he does every morning and made himself a very delicious egg omelet breakfast, following the recipe he found the day before. As he got dressed for the day, in his usual white button-down and suit combo, he did more research on Aspen. He can’t wait to be there tomorrow and write the article he knows will make his career. Castiel tied his favorite blue tie around his neck, frustrated when he had to redo it because it ended up backward.
Dean chuckles darkly, “But by some Christmas miracle, instead of being down in Colorado we end up being less than two hours away from my family.”
Castiel has been staring at books on and off for the last four hours trying to come up with something,
Cas turns so his back is pressed to Dean’s chest, mirroring the position they were in when Cas first found Dean. They watch the people moving about, going in and out of the hotel and their villas. Everyone has a smile on their face, kids and adults alike. Guests are relaxing by the pool, enjoying the warm sandy beach, or splashing in the ocean waves. Dean smiles at everyone that walks by them and welcomes them to the island.
It takes the whole day to clear out the villa. The process has Dean questioning everything all over again. If it takes half a day to just clear out one small villa, how on Earth are they going to get everything done within their timeline? Originally Dean and Cas thought they could get the hotel block completely renovated and half of the villas done within a year and be able to open partially while they finish out the rest of the villas. Now though? Dean thinks they might need a while longer. Cas looks exhausted and a little defeated so Dean keeps his thoughts to himself. There's no need to bum out his friend even more.
They stay that way, letting the quiet noises of the plane surround them, until the descent. Dean instinctively grabs hold of whatever is closest to him which ends up being Cas’ leg. It’s too late for him to move though when the small plane hits another patch of rough air. Cas doesn’t seem to notice or care, he just continues to hold Dean’s hand and whisper reassuring words into his ear. Dean can feel Cas’ warm breath against his skin, sending shivers all down his spine. It’s a distraction in its own way and takes Dean’s mind off the descending plane enough for them to land safely in the southern part of Florida.
“Well old St. Nick of course!” She exclaims like it's obvious. And maybe it should have been with the town being called Santa Claus after all and this place looks like Christmas threw up everywhere. “Back in 1832 St. Nick founded this place and declared it a historical landmark. Ever since then the building has been standing proud and strong.”
“Yeah about that, I thought you were in Aspen,” Sam cuts in finally having the chance to ask his question again.
Cas doesn’t say a word and neither does Dean. It's peaceful here. He can still hear the sounds of the ocean, but there are no other people or cars or boats around. It’s just them and this old abandoned hotel. The two men walk in silence and eventually return to the beach where the girls are laying in the sand talking. They hop back onto the boat and take off to explore the rest of the island. Cas stays quiet the rest of the way and Dean would’ve been concerned if it weren’t for the wistful smile that hasn’t left Cas’ face all day.
Bobby said he would come back to the company to help take over some of the business side of things while Dean was away and Dean’s good friend, Lee, would take over managing the crews and projects. Having those two step in took a lot of the stress off of Dean while they were planning everything. He had no idea how he was going to balance his company and the hotel project at the same time. Especially since he would be at the island almost the entire time. Now though, he is able to focus on the hotel since he knows between Bobby and Lee everything will run smoothly back home.
“When you were born your parents were young and not completely prepared to welcome a child into their lives. They both were in college and you weren’t even supposed to be an idea until five years down the road. Cas took charge though. He proposed to your mother and they got married six months later. Two more after that you were born. Cas told me it was the happiest day of his life when you popped into this world.”
Dean proceeds to split the groups up and assigns two parent volunteers with each group. To Castiel’s great pleasure all the kids seem to be on their best behavior this trip. The zoo gets a few other classes that come in for field trips and most of the time the kids don't want to be there and are rude to everyone that crosses their path. They have never had an issue with any of Dean’s classes though. If Cas wasn’t dreading the rest of the day then he might be more inclined to think that Dean was a decent human. Even when the man annoys him to no end, he can really tell the kids love having Dean as their teacher.
As if summoned Gabe walks back over, “Alright Cassie, I talked to the family and the people working the gates today, so everyone is on the same page. Thanks for reporting that, I hate people like that. Like, respect the animals, man.”
Several hands go up in the air and the gear is passed around. Claire and Emma are the first into the cool water, immediately heading for the closest underwater cave. Dean and Cas have taken them here before so they know what they are doing and how to be safe. Charlie follows soon after, her red hair a bright beacon in the water. Somehow Jess talks Sam into it and Dean throws his head back in laughter as he watches his brother hesitate before jumping in.
“Don’t worry about it. You’re an adult. You’re not married anymore. You can do whatever you want. Or whoever in this case.”
They’ve shared the bed for long enough now that it's no longer awkward to go to sleep or wake up next to the other. It’s not even weird if they wake up and find themselves cuddling. There was one morning Dean woke up to being the little spoon and Cas’ arm wrapped firmly around his waist. It felt so damn comfortable that Dean allowed himself to enjoy it for much longer than he normally would and didn't even flinch when Cas woke up. Cas didn't seem to mind either since he just tightened his arm and mumbled good morning into Dean's hair. That was one of the best mornings Dean has ever had. They don’t talk about it and Dean is honestly okay with that. If they don't mention it then it isn’t a problem and he can enjoy cuddly Cas.
“Thank you, I will,” he replies with an easy smile. Several months ago one of his students had been at the Roadhouse during karaoke night and saw their English teacher perform on stage. The next day was interesting, to say the least, as the news spread all through the school. Every class period there were at least five students asking questions about him singing. Luckily nobody made any negative comments or judged him for it, or if they did they wisely kept it to themselves. Cas really doesn’t care if his students or colleagues don’t approve of his Thursday night fun. He loves it and that's all that matters.
“Pina colada please!” Emma shouts pushing her way up to the counter to watch Missouri work. She gets the ice all shaved and packed into a bowl before pouring the delicious smelling flavors all over. She hands it to Emma with a bright green spoon and it doesn’t take long for Emma to dig right in. Dean smiles and holds Mary up a little higher so she can see what's going on.
Cas on any normal day is attractive as hell and Dean has issues keeping himself in check. But sleep rumpled Cas with even messier bed head than usual? The sight nearly brings Dean to his knees right then and there. Cas squints at him through heavily lidded eyes and Dean wonders if Cas can see anything at all in the still dark lighting. Dean does raise his hand in a small awkward wave with a smile to match before continuing to exit the tent.
Roman walks out of the office with everyone’s eyes following him out. Once the door closes, all eyes snap directly to Charlie, who is now standing at the head of the table with a sheepish look on her face.
“My ‘people skills’ are rusty so to speak,” Cas says hesitantly and uses actual finger quotes, which causes Dean to smile. “I often don’t catch jokes, or puns, or references. Gabriel often makes fun of me for my lack of ‘pop culture knowledge’.”
“Um… I just wanted to apologize for my behavior. I know it wasn’t very professional of me and I probably overstepped multiple times. This is your job, you know what you’re doing, and you really didn’t need me stepping in all the time. Especially with my stupid jokes and puns that aren’t even funny,” Dean takes a deep breath and looks down at the ground, not brave enough to look the man in the eyes. “I just hope that my stupidity won’t cause you to ban my class. I promise I’ll be on my best behavior and will be completely professional next year. I can even request a different tour guide if I’ve made you uncomfortable.”
Unfortunately a much different accident took Lydia from them only a year after Emma was born. A drunk driver had hit her at an intersection and killed her on site. The two were never really a couple beyond the fact that they shared a daughter. They were very good friends and vowed to do everything in their power to give Emma a good life.
