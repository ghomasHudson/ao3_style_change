BAM! The gun fires. Glass shatters. John recoils down to the floor. He hits the wood floor hard, his head bouncing before falling still. Everything around John becomes slightly muffled. The noises, his vision. The pain is too much. He is already slipping away. Everything is getting hazy...
No. John deserves someone here when wakes up. It's decided. Sherlock's staying. He'll stay and wait. No matter how long. He couldn't be here last night and he hated that. He'll stay here tonight. So, Sherlock sits. He sits in the remaining chair at the far wall's table and he watches John. He watches the rise and fall of his chest. He watches his REM, he watches the heart monitor. But that's not all he watches. His mind begins a replay of the times before this. The good times. The friendly, but exasperated bickering over milk, spilt tea on files, failed cooking attempts. Then, nights yelling at the telly, nights spent in front of the fire, aimlessly discussing whatever passed through their minds, all-nighters spent on cases. All-nighters that John couldn't make it through. Nights where John fell asleep on the couch, in his chair, or in a chair at the desk while doing research for Sherlock. Nights where even Sherlock got a little sleep listening to the faint snore of a sleeping John. Days spent doing nothing. Days spent conducting experiments and updating the blog. Days spent walking around London when they had nothing else to do. Days they spent together.
Lestrade makes an agreeing noise and dumps a bag on the small table already scattered with an assortment of Sherlock's things. "Sandwiches. And before you complain, you can just take what you don't like off of yours," Lestrade smirks as he hands Sherlock a wrapped sandwich.
Lestrade rolls his eyes with a sigh. Why does Sherlock have to be so... Sherlock sometimes? "Care to explain?"
Chuckles from both men ensue. It's the first time Sherlock's genuinely smiled in a while. A genuine smile where he's not being deceived or is doing the deceiving, a real smile between two friends.
Stella pulls Sherlock aside for just a few moments and quietly whispers, "Give John my best, will you? I'm so sorry. I know you two were... close."
Sherlock grabs his laptop and charger and plugs everything in. The laptop whirs to life and Sherlock types, "verbal communication with comatose patients" into the search box, making sure to run a few filters so he only receives reliable sources. He clicks on one done by a doctor in Sweden, quickly skimming it to see if it's worth his time. It says two-hundred pages and this doctor has ample evidence listed, so Sherlock might as well read this one.
Another person speaks up; this time a woman. "We'll be keeping him like this until we believe the swelling has gone down enough for him to become conscious again. I'm Dr. Andrews," she holds out her hand as well and Sherlock shakes it.
"Yes, it is. I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that we can now begin to wean him off the anesthetics and sedatives that are keeping him in this state of coma, and administer medication to help speed everything up."
"What do you mean, 'what about me'?" Sherlock crosses the room and begins rummaging through the takeout bag.
No. Sherlock wasn't going to be silly. John was asleep and couldn't hear him. Nothing Sherlock were to say would matter. He'd just sit and wait for Mrs. Hudson to come back.
"If you speak to him, he'll hear you. I was a skeptic too at first, but there's been research done on it; real cases. Even an attending here has researched it. The say it promotes a faster recovery. You might try it."
"Fine, thank you. How is he?" Sherlock nods his head in the direction of John, who is completely still, frozen except for the rise and fall of his chest.
Sherlock feels lightheaded again. He needs a distraction. Reaching into his shirt pocket, Sherlock pulls out his phone and texts Lestrade, 'Hospital. Cases. Lunch. Now. -SH' And as he's putting his phone away, he stops and retracts his hand, turning on his phone to send another text. 'Please. ,' it reads. Within minutes, Lestrade has sent back a text. 'On my way.'
"That's what you need young man. But I'm assuming that's not going to happen is it, hm?" she replies with a knowing smile.
Footsteps roar through the hallway. There are hands on Sherlock, pulling him away. Sherlock pulls back, he doesn't want to leave John's side.
"No, here let me," Sherlock stands and swiftly rounds the bed and takes the cup and pitcher before John can get to it. He pours the cool water into the cup and hands it to John. It lingers intermittently between their hands before they both pull away, one hand with a cup, one hand empty.
But the words aren't said harshly like Sherlock had meant them to. They're weak, and by the last word his voice is trembling. Mycroft lays a hand on Sherlock's shoulder, and Sherlock turns away, not even wanting to notice the gesture.
"You and Molly Hooper are in agreement; she told me that earlier. I really won't be long, there's no need to—"
The elevator dings open and Sherlock steps in, alone, pushing the button for level three. He pulls out his phone to text Molly his mental checklist. When the elevator doors open again Sherlock is met with a waft of sanitized air. He steps out of the elevator and dodges a oncoming gurney and heads straight in the direction John's room, following the signs. A few people give him sideways glances as he walks by; he should have brought that damn hat, as if that would have helped in this situation anyway.
"Good God, you're incessant." Sherlock grumbles as he steps through the door into the hallway. There's a few nurses minding about but otherwise the floor is relatively quiet.
"–We've just seen Mr. Watson's CT and he's made profound progress. His cranial and inter-cranial swelling has gone down just about eighty-eighty percent."
Sherlock promised Molly he'd go home. Since when did he keep promises like that? It's eight-thirty. Mrs. Hudson will be wondering where he is, he might as well go home. He appreciates the motherly attitude she has towards him, even if he doesn't show it all the time.
"I thought John might like a watch." It's a loaded sentence and John can see it hit Sherlock square in the chest.
He's lost his attention now. Sherlock's looking past John and into the corner of the wall, no longer listening.
Lestrade gives a grim, half smile, one side of his mouth raises, "My initial list, yeah. Mind telling me what exactly needs fixing?"
His sheets smell clean and fresh; Mrs. Hudson's done laundry then. She's going above and beyond these days. He ought to thank her, that's normally John's job. Sherlock just adds a, 'yes, thank you' and that's it. He could probably do better.
"Hey," John leans his head down to meet Sherlock's drifting gaze, "You can just sleep here if you want. Bed might be a bit small but I can move over."
Sherlock stays like this for an hour. He would have sat longer if Molly hadn't come back when she did.
The doctor understands, "Yes, 'but'. Even after we repair the tissue there will still be cranial swelling. Once he's out of surgery we'll be putting him into a medically induced coma so nothing can hinder the swelling from going down."
'You know what I mean, Sherlock. And according to hospital records, they're your affairs as well? Power of attorney, how fitting.'
Sherlock delivers a noncommittal grunt and shifts back back to staring at the wall beyond John's left shoulder. Mycroft turns his attention to John, staring right into John with his cold, knowing eyes.
The doctors are still not aware of Sherlock's presence so he pulls his eyes from John and clears this throat. The doctors all turn to face him and a nurse looks up from from a monitor.
Dr. Wallace jumps back in, "Yes, of course. We are going to prescribe a number of medications upon his release, and we'll explain when and how he should take them to the both of you."
"Ah, Mr. Holmes, I presume. Miss Hooper told me you'd be arriving soon. I'm Dr. Wallace, head surgeon on John's team."
Mrs. Hudson stayed home with Rosie as expected. She was already up when Sherlock dropped Rosie off downstairs at six in the morning. She nearly shoved Sherlock out of the flat so she and Rosie could have some "much needed quality godmother-goddaughter time," whatever that meant.
For those who don't remember, Bill Wiggins  (referred to as just'Bill' in the chapter) is Sherlock's self proclaimed 'protégé.' He makes appearances in His Last Vow and The Lying Detective.
It's nearly midnight when Sherlock finishes. He's not thoroughly convinced, but enough where he can't completely dismiss the idea just yet. It still seems useless or silly to him though.
Sherlock has people. Friends. Right, he has friends? There's Lestrade. Molly. Mrs. Hudson's more like family, and John... well he has John too. Or, at least he
Dr. Wallace begins, "They've been recently changed, Mr. Holmes. From a..." he flips some papers back on his clipboard, "from a... Mrs. Mary Watson to a Mr. Sherlock Holmes."
fault. I mean, don't get me wrong, a lot of things are, but not this. Not this time. Stop taking credit where it isn't due, ok? I mean, really."
There is so much blood coming from John. Sherlock tries desperately to slow its steady stream, but to no avail. He knows that bleeding is one of the things that can kill John here and now, so he applies more pressure. Sherlock's hands are drenched in blood and so is the rest of him. Sherlock can feel John's breath slowing.
How much did John hear? Sherlock lost control of what he was saying when he found John. The words just came out. He was so scared he was going to lose John then and there he, he-
"Good morning, Mr. Holmes. How are you holding up?" a male doctor extends his hand and Sherlock shakes it.
There's is silence on both ends of the phone. There has been a lot of that lately. Sherlock breaks it first, "Thank you, Molly."
Eventually, Sherlock does pull away, but he doesn't lose contact completely. He takes Mrs. Hudson's hand that was in his hair and gives it a gently squeeze.
It's late, and all Sherlock can hear outside is the faint, distant sound of sirens and driving cars. How did all this happen to them? What sent he and John on this course of doom? Could it have been prevented? Probably not, Sherlock and John have always had a way of intermingling with trouble.
Mrs. Hudson hugs Sherlock tighter. But then springs back, tears in her eyes, "Oh, our poor John. He'll be fine though, right? You two always are. I'll make you some tea."
"Then what!? What's happening here!? If you're not interested in apologies or explanations, what are you are you here for, Sherlock!? I don't know- I don't know what- God dammit!"
Sherlock is not having Mycroft's games. At all. 'Your sarcasm is hilarious, Mycroft. Can you detect mine? "
"Go back inside, Sherlock," and that's all he says before walking down the hallway as quietly as he had arrived.
"Yeah, maybe that'd be best," John says apprehensively looking over to Sherlock, who turns around just as he finishes.
"Don't you dare start to console me like everyone else. It won't fix the anything. And if you're wondering if I'm clean? As a whistle. Did I cover everything?"
John smiles down from his place in the bed at him, "Alright. Here, let me," John let's go of Sherlock's hand to help him shift himself over on the bed. Mid-shift he releases a breath that prompts Sherlock to say, "Be careful." John pauses to look at him with a smile, "I'm okay. Come on."
When they've finally gone through all the cases, and after Lestrade has complained about his coworkers to an uninterested Sherlock, they're left with a bigger issue at hand.
But their conversation was interrupted by a knock at the door. Wherever the conversation was going, it would have to wait.
Sherlock brushes his teeth and changes into his pajamas. He's not tired but he could wake Rosie if he stays in the living room, so he might as well sleep.
"JOHN! John, you have to listen to me! You have to stay awake! Please, they're almost here! I know it hurts, but you have to stay strong! Please! .... There—" Another sob. "There are things I need to say to you. You have to stay strong okay? Please, you've got to be really brave for me. Fight like the soldier I know you are..." More shuttered breaths.
Sherlock can't loose John. He has just gotten him back. Not now. There are so many things he needs to say.
But John won't have it. He's done playing games. 'Games' got him hurt. Got his wife killed. He simply waits for a real answer.
Sherlock hesitates before standing a bit and pulling his chair up to the bed. His knees bump the plastic side and his shins hit the edge. John let's his hand unfold in front of Sherlock. He raises his eyebrows a bit as he offers his next sentence.
Deep breath. Another deep breath. A self-pitiful sigh. What was he doing? A fold inward of the lips, and then, "Ok.
"I'll go get Rosie all loaded up in it, why don't you take this out to the car," Stella hands the diaper bag to Sherlock and he walks through the door to the street, grabbing the crib on the way. The car Mycroft sent for him is waiting, the soft hum of the engine sounding. The driver gets out and takes the bag and crib from Sherlock and puts them in the trunk, then opens the door for Sherlock to get in.
Sherlock doesn't respond nor make any intention to, he just stands there, staring down at John from his wounded eyes.
"Well, I presume he will be during his recovery. And in all honesty, he doesn't have the money to hire a caretaker, and he knows that. Plus, he's fallen out with his sister, so no place there. It only makes sense. Why, do you think he won't want to?"
Sherlock helps Mrs. Hudson slip into her coat and then bundle up Rosie before he holds the door open for the both of them. Mrs. Hudson pauses in the doorway and presses a kiss to Sherlock's free hand.
Sherlock doesn't even reply to the last text. He's tired of Mycroft and his all seeing eye. He shoves his phone back into his chest pocket and glares back out the window, now reflecting back the image of a angry Sherlock. He looks tired, there are bags under his eyes. He hasn't slept at all for at least a few days. Even if he's tired, he'll wake up in the middle of the night, sometimes as a the result of an occasional nightmare. He's lost quite a bit of weight too, his suit appearing just a bit big on his bony form. John was always good about getting Sherlock to eat. If John hadn't been around all those years, Sherlock would probably be as thin and sick as a skeleton. An example of one of the many ways John Watson saved Sherlock Holmes.
"Alright! Here we are! She's a little sleepy so the car ride should be pretty quiet. I'll just set her car seat up. Why don't you watch," she sets Rosie and the car seat on the backseat and begins to demonstrate, "You clip in the buckle here and tighten the strap here. To take it out just unbuckle. That's all there is, simple enough."
He feels light headed and out of breath, he pinches his nose. His breathing is coming too quickly and his lungs feel too weak to catch up.
"John!? John you have to stay strong! Please! For Rosie! For Mrs. Hudson," Sherlock chokes back a sob. Tears he didn't even know were there are falling on John's blank face, "for me."
Dr. Andrews appears taken back, but regains her composure and clears her throat, "Well, that would be up to you."
It's not ten minutes until Molly is sitting next to Sherlock. He doesn't look up when turns to him. She places a tentative hand upon his.
The female doctor clears her throat, calling attention to herself, "With everything Dr. Wallace has told you,—"
This isn't fair. John has saved Sherlock countless times over: When Sherlock had no one, John moved in with him. When Sherlock doubted himself, John only saw reality. When Sherlock was being torn down by the public, John believed in him irrevocably. And now? John is lying in a hospital bed as a reward.
"Martha, pleased to meet you dear. And this is Rosie, John's daughter," she shows off the baby on her hip proudly.
With the internet only proving skeptical, Sherlock sets aside his laptop, stands, and shuffles off to his room. His sheets are cold and feel rough against his skin. Every creak and crack from the flat sounds louder than it should, and Sherlock's mind melts into empty agitation.
The doctor nearest to Sherlock speaks, "He's suffering from a severe laceration to the head. We've controlled the bleeding but there is a large amount of swelling. We're going to finish repairing the cranial tissue now."
I'm SO SO SO SORRY I haven't posted. Believe me I wanted to, I just couldn't find the time! I'm hoping things won't be so crazy soon and I'll be able to write more. Hopefully the chapter pleases <3
Sherlock is breathing heavily. His fingers are clenched tightly into fists at his sides. Lestrade looks shocked at the outburst.
You... Mrs. Hudson says you keep me out of trouble. I guess she's right in a way. Huh, it's pathetic isn't it. You try and keep me out of trouble and all I do is drag you into it. I'm not good for you. Or Rosie for that matter. So, if you wake up, I promise I'll- I promise I'll leave you be. You and Rosie deserve better.
"This should be everything you'll be needing. Bottles, formula, wipes, diapers, clothes, blankets, soaps. Right there's a crib," Stella points to a folded up crib by the door, "And this is her favorite stuffed animal," she holds up a little stuffed bumblebee before putting it into the diaper bag, "Should I grab the car seat?"
Sherlock narrows his eyes at the man, and in turn Lestrade shifts uncomfortably in his chair. "Hospital took care of it. She's coming down later."
"I said you're not allowed to do that, Sherlock. We're all worried for John here, and we can't afford to be worried about you too. What am I saying, we're always worried about you. You will go home and sleep. The doctors will be fine here without your hovering all the time!"
It's not long before sleep actually pulls at Sherlock. He doesn't want to go into his mind palace, for fear of dropping or letting Rosie slip, so there is nothing to distract him from exhaustion. Tomorrow will be a long day. Maybe sleep wouldn't be the worst idea.
One more thing for Sherlock to add to his list of things to worry about.' John, plus nightmares, does not equal compatibility.
"Incredibly lucky is what he is. If the bullet were any further to the left... well, he wouldn't be here. We've hooked him up to a ventilator, heart monitor, colostomy system, and he's being given a high dosage of the usual anesthetics to keep him under," the doctor waves his hand at each system as he names them.
John disregards Sherlock comment and asks his own question, "What about you? You must be exhausted. The nurse told me you were you up till early this morning?"
The house is different. Not as tidy as it used to be. Everything is out of place, but not messy per say. Sherlock doesn't know whether to sit, or stand, or speak, but the choice is made for him.
John watches Sherlock swallow and keeps going. "Bits and pieces only. You were there. You..." His eyes dart back and forth across his blankets and he tries to remember. "You were crying."
After a while, a nurse comes in and Sherlock let's her make her rounds with all the machines. After about a minute the nurse speaks, "He can hear you, you know."
Once Mrs. Hudson leaves, Sherlock prepares Rosie's crib. This seemingly menial task is proving difficult when he has a a baby on one hip and only one free hand. Sherlock lays a soft blue blanket down first, and slowly and gently lays Rosie down on it.
It isn't until seven until the very last person leaves the room. People were constantly shuffling in and out, adding new settings on the monitors, checking John's pulse. But finally, Dr. Andrews came in for one last overview and no one has been back since.
"Hey. Got us some dinner," Molly says as she walks in, holding up a takeout bag. She sets another bag down, presumably filled with John's things.
And then Sherlock's face changes. It's heartbreaking for John to watch. "I'm lost, John. I'm so lost."
There's a rustle beside the bed and John can see Sherlock slowly waking up. Sherlock blinks a few times before his eyes open wide. His mouth parts the slightest bit.
After that, Sherlock was left alone for a couple of hours. He mostly sat and thought; perched up in a tiny hospital chair, not making a single sound. Every once and a while he'd jot something down or send a text, mostly creating future experiments.
Sherlock is searching John's face, thinking over what John has just offered him. He needs to answer, John is waiting for an answer.
Sherlock's thoughts are abruptly interrupted by shuffling and he glances over his shoulder at the source.
But you have to wake up. That's the deal. I couldn't live knowing I did this to you. I couldn't live, I couldn't live without you.
"Because you're the only one, Sherlock. You're the only one who can get through to him. You're the only one who truly knows John Watson."
Sherlock speaks again. His words come quickly, strained, "You recovered quite fast. Faster than they had seen before."
"John!? John! It's going to be alright, you're going to be fine. I called Lestrade, he and his team are coming, so is an ambulance. You just have to make it until then alright!? Oh god, John! I'm so sorry!"
That's all that needs to be said. One simple word and John knows, this topic is not to be discussed. He can hear it in the tone, the punctuated 'd,' Sherlock is not going to talk about it.
"Yes, the brain will most likely experience residual trauma mentally. Mr. Watson could quite possibly experience a few nightmares."
Sherlock can feel the exhaustion pulling at him again. How nice it would be to give in to it. Tomorrow will definitely be long. He knows that John's swelling could (best case scenario) be decreasing by tomorrow. John will still be in the hospital for a while though. More separation.
The rest of the nurses swarm upon John. Each delving onto a different machine. They even took the ventilator. Sherlock questions them on this, "Won't he be needing that to breathe?" he asks, raising a hand and finger to point.
Siger opened of the doors to the vehicle and assisted Mrs. Hudson getting in. He climbed in beside her.
"I can only assume you failing to address me correctly is a desire to be punished? More than your current predicament."
With his collar chained to the bench, John gripped both of his sub’s wrists in his hands as tightly as he could as he removed them from one another. He knew the brat would fight and he was ready for it. He pressed one up his back so his fingers were between his shoulder blades, and completely still before he did anything with the second.
"Well, you got one thing right. You've certainly been attention seeking." John crossed his arms and looked at Sherlock with a blank face. "I just don't know."
Greg chuckled warmly. As he continued humping his boy, he gently bit Mycroft’s shoulder. The resulting moan just made the Superintendent’s cock harder. “Ahh, look at you all cute and complaining.”
Slowly, the youngest of the three obeyed, his elbows knocking into the wall, as he was behaving and not lowering them even though he doubted he would be in any more trouble if he did.
At the look on Sherlock's face, Mycroft almost lost it. He was suddenly much happier with Greg's choice of clothing for him.
“I don't know!” His voice rose in annoyance, he still couldn't believe that he actually didn't. The place he ended up was far too complicated for him to have tracked. He didn't know why he wasn't mentioning it to anyone except his brother. His brother that had disappeared. Abandoned him. Left him with... her.
“I’m going to collect something from my study at the end of the hall, when I return we’ll practice rule one.”
John looked up just in time to watch Sherlock flicking his finger across the screen of a phone, declining a call. Greg's call.
They'd probably have the boy’s entire future planned out within hours. John smiled as he snorted. He'd just have to do his best to help Finn thwart their plans whenever it was needed in the years to come. He knew his would have to be the voice of sanity.
“I know you haven’t decided anything yet,” John started. “But is it something we need to speak to Finn about?” He saw his face and immediately apologised, “sorry babe I know you’re in Finn mode.”
The Dom took great pleasure in washing Sherlock's hair. He loved the feel of the sudsy curls under his fingers. After they were rinsed, the sub dropped down to his knees and began nosing at John's cock.
“No. I have some work to complete at the desk,” he nodded to the one in the corner as he unclipped his leash. “But I'm not taking any chances with you.” He couldn't attach the leash to anything else because he had told his sub he was free to roam around the room so he took the leash with him to the corner.
"I'm sorry, sir," he whispered softly. He was pressing his head into the carpet as hard as he could to remain focused and not give John another reason to add more pain to his backside.
Mycroft wondered how long they had before the two women showed up again. He hoped it would be a good while. Sherlock needed the time to find his equilibrium.
"I don't give a shit what you want," John stated. "Your opinion is invalid and your wants are out the fucking window."
Finn opened his eyes and hugged Sherlock. He'd been pretending to sleep. "I don't want to go away from you!"
When he still refused to move, John bent down, picked him up by the scruff of the neck and dragged him inside the house, slamming the door shut with his foot. At no point did the detective use his feet.
"Sh, pet," Greg said softly. "It's time for bed. We're just getting you ready." He smoothed down Mycroft's thinning hair as John made swift work of untying the rope harness while Greg removed the gag.
"No, sir." Sherlock actually hoped John would hurry up and cage him. It would be better than staying in the humbler.
The fucking machine had turned itself off, having a time limit on operation, so John didn't have to turn it off, but he would have to remove the dildo attachment from his pet's hole... eventually. He really wasn't in a hurry.
“Yes, sir,” Sherlock whimpered. He wanted nothing more than to curl up in a ball and ignore the man that had caused the waves of agony to run through his groin, but ignoring the older man, now, would have unforeseen consequences. His hands stayed interlocked behind his head and he kept his head low
He had still seemed tense, but not overly so, given the circumstances. Instead of leaving his leash hanging, he had attached it to the floor in an offering of comfort which Sherlock seemed to recognise now. He would need to get used to other people soon. He couldn’t keep him collared and in the house indefinitely. He was meant to be training him and with that came being a good sub in public circumstances, not just areas they saw as safe. One unknown member of society was the perfect way to ease him into it… or so he thought.
Surprised, John didn't have the heart to push him away, despite still being mad about his race around London. He fully intended to find out what caused it but he couldn't bring himself to be hard and stern right now when Sherlock seemed so... Compliant. It was so rare he should treasure the moment really.
When they reached the lake there, were 2 ducks on it, John was most surprised. Sherlock had to stop himself from chasing them like a child.
This chapter is tougher than normal, mainly because I feel sherlock is not responding the way he should be by this point in the contract. John has to do something he hadn’t thought he would have to do so things may be harsher. JOHN KNOWS WHAT HE IS DOING. And it will not always be like this.
Eurus grabbed Sherlock's curls again and dragged him to the window, it looked out over the cells. In the distance, the detective could see his brother and Irene.
He pulled himself up onto the ledge and looked around. The angled part of the roof wasn’t that high, within about a yard was a ledge and he knew from the outside view that it was flat to the edge of the rather big roof.
“So what d'you think?” The cabbie looked up at Sherlock, “Shall we?” Apparently just looking at the detective wasn't enough. He stood up so he was the same height. “Really, what do you think? Can you beat me? Are you clever enough to bet your life?”
“No, I’m fine, sir. Thank you.” Sherlock’s voice sounded so distant and broken. John sighed and made his way out of the room, intent on getting two cups of tea and giving the comfort and aftercare Sherlock so needed after such a thorough punishment.
"It doesn't matter." Sherlock walked off, but in the direction of the house and not in the direction of the ice cream parlour the other side of the chip shop.
"Mm, y-yes, sir." Greg did know and that somehow made it all the more intense. The next two pumps of the fleshlight felt even better, but then it disappeared, leaving his cock bare and aching.
John didn't say anything as he punched the code to the room into the system and dragged the unresisting detective behind him. He dumped him on the bed and used his already chained up hands and feet to attach him to the bed.
John smiled, running his chin across his hair once more before releasing him. He held his hand out, still remembering just how much Sherlock appreciated it, such a simple thing. A warm hand found his and he tugged gently towards the stairs. “Come on, then.”
"It's Irene's little pet name for you. Jim liked it too." She tried it out again. "Ice Man. Ice. Man. Iceman. Oh, I like it."
The detective scooped Finn back up, then proceeded to the mini bus where he buckled him into the booster seat.
As soon as the sub had settled between the two Doms, John rolled onto his side and rested his head on his shoulder.
John glanced down, where his cock was caged, it was clear he should have been hard as precome dribbled from the tip. "Look at you, boy, making a mess all over the floor. Naughty boy." His next swoosh of the crop was a little harder.
They were both surprised by that revelation. John had secretly guessed, given his actions on his fifth day, but it was still a shock to hear them said aloud, especially from the only person he had ever met had seemed to think he wasn’t allowed his own emotions. Then it dawned on him what his sub had said and he hastened to reassure his pet, “I’m not going to make you go anywhere, pet. I just needed to be sure this is what you want. You were quite out of it last night with Panic and the sedative I gave you. It wouldn’t have been right to assume-”
The sub sighed at the 'boy'. He hadn't realised how much he had grown to despise it. Nearly as much as that chair.
"John, may I have a word?" Mycroft asked glancing at his brother's Dom. It had been a solid 3 hours and Sherlock hadn't said a word. He had eaten a fair bit of his pizza though, which had surprised them all.
The detective lay there, completely still, unable to fight it or move with it. He had been tied securely down. Even more so when John paced around him tugging the straps tighter still. He couldn't believe he had the sound in still, he was looking forward to a break from it. How was he supposed to know the bloody thing was hollow?
The boy’s eyes widened at that but he nodded once, he could hardly say no even if he didn’t understand it.
Sherlock jumped into his Mind Palace quickly and passed on the names of the victims and their addresses.
“It’s 7 o’clock, pet.” John gently rocked him. He found his internal body alarm useful in times like this. It meant he could fall asleep practically anywhere, including the playroom which he didn’t usually sleep in, and not have to worry about sleeping late. Sleeping in at times when he had a sub around could become disastrous. The sub needed routine and a clear divide between rules and consequences, therefore if the reason the sub slept in was because the Dom had, it would present complications.
“Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.” He should have been angry at that. Not being able to use all of his equipment, but he wasn't. The Dom was right, he hadn't earned it and John had been quite clear what had to happen in order to get it all unlocked.
Mycroft couldn't hold still. He kept shifting his weight back and fourth from one knee to the other.
“Do you remember a few weeks ago when you tried getting out of my house and ended up stuck in the press up position?” he asked as he paced towards him.
"You knock the chair over, I will expect you to keep fucking yourself so if you can do that horizontally do continue your little tantrum."
Sherlock chewed, wondering if it would be worth it just to not tell him. He would tell Mycroft, and the bastard was smug enough.
"It's better than letting one or both of you beat him half to death to get him to cooperate," Mycroft barked back.
With a glance at the other Dom and the only sub in the room, John stood immediately and went to the flat door.
“He’ll open up when I make him. I’m not having him hiding things but he can sleep for now. He clearly needs it.” He ran his hand lovingly through the older man’s hair, he didn’t even stir.
A further 20 minutes later and John began removing the chains holding him on the chair. He helped ease him up off dildo with an odd slurping sound.
Just after lunch, John gave him an hour with strict instructions to be back within the allotted time and not to go into the playroom. Sherlock grinned to himself, this was his chance!
Not trusting himself to speak, the government official nodded, then dropped his head forward to rest on Greg's shoulder. The Superintendent stepped back and Mycroft fell to his knees.
Sherlock sighed, not looking at either Dom. Right now he just wanted to scream and shout at the pain resonating down his leg.
John got the driver to pull over at the end of the street so Sherlock had the chance to pace, stretch his legs and clear his head of any worries over anything they had just discussed. He pulled him from the back of the car, resting as much weight as he could on his stick. He held him by the hand. “Come on, pet.”
“Why?” She repeated. John was just about as annoyed by the four words this women had spoken as he had ever been before, in fact the bubble of anger rising up inside of him was verging on an explosion. The way she called him
"Now what?" Mycroft asked. For once, he couldn't work out what the hell was going on with his little brother and at he moment, he didn't really care.
Sherlock sighed in relief, he wanted to say he didn't understand Finn's continual lack of assurance in them, but he did, all too well.
Greg got to his feet and pushed Mycroft into the wall, bringing his arms around behind him, he cuffed them there. Then he spun his brat around, pressed him back into the wall and put his lips to his.
John was quick but paced himself and the strokes to ensure they covered his whole arse. After 10 he could feel the heat radiating off the younger man’s arse.
Greg melted into it, clearing being caught by surprise as well. "This is nice, sir," he whispered when they broke apart. "Just the two of us."
Greg ran one hand through his pet's thinning hair, with the other, he held the bottle of water until Sherlock had finished it.
The latch slid open with a grind. “What?” grumped the Sergeant on the other side, Sherlock smirked, realising how right he was.
Mycroft sighed, “I know, little brother, I'm sorry.” He hated that Sherlock got caught up in his affairs, it was hardly fair.
Mycroft's response pleased Greg even more. His boy was being especially good today, beyond his little slip up a few minutes before.
John managed to hold in his laugh long enough to mute the call again. He wasn’t the only one, Mrs. Hudson was chuckling silently too.
John gathered up a mug of tea, milky and sweet the way his boy liked it and placed it in his hands. “Drink, pet, we'll take as long as you need.” He kissed him again. “You've been such a good boy for me today. You're forgiven for last week, ok?”
Siger kissed his cheek. "No, but you could have fallen. We don't want that either. Your dad is rather high up from the ground."
Once he was in a tight as possible hogtie, John fetched a gag for him. He’d had enough of his noise. He pressed the ball between his teeth and let him fight the urge to bite into it as he buckled it up behind his head.
“Unless I have expressed permission from you, sir.” Sherlock was defeated now, shoulders rounded, head down.
The DI was proud of his boyfriend. Mycroft had always been protective of Sherlock, but finding out he had failed him in such a basic way had taken its toll. Instead of wallowing in it, however, the government official had done what was needed to help, even when that meant giving Sherlock his space. Greg knew it hadn't been easy for him.
Sherlock continued counting as soon as Mycroft's feet had been restrained and Irene had resumed. He frowned as she kept going, almost as if she was afraid to stop.
“I was hoping we could play together in here first rather than punishment, but you had to try and run off.”
The Superintendent removed the plug and everything flowed gracelessly from Sherlock's hole into the bucket. The detective turned an even brighter red beneath the hood as the process completed itself. John flushed the waste away, then he used a hose to wash his boy down before using the towel to dry him off.
Irene petted Sherlock's curls absently as she regarded Mycroft. "Eurus, dear, I've always found it amusing that the Ice Man has issues with body image. He's actually quite lovely to look at."
As they stepped under the spray, the Dom pushed him to his knees, his hands on the taller man’s shoulders.
When the Dom had Sherlock tied down to the bench, with many more straps and buckles than he'd used before, he heard Sherlock sigh. He hoped it was content, because it didn't sound like frustration. The detective was left looking upwards and his ankles were uncomfortably held to the bench.
John played with the code for a while, making a point to change it to something completely random, even Sherlock couldn't predict random.
“Who are you?” Sherlock asked without caution. He didn't care anymore. What did he have left to lose after all?
“Sit there, on the top step,” John's voice was dangerously low. “And if you even think about answering back, think it through.”
Sherlock moved to comply immediately. He knew where the bench was in the room and he was happy he could get to it with ease, even without being able to see. When he reached it, he settled himself over the bench, his caged cock hanging over the edge.
He grabbed John as soon as he raced out and shoved him into the wall with a thud. A few grunts and yells later and the doctor was pressed up against the wall, his right arm up his back, his hand between his shoulder blades and a set of cuffs wrapped around his left wrist.
"Perhaps we can arrange a time to get together for you to see for yourself? Properly, I mean, not at work."
"Shut up, boy." Greg wasn't sure how to change the position of the machine so he would have to wait for John, but he could uncuff the younger man and redo them up in front of him.
Rather than make a snarky comeback, the detective just smiled. He didn't feel like eating and he wasn't going to let anyone try to make him. He slipped into the living room and over to one of the windows.
He continued on relentlessly, he couldn’t stop for too long between hits. Sherlock would wonder what was going on and may be led to think John was going soft, he couldn’t allow that sort of weakness to show. It would make it worse for the boy. It was easier to get it all out of the way and then they could curl up for a while.
Sherlock ducked his head and closed his eyes. He knew he shouldn't have run off, he knew it was wrong, but he'd done it anyway and then he had been caught by some mad man. That bit wasn't his fault, but John didn't seem to care.
He didn't know how he did it but he manage to slip one wrist free of the cuffs. Before he could do anything to help his brother, guards charged in.
Random students wandered around and no one once questioned why he was there. The anonymity was nice. He wondered why Mycroft hadn't come after him. He supposed John hadn't bothered to tell him about the stink bomb.
“I got accosted by Mrs. Hudson.” Greg picked the little boy up and hugged him. "Have you been taking care of John and Sherlock?" he asked.
“I invited him for tea, I thought he would want to see how you were doing, but more importantly discuss a few things. Especially after last week’s escapade.” John now knew that Sherlock saw the government official for the protective big brother he was rather than an interfering hinderance he had seen him as before.
“You’re learning. I expect you to get fed up and frustrated. This will stop you inevitably biting me.”
John didn't know how to react to any of this, but what the DI had just said reminded him of the Doms he hadn't managed to run rings around. The ones that were probably in similar cells to his sub.
At that, John rolled his eyes. "No, you git. This is about making you feel good and making it last so long that when I do finally let you come, you'll be screaming."
The pile of fish had grown to quite a size. Mycroft cocked his head to the side. "John. I mean, sir, don't you think that's quite enough?"
"And I fucking gave you a chance. You felt like pushing your luck, well you'll know about it now." John used his foot to hook a bench that was against the wall and pull it into the centre of the room. He threw Sherlock over it face first. "Don't even think about moving." He went over to the suitcase that held their toys and started rummaging through it. He came back with rope and began wrapping it around Sherlock's body, tying his already cuffed arms to his back, then he began tying him to the bench starting at his neck and heading down his back.
Mycroft sighed. "You would get just as much, if not more attention from John if you behaved. Not to mention you might enjoy it more."
He leant back against the wall and watched him for a while, he was so peaceful while he slept, it was unlikely to continue when he woke up.
The man laughed and Sherlock groaned, knowing John wasn’t coming. The kitchen was quite a distance away. For all he knew John was in on this.
John made sure he was thorough enough so damage wouldn't be done to the boy, but not too thorough that there'd be no burn. It was discipline after all.
“Whether or not my client has a Dominant is beside the point. This line of questioning could be seen as intimidation.”
It was clear to the Dom, the confusion on Sherlock's face. He dropped to his haunches and held his face in both his hands.
The grumpy old man rang off without so much as a good bye. The DI found himself somewhat glad, it wasn't all relying on him now.
Sherlock growled his frustration and discomfort even as he renewed his struggles. John stood and, without a word of warning, brought the riding crop down across the plumpest part of his sub's arse.
Sherlock himself was quite pet like. Many subs were similar, but the detective also had a bit of a praise kink. That combined with the fact that he could be very cat like when he was in a quiet mood could present countless opportunities as well as countless problems.
The four of them sat there like idiots for a long time. It reminded John of the day before when he had ended up having to follow his sub up to the apartment after Sherlock's worrying performance. He gripped his boy's hand all the tighter. A sense of unease growing despite the pleasantness of the moment.
"You boys have decisions to make," John randomly blurted out. "You have a choice between walking along the beach or getting an orgasm."
Sherlock crossed his arms and rolled away so his back was to the two Doms. That had the unfortunate effect of putting his arse in prime smacking position.
"Nothing is wrong, sir." He returned his attention to the window, hoping they were nearly at John's so that he could hide away.
"I don't understand, sir," Sherlock whispered but it was unclear as to which Dom he was talking to, his own, or his brother's.
“He didn’t,” the boy countered immediately and Greg saw some of the old Sherlock back in that act alone, it had been quick and snapped and almost definitely not thought through. He raised an unimpressed eyebrow at the younger man and Sherlock looked away. Even so, he couldn’t believe the fact that he was sticking up for his brother, something he had never seen him do when Panic hadn’t been involved. He was definitely going to tell Mycroft this little fact, hopefully he would take it the right way and treasure it for the sentiment it was and not use it to hold over his baby brother’s head.
"If they leg it, the cuddling is off." John turned and shouted at the brothers. "Do you hear that? If you leg it, the cuddling is off!"
Greg did just that, but John didn't make a move to open him up or fuck him, just left him bent over it while he fucked his cock with hand.
The boy jerked, he had clearly been deep in thought, for a change. “Yes, sir. Nothing but…” He admitted.
The light came on in the room and a loud noise blared over the speaker system. Mycroft covered his brothers ears against the sound, then immediately felt guilty because Sherlock couldn't block it out himself. He pulled his jacket over Sherlock's shoulders and over his head.
Sherlock swallowed, feeling stupid. He had managed to do something wrong after staying still while he knelt.
John looked between them at the batter that was now full of chocolate chips and laughed. “I can see already that you two make quite the pair. Where did you get them from, Sherlock?”
"I've already given you a choice and you've already decided. That does not mean you can change your mind when you please."
“I'll be keeping a gag nearby, but for now…” he touched the cuffs and they separated. “You can get dressed.”
“Don’t be so dramatic, boy!” John said as he weighed the cage in his hand and Sherlock flinched. “It’s not like I’m chopping it off.”
“Get these cuffs off my brother!” Mycroft yelled out, still holding Sherlock. His gaze fell on the camera. “I'm assuming that's the reasoning behind the email I received?” The email he had received and hadn't wasted time opening. Even if he had known Moriarty had his little brother... would he have opened that email? It was unlikely anything in it would have given away their location. Moriarty was too clever for that.
Mycroft's worried eyes darted up to his Dom, before another sharp tug forced him to look at the younger Holmes who was in the process of being forcibly curled into his Dom's lap on the opposite side of the room.
The Superintendent finished drying of his sub, then dragged him through to the main bedroom where their clothes were. He opened up one of their bags and got out a complete outfit for Mycroft. Mycroft pouted at the jeans. The shirt at least was partly suitable. "Don't sulk on me now, Mycroft."
"Shut it. There are 4 people in this house. 2 of which you should show the upmost respect at all times."
The salads they made were grand enough to qualify as architectural masterpieces. They both put on lettuce tomatoes, peppers, radishes and bacon. When Finn added eggs, Sherlock made a disgusted look.
Irene laughed but Eurus frowned. "A doctor who wasn't gay 10 years ago and a daughter that isn't his."
John ran his hand along Sherlock's back, not pinching or scratching, just rubbing smoothly along his spine. He watched his boy closely for further signs of rebelliousness, but for now he seemed to be calming down.
"Engraved in gold. Maybe I will." John picked up Sherlock's coffee. "Would you like a drink now, trouble?"
The lowering of the kneeling man’s head was the only response the doctor needed. “I am not against the additional surveillance, now more than ever, seeing as the sort of people this one has had the misfortune of meeting, but I should have been told!”
Sherlock didn't know what to do. He wanted to kneel, but didn't want to at the crime scene. He also didn't know where his ‘wanting to please John’ attitude had gone.
John had met subs like Sherlock before. That was his job after all, but they genuinely didn’t want to give in, to submit. John could tell just after a few hours of Sherlock’s company that he wanted to submit, he just didn’t want to want to. He liked it but he didn’t want to like it, or felt like he shouldn’t. This was new. John was seeing things in the younger man in a way he’d never seen in any of his subs before, so by giving him a consequence that was time sensitive, Sherlock felt like he was in control when in fact the younger man’s fate was entirely in the blond's hands.
“Vienetta?” John asked after a moment. It was clear the detective wasn’t going to continue unassisted and he wanted to change the conversation slightly. He didn’t want to appear to force information out of the younger man. He needed to talk in his own time. When he was ready.
"And you aren't partaking in it. How can I trust you? Greg will go to his submissive for help, the case will get solved and you can go out to play on the next one. If I am guaranteed of your behaviour."
"Let's go through to the den," John offered, passing Mycroft his brother's crutches and picking the detective up in his arms.
"I can take these clamps off the both of you, but you have to do exactly as I say, Sherlock." She gave his cock a couple of pumps that did nothing but repulse him.
“Your attitude is not helping your situation, Sherlock. I would have thought after a month, you would be well aware of this.” He picked up his stick again and began to pace around the kneeling sub. “Punishment from Dom to sub is for the benefit of learning a lesson as well as letting the submissive feel guilt free. You know this. Now crawl to the clothes in that pile and get changed. You won’t just drop your suit on the floor either, you will lay it over the back of the chair and deal with it later.”
Rosie brightened at that and kissed him on the cheek. "You have to come too Uncle Mycroft and Greg." She let herself be put down.
As soon as he had reached the corner, he was bored. It had been different earlier with his brother in the room. He had a reason to be still; not showing himself up. Now it was depressing and the corner was dank with mould from some experiment that had gone sideways months ago. He huffed. This couldn’t be it, he knew. John was clever, extremely clever and extremely original when it came to his punishments. He knew there would be more and that thought didn’t fill him full of hope.
The blond inclined his head. “An emergency at Barts which has to take priority over this little skirmish. Take Sherlock home, have the staff restrain him to the bed in the playroom - punishment side, I’ll be back when I can.”
With a great huff, the doctor took off after Sherlock, more than used to it. Fortunately, the detective was running back towards the house. If he had taken off into the night, he would have been impossible to track.
With a resigned sigh he walk down one street and out the other side, into another. There had to be a hotel around here, somewhere he could sleep in. He found himself completely exhausted, but as he stepped into the third alley in a few minutes he was grabbed from behind and thrown into the wall.
Siger held him tight, glancing at Sherlock and smiling broadly. Sherlock had helped more than one scared little boy when he had insisted he take him in. He’d given them all a family.
Mrs. Hudson finally unfroze and hugged Sherlock. "Oh, Im just so happy for you. I knew you two were right for each other that very first day."
He set about fingering his hole. Poking and prodding it slightly. “About time you had something back in here. I've been very lenient with you as of late. I won't be making that mistake again.”
As if he could answer what with the gag and the posture collar. He could, however, express his displeasure. The detective growled.
Eurus turned to look at her big brother. He looked faintly ill. Whether it was due to what had just been done to Sherlock or from Irene's words, she didn't know, but she certainly was having fun.
He immediately got to his feet. "Up you get, Sherlock. Head on back to the apartment, turn the bubbles on in the Jacuzzi and get 4 beers out of the fridge."
The guard marched over and snapped a leash to each of their collars, tying them both to the cage bars.
That had been a question, as indirect as it came across. He couldn't ignore it. "Yes, sir. Fine, sir."
“His anger did not stem from that. He was aware that you were more than capable of looking after him. It was the fact that the surveillance he had put in place had failed and went decidedly over the top with his response.”
Realising the respectful address of the Dom had gone somewhere and his tone had become somewhat whiny he shook his head. “No, sir. Sorry, sir.”
“Well done with him, seriously. I’d call you a saint but I’m sure you’ve just got the patience of one.”
Both Holmeses knew they weren't really being given a choice between an orgasm and a walk on the beach. They were being given the choice between an orgasm and an evening of suspending the BDSM games, an evening of cuddles, an evening of being treasured.
Eurus looked over her shoulder at the guard who was still wielding the crop. "I suppose you can stop now. Mycie looks like he could use a small break."
"Sherlock, what is this about?" They’d had a great morning, hadn’t they? He had been well behaved, he’d eaten and drank plenty which was becoming more and more the norm.. They had enjoyed each other’s company.
With a small smirk, he walked in like he owned the place, and held his brother's ID to the security disk by the first door. His smirk grew larger when the door opened, giving him entrance. It was all he could do not to give a first pump. What did his brother's ID not do? It was incredible.
“Another Dom then?” The idea that two of his previous Doms had been petty and abusive angered John, but he forced himself to remain atop of it, for Sherlock’s sake. He was scared enough at the moment as it was.
The doctor wasn’t surprised when the boy knelt beside him rather than sit down. Panic was just a spinoff of subspace after all.
“If the pain in my chest is anything to go by…” he trailed off, not really knowing where he was heading with that statement in the first place.
The intimate moment was cut off when John's phone rang. He took a step back from his sub and pulled it from his pocket.
It wasn't long before Sherlock was turned sideways on the sofa, his head in John's lap and his leg resting up on pillows. His ankle was wrapped in iced bandages and his knee had an ice pack resting on it. He was dosing in and out of awareness, John having given him some strong painkillers. He knew he'd have to keep an eye on Sherlock's mental reaction to such strong medication but he couldn't go on seeing Sherlock in so much pain and not saying a word.
Sherlock found John bouncing Finn on the bed. He smiled to himself and dressed quickly, glad that the little boy didn’t seem to be distressed any more.
"No, sir. Anthea phoned and wanted to check that the transactions were verified. I lied, of course because I knew you were up to something."
Finn reached for the detective's hand. They paused at the sinks to clean up, then they went back out into the restaurant.
John ignored him and within short order it was buckled to the bench, running perpendicular from his torso and soon enough his other wrist did the same. His feet quickly followed.
"I was hoping you were gonna tell me how you were going to prove to me you're sorry. But instead you want to get off?"
Sherlock abruptly moved even closer to the shape and reached out as if to touch it. John grabbed him about the waist and pulled him back.
He rubbed his thigh in a comforting way, “I know, pet. You’re doing well.” He went back to fiddling with the buckles and then crawled up between his legs. “I’m going to let you out now.” At that he nodded eagerly and the doctor couldn’t help but chuckle.
Straightening up, the Dom tweaked his tie then headed for the door, still ignoring the now growling man. He dimmed the lights down and shut the door behind him. He pulled up the app on his phone that held the security footage. It was clear he was still fighting.
"Stop fidgeting, boy, the last thing either of us want is you to be hurt in a way that could have been avoided by simple self control."
Carefully, Sherlock’s strong hand released his grip on his Dom’s shirt and allowed him to move away to gather the appropriate things to bandage his wrist securely. “Thank you,” he whispered and the look he received in response told John that this could very much be ok.
Mycroft had managed to focus enough to see what was happening to Sherlock. He didn't know if he would want to swap places with his little brother or not.
He was shoved to the floor again, his knees hitting the solid concrete hard enough to send a jerk up through him. He kept his eyes squeezed shut beneath the darkness that would be there if he opened them.
"I can only assume, once again, you're failing to address me appropriately on purpose. Seeing as I was saying the same damn thing mere hours ago."
That made John climb up the bed and sit on Mycroft's chest. He pulled his pants down and pressed his cock to Mycroft's mouth. "That should keep you quiet."
“Yes, sir,” the officer was clearly a sub himself because he flicked the lights and siren on immediately.
“How’s the case going?” He tried to engage the younger man in conversation, well aware he would have deduced who else was in the flat without opening his eyes. “Well?”
At that Sherlock began thrashing, the Dom merely sighed. He put him down before they reached the stairs and pulled his leash from his pocket. In no time he had Sherlock’s feet chained to his wrists and was dragging him up the stairs. He was just dead weight now, far heavier just less awkward.
Greg blushed as he looked down at his feet. "Let's just say I'd rather not piss you off. I don't want you holding any grudges against me when I'm knelt at your feet next time."
“I am going to punish you like never before.” It was a fair warning, but he should have already known. He really did deserve this.
At that, the Dom grinned back. He couldn’t believe how comfortable the brat was around him now. He knew that, at a drop of a hat, it could change. He knew there wasn’t 100% trust, not yet, but it would continue to get steadily better. “You arrogant sod.”
Anticipating what his Dom was about to say, Sherlock grabbed his hand, not caring who saw and shook his head firmly. “No, sir. Sally isn’t going to stop you.”
Sherlock shook is head, he would never bite the Dom! But John just smirked in response to his look. “I think I know you better than you know yourself, boy.” At the sub’s further frown, he continued. “How many times in the last 10 minutes would you have made inappropriate comments or argued with me? Being gagged has kept your tally low, has it not?”
Sherlock didn't reply, John reached around him and flicked the shower off. "Come on, babe," he took him by the hand and dragged him out of the bathroom.
Mycroft settled by his Dom happily, but he cast a worried frown in his brother's direction. He couldn't help but fret over him. At the touch of Greg's hand on his shoulder, however, he returned his attention to his Dom.
“So he won't be in his shirt and trousers?” He asked, recalling what the boy had been wearing when he had been arrested.
John managed to smile, even if the older man couldn’t see him. “I don’t think he’s gone. His coat is still here and I know him well enough by now that there is no way he’d leave without it, especially in the middle of winter.”
Half an hour later, John was forcing Sherlock into a completely different suit to the one he was used, it looked like… tweed? Apparently he wanted him to be a ‘respectable young man’. Sherlock just pointed out that as soon as they got to Angelo’s, he'd be on his knees anyway, but that didn’t seem to bother the older man.
When all Sherlock did was grunt, John sighed and pushed the boy back. He pulled the ring from his mouth at the same time. “What is it?” He demanded.
“Well done, for talking, pet. I won’t ask you anything else right now.” John was amazed that just talking about it seemed to have Sherlock skitter around the edge of Panic rather than jumping head first into it.
John took a deep breath and let out a shaky laugh. He rarely showed his own emotions to his subs, he would hide them behind a mask, but if something could be said of John Watson, it was his observational skills as a Dom. He may not be able to make deductions like a Holmes, but he could still tell a lot from a single glance, whether that was because of his army experience, the fact that he was a doctor or the fact that he was a professional Dom, he didn’t know. What he did know was right now, hiding his emotions from the near-broken man in front of him would have been a very stupid thing to do. “You’re right, of course. I’m sorry, it’s just…”
He shoved his brother back into the bedroom and shut the door behind him, he should leave them alone for this bit.
When he turned back to his sub he found Sherlock still partly dressed. “It does not take that long to take your clothes off boy.” He could see he was nervous, he was quite right to be, that soap had to be dissolving by now, and tasting disgusting.
John barely slowed down as they reached his car. Sam was waiting by the rear door, which he opened as he saw them approach. He inclined his head toward his driver by way of thanks and shoved Sherlock inside with as much force as he dared.
Going over to their bags, John dug out a specially formulated lube. It was one that was designed for BDSM usage and it provided a nice burn when used with a dildo. He decided it would make a nice addition to the fucking his boy was going to get from the machine. He deserved it with his current attitude.
Mycroft did a good job of keeping his reactions to himself as well. Sherlock hissed when he reached 20 because Eurus pushed her foot down. "Eurus, please."
The government official froze, realising who he had just spoken to like that. He ducked his head immediately. "Sorry, sir. I spoke out of turn."
When John joined his pet, it was to find Sherlock sitting on the hard wood floor. "Hold this," he said, handing the sub a cup of hot chocolate with marshmallows. He grabbed a pillow. "Stand up," he said, then he tossed the pillow down. "Sit on that, Sherlock."
With that he rolled over, pushed himself to his feet, no longer feeling pain in his cock and he walked out of the room.
John shook his head. “I still don't think you get it. When you act this way… you take the person I love away from me. That's not fair.” This version of Sherlock was so far from normal it was scary. How long was he supposed to leave it this way? Mycroft had said time but how long? It seemed as much as he explained himself, he just wasn’t getting through.
“Those shoes!” The shoes that had been the nail in the coffin in terms of his getting released chances plummeting.
Sherlock jumped backwards, forgetting himself for a moment. “Yes, of course.” He held the door wide and moved out of the way for the older man to come through.
"I imagine you fed me when I was a little girl, just a baby. I'm going to return the favour, big brother. Open up for sister."
“Of course. I will always do it when you’ve been punished. No matter how good or bad you were during the punishment. Although I will point out, being bad when you are already being punished would be a very reckless thing to do.” John looked at him in a way that suggested he knew just how reckless the younger man could be.
Once it was fully seated inside Sherlock's hole, John patted his hand over it firmly, sending sparks through Sherlock like a firework, then he pulled him upright by his collar, a sharp tug to warn him not to disappoint.
John's hand had gone still in Sherlock's curls. The detective gave it a nudge and gave another purr when his Dom started stroking him again.
Mycroft pushed himself off the bed and dropped to the floor, his hands went behind his head without being ordered.
“Your backside is a mess,” Greg said, reaching out and rubbing Mycroft’s arm. “I’m a mess too. Let's get cleaned up and see what John and Sherlock are up to.”
Sherlock was biting his lip and fighting his hip movements. It was hard to stay on his knees through the intense feeling welling up in his groin.
"Leave them be," Greg ordered. He dragged his boy to the kitchen. "You can feed me for a change." Food was already on the table from where Mycroft had prepared it earlier.
Mycroft got down on his knees and tried to concentrate solely on his Dom. He used his long reach and stabbed at a piece of fruit and offered it to Greg.
When John plucked absently at one of the strings he saw a flash of hurt fly across Sherlock’s face. His shoulders rounded slightly and his head ducked immediately in defeat.
It took a moment for the order to sink in, but when it did, Greg moved his hands quickly, settling them behind his back.
"I don't know what you mean, mistress." It should be weird calling his little sister that, but everything that had gone on in Sherrinford was far beyond normal.
He grabbed a towel from the airing cupboard and gathered up a new suit before going through to the bathroom. He thought it was rather depressing that his cock wasn't even hard.
For the first time, John caught sight of the tearstained face. With one hand he cupped his cheek and he held the other out, just above Sherlock’s extremely still form. Tentatively the sub’s hand came up and met the doctor’s. John squeezed his grip reassuringly. “Punishment over, Sherlock, time for some cuddles.”
He growled when the posture collar kept him from getting a good view. All of a sudden, he felt the need to fight. Sherlock pulled against the cuffs fiercely, ignoring how his struggles made the clamps pull at his nipples. Even so, the fucking machine kept up its relentless pace.
Sherlock dropped like a puppet whose strings had been cut. He raised his hands and settled them behind his neck.
“I said I’d cooperate!” Sherlock yelled, adding on a belated sir when he got no response from the Dom, just a more strenuous position to walk in.
The doctor turned and gripped the boy by the neck, just below his collar. "I've had enough of the attitude, fail to address me correctly again and it will be an extra day in your current predicament."
“Well I know you’ve got one. You weren’t on the phone to Greg when I appeared at the door and you were distracted by something.”
Jumping back to his feet he walked back up the steps and froze just in front of the doors. Damn! He hadn’t thought this part of his plan through, he had planned every detail of the getting out, but the getting back in… that was going to be a problem. The only way of turning off the thing that would tie him to the floor was in John’s pocket and he was not getting caught in a compromising position, he had learned that lesson the first time round.
Sighing, the doctor took a deep breath. “From this point on, you have no name. I refuse to recognise it or use it.”
Also, I love reading you guys' comments so please keep them coming! I will try to get round to answering them all, promise
“We were going to tell you, but I see we don't need to,” John said as he came to a stop a couple feet from the DI.
one. He hadn’t taken his things away to destroy and he had already offered him the chance to earn it back. The only reason he didn’t have his violin for now was the fact that he had messed up and put his foot in it, like he always did.
John huffed out a sigh. "An order is an order, even if it's to do something pleasant." He grasped a handful of dark curls and pulled his boy's head into his lap. "If you can't obey me in this, too, we still have a problem."
Sherlock ducked his head, but realised the Dom spoke in good humour. His fear turned to a smile. I really didn’t mean to upset you, sir. I just had to prove to myself that Mycroft wouldn’t win.”
Finally, finally, Eurus called out, "Stop!" She pulled on Sherlock's arms. "How many, little big brother?"
"To haunt me," John muttered, moving to scrap the black bacon and snatch up the packet to pull out more.
Despite himself, the sub sucked in his breath and wriggled a bit before he forced himself to be still.
The Dom nodded and snatched up the bottle. “I’m about to let you down, pet,” he informed him as he gratefully sipped at the water. “Are you going to fight me?”
Sherlock grabbed Finn by the ankles, then he ran around the room making airplane noises before settling carefully to the floor.
It was quite a view. John’s land was so big he couldn’t see the end of it, he couldn’t see the end of the driveway and he didn’t really recall the journey up the path at all, Mycroft had been demanding his attention and cooperation so he had hidden in his Mind Palace while they were in the car.
Greg grabbed a handful of curls and shook Sherlock's head. "Of all the impertinent things I have ever seen, this beats everything."
John had expected his sub to be asleep as he wandered down the hallway. He’d been up just over an hour and was already immaculately dressed in his 3 piece suit. Yesterday was his brown suit. He always wore it when the new subs arrived or when they left. Today it was his grey suit; his favourite. Old army habits die hard; early mornings and dressing appropriately came naturally to the Dom whether he liked it or not. With Sherlock however, he doubted it somehow - he acted like a teenager and teenagers loved their beds.
Sherlock didn't even move when John pressed the plug into his loose hole. He was used to it by now, as irritating as it was.
“There is a lot of responsibility being a Dom. You cannot deny that. I can’t turn to someone if it’s been a rough day.”
John had never met a sub so intent on finding trouble, but he did concede he had never met a sub quite like Sherlock before. The boy never ceased to amaze him.
Mycroft hadn't moved beyond the doorway. He was staring at the floor, wishing he had some insight to offer the other two men. His brother had always been difficult, but this eluded even his understanding.
"I didn't think so," John snapped. He gripped his sub's head by the curls and tugged his head back so the dildo brushed against the back of his boy's throat.
The doctor had stepped around behind him to gather up a set of cuffs. When he turned back around and saw Sherlock so straight he was tense, he sighed. "Babe, relax." He knelt behind him, set the cuffs to the side, and started massaging his pet's shoulders.
By now, John had two fingers in Sherlock's hole, working him open as quickly and as thoroughly as he could.
"You know, Greg, I think you're right about our boy here." John let Mycroft's hair go. "He's a complete sub now." He laughed. "I never would have imagined this that day he kidnapped me and played Mr. Mysterious at the car park."
The sub huffed in annoyance. It wasn't his fault he hadn't stayed in the corner. It was John's. The Dom knew how impatient he was.
John’s smile grew wider as he saw Sherlock’s brain running through his options. He could almost hear the cogs whirring, trying to make a decision.
None of the other men saw it coming, but as soon as they reached the beach, Mycroft pulled out of Greg's grip, grabbed Sherlock's hand and ran off towards the sea.
John was still in the kitchen, waiting on the coffee machine again when both Mycroft and Greg joined him.
Greg bent down and picked up a shell. He brushed the sand off and looked at it. It was beautiful and he handed it to Mycroft. The government official made an appreciative noise and handed it to his brother.
"Count," John ordered and it made Sherlock realise he was now stood above him. He didn't respond, preparing to count.
John had allowed Sherlock to work on a cold case that early morning before breakfast, but had put him on the chair and left him there, his cock was still in its cage so he got no satisfaction from the stimulation. He was learning to ignore it, but not very well. Even the smallest of movements set his cock fighting for its freedom.
Sherlock hissed when he felt John's hands on his trussed up cock. "I'm going to remove the cage, when I do I do not expect you to be able to control yourself getting hard, what I do expect is you not to come without my permission. You are well aware what happens if you do."
“I decide when you have been punished enough, not you. I believe I have already told you that. Now this is how this is going to work. You will stay in that position until you physically cannot hold it anymore, but when that moment comes you will not lay down or try to make it easier for yourself. You will ask me very politely for permission to move. If I think you have lasted long enough, I will let you up here and we can snuggle. Is that understood?”
John groaned in response. "Oh yeah." He glanced briefly at the screen to check on Sherlock. The younger man had given up fighting now and instead chose to stare at the ceiling."
As soon as Mycroft had trailed after his Dom to head home and get ready for the evening, Sherlock could sense his own Dom’s distraction and took his opportunity.
The detective's head fell back against the cross with a loud thud. He closed his eyes and thought of what he would like to do to Irene, nothing of which she would enjoy.
It was the second time since getting dressed that Sherlock had to fight back tears. Just feeling the warmth of John's hand in his made his heart beat faster.
Sherlock glared in a different direction to his sister, he couldn't answer in any way, the posture collar made all head movement impossible and the gag did the same for his voice. He couldn't even stick his tongue out at her.
He had bent him over the back and begun forcing his hole open immediately. The first finger had taken one minute, two fingers had taken five and he hadn't even bothered with three fingers just forced him to hover over the usual dildo poking upright from the chair.
John stood back and folded his arms across his chest. He knew how much Sherlock despised enemas, they had only ever been used in punishment before as it wasn't something that turned John on.
“Ah, Sherlock good to see you again,” the man at the door said in greeting after he had spoken to John.
By 4 o’clock John had been remarkably impressed by his pet. Of course he had slipped up and his tally was well on the way passed 30, but he could see how hard the boy was trying.
They stay like that for a while. Rosie is asleep in Mrs. Hudson's right arm and her left is rested gently in Sherlock's curls. She gives no intention of moving and Sherlock doesn't try to pull away. Neither of them say a word, the only sounds are Rosie's occasional sleepy coo or the sharp beep of the heart monitor every thirty seconds or so.
As the morning drags on, the room is so quiet John can hear conversations from other rooms. He's surprisingly not tired for coming out of a coma. Wide awake in fact. John wishes Sherlock would wake up, but then again, John doesn't want Sherlock to wake up. Then they would have to talk. And John wants anything but that.
The hospital's loudspeakers crack on and Sherlock hears a familiar, clearly annoyed voice. His eyes flick up to the direction of the loudspeaker.
Sherlock flips through the folder, eyes skimming up and down the pages, analyzing evidence. "Foreign substances?"
Lestrade appears disappointed out of the corner of Sherlock's eye. Everyone is in Sherlock these days. "Yeah, sure. Let me just... Here. This one's a death in the middle of an art gallery," he hands a case file to Sherlock, "Teresa Smith, twenty-seven years old. Collapsed dead at three-thirty-seven last Tuesday. Had no previous health issues. Doctors have ruled it as a heart attack. Foreign substances were found in her blood stream, don't know how it got there though."
Sherlock starts to feel a little dizzy. Is it exhaustion? Maybe. Lack of food? Possibly. Nerves? Could be, but it's never the case. He sits down in his chair next to John's bed, gripping the arm rest. The doctors seem to get the message.
Sherlock's not drowsy either. He's wide awake, his brain on high alert. He needs to make plans for tomorrow. Rosie will most likely stay with Mrs. Hudson while Sherlock goes to the hospital. He'll talk to the doctors and discuss course of recovery. Maybe Lestrade will have a few cases Sherlock can take a look at.
John sighs in slight exasperation, "Look, Sherlock, it wasn't your fault, alright? Everything isn't always
"Sherlock!" Mycroft answers in a tone too loud for the quiet hallway, making Sherlock glance around for people who might be watching, "Stop shutting everyone out! I've let you get away with it for too long. You stopped talking to me a long time ago and that's fine. But not him, I won't let you do that. I thought John had made a difference. He
"Ah, Mr. Holmes, we're here to take Mr. Watson to CT. I checked and we should only be a half hour," Dr. Wallace stands straight as a pole, gripping his clipboard to his chest, his knuckles white.
"Oh, no Mr. Holmes. The CT scan gave us the confidence that he'll be able to breathe independently going forward. No need to worry," butts in Dr. Andrews before the poor nurse even had a chance to open her mouth.
"Shhh.... that's a good girl," Sherlock strokes Rosie's head until she falls asleep, "Goodnight, Little Watson."
Sherlock looks at the clock on the wall across from him. It's already been an hour and half of surgery. Sherlock needs something to distract himself; he focuses in on the other people in the waiting room.
Sherlock obliges and rounds the bed in a few large strides, sitting cautiously down in the chair besides John's bed.
The living room is full of toys. Sherlock doesn't sit, but rather creeps towards the coffee table. Under a pile of things is John's laptop. Sherlock removes the clutter surrounding it and picks it up. He'll take it with him, John might want it.
"Oh yes of course. One of the doctors will be with him at all times to make sure nothing causes the swelling to increase."
When Sherlock turns back down to look at John, he sees John's eyes are closed. His breath even shallower. Sherlock feels John's pulse; barely there.
"That's no way to go about this! Hope, it's all we really have in the end. Ugh, there goes me with the meaningful stuff. You kind of pick up stuff like that after a while with this kind of job. I should be off. Press the call button if you need anything."
Sherlock's eyes focus behind his reflection and skim the glittering skyline. Various colored dots scatter the horizon and central London. All that projects from the hospital is the cold, artificial lights from within.
John at one point. Before all this. Before Moriarty, before Magnussen, before Vivian Norbury, before everything. He had him once. Or maybe he never did. Maybe Sherlock has never had John. Just... flatmates.
Every single possible complication is running through Sherlock's brain at the speed of a race car. Every second there's a new tragic thought to wrack Sherlock's brain. He desperately wants to go and preform the surgery himself, but hospital policy only allows Sherlock to sit, worried and tired, in the waiting room.
His phone buzzes. It's another text from Molly. Sherlock switches his phone off and puts it back in his shirt pocket. He has no interest in rehashing this afternoon's events, let alone "share his feelings" as Molly would say, and probably wants him to do.
The female doctor begins again, sliding her pen down what seems to be a list. "His side effects could include immobility, confusion, delirium, reduced muscle tone and de-conditioning, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, headaches, and nightmares."
"Calm down, Sherlock! She's fine! Stella was at the house when I stopped by. I told her what had happened and she said she'd stay with Rosie."
“No, pet.” John's tone was soft yet stern, as he watched his boy acting submissively, more than normal.
“I-” he caught himself before he went any further. Don’t complain! John’s been great. Don’t complain and maybe it’ll continue. “Nothing, sir. Sorry, sir.”
“Billy. He contacted him again. Obviously thinking he would be dumb enough to ignore the threats from police about cooperation.”
“You don’t need to tell me, John. I would be more than willing to tell him off myself. I know what he is doing now, my Dom told me about the case this morning. But there is no need for the car, I know where he will be when he is done.”
Sherlock reached out and knocked on Greg's office door as he knew John would prefer that to him just barging in.
“Arrest them both!” Mycroft yelled running in behind the officers. He was wearing a stab vest as a precaution over his suit as he rushed straight over to Sherlock even before Moriarty had been properly disarmed.
“Because I control it. I always control it. I do it when I feel safe, almost as a reflex, and I’ve never done it in response to Service before.”
"Quite right. Because the pair of you deserve this. You've been in sub mode for months, but the last 3 weeks you've been in bratty sub mode. Bratty subs mean punishment."
"How is you handcuffing him and making him kneel any better than when I make him do it?" She asked of Mycroft.
The doctor watched a moment, until the DI had encouraged him out of the room, and then turned to Sherlock.
"Finn... I didn't mean it like that," Sherlock said gently. "All I meant was John wasn’t needed for cooking breakfast this morning. Of course you need him. I do too. I always do."
"I was attention seeking, you don't have to go. Please don't go," he dropped to his knees in front of the doctor.
“They all reported minor vandalism. The third made a massive deal out of it as it had happened while they were in.” Greg read the report aloud. “Concerned it was an attempt on their life.”
Chuckling softly, he tapped the plug that ran flush with his hole and cleaned his boy up before joining him on the bed.
“What happened?” he immediately noticed the comfort Sherlock had been getting from his Dom and realised that it was probably worse than the detective had made out on the phone.
Mycroft held his hand out, but his action was casual, he was enjoying himself far too much but didn’t want to go too far… this sod hadn’t been suitably punished. Yet.
It didn’t take him long to uncover the ‘window’ and he was right, it was an old fashioned angled window that swung back out of the way leaving him more than enough room.
He pushed him to his knees at the back of the study so he was facing the wall and about 6 inches from it.
“Victor used to cane him. Quite badly, it would affect him weeks later. He went to hospital twice about it before I found out.” John collapsed back into his chair in his study, unaware how close the person he searched for was. “He used to cane him on the night, wait for him to settle slightly and beginning to get pain free again and then he would cane him all over again, I don’t know the full extent concerning the length of time this was over, he hasn’t said and I doubt he will. And Wilkes used to keep him locked away. Usually in the bedroom in a cupboard.”
Groaning, Sherlock lifted his hands to sit on the back of his head. Well there was him changing John's mood and having to raise his hands in the first place.
“Yeah?” John's voice came from inside. “Sherlock?” He questioned when the detective just stood at the door. “You alright? I haven't heard your violin.”
John went straight to the Yard after Greg's phone call, demanding the cabby go twice as quickly, but also wishing he'd slow down.
Mycroft chuckled and renewed his efforts. He couldn't wait for his Dom to remove his fingers from his mouth and let him really get to work.
Sherlock didn't answer, instead staring out onto the street, he tipped his head on one side as if that would help his brain process what he was seeing. Up the road people were screaming and running into the traffic.
“Victim is in her late thirties. A sub but a professional person, going by her clothes; I’m guessing something in the media, going by the rather alarming shade of pink.” He paused to frown at it for a moment as if really noticing it for the first time. “She travelled from Cardiff today, intending to stay in London for one night. It’s obvious from the size of her suitcase.”
John sat on the bed on the play side of the room, facing the kneeling man. "Warned you earlier about your attitude. What did I say would happen if it didn't make a u turn?"
Mycroft closed his mouth, but continued looking at his mother coldly. It was a look that had made politicians and government representatives alike quail. Mrs. Holmes didn’t fare much better, looking away.
"My being here years ago." His attention was drawn to the door where the Doms appeared holding the pizza boxes.
“Mycie, I didn’t... I just thought... well all the trouble I’ve been in recently...” he thought that explained itself.
Greg sighed, stopping his petting of Mycroft's hair. "Would you like my boy to get the riding crop for you, John? He'll be more than happy to."
"Was it tough, seeing your brother in trouble that way?" John asked, trying to tempt some conversation out of the boy.
The boy’s breathing was getting heavier and he felt Panic on the edge. He couldn’t fall into it. That would be not good. That would be a bit more than a bit not good. He was concentrating so hard on not responding to the arse’s words that he didn’t see, hear, or even sense the other man get up and wander towards him. The first he knew of it was when there was a fist hitting the side of his head hard and he collapsed to the floor.
“Look who I found. Actually, I suppose he found me. Well?” Ben snapped, kicking Sherlock in the back of the leg with the toe of his boot. “Remember your god damn manners. You kneel in the presence of more important people. I've tried hard enough in the past to get you to do so.” Sherlock thought it best not to mention the fact that the sod had been holding him up. “But you're nothing but a robot, and even you are shit at that.”
He lay there, groaning and suckling to himself as he felt his orgasm build and deplete before he had a choice.
The Dominatrix removed his gag, pausing to run her fingers over his lips. "Your lips are one of the prettiest things about you."
It wasn't until their number was called out and Greg came back with the food that he did speak. "I'm sorry, sir."
Sherlock gaped at his brother. It was odd seeing Mycroft use force against anyone, and he was doing it for him.
“That’s the transcript of the interview between my men and the widow. The one there is with the daughter.” He indicated the next paper on the table. “And those are from the first couple. The second couple is in the bottom folder.”
“Greg, Mycroft,” John said. Nothing in his tone suggested they weren’t welcome. Greg had hold of Mycroft’s leash rather tightly and it appeared the older man was in trouble as he placed the tray on the edge of the bed. “Are you alright, little brother?”
It was fairly easy to run when all the cars had stopped. He did wonder why they didn't all just drive through the random shiny things and instead chose to stop their journey.
“Billy rang, said there was an emergency with... oh,” John ran his hand through his hair in realisation before dropping his palm down heavily on the desk. “Sorry Rita, got to run.” And he was back out the door again.
They sat like that for as long as they dared, the time for meeting with Greg and Mycroft drawing near.
John bit the same nipple again, then sat up, straddling Sherlock's thighs. "Come on, let's go clean our teeth, then we can get a shower together."
"That sounds like something that would happen to me," John said, squeezing his boy's hand. "Those birds are a menace."
With each smack, Sherlock let out a low moan. He didn't seem to know he was doing it. His face screwed up tight for the first few blows, then it went slack and his eyes fell shut.
Sherlock must have heard his footsteps, because he tensed where he was in a heap. Slowly, but with controlled movements, he shifted around and pushed himself back onto aching knees; that’s what he had to do when the Dom entered the room, so that was what he did. His head touched the floor in front of the Dom’s feet briefly and then he brought it up so he could stare at the floor, his hands raised. After a second or so of trying to work the stiffness out, he he placed them behind his neck with a small sniff, not daring to speak.
Greg flicked the switch and the dildo started pounding into Sherlock's hole again, much to his dismay.
“I'm going to give you her name in a moment. If you know her or have had any contact you must tell me at once. I will not have what happened last time repeat itself.”
Sherlock let himself be dragged along. He hadn't intended to upset John. He just seemed to be so good at it.
Greg seemed to catch on to exactly what Mycroft had been laughing at. "Is that something you want me to do to you?"
“No, boy. You do not speak. I’m going to go over the rules for the next several days and you shall abide by them or so help me I’ll do that to you every half an hour.”
Finn held his finger to his lips and pulled his hand out from his trousers. In it was a pack of chocolate chips from the cupboard that he had hidden from the doctor.
It was only a few minutes more before Elsie appeared with a tray and the drinks and cake. “Is there anything else I can get for you, sir?”
He left Sherlock's hands where they were, unbuttoned his jacket and then his shirt. He pushed both layers back so they bunched around the cuffs. Before he removed them he spoke low and slowly.
John was glad that he could be the one to bring that about; glad his pet trusted him enough now, but he definitely noticed the conflicting thoughts on Sherlock's face. He only ignored them because of the insistent knocking.
"Because you're bored enough as it is, the last thing I need right now is a hyper bored consulting detective."
Sherlock watched his brother uneasily as Mycroft scrolled through all the navigation nonsense just to watch the show. He was pleased when Mycroft settled on the bed beside him, though he had a different blanket.
But then it hit him square in the face about how rude and abrupt his brat had just been and as far as he was aware it wasn’t very provoked either. He’d wanted to talk to him, but it wasn’t the first time, it wouldn’t be the last and yet Sherlock had reacted like the whole world was about to end. The younger man needed to understand the importance of speaking to each other, not just for trust purposes but to keep him safe from the things of his past. “Sherlock!” he yelled.
He couldn't help but grin as the blue box appeared. It fascinated him how it just faded in and out before clearly being there. He wanted to see inside it. He needed to.
As if thinking deeply, Sherlock walked slowly back towards the table, he snatched up the bottle that was closest to the man that was sat down.
The doctor waited for him to make some headway and then cleared his throat pointedly. “And where do you think you’ve been?” he asked, his tone brooked no argument.
“One, sir,” he puffed quickly, before John could think he was being a brat and not letting that one count.
John cut him off holding his finger to his pet's lips. "Irene... I severed all ties with her the last time she was here. I didn't appreciate her response to you in Panic and decided I didn't want nor need her company or business any longer. A Dom that ignores or punishes something that's beyond a subs control isn't someone I want to be associated with. I'd have reacted in the same way with any sub, not just you."
John let that sink in for a bit. "You're right, Mycroft, thank you." He stood up and headed back to the house.
The standing man reached over and pulled him back to his knees by his curls before going again, this time harder, so he collapsed. Blood gushed from his nose and Panic set in.
"I'll punish you for stopping, John. Whether you can physically go anymore or not. You never asked for your master's permission."
Reluctantly Sherlock knelt. It made sense to have half of his punishment now, but it didn’t mean he had to like it. Or the fact he felt stupidly grateful to the Dom for giving him a second chance. He felt guilty for the way he had spoken to him when they were outside of the room earlier. He couldn’t help but want to be mad, and yet the Dom’s calm presence seemed to… do something he didn’t understand and he didn’t know whether he should like it or not.
John got no response, however. Rather than jumping to the wrong conclusions and deciding Sherlock was ignoring him – after his attitude so far since he’d been caught, he knew that would be a bad interpretation of his actions to come to - he realised that his sub might not know the answer and his pride was too large for him to admit it. Rather than punish him further, he would help him. Sherlock needed to know that Doms weren’t against him or subs in general, he had just come across a bad bunch. He needed to gain the detective’s trust and the only way that was going to happen would be through communication and punishing him when it was justified, not when he felt like it or when Sherlock was upset about something. The sub needed to know if he was upset or angry that he could talk to John about it, not the alternative, which would be shouting and yelling until he had caused enough offence to be punished.
Blindfolded, Sherlock couldn't see what the Dom was about to tie him down with, but he knew being restrained was on the list of activities for the day.
The moment it was slipped between Sherlock's lips, he began drinking greedily. The water tasted so good and he couldn't get enough.
John smiled grimly, but kept dragging his sub towards the jungle room. He kicked open the door and dragged Sherlock inside.
She nodded, but looked just as worried. "You always come back hurt. I don't like it. Don't get hurt this time."
Siger took half a step forward then stopped himself. He wasn't the parent here, Sherlock and John were. He had to let them handle it.
The detective's tongue darted out to lick his lips as he nodded eagerly. He'd get to touch John for sure in the shower. He always did. Taking his Dom's hand he let him help him to his feet.
Sherlock was so focused on Mycroft he didn't even notice Finn, so the little boy moved his counter an extra space which was conveniently at the bottom of a ladder.
John looked over at Greg. "I wasn't planning on leaving the house today, but I'm tempted now. Should we go see the sights, Greg?"
His anger wasn’t dwindling at the thought of John’s it was making him worse. He yelped as John grabbed his arm and twisted it up his back, forcing him to double over. He then grunted as the doctor used his position to his advantage and forced him back through the door. Sherlock grunted, but not just through pain, through irritance too.
But now, Sherlock had been in his lab finishing off his experiment while John worked away in his study.
“It’s a crime scene,” he pointed out for no apparent reason. “I don’t want it contaminated, are we clear on that?”
“Well, it would have probably been in the boot or maybe the back seat. The driver could only take it by mistake.”
Mycroft lost his composure when Irene moved around to his front and struck his cock viciously. He brought his knees up reflexively to protect himself and the Dominatrix started flailing at him wildly.
The sub was more than glad when John told him his time was up and he could turn around. “You can lower your arms now,” the Dom said as he had kept his hands behind his head. The doctor hadn’t moved from his chair, but he had turned it around. He patted his thigh. “Come on over here then.”
The Dom was in no hurry to untie him, but when he had, he dropped his hand on his head and ruffled his hair slightly. “10 minutes, pet.”
“You’re the cabbie. The one who stopped outside Northumberland Street. The one me and- the one I chased.”
John stepped into the room, each step dangerous and threatening. Even a moron would have run but these two didn’t even seem to possess a moron’s intelligence, that thought made Sherlock smile to himself, it was easier to make jokes when your tormentor had a gun pointed at him.
Sherlock was relaxing slightly beside him. He began to settle into the fabric of the furniture rather than avoid it as much as possible.
John realised right then that anything related to sex right at that moment was unwarranted. The only thing that had gotten a reaction out of this motionless Sherlock was this. It was rather sweet. He didn't want to risk disturbing his sub, even by lifting him onto his lap.
“You have the contract on your side here, John. Apart from running away and having a slight attitude how has he been?”
“Inside,” John ordered sharply when Sherlock refused to cooperate. He may have crawled yesterday, but he was in the after effects of Panic. It didn’t really count. No way was he going to just crawl at this Dom’s whim. “And if you even think of standing up, this punishment will be like nothing you have ever experienced before.” Okay, so maybe he had underestimated how mad he was.
With a groan, Greg fell from John's lap when his arms were released and he sighed in relief, even as his knees hit the floor harder than he had intended.
Sherlock had slumped back on his knees, rather than kneeling upright like Mycroft. It meant the collar was pulled tight.
Before he could do anything, or say anything, the sound of tires screeching was all he could hear, then it disappeared completely. Was he in some sort of warehouse?
Finn pressed it and watched his glass fill. He giggled when the green liquid got to the top and pulled his finger back.
John didn't get angry. On the contrary, he started laughing. "Eager boy." He reached down and pulled Greg back to his knees by the scruff of his neck and let him get rid of his trousers.
John nodded once and pulled a chopping board out from a cupboard. “You chop up the vegetables,” he placed a few Tupperware pots with different sized compartments beside him. “I’ll make the sandwiches.”
Sherlock pushed himself to his knees from where he had been laying. The Dom may have given him a few hours to himself, but that didn’t mean he could ignore him when he entered. He had learnt that the hard way on day four. John seemed extremely pleased as his hands settled behind his back.
The detective stared down the beach at the boy and saw Mycroft struggling to keep up with him. “I think he’s definitely going to be too tired.”
"Sherlock. Sherlock? Pet? Hey," John dropped his hand into Sherlock's curls and the detective looked up at him in surprise.
By the time they made it down the stairs - John had carried him down - the hall was empty and both Mycroft and Greg were in the sitting room.
She frowned and glanced down at Sherlock who was pointedly looking away from his sister. She let him go and threw him at the floor.
“Don’t know, sir. Maybe 3 minutes?” John nodded, right. So on one side, Greg had been praising the younger man, on the other he had been seen to ignore him for that long, something though made John feel like it wasn’t the first time. He knew he’d punished him harshly a few days ago, but he had explained how that was comparatively harsh to his previous response to such a flagrant disrespect for the rules. This was something different, but here wasn’t the right place to put his finger on it. He pushed his hand into his sub’s curls.
Realising he’d messed up again, he ducked his head to his chest. “I’m sorry, sir. I just meant, I’m used to having everybody else push me around when it comes to relationships.” The boy froze, realising he’d already said too much.
Even as he was being wrestled into the cuffs, Sherlock called out, "I wouldn't. Some day she'll do that to someone and won't ask to be stopped. It won't be me or Mycroft she does it to."
"Mycroft!" Sherlock growled before pausing and averting his eyes towards his own Dom. "Sir, you never said-"
He tried to listen to the voice at the back of his head telling him how ridiculous that whole concept was, least of all because Mycroft trusted him and there was no way he would send his little brother into any danger. It didn’t matter whether it was physical or emotional.
“But, I want to!” Finn got to his feet and tried to race passed the doctor, but John was having none of it he grabbed the little boy around the waist and dumped him back on the bed.
“I will pull the plug on this contract, despite what I said the first day about ending it in 3 months, if that is what you really want. One word, boy, that’s it.”
He ran to the end of the street and looked towards where the traffic was coming from. He spotted the blue flashing lights and made his way there at speed. Police cars were dotted around the street, abandoned up on the curbs, their lights flashing and spinning on top.
While he tried to regain his composure without John noticing, his mind kept drifting back to Mycroft, still knelt in Greg's office. Why was his brother still in trouble? And why did Greg care so much that his sub had upset his brother? None of it made sense.
John kicked his boy's feet wide apart so Greg could tie them that way. "I think that pink hole of yours needs to be filled up, boy. Luckily, this room has just what we need to do it."
"I don't know what you want from me, Sherlock. The tantrums I can cope with but I don't know why you feel the need to carry on like this."
John disappeared into the room they had spent so much time in the day before. He returned shortly with the machine.
When the doctor followed the other man through to the kitchen 10 minutes later because of the smell of burning bacon, he found Sherlock walking round a silver figure in the kitchen.
The detective sighed, his head hanging low as he did. “Yes, sir.” He flinched as the cold was pressed up against the base of his cock and his bollocks began to shrivel up. He could actually feel them getting smaller.
As the detective walked away, the other three men found a place to sit and finished their ice creams.
John closed his eyes and fell back against the wall. “Is this deliberate? Is someone deliberately setting my sub up?”
"Bloody hell." The doctor looked at his boy with sudden understanding. "We've just been giving him what he wants."
“It’s preprogrammed, boy,” the doctor pointed out with a smirk. “I do hope you enjoy it.” He reached down and tipped Sherlock's head back so he could stare into his grey-green eyes. “You remember what happened the last time you came without permission, don't you?” He reached down and gripped his hardening cock in his fist.
“Stay, sir.” He said it. It didn’t mean it was necessarily going to happen. From the look on the blond’s face, the man didn’t believe it either, but he didn’t comment.
"You can't honestly believe I would let you pleasure yourself? Even through the cage." John had paused where he was and was watching him closely.
Sherlock groaned as his arms were removed from the cuffs and he was dragged to his feet. His arms strained as they were pulled up and the cuffs attached to the hook hanging from the ceiling.
“Walking is good for the soul,” Mycroft replied, keeping his eye level. John picked up what he meant immediately.
Sherlock hears the sirens. He lets out a glorious happy sob. He looks up to the above, something he never does, something he doesn't  believe in doing.
"Alright, that's everything! Dr. Wallace and Dr. Andrews should be in later to check up. You just rest now. No need to over-do it when you're just getting better."
There is a sigh on the other end of the phone. Mycroft begins again, "I have information regarding the present circumstances."
"— Mr. Watson should have the normal initial side effects. Whether or not those continue as time passes, or if he develops new ones, is completely dependent on how his body responds to the trauma, and if he follows his post-surgery and hospital release regimen."
Mycroft's end of the line is quiet. Sherlock's counted to a measly thirty seconds before Mycroft speaks again.
Mycroft clicks his tongue and raises his umbrella outwards to examine it."That's alright. Lucky for us, most of that neighborhood uses CCTV, so we've got it all right here," he says as he procures a small thumb drive from his inside jacket pocket, "Sherlock, you're laptop please?"
Sherlock's eyes flit up to John. He looks so peaceful, his face so placid. Sherlock knows every line of John's face, every hollow and every turn. Expressionless now, but a cabaret of emotions anywhere else. This isn't fair.
"You're not wrong. But really, I'm okay now. You can stop worrying. I'll be up and at 'em before you know it."
But the laughing doesn't last and silence soon reigns again. Both men are desperate to fill it, but neither can think of anything to say.
As Sherlock puts his phone away he sees a group of surgeons walk up to him. Sherlock stands at their arrival, "How is he?"
Something hits the floor. Something small has fallen from between the closed laptop. The glint from the light on it catches Sherlock's eye. He knows what it is before he's even bending down to get it. Mary's wedding ring. So new, almost no scratches. Clearly always being held by a intoxicated John, judging by the residual alcohol stains and finger oils on the band.
“From your phone messages, it automatically deletes them after 3 years, but there is no record in them or your phone transactions that you have had any contact with him in all that time. If it’s been 3 years it is statistically more likely that it has been 6.”
He wasn’t surprised when a plug slipped into his hole with ease. The presence of it already seemed to calm him.
The following morning was odd. John had laid in bed, listening to Sherlock shift constantly whilst trying to decide how he was going to handle the situation. The punishment would be prolonged so there was no comfort in between, he would drag it out, force Sherlock to feel sorry for himself and become apologetic. The problem was Sherlock just didn’t seem to care. It wasn’t him being naughty, it was him being annoyed, but whatever it was, it would not make a difference. The boy hadn’t safe worded, he’d bloody well take what John dealt out and this would all be over when the brat felt truly sorry.
Sherlock joined John by the window. "Let him sit there all night if he wants to. I don't have any plans to leave the flat."
His pet was still feeling guilty then, John realised, well if he felt comfortable kneeling - even if he didn’t have to - John couldn’t force him into the chair. The blond fixed together something light and fairly quick, but made sure there was a lot of it and placed it on the table. When he turned around Sherlock was knelt upright, trembling hands behind his neck in his proper position. That had to be hurting. John took hold of his sub’s hands and moved them down behind him, he gripped one tightly with the other.
The doctor opened a nearby hatch in the floor and used the leash to attach his sub’s collar to the hook revealed beneath the carpet, similar to the one by the bed.
Mycroft couldn’t believe this was his little brother, the little brother he had had to physically force to live with him months ago and only then did he get cooperation after promising to keep paying Mrs. Hudson for the flat. He was surprised, the younger sub wasn’t even embarrassed about being submissive; not like he used to be. He had spoken to Gregory and asked him for help when it came to the youngest Holmes, but the Dom struggled to offer any assistance which was beneficial. Sherlock would listen to what he said and obey to a limit as soon as he could work out which orders were just being relayed through the Dom but originated from his brother he just completely ignored them.
Sherlock nodded and then eased himself up slightly on his arms. Up and down. Up and down. He felt like a yoyo, but it felt good. No,
He took the sub by an ear and dragged him up the stairs. Sherlock, aware how much trouble he was now in, surrendered to the Dom. John opened another door on the same landing as Sherlock’s bedroom. As the door slid through into the wall, a staircase was revealed behind it. He continued to drag the younger man up and threw him to his knees as he they reached the top. Without letting go of Sherlock’s ear, John reached over and began fiddling with the door controls. The door wasn’t like a normal door, it appeared old at first glance, but Sherlock realised it had been made to look old, old like a dungeon door, all stone and rock.
Sherlock hesitantly tugged the zip around even as John kept a hold of his ear, like he was going to bolt again. As soon as he had got the zip all the way around, all the caution about getting into further trouble went out of the window as he pulled free and began rooting through the case.
Several hours later they were out on the beach. The two Holmeses walked beside each other so the Doms could talk.
He didn't know how long he knelt there, all he knew was when John noticed him he jerked in surprise.
“I never said that. I’m going to be hard on him, I fear that’s where I’ve been going wrong in recent weeks, I’m not tough enough on him.”
The kneeling man jerked when the plug up his arse suddenly decided to vibrate, pressing right up against his sweet spot for a few seconds before backing off and then reattacking it.
John couldn't seem to calm him down. Not until, Sherlock pushed him away and got to his feet. Then he ran across the room and cannoned into his brother holding him instead.
“I won’t cheat,” he continued as if ignoring the detective's thinking time. “It’s your choice. I’ll take whatever pill you don’t.”
He made sure his hand was in Sherlock's curls, reminding him of his presence for a moment as he turned to his guests. “Excuse us, make yourselves comfortable in the sitting room if you wish.” He bent down to pick Sherlock up.
"That's what our disagreement was over. More recently, he listens to me. But he won't be budged on this."
John looked up and nodded once, turning his attention back to the younger Holmes. He walked around and sucked on the lobe of Sherlock's ear, then bit it lightly. His own cock was aching again and he was going to have to have some relief soon. Sherlock wouldn't. He reached up and removed the gag. "Anything to say, boy? Before I pass sentence?"
“Oh, yes, according to Donovan he just took off. I had been hoping it was only for a few minutes but I am clearly mistaken. I’ll phone your sub if you don’t mind?”
Greg stepped forward and grabbed his boy by his thinning hair, pulling his head back. "Are you ready to switch? Is that what this is about?"
Before Sherlock could protest again, Mycroft hissed as his arms were twisted up his back painfully as the cuffs dug into his wrists.
John had attached the overhead hook to the rope harness and he went to the winch, lifting Mycroft into the air.
Greg sighed. It was a very difficult situation and he knew where Sherlock was coming from. “You can read people. You read them as well as Mycroft does. You need to know when you’re pushing John too far.”
Greg sighed and settled on the floor beside the trussed up sub. “Leave,” he ordered Donovan, the only remaining officer.
“Hmm. Never done it in February,” John laughed. “But you haven’t been out of the house for a few days and I know you hate feeling caged in.”
"Hurt him and-" she clipped the government official on the back of the head, successfully cutting him off.
John looked over at Greg, surprised. "Really? I never figured you to be one for power plays, well, outside our relationships."
Sherlock blinked at her dumbly as she came round then he just ducked his head again, ignoring the two women.
Douglas followed them over, also laughing. “Tame Sherlock Holmes? Who would be thick enough to even try that?”
The little boy threw his arms around Sherlock’s neck and held on tight. "But it will be ficial. No one can say I'm not yours."
John watched Sherlock then dry washed his face. It was like talking to a compliant polite wall. He wouldn't get anything out of the younger man until they were at home.
"Pizza sound good, little brother?" Mycroft prompted, clearly deducing what he'd decided but was just too... Quiet to vocalise. The younger Holmes just nodded.
“How can he cheat at Snakes and Ladders?” Greg asked, carrying in a tray of coffees and a milkshake for Finn.
The Dom nodded slowly. “You may, you have some left over body parts in the fridge, you may experiment as much as you like, but only with the equipment not in that cupboard. You haven't earned anything else yet.”
"Good boy," John whispered a while later, running his hand through his curls once again. "No complaints and all your food gone."
With a deep and meaningful huff, he dropped onto the top step and wrapped his hands around his knees.
The doctor noticed when his pet's eyelids fell to half mast. "I think we'd best get out while you can still move, pet." He kissed Sherlock on the temple, then urged him to sit up. He glanced at Sherlock's beer and realised he'd barely touched it.
John laughed as he continued trussing Mycroft with the orange rope. "Boy, it looks like you're in a no win scenario." He pulled a knot tight, causing the sub to grunt.
The doctor shook his head and held him close once again. “You have nothing to be sorry for.” He pressed a kiss to his temple, and let his curls brush the underside of his chin.
“Before you go any further,” the Dom started, well aware his sub hadn’t been planning on doing so. “Being submissive isn’t a weakness. At times, I believe being submissive needs a stronger character than being a Dom.” That wasn’t a lie, John genuinely meant it.
The rest of Greg's speech went straight over the detective’s head as he was pulled to his feet, first one wrist was cuffed, then his second joined it behind his back. His phone buzzed in his pocket, a phone call he couldn't answer.
“Could you bloody hurry up and interview him?” John hissed after a while, having completely blocked out the last several minutes.
“I know,” he grabbed Sherlock's hand as it whacked the chair in front of him, trying to calm him. “We need to go so Gregory can formally drop the charges against you.”
"It is a big decision," John agreed. He rubbed the little boy's shoulder to wake him up. For some reason, the thought of leaving the little girl any longer than necessary was getting to him.
John glanced over at him and smiled, but it didn't meet his eyes. Sherlock merely shrugged in response, what could they do but go with the flow?
“That's not how it's done, Uncle Myc,” he reached forward and tapped his own counter. “That's how it is done.”
Satisfied that John had things well in hand for now, Greg settled back in the hot tub, truly relaxing, with his sub nestled up against him.
The detective squeezed his eyes shut and tried to wriggle away from the pinwheel. John just grabbed one of the ropes and held him in place whilst he worked.
Sherlock didn't bother to say that he was quite capable of going alone. It hadn't worked when he'd tried it before, he knew with even more certainty that it wouldn't work now.
Sherlock knelt without complaint, his hands going back to his neck after he had straightened up, he had been expecting the order
Sherlock was silent until the Dom pushed the straw between his lips. “Not too fast.” He sipped slowly, trying to ignore the ever present buzzing up his arse. He hadn’t realised how thirsty he had been.
Sherlock reached forward, wincing slightly as the trousers shifted against his arse, and snatched up one of the sheets of paper. Mycroft didn’t try to stop him.
It took him nearly 20 minutes when he opened the door to the lab and couldn't spot him, there was about 1000 places he could be. He hadn’t spotted the sub’s hiding place straight away because Sherlock had clearly thought it through, he’d put everything that had originally been in said cupboard in other ones to not arouse suspicion by making a mess.
John cleared his throat, but Sherlock ignored the interruption, “-having to remake it,” Sherlock finished. He wandered over to his bed and flopped down, sighing loudly.
"You know, there's something about chips from a newspaper," Greg said as he forced a handful into Mycroft's mouth.
Settling on the floor, Eurus poured herself another glass of wine and sipped it. "Make Mycie lose his composure."
Since he’d found working with his brother’s boyfriend in the metropolitan police at New Scotland Yard a sometimes worthy distraction from the ever-present boredom, it had been noticed by said brother’s boyfriend whenever chaos appeared from nowhere, he was always at the centre. That was why he was sat where he was now, the extensive lounge of a well-known professional Dom, no doubt a boring professional Dom, Sherlock was sure.
"Fold them." The Dom jerked his head at the clothes that the detective had just dropped in an unsatisfactory heap. "You know this. 12."
The government official rolled his eyes. John just chuckled and brought them both their coffee before going back for his own.
Screw being ready, Sherlock was enjoying himself and for the first time in what felt like forever he was beginning to relax.
It was a further three days before John kept his promise to deal with the tally. It wasn't as high as the Dom had been expecting.
“Boy, we cannot continue if I cannot trust you to not hurt yourself.” He uncuffed him and immediately ordered his sub's hands behind his head. It would be uncomfortable. That was the point. Once he had done it, he would be calm and ready to submit again. He could see the strain that the collar had on the boy being so close to the floor, but once again, that was precisely the point.
Greg spotted it but just snorted, choosing not to mention it. “Daddy! Your go,” he had to say something, or Finn would give himself away.
“Pet, you are dropping. Now listen to me, okay?” He waited for his pet’s nod of acceptance before continuing. “It was putting my shoes on that did it,” John explained. “Service, that’s all. Nothing bad. You need to do exactly what I say and you won’t go into ‘drop.”
This was how it went, Sherlock opened his mouth, chewed and swallowed until he had eaten more than half of the whole pizza then John moved onto some fruit. Once more, the detective didn’t comment as the Dom popped in a strawberry, one of his favourite fruits.
John was starting to feel incredibly stupid for trusting him, he should have known that the temptation to the detective who found cases such a vital distraction was too large to resist. Trusting him at home and trusting him here in the place where he feels the most comfortable were two completely different things. If he had wanted to just take off and do whatever he pleased he should not have signed that contract last month. But he had and that would have to be dealt with, John sighed, it felt like so long since he had had to punish the younger man. Even if he had come out to the crime scene without his Dom, he would have been supervised by Greg because of his specific tendency to find trouble. Mycroft had made it perfectly clear when they had signed the contract. It had been John’s decision to follow him on a case, it was his job after all and he hadn’t wanted to interfere where he didn’t need to. He should have known that the main place that he would need to; it was the main place he acted up. That was more than clear now and seeing how he had acted between realising it was murder and now he was wrong to ever give him the choice to go out on cases alone. He had also made it quite clear that as he was with him that he should not just take off when he felt like it. He had no back up for a start and this part of London wasn’t known for its friendly conversations.
John snorted at his sub’s honesty. “It wasn’t a test. I had to take an important phone call that dragged on longer than I was expecting. But you were very good,” he added, feeling the need to keep the boy at ease.
“W-What are you doing, sir?” Sherlock squeaked. He had flinched as the Dom slowly worked down his pants and applied cold gel to heated flesh. The hot and cold clashed together, but it felt good.
John knew he was stronger than the taller man. Years in the army and controlling wayward subs had gained him a lot of valuable strength. He’d also learned a lot of techniques, many that he had made up himself, which would almost definitely come in handy.
John sighed, but took his hand, leading him to the bathroom. When he eventually got him into the shower, John started washing his boy, taking his time and enjoying having his hands on him. "You have no idea how much I like this, do you, pet?"
“So, what happened to that cop?” John asked as he poured tea from the tray already on the table. Sherlock had prepared it 10 minutes ago. The cop situation had been a long time ago - or at least it felt like it and a lot had happened since.
“Yes, sir,” he murmured. John’s hand was still on his cheek and he pressed his face into it a bit more.
"Nothing regarding you or John is a waste of brain space." That had sounded a bit too sentimental when said out loud, so Sherlock sought to change the subject. "Hungry?"
Greg wanted nothing more at that point than to reach over the table, grab Mycroft's collar and pull him over his lap to spank his arse. The look on Mycroft's face said he knew that too.
“See? No-one ever thinks about the cabbie. It’s like you’re invisible. Just the back of a head. Proper advantage for a serial killer.”
Both Mycroft and Siger could see Sherlock on a screen in the witness room. They were both rather proud until the inevitable outburst.
"Oh, dear." Mrs. Hudson took Finn's hand and tugged him towards the kitchen. "Sit down, John. Finn and I will finish cooking." She gave the little boy a wink and he climbed back on the stool.
John reached off the edge of the sofa, but Greg whacked his arm and shook his head. So instead the younger Dom returned his attention to the TV. It was more difficult than he had thought it would be to go back to the beginning with Sherlock. He missed the intimate touches and gentle moments as well as the play so very much.
"Fine, but two things. One, you wash your hands first and two, when we get back, I'm tying you up and riding you until you're begging me to come, but you don't get to unless I say so."
Sherlock was distracted by the seagulls hovering over the shoreline. "There must be whitebait down there," he said clapping his hands.
Greg bit his lip, he could quite easily tell the Dom to give him control back, then go and fuck Mycroft in thin air, but he didn't.
Sergeant Donovan stepped forward, a set of handcuffs in her hand but Greg pushed her back with just a glare. He had to do it, if he did it, he could unarrest the younger man when this was sorted. Soon, he hoped.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "I. Am. Still. Here," he said as slowly as possible, looking between his brother and John.
"I'm meant to be, Gregory. I thought that, along with the cuddles, we might try something a bit... sweeter than our usual." Mycroft licked his spoon again, very deliberately.
The Superintendent glanced at John and this time it was the deep stern tone of the army captain yelling.
Once at the university, he quickly found the labs. It didn't take him long to find the one with the best equipment. He searched through the many devices until he found what he was looking for.
"Yes, sir," he agreed reluctantly. He didn't seem okay. In fact, Mycroft was as down in the dumps as he could ever remember seeing him.
Both Greg and Mycroft nodded at that. Sherlock had been so convinced that he had to go life alone for so long, it seemed he didn't realise how many people truly cared about him. John was right, he needed to understand that for his own good.
With a smirk, John shifted as close to him as he could get. His boy was leaving everything in his hands, just as he had suspected. "Then we'll stay here until I feel every one of your knotted muscles relax."
After John had placed his boy on the bed, he used the towel to dry Sherlock off. He took his time and didn't miss a single inch of pale flesh.
"It's every reason, pet. You know as well as I do that you get yourself into trouble when you're bored. I'm not letting that happen."
“Your cuffs are set to the lock at that door,” he pointed to the only way in. “It will go off if you attempt to leave.”
"That will do." Irene flicked the parachute again. Next she fetched some weights and returned to Sherlock. She added them to the parachute one by one, watching as his face screwed up in further discomfort. "Thank me."
When he felt a foot push down on the cuffs between his wrists, he bit back his whimper. He would not grumble and moan in pain, not here.
Without much enthusiasm for the task, the Dominatrix circled Mycroft. Her only enjoyment came from the prospect of inflicting pain as revenge for leaving her at Sherrinford with Eurus.
Sherlock groaned as he typed out the DI’s number. Bloody tally. Bloody spanking. Bloody painful arse-
Sherlock smirked, but it was Siger who spoke. “I guarantee your dad and Uncle Mycroft will make pebble piles and compete to get them the highest.”
John noticed he was still holding the small black wallet he had waved at the cab. He took the warrant card out of his sub’s hand, still breathing heavily. He flipped it open. “This is Greg’s.”
Sherlock hangs up before Mrs. Hudson can find another way to decline his request. She needs to see John, and Sherlock's not leaving until John wakes up. Sherlock owes it to him; it's the least he can do.
make a difference, Sherlock. And now you're shutting him out, of all people. Don't, Sherlock, let him in. Let John in."
"Sherlock Holmes, do stop ignoring your phone and answer my call please." And the loudspeaker crackles off.
Sherlock's eyes meet John's in surprise and John gives him a little smile. As he processes the words, Sherlock gives John a small nod in return, still holding his eyes to his.
Remembering his deal with Mycroft, Sherlock calls Molly; bracing himself for the onslaught of questions. The other end of the line clicks on after one ring.
It's mid-afternoon now. The doctor visited while Mycroft was still explaining. He did the best he could with what he believes happened. Sherlock barraged him with questions, demanding explanations. John had his own questions too but mostly spent the time just listening, watching everything unfold in front of him. It was like a whole other conversation was going on between Sherlock and Mycroft beneath the surface, in a language he couldn't quite read or understand. By then end of it Sherlock especially keen to see Mycroft go.
"What? Oh, yes. I'm just to make sure Mr. Watson gets in and out of CT as fast as possible. I had to bump a few patients. But! Now worries, everything's fine, everything's fine..." He follows the nurses out as they wheel John's bed out the door.
Sherlock is pulled from his thoughts by a spontaneous ambulance that blows right along Baker Street. The blast wakes Rosie and her wails call out to Sherlock. He pulls back his covers and throws on a dressing gown. Sherlock pads quickly down the hallway, like a moving apparition. In one full motion, Sherlock bends down, scoops up Rosie, and tucks her into his arms.
The leather squishes as Sherlock stands. Little mumbles come from Rosie as he lays her down, she really is a noisy sleeper.
He freezes. Sherlock knows John figured it out and came to the hospital, but he hadn't thought about this. The knife isn't stabbed into the mantle; it's laying on its side. Sherlock whisks over, the DVD isn't there; John watched it then. How could he miss this? Of course! How could he have possibly missed it! What's wrong with him? The TV isn't exactly as he left it. And there, tucked away behind it, is the envelope. The envelope that contains the video that broke Sherlock to watch, and most likely destroyed John.
Once the door has been shut behind them, Sherlock pulls out his phone and sends a text to Mycroft, reading, 'What the hell, Mycroft? Working your own agenda as always? Even now?'
"No, it's fine, er... I remember she pulled the trigger and everything slowed down. I was on the floor but I don't remember actually hitting it. I heard things that may or may not have been real; I heard alarm bells, and something like, maybe ocean waves. I... remember another big noise, like another gun shot... and then you were there. I tried to speak but I just couldn't. I was trying to tell you 'Vatican Cameos,'" John lets out a huff of air and continues, "I... I was scared. It was as if everything around me was flooding my senses all at once.... You looked so scared, Sherlock."
"Doctors say they could begin to wean him off the anesthetics tonight. Possibly wake up sometime tomorrow. If that's the case, probably early morning."
"I mean, when are you going to go home? When are you going to change, brush your teeth, sleep even!"
"Nice to meet you, I'm Jodie, one of Mr. Watson's surgical nurses. I just wanted to let you know, that he's one of the strongest patients I've ever seen. There were some points in surgery where it seemed... well, where it seemed grim, but he never gave up. I just hope you know that, medically, I've never seen a patient so intent on recovering. His body is working at an alarmingly fast rate. But don't worry, it isn't unhealthy, nothing to stress more over."
