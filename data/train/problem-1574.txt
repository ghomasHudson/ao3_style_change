It was one of Victor's old lab notebooks. The graduate student that had shown him around in the spring, and vanished before Sherlock had matriculated. He wasn't sure what had happened to Victor, whether he'd graduated or not, but what was important was that he wasn't here anymore. His notebooks and data, however, were.
"Milgram is not real, John. He is a plastic plant."
"He's
"And Mycroft is not."
Sherlock goes.
Sherlock self-destructs. He barely eats, and whenever he sleeps, he has nightmares more often than not. What about, he will never tell John. He experiments like a mad scientist and he chops up limbs from Molly in the kitchen and he flits around crime scenes like a man possessed and he can't play his violin.
And then, there is Sherlock.
He wanted--
Sherlock who was in pain and didn't like new people, and his wife was a bloody lying assassin that had put him there. And John, who had so
But he didn't want to... do this. To do any of this. He wanted to-- to--
John inhaled sharply a second time, suddenly reaching up to rub his face. It was a very transparent attempt to cover a grin with his hand, his eyes bright with brilliant amusement, and it didn't actually cover anything at all.
If he were Sherlock, he'd probably have deduced everything that was going on, right then and there, and in that one instant of looking at the scene. If he was anybody else other than himself, he'd have taken just a few moments to observe what was going on, and figured it out, and defused the situation as best he could.
This is his life. Mrs. Hudson gossiping about Mrs. Turner's cats, and livers on the kitchen table, and a case pending on his laptop, and his violin in hand. John at the surgery, coming home late tonight because of another meeting with his tutor. Perhaps they can meet at Angelo's instead. This, all of this, is his life. He is
"Bosco," Sherlock breathes. "Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy, Bosco?"
Dr. Wilson emerged around the frame of the door, bag slung over his shoulder and clearly on his way out for the night. He stopped by to flick the lights off, offering Sherlock a perfunctory, tired smile, and kept on walking.
Mrs. Hudson stares at him with open glee, and there is apparently nothing at all Sherlock can do beyond open and shut his mouth like a strangled fish. Not even two seconds ago he was talking, and now the words are stuck all the way back down into his chest and won't come out.
"Four are dead," he murmurs at length. He splays one hand out along the sheets, his fingertips trailing very close to one still, cold arm. "My agents were under orders to take them alive, but two were killed in the resultant shootout, and the two others that were present in their approach committed suicide with cyanide pills. They appear to have had military training. It is unfortunate, but--"
"Then?"
He wanted to kick the door shut, go make tea, and then sit down right next to Sherlock until he wrangled the truth out of him. He wanted to tell Sherlock to shut the hell up and stop playing him for an idiot, demand to find out what was wrong right now. He wanted to pull Sherlock into a hug and hold him until the pained grimace went away and whatever this was, make it right.
They need more honey again.
"Sherlock.
John knew exactly what Sherlock had thought he had imagined. And it was with a sad, regretful pang, because it hurt, just a little, that Sherlock couldn't bring himself to believe that what had happened had been real. But John would've thought just the same, if he'd woken up just as hungover as Sherlock and remembered what they'd said on that call.
It takes him a hatefully slow moment to even nudge his brain into understanding what Mycroft is trying to say. When it does click, it's with an uncomfortable heat rising in his cheeks, and he rolls his eyes again, lowering his face to tuck it behind his knees.
It actually wasn't all that unusual. Sherlock could be very picky about the cases and clients he took on, turning them down for the stunningly superficial and hilariously insignificant (John's favorite remained the deadpan
But-- he wasn't. Surely. He was good at labwork, and he knew it, but the rest... he knew he wasn't good at it. He had been told many times that he wasn't before and he knew he was deficient in too many areas to count. He was not
And as the evening wore on, the results were...
Mycroft's pale face pinches. He doesn't answer, just sits there and looks very, very tired. Unfortunately for him, John's patience has been left in the bin somewhere about this time last week.
it is
It's an irrefutable fact, though. Sherlock Holmes is completely, utterly, and hopelessly in love with John Watson, and he knew it the second his tablet's screen woke up in the middle of night they took him off his constant infusion of painkillers with a notification for a game of cluedo.
John smiled again, his hand tugging on his hair, this time to nudge Sherlock's head to lean against his shoulder. It wasn't quite as nice, but it
oh my god--"
It was simply a fact of life, now. As surely as the grass was green, and the earth went around the sun (or vice versa), Sherlock was going to kill Jim Moriarty.
The look on his face is...
Character B: what's he talking about?
And now
again.
Thank
John closed his eyes for a moment, swallowing in a deeper breath. He'd never felt more awful in his life. "I meant to," he rushed out, because it was
"--'n you know something else, Mycr? I'm scared. I'm
"You sure? You're
They are
It's not even an arguable point, but Sherlock still keeps his mouth shut. John doesn't like it when he lies, and John won't like the truth here, either. There is no recourse but to stay silent, and he frowns across the room again, free hand flexing and clenching under the table so as to not rub at the scar.
The innermost circle of hell was helping the person you were in love with get ready for a date.
"I love you, you ridiculous git," he mutters, exactly as loud as he dares. He settles the bowl down next to him and gently, carefully, lifts Sherlock's hand up beside it. It's long and limp and strong, his fingers dangling like loose puppet strings, fingertips clean and pale. The nails have almost entirely grown back.
It's observation." He glanced away and bit his swelling lower lip, trying not to pout. "I don't know why it annoys people. I'd want to know, if it were me."
He can feel every stitch inside him, his heart strangled and squeezing, his throat and lungs scraped raw, and his last scrape of a thought is that John is
I'm smarter than your whole office. I'm better than all of you, no matter how much your boys
John shrugged himself. Not really, no. Chemistry was chemistry, no matter the university, and a murder victim was just as dead no matter where they were. "We're fine with either," he agreed, nudging Sherlock's knee. "Yeah?"
he says
It was too difficult to dissect it. He'd given up trying. If he'd have ever gone back to Mary if he hadn't had his unborn child and Sherlock to worry about, because Sherlock had insisted he could trust her, but how, exactly, had John been meant to believe that? She'd already shot Sherlock once. Why was he supposed to trust that she wouldn't shoot him again, if John gave her a reason to? Why was he supposed to trust that she wouldn't do something to their baby? Why was he supposed to trust that she wouldn't shoot
Once again-- they were both doctors.
But John doesn't care about any of that. John, as he has reiterated so strongly, does not want
to revisit his own defeat and exquisite failure? Why should he want to remember what
"Yeah? That'd be because Mycroft made you drink enough water before you passed out. The dehydration is usually what causes the headache, but the nausea's from drowning yourself in what your body thinks is a poison and wants to get rid of it. There's no quick fix for that, I'm afraid." He smirked at Sherlock again, still sitting there with his head plonked down against the mug. "You should send your brother a gift basket."
He closes his eyes, presses his face to the pillow's familiar scent, and for just a few seconds, that's all there is.
He's not smiling.
Oscar," he hissed. He slid his hand up to curl into Oscar's hair, and he pulled. He pulled because he knew it hurt, and he knew it hurt because Oscar had done it to him to get him to shut his mouth. "I know what you are."
This wasn't right. How could this be right? How could Sherlock just sit there and look up at him like that and be so
"I know an apology can not possibly be- adequate, but-"
Finally, the shoe dropped. It clicked, and he understood. Finally, finally, finally. "Oh, Sherlock--" And he set his own fork down as well, to just look at him, and shake his head pityingly. Shake his head like he was a very foolish, very stupid child. "Sherlock. I'm flattered, really. But you can't honestly think this was... I'm married, now! Let's leave the past where it belongs, yes?"
John dragged him up by the collar, and socked a second punch straight across his face.
John sits for a few moments, his free hand sliding to the small of Sherlock's back. He rubs several gentle circles and Sherlock just breathes, each exhale shaking and every inhale a shallow whine.
Sherlock eats breakfast, now. Ever since the catastrophic meeting with Mycroft, he tries to at least consume the minimum number of recommend calories per day. It still doesn't work out to be enough. Not for a man of his ridiculous height, and not for a man that sprints miles and breathes fist fights for a living and scales walls like a cat.
He starts the move irritated that he's not being transferred straight home, and ends it baffled. He was shot in the chest, not getting a hip replacement.
He jogs up the street all the rest of the way back, barely even sparing the agents a glance. They'll keep out of his way if they know what's good for them. "I'll just go on up, then, ta?" he mutters, bags jostling on his arms, and takes the stairs two at a time.
John had no idea what to say.
If this were a case write-up, then it would not have begun with Sherlock losing his voice in the first place. He would not have stumbled onto this case through sheer serendipity, and then he would not have systematically had his own failure and defeat branded into his own skin. He would not have fashioned a white surrendering flag with his own blood and bits of shattered arm, tearing himself to shreds because he was so terribly

it wasn't that simple. It couldn't be. Because Sherlock wasn't okay, he wasn't even close, neither of them were. And the right thing to do here
John doubted that any of this was actually news to Sherlock. He had never talked about it with him, not once, but Sherlock
in his life, been a patient man?
On one hand, Sherlock obviously wasn't comfortable in this discussion, and he kept not being able to look at John, and flinching, and clearly was trying to say what he thought John wanted to hear instead of what he really thought and felt. And if John hadn't known Sherlock so well... it made a horrible sort of sense, didn't it? Because he had just
in his life. He's not scared of the men who did this to him, he's not scared for himself, he's...
And if he looked at it that way--
John hates that damn book.
"I don't like him," John said.
So he hugs his pillow, sips his tea, and, after the ride home, is really just too tired to do anything but give in.
Silently, utterly, perfectly silent, the only noise at all the hoarse gasps of air sucked deep into his throat. But he's crying.
He stays there, sitting in the deepest level of the palace, where it's cold and dim and he's shivering in his coat, aching all over and shellshocked. He keeps his head in his knees, breathing into his trousers, and above all else, he keeps his mouth shut.
Silence spreads again. There is nothing but electronic heartbeats, the soft hiss of oxygen, and the even softer drip of medication.
Now is the moment to speak.
when his loving wife had
John, the very picture of innocence in his chair, blinked. He blinked again. He looked utterly surprised, rather than properly threatened. "Cease and desist
Oscar kissed him again, his two fingers rubbing a little lower, first underneath his belt, then his pants. Sherlock tried very hard to focus on the last column of the article.
John's world inverted.
"Well," he says quietly, setting the sheet aside. "I'm not sure that anyone can ask you to do any better than try."
This is not for the reasons John thinks. He is not scared of John. He trusts John. There is not anything or anyone that he could possibly trust more than John Watson, and even with his body hurt the way it is, a newly conditioned response to flinch, his heart palpitating and his skin cold with sweat, he knows John
It's a solid five, he thinks. Maybe a six. Ordinarily, not worth leaving the flat, but he's already left the flat. The crime scene pictures detail a burglary gone wrong, at least, that's what the scene was made to look like- he's already relatively sure the whole thing was staged.
happened to him, John would've been notified. Besides, the room doesn't look like a patient was wheeled out in a hurry.
He can only hope that getting the hell out of this hospital will help. Because at this point, he does not know what else he can do.
Sherlock stayed panting in his pretzeled cocoon, and did not look up for a long time.
"It's okay," mind palace John tells him, his fingers tracing a line down the back of his neck. "You're okay, sweetheart.'

he was tired of this game. "The last time I considered it was with Victor. We talked about a collaboration we would do together. But I'm sure you heard how that ended up not working out."
John's grin broadened, as if he was very, very pleased about something. "Good? Do you feel good?"
Thank you so much for all the kudos/comments!!!
John's stomach dropped out from underneath him.
SSE, referenced by Sally, is Signed Supported English. Standard ASL/BSL aren't just a collection of signed analogues for English, they're languages unto their own, with their own vocabulary, grammar, syntax, and structure. SSE, on the other hand, is sort of an inbetween, which copies English's structure and vocabulary. It's perfect for someone like Sherlock, who is a beginner and isn't actually involved in Deaf culture, while someone like Sally, who is, will still be able to understand him. (Thanks to the folks at the ASL subreddit who advised me about SEE, and then Moreteaplease2 on ao3 for advising me about SSE!)
"Yes," John said, and smiled. "It would."
"Can you just..." He hangs his head wearily, rubbing a shaking hand over his mouth. He looks absolutely
winner, for god's sake. John rolled his eyes again, giving Sherlock's shoulder a nudge. "Everyone's second-rate, compared to you." He watched closely as his friend's mouth twitched and curled downwards, like he'd said something that was not at all funny, and sighed. "What've you got to lose, Sherlock?"
He's gone on his first case. Yes. He's proven that he doesn't need his voice to be the brilliant detective that he is.
Where the hell were Mycroft's people with that trace?
"-okay? Sherlock, slow down- do you need me to-"
It's so hatefully, disgustingly, unforgivably
John swallows, forcing his knees to bend as he sits himself back down at his side, not quite able to meet his eyes. He still wants to hit something. But that won't accomplish anything, nothing at all, so he is reduced down to simply twiddling his thumbs, all because Sherlock can't.
Today has gone about as badly as it could've possibly ended.
he could do this...
But there are benefits.
It's not fine. He'd rather Lestrade. Especially not Mycroft. Lestrade is slow and awkward but well-meaning, while Mycroft will be smug and arrogant and hold this over his head for the next century. He doesn't care. He's freezing and what the hell of his pride is there even left to save.
Sherlock didn't exactly flee. But he did squirrel backwards in his chair, instantly breaking gazes with John, his little finger starting up again as he looked just about anywhere else that he could. It looked like he'd welcome another explosion on the street, if that was what it took to distract him-- anything other than this.
defile it.
lest I give myself an aneur-"
That... that explained it, then. Didn't it? John shifted uneasily, trying to block out the rustling still coming from Sherlock's room. Of course they hadn't been able to go on public dates. Two men, in the early 2000s, both working at the same very high-profile university? No, they wouldn't have been able to go on public dates at all. Of course not. And it seemed that Sherlock had never really tried again after, so... this really was his first date.
Sherlock breathes noisily, the quiet hiss of supplemental oxygen filling John's ears. His heavy eyelids don't even flicker.
people that insist upon wasting his time. But because he can not speak or make noise, it is as if the space he used to take up in a room evaporates. He doesn't exist unless he has something vocal to contribute, and it is stupid, unhelpful, and
John sighed again, and slumped sideways to bury his face into his hands.
Absolutely nothing about Sherlock is someone that can sit still.
but... he was afraid of something. There was something about what was going on here that was making him feel uneasy and John was starting to get the feeling it wasn't just this. There was something here underneath the Culverton case that was bothering Sherlock.
"A bit, in a way-- Sherlock, come on, sit down." John squeezed his hand again and pulled, very gently, bringing Sherlock down fully into his chair, and once there he just stroked the inside of his wrist in that way of his, the way he did when he wanted to help calm him down. "Like I said, nothing without permission. But you and Victor weren't the only students who had their work stolen by Oscar. You also were the last student that he-- slept with--" His jaw clenched again, his eyes dark. John, Sherlock knew, hated to speak about it like that. He hated the words Sherlock used to describe it, and how they still tended to be positive and light and...
He ran a hand down Sherlock's long, thin back again, marveling that this

Ice freezes in John's stomach. "We've been on a case," he spits past gritted teeth. "He's never eaten when he's on a case, Mycroft." God knows this isn't something he wants to defend, and Mycrof is

"Yes," he murmured, with a satisfactory nod. "You'll be fine."
"You've got butterflies! You! Sherlock Holmes!"
"I don't know why you want me to go back to Mary," John says finally. His voice is rough again, and he continues to stab at his food with unnecessary vehemence.. His face is very little short of anguish. "I don't know why you're trying so hard to convince me of it, why you apparently don't care enough about yourself that getting shot doesn't even matter, why you're so sure you're-
Mycroft rolls his eyes again, looking at Sherlock rather than him. "You sorely underestimate my brother."
He cushions his thumb in the curve of one of the familiar furrows, stroking it up and down, and listens to how it feels against his hand. He hears the smoothness of it over the words in his mouth.
She won't say anything, because Sherlock
and they go there even more frequently now. It's just simply easier, to have the owner already not be expectant of Sherlock to speak.
He can't speak, because he doesn't want to.
No. No, it's not a case. No, he is-- no.
As if he knows.
John frowns. "Sherlock? What is it?" Sherlock hasn't tended to be very resistant about physical therapy yet, and the exercises he's supposed to do right now are only tedious, rather than painful. But he very much needs to do them. Forming scar tissue on his hands, his back, his legs-- now is the most crucial time, time that they won't be able to get back if he wastes it by being stubborn. "Sherlock, you can't skip--"
Sherlock pauses for a moment longer, exhaling a lingering puff of smoke. His irritation twinges again, a violin string plucked pizzicato and pulled just a hair too tight.
John thought, miserable.
He likes scars, actually.
take Sherlock away from him. "Then you should've asked one not on your payroll. He's not a danger to himself or others and you can't force him to get treatment that he doesn't want."
The tests don't find anything.
John is still here, and Sherlock, quite obviously, is not dead.
Slowly, almost warily, John joined him in sitting down. His fingers stayed curled around his hands but his face stayed calm, always nothing but calm, and Sherlock anchored himself on that as he listened on. He could always trust John.
"Mycroft was here," he sighs, scowling at the room at large. John gives him a curious look and Sherlock jabs his head, nodding to the chess game abandoned on his desk. Mycroft had been humoring John- black appears to have been engaged in a strategy to systematically take every piece on the opposing side. "Why was Mycroft here? And why did you let him in?"
"Stay... just stay put, yeah? Don't go running off into any more trouble."
"I know," John hums. His arms wrap around him in an impossibly warm, desperately inescapable bubble. It is so
John's eyes warmed with relief. Which was simply
They sit together, on the closest thing to a kerb they can find. John a little stiffly, and Sherlock, as if his legs have all but gone out from under him.
Sure enough, the footsteps pause.
So Sherlock sets himself up in Lestrade's office on Donovan's day off. He strides in with a pre-written note demanding cold case files, and the inspector looks a little surprised, but is immediately willing. "If you're really that insistent about it," he muses, pulling up one on his computer. "Thought you hated cold cases, though. The crime scenes aren't there anymore, you have to rely on other people's shoddy work, all that rubbish. Where's John?"
Staring at him in naked, horrified alarm.
flailing beside him, and now what? They're
He gets dressed. He doesn't see the damn point, but John glares at him when he wears a sheet and says it's inappropriate and humiliating over Skype, and he doesn't like when he can see the dots of scars on his chest, so he gets dressed. Mostly. He wears pajamas when he can be bothered.
He went quiet for a moment again, his eyes still down on the table. His expression looked curiously calm, a twisted parallel of John's own anger and disgust; it was as if Sherlock had passed off everything he should've felt and given it to John instead.
Was this what John had wanted? John had told him that
"Here," he calls.
Sherlock waits on the edge of the bed. Rather than trying to wrangle him into proper street clothes that they'll only have to then fight him right out of-- because he is not going anywhere but straight home to bed, John will make sure of that-- he just huddles in the same pajamas he's worn his entire stay here, looking awkward and small. The Belstaff is buttoned up to his throat, empty left sleeve sitting in his lap on top of the remains of the muffins from Mrs. Hudson's last visit.
Sherlock's throat jumps as he swallows, his eyes again darting from John to over his shoulder and back again. He blinks hard and shakes his head, like he's having trouble focusing, and stares at John with eyes that are flickering too fast. He's trying to deduce and it's not working. Or it is, but he's too drugged and hurt to make any sense out of the storm of details that his overactive brain latches around and won't let go.
and no small part of him wanted to just kiss that wary shadow of fear away.
John gasps, "you're a nutter, that's what you are." He cradles his face and hair and strokes his cheeks as if they're something indescribably precious, his voice shivering against Sherlock's skin. "You're not making any sense-- you've been practising, haven't you? This isn't the first time--"
Sherlock flinched very slightly. Just a small, full-body twitch. He put his own tea down and steepled his fingers together, winding them into a tight knot as if to keep them still, hiding the shadows of his face behind them. He looked faintly ill for a second and once again stared at his hands rather than John.
pray tell, would he call John if there was a
If he'd watched someone else hurting Sherlock like that a few years ago, before Mary's death, the wedding, the fucking fall, he'd have-- have--
His phone buzzes again a moment later, warm and insistent in his hand.
But he already does trust John. He always has.
A full week after the rescue, Sherlock starts stirring.
He proposes a meeting with Magnussen. Because Magnussen remains a threat, primarily in his aims to control Mary, but that puts John under his sphere of influence, and this Sherlock

It feels like his heart is breaking into a thousand pieces. He just wants to pick Sherlock up and haul him back to bed, because he is
He's been reluctant to play for John until he's rebuilt his callouses and fully restored the muscle memory, but the look on John's face whenever he
Sherlock opens his mouth, the words already in his throat, then snaps it shut it again. He wets his lips and as good as confesses it right then and there.
John turns away to cover his mouth, swallowing desperately at bile. His leg aches and he has to pace before it buckles underneath him. This is so much worse. It's not because Mycroft doesn't take him seriously, it's not because Mycroft thinks he couldn't handle it, not because Mycroft is trying to manage so much else at any one moment that he simply forgot.
"And you don't."
Sherlock shoos him away while barely looking, and makes no effort to hide the needle. The needle is a misdirect, anyway. The ashtray of powdered sugar next to him waits innocently, and the vial of much the same is positioned perfectly in the hollow of the dictionary. The real cocaine has already been tucked securely away into the flour at the very back of one of their highest cabinets. Because apparently, they have flour.
Ella cleared her throat again, her eyes softening. "It's also natural to be wary of relationships you see in others, John. Sometimes, you might even look at relationships that you see your friends have, be reminded of your own, and see abuse when there is nothing there."

"No, John, really, I mean it-- it's nothing," Greg insisted, his voice harder than before. "It was just conjecture anyway, I never met him, and Sherlock never actually said anything about him. Besides, if this guy was actually bad news, I doubt Sherlock would willingly meet him for drinks." He stopped for a moment, clearly replaying what he'd just said in his head, then shot John another grin. "Well.
"John, I..." Sherlock started, and something in his voice made John stare back up in worry. "You must know that I would never-- not with Rosie. I understand she must be your priority. She's mine, too. I wouldn't ever--"
"Victor Trevor was an idiot. I met him."
John gritted his teeth again, and forced the wave of anxiety back down into his stomach.
Mycroft, he--" He trails off and nearly chokes on the madness of it, wanting to tear his own hair out. How is this happening?! This can't be happening!
"Both? Hang on, hang on, all right, no... coke?" He frowns, giving Sherlock a disgruntled look as he takes the cash. "Cat got your tongue? Wait for me a moment."
At last, the genius sits forward, his steepled fingers unwound. He types into the keyboard, lightning quick, and a moment later, the text box springs up.
"Scott, every case I have ever had of selective mutism has been a child, who was unable to speak specifically in school, and had a comorbidity with social anxiety. Which you clearly do not have. Most also had autism, which--" Sherlock straightens up even more, fury building in the base of his spine, and the doctor raises a genial hand already in surrender. "Which you have made your opinion about a diagnosis perfectly clear in the past."

"What he has with that man is no
, Myc-"
And he's not. What just happened this morning has shown that, clear as day. He's just not.
It makes Sherlock wants to ask to be put back on morphine.
"No," Sherlock said.
Baiting it out further, John nods. Sherlock's brow furrows.
And don't ta... don't

"Oh, yes. Of course, Your Highness." John rolls his eyes, but his answering grin is bright and warm, and he
It's good, though. Working a case. A real, live case, for the first time since John's wedding. He breaths it in, being Sherlock Holmes, again, and it feels
He keeps one secure hand on Sherlock's wrist, supporting his arm and measuring his pulse in one. It's still too fast. "We'll definitely get this on ice when we get home," he promises again, because for a moment he worries that it's just the pain. It easily could be. He's been there. He knows how
He was standing even closer, now. His arms braced on either side of Sherlock, standing tall over him, looking down at him and touching his hair with that same encouraging smile. Nobody had ever stood this close to Sherlock and looked at him like this. He reached for data and hit a blank file, and then another blank file, and then a whole cabinet of completely empty files. What was he supposed to do? How was he supposed to react?
He tries to tell John that it's okay, again. In as simple language as he can make it, he tries to tell John that it's all right, he is fine, he doesn't need to be sorry. His cold fingers fumble at first, but before he's even halfway through John's face falls, and he shakes his head, wrapping his hands around Sherlock's to keep them still. "No, listen to me. I'm trying to say that I know things have been very difficult for you, and instead of supporting you I'm pretty sure I've only made things worse. Just... god, Sherlock! Look at this--" He splays his fingers through Sherlock's again, cradling them close to his chest. "You can't even talk to me! It's been
"Oh, did you."
John took another deep breath. Forcibly, finger by finger, he unclenched his fists in his lap, and dug his hands into the arms of his chair instead. He still badly wanted,
where he's fighting a smile because he doesn't want to indulge Sherlock but is going to give in anyway. "And stop being such a baby. When I was shot I was in rehab for months."
"Come on. I know I'm not as good at it as you, but I know you can suffer through it." But his smile, that wonderful, small little smile that Sherlock would and has done
but... you think I'm best off with anything who's not you."
"You should go home," he says.
Mycroft nodded once. "His physician shared your concerns, and suggested to me that Sherlock might be under some form of severe stress. Sherlock told both me and him to leave him alone with several choice words that I see no reason to repeat, and refused to speak on the matter in any way. I stepped out of his room for twenty minutes to confer with his physician, and when I came back, he had left. Quite against medical advice."

The words come haltingly, his fingers slow and stiff as he forces them across the page. The shame burns in the back in his throat and he wants to eradicate them from existence.

John's brain flipped the
He stands before the bathroom mirror and he looks at himself. He looks at the mess his hair turns itself into overnight, and how his eyes are heavy and bloodshot after a night of sleep. He looks at his own long fingers, and sometimes he traces them over the mirror, one by one. Sometimes he measures his own pulse. Sometimes he angrily brushes his teeth and listens to himself breathe.
He's tired of not having anything to say, and he's tired of the fact that nobody's listening to him even if he tries.
They're still monitoring the pressure inside his skull. If Sherlock can't keep it under control, they're going to have to start drilling holes in him.
said. Not just about Sherlock, but about himself, too. About being frustrated, and feeling (utterly ludicrously) that he is
John stopped that line of thought before it could get off the ground.
"Well," he spat, when he finally found his voice again. "As lovely as it is to mix business with pleasure. As I've said, I'm not interested in any sort of business partnership, Oscar. So, unless there was something else you wanted to ask me...?"
The inspector coughed twice, seeming torn between wanting to go and wanting to stay. "Right," he said, shifting in palpable discomfort. "Well, you two look... done in. Really. I'll just- pop in tomorrow, then? After you've gotten some sleep?"
because this is the only way to make John happy.
He can bear a few hours in A&E.
"But thousands of people have loveless marriages, Ella," he said next, looking away. Something inside his chest hurt and he bit his lip, trying to swallow it down. "Even my bloody sister's marriage was pretty damn miserable by the end. That doesn't make it abusive."
None of it had helped in even the slightest sense of the word.
"No. No Cambridge."
After all, at least this time, Sherlock wasn't to be abandoned for something
He could go outside for a smoke. A... very long, questionably relaxing smoke.
"Sherlock," he commands, his voice loud and with the bite of a soldier, and flips the lights on.
Ella gave him a few moments more, as if he might suddenly remember something else that he had done. Which, John thought, was probably fair. He'd already said more than enough for a lifetime, but with Sherlock, it was never that simple. He wouldn't have been surprised if there was more to admit to, either. More for him to apologise for. More that he done
hobble out of this damn cold.
"John."
"He doesn't seem all that excited about it. Or happy, or... normal. At all. I know Sherlock's not normal, but I really think he only even said yes to the date to get me to shut up about it." And since when had Sherlock done that? When had Sherlock not taken John's nagging as a challenge to be stubborn and dig his heels in and fight like a damn bull? "He acted strangely at Cambridge as well. I don't know what was wrong, exactly, but he definitely didn't want to be there."
The only option he has is to stand there in the doorway, radiating annoyance and disapproval, and do what he can to make sure none of this gets out of control.
I think I've spent the last two weeks wanting to throw up."

He'd suspected as much. He'd certainly realised it on his own; that this was what normal people
"You're stalling, sweetheart."
John tells him, smiling. "People will talk, Sherlock."
Sherlock breathes, and forcibly lifts himself back to Francis' office.
Nobody who has had any hand in putting Sherlock where he is now is going to live all that much longer.
"John if you do not cease and desist immediately I swear upon everything that is not holy I will take that hideous jumper and conduct an experiment into the consistency of its ashes."
He dropped his face into the crook of Sherlock's neck, one hand still rubbing his other shoulder, very, very gently. It was an odd sensation: too much tactile stimuli to properly translate. Sherlock had hated it, at first, but he was learning to appreciate it for what it was.
Sherlock rolls his eyes at his retreating back. He already jitters on the spot, his palms sweaty and chest fluttering with something that isn't quite yet a craving, but it will be, if he lets this go on. He will let this go on.
Then, John lets his hands drop, and says, "
motions. There's no case that rises above a four, and he wants to wilt into the floor because of it. John, by the increased frequency of cups of tea delivered to him, can tell something is on his mind. John is, once again, worried about him.
Sherlock is folded up next to him, pen stuck in his mouth and journal in his lap. He is wide awake, as per usual, probably having not slept any more than two or three hours, but his eyes are bright and he looks as well-rested as a man in bed late Saturday morning should look.
Now Sherlock rolls his eyes, his fingers tapping against each other even faster. He's amused, even while trying only to look exasperated instead, and John knows he's won.
"Yes," he said firmly. "Or-- no. It won't make me happy. But it is something that I think I need."
hating it, because he wants Sherlock to be comfortable, doesn't he? He certainly doesn't want the opposite. He wants Sherlock to be happy. And by all appearances, that is what he is. He bounces around a crime scene, deducing as easily as ever, and John is the only one to have a problem with it.
John beams back.
and he still covers his face as if he's ashamed for John to see it. So John doesn't look. He just wraps his arms around him from behind, burying his face into his back. "I'm sorry. I wanted... I didn't know what to do and I wanted help.
Sherlock looks- and feels- dreadful. He's wearing unflattering pajamas, his third best dressing gown, and accepted a wheelchair because falling on his face would otherwise be in his future, and he doesn't actually want to be murdered by John. If Sally Donovan had been in tow, there's a solid chance he would've reversed course and saved his pride.
"Sherlock. Depressed."
(See the end of the chapter for

Then, he just dropped his head back against the sofa, and the fight drained out of him like a deflated balloon.
it was. It was already unforgivable without this part to begin with, but this, too? On top of everything else?
The other shoe did not drop until midway through April, and Milgram's continued existence in their lives had been boiled down to nothing more than an unavoidable fact.
"Perhaps," Mycroft murmured. "I never got the chance to see that play out, because my dear brother never showed up."
Sherlock's face twitched into a sardonic smile. "As it should, Doctor." He held up one hand, flat, turning it this way and that, and accepted his tea with the other. "See? Perfectly steady."
And even when he doesn't die, John Watson leaves.
John turned his gaze away from Greg. First for a furtive glance out the window, and then just frowned at it the whole away. Trying to focus on the streets and trees passing them by, and not the inspector watching him out of the corner of his eye.
"Don't ask me to leave," he says. He
Sherlock stares.
He'd believe it was from the cold, if it wasn't only in one hand.
Then he pulled back with a sigh he felt against his face, foreheads touching, and, well, that was that.
Sherlock, midway through yet another protest, blinked.
How else would you like me to define it for you?"
As ever, you see, but you do not observe.
it's good. "He broke the vase on her, probably in a fit of drunken rage. They realised she needed medical attention, and staged the burglary to explain it."
He loves this man. He loves him so
he screamed, right in Greg's face. He panted and flushed bright red and stared at him with glittering, mad eyes, and then it was another switch flipped and he suddenly twisted back into himself, folded up like a pretzel and covering his face and breathing so hard it sounded like he was a running a sprint. A sprint away from Greg, away from everything, far away from everything.
"Yes," he spat. He could barely hear himself speak, his voice distant and tiny in his ears as if from a hundred miles away. "You were right, Oscar. It certainly does help me to... relax."
This wonderful, lucky Bosco. His only concerns are his next meal, and finding an affectionate enough human to make sure he is petted enough to be satisfied at all times. A simple-minded, loyal, fantastic creature; what must it be like, in their funny little heads? It must not be boring at all. It must be absolutely
Sherlock remained silent, faced away from him in the light of the sitting room, his back stiff and his arms crossed. For a moment, John wasn't sure if he'd even been heard at all. It certainly wouldn't have been the most unusual pose Sherlock had decided to tune out the rest of the world in...
"...Yes, John. Milgram. The

chair, his hands folded in his lap and his umbrella propped up by his side. There are no case files in sight, and it is to no one's surprise that Sherlock has not poured him a cuppa. The look on Mycroft's face is-- exasperated, if he has to put a word on it. In a patronising, annoyed sort of way, like a parent who has had to tell their five year old
Damn it.
Sherlock had paced across the room to just
But whatever the case was, even Dr. Slug in a Suit was better for Sherlock than John.
"You're a bit quiet," Greg said, upon coming to idle at a red light. They were nearly ten minutes away from campus, and John had barely managed more than a hello. "Something happen, at Cambridge?"
You can imagine how well that's gone."
Sherlock grins back, letting himself drop back to the bed and John's arms. "I like four syllable words," he breathes, which is quite possibly the most pointless, stupid, and non-romantic statement anybody has ever said,
As it turned out, Sherlock actually slept straight through the morning.

Sherlock sunk his head deeper into his arms, and, for the second time in nearly as many minutes, seriously considered ramming his head into the wall.

true. Somehow, one way or another, they
Sherlock staggered inside after him, his head still hanging and his reeling slow and uncoordinated enough for him to know that whatever he'd taken, it wasn't his usual stimulants. Probably heroin, Greg thought, with a tsk of his tongue. Cocaine was dangerous, on the edge, and fun. Heroin was none of those things. Heroin killed people.
What?
Sherlock's mobile buzzes to life, the screen going bright in an instant glow, and
(Milgram is a Rattlesnake Plant, chosen for several reasons, but... mostly just because of the name. Also, we know if Sherlock got a plant, it'd be something exactly that ridiculous. Want to know the explanation behind Milgram's name? Keep going! But the short of it is, Sherlock's a nerd and so am I~)
The idea makes Sherlock's stomach twist, and he shakes his head without hesitation. No. He uses Francis to learn possible strategies to try, and as a textbook to pry details from, and as a source to interrogate, to find out what is normal and what is not. Not-- he will not have a breakthrough in
John gets ready unbearably quickly; he is, as ever, nothing if not efficient. He pulls on his coat and leaves the kettle in the sink in a clatter, pulling together his things, and all Sherlock wants to do is say
My, I c'n't stand it. I," and Sherlock was still crying, utterly drunk off his arse and barely cognizant. He clearly hadn't realised that Mycroft hadn't spoken back to him in approaching five minutes. "I
I, I don't... I w-want..."
He has to get home. He has to get home right now.
The words are a bit sad, to be honest. They are desperately hoarse, each syllable caught in his throat, and there they snag like gravel. It sounds like he's just spent the last hour smoking, or that he's caught the flu going around and spent the night vomiting up the contents of his stomach.
Their suspect is not an intelligent or quick-witted man. He is a very dull, vacuous creature, who has every reason to want to run from the police, and enough stupid bravado to try to punch his way out of trouble instead. According to all of Lestrade's dithering back there, they do not currently have enough to arrest him, but Sherlock is confident all the evidence they need is in his flat. All they need to do is to stall him here until it's found.
Damn it.
John waited, for a minute or two. He watched Sherlock out of the corner of his eye until the hard lines of tension began to fade, as Sherlock understood an interrogation was not forthcoming. He watched and drank his own tea and waited for Sherlock to reestablish himself, and remember that, if noting else, he was at least safe with John.
John paused a moment, and chose his words very carefully.
Sherlock inhales again, jerky and ragged. His face is flushed and shiny with sweat and he looks as upset as he was last night all over again.
"That's incredibly naughty of you," he murmured, allowing himself a wicked grin. Of course he'd been right. He was
"You're going to stay away from Sherlock Holmes," John warned quietly. "You are never,
He desperately wants to get Sherlock out of here.
"Oh my god." John sat up straighter, the knot in his stomach suddenly softening straight into warm fondness. "You're
When they got to Cambridge, he was shot out of the car before Greg had even turned the engine off, and on his way to march inside.
Sherlock rolled his eyes into his pillow.
Then the breakthrough passes.
Ah, well. The tabloids would've figured it out sooner or later. No sense to worry about the eventual tears over already spilled milk.
He starts around so suddenly he almost drops his violin.
His features reduced back to ice cold, Sherlock smoothly extricated himself, and turned his back as gracefully as a hungover, sleep-drunk man could look. "I'm going to take a shower," he announced, his affect flat, and strode away without looking back.
He has to explain, to justify this, to find some way to spin it that is not so embarrassing, and humiliating, utterly
It's a very moving and sincere speech. John absolutely
he should've started with Molly. What nonsense. He's thinking slow, nowadays, but obviously this is where he should've started. Molly will be easier. Molly is sweet and kind and compassionate, and small and gentle and will be so sickeningly understanding if he fails. Molly will be absolutely fine. Of course he will be able to do this with Molly; how could he ever be afraid of Molly Hooper?
"There we are," he said, shooting Sherlock a lazy grin. He dropped one arm around his shoulders, pulling him in closer to his side for a squeeze. "That took a lot longer than I thought it would; I'm beat. How're you doing, Sherlock?"
"What the
But first, he had to do better by Sherlock.
John smiled into him, squeezing him very, very tight. "I
So John isn't surprised in the slightest when, after paying the cabbie and checking in on Mrs. Hudson, he makes his way upstairs to find Sherlock already in his mind palace.
His stomach and chest remain a detailed canvas of charcoaled skin and tell the story of a carcass for a butcher. They'd been mostly shallow cuts, excruciatingly careful not to bleed too deeply or cut a chunk of liver or lung that he'd need to talk, and the patterns that spill between his ribs are as uninspired as they are boring. There's one particular patch of skin that is electric burns doused in acid, and he's loved to catalogue the healing as much as John has hated to acknowledge its existence. His back is much the same, whip marks that intersperse with a galaxy of knife punctures and little hills of cigarette burns and stripes of acid. The acid in particular had been a favorite... low concentrations of weak acid do not dissolve skin or bone, contrary to popular belief. They simply hurt. An incredible amount, when the ideal solution is found. They hurt an even more incredible amount when doused onto already open wounds.
are you smiling at?"
Simple. Flawless. Foolproof!
It was just like that day at Cambridge. He felt well enough to work a case... but something about this one made him say
for it all to be for nothing. For John to see who he really is, right here at the finish line, and be there when something happens and he can't do it and he fails
Sherlock-- writes a line. He scrawls a bullet point down, long, sloppy letters in a shaking hand. He moves down, and starts a second. God, he's
In fact, what John now wanted, more than anything, was an excuse to change the bloody subject. He risked a glance back over at Sherlock to see that his friend at least did look calmer now, still leaned back against the sofa with his tired gaze now floating on the ceiling. The acceptance of his apology did at least seem genuine, this time-- the people Sherlock was really angry at weren't in this room. Those who had made assumptions over the years, and assuredly said things to him much, much worse than
He's considering a dog. Asking about one, at least, to Mrs. Hudson and to Sherlock. He's delayed it thus far since broaching that question would be minefield, because it means admitting to Sherlock he's been talking about him behind his back with Mycroft. But at this point, what else can he do?
want to hurt you again, but. I especially don't want to hurt you on accident, just because you thought you couldn't or it wasn't worth speaking up to tell me to stop. I don't want you to... hurt yourself, Sherlock."
Finally, the chapter we've all been waiting for!
His experiment notebook is open in his lap, and tucked into it, where John can not see, is a sheet of staff paper.
"Some day, Sherlock?" John wags his own fork in his face, particularly bright-eyed and entertained. "You are going to wear out that poor man's patience. And then what'll we do? We won't be able to keep you fed with free cake from anyone but Mrs. Hudson!"
Until this Dr. Andrews had showed up, and started oozing his slime all over the corridor.
"Oh," Greg said again, frowning in the mirror. "Whoops, miscommunication. The victim was a chemistry professor at Cambridge, not Oxford." He shrugged, flipping on his turn signal to change lanes. "Not that it makes a difference to you two."
Sherlock was set firmly down on the route to lose his mind, and John was the bloody proximal cause.
Slowly, his eyes drift over John. They're barely cognizant, and John isn't sure if he's being heard at all.
He thought about how Oscar had reacted, the first times he'd tried to tell him no. How he'd just brushed it off, and kept pushing until the no turned into a yes, and kept pushing from there, too, until he'd stopped saying it at all. He thought about how Oscar had reacted, the first time he'd told him
John turns away, up on his feet to pace, his back to Sherlock as his shoulders hunch and tremble in just barely restrained fury. He ends up in the kitchen, gripping the table of his experiments in white-knuckled fists with each and every breath a fight.
"Hey," he says gently. "It's going to be okay."
The look on Sherlock's face cleared, and he swung back around to face the outside world with nothing more than a billow of his coat.
Whatever it was that Sherlock had been so worried about happening tonight clearly had not been a problem after all. Sherlock was... enjoying himself. He was out on a date, that John had all but dragged him to go on, kicking and screaming, and apparently everything had just been a smash hit, because Sherlock was still there. With Dr. Slug in a Suit. Having a
Maybe this article was the reason Sherlock had come here after all.
John had said. All right.
He could speak now. He could clear his throat, and speak up. Give them a way to communicate, when John is obviously too tired to sign or to text. Give John a reason to smile.
"She always worries. Since when have you listened?"
The politician rolls his eyes, like the display is childish, somehow. A childish and dramatic tantrum, and not his
John was still alive. But how badly had he been hurt because he'd been just
abnormal, in every sense of the word. Oscar wouldn't do this with just anyone, and telling him no felt like a rejection of that. Being slow and stupid and
"Did you know that Victor Trevor isn't Dr. Wilson's only former student to have such a long fall from grace? Or the only one to drop out of school?"
"I know you're thinking, in there," he says. His nails trail gently along his face, under his eye, through his hair. "Stop it. Whatever you're thinking, it's stupid." He grins again, brushing his lips against his. "Don't look like that; it's true. You're a mad genius, but I'm getting pretty good at telling when you're being a genius, and when you're just mad. And the look on your face right now is when you're usually just mad. So I'm going to tell you again, Sherlock. I love you, and you are the most bloody incredible man on the continent. Insufferable, too, but incredible as well." He tilts his head, his tired grin in the low light turning teasing, and he licks his lips in a way that is just simply
It wasn't a good sign that Sherlock, even in his intoxicated state, knew exactly how far his dealer was from him. But they'd deal with it. They had to. Sherlock hadn't used, and that was what was important.
figure. He looked at John paler than Sherlock had been this afternoon, but while Sherlock had been shaken, Mycroft stared back down at him now and the only word there was for it was anger.
Then he turns back on his heel, and walks back to Sherlock's room without another word.
damn it, and he wants Sherlock in this conversation because he can think of no more succinct way to tell the man to fuck off. "Isn't it, Sherlock?"
Bosco belongs to one of Sherlock's contacts, a former member of the homeless network who now makes his living as a software engineer, slipping Sherlock tips and what's new on the market on the side. Sherlock doesn't make his way around often, but he does just often enough that Bosco recognises his face. He loves to play and be petted, and Sherlock is helpless but to indulge him.
Normally, he has any number of things to keep him occupied, during a spontaneous couch cuddle. His mind palace, science journals, experiment records. Silently bugging John into changing the channel to something slightly more tolerable than late night talk shows.
He groaned.
This, John takes as his cue.
"Shut up." He stares at him, white-faced and still cold as glass, and the mug of tea rattles as if he wants to shatter it. "I don't want you involved because your
no. "No," he gasped, a new lump in his throat. "That's not what I was trying to say at all, Sherlock, of course not, how could you think...?"
"I could help you shave. If you'd like."
Yeah, of course he had. It shouldn't have been his choice. He should've been taken out of university altogether the second it had gotten so bad he'd ended up in the bloody hospital.
Sherlock is capable enough at communicating now, when it comes to crime scenes and his deductions. He texts without issue, and he signs vigorously with Donovan, taking the criticisms in stride. But beyond what he needs for the Work... it's as if there are now two Sherlocks. One, the genius consulting detective, and then, the one that plays violin and loves dogs and curls up delightedly on John's lap. The genius consulting detective is able to speak, albeit with much difficulty. His Sherlock, the one that can not even pretend to be a machine, no matter how much he might like to be one, can not.
What he doesn't forgive is that the bullet went straight through Sherlock, and smashed a second gunshot wound directly into John Watson's life.
But the interviews are disastrous, and the head scans reveal next to nothing. Sherlock may be unwilling to communicate, but his brain is still working, behind his enigmatic eyes, and the deductions are still happening. The second the doctor hands him a collection of plastic children's blocks, to see if he might've lost shape recognition overnight and try to force a square-shaped peg into a circular block, Sherlock just about has a fit. A violent, spitting, mad fit of a tantrum. John has to desperately play to two sides at once, pleading with Sherlock to stop, stop,
It's not. Sherlock still doesn't want to answer.
Forgot to say
"Well, then," Dr. Andrews sniffed, looking a little off put. He again straightened his tie and glanced down the corridor after Sherlock, who was already now talking with someone else while he waited for the lift. Another professor-- another Dr. Slug in a Suit, as far as John was concerned. "Best of luck, to the both of you?"
He looked across at Sherlock.
"You know what I mean. I don't think--" John closed his eyes, because oh,
and John must be
John said nothing. Sherlock took a deep breath, pressing just a little bit closer to John's back.
John swallowed again. He thought about Sherlock, unshaven and bloody-eyed in his chair, looking confused and small and insecure, a mug of tea in his hands as he looked anywhere but at John. Fuck.
about this scene, he does not
John sat back himself; his head was spinning. No Janine. No Irene. No beautiful, clever, strong-willed dominatrix with sharp eyeliner and red lips that would whip Sherlock across the face and make him beg for mercy right there on the desk. Twice.
He tries to scream.
that crucial thing in life, that he was missing?
Next up, Sherlock and John are going to try a thing called "communication" and "an actual conversation". Novel, I know. It'll (hopefully) be great ^_^
"Milgram needs watering."
"While you were away," John repeats carefully. "Is that where you got those scars, then?"
John agreed full-heartedly. Even though just about every contact here had been initiated by Sherlock-- even though the date itself had ended, again, after
Sherlock tries to sign something. But his hands are shaking and he still can't properly move his left arm, wincing badly every time he tries. John tries to keep his arm still but it's not working, and whatever he wants so badly to say isn't coming out.
John has spent four months unable to talk to Sherlock. Sherlock has spent the same period of time unable to talk to
Well, it was true. With every sip of whiskey, he was no longer such a nervous wreck there was a solid chance of him vomiting right there at the table.
John reads what Sherlock can not say, and stays just as silent and still with him. He lets Sherlock hold him, he lets Sherlock stand there, and he waits.
John squeezes his eyes shut, his heart aching, and eases his way out of bed instead.
that was a mistake.
Her eyes flutter, an odd mixture of expensive mascara and red and puffy. "Would you?" She hands him her phone, already pulled up to her most recent conversation, and Sherlock decides that being human isn't all bad after all.
"It's not a direct parallel, of course. But as you do regard me as an authority figure, in certain, very specific roles, and you are already accustomed to obeying orders, I... determined it would be worth it, to attempt a Milgram experiment of my own."
"...yeah. Yes. That's... yes." John nods, once. His head is heavy, his eyes still half-drooping, but a hand cups his shoulder and stays there, circles traced into his bare skin. "That's good, Sherlock, that's really good. We were going to start weaning you to oxy soon anyway- your attending will be happy. It's always a good sign when the patient requests less painkillers." He looks to Sherlock's PCA next, nudging the constant infusion rate down a notch or two. The renewed pang hits almost immediately. "All right?"
Sod this. Sod this.
It's like his words have made something in John click. His smile shifts, turning tender and he looks down at Sherlock with so much affection and love it feels like he's drowning. What a way to go that would be. Another warm swell of laughter spills out from his throat and he drops back down, hugging Sherlock to him, and dear
But Mrs. Hudson only shook her head again, giving a stack of papers on the desk an organisational shake. A shake in which she came perilously close to Milgram. "After all that I hear John going on about? This thing sounds more work-intensive than a puppy, somedays!"
Sherlock heals.
Sherlock is his emergency contact. They had called Sherlock. Who, of course, would not have been able to answer the phone. Who now only has a single voicemail to go off of, telling him that John has ended up in hospital with a head injury.
His bright eyes flicked away, looking anywhere but at John. He fiddled with his tea and shifted in his chair, the line of his jaw jumping, and John had seen him look like that far too many times these past few days for it to be okay. He resolved, right then and there, that one of the things he was going to do was make Sherlock realise he never had cause to feel that uncomfortable or worried again.
Sherlock can feel the words now, trapped and budding in his throat. They've turned into a parasitic fungus that has taken root, and one that needs to be excised if he doesn't want for it to spread to his lungs and heart and kill him. He's
Sherlock isn't worried. Lestrade is tragically unskilled at the science of deduction.

"...Yes," he admitted, on through gritted teeth. "I got him
Except Sherlock flinching away is not endearing, and his violent, hostile terror is not cute.
Oh. All right.
John somehow doubts that they can wait to diffuse this situation until the police get there.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. First at the metaphorical whimsy-
"Ah," he said, vaguely, like he was responding to someone who wasn't even there. "Quite right." He cleared his throat, hands buried down into his pockets, and swept past him straight into the lift. "To Baker Street, then? Come quickly, John; we have much to do!"
It's positively hateful, and worse than that, embarrassing.
"I'm worried about you, you know." He pauses at the arm of the couch, his fingers flexing and digging into the arm of it. "I can tell when something's wrong. I'm not stupid, Sherlock." He waits for a moment, and when Sherlock does not respond, gently tugs his hand free from where it's clawing into the blanket. "You can tell me. Even if you think I can't help. Even if there really isn't anything I can do. You scare the hell out of me when you try and do things alone."
"You'll keep his name out of your mouth," he hissed. "If you know what's good for you."
but he didn't have to. It was the day at the tarmac all over again, with Sherlock opening his mouth and John so sure he was going to say it only for something else not quite it to come out, but-- John heard what he meant. He heard what he hadn't said. He felt it.
with a strained smile that was just barely this side of polite.
He cut himself off suddenly in a sharp intake of breath, pressing his mouth shut. It was as if he'd only just remembered there was an audience, and one that he didn't want to go on for.
"So," Lestrade says, as Sherlock continues through the album. It's painfully transparent. "I saw John the other day. He's moving back in, he said."
The door is shut with a sharp, angry rap.
But what he really wanted was for Sherlock to be happy. And the way to see that was not to put a premature end to the first time Sherlock had put himself out there in over a decade.
Isn't it obvious how much Sherlock hates this, even if he can't say it? This is not just about him.
Inspired by what appears to be a multifandom incorrect quote-
But there was still a limit. He still could not quite tempt John away from
Oh, progress had assuredly been made. This was not a defeat or a failed experiment, by any means!
"You still should've done something," he muttered, unable to help himself. "I know, it's Sherlock, he's more of a handful than anyone else in the world, but. He was eighteen, Mycroft."
"Come on," Oscar said, sitting back. "Oh, you're lucky this is happening with me, Sherlock. I'll be careful with you, I promise. Nothing that you don't want to do."
And he must say it.
he sighs.
He hadn't bothered to wait until the end to hand over the same manuscript he had given John. It'd be a waste of time, he'd determined, to not talk about the elephant stampeding right there in the middle of the room. And the one thing Sherlock is not here for is to waste time.
It's also, very clearly, taken just about everything he's had to get through it, and what happened to him in that house wore him out so badly he's not up for anything more than getting back to someplace that he can feel safe.
Sod it.
Good. Yes.
It was just a dream.
"I am here," the man said, with an agonising sort of slowness, "to speak to you, John." He drew closer, enunciating each word in a very precise way, like every syllable was the slam of a knife. "Because I would like to find out why
this was too hard.
There was silence again, just a bit more odd rustling from Sherlock, but no words followed this excessively odd proclamation. Mycroft glanced at John, frowning slightly, and moved to sit against the desk. "Sherlock, where are you?"
any of those things. Sherlock is anything and everything in the world that he wants to be, and that's the fucking problem.
"The year he graduated? Oh, he didn't graduate, Dr. Watson. Sherlock dropped out, didn't he tell you?"
John's footsteps were heavy and irritated, seventeen rhythmic thumps on the stairs that belied the wounded look on his face from before was not over. He came up to the door and slowed to a halt, just looking, just watching.
"We're going back upstairs," he says, "
John's mouth tightened, another awful feeling sinking in his stomach. He shook his head once, unwilling to say it, but then the words just came out anyway. "He doesn't... we haven't even talked about it, actually. But I know he doesn't blame anyone. It wasn't even a relapse, to him. He'll say it was all just for a case."
If there's anything at all that he's learned from this dreadful experience, it's that there are worse things than sentiment.
Sherlock looked silently back up at him, blue-green eyes meeting his through his lashes. He still did not move, clean-shaven and clear-eyed and so
His own set of nerves flipped around on its head, unhappy anxiety sent straight into a sullen grumble. What the hell was Mycroft doing here? "Sherlock's not here," he started, relaxing back into his chair. "If you want to give him a case or--"
It's not pleasant to hear, no. That Sherlock had hurt John so badly, John's marriage had been an attempt to excise Sherlock out of his life, role of the best man or no. But it is what it is.
Whatever bits of himself he'd been so desperately trying to cobble together before, fighting to just get out one single word, one name after five sickening months of silence-- he's not trying now.
"...Right." Lestrade hesitates, glancing up the stairs after to where Sherlock has disappeared. He clearly is unsure of what to say, the situation not one that exactly lends itself to easy explanation, and he chews on his pen. "So, he's still..."
He grits his teeth, and sweeps downstairs after the worst and best big brother the world has to offer.
He gasps in another breath. This one breaks into a silent whine and suddenly he blinks hard, wet tears spilling down one cheek. He can't stop whispering soundlessly, his mouth moving too fast for any intended words to make any sense, but he never makes even the tiniest whimper of a noise.
"Nothing
"I understand your point," he said finally, voice almost too low. "Intellectually, I mean. But... oh,
Sherlock is screaming.

Use your words, John, surely even you can manage that much?"
But he just kept his mouth shut. He grabbed the flannel from the table instead and started patting his face dry, obscuring his expression underneath the faded green cotton and remnants of shaving cream, and still glared down at the table rather than up at him.
and he wasn't. He never had been and he never would be. And if this was what it was, he didn't want to be.
This was the most awful he'd ever felt in his life. It was below rock bottom; there
"All right. Have you taken anything besides the alcohol?"
"You're going to ask me if I'm interested in a collaboration," he said flatly. "I'm afraid the answer is no."
He crouched closer, still, to where he was still sprawled on the pavement. He seemed to have decided staying down was his best chance at not getting hit a fifth time. And he stiffened, when John reached for him again, he flinched away, but all John did was re-grab him by the collar and haul him back up off the round to force him to look. He would look at John. He would meet his eyes. He

Even after finding out she was a bloody assassin, you still thought I'd be best off if I stayed with her- and I know you liked Mary, before, but that's not why, is it? It's not that you think Mary is all that great, after she bloody
A very big part of John wanted to call it quits, go straight back home, and drink himself to sleep. He wanted to do what he'd done on Sherlock's birthday-- hit the ground running with Sherlock's apparently unending capacity to forgive, sweep everything under the rug with it, and then keep running. Run away. Again.
It was clearly meant to be supportive, and encouragement. She was telling him that she had faith in him to do the right thing.
But John can at least give him this.

did not like it when Sherlock wound up with an injured transport.
ever since that visit to Cambridge. Continuing to talk about it now, insisting to John that he had had relationships before, that he was capable of it, that he was still capable of it.
He sighs, and for a moment wants to throw the tablet across the room. It'd almost be worth it, just to see the expensive thing smack and break against the wall. "Is this about the heroin?"
Sherlock made tea. He stood in the kitchen, with his back to John, and he made tea. He stood there with his back to him and he drank the whole thing. He drank it, and then he clattered the empty cup down to the counter, and he stood there with his back tense and his shoulders hunched and every inch of him radiating a low, thrumming energy that was almost electric. It was like the air itself was being turned to static, infected by the anxious anger overflowing out of Sherlock because all six foot two of him was too small to contain it.
2. Mary hurts Sherlock. Sherlock forgives Mary. John does not.
It reminds him of Lestrade, a little. What an increasingly irascible, anxious mess he'd been, in the last months of his marriage, but when the papers had finally been signed he'd just been relieved it was finally over.
One word.
"I needed to talk to you-- to say something-- about what happened in the morgue, Sherlock. About what I did."
In retrospect...
"I know that's how it normally is, but... this was not

"I--"
everyone," one says, to a round of distracted, disgruntled laughter. Sherlock finds himself propped up against the nearest streetlight, while John is again looking to be shoved into the street. "What a bunch of freaks."
Moriarty, there was a low intake of breath from across the room. John shifted in his chair, his voice low and tense, trying very hard to betray nothing.
John can't know yet.
It hit John all at once, what Sherlock was trying to say, and

even took that from him.
Sherlock wants to be touched. He only wants to be touched a very exact amount, in very exact ways. Before, he was an over-excited puppy, always preening to be scratched around the ears or pet, and now it's like he's metamorphosed into an overgrown, sulky cat. One that purrs delightedly when touched just the right way, but will snap and bite his hand off if it stays for too long.
John goes stock still.
He'd realised John did not intend to follow him after all.
and it was tedious, and there's nothing quite more devastating for a man's pride than being congratulated on being able to bend and flex to the same extent as any normal human being, but he did that, too. He did the exercises more religiously than John had done his own after Afghanistan. (Which was not actually saying much, because John had skived them off, upon learning he'd never be a surgeon again.) But he did them. John had to handhold, work, and bully him through it. But he did it.
John stared at him again, torn between confusion and a rising impatience of his own. "And how did you even know I had a date?" he asked, which was perhaps the stupidest line of questioning he could've decided on. "I only met her yesterday at Tesco's, none of this was planned-"
And feeling just about like the biggest idiot in the world.
John rolled his eyes, though he looked so incredibly fond throughout it, Sherlock could hardly bring himself to mind. "One of us needs to go home, you berk," he repeated. "To water Milgram. We've been here since this morning."
He let him go, and looked down at him on the ground-- writhing and pale and pulled back, bleeding from the mouth. Just like Sherlock had been.
Sherlock settled himself on the cold floor next to the lab table, so low down he'd just about made himself fit underneath it. He squirmed down as securely as he could, making a nest right there into the corner with his jacket and backpack and very, very sore face. Head still down, he swallowed what would've been one very painful yawn, and dove a hand into the lab fridge, digging down into the very bottom with a flannel to grab a carefully selected handful of ice.
Sherlock grumbles something in his throat; it doesn't even come out
John closed his eyes, his throat throbbing. So Mycroft had been right, then. "You were fifteen. He was what, thirty-five?"
"He shouldn't have had any more students to begin with. He should've been fired! He should've been fucking
"Harry didn't even remember what happened," John told him, smiling mirthlessly. "And I was twelve, yeah? I had no idea what queer meant, or what he'd caught Harry doing, or why it was supposed to be a bad thing. And it wasn't as if I had dear old dad as an option to ask.
"But," John pressed ahead, his eyes big and earnest and sincere. "In any case, Sherlock, there was one before Victor, and there were still plenty that he hurt after. Not sexually, but he still stole their data, and treated them like shit, and nearly or actually did ruin their careers. And, it'd be a little, or... a whole lot of work, but... I wanted to write an exposé. A chapter for each student, to properly credit their work. Maybe start properly authoring some of the publications under his name. It's one of the reasons Cambridge was so willing to work with me on Victor, actually," he added, his small smile turning satisfied, with a very slight but telling glint of danger. "They knew the book was coming, and decided maybe not to piss off the guy writing a tell-all of sexual abuse they let on under their watch."
John sets both mugs down with an earth-shattering and sudden clatter, so desperately loud that Sherlock can not help it. He flinches. He flinches and is sick to his stomach for it and shuts his mouth.
something he should have to fucking say.
Sherlock smiled again, very slightly. But it was tired, under the surface, very, very tired, and it fell as he ducked his face back against his hand, rubbing hard at the lines and wrinkle of pain in his brow. "I very much do not want to talk about this," he insisted again.
Sherlock rolls his eyes.
They are much odder than the ones from Lestrade. Sherlock scrolls and scrolls, past

"I'm not doing anything! What am I-"

of whispering to John from rooms away and in the middle of the night because he is so scared of this.
"John," Sherlock said again, somewhat urgently now. He really, really did not want to talk about this. "It's all right. It is. If you need to apologise, then-- I accept it without reservation. Of course I do." He sounded bewildered for a moment, as if he could hardly believe it himself. "We were both at our worst, so of course--"
Why are you asking me this?"
Sherlock is dressed very particularly for the outing. He is missing the trademark coat and hat, and has wriggled instead into the one pair of jeans that he owns, and a slightly itchy, grey jumper knitted for him by Mrs. Hudson. He doesn't want to be recognised today, by reporters or by anyone else, and looking like anything less than himself is as close to undercover as he can currently get.
He's played it longer than he's been able to talk (though, admittedly, this is because this is not the first time he has lost his voice. Laryngitis. Experiments. Redbeard. Et cetera). It is

He had quite a lot of questions that he wanted to ask her, actually. But once again, John held his tongue, and just kept on smiling.

It felt like he was grinding glass with his teeth.
Lucky sniffs dolefully at her owner, tail drooping. She looks up at Sherlock, and he allows her to lick his face one final time before rising to his feet, and accepting his medicine.
Realisation dawned. Realisation right in tandem with John, standing up beside the A&E bed to shoulder on his jacket.
But for some reason this simple sign seems to make John even more distressed and he shakes his head, suddenly earnest and very determined to get his point through. "No, it's

There is a couple at the reception desk, although 'couple' is perhaps phrasing it much too charitably. A young woman, about John's height and pressing a bloody towel to her forehead, chalk white or even a little green, one arm gripped about by who is certainly supposed to be her boyfriend. A hulking mountain of a man that's taller than Sherlock and not at all as thin, shouting at the poor girl at reception-- the one who'd tried to kiss John earlier today, as a matter of fact. Whatever lingering resentments he has towards her evaporate, because she looks like she's about to cry now, and for good reason. That man is definitely on something, and clearly has no reluctance whatsoever about hitting a woman.
They should've suffered much more.
He also really does not want to give John even more cause to be unhappy.
Sherlock sniffed into the cushions. "There was an emergency," he muttered, hunching even smaller.
John was acutely glad he'd put the tea cup down.
How much of what Sherlock had done was for that end goal?
, seemingly only to have his back to John. He'd known Sherlock wouldn't be happy to hear it, because it was everything that Sherlock would hate. It was being treated like there was something wrong with him. Something fragile, a broken piece, that needed protecting.
Tonight, Sherlock is draped over his shoulders and can't speak and has a weekly appointment with a therapist and John
John sighed. "Yes." There was no point in trying to hide it. Even in this state, even over the phone, Sherlock was clearly capable of this deduction. "We figured someone should let him know the next time he contacts you he'll get hung for it. And then Mycroft will expatriate him and deport the body to outer Mongolia."
But there's nothing else.
"Yes. You are going to listen to me. Do you think you can do that?"
Sherlock stayed balled up, and listened.
Sherlock is not exactly up to talking, so John has to watch him, waiting for the light to shift in his eyes. When it finally comes, it's like breaking the surface, oxygen after hours of dust and suffocation, and John beams.
Sherlock flits on about the room, pocket magnifier in one hand and phone in the other. Clearly, he has already made his plans: he's just not going to speak at all. He's just going to carry out his deductions all in his head, and only pass them on when finalised to their end conclusion. It makes for an uncomfortable silence for John, but the other officers and techs, when Sherlock does not immediately prance into the spotlight, just ignore him. It's been long enough that some of them are new, and don't know him; the ones that do might not know the reason for the silence, but are clearly only too relieved for it.
Sherlock has now had to eat his own words, about therapists being useless.

John gives him another look, one that tries to be unamused but fails at it rather spectacularly. "And what are we supposed to do if they show up, anyway? Have Angelo invite them in for a free glass of wine?"

They had resettled back in the kitchen, this time in adjacent chairs, and close enough to touch. Sherlock's long, elegant arm was flat along the table, his finger splayed, as if daring John to touch. Except it wasn't a dare, because John
"Go home," he agrees. "You'll have one hell of a headache, but you're not going to die. Of this, at least." He gives John a slight smile, and moves forward to give him a hand when he sees John being especially careful about standing up. "Though I'd recommend you stay at home for the rest of the week... especially if this sort of situation is common where you work."
He shrugs. "Yes. But it gave you the chance to show off, didn't it? And we both know that's what's most important."
Dr. Wilson--
John rolls up his trouser leg up without making Sherlock do it himself, very carefully running his hands around the ankle that is now swollen to almost twice the size its supposed to be, and turning colors that would be incredibly fascinating if they weren't on his own limb. John hisses in sympathy, and immediately changes his mind about touching it. "Yeah, you made the right decision not walking anywhere on this. Sorry, but we're going to want to get you down to A&E. It could just be a sprain, but hairline fractures can hide in there without an X-ray, and if you miss that you'll be very sorry later."
Sherlock flips another page, tracing a finger down the page soundlessly as he reads. He is, very transparently, pretending John does not exist.
It's just a few hours; I am absolutely sure that you'll live."

A posthumous degree, for the program that Victor had dropped out of nearly twenty years ago, for a man who had died of a drug overdose in a hovel.

with Rosie. I've barely even let you be there and you've still been amazing. I know you'd never do anything to hurt her." He closed his eyes again, trying to press out the memory of Sherlock's shaking voice on that horrible phone call. The muted fear underneath as he'd croaked that he couldn't lose either of them again. "I'm not naive, okay. I know... I know those cravings are always going to be there. And I know that someday something might happen, and you might slip. Setbacks happen, Sherlock. But as long as you keep trying, as long as you're serious about getting clean and staying clean, then neither of us are going anywhere."
Lestrade is on the floor behind him, one hand reached out to him while the other tries to reach for Sherlock but is frozen in midair; the stricken look on his face spells out exactly how little he knows what to do. Sherlock himself is tucked as far away from them all as he can get. It reminds John of that night in the hospital, the first time he'd woken up, and his only instinct had been to make himself as small as possible. To hide in the further corner and tuck himself into the tightest space.
"Quite." He sent a dark look back over his shoulder, red with exertion while John was left just sitting in his chair, utterly lost. "Knowing my brother, I'm sure he has been as dishonest to you about this as he could-- but if there is anything I have been able to rely on you to do, over these past several years, it is to hurt my baby brother. Did you perhaps finally tire, on your limited but still disastrous influence on his life? Did you finally decide to encourage him straight into the arms of the one person worse than yourself?"

Sherlock glowered, tapping his thumb faster and faster into a nearly unsustainable cadence, impatience growing in his chest.
," Sherlock snapped. Forcefully. Too forcefully. John wanted to tell him to stop, that he didn't have to go on, but Sherlock was already stampeding ahead and the words were too fast, like they were festering inside and he had to get them out. "He promised me he'd help me. He said that we'd do whatever we had to, for me to be okay. Then he got me drunk and fucked me. Then I woke up alone, and with his schedule of classes that he expected me to teach in my hand. He hadn't--" He blinked, and the hard glaze of anger was finally culled under an innocent, almost childlike confusion. Like he wasn't hurt by what had happened, but he didn't understand. He just didn't understand. "It was as if he didn't remember anything at all that we'd talked about just the night before. Except I
Sherlock grunted, his shoulders dragging down and his head low and his face just wrecked. "My internal organs have each been separately wrung out like a flannel, and then deposited into a blunder together by Mrs. Hudson. Eleven times." He covered his face, his next noise edging into an outright moan. "Oh my

"Believe it or not, your brother isn't the antichrist. Though he is still more annoying than you." He folds his hands closer around the mug and frowns at the chess set himself, looking worn. "I don't really know why he came over, to be honest. I think he's just... worried about you."
and knows that everything is not okay. "Do you think we should stop by a cake place, after? Does he like cake?"
"Damn it, Sherlock, you're ready to drop-- tell me what's wrong! No--" The detective starts to slip again and this time John catches him, sitting him back upright with firm hands to the shoulders. "I need you to give me
His hands went cold.
Which makes it all the more baffling to John, that Sherlock has willingly jumped at the opportunity to force himself into a crime scene.
He swallows, his throat moving visibly, and his next words come out thick. "For a genius you're quite possibly the biggest idiot I've ever met but

It is still his unparalleled brilliance, the gears turning whether he wants them to or not. His mind always works terribly fast, and sometimes it works so fast he can't keep up. Sometimes there's something left over at the end of the day that his mind hasn't let go of, and sometimes it'll spit it at him in the middle of the night.

But the right words were lost underneath the fuzziness in his head and he had no idea what he was meant to say. "You don't need to-"
His last stop of the day, instead, was downstairs, a very brief visit in on Dr. Adriana Smith, a lecturer on organic chemistry and researcher into pharmacology, and only employed by Cambridge for the last ten years. Her time at Cambridge didn't come close to overlapping with Sherlock's, so for once, he was able to go down to her office without a building knot of trepidation or a wary sense of protective dislike. John quickly got her statement on the deceased-- he was, after all, at least

Sherlock sniffs again, obviously unimpressed.
Sherlock stares back at him, his eyes hard and glassy. He looks like he's teetering on an edge, hanging by just his fingertips and not sure of which way he's about to fall. A broken edge to him softens, somehow, the look on his face wobbling to reveal the smallest of cracks.
There's other noises from behind him then, Lestrade taking the officer and bringing him roughly down the stairs, his voice rising, angry voices and shouting. John blocks it all out without a second thought.
Sherlock is a cross between incredulous and fuming, and his hands fly now, the keyboard clicks suddenly deafening.

"Look, it's probably not anything important." He tried for a grin in John's direction. It was about as transparent as everything else. "I don't think--"
Oscar kissed him again, even quicker than before, and then pulled back with a quick caress of his bruised cheek. He headed back for the door with one last affectionate nod back over his shoulder, looking utterly and completely content. "I'll get that syllabus to you for my class, Sherlock. See you tomorrow!"
And--

Sherlock has a suspicion that Molly is one of the people who's actually a little bit relieved, that he's lost his voice. She'd never say so, of course. She'd never even dream of saying such a thing aloud, and probably feels horrible just to even think it. But he can deduce it on her, and what's more, he can't exactly blame her. It's probably much easier for her to deal with him when he's not critiquing her technique, staring over her shoulder, and demanding information much faster than she's able to provide it. He'd probably prefer himself with his mouth shut, too.
But now, when he was

It's also the first time he's played his violin in over a year.
"It's... complicated. Sexuality is complicated." Sherlock stared at him, and then down at his hands, like he was witnessing some sort of marvel. "I deduced that there had been men. But a sexual attraction isn't the same thing as being willing to establish an emotional connection. And my own deductions regarding peoples' personal feelings and intentions towards me have never been sound; researcher bias, inability to be impartial. I..." he swallowed again, this time like a fine shiver, running through him from head to toe. "I think I would... like to..."
"Six weeks."
"That's very nice. This was 1999, and she was speaking to me as a family friend, not as a physician." Mycroft sighed deeply, setting his own tea down. "Sherlock, of course, refused to speak to me about it, and I deemed it to be a non-emergency. If he needed assistance, he knew where to find me."

John closes his eyes, and counts to five.
"...Right, then," he announces, clearing his throat. "Off we go?"
Mycroft moves to the kitchen instead, his back still to Sherlock. His hand passes over where the bag of flour sits, hidden away in the cabinet, lingers for a moment, then moves to the kettle instead. "Yes, I know. Sentiment is a defect in the losing side, Sherlock. I'm well aware, brother mine... that does not make voluntary. As you very well know."

detail that there is, and John kisses him and kisses him like he's never going to let him up again. Sherlock is absolutely okay with this.
Sherlock stares down at him with eyes that drive the breath from him. Voice or not, Sherlock Holmes' face is one of the most expressive in the world, and his eyes are daring and powerful and pierce straight through him all the way down to his heart.
"And, what?" John drew a little closer again, just close enough to squeeze his hand. "What is it?"
"Chinese," Sherlock corrected mildly. He closed his eyes again, resquirming himself deeper into the sofa. "Do try to keep up, John, that

, and John is so overjoyed and relived and grateful he could burst. But on the other, Mycroft is also the reason that Sherlock is panting in the corner as he shakes and whines in his throat and tears his hair out, and that means it's time for him to go.
"Listen, Sherlock--" He swallows again, reaching for his arm. His arm that is bandaged and hurt, too, but it is safer than his hands, which just have no safe place to touch. "I'm sorry I let it get this--"
The data he'd found so far was surprisingly good. A few holes, here and there, but much higher quality than he'd expected, from the exhausted idiot that had shepherded him around last spring. He didn't know why he'd been so disliked, really; the data was higher quality than a lot of what he'd turned up around here.
No. He shouldn't have been drinking, barely a few days after stomach surgery. He shouldn't have been there at all. He should've been home, somewhere safe, with someone to look after him, instead of trying to make his case that he deserved to be treated with respect to this
Sherlock moves around the crime scene looking
to say what's wrong, and nobody can hear him.
"Jesus," he moaned. "Sherlock--"
And in retrospect--
"Stay
He finds his voice again. But as he is slowly beginning to understand, that is not the same thing as finding his words.
Sherlock lingers at the back of the group, smoking irritably against the wall as they all bicker amongst themselves, stupidly picking out the least-stupid way of approaching their suspect. Sherlock has several foolproof ideas, each assuredly less stupid than the ones being passed back and forth between John, Lestrade, and the others, but Donovan is not there, so nobody's asked him. Donovan doesn't tend to listen to his opinions on such questions anyway. She only barely, and with much begrudging, listens to his insights on crime scenes. She has no respect for his opinions on police procedure or protocol.
"Sherlock?" John prodded, just long enough into it that they had found a rhythm. "You now have my permission to use Milgram to get me out of any GP conference that you like in the future."
"You're going to see Oscar."
Mycroft is still in the corridor, of course. Just far enough down that he sits near the lift rather than the ICU itself, his phone out as he taps away. Probably ordering the military itself out to go track down who's done this to Sherlock.
"Oh. Okay," John murmurs, shrugging. He balls tighter under the duvet, now barely visible at all save for the warm flush in his cheeks and the overbright glimmer of his eyes. "You've got a case? I'll be fine, Sherlock. Got plenty of tea." He nods to the cup on the bedside table, his smile slight but genuine around the edge of the blanket. "Stay safe."
Sherlock keeps his mouth shut, giving John the dull, unseeing nod that he needs. And John lingers still for a moment longer, his hand catching in his damp hair and his eyes full of so much worry it weighs in his chest like lead.
John is not ready, however, for the non-sequitur that comes next.
He opens the door.
His throat
And then
Mycroft looked pointedly at John.
But he eats. He tries. He eats at least twice a day. Rarely a full meal, and certainly never a balanced one, but he tries, damn it, and that's enough for John to be proud of him. Whether the reason for the change is a healthy one or not.
He's not. He's obviously fucking not. "We're going home." For once, John is glad that Sherlock can't speak-- there is no room here for argument. "Sorry about the case. Greg, you think you can give us a ride?"
Sherlock alternately works his fork through a slice of red velvet and plays with his pen, while John takes a very, very long time with a glass of wine. They still bring his legal pad along, because while John's competency has been improving, his vocabulary is still woefully inept for the level of things Sherlock wants to say. It's all right. He doesn't intend to need this safety net for all that much longer.
this'll work."
not that perhaps this isn't about Mycroft at all. Not entirely. Mycroft is the catalyst that caused this breakdown, but there is so much else that has led to this moment. John's growing helplessness and frustration, sentiments that Sherlock
he realises dully,
Ella held her hands up in slight surrender, acquiescing to John just like that. "Let's put fault aside for a moment, then. We don't need to talk about who I think was right or wrong. But, at the very least, I am concerned about Sherlock. You said so yourself that this is his third serious relapse in less than a year. That doesn't sound like something that you're doing-- that sounds like he has underlying issues of his own." She paused again, her frown deepening. "I'm also concerned that his sense of self-worth is so heavily contingent upon you. You could make or break him with one word, John. That's not healthy."
"Do you think you're going to be sick?"
Sherlock is still panting, off in the corner, making those awful, tiny
It takes the first few moments for it to slide from crying to sobbing. But it's not sobbing so much as great, shuddering gasps, and it's not so much gasps as it is high-pitched wheezes that border on hyperventilation. He reels back and forth on trembling legs and suddenly isn't hiding his face because he has to press a hand to his chest instead, fighting for each breath and then fighting even harder for the next.
And that's it. It's over.
"Oh, don't look like that, Sherlock," he chided, and patted his arm again. "It's all right. I wouldn't do this with just anyone, you know? I told you-- you're special."
That's hardly what he does now, even. He lets Sherlock take the lead but he's always stroking his hair, cradling his arse, desperately, almost violently kissing back. There are so many little
John smirked again and kept silent, instead putting on the kettle for tea. It'd help settle Sherlock's stomach, as well as just giving him something to do, both of which would be sorely appreciated. Because despite having all this time to prepare, he still wasn't quite sure how to start. Should he tell Sherlock he'd done the right thing last night, in calling them for help? Should he tell Sherlock that he wasn't angry with him, for drinking? That Oscar had been
"It's not your fault, Greg. Although maybe you should update your passwords." John pauses, chewing on the inside of his cheek. "We both know if Sherlock wants in on a case, he finds a way."
he was afraid.
His face is utterly exhausted.
The scary thing was, he'd seen Sherlock hurt, before.
. You'd
gains traction?" He frowned again, lowering the diploma to his lap. "What do you mean? What story?"
'nd I hate
Okay, so the whiskey had definitely been a bad idea. Maybe all of this had been a bad idea. "All right, let's just... just take a breath, Sherlock. Calm down, okay? It's only one date." Now definitely not amused in any way, shape, or form, John got back to his feet, moving around to gently rub his back. Sherlock flinched a little at the first touch but did not throw him off, so he kept doing it, gingerly circling the tense, locked shoulders, willing him to take a breath. "Seriously, it's just a few hours at a nice restaurant. What's the worst that can happen?"
Oscar flattered him, first. Careful compliments, designed to make him feel important and special; telling him how wonderful he was, how unique, how
Sherlock gives him back a wicked smile, his eyes bright and leering, and John only knows to smile right back.
"...Okay," Sherlock mumbled. He sounded dazed, his tongue thick and the word slow.
Sherlock ruins John's proposal with terrible French and an even worse mustache. He recognises Mary for who she is with the box of the ring still in her hand, and he tells John and swabs an eraser through Mary right then and there. He sees John is about to propose and he realises he ruined John's life and he stays away. He turns around and walks away and stays away. He never goes to the restaurant at all. He dies in Serbia and stays dead.
He doesn't want to.
Of course he is. John is a good man and a good doctor. He won't abandon his gunshot best friend while he's still in hospital; of course not, no. That's not how this is going to go. John isn't capable of that any more than he's capable of leaving his pregnant wife.
"Yes."
"What's the difference?"
Sherlock smiled slightly again, ducking his head. "Perhaps." He pulled his hands apart to touch John's again, pulling it closer so he could see the state of his knuckles. Red, scraped, and bruised. Not enough, in John's mind. Not remotely enough. "It ruptured his fantasy, I think. It was the turning point that happened with every student of his before-- the moment when they stopped being able to meet his expectations, and he realised his special star was about to let him down. It was what happened to Victor. I'd just been conceited enough to think I was special enough that it wouldn't happen to me."
John sat in his own chair. His own chair, that was still right here. The armchair that had been set right here, impeding the path to the kitchen, from the day that Mary had shot a coin in a dark and abandoned house while Sherlock bled out for the second time in a week across from her.
It took another moment. Of Sherlock's horribly uncharacteristic stammering, his words low and stilted and John never wanted to hear him sound like that again. But then, what Sherlock was trying to tell him clicked, and John heard the core of what was underneath the fumbling words, and what it was that he could not say.
. I wouldn't call him Greg. I kept being as awful to him as I could, I thought-- I just wanted him to get it over with and stop being
Sherlock tried to swallow again, to force the wave down, but feeling his throat move against Oscar's mouth made him feel even worse.
It doesn't quite come out, the words still jumbled in his throat, but he's too high on his victory to care. He inhales John again, every
"But. I thought." He sat up straighter, gaping across the room. "You and Irene-- and
"Don't you have somewhere you need to be, Victor?"
"...Sherlock?"
Sherlock takes in a long, deep breath, shutting his eyes to gather his wits back around him. He sits there on the edge of the bed, looking to be a complete mess and his composure in shreds, but he draws himself up and breathes, and just like that, he stops shaking.
It's the same terrifying, hollow sensation that had possessed him in that miserable house of his first return to a crime scene, all those months ago. Perhaps the greatest humiliation of his life. Certainly the greatest one of this past year. It's like he's been kicked out of his body, an emergency reflex as warning and alarm lights switch on and the doors are bolted shut without his permission, screeching in his head as he flees down into the only safety he has left. It's a feeling that picks him up, forcibly evicts him. and throws him to the very bottom of the palace, where he crumbles at the foot of the very longest staircase in a heap of shattered limbs and a cracked skull and bleeding bone fragments, and it
It is a map. Of the grocery store. For him. Because Sherlock could just as easily find the required items by mutely pointing at them on the list and dragging a cashier about the store with him, but that requires
"Sometimes, you need to. Sherlock, the other day, you said that Mary... conferred a value onto your life, or something like that, when she saved it, and-- no." It was hard to swallow, but he still forced himself to meet Sherlock's eyes or at least watch his face, because this was
There's more. He knows there's more. Mycroft Holmes is not a considerate person, and he has certainly
He's ready, resigned, and waiting.
Sherlock is bored, of course. Sherlock is bored, and restless, and twitchy, and growing even more bored and restless and twitchy by the day. It was doable, when his body was still broken, and no matter how twitchy he was he could barely make it down the stairs without John's help. It stopped being doable, when the final cast and restriction came off, and John was handed back one very stiff, very sore, very quiet boyfriend, who was so desperate for something to do that he insisted upon walking the two miles home.
He thinks he'd rather like to have the Tesco's map framed. Flattened and pinned preciously in careful glass, and hung next to his periodic table and judo certificate. Maybe if John signed it, with the date-- a permanent stamp and recollection of everything that this year has been, and everything that John has done for him, and everything that Sherlock is determined to never need again.
Stitches turn into scars. Scars join his growing collection. The deep, driving agony begins to soften, joining the pain in his back and joints from his two years away and two months spent bleeding in a Serbian hole.
Somewhat unsurprisingly, Sherlock's only answer is to roll his bright blue eyes. He's not taking it seriously, because he doesn't take nearly

John was gossiping about him to Mycroft behind his back.
John was the one to save him.
Those weren't good thoughts to think while in a therapy session.
not without evidence. Not--"
"That's not how it was! Sherlock wasn't, he--" This was not going to happen. No. He could not sit here and listen to this become
He knows something's wrong. Maybe not what, exactly. But Sherlock knows something is wrong, and it has nothing at all to do with the blow to the head.
Third try.
"...Sherlock?"
And then, just a few hours ago today, John had all but grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and thrown him out of the flat. Sherlock had told John in every way that he could that he hadn't wanted to go. He'd told him that he felt sick. He'd told him that he thought he was going to throw up. He'd stood there at the door and needed to be all but pushed outside, and John hadn't realised. John had never realised something was wrong.
At 12:36, the kraken stirred.
"Okay," he said.
Sherlock passes the needle back and forth, his tongue swollen and his throat dry and itchy, crawling out of his skin right there in his seat. He hasn't even used yet and already he's hot and almost shivering and
John sits opposite in His Chair. He sits there, and he looks back at Sherlock, and he waits.
The sound of footsteps comes just soon enough that he knows Mycroft must have agreed to send a car. The footsteps are only John's, which is unsurprising; Mycroft doesn't do legwork, and he especially doesn't do it when there's ice on the ground and it's just starting to snow. He also certainly wouldn't do legwork with John, at the moment. Not when John is most likely to lead him into the nearest skip and conveniently trip him into it.
He's been frustrated for days. Even unable to say so, Sherlock has clearly been increasingly upset and frustrated. At the hospital staff, for being too stupid and slow-minded to pick up on his silent wishes. At Mycroft, for existing in general. At himself, for being unable to speak.
Today is the first day Sherlock has actually communicated in anything beyond a nod, or a shake of his head, or a heavy sigh, or a roll of his eyes. Those signs to Mycroft-- John hadn't realised it at the time, but those few signs were the first words he's said. And what he writes now are the first words that he's written.
"That's...
for him, and if John asked him to see a therapist... he'd do it.
"That's not-- he's... it's not that simple, Mycroft! It's his decision to make! And not--" John can barely find the words, caught between his own anger and his own hurt and the impossibility at discussing this in front of Sherlock. "You're asking him about
but before his very eyes, he watched as Sherlock withdrew back until he was so far away behind his defenses that he might as well have been across the city, for all that John could reach him.
His stomach goes hollow and empty. It feels like he's imploding from the inside out, a crushing emptiness opened inside him that just
"I'm not letting you in on this case. How'd you even know I had a case? No, that's rhetorical, Sherlock, I don't want to know.
Sherlock grumbled something, his voice edging just on incoherent, then just moaned. "Snogged him. Thn told him he was a terrible scientist and d'sgusting excuse fr a human being. Then I spat in his soup. Then I left."
even was. "He's just been really quiet the past few days and I think it's more than just Sherlock being Sherlock, you know? He's meeting one of his old professors for drinks in a few days and maybe he's a bit nervous about it, I don't know." Or maybe that was John and a bloody inferiority complex. "The one who won a Nobel Prize and all, because of course Sherlock knows someone who's won a Nobel Prize..."
"Yes. I know. That's why I got it. Perfect for London children, born and raised and forced to a Chinese restaurant by their parents, and hospital patients three days off a feeding tube. We'll give a better order a try in a few days." John smiles again, pressing the styrofoam container into his hands, enfolding his fingers around Sherlock's. It's only to ensure he doesn't drop the damn thing, but he touches and holds his hands without even a hint of discomfort, and it's- it's perfect. It's electrifying. It's
Character C: it's not that big a deal-
"Is that what happened to Sherlock?" John started, grinding his teeth. "He told me he had no respect for Dr. Wilson's science; is that why?"
Which is horrible for John, yes, but the part that really worries him, is how horrible it must be for Sherlock.
He'd messed this up so bad. It was too broken to ever be fixed, god, he'd done so
But Sherlock seemed to be put on edge even worse than before, his voice rising and he still couldn't face him, he
John smirked. The look on his face was lovely enough to be unfair, and made even worse by the fact that John really did not seem to have the slightest sense of pity for him
...Oh.
John didn't know what he was supposed to do.
He ambled back to Sherlock's side after a few minutes, two cups of tea in hand and frozen peas over one arm. Sherlock still had not moved. "Here you go," he said, sitting across from him and nodding to his face. Sherlock had a split lip, and knowing him, it was a fifty fifty chance between walking into someone's fist, and walking into a door. "Let's just--"
"You think this man abused Sherlock?"
"...Sorry," John finally forced out, unfurling his fist finger by finger. He stared hard across the room, trying to control his breathing. It didn't go very well. "Continue."
to have this conversation, but... maybe Sherlock wasn't ready to have it.
He molds himself around a limp pillow on his other side, and goes back to sleep.
"And even if she wasn't," Sherlock snapped, "because it somehow seems to have escaped your impeccable powers of observation despite it being so obvious that even
Ella was right. This was the third time Sherlock had used in a year and no matter how much John wanted to blame himself, no matter how much it
John tries again. "No? Nothing? Come on, don't be like this. I know you can see it. Or are you annoyed because I didn't commit a murder for you to solve?"
Well, it was true.
and John couldn't have loved him more. He doesn't look at John but stares at his brother, and his musician's hands flutter, moving through motions too fast for John to ever have a hope of keeping up.
Sherlock waits until he steps out of the room for five damn minutes to open his eyes for real.
"Why don't you try the blue one?" He tried not to look too closely at the lean line of Sherlock's back, or at the closet beyond it. It hardly mattered. Sherlock looked amazing in just about everything that he owned, and just about everything that he owned looked like he'd lifted it off a magazine cover.
At the other end of the corridor, Sherlock was still waiting for the lift again, and speaking with the other professor. John was on edge again immediately, starting to pick up the pace, but at least he did not seem hostile with this man-- far from it. In fact, as John watched, Sherlock accepted his outstretched hand for a handshake and even smiled a little, and the other man passed a business card into Sherlock's grip.
aphasia. John is more sure of it by the day. Sherlock is not simply unable to express language. He remains unwilling to try, and he has refused to try it ever since the first day that he woke up. He won't so much as open his mouth, and he won't pick up the pen or paper when it's offered, and he refuses to even try to find a way to express what is wrong.
He wants to be more than this.
meant. He looked away, his throat jumping and the line of his mouth gone even flatter. "Are you intentionally being difficult? I know my own name, John!"
"Of course I do." He wets his lips again, struggling to swallow. "I told you to move back in, didn't I?"
What, pray tell, is the
Now, if there is ever to be a moment...
, J'hn, I..." He sighed, and shifted loudly, his clothes rustling over the line. "I snogged him."
why isn't he waking up. "Sherlock?" He touches his face, the red scrape at being thrown to the floor, but it's only that, a scrape. His wild hair isn't hiding anything, either; he's not finding any lumps or bruises that could answer where he's gone. "Sherlock,
Sherlock's breaths continue to be hard-fought and desperate, each one torn from deep, deep in his chest. His wild hair spills over his eyes and stands up on end, and he wrenches a hand upwards to yank his nails through it, pushing it back and out of the way.
"Okay," he says, finally, when Sherlock has at last made it apparent that he is not going to have another breakdown. He is lax and limp and tired on his side, though it's only early evening still. He honestly could go to sleep. He wants to crawl back into a deep, dark hole in the palace and go to sleep and not come out for a week. "I'll... I'll be just out in the kitchen. If you need something. Okay?" He slides Sherlock's mobile into his hand and folds his fingers around it, patting them shut one by one. "Text me if you need or want anything. Anything at all, Sherlock."
Time for a break, he decided. Sherlock had done good enough.
Mary watching you now..."
Because the Holmes that stood in the doorway was not Sherlock.
Mary had shot him in the chest, nearly killed him, and then taken a bullet for him. John's wife. Rosie's
Sherlock blinked.
And John is a wonderful man, but John is also a very particular man. John does not proclaim these judgments to be wrong; John says that he loves him in spite of them, because of everything else that Sherlock

"Right, that's, uh- good to know. Thanks for that." Lestrade hesitated again by the door, rubbing at his eyes with one hand. He looked ready to drop and not entirely sure what to say. "I'll be off, then. Try and get some sleep, the both of you. And for

Mycroft tilts his head, his pale eyes searching between the two of them as bugs pinned under sheets of glass. Sherlock starts to gesture furiously, his hands shaking and his fingers tearing through the required motions like lightning, but Mycroft only rolls his eyes, interrupting before Sherlock's even halfway through whatever he wants to say. "Brother mine, you are being ridiculous. We both know I can get the papers signed, whether you fit the criteria or not."
and Sherlock was most adept at both. He was not adept at human sentiment, or he was most certainly not adept at making anyone happy.
"Bollocks," John mumbled, through an almost goofy smile. "Sure hope that wasn't a mistake."
Sherlock bears down, grasping himself closer to John's hips. He scratches a ragged check mark into his side, nodding awkwardly, and.John shudders and whimpers again. He comes into Sherlock's mouth, again hot and salty and so very, very

He also looked absolutely unsurprised, but he supposed this was to be expected-- he'd probably figured him out by the sound of his footsteps alone. "You're here."
It must show on his face,

. Of course he's not slowing down. Sherlock must have a thousand deductions built up behind the dam, he must know everything about those two men from a glance at the files alone. He must have everything Mycroft could possibly want to know, just bouncing around in his brilliant head, and now after six weeks it's finally coming out.
It is as if John has been holding his breath, for a very, very, very long time. For so long that he has forgotten how to breathe at all, and right there, sitting there on the floor together, Sherlock's face blotchy and wet and John's heart cracked in his chest, he has finally let it go.

The man simply raises a hand in farewell. He clearly has no eagerness to stay. "Best of luck, John," he says, only to pause again, foot halfway out the door. "You'll need it. Sherlock likely has a very good idea what we've been discussing down here for so long, and I can guarantee he will not be appreciative."
"Sir," she starts, her eyes passing over Sherlock in very obvious discomfort. She seems to want to be here even less than he does. "They're asking what to do downstairs. They need to know what to do with the body."

to get out of here, where Molly is staring at him with shocked, pitying eyes, and holding his hand, and taking his pulse because he probably looks like he's having a bloody heart attack. He wants to be alone, in a very deep, dark pit, with the blankets over his head to ride out the oncoming panic where no one can see.
Another moment of silence. Sherlock did, indeed, hold perfectly still. He kept his eyes closed, this time, long lashes against his damp, now clean cheek.
It was a shame. Because John very much wanted to.
Absolutely

They get to A&E. Mycroft is, most curiously, not present. John tells him that he'd threatened to snog the living daylights out of Sherlock for the entire drive if Mycroft had insisted upon staying, which is easily the most romantic thing he's said all day. He's diagnosed with a bad sprain and given a hateful walking boot, to which John promises to make it worth his while if he leaves it on and agrees to call for Chinese on the way home.
don't do that, it's okay. You're okay. Just take another deep breath, all right? Deep breath, come on, love, with me. Sweetheart.
The same can be said for Sherlock. And look at where he is now.
And as Sherlock stands there, seething only to himself-- he sees it.
There wasn't any lower to get. Rock bottom was somewhere on the floor of that fucking morgue. This was beneath it. This was even lower than that and John hated himself more than he had the words to express.
"Deal," the genius rumbled, and pulled upwards out of John's arms.
Which raised the question--
Before, he'd looked at John, and seen him exhausted, shaken, and miserable, kipping in a hospital bed and living off of takeout and tea, and it hd been okay. It had been good, because John was
They'd only gotten into this mess by refusing to actually sit down have a bloody conversation. John was not keen on repeating the mistakes that had led them here.
Oscar made a small, disparaging noise, the corner of his mouth tight. With his lip still swelling and bleeding, it didn't come out looking all as confident as he probably wanted it to. "As if I would want to," he murmured, which was probably the stupidest, most ill-advised statement anybody had ever said in the history of recorded time. "As I recall, Sherlock was the one who called me."
"I don't like him," he said again, clenching his jaw hard. "That's it."
"I'm sure Milgram will be thrilled," he said, and handed John his now tragically empty cup. "Now go raid the fridge for me- I've a suspicion that what we're looking for is masquerading as a milk carton. And then get us some more tea."
Sherlock looks, and there he is. Curled up loosely in the bed adjacent, the blankets mussed and his mobile under one hand. It's hours into the night, leaving his shirt a wrinkled ruin and his hair a wreck and his face creased from being pressed into the abomination of a pillow. He looks like a doctor. He looks like a wonderful, amazing, dependable friend. He looks like bone-tired, sleeping in a button-down and his belt only half-way undone, his mouth slack and almost drooling for the almost empty coffee resting on the bedside table.
