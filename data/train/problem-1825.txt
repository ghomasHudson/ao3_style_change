“Oh…” Rosie responded before taking a bite of a biscuit.  “Do you want babies, daddy?”
--TBC
“It is merely an endearment you say while we shag… Or do you…?”
“No…” I denied.
“Hello!” Molly called from the open front door of the flat.  “Anyone in?”
Sherlock reached out and turned back on the light.
I bit my lips, remembering the way he used my mouth the day before.  I wanted him desperately.  I wanted to give him comfort and please him… But the sensation of his penis hitting the back of my throat almost made me gag.  Research into oral sex revealed that I would have better results if I used my fist to control the amount I allowed into my mouth.
“These are the Mists of Time.  They separate the mortal world from the Fairy Realm.”  Sherlock answered.  “We have to pass through to reach my world.”  Sherlock took John’s hand and tugged at him.  The soldier followed.
Sherlock shook his head.  “It’s not important.”
Sherlock kissed his forehead.  “He could have killed you.”
“Sherlock…”
Sherlock held him tightly with his arms and legs.  “John…”
“Would you like to come to London with me?”
“What the hell are you doing?”  John demanded.
John pulled off the still soft prick and looked up at Sherlock.  “You could be… with a little more attention…”
Sherlock reached for the gag.
“I know how you feel about marriage.  That it’s just a piece of paper to formalize…” John lost his words for a moment.  Licking his lips, he started again.  “Rosie already calls you daddy.  You can legally be her stepfather.”
“A house?”  Sherlock echoed as he climbed onto the rock to lounge beside his husband.  “What sort of house?”
Sherlock smiled a radiant smile.  “Do you think I’ll mesmerize our killer?”
--TBC
“The Mists of Time are filled with many memories.”  Sherlock answered.  “That was when she took me.  Nanny fell asleep.”  The faun indicated the woman sleeping under the tree, completely oblivious to the fact that her charge was missing.
“I wanted a mate.  That does not mean the mate I chose wants me.”  Sherlock replied and shifted his legs so he could push John off of him.  “You will be forced to bring someone here and turn them Fae.”
“Anything you need, John.  Anything.” I whispered, unsure if the man I held would resort to more violence.  But I was ready for that.  I could take another beating.
“Sherlock… I wasn’t expecting that… From you.”
“A little bird told me that have graduated from blow jobs to buggering.”
“You woke me up for that?”
“And if I say no, then what?  You’ll leave?”  Sherlock challenged.
“Nonexistent.”
John trembled at the sensation and leaned in deepen the kiss.
John obeyed, lingering at the back of the room.  The bar was full.  It was a different bar than the one he first met Sherlock.  Many drag queens performed.  The man they were looking for often came on drag queen night.  John lingered by the bar, hoping to spot someone suspicious.
“I’ll kill him…” John whispered and made a move to follow.
The intensity of emotion in John’s eyes made Sherlock shiver for a moment.  Gently he reached out and touched John’s face, confused at the reaction his body had to John’s statement.  Glancing down he saw he was getting hard.  “I…”
(See the end of the chapter for
“But… Who would want me like this?”  John whimpered, reaching down to tap at his huge genitals.
“I will never marry the Woman… Any woman.  No women!”  The cab had pulled up outside of 221 Baker Street and Sherlock hastily departed, throwing some notes at the cabbie.
“That’s it?”  John asked, asked still closed.
“Hello.”  John replied, trying not to notice the way a long, dark curl rested perfectly around her left nipple.  “Um…”  His eyes fell to her feet and that’s when he noticed that she was floating several inches off the ground.  “Are you floating?”
John shuffled forward aiming his erection to slide into me.  It went easily and soon enough I was full of Alpha for the very first time in my waking memory.  You see… I have never shared a heat with an Alpha before.  When I first presented I was given suppressants and toys to simulate an Alpha’s knot.  Of course John must have entered me to treat my estrus poisoning, but I had no memory of it.  This was my first time with an Alpha inside of me.  I found myself to be emotional at the experience.  The way his body moved as he sought to fill me completely.  The way my hands slid down his sweaty back as he strained.  My body accepting his length and girth as if he was a missing piece of myself, returned to me.  I closed my eyes and concentrated on the sensations of my Alpha taking me, claiming me… Breeding me for the first and only time.  I started to cry.
I leaned in and lightly pressed my lips to his.  I could feel his breath fan across the lower part of my face as I opened my mouth and licked his bottom lip.  I wanted him.  I wanted to consume him… Offer myself to him.
“No, it’s not.” John answered.  “First I blamed you even though Greg told me you were the one with the gun aimed at you.  Mary got in the way.  Then I beat you to the point of putting you in the hospital.  And then… Then I force you into a sexual relationship.”
There was no way she knew what difficulty meant unless she too went into heat and was abandoned in the middle of it.  “You don’t know…”
Sherlock nodded.  “Ok.”
John twisted his left hand out of my grasp and used it to reach down between us.  I released his other hand and he immediately used it along with the other to undo my trousers.  John’s trousers were already open so I leaned to the side to help him push them down his thighs.  It took some coordination but we managed to undress each other in under a minute.
“And you have valor.”  Sherlock breathed.
Sherlock stared back at the werewolf, disturbed at the ease that John figured him out.  “I could be an alpha…”
“No.” I admitted.
Sherlock’s eyes took in details of the room.  Obviously the large mirror was a one way mirror for someone on the other side to observe them.  There was a drain in the middle of the floor for liquids and quick cleaning.  Along the wall was a tap with a threaded faucet for a hose.  “What about that?”  Sherlock pointed to it.
“I’m alone here.”
Sherlock pulled the hand towards his mouth and sucked on John’s index and middle finger.
“I tripped over an unconscious naked man in the woods… what was I supposed to do?” Sherlock asked.
“Because I’m a man?”
“Remember that when it’s the full moon and he has his knot stuck in your arse.”
“You are very beautiful.”  John sighed and smiled at her.  “I would be honored to marry a lady of your beauty.”
“Companionship?” John offered.
From the moment Rosie entered the world her father was mesmerized by her.  How could such a sweet bundle of warmth be his?  When she wasn’t feeding or being cared for, she spent time with her father and her king… For King William was never far away.
“What are you doing?”  John asked with interest as Sherlock plucked another flower from him to add to the contents of his hand.  It was making a sort of paste.
The sound of sirens became louder as they approached the scene.
John rolled his eyes with a sigh and then got down in the tub, situating himself near the drain.  “This isn’t very practical.”
Sherlock shrugged.  “I established this morning that I am not desirable.”
“Werewolf…”  Lestrade stated as if John had grown a second head.
“You’ll bring him around.” Mary smiled at John and jumped back into the water, waiting for Molly to pull on her coat so they could swim away together.
“Your highness…”
As John got up from the bed he pulled his trousers back on and regretted ever allowing Sherlock to continue his sex slave charade.
“What are we doing out here?” John asked, curious.
“And he doesn’t seem to mind.  She’s got him wrapped around her finger.”
Sherlock continued to stare at him.  It was much like the reaction he had when asked to be a best man.
“Come away human child.” Irene commanded.
John pulled on his trousers.  “If you must.”
“What about Rosie?”
At that moment Lestrade returned.
“Just John?”
John straddled the human and sat down, impaling himself on Sherlock’s cock.  Squeezing it a moment with his internal muscles that made Sherlock’s toes curl he began a familiar rhythm seen in the video.
Epilogue
“Rosie calls Sherlock her ‘da.’  I’m ‘daddy’ and ‘father.’” John supplied.
“Yes.  I was there.  It’s the only tourney you competed in… Even though there have been other tournaments since.  I hoped I would see you compete again… But you never did.”
“By smell.”  Sherlock pointed at John.  “You bred them to track by scent.”
John looked at Sherlock as the detective pretended the entire conversation was completely below him by collapsing in his seat.
“What did you tell him?”
“Answer me… can I keep him?  Will there be any trouble if I bring him back to London with me?”
John struggled against tightening coils, unable to call out.  His Glamour had saved him last time Moriarty attacked him.  It seemed the gorgon anticipated John’s Glamour and countered it with an extra twist of his coils, keeping the centaur from touching the ground.  His hooves pawed at the air uselessly.
John adjusted his position, staring at the screen.  The two weren’t wearing shirts.  One man was moaning as the other bit his neck.  There was blood.  It seemed they had found some sort of vampire movie.  The victim had fangs too if his soundless orgasmic scream was anything to go by.  The vampire gave his lover a bloody kiss and they both moaned in delight as hands went down into waistbands.  John made a scramble for the remote, practically falling across Sherlock to reach it.  His thumb found the power and he shut it off.  In the deafening silence there was a metallic ping of something hitting the floor.  John looked down at his left hand and realized he had been playing with his ring again.  It had fallen in his scramble to get at the remote.
“But I haven’t taken your scent.”
I woke up naked in my bed with John’s scent on the sheets.  And for a moment I fought off the sensation of homesickness that came with having him so near.  But he wasn’t there.  The sheets held his scent but they were cool to the touch.  John had left them more than an hour before.
“Yes… found the morning after in an alley.  Defense wounds show there was a knife involved.”
John looked down at the plucked garland wrapped around his waist and chest.  “I still don’t…”
“I insist.”
“But… Why me?  Shouldn’t it be the king you’re defending?”
I stared up at him, confused.  “Look at me?”
John’s ears flicked back, hearing his mate’s voice.  The growling stopped but there was still a lip curl and the fur on the back of his neck bristled.
“Hysteria?” Sherlock queried.  Somewhere in his mind palace he knew it was an affliction that women were supposed to suffer from in the early history of women’s biology.  Of course the experts had been wrong.  But that did not explain why he was diagnosed with it.
Not really.
“Congratulations?  Or no?  You haven’t told anyone.  Not even the Alpha that impregnated you?  I wonder why…”
For a time they both panted for breath, Sherlock breathing warmly in John’s ear.  John stared up at the ceiling.  It had been years since his last sexual experience with anyone.  His last had been Mary not long before she died.
“Neither one of us could live with ourselves if we became infected and brought it home to her.”
John pulled back.  “You have to finish?”
“Even though you only met him when he was still a prince.”
“I didn’t want another servant to come at my call.”  Sherlock sat down on the bed and patted it with his hand.  “Come up here.”
“She left a letter.”  John whispered, rubbing his nose against Sherlock’s shoulder.
“Well… I am living with a warg.”
John pulled away enough to take a good look at the faun.  “You said you’ve been holding back your nature.  What did you mean?”
John regarded me from his chair.  “You know you’re good at that.”  With a smirk he tucked himself away.
“Right now?” John seemed to be a little more awake.
“Are you sure?” John asked as he lubed his fingers.
“You’ve been very naughty, Sherlock Holmes… ignoring your friend as he wandered the halls.  It wasn’t a very nice thing to do.  Not once coming down to check on him!”
“That was a long time ago.” John mused.
“Do you want to talk about it?” Molly asked.
“And now he has a human mate.  Perhaps they hunt together… a human could hold a knife.”
“Yes.” Sherlock whispered, pushing his hips up so John could feel his erection.
John gave a soft laugh and looked around the scorched room.  “Once we clean it up a bit…”
Sherlock sat at the kitchen table with a wolf’s nose wedged into his crotch.  The past few days John in human form followed him around wherever he went… even into the loo or to bed on rare occasion.  The werewolf curled up next to him on the bed sometimes in wolf form.  But while Sherlock worked at his microscope the wolf form rested his head on Sherlock’s leg… and then nuzzled up between Sherlock’s thighs.  Lightly Sherlock scratched between the wolf’s ears, earning him a soft lick on his crotch and a warm puff of air.  Needless to say the reaction was too distracting and the scratches didn’t come too often.  But this was something his werewolf companion needed… reassurance.
A tall figure in a blue sequined gown approached the table.  John looked up at her.  Up close the queen was formidable.  There was a mixture of masculine and feminine traits.  “You have my glove.”  Her voice was low, too low for a woman.  The eyes through her mask were pale.
“What am I to do with you?  I don’t have slaves… I don’t keep them.”  John grew annoyed.  “I don’t even WANT them… But you were a gift.”  John took several deep breaths to calm down.  “Ok… Look… I don’t need a bed slave.  Molly can go work in the kitchen, Lestrade can join my guard.  Sherlock can… Do whatever he was trained to do.  But all of you should put on clothing if you are to interact with my people.”  John picked up the clothing Molly had dropped and pushed it into her hands.  “You have work to do… So get dressed.”  He turned his attention to Lestrade.  “You too.  You can’t protect me in nothing but your skin.”  Finally he turned to Sherlock, his eyes unconsciously sliding down the other man’s body.  “And you… Whatever you do, do it with trousers on at least.  Your body is distracting.”
“As far as I like?”  Sherlock stopped moving.  Looking around them he realized their position.  “We’re in a sexual position.”
Rosie swallowed her mouthful of biscuit.  “Does da want babies?”
“That was… More than five years ago.”  Sherlock retorted.  “Why so long?”
“I…” Sherlock tried to pull away, escape from John’s attention in his throat.
“Oh… It’s ‘ask me properly’ and the answer is ‘whatever you want’?”
John tried not to think about how Sherlock just pushed a wedding ring onto his finger like it was no big deal.  But it was Mary’s wedding ring, not Sherlock’s.  Carefully he positioned it where it belonged.  Would Sherlock give him a ring one day?  If he were to remove Mary’s ring would Sherlock replace it with his own?  Did Sherlock even want that?
“You want a better husband.”
Mycroft dropped the file in annoyance, papers scattering everywhere.  “It tells me nothing about your motivations.”
On more than one occasion John placed his daughter in his king’s arms.
John stared dully at the floor, aware that Molly sat frozen next to him, the picture book still in her hands as Rosie cozied up to Sherlock.
John’s other hand reached down to cradle Sherlock’s bullocks.  “That’s it…”
“What?  Why?”
A look of recognition filled his eyes.  “If anything I’m bisexual, not gay.”
“I’m a werewolf.”
“Oh?  Now we’re talking?”
I watched him for a time, baffled at his light mood after casually reminding me of the person he was thinking about while he’s with me.  Did he mean to be cruel?  Eventually I too fell asleep.
“Well, if you two aren’t going out then I should go.”
“No…” Molly murmured and rubbed her face.  “I meant the person you are fixated with.  You call out their name constantly.  They can harm you and you go back for more.”
“Look at him…” The voice was masculine with a hint of an Irish accent.  “He’s so plain… So ordinary.”
Lestrade blushed.  “I can’t imagine what you must smell on me…”
John shivered and looked away, ashamed.  “No one needs to see that.”
John felt like he was deflating.
“I’ve read about going out… To pubs.  Meeting people.” Sherlock admitted.  “But you aren’t ready and I’m hopeless in that regard.”
Sherlock lightly touched the shaft.  “They look fine to me.”
“I do love you.”
John gave a small shrug.  “What do you want from me, Sherlock?  I’ll give you anything all you have to do is ask for it.”
Of course I might lie and said it was for a case… Mary’s case.
Sherlock smirked and leaned down between John’s thighs, taking his cock into his mouth.
“Sherlock… Pack is more than just pleasure.  It’s a connection.  Pack is of one mind and one heart.”
“I’m sorry.  I suppose I can live with just being a warm body for you to be with.  It’s okay.  You don’t have to like me.  No one does.”
“Sorry.” John answered.
And now it was getting cold.
John caught one last look of a devastated Sherlock standing helpless and alone at the table as he was pulled into the trees by the Fae.  Musical instruments came out of nowhere and they played as they traveled.  “What about Sherlock?”  But no one answered him.
There was a small nod in reply.
“But she’s my baby.”  John whispered, looking down at the curly blonde headed nymph that softly snored between them.  Already she was five years old.  It seemed like only yesterday when she had been baptized.  But so many events had happened after her baptism.  Mary’s death.  Moving back in with Sherlock.  Rosie’s first words and first steps…  Her calling Sherlock “da” for the first time.
My eyes started to sting and there was a lump in my throat.
“Y-yes…” Sherlock managed.
“When will we engage in coitus?”
“And a faun?”  John asked, suddenly remembering the devastated faun he had almost forgotten.
As soon as his pen lifted, the parchment fluttered away from the table into the devil's waiting hand. "Let's see what you've come with." he murmured, reading the handwritten words. That he was suprised at what he read was the least to say. The sentences were clean cut, no superflous subordinate clauses or conjunctions. Intentions behind each paragraph were obvious and watertight. After just a few lines, he knew there wouldn't be a loop hole to find. Sherlock had thought of everything, making sure that not only his soul would be transfered in whole and its original state, but also that no daemon or devil would have a right to recall the deal. Furthermore, he made sure his timer until death would be reset to run the course of a normal human being, specificly one that hadn't heavily experimented with recreational substances in his youth. What made the devil smirk, was a little line about how every daemon who would from then on show up to strike a deal, would automatically consent to being used in any experiment Sherlock could think of. That would definitely keep them on their toes and he apprechaited how even under pressure Sherlock couldn't help but keep that little edge. All in all, there really was nothing to hold against this contract.
John’s eyes snapped up to Sherlock’s face, cheeks tinged red. “Ehrm, yeah sure. What do you need?” The trousers had caught him off guard, especially since he was trying to figure out if anyone else but Sherlock could look this enticing in the same clothes. The simple, deep V-neck just amplified the effect of the low cut trousers and John was working hard to keep himself in check.
"Sherlock, you have to admit this is strange even by your standards." Lestrade ran a hand over his face and held up the file he was carrying, "Will you look at this or not?"
“Ah, I see you took the hint”, Sherlock smiled smugly as he stepped into John’s flat, long fingers twiddling with a sleek, black IPod.
When the show was over, John felt like waking up from a trance. He had no idea how much time had passed, if any at all. The dancer was a professional through and through. Even as he was making his exit, he kept being a bit cheeky and playful, which earned him a lot of giggles from the girls. In his head John tried to rewind what just had happened. He realised it was all more a blur than something sharply cut. For a moment, he mourned the loss but he was sure that simply the impression and feelings he got from the performance would make for heated material. Well, at least they would if afterwards he’d ever be able to leave his flat again.
"Just not a viable one" John hummed. Sherlock was slowly starting to look more relaxed again. His distaste for hospitals had been obvious every step of the way he had been awake for. The pain wouldn't have subsided completely, although Sherlock was resting the injured leg, but the other's body wasn't as tense anymore. Perhaps it was also just something John was imagine through wistful thinking. After all there weren't a lot of things which could make Sherlock feel uncomfortable in his own flat.
"Or what? Like you said: I'm your only shot at solving your problem. I don't think you'll dispose of me quite that unthinkingly." Sherlock smiled smugly. He was in charge. It didn't matter that the other was the devil. There were things apparently only Sherlock could do and he decided to revel in the feeling of having those tight reigns on John.
"Well then" John hummed and carefully cradled Sherlock, reasoning this would be quicker than trying to let him hobble through the flat.
“Hey, don’t be scared.”, John hummed softly, kissing his way back up to Sherlock’s face and lying down beside the other. He nuzzled the Omega’s neck, eyes closing involuntarily at the potent smell, “We’re fine. We’ve got time, well a bit at least.” Sherlock nodded and scooted closer which provoked a lazy grin from the other. “You are so incredibly beautiful.”, the voice was nothing more than a faint whisper teamed with fingertips that were gliding like feathers over long lines of pale skin.
"Well, I do have help and if you renounce all your wrongdoings at once, we would never meet. Most people aren't aware enough though to do that. It's usually a tiered system. I get the ones with the longest list and sometimes I take some of the minor cases just to relax. Also, time doesn't quite work the same way but let's not get into that."
"Come on, you can just let go."
John looked at Sherlock who was still sitting on his lap. They were both thoroughly dishevelled, covered in drying cum and John couldn’t remember when he had been happier. He liked his tongue over his bottom lip before saying “What answer gets me more of this?”
"You think I should have just left you to bleed out on the pavement while I, most likely unsuccessful, go chasing after Moriarty?"
"Sherlock?" John asked softly, peaking through the flat door. He had made sure to use nothing more than human speed. Somehow, he felt like the time would be best used to figure out his own thoughts a bit.
"As long as it doesn't come out of Mrs. Hudson's oven and has at least a cup of sugar in it, I'm assuming" John grinned. Although most surprises about how Sherlock lived were firmly in the category of biohazardous and 'I'm surprised you didn't manage to come downstairs quicker than your 13 years', others were more innocent. For example John had found out that Sherlock had a ridiculous sweet tooth and while he would pick at most foods, anything sweet would be eaten without complaint.
“Don’t treat me like I haven’t already seen through you from the moment you walked into the room”, Sherlock turned sideways so he was facing John who had raised an eyebrow in surprise. So much for concealing his attraction then. He could retreat to safer ground or throw his hat in the ring. Sometimes he didn’t know if he’d rather be less bold than he was.
"Perhaps not in a direct cause and effect way but there are some basic rules." John pointed out, leaning against the counter while he waited for the water to boil. The few minutes it took to ready tea felt like an eternity, even if they got him a bit of time to put his words in order. It wasn't as if he didn't want to desperately help Sherlock at the moment, it just wasn't possible.
From experience he knew that he wouldn’t have any problems to come from anal stimulation alone during his heat. It was all just a question of finding the right angle and hitting his prostate with the proper amount of force. Suddenly he wasn’t just mechanically trying to fulfil a need, his mind ran wild imagining John beneath him. Their heated bodies slapping together where Sherlock was grinding down on the other’s lap. Sherlock let out breathy little moans, the fantasy just that bit too much for him but his mind didn’t give him a rest. He continued imagining John lying beneath him gripping his waist tight and pulling him down hard onto his cock. Or perhaps he was sitting, pressing the other against his chest. Sherlock gasped, liking that fantasy best. He would be able to nuzzle right into the place on the other’s neck where the smell was the strongest. He bit his lip, knowing his fantasies were a bit not good but couldn’t shake how good they made him feel. The heat and pressure was steadily growing inside him and he nearly screamed as his orgasm washed over him, his hole clamping down on the fake knot at the base of the toy. He shuddered and let himself drop face forward into the pillows, breath still erratic. His thoughts before he fell into a short nap all circled around in confusion. No Alpha had ever made an appearance in his fantasies. Never had he actually felt like wanting to exchange his solitude against a real human seeing him through the heat. With his face again buried in now a mixed smell of sex, his own pheromones and the underlying tone of John he drifted off. He was in trouble, in deep trouble.
“That’s the definition of impatient.”
"Hasn't looked like it to me." Sherlock grimaced as he slowly tried to pull the fabric of his pyjamas down to access the soiled bandage.
“You need to follow two rules.” Sherlock said as he finally turned around, standing next to the IPod docking station, and fixed his gaze on John who suddenly felt unable to look at anything but those eyes, “You were a soldier, you should be good with those.” Sherlock tilted his head slightly to the side, making a few dark curls fall across his forehead. It momentarily distracted John, having him think about how they would feel if he ran his hands through them. Just as he wanted to open his mouth to answer, Sherlock interjected.
So far it was obvious Sherlock would need a few moments to calm down again and now that they weren’t at it anymore, John had no idea how to handle the situation. They had practically crashed into this head first.
"Well, you said yourself that he is probably disappointed in me not living up to the stories" John shrugged "What you humans usually do when you are disappointed is to take matters into your own hands."
“Enjoyed yourself at least a bit?” there was a smug smiled accompanying the remark.
"Yes, because now you've seen it but it’s not like he sent it to you on a silver tray with a little tag of 'fuck you' attached."
“Yes? Are you awake? Should we…”, John stopped dead in his tracks when he opened the door. “Sherlock?”
“John, don’t play with your friends. It’s not nice” Molly sighed “Either admit you think he’s cute and fuck him or stop. I need to study.”
"I should probably offer more information to you." the devil hummed and looked at the fireplace for a moment before igniting it with a grin, "Feels more like home."
"Well, it only took you five victims. I would say that is a new record even for you." Sherlock tried out snarky remarks. Something had to still work how it used to.
"Oh, now you're telling me there are also boundaries to life as a daemon you never thought to mention before? My, my how can I even trust a thing you say?" Sherlock put his hands under his chin, gently thrumming his fingertips together. He had the devil all worked up, now he just needed to figure out what would happen if he crossed the line.
"So sure, of yourself that you only need a day?" John grinned but gently pulled Sherlock to his feet. He couldn’t help to find the other’s fighting spirit endearing.
"He is still just a mere mortal" John said softly, pulling Sherlock out of his spiralling thoughts.
If he had been a bit more aware, John would have been in awe of how quickly Sherlock had sussed out all the small moves which drove him mad. He kept up a relentless rhythm which wasn’t too fast but gave the opportunity to let his tongue do amazing little tricks. It made John feel completely lost in the sensations, his hand in Sherlock’s hair the only thing keeping him grounded in the moment. There were good blow jobs and then there was this. This was just bone melting witchcraft. John was sure that he could come any minute. The arousal having built up for too long over the evening now. Something inside him was against that, though. John didn’t know why. He only knew that he needed Sherlock up there with him.
“Yes, just a bit…” Sherlock whispered almost deliriously before John felt that tell-tale tightening.
“Nah, just too old to be impressed by blown up peacocks” he grinned in response.
"That and future ones. It would be illogical to sell my soul for the solution to one crime. Like I said, I want my normal life expectancy back", Sherlock said clearly. He was rocking back and forth on his feet now. He wasn't used to having to justify himself in front of anyone.
"How does that work? You just keep people chained up until they say, 'Enough I'm done' or what?"
John huffed “No way and he’s probably just trying to figure out how to best knock me out of University”
"That's more like it, but we still have to work on you wanting to get away as quickly as possible." John hummed, running his thumb across Sherlock's bottom lip, "I don't make deals often. By that I mean that I don't come out more than one or twice every couple of centuries. So be pleased that I was bored enough."
"You're incredibly responsive, did you know that?" John panted slightly. The feeling of Sherlock's soft body underneath him react to every little touch was indescribable.
Sherlock just looked down at him expectantly before giving in frustrated when he realised that there wouldn’t be an answer from his friend. With long fingers he plucked the mug out of John’s hand, sat it down on the floor and then pushed the other back into a reclining position on the couch, crawling onto his lap and mashing their lips together.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and pressed forward, connecting their lips which provoked a muffled moan from both. John pushed against Sherlock more urgently, his hand wandering up into soft, dark curls. Until now he hadn’t known how much he had wanted to sink his fingers into that hair. It didn’t take much for Sherlock to lie back, John sure to follow so they needn’t stop kissing. For all the time they had danced around each other, they now fitted together smoothly. After a few awkward bumps of knees and noses, their bodies aligned perfectly. John’s other hand, which wasn’t currently occupied with tugging at the lush curls, sneaked down to run along Sherlock’s side. The simple touch elicited another moan from Sherlock, nearly gasped in surprise.
“What?”
"Oh, what's up with you two then?" Mrs. Hudson asked when she opened the door of her flat. Peaking at the trouble in her hallway.
"I assume there are other rules to what you do?"
"There is nothing I can do with this problem" John sighed, rubbing a hand along his forehead "After all, they don't just go away when they die. It's somewhat more work and I can't just push it away."
"Why do you think that's what he's after?" Sherlock asked, looking up at John.
"Behind what? Sending you clients?" John snorted "I really don't have time for that."
"Noticed that one, didn't you?" John sighed.
"My brain is working just fine, thank you." Sherlock huffed, "God, this will be awful. I'll be chained to the flat."
"Because there is nothing to discover. Spirits aren't material things, so they don't need a material place to be in. Hell will be wherever you will be after you died and if that's floating two feet in the air above Leicester Square than that's where it is. Being the way, I am now isn't my natural state, this is work for me keeping all the atoms together solidly enough for you to have your head on my legs. But just imagine for a moment that hell becomes a solid place. That it suddenly really is everywhere, and people are suffering all over the place. Nearly no one will find a way out of it, because that is just your human nature. You will suffer for all of eternity before you admit to a flaw and move past it. I believe that is the power that Moriarty wants. He wants to be the one responsible for making people suffer, bringing his own justice. He wants to control this hell he has read about. That is the problem with fanatics, they never consider anything besides what they have been fed their entire lives. He wants to be what I am not and if I want to do my job well enough, I cannot let him get away with it."
"You know, he's better than you think. He has a strong instinct but a good control on his biases." John hummed, stepping closer to where Sherlock was hovering over the corpse, "His gut says there is something wrong but his mind wants objective proof first before he decides. Really, he managed to find the right job."
"And that helps you find our guy?" John asked, slightly doubtful.
"Because you're definitely not the means to an end" he whispered and carefully pressed his lips to Sherlock's. The risk he took was immense and so he didn't dare moving forward until Sherlock almost seemed to melt into the touch. There was a short moment in which time stood still. Then they were kissing. It was slow and tentative, both still surprised by the development, exploring this new found element. The weight of a boulder fell from John's heart and for the first time in at least two centuries, he didn't mind being the devil at all.
“Still, sleep now and decisions later.”, John stroked his hand along the side of the Omegas face and had to chuckle when the other turned his face into the hand before falling asleep.
John shrugged “I accidently climbed through the window into his flat because I miscounted and thought it was Mike’s. Nothing big, it was the middle of the night and he was handling some dangerous acid in his pyjamas.”
“Yes”, John moaned and tightened his hands involuntarily on Sherlock’s hips in an effort to not start mindlessly thrusting into the heat which enveloped his cock. “You are so beautiful. So beautiful Sherlock, you have no idea.” The doctor wanted to weep tears of joy. It was so different to the night before and yet it all seemed so similar. Sherlock’s scent and body were so near and his Alpha senses were running wild.
Sherlock was moaning and arching his back, pushing his body into the contact. “Please”, he breathed, reaching out with one hand to grip John’s shoulders, the other was fisted tightly into the bedding.
Lestrade contemplated the words for a moment before he put down the file he was holding, "Okay, you won. I'll indulge you but only because of the Peterson case that was bloody brilliant. Next victim like this turns up, I'll give you a call but I won't hold it open indefinitely."
"As if you didn't smell blood and came running quicker than the hounds of hell on judgement day."
"Well, I can go with that" the other nodded finally and a bright red Sigel appeared next to Sherlock's signature, "Now this is done, why don't you come back here so we can go over the case?" The parchment disappeared and Sherlock felt that unknown force tug at him once more.
"Someone has to do it. I already told you that we are not the ones deciding on the duration of the punishment. Humans usually put themselves in eternal damnation and there is nothing I can do about it. If you cannot stop feeling guilty, if you cannot allow yourself to end your suffering, there is no way you are getting out of hell. But I can't keep you there if you have decided you have suffered enough for your personal sins. It's just.... well you've jumbled it all up and now I have the problem." John sighed. He wasn't fond of the system either, but it was what it was.
John's breath stopped for a split second. It felt like they were hanging in the balance with the situation able to tip either side. For a moment it was too much potential to properly process.
“How old are you?”, he asked, swallowing. There had been talks in certain circles that with the wealth he had gathered, John ought to look for an Omega but he never really considered it. The idea of buying another human being and binding someone blood young to himself simply felt wrong. He hadn’t given the talks more thought until now. Of course his family had been all for it, generally being all in for showing off how successful their son had gotten. “If this is really what I think it is, I will have to get angry.”, he muttered. With soft eyes he looked at the Omega and held out a cashmere blanket, “Here, the thing you’re wearing can’t be warm. I see if I can find your clothes, there must be some here. Calm down a bit and when you think you can talk, come to the lounge. The bath is through that door. Please do what you need to feel better. I’m leaving you here, trusting you can take care of yourself.”
“I can end you”, Sherlock was suddenly standing right behind John and just clenching his teeth kept the blond from swirling around and bodily throwing the other person out of whatever opening he could find, “It’s so easy. Just a few favours called in and you won’t be able to do a single thing anymore.”
John almost completely forgot about everything around him. His attention zeroed in on a sight he had never expected. His neighbour was perfectly adapted. The tight jeans and shirt did almost nothing to hide from view how well he was suited for this line of work. John swallowed hard. He knew he was outside the dancer’s focus and suddenly he was glad about it. The way the other managed to make his movements seem absolutely effortless, let John’s jeans grow just a bit too tight.
John gaped at the man in front of him, eyes big. “I... just... ehm… ”
"If I were to put a cross on..."
Sherlock grumbled and pressed a kiss to John’s neck, “Then I want to.”
“Yep, and no you are not going to change my mind. I’m not good with living people and I think I would be a failure as a practicing doctor. God, I’d be scared to death to kill someone all the time, that’s not a good trait in that job.” she laughed brightly at her own failings but otherwise took them with grace “Perhaps, I’ll try to work my way up to pathologist for the police. May be more exciting than your everyday hospital morgue.”
Perhaps the poor state of his mental faculties could be made responsible for not having noticed Sherlock moving closer. John felt like one moment the other had stood a safe distance away and with the snap of a finger, he was looming over him, both hands pressed against the back of the chair. For a moment John actually stopped breathing. When Sherlock pushed himself off smoothly for a ridiculously sexy and fast turn which lead to some kind of move that brought him quite near the ground and up again, showing off that plush arse just a bit too clearly, John actually gripped the seat of the chair. He realized how hard the ‘no touching’ rule would be to honour, especially since Sherlock didn’t seem to be in a hurry to move away. More than that, John actually had to swallow hard when another dip in the tempo of the music occurred and Sherlock apparently threw all caution to the wind, starting to writhe hard on John’s lap.
"I assumed it would be. Otherwise you'd have managed it yourself or one of your minions had" Sherlock was irritated. He needn't be treated like a child. There was a case and he wanted to get to it, not least because he wanted his payment.
“Yes, yes. I was only to come again if I were willing to give you a reason as to why I followed you”, Sherlock mocked him a bit so much was obvious.
“Can I… well, can I stay in your bed?”, the Omega was leaning into John’s side, holding on to his waist.
"No new question?" John teased, sinking his mouth to the skin beneath Sherlock's ear. He started kissing down Sherlock's neck, drawing each touch of lips against pale skin out longer than the one before. "Were that all the questions you had? Somehow I doubt that"
"Know that whatever you write on that piece will be binding and part of the contract, no matter if it's crossed out or otherwise obliterated beyond recognition" the devil warned him but didn't make a move to leave him alone.
He had enjoyed ten years of being totally irresponsible. Sherlock had to admit the fatal beauty of it. When he had lashed out at his parents with 17, cutting every connection they might still have had to him, his life had been worth nothing. The drugs had promised to be a pleasant distraction, letting him escape his ever racing mind. At first, he had been confident that he could control it. But the older he got, the more he noticed, the harder it became to not jump the walls with all the information his brain was trying to process. Mycroft’s tedious attempts to keep him in any University for long had failed within two years after that. Teenage-him had been incredibly pleased at how he had managed to best his older brother. Gloating at his own ingeniousness, he tumbled down a path of drug abuse. The consequences never bothered him. His life, boring enough as it was, held no value to him.
"You're amazing."
“So, you just don’t want to lose your personal keeper who makes you tea and generally clears up after you?” John asked a bit hurt.
"Then I assume this is a big inconvenience."
With a smile John quickly ducked out of Sherlock’s grip and sat down at the far end of his bed. Sherlock groaned frustrated. “Don’t be like that”, John chuckled and began to remove his own shirt but stopped after his buttons were opened, “Come on, sit up, strip and then we can see what we can do once there are no more clothes in the way.” Sherlock growled and clambered into a kneeling position, ferociously tugging off his shirt.
“No, you don’t.”, John said decidedly with the last bit of restrain he had, “You really don’t want this. Here I got you a few things that might make this easier. I leave a water bottle next to the bed. I’ll be back in a few hours to check on you.” With one last brush of his hand across Sherlock’s heated side that he couldn’t deny himself, he quickly left the room and closed the door. Outside he leaned against the wall, pressing his eyes shut and clenching his trembling hands. This wouldn’t be easy but nothing got him to violating a young boy who was out of his mind on a vicious cocktail of drugs produced by his own body. Right he needed to make his upstairs bedroom hospitable. That was something he could do that would take his thoughts off the beautiful Omega currently writhing on his sheets.
"I don't eat on a case. Digestion slows me down" Sherlock hummed, thumbing through the pages of his notebook as if he was looking back through his scrawl for an earlier recorded information.
"I can't see why. It hasn't stopped you before" Sherlock said with a shrug of his shoulders. If he remembered correctly, it was how nearly all of his cases had gone down so far.
Sherlock’s eyes got a horrified look at the mention of ‘help’ and John quickly cut in, “Not that kind of help. I was more thinking along the lines of providing food, water and clean sheets. I’m not going to have sex with you that is not on the table. If you feel more comfortable having heard me say it: I will not bond with you. We both didn’t choose this, so you can calm down, there is no danger.” For a moment John waited for a reaction from the dark haired teen currently sitting in one of his armchairs before coaxing him into talking, “Will you tell me a few things I should get you? I just want to have them all here before the shops close.”
"Jesus" Lestrade ruffled his hair, contemplating what Sherlock had just revealed to him, "You really are all out when it comes to this case, aren't you?"
"I already told you that I find your business model more than doubtful, didn't I?"
The devil rolled his eyes but let Sherlock go, who took the chance to hurry off to the kitchen immediately. He didn't really care one way or another about the tea but it gave him a moment alone. Something he desperately needed right now was a moment alone. No one ever should make two daemon deals and here he was. He had even gone right to the top and made them both with the devil himself. Slowly, Sherlock thought all the claims about him being insane might not be that far off after all. Defying siblings was one thing but whoring yourself out to the devil quite another.
shouldn’t have been your descriptor of choice.”
He didn’t mind living on his own, at least like this he had full control over what happened inside his flat. What he wasn’t used to, was the anonymity and indifference the people all around him were displaying. There was only one neighbour, who lived directly opposite John’s flat, shaking up the world around them a bit. John usually went out early in the morning for a run before his shift started. It was something he had gotten used to as part of his recovery. So whenever he left for his run, his neighbour was just coming home, unlocking the door on the other side of the narrow hallway. They never shared a worded greeting, only a small nod and smile but that was enough to make John feel not completely alone. He didn’t know what his neighbour did at night but it seemed to be draining. The other’s shoulders were usually hunched over in exhaustion and the eyes small. He seemed to be one of those people who were making use of the city’s sheer endless need for late night workers. It had become a much loved routine for John. Sometimes they also met in the afternoon or early evening, but those were never predictable. What never changed though were the short nod and smile.
Sherlock slowly blinked his eyes open, feeling disorientated at first. The hand on his shoulder made him twitch in panic before his mind caught up.
"What are you doing?" Sherlock asked again.
“Gosh, even your neck is bloody gorgeous” John chuckled, his hand in Sherlock’s hair tightening to pull the other’s head still further back. “So beautiful. You should look at yourself like this”, John breathed, attaching his lips right along the arch of Sherlock’s throat to suck a love bite onto it. Sherlock couldn’t stop moaning helplessly. There was no way for him to keep his otherwise marvellous self-control when he was under attack like this.
“You don’t imagine how much there is still to do”, she was complaining, “I mean, the wedding is just about a week away. We have organised almost everything, you should think. But now there are suddenly things like manicures, hairdresser appointments, and final rehearsals looming.”
"He looks like he's in a strop", Mrs. Hudson looked after where Sherlock had jumped up the stairs.
It was slightly frustrating, but John moved past it since he still had a few burning questions from earlier. When Sherlock had been buzzing around the corpse, filtering through information at a pace that even John found hard to follow, there had been a few key details that stuck. Unfortunately, the police then arrived and there had been no moment for John to even begin to ask questions. Perhaps today was one of the lucky days when Sherlock actually gave him explanations instead of waving it off as obvious. So, John pulled Sherlock closer, gently beginning to run his fingers over the other's scalp, establishing a soothing rhythm.
Sherlock swallowed and looked down for a moment, he needed to think about his wording because it would probably make all the difference. After all, he was dealing with the devil. He didn't doubt for a moment his words wouldn't be twisted in his mouth. "I'm dying. Multiple of my inner organs have failed or will fail within the next weeks. I have a life expectancy of about two weeks outside the hospital, four at most with intensive care. I need all the organs inside my body except my brain working the way they did before I started taking drugs. With that my life expectancy will be increased dramatically and I can continue my work."

Sally glared at her, but she knew the swordswoman was right. This was the most exercise she’d had since Waverly was born, and the idea of getting on the horse again filled her with dread.
“A very strange wedding,” the Queen murmured. She patted Sherlock’s hand. “It’s good to have you in the family though, my son.”
Stan gulped and nodded.
Years after, when he confided in Kitty, Kitty told him that deduction was exactly correct.
Sherlock was touched. “Of course, Jamiarty. I didn’t…I didn’t realize.”
The rest of it didn’t matter so much. Sure, they were on the run from one of the most powerful men on earth, and they were gearing up for a war with Florin, but…well, they had each other. And they had Mycroft and Molly and Grezzik and Stam, plus John’s grandparents and Princess Janine of Guilder…they would be fine.
“I do. And I…I’ve
Mrs. Hudson came up with the Hopkins family, Rachel wearing a bright blue dress and beaming. Kitty kissed John’s cheek and picked up her daughter. “Rachel, tell Grandad what happened today!”
Tolkien, in all his triumphs and shortcomings (Sherlock has fought people over Samwise Gamgee) becomes one of their favourite entertainment sources: their first anniversary they watched the entirety of the Extended Editions. The quotes on their wedding rings are from Sam’s speech.
"You're young again," Holmes marvelled. He touched Watson's cheek gently. "Are we dreaming?"
Pre-slash. Mary Morstan has a decision to make before she says her vows.
John scowled at his husband, but Sherlock just grinned at him. “Perhaps we should exchange stories?”
As I said before, while Prince Jamiarty’s father was in good help, there was no question of him being needed for anything royal. He had all the privilege and none of the responsibility.
There is some swearing.
As her brothers and sisters proudly unveiled a big sign that said HAPEE BURFDAY WAVERLEE, Uncle Sherlock and Uncle John came into the room.
“Only for cosmetic reasons. John looks more like Stan. But…” Kitty tapped her face. “I think there are certain genes that are just going to overwhelm the others. I don’t mind either way. And just to stop either of you worrying, think about it like this. If one of you was a woman, and you were having a baby, you couldn’t control which person the baby takes its genes from anyways.”
“Your daughter,” Martha replied. “Well, born one, anyways.” And she helped Sally sit up just enough to lay the baby on her chest. “She’s healthy, and you’ll recover, my dear.”
Sally beamed. “I remember that hill now! We’re only a few hours from the Palace.”
Sherlock’s glare was barely softened by the makeup. “Hilarious, John.”
“They’re back! They have her!”
Watson looked around the room. It seemed to be a strange cross between his own room at Baker Street and the long, sunny bedroom at the cottage, though there was no other bed. He wasn't quite willing to get up yet, but something told him they ought to explore.
No, there was something else.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What the FUCK are you doing here?” It was Greg, yelling through the door.
Their rings would have to be hung on chains, there would be no photographs of the wedding supper (which was a shame, Mrs. Hudson dancing was a sight to see) and their only honeymoon would take place on the overnight trip back to London in a locked room with one double bed. Only seven other people would ever know what had happened that night. It would always feel like a dream.
"Quite," Sherlock said sincerely. And then, in the same tone, "but I will hunt you down if you ever hurt her, do you understand me young man?"
Finally they arrived. It was just before sunset, and the lad who met them at the station with a carriage told them that a cold supper was laid for them at their table. Watson couldn’t help but smile.
“Really? Odd. Oh well.” Jamiarty rose. “I need to go. We’re getting this wedding over with as quickly as possible.”
“I  got good grades, and I was smart, and I got into uni a year early. I saved what I could and I had some money from my granddad. He was good to me; gave me my first
“Kitty, what’s wrong?” Sherlock asked.
It took a long time to get to Angelo’s by foot, but they managed it before close. Angelo smiled when he came up to them. “Table for two, boys?”
“Oh for Heaven’s sake, come here!” Watson dragged Holmes to stand by the mast. “Will this do, Mycroft?” he asked.
“Necessary transport,” John reminded him. “Come on. We won’t leave the flat.”
"Who are you?" Sherlock snapped, pulling John close.
Mrs. Hudson was well aware that Sherlock and John wanted two bedrooms when they first moved in. She was also well aware that they wouldn’t need them long.
“Would you want one?” Sally asked. She switched Waverly to her other breast.
Stam shrugged at John. “They’re a strange lot, aren’t they?”
“Seb got promoted, and Jamiarty—”
“Your pulse wasn’t nearly this fast. It hasn’t even been this fast when we’ve been—"
“Mycroft—”
“No, I did not want a dress. I just wanted to match you. Do keep up, John.” Sherlock turned to Kitty. “You want to know what I finally decided?”
Grezzik was twelve and terrified, but he went because his father and mother promised to follow the caravan. And they did for the next five years.
"Sherlock?"
At last the Count stepped away and considered him. “No doubt you’ve guessed that your crime was not kidnapping the Princess.”
"I can't bear to think of missing her life," he confided to John over the punch bowl. He was holding a picture of the baby, with clouds of blonde hair and her father's huge green eyes. "I mean I get it, people balance jobs and kids, but Margie's job pays quite well, and I'm thinking if I stay home with her then we'll save on childcare, won't we?"
And then she would take Waverly. Then she would take the child far away, with or without Jim’s permission.
The other man took it, shaking his head. “It is good to meet you, Dr. Watson. This is—well, it does beat all, doesn’t it?”
“Fair enough.” Riley laughed. “Look where that’s brought us.”
“Do not doubt your worth,” Holmes said firmly. “Ever. I know you. You will never stop trying to be useful, and you will never fail…until your very bones give out.”
“Comforting.” Anderson brushed the mud off his trousers. “I’ll get to it.”
A deep silence fell over the room.
“I’m glad.”
“That jumped-up—” Miracle Max descended into curses. Martha patted his arm, but she too looked murderous.
“Seven months.” Sherlock’s touch was more gentle now, at least what Watson could still feel under the numbing drug. “You said you were married as well? How on earth did you manage that?”
Greg was indignant. “What’s your problem, mate?”
John remembered the day he’d moved in. He’d placed his gun in the top drawer after he and Sherlock had come back from Chinese at three in the morning, still high from adrenaline. He’d fallen asleep that night exhausted and hopeful for the first time in weeks, the only bitterness that Sherlock, of course, wasn’t interested in him. Ah well. He’d be satisfied with friendship.
“I’ll take the sword,” the count snapped. His lip curled. “I’ll take the girl too, and give you full price.”
As they moved forward, their steps became quicker. Sherlock kept his hand tightly in John’s, but he was gaining confidence.

And Sherlock was happy, really happy for the first time in his life. Even early days with John, before the Dream (John called it the Night, but that wasn’t very specific, it had nothing to do with ‘magic moonlight’, as Mrs. Hudson said). He had a lover, something he’d never asked for, and found that it was better than everyone always said. Things were so usually backwards to that, and he didn’t want to spoil it.
Holmes saw Irene Adler Norton one other time; it was during his time abroad after the Fall. In disguise as a fireman, he saved her daughter, Rose Norton from a house fire. Irene recognized him, told him sharply to go home, and thanked him. A month later, Holmes sent her a marked copy of the Strand with Watson’s story,
Grezzik and Molly are after the witch. And on the Cliffs of Insanity, Grezzik makes a decision.
From a young age, Kitty hated her beauty. It disappointed the father who wanted a son, it made her stepmother throw her out, it caught the attention of Gruner. Stan is the only one who ever made ‘beautiful’ sound like a good thing.
“You’re about two hours early, you clots! And haven’t you been taught to knock?”
Sherlock was surprised. “She can do that?”
“But love, we’re almost out. And now we know what Snow Sand looks like, and the popping fire is easy enough—”
“Darling, are you finished?” he called.
“Never,” Watson promised.
“Yes.”
“I don’t believe so,” Mycroft said carefully. “Goodness knows Louis the Fiftieth believes in the Right of the Crown, but he values France’s neutrality, especially if all of us support the action. And if we can prove the murder…”
“It’s a common love song in Guilder,” Janine explained. “It sounds like they’re playing something from every country.”
"Have you ever been scared?" Billy asked, wide eyed. His grandfathers were brave and clever—surely they'd never be afraid.
“I’ve always been quick to heal. What are our assets?”
The giant approached him. “Then there will be no one to hear you scream,” he said in a thick Turkish accent.
Molly pursed her lips. "If I can help at all, just me know."
“Oh, okay. Doesn’t Grandfather John snore, though?”
"Don't be cruel, John," Sherlock said mildly. "Your Uncle Mycroft has a similar set he doesn't use, Kitty. I'm sure if you asked nicely you could go and borrow one. You'd better be quick, though. Mrs. Hudson will be back in an hour."
And right now they were getting married.
Then she returned to Yeste and asked for a loan of two hundred gold coins.
As the first chords began to play, Sherlock smiled and took his husband (
Sherlock thought this over. “I am interested,” he said carefully, “but not because I particularly relish the details. I am interested because your past is part of you, and I am beginning to realize it shaped you in ways I did not consider.”
“On what?”
“What in the bloody FUCK?”
The news that John had managed to take the last boat to America before the winter seas became too rough. The news that the boat was called
He’d dived in front of it. Hopkins was only a boy, his life ahead of him. The knife had sank into his ribs, and the shock had made him stumble backwards. He must have struck his head on the pavement.
John shook his head, not bothering to wipe his tears. “Give my love to everyone. Goodbye, Sherlock.”
Sherlock bowed his head. He hadn’t meant to let that slip out.
“She does. And I am more sorry than I can say that it was so long in coming.”
“I can try. Is that your favour?”
Watson shook his head. "Have you decided on a name?"
Sherlock's made a deduction about the Man in Black, but there's always something...
Hope everyone enjoyed, and good luck to those of you who are going back to school. (Or who started a while ago...you have my sympathy).
“Does it work?”
Sherlock was befuddled. He glanced at Mycroft, hoping he would have answers, but Mycroft looked confused for the first time in his life.
“She could get up the Cliffs by magic,” Miracle Max said. “We’ve already seen that she can fly. But teleportation…no. That’s not possible solo. You need a team of witches to do that.”
“Why do you want to promise the man you love that you’ll be with him forever?” Sherlock asked. “I think that’s fairly obvious.”
"I think it's so the marital fighting doesn't begin over who gets to pop the cork."
They were both sitting on the back of a bird.
“You’re killing him,” Ireni said, the knife now gently scraping Sherlock’s throat.
That purpose had a noble reason, whatever that may be.
, but she was not in the court room to hear the verdict. Sherlock didn’t tell me what was going on, but I hoped the young lady had gotten away. I read through Gruner’s book and I was utterly sickened by his depravity. Holmes and I have confronted monsters before, but I pray that there is a special Hell for souls like his.
“At last, he gets it!” Jamiarty clapped his hands. “Yes, of course I’m clever. It’s been fun playing stupid, but time for the charade to end.”
But then the man lit a torch, and it shone on two faces that were familiar in a dreamy way; a childhood memory blurred with time.
"His book?"
Moran looked over. “That’s right, I forgot you were here.”
Seb was pacing again when Stam came down. He didn’t look up when Stam slid the tray through the small opening in the door.
Sherlock met Prince Jamiarty with Moran in his office once more.
They stayed like that until John found them.
They dozed off together in the later afternoon, John’s hand firmly around Sherlock’s wrist so he’d wake up immediately if he moved. The detective didn’t stir, however, and when John woke up it was getting dark. Sherlock was staring at him intently.
“Ask you?”
, he is just another person. But you can’t quite manage it, can you?”
Sherlock was saved by the doorbell ringing. John went for the door but Mrs. Hudson got to the stairs first. “You finish the peas, I’ll let everyone in.”
“Interesting…”
Sherlock first sees the term demisexual in the fanfiction bookmarks of a kidnapping victim
Molly watched Grezzik think that through. “How can I go? The winds aren’t favorable.”
Greg has always tried to go with the flow (which is why he can handle Sherlock so well). So when Mycroft asked him if their regular coffee could perhaps be held at a more romantic location, he didn’t panic or even ask if he was sure. He could learn to love Mycroft. What he learned instead was that he already did.
"Just an experiment," John called down. "Don't worry, we're alright."
"Well, Billy, you're awfully young, but how about this? If you like, your granddads can keep telling you stories and teach you about it...I can tell you some too, actually. Then, when you're a bit older, you can maybe try it, okay?"
“You’re not serious.”
“And what is our cause?”
“Hello, Johnny boy.”
Another new voice. Molly dashed to the window, and Sherlock followed, his arm around John’s waist to support him.
"Try to instead of imagining what happened to the girl upstairs," John whispered.
“How do you know?”
Billy opened one of the books he’d brought and waited, hoping they’d relax on their own, but as the clock ticked they didn’t even pick up books themselves. Or talk. Or look at each other.
John shuddered. That was it, that was the piece they hadn't considered. “It was me,” he whispered. “This whole time, you've been targeting me.”
Janine took a quill and drew a circle which encompassed Florin, Guilder, Sanctaphrax,  Regalia and London. “Then we have a barrier of supportive countries. Do we need to worry about France, though?”
Watson smiled. “My dear Sherlock, do you not understand? I want no public honour.”
“Goodnight, Waverly.” Grezzik kissed the baby’s head, and handed her back to her mother. “I will come and wake you in the morning, Sally.”
What started as a simple missing person’s case combined with robbery ended with a desperate gunfight under the London Eye. Victoria Hatherley, who was only a puppeteer on weekends for children in the cancer ward, had lost her thumb trying to escape from a drug ring. Their leader, “Robert Stark, please no wedding jokes,” had tried to convince the young electrical engineer to do a show at a church to raise donations. She arrived to see no fewer than seventeen men and women waiting for her with bags of cocaine to put in her puppets. Her refusal had cost her a thumb, but without the help of Stark’s daughter Lisa it would have cost her life.
The Count was back against the table now, but he spun away, but Maria knew that move, had studied that move since she was thirteen, and she attacked again, and this time the Count got a hit on his right hand.
“What?”
John seized Moriarty by the lapels, holding him close to the edge, heart racing with panic. "And if I throw you off?"
"Thank you," Holmes replied. He smiled at John. "Ah, John. Good to see you're well. They found you, then?"
“Watson—well, the Dr. Watson I’ve known—he’s explained bits of it. I understand your marriage was out in the open?”
Janine tensed. Sukiv wasn’t looking at her.
John didn't reply. He was having trouble holding Sherlock's gaze, and it wasn't due to the height difference that sometimes caused a crick in his neck, in both their necks.
“What’s the matter?” Grezzik asked.
John managed to—well, not quite forget, that would be nearly impossible, but he did put Sherlock's hint out of his mind as Bradstreet chatted enthusiastically about his daughter. Bradstreet was one of the few men John had ever met who'd campaigned successfully and enthusiastically for paternal leave. Now that his daughter Abby was six months old he was back at the Yard, but it was currently only part-time and there were rumours that he was planning to retire and go into something less dangerous.
“I will never doubt again.”
Sherlock didn't answer.
"A case? Like when you go on holiday?"
The voice was familiar, but Watson couldn’t distinguish it, muffled by the fog as it was. A thought struck him. Could it be...?
you—”
“You can stay here,” Holmes answered, deep voice rumbling against John’s ear. “It’s bright here, and quiet if you need it, or I can talk if you like.”
John couldn’t speak until they were out of the block of flats. Then, in as normal a tone as he could manage: “didn’t think Greg would top.”
Fall was turning into winter now, but in the weeks that followed, Sherlock couldn’t bring himself to care. He was far too busy running, climbing trees, pestering trappers to teach him the ways of the woods, practicing hand to hand combat against bushes as Skull watched. John was his constant companion in his heart, if not in reality, and Sherlock often spoke aloud to him. People watched him sometimes, dazzled by the lovelight in his eyes. He was the second most beautiful man in the world by the first snowfall.
Jamiarty was beyond speech, his eyes inflamed with madness. The way he looked at Sherlock almost made him shiver, but John’s hands were over his, and that was all that mattered.
"Well then why would I be scared?" Billy really didn't understand, and he was tired of that. "Please, Grandads, can't you just tell one story?"
The crowd parted, stunned into silence, and Maria sprinted in the direction of the noise.
"I know the theory," Holmes interrupted. Watson raised his eyebrows, and Holmes blushed. "I was...researching."
This is for Willow_Angel again, who asked long ago for some Victorian Mystrade. I finally figured out a way to do it.
John covered Sherlock’s hand with his own. “I’m sorry,” he muttered. “I shouldn’t yell, but Philip…take this from a man who left his love behind. Don’t let misunderstandings come between you.”
"Our regular nanny is getting married," Molly explained to Kitty. "It'll only be another year or so until they go to school, but it will still be nice to have someone when they get home, since I work sort of irregular hours. They really like you. Do say yes."
Sherlock didn’t sleep that night. He paced his tiny room (17 steps around the bed exactly) and tried to unravel it. There was no way on earth that the strong, blonde farm boy would love him. Why, he was cruel to him! He ordered him about, constantly, even when they were both children and sometimes Watson would cry for his parents. He never cried now, his eyes like the sea after a storm calm and patient as he listened for Sherlock’s commands.
This Saturday night was being spent at the Yard's spring party. Why was this party being held? John couldn't tell you. Greg had sent them a text, and they were going. That was all Sherlock would say.
“It seemed considerate to tell you the situation as quickly as possible.” Mycroft’s face wavered. “Besides, little brother, it’s been three years, and I feared for you.” He spotted John. “Hello, John. You’ll be staying with Sherlock now, I hope?” There was no hope in his voice at all; it was pure, icy threat.
“You couldn’t have known that,” Sherlock said awkwardly. He looked to John for help, but John seemed just as flummoxed.
The wind was still howling outside, and Rachel’s birthday would be stormy every year, but that little room was quiet as the family took in its tiny, newest member.
“Don’t want it,” Maria murmured, slumping over. “Hate it. It’s vile.”
“Please, John. If I'm wrong, we can stop this for Sherlock. Come to my place, it's on Alder Road. We can talk it out.”
“Did you?” Waverly’s eyes lit up. Made presents from Uncle Sherlock and Uncle John were even better than brought presents.
Except for Jamiarty. He was genuinely friends with her (though not ‘best-friends’), because they understood each other well. Riley didn’t pretend with Jamiarty, Jamiarty didn’t pretend with her, and they hunted together.
“You were correct. I am actually the Dread Pirate Roberts.”
“He won’t be fighting,” Maria promised. “We’re going to avoid engaging as much as possible. We just need to steal the Princess and I need to kill the Count, then we’re gone.”
And happy holidays, of course.
“…You have a way of surprising me, Doctor Watson, that manages to be endearing rather than irritating. I hope this will not change.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Whew, that was a long one :)
John didn't quite know how to respond to that.
The dawn came, and the man in black was still behind them.
“Secondly,” Holmes said, determined not to be put off by Watson's lack of interest, “I am no patriot. I care for my country, I suppose, but I do not work for Her Majesty any more than I work for our poorest client—all are equal. There may be no other city such as London in the world, but I am loyal to the city alone. My accepting a knighthood would be tantamount to hypocrisy, and I won't do it.”
“This is Sally,” he explained. “She will be our Carrier when we’re wed, if she suits you.”
“No,” Mycroft said, and his tone was gentler now too. “Your mind is fascinating the way a tangled field is fascinating—Nature grows within it, its power coming from the chaos, springing forth new blossoms that no one’s ever seen.”
“Fair point.”
The big day, and some important words.
“I don’t know, Sally. Your mother only said that she hoped he would care for you, but no one ever came.”
Well, close enough at least. He was in about thirtieth place when this story really begins, when he was eighteen. Sherlock was tall, unnaturally pale for someone who spent most of their time riding Skull the horse, and he was fed up with the idiots who lived in the village. His only friend Victor had stopped speaking to him because all of the
Sherlock remembered now; her aunt was the one who raised her. The King had fallen for two sisters, how interesting.
Sally saw the flash and screamed.
King Lotharon looked at her. “Sally! What a pleasure to see you.” He came towards her, his hands outstretched. “After you left, I feared I wouldn’t see you again.”
This chapter begins in the middle of the episode 'The Reichenbach Fall', and the bolded text is a direct quote from the episode. All the break-ins happened, and Moriarty is on trial.
Cheers,
Holmes pressed a quick, desperate kiss to the top of his head. “But how?”
in his arms. “We did indeed.”
Really gone. John had examined his body himself, checking for a scar he’d noticed at the Pool; a small one, just under his chin, but noticeable, difficult to replicate. It was there.
Sherlock nodded. “You will be alright. You’ve got three very skilled people with you.”
John looked across the table and met Greg's confused eyes. "We've got to go home, Greg, Sherlock has a migraine."
“He’ll know the moment it begins; the throne room is too public. They will need cover, and none of our allies can make it there that quickly.”
“I dunno,” John answered. “They just want to drop in.”
“Sorry. But Seb asked that I just stay close to the palace.”
Then he got it. Stupid of him, really, he should know the signs by now. It hadn't been that long since his own last one. "Are you having fragmented vision?"
John lay on the bed. The curtains had hidden him from Sherlock’s first cursory glance around the room. He looked exhausted, his body limp.
“There was something else,” Mrs. Hudson said a bit hesitantly.
“Yes. I am unhurt. So is Waverly.” Grezzik shifted the bundle in his arms. “Where is Riley?”
“Nice of you to join me at the end of the book.”
“Ask your brother.”
They were going to win.
“I’ll think about it, your Highness,” she said at last.
They laid there for hours, breaths growing shorter. Finally, just before dawn, they closed their eyes.
"Can you? That's brilliant, it'll be easier than a cab." John held Sherlock's hand firmly, rubbing soothing circles over his palm. "Keep your eyes closed, dear, you're just fine."
Cheers,
“It’s possible, you warthog-faced buffoon. I could be lying here because I lack the strength to stand.”
“Clever Princess. Thank you for not giving me away.” The man in black handed Sherlock a few pieces of cheese. “Eat. You’re going to need your strength.”
Holmes got the message. “Come along, Watson,” he called.
Sherlock heard John scream from nightmares every so often from the first night they shared a flat. He saw him turn green at the sight of an arson that killed a family of seven, saw a flicker of fear in his eyes when Moriarty was mentioned. They were normal reactions, subdued perhaps but still appropriate to the situation. Before the Dream he assumed that John Watson was as English as his name, and emotion was simply not done.
John couldn't think of how to say anything back even half so well.
And the woman disappeared.
Fear seized Holmes as the deckhand came up to them. Could this man be trusted? Then a wig was removed, a mask slipped to the side and Stanley Hopkins stood there grinning. “Good evening Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson,” he said happily.
“Relax, Princess,” Grezzik soothed, a little out of breath. “We’re at the top.”
Even still, he nearly jumped out of his skin when John opened his eyes, looked rapidly at both of them, and began to shout.
John bristled. “He killed me!”
"I can't," John choked. "I can't, because he's got you."
“Do you, Sally, accept the responsibilities and privileges of being the Heir?”
Sherlock was positive now, there was nobody there. He moved closer to Raz and spoke in his normal voice. “I haven’t been in this castle for months, have I?”
"We'll be alright," John assured her. "We won't be long."
Sherlock hung up on Mycroft and answered the call.
know I know you're lying. Just like you were about the Study in Pink."
“Sherlock, will you keep faith and love in your heart for John?”
On their marriage certificate, it shows that John changed his name to John Hamish Watson Holmes. He keeps his own name for professional reasons, but Sherlock calls him ‘Mr. Holmes’ as often as he can.
Watson shot a glance at him, but Holmes was tired of waiting. “Why all the secrecy?”
See, I told you not bother about Florinese political genders.
John remembered the last time he’d slept up there, the night he still didn’t understand, when he’d spoken with a man trapped in a time without freedom for love. The next night he’d only gone into the room long enough to grab pyjamas.
“You’re not stupid, love.” John pressed a kiss into his damp curls. “That had to be one hell of a drug to knock you over. If anything, we should be grateful, because if it was me I don’t think we would have noticed anything unusual.”
“Take a rowboat,” Sherlock said. “And take—Molly, you’re the lightest of us all.”
“You don’t love him?”
"Sherlock, I want to help. I can do this. Now all I need is a babysitter."
“Never. I’m with you.” And John closed his eyes.
“Yes.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Molly cried out. “Grezzik! I see them!”
“Yes. I know where she sleeps. I’ll take care of it.”
“Sherlock.” His brother’s voice was mild but firm. “You and your friend should go aboard.”
John hung up and started to dial for a cab again. Distracted by the bright screen and his worries about Donovan—they hadn't thought about her, what were they going to do?—he didn't hear the near-silent footsteps behind him.
“Mycroft does that too.”
Sherlock jerked awake, damp with sweat.
“I’ll send him a message,” Sherlock answered. John’s eyes were boring into him but this wasn’t the time for answers. He could explain his mad, computer-minded extrovert of a brother later. “Has there been anything on the news?”
Cheers,
“I don’t know if I’m brave enough.” Sherlock had his face buried in John’s chest now, but John still heard him.
Watson pulled him into his arms, sheltering the man who’d always seemed so fragile, and now he knew why. “Sherlock…dear heart…” Holmes struggled but Watson held him tightly. “You offer so much more than your brain. You offered yourself, and the world saw only your brilliance. It’s a peculiarity of humans that they can notice only one thing about a person, and continue to only see that. So they see your astonishing mind, and they are blinded to your great heart.”
“Huge, black. Its eyes were glowing.” Sherlock’s eyes were wild. “Once you’ve eliminated everything possible—”
“I don’t want to get married,” he sobbed to Magnussen. “I’ll have some horrible wife that I have to impregnate and have a child with.”
“I’ll hold you to that promise, Molly Montoya,” Janine whispered as they went in.
“Because I didn’t trust Prince Jamiarty,” Mycroft answered. “And I knew something was going to happen. I’ve been busy, these last two years, making contacts among other nations. I even let myself get conquered.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Martha Hudson’s maiden name was Meadows. Though she doesn’t realize it, so was Kitty’s grandmother. They were sisters. Kitty has inherited the family spirit, acceptance of odd living conditions and her great-aunt’s blue eyes.
“Grezzik?”
“So I thought I would give you something tangible, something you can always see even when we’re apart.” Sherlock’s voice broke. “And I swear, John, those moments will be few and far between. I want to spend the rest of my life by your side, whatever we are doing. Will you marry me, John Watson?”
Kitty looked away. "Alright, fine." She sat down at the table and picked up a pencil. "Graph paper, please."
Sherlock had left to find Molly. Molly, with Mike's help (now that was a couple John hadn't seen coming) were going to smuggle a body nearly perfectly Sherlock's match out of Bart's and into an abandoned house not far from the Study in Pink house. Sherlock was going to call Moriarty there, Moriarty would take the bait and tell Sherlock to commit suicide for the price of restoring his name, and Sherlock would set the house on fire, disappearing through a trapdoor into a cellar Mike had built on a weekend off.
John licked his lips, his eyes on Sherlock’s lips.  “None at all?”
“Do you have a last name?”  John asked.
“It’s more what isn’t there, actually… And he was pushed!”  Sherlock waved his hands at the body and looked up at the battlement above them.  “From there.”
The brunette leaned in and lightly brushed his lips against John’s.
The uncertainty in Sherlock’s posture made John sit up, legs still open and surrounding his mate.  “Sherlock… you don’t have to.  I was just offering more if you wanted it.  You don’t have to… I just wanted you to know that I’m willing.”
“I’ll need to be touched… not necessarily sex… but to reaffirm our pack.”
For weeks I forgot.  It was only after I returned from hospital that I remembered.  I felt increasingly distracted as John spent the afternoon with me.  I wanted him to bend me over the table and take me.  Wild fantasies filled my brain.  It was my brain’s reaction to his Alpha scent.  I was only half aware of his admission to cheating on Mary.  My Alpha started to cry and I moved to wrap my arms around him to comfort him.
John sighed and hugged his daughter close a moment before letting her go.  “Do you have everything?”
“Sherlock…” John sighed with an exasperated tone.
“I don’t know how you can do that…  Don’t you gag?”
John stepped away, shaking his head.  “I… I don’t need a bed slave.”
“I’d like to see you try…”  John whispered before Sherlock took his lips.
Quickly the detective sent a text to Mycroft.  “If warg stop breeding they are sent to their death?”
“Lady Mary is fair.”  Lestrade commented.  “You will need to take a wife.”
Sherlock pouted.  “I couldn’t please you.”
Oh, Mary had such a lovely name.  And he desperately wanted to rub up against her.  “Mary…”
“Bath and bed?” Sherlock echoed.
I shake my head.  It’s only sex… With the man I love.  “Sorry.  Another time, perhaps?”  Hastily I put away the violin and loosened the bow.  I took my leave and returned to Baker Street.  Not that John would be there.  John had his own home he made with Rosie.  All I had was an empty flat with no company except for Mrs. Hudson.  As much as I cared for her, she had a habit of making a nuisance of herself when I wished to be left alone.
“And you’ve decided it.”
“London… last full moon.”  Sherlock replied.  “John identified him as the killer.  Victim was stabbed and had their throat ripped out by a transforming warg.”
“John Hamish Watson… Stop being so willfully ignorant.”
“Don’t you have work to do?”
“You’re saying that you have distanced yourself because you’re afraid of what will happen to me?”
“Of course.”  Sherlock smiled.
“It’s for a case.”
“John… I may be persuaded.”
“Holmes.”  The faraway look in Sherlock’s eyes slowly came back to where they were.  “It was Holmes.  I had forgotten.”
“Not right now… I’m in the middle of a case.”
John went through my cupboards before turning on the water.  “Two nurses cancelled their shifts…”  I watched him prepare a bottle.  “We seemed to have more patients than usual so everything was backed up.”  Water splashed and John entered the room with a bottle and a bib.  Quickly he placed the bib and held out the bottle.
“You didn’t like it.”
She said it before time was called.  But then it turned out that neither of us had to go through that at all.  I was so angry, so disgusted, I smashed the casket.  I knew I could never have John.  Never!  It wasn’t fair!
Sherlock crossed the room and sat on the floor before John.  “What do you wonder, John?”
Watson pulled out a handkerchief and held it against Sherlock’s tip as he stroked the organ over and over again.  “Relax.  Deep breaths.  Just let it happen.”
The faun smiled and shook his head in the darkness, illuminated by one small torch.  “Does there have to be a reason?”
When John woke several hours later the candle had guttered out.  His head was on Sherlock’s shoulder and his king was softly snoring.  Their skin was still covered in dried seed.  It was beginning to smell but John found he didn’t mind.  Wrapping his arm around Sherlock’s body he closed his eyes and went back to sleep.
There had been a date.  Rosie was with Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson.  John took Mary out to a restaurant for dinner.  They had made love when they returned home, a little giddy with wine, knowing they had the house to themselves while their daughter was safe with people who adored her.  When Mary fell asleep John wondered if what he was doing with E was considered cheating or not.
The call ended and Sherlock stared at the mobile in his hand.
“So tell me about how you met our king.”
“The woman in the video said it could last… an hour?”
They were together for two weeks.  For two weeks they shared pleasure multiple times a day.  There was more sex than Sherlock could even imagine having with anyone, much less a wild forest god.  Because that’s what John was… A forest god.
“That’s John… John, this is Molly.”
Sherlock looked at the clock.  “It’s still too early for bed.”
I showed John my text history.  John fell asleep with a content smile on his face, muttering about ropes and handcuffs.  Maybe someday…
John obeyed, carrying the skull up to the dais with Mary beside him.
“I know that it’s fine…”  The double entendre of the words weren’t lost on Sherlock.  Nervously he shifted to accommodate the bulge between his legs.  “Be gentle with me?”  Glancing at John a moment he looked away and turned red.
“I’m sorry!  But the thought of you being pregnant nearly broke me.”  John took a deep breath to calm his breathing.
The hum found its way to John’s spine and he bucked, fingers tangled in Sherlock’s curls to pull his head down to meet him.  Wrapping one leg around Sherlock’s shoulders he pulled the other man closer, arching into him and cursing with each thrust until finally he burst.  For several long moments he gasped for air, only vaguely aware of the scratchy nature of the hay under his sweaty back… Or the tightness of Sherlock’s curls in his fingers.  Gentling his fingers he released the other lord’s hair, surprised when a few strands were caught between his fingers.
“As well as can be expected.”  John answered.  “I know it’s just a phase.  I keep telling myself it’s just a phase and she’ll grow out of it.  She’ll eat when she’s hungry.”
“I was caught with my pants down.”  John answered as he pulled on the jacket.  “It won’t happen again, Sherlock.”
“That’s not what I meant… He’s alone.  I could use the company.”
“It’s Sherlock.”  Sherlock kissed John’s lips and then kissed a wet trail down his body, taking particular interest in chest, belly and cock.
Watson sat up on his throne.  The former military general turned ruler blinked at the gifts that were set before him.  Many of his new subjects brought treasures or food.  Some brought animals.  Watson wasn’t expecting slaves.
John eyed the detective.  “Sherlock…”
John blinked at me and then focused on his mobile.
“No, you won’t.” John chuckled softly.  “I’ll have to drag you to bed.”
John shut his eyes and tried to imagine himself as he once was.  It seemed to work for Sherlock adjusted his hand to touch John’s shoulder.  Opening his eyes he looked down at himself and gave a scream.
Sherlock sat up, straddling John’s hips as he stared down at the lord.  “I will have to sire heirs too… But for now I would have you inside of me.”  Shifting a bit, he undid John’s trousers and pulled out his already erect cock.
I took a step away.  “No.”
“Go away!”  Sherlock hissed.
I know what sex is, why does everyone assume I don’t?  I know how impersonal it can be.  From my first time on my knees at uni with an acquaintance eagerly shoving his cock between my lips to the chips vendor who offered a trade in services when I was starving.  My performance earned me a lifetime supply of chips because I was his alibi when someone who looked like him was seen fleeing a murder.  That’s when I met Lestrade.  I’ve seen men experience pleasure, I’ve tasted their semen.  The chip vendor was surprisingly tender and sentimental so the experience wasn’t as bad as my first.
“John…”  Sherlock protested as he found himself pushed backwards towards the bed.  Tripping over the edge he fell on his back and found John climbing on top of him.  “You don’t want this… With me.”
By this time the grass was a mess.  It was alarming the amount.  But John was more concerned for Sherlock’s health.  “What do you need?”
Sherlock leaned in closer so only John and Mary could hear.  “Prima Nocta.”
“We can adjourn to my room.”
John was pulled out the door with only a backward glance at Lestrade.
John grunted and pulled the blankets over them.  “I’m not going anywhere.  I’m your paramour, remember?  My place is here with you.”
It wasn’t fair, but as many a tutor pointed out, “Life is rarely fair.”  If life was fair he could claim John as his husband… If John wished it.
“And I mean it, John.  Anything you need.  Take it.”
With a weary sigh John crawled onto the bed, placing a hand on Sherlock’s thigh to move it aside and assess the damage.  “Chafing.  How long have you been at it?”
“Goodnight John.”
With a heavy sigh he walked away and we did not speak of it again.
John pondered Lestrade’s words as he watched Lady Mary dance gaily with one of the festival revelers.
“It’s a lie.”
“Why?”  John stared at the hand.
“He was supposed to be back an hour ago.” John answered, leaning back in the chair.  “He mentioned having a quick errand this morning during breakfast and then he was dressed and gone.”  The doctor glanced at his watch.  “Our appointment is in thirty minutes.  Maybe he’s already there.”
“Perhaps it’s for the best…” John whispered, holding Rosie tightly.  “A child needs their mother.”  A warm arm wrapped around his waist and a kiss was placed on the back of his head.  “But what if they harm her?”
John leaned against my warmth.  I held him close, my hand resting on the back of John’s neck as my other hand braced John’s arm.  The man shook silently with sobs.  “It is what it is.” I murmured, tightening my grip and lightly kissing the top of John’s head.
John scowled at the simple answer to his fearful question.  If they weren’t going to kill him, what would they do to him?  Would it hurt?  His fingers fumbled over his buttons as he undid he shirt and shrugged out of it.  “If I’m taken to your realm as a sacrifice… Won’t people notice that I’m gone?”
“Fuck…” John breathed as he gripped the sheets with his fists.
“Are you going to give us any supplies?  I need lubrication… Hello?”  John asked.
I shook my head again.  “There is nothing to live for.  You hate me.”
I craned my neck to look up at him.  There was a seriousness in his eyes that faded into pity.
“No, wait!  Stop!”  John pushed my head gently away.
“Then why are you doing this?”  Sherlock demanded.
“Sherlock, are you listening to me?”
“Mycroft was here and he showed you the notebook.”
“Buggery.  I think I mentioned that.” Sherlock stated.  Seeing John’s shocked look, he shook his head.  “It does not matter.  We can try again later.”  The detective did not bother with putting his clothes back on as he took his position in the bed.
“We’ve been married for six months.  You have never suggested a date before now.  In fact I’m not even sure it’s something you would do.”
“Mary…” John whispered, staring at his wife.
Sherlock lightly ran his fingers through John’s hair.  “I don’t mind.”
“You’re serious?”  John queried.
“I have a room at the local inn.”
“Yes… it means that I claimed you, apparently… that no other werewolf can have you.”
“We have three hours.”
“No!”  John interrupted him.  “You are going to lay down on that bed and I am going to shag you silly.
John lightly kissed Sherlock’s ass cheek before pulling back up the pants.  “I care.”  His hand wrapped around Sherlock’s erection and he began to wank the other man.  “She can’t watch.”
Watson mutely nodded, his eyes closed.
“Yes, of course.”  Lestrade replied.  “Go back to… whatever you were doing.”
“How did you know?”
Across from her sat her father with a triangle of toast and a mug of tea.  “Rosie?”
“No… you’re not.”  John grinned.  “But with the right mate you could be.”
Despite her own experiences, Mrs. Hudson enjoys attending weddings. So far her favourite has been Mike and Molly’s, though Kitty and Stan’s was wildly fun.
The Princess took two steps, and Ireni yanked him towards her. “Catch up with us after you finish him.”
Eventually Molly wriggled away, her hair dripping. “That’s ENOUGH!” She shouted. Her eyes were clearer now, and there was a fire in them Grezzik hadn’t seen in quite a while. “Where is he?
John started unwinding a bandage. “Well, I’m sure you’ll figure it out.”
He always called her Molly, unless she was in trouble.
“Thank you, sir.” Anderson had removed his guard uniform, and was wearing a simple white shirt and breeches. “I’ve brought all the intel you requested.”
Grezzik blushed. “It happens every once in a while. Jump down, and I’ll catch you.”
“I rather think you better.”
Sally dragged Anderson out. “Can we come with you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“A little. It’s not quite gone, but—but I think it’s going.”
"Just like it's something I never thought that I would want," Sherlock answered. He added quickly "and I do want it, John, of course I do."
After all, the upstairs bedroom at 221b Baker Street was perfectly comfortable
Sherlock raised the blade, rested the point against his aching heart. He closed his eyes…
"Let me check for you" John hummed "And we'll concern ourselves with the why later." He gently stroked his thumb across Sherlock's cheek, marvelling at Sherlock's ability to completely get stuck into a case. "Wait a moment, will you?" John said and was gone.
Sherlock hummed. It really all seemed to boil down to 'You've brought this on yourself'. Having at least a few more information made the mess which was currently penetrating his life a bit more tangible, a bit more sortable. There still were too many elements of the supernatural involved for Sherlock taste but he could slowly find workable angles.
"Hey, I wasn't the one killing you."
"What kind of mess is this?" John asked starring disbelievingly at the contents of the fridge. After a week of living like a human being in Sherlock's flat, he should be used to this. The first night he had found dissected mice on the kitchen table. The next day came with a loaded, historical revolver and four more holes in the wall. On day three, five human thumbs appeared in a bag in the vegetable crisper of the fridge. John didn't want to be judging, although he supposed that technically was his job. After all he didn't have a sensitive stomach, but he started to wonder how Sherlock could stay healthy within these living conditions. There were hazardous things strewn around the flat with apparently no concern. Day four started with Sherlock sitting behind the microscope and a foul smelling solution bubbling away on the stove. Day five and six saw experiments with the thumbs from day three. Now, there was a whole severed human head staring at John. He had dealt with a lot of things in his days, he was the devil after all but Sherlock's flat was a whole other kind of hell.
“Pardon me if I don’t fully understand then” John huffed, hands sinking to his side.
"To find out what people feel guilty about? Sure" John smirked "Hoping to figure out why that man was chosen then?"
John chuckled "Of course not."
Molly squeaked even louder and hit John’s arm excited, leaning in closer “Tell me more. I need to know everything. That’s the most interesting gossip since the beginning of my first term when someone said he had auditioned people for an orgy.”
---- End of Act 1 ----
Just when the pale eyes were flicking up and down his body, John was somewhat awoken from his stiffness. “Sorry, is there something wrong with my clothes?” he cleared his throat and stepped back as far as his door would allow, trying to get a bit of distance between himself and the other.
"Of course she would be" Sherlock hummed "Not religious. Probably has given her a right shock. Did she remember selling her soul or is that classified information?"
"He doesn't have friends." Sally said dismissively, "Did he follow you home then?"
Well, he probably spent a good portion of his life figuring out all the minor details which undoubtably lead him to the underworld. I mean there is only so much you can achieve in a legal setting and usually illegally it's quicker. My rough estimation would be that he at least spent the last twelve years actively pursuing his plan. How long have you been aware of his misdemeanour?"
"About five I guess" John mused, trying to think back to when this had started. He definitely hadn't known about it when he first made Sherlock's deal.
"Or he simply didn't do more than ask around which isn't normally something we worry about because then we wouldn't be able to do anything but follow up on all those people." John shrugged.
“Fine?” one eyebrow arched up perfectly as he looked at John doubtingly. John suddenly felt like caught in the headlights. He felt as if he was opening and closing his mouth like a fish out of water, unable to explain himself or even answer.
The Omega swallowed but did as the doctor had told him, trying to sit upright and as neat as possible which just made the Alpha chuckled more. Sherlock was confused and shuffled around on the armchair, feeling the blue eyes of the other burn their way across his body. He felt like every fantasy he had had during his heat was written plainly on his face and he bit his lip.
John huffed amused. That was some strange evening he was having, standing in the middle of the most talked about and feared student’s flat and being ignored. If he had taken it personally, his pride definitely would’ve been wounded now. He was beginning to question where all the rumours originated from. So far he had intruded in Sherlock’s flat without permission, hadn’t budged or shown himself out when clearly asked to and nothing frightening had happened. There were no biting remarks, threats to expose some weird, screwed up secret, bodily harm or some dark ritual going on he would be sacrificed in. Yes, students could be colourful when spreading stories.
John thought for a moment then murmured "I'm sure he was better before I came."
She had been the one to conduct the initial interview when John had applied after returning from service and physical recovery. In the beginning, John had thought about taking her out. At the first glance she had been exactly his type. Her hair was flowing smoothly down her back. She was confident, professional and intelligent. All the qualities John usually went looking for. This time though, he had done his best to build up a friendship. After the war, friends were very rare in his life and his therapist had encouraged him to change that. Now he knew that with Sarah it had been the better decision. They had grown close quickly and today John would be spending his evening on her hen night. Turns out, medical professionals had just as few friends as ex-army doctors and so John would play the proverbial cock of the walk. He really didn’t mind and even had volunteered for the duty of designated driver. There was nothing wrong with keeping a sober eye on three, by the end of the night, probably very tipsy women. Like this he at least knew that his friend could have a very carefree night out with her girls. Obviously, Sarah didn’t have a clue yet so John would have to keep his mouth shut for the course of the now apparently jointly spent lunch break.
"Come on, I told you way more of my day's work than necessary." Sherlock hummed "I'm sure there is at least a bit you can tell me."
"Perhaps I can help" John offered at the top of the stairs. He hadn't come down, first not to disturb Sherlock and then to not bother the police crew.
"Does it have to be something creepy like my soul or blood or could I just offer you some high energy food? I mean, energy equals energy, doesn't it?" Sherlock thought aloud. It seemed to be the logical conclusion.
“You did see me work previously”, Sherlock hummed, his own hands now working down John’s body and sneaking under the layer of his shirt. Feeling those long digits on the skin of his belly made John suck in a harsh breath.
The voice was deeper and sharper than in John’s memory. The other was also looking more impressive dressed in the defined lines of his black suit, which was masterfully tailored to his frame. John instantly decided he preferred the version he had met drunk in the dead of the night. Right now he could see how all the stories came to be, Sherlock was looking the part of an untouchable deity. Still, John had decided to help the kid and he would be damned if he didn’t try.
“Ruining you streak then?” John smiled sheepishly.
“Tell me where it is. I’ll have to kill it”, John chuckled, setting his pen down and closing the file on his desk.
Sherlock drew his eyebrows together in confusing and shook his head as if to force observations into their right spot "I'm… he's just my flatmate"
“Keep calm” John chuckled and made a calming motion with his hand “Do you have a crush on him?”
"Well, I just told you how you could and you didn't so why not finish your problem then and there?"
Sherlock grumbled a bit. It wasn't that he couldn't understand Lestrade’s point. Obviously, he couldn't hope for Moriarty to be tied down legally if the chain of evidence wasn't perfect. Moriarty had not only connections but also money which made it even more vital that no court had wriggle room. The problem was that Sherlock had the contract with John and something told him that the amount of trouble Moriarty had caused wouldn't have John stepping back. There was no way the devil would concede his influence to the police. Sherlock was stuck in an uncomfortable place. He needed his job. Getting his soul back but losing what he loved would have him back to the beginning of this miserable tale. There wasn't any other way for him to act now, he had to hope he could figure things out later.
“Yes”, Sherlock breathed, mind already blissed out on hormones by the bit of snogging they had indulged in. He felt incredibly light and damn aroused. At the moment he couldn’t come up with a time outside his heat where his cock had been so hard, straining against his trousers.
"I don't know. Earn you money. I heard that a lot of humans are after that, seems really popular." John raised an eyebrow and smirked.
“So beautiful”, John marvelled and kept stroking lightly until it would become too much. Then he just held the other against his chest, dropping kisses to his face, helping him calm down again.
"I'm sure he's careful." John offered. It probably was a weak support.
"It's not my place to judge, we have all sorts around here." Mrs Hudson put her hands up and smiled, "Go upstairs, I'm sure Sherlock can show you everything you need. If you have questions, just pop by downstairs."
"Yes" the devil nodded "Like I said: If I hadn't exhausted all my options, I wouldn't be here."
"I would just like to try myself at it and perhaps, well you could drum up some private business." John shrugged and grabbed a few more files from the stack. While the first one had been impressive already, he was sure Sherlock had managed a few more genius feats.
“It wasn’t even close to this” John growled, his fingers battling with the closures to Sherlock’s trousers. It might look good but it was ridiculously complicated to get it out of the way.
Perhaps the please or the moan managed to penetrate John’s mind enough for him to release his aching fingers, grasping for that lithe body on his lap as if it was a lifeline in stormy waters. The skin felt incredibly smooth and for a moment John just lightly ran his fingers over it. This had been what he wanted to do, hadn’t it? It should be enough but he wanted more. A glance towards Sherlock’s fogged eyes told him, he wasn’t the only one feeling that way. Deftly, he used one arm around the other’s waist to support him before bringing his hand up rub at a nipple which just had been sitting in front of his face too teasingly. The loud moan was sufficient encouragement for John to continue, letting his hand explore Sherlock’s body while he watched the beautiful face contort in pleasure.
In a huff, Sherlock turned back to his research, tuning out whatever else John was about to say. He didn't need a nanny but apparently he had gotten one for free when he had ordered the devil to stay. Initially, he thought the tedium of existence would grind the devil down, make him give up information easier but as it turned out, the devil was absolutely fine with boredom. Sherlock on the other hand was not. The first two days after turning Lestrade's archives upside down, he had eagerly waited for the next victim to appear. Whenever he got on a case that usually was how things went but then, this killer didn't even know the police was onto him, yet. He had gravely underestimated the time he might have to waste until another person was snatched. John on the other hand had fallen easily into place as a human. It had taken him a day or two to figure out the minor details but Sherlock had to admit, he was surprised at how comfortable John seemed. He just blended into the background perfectly, Mrs. Hudson having taken an immediate liking to him. Sherlock wanted to ridicule the average looks and behaviour but it was so much more effective than expected. The devil didn't like to draw attention to himself and that was what he managed, perfectly so. A being more powerful than humans could comprehend was wandering between them, buying tea at Tesco’s, ordering take-out and smiling softly at things he found amusing. Sherlock couldn't wrap his head around it but somehow that disparity of what he knew to be true and what you could see, made his situation much more interesting. He knew he had to focus on the case but he couldn't help but wonder what lay beneath some decisions the devil made. After all, he was sure, the other could have come in whatever form imaginable.
"Thank you." John kissed him hard. "Let's go get Anderson. Do you know where the Zoo of  Death entrance is?"
Sebastian blinked. “What?”
Holmes got up and approached carefully. “Are you certain?”
Sherlock couldn’t believe it. They were rising into the sky, pulled only by a giant with tireless arms.
“Pff” she brushed it off “Not more than everyone, I mean he is gorgeous, yes but too rude to actually be crush material. No, he’s someone you admire from afar and certainly something to fuel the bad boy fantasies of nearly everyone but that’s it. You never actually want to come near them. Still, tell me how you’ve met him”
"You two can come too, and you can go through the house and try to free the girls. I'll keep him chatting, make sure that he's distracted, and I'll keep an eye out for book hiding places. Did your informant say it was in his office?"
“Please tell me you have footage.”
John held him another minute in silence. "Love, what's the opposite of denfestration?"
Sherlock raced towards the group, sparing only a second to look for traps. You didn’t need bars for traitors; only a locked door.
Cheers,
Bradstreet's eyes shone. "Thanks, John. And for goodness sake, Arthur is fine."
Sherlock snorted. “On how soon she finds out that Stan was here this afternoon asking if we thought she’d say yes.”
"Alright, everyone get in," Ireni ordered. "We have a kingdom to save!"
“You’re lying!”
Holmes, about to become Mrs. Watson. She would be beautiful.
When Mary Morstan was six,  Father fell down the stairs. If there was anything suspicious at all about his death, none of the neighbours said a word. Mummy had to talk to some policemen, but they said that no one was in trouble. It might be best, one of the lady police added, to move somewhere else, where there were flowers and nice people. They moved the next day, and Mary was much happier, because she didn’t have to be afraid anymore, and Mummy was home more, and the two of them planted a garden.
So there be discussion of sex ahead but no...actual sex. Still, this chapter might be...slightly higher than Teen? Just a warning.
Once they were at the top, John clapped his hands. “Welcome to my surprise.”
The shooter stepped forward. “You need to get down, Dr. Watson. Sherlock Holmes must be worried. You don’t really need to worry about the details right now, do you?” His tone was considerate, but John didn’t move. If this was a trap…
The Sicilian Crowd and Sally set off for the South.
“Wise, daughter.” The King shook his head. “Take him from my sight.”
“If Sally left of her own free will, she rightfully stole herself.” Ireni glanced behind her at London. “Well, I’ll do what I can. I’ve my own score to settle. And on the way, who knows? I might figure out your favour, Molly.”
“Riley—the guard, the woman who stole Waverly—she confirmed it.”
“I was going to suggest tying her up,” Sherlock replied. “And making sure that she’s not free until tomorrow. But fair play, we could kill her.”
Mr. Cecil Forrester came in then. “Are you ready, Mary?”
****************************************************
The man in black reached up again. “Well, that doesn’t help us become friends.”
Sherlock held John close, his chest tightening with every breath, every sob. "Please don't leave me," he whispered.
Moriarty sighed, looking almost gloomy. “I've known for about...oh, I'd say a month, now? Miss Donovan's an excellent spy. Tell her I'm trying to get rid of Sherlock and she's loyal as anything. I probably could have told her I was really Moriarty and not 'Rich Brook'...I doubt she would have cared.”
Apparently not, for the phone rang just as he was nearly finished with the last bit of paperwork before lunch. Greg groaned and answered it without looking at the caller ID.
“Yes, I am stupid. For not seeing that you’re clever. Clever and a coward.”
John didn’t let go of Sherlock the entire way up the single flight of stairs, and once they were in their room he settled Sherlock into the chair.
Sebastian flinched. “But it isn’t in a child’s hand, it’s an adult.”
"But what about the other girls?" Molly asked, eyes worried. "It's all well and good to say you'll hide Kitty here, but he has two of them on hand. What if..."
