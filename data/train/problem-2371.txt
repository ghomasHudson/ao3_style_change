"I invited him," Lestrade says to him. Sherlock stands silently by, waiting for Anderson to get over himself. "Look, we know it's him, so let's just get on with it. Sherlock?"
It wouldn't do any good to worry over a horse he can't calm. With a sorrowful glance to Redbeard, Sherlock shifts over a stall, the one that John is now opening. He remains near the door.
He hears the chair squeal over the floor when John sits down at the kitchen table. He must thank Epona for the fact that Mrs Hudson cleared it of all experiments before they arrived last night. Otherwise, John might think him too peculiar to associate with. Sherlock hums, passing by an ugly pea-green suit coat that used to be Mycroft’s. It’s much too big for him. He decides on a black jacket, taking extra long debilitating his choices so that John can eat the plate Mrs Hudson made for him without guilt of holding him up.
The voice strikes Sherlock through the blurs of wind rushing past his ears, past his focus on the clouds above, and past his general spacial awareness.
“That’s, that's not what I mean! You can get yourself hurt, you can be drowned or have your arm torn off-- Why are you like this? Why are you doing this?”
“You don't know what I'm talking about. You don't know what any of this
Moriarty is sitting behind his expansive desk, dark and thick wood lined with papers, little knick-knacks, and a potted plant that is new from Henry Knight. It’s a purple flower that accents the room well, tying the unrelated wallpaper to the desk. John feels as though he’s seen the plant somewhere before. At Hooper’s, the bakery in Skarmouth, when he was with Sherlock.
And Gladstone is still eyeing John.
John Watson stands on the rock, shoulders rolled back proudly, his hand cupped by Adler’s smaller ones. Sherlock feels a spark of something, watching the three hands together. It’s a familiar thing, that touch. It must be because John Watson has ridden at least five times before this year. Maybe more, but maybe he didn’t win before the start of those five years ago. Sherlock isn’t sure if Adler has always been the mare goddess or not. He doesn’t come to the Scorpio festival.
, and
“The Races only last five minutes,” Sherlock points out.
“Sherlock,” John says from behind him as he sorts through all of John’s clothes mentally, “the envelope, here by his pocket. There’s another one.”
Breathing heavily, he watches Hope’s face, a horrible betrayal of the tremendous pain he’s in, the great gouge out of the side of his neck.
“Well,” Moriarty says again, “the things I want from you are not appropriate to speak of on this beach. But that’s not me, that’s what Magnussen would say, the dear tool. I only ever wanted to talk with you.”
There’s nowhere else on earth he would rather be, not looking for Mycroft, not dashing about alone in Skarmouth or Tholla, not solving perplexing murders, not foiling Moriarty - lately, his life has been ruled through ‘
“Sherlock, darling,” John says, “I did tell him I wouldn’t hesitate.”
?” Hope asks, and slides closer, and Sherlock squeezes his eyes shut. Hope’s figure is nearly up against Sherlock’s entirety, smelling like fish, fish,
He could capture one. He could wait on the beach at night, with a harness of bells and mind of wit. What's cleverness going to do, when he's facing the devil, in the form of a man eating horse, twice as tall and large as a Clydesdale, or any island pony?
John has never said it. Never told Sherlock that it was Gladstone that tore into his shoulder.
He’d read those reports without a care, he should've paid attention, but they were so minute that he hasn't disposed of their content to make room, there must be
“None of them will be at the Yard now, mind a few who don’t drink. Barely five days until the Races, all these festivities? And give up fishermen for what— nothing? No one’s going to give something up for nothing.”
The miserable, lonely way that man had looked just last night, how John had seen him that way, sticks in his heart like sap. His chest squeezes just thinking of it.
“What’re you saying?”
Sherlock, personally, finds it appalling.
He makes it to the sand, and digs his hands in for purchase, the sand shifting under his fingers, and he struggles up the hill.
, Henry Knight, needs to be sold his thoroughbreds, and stalls must be mucked. Hay must be distributed from the dusty lofts, and water refilled. Maybe veterinarians need to be phoned in, if some mare has a twisted ankle or an overstretched tendon in her neck. Then Sherlock remembers that that last one is one of John Watson’s many jobs.

giant muzzle, shaking with the force it takes to keep the water horse still.
“Sorry, mate. He bought it out from the island. I’ve hit retirement age.”
There’s no way Sherlock can lord this over Mycroft if his brother is tried for unethical experimentation. Not like he couldn’t get out of it, though.
to,” Sherlock assures him, voice coming out high and defensive, feigning offense that John doesn’t think him to have any sense of agency. “John, I’ve been affected by you since we met,
Sherlock’s gaze flicks down to admire the rise of John’s hipbone, the gentle slope of his biceps. The shine of Sherlock’s semen in the dimness is tacky on John’s abdomen from where he’d lounged over Sherlock. John’s skin is poured of molten gold, warm to the touch, dizzyingly sweet when Sherlock turns over, leans forward and kisses him. His taste is the same, brilliant and alive and deep, except now it is sated where it was once hungry.
John’s slow pushes into Sherlock do nothing to stop the tightness in Sherlock’s throat, his stomach, his thighs - everything shakes. Sherlock fights a desperate sob, clinging to John. Oh, everything is agonizing - the expert snaps that John thrusts into him with, the relentless heat on his back from the twisted duvet, the dim glow of sweat on John’s face in the half-light.
A secret spot of his head, reserved for the most interesting of cases, hopes it takes ages.
“I hope the two of you are very happy together.”
“Stop trying to be rid of me, you’re doing terribly thus far.”
Just as the paint on John’s face had become a real set of features, so had the metal of the armor plating his thighs. His long boots, what are they meant to be made of?
Sherlock’s brain rushes to categorize everything, the feel of John’s hair brushing his cheek, John’s open-mouthed, sucking kisses to Sherlock’s neck, the wet heat of it all. John grinds down, a hard and demanding length pushing against Sherlock’s hip insistently - Sherlock chokes, met with rigid evidence of his effect on John. Oh, god.
Sherlock wonders if the silence is because John gets these comments a lot, and then berates himself for wondering. The way Hope is talking about Sherlock without addressing him, though he stands right by John, clearly not invisible, makes Sherlock feel very small. So, he shuts the feeling off altogether.
It is normal for Sherlock to be seen muttering aloud to himself at a crime scene, but significantly less normal for Sherlock to be seen talking to a toy-come-alive.
It’s a
The courtyard’s empty, anyways, so there’s nothing there that could break-- “Wait,” Sherlock rumbles to himself, pushing the cigarette back against his lips and taking a drag.

? It must’ve been well taken care of, still sharp enough to pierce flesh and crack open a woman’s ribcage. The ‘expert’ Lestrade brought in said that it was a genuine antique, without any signs of restoration work. But here it looks so sharp and bold, and nothing can withstand the test of time so completely.
Sherlock drops his leg off of John’s, tension gathering in his midsection. “No. Have

“Fine,” Sherlock snaps, “you're life-size in
“You think your employer would be thrilled at that?”
He’s afraid of speaking because he could bite off his tongue each time Gladstone lurches forwards and to the ground.
“They’d have to be fairly wealthy for that,” Lestrade says. They all go quiet for a moment. No one wants to suggest his name. Anyone nearby could overhear.
Sherlock, snapped from his daze, struggles through the water and the sand to the dunes. He needs to get out. An easy meal, easy prey, something caught in the tide and being dragged out by it, a fragment of a shell torn by the water.
The room slows. The cracked ceiling and the curls of floral wallpaper fall away in Sherlock’s mind, giving space to a new, brilliant idea. The lights all fade and the house shivers, turning bright, and the officers disappear. The shag dissolves.
“You've given me this. Please, take it back.”
, Sherlock thinks at him,
In this temporary respite from the rain, he shivers. Cold air and wet skin don’t mix well. It’s as bad as the night he jumped into the quay. At least his skin is not sticky with salt. Not anywhere but his face.
Moriarty finishes his fiddling with the gloves, drawing a silver case of cigarettes out of the pocket. “Everything is at a price, Mister Sherlock.” A naked formality, giving him a title, Sherlock is sure.
At once, Sherlock adores him.
The man with the missing fingers is shaking on the beach by the water’s edge. The sea laps at his back with every small surge, and the gulls are crying out again above like nothing has happened and no time has passed.
John has failed to answer immediately, but now his brows raise quick in surprise, his shoulders tensing as Sherlock begins to walk, spinning them in a circle, with his eyes focused directly into John’s.
John reaches out, running his fingers along the bumps of stones in the wall. He looks over his shoulder up at Sherlock, a bemused expression on his brow. “Have you ever…
The next cab pulls up to the curb, and Sherlock ducks in, holding his collar lightly to his throat as he sits, giving the address to the cabbie. They pull away from Baker Street, swerving into the lines of traffic in late-afternoon London streets. Sherlock checks his mobile, trying desperately to pretend this is a usual, normal taxi ride to a usual, normal crime scene.
“Your father?”
Slipping his hands into his coat pockets to protect them from the chill deeper than his gloves do, Sherlock turns away from the sea and follows John’s form down the rocks. He can taste the cold weather in the back of his throat.
It snaps open its mouth and wails, missing Watson's fingers by a hair, and Watson stabs through its pinned ear. The wailing doesn't falter - the gouge didn't hurt at all. The blade wasn't iron.
Moriarty never meant to leave the cliffs alive.
Yes. There needs to be a direction in place, a point to follow. And it exists somewhere in this house. "Mm. Feeble-minded yet highly-paid detectives for New Scotland Yard. Police." He quirks his brow, thinking. "Like... knights. Except they solve crimes, and they follow mountains of regulations."
Sherlock elbows his way past the race official that begins to give him a semblance of congratulations, dragging Redbeard by the reins back towards the finish line. His lips, cracked with salt, part, his chest heaving, frantically scanning the crowds of finished riders here.
The stable doors are closed but unlocked, rolling in their tracts as Sherlock pushes them open enough to slip inside.
John ‘get-your-pony-off-this-beach’ Watson.
Downstream, a tremendous crashing over the length of the river. Enormous amounts of water tumbling over itself like sea waves, like breakers beating at the shoreline.

Sometimes, he’d feel like that if he were high, scratch at the crook of his arms until they bled. He still has needle-marked scars, and broad scratches, just there. It’s one of the reasons he prefers long sleeves to short ones or rolling them up, why doing so makes him so uncomfortable.
In Sherlock, Moriarty believes to have found his other half.
He was ready to walk away from a murder scene, just to get to John on the cliffs. Granted, it was a very boring murder, more boring than the last one, three years ago, and easily solved, but he was still ready to walk away from it. Horrendous, that his life has come to this, Sherlock thinks, as he catalogs the texture of the
“I wasn’t--”
Sherlock diligently watches John’s face for another weathered twitch or nervous smile. John’s strudy blue eyes squint against the bright clouds and wind, but nothing else. Sherlock follows him into the cave, the rocks beneath his boots crunching against each other with ever step. Were it high tide, the pair of them might have to swim inside, but now they can walk in with only minimally dampening their shoes.
A shoulder here. An ear there. Half of a foreleg; part of a nose. As if the waves rob their physical forms, recasting them in sea foam.
To his immense surprise, John’s shoulders slope. Relief. “I was joking about the kicking-you-out bit. I wouldn’t. I’m…” John scratches the back of his neck. “Yeah. Don’t - you don’t have to look like that.”
“Wayne Redding, yeah?”
Sherlock isn’t actually here, he’s not a part of the grieving members, and he hasn’t an integral part, like Father Stamford with his island fantasies and his introduction to eulogies, or John with the
Lestrade stands at Sherlock’s side outside the Yard’s white fencing, arms crossed. He fixes John with a meaningful look. “Mainland bloke like that, most of them pack up when they’re done here. Go back.”
Sherlock investigates the empty house, John shadowing him like a nervous estate agent. John hangs Gladstone's broken bridle over the mantle, unwashed and smelling of saltwater.
.” This cannot be compromised. He already had no say in where or when this rendezvous would occur. He must gain an advantage quickly into the conversation. That cannot be done if Moriarty brings John into the workings.
Exclamations are screamed out, and everyone is looking at John and Gladstone - the ones that haven’t left. They should’ve all left, Sherlock should have left, but—
His eyes are light blue today, not like tidepools or shallow waves, but like open Thisby sky. Like Mrs Hudson’s teapots, like Redbeard’s faded saddle pad.
Sherlock forces these things from his mind, intently watching John pull his pants and chosen riding trousers on, ones with dark leather patches sewn along the inner thighs. Would it be so terrible to close the curtains and stay in bed until the evening, and forget about the Races?
“Hold off,” John says, sounding irked at being prompted. But they only have five minutes alone.
John is limping. Faintly. Left leg. Something jumps in Sherlock's throat - he caused this fight, he did, somehow, he was distracted and the mare took advantage and snapped at the stray, and with the taste of blood was impossible to calm, she hurt John and it’s his fault.
“I don’t know. I’d like to think I’m somewhat responsible for telling off Hope.”

“Do you say that because you're a priest?”
It was a fragment of a

Tongue in cheek, Moriarty shifts. He snarls, “Of course, Marcus Haverford was a mere distraction.”
“Had to run.”
Just like that night when he signed up for the Races, began all of this by putting his name on the blackboard, Skarmouth is alive.
“All of you - all of you, get out,” Sherlock repeats. Expert be damned, John will understand this sword. No clue where this sudden conviction in John’s talent has come from, Sherlock points at the door with his magnifying lens.
“It’s never--”
“On the beach, after Hope.” Sherlock frowns. Didn’t they discuss that this morning? The day has been so long. The station and Lestrade, the caves beneath Thisby, Gladstone, John. John, kissing him, touching his face, his tongue coaxing Sherlock’s lips to part…
“Sherlock Holmes and his island pony! Can I get a photograph?” Says a nearby photographer. Sherlock stares at Moriarty’s profile, and the cameraman snaps and flashes his photo, anyways.
A questioning lull. John will say it soon. He’ll have to mentally prepare.
John slips into bed beside him, twisting Sherlock in his arms to settle in for the night. He smells like drywall dust and carpet fibers, like outside wind and sand.
Stray dogs whine and scuttle under the cliffs and underfoot. Bells rattle on her saddle and her breastplate as she shifts her weight, preparing to rear.
“You think I'm
John smirks, and slides the flat of his forearm down behind Sherlock’s back, trapping his arm between it and the duvet. He grips Sherlock, enabling him to draw closer and make Sherlock arch. His hips press down over Sherlock’s, and the stiff line of his erection slides luxuriously against Sherlock’s through their trousers. A moan punches itself out of Sherlock’s lungs.
“I promised to race.”
The man on its back is grinning wide, and something sharp gleams long in his hand. If Sherlock pulls back, they would lose too much momentum and never catch up with the group plowing ahead. He whips the reins, hard, and the pinch of pain snaps Redbeard out of his panic. His legs lift and plummet down with ferocity.
“Mister Holmes--” Begins the official, yellow bouquet outstretched towards him.
John says, “It’s no trouble.”

“Thought you didn't do charms, John.” Says the black-haired man loudly, grinning. He must've known the short man was going to be expert at handling the deadly blonde mare.
The fireplace snaps, and John stands, dusting off his hands like a carpenter. He smiles crookedly, Sherlock’s favorite kind of smile, “Better?”
capaill
A tuft of light hair, caught in the teeth of the zipper on her side.
Sherlock pulls him to the south. The weak Thisby grass grows thick on the side of the road, which makes it really more of a path than anything else. It brushes up to Redbeard’s knobby knees, blades broken and bent where very few cars have run over it. Southern Thisby is like one giant field.
Sherlock hesitates. He reaches a hand down into the courtyard, lying the back of it flat on the plywood.
, and
John’s gaze, glancing him up and down as if sizing him up for a meal, stops him from speaking anymore. His mouth moves a little, but he says nothing else.
Startled by such a genuine reaction, Sherlock gleans over the man again, still frowning. The clever one? Has John been talking about him? His heart leaps.
Sherlock grits his teeth and digs his heels into Redbeard’s side, unwilling to topple off Thisby like this. Mistaking it for the command of a run, Redbeard leaps into action, bursting away from the cliff edges and splattering gravel as he bolts inland.
“Small enough dosage, maybe he wouldn't have noticed it. Tarts at Hooper’s are usually very sweet.”
John seems stricken for a moment, and then he smiles kindly. “I’m worried about
Abruptly, a set of hands lays into him - no, no, his shirt, and the glint - Sherlock sees, his eyes burning against the saltwater in his failing attempts to claw to the surface - the glint of a knife. He squeezes his eyes shut, and feels the tension on the other end of his collar release.
The effect is immediate.
More often, he’ll ride Redbeard. It's always good to feel his stallion under him. He only takes the Ford when he’ll need the room in the backseat for something. And then he has to chase out the barn cat Musgrave, who makes it her business to get black fur all over the seats, or scratch gauges into them when she's bored. Mrs Hudson says she’s like him, like that, which is an allusion he despises.
Then, the Stockyard owner asks, almost peacefully, “What's the matter with you?”
“This is not a
John appears to sense this. He grips Sherlock’s hand. Tightly. His fingernails dig lightly into the back of Sherlock’s knuckles, holding onto him.
There is no gentle sway of Gladstone’s hips as his rear legs hit the ground, not even to a small degree. Neither is this a four-beat walk. It’s a few steps and then a high, throaty wheeze, and Gladstone does not ease into the gallop - his strides lengthen with no effort, and suddenly, they’re soaring.
“You’re right,” Murray says instantly. “It’s that Sherlock Holmes.”
John gestures around himself with his tiny arms, pointing at the castle walls, like it’s obvious. Sherlock supposes it is obvious. But John hadn’t been in the castle during this time in the interval, he’d been in the case that had come to rest in Sherlock’s pocket.
. Now, I

No point in sitting at home when there’s something

Gladstone waits, reins tied to the bicycle posts out the side of the cathedral, his nose brushing the quivering grasses near his hooves. There is no intention of eating them. His eyes regard Sherlock while John draws the resting circle around the
before. They don't look like that.”
The stranger enters the open notary door.
Water, water, he needs a glass. Setting the metal down carefully onto the countertop as to not wake Mrs Hudson in the rooms down the hall, Sherlock goes about opening a cabinet with shaking hands. He finds a clean glass and rushes to the tap.
Racing ahead is the figure, who takes a split down a narrow alley across the quay. Sherlock follows the turn, the streetlights sharp blurs on the pavement he quickly covers. This man is fast, but so is Sherlock.
“You can’t race one of those things.”
The churchgoer and Gladstone are near the back of a squat of old stone buildings. The churchgoer is holding Gladstone’s reins up high, like John instructed him, and the water horse, along with being physically held, is charmed to stay in place by a circle drawn in the dirt and road gravel around him.
“Don’t you have a

Lestrade steps into the room, infinitely tolerant of Sherlock’s antics. “Got anything?”
Gun oil and smoke, a heavy metal barrel pushing into Moriarty’s temple.
“After you patronized me over
“What?” Too fast.
Alarmed, though satisfied, Sherlock sits back, giving more rein to Redbeard to let the stallion relax. It doesn't work. Redbeard whines, and seems to regret it when the
It isn't real. Mycroft is real and has always been right, Sherlock will find another John Watson.
“What are you worried for?” John asks.
He's distantly aware of a jacket draped over his shoulders, leaving his arms uncovered. He's shivering. His wet hair drips potent saltwater down the back of his sodden collar.
Just past her is none other than John Watson, his trademarked jacket hanging worn and well over his shoulders as if salt had never touched it. His hair is not laying flat due to the wind from outside. His cheeks are pink, too, as if he was cold. He’s wearing gloves and his boots, but nothing else that would entail this being a cold-weather outfit.
Is Mrs Hudson in? There’s a faint, pungent reek of herbal soothers downstairs. Mrs Turner must’ve been over last night for cards. He locks the front door, too, because Lestrade doesn’t have a key, and it won’t do to have Mrs Hudson exposed to the mad fray of London’s people.
Young Sherlock had looked back down at the carnage on the beach far below the cliff. Far as he knew then, the Races and their mysterious horses were all Thisby had. How could they be the end of it?
“Oh, god, you’re an idiot,” comes John’s voice, and Sherlock peers up from the ground through wet hair smeared across his face. He pushes it back, squinting at the rider, who bends.
John nods.
Watson--
The girl from the Langely case, the one who’d given him the castle and the box, had said that there were rooms in the castle, for the figurines. Sherlock had observed them when he'd accidentally knocked off the roof of a tower last month. But she’d only given him one figurine, the knight. Well, the box for him.
John touches his hand to Sherlock’s arm, pulling him gently and softly away from the
Sherlock looks, but a name is mentioned nowhere on the page.
Sherlock sniffs and turns away. “Here's your thermos.”
“It was, John. I’ve seen his teeth and I’ve seen your shoulder.”
to run alongside dozens more of them. To think he could win on cleverness alone! He grits his teeth. He’d be a fool.
Sherlock looks hard and away. He watches two waves smack heads together, down far below. They wash over the pebbles on shore. For this answer, he is unsure. He feels like paper carried away on the wind, something temporary.
Sherlock continues striding confidently, “I don’t know. The father of the rider acted in a very peculiar manner.”
“We need to find something on the identity of the killer. Anything that will give him away. Find out why he has your sword, why it’s changed,
really makes you look like a champion,” John smiles. He searches the crowds around them, and steps as close as Gladstone will let him. The people nearby give the water horse a wide berth, moving about well out of striking range and taking photographs of the five-time winner, seven-time racer with flashbulbs. At least there’s breathing room, now.

Watson smiles, and Sherlock hopes against hope that he’ll-- “Sherlock. And my name’s John. Some people call me that.”
“Then you wouldn’t mind racing me.”
He gets up but groans, his clothes caked with salt. Serves him right, putting his trousers from last night back on. Beneath his buttoned coat, however, he's wearing John's small jumper, it's warmer that way. That's all. His shoes are still damp. He's been in the bakery for several hours.

“Bike or car?”
is naked affection. A soft palm laid over the back of Sherlock’s hand, fingers gently curling to caress his knuckles. Sherlock’s heart is a racing horse in his chest, the hooves loudly thundering past his lungs, his throat closing up in panic and emotion. John
“Of course you're not racing! We’ll be making good and sure of that.”
John stops. “What?”
“You are selfish, wanting a man,” Moriarty says. Sherlock bites his tongue. “We could be so good together. We could talk.”
“Was afraid you wouldn’t like it.”
On his giant water horse, Hydria, Hope wishes he made an imposing figure. He doesn't. Hydria is a smooth grey beneath him, with flanks tinted with darker browns and flecked with white, not unlike all the whitecaps that beat the rocks below the steep drop of the cliffs. Hope looks like hot iron, with deep bags beneath his eyes. Just over his cheek is a spot of purple, painted on by John's fist at the festival (this is thought with an inappropriate amount of thrill). Even from here, Sherlock can see yellow skin healing the edges. There is a man with a lean, hard frame, and squinting blue eyes riding up alongside him on a chestnut water horse, with half of its mane rubbed off and the tail mangled and knotted. Over both of the water horses, there are draping red and white tassels, and flowers razing what little hair they have.
He pauses a long heartbeat, coat collar blowing against his neck, before all possible decisions on how to make the trip have made themselves known to him. He hums and steps to Gladstone’s side, reaching up to untuck the stirrup and drop it down a length. Where his hand brushes his pelt, Sherlock can feel the deep thrum of ocean magic.
And Sherlock spends his days on the grassy cliffs, watching the beaches from sunup until sunset, breathing the salty air, and languishing in the weakening overhead sun. But it's worth it, to sit beside the scant trees that harbor seabirds and to scan the ocean, watching boats and ferries come in to the quay. When the whitecaps beak and roll over, crashing back into the blue mass of the endless plains of water, there may be the twitch of an ear, the spot of a nose, the beginning of a shoulder. But the parts are always gone by the time the waves settle.
John Watson nods, uninviting. “I saw what we came here for.”
“How did… Redbeard seem?” Sherlock ventures as John hands him a saggy old jumper. At least it looks warm, because the beige is certainly not pretty.
John Watson.
Some islanders say that the horses are all ghosts, after the Races. Seeking the land and finding no trouble, no hopeless men to drag away.
John’s hand is on him, pressing lightly at his lower back.
“You want to win the Races to find your brother and buy this house for your landlady?”
“I believe I have more to say to you. But, it’s late.”
If he thinks about it, there’s no real reason John had to accompany Sherlock in the car. Of course, he’s not about to point that out and say anything about it. Instead, he asks, “You didn’t happen to recognize the runner?”
John works off his jacket. “Take off your coat,” He says, “It’ll only make you colder. Here,” he helps Sherlock sit up. “Are you alright?” Hm. Sherlock doesn’t actually need the help sitting up, he’s exhausted, panting and cold, but not injured. He lets John help him up anyways, gentle hands coaxing over his shoulders as they sit in the yellow-cast semi-circle of a streetlamp, water snaking off Sherlock’s skin and into the cracks in the roadway.
Sherlock looks over his shoulder to the cliffs. He’s panting even if he didn’t run more than ten meters across the sand.
“And you’re Sherlock Holmes.”
Sherlock does not get the Ford out from under the tarp. He wades through the tall, dry grasses that sway in the wind towards the small barn. The barn cat, the ugly thing, follows at his heels. He begins to wonder if the thing has fleas.
“There are no others,” John says. He lifts his glass and takes a long swallow, then sets it down with a noise against the wooden bar. “Only you.” He wipes his upper lip with the back of his hand. Sherlock can hear the stubble and skin when John scratches his cheek.
Very aware of Gladstone’s presence and the blood on his still quivering muzzle, Sherlock plays dumb. John is fantastic when he’s clarifying something. He pulls higher on the broken reins, and Gladstone’s face turns, mouth closed, one eye regarding Sherlock. “Of what?”
The knight does not respond.
“Whenever we go out to swim the
“Like you aren’t already aware, Doctor Watson,” Moriarty says, puffing out his cheeks and rolling his eyes as he plays with the knife in his hands. He seems unbothered by John’s proximity. “Connections, connections, all across the island, you both have. Why would I want to lose both Holmes and that black horse? However would I eat his heart then?”
Sherlock finishes, “I would come back. I
“Give this to him. Presently.”
,” Sherlock admonishes, offended. Mycroft would look down his long nose at his choice, raise a lip, and sneer that a life at the mill was better than no life at all. There is no room to disagree with his brother. He could ask Mrs Hudson to let Mycroft know if he dies, but it’s no use, he recalls that was the whole point of racing in the first place.
“Want to go see the dead man’s photographs?”
“I know it’s windy.” Sherlock nods. John must feel Sherlock’s hair on his face, because he takes a moment to lean back, letting go of the places where his hands are, hip and horn, and tucks the longer curls at the back of Sherlock’s skull into the popped collar of his jacket.
,” His adversary grins. He folds his hands over the table, over his book. At the touch, he seems to remember that it’s there. He runs his palm over it, like he is touching a new lover’s skin, and is sure to find Sherlock’s eyes as he slowly picks it up, and cracks it open. “I love these,” he says, “These
There’s near forty horses and equal men, and Sherlock cannot picture anyone but the riders that didn’t make it. Hope, the man John shot, the casualties in the first week, the murdered boy.
Moriarty stands over him in the same way the white mare had stood over Gladstone in last year’s Races.
Sherlock breathes. He thinks of Watson and his uncanny ability to calm and to tame sea.
“Well, clearly I’m young and fit enough to do it now, so it’s not a worry any longer.”
“Yes, this was the murder weapon,” Sherlock asserts. His eyes flit down the blade, calculating what angles it must’ve been thrusted at to achieve the wounds it inflicted in the other bodies. He mentally pictures the previous victims, fitting the sword before him into their bodies, the ragged, deep lacerations they all suffered to the chest. A perfect fit. His technique never changed. “If you test the dried blood by the hilt you’re sure to come away with more than just Shadwell’s. But now he’s left it.”
An American buyer asks to see him out on a white half-blooded mare he’s interested in purchasing, and so this conversation is full of half-hooded meaning.
“If I promised you
Lestrade walks through the rows of shelves, eventually bending low to retrieve a small wooden box, and setting it onto one of the desks in the room, a deep mahogany.

“He’s managed to convince me it was.”
“I told the truth, John.”
“That may be the case,” Sherlock rebuffs, “But my
Redbeard has never been so shaken - he’s like a newborn foal. His legs quiver - the front are splayed, and he’s leaning back, ready to seize and bolt, his ears are swiveling rapidly, slashing through the air in response to too much stimuli, and Sherlock can see the air puffing out, cold and fast, from his tensed mouth.
“Moriarty had one of those,” John says.
. Not a native plant, something brought, imported, delivered.
The insults and insinuations hurled at him in the streets multiply ten fold. There’s explosive talk of him being disqualified, and his stomach curdles, but Sherlock always snaps back, “If it’s
It’s a tall man. There’s a scarf pulled up over his mouth and nose, and once, Sherlock could’ve been fooled into thinking it was protection from the temperature, but inside the station, Sherlock knows it’s for a semblance of disguise.
Sherlock sometimes gets to Skarmouth, the nearest town on the island, by taking the rusting, very old Ford out along the dirt road that leads through miles and miles of sparsely grassy, cracked earth.
He looks over to Watson. Gladstone is twisting and anxious below him, hard to hold. Sherlock again imagines that Gladstone can understand what’s about to happen, wishes he'd seen him in the Races before. When he starts picturing how striking John must look when he's putting immense effort into a race, he has to stop and push the cold back of his hand against his cheek to cool it off.
“John!” Sherlock’s grip loosens, terror overriding rational thought.
Sherlock cuts him off, “You're rambling.”
“Up, John!” He insists, whirling into the kitchen, suddenly unable to look at bleary-eyed John, sitting up so similarly to the way he had in the middle of the night. He shoves the forgotten pistol into one of the drawers. “We have much to do today!”
“He was here about the house, wasn't he? About the mortgage.”
"No one will say it around Moriarty, but the lot of them think you're brave."
But Murray has pegged John wrong, because it isn’t the horse he loves.
She could be further up the beach.
Sherlock nods, looking away in the direction Hope rode in from, expecting to see the chestnut brown again.
“That’s not a very good answer.”
Sherlock has to clear his throat, his face flushed.
Quietly, John says, “Shall I ask about it?”
Hm. “Older cultures used aconite for hunting, lacing the tips of arrows or spears for paralyzing the animals. Drowned countless whales that way.”
“You’ll - you’ll be bored, John. I can’t, I’m not the Races.” Sherlock can’t offer that. He can’t watch John find another
Perhaps John isn’t coming. After all, Sherlock can honestly think of several hundred chores or things that the Stockyard would need to get done before the coming rain. Horses need to be turned out, that damned
“Don’t be stupid. It doesn’t matter that I won. He’ll still--”
He snaps back to attention. John is looking at him, while Musgrave, stupid thing, butts her head against John’s fingers, hoping for a pity-scratch.
The wind that stirs the memory blasts him with cold October air and steals it away again. He pushes through the crowds. Tonight he would proclaim Redbeard as the horse he was true and really riding. The noise and the press of drunk tourists, loud with drink and excitement, and stone-faced locals shoving through the masses are far too much.
Had he had all the secret pieces, the snatches of interaction Sherlock seems to have had with Moriarty without him, he might’ve been able to argue for Sherlock’s safety, as well. But Sherlock told him nothing.

Gladstone’s hind leg lifts up, high, knee rubbing belly. It appears this horse got exercise yesterday, too.
entirely foolish and desperate. To tell the truth and say how very much he does
Skarmouth already smells of November cakes when Sherlock ties the end of Redbeard’s reins to the post in front of the Hooper Bakery. The stallion dips his head to drink the stale water in the trough just under the post.
Redbeard is panting heavily through his nose by the time Sherlock trots into town, passing first by the tall glass buildings that are owned by the Stockyard and serve as hotels for the wealthy tourists. Nicest place to sleep, be, stay, or exist on the island, Sherlock hears. A man is sweeping the stone steps as Sherlock passes.
A grip.
John thinks. “Perhaps you shouldn’t open it.”

“Hang on, I'm trying to make an analogy, here…”
don’t. But you all do. And it’s funny to take away the things you care about.”
Sherlock stops, not as alarmed as before, and shoves his hand into the broad of Redbeard’s chest, making him stop. He bends his head to peer out beneath Redbeard’s neck, and spots a great black shape, speeding towards them.
John looks back to the bar, face alight with a thought process.
“Can we speak tomorrow morning?” John asks.
They walk, the three of them, to a dramatic outcropping of rocks in the middle of Thisby’s brown-yellow and green pastures. Several small saplings are trying to poke through the cracks and humps in the rock, none over a meter tall, bending in the wind.
“What?” John shrugs off his jacket. The sight of his strong arms against his dark waistcoat makes Sherlock’s heart pick up. He is so unlike any of the other men on this island. John looks at the bed, and rubs the back of his neck, throwing the jacket over the chair with apparent disregard. “Yeah.”
choice.
Sherlock scowls. “Money.”
Burnt gunpowder. Blood. Asphyxiation. The carpet in his therapist's sitting room had been a terrible red against all the bleak whites.
Watson looks thoughtful. Sherlock rushes to accommodate, “It’s not much time. If you disagree,” He looks out towards the cliff edge, to the ocean far below, and waits for a lapse in the wind before finishing, “It’s only because you doubt yourself.”
the last man in line and the owner of the tourist trap of a shop, who’d left just before Sherlock stepped up, she poises her chalk.
Sherlock thinks. “I suppose that bit was dramatic.”
The idea sweeps away in the cool night air, gone as the breeze that rushes over the both of them through the cement aisle. It skitters loose pieces of hay out the other end. A
Sherlock blinks. He asks, “A rule sheet.”
And he doesn't.
He turns and grabs John’s head in his hands, his gloves protection against the cold as well as John’s bare skin. His hands slip lower to take John by the upper arms, gripping as intensely as John had pulled on him to hide from the file thief.
For a moment there is no answer, no expected exclamation of
He returns in the early evening. His biceps ache, and Redbeard’s legs tremble as if they were made of flimsy seaweed. Josephine snorts in the next stall over. Her stall has been mucked, it’s clear even in the blue wash of dusk. Sherlock scrunches up his nose, because Mrs Hudson really should let him do those things, she’ll throw out her hip again.
(the 'He doesn't invite Sherlock to be one of them.', and the 'Which is how they end up racing.' lines are right from the Scorpio Races novel, and they do race each other in the book - please read it!)
“‘Course.”
“Isaac Whitney, Altum. By my blood.”
In the dark, the stable seems closer than it did out the flat’s small window. No longer are there no shadows, every light in the Stockyard is on. Further down, past the large arrangement of stables and fences, Sherlock can see Skarmouth, far down the road. It is lit up and just a mound roofs on the lighter horizon, an eerie yellow glow in the sky betraying its placement.
“Surely, yours is.”
“Maybe he’s finally forgotten a line?” Anderson stage whispers to her.
Lestrade pushes out a long sigh, “I didn’t want to be the one to say this…”
“And, the Golden Knight,” The girl murmured. She handed over a small, rectangular wooden box, like a casket. It could fit in the palm of Sherlock’s hand. He went to open it, but she slapped her hands over the box. Sherlock looked up at her with affront, holding back his comments on account of recent events and Lestrade's presence.
In the light of the streetlamps and paper lanterns, with his arm outstretched, Sherlock can see the photographs fly down, all black and greyscale shadows, they are invaluable, he cannot lose them, and he makes a split-second decision before they even touch the water at the bottom of the quay, before the wind takes them.
The sound of the hallway-foyer door.
“The kind that likes to boast,” Sherlock says, “the kind that thinks it’s all a game. The kind that wants to be caught.”
The smell of old leather polish and perfume dredges through Sherlock’s senses, conjuring images of former passengers.
“And that’s the same man who stole the files? The photographs?”
The chestnut
“You appreciate me. You
John stills over him, wandering fingers trailing to a stop over Sherlock’s naked torso. Sherlock holds the duvet around them up higher, trying to find John’s face in the dark. Why has he stopped moving? Sherlock twitches, thinning his kiss-wet lips into a line.
Even if he took every odd job in the town, every steady one, and every part time one, he wouldn't make enough money to do even one of those things. Not in five years.
“Ho, big fella,” Hope says.
“Is it him?” He strides casually to the side and positions his body between the castle on the floor and Lestrade at the entrance. The DI won’t be able to see over the castle walls from his place, but the addition of a safety net relaxes Sherlock considerably.

I FINISHED MY SUMMER JOB!!!!!!
is trying. Not hard, but still trying. In the evening light, or, lack of it, Sherlock can see the determination and surprise written over the horse’s body, from his long pinned ears to his massive feet. The horse gains more head.
"Missus Hudson sells teapots. At that Murray’s place. That tourist trap he calls a shop.”
“I was almost afraid I’d never see you again after leaving you with my employer. Saw you talking with your friend there,” John nods towards the man lingering by the door, grinning a bit wolfishly while he pulls the stool out from beneath the overhanging bar. He seems to decide against this, a bit of a shift in his gaze, and pushes the stool away again.
“Oh, John--” Sherlock begins, but John gently tugs on his hand with both of his. Sherlock takes the hint, and stands up.
To clamber onto the back of a
He leaves his boots on, there’s always some maid or loose stablehand around and he enjoys being even a slight inconvenience to Moriarty. Striding down the expansive halls reminds him of the night before, of the officer’s building in Skarmouth, dashing through the rooms in search of evidence about to be stolen after a handsome enigma of a man…
“Maybe in 1938,” Sherlock quips, again disliking John’s mention of this woman. Rebecca has been dead since 1996, he’d glimpsed her obituary online, yet Sherlock’s skin crawls with something like jealousy. “And it doesn’t appear to be religious, at the very least not Christian or Judaic. Carbon-dating can be sure of the date down to the decade, but that takes ages.” Ages, as in days, as in too long.
“Precisely,” Sherlock pushes back the chair as he stands, “I’m the one who’s racing,” He rounds the table to stand beside the determined woman, “And you’re not. So,” He leans forward to brush a fleeting, fond kiss to the side of her face, “It’d do your kind heart well to stop worrying.”
There is no possibility of him telling John the complete truth. Not when racing day is so close; not when Moriarty is so near. Not when John still runs the risk of ruining things, of destroying his chances at gaining Gladstone or winning, should he be fully-informed.
“Do you have something to say?”
“Oh, but I’ve brought a housewarming gift!”
John says nothing and Sherlock flushes.
The notary uncrinkles the piece of paper, and Sherlock widens his eyes. The wind from the cliffs tosses Anderson’s parted hair, and Sherlock’s curls. It rips through Anderson’s costume, threatens to dislodge his great cape.
“So does everyone.”
“Really, Lestrade, it’s been grand, I’ll let you know as soon as there’s a new development,” he grins a big fake grin, like Musgrave, and shuts the foyer door. It wouldn’t really make the DI give up if he was set on the evidence not leaving the station, but it’s enough of a pointed, dramatic exit that Lestrade must be tired of it, and him, for the day.
The expanse of the rock isn’t small, but Hope sidles close anyways. He turns to the crowd, seeking a parody of jury appeal and attempting to look reasonable, “Some rules are just too big for paper.” He holds his hands out, like there’s nothing he can do about it.
Smirking, Sherlock tugs on his gloves, stretching the black leather over his knuckles. He scans the room, then crosses it, aiming towards the writing desk he'd spotted in the corner upon first entrance with Lestrade.
This surprises Sherlock from his thoughts. “We’ll go down here,” He says again, and releases Sherlock’s arm. There’s a spot of warmth where his hand has left Sherlock’s jacket, and it takes a few seconds of high-level self-control to not take up John’s hand to replace it on his elbow again.
Sherlock finally lifts his weight away from the cliff walls and approaches him. “Do you do fifths?” He asks.
TW for assualt? Though it's pretty in line with the rest of the story. Thought I would say it anyways.
There are drops of blood welling up in a gashed line, and the red begins to fall, seeping down easily as it is aided by the rainwater. It’s incredibly dark against the iron color of Redbeard’s fur.
It’s small, maybe capable of holding six bullets, a model from the mainland that’s at least twenty years old, and John is wielding it expertly, pointed forwards and into the distance. His arm is extended, his hair is damp and pressed down, the front sticking up in a ridiculous way that makes Sherlock think he ran Gladstone, fast, just to get here.
“All set?” The grinning handler says.
The cliffs will protect them, but there are ways down and up them. Ways stable enough for a water horse to clamber onto Thisby’s flat and dunes top. It happens in October.
“Can you… explain?” John's voice is soft. Sherlock bites into his tongue. Hard.
Gladstone’s breath picks up.
He runs his hand across the bumpy surface of the cavern. Several pieces of rock crumble away from the uneven wall at his touch, dropping off and onto the rough ledges, or bouncing into the shallow rocks further below. The paintings are too high up for him to touch.
“Where is John Watson?” Sherlock demands. No one understands.
Sherlock shakes his head immediately, running the pads of his fingers over the paper under the lamp.“No. This was left for you purposefully. He’ll have had ample time to construct a solid alibi for his whereabouts during the poisoning. If it was him. Anyone can steal the imprint for a seal.”
But lengths past the dead
“Mm.”
“Sorry about that misunderstanding, earlier,” The man says, and Sherlock can already guess what this is going to end as, “But it seems like no one wants to win the Races this year. Fifths, you said?”
Sherlock stalks across the room, eyes burning against the bright lights, and wedges his fingers beneath the window screen, tugging. Lestrade and Donovan’s heads swivel to watch him. He wrestles with the pane. Locked. Figured. He pivots back, new realizations jumping to the forefront. There was no sneaking involved in the killer's entrance.
It means he’s giving up, and Sherlock is most certainly not doing that.
“All these… they're wild. They're all new,” John nods his chin forwards, then points with his pencil down off the cliffs. “See the bay mare? And the one next to her? They’ve circles around them, but they're restless. They don't stop moving,” John’s mouth flattens, “They shouldn’t be down on the beach. The water’s too strong for them.” He returns the lead point to the notebook, scribbling something.
A month of his life, all culminating into five minutes. Thirty years of his life, all culminating into five minutes.
Moriarty sets down his book face down onto his desk. The span of the surface is covered in a myriad of small items. Astray, papers, a stamp, the dreaded wax seal that Sherlock recognizes instantly, a potted purple flower that matches the dark pattern on the walls.
“She doesn’t own a cat, look around you - no litterbox, no toys, no
Sometimes, in the endless waves that batter the offshore sandbars, the November currents dredge up forgotten things.
“Oh, right?”
In the mid-morning light, Sherlock watches John’s back while he walks away from the Ford, his mostly-clean-but-not-really jacket over him, fitting and framing him against the pale clouds perfectly. Sherlock watches him disappear into the stables in last night’s clothes, aware John’s mind has already turned completely to the events of today’s job.
John snatches a glance at him, then focuses his eyes back on the road. He’s not bad at driving at all, Sherlock decides, watching for a second the way his leg muscles work when pressing the Ford for more speed, the same way he presses Gladstone.
Tourists’ belongings aren’t recorded, though.
Hope’s grin is as sickening as ever, “You have your ride, I have mine.” Well. Sherlock looks back. Now he's just overusing that line.
The tourists and islanders stand out of the path of the giant water horse, an unending river of movement as they migrate, prepping for the final race of the year. The crowd consumes John’s shape, and then Gladstone heads down the sandy incline, disappearing from view below the chalk. The last Sherlock sees are his long ears, pricked and hungry.
“The same. It’s the same.”
Sherlock arranges his head on John’s shoulder. He rests a hand on John’s bare stomach, watching the fill of John’s lungs expand his chest, rising and falling, lulling and captivating. Repetitive, deep,
Sherlock snags someone’s arm. “Where is he?”
“When we get to the scene, make certain you don’t say anything.”
“Allow me to show you a real horse.”
Lestrade rolls his eyes, “You two knock it off, yeah?”
Footsteps, then John shouts from a little further down the street, away from the open line of the ocean. It’s all black to Sherlock. “Over here! Follow my voice!”
His skin is all gooseflesh- prickling up and standing the hairs over the back of his neck and his arms. If Thisby is made of island magic, he and John are surely made from it too.
The whisper comes through very close to John's right ear. It wakes him from a light doze, the near-haze he's been forced into by drugs for the last several hours.
Sherlock tilts his head and John’s lips slot against his. A fizzle of energy runs down Sherlock’s spine, new and inviting. The whirring in Sherlock’s mind, the variables and unknowns of the equation, stutter and spin to a stop.
He stands, knees shaky for a split second, then fixes his collar, smearing it with blood, sniffing the salt while he watches the barn workers arrange Hope’s body onto the white stretcher, just a piece of cloth between two boards. He had no family on the island anymore, his wife and children moved away, no one else besides the police may have come to collect him for the morgue. He will be buried on the middle of the island, in the old cemetery by the rocks, where sweetgrass doesn’t grow and no one ever visits. Sort of sad. But he was an ass.
He stoops by the coffee table, holding out his hand again.
Not enough to pay off the house.
Moriarty had said,
to one!” Someone else shouts, and the people in-the-know snicker as Sherlock passes. Everywhere, people are laughing and singing, drums are pounding, and elsewhere, a motorbike roars, and shrill fiddles play. There is no doubt that this is a festival.
“You’ve gone all croaky,” John says, “Have you got yourself a cold?”
He’s beautiful, brilliant, even in the dark. He’s the sun.
” Calls someone from the crowd.
John blinks, half his face cast in shadow from the lamp above them, hair all askew and cheeks flushed from running against the wind. “Oh. So,” he looks away, trying to wring the coat again, before continuing conversationally. "A...?"
“It’ll only be an hour, can you part with me for an hour?” John rushes through this sentence. John’s continued closeness, and his body language, suggest that it’s
After the crack of a gun, beating hooves tore up the always-changing sand. They ran the horses on the beach, a pale line between the churning sea and the chalk cliffs.
John draws in a sharp breath. Sherlock glances to his shocked expression. After a moment, John exhales, closing his eyes with a smirk playing over his thin lips. “It was you. I was right, you
“No one’s as clever as you. No one’s thought to look past the rules on paper,” Watson smiles, and Sherlock thinks, crossly, that he looks devilishly stunning and robust. Watson’s dark riding trousers and rolled-up white sleeves and his posture, upright and purposeful, make him look like he’s meant to be on Gladstone. Sherlock feels impoverished in an outfit just like that across from him. Perhaps it’s because Redbeard doesn’t make as imposing a figure. Both horse and rider are aware of it. That horse is absolutely enormous, even to one as tall as Redbeard. Thisby is a land of giants.
Sherlock purses his lips, indignant.
“Sherlock,” John prods.
57 Chemsworth Circle is in row with the rest of the adjacent houses, large, mint green (what developer paints a house mint green?), old colonial. Flashing police cruisers are parked in the drive and on the road, yellow tape being strung on posts around the property corners by a tired intern, and officers mill about, with a photographer taking pictures of the ground-floor windowsills. Sherlock must have missed the curious crowds of neighborhood residents that have come and gone. Thank god.
Somewhere outside, Sherlock can hear the drummers and the fiddlers playing loud, bounding Scorpio rhythms. He tried placing their whereabouts in his mental map of Skarmouth, but the noise is drowned out by the men in the tavern, and it becomes impossible to tell.
This reality may be better than his brief fantasy of a moment ago.
“Bargain? You have no money. What could I want from you?”
Sherlock couldn’t give a wit about the time. The sun is red, somewhere way below the horizon, and the rest of the sky is purpling and darkening.
After all of this, the murder, the intrigue, Moriarty, the buildup to the Races, their days and nights spent together, he is to assume all he is owed is a handshake? His heart begins to hurt, to ache, looking down at that extension of John’s arm.
“I know it’s me he wants, John, that’s what this has all been about. He’s deluded himself into the belief that we could be good together, as if we’re on the same level of intelligence.”
John looks to him while Sherlock sits up. The revolver has been tucked up, probably put against the small of John’s back, in the waistband. Safety on, naturally, though it must poke into John’s skin, seeing as how he is on a giant water horse. “Sherlock, are you alright?”
fear.”
Adler answers, in a voice not her own but that of the island, “Thank you.”
The rain pounds harder, Moriarty’s face betrays surprised delight, water rushing all down his visage.
John’s hand slips against his elbow as people part before Gladstone, wading through the crowd as easily as he does the sea.
He opens his eyes; they sting, but he can see the blurry form of Watson, and his hands, still red, like the water hasn't done a thing to the blood (blood?) on them.
“Yes, definitely.”
fragile.”
Sherlock blinks.
in.” Lestrade points between them, tucking the book under his arm. Gladstone looks at the movement of Lestrade’s hand. “Do I have to remind you, Mr Watson, about the by-laws in this town? You think I can’t figure how, exactly, Sherlock, you managed to see the bloke who picked up the files? I know you pop into my office regularly--”
“Seriously, you?”
It’s no different than the wild
John laughs, and Sherlock begins to pry open the envelope, stepping away from the station with the champion following dutifully. He’s careful to angle the ripped opening away from his face should it be within Moriarty’s ideas to lace it with a powder. Though, that’s silly, because if it was, the tarts wouldn’t have needed to be poisoned in the first place.
“I will not merely graze you again,” John says. There’s a deadly smile over his face, now, between a smirk and something joyful, like this will be pleasurable. “I will not hesitate in using this in Sherlock’s defense.”
He lifts his head from the floor and dusts off the chest of his dressing gown.
“They will ride,” Fletcher shouts, and the bonfire surges and snaps at the air, threatening to consume him, “By their blood, let the Races begin!”
“Obviously,” Sherlock says, and then feels embarrassed, because this is the line Hope went after him for, at the festival. He goes on without much pause, “Or some other idiot would've won.” Sherlock gestures vaguely with one hand. Gladstone’s eyes snap to the movement, the stallion stills instantly, his long ears whip back. Sherlock's breath catches, and he slowly lowers the hand to hold the reins again.
“—and so I told him, that lot’s not going anywhere, and he should really buy those teacups while he had the chance—”
“No? Why not?”
Lestrade clears his throat again and adjusts his jacket. He waves Sherlock on. “Couldn’t get a print on the - er, body.”
“Long enough. You’ve no idea how I’ve got to bend over backwards to get this place in order after a storm like this. Broken fence posts, spooked horses,” John slicks something he’s retrieved from the cabinet into the pan - it bubbles, “Those doors on the stables? Always coming off their tracks. We need to invest in a round-the-clock repairman.”
“The horses are up, don’t you know.” Anderson sneers at him when Sherlock goes into the notary’s office to check and see if the monthly post has dredged up anything for him.
He strides away from the quay, bakery, and tavern, towards his goal, his reason for coming into town today, and most days. His coat sweeps out behind him, and he adjusts his scarf. Crumpled, dry brown leaves flitter through the streets and back alleys, betraying the season upon them all.
Especially not when Sherlock is doubting his own sobriety.
John’s face twists. He hesitates. He
He catches John’s eyes for a heartbeat. They are lurching specks of blue and his hair is sticking out from the wind, his arms tucked close to his side and his shoulders hunched behind Gladstone’s powerful neck.
The dead woman lies supine on the floor of the second-level sitting room. The red shag carpet is flattened haphazardly around her, and might have indicated the expert dance of a struggle if there weren’t the footprints of all officers who have trampled through this room mixed in. Evidence that could have been discovered in the filaments of rug are long gone by now.
The barrier lifts; the pistol
Who he can see is James Moriarty.
. To be knocked to the sand is to die.
The land is here is made up of high cliffs and perilous drops, low grass with a perpetual white crust from the salt winds coming in from the ocean. Below is the sea, whitecaps beating around the ragged stones like a wolf's tooth. The seabirds are tucked away in nests on the cliffsides, and they dive out into the air or swoop back into the holes in the cliffs every so often, fetching insects or minnows from the surface.
Maybe they won't even let him sign up. Like yesterday, at the beach, where the bowler hat with the low eyebrows and the blonde mare took one look at him, and denied him fifths. At least he isn't dressed up this time. He’s in clothing as casual as everyone else. He feels as though he's trying too hard to look the part, like anyone who looks at him will be able to tell that he doesn't belong here.
“Michaela Shadwell, she was fifty-four.” Lestrade hands a paper file to Donovan, who loiters in latex gloves by one of the bright lights and glares at Sherlock when he walks in. “Found by her neighbor a few hours ago. We know she’s been dead for a day, going by when she’d last been seen and rigor mortis.”
“John--”
One of them will not leave these cliffs tonight.
The way Sherlock had first glanced him over on the cliffs was cold, a gaze of impassive disinterest, and reminded him at the time of the water horses, but now the gaze has become warmer, thawing like ice. When John had caught word of Holmes training up by the cliffs so long ago, something had come over him, and he’d left the Yard at once.
Sherlock wrestles the reins to one side, throwing his elbow and hauling Redbeard closer inland as they go racing past the trio. They gallop near enough for Sherlock to see a rider go under the water, a
Winks.

John grasps Sherlock’s wrist, pulls it from his face. The bruises inflicted by Moriarty on his skin hum with island magic.
“Any idea of what you’d like?” John asks, closing the paddock gate. Behind him, nearly opalescent against the green grass, decorative trees, and the red of the stables, the mare is standing pointedly in the middle of the paddock, just watching those around her.
Would it?
“She didn’t own a cat.”
Sherlock dresses quickly. His riding clothes are at Mrs Hudson’s, at home. He pulls on yesterday’s tailored trousers and shoes without socks instead, still wet from his secret trip. He snags his coat off the back of John’s bathroom door, preparing to shrug it on.
His blood drips onto the rock. And the man after him.
Sherlock gets a stinging punch to his mouth and it splits his lip.
Sherlock emerges from the cramped loo (a toilet too close to a countertop too close to a standing bathtub on rusted, iron-clawed brass feet) feeling a world better. He left his sopping clothes and the towel over the edge of the tub, hoping they’ll dry over the night.
The world is mild, like the gentle slumping of the island edges before the sharp drop of the cliffs. If Sherlock thinks that he’ll be racing soon, he’ll turn to stone. Sherlock watches John go, Gladstone a giant black shadow trailing behind him.
“I should have been quicker,” Sherlock says, battling the urge to sit on the cushions of the sofa in his wet clothes. “If I had foreseen what he was going—”
There’s no reason he should come to Sherlock’s
Swimming with one arm, holding the surviving files above his head, he slowly strokes, wet and weighed down by the heaviness of his coat and clothing, to the side of the quay, striking his other hand out to grasp whatever he can of the high cement wall when his feet touch pebbles and sand. It’s shallower by the sides, so can wade, but it doesn’t help the fact that he’s still chest-deep in the sea. It’s good to be tall, sometimes.

John holds tighter to the reins that he leads the giant black horse with, twisting braided leather around his palm and whispering into the wind. Murray had been keeping Gladstone outside of town for the morning, near his tourist trap of a shop,
,” Sherlock accuses, tongue angry and whip-sharp. “I can tell when you’re lying.”
“So that I know who to pray for.”
Her hooves are plated in iron horseshoes.
“But with all this rain…” John puffs out a breath, and in the small space, it seems to heat the room, to send the light bulbs swinging and Sherlock's heart a-fluttering, like a swarm of locusts after a prospering field. “I put it down by the cliff edges to keep the
“I know. You don't have to do it.”
If only Redbeard could run that fast in the Races.
“Sherlock…” John’s eyes are sad.
Brisk air breezes through the small stable. Mrs Hudson’s screen door can be heard fluttering into the side of the house just around the corner, wooden frame clacking into panelling. Josephine grazes outside, in the fencing, wind gusting through her tail.
Smothered. Quelled. Subdued, only by the man upon its high back.
“Fine, Mrs Hudson.”
Sherlock feels the grin plaster over his face, too, matching John’s in genuine feeling, if not in volume, through the cold. He is beset by shivers, sucking in past his teeth.
Mrs Hudson embraces him tearfully, and he allows himself to hold her. He’s breathless, suspended in disbelief. It hasn’t hit him, the enormity of this accomplishment.
“It's… it's like…” John huffs an irritated breath, tucking the thin cloth into his saddlebag. Gladstone sucks in heavy breaths. Redbeard snorts, ducking his head to nose at the weak Thisby grasses again. Gladstone watches him, blatantly interested. “Hm. Well, um. Huh. Analogies are harder than I thought.”
Again, Sherlock glances behind himself, wondering if there's room for him to back Redbeard away. There was, last time he checked. Now, however, they're crowded so close that it isn't possible, and he gets an eyeful of the tumultuous sea beyond the thin strip of rocky shore, and belatedly wonders if any
What could the rich owner of the Stockyard want with two old ladies chatting about bridge and drinking tea?
Sherlock’s mouth pinches into an unhappy line. Something in his head cannot be convinced to consider John suspicious, as if Moriarty is in any way involved. It is something completely out of the blue, never visited before, not even in a moment of weakness or insecurity. John has been undoubtable, constant and devoted. Never has his story wavered, or his conviction been found suspect.
Sherlock leafs through the day-planner while John peruses the slots of the writing desk. Why can’t all victims be this organized? It would make solving their murders much easier, if markedly less interesting.
The silver-eyed man looks at him. “Ye're very interested.”
“You aren’t going with them?” John asks when the door closes. His voice is soothing and low, without a need to shout, so close to Sherlock’s face.
“John, in all the years you’ve worked for him, has Moriarty ever been known to leave his rooms unlocked?”
“Five time winner of the Scorpio Races, he is.”
When Sherlock snaps his eyes up from John’s arms to behold John’s countenance, John is fiddling with his notebook, which he has drawn from his pocket. Sherlock closes his mouth.
Past dusk, the tide has crept up to reach Sherlock’s booted toes. He lets them get wet. The water does not creep any further. It’s caught in the middle of high tide and the usual tide, a strange thing that happens on Thisby at this time of day. He watches the ocean for the slice of a body through the water.
“No, but I think you’d be. I would be. And I’d like to see you off in the morning.”
He fits his arm into Redbeard’s reins and pulls on his gloves, keeping the last heat of John’s hand close to him.
This could be a fun escapade for John, a last kick of adrenaline and endorphins before the Races trample everything. John’s body falls over Sherlock’s, and the notion flies out of his head.
It's dark tonight. The shine of streetlamps reflect off the bakery windows and hit his eyes. The wind breathes softly over his shoulders, throwing discarded pieces of paper across the stone street. As he slides into the front seat and reaches for the key still in the ignition, the eerie moans of a
“She’s good at that stuff!”
Unwilling to leave John’s side for any longer, Sherlock approaches the giant shivering form that Gladstone has become.
He’s able to turn his head enough to watch John lick a stripe up his palm, which throws a lump into Sherlock’s throat, and push that against Gladstone’s face, right between his eyes. Gladstone’s head plummets, neck bending morosely as John holds his hand in the same spot. A muscle jumps in Gladstone’s leg when Sherlock stretches up to finally, finally get on the damned horse.
“Are you going to the beach today?”
The paper gulls are starting to dislodge their paralysis. Thin feathers twitching, filaments made from the news of last year.
bone one summer when Sherlock was nine, a man’s femur the same year, bleached by the sun - old crab carcasses picked apart by gulls after Thisby storms. It was dried kelp pasted to the rocks in droves when he was thirteen, and an aimless John Watson by a tourist ferry later. Pieces of rider's breeches, a barnacle-crusted leather glove missing three fingers. Broken oyster halves. Remnants of discarded human charms, harnesses and single rusted bells, whose wearers have long since been reclaimed by the water.
Rebecca must’ve been the grandmother’s name, then. 1938. Sherlock squints, mind running numbers on the progression of artificial intelligence and the chances of anything like that being developed nearly a century ago. Improbable. “2019. If you knew someone a century ago, why were you surprised by my size?”
“What-t?”
“It was,” Sherlock punctuates. No matter how dry he is, it feels as though his robe still clings to him with the cold.
That night, he dreams of Redbeard under him, the sand flying behind them, colors streaming out from under his saddle. He licks his teeth and tastes salt. Water horses snap at him from the sea, confined to only the reaches of the waves.
John catches up.
(See the end of the chapter for
are always faster. I don't know what sort of training you're doing, running on the firm sand by the shore, wading through the shallows, running on the rocks or the gravel, chasing the sun, charging back and forth or all over the island. Racing dogs. The
John laughs, “Hey, you'd best watch yourself, these are both for me.”
There is no way to backpedal now. Sherlock replaces Redbeard’s halter with his good bridle, tightening the cheek piece and brushing hay off the noseband. “Yes.” He checks the time on Mrs Hudson’s watch as she throws the pad over Redbeard’s back. Little over an hour before the Races begin.
“Moriarty was clear that he didn’t want me skulking about the Yard. Why would he change his mind suddenly?” It must be to throw another ploy into Sherlock’s life, to aggravate John, to distract them from the Races.
It was stupid of him to develop these emotions for John, for his safety and wellbeing and happiness. They do not fade, even as Sherlock’s mind detests its own weakness. Because he failed at keeping his distance, he will fall.
“Why on earth would you do that? You’ll get yourself killed!” Something clatters in the front room (it must be Archie, surprised at hearing Molly shout). “There- there are people who
“We were in the notary’s office, the mail room. Last room. If there was more evidence it would’ve been held in Lestrade's office, but no doors besides ours was opened, do you remember?” Sherlock puts a hand to his temple. No, no other doors besides the hallway was heard opening when they were hiding from the thief. “It’s possible whoever sent the runner did not know about the envelope.” It is also possible that the envelope wasn’t on Thisby anymore. Or was in a bin somewhere. He would have to go through the station’s bins if he couldn’t find it—
want you to return the Murder Book.”
“Let’s just,” John coughs awkwardly, holding up the envelope again. “Let’s focus on the letter.”
But Moriarty knows about John already He had merely been testing the waters that morbid day on the beach when they discussed nothing and everything at once. When he wants to disrupt the tide, Moriarty will have the exact tools he needs to do it. Namely, Moriarty knows that Sherlock would give up everything for John -- in this, he holds power.
They’re standing out on the cliffs again, far above the reach of the caves, or where past men may have waited for the water to climb in past their heads. The brisk morning had given rise to a sunspotted afternoon, which in turn brought in more eastern clouds the later it became, although the chilling wind remains, blowing Sherlock’s hair over his forehead, and Gladstone’s tail over his haunches. The land is flat and rocky all the way around, and John is tending to Gladstone, removing his reins from the sapling they had been tied against.
He feels like a gelid winter morning, staring at Watson, now crouched just before Sherlock, and panting, looking dangerously at him.
got a certain look to his face that makes Sherlock want to pull Redbeard away immediately. He considers it. It would do Redbeard good, wouldn’t it? And it’d get Sherlock away from the man who keeps somehow insulting him.
The tourists in the audience atop the cliff gasped. The locals didn't seem to react.
But not from in front of them, from behind.
“John,” Sherlock hushes, “he’ll
The admission makes Sherlock feel a bit better, although faint, residual jealousy remains. John’s hand slips between their bodies, he’s propped up on one forearm by Sherlock’s head, now, and grasps Sherlock’s cock. John draws a long stroke up his length, sliding his thumb over the tip, and it’s significantly more difficult to be nervous.
Two hundred and fifty is unattainable. John crosses his arms and shifts his stance, knowing full well there is no hope in trying to physically intimidate Moriarty into changing his price. He remembers Sherlock saying something about playing a game. Just as there’s no hope in changing Moriarty, there’s none in understanding Sherlock and his metaphors, those realizations of his that sound so cryptic to John’s untrained ears.
The wind blows against the cliffs, eroding the chalk. The gulls squawk harsh questions in the air currents above the beach. The water churns towards the shore, rippling the sand into lines, hard and firm. The whole island is slow and muted - no one exists but him and John, shoes soaked in water and blood.
The cabbie stares at him in the rear-view mirror. Sherlock sees him wondering why he chose to pick up Sherlock of all people in London. Biting back another comment, Sherlock debates rolling down the window to have the wind rush in and drown out any sound John makes.
“And if the contents of the envelope are different?” John leads Sherlock’s thought process, providing him a steady railway to cover.
Four months ago, the payments stopped.
“You don’t mess with the Races. You know he’s already angry--”
The riders and Sherlock head towards the clifftops away from the epicenter of Skarmouth's craze and hum. Or, rather, Sherlock follows a few people who are obviously seasoned riders to the cliff edges. Again, not a parade. It’s only some people ambling towards the… the whatever. The rock. Yes. That. Away from the outskirts of town, there is an orange glow past the gathered men and women. Some of the men who are tourists about to ride laugh amongst themselves, as if the Races are all in good fun, and it's a story they'll have to tell back on the mainland. Sherlock spies a number of men with fingers missing. One man has an primitive metal prosthetic from the elbow down, and his other fist is tightly clenched, holding a medallion for luck or magic.
Sherlock hadn’t considered John’s perspective on Sherlock’s own racing. If anything, he pictured himself as an unwelcome intruder on the sacred racing beaches. To hear that John wonders after his safety is profoundly calming. “I can run." It is difficult to be afraid with John here.
Sherlock's eyes fly open.
He isn’t listening to John.
featuring Sherlock's terrible comebacks. And John Watson saving the day. There will be a lot of that.
John is real, blood and all, and he is what he says he is.
He closes his eyes. There's a puff of breath, and the huge body rocks forward, pulling a reluctant Redbeard with sheer force of strength.
John makes him sit back, almost up at the rise of the cantle, loosens the strap of the stirrup lower, and climbs on, settling in front of him. Sherlock tentatively slides forward into the seat with John, watching the way the material of the trousers over John’s thighs shift as he tightens them against the seat jockey, strengthening the hold on the water horse. The reins drift between John’s fingers, evenly braided leather.
The rider’s father is looking at their tiny group. Peculiar.
The night is quiet, save for the rain and the wind. It’s a very large improvement. Thunder growls passively, unaccompanied by lightning.
“I'm not trying to
Rushing into his room, Sherlock snags and throws the jacket from his chair for John to hold while he digs through the pockets, removing a few cursory bits of property like a key and a notebook and pen, then, aha!
Just like the morning after the storm, at Hooper’s Bakery, John’s suddenness has caught him by surprise. Why breach this topic, of all things? What has Sherlock done to deserve such a fate?
her hooves tearing at the uneven clumps of long grass, until they hit the edge of the cliff, John pulls away, and the horse goes leaping off of it, back legs kicking and skin already starting to shimmer. Over the wind and the drop of the cliffs, against the black, he can’t hear or view the impact of her body against the water.
“You’d have to ask Molly,” Sherlock says, aware that Molly would never agree but unwilling to deny the boy. She hardly agreed to let Sherlock haul grain and flour for her from the mill, a month ago. She doesn’t like the Races and doesn’t take any interest or pleasure in watching them.
breather?
“Does it matter?”
Lestrade exchanges another glance with Donovan. He sighs. “Fine.”
Sherlock takes stock of when he last saw Mrs Turner, and, no, she’s fine, too, because she waved to him just twenty minutes ago, when he passed her sheep farm on Redbeard. He waved back.
you, Mrs Hudson!” Sherlock snaps, and then lets his eyes travel back to Lestrade. His grey hair contrasts the dark sack overcoat with its gleaming rows of buttons, and the breeches. His cap is in his fist, like it always is when Lestrade is inside a building. The man is well-dressed, for so early. It’s still dark outside. Well, blue.
Here, John stands confused. It must be written over his face, because Moriarty’s cat-smile returns, and then grows ever wider.
His gaze lands on the castle by his feet, next to his folded laptop, and the tiny, live knight staring up at him.
“Wasn’t one this morning.”
Something new, that Sherlock has never seen on the champion before, has been tucked in specialized pockets and beneath his quaking bridle and saddle - charms of blue petals, scarlet cord, and iron ringlets. Gladstone stands in place and only moves when pulled, his skin twitching like crabs scuttle beneath the surface.
It's obvious the gathered men are only staying to see what will happen between the bowler hat and John.
Interested, Sherlock raises his brows. Still gripping the paper for dear life, John says, “I had to haggle with him over Gladstone again. But. He mentioned you. He said if I took Gladstone and you, he’d never be able to ‘eat his heart’.” Sick, John looks at him for answers, “I don’t know whether he meant Gladstone or you.”
“Of course I’ll be needing it.” John looks to Sherlock as if to confirm they aren’t involved in what Mrs Hudson is insinuating, but Sherlock pretends to be aloof and oblivious.
Hesitantly, John sets his fist on Sherlock’s chest. He taps it lightly on Sherlock’s sternum. This feels better than the cloth on his face, intimate where the handkerchief was brusque. John rasps, “I care. I cared about him. I didn’t want him gone, I didn’t want him hurt, hm? But I would rather have you. Every time. I - want you to know that.”
leave a comment! :)
bluntly and out loud. He wouldn’t mind the trouble too much, he thinks, last night there was loads of trouble and he loved it, more than anything he’s loved in a long time. The brisk air, the rush of the bleak wind against his face while he ran through Skarmouth’s dark alleys… His heart is racing just remembering.
No wonder John does not trust him.

Coming dangerously close to being caught staring, Sherlock leans further back and steeples his hands beneath his chin, closing his eyes. The chair is uncomfortable, but he blocks it out.
before. The once he tried, it had been Mary on the beaches, and the event had not gone well. He had been fractions of a second from changing his mind about Mary when she had killed that dog. She had made the decision for him.
nor the way that the water horse hones in on him.
Sherlock shuts the door to the rusty old Ford. After his brush with the water horse, he’d picked up petrol for the car, and collected Redbeard, who’d trotted alongside the car with the reins mashed in the window on the way back to Mrs Hudson’s house. With the Ford now parked, Sherlock pulls on Redbeard’s reins, leading him into the stable. Mrs Hudson retreats inside the house, tutting. There’s something nervous about her demeanor, like she has more to worry over than Sherlock's whereabouts.
"These are better rules, rather than courtly romance, gallantry, chivalry, and showmanship," Sherlock says, bending slightly to brush off his knees. All this shag dust and stray carpet filaments, it's a wonder the former homeowner wasn't constantly beside herself trying to hoover. "It's country regulation, with proper punishment when one breaks it."
“He’s very nice, Sherlock. And handsome. He’s lovely.”
“My name is Sir Watson. John, if that is so difficult for you to remember.”
For another tell, they come in like the water horses - in October. The closer time crawls to November, the more tourists arrive, seeking to spectate and, some, even, to race. For another, they are irregulars, and everyone who belongs there knows of everyone else on Thisby.
“It’s unwise to press the man that pays your salary, Doctor Watson.” Moriarty pouts.
“This is what happens, brother mine,” Mycroft had said, a line between his brows, eyes fixed on the Races far below. “The Races will be the end of Thisby.”
- S.H.
“And, you-- you
He retreats, and sits atop the cliffs, next to the leaning conifer and its orange carpet of fallen pine needles (he thinks about the
“You don’t have to thank me. I wanted to do this. I wasn’t going to leave you on the beach. It’s nearly November, your feet were in the water, it was dark.”
It’s a standing man, his feet placed shoulder width apart. The knight is facing forward. The ruffled-looking hair is painted silvery blond. Sherlock decides it hasn’t been painted over, and the original forger made it so that this knight was to be depicted as a middle-aged man. How is that relatable to children?
Sherlock smiles. “Exciting. But where will you keep him?” He neglects to ask why, if John’s talk went so well, was Hope on his horse. Doing that would only expose his influence, and irritate John and, maybe, make him think twice about interacting with Sherlock again, which Sherlock cannot afford.
in the Yard, and watches the water horse from the outside. Within, the powerful black shadow is sleeping, or appears to be. His head and long neck are down, knees locked, and thin chest filling slowly with each huge breath, then emptying again.
Hardly able to see, Sherlock steps down from his short ledge onto the sand and shells lining the bottom of the cavern, and moves to John, who is positioned to have a better angle. A few straggling characters, words, are smudged above the reach of the water.
Watson furrows his brow, the corners of his mouth turning down and carving lines into his face. This contradicts the stormy blue of his eyes, framed by pale lashes. His hair is blown back a little in the front, evidence of his speeding run towards Sherlock, just minutes before.
“What?” John says.
The starting line is not so much a line as it is a cluster of strong necks and high-riders. Gladstone is very tall, more than any other
Ah. That’ll be Miss Molly Hooper. Right in time to ruin his recklessness.
“She has an apprentice,” Lestrade goes on, “It could’ve been a, a mistake with the baking and--”

“You don't remember?” John questions, laying a pair of short, loose… Sherlock’s face heats again. He’ll be wearing John’s
He steps closer. “Did the others enjoy this?” Sherlock asks carefully, releasing the fact that he did enjoy it. Of course he did. Only fools wouldn’t. Champion water horse aside, John was behind him, keeping him rooted to the ground as Gladstone leapt and galloped.
Maybe there is some kernel of truth to the actor behind John’s character.
There isn’t time to fight for air, John’s mouth covers his in a hot kiss, tongue sliding through Sherlock’s parted lips. Sherlock jerks, his whole body wracked with shudders. His blood is singing, gooseflesh prickling all his exposed flesh. Every ridge of John’s fingerprint is monumental, his grasp half-dry with dampened sweat, erring on the side of a burn.
Still, it’s good that John didn’t purposely try and make himself known. Sherlock can’t imagine how that conversation would go over.

“Oh, he says that all the time, John,” Mrs Hudson says over the radio, “Can’t get offended, John.” Ugh, she repeats his name every two seconds. Is she really so excited for him to be here?
Is he meant to stay in this cluttered, tiny room, listening to this horrible noise and the rain and the thunder by himself? Not knowing what’s going on, how John’s about to deal with this issue - lock up the horses and barricade all the grooms in the stables? What of the pastures, what if--
Moriarty’s office door slips shut behind him, fitting into the frame with a wooden click.
Pursing his lips, Sherlock pushes the duvet off, shoving it in John’s direction.
Stamford is looking at the blackboard with intent. He hums when Sherlock speaks, turning to look back to him.
Sherlock drops to the floor in a whisk of movement, setting John onto the abdomen of the dead woman.
interested, isn’t it?”
The father’s eyes track John as he approaches, squinting against the cold, and his wife is crying against him. The father and John say a few short words to each other, so low and far enough away that Sherlock doesn’t catch any of them. He can only see the pieces of them that are touched by moon and fire. The
“I should fix up some tea,” she says. “A real champion, in my house!”
It's his own furniture (almost?) but he's anxious about sitting down. John flips the duvet back so that it's all on his lap as Sherlock sits on the space John indicated. He's too close, isn't he? He should move.
That would be in an hour.
“Implied it.”
The salt in the air blows his tail against his hide and mane against his neck, gaining his interest, and he lifts his chin, stretching out his lips, mule-like, to scent the sea.
half in the water, wet and grey, the ocean swaying over its legs and not moving it, the rise of its hide obscuring an empty saddle.
His fingers twitch for the first time in a week at half past three on a Wednesday afternoon. Sherlock is the one to see it. Feel it.
Redbeard twists, afraid. To make up for this, Sherlock stares up at the blond rider, as the water horse is pulled to Redbeard’s side.
. John wants to help, always. Sherlock adores that sense in him, the fierce loyalty, the unwavering figure at his side.
Most people come to Thisby seeing the ocean like a dog. A mutt, come to beg at their feet and lap at their toes. It’s a mistake, oftentimes a deadly one. The ocean is a wolf, lying in wait. The
Back to sherlock... midterms are coming up!
“How he did all of this for your attention. On some level, I knew he was up to something, he had to have been, but to think he’d been doing so much, right in front of my face…” John’s shoulders slump. “I feel like an idiot.” His body leans away from Sherlock’s as he replaces the shell on the bedstand with a small clatter.
John goes on, “As I was saying…” John gestures to the sword. “It’s almost new, you can see the etching up high on the blade, which isn’t something you do to
John’s hand sifts into the wind-knotted curls at the nape of Sherlock’s neck, pressing hard against his skull and hurting his hair and tucking Sherlock’s face into John’s neck. Sherlock clutches to John’s worn jacket, drinking in his comfort. Oh, god. Had they been so close to disaster?
Or so the Thisby tales go. There is something wrong with the ocean, but he doesn’t believe in magic by any means. Really, it’s as if everyone’s head is full of saltwater and sand! The only inhabitants here are people born here, and nearly everyone besides Sherlock has gone mad with it.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock levels his hand flat so John can see properly. “Do you know anything or not?”
A scene before him.
“What grabbed your attention enough to steal a book?” Sherlock asks, not questioning why Mike would be at the gambler’s hideout. He can recall Mike’s faraway stare as he peered over the potential racers, worry and love of his islanders knitted in a crease over his brow, ‘
The stallion pulls him under.
There are several lines about racers, all truths that John had mentioned to Sherlock before.
That’s all the rider had been, a boy. Barely old enough to race at seventeen, but foolhardy enough to try.
“What was
“Mister Sherlock, it’s the parade! The rider’s parade!”
“That is well enough,” he says.
It's terrifying, Sherlock thinks, how the same sun showcases the permanent layer of salt and grease over the black

What he'd meant to say was,
The man behind the desk eyes Sherlock, his quill paused in the air, dripping black, black ink onto cheap parchment.

sweep down the tract of sand, screaming to each other. From Sherlock’s perspective, he can see the glints of sharp weapons in racer’s hands. Another gull swiftly darts just over Sherlock’s head, and allows him to catch a glance of the deaths from these Races - nine, out of thirty-four riders.
In this moment, he regrets everything. He regrets signing up for the Races. He regrets buying expensive hay, and interacting with- with John, and attending the festival, and--
cannot race!’ Like most of the lesser men on this wicked island, Hope is seeking support from the masses, not addressing Sherlock like a person, because he will not be strong enough on his own, and in the masses Sherlock will be felled. Redbeard. It must be Redbeard. All the things the horse has done for him feel as though they are nothing.
The wolfsbane flower.
“I don’t care how much it weighs, it’s an eyesore.”
John snarls, "Go."
"No-- no! Let it alone, Sherlock!"
“I want that horse.”
“You’re a very clever man,” John says finally. He tugs on their hands, and they go.
Sherlock breathes in the salt and the fishy smell that Thisby has always been tinged with. He can’t back out now. He won’t. Not unless he dies. He won’t have this island thinking him a coward. Thisby is not kind to cowards.
John makes a noise of displeasure and lifts his boot, giving the clotted bloodstains on Shadwell’s chest a wide berth. "Disturbing." He looks visibly concerned that Sherlock set him on a body with no regard, but Sherlock can’t spend too long consoling John.
as Father Stamford’s told me.”
John grins. He still looks tired, the grin is lopsided and silly, and Sherlock's heart is still stuttering, giving him horrendous palpitations that threaten to cut off his electric beating forever.
“He wasn’t really a great mill worker.”
“I know you know,” John laughs, returning his hands. Both of them go around Sherlock to grasp Gladstone’s mane, tying knots. Sherlock must remember to ask John about that. He so despises charms, do knots count?
“Ah,” Sherlock nods, secretly pleased, “Yes, of course.”
Every year. Every year, as far back as time went, the horses had pulled themselves from the sea. And every year, the people of Thisby had gone after them.
“Nope. She loves you, completely and wholeheartedly. No idea what you did to deserve that--” Sherlock scoffs quietly, “--but... she does.”
Reeling, Sherlock breaks away, gasping. Why is John doing this? It's all so sudden. His voice cracks. “But - he’s gone.”
The man vies for his attention again, “Can't stand all night.”
“Obviously,” Sherlock says, waving a hand dismissively. John frowns, his face cast in shadow, and Sherlock resets himself. The gravel crunches under their shoes. “Sorry. Yes, although the fairytale story within would have seemed arbitrary to Lestrade, it was damning to you and I because you understood the meaning of Moriarty’s obsession.”
Ruining the illusion, John clears his throat. “The horses that have been on land longer, they're more… complicated. You'd think they would become more placid,” John watches the ocean, “more calm. It's the opposite, really. They miss the water more.” Sherlock fingers dance around the edge of the thermos, which has begun to lose its warmth.
“Why would someone take a toy sword?”
He lays the rein against Gladstone’s neck and the water horse turns on a coin, flying away from the craggly line that makes up the edge of the island and sweeping inland, ripping through furlongs of grass in the blink of an eye. John’s arms tighten around him, squeezing playfully, and it hits Sherlock that John is laughing, only, the wind is taking it all. Sherlock’s mouth twists into a smile, one he tries to keep to himself.
It’s Anderson, the notary, with his feeble brown beard caked in scraggly shadow and firelight. He whistles again. Sherlock doesn’t like his expression or the fantastical bright red and yellow costume he’s wearing, or the way the wind plays with all the bright layers as he prowls closer to Sherlock. There are other people around. Surely Anderson wouldn’t be so stupid as to do something with witnesses about.
with nightlock before he even knew Sherlock, why couldn’t Sherlock fantasize about John taking a step further, and exiting the Races altogether?
A beat.
There it is. The cat really is a clue, just not in the way Sherlock predicted. How stupid Sherlock was.
“I say that because we’re very old friends.”
The hulk of the station seems completely different in daylight than it did beneath Thisby’s black sky the other night, although his side is significantly colder, both with the wind and with the absence of a certain champion by his arm. Making sure his lips are marred into a frown, Sherlock strides right in the front door.
“John,” Sherlock warns.
Squinting, he keeps staring at the letter, feigning disinterest in the same detached manner he did yesterday morning, with John on the sofa. “I told him that I knew he was playing a game,” he says, telling the truth. Then, he lies. “And that was all.”
A beat.
Sherlock's fingers dance in their twitching around the circumference of the small porcelain plate. It feels strange, sitting here in John’s tiny flat, in John’s pants and jumper. On his bed. Just half this situation would feel strange. He’s never really been in someone else’s place of living, save for Lestrade’s on the scant nights when his old habits would get the better of him, and much less someone’s bedroom. His whole heart is offbeat, pumping out an unusual rhythm throughout his chest and whole body.
The champion dissolves any doubts Sherlock had had thus far. John’s fingers slide down Sherlock’s woolen arm until they arrive at his hand. Sherlock cautiously pushes his fingers between John’s, then bends them until he is locked in place.
Another gurgle.
John smiles. His grin is self-satisfied, but tired. Minutely concerned, gaze lingering on Sherlock’s for too long. Weary, ready for another go-around in the highest-risk sport he could ever manage to become a key player in.
“The Races have always been about the
“Mike,” John says, noticing and acting innocent. His eyes darken beneath his brows, “It was good to see you.”
Mike smiles, his glasses budging up his cheeks a little with the broadness of it. Immense relief writes itself in his posture, relaxed and without the heavy anxiety from before.
A gun fires, drawing Sherlock back to the beach, and the horses at the starting line leap into the air, throwing sand and scattering - there are tight blurs of colors as the racers speed along the beach, hot gasps from the horses and the crowd.
