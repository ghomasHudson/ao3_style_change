He hadn’t realized just how much of a mess he would make, and, as he felt urine pooling beneath him on the carseat, he became nervous.  What if Papa was mad about his backseat?  What if Daddy punished him for not going potty when he’d been told to?  What if he got another spanking on his already sore bum?  Maybe this all wasn’t such a good idea, after all.
“This is Doctor John Watson,” Greg said to his mother, taking John by the elbow to pull him into the circle of his closest family.  “I told him Lestrade family Christmas Eve is where stragglers come for the holidays.”
He should have known better.  Mycroft had been right, per usual when it came to Sherlock.  The man had some of the finest instincts he’d ever come across.  No wonder; he was a Holmes brother, after all.  But none of that mattered now; Greg had set his own terms earlier that night, and now he had to follow through.
Sherlock had always been there, in the bed they shared as both littles and, although not every night, as adults.  If they were sharing a bed when John had a nightmare, Sherlock was always already sitting up and focused when John came awake shivering and, sometimes, screaming.  And whether they were big or little, Sherlock knew just how to settle John’s mind and get Bunny back to sleep.
John ate voraciously, finally hungry again after the stress of the morning.  He and Sherlock were both slipping back down in headspace; John had been glad to find Sherlock already aged down when he and Uncle Greg had come down for lunch.  John was not young enough to want Mycroft to feed him, but he could feel himself a bit desperate for the man’s attention after denying himself his Daddy’s care for the sake of Sherlock all morning.  He was sitting as close to him as he could while still staying put in his own chair.
“That’s right, Bun,” Mycroft smiled.  “We all have scary things that have happened to us in the past.  But what happened to Sherlock was not your fault, and I’m sure Sherlock is going to be happy to have you as a little sister.”
A part of him considered unzipping his jeans and pissing against the side of the house.  But there were too many others around, and his jeans were already dripping; he may as well suck it up and piss himself like a man.  He kept his head high and his stance strong, feeling the warmth stream down the inside of first one leg, and then the other, nearly an entire day’s worth of piss soaking into his clothing.
John wasn’t sure what had woken him until he saw the overhead hallway light turn off and realized Mycroft and Greg must be going to bed themselves.  There was a domestic contentment to the entire scene: Sherlock dozing next to him, stuffed alligator clutched to his chest and hair mussed from his pillow, Mycroft and Greg readying themselves for bed down the hallway.  John could not help but feel safe, grateful for the lifestyle he had fallen into.
“They’ve never separated us before,” he said, eyebrows furrowed as he began sorting through what John knew would be the multiple possibilities for such behavior swirling in his mind.  "And it was only once you’d fully expressed your desire to be labeled female that Mycroft became concerned.  He hasn’t felt the need to bar me from seeing you before this point, even when you were dressed in a nightgown or playing with paper dolls.”
Sherlock sat up and pulled the pacifier from his own mouth to offer it to John, who leaned forward and took the plastic bulb of the pirate pacifier in his mouth.  He smiled and wiped his teary eyes.
It's very important that I give WARNINGS for intentional wetting which leads to sexual arousal/groping/fondling in this chapter between Sherlock and John.  They are fully adult during the entire situation, but if you'd rather not read anything sexual between them, feel free to hang tight until they slip back into headspace in the next chapter or two.
Mycroft ran his hand slowly against Sherlock’s bum, soothing the reddened skin as he always had after he’d spanked Sherlock as a child.
"I can help," he said.  "We'll talk later about where you were.  Just tell me what's wrong, Sherlock."
Bunny sat up with wide eyes.  She could not help but bounce a bit where she sat, eager and excited for whatever Papa had brought, but she waited patiently as Papa retrieved a shopping bag from the floor at the end of the bed.
It was morning when he next woke, and when he blinked open his eyes he was face to face with his Daddy.
There it was again, the need to comfort and soothe.  John watched as Sherlock hesitated but nodded, holding out his left forearm.  He stepped forward and reached out to push the sleeve of Sherlock's coat up to his elbow, and while he forced himself to make no noise, he knew his face must have betrayed his shock.  A few bloody cuts littered the underside of Sherlock's arm, obviously self-inflicted.
“Okay, John,” Sherlock said, voice husky from sleep as he sat up in bed and ran a hand down his face, seemingly to wake himself up.  He had clearly noticed that John was in an adult headspace.
“And she took…?” John asked, hovering in restless anticipation over the kitchen table between the Holmes brothers.
“Uh-huh,” he said.  “For ages and ages.  And then he even made me clean up Bunny’s pee-pee from the floor in the attic.  So, can I not be spanked? Please, please?”
Greg knew he would need to get to the bottom of the situation, but standing in the toy aisle of a store, in earshot of strangers, was not exactly the ideal place to do so, particularly given John’s tendency towards moodiness when hungry, and the fit he had thrown earlier that morning.
“Cruelty does not suit you, Sherlock,” he said, unable to keep his voice from slipping into something more paternal.
Mycroft had not originally had any qualms about Bunny’s requests for mermaid bath toys or glitter crayons.  He’d bought the boy what he asked for, pleased to see him feeling comfortable in little space even while coloring princesses and watching Disney movies.  But, as the weeks passed and John became more comfortable ageplaying and more likely to express his desire for feminine items, Mycroft had begun to worry that John’s desire to express himself in this way was less healthy for John than he had originally anticipated, and it was this worry that brought out his unsurety and displeasure.
"Spot will watch over you in case you need some company," she said, nodding to the plush dog with a warm smile as she crossed the room to turn out the overhead light.  "And I’ll send Greg up to check on you in a little while.”
“My little brother seems to have tired you out, Dr. Watson,” Mycroft said when John all but collapsed into the kitchen chair.
He hadn’t been paying close enough attention to his bladder, too wrapped up in his own bad feelings about the morning.  He’d grown aware of the need to pee only when Mycroft sat him down with Bunny before the telly and put on the babyish kids’ show, but, even then, he hesitated.  He regretted putting the pull-up on after his accident because it would bring attention to him if it were found, but at the same time, as he rocked a bit back and forth on the couch cushions, he was glad for the safety of it, the chance it gave him to ignore his bladder and the reminders of his accident that morning just a bit longer.  But then Bunny had started pestering him, insisting that Sherlock should use the potty like a big boy, and Sherlock had gotten upset, and lashed out.
Sherlock swiped at his teary eyes and shuffled towards Mycroft with heavy feet.  He allowed himself to be pulled close, but squirmed away from Mycroft’s attempt to shift him into his lap.
“Let’s get some food in that belly, alright?” Mycroft suggested, rolling down his sleeves so he could put his suit coat back on before they went inside.  Sherlock would tease his brother later for being the only man who wore a suit on vacation.
Sherlock thought about confessing.  He thought about explaining that he’d made a mistake and had an accident upstairs and then lied about it to Papa who had only been trying to help, and he thought about explaining to Mycroft that he was wearing a pull-up because of how worried the potty training chart made him.  He thought about telling his brother he wanted to be held.  But he didn’t know where to begin; he felt tethered to the lies he'd already told.
“Well,” Sherlock said with an over-exaggerated lifting of his eyebrows before jumping from the chair and stepping into the living room.  “Mystery solved.”
John felt more comfort in Greg’s endearing ‘kiddo’ than he had all day; he had to steel himself against the wave of vulnerability that attempted to wash over him.  He had already made Greg come all this way; he didn’t need to make him care for him in littlespace on top of it all.  Besides, if they were heading back to Greg’s family, John could not afford to let himself get small.
Whether Sherlock decided he was too hungover to be up for the task of caring for his regressed boyfriend in the middle of the night or whether he sensed that the boy needed his Daddy,  Bunny didn’t care.  All that mattered was that Sherlock stood, reached around the back of the closet door and into the pocket of his dressing gown, and pulled out his mobile.
“He was quiet when we got to my place, withdrawn.  He wouldn’t get out of bed and barely ate.  I had to call and take a leave of absence from work because I was afraid to leave him alone.  It became clear drugs had been a coping mechanism for him, and he began to show the signs of withdrawal, begged me to let him take them.”
John moved into damage-control mode, explaining to Sherlock each step of what they were going to do in the same way he might had he met an injured man in Afghanistan during battle.
“Are you sure you're okay with this, Bunny?” Mycroft asked. He knew very well that John was in an adult headspace at the moment, but he needed the jaded cynic that tended to characterize John to be dampened for a moment.
“I’m not hungry, Mycroft,” he said, voice argumentative yet still retaining a bit of the whininess that characterized Sherlock while little or big.  “I don’t want breakfast, and you can’t make me have it.”
Bunny turned his head from where he had been watching as his Daddy held the baby bottle to Sherlock’s lips, letting the boy latch on as he leaned his head against Mycroft’s chest.  It didn’t make sense.
After some quiet time, Sherlock heard John come barreling back into the kitchen.  Sherlock could sense even though his eyes had fallen closed long minutes before that Bunny paused in his stampeding run when he saw that Sherlock was half-asleep.
“John’s your little brother, but he’s not a baby.  It hurts his feelings when you call him that name.  I want you to stop calling him that, no matter what he does or how young he slips.”
“Bye, lake house,” Bunny said, clearly consoled by the prospect of coming back, and Sherlock, who was now sucking his thumb as his pacifier had fallen out of his mouth as he cried, turned to wave as well, his tears decreasing.
“Is that all?” Greg asked with a smile, hefting Sherlock onto his hip and carrying him towards the fridge.  “Well, we can fix that in no time, champ.”
John obeyed, but Greg was a bit concerned to see blood in the sink mixed in with the toothpaste John had just spat out.
Sherlock, feeling shy about Bunny knowing that he was wet, crawled towards Uncle Greg and, on his knees, gestured for the man to lean down.  He leaned close and whispered in his ear.
“Tell me a story, Papa?” Sherlock asked, and from over his other shoulder Greg heard a mumbled “yeah, story, Papa,” from a yawning Bunny.
Whether Greg was putting on an act or not, John believed he was proud of him in that moment, and John breathed a bit easier.
Greg turned to leave the kitchen and Mycroft sighed and returned to his newspaper.  Sherlock never did well on long car rides, always waiting until it was too late to speak up about needing to go, refusing rest stops out of stubbornness even when they could all tell he was desperate.  Mycroft would have been disappointed that the man had given up so easily if the words had not had a clear effect on his little brother.  Sherlock was fidgeting, eyes downcast and both hands now on the pull-up.  Mycroft, Greg, and John all knew Sherlock took a bit of comfort in them, that he liked wearing them more than he would admit because it was better than wetting his pants and underwear.
Sherlock smiled as he sunk down into the blanket wrapped around him.  He hadn't been the most well-behaved boy over the past few days, but he could not help but think about brightly-wrapped packages placed beneath the Christmas tree Papa had convinced Mycroft to begrudgingly purchase and set up in the living room.  Maybe Christmas wouldn't be so bad, after all.
There was a cathartic release in the tantrum that had the initial effect of spurring him on, prodding him to expel the pent-up emotion he had been harboring all morning, and the later effect, once his body tired and his head began to ache from crying, of dropping him into an exhausted, pitiful sobbing, curled on the linoleum floor, vision blurred from tears.
Sherlock's mind was stimulated, racing with possibilities and new understandings.  They’d done a bit of dominance play in the past, but it had always been John who had taken charge, slotting himself into what he must have seen as the more acceptable role.  They were nights John was drunk and his inhibitions were low enough to command and to degrade and to call Sherlock
John snorted a laugh and rolled over to pull Sherlock back down to the bed by the neck of his t-shirt.  He gave him a sloppy kiss on the side of his mouth.
P.S. For those of you waiting for Sherlock's punishment from Mycroft as he settles him back down into a calm headspace, rest assured that we'll get back to it :)
“You’d never been to a sleepover before,” Mycroft said, sipping from a cup of tea he’d made for himself.  “I could tell you were nervous before leaving.”
, where I'll be posting ficlets and would love your requests for ageplay-based ficlet ideas!  I posted a Christmas-themed ficlet set in the Little Brothers Mine world not too long ago, and plan to post another soon!
“Sherlock, can I help you color in the map?” Bunny tried, his voice a bit louder as he knelt next to Sherlock.
“I can’t hear you with your mouth full, champ” Greg said with a chuckle as he tilted Sherlock’s head back slightly to have better access to his top teeth.
Greg wiped the tears from the Bunny’s cheeks and pulled them close to him in another hug.  He couldn’t be sure, but it seemed that Bunny was potentially in the midst of shifting gender headspaces, not comfortable as a boy and yet not yet ready to be a girl.
“You’re going to regret that little stunt tomorrow,” Mycroft said when Uncle Greg entered the kitchen, but his eyes were bright, and Sherlock knew his Mycroft wasn’t angry.
“You’re protecting him,” Greg said, obviously sensing Mycroft’s unease and remembering the conversation they’d had back at his flat.
Sherlock nodded, taking in the information.  Bunny was falling asleep, his head lolling on Uncle Greg’s shoulder, but Sherlock could see he was trying to wake himself to listen to the conversation which had just begun.
It was a nightmare that woke John, a bloody, violently graphic nightmare that had him gasping for breath as he clutched at the sheets around him, eyes wet with tears as his heart pounded.  It took him a moment to realize he had started to piss himself, and he grasped at his crotch as he hurriedly made his way out of the bed, contorting his body until he’d managed to gain control of his bladder with thankfully little more than sopping briefs and a few damp spots on his pajama pants, which were dark enough to mostly hide the wetness.
The man must have seen the broken lamp, maybe even the glass he'd used. But he wasn't yelling or pulling Sherlock's body this way and that in a desperate search for wounds.  Papa’s distance made Sherlock feel respected, maybe even in-charge.
“I’ll speak with him,” Mycroft said.  “Your thumb is raw from sucking and I think you’d enjoy the pacifier.  I know you’re not a baby, and you can believe me.”
“Remember,” Greg said when they’d reached the bottom of the staircase.  “Papa and Daddy are here for you even if it takes Sherlock a little longer to get used to his sweet baby sister.”
Sherlock nodded, then allowed his brother to play his stuffed alligator on the seat beside him as he cleaned up the toys from the bag Sherlock had kicked over earlier.
Mycroft couldn’t help but breathe a relieved sigh.  The boy had seen Greg shopping for diapers, and had assumed they were for him, which had come as a blow to his self-confidence.  It was all just a silly misunderstanding.
Greg ran a hand over Mycroft’s shoulder.  After a moment, the man allowed himself to be pulled into Greg’s arms.  Greg did not realize until that moment how fast his heart had been beating.  At the feeling of Mycroft in his arms, the knowing that, once they got themselves out of this mess, things would be okay between himself and the man, he felt himself begin to calm.
He found his brother where he’d left him at the kitchen table, the bag of crisps they’d been snacking on cleared away but a fresh beer left before Greg’s chair.  His brother said nothing as Greg settled in the chair and opened the beer with a sigh, simply glanced at him with an eyebrow raised.  The expectant expression was familiar, one his oldest brother had given Greg time and again while they were growing up, prompting Greg--always comforted by the knowledge and experience of his big brother--to share secrets and tell tales he otherwise would have guarded close.
John allowed himself to be manipulated into the back seat, where he felt he could finally breathe without a heavy weight on his chest, shielded from the outside world.  He wiped at the tears that continued to fall, willing himself to hold his emotions together at least until he was alone with Greg, on their way home.
Mycroft never thought he’d have himself a daughter, but now that she was snuggled safe in his arms, he couldn’t wait to get to know her.
"Mycroft, you need to keep the stitches out of the water," he said through the closed bathroom door once he had crossed through the hallway.  Surprisingly, the bathroom door opened halfway and Mycroft appeared.  He could see Sherlock standing behind Mycroft in nothing more than his wet underwear, yellow from his urine.  His hands were down near his crotch, as if attempting to hide his accident.
Bunny beamed up at him and nodded, then wrapped his arms around him as he dove forward into a hug.  Greg gave a content chuckle, pleased to finally feel as if he’d settled the boy and gotten him past the stress of the morning.
“Just have a seat,” Greg said, pulling out a chair at the table and walking to the other side to take a seat himself.
Lestrade smiled, perhaps with a touch of sadness that John had seen from Mycroft whenever John showed that he didn't believe himself worthy of care.
“Now, do you want to tell us what this is really about, lovebug?” Mycroft prompted as Uncle Greg took a step back.
The term of endearment had been uttered before he realized how patronizing it could appear.  But it seemed to have the opposite effect on the curly-haired man, who nodded through his pitifully heart-breaking expression, teary-eyed and somehow desperate.  It also had the effect of silencing Mycroft, who had been ranting on the other end of the phoneline.  John turned back to the phone.  "Mycroft?  I think you should come now.  Sherlock's just...he's just wet his pants."
“Good boy,” Mycroft said, catching Sherlock and giving him a hug.  “Now go help Uncle Greg make dinner while I get your brother out of the tub, okay?”
Here is the as-promised beginning of little John and first appearance of Lestrade.  A bit of wetting (as always) and general Sherlock brattiness are thrown in for good measure!
“Yes, sweet boy.  Remember how we talked about your brother feeling very little today?  He’s just a bit too little to remember to use the potty, so I asked Uncle Greg to buy him some diapers.”
The truth of the matter was that John could not keep from thinking about Mycroft.  Despite his attempts to keep his mind on the footie game, his thoughts continued to wander towards the man’s willingness to drop whatever it was he had been doing in order to comfort John during his earlier hour of need.  If John hadn’t turned Mycroft away, he would currently be snuggled beside his Daddy with his pacifier and stuffed rabbit.
“We’ve got to get that kid a pacifier clip, or at least a second pacifier,” Greg mused, and Mycroft, focused on the road and the navigation system’s directions, hummed his consent.
He was already feeling the effects, but one more wouldn’t hurt.  If anything, being drunk with Sherlock was helping him to forget the events of the day, of the past few days.  He hadn’t thought about Mycroft for more than a fleeting moment in hours.
John and Sherlock had never had been in a fight like this while they were little.  Sherlock teased and made fun and they bickered about whose turn it was to play with a toy, but it had always been Sherlock who instigated and caused trouble, Sherlock whose actions needed to be accounted for.  Bunny was the one who had practice forgiving freely.  Now, he was in the unfamiliar position of needing to be forgiven, and it felt lonely waiting for Sherlock to come around and stop being angry.
Sherlock grinned his most innocent smile.  Mycroft had shown his hand earlier while he thought Sherlock had not been paying attention.  He clearly wanted the little family together at his house, and Sherlock had chosen just the right moment to suggest exactly that.
“For you as well,” John said.  “I’d never want your relationship with Mycroft to suffer because of me.”
“Okay, bud.  I’m proud of you for being brave,” Mycroft said.  John beamed at the praise.  He was desperate for praise, and, unlike Sherlock, did not shrug off positive encouragement.  As the oldest child of his family, John was used to giving encouragement, and he had rarely received it back.
John had none of the desire for humiliation and insults which turned Sherlock into such a sloppy mess whenever he was holding his piss; the doctor was quite the opposite.  Watching John’s behaviors in headspace had allowed Sherlock to understand that it was praise John craved, a salve for his insecurities and a reprieve from his constant humility.
Mycroft sighed.  He hated to know that the hesitancy he had shown when issues of Bunny’s gender identity had first come to surface had so clearly led his child to believe he--
His brother ignored him in favor of adjusting the faucet and scrubbing at a dirtied plate Sherlock knew to have been sitting at the bottom of the sink for over a week.  Mycroft had been cleaning ever since Greg had carried John out of the flat, organizing and tidying up while Sherlock stalked around the apartment, attempting to express his displeasure at Mycroft’s presence through huffs and glares.  Mycroft had paid him little mind, going about his tasks with little more than fleeting glances at Sherlock.
“You want to be potty training?” Mycroft said, putting to words exactly what John wanted.  “Is that what you want, baby?” he asked.
Bunny seemed not to notice when they stopped walking altogether.  Greg bent down to the boy.  Although Mycroft argued, Greg felt the boys had far too few toys and items for when they were little; it wasn’t often he got the opportunity to spoil them.
Daddy breathed in and out to show Bunny how to do it, too, counting to four as he took a breath in, then continuing to eight as he breathed out. His arms were strong and supportive around his back, and Bunny felt the first hints of safety as the nightmare’s images began to recede.
Mycroft was excited for their trip to the lake house.  It would be the first time all four of them--Sherlock, John, Lestrade, and himself--had gone away together, and he was eager to get on the road.  In some ways, he had been hoping the boys would be young--it had been over two weeks since they’d had any time longer than an evening to partake in age play and he was eager to spend time with them while little--but there was plenty of time for them to settle into headspace, and it might actually be easier to get two men ready and out of the apartment than if they were in the mindset of children.  Then again, knowing Sherlock, that remained to be seen.
Bunny was naked a moment later, his Daddy having torn the sides of the pull-up.  There were baby wipes on the top of his dresser, and he was soon wiped down and patted dry with a towel, then re-dressed in a new pull-up, this one with flowers.  Bunny whined and pointed to his nightshirt, and soon he was once again dry and clean and happy.  His Daddy lifted him into his arms.
“I’ll, ah...yeah.  I’m going to take a shower,” John said, running a hand along the back of his neck before he began untangling himself from the sheets.
In regards to Mycroft's lies and Sherlock's lack of memory, I'm letting the series influence the writing--in TFP, Mycroft does not speak of Eurus until he is caught in the omission of truth by Sherlock and John ("someone convinced him that you wouldn't tell the truth unless you were actually wetting yourself"), and even in the telling of the backstory, he leaves out mention of Victor and perpetuates the myth that Redbeard is a dog (it is only Eurus who guides Sherlock to that remembrance).  Sherlock's forgetfulness when it comes to his sister/Victor is canon; I'm just exploring what it might look like if there was the potential for the secret to come out before it was absolutely necessary for it to be told.  I'm not setting out to change the events of the series within my writing, just to play around with the implications of them a bit.  All of that is to say: don't expect to see any sudden remembrances about Eurus--things will stay hidden for now :)
Mycroft and Sherlock arrived home as Greg flipped absentmindedly through the channels on the telly in the living room, yawning.  He was exhausted; it had been a long day and a particularly busy few weeks.  But he had not wanted to go to sleep after Mycroft had texted to let him know he was on his way with Sherlock.  He would wait up and make sure all was well first.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft sighed.  “If you’ve been feeling young, it’s not healthy to keep pushing that away.  We’ve talked about this before.  You can’t keep ignoring what you need.”
He couldn’t convince Mycroft that he was fully adult; his brother knew too well how he’d behaved earlier that day.  But he could try to convince him he was handling his struggle well enough to remain mostly adult.  And, in the process, maybe he could convince himself as well.
“Let’s have a nice chat,” Mycroft said. “And then we’ll get you to sleep with your brother before nap time’s over.”
Generally, their chats occurred in the middle of the night, in the space for John which existed between little and big.  John had been exhausted, however, and Mycroft knew he would sleep a full night.  It was why he had slept himself on the sofa in John and Sherlock’s flat before waking with the sun and preparing both tea and orange juice.  He hadn’t had to wait long.  The sun was not fully risen by the time John stumbled into the kitchen, hair mussed and face lined from sleep.
Greg clucked his tongue and reached into the pocket of Sherlock’s overnight bag and fished out a pirate pacifier.  Sherlock only used it when he was feeling particularly young, and, even then, he often fought against using it.  But, in that moment, away from home and London and the millions of people in the city, safe with his brother and Uncle Greg and his little Bunny, he felt protected.  He took the pacifier and let Greg dress him in a warm jumper over his pirate shirt.
Mycroft seemed to understand what was happening even before Sherlock was finished.  His hand paused for a moment where it had been rubbing along Sherlock’s shoulder blades, but he soon began again, and Sherlock assumed, if anything, he was probably relieved.  He must know Sherlock had to be particularly young if he was wetting himself while straddling his brother’s lap.
Mycroft had insisted that he try to “use the potty” before they left Baker Street, but a grumpy Bunny had not been in the mood to listen to his Daddy after the spanking.  He’d pretended to use the loo, then he had been ushered downstairs towards the waiting double-parked car.  No one had been paying enough attention to notice that he hadn’t actually peed.  John could now feel the consequences of his stubbornness; his bladder was heavy, and persistent, jostled as they twisted through the London streets.
Sherlock snorted a laugh and pressed his face into John’s side.  John skirted his fingers down along Sherlock’s ribcage, tickling him, and Sherlock squealed in protest.
headspace, hadn’t acknowledged the small feelings that had been pricking the corners of his mind all day.  Sherlock gave in at last, and, with a sigh, nodded against Mycroft’s shoulder.
He got them closed into a family restroom stall, where he sent the boy to “try to potty” one more time as he unhooked the diaper changing table from where it was latched onto the wall.
Mycroft lifted the man and carried him to the bedroom he shared with Sherlock when the men were little.  Sherlock was asleep, limbs askance and sheets and blankets twisted around.  Mycroft settled John into bed next to Sherlock and tucked him in beneath his butterfly comforter.
Mycroft made a sound of approval and crossed to the bathroom to look for the childish cartoon band aids before taking a seat next to his regressed brother in the kitchen.  Sherlock picked at the taupe-colored band aids plastered onto his injured hand.
Bunny was sobbing, wet and sad and needy, but he reached his arms out towards Mycroft when the man appeared.
When John glanced up at him, Sherlock’s eyes were still downcast, but there was a quirk of an eyebrow which displayed warmth and even humor.  The pain and process of his injured hand must have sobered Sherlock up a bit, must have settled him the way self-harm had in the past.
"I'm sorry, Papa," Sherlock said, but Papa just shushed him and, humming, began helping Sherlock to clean up.
John wasn’t usually this pliable when they were intimate.  Yes, he let Sherlock lead more often than not, allowing him to initiate and take charge, but that had more to do with John’s lingering issues with his sexuality than it did with his own desires.  John always retained an ironic glint in his eyes when they messed around, as if he were merely giving in for the sake of Sherlock, not himself.  It was a habit which spoke to his inability to fully accept himself as a bisexual man; clinging to that stubborn sense of irony had always seemed to keep him from giving into Sherlock completely.
He dropped the empty container onto the wet spot on the carpet, tossed a box of tissues from the bedside table towards the spill to make it look as if he’d been trying to clean up, then stumbled towards the doorway, twisting to unlock the door.  He stepped back as Papa immediately opened the door.
He took the spoon from Sherlock’s hand and began feeding the boy himself.  Sherlock ate greedily for once, waiting for spoonfuls of macaroni with an opened mouth.
He reached to squeeze the boy’s knee and placed Dimitri the dinosaur into the boy’s arms to provide some comfort.
Sherlock was not about to let himself be led into the humiliation of corner time and an afternoon nap.  Moving sharply, he stopped walking and bent his knees in an attempt to duck out from beneath Mycroft’s grip.  He managed to get his shoulder free, but Mycroft had somehow anticipated the move and used the opportunity to take Sherlock by the arm, which gave Sherlock far fewer options.  He was trapped, and Mycroft was squeezing his arm in a way Sherlock knew he couldn't loosen.
“I spilled my juice,” Sherlock said, allowing himself to be manhandled.  “I was trying to clean it up.  I didn’t wanna get in trouble.”
Sherlock had fought headspace with a staunch determination, but once he’d allowed himself the comfort Mycroft was offering, the man had slipped very young, and very quickly.  He had obviously needed to calm his mind as much as possible, shifting down into his youngest self.  It was his hope that the man was still blissfully young and happy, coloring at the kitchen table or playing with his plastic animals and blocks.
Thank you as always for your amazingly kind comments.  I'm too tired to go through and respond to them tonight, but I promise to respond to each of them asap!
“How about we get you cleaned up,” Papa suggested, neglecting to answer Sherlock’s request for the moment.  “We can cuddle a bit once we’ve cleaned up your boo-boos and you’re in some dry clothes, and we can talk if you feel up to it?”
A voice in the back of his mind told him he was overtired and overreacting after a nearly sleepless night, that he was jumping to conclusions and that all would be set right again after some atonement.  But Sherlock was not in a position to accept rational mindsets at the moment, and allowed the sudden possibility of ageplaying without Bunny to bring about loud, guttural sobs which made his throat ache.  His mind was swarming with questions: What if Bunny didn’t want to play with him anymore? What if Papa and Mycroft decided Sherlock couldn’t be Bunny’s brother now that he’d been so rude and mean?  What if they didn’t let him be little anymore?
This chapter is much longer than expected.  I thought about breaking it into two chapters, but the two parts build on each other so I eventually decided to keep them as one.  Hopefully it's all enjoyable!  This chapter is a mix of angst and comfort/cuteness and we've got a little wetting thrown in there for fun!  Thanks for those of you who have sent ideas about this story and please continue to do so--the boys have the lake house for an entire long weekend, and the narrative right now only goes through Friday afternoon, so there's lots more we can explore.
Sending Bunny kisses and wishing you all a great day!  You're all the best, and you're all appreciated :)
And, as Sherlock was carried upstairs to be cleaned up and dressed in a diaper and his most comfortable pajamas, he felt the plaguing guilt shifting away.  For the moment, all was strong hands and stuffed animals and the prospect of being fed a warm meal, and Sherlock was bundled up, content.
Greg awoke to the clattering of pots and pans from down in the kitchen.  He stretched, allowing himself to take up more of the mattress than he had all night when he had been attempting to make room for the boys between him and Mycroft.  His arm fell into a cold wet spot on the sheets, and he sat up, registering for the first time that Sherlock and Mycroft were absent, and must be the culprits making noise down in the kitchen.  Sherlock must have wet the bed, and Mycroft must either have had an upset Sherlock to distract, or must not have wanted to disturb them, and thus had not yet changed the sheets.
When John was finished, he was overcome with a momentary relief that quickly settled into animosity.  He shouldn’t have had coffee, he shouldn’t have let Sherlock drag him around the entire day, and he shouldn’t have fucking pissed himself.  Without any forethought, he punched against the brick wall of the house with a quick, angry jab which left him grasping his hand in pain.
Bunny could see that Daddy had also noticed how much bigger Sherlock was than last night.  He raised an eyebrow as Sherlock spoke, then glanced over at Bunny with a smile meant to encourage despite the negativity Sherlock was already bringing to their wake-up call.
Luckily, it seemed Sherlock was not in the mood to strop, and it only took two requests and one threat of a time-out to get the boy to leave his pirate ship behind and rush to the loo off the hallway to wash his hands.
Sherlock shook his head, which he'd rested against his raised knees before closing his eyes.  Mycroft sighed, then reached across his brother to find the seatbelt himself.
“Perfectly,” Mycroft said, taking a step forward.  “For now.  There are situations in the past which made the situation...precarious.  Volatile.”
John shook his head, not engaging with Sherlock’s stalling tactics.  He waited until Sherlock was lying prone on the bed, then began running his fingertips up and down the boy’s back, singing some half-remembered song under his breath.  Sherlock was restless for only a moment before settling down, and then his body became boneless and limp as he absently suckled on his pacifier.
Mycroft did not understand what appeal the chatrooms brought to his brother--the crimes discussed were generally simple and mundane, neighborhood disputes Sherlock could solve in mere moments with the right evidence or unsolved cases from years ago fraught with conspiracy theories and false opinions.  Mycroft assumed he actually took more pleasure from insulting the intelligence of the amateur armchair detectives who posted leads and question to the sites than from solving the cases or providing leads.
Eventually, however, Bunny’s bladder was too full to keep from shifting back and forth on his feet as he followed Sherlock's orders to cook the captain’s dinner--shark meat, Sherlock said, from the shark he had captured single-handedly.  He started to cry, feeling uncomfortable and out of options.  Sherlock ignored him.  The bunny was confused, stuck between his own needs and the desire to be a big kid and please his big brother.
“What happened to the baby?” he asked with a concerned glance towards John.  “Did he have a bad dream, too?”
And now Sherlock was close to tears, eyes shining behind the wet hair falling into his face.  The thunderstorm was pounding outside and in the darkened room Sherlock looked pitiful and alone, somehow younger than his age.  John fumbled in his pocket and drew out his mobile.
John squirmed out of his briefs and then stepped into the pull-up that Mycroft, kneeling before him, held out.  Mycroft was careful to work it up John’s thighs and hips, and John stood still and let Mycroft do the work, not wanting it to tear.  He could not help but put his fingers in his mouth as the pull-up was settled on his waist, an overwhelming sense of care and comfort washing over him.  He felt like his true little self, cared for and accepted.  For once, he didn’t have to hide or worry about who he was, and he smiled widely as he reached down to feel the bulk of the pull-up between his legs before diving forward and pressing himself to Mycroft in another hug.
to click a certain button of appreciation <3.  A new one-shot should hopefully be posted there in the next few days.
“Hey, no tears,” Greg said, attempting to quiet the boy before he woke Sherlock once more.  “Just a little accident.  We’ll get you cleaned up in no time.”
“That hurts,” Sherlock lied once again, squirming in his seat and attempting to yank his hand from Mycroft's grip.  His voice high-pitched and huffy.  He needed Mycroft to stop talking.
John must have hesitated for too long, because the next thing he knew he could feel Sherlock’s fingertips on the bare skin of his stomach, and he was squirming away.
Greg was unsure whether to push the man or let him be.  He was grateful he hadn’t had to encourage the kid to go inside to pee--in John’s current in-between headspace he would likely have been offended by the suggestion--but there were other concerns on his mind, namely what he guessed to be self-deprecating thoughts spinning through the man’s mind.
Mycroft took a moment to himself before returning to face Greg in the kitchen, perched on the edge of the bed beside a sleeping Sherlock.  He hadn’t meant to upset their little Bunny.  The kid had seemed okay; Mycroft was still unclear about what exactly had upset the boy so much.
Mycroft carried the boy back towards the bed, settling him and then climbing in beside him.  Sherlock absent-mindedly fiddled with the bottom hem of Mycroft’s t-shirt.
“Papa?” Bunny asked, holding onto Greg’s hand and absently tracing lines in his palm, eyes downcast.
"I'm sorry," John managed, his last shred of dignity causing him to cling to whatever sense of adulthood he still possessed.  "It's been a long day.  I...I didn't mean to get like this..."
Sherlock would close himself into the spare bedroom farthest down the hall.  It was the room that Sherlock insisted on staying in when he was in his older moods, far away from the treasure maps and pirate lore of his more childish bedroom at Mycroft’s, which he deemed beneath him.  He’d somehow convinced Mycroft to get him a video game console for the spare telly in the guest room; when he was in moods like the one he was now, he would play for hours on end, only leaving when forced to join them for meals.
John shook his head.  He was nervous and awkward and had so many questions emerging in his mind.  But, more than anything, he wanted Sherlock to be happy.  He had been worried sick about him for the past few days while Sherlock was out of contact with him.  He needed to be close to Sherlock and to encourage him that he was there for him as much as Sherlock seemed to need regression right now.  John was a caretaker by nature, that much was sure, this was just another form of caretaking, after all.
“It’s okay, Daddy,” Bunny said as he climbed up onto the couch and pressed himself close against Mycroft, who wrapped an arm around him and absentmindedly ran his hand up and down the boy’s back.  “We can have hot chocolate another time.”
John and Sherlock settled back against the headboard with a stack of Sherlock-approved children’s books, and, over the course of the next forty-five minutes, John read and Sherlock pointed out details on each page that he believed told an entirely different story, weaving tales of underhanded plots and secrets hidden.
Sherlock leaned forward to lay his head on Mycroft’s shoulder.  He took his thumb into his mouth, and was grateful when Mycroft did not tell him to take it out when he started to suck, sensing that Sherlock needed the comfort at the moment.
Four months had passed, and John had been settling well into his role as Sherlock’s little brother.  They had been making progress with John feeling comfortable enough to stay in headspace for longer periods of time and Mycroft, catching on to John's need to process verbally, had been through numerous conversations regarding the rules and treatments which worked best for John when he was in little space.  Mycroft, for his part, was intrigued with the prospect of having to navigate a new relationship with its own regulations, and he had been enjoying the new challenge of caring for two littles instead of just one.  He took pride in the progress John had been making.  John still disliked being little in public, so the trip to the zoo had been one planned for just Lestrade and Sherlock.  Mycroft expected to spend the morning alone with John, who often took to an age of roughly three to six years old, always a bit younger than Sherlock’s chosen age each day.  But when Mycroft was woken up to Sherlock’s insistent excitement far too early in the morning, he found a shy John tugging on his dressing gown and asking if he could go along to the zoo as well.
He reached a hand down to card his fingers through Bunny’s still-damp hair, trying to soothe the kid.  The boy had been rather non-verbal since they’d arrived home, so Mycroft and Greg were doing what they could to keep an eye on anything he may need.  That said, Neither Sherlock nor John had had much trouble aging down once they’d arrived at Mycroft’s, both having taken the car ride into London to shift into a younger headspace.  It was clear from the way John became vulnerable and clingy almost as soon as they’d closed the front door that it hadn’t just been Sherlock who’d found himself caught between headspaces over the past few days.
Mycroft was more than a little touched by the kid’s offer.  The fact of the matter was that he indeed felt a bit unmoored at the moment.  He’d thought that under the twinkling lights Greg had strung around the house he’d feel differently, that he’d view Christmas in a new way through the eyes of little Sherlock and little Bunny.  But it was all a bit too much.
The only trouble they had aside from the tears Sherlock shed occurred just as John was tying off the last stitch, as the front door opened and heavy footsteps accompanied by the clack of a walking stick--umbrella, in Mycroft's case--were heard on the stairs leading to 221b.  Upon the first step, Sherlock tried to jerk his arm away, beginning to stand up, but John held him firmly in place until he could take scissors to the stitch thread.  As soon as he was free Sherlock hurried to hide behind the cabinets in the far corner of the kitchen.
“Buddy, Papa found your wet jeans and undies beneath the guest room bed,” Mycroft said, and suddenly Sherlock was twisting to hide his reddening face in the crook of his brother’s neck, tears again filling his eyes as he choked on a sob.
Beside him, Bunny mumbled around a mouthful of toothbrush and foaming toothpaste, looking towards Sherlock and then to Greg.
Bunny smiled widely and stepped forward to wrap Greg--and, because he was cuddled in Greg’s arms, Sherlock--in a spontaneous hug, thanking him again and again.
He found the searched-for disc in a mismatched case and boorishly shoved it into the console.  He fished a controller out from a mess of tangled wires he’d neglected to put away neatly last time, then reached to turn on the telly.  He'd settled on an adventure quest, and sat cross-legged on the carpet as he waited for the home screen to load.  He took a certain pleasure in sitting closer to the telly than Mycroft or Papa liked.
Daddy cupped the back of his neck to hug him close as he told him it would all go away soon.  Bunny tried to believe him, grateful that Daddy never told him it was
“Sherlock,” Mycroft had said as Sherlock left for the sleepover, turning from his math homework when Sherlock passed his room.  “Call me if you need anything.”
“No I don’t,” Sherlock said.  He prodded at a clump of mud he had clenched in his fist, searching through for any interesting observations to be made about the soil composition.
Mycroft sighed, took a long gulp to finish off his tea.  “It’s generally part of the pattern,” was all he said.  He rose from the table and stretched.
The flat was quiet.  They stepped gently up the staircase and peeked into the living room.  Given the state of the apartment--puzzle pieces strewn about the carpet, a bath towel left tossed over the back of a kitchen chair, the boys were certainly in, and at least one of them was little.
And despite the fact that they were four grown men sharing one bed, they fell asleep curled against each other, Mycroft and Greg protecting their boys from the darkness.
Mycroft was not proud of the fact that, rather than admit that he was hurt by John’s decision to make light of their relationship and perhaps even jealous of what Mycroft assumed was a newly formed alliance between John and Sherlock, his first instinct was to challenge John, to beat him at his own game.
“Keep your hand out of your mouth, Bunny,” Mycroft said when he noticed John about to suck his muddy thumb.
“Ariel,” John said, nodding.  He had named the lion after The Little Mermaid.  Mycroft had read to him one night from a book of Hans Christian Andersen fairy tales and, after seeing how much John had liked hearing about mermaids and the ocean, had shown him the Disney movie one afternoon while Sherlock and Greg had played a board game in the kitchen.  Sherlock had teased John for using a girl’s name for his lion and had called him girly for liking mermaids, but Mycroft had put Sherlock in the corner and told John it was a lovely name and both boys and girls could like whatever they pleased.
“And that’s when this...arrangement began?” John asked, unsure how to begin the conversation of what he had witnessed that night.
Bunny was sent into a squealing excitement.  The younger boy dragged Sherlock out of his chair and to the fridge.  Then, thrusting the chosen sheet of stickers into his hands, told him to put his sticker on his chart.  Sherlock obeyed hesitantly, all too aware of the disheartened looks he was receiving from Mycroft and Papa, glances he was attempting to ignore as he peeled the sticker from its sheet and placed it off-centered in the first box of his chart.
“Sorry, My,” Sherlock said, letting his head fall against Mycroft’s chest.  “I promise I didn’t mean to.”
It had been some time since John had cared for a young Sherlock, and he was pleased Mycroft and Greg had been able to pick up the slack while John had been dwelling for longer times in little space.  As much as he loved caring for Sherlock, the quiet nights back at Baker Street shared by the two of them, There were questions he still needed to answer about being little, questions he knew Mycroft and Greg were wordlessly helping him to process by caring for him as attentively as they had over the course of their time at the lake house.
There was a hush as Greg paused on his route to the bedroom and Mycroft peered over his newspaper.  John stopped his forkful of scrambled eggs mid-way to his mouth.
“Want to wear pull-ups and get stickers on a chart,” he said, still staring down at his stuffed rabbit.  “Want it not to be so bad if I have accidents.”
“You should have told me, Bun,” he said, guiding the boy to the toilet at the far side of the bathroom and helping him with his pajama trousers and rather sopping underwear.  “Nothing to be ashamed of.”
Questions of self-doubt crowded his thoughts.  He felt his chest tight as he struggled to breathe through the flashbacks, suddenly filled to the brim with self-hatred and fear.  The memories had the effect of simultaneously shaming him and forcing him lower in headspace.  He quickly pushed the pull up off his waist and down his legs, feeling disgusted with himself for wanting to wear it and desperate to prove that he wasn't weak and vulnerable.  He didn't need something so babyish, so indicative of lack of control.  But even as he hid the discarded pull-up way back behind cleaning supplies in the cabinet below the sink, he felt himself needier than before, more fearful and anxious.
“Just a bad dream, kid,” Sherlock said, his eyes closed and head leaned back when Bunny glanced up to look at him.  “We’ll be okay.”
“That’s very nice of you, kid,” Uncle Greg said, “But let’s get some pants on that bum of yours.  It’s time for bed.”
But John did not catch the teasing nature of Mycroft’s question, and his eyes were sincere as he nodded emphatically.
He turned towards his bedroom, little of which had been changed since he had left for uni, but Mycroft stopped him.
Sherlock looked as if he were about to argue for only a moment before turning on his heels to trudge up the stairs, through the kitchen, and into his bedroom, Mycroft following close behind to supervise.
This chapter gave me a bit of trouble, but after the third edit I think I got it to a place that I'm okay posting it.  One of you lovely readers gave me the idea a while back to potentially explore the idea that John's father was not exactly the best influence in his young life, which was interesting to play with here.  Thanks also for those of you who suggested that an argument and/or other commotion may set John sinking into headspace at the crime scene--that was a great help in getting me over a major hurdle of this chapter!
I had planned for this to be the final Chapter of this story, had even outlined the way I wanted to end the storyline, but our impulsive and mischievous Sherlock had other ideas, so you'll get at least one or two more in this story before we wrap things up.
Once hair had been washed and the boys were done playing, Mycroft wrapped them in oversized towels and brought them to Sherlock’s bedroom, the room they shared when in headspace.  The boys shared Sherlock’s bed, but each had their own twin-sized comforter covered in childish patterns: Sherlock had a dinosaur comforter and John had chosen butterflies, which Sherlock teased for being too girly until Mycroft threatened to take away his dinosaur quilt.  Mycroft had recently ordered a new comforter for John, a Harry Potter pattern which he thought, now that they had begun to read the books, John might even prefer over his butterflies.
It felt strange to think of Bunny as ‘she.’  But Sherlock remembered the way Mycroft said Bunny needed to listen to his heart when it told him to be a girl in the same way Sherlock had to listen when he felt extra small.  If Bunny was feeling like a girl, Sherlock had to let him be a girl.
“The Bunny doesn't look too good,” Greg said with concern in his voice, glancing across the room at John, who was not playing but sat hugging his lion to him and sucking on his pacifier as he watched Sherlock build with Legos.
It was Mycroft who called an end to the punishment, refusing to go on despite Sherlock’s desperate pleading.  They had already gone on far longer than they ever had before, and Sherlock was a snivelling mess, bonelessly flopped over Mycroft’s knees until he felt his older brother’s arms hoisting him up onto his lap, where he held him close as Sherlock cried.
He couldn’t tell Mycroft.  What if he was mad?  If he clicked his tongue and rolled his eyes, sighing in disappointment as he sent him to clean himself up?  Sherlock had been bratty all day, and Mycroft didn’t usually let him forget bad behavior.  The prospect of telling Papa was just as bad: the man would baby and coddle and remind him that he should always use the loo as soon as he felt the need.  What if he took out the dumb training chart and made Sherlock write an ‘X’ on it? Then everyone would know he’d wet himself the first day and was nothing more than a baby.
“He knows something’s wrong,” Greg explained with a sigh as he stepped up behind Mycroft, who was washing lunch dishes at the kitchen sink.  “Asked if we could stay if he was ‘just a boy tonight.’”
“I don’t want to play a girl’s game with you!” he said all at once, throwing the clothes back towards Bunny as he shouted.  “I don’t like girls and I don’t like you when you’re not normal!”
He brought his thumb to his lips and Mycroft, tsking, guided his hand away.  Sherlock needed structure and rules at the moment.  His thumb-sucking had become something a bit more complicated in recent weeks, and thus Mycroft had not routinely chastised the boy for the act.  But the current incident was clearly a ploy for attention and discipline, which Mycroft could easily provide.
“Yes, baby?” Greg asked.  He had to admit he found it adorable when the boy was on the younger side of his headspace, even sweeter and more compliant than usual.
“You have to call me Bunny, now,” John said, a bit louder.  This is what he needed.  Mycroft would be proud of him for voicing his needs.
John seemed unable to finish his thought, but Mycroft nodded as if he understood something Greg didn't.  The man was certainly better at reading John’s expressions and emotions than Greg was.
He returned to the bathroom in high spirits to find his good little bunny playing quietly with his mermaids.
John nodded, but his eyes were vulnerable when he next glanced up at Mycroft, full of his signature insecurity.
The line was cut off before Greg could say anything else, and Sherlock’s phone went to voicemail when Greg hurriedly called back.  Swearing under his breath and advising himself against expecting the worst and working himself up, Greg pulled back onto the road and began to make his way back into the city, pushing speed limits.  He called Mycroft’s phone on the way, but the man immediately sent him to voicemail, clearly unaware of the current state of Sherlock and increasing Greg's unsease.
Mycroft tapped him on the bum to signal that he should go take what Bunny was offering, and Sherlock smiled slightly as he accepted the pacifier into his mouth.
All told, John was most confused about the statements Mycroft had made about Sherlock’s wetting, the way in which he spoke so nonchalantly about Sherlock’s frequent accidents, the way in which he seemed perplexed that John hadn’t already seen it happen to Sherlock when the man was out of headspace.
John nodded, squirming in the wet spot he had made and wiping at his eyes with the backs of his hands.  He had not yet started to cry, but he felt as if he might.  “Want to talk to him,” he said.
"I'll be there as soon as I can," Mycroft said at last, and John felt relief, felt grateful that Sherlock had a brother who had always taken care of him, no questions asked.  "Don't make him talk if he doesn't want to.  And check to see that he hasn't hurt himself."
“Sherlock, hun,” Mycroft said as Sherlock spooned macaroni and cheese into his mouth.  “Can I talk to you for a moment, bud?”
Greg nodded.  He'd been thinking of this as a new way for the boys to lose themselves in ageplay.  It was an opportunity for them to feel comfortable sinking low in age and a way for Greg and Mycroft to reinforce their care for them, to encourage them.  But Mycroft was right.  There was potentially more at stake for Sherlock, and he had to be sensitive to his boy’s fears, fears hiding beneath the surface of his moodiness.
Mycroft had more to ask about Bunny’s age and mental state, but there were some conversations best had in person.  He’d had too much experience with the faulty privacy of electronic communication, and knew Greg was likely surrounded by family members who may or may not decide to get nosy as Greg texted.
Once he had assured himself that the coast was clear, he hurried across the hallway and into his bedroom, inadvertently slamming the door behind him in his haste to close himself away from anyone’s prying eyes.  His heart was beating quickly as he prayed no one had heard the noise, and, because Mycroft had removed the locks from the boys’ bedroom doors, he dragged the desk chair over to the doorway and propped it beneath the doorknob to keep anyone from barging in on him.  He then closed the door connecting his room to Bunny’s, wishing he had another chair with which to barricade himself but not wanting to take up any more time looking for something.
Sherlock was getting progressively more frustrated as he played.  He was racing through a dark path in a jungle, sword out to slash away vines and leaves in his way.  But he wasn’t making any progress, consistently failing to recognize the dangerous traps waiting for him and falling prey to them.  When he made a wrong turn and his character fell into quicksand and was forced to start again at the beginning of the level, he threw his controller to the ground with an angry growl and then kicked it away from him, crossing his arms and twisting his body away from the telly.
He pressed his back against the base of his chair in order to have greater support as he cradled Sherlock to his chest, muttering soothing phrases into his ear.  The boy cried into his sweater, soft and pitiful, mumbling about Redbeard and riddles and nightmares at Musgrave while John rocked him back and forth, arms wrapped tight around his body.
Thanks so much for your continued love for this world and your lovely comments/kudos! If you've gained as much enjoyment from this world as a cup of coffee and would like to support in another way, head on over to my tumblr
He wanted his Daddy to stop being angry, and if watching dinosaurs meant they could cuddle and Daddy would stop feeling annoyed, he would try to forget about how happy he had felt seeing the colorful ponies and just let Sherlock watch dinosaurs.
“This way, brother mine,” Mycroft said, walking into Sherlock’s bedroom.  He had found it far easier to let the boy come to him instead of chasing and catching and dragging.  Sherlock was, after all, desperate for attention.
“I'm sorry I spilled the beans on that one, kid,” Greg said, scrubbing a hand over his face.  “Mycroft and Bunny were going to tell you, when the time was right.”
Mycroft took Sherlock to the master bedroom, hoping eventually to get Bunny to nap with Sherlock in the larger bed, where he knew both of his boys would be content and safe, and neither would be alone.  Luckily, two nights of barely any sleep and a younger headspace made for a pliable Sherlock, and it took only a diaper change and a back rub to get Sherlock down for a nap.
“Time out, now, Mycroft?” Sherlock asked, knowing one was long overdue, that Mycroft had not finished punishing.
Greg seemed to understand John’s mental state in the moment was rather fragile, and he pulled out his mobile and found Mycroft’s contact quickly.
“I don't want to be tied up, Sherlock,” Bunny whined before breaking down into a sneezing fit once more.  He rubbed his nose against his shoulder because his hands were tied behind him.
John nodded, squirming a bit in the seat as he swallowed and waited for Papa’s attention to return to the road.  Sherlock cast a momentary sideways glance towards John, and it became clear from his expression that he knew the predicament John was in.  Luckily, he only looked at him with interest for a moment before turning back to his video game, choosing not to give John away.
“You know you can always come to me or Papa if you’re feeling confused or upset,” Daddy said with a sigh.  “It’s disappointing that you chose instead to behave in a destructive manner.”
“Of course,” Mycroft said, finding himself just wanting to comfort the man.  He reached across the table and patted John’s hand, signalling with the endearment that John could slip completely if he needed to.  He pulled a pen and pad of paper from his suit coat’s breast pocket.  “Just as soon as you settle on a safeword.  Write it down for me, love.”
He remembered coming to bed with Sherlock after taking a joint shower where the two men had spent more time with their hands over each other than they had getting clean.  John had never been much for shower sex, but the night before it had been the most convenient venue given the fact that they were both practically dripping with urine.  They’d fallen into bed not long after, Sherlock giving way to sleep very quickly after sex, John not far behind.
“Don’t complain about what arouses you, Dr. Watson,” Sherlock said, pressing his knee up between John’s thighs.
Mycroft smiled and nodded.  “Just like, bud.  Now show your little brother how big boys use the loo.”
He reached for the cardboard folder that his paper dolls had come in, feeling a bit more confident after his chat with Papa that there was nothing wrong with wanting to play with them.  But when he flipped open the top flap and turned the envelope over, it was not paper dolls and paper clothes that fell out onto the living room carpet, but small pieces of cardstock, irregular and torn.
Attempted lightheartedness, a ploy used to shift the tone away from misbehavior and anger.  Sherlock had experienced it first-hand from his brother.  It didn’t work on him, and Sherlock could see that, although it had worked to keep Bunny from getting upset in the past, it would not work on the bunny now.
Bunny left his pacifier and his nightshirt behind in his bedroom and let Daddy carry him away from what he couldn’t have.
“It’s okay if you’d like to wait until later,” Mycroft said, wanting Bunny to know he had every right to space if that’s what he needed at the moment.  “It’s your decision.”
“Good as new,” Greg said after tossing the pillows back into position at the head of the bed.  “Need some help getting dressed?”
“Sherlock!” Lestrade and Mycroft both chided at the same time.  John certainly was always the younger of the two, but he hated to be called the baby.  Sherlock knew this, and used the term unapologetically and harshly.
“I don’t lose the ability to hear or to see when I’m young, John,” Sherlock said with a sigh, as if tired by John’s shock.  “And, because I know you likely didn’t believe me the first time this issue came up: it’s fine.  I don’t have nearly as many gender-hang-ups as you.  Any anger or displeasure regarding your choice of gender which may or may not be displayed by my younger self is firmly rooted in selfish jealousy over the attention it brings to you and not, I can assure you, rooted in disgust of any kind.”
“How about this?” Greg asked, pulling the boy gently away from his chest in order to look him in the eye.  “If you can be a big boy all day and not use a pacifier or suck your thumb, you can have your paci back for storytime and bedtime.  Does that sound okay?”
John was calm and little for the first time in nearly a month, and he could not help but feel a strong sense of contented relief.  He smiled into his Daddy’s shoulder and allowed himself to rest his eyes as his Papa and Daddy sipped tea and spoke softly over his head about elections and grocery shopping and work colleagues.  At another time, he would be following their train of thought, eager to contribute his own ideas and questions.  But, at the moment, he was content to listen to nothing more than the familiar hum of their voices as he revelled in the warmth of his Daddy’s chest and envisioned his training chart full of sparkly, shining stickers, each one labeling him a good, smart boy.
Sherlock winked and retreated to turn on the shower as John carried the bedding out of the room towards the laundry.
He dropped the glass to the floor and stepped around to the other side of the bedroom.  He couldn’t face Mycroft.  Mycroft would take responsibility for Sherlock’s actions, would struggle to hide his disappointment and then blame himself.  He would think he’d failed Sherlock.
Sherlock seemed to realize his name calling just after he’d spoken, and he gasped and clapped a hand to his mouth.  Uncle Greg chuckled and told him it was okay, he hadn't meant to call Bunny a baby.  He stood up, patting him on the knee to calm his worries that he had been naughty.  Bunny nuzzled into Sherlock’s shoulder to let him know he didn’t mind being called a baby just this once; he was simply grateful that Sherlock had known what he needed and that Greg had immediately pulled himself from bed to retrieve the bunny blanket.  He was back a moment later, and Bunny hugged the blanket beneath his chin and rested his head on his Daddy’s chest.
I can't begin to tell you all how kind and sweet your comments are, especially because I had some reservations about the last chapter!  Your encouragement definitely motivated me to get this chapter finished sooner than I anticipated.
“Not for Mycroft or myself,” he explained, forcing himself to meet his brother’s gaze.  “But Mycroft is certain the dynamic plays into John and Sherlock’s sexual relationship.”
Sherlock moaned and bent nearly in half, legs pressed together tightly and hands clenched at his sides.
This chapter has been basically finished for a few days now, but has been giving me a TON of trouble--I've gone back to edit again and again but still haven't felt that it's as successful as I'd like it to be.  Depicting Mycroft's intentions and motivations was tough without getting into my usual trap of over-explaining, but I tried to pare the exposition down to only what was necessary.  Maybe I'll come back and edit a bit, but I figured I should probably just get it up and move forward.
Sherlock nodded, then braced himself as Mycroft began spanking once more.  His skin felt raw, and each slap stung until he felt numb and pliable.  He was young by the time Mycroft decided he was finished, wiping tears from his eyes as Mycroft sat him up and helped him back into his trousers.
He placed his palms against the boy’s cheeks and then the back of his hand against his forehead.  The boy did feel clammy, his forehead warm and cheeks flushed.  He glanced up at Greg, eyebrow raised.
“I’ll let you take the lead, bud, unless you tell me otherwise, okay?  I want you to be comfortable.”
Sherlock’s bedwetting had led to nights which were the earliest beginnings of their age play, nights they didn't speak of where Mycroft cleaned and comforted and cuddled his brother while Sherlock let go of his stubborn smarminess and became somehow vulnerable.  They were nights Sherlock had always wanted more of, nights not fully realized until he was nineteen and Mycroft had picked him up from uni and brought him home once and for all.
It had all just been too much at once: Greg arriving before John and Sherlock had even gotten out of bed, the man settling into caretaker mode immediately as he cooked them breakfast and roused them awake, John slipping down seemingly without a second thought and leaving Sherlock alone with his doubts and worries.
It was a relief that Sherlock seemed to not have placed an identity to the girl he’d remembered.  If Mycroft acted quickly, he may still be able to keep that particular association hidden.  It was time to adopt the most fitting role.
Warnings for sex (fairly non-explicit, in my mind, but I'm not sure of everyone's tolerance levels) between Greg and Mycroft at the end of this chapter.
It seemed that the safest course of action was to hide, especially as he felt tears welling in his eyes and knew he was moments away from beginning to cry.  Slipping from beneath the sheets and blankets as carefully as possible so as not to disturb Sherlock, John scrambled into the closet near his side of the bed.  He huddled beneath Sherlock’s clothes hung above him, pulling his knees to his chest after he’d closed the door.  He couldn’t help but chew on the edge of his thumb, the darkness frightening as tears fell.
But the commotion had clearly been loud enough to have caused Papa concern, because he was suddenly in the bedroom, crossing to heft a tearful little Sherlock into his arms.
The feeling was strange given that John had never woken up in headspace when he had gone to sleep as an adult.  The nightmare must have sunk him down.  He could still feel stabs of fear as flashes of warfare replayed in his mind.  He reached up to wipe the tears from his eyes and grasped blindly for his pacifier.
If Greg or Mycroft overheard, they would chastise Sherlock for just how pleased he sounded at the prospect of Anderson’s pain.  But they were downstairs, out of earshot, and John couldn’t help but smirk.  After the lingering remorse he’d felt underlying the afternoon and evening, it was nice to imagine for a moment that punching Anderson hadn’t been a mistake.
Greg smirked back towards Mycroft, catching his eye.  The spark of connection that had come over them as they made out on the couch downstairs earlier that day was still buzzing between them, perhaps even elevated by the way in which Greg had impressed Mycroft by managing to right the afternoon’s wrongs in one fell-swoop.
Sherlock stumbled against a fold in the floor rug as Mycroft dragged him across the bedroom and shoved him unceremoniously into the corner.  He could see Bunny--no, John--watching from the doorway, but Sherlock registered little above the haze of contented relief he felt under Mycroft’s authority.
“Does this mean Bunny’s my nephew, now?”  Sherlock scrunched up his face in displeasure.  He didn't want to be an Uncle.
John resented Mycroft’s attempt to turn John’s betrayal into something admirable.  He hadn’t been protecting Sherlock; he’d been protecting himself, protecting the little Bunny within who was desperate for attention.
“Uncle Greg?” Sherlock called, voice a bit louder, and this time the men stirred.  It was Uncle Greg who, with a deep breath, woke up to glance up at them.
Greg had the kid easily settled, sending him back to the living room with a sippy cup of apple juice for himself and one of grape juice for John.
Sherlock was pleased with the way in which his shoulder ached as it pressed against the lip of the dresser's top.  He hadn’t shown Mycroft enough affection when he was in headspace, so his brother had gone and found it in Bunny.  He hadn’t been there for John as an emotional support in their relationship, so the doctor was drawn to Mycroft’s care.
“Feel better, little string bean,” he whispered as he pulled the boy’s bedroom door nearly all the way closed.  “Call for me if you need anything.”
“You’re a bunny, you’re a bunny, you’re my bunny,” John whispered to himself the way Mycroft sometimes had to when John got extra upset and could not keep himself from a panic attack without comfort and reassurance.
“Come here, love,” John said, shifting his hand up to the nape of Sherlock’s neck and pulling him close.  “I’ve got you.”
“Bunny?  Are you okay, lad?” Mycroft had noticed something was off, was glancing up at John, who stood frozen in the middle of the room.
Bunny hung his head and pushed the ketchup around on his plate with the tail of a dinosaur chicken nugget.  He tried not to be upset with his Daddy; he’d had a busy few days, and Bunny hadn’t exactly been the easiest kid that day, what with running away from Uncle Greg at the store and then wetting himself when he was crying in his bedroom.
Mycroft sat up in bed, casting aside the book he had been reading since he’d brought Sherlock upstairs to bed.  He’d heard his parents come up to bed some time ago and had quickly flipped his bedside light off to keep them from knowing he was still awake, rolling his eyes at the sheer childishness of it all yet barely breathing again until he’d heard them settle into bed in the next room and had turned his light back on.
