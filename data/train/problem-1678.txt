"So you think he shouldn't be seeing him."
Because he was no Sherlock Holmes, but he could connect the dots.
"Meet me in the lab. I want to run an experiment on the tissue of diseased liver. You've got one, don't you?"
at least deserve more than
Once again, the genius huffed, his piercing eyes shifted to glare out the window. "If I recall correctly, that conversation was started by you." He folded his arms even tighter, still refusing to look at either of them. Once again, his little finger started scratching angrily in the crook of his arm.
try to keep up."
He wants--
Ministrations now complete, John turns away to sit down back in his chair, dropping down like a puppet with its strings cut and then his face into his hands. Sherlock's been home five minutes and he already looks like he regrets it, and the feeling sinks in his stomach like a stone.
"Or... was I right, with Sherlock?" Oscar started, before he'd even reached three. "He's sleeping with you, too?" There was a short pause that reeked in smugness, and even with his eyes shut he could just
They were going to be okay.
He hated them. He'd hated them before and he hated every single staff member at that school now. He hated the ones who'd blown Sherlock off, he hated the ones who must've felt something was off but ignored it, and he hated the ones who'd believed Oscar over him.
"My boyfriend," he starts, and for this one, he turns so he can get right into the idiot's face. "My boyfriend says that he thinks you're an idiot."
He didn't realise until John's hands gently closed around his that he had been perfectly silent, now, approaching on two minutes. Three? His brain had been knocked offline. And John didn't like when he did that, John worried--
John sees it now, too.
"Sherlock--"
Then, after rounding it off with a lukewarm cup of coffee, he squares his shoulders, and marches back to Sherlock's room.
Mycroft is capable, of course. And though he is a smug, arrogant prat, he likes to be smug when Sherlock is present as a captive audience, from one of his ridiculous rooms at the Diogenes. Not at all via text message while Sherlock freezes himself to death twenty steps away from a crack den.
Just another nudge...
The joy dims, but her smile does
Neither of those things had been true.
"Sorry?"
"I donotsmell like... do not. Smell like wine. That's you. But. I'llgladlytake- take a showww... shower. With you anyway. You look wonderful. This morning. Shouldget... shouldgetdrunk-- more oft--"
"Sherlock," Mycroft breathed. He, too, sagged on the spot, covering his face with an exhausted hand. It was as if all the stress and worry had eased out of him and left him deflated and empty, but
thing to say to Sherlock, then that's it. He's done. If she opens her mouth and even starts to say the word
decades later just to throw a wrench in the life Sherlock had built with his own blood, sweat, and tears.
Because, mind palace John, for all that he is exactly what Sherlock knows that he wants--
Sherlock has never been stellar at knowing what exactly it is that he wants. For many years, the height of that question was answerable in
He'd tried as hard as he could and pushed himself too far and John wants nothing more than to stay up here and hold him and shush him down and make him another cup of tea. And to throw Mycroft down the stairs.
John didn't stop in to visit Dr. Andrews. He was pretty sure he'd well and burned that bridge already.
"As it turns out," he went on, "not even Mycroft has all that much pull with the Nobel committee, and this is all a bit... unprecedented. There's really no promises, there. But I talked to someone who said if the story gains traction, if it does really well and public pressure starts up, then maybe there'd be something they could do."
Mycroft held a finger to his lips, meeting John's eyes and waiting there in the silence of the flat, only the vibrating of his phone to break the fallout of the devastated quiet that had settled after all that John had learned here tonight. John nodded once, not daring to even open his mouth,
Sherlock. And that is precisely the problem.
Sherlock finally wrenches one of his hands free, long fingers cupped to the side of John's neck and pressing right into his pulse. He presses so hard it's almost uncomfortable, an obstruction forced inwards as he tries to breathe, but he lets him do it without complaint.
Sherlock shuts his eyes again before she can realise he's awake.
"Your face is always on a tabloid, Mr. Holmes. Although I think I'd have recognised you, anyway-- I'm a huge fan of the blogs. Both of them, actually." Francis shakes his hand vigorously with a huge smile, not letting go until Sherlock has unrooted himself enough to finally shake back. "And I suppose what I'm saying is, it would be very remiss of me, if I didn't get to have the great Sherlock Holmes deduce me before this is all over. I'm sure you've built up quite a lot to say."
"Oh," he sighed, squeezing a hand to the bridge of his nose. "Did I say that aloud?"
as to not be able to hold his own tongue. He would not then have proceeded to languish in his own failure while John suffered for it, and perhaps most unforgivable of all, he would not be still sitting here now, clawing his words back one by one but only able to impart them to baristas in a coffeehouse and dogs in a park.
Thank you so much for all the comments/kudos!!! (I think I got to them all! :D)
He kisses John's wet face, and then, snatches up the crinkled papers again, to redraw his attention to the very last line.
"So get another one. You're overqualified as it is." Sherlock didn't understand; it could not be that John was worried about finding another job, was it? Certainly not. Or perhaps- oh,
He didn't want to go. The very last thing in the world Sherlock wanted to do was step outside and go on this date, and... and John didn't understand why, but the very last thing he wanted to do was to let him.
"And I still don't know..." The words were stuck in his throat, festering there, like an infected wound, and they didn't want to come out at all but he had to say them. He'd shouted at Sherlock to get a girlfriend, hadn't he? Told him he wasn't a
John shrugged. He didn't really care, how Sherlock had deduced it. "Yeah. Dad died years ago-- got drunk again and hit his head. I'd say it was poetic justice, but I think karma's a load of rubbish and so do you. Mum moved out of the city after... I think Harry still sends her Christmas cards."
He catches a glimpse of John's face out of the corner of his eye and groans in abject despair. Oh, not
Sherlock gulped again.
He is a fraud, and how better to show that than by walking right into his next
As Mycroft so often enjoys to remind him, he can't keep relying on big brother to come along and clean up his messes.
Instead, Sherlock watches as John simply sits down beside him, wordless and, for some reason,
he's doing it!
"So you do pay attention to politics. Fantastic. Perhaps there's hope for you joining MI6 yet."
he whispers. It comes out as nothing more than a faint breath of air, landing gently on John's sweaty, still back. The words settle comfortably in his throat, not sticking like glue to keep him silent but instead flowing as they are meant to do. He chooses another.
All those people around them right now could sit here on dates, and be bloody
John looks tired again. Tired the way he had in the last weeks leading up to the wedding, and the morning he found him in a drug den. He looks tired again just thinking about it.
What does he think he's going to do?
"I..." John leaned closer and pressed his face against Sherlock's shoulder, his arm around his back and his hand slipped under his shirt, fingers tracing over scars and clean skin without regard for the difference. "I will. But not tonight."
Sherlock is determined that he is not going to have to cancel all that many appointments.
Sherlock, feeling unwell ever since they'd gone to Cambridge. Feeling--
What else is he supposed to do to fix this?
Francis is not a fraud.
He just can not truly, in his heart of hearts, believe that Sherlock is happy.
Sherlock
He supposed there was no point in nagging Sherlock to wear a tie. Sherlock didn't wear ties... he wasn't entirely convinced the man even owned one, beyond what he'd worn to John's wedding. John wasn't sure Sherlock could even tie one himself, and to tie it for him was really just one step further than he wanted to go tonight.
"But?"
"Nope!" John proclaims, all smiles, and settles himself down on the edge of the new bed. It's marginally better than the old one. It's also still a travesty. "Mycroft's security also isn't going home until you do, so. Get used to them. And speaking of Mycroft." He fumbles in his jacket, which had been suspiciously bulky the entire evening, and at last holds out his hand with his offering in tow. "Mycroft asked me to give this to you. I think he hopes if he keeps you occupied, you won't make a run for it. Again."
He stares back at him, a silent, unspoken threat. There's a baseball bat propped against the wall, an autographed gift from a client. John will fucking use it. "I'm not going to ask again."
"What a way to make your most brilliant mind feel wanted."
he snapped, snatching Mycroft's latest find out of his hands. "Sherlock is clean! And who he chooses to have a relationship with is none of your business!"
I was only gone a few hours! What, did you break into the bloody zoo? I've never even seen something like that before!"
He smacks himself again, panting as if he's run miles, as if he's still running. His face contorts and suddenly he looks absolutely furious. Oh, god.
John swallows the words in his own mouth, and kisses him hard, right there in the middle of their kitchen.
There was another low, unhappy sigh. Not at all one of acceptance, and instead one of exhaustion.
"...Okay," he said finally, clearing his throat. "If you're sure."
There's another long silence, and Sherlock soaks it all in.
"You're feeling better, then?" he finally started, facing Sherlock again. "Everything still going as it should?"
It was for the best if he was. Wasn't it?
He just wanted this chapter to be over.
All feedback is welcome and appreciated!!! Thank you so much for reading, and stay healthy! <3
This is going well.
With a roll of his eyes, Greg settled back against the wall, playing with where the Belstaff hung just next to him, waiting on a hook. "It's fine," he said, to John, not to Sherlock. "It's just a scene I could use a second pair of eyes at; it'll be safe. But it's a bit of a high-profile case, and we think there was poison involved, too--"
"Sherlock, if you don't start answering me, I'll have to-"
to him. "It matters quite a lot, Scott," he begins, the words very carefully selected and neutral. "The inciting incident is important in figuring out the best way forward for you."
with him, not really, John was just being excruciatingly careful, but if Sherlock could only tempt him enough...
Sherlock lurches to his feet, and barely makes it across the room in time to throw up into the sink.
Thank you so much for all the comments/kudos!!! I think I got to everyone, but if I missed someone, I sincerely apologize <3

"My dad was a drunk."
Is this to be our new pattern, then? Because we really don't seem to be very good at this."
"Look," John said. And he did so himself-- he looked at Sherlock, and held his gaze, and didn't let himself look away. "It was a stupid thing to say. Of course you don't need a bloody girlfriend to be happy. I only meant that, if you... if you actually
He's tired of the fact that he can compose all night long, but his brain still short-circuits and his fingers freeze solid the moment he tries to pick up his violin.
Her voice dwindles, and the fiddling with the blanket stops.

A moment later, the door swung shut downstairs, and Sherlock started to glow like a lightbulb just switched on.
This wasn't going to devolve into

"That's my point exactly, Sherlock," he said softly, the words just a little bit thick. "I'm not saying I don't want this to happen, because I
It'd be so easy to let himself have this.
and the care is warm and addicting, so he lets him do it.
"John," he repeated. He cleared his throat, halfway sobered up by the alarm alone. "I have... you were not meant--"
Because there is an infinite spectrum of the things that he loves the most about John Watson. But there is absolutely nothing comparable to the swell of pure glee that blossoms right in his stomach as he watches John swivel back around, pull himself up to his full height in defense of Sherlock's very non-existent honor, and throw the first punch.
and if he'd had it in hand he might've thrown it. "No, Sherlock, don't just-- this can't work like that! You were at your worst and you hurt yourself with it, and that's... not okay, but... I was at my worst and I hurt
He breathes with John.
There is nothing.
"No," Lestrade says slowly. "Just making an observation."
Yes. -SH
Even if they have nothing else, they still have this.
Mycroft sighs grittily. By the sound of it, he'd exited a meeting of paramount importance, when John's number had flashed across his screen.
"...Nothing's wrong?"
of throwing the strop to end all strops.
The headline was about the latest rugby game. Well, that was a no go. He wasn't entirely sure Sherlock could even name one of the country's top rugby teams. The next page was on the ongoing prime minister election, which was another no. If there was anything Sherlock had less interest in than sports, it was politics.
It took a moment longer still, but then Sherlock breathed in, and with it, a flicker of light filled back into his eyes. Once again, John's touch on his arm was all that it took to breathe life back into him, and once again, it came as simply and easily as a flicker of light in his eyes. He blinked once, gaze flickering up and down John and then away again, lightning quick, and the line of his mouth flattened.
Mycroft sits back with a heavy sigh, interlacing his fingers over his stomach. He does, at least, put that damn phone away. But he still doesn't, or can't, look John in the eye. "Sherlock," he starts, then shakes his head, and starts again. He frowns deeply, his gaze turning off down the corridor, all the way to his little brother's room. "As I have previously explained to you, it's extremely inconvenient to have you present on missions involving my brother. Invariably, that means bullets will be spent that I have to explain, because you are not a government agent. And then, the last thing that will help Sherlock is you, being written up or arrested for--"
He wants to find every single person responsible in any way for the devastated body spread out before him, his genius brain turned off by sedatives and his amazing eyes heavy in a morphine-supported sleep, and he wants to tear. them.
As I've said, much of the fic is already written, so updates should come pretty quickly. I will be back soon! (And I posted this chapter at 3:30 AM while sick, so now I've gone back through and fixed up a lot of typos! Sorry about that ;-;)
"I love you," he said.
Mrs. Hudson, crying on John's shoulder, murmuring about finding Sherlock asleep on the floor in his own vomit; Sherlock, still barely more than skin and bones, moving stiffly, sorely, sleeping more, because he was a bloody human being and he could only put his body through the wringer so many times before it started to give up on him.
Sitting there, right in his chair, sipping morning tea. He was looking at Sherlock, at least, his face a cross between tolerant amusement and fondness, but that was all he was doing. Sitting there calmly, looking at Sherlock. He wasn't making any move to get up at all- he wasn't even moving to finish off his tea.
Happy endings did not have one man taking out the stitches he'd beaten into the other's face.
Like he was
Sherlock would be smug, if the world wasn't caving in.
It's not at all a perfect blog-post-worthy ending. Sherlock's shirt is alternatively wrinkled and sticky, plastered to his skin, and they both look dreadful with bedhead and sleep clinging to John's eyes at seven thirty in the morning. He keeps stumbling over his own words and John landed half on the floor when he tackled him down and is still there, and it is his first words
reading in there, reading to the tune of Sherlock's electronic heartbeats in his ears. He is a doctor, and a bloody good one at that. He knows how close Sherlock cut it. How close any number of the things they did to him could've done it. He knows exactly how close this came to being it. To being
Sour anger surges in his gut, and he suddenly regrets coming down here with Mycroft after all.
He remained quiet at first, still looking anywhere but at John. Another moment passed and he wound his fingers together very tightly, as if to keep them still. "If you'll forgive me for possibly overstepping again. But... you did not seem to be very happy with Mary. Even before the shooting."
He spoke briefly and quietly to Victor, too quietly for Sherlock to overhear. But by the look on his face, it was a reprimand of some kind. Victor was taller than him, taller than Sherlock, but seemed to shrink underneath the lecture, the previous irritation on his face doused into a blank slate as his eyes just dropped to the floor. Whatever there'd been of his confidence before, it was completely gone now. "Yes, sir," he said softly, "yes," and Sherlock grinned.
Sherlock had relapsed because he'd wanted to use. It had nothing to do with the damn
Sherlock huffed under his breath, silent as he watched Lestrade leave. Taking John for granted? Ridiculous. This had been the entire point of the Milgram experiment, after all... which, admittedly, was not working out as well as he had hoped. Not if John could so easily abandon him for five days straight, for what truly sounded like the most
For a moment, just a moment, Greg forgot himself again. He started to sit forward, just wanting to grab the dripping icepack before it slid onto his sofa.
Victor was dead. He'd tried with Victor, and Victor was dead. And he could blame Oscar if he said so, but at the heart of it was, Oscar hadn't injected the heroin. Oscar hadn't even seen him for years. Sherlock was the one who'd been there. He'd lived with him. And Victor had still killed himself.
Mary had bloody shot his best friend, and it had taken him until he'd watched that goddamn video and heard her send Sherlock to hell to finally realise that he'd never actually forgiven her for it.
Well-
"You..."
"That's what I just said about people not liking you, Sherlock."
He huffs through gritted teeth, a growl building in his throat. Almost,
He sent John another look, grinning and sure of himself enough to burst, and with so much endless, unquestioning
John has only been left waiting for a little over two hours when he hears the physician stop outside his room to wash off his hands. He immediately starts to sit up, still holding a hand to his head and swallowing nausea back behind clenched teeth, and has just made it all the way up when his attending enters the room.
That, in typical Sherlockian speak, was true. He'd asked Sherlock if he'd had sex, and he'd asked Sherlock if he'd had a relationship. Well, Sherlock had actually just volunteered the information, but the point was that he'd never actually outright asked
John blinks. "Um," he says, very intelligently. "That's... nice." Does this have a point? He fidgets, swallowing hard, and is barely able to keep still-- he just wants to get upstairs and back to Sherlock.
Sherlock lowered his hands. He looked no more put together than before, quite frankly, but Greg wasn't sure even Sherlock could manage to look put together, with his hair a muddy bird's nest and his clothes the sodding wreck that they were. "As it--" he started, then cleared his throat, working something questionable and shuddering out of his voice. "As it so happens, actually. That's why I'm here."
This is not going to go well. It's just not. And John doesn't have any idea what to do, because he hasn't had any idea what to do this entire time.
John, I know that I want this, I know that you want this. We both want it, why are you telling me no still; why is every other piece in place but you insist that we can't?"
One evening after the transfer, upon which John truly has moved into Sherlock's room for all intents and purposes and that is where he intends to stay, John takes a walk around the hospital. A sorely needed walk to stretch muscles that feel like they're about to cramp and die if he spends one more night just

Sherlock manages something barely approaching a smile of his own. It feels like a nail has been driven into his chest, that Sherlock is himself the one that hammered it in, and John is now gently wedging it out.
with Sherlock, but Mycroft will always read him better than John could ever dream of.
He holds his breath, and waits.
He had never meant to bait Oscar into insulting him, or talking about Victor. He certainly hadn't wanted it to end with his brain contracted around a needle point of white-hot fury, but here he was, shivering just outside the men's toilets, nauseated and furious and John's name in his hands the only lifeline he had.

But he wavered, at the very bottom of the stairs.
"Ella thinks," he said, "that it was abusive."
"Nope," Sherlock returns, popping the p.
"I am very, very much in love with you. Yes,
But Donovan is not looking at Lestrade.
The words are low, and croaky, and unfamiliar. They don't sound like his voice. He feels them in his sore throat and how they taste in his mouth, and they're unfamiliar there, too. It feels like the first few weeks of learning a foreign language, when the sounds and syllables are still uncomfortable as he fights his tongue to make it learn the proper ways to move and speak. It's only his name, and there's nothing familiar about it at all.
in his brain and rediscover his voice.
He coughed and shifted, staring hard at the road. "It's nothing. I'm sure." He offered John a very strained smile, his fingers tapped hard once along the steering wheel. The same sort of strained smile it felt like he'd been getting all fucking day long. "It's--"
with Sherlock Holmes.
"What?"
John takes in a breath, and carefully, very carefully, wraps his arm around Sherlock without asking him anything more.
"People," Sherlock said, then swallowed. "Sorry. Men, specifically."
"Let's fix this, first, hmm?" John carefully wrenches it upright, watching how Sherlock's eyes follow it. He clearly doesn't like the needle, but he's in no position to yank it out. Desperately small mercies. "Just antibiotics, Sherlock. You've had a fever for days. You can probably tell, can't you? I'm sure you can feel it. It's partly why you feel so confused, right now. You need to lie down."
Mycroft watches him in silence for what feels like too long. The anger has faded, tempered by what Sherlock has said, and for a moment he even looks immeasurably sad.
"--someone he's had feelings for in the past, and someone I thought wasn't in the picture anymore, but apparently she is. And it came out of nowhere, and I just got angry at him again. I got angry at him for getting a text from a woman." He shook his head, again unable to look at her. Putting it in words like this he heard exactly how horrible it sounded aloud, how absolutely
When Sherlock does not repeat his order for her to go away, his hands instead fumbling through something else with even less confidence than before, Donovan enters fully into the room. She does still look a bit impatient, but drops to her knees in front of him, taking his hands in her own. "Like this," she explains, "hold your fingers straight. No,
Because the difference is that Sherlock loves John, and John- well, John is supposed to love Mary. Was supposed to.
and he was still talking? Why was he still talking?, "he's still mad about that case last week, where you texted him out to a crime scene while he was at work? You said it was an emergency, and you wanted him to loan you his pen? Because ours weren't
Okay. He just had to start. It would be easier once he finally got the words out.
It was low and croaked and pathetic. It was barely more than a leaky whisper, barely audible even to himself. His throat feels strange and he's short of breath and he's not even making any sound now, he's breathing hard and he
Yes. He does. That is precisely the issue.
This is it, then.
It's downright unsettling.
"The Williams case?" he asks at first, perhaps only two paragraphs into it. He glances at Sherlock, bemused. "That's what this is all about? He pled guilty forever ago. I think Lestrade said something about him starting to sing a whole different tune when he realised Daddy wasn't coming to bail him out."
and steeled himself to go on.
Sherlock doesn't have any idea why his
Once again, the poor receptionist looks more than a little frightened. Once again, John can not blame her.
"I wanted to talk to you about something, actually."
Sherlock rolled his eyes, barely even listening. "You wouldn't be asking me if you didn't
But it's only Greg that comes around the corner, tense and worried and looking at Sherlock in outright concern. Sherlock, in answer, looks as if he wants to vomit.
Sherlock rolls his brilliant, sea-green eyes. And he fights it, but there's a smile there, now. There's just the faintest twitch of a smile, and his answer is to suck on the pen even harder, like a belligerent child sticking out their tongue.
John took a deep, deep breath, squeezing his eyes shut. He held Rosie closer and listened to her babble and counted to ten. Like Ella had said.
It is
It wasn't a nightmare. It wasn't a night terror. He wakes, and his heart isn't even elevated- he hears it in the blasted monitor, still pealing away just above his left ear.
Wasn't it? Ella would probably say it was a good thing. Sherlock spreading out a little bit, making other connections, having someone to rely on besides John. It was a good thing, yes? And Sherlock awkwardly bringing it up like this, testing the waters, as if... he was trying to get his approval?
. You.. you would've-"
"..."
They were on the hunt for case files that had accumulated over the past ten or so years, unsolved (or wrongly solved) homicides that were now looking to be a serial killer. An anomaly in a recent case's bloodwork had stood out to John that morning, and twelve hours later, they were still knee-deep down the rabbithole.
John was starting to get angry himself, now, provoked by the obvious hostility. Mycroft hadn't been this angry at him when he'd
They are in intensive care. In ICU, there are urgencies that come in front of patient privacy, so Sherlock is naked, dressed only in a sheet and medical equipment. He has so much stuck to him he is more identifiable as a practice dummy than a human being, and for a moment it's almost easier to think of it all just like that. This is not Sherlock at all. The black and blue patterns on his stomach, old bruises underneath new that splatter around the chest tube, visibly draining blood from inside him. The lump under the sheet that is a brace for his right knee. The temporary splint on his left arm, supported on a pillow and immobilising the badly broken limb inside plastic and velcro straps. There's another surgery tentatively scheduled in a few days, for when he's stronger; the insertion of stabilising plates and screws, to hold the bones in place as he heals. They'll have to see how it looks at the end, to know if they'll take the metal back out or not.
Sherlock reads over the paragraphs again, dust and grit collecting in his throat. They are disgustingly sentimental, and already something that he knows he would never be able to say aloud to a therapist. He likely wouldn't be able to even say them aloud to John.
he could apologise until he was blue in the face and it would never be enough.
"...An ulcer," he repeated flatly. John worked his jaw, trying very hard to keep himself sounding remotely calm. "At... eighteen."
Sherlock huddles on his side, little more than a loose ball of long limbs and messy hair. His back is to John, so he can't see his face, but he hears the sharp, desperate gasps for breath, the sick panting, and the pieces click.
Then he re-caps the pen with his teeth, slaps his notebook shut, and folds around, to curl with his head in John's lap instead of his legs.

He was going to
If Sherlock had wanted to allow any of those questions, he already would've written their answers down.
Sherlock was pale and red-eyed, yesterday's clothes wrinkled all to ruin with his hair a bird's nest and his skin with the slightest lingering scent of whiskey. John, across from him, was tired, and had barely slept two hours, after one of the worst nights of his life. He was also pretty sure he knew what Sherlock wanted to ask for.
He shouldn't have woken up alone. Not like this. Not now.
and there's nothing John can do to fix it.
John flexed his hand again in his lap, trying to force those gleeful thoughts out of mind. He really wasn't supposed to be enjoying thinking about breaking anyone's nose, or making excuses to do it.
"You were fifteen."
"I..."
"Sherlock's been here for hours," he says flatly. "Hasn't he."
Two hours. Still, his mobile remained stubbornly silent.
much of anything like that to begin with-- not sentimental, human details like this. John wouldn't have believed it, a long time ago, but now he can see that it makes sense. A great, big, affectionate, over-eager dog, begging to be pet and played with? It's an excuse to be human. It's an excuse to be affectionate back and get attention and licked on the face and no one can judge him for it, because it's a
"But I have in the past, Sherlock-- and I don't even mean just intentionally! You voluntarily got up and went on a bloody date with him, you didn't to so badly you almost got sick, but you did it anyway, all because you wanted to make me happy. You didn't want to tell me no. This after you just as good as told me you never wanted to have sex with him at all, but you never could properly tell him no, either!" The very idea of that happening with Sherlock, of thinking it was something that Sherlock wanted to do, that he was making Sherlock feel good, only to find out later he hadn't wanted any of it, that he'd only done it because John had wanted him to...
John packs up what remains in the hospital room in silence, throwing toothbrushes and a razor into his bag on top of changes of clothes, his shirts on top of Sherlock's pajamas, his comb on top of Sherlock's posh shampoo. Sherlock's only been able to take a proper shower very recently, but he can tell the familiar texture and smell had been a relief to him, even if he hadn't been able to say so. He triple-checks the prescriptions and schedule for follow-up appointments. He quadruple-checks the charts and instructions for physical therapy with a grim reluctance, already dreading the absolute battle he knows that they're going to be.
this caring
Because Sherlock shouldn't be okay with this.
"Molly's watching her. Sit down, I'll get the tea." John moved past him, acutely glad for the excuse to occupy himself, be useful, and most importantly look anywhere but at Sherlock. He replayed their last exchange in his head, this time focusing on the look on Sherlock's face, and instantly set about fixing it. "I can bring Rosie over in a few days. Just-- when you're a little healthier. I know you're doing much better, but I can't keep an eye on her and you at the same time. If that's..." Or was he overstepping? Really, since when would Sherlock Holmes want to entertain a baby at his flat? "If you'd be okay with it, of course--"
a show-off, after all. It's what we do."
Well, John determines, he's just going to have to deal with it.
I watched my... my
"There we go," he said, and smiled again. "What would you think about teaching that class for me, next term? Sebastian's?"
Sherlock stares at him still with those wild, stricken eyes, angry underneath the messy fall of his hair. He bares his teeth when John inches a step closer and jerks backwards, attempting to lash out but managing nothing more than dislodging his own precarious ball. He looks like a cornered, wild animal, injured and caught in a trap and reduced to nothing more than fight or flight.
He waited a minute more, hoping inquiring minds would investigate without requiring him to broach the subject. John, however, spent his time doing precisely nothing but sitting there in his chair, blinking up at the ceiling, and looking like he wanted to go to sleep.
So of course he has seen this.
But John was already smirking when Sherlock looked to him, still tired but now particularly pleased with himself, even as he worked himself up out of the chair to peer curiously at Milgram. "You ran off last night before anyone could get a proper look at you. Don't look like that, I saw you wrestling with that bloody assassin, you were strangled, Sherlock! That can cause internal damage; you
And it was why Sherlock was so scared of it now.
It slowly occurs to John, sitting there together on the floor, with Sherlock too thin and too cold and just
The reply had come in not even two minutes.
Sherlock looks as home as he ever has. If John hadn't known any better, if he were just passing through, then he would've assumed that the beanpole in the coat was a deaf, especially stylish constable. And that's-- well, he feels
He'd do this right.
John very much wants to get Sherlock home right now.
It's so easy.
"Yeah? And maybe that's why people don't like you. Come on, budge over a bit." He nudged Sherlock just a little further down, so he could hitch a leg onto the table and settle an arm around Sherlock's shoulders. "Sebastian... Sebastian Wilkes? At the chemistry building?"
Sherlock flinches.
The dealer that he goes to see lives in an upper scale suburb, where he services London's upper class. Sherlock has never frequented these sorts of circles-- the CCTV networks are impossible to avoid here, and in his more heavily recreational days, he''d stood out like a sore thumb. But he's only going just the once, this time. Just one supply is all he needs, and he needs it as high quality as possible.
John gave an affirmative sort of grunt, head tilted back to his chair. He made no further attempt to speak at all.
There is no answer, and concern spikes in his stomach. There were no tests or procedures scheduled for tonight, Sherlock's condition is stable, and even on the off chance that something

and refocuses on Sherlock. "It remains only a tentative identification, at the present moment. Brother mine, if you would be so kind?"
Sherlock! You must hate me, I-- c-can't believe--
You begged me to sleep with you and

It doesn't matter. This is non-negotiable. Because Sherlock has tried to compromise, that is what
and with that, the day was wrapped up.
Something flickered across his face, very quickly, gone so fast John couldn't tell what it was. He dropped his chin back against his fist, staring down at a beaker of something dark and murky before him. "My intention was never to interrupt your wedding."
Sherlock staggers once, around his shoulder. He reels in place, his kneels buckling, and the look on his ashen face says very clearly that he knows it. He almost look as if he's about to start crying.
"And I'll stay here, and an hour into it, I'll call you, and tell you Lestrade's got a case for us. So if it's not going well, if you still feel sick-- even if you're just not having fun. Then you'll have an excuse to leave. You can ditch him, come back to Baker Street, and watch bad telly with me, or whatever else you want to do." He squeezed Sherlock's shoulders again, trying to get a closer look at his face, but he remained unreadable, even to John. "Okay?"
He might have treated Sherlock horribly in the past. Unforgivably, in ways he could never make up for. But one thing that John knew was that he'd
"And if Sherlock had died?" he snaps, very, very quietly. He stares at the ugly, chipped tile under his hands, because if he looks at Mycroft right now, there's a very good chance this will end in a fist fight. That would not be a very long or difficult fight. "How do you think that conversation would've gone? When I found out that not only was Sherlock dead, but
Francis pauses, watching him with careful, quiet eyes. His own encouraging smile starts to dim. "Something about this frustrates you."
"You're not talking about Sherlock," he said numbly. "You're talking about me."
"Um." John laughed faintly, a cross between startled and utterly lost. "What?"
"All right, all right--" John raised his hands in the universal gesture for peace. Sherlock clearly was not in the mood for teasing. "I'm sorry, I'm not laughing at you, Sherlock. It's just a little surreal, you know? You're a bloody genius and you fight serial killers for fun, but you still get nervous over a first date, just like everybody else."
people do and I am not normal does not mean I am immune to it. A premise I didn't think I would have to explain to you, given that you are both a doctor and someone who has repeatably tried to impress upon me that I am not a machine, but, well, here we are. I am just as human as you and just as unable to stamp out the urges of the transport as anyone else."
He's tired. That much is obvious. He's tired, and his shoulder hurts after a day of lugging boxes, and he doesn't know what to say or how to look at Sherlock.
don't you
"The... the article?"
"You'd better hope that neither one of us ever sees you again," John snapped.

John looks at him, where he sits in his chair. The very picture of who used to be Sherlock Holmes, sorting his way through books and files and articles that only he can see, his staring eyes glinting with excitement as the pieces of a glorious puzzle click together in a way only he can work.
They'd fix this. They'd get Sherlock clean and then John would make sure Sherlock
John's face twitches, a little, some of that light going dim, and Sherlock waves it off without the slightest bit of patience for it. "Baker Street, I mean. You moved back in, and now your bed is currently collecting dust."
"You did good today," he murmurs finally. "You did good. And you'll do better tomorrow."
and he keeps waving it as John faces back to Mycroft.
The politician gives Sherlock another look, even as he slips two files out from under his arm with a faint
It's not worth much at all.
"That, I don't know." Mycroft stood up himself, his own cup abandoned as he gave his tie a sharp tug. He was still pale and looked a cross between sick and absolutely furious. "Sherlock's obfuscation with you, about their relationship, was surely intentional. I'm not sure how much he understands that he was taken advantage of, but he does understand, at least, that most people would describe what happened as abuse. But I know that he would never describe what he had with this man as happy, or healthy, or normal. He certainly never wanted to see him again, and I don't know why he would agree to meet with him now."
be the reason that he fails. So he pants and clutches his chest and probably takes ten years off of Lestrade's life, but he lets the man hold his shoulders and talk him through breathing, and slowing down, and not passing out, and it's humiliating and disgusting but he's too worn out to care.
The door swung open, and John took as deep a breath as he could.
It's a very simple case of cause-and-effect: his life is what it is because of John, and if he loses John--
John holds his breath.
John clenched his fists together again, forcing in a deep, calming breath, and looked back at Ella.
He rolls his eyes. "Only marginally more useful than the flowers your office sent. Who the hell thought I'd have a use for
in John it was just nearly too much.

But he couldn't say that, of course, he couldn't say any of that. So all he did was sit even further upright, tugging the wrinkles in his dressing gown straight and straightening all the way up. "If they speak for themselves," he muttered, pushing his wild hair back down into something just approaching tamable, "I think they might need to retain a translator as well."
John knew. He'd told John so, in making good on his promise to continue at least trying to talk to him about it. He'd just... never thought... never
He does.
The line is hard to find, because while Sherlock isn't shy about drawing it, he can't
John blinked.
In something of a daze and fog, his movements guided through a trance, with an extremely worried Molly walking with them to the taxi and John holding his hand in the backseat like he's a child. He's handed a hot cup of tea with too much sugar, because that's the way John makes it when he's worried; he always overestimates how much sugar Sherlock wants. He's not made to eat anything. They shower, which means Sherlock sits there under the hot spray while John cards through the sweaty, sticky mess with stiff fingers and a look on his face that is too much to take. (He doesn't remember where his clothes went. He doesn't remember John even taking them off.)
He wipes his eyes, squares his shoulders, and marches back out onto the battlefield.
Just one word, that's all John is asking him for. Just
"It's just--" he rushed to justify, "I know you hate how it feels, and it might be a week or two more until your hands stay steady enough. ...it's only if you--"
It's nonsense, is what it is.

Though I'll require additional samples from Molly... and

Everyone will always want to know why you insist on wasting your time with such an obnoxious, dreadful person, and you will lose your patience with why I can
He looks at himself in the mirror.
He-- he
But Sherlock is not getting better. This is not
John sat back in his seat, and rubbed hopelessly at the growing knot of worry, settled right there in the center of his chest.
Sherlock swallowed a bite that tasted like cardboard, and wrangled another strained smile. It felt like he was fishing the words from molasses. "No. I have the funds and facilities to research without anyone's support, and my interests wouldn't be very well supported by a university's lab." Which meant his kitchen, and his trust fund. Oscar didn't need to know that. Oscar also didn't need to know that the majority of his experiments included some variety of mould or amputated limb.
it's like he's chained down with anchors whenever he tries to hurtle upwards on a case but he does it anyway. He hates it and he does it anyway.
Mycroft snapped, "have been out of the country, and only returned when my staff alerted me to the crisis in its making." He slammed one book down upon finding that it did not contain hollowed out pages and a vial and went straight onto the next. "I was sure it'd be safe to leave my brother's welfare to you for just a few days, but apparently this was an incorrect assumption to make. You have my apologies-- I won't make such a foolish mistake again."
he thinks, burying his hands into the thick, golden fur. He just looks so
He can not keep
"I like how four syllable words sound in your voice," John laughs, curling his hands into his hair. He lies still for a second, stroking his hair, forehead to his chest, holding him close. "I
Sherlock put the towel and his tea aside, suddenly, folding himself up into an even smaller, safer ball. He tucked his chin onto his knees and locked his arms around them, wrapped up to look wounded and guarded and small. "I know Lestrade wouldn't," he said. He barely moved his mouth, chin still smushed against his knees, and his voice came out muffled. "I thought he was like Oscar. When we first met, a year after I dropped out. I thought he was the same. He said I was brilliant and that he wanted to help me, and he told me to call him Greg. Oscar said the same. He wouldn't let me call him Dr. Wilson-- I had to call him Oscar."
(Tedious. Deleted.)
John pulled back fully and let him go- an incredible, absolute
"Actually," he went on quietly, when it had been quiet for almost a minute. "I was asking because Sebastian Wilkes is one of my students. Inorganic chem. It's a big class, so I've never really gotten to know him, but between you and me? I don't think he's my favorite student."
things, didn't have the slightest idea what he was missing.
Finally,
What's he supposed to do? Drag him off to a cab? Yeah, sure, that'll end well. Get Lestrade to throw them out? Yeah. Sure. That'll end
John nodded back without protest, unease in his throat, and followed Sherlock without another word.
He sighed.
"Sherlock," he started, a few sips of tea into it. When he thought he just might've calmed down, just a little bit. "I don't hate you. You frustrate me, and you're an obnoxious bastard, and... yeah, I guess I do hate what you do. I hate watching you waste who you could be and you scare the hell out of me, because I'm pretty sure you're going to kill yourself one day. But I don't hate you."
Sherlock sniffs desperately into his hands, all limbs and misery on the floor. His breaths still race, so shallow and stricken they're not getting in any air at all.
Where is Sherlock?
He shouldn't have just punched him. He should've done so much more. He should've kicked him, should've fucking
John let out a very long, very fond sigh. "It's only for a few hours," he said again, crouching closer. He gently turned Sherlock's head this way and that, getting a good look at his eyes and the glorious swelling on his own forehead. Sherlock was pretty sure a quarter of his hair was matted together in one blood-crusted clump. "Assuming everything looks good, we'll get everything wrapped up, and then you can come home and whine all that you like from bed, love. I'll even make you tea."
This is not one of John's blog posts.
"Well, it's fine," John muttered darkly. "Because I'm not going to mess it up again."
Oh, lovely, clever John. Sherlock smirked to himself. What happened to him wanting to go to the conference, then?
in your life, you are being--
"Sherlock?"
"If my earlier answers displease you so," Mycroft murmurs. There's the clink of china as he just makes himself at home, in what he so often affectionately describes as his dump of a flat. Sherlock thinks that if he hates it so much, he knows where the door is. "Then take all of this as my version of an apology, instead. Whatever makes you happiest."
It even made sense about Oscar, too. Sherlock clearly had not been a popular student, far from it-- he'd heard how Sebastian Wilkes had talked about him as a peer, and now he'd heard how his teachers talked abut him as a student. Sherlock had been hated while he was in school. If Oscar had been kind to him, if Oscar had liked him, then it really seemed like he'd been the only one to do it. Of course Sherlock would've been close to the only person who'd not hated him.
Sherlock stands up in a somewhat sad impersonation of his usual bounce to his feet, one leg staggering and his face in a tight grimace. John would be a tad more sympathetic, if they weren't here
"...been good seeing you, Sherlock," he was saying, just as John made it within earshot. "Consider it? I'd love to catch up."
He keels over in the kitchen, his knees trembling underneath him as one hand grasps at his chest, as if trying to claw out a deep pain there. Sherlock knows the feeling very well. He gulps in air, increasingly loud and horrified, Sherlock's pointed scrawl as sharp and dangerous as a knife to the stomach. Perhaps this is what Sherlock looked like yesterday, on the floor of the morgue.
Sherlock sat, again, very, very still. His little finger was the only part of him that moved at all, incessant strokes along the mug, up and down, and his wary expression faded to unreadable.
"...Have you told John, yet? About what you're trying to do?"
(See the end of the chapter for

and John doesn't even know why. Why the hell did Lestrade think he was ready for a case... and why the hell does Sherlock want to go?
John sighed, trying to dislodge Sherlock's heel from where it was now digging into his thigh. His hand somehow ended up hooked around his ankle, purely for the relief of the contact. "That's not what I meant, anyway. My point is that she never... physically hurt me or Rosie in any way. But you were right a few days ago, Sherlock. I wasn't happy in that marriage. If you really want me to be honest about it, I was miserable not even a month after the bloody wedding, and finding out my wife had been lying to me since the day we'd met really didn't help."
"There he is. Come on. Back to me, Sherlock."
"I need to go pick up Rosie. I can't sleep over tonight, Sherlock. But soon. Okay?"
to do that to this amazing, fantastic,
So maybe it was John's turn to share a little again.
He smiles.
"I was twelve."
He can't even begrudge him for it. Much. He wants John to be happy, and that- the person he's woken up to in this room, time and time again- he has not been happy. He is tired and grey eyed, living out of a duffel bag with tea in plastic cups and he holds his shoulder when he thinks nobody can see. He tosses and turns at night and when he looks at Sherlock it's as if the sight alone makes him want to vomit.
John takes him home.
But Sherlock, far from being softened by the concern, just ground his teeth even harder, the muscles in his neck standing out in sudden stark accord. "Well, I don't. It's a second-rate university, the administration is flimsier than wet paper, and I have no interest in assisting at a case on their campus."
"Turned up on your doorstep?" He laughs, and the sound is so warm and infectious and heavy Sherlock wants to wrap his arms around it and bury it right in the hole left by the bullet. "You mean you took one look at me and decided I was going to be your new flatmate, no matter what I thought about it! Didn't even wait twelve hours before kidnapping me to a crime scene."
"So you have no answer," Mycroft says, when Sherlock, indeed, has nothing to say. He settles back into John's chair to frown at him, still staring at him like he is an especially foolish and stupid child. "No scientific studies that I am aware of show permanent neurological changes from cocaine use... at least, not of the kind that you are after. Even if your stimulants accomplish what you hope, you will have achieved nothing at all beyond a host of problems as the fallout."
"You do?" Greg checked the paper again, scanning down the page. "You know Dr. Wilson?"
Which was reason enough for him to keep his hands still, and not allow himself to so much as entertain the idea of getting one.
"Right," said John. "I'll be sure to." A beat of silence, something very close to jealousy screaming in his ears. "Would you mind telling me a bit about him, actually? Not related to the case-- my clinic's looking to partner in a research project, and he's on the short list. I haven't been made to find out much about him and was looking forward to the opportunity."
he wants to reset time, he can't. Even if he moves into Baker Street and they never see Mary again that John is not ever coming back.
That night, John still goes back home to retrieve his gun.
John doesn't have to be fluent, to understand what Sherlock says back.
"Right."
The rest of John's day after that is very little short of embarrassing.
Mycroft gave him another pointed look, one eyebrow raised. "You know what they say about assumptions, John."
Sherlock's head jerked up, and his X-ray gaze swiveled sideways to stare through John.
Sherlock sits beside him, his eyes narrowed and his face still blank. He looks at Mycroft rather than the files, and whatever is going on in his giant brain, not a hint of it shows on his face.
The penny dropped. The other shoe fell.
He drained half his glass in a single gulp, and it made his throat burn so viciously he nearly gagged it straight back up.
John didn't much care, what happened next. He just wanted this story to be over.
"...yes, actually. Of course." She clears her throat, and he can hear her hesitate, because she sees the look on his face and hears him being
He didn't feel remotely special at all.
of being the reason John looks like he could barely get out of bed, and he can not let
The cold ice chips help rouse him a little more as John continues. He doubts it matters all that much what exactly he's saying and instead focuses on keeping his voice calm and soothing. Even if Sherlock can't understand what he's saying, and he probably can't, he will at least hear and understand the tone of his voice, and know that there's nothing to be afraid of. And as he goes on, the words and the ice chips and thumb stroking his jaw, they finally earn some tiny shifts and increased awareness in his eyes. They lock closer onto John, widening in wet and shiny bright blue. His mouth moves again, this time spelling out his name.
He hates this.
But Oscar remained undeterred. Still with that vile, plastic
Sherlock wasn't surprised. He'd already deduced exactly what this meeting really was all about, all the way back when he'd first handed him his business card. It wasn't a date. It hadn't even been intended as one at all.
at John. The way he's looking at John right now, his inquisitive eyes narrowing and a shroud fallen across his white face. The urgent terror from before has faded, as has the fury at not being understood, and the rage at whatever mouth-breathing idiot had hit John on the head. He stares at John instead, with eyes that are too intelligent to escape from, and a gaze that sees too much to ever hide from.
Sherlock snapped his mouth shut, his teeth ground together and his heart in his throat. His fingers kneaded into the old, hideous afghan- a present from Mrs. Hudson- and for god's sake, this wasn't okay. This wasn't okay at all.
Greg blinked. "That's what this is about? No. No idea, actually." He frowned again, transferring his gaze back to the road. "I know he studied at Cambridge, a long time ago, but it's not as if he ever talks about it. I don't think he had a great time there, but... come on. It's Sherlock. It's pretty easy to guess he wasn't the most popular kid in school." He tried for another grin, but John wasn't exactly in a joking mood, and it faded back into barely concealed concern as the light changed to green. "Is something going on?"
Sherlock smirks faintly. He does not move his hands this time, and he doesn't have to. They can all hear what he means, clear as day.
And like he'd told Lestrade, he didn't have it in him to do this right now. All he wanted to do was go to sleep.
But this was different. This was personal, and he'd press it as many times as he had to to drive it home. "Why is it impossible to imagine him doing that? Hmm?"
His face and neck feel so freakishly hot that for a moment he wants to tear his scarf off and throw it down on the floor.
"It's late," he says again, his hand sliding to cup the side of his neck. "Eleven thirty."
Greg smiled at him in the mirror again, though his eyes stayed focused on the road. It was a tolerant smile, a bit like a parent trying to coax a child. "It's only for an hour or two. Come on, you were like a kid in a candy store until you found out it was your old stomping grounds. And weren't you bugging me for a case just the other day?" He shared a quick glance at John before looking back down, his smile settling. "I'll consider it a favor to me, how's that?"
Because he's

for it."
He shivers, not because of the cold but something deeper, more primal, and he pulls even deeper into his blanket.
He looks down at Sherlock, and sees him spread out just so because he knows any other way will hurt his back. Both hands are thick clumps of gauze with his fingers stiff and sore, and his left arm rests against his chest in a sling and cast, where it will remain for another two weeks. He sees the shadows under his bloodshot eyes in his ashen face, because Sherlock can be

"He's been better," he snaps. It's gruff and his voice is sore. His chest throbs, and he's torn between throwing Mycroft out on the street, and knowing the last thing Sherlock wants right now is a witness to his struggles. "I've been wanting him to talk to a therapist.
John has heard him.
Sherlock leans back, as comfortable as a man can possibly get when using a cold streetlight for a crutch and with sticky wine still drying on his face. He settles himself in to watch the show, and for a truly bizarre moment, really wishes he had some popcorn to go along with it.

He has never seen John looked as exhausted as he does right now.
"Right," Sherlock murmurs, frowning away. "The latter. You are my ideal John, after all."
Over and over, the answers were the same. Little tidbits of information that painted out a Sherlock that was familiar and yet not. A picture that was almost right but didn't
"It's a shame," John sighs, even as he summons Angelo. "I liked this shirt."
"We're at home. You, and me, at Baker Street. We're safe. You're wearing the pajamas you hate because you spilled acid on your favourite ones. We're out of milk. We have extra salt, because you made a whole pile when neutralising said acid-- no, we're not using it on any food. The kitchen's a wreck right now, actually. Please say you'll help me clean it today. Sherlock."

Sherlock, who sat there blinking like a poor deer in the headlights. He just
Sherlock does not move. Sherlock holds John in place and stares through the slightest gap in the curtains and does not even breathe.
She sits there, staring at and holding a muffin, looking sad.
Sherlock started to pull away, lifting his head up to stare at John with wide, indignant eyes. "I've never--"
He kisses Sherlock's face. His lips, his cheeks, his nose, his hair,
. But I will not--" His throat scratched at itself and he shifted, suddenly having to tear his eyes off of John's. "I will need to think about the rest."
"Preferably an annulment, actually. If you can manage it. Whichever one is cleanest." He pauses, leaning just a bit heavier on the bed. His elbow is close enough to nudge Sherlock's knee, and he leaves it there, nestling through the blanket. "Just get the papers to me at the soonest possible convenience and tell me where to sign."
Sherlock fakes a cough into his tea, and grins.
Mycroft said abruptly. He passed a hand over his face again, squeezing the bridge of his nose, and for one bewildering moment looked, not alarmed, but exasperated. "Are you
John wasn't stupid enough to believe that, and neither was Ella.
excepting perhaps his statement just before it. But he doesn't care. He does not care.
"Yes," Sherlock said. He all but fell over himself in his rush to get it out, his eyes bright. It reminded him how he'd stumbled over himself talking to Irene Adler, that first time; that he was just as flustered now as he had been back then. Christ. "Yes. Of course. It's-- that would always be all right with me. John."
In retrospect, John should've seen it coming.
Confirm his own guesses, and add fuel to the fire.
He couldn't do anything to protect Sherlock. He couldn't do anything to go after the people that had done this to him after the fact. And now he can't even be there for him in the aftermath, because he's not a bloody one in a million genius able to pick up an entirely new language in just a matter of weeks.
Yeah. "Okay," he sighed, brushing through his hair. "I just... I want to do this right, Sherlock. I
"No, Sherlock, I mean I'm not meeting you in the lab." She raises an eyebrow, pinning him with a no-nonsense sort of glare. "Not unless John gives the okay."
John understood the sentiment. He even agreed with it, a little. No matter how much responsibility he felt over it, Sherlock had still made the choice to relapse. Of course he didn't want Sherlock to be in pain, but maybe the hell that detoxing and withdrawal was would make him think twice the next time.
John stood there in the doorway. Right there, breathless and damp and ragged all over from from a sprint to catch the last ferry of the night, his luggage exchanged for the shape of his gun underneath his jumper.
John just shrugs when Sherlock signs as such, dropping his head back to his knees. He does not look like he wants to move from the bathroom floor at any point in the foreseeable future. But when Sherlock takes a step closer, John pushes at his knees, like a cat butting his head against a door. "No, Sherlock, I don't want--" he coughs, a deep, wet, hacking one, and when he clears his throat it sounds like he's swallowing glass. "I don't want to get you sick."
Face opening like a sunflower, Rosie strode over to where John was grumbling over the wine, Sherlock nowhere to be found. ‘Try not to look too cheerful, it’s not like my only child’s getting married.’ Seizing the opportunity of having a possible like minded person, John urged,
'You know what I mean.'
'That is a very childish way of securing a promise, the particulars of the finger does not change the likelihood of someone following through on the promise.'
'Oh?' John leaned closer,
‘SEE.’ Rosie turned to James, who went to hug Sherlock, and then slipped away in search of his wife. Sighing at his retreating figure, Rosie turned to them, ‘I suppose I had better go and help Miranda. It’s almost time. Poor girl must be terrified.’ She smiled at them one last time, before walking away, ‘Nice tie by the way.’
The man spoke of love through the ages, and undying loyalty, in sickness and in health. Both women repeated the vows, each with a little smile to the other. But inside John there was still turmoil. Of course they were in love, of course they thought they would be together forever, but breaking up a marriage hurt so much more than breaking up a relationship. They were so young...what if they found someone else along the way? What if things just simply couldn’t work out between them and they’d already bought a house together? What if they should have kids, and then have to divorce at only 25 because they fell out of love again? Poor Miranda would be heartbroken, and it would all be stupid Amy’s fault. He sat there and pitied, worried, seethed, she should not be getting married. Someone needed to stop this, she’d barely become an adult, she still had uni to go to and they were going to different ones. It was ridiculous, an impossible notion, and this was it. If no one else would step up to the plate, he would. Let them try out long distance first, see how it worked before such a commitment was taken, it was only wise. And if he were the only person in the world that would do this for her sake then he would, he would be her grandfather and do his job. The words were bubbling on his lips, just ready to spring out when Miranda said 'I do.' and Sherlock took his hand. Everything that had been building up inside of him dissipated, scattered like a house of cards as Sherlock’s head touched his shoulder. Blinking back tears, John squeezed his hand tightly, remembering how thirty-eight years ago it had been them standing at the altar, how long ago it seemed, how young they were. Weddings meant love, and he supposed all they were was a celebration of the love that bound them, just as it bound Miranda and Amy. Leaning his head against his grey hair, John closed his eyes for a moment, revelling in how lucky he was, and had been, that all those years ago he’d been in need of a flatmate, and that Stamford had had the good sense to direct him to Sherlock. His friend, his ally, his husband.
‘SEE.’
‘Ok. Let’s get this baby out of me.’ The doctor gave a thumbs up from behind her legs,
‘Come talk to me when your ‘flatmate’ decides he’s moving out.’ James’s eyes widened as she shot John a dirty look. ‘You don’t know what you’re talking about.’ Smugly sipping his wine John said, ‘Nope, but Sherlock does. It’s quite handy.’
‘Leroy, I want...where’s LEROY.’ The boy, previously banished to the corner of the room to
‘I care that she’s happy. And she is.’
'You still coming?'
‘It is what it is.’ John nudged him at the reference, and Sherlock’s face creased in memory, fondness overflowing his features until John almost felt the need to look away, it was too much. Too much love, too much happiness. He didn’t deserve it. But Sherlock did. Sherlock deserved every inch of happiness that he could scrounge for him. And so help him, he would spend the rest of his life scrounging for those inches until they could be fit together to create the happiest life he could ever live.
'Would you have married me at eighteen?' Sniffing, John turned to clean up the tea that was seeping through their hardwood table, Sherlock didn't seem to care. 'John, answer the question. When you avoid you make it obvious that I've won the argument.'
'Don't sugarcoat it. He is.' A startled laugh escaped him and laughing as well, she looked a little embarrassed,
'Um,' he began tentatively, his fingers threading around his cup of tea, 'I think she just went out for a walk,'
‘Surely you think this is ridiculous too. I mean, she’s barely graduated for goodness’ sake.’ With eyes that were so like Mary’s, Rosie gave him a look. ‘I let my daughter make her own decisions. Just like my fathers let me do by the way.’ Grunting in frustration he said,
'-A doctor,' Sherlock muttered but John ignored him,
Satisfied, Rosie plopped her head down on his shoulder, and allowed him to carry her to the cot he'd had installed in his office, in case of emergency babysitting events like these. Curling up under her blankets, she fell asleep almost immediately. The immediacy of it caused a hint of a smile to grace Mycroft's face, before someone knocked on his door and it vanished.
‘Yes, but she didn’t. She’s safe, and so are we, and you go and visit her sometimes. You find a way to adapt Sherlock, we always do.’ Sherlock started at him, uncomprehending,
‘I love you too.’
‘You are being way too calm about this.’ A smirk bloomed on John’s smug face, and he leaned in teasingly, ‘Well, for once I’m being the rational one, I’m quite enjoying it Sherl,’
‘I don’t know why it’s not starting, it worked fine when we came here a few hours ago.’ John frowned, ‘Are you sure? Did you hear a kind of grumble as you were driving?’ Leroy opened his mouth but Karleen but them off, ‘I’m sorry, are both of you really going to start a debate here as if either of you know anything about cars? I’m having a fucking baby. Get me to the fucking hospital before I have it in this bloody car.’ Leroy gaped open-mouthed at the string of expletives, John supposed she’d never strung that many into one sentence before. He woul have taken the time to congratulate her, but unfortunately they had more pressing matters at hand. ‘Right. Cab. Right.’ John quickly took up the task, lest Leroy find a way to cock this up as well, and then shot a quick text to Sherlock.
'She's always less angry with me when I bring her biscuits.'
'Thank goodness we're never having kids. Can you imagine him as a father?' They both looked at him again, and seeing them watching he stopped his dancing to the song he'd been humming, and waved at them nervously. John surpassed a grin.
'People will believe anything.'
‘No I don’t.’
‘Statute of limitations,’
‘Try and exist as little as possible’, rushed forward, taking both of their places. Stretching out his mangled hand, John couldn’t say that he was particularly sorry for the switch in positions.
‘Leroy I swear to fuck if you don’t get the car to start right now I will slit your throat myself.’
‘Alright then.’ They shared a grin for a brief second, before the music began, and they turned to look at the doors.
‘How’s Maggie?’ James’s face turned softer, in the smile John had only ever seen associated with her name. ‘She’s coming, the twins are being annoying.’ Rosie shouldered him, to which rolling his eyes, he ducked away from, ‘How are the little buggers? Have you thought of a name for the new one yet?’
‘Completely impossible.’
‘It’s a boy.’ The doctor moved to hand him to Karleen, but she shook her head avidly, holding Leroy’s arm that was around her shoulders.
'Let us try again with a more sophisticated subject. You can draw anything in this room.' Rosie's grey eyes passed over the room carefully, scrutinising every object, before her head snapped up excitedly. 'Draw you!' Mycroft sat up a little straighter,
‘I’m not!’ Shrieked the little boy, ‘You’re just scared of everything.’ Her bottom lip wobbling, Helena stuck her tongue out at him. ‘I’m going to be very happy with the new baby. This one will be nice, and won’t smell.’ Angus wriggled so violently on John’s lap that he had to grab on to him to stop him from sliding off. ‘I don’t smell. Right Grandpa? I don’t smell.’
'Where is Karleen?' Karleen's unfortunate boyfriend shrugged his shoulders nervously at John's outburst.
‘Moriarty didn’t have anyone that he loved. Part of why he was so exhausted and bored was because he was alone. We won’t let this baby be alone, ever.’
‘But I’ve got something amazing to ask him about. I’ve been reading this really interesting theory about-’ she quieted as her eyes tracked something in the crowd. John followed her line of vision, but couldn’t see anything. He blinked in annoyance, his eyesight was going, just last week when Sherlock had passed him another one of his self-made crosswords (the ones in the newspaper were ‘laughably easy’ apparently), he’d needed to hold it an arm’s length away, and even then he was squinting. Sherlock had wanted to take him to get glasses immediately, but for some reason John had shrugged it off. He didn’t want glasses, he didn’t need people looking at him like he was elderly, someone that could barely get out of his seat. And now his granddaughter was getting married...his oldest grandchild at that, but still.
'Absolutely not. Listen to me Rosamund, you are above this. You are not the barbaric, murder obsessed idiot your father is.' Firmly turning the page in her colouring book, he then said,
'Exactly, I'm about to be a father for the second time, I need to focus all my energy on that.' Opening his mouth, Leroy searched for a retort, but could find none. Exhaling harshly, he snapped his mouth shut and moodily swiped the wallet. 'Alright, alright.' Muttering something, Leroy trudged his way to the winding line, hands in his pockets. Karleen watched him go, not without amusement. Swivelling in his chair, John moved to face her again,
‘There is no statute of limitations for this sort of thing.’
‘Was it in the army that they taught you how to read people? It’s very impressive John.’ He scowled at the sarcasm in his tone, ‘Maybe I’ll ask Mycroft, he is the smarter brother after all.’
'You want me to get it? But the line's massive,'
Leroy withstood her iron-grip without flinching, brushed the frizz from her forehead back. Meeting his eyes, she nodded firmly, and Leroy leaned down to whisper something. It was by completely chance that John even heard it at all,
First came Amy, her face shining as she was escorted by her parents, her train dragging behind her. John had to admit she seemed happy, perhaps her face was a little more trustworthy than he’d given her credit for. Half a crown was woven into her flaxen hair, John idly wondered what the significance of it was. Turning again, John caught sight of Miranda,
'I never really minded before. But now, with the whole pregnancy thing...he's been so useless John. And it made me think, what if something big like this happens again? he won't be able to handle it at all. I don't want to constantly be doing everything by myself.' Pressing his lips together, John contemplated the situation. It really wasn't any of his business. Was Karleen too good for Leroy? Definitely. No question there. It was obvious from the first moment they walked through the door and Leroy had said, 'Not that I have any problem with it, it's alright with me. But...does this mean you'll need to have sex with the curly haired one?'. But then again, he was always very nice to her, and to be honest he didn't want to influence any of her decisions, especially not when she was in labour. 'Well...there's always an idiot in the relationship, no? I'm Sherlock's idiot. He's quite ok with that, at least I think he is.' Grinning, Karleen offered him a chip, John accepted. 'Yeah, but you're like mediocre idiot. Still smart enough to be of use, you know?'
'Mhm, mhm, mhmmm. Goodbye.'  Swiftly hanging up, Mycroft turned to the bleary eyed Rosie, who'd shot up at the sound of the phone.
'Promise?' She stuck out her pinkie.
'When I do I'll be sure to drag you down with me. I'll tell them you carefully poisoned me over the years.' Sherlock scoffed, shaking his head,
‘We’re not naming it Rosie.’ Huffing, she grabbed a wine glass,
‘Begging your pardon sir, but we are around five minutes away.’ Mycroft nodded, and folded the drawing with the utmost care. She really was a very talented artist, usually he couldn’t stand the scribbles of children, but hers had a most interesting quality. He supposed she was naturally gifted in that area, as she was in most others in his opinion. He had failed to see how it was possible to gaze upon her work with the lack of enthusiasm his coworkers had shown. I mean really, as if he were Jennifer, who showed them new pictures of her brats every week, and no one had the decency to tell her her children were ugly and that pictures of them should probably not be allowed.
‘Understandable.’ John laughed delightedly, threading his hand through Sherlock’s arm, tugging him along as if they were two teens who had just fallen in love, and not two married men with two years of a marriage under their belts.
'Nothing.' Tracking her eye movement, John understood. Turning to Leroy, he cleared his throat and took out his wallet,
The summoned taxi appeared almost instantly, and the three of them piled in as it sped towards the hospital.
'John, John where are you? I need you.' Hastily closing the photo album, John Watson ducked around the corner of the door to find his husband searching around the room, a frown dragging the corners of his mouth down. 'I'm here.' His head snapped up instantly, and taking him in, Sherlock released a rare smile. Then it slipped away as he held out his tie, huffing like he didn't care about his inability to handle the thing,
Sherlock was enjoying himself immensely, or as much as one could enjoy stressful situations. In his case, it was a great deal. He'd spent the past few weeks perfecting the conditions of the hospital room they'd booked for Karleen. Right now, it was all coming together like a beautiful equation. The doctor was on standby, the room was sterile (he'd gone over it again after the doctor had left, as one could never be too sure what ordinary people might leave out. Human error was so irritating and inconvenient), she had both a bed and a birthing stool, and Sherlock knew the exact room that they had the pool in and the quickest way to get there, if she should want to give birth underwater. He had three red towels, completely new and washed, folded and crisp on the table. He'd brought both peppermint and Lavender into the room, for a soothing scent in case Karleen were to get stressed. He'd gone over all the lessons from Lamaze, and were confident that they were locked into his mind palace. If needs be, he would be right there, breathing with her. There were three bottles of water, just for Karleen, and a smaller towel to wipe her brow for when she would sweat. He'd even brought cleaning supplies in case she should defecate during the birth, as he'd read some women did. He'd made sure the room was in a quiet part of the hospital, and only two metres from the nearest operating room, so that if something were to go wrong, she could be wheeled there instantly. They were far enough from the canteen to make sure that no disgusting food smells would disturb her, and he'd placed four chairs in the room, after hours of knocking on the doors of hospital rooms and asking if he could have some. He didn't understand why people had been so annoyed at him, it was just a simple request, and how was he supposed to know that they were removing the catheter at that exact moment in time? Anyway, it didn't matter. The room was completely ready, he'd thought of every possible situation, and had even remembered the small gift that was stuffed deep into his coat pocket, awaiting the new baby. Reaching into his pocket now, he squeezed it gently, unable to believe that this was actually happening. He, Sherlock Holmes, was going to have another child. And this time, the child had been a conscious decision, a decision made between him and John. Obviously, he'd love the new one just as much as Rosie, but with Rosie there was never an exact moment when he became her father, he slid into the role, already there before he even realised it. Now it would be different. The baby would come out and would mark him as its parent, immediately. It was inconceivable. Improbable. And if he was being honest, just a little bit terrifying. This baby had his DNA, had Eurus's DNA. What if this baby became just like her? If it did, it would be all his fault, because they were his genetics. Rosie was perfect, had always been perfect, but that was because she'd had John's genes, and he was perfect. He could never fail her. Sherlock could fail this baby, by just being himself. Oh God, what had he done? How could he think that it would be a safe idea for him to have a biological child? Look at what happened to Eurus, Moriarty. Both had been far too clever for their own good, and it was highly possible that this baby would be cleverer than Sherlock himself. What if he was condemning a baby to a lifetime of loneliness, to a life behind bars because it didn't understand the fuss around the moral dilemmas of good and evil? What if this baby was more clever than Eurus? What if the baby felt like they were completely alone in the world? What if they couldn't find a John, couldn't tether itself to the world, and ended up being miserable? All the preparations that had been made before seemed so foolish now, so naive. What was he going to do? He hand't thought this through at all. And John, John would be heartbroken. Shaking, Sherlock dropped onto one of the plastic chairs that he'd stolen, which squeaked loudly in protest. What had he done?
‘He said it was important for my development to rebel against my parents. He was worried that I would never become a well-rounded person without it.’ John had to hide his smile a bit at Sherlock’s enraged expression. Mycroft had, if possible, read even more parenting books than Sherlock had. It irritated his husband to no end, how much Mycroft was involved in her upbringing. ‘Don’t worry, I’ll talk to him.’ Rosie stuck her hand on her hip,
'OI.' Slipping past him innocently, Sherlock called back,
'Come on, call your idiot and let's get out of here.'
'What's on the stick?' Smiling, Sherlock tapped his nose, and dropped it into his shirt pocket.
'Yes?' Rosie turned her colouring book so that he could admire it. Leaving his desk to come sit next to her at the long, polished oak table, Mycroft narrowed his eyebrows at it.
‘What’s this about? Nerves? Because that’s completely normal, I was absolutely terrified when Rosie was born, I was sure I was going to cock everything up-still am to be honest-’
'Yes.' They were silent for a moment, remembering. John's eyes darkened as he thought of how he himself had doubted him, and he dark years that followed his 'death'. If he had to go through something like that again, a shudder passed through him. They were old now, getting older every day. One of them would soon be gone, and have to deal with it all over again. A strange sense of resolution washed through him however: if Sherlock went first, he wouldn't be far behind. He'd lived long enough, and he didn't want to spend the last years of his life in a world that had had the light taken out of it. What was the point. Besides, he had to make sure Sherlock wouldn't meet some random hottie in whatever came next and decide to ditch him. 'But they come back,' John was shaken out of his reverie by Sherlock's earnest gaze. A rueful smile dotted his face, 'Yes, the good ones do.' Sherlock's eyes darted to the floor, unable to deal with everything he saw in John's eyes, but he was there. They both were. Sighing, John looked again at the envelope, the roses seemed significantly more rose-like now. 'I guess if they're happy...'
‘You did all of those things as well, you just learned to hide it better.’ John’s eyebrows hit his hairline as Rosie punched James. ‘Owww.’
‘No you wouldn’t,’ he said calmly, ignoring the way she stuck her tongue out at him. Eyes back to scanning the crowd, John asked impatiently, ‘Have you seen Sherlock Jamie? He’s been gone for quite a while now.’ Scoffing, Rosie stretched out her back,
'Karleen!' She turned her head at the shout, her lips tugging downwards in distaste.
‘I think her face is untrustworthy,’
‘I still don’t think it’s a good idea, she has an untrustworthy face.’
'Ah, it's your emotions again.' Gesturing so wildly that the mug of tea spilled onto the desk, John cried, a little louder than intended,
'Why is it taking so long?’ Walking over to her, Mycroft stuck his hands into his pockets,
‘Having you guys as parents is the actual worst. You know all my other friends were able to sneak people in and drink all the time?’
'S-she said she didn't want...company,'
Karleen’s veins were prominent. Incredibly, incredibly prominent on her forehead. So prominent that Sherlock had taken the time to ask if this was normal, to which both the doctor and Karleen had responded with a steely glare, and John had hastily stepped in to pull him out of harm’s way.
'I mean...'
‘Sherlock?’ He blinked, and seemed to come back down to earth. ‘What’s the problem?’ he asked softly, moving his thumb over his knee, showing him that he was here. When Sherlock spoke, it was so softly that John almost missed it.
‘Snitches get stitches,’
'Promise,' she insisted, it still waving in the air. With a sigh, Mycroft threaded his around hers, and shook it once. Honestly, the levels to which he stooped in order to make sure the girl had a proper upbringing...
Throwing her head back, Rosie laughed and ran to meet the man that was speeding towards them. The man threw his arms around her and hugged her tightly, his fingers splayed out across her back, and recognition rushed through John. A smile creased his weathered face as he held out his own arms. James turned from Rosie to him, holding him just as tightly, if not more, causing both of their bones to crack. ‘Ow, do you mind? Respect your elders.’ Rolling his eyes, James adjusted his tie. The simple gesture touched John, melting his heart. James lived very far away, he didn’t visit nearly as often as he should. He was too busy with his children and erudite wife, helping her with her research. They’d had three, something John would never have expected from the shy boy that had quaked in his boots everytime Rosie brought her friends over, and pushed everyone who could possibly get close to him away. Ironically, Rosie, who was as extroverted as they come, pulling everyone into her orbit, urging everyone to be her friend, was not married, and had only one child with a one-night stand.
‘Yes. It could. But we’ll just have to cross that bridge when we come to it.’
‘Poor baby.’
‘Mycroft knew what?’ A hand rested on John’s shoulder, and the discomfort of the search flew out of his body. His spirits immediately lifted, John turned to him, ‘Apparently Rosie was engaging in regular criminal activity without us knowing, with Mycroft’s approval.’ Frowning, Sherlock said, ‘Why would Mycroft let you do that?’ Rosie smirked,
‘You don’t do that anyway darling, you spend half the nights roaming around, trying to solve old cases.’ With a wry smile Sherlock leaned back,
'Well those are two completely different situations. Besides, I was in the army then-'
‘Big push for the shoulders hon,’ Karleen’s grip started to slacken. Alarmed, John tightened his but she shook her head, panting.
'Well I won't argue with you there.' Sherlock quietened, reaching to brush an errant stray hair from John's forehead. His hand rested for a moment, where it lay against his temple and closing his eyes, John leaned into the touch. It had been thirty-eight years since they'd said their vows, and John still felt himself stealing touches like a teenager, wanting to sink into every moment Sherlock was near him. He'd never thought he could have loved like this, not after Mary, whom he barely cared about compared to this. How wrong he'd been, how blind he had been. But that was all in the past, Sherlock and him had had a lifetime together, and if they were lucky could have a lifetime more.
'It's impossible.' Rolling his eyes, John stepped forward and took up the offered piece of clothing. His eyes widened,
'...It's a skull.' Rosie nodded vehemently, her blond curls flopping over her ears,
‘That’s what I said. But she wouldn’t listen,’ Angus complained, his eyes accusing. Shrinking into Sherlock, Helena whispered, ‘Angus is being mean again.’
'Giving birth is a very complex natural procedure. These things take a lot of time. It's best not to worry too much about it. Now, I think it's time for bed.' Rosie shook her head, her body wriggling so furiously she almost fell off the couch, Mycroft lunged forward to catch her, but there was no need. She'd recovered. Suppressing the hint of pride at how developed her motoring skills were, he adopted his strict voice, 'Yes Rosamund. It is vital that you get enough sleep, how else will your brain develop to its full potential?' She gazed up at him reproachfully, but a large yawn interrupted the cutting effect, 'See, you're tired. We must listen to our bodies.' He scooped her up in one movement, but still she shook her head. Grabbing his face between her two chubby hands, she implored him, 'Please? I want to be there for new baby.' Mycroft tried to stay strong, only a fool would succumb to the pleading of a child, but alas, she was simply too good at getting her way. When she was older she would be a force to be reckoned with, perfect at the job he was doing right now. No enemy would stand a chance. 'When news comes of the baby, I will wake you up and drive you there myself, ok? But only if you go to sleep now.'
‘Say that the baby is like Eurus, which is unlikely by the way,
‘-so what?’ Sherlock stared at him,
'If you love him Karleen, nothing else really matters, no?'
'I think everything about you is charming, but unfortunately not everyone is attracted to assholes like me.' Grinning, Sherlock responded,
Ah. So
all he likes, his brain needs sleep just as much as anyone's, and he is very clearly
Lestrade blinks again, startled. "For breaking his own antique vase?"
John clenches his fists and balances himself against the wall, his eyes squeezed shut as he fights down the pounding in his head. This will not help anyone. Having a screaming match with Mycroft or getting himself too worked up to calm down; neither of those things will accomplish the only thing that he wants, which is to be with Sherlock. No matter how much he wants to end this in giving Mycroft the dressing down of a lifetime and wringing his idiot genius brain out like a dish towel-- he needs to be with Sherlock more.
He trailed off with another great breath of annoyance, ducking his face against his interlocked hands, looking exasperated beyond words. He shook his head once, so vigorously his hair whipped back and forth with it.
"What do you
On his way back into the city, John found himself unsure of what to say. Greg was driving him after a visit to the crime scene himself-- it was a long enough drive that carpooling was all but a necessity-- and after only a moment's indecision, John had told him to drop him off at his own flat rather than Baker Street. He'd promised to do better by Sherlock, but he'd also promised to do better by Rosie, and tonight, he could feel that the right thing to do was spend it with his daughter.
Greg and Sally appeared in that moment, the sergeant barely able to hide how pleased she was with the situation, the D.I. truly worried about it. A bit later, angry groups of parents started arriving at the hospital, looking for John, blaming him for leaving their children at the expense of a madman.
Mycroft looked at him, surprised, and scrutinized his face, trying to read his boyfriend's true intentions. But Lestrade's face didn't show anything else. He nodded, a little disappointed. He never thought that Lestrade would be inclined not to accompany him. Although he had pushed him to do so, it was because he wanted to know if Lestrade would stand by him, but…, bloody relationship gibberish!
"Yes, but I don't know we are going to do it," replied Mycroft, worried.
Lestrade, on the other hand, noticed he was losing control for seconds. Mycroft's ass muscle spasms were driving him crazy, his moans, his face. He gave several deep, quick, strong pushes to Mycroft's prostate, making him scream, and just as he started to come, he pulled the ring off his submissive's cock, both of them coming at the same time in a brutal orgasm that made them scream with pleasure. Mycroft's body twisted spasmodically as Greg continued to push his cock as he came inside him, Mycroft's come staining both their chests, until Greg dropped onto a trembling Mycroft.
When he received no response, he turned to John.
John licked Sherlock's lips. The detective, a bit baffled, opened his mouth, letting John's tongue invade his mouth, embracing each other, both tearful, damaged, broken, and finally, comforted.
"When Moriarty shot himself, Clay was in charge of making sure that the gunmen killed you if Sherlock reappeared" continued Mycroft.
Molly and Mrs. Hudson were delighted with the idea and did not hesitate to tour the city searching for the dress Rosie was most excited about. From then on, Rosie whispered plans in the landlady's ear while, to John's delight, Mrs. Hudson laughed, amused, both glancing sidelong at Sherlock, who squirmed uncomfortably in his armchair, knowing nothing good for him could come from such secrecy.
Once there, John wished the earth to swallow him at that same instant.
"I will wait here until he comes,' replied the landlady, turning resolutely to one of the waiting room chairs.
“I’m scary and brilliant.”
Sherlock repositioned himself in combat martial stance, legs apart, knees slightly bent, the right elbow and forearm close to his body, the left arm placed slightly in front of the body. He smirked smugly and beckoned the man with his left hand, mockingly inviting the mercenary to hit him.
"Sherlock, what..?" he asked, pulling his arm violently to turn him over. Shit.
"For me?"
"No, your Papa won't give you permission either".
"This is all very enriching," he muttered, forcing himself to look away from the DI.
"As soon as I put Rosie to bed, I'm coming with you."
Strange clenched his teeth, sweating from the effort to rotate the rings backward. Suddenly the green rings burst into a thousand pieces, and the wind blew even harder.
“Sure? Maybe you need two fingers to confess the truth…”
"Which I guess you enjoyed memorizing".
look.
"You have to work much harder to lose me, Mycroft Holmes. But, this is the last time something like this happens, and you don't tell me. You'll figure it out how, but, next time, warn me, okay?".
"I am an army doctor, which means I could break every bone in your body while naming them," replied as he approached Tony.
The final scene of the chapter, when John conforts Sherlock, is based on the movie "Good Will Hunting", in its "It's not your fault" scene. I thnk is one of the most healing and helping for people who had been abused or maltreated , so I decided to adapt it a bit, but respecting the original dialogues and attitudes of the moving.
“Glad to see you again, fucktoy”.
“Now they want me to end with the saga. But that would be like killing him a second time.”
"He was an addict. His body metabolizes sedatives and any kind of chemical faster than ours," replied Mycroft.
"You know what I mean," he said, gesturing towards the packets.
Sherlock gave in and nodded. John was checking his pockets.
"Did he really call his mother?
Greg pulled both clamps slightly, and Mycroft would have come if he were able to. He noticed Greg's wolfish smile. God, he couldn't deduce or try to predict anything, his brain, drowned in pleasure, seemed to have run aground, and there was no way to move it.
John threw his head back, closed his eyes, and tears streamed down his cheeks. A hallucination, a hallucination repeated itself. He opened them again, hoping that the ghost of Sherlock had vanished.
"Where did you get this marvel?"
Thanks for reading!!!!
"It doesn't matter, it's great!" smiled Peter, putting his cell phone in his pocket.
"It would be much more discreet, and, besides, he would have asked me to set it up. You got Rosie to safety by a miracle, and they have been watching the flat ever since. Something's happening, but I don't know what it is. And that worries me".
Sherlock dug himself into the ground. He did not want to hold John for fear of hurting his shoulder further. Mycroft stood behind him, knowing John was so infuriated with him for everything that happened that he would not hesitate to break his head. John inhaled depply  and stopped his advance. He knew Sherlock would never defend his older brother if he hadn't a good reason to do it.
She shrugged and nodded, her eyes shining, her lower lip trembling a bit. John sighed relieved. For a moment, he feared that the girl had heard them. He hugged her.
"The fridge! I forgot it!" he stuck his head in so deep that John was afraid it would stick to the bottom. "A jar full of eyeballs! Disgusting! It's great!"
John shook his head.
"Stop playing games".
A long string of needy and whimpering moans filled the kitchen, accompanied by John’s growls and groan, both lost in their shared pleasure.
"Why don't you go and join them?" he asked, gesturing towards the window.
"John, life can't be lived halfway. You either live it, or you don't, and living carries risks. It's impossible to be completely safe. The fear of losing what you already have is preventing you from enjoying it."
"What happened? Apart from Rosie's." she lowered his voice in the last sentence.
"John, John, it's me!"
It could not be otherwise. Four murders in four weeks. All of them committed on Sundays, the same modus operandi and victims who had nothing in common with each other. Anderson and the rest of the forensic team had combed the four crime scenes and found no clue about the author. The case had them baffled. But the worst part was that the press had echoed about it, and the citizens of London were terrified by the possibility of being murdered by “the vampire” as they had baptized the murderer since victims had been bled to death. (Lestrade was still trying to guess how this data could have arrived at the journals).
"He's right, Tony, this is very serious. He created an anomaly," supported Bruce.
Sherlock snorted.
He turned his head to kiss John.
"Look who's here" announced Donovan, appearing through the door of Mycroft's living room, where Sherlock, Rosie, Anthea, Molly and Mrs. Hudson were chatting while having tea and watching a Disney film the girl selected.
"Sherlock, what's going on?"
Holmes shook his head.
"To you," she replied.
"Of course he's not going alone. He's not stupid."
John sat down and filled his plate up with a bit of everything. Sherlock took a piece of toast and smeared it with jam. They began to eat breakfast in silence, enjoying the warm sun that autumn day.
John gritted his teeth, and Sherlock cursed to himself. The memory of John and Mycroft's row at what happened in Serbia still hung over them.
Suddenly, a strangle golden circle appeared in the ground, under his feet, and started to spin, slowly at first, gradually accelerating, sending golden sparks around it, until a kind of black hole opened under him and the ground absorbed him.
"Molly Hooper gave me this for you." Lestrade handed her the envelope. He didn't want to be rude, but he knew that not knowing they were coming from Sherlock, the woman would shut up.
“Donovan, if I were you, I would go for a brain CT scan or something. Sherlock Holmes is not real. He is the protagonist of John Watson's novels.”
The DI raised an accusatory finger at him.
"So, what were we doing there?"
"Yes, Geena has everything ready."
Lestrade chuckled.
*******
And then he understood.
“Ryan?”
"A compelling anti-gravity force, capable of exerting a great deal of pressure on space-time, more pressure than there would be at the core of a neutron star," continued Tony, "and that will keep the passageway between universes open."
"If anything happens to her, I will kill you."
“He will be on his way.”
John took Sherlock's hand and put it on his groin, so the detective could feel the doctor's hard cock under his trousers.
"What did you say?".
"Donovan, if you are going to shoot me, do it now because if you don't, I will. I would like to get back to the conversation John and I were having as soon as possible."
Sherlock pressed his lips. John didn't tell him, but he deduced it the same day he told him he enrolled Mycroft's mission. Mike had been, if not a boyfriend, someone very special to John. Another reason for not wanting him to go. Sherlock didn't want to appear as the typical jealous husband, but he was afraid of what might happen when Mike met John again.
A minute later, John started slowly stroking him. Then he sped up for a moment, and just when he sensed Sherlock's ball tensing and his cock throbbing, the needing to come building in his low abdomen, he let go of his cock, and Sherlock whined in frustration.
Anderson opened his eyes, surprised, when he noticed Lestrade and even more when he looked at John.
"John……. John, no mmmmmmmmmmmm” gasped the detective, as John penetrated Sherlock's ass again, this time with two fingers, and yet, he put his cock in his mouth all the way in, while with the other hand he held Sherlock's hips to prevent him from bucking uncontrollably.
"With Mrs. Hudson."
“Then you have to go back to the camp.”
“Yes, I know“ Sally’s tone was something like
"S... Sally, are you okay?"
All the heads turned to Mrs. Hudson, who, enraged, gazed at them from the bedroom door.
“To finally fuck you in the mattress, giving you the ride of your life, fucking you so hard that you would be walking funny for a week.”
"Mycroft, you are always boasting about being more intelligent than me. Now you have the opportunity of proving it's real".
"It must have more than 1500 square meters of living space".
John just bit his lower lip for a few moments and finally nodded.
“You can be really scary when you want to. I’ll keep you informed”.
The detective threw him the most murderous look the soldier ever had to endure. Sherlock was so mad that, when he tried to speak, he just choked, unable to verbalize the torrent of thoughts that crossed his mind which, John was sure included various ways of torturing his future husband for his daring. But realizing John wouldn't change his mind bout it, Sherlock came up with a Solomonic solution:
“Oh, I can do it too” John replied.
"Don't be grumpy," said Sherlock, kissing him again. "It's our wedding day."
"I met Sebastian in medical school. He was older than me, older than everyone. As he said, his vocation was a late one, and it wasn't until he was twenty-nine that he realized he wanted to be a doctor. We were together the first days in a chemistry practice, and we liked each other. He was intelligent, attractive, and nice, above all, he made me realize there is nothing wrong with being bisexual.
The ghosts of John and Sherlock's past spun slowly and began to fade while Everett and Thor continued to fight their own.
******
"He was suffering. Very much so. Much more than he expected or could bear. John's marriage to Mary was too hard for him. So much suffering attracted his other reality here, to help him. If I had closed the portal, nothing would have happened, but when he found it open, he jumped into this dimension".
Sarah’s mother coughed, embarrassed and approached them.
"Major..." Sherlock wasn't going to let me tell him what to do.
The detective opened his phone and searched through Rosie's photos. He didn't have many. He didn't want to become one of those parents with the phone loaded with hundreds of images of their children; although, if he were honest to himself, he wouldn't mind; he was just doing it to safeguard his image of a highly functional sociopath.
"Well, some of those people want to come in here" the girl looked at her, scared. "That's why you must do everything I tell you, don't make any noise, and don't leave my side, no matter what."
John nodded, surprised when he saw Sherlock grabbing the microphone again.
“Get out! “ she shouted.
Sherlock looked at him, upset.
"They say when you are going to die, you see your whole life passing in front of your eyes, but I only could see all the things I would never live with Sherlock. All the love, the cases, the rows, the…" he blushed, and Mrs. Hudson chuckled a bit, "I would miss, and, for the first time, I felt terrified at the thought of dying. Because, ever since I met Sherlock, I felt my life had a meaning; I felt, after so many years, my life was worthwhile, that I was worthwhile. Before I met him, I was so alone, so empty, so useless..."
Mycroft grabbed him by the arm, but the DI broke loose and continued to walk away with great strides. It was a mistake to come back with him after what Mycroft told him about Serbia, only because he seemed to care for him after being shot. What was wrong with him? How could he have been such a fool? How could he still be in love with that, that…?
They both ran in the direction of the yells. In an adjoining waiting room, Sherlock was banging chair after chair against the wall, hitting them with all his strength, howling in anger and pain like a wounded animal.
"I'll tell you what you are going to do. You'll meet Moran and asked him for a second chance to kill the doctor".
"I asked you a question."
Sherlock pressed the man harder against the wall. His legs wobbled, and he seemed incapable of supporting himself, as he kept sobbing and muttering pleads.
Sherlock's phone buzzed at the Avengers facilities. He looked at the name at the screen and put it again in his pocket.
John pinched the bridge of his nose, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.
“Maybe this helps you to feel better,” kissing Sherlock’s lips.
Bill let go of a dry mumble. His friend was about to say something, but he closed his mouth when the gate opened, and fifteen armed men came in. One of them held a beaten and bloody Jonas, pointing a gun at his head; the others untied John his friends, handcuffing them afterwards.
“John will fetch it“ the detective cut him.
He put his hands on the counter and dropped his head, drowning out a sob. It was too late. Too late, he came to his defense. Too late, he made his feelings about the detective clear. Because, as he ran in handcuffs beside Sherlock, when he took his hand, he realized he wanted to spend the rest of his life this way, holding his hand. Not as a friend, but as his lover. His love. His lover. But it was too late.
"Can't your men do anything right? They just had to keep an eye on him!"
"John?" asked Holmes, absolutely overwhelmed, looking at one and the other, alternately. "But what…?"
“And meanwhile let’s talk about the electronic tracking device Lestrade’s found beeping in his coat,”John said, exasperated, probing Sherlock’s jaws.
"Fuck Sherlock," groaned the doctor, panting, looking at Sherlock's tongue, devouring his cum, while his orgasm faded. He smiled at the detective.
"I don't know either. Everything I said before is true. I don't know who they are or why they are planning to do. My part was only to trick you into getting far away from London. I swear that's all. I only wanted to protect Rosie," he muttered, desperate, his eyes filled with tears.
He forced himself to keep his eyes open, looking at the detective. The torture was worth it. The pleasure shook his body harder and harder, as the detective bit his lower lip, forcing himself to keep up, trying to control the shaking of his body, now moaning hard every time he impaled himself in John's cock, in chorus with the doctor.
"You got it, Mycroft?" growled John in his best Captain's voice.
"Did you record it?" asked Lestrade furious.
Mycroft gave him a file containing several photographs of boys around twenty years old, all of them dark-haired, slim and with blue or green eyes.
"I was wondering... if... as it is our wedding night...or weekend or… whatever," he gestured to his surroundings. "If..."
"Jesus fucking Christ," moaned John, tightening embracing him, feeling Sherlock's warmth engulfing him. Sherlock let out a mewled loud moan at the bliss of finally feeling John's hot big hard cock inside him, desire, pleasure, love, and intimacy flooding his brain. John slid into him in an agonizingly slow pace until he bottomed out. The detective lay on the top of him, also face up, reclining on John's torso, both facing the dark, starring ceiling, the sea lapping their legs.
