as soon as he goes away, Cas gets all kinds of crazy ideas into his head, and when Dean comes home everything’s weird and there are problems and he and Cas go through some shitty, awkward, sort-of-fight, and Dean is sick of it.
They wait thirty minutes at spear point while a messenger is sent to notify Crowley and retrieve his instructions. The guard at the gate numbers two dozen people, give or take, and Cas likes his odds much less, if Crowley isn’t receptive after all.
Cas has probably been misinterpreting some things over the past few days, should probably take some time to reevaluate, though it would seem it’s too late to do anything about it.
Dean kisses him, and Cas kisses back without hesitation, warm and solid and possibly/probably in love with Dean, just the way some part of Dean always wanted him to be.
“No, I just—” Cas cuts off, takes a deep breath. “I’m . . . overwhelmed, is all. The weekend was hard, and then yesterday, and — it’s just, um. It’s been a lot.”
“What you wanna do, later. You know — accept that marriage proposal, or go to Anna, like she wants. Or — or are you still on the fence?”
myself at you. Daily! If you really wanted to—" He cuts off, something vaguely miserable in his eyes. “Why wasn’t it happening?”
opportunities to change your mind, to back out of your dumb b et and tell me the freakin’ truth, and you passed every one of ‘em by. And you as good as said you
Cas supposed to go from here, with Dean so on guard? He really might decide to just try and kill Dean outright, and while that’s not a
“Oh.” Cas never thought about that before, though he should have; knights-in-training have much more freedom here, but Cas still knows people sneak out of the barracks. “Ah. Yes, they must have.”
“Go, Dean,” he says once he’s finished, bored, and even though Dean feels like there was something kind of weird about that cough, he’s not about to look a gift horse in the mouth.
It doesn’t feel right to share the panties story, since somebody else knows about it, and all his other super-secret sexual fantasies are kind of only super-secret because they heavily feature
sorry, because you deserve to know before it happens, but — but still, I know it might hurt, and you probably won’t like it, but you’ll be alright. So try not to be too afraid. It’s a normal thing that happens, and Naomi will be there the first time, and —”
Dean is curiously silent at that, and after another moment to recover his surprise, Cas hastily steps back, gesturing them inside.
“For what?” he asks, and Cas can’t even begin to understand his tone. It sounds less like he’s trying to feign ignorance of the problem and more like he thinks there’s a right answer.
“Right,” Cas says slowly. “That’s . . . true. Just – I was just thinking that that might have seemed, um, gross, to you.”
“And they’ve — the army is holding the line West of the capital. But Lucifer’s trying to push through.”
it’s the botanist. He’s several inches shorter, and his shoulders are so narrow Cas thinks he might easily slip through a sewer grate.
“Alright. If you both feel like this would interfere with your plans. Although, couples usually do holidays together, to some degree.” She smiled, somehow wry and sly all at once, and tugged at a dark curl. “Shame. I had a rubric and everything.”
“We are. But you aren’t.” She sighs. “He hasn’t been good to you. And we’re all very disappointed in him, trust me, but I’d think you’d be worse than disappointed.”
Any other time, with any other person, he’d laugh, because what the hell kind of line is that, but Cas—
“I see.” He lifts his shoulders, absently studying the chrysanthemums. “Then — yes. I’d like my things. The bed isn’t necessary, obviously—" though a part of him is tempted — “But if it isn’t difficult — my clothes, at least. And my favorite nightgown — it’s the one like the sheets. I’d like that.”
Cas suddenly regrets his earlier efforts. Now that he considers it, simply playing a game with Dean doesn’t seem like the same opportunity as having Dean show him.
He’s not sure how long he spends, washing that single plate, but by the time he makes it to the bathroom, it’s already nine.
The council could say no, could deny them anything more than they already have — could potentially separate them for good, though Cas is trying to pretend that won’t happen; and even if they don’t, Anna will be furious, and Cas will miss Mills Park, desperately, but — he could be in Lawrence, with Sam and Charlie and Kate and Pamela and
time Cas looked at him, like he was going to drag him to the bed and strip him down and have his wicked way with him.
Said drive takes about three-and-a-half centuries, enough time for empires to rise and fall, and as a result, Cas has plenty of time to have second thoughts about bringing Dean to his apartment.
And then there comes a moment, Cas burying soft sounds into Dean’s shoulder as he frantically grinds down, nearly sick with jitters, when Dean’s mouth dips even lower, settling right there at the juncture between neck and shoulder and sealing over
Dean takes him to a movie Wednesday night, after school has let out for break, and actually, Cas enjoys himself quite a bit.
it feels both incredible and tragically unfair, because if Dean would just toss aside the loofah and slide his hand a scant few inches left, he could
Dean licks his lips, tongue quick and fleeting before it disappears again, leaving them shiny in its wake.
“Is that what the kids are calling it?” she asks, a weird note in her voice, and Dean gives her a quizzical smile.
playing when Anna leads him to Valencia’s room; part of him wants to suggest they just swap the TV in here with the larger one from the living room, but he’s not sure suggestions of that nature are welcome coming from someone who is notorious among their circle for being “bad at life.”
in order to doubt that, because people who want you dead don’t kiss you like that and then clutch at your shoulders and ask you to let them see their children once you banish them from the goddamn city — then not only does Dean owe him an apology for the other night, he owes him an apology for all the ones before it.
“Both,” Cas murmurs, gently continuing to flick his tongue out against it, nervous and exploratory both. He gives himself a minute to adjust, conscious of Dean’s scent, clean, silken skin beneath his tongue, and honestly, a part of him regrets his lack of recent experience.
I do. I’m-” He hesitates. “I’m attached to him, too. Like you wouldn’t believe. But this — none of this ever should have happened in the first place. And if I hadn’t been such a coward, hadn’t just — rolled over and accepted orders — it wouldn’t. So as much as we might wanna keep him . . . we can’t. We’ve gotta let him go.”
“Switched at birth, huh?” Dean whispers, stroking Cas’s hair as he mouths along the letters. “Should I call you James, now?”
It’s almost too much, he thinks. Cas getting jealous, Cas watching him with soft, happy eyes all day, Cas in his blue nightgown, Cas spending the night with him, Cas telling him a life spent with Dean would be a life well-lived, when Dean’s incredibly conscious of the fact that you don’t have to
complete with affectionate words and touches and the occasional bedtime snuggle and whatever else closeness entails, and not once has Dean thought of him that way. Dean spent nearly a week in the same damn room while Cas was
“Good,” Cas manages, and even though Dean’s a little cross-eyed from proximity, he can feel a slight smile on Cas’s face, too. Dean kisses it, because he can, and Cas sighs, his grip tightening on Dean’s shoulder. “Very — very good.”
“No. It was a very good idea,” he manages. It comes out with only about point-three percent of the emotion his body currently contains, but Dean doesn’t seem to mind, simply relaxes, eyes warming, and then he steps a little closer, and just as Cas is wondering how those pillows are going to figure into the night’s activities, if he’s going to end up biting into one while Dean obligingly rails him like he’s wrought iron and Cas is a balcony perimeter, or if those cheerful little bumblebees will tenderly cushion his head while he’s wrapped tight around Dean like Dean’s something as expensive as it is fragile being prepared for cross-country shipment and Cas is the aggressively-layered chip dip of bubblewrap, packing peanuts, and air pouches proudly standing between him and incidental destruction along the way-
And of course, there’s also the part where some days, John’s tied up with another commitment for the evening, so Dean tells Sam to get started on his homework and drags Cas to his room, where they sit on the bed and somehow it feels a little different, a little more private, and it seems right to slow things down and just take their time.
“Y-you can get off,” Cas offers desperately, and at that, Dean shoots upright, bursting into delighted laughter.
And if he tells Dean that giving Cas the things he wants has led to them having sex with one another . . .
Then he ducks his chin, the wet, pink tip off his tongue poking about between his lips, and a moment later, Cas feels it, warm and slick as it touches the sensitive skin of his wrist
“Yeah,” he says, voice rough, though Cas thought it lost the traces of sleep shortly after they’d come down. “Sorry.”
“It depends,” she mumbles. “That’s what I’m trying to tell you. It’s complicated. And even if she says no, or the talks never get that far — it still can’t be me. We met wrong, and no matter how much I think I like her, it — it’s not good enough.”
He punctuates the question with a sharp thrust forward, balls pressing up against Cas's ass as he buries himself impossibly deep, and a moment later, his hand wraps around Cas’s cock, slick and tight as he promptly starts fisting the shaft. Cas’s whole body goes taut, spine arching almost
dick would make sense, since Cas can’t do it himself and clearly thinks this is all Dean’s fault, anyway, but what the hell is the catch
As predicted, Dean doesn’t come to bed for another hour. Cas is halfway propped up against the pillows, eyes drooping as they struggle to focus on his book, when there’s a light rap on the door jamb.
At least, that’s what he tries to tell himself, following their weird dinner-and-a-movie night.Like, Cas is a good looking guy, sure, and his interactions with Dean are deliberately provocative, so of
“The library knows,” she says firmly, and if that’s not ominous, Dean doesn’t know what is. “Don’t worry about it. Have a very nice day, sir.”
Dean slides a second finger into him just as he sinks down, taking Cas as deep as he’ll go, and Cas actually thrashes beneath him, turning his head to the side with a hoarse cry.
There’s only a few candles in the room, but it’s far from being dark, and Cas tries to ignore the strength of scent in here. It’s almost overpowering
“I — okay. Okay, Cas,” he relents, and Cas would bet real money Sam is pacing, now. “God. Are you — are you going to be — okay?”
John takes a long swig of his ale, looking deeply pained, and Cas makes a note to include a description of it in his next letter to Dean.
With that, Cas grabs his cup of coffee and walks, leaving the rest of his breakfast to bask in Katya’s speechlessness.
They reach Anna’s, and though Claire’s farewell is somewhat abrupt, it’s more distracted than upset, so Cas decides to count it as a win.
“’We need to talk,’” Cas repeats flatly, gripping the edge of the sofa. “And what do we need to talk about?”
“I told you. I don’t get you. I moved out, and you didn’t even ask me why. I stopped talking to you, and you didn’t even try to
Cas. Nor has he ordered anyone else to do it. Cas continues to receive all his meals, and Kate told him this morning that his riding lesson was postponed until the day after tomorrow, which means it will still be happening.
to do with it. She did tell me, however, to stop thinking about the things I was afraid of and think about the things I’d be giving up.” Cas reaches out, fingers loosely pinching Sam’s tunic sleeve. “You are one of those things, Sam. And I would rather not give you up.”
“Investigating what woke me,” Anna returns dryly, and Susan laughs harder, leaning against the rail. Her dark hair has almost entirely escaped its bun, a pretty wave to it, and as delighted as she looks, there’s a bright red stain on her teeth Cas finds alarming.
“Alright. Then — put me on my back,” he commands roughly. “And hold me down like you want me here as badly as I want to be here.”
“It sounds like you both developed some misconceptions regarding the other person’s intentions, particularly during times of limited communication. I think you misattributed a lot of each other’s behavior. The important thing is to be honest, now, about what you want from each other.”
“Whatever makes him feel better,” Dean mumbles, just glad his brother doesn’t know Cas probably does that
To his surprise, he’s tired enough afterward that he doesn’t even need to read his book; instead, he goes right to sleep.
John just chuckles and leans his crutch against the siding, and although Dean’s still not sure he and Cas shouldn’t sequester for a week, the temptation of a hug is too strong.
As sweet as the trip had been, as much as Dean’s already desperate to turn around and go back — as hard as it is to tear himself away from thoughts of
“Hey, I don’t back down easy. And that guy over there is one stubborn son-of-a-bitch once you get him away from a joint or a piece of ass.”
interlude before he’s ready for round two – especially after a round one like that – but maybe this shit varies and Cas has a superhumanly short refractory period and he wants Dean to-
He gets to celebrate Cas’s birthday for the first time, that September. Too many grape schnapps and maybe something else has him feeling drunk and sentimental, and while he definitely doesn’t cry when Cas obligingly carries him up
“But — it’s not important. We were in the middle of something.” Dean clears his throat. “C’mon. Dinner’ll be here soon, let’s finish up.”
It’s probably a combination of both, he decides. And either way, he doesn’t blame Cas; he’d be shocked if Cas had already set aside his misgivings at this point.
“Yes and no? I just — I think — it’s time I spoke plainly to you,” he insists, and there’s a soft meow from behind Cas.
Dean mechanically resumes sorting through his papers, probably putting useless printouts in the keep pile and trashing important references, but he can’t help it.
Charlie gasps in outrage, and Jo asks if she should go over and give them a ‘talking to,’ an offer he numbly turns down.
to get there. And if they didn’t, if things ended the way all of Dean’s relationships seemed to, then whatever, right? It’s
Cas nods, and then Dean’s hand slowly slides up his length, thumb moving to sweep over the wet head of Cas’s penis-
If Dean can trust Cas not to harm him, and vice versa, then Cas should be able to trust him with this.
“Ah. Well. You should be proud, either way,” he offers, and she grins, bringing her coffee cup to her lips.
He could lose Dean, just like he’s always been afraid of. And while he might someday be able to ride into battle with him and protect him from the danger of war, he can’t protect either one of them from Cas’s apparent inadequacy.
It doesn’t happen, though. Instead, Cas’s arms wrap around him, pulling him down, his head shifting to tuck against Dean’s neck, and Dean swears he hears a muffled sob as Cas squeezes him tight.
“Seriously? What would that even look like, man? ‘Cas, could you pick up the kids from practice tonight?’” Dean’s voice lowered several octaves, in what Cas presumed was an attempt at mimicry. “’Sorry, honey, I would, but you know I always have an orgy on Tuesdays.’”
Cas crosses his arms, suddenly very uninterested in telling Dean all the things Sam told him Dean might want to hear.
It’s not really a problem, though Dean could have done without the hell-rut, and he doesn’t give it a second thought before he reaches the table and wraps Cas in a hug.
“That’s what I was hoping for,” Dean murmurs, and after a beat, he feels Cas’s head turn beneath his hand, and then there’s a warm, soft mouth pressed to Dean’s, Cas’s hips still urgently rocking forward. Dean tightens his hold on Cas’s back, more for himself than for Cas, because Cas’s breaths are harsh and fast and his scent is making Dean think of white-blue skies after rain and impossibly green foliage rich with dew, a near unbearable sweetness spun through all of it, but mostly it’s making him think of
that’s a good thing, thinks they both completely failed at the whole ‘quiet’ thing, Cas desperate and wild underneath him, Dean’s back still stinging from the way Cas’s fingers had dug in as they raked down it, body clutching Dean’s in every conceivable way as Dean had held his thighs open and fucked into him, drunk on the sensation of Cas’s sweat-damp skin and clawing fingers and the tight, slick grasp of his hole, eagerly taking Dean’s cock again and again and
Cas’s eyes widened, the color leaving his face a little as he strained to look at the hand on his back.
Cas returns to work the second day after his heat, and when his shift is over, the overseer calls out to him.
“Quiet,” John says sharply, though he doesn’t look away from Dean. “So — you feel obligated to him?”
Cas is on his second pot of tea, aimlessly pushing puzzle pieces across the table, not even trying to make them fit, when he hears the front door slam.
changes their mind? Because while Dean is reeling, doesn’t see how a hundred days is nearly enough time to make that kind of decision
He recognizes Uriel. Uriel doesn’t deign to push him around, to hurl insults and slurs at him. He just stands off to the side and looks on, like Dean used to.
Cas, too, is surprised; of all the things he spent the last few minutes worrying about, that hadn’t come up.
Dean stopped showing up after that, and very light, careful questioning of Charlie and Benny confirmed that he stopped drinking, too, never more than a few beers on any given night.
about you. I’ve got no idea who you really are, where you’re coming from.” Dean swallows. “For all I know, I might not really
“Thank you, Max, please do,” Cas says quickly, and then reaches for Dean, grasping the back of his neck more securely this time, and kisses him.
“Hex-trava-bone-za,” she corrects him. “And yes. I’ll see you in a bit. Go, play, do whatever, okay? I’ll be pissed if I see you sulking.”
“More specifically,” she continues, folding her arms. “I’m sorry about what happened with Dean. In hindsight — I think it would have been good for you, to have developed that friendship. And as hard as it would have been for me, whatever might have happened between you two then, as much as it has taken me time to understand . . . it might have been the right thing for you. Your father and I — we shouldn’t have interfered.” She sighs. “Certainly, we shouldn’t have made you feel like you would —
He pats the space right next to him, more toward the center of the bed than the other side, and Cas wonders if it’s just because he didn’t feel like reaching or if he’s intentionally directing Cas to sit close.
, and if Cas is taking his time figuring himself out, figuring out what makes him feel good, what maybe makes him
“It’s fucking weird,” he mutters, and Sam huffs, having heard Dean’s complaints about the bizarrely warm winter weather since they were a day out.
“Thank you,” he says, and then he kisses Cas, and suddenly, Cas thinks he understands everything. About Dean; about himself.
“Well, of course he will. Gladys at the sweetshop said she almost threw you out, ‘cause the pair of you were gonna make everybody sick before they even bought anything.”
“No — no, don’t — you can’t think like that, man. I’d never—” He takes a deep breath. “Okay. Okay, bottom line, Cas? If something’s making you unhappy — something more serious than my laundry piling up — I don’t want it. I don’t care what it is, it can go fuck itself. I’m not — the whole damn reason I thought we had to break up was because you
“Okay. Well . . . I better get going, then. Good luck,” he adds awkwardly, and Anna lifts a hand, smiling.
For right then, though, he huddles close with Bela and tries not to think too hard about what they’ve both lost. Bela’s floral perfume has faded a little, and the vague traces of scent beneath it are strangely familiar and comforting. She stays with him for several nights after that, and Cas is grateful.
It’s true; Cas sits by the entrance doing his homework and then chats with Sam after Math Club lets out, until football practice is over and Dean shows up (barring the rare occasion Dean gets there first). Cas intends to start giving them a ride home once he gets his car back, since it’s close enough that driving the extra block every day should completely escape his parents’ notice, but for now, they all walk together.
“Perhaps.” He looks at it for a moment, then reaches over to set it back on the table. “That was very kind of you, by the way. To give Max the sketching book.”
“Sweet,” Dean echoes sickly, although he mostly can’t see the bruises anymore. “Uh. Maybe — maybe not so much.”
he must be embarrassed — and he got a two page lecture on Edenish customs and how Dean needed to be more
“I don’t think he was concerned about the quality of sex he was providing,” Pamela says seriously. “In fact, he openly stated that he was worried that what you wanted was variety.”
“Valencia,” Sam says, and Dean would appreciate the stern note to his voice, except the fucking traitor’s lips are twitching.
Dean drank too much, this weekend. He’s not sure about alcohol poisoning, didn’t know it could give you hallucinations once you sobered up, but it must be able to because how is he even
Cas makes no attempt to move out of her way. Anna is clearly distraught, in some way, and even if she weren’t—
And Cas knows how he wants to answer, knows that his first, kneejerk response was the right one, that there is no amount of time he could spend thinking it over to come to a different conclusion — but he also knows that he doesn’t have a choice.
“Silverware is in the top drawer next to the fridge,” he adds, far too pleased with himself, and she gives him a faintly disgusted look.
He doesn’t get to dwell on it for long, though, because Dean abruptly changes the topic to some kind of fan convention Charlie gets to go to in the Spring, and Cas laments the fact that he’s never once been out of the state. Not long after that, he hears the garage door run, and reluctantly, whispers his goodnight to Dean.
like dates. (Mostly. Except maybe tonight, but that’s neither here nor there.) Dean certainly hadn’t told him, or alluded to his expectations for the evening. And how on earth is he supposed to fix it, now, to explain himself? It seems somehow tacky to send a text saying, “Hello, Dean, I had a very nice time tonight. Also, I’m sorry I didn’t know we were supposed to fuck.”
There’s something cautious, uncertain about it, and it makes Dean unhappy for about two seconds before he remembers that blue-eyed dudes in dresses are actually not why he’s here, and this guy is probably hardcore judging him for the fucked up reason he
That said, it’s a lot less likely to happen that way if Dean confesses now. Which, again, there’s nothing to confess to, but it still feels — weird, somehow.
Morning dawns, a little more tentative than days past, but no less sweet for the knowledge of disaster averted, and the routine of adolescent heckling, breakfast, and kisses goodbye is successfully executed without incident.
“And this is — this, uh. This — this is . . .” Dean stops, and the burgundy wallpaper reflects strangely off his face, turning his cheeks ruddy. He pauses so long, Cas almost wonders if he’s somehow
He should never have called Charlie. Clearly, whatever’s between him and Dean is best kept exclusively between him and Dean.
Cas trails after him, discreetly scenting the air in his wake, and Sam bids him goodbye and good luck before Cas has a chance to try and talk him into a hug.
Anyway, while Dean handles his morning ablutions, Cas explores the room a little, rather than waiting in the main area.
Cas has to wander around a little in order to locate Sam — he thinks he must have passed him the first time, but his brain feels a thousand miles away — and when he finds him, he appears to be dozing against a wall.
“Well, um. You want help with anything?” Worry dissipates, replaced by surprise. “I wasn’t, like, great at this in school, but I did okay. Maybe with both of us, we can figure it out.”
he thought, startled and somewhat in awe — and for the first time in their friendship, Cas suddenly had a secret to keep from Dean.
“I think it’s probably time to go back,” Cas says, kissing him one more time before disentangling himself and moving over to the driver’s seat.
we can arrange that, but I’ll have to double-check with my manager. If you leave your name and number, I’ll get back to you as soon as she’s in, okay?”
Cas spares a brief moment to wishing the sofa cushions would somehow just absorb him, at least providing a temporary cocoon until Dean returns from the bathroom, but alas, nothing of the sort happens.
“There’s — there’s nothin’ wrong with him, right? I mean — I thought he might be sick, but you guys were just lying about the attack, so — there’s nothing else I should know, right?”
“Fine. Later,” he promises, throwing Cas a dark look, and Cas practically sneers back, slouching against the window with an honest-to-god
In the end, Anna went back to the high school and Dean and Cas enjoyed their lunch together, all slights forgiven, and Cas went on to wear that bracelet for over a year before it fell apart.
Dean clearly misinterprets his silence, however, dropping forward with a huff, forehead pressed to Cas’s.
“Which — that’s one of the nice things about taking care of young children,” she adds suddenly. “Rarely do you get a chance to be idle.”
Chapter warnings: implied/referenced racism/xenophobia (details in notes), implied/referenced past miscarriage and infertility (details in the notes), implied/referenced sexual harassment (details in the notes), implied/referenced attempted trafficking (details in the notes), Anna/Bela, please let me know if I missed anything.
“Because he misses you and he knows you’re enough of an idiot to actually stay away,” she grumbles. “You big
“Nope. Cereal is for school days.” He shifts away, and Cas absolutely doesn’t cling, not even a little.
“Hey — how, uh. How about a bedtime cup of tea, when we get back?” he mumbles, wiping at his eyes, and Cas curls his empty hands, disappointingly cold without Dean’s grasp to warm them.
Dean’s expression slackens for a moment. He stares down at Cas, and there’s a strange, giddy feeling dancing beneath Cas’s skin.
“Shut up, Cas.” It’s not Dean’s fault Cas barely seems to notice discomfort once sex is involved. And it certainly doesn’t mean Dean is
“You love my beard,” Dean mutters, face a little hot. Cas has that far away, lust-drenched look in his eyes, and Dean thinks this was
Dean’s thumb doesn’t leave, though; instead, it slides over, back onto the skin of one cheek, slick cooling as the air hits it, and then his free hand settles on the other side, gently pulling at the flesh, parting him, and—
Dean forces a smile. Michael’s . . . nice enough, he guesses, and a little hot, at first glance, but he’s also weirdly intense and creepy as fuck, and Dean’s been jumping through hoops to avoid his various invitations since he moved in.
“Do monks golf?” Cas knows very little about monks, and porn almost certainly doesn’t count. It’s probably the
Sam barely waits for the front door to shut before he announces this, and Dean throws a panicked look back at it.
Though he feels a little rude; they always seem to run into the owners, at which point these alphas are obliged to sit down to tea with them. They’re all pleasant enough — he particularly enjoys the twinkling-eyed Lord Balthazar, though afterwards, Hester sits very stiffly in the carriage and says, “That was a mistake. He’s a favorite schoolmate of Anna’s, else I’m sure his scandals would have long since resulted in his exile.” Cas thinks this is a little unfair, given that Lord Balthazar just supplied him with no less than half a dozen ridiculous, bawdy tales to put in his letters back to Lawrence
“Are you now trying to tell me dating you for several months so he could have the satisfaction of breaking up with you is in any way a springboard for such a thing?”
were here, wishes he could tell Dean how good it feels, wishes Dean would smile at him and press in close and put his teeth on Cas’s neck the way he usually did by this point, a maddening combination of sharp and gentle until Cas needs it otherwise, and when he did, when Dean’s scent deepened and his teeth finally bit down, hard enough to sting, just the way they did the last night, then at
“It’s fine,” Cas says quickly, smiling back at her. “Besides, no one’s ever told me my scent was nice, before.”
” Cas tries to insist, but Dean is working kisses up and down his neck, simply changing sides when Cas tries to wriggle away, and the next thing Cas knows, his back is on the grass.
“Mental block? I don’t have a damn clue, but I talked to him earlier and if I had to guess, I’d say it ain’t even occurred to him that he could or should help Cas with his heats.”
Cas doesn’t laugh, or even roll his eyes. Instead, he tenses underneath Dean, and that gorgeous, blissed-out expression twists, turning almost — crestfallen.
Of course . . . Dean’s not giving him a lot to work with, yet. And when he insists that he, too, just wants to move past that — when he acknowledges that it’s hard, but he wants to
“What . . . what will we do?” Cas is beginning to feel a little afraid, aspirations of knighthood notwithstanding.
“Cas being gone. You’ve always done the leaving. We all have. Honestly — I kinda prefer it that way. I know we all act like Jo’s some rebellious teenager, but — can you imagine how much that sucks? Watching everybody go and having to sit here and
“That sounds like an invitation,” he murmurs, and stands, bringing their faces within inches of one another.
He thinks about the time he received that alarming letter from Anna a lot, this week. He thinks about how terrible he’d felt when Dean sent him away, and even though his broader experience with erections has taught him some empathy for Dean’s situation, he still remembers the feeling that Dean would give his attention to someone else when Cas needed him.
this, and when Cas fumbles a hand between them and starts jerking himself, the other tangling up in Dean’s hair as he earnestly whispers
“I’ll see you in class, Claire. Get the cowboy shenanigans out of your system before then, alright?”
overreacting. Maybe all he needs to do is visit a tavern and smolder at the right barperson and voila, no more perving on his best friend or tentatively trying to spin things so that it’s not
The game grows heated very quickly, and when Cas, the current bearer of his team’s wooden figure, is just returning from stashing it, he chances upon Jo as she comes from the kitchens with snacks.
“Give me three, Dean,” Cas instructs, lids looking heavy, a sheen of sweat on his forehead, and Dean complies, trying to figure out how to ask and wondering if now is even an appropriate time, because call him crazy, but that whole Cas-moving-in-with-Gabe thing could technically still happen and short of hogtying Cas and surreptitiously dumping him in Baby’s trunk, Dean’s ready to do whatever it takes to avoid it.
Dean’s quiet as they drive out of the neighborhood, taking the main road to a dirt offshoot that leads to a small parking lot by the woods, where a hiking trail begins, and it’s not until Cas kills the engine that he finally speaks.
Mild violence: An inebriated Dean decides to visit Cas in the middle of the night, and picks the lock on Cas’s bedchamber door so he can check if Cas is sleeping instead of potentially waking him up with a knock. Cas does wake up, and assuming anyone breaking in must mean him harm, waits by the door with a heavy candelabra. He realizes it’s Dean too late, and brings the candelabra down on his head, knocking him unconscious and nearly killing him.
“Uh. When Dean came back, and hit his rut and — well, you told me he couldn’t find anyone to help him, so I thought — I didn’t want him to suffer — but — but he threw me out. And when we spoke next, he — told me. All of that.”
Bela’s parents passed away in an accident five years ago, and her guardianship passed to her mother’s sister as a result; Bela confided recently that she still hasn’t met her.
They move to the end of the counter, the air between them stifling despite the general noise of the crowded cafe around them, and Cas looks so troubled Dean feels like a complete shitheel for bringing it up.
The loofah slides, ghosting over the dip between Cas’s cheeks without quite touching, and then Dean is vigorously scrubbing the other side, massaging the soap into Cas’s skin in a way that makes Cas feel anything but clean.
“Dean might be, but his council likely isn’t. And . . . I’m beginning to think it will hurt him as well as me, if he has to deny me.”
every night; he’s enjoyed living in the barracks, but he might be willing to move out now if it meant he could share a room with Dean.
“I don’t see how I’m torturing myself. I’m indulging his whims and enjoying the considerable perks that come along with it.”
and Cas must be more nervous than he thought, because his pulse is suddenly quickening and his skin seems to tingle, a tight, restless feeling building beneath it.
Cas nods, earnest, clasping one of Dean’s hands between his own, and Dean feels a burst of warmth and reassurance he’s not even going to try to pretend is coincidence.
Cas almost says, but Dean will blink big doe eyes and go ‘what’ and then Cas will have to explain that Dean pretty much just has to stand there
Dean sucks in a breath just before Cas’s other palm slides back into place over his lips, smothering it as he shoves Dean’s head back down into the couch and leans in close, breathing harshly through his nose and never once breaking eye contact.
He wonders if this remains a great disappointment for Dean, if he nurses this wound still, one for which he can get neither revenge nor resolution. Lisa’s reasoning is sound. Certainly, she made the right choice for her.
Anyway, it totally ruins Christmas, even though everyone’s doing a fantastic job of pretending it’s not mid-January, and by the time his birthday rolls around, he’s nearly ready to tell Cas he has his blessing to try and secretly date Sam, if only because he knows Sam will never go for it.
“Back in high school. Probably before that, too, but you know, I was a little too busy with comic books and D&D to care about that kind of thing.”
Cas wants Dean to come home, desperately, but he also knows things have been relatively low-stakes to this point. He can’t help but worry over the outcome.
The combination of honey and pie crust is mouthwatering, and Cas fervently hopes it tastes just as good.
Well, in theory. Dean suspects Sam just wants to wear him out so he doesn’t lay awake fretting, and the only reason he goes along with it is because Sam’s a giant fucking hypocrite and Dean wants to make sure he doesn’t do that, either.
They were a good ten years, despite the ones that had more downs than ups. And just like this last one, one of the things that made them good, that gave him so many of the ups he did have, the moments he’s always going to treasure -
“Me, too,” he whispers, to whatever it is that’s driving Cas. To be honest, he was hoping for this, has been missing Cas, missing just having him
John folded his arms, leaned back, and maybe the way he didn’t jump up and start shouting should have been a clue that something about this visit was different, but Dean was too pissed to give it a second thought.
And it’s great, always is, but his face is on fucking fire because even though this is totally about reassuring Cas and offering much-needed practice and a boatload of other really good, non-selfish reasons Dean can’t actually remember right now, he’s aware that this makes him look like a raging slut for affection being shamelessly indulged in their deviance.
He tries not to look too pleased about it as he sets the tray on the table; he’s not sure if he succeeds, but Dean is distracted, anyway, so it shouldn’t matter.
He clumsily wriggles his hands between them, scrambling for Dean’s buttons, fumbling his waistcoat open while Dean licks and nips at his throat, and when he gets to the small, tight buttons of the white shirt underneath, stubbornly nestled in their buttonholes—
“Just . . . if I’d been a woman, things would be easier.” Cas used to wish he hadn’t been an omega at all, seeing the clear social advantages of the alternatives, but if he’d been an alpha or a beta, they’d never have given him to Dean. “I could have taken my sister’s place, anyway, but – I’d be more . . . I wouldn’t have been whipped, and I wouldn’t have scars, and I wouldn't have been mocked on the Drive, and people wouldn’t ask me all these questions, and you – perhaps you’d-”
She pats his shoulder before she leaves, and Dean slumps against the door jamb, feeling exhausted even though he’s been in bed all day.
Anyways, Cas is also definitely not married or grieving the mother of his child, and while Dean’s heart fucking
“Arms up,” he says quietly, not meeting Cas’s eye, and on another night, Cas might raise a brow at the command.
He glances over Dean’s shoulder, to where the comforter is neatly folded at the bottom, Dean’s sheets snugly enclosing the mattress as promised, and beyond it-
“Alright, Dean. You just let me know when you need a refill. And don’t wander outside; it’s raining cats and dogs, and we don’t want you melting all over the parking lot.”
And Dean had been there for so many hours, waiting, desperate to see his friend and know he was alright, but—
“Shit. That was weird, wasn’t it? Sorry. I don’t know why I — sorry. Um. What can I get you?” she says quickly.
Cas’s fervor abates, slightly, and he watches Dean for a moment, lids heavy over blue eyes, face flushed and shiny.
Jess, she’s like my best friend now. We have almost all our classes together, you know? And she’s really cute, too, but -”
Except — Dean’s — oh, my god,” she mutters, burying her face in her hands. Cas might find it a little amusing, except if he’s understanding her correctly, he’s a little shocked. “How am I the daughter of a
“Look, you could be right! Maybe he doesn’t want you. But the way he acts around you, Dean, how he looks at you, how he talks to you, all that stuff — that’s not how somebody behaves if they don’t at least care about you a lot. And I know you care right back. So before you freak out, and before you go into a tailspin deciding you’re unworthy or something stupid like that, maybe you should talk to him. Just — listen. Give him a chance. I think he might surprise you.”
“That’s true,” Max says slowly, oblivious to his guilty smugness. “But — he’s a prince. I don’t think most people would try.” She hesitates. “Maybe it just makes him — more reasonable. Or — or kinder.”
. Angry sex is a thing, isn’t it? However pissed Dean is at him, over this and the last few months in general, that’s still a lot of intense feeling, and maybe he thinks fucking Cas up against a shower wall is a good way to work it out.
A little sullen, Cas drinks the full glass of water before going for the fork again, and Dean makes no move to stop him. Instead, he allows it, Cas probably leaning too far into his space and eating at least half of Dean’s dessert, and the only indication he’s aware of any of it are the periodic glances, warm and twinkling, he sends Cas’s way.
“Just keep going,” he gasps, and then returns to mouthing at Dean’s throat, unable to help a small moan when Dean immediately starts moving again.
Cas nods shortly and quickly departs, and Dean stands there, dumbly freezing his ass off in the middle of the field as he watches.
Cas is responsible for at least some of that soundtrack, but once he’s back inside the house, settled in a chair at the table, discomfort rears its ugly head.
Well, Cas doesn’t really understand why he left him behind. And he’s not being selfish; he doesn’t understand why Sam and Valencia weren’t invited either, when none of them have had the opportunity to shop for presents (with the exception of Charlie’s. Cas brought back the most absurd beta hat he could find for her).
because Dean wants it and Cas is just like, ‘eh, why not,’ but he’d be just as into it if it happened to be somebody else who’s there, then — then—
Cas doesn’t really know where to begin; it’s hard to figure it out, with the end looming over them like it is.
Quick note: Dean makes a comment suggesting his communication issues may have to do with the lack of a mother; that is a thought he has about his situation, but to clarify, gender should be irrelevant to a parent helping a child learn to effectively express themselves; and John should have been able to do that for Dean.
“Watch it, it’s still hot,” Dean starts to protest, but the guy is looking down at the table, brow furrowed in concentration as he slowly draws his finger along it.
see,” Cas counters, and then he fucking scoots closer, stare intent. “You’re a good man, Dean. Sam told me, a long time ago, that you’re afraid of doing the wrong thing. Let me prove, to us both, that this is what I want. And if it isn’t, or if it isn’t what you want, then — we move on. But we should try.”
Cas numbly apologizes, pretends he just forgot, because the school can’t help him here and if he tells them she just
Dean grudgingly shuffles inside, bare legs on full display, tight red spandex fitted with breathtaking snugness to his butt and thighs and hips and an incredibly interesting bulge somewhere in between. The pie-top Cas is irrepressibly fond of is, disappointingly, hidden beneath the shirt, but is no doubt waiting for his eager discovery once they’ve gotten started and the shirt (hopefully) goes the way of things.
There’s silence from behind him, and Dean feels something a little like triumph — straight up until he hears the front door open and slam.
“The difficulty in translation is preserving the atmosphere, the nuances of feeling, that the original maintains. Any story worth translating is more than X happened in Y place to Z people. The words an author uses to describe what’s happening make the difference between the reader knowing what happened and the reader feeling like they experienced it themselves. Or — for example, suppose
He was suddenly acutely aware of Dean’s palm, a hot weight on his shoulder blade. He craned his neck to look at it, at the solid proof of Dean’s intent.
“Well, yeah. Why wouldn’t I? Kinks don’t have to be ‘in-character,’ buddy. Hell, sometimes, that’s what makes them kinks.”
“Sorry,” he says gruffly, forcing himself to fidget with his napkin a little. “It just — that had meant a lot to me. That you said that. So it, uh, kinda sucked, when it turned out to be a lie.”
Sam Looking at him, but there’s coffee to be drunk and it’s too early to deal with it, so he ignores it.
“No. No fucking way, you don’t get to say that. Maybe he went to Eden because of me, but it’s been almost a
He can see the gardens from here; they seem to stretch nearly from the castle to the forest, and though he’s too high up to see much detail, there’s a maze of hedges and an enormous, sparkling fountain, and an abundance of color that suggests
Once there, Daphne takes him all over the central island. They’re much freer in the Isles, though her father insists that, out of respect for Eden’s custom, they be accompanied by a guard which may double as a chaperone. Cas doesn’t bother trying to tell him it’s unnecessary; ownership of him appears to have reverted back to Anna, and he’s aware now that his exploits reflect on her whether he likes it or not.
“I could be,” Cas points out, squinting down at the burgeoning yellow rosebush. He’s still not sure how much water is enough, or what’s too much. He doesn’t want to waste it; he already feels bad for whoever has to prepare the big tanks of it for him to fill the can with.
“’Put out’ is slang for ‘have sex,’” he explains kindly, smirking at Dean, and Cas nods seriously, gaze going distant, which — Dean doesn’t even want to know what
Sam makes a really weird, constipated face at Charlie, who glances uneasily at Cas, for some reason.
Cas puts cheese on all of it and waits, desperately hoping Dean’s going to cool off and come back out, but an hour goes by and the apartment stays silent.
It takes a moment, Dean blinking as he tries to interpret that any other way than how it sounded, but — no; it definitely looks like Cas is done here, is hastily moving
is to fix his relationship with Dean. And since he can’t figure it out himself, he needs someone else to tell him how.
“You want me to tell them how I wanna eat breakfast with you and feed you apples and try to talk you into snuggling with me afterward before we have to leave?”
“Uh. Depends on how fast a learner you are.” It was a weird question, and Dean’s not sure what the angle is. For a moment, he swears Cas seems frustrated, but then an idea hits him. “Hey — how ‘bout we go out this afternoon?”
were the one who wasn’t normal, that if people did give you what you needed, or what you wanted, they had their own reasons for doing so, reasons separate from you. And by doing that, I think she taught you to vastly underestimate your potential value to others; to go into any relationship assuming you always had less to offer the other person, and that because your needs weren’t normal, that whatever you received in return was both conditional and given reluctantly.
“Date each other. Your point’s not about love or whatever, it’s about commitment. So, like — prove you can be devoted partners. Don’t sleep with anyone, cohabit peacefully, go on regular dates, be involved in each other’s crap — you know. Make each other happy. Or at least prove you can not upset each other. Actually, I know a couples therapist—” At that point, Charlie seemed disturbingly enthused by this plan. “—and you can go see her once a week to check in, have her evaluate you both, and after . . . say, six months? We’ll see who wins.”
thing. Dean’s still figuring Kevin out, given that he’s only been following him around campus and low-key researching him for a few days, but he’s pretty sure there’s not a lot to figure out. Kevin is your classic overanxious, overachieving honor student, and Dean’s heard him talking on the phone to his mother three times today alone.
As for Dean — Cas likes to think Dean is responding well to his subtle efforts, because while there are still silences, tense and uncertain, he doesn’t sense the same hostility. Dean doesn’t try and antagonize him, these days, often reluctantly participates in conversation, when Cas can think of a way to make it, and a part of Cas almost thinks his strange mood has another source. Dean seems almost —
did to him, because it’s not. Cas has been struggling through this whole pandemic, and prior to the stupid fights about Balthazar and the shower, Dean was doing everything he could to keep him afloat.)
it like at the castle, anyway?” Mr. Kent asks. “You didn’t say in the interview, and I gotta be honest, we were all thinkin’ the worst. My wife cried when she read it over breakfast; said it must’ve been so bad you couldn’t bear talking about it.”
Amused green eyes peer down at Cas, Dean’s breaths still a little short and fast as they puff against Cas’s nose.
“I wouldn’t leave — my home.” The words come out halting, and Cas listens, feeling out the shape of this new lie. “This is the longest I’ve lived anywhere, and it’s got all my friends and my family, blood or not. I don’t know what he’s talking about.”
And since Dean’s still sleeping great and a thorough search of the apartment turned up zilch as far as drugs go . . .
“We are. We grabbed a bite to eat, and then I decided I wanted dessert. But we couldn’t eat a chocolate cake with just the two of us, right?”
He hesitates; it’s true, that this happens in practically every other book he reads (the novels in Crowley’s library are
“Cherry? Yeah, good idea. We had apple a few days ago.” Dean nudges his own menu off to the side, smiling at Cas. “You want a slice? Or you wanna try something else?”
But he did, and Cas feels — betrayed. He thought he’d come to understand Dean. He’d thought there were some things, at least, that he could trust.
(It should have been awkward. And it was, in some ways, with Cas’s nakedness in between each pair, able to feel himself thickening just a little in response to the way those eyes watched him, but it was awkward in such an unexpectedly pleasurable Cas isn’t sure he would have stopped for anything short of a natural disaster crashing in through the window.)
“Me, too, Cas. I’ll be countin’ the days.” Dean clears his throat. “Susan, you mind giving us some space?”
He racks his brain for some kind of solution, terror coursing through him, and then he thinks of it.
“Uh.” Anna’s going to kill him, probably, but since he can’t really think of a good excuse to send his mother away when they’re already entertaining guests she’s close with— “Yes, of course. Although — I think Anna’s just about to put a chocolate cake in the oven.”
Charlie, though . . . Charlie’s one of the nicest people he’s ever met, but she’s nobody’s fool. Even if she thought Cas was a harmless cutie when she met him, if Dean
“Dude, don’t worry. It’ll be awesome. Meg’s like — you know, you hear people talk, she knows what she’s doing.” Dean paused, then winced. “Shit, not that — I don’t mean she’s a slut, ‘cause she’s not, she’s cool, I mean, you know that, you like Meg. And like, she’s smart, so you’re not gonna — I don’t know, catch anything, I don’t think she’d — look, I just mean — she’s good at this, you’re going to have a great time.”
“Good night, Cas,” she interrupts, mischief back in her eyes, and she gives him a gentle nudge toward the room. “You have work tomorrow, don’t you?”
Cas sleeps fitfully, dreaming that he’s back on the phaeton, driving an endless road lined with laughing crowds, or getting lost in a maze of gardens that seem to have no entrance and no exit, nothing but more greenery on the horizon.
“My mother hugged me after school every day, until some time in elementary school,” he says shortly. “After that — I was scolded, if I asked for hugs. I stopped fairly quickly.”
Dean sees him out after the movie, hovering close as Cas puts on his coat and determinedly avoids looking at him, lest his eyes somehow ask for things he can barely stop his mouth from demanding.
And before Cas can even articulate his shock and pleasure, another figure moves into view, dark hair only halfheartedly pinned and hat rakishly tilted over her smirking face.
what kind of suffering she’s inflicting on her masochistic followers and she’s nothing but satisfied because of it.
And then it hits him, what this actually means, that after Cas gets back from work, Dean’s going to have him to himself for the
“Yup, headed back to my room after you dropped off,” he lies, and he’s honestly not sure if that’s relief or disappointment on Cas’s face.
cares, and since Cas seems preoccupied with making sure Dean gets something out of all this, then he should understand that Dean doesn’t want to do sexy things with anyone else for the same reason he’s getting plenty out of this already.
“And they both comfort you when you’re having a bad day. Unless you’re like, weird, and you’re not a potato person.” She pauses. “That is, a person who likes potatoes, not a person who has potato qualities. Like Mr. Potato Head. Oh, hey, logic circle.”
You knew he was treating you like a mate — and he totally was — and you fell for it, hook, line, and sinker, and now he’s taking it all away. He should have known better, but he just — did what he wanted and now you’re hurting, and — and somebody should have said something to him! Or said something to
“Fuck, I’m sorry,” he sighs, and then shuts his eyes. “I mean — sorry. Language. You’d think I’d have fixed that, with a thir—"
“Because they missed me letting Cas go. Punishment for all of us,” Dean adds, relieved at the change in subject.
“So just, try to keep your shoulder down,” he says, applying slight pressure to Cas’s shoulder with his other hand, palm warm through Cas’s t-shirt, “and let your elbow line up more naturally — yeah, like that — but relax—"
his shoes, which — Dean’s not so sure about that. Cas just seems so — he’s so — Dean doesn’t even know how to describe it, but he’s so
“Take care,” Sam tells him meaningfully when he hugs him, and as much as Dean wants to be annoyed at the warning, he accepts that his brother is just trying to look out for him.
“She has a point,” Kevin interjects helpfully, and Claire almost jumps; she’d thought he was reading. “They’re grown ups. Who knows what they’ll decide to do? They’ll probably just end up eating ice cream and watching the History Channel, like my mom sometimes does after I go to bed on weekends.”
His first impulse is to protest, to remind Dean that he said they could wait — but he realizes now that that was years ago.
“Just — just because someone has feelings doesn’t mean it does any good to act on them. Dean said he wanted to be with me. I trust that. I’m upset, too, but — it’s not necessarily his fault if he can do nothing more than offer me a place in Lawrence.”
“All I’m saying is — if there’s any part of you that’s just — caught up on what almost happened, if you don’t have it in you to actually be in this, for real — don’t do that to him. Please.”
“Yeah, I am. And I want to say she started it, but maybe my pride is more important, too. Maybe we’re just not . . .” Sam swallows. “Maybe the argument’s not what I should be letting go here.”
“You’re gonna be just fine, hon. I gotta get some stuff for you and then I think we better have a talk.”
“I appreciate that — really, I can’t even say how much—" Dean snorts. “But I do think I have to go, now.”
This thought torments her for several hours, because yeah, of course she’s in the way; she’s known that since Cas had to take her in. But — she’s not
“Dean — Dean’s just one person, even if he is important. The most important, maybe. There’s still other important things. Like — like — Layla still puts out honeycakes, but nobody eats them, because they’re too
Chapter warnings: unhealthy coping mechanisms, flirting between Dean/other,  implied homophobic John, implied sexual content (bottom!Dean), more details in the notes, please tell me if I missed something.
After Dean takes off his shirt, Cas reaches out to touch. Dean dodges, patting his stomach, and says, “Maybe don’t.” Cas points out that he clearly works out, and Dean says, “Not as much as I should.” Cas says he thinks Dean is going to the gym for the wrong reasons.
“Well, I mean — if you — if you, um. If you liked Dean. And since you’re — you know, married? Not that I’m saying it
Dean had said he wouldn’t come to call for two weeks, but once he does — is that all the company Cas will get? Cas doesn’t even know how long it takes, or if Dean will call on him every night; what if it’s
Well, he feels a lot less bad about getting an orgasm out of Dean’s pandemic bullshit, is all he’s saying.
he admits. He doesn’t usually play drawn-out games like this, just finds brief, straightforward hookups that require little finesse and never linger in his mind past the night.
“Ah. True,” Cas agrees, a little breathless. “For both of us, actually. You said you’d never done this before.”
Dean hums, the tip of one finger catching at the edge of Cas, nearly sliding in before Dean lightens his touch and passes over him instead.
“Anna,” Cas says tiredly. “Samandriel is young, and he’s been a good friend, courtship efforts notwithstanding. He was simply – misguided.”
But — that’s fine. More than fine, really. Dean’s grateful it happened the first time around — it brought Cas to Lawrence, after all — but they’ve gotten everything they wanted out of it, at this point. Hell, once Cas sees firsthand that his place in Lawrence has fuck-all to do with their marriage, all the weirdness about
Safely away from prying ears, Dean reluctantly walks her through the final clusterfuck of their fake relationship. To his surprise, she smacks him across the back of the head before he’s even got the last word out.
“By all means.” She follows him as he starts down it, shaking her head. “All those hours he spent with you, I thought he was just digging his claws in deeper. I even considered that he was
“Gee, I don’t know. Because I probably would have come in about thirty seconds and forgotten to warn you before I did?”
Dean hesitates, trying not to look at the table full of people or think about how they all assume he spent the last week excreting in agony.
Cas cried the whole walk home, scared and profoundly hurt, and he hid in his room the whole next day, feeling small and sad and convinced he would never see Dean again.
Cas spends the last half hour of the trip in his lap, squirming in dissatisfaction and helplessly baring his throat while Dean mouths hungrily over his neck, hands squeezing at his rear in a way that is both intensely pleasurable and intensely
On the one hand — the act of going somewhere else, regardless of where, makes him feel even further from home. But ever since his birthday, Cas hasn’t even been sure he’ll be able to go back home. And he seems to be getting worse in Eden, again, and if the unknown future is what he’s afraid of . . .
“Okay. I’ll, uh. I’ll try not to.” He hesitates, throat twitching under Cas’s thumb as it strokes over the skin above the cloth. “Can I — ask you a question?”
“And I — I have tried to keep my tongue, because it isn’t my business, and you clearly don’t want to hear anything said against him, but even
But he’s pretty sure his amusement would be short-lived. Pamela seems like a cool girl, but Cas suspects going around town telling people they’re on dates — a tale that would no doubt find its way back to his Dad eventually — would prompt Dean to immediately tell him to get lost.
him. Not like he loves Sam, and Anna. Cas supposes it’s because he spends so much time with Sam that he's developed that love for him, although they didn’t grow up together. Sam feels like a cherished brother in a way that none of Cas’s actual brothers ever have.
“Yeah. Yeah, I — honestly, I regretted agreeing to the bet pretty much right away, because I thought — I mean, there was a lot of shit I just didn’t understand, about how we’d got there, when things used to be so . . .” he shrugs, scratching his neck. “I was — afraid, I guess, that the bet would . . . you know. Break it for good.”
And then he stalks to the door, grabs his jacket and shoes, and walks out without even stopping to put them on.
“Well, don’t keep him waiting. I expect he’ll want to see his little sister home safe.” He returns his attention to Mr. Wilson. “And as for you . . . well, if you sit tight, the doctor should be back any minute.”
. How could it be goodbye? I mean — maybe it should be, but — but I don’t want it to be. I don’t see how it
He can already scent Dean’s anger, and he’s not excited to see if it worsens once Dean knows what he did.
“She’s . . . doing alright, right?” Sam asks, rubbing his neck. “It’s, um. It’s been hard on us, without letters. We couldn’t even get them from Dean.”
“That was a good idea, Dean. I hope I can do that for you. Can you fill me in on where you left off?”
They settle among the growing crowd, chatting a little with nearby friends while they wait for the countdown to begin; as the minutes pass, though, Cas a warm weight against his side, Dean can’t help it. All year, the strategy has been to find an opportunity to kiss him, one where they can laugh it off and easily go back to normal without any awkward conversations, and even though all his previous attempts failed, more than Charlie even knows about – they were
Now, though . . . if anyone wants Cas gone, for any reason, he’s beginning to think they’ll have to forcibly remove him. Otherwise, he’s not leaving unless Dean, specifically, commands him to.
“An open relationship,” he repeats dully, just in case, and Dean takes a deep breath beside him, eyes still on the road.
finding his own way back without me, but he took Sam home and then he wandered around looking for me. And he wasn’t even mad. Just sat next to me for a while, until I finally manned up and took him home.” Dean shakes his head. “Didn’t say a word about it. I still felt like shit, of course, but — I don’t know. I was really glad, that he was there, that he did that — that he didn’t try to make me feel bad or anything.”
“Dean. We clearly don’t have all the answers here. I see that you’re attached, and you don’t want to upset things, but — we need to find out who he is. We need to find his family.”
“Sorry,” he mutters, carefully tilting away from the prince. He tries not to mourn the loss of heat. “I must have slept for a long time.”
“I don’t sound like that,” he protests, shoulder blades pinching together as he arches a little lower. “And it was just a — a suggestion.”
Cas forces himself to stay relaxed, eyes on his mug, like he’s not always hyperaware of what Dean’s doing.
Dean startles on his way into the library, figuring he’d fumble around a computer for a few minutes looking up potential hits. It’d probably be easier to just power through whatever insane results google spat back at him, but he doesn’t want anyone at the station catching him, and if he does it at home, he doesn’t want to risk tipping Cas off.
He clears his throat, tugging Cas along as he moves a little closer, wanting to make sure she hears.
Avoiding his gaze, Hester snatches up her flute and launches into a somewhat aggressive rendition of a song Anna used to sing to him when he was a child.
How even when he had his doubts about Dean’s ideas for playing, he went along with it anyway, because he wanted — he wanted to
“I didn’t lie about that,” Cas continues. He stares at his shoes, curling his big toe until the fabric forms an arch. “You see — it was a relief, to me, that I liked it so much, because I thought it meant that I had grown out of it.”
After practice finds Dean crouched a few yards away from the entrance, tucked inconspicuously between a bench and some kind of berry bush as he waits for his little brother to get out of Math Club. For the first time, he wishes he had to walk over and wait at the middle school, but Math Club is a collaboration between Junior and Senior high, so here he is, hiding next to the bushes and praying certain people aren’t still skulking around and won’t notice him even if they are.
“Please don’t feel guilty. I’m aware we’ve been hard to reach. I’m glad you guys got to hang out, although — I’ve missed you as well.”
Dean moans, long and loud and right up against him, and it takes Cas a moment to realize the bed is shaking, has
“Yes. Unfortunately.” She hesitates. “I had hoped to visit with the others, before I left. I’ve met many of them in town, however, staying elsewhere makes it difficult.”
“That — fine, that’s true, but—" Dean looks pained. “I’m not sure I’m the good time you should be having, man.”
“Okay, sure, but — I mean, you usually drink your tea with milk, and you’re doing fine without it, there?”
is more than ready, and Dean fucking him would be a question of Cas scooting back followed by a few seconds of toe-curling fumbling around in the dark before Dean could be sliding in, easy as anything, and a few strokes after that Cas could finally perish in fucked-out ecstasy and if his family was too embarrassed to admit their son and brother actually died from how fucking incredible finally getting his roommate’s dick was, they could just politely tell everyone the virus did him in.
“And I meant it,” Cas says easily, nodding. “And . . . I’d like to be your, um, exclusive platonic boyfriend in the longterm.”
Cas spasms and collapses forward, moaning helplessly as Dean’s hand drags back towards Cas’s body, slicker than it started out.
Claire doesn’t get back on the bed once the nurse has gone, considerably more composed now, but she scoots the chair close, scanning him warily.
but he can’t seem to help himself. He catches himself zoning out in the middle of tasks, thinking of all the ways the long weekend could go horribly wrong, and he’s lost count of how many times he’s fallen into some dismal self-reflection, evaluating how these people he cares deeply for yet hasn’t seen in a long time are going to perceive the him of now.
possible to get tired of this, to somehow become desensitized to the wealth of sensation and pleasure and — and
He thinks it was a very reasonable request, but for some reason, Becky goes quiet, eyes wide, and across the table, Dean buries his face in his hands with a quiet, ‘Oh, my
“Ah — it — we actually suspect that’s part of the problem. The, um. The connections are too tight. I don’t think I’ll be able to get it off without breaking it.”
“Uh. I don’t know, our habits were gettin’ more and more different and, uh, last semester before graduation was gonna be stressful for me, so — I just thought it’d be better to get my own place.”
“Comin’ right up.” The man gets to work, periodically glancing back at Cas. Cas wonders if it would be weird to ask his name, just to flesh out the fantasies he’s going to have later when he’s drunk and falling asleep. “Hey, what’s with the tax accountant getup, anyway? You know what a nightclub is, right?”
“Probably. Be easier in the baths back at the castle, but — you could do it here. It’d be a tight fit, though. Might be better to just—"
“Not — I didn’t do anything weird, I promise, it’s just — he had to, but even though I know he understands, like,
Cas believes that; he does. He’s seen Sam Winchester’s god-awful puppy-dog eyes and he knows that anyone with a human soul is incapable of denying him whatever he desires when it happens.
nice-smelling woods, and he was up all night altering a dress just so he could be be sacrificed to Winchester in the morning.
“But other blankets won’t smell like me,” he finishes, and Cas looks away, shoulders drawing up a little.
, but — the point was just — look, it doesn’t matter. Cas gets it, okay? He can back out whenever he wants, and he’s not, so you guys need to
But the song is done and Cas is laughing and then he’s coming over, insisting Dean come dance with him, and Dean should probably say no, should probably try and get some space from him since apparently he didn’t get enough, yesterday — but he doesn’t.
It doesn’t seem right, leaving him by himself all day. Dean can fix him breakfast in the morning, and dinner when he gets home, but he’s not sure Cas can figure out the kitchen, and watching cartoons on the sofa by himself all day just seems
“Indeed. Still — promise me you’ll do it. And then put it somewhere discreet, under the bed or in the wardrobe or what-have-you.”
his thirteen-year-old niece — as his mother so kindly reminded him — he’s certainly not going to elaborate.
“Last night was bad,” Cas blurts out when he opens the front door, sky barely light over Mills Park, and Dean stiffens on the first step.
“I don’t think that’s going to happen, Charlie. If Dean decides he’s ready for a relationship, he’s going to want it with his soulmate.”
“I don’t know. With his ankle like that, I’m not sure it’s a good idea to be wandering around . . .”
is — Cas might be seventeen, but Dean ain’t. Be different if they both were, but they’re not. What’s more — Cas was a child when he met Dean, Jo. He looks up to Dean. Dean’s his role model and protector, and on some level, Dean knows that.”
“That’s not a bad thing. He wouldn’t do it if he didn’t care.” She pauses. “Or if I hadn’t told him to.”
“I don’t want that many,” he assures Dean, and it’s not even a lie. Cas doesn’t know how many he wants, yet, but however many it turns out to be, he’s certainly not going to behave unreasonably over it. “Just . . . occasionally. That seems — correct.”
“Why are you here?” Cas asks, unable to stop himself. It’s hard, because it makes him think of Dean’s answer the last time he asked him that. Dean had said, then, that he’d
“I mean it. There—" He hesitates. “There’s nothing more important to me than you. If anything interferes with me being there for you, then
Circumstances are not different. They’ve known each other about a week, and in the last eight days, Dean’s had to show the guy how to brush his teeth and bathe. And technically, Cas doesn’t even do the second thing all on his own.
“We — we should hurry, so I can get you in the bath.” He sucks in a breath. “I mean — help you — make sure you get the — the bath you want. Because you want a bath. The bath is for you.”
“I recommend a bath first,” Cas eventually says, dry. Still, he looks puzzled, and if Dean’s not mistaken, that’s a blush starting high on his cheeks.
Dean really doesn’t travel without his dad or the army in tow, and almost never just for shits and giggles. If he starts trying to take off for a week every month, people are going to have some serious questions, never mind what they’ll say if he tries to go
Dean hums against him, gently massaging his cheeks as he plunges his tongue inside of him, and Cas shudders, letting out a choked sound.
Cas’s chest still feels somewhat pinched and uncomfortable, mind drifting into disarray as it turns over the conundrum, but then he’ll catch Dean’s eye or feel a casual touch at his head or hands or a variety of other parts increasingly on the verge of annex by Dean’s domain, and just like that, the muddle will soothe.
“Do they think this will suffice?” she suddenly demands. “That I’ll — shut up, if they fund a few more places like this? Because helping us get back on our feet isn’t the problem; the problem is how we’re getting knocked off in the first place.”
wrong, to treat me the way he did — but you should have known it might not mean anything. While my, um, my ‘hormones and shit’ may have been down, Dean’s were not. Are not. It would be a mistake, if we did mate.”
because I didn’t have experience, and when I called him on it — if you’d just seen his face, Charlie . . .”
Cas doesn’t like that news, that Mr. W is staying on campus just so he can hang around Cas’s teenage niece, but he manages a stiff smile and thanks the woman before setting off in search of this asshole’s classroom.
“Not a full bond,” she corrects him, tone careful in a way that instinctively raises his hackles. “A partial bond. Just like our bodies reject matings that aren’t really wanted, sometimes we accept bonds we didn’t attempt on purpose.”
Which is just unfair; the weekend should have been awesome. Jo had a great birthday, Dean saw Bobby and Ellen and all of his friends, saw
The thing to do now is to accept that, and finally, actually try to make the best of it. Sitting in tense silence with and snapping at Dean is not making the best of it, even if it made him feel better, for a time. At this point, he just needs to let it go. This is . . . it’s his life, now.
And Dean thought things for Cas were hard enough, although that was another thing he (mostly) tried to keep to himself. Cas’s feelings got hurt if you suggested something was wrong, even if the something wasn’t his fault.
The lingering worry in Cas’s eyes fades, expression softening, and Dean quickly leans down, pressing a feather-light kiss to his lips.
(At least his dad didn’t ask what the dangerous situation was; Dean wasn’t kidding when he told Gordon the king was
No, Dean forgets about the cold altogether, Cas’s body heat gradually working its way through the coats, breath mingling hotly between them, and the world narrows down to the moment entirely. Cas’s hands are fucking freezing when they slide up his shirt, but he sighs like he just sank into a hot bath after having to shovel the whole street’s sidewalks and Dean has never been so proud of being a warm-blooded mammal in his
“Couple weeks back, I heard the big teddy bear and the gay redhead teasing him about breaking some poor girl’s heart, and he told them he ‘couldn’t help it’, because he was taken.”
and yet apparently the thought of receiving Cas’s assistance can send him fleeing the room, even though
call during Dean’s drinking binge last week, and even though both times, Dean didn’t answer, maybe Sam’s instincts are just that good.
Cas presses his lips together while Dean clearly considers this for a moment, and he outright scowls when Dean laughs.
“Not since I’ve learned to appreciate nakedness, I haven’t.” Dean wandering around in his boxers because he’s somehow
“Excellent,” Pamela says, smiling. “Still, I think you have a lot you need to talk about. And whatever you’ve said today — I just want to warn you both that you may have to repeat it. Communication is not a one-time deal. As I discussed with Dean, affirmation is a necessary part of a relationship, and
“Of course,” Max says quickly, eagerly tucking the candle alongside the book with a pleased smile. “I’ll go, too.”
Cas has work in the morning, and despite his own reluctance, he insists on staying at Mills Park, encouraging Dean to sleep in rather than coming to breakfast.
“Hm.” She studies him, and then nods to herself. “Well — you’re still settling into a cycle. Don’t be surprised if this one’s pretty mild.”
Abruptly, Dean lets go, and he takes advantage of Cas’s subsequent flailing to push him toward the shower, quickly moving forward to steady him when Cas nearly topples back.
He gives her a wary look. Hester is . . . a pleasant-enough-seeming person, he supposes, but they’ve only just met, and after what Dean said to him last night, he doubts Hester is any more interested in assisting him than he is in having her do so.
“I did.” Nothing follows for a moment, and Dean figures Cas is content to silently ogle, for now. “I didn’t usually read it.”
And tonight, he’s going to let Cas share his bed for the entire night, let Cas sleep beside him, be the one to greet him in the morning, warm beneath the covers.
“Yeah. Yeah, Cas, I got that, except — you don’t even know me. You can’t possibly be okay sharing a bed with me.”
“Wow, Cas, how much did you drink?” he teases, and Cas just smiles back, leaning heavily on the arm of the chair.
“Like, twelve. It was so stupid,” he says, shaking his head. “I think I’d got it in my head that if I learned to cook better, I might could get my Dad to take us with him next time.”
Although maybe he shouldn’t be surprised; it’s probably not unusual for someone to want to fight you after you tell them you don’t want to marry them.
The next day is a little easier. Cas goes for a run earlier, texting Dean a picture of a white snail and a budding cherry tree, though he experiences some anxiety over how many and how often he’s supposed to send them — surely Dean doesn’t want
Dean doesn’t say anything, and after thirty minutes of trying to breathe normally so Cas doesn’t notice anything amiss, he somehow summons enough courage to lean, ever-so-slightly, back into him.
How could he have failed to see? If he was going to end up here, forgotten and abandoned anyway, then he had nothing to fear from the bedding. Nothing anyone would bother trying to take away, just something he could treasure forever, even if he couldn’t have everything else he wanted.
“Yes, well, there are other arrangements one can make, and so long as one isn’t disloyal to their crown, there isn’t any harm in pursuing one’s own interests.” She sniffs. “Besides. Something like this was bound to happen, eventually. Obviously, I needed a backup plan.”
Cas snorts, reaching for one of Dean’s hands and tugging, and Dean obligingly holds it steady for Cas to pull himself up.
“He has Claire to worry about,” Dean reminds her, although the idea of Cas enduring hardship still sits ugly on consideration.
“Maybe she’ll change her mind,” Dean suggested, but Cas knew he didn’t believe it. Dean was always saying how mean Cas’s Mom was, that it wasn’t normal, even though he knew it upset Cas; still, it was nice of him to try.
Cas looks down, fidgeting with a sugar packet, unsure. A long moment passes before he comes to a decision.
Which leaves Dean trying to figure out what’s a genuine response to another setback, and what’s a response calculated to make
“Nice to meet you, Cas. I’m Sam. But, um, I guess you knew that.” He tilts his head. “Dean didn’t mention you.”
“Just – just need a minute,” Dean tells him, breathless, and Cas does his best to nod, still dazed and trembling and absolutely certain he will never, ever masturbate to anything else again.
Cas just settles in against him once more, facing in this time, one leg thrown over Dean’s, and rests his palm on Dean’s chest, cheek against his shoulder.
“Right, but — like I said, you can’t do anything right away —” There’s an odd sort of thump from inside the room, and then a throaty chuckle that sounds like Dean and yet doesn’t, and Sam makes a face and tugs Cas away from the room. “And trust me, it’s
Who spent two months making his life even worse than it was before. And when Dean thinks about what Cas told him, about just how awful and unbearable it must have been, like a living form of torture—
“It was meant to.” Cas pauses. “But — it is one of the things I wanted, that I thought, if you didn’t object — I could have.”
“You sure you don’t want to ride in front, just in case?” Dean asks, holding out a hand for support, and Cas hesitates.
This is why men go to war, he thinks, unnecessarily fluffing the throw pillows on the sofa as he basks in the feeling. Of course, war is terrible and costly, and in the end, everyone loses — but if you
Cas sighs, carelessly shoving back the blanket and waving a hand at the space beside him in clear dismissal.
of him, if Cas asks for too much and Dean can’t ever really give it — if moving to Dean’s parents’ with him may be a huge fucking mistake, and Cas is probably no longer even invited—
That was probably it. Most likely, Cas didn’t want to fucking cuddle on a blanket while watching Lawrence’s mediocre fireworks effort. He’s probably been waiting three weeks for an invitation back to Dean’s for some slightly kinky, extremely charged sex, after which they’d never have to speak to each other again, and tonight he probably decided Dean is just a doofus trying to play the hero in a goddamn Hallmark movie.
“Oh. Uh. Well. This guy slipped in the mud, but I thought he was attacking me, you know — which is a big no-no, by the way. Soft weapons only, no fisticuffs in Moondoor. Anyway, so I fought back, of course, but since he wasn’t really — it kind of . . .” Dean clears his throat. “Anyway, Katya pulled me off of him and Charlie was pissed since she’s real proud of our zero-visits-from-the-police thing. And then at the tavern . . .”
“The world — it’s much more complicated than I gave it credit for.” He shakes his head, gaze dropping to the duvet. “Maybe they’re right to treat me that way. I miss just — being. Without — without the politics, and constantly being told how wrong my life has been, and this — this pressure to get
“Good morning, Dean,” he returns. He feels vexingly shy, after last night’s progress. He knows he’s getting ahead of himself, but when Dean glances up at him, he feels self-conscious, wondering what Dean’s seeing — if he’s seeing something different than he saw yesterday, or a week ago, or a month ago, or whatever.
“So you said. But it’s bullshit that ain’t really your business. Take Cas some tea and come help me with this batch of eyedrops, alright?”
On his knees like this, Dean has to lean up to kiss him, and Cas’s back bows awkwardly as he tries to keep his head in proximity.
it,” he complained, and Cas nodded quickly, although he was so used to kids like that being rude the punch
“Uh. Michael’s been hasslin’ Dad about heirs, so Dad called me in for a talk, and I told him if he didn’t lay off . . . I’d write Michael and tell him Cas and I didn’t, uh, do the do, on our wedding night.”
worried, though. What are you doing nursing a teapot at this hour, anyhow? Shouldn’t you be sleeping off the afterglow?”
“After you, I didn’t resent not having that anymore.” He swallows. “Because I knew I didn’t deserve it.”
“I was just being friendly!” Charlie protests, and Cas absently pats her arm where it’s still tucked around his.
“Not so much. Though he came around, once Claire got old enough to trick-or-treat.” Cas shakes his head. “No — he was in love with Christmas, ever since we were little.”
“He won’t sleep by himself,” Dean mutters. “I tried going into the other room and locking the door, and when I woke up, there he was. I straight-up asked him if he was gonna come sleep with me regardless of where I went, and he just nodded. Nothing weird happens, I swear to God, we don’t even touch — but when I wake up, he’s just — staring at me. Stares at me all the goddamn time, like he’s never seen a person before.”
to be intensifying during their other makeout sessions, he was, in fact, deescalating them — he couldn’t possibly keep it up forever.
“It was easier in Eden, and then it wasn’t. You can’t just run away from this, not — not when you’re leaving so much behind.”
“Stop at the stairs,” he’s reminded, and with that terrifyingly vague instruction, he’s nudged forward, beginning the long walk up to the steps.
So when noon rolls around and Dean still has yet to emerge for his morning oatmeal (even though they’ve had it for few enough days that the taste-enhancing novelty couldn’t possibly have worn off yet), and Cas finds himself staring into the murky amber depths of his fourth cup of tea, distantly wishing for just a single generous splash of fucking milk because he’s sad and pathetic and even breathtaking underhandedness and selfish plotting couldn’t get him what he wanted—
“You don’t do that with friends where there are feelings involved, Cas. It’ll just — you don’t have any experience. Me being your only choice is how we got into this mess. This isn’t about how
“When he left — he, uh. He turned around. To get dressed.” Dean remembers staring, remembers thinking he should say something
And a part of him is hoping that perhaps, when Dean leaves, his brain will finally resolve whatever confusing puzzle it’s currently working through.
you as he worked his mouth along the shaft of your cock and drove you out of your goddamn mind with his wet, clever tongue as he sucked you.
“Oh.” Dean has nothing else to offer on the subject, is mostly focused on navigating away from it before ‘a long time ago’ suddenly becomes relevant and Dean has to think about how that makes him feel.
He fights the strange urge to touch his fingers to that frown, to gently push the corners back to rights.
Anyway, this is the third week they’ve been doing this, Cas is taking him mini-golfing tonight (because tattoos and piercings and a tendency to skirt the lines of substance abuse have made his best buddy no less of an old fogey at heart) and since the selfish bastard was serious about not giving back the Metallica shirt (Dean had surreptitiously rummaged through the drawer he’d originally seen it appear from, only to have Cas materialize behind him and coolly inform him, “Look all you want, Dean, you won’t find it.”) it seems perfectly reasonable to pilfer a t-shirt to wear to work.
“What am I supposed to do with these?” he asks suspiciously, and Dean shifts to his jaw, brushing his mouth against the stubble.
And fine, if Dean’s really being honest — he’s been lonely. There haven’t been any texts here and there throughout the week, and there’s been no one to sit beside, no one to watch as they watch the movie — no one to try his damndest to
“Thank you.” He fixes Dean with a sidelong look as he passes, but moves through without further comment.
There’s only one thing Cas and Kevin could be doing in there, and Dean sure as hell isn’t sticking around to hear any more of it.
“Look, it doesn’t matter, okay? You don’t need to lie anymore, and — hell, we don’t even need to talk about it. What’s done is done, and the important thing—”
It doesn’t matter. Sure, Cas might be a little worried about Claire, if Dean gets serious with someone, but Dean isn’t planning on it, and when things continue on as per usual, it’ll be fine.
Dean makes an approving sound, hands hovering in the air, holding the towel open as he surveys what he’s uncovered, and Cas clears his throat.
He takes the steps two at a time, and when he makes it to his room, Dean is pouring a steaming bucket into one of two tubs, sleeves rolled up to reveal strong, tanned forearms. Cas stares at them for a moment, suddenly realizing he’s about to get to see the rest of Dean’s arms, the rest of Dean’s whole
Asking for the touches is becoming easy, because Dean doesn’t deny him, and even if he did, he promises not to judge him for it. And at an extreme, touches are something Cas can do without, even if he wants them.
Cas crosses his arms, leaning back against the bed and giving the door a hard, suspicious stare. He supposes he’ll just have to let Dean know when he returns from the bathroom, won’t he?
So Dean tilts his head up and gives over to something else instead, something a little bigger and a lot more terrifying, and Cas goes very, very still, his grip on Dean’s face almost painful.
“Alfie is a man with a title and an inheritance waiting for him regardless of what happens here,” Anna says flatly. “Of course he has fun.”
“Gee, thanks, doc. That’s real nice of you.” Although, in hindsight, as much baggage as the two of them had, it
It’s part of the ceremony — which is just stupid, Dean thinks, because the whole bite-thing won’t be happening and everyone knows it — but ceremonies are always weird and pointless and people usually only do them for the food they get afterward.
“I don’t pretend to fully understand, but — enough, at least. I forgive you, Dean,” Cas adds, just to be clear, and Dean slowly nods, shifting.
like sex. It felt like really, really awesome sex, for that matter, the kind of sex that leaves you dumb and dazed and absolutely useless until your body does you a favor and lets you get it up for round two, at which point all lapsed motor function miraculously returns.
Impossibly, Dean thinks he might feel even worse than he did the first time, when the haze of rut had cleared and he woke to an empty bed and panicked so badly he went straight to work and didn’t come back until Cas had already gone to sleep.
“Well, uh, I was thinking about a cup of coffee, and since — well, see, I ran into Kevin on my way up here — I mean, on my way to
“Yeah, right. Seriously, why? S’not like I made it easy on you, but you just — kept on coming, and I — I don’t get it.”
She returns less than a minute later with tankards of beer, which Cas sniffs and then makes a face at.
Sorry for the long wait, there has been more real life nonsense. We’re nearly to the end, here, though! Thank you very much for your patience, and I hope you’re all doing well and staying safe! Please enjoy ♡
Cas’s mouth snaps shut, eyes dark as he watches Dean, subtly rolling back against it, and Dean starts gently thrusting, simply watching him back.
Chapter warnings: sexual content (summary in the notes, scene marked *** at the beginning and end if you’d like to skip it), negative feelings following a sexual experience (not dub-con, just a misunderstanding, details if you’re worried), brief discussion of how libraries may or may not impact profits for authors and booksellers, my mother called me out on this whole ‘best friend’ nonsense happening in both my fics but I swear that’s a coincidence, please let me know if I missed anything, also friendly reminder that opinions voiced in the story are not the author’s or a judgment on differing viewpoints, i.e. I will totally eat biscotti in any state it comes in.
But that would mean when Cas told Dean it was okay if he never became anything more than he was then, Cas
“Sure, but — I mean, Cas is really smart, and he’s always reading books when he’s by himself, so. S’good a reason as any.”
The silence stretches on long after they’re done; Cas is afraid someone will come in, a sense of urgency creeping up on him like the potential student hasn’t, and he wonders why.
Dean chuckling along with him, and the only reason he stops is because Dean finishes coating his fingers and after that-
“It’s annoying, though. Anyway. Fortunately, I don’t have to worry about that, for now.” She pauses. “But why do you?”
“Confused about what?” he tries, hoping that will lead to a clearer answer, and she drops her hands with a huff.
She does convince him to retire the worn leather tie and have it set as a pendant, but even once it’s on a shiny silver chain, she applies no end of pressure to get him to at least put it back in the box.
“Y-yes,” he manages, shifting slightly, and that thumb stutters, briefly pressing down. It’s a struggle not to just close his eyes, to turn into Dean even more, to invite that hand to slip around and stroke his ass instead, Dean murmuring into his ear while Cas helplessly ruts against his hip.
For a long moment, Cas just looks at him, wondering how Dean can be so, so clever, so wonderfully attuned to Cas’s pleasure at times, and yet-
Cas’s hands, before, working in the garden, sure and graceful — but he’s never seen the way they look
Dean wipes the drool off his mouth, wincing on behalf of the throw pillow he ended up on, and goes in search of Cas.
Punishment determined, Dean stomped up the stairs to his and Sam’s room, pulling Cas along after him, and threw himself on the bed with a huff.
Chapter warnings: more problematic, petty thoughts from Dean (details in the notes), some pretty savage opinions about dessert (bear in mind, character opinions are not author opinions; I am a
Cas comes to a stop as they approach, just looking at it, and Dean suddenly feels self-conscious, aware of what it must look like, compared to when Cas left.
bone-town doesn’t mean you have to buy a house there. Also, I hear it’s really pretty this time of Dean.”
Cas obliges, although he’s not especially fond of raw carrots — every time he bites into one, he’s startled — and thinks about her question, about everything else he learned.
But the end of September is not quite two weeks away, and Cas can hardly contain his excitement. Letters are a poor substitute for the real thing, and Dean’s return has never felt so real or so close.
“Love is different from purpose. If that love is also purpose, then no — I can’t take you away from it. But if it’s not, then of course it’s alright. As long as it’s alright with you.”
By the end of the third week, Dean pretty much begs Benny to cry off calling for Senior’s Bingo Night so they can go out drinking (Benny refuses, but agrees to let Dean buy a ticket to play and bring a flask with him). He’s all set to make himself scarce so he doesn’t have to listen to Kevin getting fucked into the mattress or whatever’s going on over there, when Cas corners him.
Anyway, maybe tonight he’ll get to see it, Cas curled up and snoring lightly, hair a wreck against the pillow, chest rising and falling in soft rhythm. It’ll probably be warm, when Dean gets under the blanket, if Cas has already been there for a while.
no, Cas can’t just — reference the one other conversation they had, especially not one about Dean’s nosy window-peeping habits, like it’s an excuse to fucking sit back and watch Dean take off his clothes. And — and then put other ones
“The future’s not set in stone, so I thought I’d better come do my part.” She pulls back a little, studying him with a smile. “Well! Don’t you look good?”
John moved to take another drink, but his hand was unsteady, and the glass slipped right out of it, cracking into pieces when it hit the floor.
Cas’s hand settles on the back of Dean’s neck, bringing him down for a kiss Dean can feel him smiling all the way through, and by the end of it, Dean’s grinning back.
. It’s a look that pulls at something deep within, and Dean wants to feel bad, to take it back, but everything else about Cas right now screams ‘I just got laid,’ but he
There’s silence for a moment, and Dean is just beginning to relax into it when Sam decides he just can’t help himself.
kind of hilarious, since nobody actually got hurt. The alpha kid, Andy, hasn’t really ever lived it down.
and it sounds like he probably wandered to the warehouse by coincidence; which neither solves the mystery of his ignorance or reduces the number of questions Dean still has, but it
Once again, Dean thinks there’s probably a backstory here as horrifying as it is bizarre, and while it’s a little selfish, he’s kind of glad he doesn’t know it.
Dean, of course, didn’t get Cas anything, having assumed they wouldn’t be celebrating — after all, since that talk post-break, Cas hasn’t exactly reiterated that he likes Dean, or why he likes Dean, and he certainly hasn’t used the word
“No. Not gonna happen. What is going to happen, is you tell Michael that you value the treaty and the relationship our countries share, which is so nice that after five years without an heir to bind us, we’re on better terms than ever. You tell him how much you appreciate that. And then you tell him, in no uncertain terms, that that relationship is going to have to continue surviving without an heir, because it’s a long way off.”
In fact, he’s still unconcerned as he hears footsteps approaching the sofa, ready to turn and greet Cas just as soon as he’s done watching the game trailer Charlie linked him to, but before that can even happen, Cas is suddenly

“True,” is all he ends up saying. “I still think you’re just a sadist, but yeah, alright. Challenge accepted.”
Not to mention the first time he’s had an arm loosely slung over him, one broad, warm hand resting against Cas’s bare stomach.
