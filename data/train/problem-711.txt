Sherlock just stares at John open mouthed as he pounds him, mouth open in a perfect “O”, little gasps of pleasure dropping out every so often, the sensations overwhelming. The position means John is fucking him deep, deeper than usual, hitting his prostate on nearly every stroke and Sherlock can already feel his orgasm coiling in his belly, his balls; even his toes are tingling.
hard on John, getting faster and faster as he fucks himself absolutely senseless. They’ve just solved a case, and he’s pumped up with adrenaline and glowing with his own incandescent brilliance, needing everything to be
“John for god’s sake I’m ready, you had me last night and I’ve done enough, please just
“John,
“Oi! Sherlock, you creature, I probably reek” John spluttered, but his expression was fond.
“F-fuck,
“Don’t be ridiculous John. You’re a much better shot than I am” he scoffs, in lieu of saying something romantic in return. John smiles, knowing that’s a close as he’ll get and not minding one bit. “Besides, I can’t really afford to get injured in my line of work, so I decided it was best not to take up playing properly. I’m also liable to keep ridiculous hours and get called off at a moment’s notice. I like rugby, but not as much as ‘The Work’. But I would… very much like to come to your training session with you”.
“Because Sherlock, I’m fairly certain it’s quite difficult to run around let alone concentrate with a raging hard-on.”
John practically throws himself onto the bed and kisses Sherlock desperately.
“God I love you, you insufferable prick” John murmured as he cut Sherlock off with a kiss, sliding his tongue directly into his open mouth.
Sherlock was moaning nearly continuously now, and grabbing at John’s arse to pull him more firmly against him whilst rocking his own hips up, desperately seeking friction. John pulled slightly away from his mouth to take that delectable bottom lip between his teeth, biting down just enough so that Sherlock was whimpering. God, John loved him like this, so needy and sensual. He was utterly breath-taking. John brought one hand from the back of the chair to cup Sherlock’s head, feeling his silky curls slip between his fingers, leaning forward once more to curl his tongue around Sherlock’s. They kissed frantically for a few more minutes before Sherlock dragged his mouth away, placing a hand on John’s chest –
Sherlock’s lip quirks, amused. The statement makes no sense, as John isn’t offering him anything that would constitute it being a deal, apart from a cessation in his nagging. Although he supposes that is a fairly good trade, all things considered. John can be nothing short of belligerent when he wants to be. Besides, he likes doing what John wants, not that he would
, more than anything.
“What?” John drops his hand.
Sherlock moans and grasps at his own legs, and John thrusts his entire length home in a single push.
“Oh, fuck!” Sherlock throws his head back on the pillow, squeezing his eyes shut.
and he feels him give a little, just enough for John to feel the softness of him just inside, and he can’t stop himself moaning. He switches to firm, fast licks directly over his hole, and Sherlock cries out in ecstasy. The feeling of him is exquisite and obscene and John can’t get enough. Sherlock is quivering from head to toe and has brought one hand back, first to tangle in John’s hair, and then to grab his own arse, to hold himself further open for John. John can see his thighs twitching where they’re held in place by the shorts and he knows he wants nothing more than to spread his legs properly, but something about the way he is constrained is insanely hot. Now that Sherlock is holding himself on one side, John takes advantage of his free hand and lets it run down Sherlock’s left leg, starting at the top and working all the way down until he meets the socks and
“Oh fuck, John-“  Sherlock wriggles around in John’s embrace desperately ‘til he’s facing him and captures his mouth in a frantic kiss, large hands on either side of John’s face.
“Fuck, I’m so full,
“You better have a bloody good reason for stopping John Watson” Sherlock growls, voice muffled, and John looks up to see his face is completely buried in the crook of his elbow where he’s collapsed against the wall.
Sherlock stretches out luxuriously and crosses one ankle over the other, somehow managing to look imperious whilst covered from navel to chin in drying come, wearing nothing but a pair of old rugby socks.
Sherlock groaned and dragged a hand down John’s bare chest, nails scratching at his sweat and mud-streaked skin, loving the feel of the crisp curls of his sparse chest hair.
“Now John, uhhhn, please, I’m ready, fuck me…” As he spoke he grabbed the lube bottle with trembling fingers, poured some into his hand and hurriedly slathered it all over John’s cock.
When Sherlock next opens his eyes, he realises he is lying like a dead-weight on top of John, panting wildly into the pillow. He can feel John’s pounding heartbeat next to his own. Reluctantly, he pulls off with a wince, feeling John’s come running out of him and down the inside of his thighs. He shivers, loving the feeling of it although he knows it will be uncomfortable in a few minutes when it starts to dry. Worth it. He collapses next to John, who instantly gathers him into his arms, tucking his curly head down against his chest, which is rising and falling with rapid breaths.
John grasps Sherlock’s thighs as he pistons his powerful hips, and Sherlock runs his hands reverently over his forearms before gripping his hands tightly. John turns his head to the side and bites down gently on the inside of Sherlock’s knee, the sock slightly damp with his sweat and he hears Sherlock’s breath catch. He looks up to see Sherlock gazing at him with a desperate look in his eyes.
John feels a surge of arousal hit him in the gut at Sherlock’s words; at the fact that his partner’s normally ice-cool composure is shattered and he can’t seem to stop cursing. He knew Sherlock liked his –
John looks skywards and mutters something under his breath. Silent plea for strength perhaps.
John begins to fuck him with hard, long strokes which push him back and forth on the bed, head moving up and down on the pillow. Sherlock’s knees are up by his collarbones and his calves are on John’s shoulders, and as he thrusts John turns his head to brush his cheek against the socks, first one side and then the other, and he groans delightedly.
“Are you going to eat?”
John just rolls his eyes and swats his head playfully before pulling him in tighter and placing a kiss on the top of his sweaty curls, and Sherlock tucks his face into John's side, unable to keep himself from smiling.
“Oh”.
“Oh Sherlock…” John looks at him fondly, chuckling.  “I appreciate the sentiment, really. You are an all-consuming whirlwind, who also happens to be better than me at everything, and sometimes I do need space to remind myself that there is a world outside our bubble. But, there is no part of my life I don’t want you in”. He shakes his head and adds softly: “Idiot”.
John exhales deliberately, blowing his hot breath directly over where Sherlock is most sensitive, and he knows he can feel it through his shorts. Finally, he takes hold of the waistband and peels off the undershorts, dragging them halfway down Sherlock’s thighs where they stay due to the elastic, trapping Sherlock’s legs close together. John’s mouth is watering, and he reaches a hand down to adjust his aching cock, which he’d been mostly unaware of until now but he is suddenly, painfully hard, and he’s still in his work clothes for fuck’s sake.
with those socks, and completely and utterly fuckable.
Sherlock sits up and swings his legs down to the floor, bare toes flexing. “On the contrary, I actually quite enjoy rugby. It features a combination of tactical skill and out-and-out aggression that you find in few other sports; the opportunities for besting people one-on-one whilst still working as part of a larger team are plentiful, and it also requires being able being able to read people. I’m surprised that you are surprised in fact”. He flips a hand elegantly.
“Evening” John calls out as he stumbles through the door of 221B. He dumps the bag of shopping on the side before flicking the kettle on, chucking a tea bag in a mug and going over to his armchair to collapse and wait for the water to boil. He tips his head back, eyes closed, allowing the tension of the working day to drain away. Sherlock isn’t in the lounge or kitchen but his coat is hanging up so he must be in. He very rarely goes anywhere without it.
John opens one eye blearily and looks over his shoulder to where Sherlock’s voice is coming from, by the door to the hall, and his mouth goes dry. He’s suddenly wide awake.
“To get us something to clean up with. Sherlock, you are absolutely covered in come. I mean, you look incredible” John reaches a hand down and sweeps a finger through the come on Sherlock’s throat, before lifting it to his mouth and sucking, eyelashes fluttering. Sherlock’s breath catches and his eyes darken. “But that is going to start feeling really uncomfortable very soon. Besides, if I don’t get up now I’ll never move again”.
“I know you could come like this love, but that’s not what I want tonight. Do you know what I want?” He licks the back of Sherlock’s neck above the collar of the shirt, tasting salt, and bites down gently.
The sight that greets John when he enters the bedroom a few minutes later, having hastily shoved the shopping into the fridge, nearly makes him come on the spot.
“I’m not even going to ask how you know that, you mad genius. But yes, we were having a full contact run through at the end and I gave him an almighty hand-off and he went down on his arse like a ton of bricks. Felt incredible. I scored from it as well”.
John says nothing, just runs his hands over Sherlock’s bare arse before spreading him open slowly  and licking a hot, wet stripe from bottom to top. Sherlock makes a sound like “uhhk” and John knows he’s got his fist shoved in his mouth to stop himself crying out, and the thought of it sets John on fire. He gathers as much saliva into his mouth as possible and licks the same stripe again, and again, not focusing on any particular area, just getting Sherlock wet everywhere, feeling his hole fluttering under his tongue but not allowing himself to focus there just yet. He can feel his end-of-the-day stubble brushing against the delicate skin of Sherlock’s arse, and he rubs his face back and forth, roughing him up just a little and Sherlock gasps with delight. A few more passes with his tongue and he can feel him rocking back against him, pushing his arse against his face almost unconsciously, and he’s moaning, low and continuous.
“Down in a moment, John”.
John clears his throat, but his voice still comes out slightly hoarse.
John presses at Sherlock’s left hip and spins him round, and he instinctively braces himself against the wall, back arching. John groans loudly, petting desperately at every part of Sherlock he can reach, rubbing his hands up and down his flanks. He runs both his hands down his back and cups his arse-cheeks, pushing up underneath the top shorts and running his hands over the silky lycra, slipping one hand down between Sherlock’s legs where he can feel the damp heat of him bleeding through the thin fabric.
Sherlock pulls back, affronted. “Why? These are perfectly functional.”
“Mmmphh-" Sherlock’s hands came up to grasp at John as he responded to the kiss, one going around the back of his head to tangle in his short, sweat-damp hair, the other clutching at the front of his shirt. After several moments, John pulled back, panting softly as he leant his forehead against Sherlock’s. He was still smiling, and Sherlock couldn’t help but return it. He licked his shining lips, and released John’s hair as he straightened up, slipping his hand down instead to hold John’s hip as he stood above him. He shivered, relishing the unusual disparity in their heights, and dropped his gaze to the front of John’s rugby shorts, where he could see that he was sporting the beginnings of an erection. He licked his lips again, greedily. God he loved those shorts. John smirked down at Sherlock, revelling in the way his breath was quickening, almost imperceptibly. Almost. But not to John.
“Jesus Sherlock, you’re so gorgeous like this, are you going to come like that? I’m so close, you’re getting me close,”
“Stop being so melodramatic John, I ate yesterday morning. I have to go to the morgue today and I don’t want my brainwork impaired. Plus you know I’ll eat some of your porridge tomorrow morning”.
. John has no idea why the feeling of it is so arousing but it sends a bolt of lust straight to his gut and he moans against Sherlock’s arse, running his hand up and down and round Sherlock’s ankle as he continues to lick him steadily. He knows that he could make Sherlock come like this, potentially without even touching him, but he suddenly knows what he wants, no,
And John did, the power of Sherlock’s words and his look enough to make him curl in on himself, gripping Sherlock’s hips hard enough to bruise as he emptied himself into his body in powerful, thumping pulses, growling as he did so, feeling the hot swoop of his orgasm from the tip of his head to his toes.
“God, John, I’m close- I, Oh yes right there, oh GOD-“ As John thrust harder into him, sensing his (and his own) impending orgasm, Sherlock finally began to touch himself, his thumb and index finger forming a ring that he jerked quickly over the head of his leaking cock, whining now.
John growled and in one motion stripped his dirty jersey off over his head and threw it across the room, before gripping Sherlock’s chin with one hand and kissing him thoroughly.
“Yes John, I’ll go to your training session”.
“Fuck,
Sherlock flushes harder, properly pink now. It’s quite charming. He clears his throat, not particularly good at the sentiment bit yet, even now.
Sherlock chuckled, just a low rumble that barely left his chest. John’s delight was infectious. “Excellent. He seemed like an arrogant arse at the last game I attended. Seeing as you won’t let me tell everyone he’s cheating on his wife with the physio, I suppose this will have to do.”
He collapsed forward onto Sherlock, feeling his legs slip from either side of his waist and just hang off the edge of table, one arm coming up to stroke soothingly over his heaving back. He felt his softening cock slip out of Sherlock and a rush of warm come with it, and he felt an aftershock shudder through him as he thought about it dribbling down the crack of Sherlock’s arse, all over the table, onto the floor. He felt Sherlock shiver and moan weakly at the sensation too, his prick giving a small twitch against John’s stomach.
“Any chance of you delivering it to me here in bed?”
*****
“Fine.”
“Fuck, John, I-“ He sounded wrecked. His eyes were squeezed shut as he shook his head, curls bobbing. “I- How do you do this to me? I, please, I need you…”
Sherlock pretends to think for a moment, before shrugging. “No”.
John smiles. “Well. I mean, that’s exactly how I feel about it, although you’ve said it better than I could. But, if you like it so much, why don’t you play?”
” With a long drawn out cry Sherlock came, pulsing long hot streaks all over his t-shirt, one even landing on the exposed skin of his clavicle. At the sight of Sherlock’s perfect pink mouth open in a cry, the feel of his body clenching rhythmically, powerfully around his cock, the sight of his come spattering all over his heaving chest, John suddenly found himself right at the edge of release as well.
John knows that image will be burned into his memory until the day he dies. With a final surge of energy, he briefly leans down until he can reach Sherlock’s face, compressing him just a tiny bit further, and licks the detective’s come off his own lips. The taste of Sherlock’s release, and the thought of it, sends him hurtling into his own orgasm. Struck with a sudden urge, he pulls out just as he starts to come, Sherlock’s left leg slipping from his shoulder. He still clings to his right leg, pressing his socked calf to his cheek, and with his other hand he fists himself through his orgasm, coming all over Sherlock’s stomach and chest, groaning softly.
John immediately turned around in Sherlock's arms to look at him. The kiss was a hard press of lips without any finesse.
Thank you sooo much for your comments and kudos, they kept us motivated through the year of writing together.
John was too stunned by Sarah’s passionate speech to say anything.
Sherlock must have heard his anxiety in his voice because he straighten and smirked “You should be more confident in your capability to convince me. Yes John, I will come. You clearly would be lost without me.”
“From zero to two in a year. Quite impressive, Doctor.”
“Look, Mr... Sherlock. I'm sorry. I really am.”
Sherlock adjusted his arm so he could ruffle one hand through Leanna’s hair. “John and Sarah haven’t picked a name yet. They will, once baby number two is born.”
Mrs. Hudson brought them both a cup of hot chocolate and sat down with them. She looked tired as well, but smiled at them with her always present cheerfulness. Sherlock was so grateful for her. She was part of their pack, kind and caring, the motherly figure they all needed. “I would like to go back to Baker Street, if it’s possible. I miss my flat.”
“Pass me my phone” he grumbled. He didn't need any distraction now.
He hurried to the shower, not wanting to continue the thought with his sleeping child in the same room. Still, he stayed quiet as he touched himself under the warm spray, John's light snoring coming from the main bedroom. John. His John, who had forgiven his lie, who made him smile. His clever, handsome, strong John. His protector.
“Good. That's good. I was worried.”
The detective froze. “Yes?”, he yelped, trying not to sound breathless or guilty.
The going back to Baker Street was a nightmare, the traffic was stacked and his cabbie not very competent. John smiled thinking at what Sherlock’s few and scornful words would have been if he had come. He understood Sherlock’s choice to stay at Baker Street, watching their little girl go from the train station had been very painful. Their. John couldn’t help smiling when thinking Leanna was theirs.
John felt like he was going crazy. His feelings were all over the place, he didn’t know what to feel anymore. Sherlock had entered in some sort of manic detective frenzy. He was cold and detached and utterly focused on the case. John knew it was for Sarah’s and the babies benefit but while he was torn between anger and worry, it was hard to see his mate so…without feeling.
“John. John, what is wrong?”
“I hear you Karen, but Sarah and I have no intention of marrying. We are not in love with each other but I care for her. I am not abandoning anyone.” John answered with a cold anger and went to Sherlock in Sarah’s office.
“Sherlock, come with us!” He was using a bit of his alpha voice but Sherlock was strong willed for a beta, John didn’t think it would do any difference.
“What?” John felt like he was being particularly dumb repeating himself, “You’re making no sense.”
Ten minutes later he was fucking himself with four lube slicked fingers, refusing to touch his erection. This was about sex with John, not masturbation.
“Oh my god! I am sorry!”
John’s jaw dropped. He hadn’t known Mycroft cared about their relationship enough to do this for John.
Everyone was laughing, even Papa. He stayed very close to Daddy, which was good. She liked to see them close, it meant they could stay a family. Papa wasn’t close to Mother and they left.
“Papa kiss John!!! Papa loves John!” The little girl squeaked.
And why had he been so quick to trust them? Help them? He was concerned but he could have given them an association name, but no, he had wanted to be the one offering protection, a home. His inner alpha had taken control there, to protect.
She had obviously failed, she thought she had Sherlock firmly in her hand but it didn’t seem like she would be able to take control of the situation as easily as she had first thought. She would have to think and plot something.
“You haven't seen your child in four months, Janine. And the only thing you care about is your reputation? You are more stupid than I could have ever imagined.”
“She is sleeping, won’t wake up if you don’t make a sound” and John engulfed two of Sherlock’s finger in his mouth and sucked like he meant it.
“Breath love, breath. Remember to tell me if you need to take a break or to stop.”
“Show off!” But Sherlock mouth travel to more interesting area and John put the cushion on his face to muffled his moans. And as promised, Sherlock quickly and efficiently brought him off, his mind completed blanked by the powerful orgasm that was rolling inside him.
And there was Leanna… this little girl was really sharp and cute. She was sometimes still a little wary of him, but he loved to walk around with her. Yesterday, he had surprised himself, watching Sherlock and his daughter performing a “taste test” with sweets, with a smile so wide it almost hurt. When he had told Sherlock later he had a sweet tooth, Sherlock had responded, looking shocked at the implication “It wasn’t indulging our sweet tooth John, it was Science”. Yeah, yeah, Science indeed, he would laugh again if his sister’s absence wasn’t really worrying now, she should have been here 15 minutes ago…
The kitchen was an absolute mess when John came home and Sherlock brought himself to help him clean in while Leanna sat on the sofa with some of her favourite books next to her. She looked at each of them intensely, before picking up the next. By the time she was finished, John had dinner ready. Pasta again, just because the little one loved it and John wasn't a particularly good cook, except for the thing with the peas.
Of course she has. She has probably read all the articles about his family, his relationship.
“Sherlock. Sherlock, love, I....” John closed his eyes for a second, taking a deep breath. “I want you to make love to me.” Sherlock felt John huff at his own nervousness. “Tonight, I want us to... want you to... have me.”
John trusted his hips involuntarily, his head falling down, as he buried his face in Sherlock's neck. “God, Sherlock. I want that to. I want to be inside of you. But... but please, love, let's take this slow. How about we just go on snogging and see where it takes us?”
John raised an eyebrow. “Never is with you, I know.”
“Papa, you have fever? Your face is red,” John heard Leanna say and smiled. Sherlock really liked being complimented, even if he tried not to show it. John knew better.
“Mrs Hudson! Do you see John?” He asked violently, apparently trying not to shake her but clearly on the verge of failing.
“Why did they want to know all that, Papa?” Leanna looked up at him.
“John?” The little voice of Leanna startled him, “Look, I make a new draw!”
John left the restaurant, promising Angelo they would come and eat at his restaurant with the kids later that week.
Sherlock turned away from him. That cruel face wouldn't be the last thing his eyes would see. He looked into London, now red and golden in the early morning light.
“No it wasn’t.”
Leaving the forest, in a net to fall,
His knees hurt a little when he got up, but he would never admit that in front of John and he hugged his eldest daughter as well.
John looked at the card and smiled, the party was in few weeks, august the 21st,
“I already am in bed, Papa.” Leanna sounded like she wanted to put a “stupid” in front of the word Papa and he smiled at that, as his driver cursed at another car.
He was annoyed. The evening had started so perfectly and they had ended it staring at the white wall in some hospital hallway. What a drag.
“John… You… For me…” the detective moaned, obviously having lots of difficulties to form a coherent sentence under John assault. He didn’t know if it was because the tall man had difficulties processing what John had done and why or if it was because of what John was doing to him with his tongue, his teeth, his hands… Didn't care, all that matter now was feeling Sherlock’s living body!
He played, trying hard not to pour all his feelings, all his confusion into the music, until he felt Leanna hugging his leg.
“Understood. We'll get in contact.”
Mummy sent a car to pick him up at London Heathrow and he arrived home two hours later, the afternoon sun covered by clouds. They had a party planned for tomorrow, with everyone important invited,. Janine had talked about nothing but the party for weeks, as Sherlock pretended to listen.
Sherlock got to his feet and around the table and John sank into his embrace almost automatically. He could feel the doctor shiver in anger, his fist clenched.
It was… a molecule? No several… A chemical formula? Wait… he knew those! It was the chemical equation for serotonin, dopamine and… yes acetylcholine! What did it mean?
“I'll bring it up as soon as it's finished.”
“On my back, I want to see you, know it’s you, JOHN!”
“JOHN!” Sherlock yelled, a little worried.
“Yes. Yes, Sherlock.”
“Yes John. Go.”
Sherlock took his daughter from Molly and hugged her tight, whispering into her hair how much he loved her, how clever and beautiful she was.
“Yes! Yes, John!” Sherlock was more and more weak at the knees, and John finally took pity and nearly carried him to the bed.
Carefully, Sherlock guided John's hand to his mouth to press a kiss to it, suddenly needing the warm skin and alpha smell closer. He could live with this, but what if he wasn't able to keep this from Leanna? She had a right to see her grandmother, on the other hand that grandmother would stop at nothing to keep the heir of the Holmes family close and possibly away from her rebellious son. She would want to try to manipulate her…
“Okay…You look good too you know…” But John got up suddenly after looking at his phone. “Excuse me Harry, I will be right back”
Oh well, it was too late to take it backt now. His feelings had been overflowing and he had had to ask.
John’s clothes disappeared, who needed clothes? John reached Sherlock in the centre of the pool. The water’s temperature was perfect and not very deep but he didn’t care, all his attention focused on the man. He didn’t question why he was here, didn’t want to talk. At. All. Sherlock was handsome, John watched the water falling from his curls with rapturous eyes, he could almost taste it.
It took a while before he could breathe again. He washed his hand, then his hair. The flat was still silent, when he stepped out of the shower cubicle. Drying himself off, he knew this had to stop. He couldn't continue like this. Not knowing wasn't an option any more.
Moran! John will kill him later! Now though, the threat was in front of him and there was only one acceptable solution to protect his mate.
“That's why you became a doctor and a solider.”
John took their members in his hands and imposed a faster movement, to bring them to climax. The soldier couldn’t concentrate enough to kiss properly Sherlock, so he licked this long neck, took those lovely sage, mint and ashes scents, soo much more potent now! Sherlock was moaning and grunting shamelessly and suddenly he jerked and came violently against him. It was all he needed to let go himself and lose all control.
“What...?” John looked confused.
John started by kissing Sherlock’s neck and slowly he went south. Kissing, licking. Sherlock was making promising little noises from the ministrations.
Well, he may have under evaluated Sherlock’s knowledge about sex if he knew that! But John was too occupied by what Sherlock was doing to him to think further.
Jim was giving something to Sherlock, Why was Sherlock taking it! It was obvious this… pill? was dangerous. What dangerous game his mate was playing? He had to…
After failing to convince Holmes about his secret identities (that had been fun as well), this was the second battle lost. Jim wouldn't fail a third time and he was willing to play dirty. A man who could make a society cry out for A/A O/O equality (even if it was by accident) could make an elite Alpha fall.
See the ends notes, for more information about what will happen next…
John wanted to quickly take Sherlock’s erection in his hand to bring him over the edge, but as soon as he touched him, Sherlock went off like a geyser. Watching Sherlock orgasm under him was all he needed to lose himself in his own pleasure, wave after wave until he was boneless.
“You see him, you can actually see him. It’s not John from my mind palace. John is actually here. John is not dead. John!”
It’s been a little more than a month since John discovered that Sherlock was an alpha. He had been quite successful in repressing his unspeakable feelings. Sherlock, Leanna and he had a good and normal relationship. Sherlock was his best friend, Leanna was like his godchild. They were communicating… like before, Sherlock had taken some other case and asked him to come.
“Hmm, I admit I like the prospect… but later… I spent too much time organising this night, we are going!”
“Oh, hmm, no, just, it’s very hot!”
Suddenly, like a genie being summoned, Sherlock appeared in front of the door, his hair were a disaster, he had bags under his eyes.
John had been imprisoned for more than 5 hours. He wasn’t even mad anymore. The Garridebs hadn’t done anything to him. John wondered if they had forgotten him in this closet. He had tried shouting to no avail, and he was just incredibly bored now.
“Drawing, little mouse,” John automatically corrected, “It’s beautiful… you should show it to your father!”
“John have a kid?” Leanna looked surprised. They hadn't talked about the pregnancy with her yet, Sherlock wasn't sure how to bring up the topic. Well, now was as good as any moment. John seemed to think the same.
His little lioness slept through the ride, only waking up when they had to change trains. An old woman cooed over the little girl, as they were waiting on the platform. Lost her husband, no children, former teacher, not a threat.
“I know you’re the father of Sarah’s baby. I am not stupid you know, it wasn’t so hard to deduce. I have a nose you know and I distinctly recognised your scent on Sarah’s. You got her pregnant, you should marry her! I can’t understand how you can abandon her to stay in an unnatural relationship with another alpha! It’s shameful! Nothing good can come from it! But you’re a good doctor and a nice alpha. I am sure you will make the right choice in the end.”
With that, the call was ended.
After 10 minutes he began to wonder why the fuck he had thought walking home was such a good idea. His leg was killing him! His fault, again! He had left his cane in his office. His ridiculous ego just wouldn’t accept he needed it at work… And now it was too late to catch a cab, never had been lucky with them anyway. If he wasn’t so tired he would laugh, or cry, he didn’t really know anymore.
“And the alpha part? How did you know? I am not tall for an alpha”
They looked at each other awkwardly. This was hard for them, showing appreciation for each other, even if they did.
“Hi Sarah, how are you? Just saw you tried to call me?”
The thought hurt. They were great, as partners, as parents. This wouldn't end, not because of a stupid a veterinarian with a scalpel. Still, Sherlock was to stubborn to just give in now. He wasn’t wrong in his admonishment… John had to see that…
“Spoil sport!” John bit at Sherlock’s eas in retaliation and laughed heartily when the man yelped.
Sherlock felt himself nodding and John smiled at him, before turning away with Leanna still in his arms. He could hear the two of them talking and then Mrs. Hudson's voice downstairs. He couldn't move.
It seemed like he had found the magic word, Sarah became more compliant and finally accepted to enter the ambulance.
“I hope I haven’t broken you, not a complete sentence yet.” John tried to joke, feeling more and more exposed and worried about the man’s reaction. After all, the detective could still not want a relationship with him. Simple John.
Sherlock closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He was an alpha. He was the one to decide everything concerning his daughter, even if the omega was primarily the care taker. And he as an alpha couldn't let Janine treat Leanna like this, not anymore. He knew his parents wouldn't let him divorce his wife, they wouldn't let him leave. There was no other way. He could do this!
Sherlock crashed his mouth to John's, hands at the side of his flatmate's neck. He tasted of John and tooth paste and home.
There had been more platonic touch between them lately and he had to admit he craved them.
John was still asleep in front of the fireplace, as the sun slowly set outside, a few snowflakes falling from the sky as London attempted winter. John looked young in his sleep, almost innocent and no one would have expected that this ordinary looking blond had just fucked another alpha into the mattress. God, Sherlock could still feel him inside, thick and hot, moving slow and fast and dragging his perfect cock over Sherlock's prostate over and over again. It had felt like an invasion at first and Sherlock had wanted him out, just out so he could flip them over to instead shove himself inside John, show him who the alpha was. But his wonderful John had given him all the time he had needed to adjust, lulled Sherlock's inner alpha and his need to dominate to sleep with kisses and whispered confessions of love. Sherlock had melted like butter under him, accepting him into his body slowly.
“Oh, sorry. It's... I've been there, but there was a … another patient. Knife to the chest or something. Quite busy. Me, it's just a cut, could you...?”
Sherlock blurted out Sarah's name. “No, she's not in heat. She's on suppressants. She's divorced and focused on her career. Of course she's on suppressants.”
“John” Sherlock’s eyes were incredibly soft, “Of course I love you. And obviously I already love your children too… They are so… you and fascinating! They remind me of Leanna when she was a baby… I couldn’t take care and observe her as much I wanted then, I always regretted that… I want you to enjoy every moment, John, and I want to be with you along the way…”
He ignored them, shielded Leanna’s face with the flowers. He went inside as fast as he could, and sighed in relief, when the elevator doors closed behind them.
Leanna looked up at Sherlock.
“John is currently not sexually interested in anyone.”
There won't be a chapter next week. Christmas is a busy time, as you know.
She brushed his hand off, looking up at him with hazel eyes. “No. Just gave me some money and the package. Handsome fellow in a suit, but he had a strange aura. Not that you care about things like that.”
Three years later, her book on breaking bonds was published and it played a huge part in the omega movement, as it told them a lot of information on how they could break free of their Alphas. Sherlock was proud to find his thesis in there. Irene had proven that the willingness of the Alpha to let go, as well as emotional and territorial separation had an influence on the pain the omega had to suffer during the removal on the bond mark.
Sherlock took some times to look at him and with an assured voice answered, “Of course John.”
“We already have our little family and I'm so happy, Sherlock. So happy because Leanna and you are in my life. I wouldn't change it for the world.”
That's when Sherlock noticed it, the lack of Sarah's scent on John. There was still citron on him, which was unavoidable after almost three days of constant sex, but it was too weak for them to be bonded.
“Oh. Oh, you wonderful man!”

“And I care. I care about Sarah and the babies. I just… I need to be level headed to be able to deduce correctly. Sentiments, sentiments tend to blur the facts, we can’t afford to be biased or Moriarty will win.”
“John, please stay calm, you’re making me anxious!” scolded the young omega.
“Candlelit dinner on Christmas Eve. Very romantic.” Angelo smiled and placed the bottle  between them on the table. “I’ll make some panna cotta for your dessert.”
Sarah had a little laugh, “Well, John was not exaggerating I see… Maybe you could tell us what you deduce about me?”
“If you ask nicely, I am sure Molly will play with you. And my sister Harry and her mate Clare will be there. She is your... aunt now, I guess.” John, no Daddy said with a smile.
“Wait. Is there anything you can tell me about him? Did he say anything else?”
He could feel the smile against his neck, but he knew it didn't reach John's eyes. “Thanks for the comfort, love.”
“Daddy!!! You think Papa will be happy?”
“You are not telling me what to do. I'm not a little omega wife that you can order around. I have been a detective for my whole adult life and I've been doing very well! Even before I met you! Just because I am letting you fuck me doesn't mean you are my boss or my nanny or my fucking alpha, John Watson. I certainly won’t ask your permission to do anything!”
“Yes, love. I know. No more kisses and…other things…while Leanna is asleep next to us.”
“Not in front of Leanna. I'm sure Mrs. Hudson wouldn't mind, but this isn't appropriate for a child.” The song ended and they parted, John looking after the biscuits again, Sherlock kissing Leanna's forehead before making his way to the bathroom.
“Sherlock?” A question, a plea  , just to do or say something “Who?”
“ Sherlock, would you marry me?”
“No! And you shouldn’t let it bother you either! It’s no longer punished by law. And I don’t think it’s abnormal. Not usual, but whatever…You should go home, talk to Sherlock. Don’t wait too long, he must be worried…”
“I must say, you almost tricked me with Berlin. Quite clever. My assistant has kept an eye on you for the last four weeks. She checked Dr Watson's background, a good choice of companion.”
“They’re very eighties – probably one of those retro designs and they’re quite big, so a man’s.
“No.”
In the morning, after a night without sleep, Sherlock woke up Leanna and they had breakfast in silence. Before John's alarm clock went off, Sherlock got her dressed and brought her downstairs to Mrs. Hudson. Then, Sherlock fled to Barts again.
Leanna thought about it, “Okay, you are the nurse and Molly is the very sick patient!”
They spent the next two and a half years like this, living separate lives. He spent Janine's heats with her, but she didn't get pregnant a second time. Sherlock didn't want another child with her, but he knew his parents expected them to have at least one more. There had to be an alpha heir and no one knew Leanna's second gender yet. But there was time for; they were not even thirty yet.
It was… the apocalypse. All the furniture was all over the place. The table was broken as if it had been thrown against the wall. What the hell had happened? Who could have ransacked the place? Why? The Garrideb had no reason to...
Janine looked up at him and Sherlock was convinced he had seen sadness on her face for a second. “This is the most we talked in five years, Sherlock.” She put her purse next to the sofa, walking towards him and for a second he feared she would try to hug him.
“Sherlock! Sherlock ! Wake up!”
A week after Leanna’s birthday Sherlock woke up to the sound of crayons against paper. He opened her eyes to find his daughter sitting on the bed with a stack of paper on her lap. She looked adorable with her face all scrunched up in concentration. She looked a little bit like John, tongue stuck out as she drew what turned out to be stick figures.
He lifted her up, carrying her down the stairs and to the garage, not stopping once. She had buried her face in his neck, pressing her lips together hard to not make a sound. He was so proud of her.
“I love you, John.”
Leanna felt a blush warming her cheeks and tried to hide behind her daddy’s leg. She could guess John wanted them to get along, and it made her shyer.
With that, John pulled the trigger.
“Yeah. it would be good to know you are in the same building at least.”
“You are very kind to the man who is trying to help you.” God, how Sherlock hated that sour expression.
“John, I...” Sherlock didn't finish the sentence, he didn't know why. Had he lost John by being too eager? Had he missed signs of distress?
“You will stop this, immediately.” John's voice had turned harsh, allowed no objection.
Sherlock shyly smiled, “Twins… I like the thought of two more Watson in this world.”
“We already asked her, little lioness. And she said she'll be happy to come.”
“Janine. My wife. She is responsible for this, for Sarah's heat. She threatened to hurt you, if I didn't come back. I wanted to be gone by the time you came back with your Omega. But you are not... you're not bonded... You love me.”
“An amateur writer. He can't decide whether to sound professional or provoking, if he is writing for a tabloid or broadsheet. No education in writing. He attempts to influence his readers, not to give objective information.”
“She meant the whore that has perverted a good alpha from one of the oldest and most respected noble families we have in England!” Roger sneered, an ugly satisfied smile on his face.
“No signs before that?” It what obvious that his older brother didn't want to talk about it.
“Well… Not good obviously… Sherlock doesn’t think of anything else than Moriarty and finding Sarah. He will succeed. But you’re still wearing your coat, do you want to take it off and have a cup of tea? Something warm, with honey?”
“Go lay on the bed on your front. I am going to fetch what I need, try to be a good boy and wait for me!”
“Oh, hello. Where were you? At Barts? I tried to call you.” John got up. Sherlock could see in his closed and stiff gait that he was…angry or at least annoyed by it. They met in the middle of the living room for a kiss, John's arms encircling him. That's when Sherlock flinched back because John's hand was putting pressure on the wound.
“Yes…Yes, thank you Sherlock.” John tenderly caressed Sherlock cheeks; let his finger discover once more Sherlock unusual and beautiful face. He hadn’t felt him, seen him for too long. “I missed  you Sherlock. So much…”
“How are you, Sherlock?” he whispered, his hands softly caressing Sherlock’s cheeks.
The doctor, ex-soldier, whatever he was just didn’t know how to use his vocal cords anymore. He was pretty sure he looked stupid, the mouth open, but right now he just didn’t care! Oh my god, what was that! Sherlock looked like a professional model, so handsome and with a strong aura of alpha around him… He had gone from pleasantly aroused about his date night to fully hard in a mere second, he was sure there wasn’t blood in his brain anymore…
“John, I…”, Sherlock blushing was so endearing, John couldn’t not kiss him again, when he came up for air, Sherlock scolded him, “John, I am trying to tell you something!” John pinched Sherlock’s nipples as retribution for the nagging, “Jaawn, I can’t concentrate! I… uh, I prepared myself for…for you” the detective finally finished.
John felt like a disobedient child that was being scolded for his bad temper.
“Well, it seems we finally have names for our babies! Matilda and Malo… I’m going to register the names with the nurses right now!” John jumped to his feet, smiling like a loon but he couldn’t care less!
Softness, as fake as her finger nails, covered Janine's features.
Matilda just gurgled and made faces and Sherlock kissed her blond hair.
There it was. John's cock, swollen against his own belly and Sherlock kissed it, the head, the shaft as it twitched beautifully.
“Leanna and I will stay in London. She is still the Holmes heir and you are still her grandparents, but I won't allow her to be unhappy ever again and she is happy where we are now.” Sherlock affirmed.
Sherlock emerged from his mind palace with a sharp breath. He was lying on the sofa, Leanna helping Mrs. Hudson baking in their landlady's kitchen. Well, not anymore.
They stumbled onto their makeshift bed, the robe being the only piece of clothes they needed to drop on their way. Lips on his neck, his chest, his belly and then, this wonderful moth, capable of praise and nagging, endearments and curses closed around him, warm and wet around his glands, suckling and licking and Sherlock buried his hands in John's hair, trying hard to keep on breathing.
“Marriage between two Alphas or two Omegas will be legal within this year. I thought you might appreciate having the chance to surprise Sherlock for once. Once he knows you will be allowed to marry, he will expect a proposal.”
“Daddy! Can I open them?” Leanna could already read names and had made piles for each of them.
“I can’t just do nothing, Sarah!”
In his arms, Sherlock sensed John beginning to shake, he could feel the silent tears soaking his shoulder.
Sherlock took a deep breath, and began.
John felt a little guilty, using Leanna to interrupt Sherlock’s dance, but well…it worked…
Oh the smut :D
They had toast and Leanna seemed almost back to her normal, happy self. She talked a lot, told him about all the things Nana and she had done, how they had had pajama parties every evening.
All of what defined John and what was his life disappeared in one single night. A shot. One little misplaced shot and John lost everything he thought would always be part of his life. It wasn’t a heroic night, wasn’t an important mission, no other casualties than him being shot at… Fucking ironic to be discharged, to lose his place as the alpha of the 5
“You... you want to.... I mean, this is our first time and.... We don't have to go that far yet. We have time, Sherlock, all the time in the world and I would be happy just to kiss you for the rest of the night. I don't want you to feel pressured into anything.”
“This is getting sentimental, John.”
“I know.” Sherlock rubbed his nose against the place behind John's ear. “It was stupid of me to think I could solve a case without my doctor.” Now that he had the doctor once again in his arms, all the fight and anguish that resulted because he had been too stubborn to try and communicate with John seemed… a price too high to pay. He should never have left their bed.
The little boy was peacefully asleep behind the glass windows, John felt such a deep love for him already, he wanted to take him in his arm and tell him that he was loved, so much. Mute… His little boy was mute… They could learn sign language to help communicate quickly… John could already picture Sherlock learning faster than anyone and telling him he was doing it wrong. The thought brought a smile on his face. It will be alright, they could do it. He was alive and mostly healthy. It would be okay.
“It's a really brave, the steps you took. Will you be alright?”
“… How…How can such conceited and old fashion view still exist in our world! It’s the 21st century, for heaven’s sake! How could they do this to Sherlock, you and me! I want to strangle them, kill them slowly and painfully!”
“He is weaker than his sister, we put him in an incubator to keep him arm. His immune system is a little weak for the moment and we think it’s more safe to keep him there to protect him from any germs.”
“I don't think Mummy would agree with that,” he said, combing through dark curls.
And he was angry. He felt boiling from anger and rage. About the article that threatened their way of life, anger at all those know-it-alls that felt they could judge him and fierce hatred for those raptors that called themselves journalists and remaining  waiting at the entrance.
Sherlock was the first to wake up, the infuriating git! He had a serious look on his face, betraying some hard thinking process.
The old man carefully sat down at her side, intentionally distributing omega pheromones so she would calm down. “I live here. I heard the sounds you made every morning. Clever girl, using the change of guards. Here, let me…”
With that he was gone, the door reopening seconds later as the Alpha who had taken her from the hospital came in. She forced herself to look at him, to not show her fear. Inside, she was close to a panic attack. Not because she was abducted by some mad man, but because there were two little humans growing inside of her and the presence of an unbound Alpha would harm them. Her babies could be dead within a week or two.
No call from Mummy yet.
Sherlock quickly melted against him. He was shaking. The love of his life was shaking and fell to his knees. He kept John close, his face buried in John’s belly.
John turned around to thoroughly snog his lovely man. The mistletoe had been the witness of many kisses that night. Some shy on the cheek, others more heated had involved lips and tongues. It had been one of Leanna great pleasure that night to yell KISS! Each time two peoples were under the mistletoe. Molly and Sarah had been the first to comply to the tradition. John was about to tell it wasn’t necessary when Molly had kissed Sarah on the cheek. Poor Molly had blushed, as red as a tomato, but she had had the courage. John promised himself to never dismiss Molly as too shy, she would become an important part of his pack.
Leanna was excited. She had some recollection of big parties in her ancient big house, where her Grandma lived, but she had been banned from all festivities, her Mama had told her she was too small to celebrate with all the grown ups. Today, she would eat with everyone and Daddy had promised she would be able to play in the room with the guests.
The smile on John's face made him forget about the omega. John smiled so brightly at him, his eyes full of love for Sherlock and the detective still couldn't believe it. John loved him. Love. And that's what John said.
Leanna had her nose pressed to the glass again and they came to stand behind her.
John was next to him on the floor seconds later and his warm lips where back on Sherlock's.
A gasp.
Sarah’s voice was hesitant, a tone of voice John didn’t recognise on his friend.
“I would… I would love that. Maybe, if the night goes well, you could come.”
Janine was pretty and sweet, if one, unlike Sherlock, didn't look deeper than at the facade she presented. He would've been blind not to see how pretty she looked in her plain, champagne coloured dress and light make up. A picture of innocence, a perfect omega, a caretaker. She smiled at every single one of their 346 guests, her hand in Sherlock's and she let him lead her to their bedroom after the wedding reception.
Moving his other hand down to first fumble his balls and then press a finger against his anus, Sherlock came, biting down on his lower lip to keep himself from screaming. God, he couldn't wait to have John inside him. He needed him there. He was curious and if nothing else adventurous…
“I love you too, John!”
It was good to leave the flat and with it the nervous energy there.
“Absolutely!”
“Hey, little mouse, can you open your eye for me?” John cooed.
“I am sorry John. But it’s my decision to make. I am just informing you. I will keep you posted about what I am going to do.”
“John…You…You can’t…Leanna” Sherlock protested weakly.
John put the paper on the back of the watch and tried to take the imprint of the engraving using the paper and pen.
Sarah froze and she was suddenly aware of the pulling in her stomach. From one second to the next, his Alpha scent filled the air like petrol.
“You…hmm, It was you space, your den, this bedroom. I understand how alphas work, I am one too, you know,…I didn’t think about it, stupid of me…Don’t you feel threatened in your territory? I…I am sorry. I could put everything back? How should we do this moving in?”
much stuff to deal with already.
“Sherlock, are you listening?” John looked at him with so much adoration, it made Sherlock's heart jump with joy, an emotion so opposite to those he had experienced in the last few hours, it made him feel dizzy.
“Yes, John.”
“Hello, brother mine.”
“Yes, well, hum, I am a doctor I suppose. They didn’t give me the post in the trauma emergency care, the director thought I would be too slow with my limp and a liability in urgent situation. I have a little office and I receive less urgent patient I suppose…”
They got dressed quickly and hurried down the stairs. The car was waiting for them and they got in.
“John. Hmm, I have, hmm, something important to say, but I want you to know first that it won’t change anything!”
“Dr Watson,” Jim cooed, “fancy seeing you here. I'm afraid you can't stop this. If he stays alive, or I get harmed, Sebastian has the order to kill Sarah. You remember Sebastian, I suppose?”
After a while, Sherlock reluctantly released him. “We must finish the preparation. Molly and the others will be here soon…”
Suddenly, the tall man took John’s head in his hand and kissed him. Hard.
John visibly flinched. Sherlock had been mean to remind John of his habit of taking a walk each time there is a crisis between them. He didn’t want to leave with those painful words, “John, I just think we need some time to…calm ourselves. I will be back later. You don’t have to wait for me.”
There was a text message.
Maybe it was the alcohol (wishful thinking on his part), but John lost his control and caught Roger by the throat and whispered in his ear, “Don’t talk about omegas like that, you little scum! My work was to protect and defend the population against terrorist attack, NOT to be a predator myself! Or allow it by anyone else! If you think I will let you say that omegas are just promiscuous and can be…”
The old man left the bedroom. The gun was hidden behind a vase in the hallway and he took it in hand. It felt heavier than it had twenty years ago when he had held it the last time, the day he had sworn to never touch it again.
“You won't tell them?” Sherlock blurted out.
The nurse was holding a bundle in her arms and it took Sherlock embarrassingly long to realize that this was John’s and Sarah’s child. The nurse smiled at him.
“I…yes…just a…bad dream.”
See you soon!
He could feel John relax against him.
“Yes.”
“Hmm, I’m not sure, I’ll let you know. I should ask him first.”
“John? John! You’re crying!” The alarmed tone of Sherlock made John snap out of his trance. He felt the moisture on his cheek. He was crying, heavy tears falling from his eyes, but he had to reassure Sherlock, he wasn’t sad, on contrary.
“John. It’s not your fault. I don’t blame you for what happens.”
The day after, John had to go to work. Sarah was already here when he came. She was very pale, it seemed the morning sickness was still very potent. They were lots of patients, and John didn’t have time to talk with Sarah before his shift was over.
They had almost kissed.
“Wonderful, you’re making great progress in creating a new life for yourself!” Ella was smiling as if he had just told her he had won the lottery. “And your leg, do you feel any change in the pain now that you’re at your new job?”
He noticed Molly straight away, as she walked in the door, looking around the room shyly. He waved his hand and she smiled. Leanna looked up and squealed, throwing her pencil away.
“Oh Sher... oh Sherlock. Oh love. Hmm.”
The old man heard the girl scream as the bullet hit his chest. He fell backwards and onto the bed as the pain spread throughout his chest.
Patience and length of time will still
“It’s happy tears John, stop fussing!” After ruining his handkerchief, she added, “Thank you John, you can’t imagine how much it means to me, your forgiveness…Oh, I almost forgot, here you’re invited to Clara’s birthday party, if you could come, it would be fantastic.”
John closed his eyes and tried to unclenched his fist. When he opened it again, he saw that Molly had fallen asleep beside Sarah. She had their fingers intertwined. Molly had been great at calming her mate, it had been beautiful, heart warming after all the stress to watch the two women find each other, hugging and kissing. Now that he saw them together, he wondered how he hadn’t seen how their fast friendship would evolve to love. Molly, usually so quiet and unsure of herself had disappeared, she wasn’t shy asking and organising Sarah’s well being and comfort.
Janine looked beautiful in her floral and white cardigan and decent Make up. Her eyes were cold.
John looked at Sarah’s neck anxiously…
So Sherlock had manhandled him in the police’s bathroom after John had successfully disabled a suspect. John took himself in hand, and let his mind wander back in time.
“I, yeah. Well, they are still checking him out. He’s smaller and… they don’t seem as confident with him as they did with his sister, but he has a healthy heart and good lungs, so, that’s good.”
“Oh, no. I'd rather not, little mouse. Your Papa would probably burn down the whole kitchen, if he tried.”
Motherhood felt amazing. She felt tired and her whole body ached and she cried a lot, blaming it on the hormones, but the love she felt was indescribable and made up for every night without sleep and every ache of her body.
Sherlock couldn't even imagine how John felt with having made this decision, he couldn’t comprehend why he had killed Jim… Chose him over his family...
“Because he is mine” she innocently answered, “You are my Papa and you are my John.”
“My men are taking care of Moriarty’s body. Noone will know.“ Mycroft crossed his arms behind his back.
“Of course I want you to be part of their life! You’re my life partner, you will have a big role in their upbringing!”
“Mycroft Holmes only knows about me because you told the omega bitch about me. As a pressure point. I lost my fucking pack because of that.”
The day they left Sussex and met John.
John would have to say his thanks to Mycroft… It was the elder Holmes who had informed John of Sherlock’s birthday… Sherlock, the git, hadn’t said a word about it!
“I wonder if Mrs. Hudson does anything else besides baking.”
Sherlock could hear a door being closed. “I’m sorry about your dad, love. I couldn’t even be there for you... I’m sorry.“
“John?” Sherlock said after a while and John hummed in acknowledgement. They had been a couple long enough for Sherlock to know John was listening to him, even if he was a little annoyed to have his holy newspaper time interrupted. God, they really were an old married couple Sherlock thought.
John could feel all his muscles grow stiff while he could swear the earth was cracking open under his feet. He could hear Molly’s scream but it seems so far away. Only one thing resonated in his ears, Kidnapped, Kidnapped, Kidnapped, Kidnapped…
If it had been lighter, John would have seen the blush rising on his friend’s cheek.
Sherlock didn’t answer, burying his head in John’s neck.
Sherlock woke up comfortably warm and content. John's chest was pressed against his back and a strong arm wrapped around Sherlock. It was still early; the sun hadn't even started to come up yet. It was those moments of silence in which Sherlock's mind went to dark places, even with his John, his protector, wrapped around him. John was always the protector, possessive of his man, and Sherlock couldn't stop himself from thinking that he, as an alpha, didn't (shouldn’t) need protection, that he was strong enough to take care of himself and his child.
“Really John? Did you peek at my list again?” Sherlock seemed very curious now, “What is it?”
“So where is he?” John asked.
“Mr Holmes, tell us how she was found.”
“I have to inform you that I am currently masturbating thinking of you.”
Janine huffed. “Let me answer that for you. You're not. You are a fucking sociopath, and you will make her into one too. Keeping her from everyone she loves, making her watch her back for the rest of her life.”
When John was finally near his ass, Sherlock’s respiration was already very heavy and quick.
Finally, Sherlock took his hand, a shy smile on his face. Sherlock loved to dance he remembered.
“Yes?” John saw Sherlock take a big breath and beginning to walk into the living room. He seemed nervous, which surprised John, he had never seen Sherlock nervous before.
“Hi, love.” He sounded tired, but well enough.
She was really cute in her costume. She had a green coat with big red buttons, red trousers with candy-stripped red socks and an adorable pointy hat. It was a gift from Molly who was now living in London and came to babysit Leanna regularly. She had been so excited, and, with Sherlock gone, he didn’t feel like disappointing her and telling her no.
Sherlock smirked. "Hardly. I'm here investigating a murder."
"John, it's me Bryan. From the veterans' group."
"Dick," James repeated. He mentally ran through a list of the men he knew, but he couldn't place that name. "What did he look like?"
"Your parents just called. They're very worried." She put her hands on her hips and frowned hard at him. "What on earth possessed you to sneak out of your house, breaking curfew, and trying to see John, besides total stupidity?"
"Only his tragedies. Hamlet is a literary masterpiece."
Watch out for the red herring in this chapter!
"You can't do that!" Marty yelled.
*****
"That doesn't make me feel any better," Billy soberly responded.
Moments later, the door banged open. John jumped, nearly dropping his tapes. He looked up and saw Sherlock in the doorway. "What the hell?--" he shouted.
"Hey, I know my priorities, and you Mister Watson-Holmes, can still use feeding up. Especially since I know Molly provided you with enough body parts to experiment on for the next week, and when you get caught up studying livers and ears, you ignore more important things like breakfast, lunch, and dinner."
They wanted to keep John overnight for observation, and despite both the doctor and his detective husband's very vocal objections, they were silenced by a six-foot three Amazon of a nurse named Pat who told them John was staying because he had a concussion and his headache was slow to go away, and one night in a hospital bed was not as bad as they thought. She also told them if they continued to whine, John's dinner would consist of the "mystery special soup and tapioca" and she would personally give John a nice, long sponge bath. Sherlock wanted to report her but it turned out the British government himself had called the hospital after learning from Greg what went down, and personally requested Nurse Pat to be assigned to the stubborn blogger. Pat had attended to Anthea after suffering a broken ankle and Anthea had been impressed with her no-nonsense, take-no-bullshit attitude. If anyone could handle a sarcastic deducing detective and a former Army Captain, it was her.
Victor grinned and put down his camera, moving close to John. "That's because you're so good-looking."
Saturday, I'm spending the day with my daughter and her girlfriend, but I'm free Sunday, if you are.
John nodded but he wasn't so sure. Killers didn't care if it was night or day, they would strike when the mood took them. "You still going to get that gun? I think it's a good idea even though you don't like them."
John placed his neatly folded shirts on a display rack and was ready to begin his next task, wrapping up a large Christmas order for the wife of a prominent heart surgeon. She had taken a liking to John and ended up buying one thousand pounds of shirts, socks, and ties for her husband and two sons. She would be picking up the packages tomorrow afternoon during John's shift. Before John could get the order, a customer entered the shop, shaking off the snow away from his dark curls. He was tall, with a thin build, but John could make out some muscle underneath his super-expensive Belstaff coat. He had the most unusual beautiful face John had ever seen, with full pink lips and eyes that seemed to shift to blue, green, and gray underneath the soft store lights. John was instantly attracted to the young man, but he was sure someone with those model looks was already taken.
"Don't be embarrassed John. You're not feeling well and I want to take care of you, I love you." He pressed a kiss to his blogger's hair. "And I could do with a nap myself. Before you came home I was in my lab conducting an experiment that was very time consuming and tiring."
John gave him a
"Hmm, so Hope came here, possibly to confront Richard, and somehow he got a bullet in the back," Dave surmised.
"January 29th has turned out to be a wonderful date," John remarked. I met the love of my life and thirty years later, we've got a grandchild to love and spoil. It makes winter that much better. "
"Hello John. He is, but unfortunately he's come down with the same virus that sickened Eurus, and he also has a fever. He's in bed resting, but not by choice."
A few minutes later, the doctor entered the room. Sherlock couldn't help take notice of how handsome he was. He was young, about his age or a few years older, with short blond hair, and deep blue eyes. He had crinkles underneath his eyes, a prominent nose, and perhaps the cutest ears Sherlock had ever seen on a man, and he instantly wondered where that came from, but he put it out of his mind. Simply, the doctor was attractive. He wore a white labcoat, khaki trousers, and a white button down shirt. His name tag read John Watson, M.D.
John's dark blue eyes grew wide at seeing Sherlock in his tight fitting plum shirt. "Jesus Sherlock, purple is your color."
Sherlock hugged the picture to his chest, cradling it as if were a precious, fragile newborn.
"Thanks. Captain Aubergine did a great job picking them out."
Harry would be arriving in a few minutes so John dried off, sprinkled baby powder on him so he would smell good without having a girly scent on him, got dressed, and ran a wet comb through his hair. He left the bathroom and headed into the living room to wait for his sister.
*****
"Good evening, and thank you for waiting so patiently! At this time, I ask you please enter the shop in an orderly fashion and proceed to the back. We have chairs set up and I would like everyone to take a seat for the question-and-answer section."
Lucy coughed, wiped her mouth, and turned to look at her brother. Her face was red, and tears stained her cheeks. She let out a sob and melted into the safe embrace of her brother's arms.
"Okay, but you'll catch my cold," John warned.
The phone rang again and John answered it. "Hello, Watson residence."
“Oh, and what is that?” Sherlock asked, a tad sarcastically.

The voice laughed, and it sent chills down the DJ's spine. "Of course. I wouldn't think you'd keep this private. I want you to play our little conversation. We're going to have more of them. You're a good man Billy, I'm going to make you famous."
Henry stood up, leaving the half-full cup of water on the table. "What's going to happen now?" he asked, his voice quivering.
Jim was in his kitchen, making Sebastian a peanut butter and chocolate smoothie. Sebastian had come home from his veterans' support group, worked up over a new member that came with his friend Luke. The man, John Watson, looked a lot like Quinn, but Sebastian had said he was soft spoken, funny, and the other guys really liked him. Sebastian also said that John was a dominator and dressing in fatigues, making good money tying up other men and sometimes women, and treating them like they were Army privates, but he was doing it to support his daughter.
Wanda Watson sat the newspaper down on the kitchen table and sighed, wondering what was happening to this lovely little town. She left Los Angeles thinking settling into a small town would be safer, and now a masked lunatic was on the loose.
"Let him go Veronica," Sidney firmly told her. He glanced at Mrs. Watson. "I think he's genuinely upset at that news about John. "
Mycroft turned to look at his brother with a sneer. “I would say the same for you and this John Watson. So don’t lecture me when you’re also being a hypocrite, brother mine.” Then he smiled, his icy eyes gleaming. “I did find out from Mrs. Smallwood that my Molly and your John both work at the same place, a drive-in called The Big H. It sounds absolutely pedestrian, but unlike us, they must work for their money.”
"Can't escape from it love, most of them are going to be family in under two hours," John teased. Then he leaned in close to Sherlock, breath ghosting his neck, and put his hand on his behind, giving it a hard squeeze. "Behave alpha," he murmured seductively, mirroring his actions from that Halloween night that started it all.
Sherlock gently tapped John on the shoulder. John stirred and said something that came out muffled, then pushed his head back into the pillow, burrowing under the covers. Sherlock couldn't help but smile, his husband was adorable when he did that, looking like the little hedgehog that Sherlock sometimes affectionately called him.
Sherlock sighed and slid down to the ground beside John. He crossed his long, slim legs, which were clothed in tight dark blue jeans. He wore a fitted white T-shirt and his black boots, but his hair was still in loose curls. The sight made John's stomach twist in a way he didn't want it to.
Sherlock beamed. "I love you too John." He returned the kiss, warmth filling his body like a comforting cup of hot chocolate.
he exclaimed silently.
Mayor Jack Harkness advises residents to stick to the 9:00 pm curfew and to be aware of their surroundings.
Before he knew it, he reached out for John, cupping his face with his hands, leaning in, forehead pressed to his, his lips meeting his. It was a quick kiss, but full of love.
Sherlock had his head on John's shoulder the entire time, listening to him and getting lost in the honeyed tenor of his voice. He felt so happy, so content and safe. If this what love was truly like, Sherlock was sure he was falling into it.
"Anyone can lie about their age on the Internet," John pointed out.
Sebastian walked over to Henry and slowly lowered himself down on top of the smaller boy, pressing kisses to his forehead, cheeks and finally lips. He deepened the kiss, his tongue slowly working its way into Henry's mouth. Henry let go of his comic, allowing it to fall to the floor, and he wrapped his arms around Sebastian's back, his hands going down to his backside. He grabbed Sebastian's butt and began to squeeze it.
"Hey John. Wonder if we'll make a full week of class?" Mike said.
Moments later, Sherlock found himself being chased around the flat by a spatula wielding John. "If you keep this up, I'll tell Bill to play all those line dancing songs---and I'll make sure your skinny little arse is up there moving to all of them!"
*****
"Well love, if they are, just don't blink." Then John roared with laughter. Sherlock joined him, and they left the roof, ready for whatever invasion would come their way this Christmas.
Sherlock lay on his bed, staring up at the ceiling but the only thing he could see was John's sweet face, his dark blue eyes that occasionally show a trace of chocolate brown in them, and that shiny hair that glistened like gold in the sunlight. He was dangerously and desperately in love with John Watson, and just wanted to take him away and keep him.
"He definitely keeps Sebastian on his toes," John said. "But Sebastian likes it."
"I feel so bad for Sebastian," John told Luke as the two entered the coffee shop, taking a booth close to the back next to a window, where the two could look out onto the street. Luke had filled him in on what had happened to the ex-soldier.
"Thank you so much for coming tonight, and I want to thank Mike for his support and friendship. We were roommates at St. Bart's."
"Unless they're looking for a sugar daddy or a sugar mommy," John said matter-of-fact.
“You can say that again. Anyway, I decided to show him some self-defense tactics I learned over the years, and ended up bringing him to his knees, twisting his arm around his back. I told him if he ever confronted me again like that, he’d end up with more than a sore arm. I left him in the street and went home. I should have called the cops, but I didn’t. I did tell the guys at the meeting about him and warned that if they ever encountered him, to stay away.”
Sherlock wasn't buying it, but then one of the servers had come forward saying she'd seen Ms. Divine heading up the stairs shortly after Ms. Beckwith before the lights went out, and then after the lights came on, she was standing at the bottom of the stairs. She was confused at that because there was no way she could have gotten down the stairs in the dark without falling.
"Ready to unwrap your Christmas gift?" John asked with a wink, licking his lips.
"Very. And there was a most persistent customer that only wanted you," the manager replied.
"I have a better idea John," Mrs. Hudson said. "How about the girls help me make the special treats?"
“Hello Karen. Don’t worry we are not here to cause a scandal. Sarah is… tired from her pregnancy. She won’t be coming to work for a few days. She asked we take care of some personal items in her office. We won’t be long.” John explained.
“Hmm, they don’t want to.” She had the good grace to look embarrassed.
Sherlock had touched himself like this before, right here in this shower cubicle, before he had known John felt the same lust and love Sherlock had for him. God, how lucky was he for this amazing man to fall in love with him. Was this okay, masturbating at the thought of one's boyfriend?
“Hello boys, hope we’re not interrupting anything. We had a great time at Mrs Turner’s. Here some biscuits we made. I have to go, have a nice evening!” And the landlady disappeared quickly into her own flat.
“That’s…That would be a big service from Mycroft… If you’re sure, I am too Sherlock. You’re right; I am already very involved with Leanna growing-up. And…And I really want it, I want to be a father to her too, I want to raise her with you and I don’t ever want to feel threatened about my place in her life. I will sign those papers Sherlock. I don’t need to think longer about it.”
John sighed… Well, maybe a second point of view could help so he explained what happened with Sherlock. When he finished, Sarah looked at him and the laughed. John hadn’t expected that reaction. He had exposed his feeling and she just laughed!
Leanna finally let him go and John saw Sherlock beaming at them. He promptly jumped from the couch and announced “We have to celebrate! What would you like to do Leanna?”
“John, I... oh... I need to... present. I have a present for you and oh...”
Sarah was being a good friend, tried to engage him in conversation but he didn’t feel very cooperative. Not like he had anything to tell, nothing happened to him anymore. Probably part of his problems connecting with civilian people, civilian life.
“Sherlock? Can you look at me please? Sherlock! It’s getting a little worrying, here!”
Oh. That's what it was all about. Sherlock was… afraid. John would need to be really careful now with what he should say or Sherlock would flee and never change his mind. The detective lost bit of his tension and refused to look at John.
“Whatever she has to say, it will impact both of us, we are a couple, and of course I want you with me, dumbass!”
Around eight, Sherlock brought Leanna upstairs. She made a fuss, didn’t want to sleep at first and Sherlock lay down in her in her tiny bed with her. She felt it, John's bad mood, his being unable to do anything. She was emphatic and picked up on their feelings and Sherlock knew she felt unsettled.
She didn’t cry when she saw the picture. She was obviously upset but maybe she hadn’t any more tears left.
“A relationship needs work from all parties involved in general. Biology won’t really help us here, so we will have to communicate. I'm not kidding here. And stop grimacing or I will kiss you!”
“Something bad.”
With that Sherlock hurried out of the lab, John just inches behind him.
“You know, my brothers are proper geniuses too. They can make any kind of film or video you need and the best computer analyst won’t be able to tell shit from truth.”
He would save her. He had to. Her and their children.
Leanna didn't seem convinced, only held on to him tighter.
“You can touch my arse, John. You must, even.”
Sherlock knew he was acting like a child right now, but he had bowed to his mother for too long and he wasn't going to repeat that mistake. He picked the coat from John's armchair and put it on. He would need to bring it to a tailor and the twenty minute walk would help him calm down.
“Good. We'll do that then.”
“None of this is your fault, Sherlock.”
Sherlock avoided the topic of Sarah's pregnancy. He told himself there was enough to worry about already, for example the child that was already living in Baker Street, and that needed most of his attention. Or their new relationship that was still developing, still searching itscourse. The pregnancy, the foetus, meant change and things weren't yet stable enough for such a mature step.
“When you met Anna, how did you know she loved you?”
John, who had been moaning and cursing above him, tensed for a second, before he arched his back. “Oh god, love. That...that feels amazing.”
He realised how much more stuff they had now. When they had come to Baker Street, all their belongings had fit into a suit case, now they had boxes over boxes of clothes and toys. They would leave Leanna's bed here; she had one back in the manor. Maybe John could sell it or keep it for his children with Sarah.
John’s stomach dropped. How dare they threaten Sherlock! And the thing was, it was a likely scenario. He could picture Sherlock running someplace without a thought about his own safety and falling in a trap, being hurt… maybe even being killed…
“Angry? Why should I be angry at you?”
Sherlock’s eyes were dazed when John released him. John excited, looked more closely at his new watch, he couldn’t stop smiling and suspected he was in a very similar state of mind as Leanna, a toddler, only Sherlock could make him feel so much. On the back of the watch, John saw a hidden button. “What is it?”
“Are you saying he was murdered?”
“Maybe… Maybe you’re right…my need to make you submit to me may come from the …fear that I have to give you all the control… But I want an equal relationship with you Sherlock. And… I like it when you’re possessive of me… I love to feel you, I just… need to get used to it. Sherlock will you be patient with me? I want to give you all and have all of you… Is that okay for you?”
Sherlock swallowed the head of John's cock, pressing his tongue to the underside. God, John tasted divine. Bitter and salty combined with traces of his alpha smell. The detective wrapped his right hand around the base for better access.
She is fine, just a broken wrist. SH
“Daddy, will Molly play with me?”
The detective chuckled. “I’m afraid that’s impossible. She is a little on the early side. A lot of babies are, but she is healthy. Do you remember how we talked about how Sarah will breastfeed her? An Omega’s milk has everything she needs and she will grow out here, with us.”
“With an M…” Sherlock made his thinking face, “I propose Matilda then”.
Nor could his rage and roaring break the thrall.
“Hmm, yes, it is, isn't it. I just wished the circumstances where different.”
Sherlock let John sleep and texted Lestrade instead. He needed his help to find out if the car was reported missing. The DI didn't answer and because Sherlock was an impatient man, he called him.
Sherlock stood up carefully, walking towards them.
“I am not sure, we will have to experiment, I know it works for at least for 200 yards (=182m or 600 feet). When the 2nd stone is too far away, the pointer will stay on the zero.”
“Yes, go to London! Me and Papa. Not Mummy,” she squealed, jumping up and down standing on his thighs. He couldn't help himself and giggled with her for a while.
It happened out of instinct, the alpha in Sherlock breaking free. He bit down on John's neck, hard, tasting blood. John groaned above him, arms wrapping around Sherlock to pull him close as they tried to calm down.
John and Leanna had made a full on English breakfast and Sherlock ate a lot more than usually did, just to make them happy. After that, Leanna basically dragged him to the living room, where he opened presents.
Roger fled from the pub without question. The rest of the group left quickly.
She smiled at him, waving at Leanna. The little one blew her a kiss and turned back to her father.
John squared his shoulder, getting himself into soldier mode to prepare himself, “But there is more, what is it doctor?”
As soon as he said alive John moved in his arms, looked up at him.
Mycroft was so kind to send a car and they buckled in the infant carriers for the twins.
“John?”
“Mr. Holmes. We've reached your destination.”
Sherlock started rolling his sleeve back down, even though it was ruined now, sliced and soaked in blood. He would need to change before Leanna came home. “The case was a five, maybe even a four. I have solved more difficult cases from my sofa. And I wore the coat, so there's no need to worry.”
“You and Sarah and Sherlock…It’s not an easy balancing your alpha’s instinct about her pregnancy and your feelings for your dashing mate…”
“I … my name is Sarah. I… they are doing a change of guards every morning. I… I have never seen you before, are you…?”
Sherlock enthusiastically took possession of John’s bedroom. Their bedroom now. And John was happy to let him tidying up everything. “John, you should adopt the same socks index as mine. Very useful you know!”
Sherlock dimmed the lights and relit the fireplace and some of the cinnamon candles John loved so much and swore to himself that he would refuse to have sex with John if his boyfriend ever mentioned the word romantic. Sex by firelight. God, this was so cliché, still, the thought of making love to John right here...
Sherlock seemed suddenly very uneasy and shy.
“Git! I don’t have any energy left in me to have coherent speech right now! But I mean it. Sherlock, you’re my alpha, mine to love and it was…wonderful, you were wonderful.”
His little row with Roger had seriously slowed down everyone’s interaction with him. He feared he was no longer was the pleasant limping doctor in their eyes but the lone Alpha, the stray he couldn’t help feeling himself to be.
“Papa, can Molly come for Christmas?” Leanna was kneading the fresh dough, even if her small hands didn't really have an effect.
“Yes, baby. What do you want, my love?”
“Yes? I AM a genius you know!” Sherlock was hiding his embarrassment behind cockiness but John wasn’t duped.
Hour passed by in which John got even more restless, screaming at Sherlock to do something and Sherlock sat down at the kitchen table. He looked at his microscope again. And there it is, has been there all the time.
Sherlock pressed another kiss to John's mouth, before he continued.
John felt his face warmed, “I can do that”, John quickly added, “I will give some of my old scarfs to Sarah.”
“Alright. I will be careful. I already ask to work part-time. And I have lots of vacation time to take if I feel tired, I will use it.” Sarah answered.
John felt like his emotions were on a roller coaster these last weeks. It was exhausting. Some days he could act like everything was alright but lately, he felt that the bad mood was winning. Sherlock was trying to help, but there was a limit to what the man could do to shelter him from all the unpleasant things that had happened.
“Leanna, what do you prefer, red or …” She wasn’t there. John felt his heart stop. He frantically looked around him, 1 minute, she had been out of his sight 1 minute, she couldn’t be too far.
(See the end of the chapter for
?” John asked curious about the device.
He only held her three times after that. The day Janine came home from the hospital. The day they took their first pictures as a family. Once, as Janine had fallen asleep on the sofa.
“Get it yourself.”
She looked over at Molly, who had Matilda in her arms and her heart broke from joy every time she saw the woman she loved interacting with her babies.
“No, thank you.”
“I’m sorry, John.” Sherlock said for what must have been the thirtieth time. Taking a deep breath, John swallowed his anger and annoyance. Sherlock had tried to be romantic. This had just been a case of bad luck. Proposals just never went well when it came to him.
“This is...”
Finally, John’s survival instinct kicked in. He was a soldier, he knew how to survive. First water, the green forest indicated that there had to be freshwater somewhere. John entered the forest all his senses in alert. Soon, he heard a waterfall and followed the sound.
John smiled at him so fondly, so lovingly, Sherlock felt a warmth within him that had nothing to do with the fire or the duvet. John loved him, Sherlock knew as much, but the realisation of it surprised him again and again.
“Yes, very brilliant and unusual. You must hear that all the time!”
“Hey! That’s not yours, give it back to me! It’s evidence this man is a degenerate alpha! He can’t be allowed to stay a doctor here! He is a Freak fornicating with another alpha! Didn’t you hear the news? You’re an alpha yourself, you should do something! ” One of the witnesses tried to get back his phone from Sherlock’s hand. The fool had no idea what he was going to unleash.
The detective smiled at their playing pretend, watching their every move and shared smile. John got his head bandaged, then Leanna gave him pills only she could see.
Sherlock clenched his hands to fists, a new wave of grief hitting him. “He led an unhappy life.”
“Then you must be quiet, I know I can make you come in less than a minute.”
“Moriarty” John exhaled with Sherlock with a sudden flash of lucidity.
“Sherlock, thank god you’re here!”
“Mummy never comes and sings for me, when I'm sick. Molly sings to me. Papa play violin. Mummy never sings.”
“Hello, Papa.” She sniffled and at first he thought she had been crying. No. Not crying. She was getting sick.
Sherlock grinned at him, pleased. “Remove your clothing then, I want to do unromantic things to you.”
“You romantic!”
“Daddy,” she squealed and ran towards an exhausted, but happy looking John. He caught her, held her to his chest. “Hello, little mouse. Did you meet your sister?”
“Ehm, I… Thank you,” he simply said “, I appreciate you telling me this.”
One day, Sherlock snapped, “John! Stop doubting yourself, you’re losing more IQ points each time you ask yourself if you could be a good father!”
“You can put that on the label if you want to, John-spray.”
Sherlock imagined those small, strong hands on him, his chest, his hips, wandering closer to where he wanted them. John would press his chest to Sherlock's back and oh, he would be so warm and wet from the shower. Biting his lips, Sherlock's hand moved faster, his forehead pressed to the tiles.
“Yes.”
“Yeah, sorry, see you later.” He hesitated but… “Hmm, and…hmm you should wear some clothes on or hmm put the heater on, don’t catch a cold. Bye”
She held her eldest tight.
“Oh my god, Mycroft. This is... I … Sherlock and I talked about this, but I didn't think there was a legal way to...”
He heard Mycroft taking a deep breath, anger now building in him. Reeking. He wasn't reeking of John. John's scent harmonized perfectly with his own, even as they both were Alphas.
“At Clara's party. Harry said to John he should get his man and that he is a tiger.”
“I thought you would want something more dramatic, like forcing me to jump off this roof. Or shoot myself in front of John. You like the dramatic.” Even if he was about to die, Sherlock wanted to show no weakness. He wouldn't give that to Moriarty.
“No. I had those for more than five years and I go to my gynaecologist regularly. I mean, I meet so many Alphas in my job; I have to be able to rely on my medication.”
He knew Sherlock would find his free tickets silly, but John was determined to drown Sherlock under a sweet and romantic gesture. He wanted to keep wooing his man, he never wanted to stop feeling giddy and watching Sherlock blush was the best thing ever.
“Sarah is in labour.”
Sarah was quick to observe John was upset, “What happened?” She asked.
“You… you called Sarah… your omega… Maybe…maybe…”
They came home to a silent flat and got ready for bed. Sherlock checked on Leanna, who was asleep, her Teddy pressed to her chest, hair a mess on the pillow. He watched her for a few minutes, unable to move from all the love he had for her.
Sherlock wasn't particularly afraid of heights. Jumping off Barts Hospital had been one of the ideas when Mycroft and he had thought about faking Sherlock's suicide. Maybe it was a way of torturing himself even more to suggest to Moriarty things would end here.
“She prefers to be alone right now. I will stay at Holmes Manor as long as she needs my presence. You should go home and see your child.
“Come with me, little lioness, time to change and make you even more pretty for the party.”
“Sherlock, are you alright?”
John kissed up his jaw and then pressed his mouth to Sherlock's.
Sherlock hated James Moriarty with a passion. He hated him for putting Sarah and the twins in danger. He hated him for hurting John. He hated him for playing games. Worst, he felt guilty… He should have been better, cleverer, more invested in the arrest of Moriarty! He knew he was dangerous and Sherlock had made the unforgivable mistake of underestimate him… John was in shock for the moment, but won’t John blame him? Sarah and their babies were in danger, and somehow Sherlock couldn’t help feel like he was responsible…
“My name is Moran, but you can call me Sebastian. We're gonna spend quite some time together.”
But it was useless thinking. She had been late. Now Siger was dead. All she could do was hugging his sons and try to do a better work at protecting her family.
“I didn't know you started as a detective as a kid.” John seemed impressed.
They returned to kissing, John's hands on Sherlock's cheeks.
John lifted his head, looking down at Sherlock in what was a mix of amusement, love and worry.
“Okay. Well, my trip with Clara was wonderful! She is fantastic John and this trip, with her? It was what I needed. We visited France, Germany and Italy. I loved it with Clara!
“He is,” Sherlock simply said, keeping himself from gushing about his new friend.
“…Thank you. I…I don’t really have anything planned, so…yes, I will happily come.”
“I'm afraid, Sher...I'm afraid that all my parent's work, and your mother's, and the blog.... I'm afraid they won't work. What, if this tears our family apart?”
“I'm sure John will love your cake, little lioness,” he agreed, ruffling her hair.
When John woke up, the feeling of contentment disappeared almost instantly. The sheets next to him were cold. Sherlock had left. Anger was the first emotion to rise. Hot anger. Sherlock wasn’t in the flat. After the extraordinary night they had spent together, the alpha had let his smelt clear in John’s olfactory senses. His man wasn’t in the flat. The great git had left him on the side. Again! How dare he after what they had shared! He had thought Sherlock had understood what it meant for John to let go of all his defenses… Did he mean so little to be abandon the morning after?
Sherlock was near asleep when John crawled into bed next to him and he wrapped his arms around the doctor, holding him close. His mouth found John's neck, unable to resist pressing kisses to the warm skin.
They didn't leave the flat much, Sherlock worried his family would find him, expecting Mycroft behind every CCTV camera. He hoped Leanna was unaffected by his minor paranoia, her happiness was his first priority. Leanna didn't ask about Janine, ever. Sometimes she talked about her grandfather, or Molly. Sherlock had thought about contacting their former Nanny, but feared the Holmes family would pressure her into revealing their whereabouts.
“Oh!” Sherlock almost jerked out.
“John…” Sherlock whispered. But John couldn’t look at him, he had to stay concentrated on his mark. He just moved in front of him, protecting him with his body.
Also, thank you to Ember88 for your Story :D
Sherlock took a deep breath. “People are curious and they think what Moriarty has done to Sarah is interesting, exciting news.”
“Hmmm, Yes, hum, Yes…”
John caught a cab and worried about Sherlock’s news. He hoped Sherlock hadn’t found a flat for him and Leanna. The thought of living alone again –without Sherlock- made him feel sick. They hadn’t spoken about their arrangement after the first day. He should have made it clear that Sherlock and his daughter could stay as long as they wanted. Or worse, was it about his wife? Did something happen?
John stood up and helped Sherlock into his coat. While John was in the loo, Sherlock paid and they left Angelo's in a hurry that had nothing to do with the rain.
“Father wouldn’t have wanted you and Leanna to live an unhappy life. He told me so himself. I think he knew you would leave some day, do what he couldn’t. He knew what it meant to love someone other than the person you are married to.”
“Okay love. As long as you want.” John pressed small and gentle kisses on Sherlock’s neck, soothing where he had bruised the skin.
“Can you speak about it? You're frightening me, sweetheart…” John felt like he should insist and try to make the detective explained what had distressed him.  He had been so shaken by this dream, it had to be important, something Sherlock was afraid of. John needed to know what cause it to be able to protect him from it.
Sherlock smiled. “People are idiots. I don't care what they think. All I care about is that I love Daddy and Daddy loves me and we both love you. But I know Daddy cares, that's why I care too.”
Sherlock considered just leaving but he knew John would not appreciate it. So he went into the bedroom again.
They talked about some cases John had started typing up, because unlike Sherlock he couldn’t just save them in his mind palace forever, if he found them important enough. Never before had someone been so interested in his work. It made Sherlock proud to be able to share this part of his life with John. If Sherlock could go back to being Sherlock Holmes, Alpha, he could go back to his website and work with private clients again instead of waiting for Lestrade or his colleagues to call. He enjoyed working with NSY, but before fleeing to London he had five or six cases a week, working until his transport threatened to give in, now there were days without any case at all. Of course, now that he had a daughter to take care of and a wonderful boyfriend, there was no time to be bored (well, only one or two times a day).
Oh my poor pining baby ~ Strange_Johnlock
“Of course little mouse, I'll cut one for you. Here, careful and chew before you swallow.” John gave her a bowl with an half apple cut into small pieces.
“Hello, Mr. Holmes. The little one wanted to talk to you.”
Sherlock hadn’t come, he was on a case with Lestrade, but he wondered if it hadn’t been more convenient than anything. The detective was hiding something, John was sure of that. There were new worried lines on the face he knew by heart. He wanted to give him time to express his feelings, well he hoped so, he didn’t want to push his lover but only time will tell if it was the right choice.
The comforting smell of his alpha’s rage made him close his eyes. She was there to protect him, protect her omega.
(See the end of the chapter for
John’s heart was warm with love and affection. Leanna’s enthusiasm was infectious and he took one of the presents and gave it to Sherlock, “This one is for you, love.”
They had schemed a good breakfast, a mix of traditional English breakfast and some sugar at the end because whatever Sherlock tried to make him believe, he had a sweet tooth!
Sherlock felt John next to him and he knew he shouldn't have hidden from him for days on end. They would be better now, together.
Sherlock had to forget his own feelings, concentrate on the case and John. It was the only way he could still do something…
“Yes?”
“Yes, John. Can you just hold me?”
They reached Charing Cross Station a few minutes after midnight and it took Sherlock a while to find an adequate Hotel, Leanna now whimpering and sniffling, as he carried her to their room.
“Papa! Daddy! Santa came!!! There are many gifts under the tree!!! Can we open them? Please!!!!”
Mycroft nodded. “I will.”
Janine was still so sure of herself, smiling at him in what was real, untarnished joy.
“No.”
“Five minutes, Papa?”
What Leanna was saying: Then you should kiss Papa, he doesn’t think you want”
“I…It was about…Janine…She, hmm, she was telling I was an failure of an alpha, playing detective…not able to provide a normal family for Leanna…and…hmm, you…you appeared and…told…” Sherlock obstinate as ever, kept his face hidden.
“Maybe we should ask our better halves,” Sarah sighed after John once more vetoed out another name. John just couldn’t imagine his daughter being named Mildred. He had known a very mean Mildred when he had been a child. No way it was a good omen for his little angel!
Mrs Hudson fell. Took her to the hospital. SH
“Yes…And?”
Nope. Not an option.
John dreaded this moment. Would Sherlock understand? They hadn’t spoken about feelings yet… But he had been a coward for too long, if he had stayed in their flat, maybe none of this would have happened… And he just was so confused about what he really felt. Love, like, what’s the difference anyway? How do you know for sure?
– what do you want?” Sherlock pants.
John reads and drinks his tea for a few minutes before he ventures: “Have you eaten?”
Sherlock grabs John's upper arms and holds them tight as he pounds down so,
“What took you so long?”
“Stop looking so smug. Oh by the way, I forgot to mention yesterday seeing as someone so thoroughly distracted me when I walked in the door…” More smirking, and the slight raising of one dark eyebrow. John clears his throat. “Yes, well. Anyway, Jake said yesterday we’re going to have a ‘Bring a Mate’ training session next week. I just wondered if, you know, uh-“ He brings one hand up to clasp the back of his neck, unusually awkward.
. Sherlock has on a pair of navy and white striped knee socks, and instead of folding them as John would do he’s pulled them all the way up so they just come over his knees, and the result is that his legs look like they go on forever. He looks simultaneously strong and powerful, and yet innocent, almost
“Christ Sherlock, I’ve never known as bossy a bottom as you” John pants as Sherlock coats his cock in a manner that’s perfunctory at best.
.” He pours lube onto his already slick right hand and grabs for John’s cock.
“Good. Well it’s next Tuesday so we’ll have to get you some boots and a gumshield over the weekend, but I’ve got plenty of kit upstairs, I’m sure some of it will fit – maybe have a rummage and see what you can find? If there’s nothing that suits we can pick some up. Anyway, got to shoot, see you later love”. John presses a swift kiss to Sherlock’s lips before grabbing his jacket and jogging down the stairs, leaving Sherlock deep in thought.
*****
Sherlock sniffed haughtily. “Yes, well, at least I have the goods to back it up with. I am a ‘mad genius’ as you put it yourself. Not that it was a difficult leap to work out the particular reason for your good humour, considering that this time two-weeks’ ago you were grumbling about him spear tackling you during a non-contact game and that he needed taking down a peg or two. Although you felt the need to tell me, I had already deduced that you had scored, apparent from the particular spread of mud on your jersey, indicating sliding across the ground on your belly with the ball tucked under your left arm. The traces of white paint indicate that it was the try line. Your hand-"
“Jesus Christ”
Sherlock wasn’t the only one with keen powers of observation (though he often forgot this) and John had noticed Sherlock’s dark eyes and elevated pulse rate the minute he stepped in the door in his kit. Not that he needed to notice anything – the effect his rugby kit had on Sherlock was well-known, all the better when he was muddy and sweaty along with it. They had made the delightful discovery just over a year ago last September, when John decided to go back to playing again, saying he needed to do some form of fitness other than chasing after serial killers - which was sporadic at best and not actually that good for muscle definition, as it turned out. But it turned out John’s cardio was better than expected for a man his age, so it was good for something at least. John sometimes wondered when he had started seeing silver linings in serial killings, and figured it was all Sherlock’s fault. Such was his life now.
John grinned wickedly as he gave Sherlock what he wanted – he slipped a hand underneath the waistband of his shorts and into the tight lycra undershorts, gripping his hard cock and pulling it out as he pulled the shorts down, both pairs, just enough to tuck just under his balls, already heavy with lust. He released himself and let it all hang there, on display, and leaned forward on the table with his knuckles either side of Sherlock’s spread thighs with a predatory look on his face, eyes dark. Sherlock whimpered and felt his mouth start to water. He could
“Did you, Sherlock Holmes, just call somebody else an arrogant arse?” John’s eyes twinkled.
just from touching his arms. He felt a tiny bit smug, but mostly just deliriously lucky. He licked into Sherlock’s mouth desperately, the tension suddenly rising exponentially, and began to rock his hips forward, pressing his now prominent erection into Sherlock’s belly.
John just sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose.
His voice was low and dark. “Please, John…”
Sherlock flushes a little.
With that, John stood up again and pulled Sherlock to his feet, who had a brief moment to look both bewildered and somewhat affronted before John picked him up, hands underneath him where thigh met buttock, cradling him. At this, Sherlock threw his head back and moaned with wild abandon, legs instinctively going around John’s waist. Distantly, John realised he’d never actually tried picking Sherlock up before. He was heavy, no mistake, being as tall as he was, but hours spent in the gym combined with adrenaline and arousal made John feel as if he could hold him forever. Instead, he turned round and stepped to the side of the microscope (he knew it wasn’t worth his life to touch that, no matter how good the sex was) and swept aside some of Sherlock’s notes and the abandoned tea cup, before depositing Sherlock onto the kitchen table and crowding close between his legs. Upon realising that John was not only holding him up, but with one hand only whilst he cleared the table, Sherlock practically wailed (John hoped for her sake that Mrs Hudson had the telly on very, very loud). The detective was flushing a furious red and clutching desperately at John’s hair, his blue dressing gown had slipped off one shoulder along with the neck of his t-shirt, exposing the hollows at the base of his lovely long throat, also mottled with the blush spreading down from his face.
Suddenly, Sherlock jerked his head up and looked at him with huge, dark eyes, pupils blown wide. He panted as he stared directly into John’s eyes:
“Lucky I’ve got a Doctor around to help me out then” he smirks, leaving the rest of his thoughts unsaid, for now.
, and it’s all John can do to hold on for dear life as Sherlock rides him. After a few minutes the detective releases John’s arms to grip the headboard with white knuckles and arches his back further, taut stomach muscles quivering as the change in angle has his full lips dropping open, face going slack with pleasure, a high-pitched whine slipping out.
Sherlock is standing just inside the doorway, dressed from head to toe in John’s old kit. He’s not posing – just standing, and he looks almost a little self-conscious. Nothing anyone else would pick up on, but John is attuned to the slight pinkening high on his cheekbones.
, ever so slightly, sweeping his finger up and down next to his cock, round Sherlock’s arsehole, and for the first time Sherlock’s punishing rhythm falters and he cries out loudly, his voice hoarse:
"He apologized to me and promised he wouldn't do it again."
Marty shot him a dirty look. "Go to hell Doyle."
Sherlock put his hands up in the air. "John, I---"
He never suspected the ankle would swell up, turn red and become inflamed. He wasn't able to really bear weight on it, and he was concerned that it was cellulitis, so he had Mike come over to the flat to look at it. His friend listened to John's symptoms and asked if there was anything he could think of that might have aggravated the joint, and had he experienced any recent medical problems. John mentioned the suspect chase, and that almost six weeks ago, he'd come down with salmonella poisoning from an undercooked beef dinner he'd gotten from the new Chinese restaurant down the street.
Sherlock chuckled. "I'm coming John!"
So, it's another short chapter. Some of you have asked for more Sherlock/John moments so this is for you.
I did a facepalm. "Mycroft is not fat. You need to get your vision checked."
"I eventually realized you nearly pushing my face into the sand wasn't entirely your fault."
This is a long chapter that wraps up the major parts of The Sherrinford Slayer story. The ramifications, however, will change some lives forever and continue into the following chapters.
John couldn't believe his eyes when he saw Sherlock running to him. John silently had to admit he looked beautiful. He knew he should go back inside, but then Sherlock would follow and everyone would start talking, and he didn't want that. So he stood where he was.
Sherlock continued to stay silent, but he processed Greg's words. He didn't want to be kicked off the serial killer case, and he wanted to be around if he had hope of pursuing John properly. There weren't too many important things in his life, but the things he considered important he couldn't lose.
Officer Morstan's stomach dropped. Sebastian was a known troublemaker, or used to be. He'd settled down in the last 10 months. Still, the boy wasn't totally trustworthy, and it had to do with his hankering for young teenage boys. Nobody ever filed charges against him because his parents were very prominent and very rich, and always came to their son's defense. Sebastian was a very intimidating young man. But there must have been something that attracted little Henry Knight to him, and to his parents' credit, they took in the kid after his family kicked him out. And Henry had been a positive influence on Sebastian.
Sherlock began to walk back to his car. Seconds later, he felt a cool breeze ripple through the air, and he laughed. "I'm not one for the supernatural, but I'm sure that had to be you letting me know everything is going to be okay. Thank you love."
Sherlock lay his book and phone aside and fully embraced his love. "It's going to be paradise John. Today we'll just stay here and order takeaway and relax. Tomorrow is going to be a warm and sunny day, perfect for taking in the new beekeeping exhibit at the Museum of London."
"I hear you're playing last night's broadcast of the sock hop."
Eurus' dress, I had to have the damask print make it's appearance somewhere!
John went to kiss him on the cheek. "Now that you repacked everything to the Holmesian standard."
But he slowly started to get better. With intense therapy, the night terrors weren't as frequent. He was on medication for his depression, and allowed Jim to take him outside every so often for fresh air, and sunshine, when London decided to give it up. They used some of the money to buy a large, first floor three bedroom flat near the financial district so Sebastian could come and go without hindrance. Jim converted one of the extra bedrooms into a personal gym, and Sebastian worked out every day, building his upper body strength back up. He was finally getting in a good place.
John lay on his bed and turned on the alarm clock radio, at first deciding to spend the rest of the day at home, but then he decided he didn't want to waste a beautiful afternoon inside, so he got up, closed his window, and made up his mind to go to Regent's Park to feed the ducks and do some reading under the trees. He would bike there instead of driving his car. He needed to have some alone time. And as he walked to the small shed in his backyard to get his bike, his thoughts of Sherlock and the promise he made melted away like a popsicle on a hot sidewalk.
Outside, a thunderstorm raged, but inside, Sherlock and John were enjoying a romantic bath. John lay back against Sherlock's chest, Sherlock's arms wrapped around his blogger. The only source of light was the candles that sat on a shelf above, casting a dreamy glow.
“Eurus Holmes, and the pleasure’s mine, although my older brother will have even more pleasure seeing you. He’s in the car next to me.” Her smile broadened even wider, and John’s face turned as white as a ghost as she said her name.
Mycroft, Mike, Molly and Lestrade agreed to be witnesses through Skype. Mrs. Hudson insisted she be there in the flat, she'd waited years for her idiot boys to get together. She said she'd wear a mask. And she was already preparing to make the wedding cake. It was originally going to be two tiers, but she scaled it down to two separate one layer cakes: a honey flavored cake with buttercream icing, with piped honeycombs for Sherlock, and spice cake with cinnamon- chai flavored frosting for John. She would pipe dog tags and a cacedus on top of his cake to honor his service as a veteran and a doctor.
John nodded. "Yeah, I felt that too. I'm just so achy and tired."
"Hello John," Sherlock murmurs. He frees a hand to stroke John's cheek with his fingers.
John threw the covers back and started to move. "I can be ready in ten minutes."
Molly's face went white, and she began to feel light-headed. "Oh my God. Please come in."
Werewolf John and Werewolf Sherlock.
"Yeah, he made sure to let everyone know what a great wrestler he was."
John shook his head. "Not at all. We've got a nice suite with a fireplace and we're definitely going to make use of that tub."
"Oh yes. There are quite a few people who get off on having someone dress up a sexy nurse who'll give them scrub baths, wrapping them up in gauze, and putting thermometers in very private places."
Sherlock shook his head. "No we won't. Not with Mycroft in charge. Besides, he knows I'm attracted to you. He actually likes you. Most of the staff drive him completely bonkers. Now, how about a repeat? Preferably back at my flat? And then we can do some more stargazing, just the two of us."
"No Sherlock. You'll get bored, and I have a feeling when you get bored, it's not good."
Sherlock took off his raincoat and hung it up on a rack mounted on their door, then ran a hand through his unruly curls. He joined John on the bed, leaning in for a kiss. John was only too happy to indulge him. Sherlock smiled and the two cuddled together.
Dave Morstan sat in his patrol car on the side of the road by Regent's Park, mentally going through the morning's events. He'd personally delivered the terrible news to Marty and Art's parents. Marty's mother Cassandra had to be sedated, his father Duke had ranted, first at his son for breaking curfew and having a bad attitude, before crumpling in the floor in a sobbing heap. Art's father Nolan was in shock, his mother Florence quietly cried.
John giggled, and Sherlock kissed John's forehead. "Happy Halloween."
John could hear Owen wimper as he increased the pressure of the bullhorn to his genitals. "Steady soldier," he gently chided. "If you don't keep quiet, you don't get to come."
*****
Jim tenderly stroked Eurus' cheek as she slept. He got out of bed and got dressed. He didn't want to do a "fuck and run" as Sebastian Wilkes called it, but he wanted to get home before his parents did.
"I've never been in a relationship before. I just wasn't interested in dating. I had plenty of offers from both girls and guys but I'm happy being single. I never was attracted to anyone." John blushed lightly.
John nodded. "Sure am. I haven't been ice skating since I was a kid. I hope I haven't lost what little skills I gained."
(See the end of the chapter for
Finally, this work is now complete! I hope you enjoyed reading it!
He heard the click and he hung up the phone. Taking a deep breath, he pinched the bridge of his nose and exhaled slowly. Maybe this was a sign, he thought. Maybe Molly could warm up to him, and he could show Sherlock and Eurus there could be a normal relationship in this family.
“What? No way!” John shook his head. “Victor Trevor in love with me? I can’t believe that.”
"Is that why you're dressed as a French maid?" Sherlock questioned with a coy smile.
Sherlock laughed, his first one since coming to Los Angeles. "You give orders so well. You should join the military."
Doctor Jones nodded. "I'll call you Officer Morstan."
He watched the moonlight shine down on the blue tinted water, becoming mesmerized by the ripples of light dancing off the liquid. He had come here a few times with Irene this summer to swim, but found the other teenagers a little to snobbish for his liking.
As Wanda prepared to walk back to recovery, Sherlock barreled through the doors of the waiting room. Everyone turned to look at the tall, lean boy, very startled to say the least. He was wearing light blue pajama bottoms, a thin white cotton T-shirt, and sneakers. His dark curls were plastered to his forehead, and his handsome face was glistening with sweat. His eyes were wide, filled with anxiousness and nervousness. He was breathing heavily.
"So are you."
Mrs. Turner motioned towards a cozy waiting room with plush lavender furniture. John and Warren smiled at her and went to sit down.
John loved it, so Sherpop was the detective's official moniker. Sherlock was her other pop after all, having adopted Rosie after he and John wed. Sherlock soon took a liking to his new name.
"Uh, I don't think I'd be interested in seeking your services," John said sheepishly.
"Touch yourself soldier. Come now," John murmured with a grin, standing up, flexing his toes up and down, feeling the stretch and the burn from his feet to his thighs. He hadn't been on top of someone like that for a long time.
It's Rosie's wedding day, and that means dancing.
Sebastian wheeled himself directly across from John, eagerly anticipating his words and actions.
after you. A young, brilliant, extremely handsome lab assistant. William Holmes. How does that sound?"
The three boys said their goodbyes and parted. John walked to his car. Soon he was the only one in the parking lot, and despite the bright early afternoon sunshine, a shiver crept down his spine. The killer could be anywhere. He could even be watching the school, looking for his next victim---
"And congratulations Sher on finding your new co-star and boyfriend," Irene added teasingly.
"First of all Mrs. Watson, I want to apologize for Sherlock's behavior. He won't come near your son again, I promise," Veronica said firmly.
horrible," Sherlock dryly replied. "I'll go get the candles and the radio. You were wise to put new batteries in it last week."
"Sure."
Jeremy went into the small bathroom, grabbing a small paper cup from the dispenser on the wall, filling it with water from the sink. He put it to Harold's lips and he sucked it down in one gulp. "Thanks."
Jeremy blanched. The police were counting on him to name the killer.
Henry gulped and nodded. "Yes sir."
Victor Trevor, his brother Vincent, Vincent's girlfriend Amy Williams, and Amy's sister Melody walked through the doors. "Hey, there's John," Victor said, making a beeline for his friend. Vincent, Amy and Melody followed and joined the group on the dance floor. John grinned when he saw his friend.
"It's wonderful how the students have taken to you John." Molly leaned in closer to him. "I hear some of the girls have been talking to each other about how hot you are."
Marty looked sharply at Tim. "How do you know the party starts at six?"
*****
John chuckled. "Harry is my
Sherlock smirked. Then he leaned in closer, those catlike eyes of his showing hunger and desire. "I want to kiss you," he murmured.
Sherlock placed his hand in John's and got up off the sand, using his free hand to brush his shorts off. "I'd like that very much."
His phone buzzed, and he picked it up from the coffee table. It was a text from Victor, wishing him goodnight, and asking him if he had a suggestion for their lunch date tomorrow. John thought about it for a bit, then texted him back, asking if they could go somewhere near Regent's Park. It was supposed to be another nice day, and he wouldn't mind a stroll through the park. Victor readily agreed in his text, and told John he'd pick him up around one-thirty.
John pulled her close and pressed a kiss to her cheek. “I don’t want you to be like that. You’re perfect the way you are, and one day a guy will realize that.” He genuinely loved Molly as a friend. They actually did try dating when they first met a year ago, but realized they would better off as best friends. Which was a good thing, as the two worked as carhops at The Big H, a popular hangout for Sherrinford’s teens on weekend nights.
The rest of the day went by smoothly for John. He told his family that he and Sherlock agreed to seeing each other as classmates in school, and he reassured them the worst of it was over. And from there, things started to get normal again. They had leftovers for dinner on the patio, and John retreated to his room to listen to the radio and read. Tomorrow, Wanda would be taking John out to do some back-to-school shopping since Harry had to return back to work at the garage. Everyone was looking forward to the rest of the week being calm and carefree.
"He's in Los Angeles visiting his sister and brother-in-law. He said he wanted to do it before school started." Janine didn't tell Irene the real reason he was there. If she found out John was being harassed by Sherlock Holmes, she would make sure the whole town knew, even though most already did. Irene was a huge gossip. She also knew Irene held a weird fascination with Sherlock, even though he'd never show any sexual interest in her.
John licked his lips and reached up to touch the scar on his left shoulder. He wasn't self conscious about it as Sherlock had already seen it and declared it beautiful. It wouldn't be long before Sherlock arrived, hopefully clad in his form fitting black leather jacket, pants, and motorcycle boots. The detective had shocked John by buying a motorcycle, and he ended up loving riding behind his love, caught up in the speed and the wind rushing through his body as they rode through the London streets and the British countryside. It was dangerous and wildly exciting and it spiked his adrenaline like nothing else. He'd always been a danger junkie. Sherlock had deduced it right away the night they met at St. Bart's, along with John's instant attraction to the genius. Good thing Sherlock was instantly attracted to John as well.
"Want to prepare the breading for the chicken?"
Sherlock was growing restless and irritable. How long did it take to eat fast food anyway? There was a reason they called it fast food. He huffed and pouted. He was ready to stop his stakeout and go explore the city.
Rain was lightly falling and the air was brisk. It was mid November, and John and Rosie were visiting their friend Chris, who ran a nonprofit cat rescue agency out of his home, The Paws Palace. John had quit working at the surgery and spent three half days a week volunteering for the organization, doing intakes on new cats and taking pictures of them for their website. He and Sherlock had discussed adopting a rescue kitten so Rosie, now four and a half, could learn responsibility in taking care of an animal. Rosie had asked for a puppy for her upcoming birthday in January, but Mrs. Hudson didn't want dogs in the building. She was perfectly fine with cats though, so a compromise was reached.
He laughed. "Say no more. I'm going to get the wrapping tape and the meds. Oh, and a set of crutches. Please use them when you're going to the loo or walking around your flat, but not too much walking other than what's necessary. Do you have to go up any steps?"
"That's a frightening thought Sherlock."
John pursed his lips, then he smiled. Maybe an association with a prominent vampire family could be good for him. He looked at Sherlock. "Before you do anything else, you're going to tell me how you knew all of those things about me. Is it some kind of vampire power you have?"
John's face lit up like a lightbulb. "Amazing!"
John took it and seeing Sherlock's large hand in his gave him a shiver, the good kind. Sherlock felt it too. He'd never had this type reaction to touching someone in a long time, not since Victor in uni. But that was a memory long best forgotten. He was living in the present and hoped John would be his future.
He soon learned Cassidy was not the culprit, but he wished he would have been, as a figure dressed all in black, wearing a terrifying fright mask, ambushed him from behind the door that led to their side porch, crazily waving a butcher knife, and lunged towards him. Harold cried out and backed away, then grabbed a canister of flour and hurled it at his attacker, catching him right in the chest. The knife-wielding psycho yelled out in pain and the canister fell to the floor, shattering to pieces, the white powder exploding upwards and all over his black outfit.
Sixty year-old widower John is encouraged by his daughter to create a profile for an online dating site that caters to single older people. In a different part of the country, Sherlock's children are encouraging him to do the same. You know how this will go!
John smiled back. "Are you flirting with me Sherlock Holmes?"
John turned to him. "You're serious? Leave the excitement and bustle of London to retire to the countryside? What would you do to keep yourself occupied?"
She vehemently shook her head. “No. Besides, there’s nothing interesting about me anyway. I’d bore you to tears.”
John was floored, and his mouth dropped open. "You're not serious. You want me to be a...dominatrix?"
John was confused.
Sherlock went limp. "Fine," he huffed. "
John closed the door to the flat, hung his jacket on the coat hook, and stepped out of his shoes. He headed to the kitchen to make himself a cup of tea. Just then, Sherlock emerged from the hallway, wearing his favorite dressing gown over his shirt and slacks. He went into the kitchen and upon seeing John, greeted his husband with a kiss. "Hey," John said, kissing him back. "Want a cup of tea?"
Inside his glass booth, which was built high so it could look down on the dance floor and give a nearly 360 view of the disco, John felt like a king surveying his people. The glass was also bulletproof, which John at first scoffed at, but given the current situation, he was thankful for. In the last several months, a mysterious and dangerous perpetrator had been following women leaving discos and other clubs alone late at night, attacking and beating them into unconsciousness. The press had dubbed the criminal "Discopath." Extra security had been hired at all the establishments, and peoples' bags were searched before they could be let in. So far, Lestrade's had not been targeted, but John figured it was a matter of time before the creep struck here.
As Sherlock regaled to him the exciting details, John lay back on the sofa and smiled, the stress from the last two days slowly beginning to ease away from his both his body and his mind.
Hal Auden's car pulled up beside John, who breathed a sigh of relief at seeing his mom's friend. "Thank God!"
"I'm not surprised you're here, genius. You're obviously waiting for me," John teased.
"Yeah? You gonna show me how much later?" Sebastian teased, planting hot kisses on Henry's neck.
Jim Moriarty and Eurus Holmes had a table to themselves, they were holding hands. John would definitely nominate them for Oddest Couple, if there had been such a contest. The greaser who really wasn't, and the posh weird girl. Even Sherlock barely tolerated his sister's presence. John felt that Sherlock was holding back something when it came to her, but it wasn't his place to pry. He'd felt Sherlock would tell him eventually.
Sherlock sat down on the floor by the bed. "I went to the lab to sleep but woke up to see to Rosie and you. How are you feeling?"
"You goof, why didn't you knock on the front door?" John asked, shaking his head.
John was grinning deviously. “Well Sherlock, since you like blond soldiers so much, perhaps I can fit you in for a little private recruitment. I’ll get your number from Irene since you two are already acquainted.” He nodded at Greg. “Nice meeting you.”
"To a happy new year with new beginnings," John answered brightly.
out of all the Holmes siblings. He'd probably make tons of friends, having the time of his life. A wistful smile crossed Sherlock's lips as he pictured his brother and his easy laugh, the baritone voice just like his, but speaking less cruel words.
Sherlock was flabbergasted at Wanda's kindness. "You'd do that for me?"
"Honestly, I'm not in any hurry, but I need someone a bit more exciting. I may be old but I'm not ready for the grave," John joked.
Victor’s mouth dropped and he sat down across from John, throwing his skates on the floor. “John, why didn’t you tell me this? We should call the police!”
John stretches and gets out of bed, padding over to the window. He looks out through the glass and turns to his daughter, grinning madly. "It sure is. We're gonna be up to our eyeballs in snow."
"Simple. Last time I was here, he was here, and the entire time you were flirting with me, you kept looking over your shoulder and sneaking glances at him to make sure he wasn't hearing any of your attempts at seduction. If you weren't dating him, you wouldn't be doing that."
"She's in a long-term relationship with a very well-off woman."
Molly sat down next to her mom and put her head on her chest. "I love you Mom."
"Police reported they found a single fingerprint on the fake bomb. There was a special report on the TV news about it. She must have saw it and freaked, thinking they'd trace the fingerprint back to her," Sherlock explained."
John went into the bathroom, wincing at the red walls as he soaked a flannel in cold water under the faucet and returned to the bed to hand it to Owen. He'd seen enough red during his days in the Army, he couldn't begin to comprehend why anyone thought it be a good color for a wall. For him, it was like staring at a sky filled with blood.
Victor didn't recognize Sherlock in his Fifth Estate outfit a few chapters back, but recognized Sherlock here because of the heels, and Sherlock was right in front of the restaurant this time as opposed to across the street last time.
Pour the first three ingredients into a glass or a shaker filled with ice. Mix using the shaker or pour from one glass into another until satisfied, with the liquid ending back into the glass with the ice. Squeeze some lime juice around the rim of the glass, then add a little salt to the rim. Then enjoy!
"No guys? I mean, I know you're casually Victor, the photographer..." Luke began.
He thought of Molly. She had tried to placate him at The Big H. He knew she was John’s best friend. If she found out he stopped Sherlock from raping him, perhaps her feelings towards him would change. Always the sociopath. He still didn’t want John to be hurt. He didn’t ask to be an object of the Holmes’ twisted desires, and neither did Molly, but it is what it is.
Mycroft caught Jim at the front door. "Do you know what you're getting into sleeping with my sister?" he asked in a warning tone. "She's not what you think she is. Don't continue to get involved."
Doctor Watson chuckled again. "The nurse filled me in." He looked at the chart he was carrying and then at Sherlock. "Playing hero I see. Which got you a sprained ankle and two cracked ribs. I hear you've been here so many times they're thinking of naming one of the rooms after you."
Sherlock grumbled and muttered to himself. "It's just a cold John."
One door may be closing, but another one is opening, so stay tuned!
"Aren't you the least bit concerned about our brother Mycroft?" she asked in a tone that was definitely not concern.
After putting on his boots, he went to his girlfriend and bent down, kissing her gently on the forehead. "I don't want to leave, but I have to. I'll come over tomorrow if you want. Goodnight."
"Bye Sher. Looking forward to it." John watched him leave, admiring his long, lean frame, before sitting down and getting to work.
The two paid it no mind and went back to the movie. The infamous murder scene was about to happen. The shower curtain was suddenly pulled open, the knife raised, and as the first screech of the violin screamed out, all of a sudden the living room and kitchen windows in the flat were illuminated with white-blue light, and then everything went dark.
"We know Dad, as you've told us ever since we could walk and talk. But give this a chance, at least for us," Theo pleaded. "I think you have a great chance at finding someone good. Lord knows you need it after the disaster that was Sebastian Wilkes."
Victor waved to John. "Hi John."
"I will John." There was a pause, and then Mrs. Holmes spoke again, but with a quivery voice, almost whispering. "Thank you."
Doctor Watson looked at us like we had three heads. "Uh, you had to be there," I said sheepishly.
Sherlock blinked, then grabbed John's hand, just holding it. "Sh-Sh-Sherlock Holmes," he stuttered.
"Yes, and they already know. The worst part of my job is when I have to tell someone their loved one passed away."
As afternoon approached, he and Harry dried off and headed for the boardwalk to get lunch. They found a pizza parlor with picnic tables and umbrellas with a view of the beach. As they sat and ate, the spooky feeling returned and John began looking around.
"I thought our date was Saturday night," John said with a smile.
The officer smiled. "The matchbook has writing on it. It looks like it's from a restaurant or a bar."
"You look great. Besides, it's your birthday, wear what you want. I'm not dressed up," John cheerily replied, pointing to his jeans and plaid button down.
Luke gave him a coy smile. "Sounds like more than friend."
He would simply become one of his clients.
"You're cute when you're irritated."
"It's a date Sherlock Holmes."
"I'm glad everything turned out okay," John said.
"We won't know anything until the fire is put out and our guys start investigating, but my experience tells me it's arson too. What kind of nut would want to do something so heinous?" Jody replied.
"Just be there for her Henry, and be there for Sebastian. You're a strong kid. You've been through a lot of things most teenagers wouldn't even think about," Dave replied sincerely.
"Thank you soldier. Remain quiet."
"Oh yes, I remember now. Go on John."
Friday morning, it was overcast, but dry. Wanda frowned after listening to the weather forecast on the radio calling for heavy rain later tonight, but at least she'd be home and not out in the mess. And John still wasn't feeling that great, but he could be left alone at home while she was at work. She called the school to let them know John still had the virus and he would be back Monday. She learned the head secretary was now out sick with it, as well as the vice-principal.
Sherlock couldn't get to his bike fast enough.
"Makes getting up in the morning and going to bed at night much less stressful. Now if I could just sort out Donovan...." Greg answered with a chuckle.
Quick and dirty chapter. All I can say is, don't mess with Mrs. Hudson! We also get a little BAMF Mary too, and some interaction between the Holmes siblings. There's backstory for Sherlock which gives a little insight as to why he's such a messed-up sixteen year-old.
John returned with a bottle of chilled sparkling apple cider and two flute glasses. Harry had sent John some bottles of it along with a basket of smoked sausages, cheeses, and chocolates as her Christmas present. She'd been sober for three years and John couldn't have been more prouder of his older sister.
John nodded. "Yes. He told me Sheridan drowned. I'm sorry."
Mrs. Doyle was surprised to see John back early, but after hearing what happened after his dinner date, she was doubled over in stitches with laughter. It was a crazy and hilarious story, even if it involved John being stalked by Sherlock. But John didn't think he was in any danger anymore, and deep down a part of him felt a little flattered an attractive, slightly younger man thought he was interesting enough to follow. However, he had to nip it in the bud. Irene and Molly weren't amused at Sherlock's antics, and he didn't want to jeopardize his new job. He was going to have to pay a visit to Sherlock and tell him to stop following him around town.
John's eyes widened in surprise. "Really? Wow! You look pretty young to be doing that kind of work.
Mrs. Stubbs spoke up again. "Here are your four candidates for Culverton Smith High Homecoming King of 1961! Victor Trevor, Andy Garrideb, Tim Carlton, and Jim Moriarty."
Janine's mom Barbara, and Linda Stamford walked out from the other side of the cabana. "We could call the police boys," Barbara announced firmly. "What do you think Linda?"
For this story, although it's set in current times John and Sherlock are the ages they were in S1.
Sherlock huffed again and John giggled, bending down slightly to ruffle his alpha’s curls. “Oh come on, it’s not like I’m in the army and in another country away from you. It’s just once a week for an hour and a half at the new coffee shop. I made sure to pick a place that was safe, and no tutoring during my heat.” John pressed a kiss to the top of Sherlock’s head. “Besides, Sebastian’s crazy over an omega. He wouldn’t even look twice at me even if I wasn’t bonded.”
"Wow, really? Glad to be of help," Gordie replied, somewhat flabbergasted.
He had a close circle of acquaintances, most were smart kids like him focused on school, and some of them were on the Homecoming Committee, so he was glad to represent "the brains." He and Eurus would show up to the old smelly gym for the dance, dressed to the nines, showing everyone who was boss. He told Eurus she was his queen, and she giggled so prettily he couldn't help but plant kisses all over her face and body. She was no saint, but he genuinely cared for her. More people needed to care for her, as her parents and brothers weren't doing that good of a job. She had issues, but so did everyone else. And she wasn't going around slicing up people to death, like that crazy Sherrinford Slayer.
Sherlock didn’t say anything, he just nodded. Now wasn’t the time to make a smart comeback. He knew he dodged a bullet.
John sat at the picnic table at The Big H, doing his chemistry homework. Luckily it wasn't too difficult, thanks to Sherlock's help. Sherlock was a natural, finding the subject material easy as pie. He had passed a note to John during class that said "BORED!" on it. John just rolled his eyes. He could tell Sherlock was itching to interrupt Mr. Turing several times during his lecture, but John had passed a note back to him that said "Don't even think about it. Mr. Turing knows his stuff. You just want to show off. If you want that after-school grope keep quiet."
"They were told if they went after Molly or anyone else they'd be banned from Homecoming," Mike added. "Looks like that's gonna happen."
"Are you absolutely sure?" Janine asked. Sherlock may have an analytical mind but physically he's all alpha. He'd go crazy with lust seeing you posing in a naughty Christmas outfit."
"I will Mom. See you soon."
The teens heard the front door open. "It's Mom," John said, heading for the living room.
John's phone is on the nightstand and Christmas carols are quietly playing from the small speaker on the bottom. Right now it's Silent Night, a bit appropriate.
"So many people don't really know why we do what we do. They assume it's all about sex. It is, but we've got bills and taxes to pay just like them. Look, why we don't we meet back up before the party ends and exchange numbers. I think my husband would love to talk to you. I think he would like meeting someone that has had similar experiences. It would cheer him up a bit."
"Pan seared perch over rice with steamed broccoli, and lemon sorbet for dessert," John replied brightly.  I found the recipe online and it sounded heavenly."
Mrs. Watson was floored at his answer. "Is that how you're trying to explain away them being pint-sized psychopaths?"
“You called the police and told them I was going to John’s.”
"At least John's going to make it. And I didn't want to kill Wilkes. He needs to survive and pay for what he did," James said ruefully.
"A shirt. He prefers a check pattern."
"Oh I am serious. They wanted so much to be with us tonight, might as well be friendly. But there's a catch. You're all sopping wet and you'll need a change of clothes. I'm sure my mom and I can spare something." She smiled deviously.
The detective undressed his blogger, and John picked out his RAMC shirt and a pair of boxers to wear. Sherlock helped him into his clothes and got him into bed, fluffing up pillows. He gently placed the back of his hand on John's forehead. "It doesn't feel too hot, so your fever must have went down a bit."
"John, they're absolutely beautiful. Why would you even think I'd hate them?"
"Some tea would be great, thanks."
"Because I'm not going to lower myself by publicly pursuing Molly at a god forsaken community center," Mycroft huffed.
The crowd eagerly anticipated John's arrival. None of them apart from Gregory and Mycroft had seen John dance. They never frequented the other clubs fearing it would damage their reputation. Well, there was one exception.
"Molly, what on God's earth possessed you to go off by yourself, and all the way downtown!" Sylvia Hooper reprimanded her daughter. She'd just learned what happened to her with Carl Powers Sr.
John was sitting in front of Sherlock, his back to the other boy's chest. Sherlock's long legs were wrapped around John's waist, feet in his lap, and his arms were wrapped around John's chest.
All Sherlock could do was turn his head away and blush prettily.
Sherlock huffed and leaned back in his seat. "Don't mock me. I have a very serious problem. I can't get involved with John. It would be beneficial for me not to pursue a relationship with him."
"Ah Sherlock, glad to see you," Irene cooed as she entered the office, descending from a white spiral staircase, fashionably dressed in a black leather pencil skirt, cream-colored cashmere crewneck sweater framed with a simple diamond pendant, and black Louboutin heels. Her long brown hair was swept up into a loose bun.  Molly was right behind her, in charcoal gray dress slacks, a matching blazer, red silk blouse, and red pumps, her hair also up in a bun which was a little tighter.
"Oh, so it's Greg now? Any other time, it's George, or Graham, or Gavin."
John entered the campus coffee shop, Coffee, Tea, & Thee, letting out a sigh of relief at feeling the warmth radiate from inside. The shop wasn't as busy as other nights thanks to the chilly rain, but a few customers, mostly students, were sitting at tables, in chairs, and on the couches that took up the other half of the cafe.
"Mmm," John replied. "This has been a wonderful day."
I laughed. "I had a feeling that would happen."
John chuckled again and stroked Sherlock's dark curls. "Mrs. Hudson knew what she was doing when she got me this blanket last Christmas. I'll have to get one just for you."
Sherlock doesn't think he's that sick. John disagrees. A very short, fluffy fic.

The waiter returned with John's drink and took their orders. John chose Molly's recommendation, and Irene ordered veal saltimbocca.
The two girls were in the hallway when they heard Molly's dad arguing with someone. "I've told you, you are not allowed anywhere near Molly! She's perfectly happy with Greg Lestrade! Now leave before I call the police!" Pete Hooper shouted.
The other man shook his head. And he's not one of your clients?" Victor asked as he polished a lens.
Mystrade appears in the next chapter to knock some sense into Sherlock.
"Not only is it good, the owner gives me meals for free. I helped him get out of a murder charge by proving he was robbing a house at the time the killing occured."
He nodded. "But I could say the same about policework."
It was Jim that grew angrier, grew darker, grew murderous. He couldn't hunt down and kill the bastard who tried to ruin his lover's life, but he could strike out at those like him. Those short little blonds who looked and acted like the world revolved around them and could get away with anything. It was so easy to pretend to be a male escort and set up dates, and then he struck. He'd already done two, drugging them with GHB, torturing them slowly and painfully before finally ending their miserable lives with the sharp blade of a knife. By getting rid of them, he was doing what he wasn't able to over a year ago. A psychiatrist would label him as a homicidal maniac suffering from transference, but he wasn't crazy. He knew exactly what he was doing. He was making sure the man he loved more than anything would no longer suffer, and his mind could finally be at ease.
John looked to Molly. "What do you think?" he asked his friend.
"How dare you!" Molly screamed. "You're just like your son! A bully and a thug! How dare you blame Carl's death on me! He should have been home, and not out past curfew! If he would have stayed home, he would be alive!"
Molly was unfazed. Her best friend was bisexual after all. "I wouldn't be surprised. She was cheating on Greg, and it was probably with Kate."

John happily licked his spoon clean. "That was some of the best ice cream I've ever had. Thank you Sophie and Theo. Sherlock is lucky to have two great cooks."
"Have you checked Your Turn yet?" Rosie asked excitedly.
"He's deceased, your father," Sherlock mused.
"Well, Juliet was Romeo's sun, and you're my sun. And you are smaller and fairer than I am." Sherlock playfully mocked.
The man smiled. "Hi, I'm Vic. Nice to meet you."
After dinner, Sherlock and John were snuggled up on the couch together under an old bedspread, listening to the radio. Wanda had retired to her room to do some reading and talk with Hal on the phone, relaying how their days went, and making final plans for their date tomorrow evening, after she cleaned the kitchen and the bathroom. The predicted heavy rain had begun, creating a cozy and calm atmosphere in the Watson home.
Back with an update! Just a short chapter with Sherlock being Sherlock.
"Thanks. I borrowed the threads from Clarence's sister, seeing as how I never dress like this." She stepped inside and hugged her brother.
Rosie was happily babbling as John entered he and Sherlock's room. She immediately held out her arms when she saw Sherlock. "Papa!"
Harry grinned madly. "Definitely, little brother. It's not everyday I get to see you strutting around in heels and a maid's outfit."
Doctor Jones took the men all the way down to the end of the hallway. "These are the private rooms. Mrs. Wilkes is in room three." He softly knocked on the door, then opened it.
"Me too." She pecked him on the cheek. Be careful going home."
"Cassidy, you silly ball of fur, what have you destroyed now?" Harold wondered out loud as he got up and started for the kitchen.
Molly winced but held her ground. "I wasn't the one who chopped him up with the ax. So let go of my wrist and leave me alone, or I will go to the principal. You've gotten away with bullying others before, but this time you're done." She tried to release his painful grip, but to no avail.
*****
John stood up, holding out his hand to Sherlock. "Would you like to walk along the beach with me? And maybe later, I could introduce you to my sister and her girlfriend, go out for a bite to eat."
The two stopped in front of a door marked TEACHERS LOUNGE - NO STUDENTS ALLOWED. Molly opened it, still holding onto John, who felt apprehensive and nervous. He gripped the handle of his lunch sack tight.
“Thank you, John. It’s nice of you to notice! So tell me, little brother, what do you do these days?”
“Papa, read to me? Please?”
Sherlock visibly withered from the verbal assault.
“I do. And I... Seeing how happy she is...” Molly smiled, one of her smiles that always looked a little sad. “... I'm starting to understand why you left. Never heard her talk so much, she used to be so quiet.”
John’s plan had backfired on him, he had wanted to take his time, but a begging, excited and very enthusiastic Sherlock was impossible to rein in. He felt his own control diminish, his cock engorged and nearly painful, pulsing against his pants.
But then, then John saw the black body bags and Violet Holmes, with blood on her clothes, crying and shouting at every person trying to take her away from it. It was open and John could see the face of another man...
Sherlock chuckled and followed her to the kitchen.
“Not exactly, no”
“Sarah wants to meet. You’ll come?” Asked John.
“It’s… It’s the Peter Harrison Planetarium! How… Why…” John would never have guessed that of all the places Sherlock would choose, he would take him to the stars.
“Jooohn, please, clothes! Take… off!”
“She would have you...”
“No.” Mycroft smiled bitterly. “Tell Dr Watson you are interested.”
“Daddy is very clever!” Leanna felt obliged to defend her daddy’s.
They visited John, Sarah and Molly every day and Leanna was already calling their small room their hospital home. Both the doctor and the omegas tried to make the situation as easy as possible for Leanna and Sherlock appreciated it. They didn’t have to. They were still unsure if their babies would survive.
“Of course John, we will play together, I will make your favourite cake, okay sweetheart?”
