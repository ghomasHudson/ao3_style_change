John falters, for just a split moment, but manages to save himself. “It’s been good.”
Sherlock takes his hands, tugs him along, with a ravenous look in his eyes. He walks them to his bedroom, and once again begins to kiss John, biting at his lip and purring every few moments.
Sorry for the long wait for this one... The semester at school was pretty busy for me. Hopefully it's not too cringeworthy. I'm also hoping that I will be able to post a bit more regularly, but even if I can't, I promise I won't forget this project!
Almost three weeks after their last tryst, he’s called to make a consultation with a surgeon at St. Bart’s. He schedules the meeting for early in the morning, knowing there’s no chance Sherlock would be on the floor at that time to see him.
“Yes, I know very well,” he practically growls back, marching hurriedly across the street to where the man is. John freezes in horror.
It doesn’t take John long to grow used to his new life, despite what everyone he tells this to believes. Chasing criminals, sleuthing about crime scenes, the long nights without sleep… It’s oddly comforting for him. He craves the danger, the adrenaline of running for his life that was so common in Afghanistan, but now, there’s a way out. After each case he’s allowed to go to bed and sleep, without fear of a bomb going off while he rests.
They shake right hands, the customary greeting, all while glancing to the other’s Watch, to see how close they were. John saw that Mike’s is blacked out. He’s already found his Soulmate. Despite knowing how ridiculous it is, an adolescent feeling of jealousy fills him. That feeling of
“I dunno,” I say honestly, my mouth full.
But, then again, perhaps Sherlock felt no guilt. He had no Soulmate, no poor woman he was letting down. Why not commit a sin, if nothing is keeping you from doing so? Perhaps he was trying to punish the very government that had denied him a chance at happiness, by becoming as corrupt as possible for them.
It suddenly occurs to me that even such a small pot roast as this costs a handful of ration cards, something a woman like Mrs. Hudson probably would not take lightly, given the modesty of the rest of the home.
Four--
“And then you get to live happily ever after?”
. He can’t think about his Soulmate right now, not while he’s trying to keep him and Sherlock out of jail.
“Nonsense?” John shakes his head. “It’s not nonsense. How could it be nonsense?”
“Sherlock…” John sighs, after his laughs have faded.
Sherlock was more guarded, but he said a few things of his own. The bullies of his childhood, his drug use when he was in university, and his early exploits with Greg when the latter was just starting his career. His family was off limits for discussion, but even without that, yes, John could understand what Sherlock meant. Little insights to how he grew up, how he became who he was.
I turn to the glass over the sink, realising that it’s a mirror, and examine myself for the first time that I can remember.
The pain roars back - I seethe in agony. I groan and lean against the cool, brick wall, trying to ignore the throbbing. I run a hand through my hair, and feel a thick wetness. I put my hand in front of my eyes, try to see it in the darkness...It’s a dark liquid.
With that, the lift doors open to the mortuary, and John stands stunned for a moment as Sherlock strides out, confident as ever.
The detective stumbles back with a gasp, and he stares at John, his breath hyperventilating now. His eyes flicker over John for a single moment before charging at him again, throwing them both into the wall and kissing him so hard it hurts.
, knows that--” his breath catches for a moment, “I love you.”
“No! Don’t tell me this is all going to be okay! It’s not! This is wrong! Everything that we did is illegal, wrong, sinful, unnatural --” Oh Christ, he sounded like his eighth year gym teacher, and where the hell was Sherlock going now? “We’d deserve all the treatment we get when they lock us up!” He just about screams at Sherlock’s back, who now is in the kitchen.
The door to the B flat is closed, but unlocked he discovers as he shoves it open.
Jesus Christ, the only thing that’s missing is his chair.
John squeezes his eyes shut, but he’s forced to open them when Sherlock touches his chin, and draws his chin up.
he thinks as he runs up the stairs, his heart pounding.
“Is that your real name?”
They’re out of breath, and John’s lips are cracked and aching, but somehow it manages to work. John bites, sucks, digs his nails into Sherlock’s shoulders, doing everything he can to take as much as he can of the detective, and the other does the same, keeping John’s head in place as he explores the doctor’s mouth with his tongue.
What happened to them? What
Sherlock ignores him. The word is second nature to him by now, a drop in the ocean.
“No, but you’re very distressed and that isn’t going to help,” Sherlock sighs. “I’m upset too, but we need to keep our heads. Panic is what he wants.”
But it’s normal. It is not strange to have homoerotic dreams, fantasies, that are wonderful and arousing while in them, only to become awkward and strange once the subject has woken up.
A light switches on in the window across from me. I still am unable to hear anything, but within a few moments a woman steps into view. My gaze gravitates towards her distractedly. She’s attractive, that much I can see, even from this distance. Blonde, pale, on the shorter side, very shapely. She’s nearly naked, wearing only a black bra, and black underwear with stockings.
“Lestrade wants paperwork done,” he sighs in annoyance. “Our thief has survived, fortunately, but the SWAT team has made quite a mess of the galleries. The museum is not happy, and wants some proof that this was the only way to catch the criminal.” He huffs, and flops down on the bed beside John once more. “Which will be difficult, because it wasn’t.”
He can’t help but feel a bit envious, though. Whatever the two men are after, it sounds fascinating. Would it be odd to ask Sherlock about it when he comes back? He wonders as he collapses in one of the chairs, wincing at his leg.  It isn’t fair. Most days his leg hurt more than his shoulder, which infuriated him to no end.
It would be hell.
“Then why the playing?” He found his own voice was soft too, as if speaking louder would break something.
“But she was able to find something to kill herself with.”
John stays silent, glancing toward the exit if he needs it.
“It’s all of it!” Sherlock shouts, his voice almost a roar. “It’s
Sherlock stands, presumably to apprehend Mr. Jefferson, but John takes a few steps towards him, his gun still drawn. The driver’s tone of voice has shifted, he sounds dangerous now, like a suicide bomber holding a girl hostage, or someone who had easily killed four people…
It’s a few days later that he realizes what’s odd about Sherlock’s appearance. He’s so used to seeing it, that it’s completely unexpected to see it not there.
“I’m sorry?” Her voice becomes almost shrill. “How did you know about that?!”
She grew up in a small town. She was popular. She has a lot of friends. She likes flowers.
When the clinic closes, and he finishes signing off his paperwork, he decides to head over to Baker Street. It’s been an entire day after all, Sherlock at the very least has to be done with his tantrum by now.
Soon the other returns with a glass of water, and hands it to John. John narrows his eyes, and Sherlock pauses, realising John’s hesitation. He takes a sip of the water himself, then holds out the glass once more.
“I didn’t find any cameras in the flat,” Sherlock continues. “But… we both already know that perhaps he prefers to watch through far off windows.”
Yet there was what Greg had said. That he still was in bad shape. And Mrs. Hudson had said his tantrum had lasted almost a full day. He must have been in a lot of pain. But even through that pain, he’d still folded all of John’s clothes and had been careful to not break his grandfather’s pocket watch, taking all the precautions while still throwing John to the street.
Throughout the entire night, John stares at his watch. 70d12h32m. It could just be him, but he could swear the numbers shine just the slightest bit more tonight. But the Watches run on the iron in blood, and his heart has been pounding out of his chest for hours. He could just imagine the quick surging pulse powering the gears, sending it into overdrive.
Oof. Hope you guys don't mind this one. It's longer and is in a different style than the other chapters. But the more I wrote, the more Sherlock became a man who spent his whole life running from his past, and suddenly he has to confront it.
“Nothing,” he mutters immediately, setting the mobile on the table and going back to his search. He doesn’t say anything more, and John huffs.
He doesn’t identify as gay. Throughout his teenage years and his early adult life, when anyone asks him his orientation he replies with ‘homosexual.’
when you’re with her? How does it feel when you fuck her? It’s certainly an easier name to call out!”
Either way, John refuses, and Sherlock never shows any indication that it actually occurred.
In the afterglow, it all feels hazy. Sherlock mutters something to him, and he finds himself taking off his shirt, Sherlock groans and bucks against his fist, and he looks like an angel, his back arched and his eyes closed, mouth open in ecstasy.
And apparently, God had listened.
John hadn’t been that lucky. In one instant, when he was fifteen and on holiday with his family, the watch had managed to get down to 3d15h32m (he’d memorized the number). He was ecstatic, bursting full of all the romantic movies he had seen of this, planning what he would wear in three days, when he saw her, how he would act, what he would say to her.  But the following morning, it had jumped back to 183 days. The vacation was ruined, and John moped for the rest of the week.
Do you feel
Mike introduces John, and John reaches out a hand, his eyes on the pale, bony wrist that snakes its way from the table and takes John’s hand firmly. The way the man moves his hand, however, keeps the back of his hand up, making his palm, and his Watch on his wrist, invisible to John.
John lets out a slow breath, and nods despite himself. How can he turn down such a logical and well argued plan? “Yes, I can do that.”
It’s slower. Sherlock insists on that, and prepares him at a tortuous pace. The feeling of a finger inside him is a jarring one, but John gets used to it fairly quickly, and it takes far too long for Sherlock to add a second finger, grazing John in a place that makes him gasp and jump off the bed.
When it’s eaten, John moves to his respective chair, and Sherlock goes to play the violin.
Sherlock smiles softly. “Because of that.”
John blinks in surprise, realizing as Sherlock mentioned it that his shoulders were indeed square and pressed back at that moment. He hardly had the time to correct it before the other begins speaking again.
Finally Sherlock’s dot stops, and the cab pulls up to where it’s frozen. John gets out, and feels his heart sink. Two buildings right next to each other, perfectly identical, too close to differentiate on the police monitor.
“Hi,” she sighs. “How was your day?”
His mobile buzzing around eleven makes him jolt to attention. He grabs it on instinct, but when he sees Sherlock’s name on the sender, he immediately pockets it once more. No, he doesn’t want to think about that aspect of all of this right now.
And, it occurs to him what a terrible place Lestrade is stuck in, between his love and her infidelity. He can’t very well turn in his own Soulmate to his own department, and short of that, his only option is to stay with her, and hope that perhaps she’d see the error of her ways on her own.
That cathartic presence helped him as he was bored to tears during his medical exams, kept his mind focused on the future when his father died, kept him sane and on the ground during those sleepless, painful nights when he contemplated jumping out of his bedroom window because living hurt so damn much.
It’s well into thursday night when he tiptoes up the stairs, and peeks inside. The flat is dark. He squints, and notices that Sherlock’s coat and scarf aren’t on the rack, meaning that the detective is out. His deductive skills are getting better.
Mary laughs, a reaction he was not expecting. “That’s ridiculous!” she says. “They shut down the space program before the New Revolution! Where would you have learned how to be an astronaut?”
. The memory of their first case sends shivers down John’s spine. How long had Moriarty been watching Sherlock?
Something rushes through John, and he can’t be here anymore. There’s something in the air, this room is dangerous, he cannot be here any longer because if he stays something might happen.
John follows after Sherlock as he brushes off more policemen, shock slowly settling in after that ordeal.
There’s a smaller fear in visiting Baker Street that Moriarty could still be lurking, practicing his voyeurism act for whatever purpose he had. Sherlock said that the other would not go to the police and so far this turned out to be true, but what if him visiting Sherlock once more spurned something new in the madman? Convinced him that John was as filthy as the acts they did?
But John still can’t help being terrified. The first few sirens that blare past Baker Street make him jump, and his dream that night (in his own bed) is of Lestrade finding them, naked, curled up like they were on the couch, and throwing them in jail, where Moriarty, the man from the government, approaches them slowly.
Pocketing the tag, I glance about the area once more, taking a moment to glance up towards the grate. It’s too small to have dumped a body of his stature through, so that would eliminate that option. However, there’s no other entrance to the sewers nearby. How did the body even get here? It seems odd that someone would purposefully place him right below the grate, as well. It would take quite a lot of effort, instead of just throwing the corpse by the opening, wherever that is.
It was a distraction, a catharsis. At age six, the numbers on the contraption began to tick downwards, and he had squealed in the middle of his arithmetic class. They had found her!
He loves women. He loves their curves, their scent. He loves making love to them, hearing their soft moans and sighs as he moves in them.
It’s more effective than antidepressants, at least.
Then John H. Watson limps into his life, and takes control of it at more or less the exact velocity of a bullet speeding through a window into a cab driver’s chest.
He stares at the numbers, for a moment unable to understand them.
“I...” she mouths, her eyes widening and darting around confusedly. She looks rather like a fish out of water. “Who are you? How did you get in here?”
John still remains silent.
“I’m sorry?” Anderson asks, looking extremely surprised, yet still standing his ground. “What?”
In that time, Sherlock is left to himself, to destroy and kill himself, alone. Which he does, for four and a half years. He lives on the streets, injects himself whenever he deems fit, and solves the occasional puzzle when it is available.
“Lestrade does!”
He heads down the street to where the shops are, where all the doctors and nurses end up after their shifts and during their break.
How the fuck did people do that?
He keeps kissing John as he undoes his own belt and trousers. John can feel Sherlock’s fist graze across his stomach and the small jump of his hips, starting to pump and get himself off. The detective pulls away and buries his face in John’s neck, gasping and grunting softly.
He can't have him, because he's in love with Mary, and is marrying her.
Breaking up was always easy. There were rarely hard feelings. After all, how could any girl claim to be led on when both of their timers were still ticking down?
Sure enough, there’s the madman himself. His back is to John, and he’s facing the window, looking like a statue except for the careful movement of his elbow. All of John’s anger suddenly fades at the sight.
Sherlock’s smile slips, just the slightest bit. “I can figure that out as well,” he says, raising a testy eyebrow. “I’ll contact you when I have all of that, and I assume this is all you need me for?” He starts heading towards the exit, and John follows like the obedient puppy he is.
God... he wants him. He needs him.
Sherlock chuckles, and crawls up onto the bed, undoing the buttons of his shirt as he does so.
John scowls, but relents, and takes a slow sip. “This conversation isn’t over, Sherlock!” he snaps, his blood still boiling. “Tea doesn’t make this better!” He stops, finding that he has to take another sip with how hoarse his voice feels
Sherlock’s eyes shut, and a soft smile graces his features. “I love you too.”
“I’m going to need some blue eyes, Molly,” Sherlock says, ignoring her request. “Green, if there’s nothing else. Preferably nearsighted, but farsighted will also do. Just definitely not--”
But, as I hear the wind and rain pick up once again outside, I decide that staying at least one night here would not hurt.
“You impregnated her,” Sherlock guesses, sounding intrigued.
The dreams return, but they’re different. A combination from the darkest time in his life, and the brightest.
“And when?” one of the other inspector’s snaps.
And Sherlock watches as an attachment forms, each and every time, and whatever relationship there had been before was completely destroyed.
“Sherlock…” he gasps desperately, squirming. “Sh-Sherlock…”
Sherlock drops his head, his chest still heaving. John stares at him, his doctor’s instincts tingling to take over, to check if he’s alright.
“Now, I’m Mrs. Hudson,” she says kindly, smiling reassuringly but staring at my bloodied head with worry. “And what’s your name, young man?”
Mary gets home from work late, and she collapses at the dinner table with the leftovers John has left her, not even bothering to heat them up.
Sherlock shakes his head. “Not about this,” he says. “But… He’s playing at something. Obviously his ploy with you this morning was some part of the game to him. But I have no idea what his goal is at the end of it. He has everything he needs to destroy me but he hasn’t.”
But John... he’s accepted him. He’s stayed. He’s stayed through Sherlock’s hissy fits, through his keeping eyes in the fridge and through his random changes in emotion. He has stayed as Sherlock roared his anger at the world.
John turns to Moriarty, who is as usual wearing his pressed suit, with a scarlet red tie. Now that he’s so close to the other, John can also smell his cologne, a sickeningly sweet floral scent that makes him want to step away, yet also figure out which flower it was infused with.
“I would suffer through daily torture, be torn to shreds, only to wake up anew and go through the pain once more, if only to give you happiness.”
He manages to hail a taxi, and spends the entire ride panting in the back seat. He stares out the window to watch the people who are still lost, still believing what was being told to them.
Mike gives him a pitying look, one that makes John cringe, and he quickly tries to come up with something else to say that can save him from that damn look.
All of John’s blood runs cold. That can’t be true, can it? A child,
The nurse blinks at me. “St Bart’s. How do you not know that?” she sounds incredulous. I suppose when someone sneaks into a hospital, they ought to at least know which one. As I near the door, she hurries back to it, pressing her back to it to keep me from leaving. “No! I--I’m not going to let you leave. Tell me who you are!”
But soon it’s all settled, with the suspect apprehended relatively easily (it only took one large chase scene across the vast estate, and the only injury on their end is John’s scraped knees after tackling him), and John finds he’s enjoying this peaceful walk home. It’s just at the peak of afternoon, before the sun will start leaving the sky, and Sherlock is still discussing the case, how Mr. Gretchen had made a fool of himself, for didn’t he know that his sister-in-law would never leave anywhere without her beloved Yorkie?
Sherlock just rolls his eyes, flopping down beside John and curling up into him. He’s silent for now, as if his voice was stolen from him--another small respite.
“Yes, but you’ll take the case?” Greg prompts.
(See the end of the chapter for
He huffs, waiting for some response, some reaction that can make him yell again, but instead all Sherlock does is get something out of the cupboard, and pour hot water into John’s mug with whatever tea he’s found.
“Certainly,” Sherlock shrugs. “I enjoy your company, John, whether or not you happen to be clothed.”
John blinks. “What do you mean?”
A flash of rage rushes through John. “You want me to spy on my flatmate?” he asks incredulously. “That's ridiculous! I have no idea what your deal is with Sherlock, but he's done nothing that egregious!”
I walk down the hall as casually as I can, whilst wearing wrinkled clothes and no shoes. Through a few people turn their heads as I pass, I manage to find the exit without anyone calling out or demanding me to stop. Upon attempting to open it, I discover it’s much heavier than I am used to. For bomb threats, I think, to keep the doors from blowing in.
On one of these ridiculous errands, about three weeks after their initial case, John has to submit Sherlock’s will, and, of all things, return a library book. It wasn’t as if he has any desire to do such, of course, but Sherlock’s mobile had been ringing constantly with reminders from the library, something that the detective didn’t seem to notice or care, but for John, there was a set number of times he could hear the bridge to the hideous pop song Sherlock had as his ringtone, without him going on a murderous rampage, and that limit was approaching very soon.
John can’t help but feel his own temper rising now. Why could Sherlock never fucking
“And, another thing--” Sherlock turns to John as he approaches, and huffs. “Stop kidnapping my flatmates!”
“Yes,” he says slowly, nodding his head. “Right.”
John clears his throat. He turns around, but Anthea is nowhere to be seen. “Sorry? Who are you?”
He’s getting the hang of the Soulmate life, or at least he is until another message from Greg comes in:
“I think you know,” the woman says smugly, not looking up from her monitor this time. “Or, who, would be a more correct choice of words.”
“Why, John, you haven’t tried your cuppa yet!” Moriarty exclaims, tutting. “Come now, don’t you trust me? It’s a very good cup.”
Mrs. Hudson nods, her look still just as sad as before. “Sometimes the only thing you can do is leave them be, and wait until he’s ready to reach out to you,” she says. “Even if that time never comes.”
The worst part, however, is that when he grabbed the book in question (a thick, terribly boring looking war epic with some busty woman on the cover, which Sherlock has clearly never touched since bringing it home), and fished out some notes from the detective’s wallet, the infuriating man glanced up from his mobile, raised an eyebrow, and said, in that smug, darkly velvet voice of his,
“Mm, but that’s how the London Fire started, you know,” John teases, wiggling his way out of Sherlock’s grasp at last. “Don’t want that.”
He glances around the crime scene. Everyone looks rather put out at the anti-climatic turn of events. Except for John, who smiles at Sherlock through his soldier’s mask.
The ride home is a difficult one. With the oxytocin leaving his body, John is forced to look over his actions sober, face what he has done.
“Precisely,” Sherlock nods. “But there are some lesser known galleries. Even less security on those, I’m rather surprised those weren’t hit up first. Given the criminal’s habits, I can give you the location he’ll be in next within the night.”
Before he can apologize, Sherlock speaks again. “There were two other mics,” he says. “One in my bedroom, one in yours. One of the utility men Mrs Hudson hired must have been a plant.”
Sherlock shrugs, and turns back to the window, not wanting to say
The statement crashes into John violently, coupled with the casual way Sherlock says it.
Sherlock hasn’t questioned him about his odd behavior, although John is certain that it must be obvious. But he’s noticed that Watches seem to be Sherlock’s weakness; the man never checks anyone’s Watch while they’re out, even when they’re on a case, even when Sherlock is trying to think of motive. Yet to John it seemed so important. Wouldn’t knowing if someone had a Soulmate, or if they were days away from meeting her, affect whether the person was a suspect or not? Very few people would commit murder a week before they’re destined to meet their Soulmate, after all.
Which doesn’t mean that John takes great joy in telling him that Harry is actually his sister. Sherlock’s gorgeous expression changes to annoyance, to frustration, back to annoyance. John can’t help but laugh as the car pulls up at the kerb.
When he glances up, he swears he can see a touch of a smile on Sherlock’s lips. “Neither do I,” he says.
“I was called, they did their examination, took one look at my wrist, and dismissed me,” he explains. “I’m often surprised that no one else notices that bit, I don’t have any sort of military personality that most men do.”
Besides, John would expect him to change, would expect him to be kind, to tell him things, to confide in him small, little things, and large, dark things that lurk in the corners of his past, which Sherlock could never do.
It’s only when John is lying on his back, with Sherlock over him, that he begins to feel the panic again.
“What are we doing here?” John hisses. Sherlock immediately puts a finger to his lips, and his eyes flicker about the place before answering.
Which leaves him with one option.
he had said, while not even looking up from the paper he was reading.
Later, the man is found dead with a fired gun in one hand, and a note in the other. They never let Sherlock read it, much to his annoyance.
Wow. Christ. It’s happening.
John blinks in confusion. “Pardon?
“See you tonight,” he whispers to Sherlock, planting a kiss on his cheek. The detective hums, and his lips quirk into a smile for just a moment before he drifts back to sleep.
John is immediately struck with tenderness at how childish Sherlock is being, and wished for nothing more than to continue to tease him by snoozing the alarm and then leaving the room, but then remembers that today he would meet his Soulmate.
No, now he can only see his face.
I search desperately inside for an answer, but nothing presents itself... Every memory that appears is only a flash, and disappears quickly. A child’s room, the details absent, a man without a face, smiling mockingly, an abandoned magnifying glass lying on a desk, gathering dust.
He stumbles into the flat, out of breath, his brain almost feeling drunk, his eyes probably wide and his hair windswept.
Lestrade rolls his eyes, and John leans in to watch him press her thumb to the screen. Sure enough, a mugshot and description comes on. Lestrade stands up and pulls the monitor closer to him before John can look at it though.
The first thing he notices in the foyer is the presence of several large boxes, filled with… yeah, his things. His clothes, his books, even his half finished crossword puzzles he’d given up on weeks ago.
Shit. What’s he gotten into now?
“I know that you looked at my phone,” Sherlock says suddenly when they stand in the lift, disturbing John from his thoughts.
what had gone wrong that day, and didn’t make him have to say it.
On top of that, Sherlock makes it known that he’s a man. He takes charge, touching John with no hesitation, groping him and pulling him along.
“Edward... when is the last time you’ve eaten?” she asks, her face one of a concerned mother.
It’s in the morning; John has just gotten up, walked downstairs to make himself some coffee, when he sees Sherlock sprawled in his chair, asleep with a book in his lap. After a few moments the detective yawns and stretches, his arms outstretched to the sides. For once his bare right wrist is in plain view. Then it hits John.
There is barely enough time for me to jump into the shadows, and even then I feel incredibly exposed.
Sherlock lets out a harsh scoff, the ones he only does when someone does something he deems enormously stupid.
“What about the time you sucked me off while I was reading the paper? You insisted something about how you were conducting your own experiment, see how well I could really concentrate!” Sherlock seethes, still holding onto John with a vice-like grip. “Or the first time in the shower?
“John. There could be more microphones in the flat.” Sherlock pushes the mug closer to John, more forcefully. “Drink it.”
Sherlock gives him such a pitying look that John has to look away.  He’s wrong. He has to be.
He whirls around to face Sherlock once more, but he isn’t able to ask his question before Sherlock suddenly jolts into ramrod straight posture, and turns towards the door expectantly.
John turns on the screen, and freezes at the door.
“This was his third theft,” Sherlock hums, his proud smirk growing. “He’s not going to stop, which is his biggest weakness here.”
Their eyes adjust to the dark a few moments later, and they find each other in bed once more, Sherlock curling into John, resting on his chest. For just a moment, they’re silent, settling into sleep, when Sherlock glances up. “Do you love me?” he asks.
“Have you ever been here?” he purrs, and even before John shakes his he head continues. “It’s a marvelous place. Only the purest of coffee, you can’t get anything else here. Try as I might I simply cannot recreate what they do, it’s something about his arm movement when he grinds them, I swear.” He nods over to the old man as he pours out some beans. “It’s an Italian style, where Nicola’s from… Got in right before the embargo. And thank goodness for that. I have no want for anymore of his people, but if there’s one thing those heathen Catholics know how to do, it’s make coffee.”
“Well… No, I guess not,” John admits. “It’s just difficult to think about. I’m still getting used to all of this.”
Two months pass without Sherlock. He
“Ah, good with children. A very good sign,” he sneers.
“Does it make a difference?” I ask.
“I think the only thing more infuriating than him moping about is him when he’s
It was nice to have that faith back, though. Just the Watch itself was somewhat comforting, knowing that there soon would be a time when he would have a soulmate. He just had to wait 348 days. 176 days. 493 days. Whenever the Watch thought it best for him.
And, why the hell was Sherlock’s Watch taken away for being awkward, while Harry’s and Greg’s Soulmates got to keep theirs? They were destructive, hurting everything in their path… Surely Sherlock in love was no worse than them.
The man in question is dressed in briefs and a t-shirt, when John returns,  sitting on his bed and examining his right hand, which is now inflamed and swollen.
She dresses, and John finds he’s too tired to even look at her body or take in her curves. He doesn’t even hear when she shuts the door and leaves, already half asleep.
think I’m a deviant!” For the first time, John hears the pain in Sherlock’s voice coming out from the anger. “Is that all I am to you? Some monster?” He’s so close, John can feel his breath.
“What? Am I not allowed to kiss you now?”
Not thinking about things is harder than expected, I find, as I wretch and hold onto the wall desperately. Rather good that I haven’t eaten, otherwise it would just be another disgusting obstacle to avoid in this horrendous passage.
Thank you for your support with the random breaks. As always, rate, comment, subscribe, etc. I love your guys' feedback!
It makes John shiver, and step closer to Sherlock, as if he will protect him from any boogeymen that may show up.
Yet there was nothing. The bombing still was on the news fairly frequently, but the focus was the aftermath, the rebuilding, how society would strive forward.
“It’s fine,” John says quickly, although his heart is still pounding.
Sherlock is in them, and John longs to tell him, tell him that he loves him, but he doesn’t, never does.
The man smirks. He looks like he's enjoying this. "I'm merely a concerned party," he says. "I worry about him."
Before the detective-scientist can finish his order, the door slams open once more, and Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade barges in.
(See the end of the chapter for
. That’s right. He’d slept with Sherlock.
“Later,” Sherlock waves his hand as Lestrade tries to protest. “We did just get shot at! I need time to recover, John needs time to recover! I’ll see you in the morning, if I feel brave enough to face the outside world.” He sniffs, a worried expression crossing his face.
“Rations,” I whisper to myself
John soaks in everything that he can. He knows that tomorrow, when the clock strikes seven, the spell will be broken, and they’ll be back in their true roles, of a doctor and husband, detective and hermit--but for now, he can’t help but soak in the magic while he can, and watch his beautiful detective sleep.
And then he’s gone.
Their physical flings are quick and rushed now, as if they’re teenagers, trying to get off as quickly as possible before a parent returned home and could catch them in the act.
“Sir? Dr. Watson here to see you,” Anthea calls out casually as they step into the warehouse.
John nuzzles into Sherlock’s chest, trying to forget.
The detective inspector he met before is already in the room, attaching his police Monitor device onto his other wrist, and pressing it a few times. John watches him calibrate it for a few moments in amazement. He’d never seen one so close before, except for in the movies. They had a similar Monitor in the army, of course, but it was much more basic, only able to track your movements and record vitals. (It hypothetically also should have shown body masses through heat technology, but in the Afghan sun that feature was useless.) The police monitor, however, had several applications and modes. You could access the entire database, record notes and crime details that would then find similar crimes, if there were any. You could even record data into some of them, John remembers seeing, and he wonders absently if he’ll get to see Lestrade input any evidence here.
“John, you don’t know much about my family, and I plan on keeping it that way,” Sherlock sighs, taking a seat once more. “But there is a certain aspect of them that I admired, and that I’ve kept. Promises are blood oaths. Either you keep whatever you’ve sworn to do, or die trying.” He leans forward near John. “No one else knows. There is no way for them to.”
he thought, his eyes fixed on the watch as he was loaded onto a stretcher, ignoring the shooting pain that rushed through his shoulder by the jostling.
This time, the drive to the flat is completely silent, and the awkwardness is almost tangible, but John can’t think of anything to say. He doesn’t have any connection with Lestrade after all, and it seems like this is the only time he’ll really be needed by the other, what can he say?
His nightmares of men dying on the sand quickly fade upon moving in with the detective, and are replaced with strange, sexually fueled dreams, him and Sherlock desperately taking one another in a bizarre, almost fever-like fashion, going until John wakes up, sweaty, aroused, and incredibly uncomfortable.
John takes another step back. “Sherlock, please, we can talk this out--”
“I love you,” John whispers once Sherlock is lying beside him again.
“Dammit,” John seethes, rushing up the stairs after him. Sherlock is close on his tail.
They both engage in a desperate kiss, both of them pouring out all of their emotions of missing the other, how awful it had been to be away. It’s more effective than talking, anyway.
Oh. Me.
He takes a step back onto the plaza again.
“Well, condoms, obviously. They were the most lucrative choice,” Sherlock said. “I also sold the Patch. That I’m rather proud of -- women who hadn’t liked the pill went to me, and as I was one of the only ones selling it I had a very loyal customer base, and it was much more inconspicuous. I kept them in a bandage package; if the police did search me they just found a first aid kit.”
Stepping on the kitchen tiles in the middle of the night, while naked, is cold enough to shiver even in the warmer months, so John hurries, not wanting to freeze. The water has other plans, however, and moves from the faucet in a slow, steady stream. Without the light on, the water looks dark, almost like the depths of the ocean, with the soft waves hitting the glass.
He sucks in a slow breath, and sips at his coffee.
Here there’s another pause, and Sherlock grins as he watches the gears desperately turn in John’s head, trying to come up with an equally eloquent answer.
Of course, physical pains are simple to figure out. What the real mystery is, is why I can’t remember anything of my life. Why can’t I remember? I try again, to search, but my now-fading headache throbs back into existence at the attempt.
Sherlock takes a step towards him again, staring down at John. “Do you think you’re a deviant?” he asks.
John can’t help but return the smile. She’s incredibly cute, with her pink lips and petite form.
(See the end of the chapter for
Oh, right, he’d said that, hadn’t he? His cheeks heat up in shame.
My name is Edward Teach. I was attacked by someone, forced into this state. Beyond that, I could be the Prime Minister for all I know.
Large ears are the first thing I notice. A large, square face, and huge ears. How did they expect him to survive in the front, with those searchlights?
He grips Sherlock tightly, breathing heavily. He hears soft whispers, coming from him, but he doesn’t know what
No, he can’t think about that now. Not with Mary beside him. Not with her soft breathing, already lost in sleep after… How long had it been? Five minutes?
He reaches over and presses the ‘on’ button.
They’re intimate, but only just starting at it. It’s obvious by the way they seem embarrassed by each other’s bodies, glancing over the other with red cheeks. Seeing someone clothed but knowing just what they look like underneath. The boy especially, watching the girl’s every movement, caressing her curves with adoring eyes, looking like a sailor trapped in a siren’s spell.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah,” Mike chuckles. “He’s like that with everyone.”
The Watches were also part of the school curriculum, and as they went through the levels they were taught more and more about what they meant, and how important they were.
Lestrade still looks unsure. “You’re aware that that’s completely against police protocol--”
“And you
Dammit.
“Let me see that,” John says, going to him immediately. Sherlock lets him take his hand and examine it, wincing at a few points.
He would not make love to Sherlock Holmes. Why would he? It would be different, strange and awfully different, for Sherlock does not have the curves that he loves, is much too fast for John’s taste, would feel jarringly different around him.
He lifts his head just enough to glare at John. “Get out,” he says, his voice low and cold.
sorry for how long/late this is. It was difficult to find a right ending point, and everytime I got on a roll life became busy. Review, kudos, bookmark, etc :)
“It was… But it was different. There weren’t the raids that there are now.”
Or maybe he was in love with him all along. He doesn’t know. He doesn’t care, because it
“Why?” Sherlock snarls, his voice lower, but still just as threatening. He creeps towards John like a predator stalking, his eyes wide and fixed on John. “Because I’m a
Sherlock looks down at the writing again. “I haven’t the slightest idea,” he says, wrinkling his nose. “She was writing more.” His eyes get a far away, concentrated look, and for a few moments the only sounds were Greg pressing a few buttons into the monitor. John watches Sherlock with a furrowed brow. He really is curious. From the way he acts, though, the fast talking, the small insults, he’s starting to see why many here don’t seem to like him. Yet he was much gentler with John, which is also odd in itself. It isn’t as if John is special in any way, or on any level as Sherlock when it came to intelligence--
When he finds himself at 221, he still has to take a sharp breath before unlocking the door and stepping in, gathering his courage as well as he can.
“Sorry,” she sighs, turning off the sound and getting up. “I work the early morning shift, like I told you yesterday. Probably should have reminded you before we went to bed.”
never
“That’s a shame. We could have used the money,” the detective mutters, his own mobile going off. There are three successive pings before Sherlock groans, snaps off his glove, and grabs the device, a look of distaste appearing on his face as he scans through the screen.
John laughs sleepily again. “I just cannot imagine a world where I couldn’t see your face.”
“A rather long story. Now, if you please,” I prompt, continuing to smile, although I’m not sure why (“Smiling always gets you what you want,” a voice tells me).
John looks at him, that sadness he felt that morning coming back to him. Sherlock scoffs when he catches the sight of it.
And his damn Watch for the first time in his life is finally counting down with a consistent timer, which terrifies him as much as it excites him. It’s everything he’s ever wanted,
Sherlock sits down beside John and takes a slow sip of his own mug. “Haven’t thought that far ahead.”
Hearing it put into words makes John’s stomach coil, and he tries not to gag right there.
“Sherlock, I can’t just write ‘madam: makeup’ into the case notes.”
, as if spoken to a child who’s been out in the mud all day.
John’s body suddenly goes cold. “You’re kicking me out?” he asks in disbelief.
“Yes?” John hurries over to the blank space in the wall beside Sherlock once more.
Sherlock comes into view first, sitting in a relaxed position at the table, and across from him is an older man, large, with baggy clothes that obviously do not fit him, despite his big size to begin with. His entire appearance suggests that he’s seen better days, but they’re long gone.
A young nurse walks in with her hands full of trays, which in turn are full of medical supplies. When she sees me, she gasps and drops everything she’s holding, sending scalpels and surgical saws across the floor. Her entire body is frozen, except for her mouth, which is opening wider in preparation for what seems like it is going to be--
“Christ, yes.”
“Resorting to name-calling?” Sherlock asks. “Very mature of you, John. But no, I’m not a Conspirator. I’m merely someone who is going to die alone, who has thought about this for a long time.” Despite the smirk growing on the detective’s face, John can hear a sharpness to his tone, a small hurt part of him coming out.
No, it will be much easier all around to just buy a new mirror.
Below the industrial heat of London, the temperature here decreases quickly, in mere moments I can see my breath in the light of the lamp, and I shiver involuntarily.
It’s then that John falls in love with Sherlock.
“I was never involved in Conspiracy activities, Dr. Moriarty, and I am a bit insulted that you --”
“I’m late, Sherlock! I was supposed to be there two hours ago!” John yells, his cheek creased with the imprints of sheets, and his eyes still swollen with sleep, despite their panicked movements.
“Do you want me to stop talking?”
“And drugging me was naturally the first thought you had,” John mutters, trying to sit up, but that action only causes the pins and needles to spread all over his body.
John does not sleep well that night. It’s the combination of waiting for Santa to arrive and the night before deployment all wrapped into one. Excitement, terror, back to excitement. He tries to practice meditation, forced deep breaths, clearing the mind, but every time he gets somewhat close to an impasse, his mind would suddenly wonder if he’d know it was her, and his heart would be racing again.
familiar sleek man leaning against it.
“It does appear that way, doesn’t it?” Sherlock asks, his sarcastic tone slipping in.
He should have told him sooner. Let him get used to the idea, John thinks with a sinking feeling of guilt. This was obviously a huge shock.
“I just want to sleep,” he sighs. “Put some distance between today and tomorrow.” The feeling of numbing terror for him was similar to the fright that was a daily occurrence on the battlefield. Eventually one learned how to compartmentalize, keep the dead men’s screams separate from the oatmeal in the mess hall, but occasionally they’d seep in, nestle into areas and memories where they shouldn’t, leaving a soldier with a sudden strike of genuine terror and instinctual need to survive while he was brushing his teeth. It was what caused men to suddenly murder their families years after discharge, or to run through the street naked, and while John as of yet managed to keep himself in control, he remembered that itch. It came to him most nights he fell asleep, when a song that a now-deceased captain always played came on the radio. It was a slow ache that burned inside his stomach and made him want to vomit and cling to some form of intimacy.
“Lestrade is different!” Sherlock snaps. “He wouldn’t betray me!”
“Sherlock --”
It’s an odd in between. On one hand John wants to tell Sherlock to stop, that it’s too much for him and it’s starting to hurt, yet it also feels
“No! Well-- Yes--”
“You can keep sleeping,” she says. “I don’t mind, just lock the door on your way out.”
Two: How did I get here? Of this, I am not sure. I think I have it, for just a moment, but then it fades away. I remember a chamber, pain, someone laughing. I’ll come back to that one.
00d07h08m.
She doesn’t look convinced, but after their slightly messy breakup six months ago she’s generally avoided talking to John, so she lets him go with a shrug.
They pretend as if nothing is wrong. John goes to work with his soldier’s facade. Sherlock occasionally experiments or solves cases for someone to whom he owes a favor.
They both pull at each other, Sherlock’s experiment lies forgotten on the counter in preference to John’s body. They gnash, bite, grope each other, and John pulls Sherlock by his shirt into his bedroom.
He feels Sherlock wrap his fingers around his cock, and it takes only a few strokes for John to completely fall apart with a lewd shout.
Biting wit.
And, he looks… incredibly bored. Like he would rather be absolutely anywhere, but here. Not that I can blame him. The job of a watchman is not strenuous or entertaining by any standard.
It must be around eight in the morning. There are a fair amount of people bustling around the streets, men in suits holding briefcases and boys in caps rushing past on bicycles. As far as I can see there’s no one just loitering, although, given that it is a bomb-threatened square, I can see why.
It’s just like every day. He gets up, he gets dressed, always taking care to put his Sig into the waistband of his pants (it made him feel safer, even if the penalties for carrying a firearm were step), he goes to his army ordered therapy (and does not mention the Sig). When it’s finally over he leaves as fast as he can, wanting just to run down the street and through that stupid park to get to the tube, to go
The suited man is silent for several moments, looking over John meticulously, as if there’s some puzzle piece missing from his face. “You’ve known him for about a month, yes?” he asks ominously. “By now you must have noticed that this is longer than the others have lasted. Tell me, are you just loyal quickly, or is there something your after from him?”
Somehow, though, he still feels miserable.
Training, I remember suddenly. It’s a new implementation by the government, having army trainees serve two months in potentially endangered cities before being shipped out to the front. A completely stupid idea, I can remember thinking when finding out, why the hell delay their deaths, when they know that they will die? (I can also remember being lectured for this opinion, thought of as heartless. Maybe I am, so far I have no sympathy for anything, save for perhaps Mrs Hudson and her hospitality)
She shakes her head, her eyes slightly sad. “I don’t know either deary, but he’s truly upset, by whatever row you two had,” she says. John can’t tell if she’s truly in the dark or just playing dumb for his sake.
“Of course,” Sherlock says casually. “People of her status don’t travel out of town to commit suicide in abandoned subsidized housing.”
“Sherlock!” she huffs, catching her breath and adjusting her face mask. “How many times… must I tell you, to stop…” she trails off, as she often does. Poor thing. Even with the mask hiding her lower face, John can tell how much she’s blushing.
Sherlock stands, and walks over to John. He’s squinting his eyes, the way he always does when he starts zoning in on some minute detail on John’s person, and John knows he’s running out of time.
“Have you ever considered that you walked right by your Soulmate during that moody phase of yours?”
But there was nothing he could do. Eric had the legal standing. No officer would separate the sacred Family, even if there wasn’t a baby yet. It was only when someone was in mortal danger that they removed the Soulmate.
“Since when do you care about Scotland Yard resources?” John laughs, now getting pushed onto the sofa.
Before his mind can get further stuck in this, Sherlock comes back through the door.
Slowly, he stops doing double takes at every tall, dark haired man who walks past him. He stops crying himself to sleep, stops beating himself up for not doing
“Sleep, okay? Get better.” He touches Sherlock’s chest lightly before leaving, for work, for a date, for something. He’s always leaving. But Sherlock supposes that’s okay, as long as he comes back.
Mike continues to talk to him, and John smiles and laughs when appropriate, but it is obvious that he does not care, only pretending to for Mike’s benefit. Instead, his attention seems to be lost in his own world, gazing off absently into nowhere.
She groans in pain, and John tries to shush her. She grabs his arm, and her eyes open, tears in them.
“Edward,” I blurt, perhaps a bit too loudly, judging by Mrs. Hudson’s jump back. I’m not used to my voice, it’s deeper than I had expected. “Edward Teach!”
“I want to make this easy for you, John,” Sherlock murmurs.
Sherlock smiles warmly at that, feeling his heart soar, although he can’t help a teasing response. “You wouldn’t let them bury me? And you think I’m kinky for wanting to watch ourselves.”
John wants to ask him more, like how he’s so sure that they won’t be caught, or when he realised he liked men, or even how he could make such a good scrambled egg yet never bothered to tell John, but he accepts that answer and eats the rest of his meal in silence. It feels like the less they talk about it, the easier it is to handle. It’s better to avoid looking at a sin right in the face, John decides.
Sherlock smiles, a genuine artifact that makes John’s heart flutter. “Of course.”
His face is a testament to his final moments, and whatever they were, they must’ve been terrifying. His eyes are open wide in shock, his mouth open, as if he’s about to cry for help. I grimace, this is surely not a pleasant place to be dumped.
But, no, so far, nothing. Sherlock is beginning to think he could fake his death and John would still take him in. John still trusts him, still stays with him.
He’s a military man, of some rank, obviously, I think, to calm myself. Shouting commands to his lower officers. In a residential neighbourhood, in London, where no action is taking place?
! It’s every part of it!”
He does not want to make love to Sherlock, at least when he’s awake, but he does want to know what Sherlock loves. A burning curiosity, that John cannot describe.
Moriarty cocks his head. “That’s all the enthusiasm you can muster?” he teases. “It’s only what you’ve been waiting for your whole life.”
Sherlock notices John’s hesitation, of course he does. The moment they step into the cold night air, the detective turn to him with a smile, but it disappears within a blink of an eye.
He loves him.
The paramedics load her into the ambulance with a painkiller, a blood transfusion and a promise to take care of her, and John can only hope that what she’s taken hasn’t already liquefied her insides.
What the hell? It sounded like an alarm clock, like the one that woke him this morning, he thinks with some confusion, glancing around. No one else seems to hear it, and it doesn’t sound like an evacuation alert.
I creep out of the bed, deciding to investigate, wincing at how sore all of my muscles seem to be. More severe injuries than I first thought. It’s still rather dark, I think, glancing out at the grey sky as I step out of the room, and down the stairs. It cannot be later than six in the morning, judging by the light, and the lack of any traffic sounds outside.
Sherlock walks slowly towards him, his eyes widening. God, catching Sherlock off guard is such a sight. “Pardon?” the detective asks.
John knows precisely what Lestrade is trying to get at, this pity is almost dripping from his voice, and as much as he wishes to tell the man to shove it, and start off anyway just to spite him, he is aware that the other is right. He doesn’t know where he is, and he doesn’t have the money for a taxi.
Sherlock snatches John by the collar, one of the tears overflowing, although John can’t tell if they’re from anger, hurt, or the pain in his hand. “The
He watches as John’s body moves to kiss him, arch into him, ravish him.
“This is your fault!” he shouts. “I didn’t want to do this, you made me!”
“Soo, Sherlock... I was wondering, are you really a virgin?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You probably saw a lot of death, in Afghanistan,” he said. Not a question. John furrows his brow, and nods, slowly getting up. “Lots of suffering, divided loyalties… The breakdown of civilization.”
And yet I am still in the dark.
He runs his fingers down Sherlock’s arm, stopping at his wrist, and kisses it. In the moonlight he can see the white line where a Watch once was, where it had been removed, but there’s another white scar beside the line, that looks like a branding.
“Are you really a virgin?”
“Do you love me?” John asks tonight, sitting in his chair, a glazed smile on his face as Sherlock plays him a new composition.
He looks back at Sherlock, who is still in his chair, and tries not to think of the life this man must have lived, nor that sinking feeling rising up in him as once more Harry’s relationship, Greg’s lack of one, and now this knowledge comes back to him.
“... Morning,” he calls to the detective in some surprise.
of it all. Upon opening my eyes to the rain falling angrily on my face and the blinding light of a nearby lamp post, the shrill whining and the sharp stabbing increases.
“But she’s your soulmate!”
The first time he met her, with some investigation, she practically had tripped over herself just to shake his hand, stammering and blushing as Sherlock said her name. John hadn’t needed to look at her Watch; only someone unbonded would be so giddy around another.
John blinks, not comprehending. “Why...Why didn’t you just wake me up?”
“Sherlock, you have a high fever,” John says, restraining Sherlock by the shoulders as he tries to jump up from the couch. “You shouldn’t go out. Rest, okay?”
“What did you want to talk about so urgently?” he asks, kissing John sweetly on the lips, as if they were new Soulmates, and they weren’t so degraded like they were now.
A shiver runs through me as I reach the landing. There’s a draft. Strange, I think. Given Mrs. Hudson’s age, she probably has aching joints; I would have assumed that she would make sure to block any chill from coming in, and I can’t remember any from the night before.
Still, just like Christmas Eve and before he was sent to Afghanistan, John does manage to fall asleep at some point, his wrist tucked carefully underneath him to assuage the temptation to stare at it like a teenager.
Harry’s situation had shaken him greatly, and for a few months in medical school, he’d taped over his Watch, feeling so full of rage and sorrow for his sister. He didn’t want to see it, he didn’t want to belong in a system that let beautiful, talented girls like Harry waste away with monsters like Eric.
“This is my mobile number…” she says as she scribbles on his wrist. “Text me when you’d like. We could grab dinner, if you’d like. Do you have a favourite restaurant? I just moved, I don’t know many-- Oh, just text me!” She steps back, still grinning widely.
I decide to follow the cold air, towards the kitchen. It’s where the noise seemed to be coming from, too.
It’s dark out when John comes to, and the first thing he’s aware of is his massive headache. He grunts, and moves to touch his forehead. The moment he moves his hand the sensation of pins and needles erupts through his arm and he gasps in shock, squirming at the discomfort.
Anderson rolls his eyes and turns to Sherlock, his face beet red with defeat. “Sorry,” he almost sneers.
“...You’re dead, aren’t you?”
“Well, it wasn’t
They probably could have had sex, if John had pushed it. But he feels wrong doing it tonight. She is his Soulmate, after all, shouldn't they take it slow?
, Sherlock’s voice suddenly comes to his mind, and John shrugs, although he can feel his heart pounding even more. “How did you know about that?” he asks, clearing his throat as casually as he could. “I… Well, I was young. Harry was having a rough time. It was before I understood.”
Because even in the dreams, John knows that the man is dead, even if it is only in the back of his mind.
All of John’s blood seems to leave his brain for his groin, forcing him into defiant submission as Sherlock grinds against him roughly.
Sherlock shakes his head. “No, not today,” he huffs, grinding against John once more. He bends his lips to John’s ear. “I’ll need time to take you apart, piece by piece… make sure you know how precious you are.”
It’s only when the detective’s breathes even and soften into a slumber that John asks the question torturing him. “What do I do?”
Not that John would ever refuse. He does love Sherlock, no matter how much he’d like to deny it. It hangs in the air between them, both of them knowing that John needs this, and would never turn it down, but neither ever mentioning it, for fear of shattering their fragile relationship, which is only just being mended.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What did you deal?” John asks quietly, suddenly incredibly curious to hear what Sherlock’s past was. Anything to get the smell of blood out of his mind.
“Well, I can’t give much on just sight alone, I’d have to ask for an autopsy to be done for all the specifics, but… It seems like she’s asphyxiated. If I had to put forth a hypothesis, I’d say an overdose of some drug.” He grimaces. “Maybe even strychnine, cyanide, rat poison of some kind, if she was desperate enough.” In this type of old building, there probably was some old cyanide traps somewhere that she could have forced herself to take.
John hums. “Well, it’s just--” but he’s cut off, as Sherlock suddenly grabs him and twirls him around. “Sherlock, what-- mm--” and then the detective envelopes him in a kiss.
His pocket buzzes, and he pulls out his mobile, wincing again as a sharp note is belted out on the tortured violin.
Sherlock sighs, and gets up. “The headache and numbness is a common side effect,” he says, and disappears into the kitchen again. John tries to turn, but that proves to uncomfortable, so he tries to stay as still as possible.
John can feel the blood rush into his cheeks, even though what Sherlock said is fairly benign. It’s the first time he’s mentioned sexuality concerning him at all, and John suddenly feels embarrassed about how he’s thought about this too much.
This has to end. Sooner or later they would get what’s coming to them.
The gray haired man rolls his eyes, stepping back to join John on the sidelines of Sherlock’s show.
He’s so lost in his own thoughts that he doesn’t hear the heavier footsteps on the stair, but he glances up just as Sherlock steps back into the room.
. The last thing Miss Wilson wrote before dying. An attempt to give this girl a record, perhaps… So many years after her death, after she came and went with no one even noticing.
“Freak,” Anderson grumbles as Sherlock strides past him, leaving the crime scene.
Once I’ve recovered, I turn on my headlamp, take a final breath of fresh air, and start back in the tunnel once again.
John’s entire body goes cold.
something to her, but covered it up. Someone showed me her obituary, said she’d died of pneumonia before her wedding night. Who dies of pneumonia in July?
He feels a lot less guilty that he expected after a transgression like this, which in itself makes him feel guilty. He just cheated on his
John wanders around the rest of the exhibit, taking advantage of the emptiness. He stopped at a painting across from the missing one, a combination of lines and colors. It looks abstract, but as John steps closer he can see the faint outline of a deer, lying in the technicolor grass.
Oh, my head...
I quickly tie one end of the string to a rung at about eye level, or what I think is eye level, as I still cannot see a thing.
He can’t place the expression on Sherlock’s face, it’s not one he’s ever seen before. If he didn’t know better, he’d say the detective looked upset.
Sherlock snaps something to the man, who in return smiles, and shrugs. John rushes over quickly, not sure if this would also take a violent turn.
Where is she?
“I imagine tonight is a take away night?” Sherlock guesses, rubbing John’s back. John nods, too exhausted to think of a snappy comeback.
That night, he tries to compose a text to Sherlock. He says how sorry he is that he let this go on too long, that he knows it was stupid and that he hurt the other but that he misses him.
Sherlock clears his throat. “Anyway,” he reminds the man. “You were saying. You were a petty thief, and fell in love with some landowners daughter, and then...?” John’s confusion increases. Was this man really telling him a bloody story? After murdering four other people?
John huffs in frustration. This would have taken hours for Sherlock to do, this couldn’t have been a product of a raging moment. The clothes are folded, each box is organized.
John nods, saying a quick goodbye to his old friend as he hurried out the door. God, they’d changed so much in the seven or so years since they’d been close. Their nights back then were full of energy drinks and floors sprawled with medical vocabulary, or smuggled vodka and fellow students who happened to have large breasts…
After a few moments, Sherlock remembers the health risks of sleeping in such a position. John will wake up with a sore and stiff back, he won’t achieve the proper REM cycle due to his discomfort, and will be grumpy for the rest of the day. It’s obvious what he must do, for John’s own sake.
Sherlock laughs again, this time without humor. “Oh, really, John. How the hell can the government track who your soulmate is?”
John shrugs. He’d been expecting this question, at least. “Less busy than yours,” he says, although he’s not quite sure.
Sherlock deserved a second chance. And Greg was right, he’d never reach out himself.
John’s doctor personality takes control over the other two, and he pushes through quickly.
At any point he could ask his friend, bring it up politely, nonchalantly, as if it is a casual question about the weather.
I almost go flying a few moments later, when the grate gives way with a loud “Clang!” The momentum of the grate flying off sends me tumbling backwards with the useless grate.
I stop chewing for a moment to consider her question. A place to go, a home, a safe house. Do I have one? I don’t know. The clothes I was wearing when I came in were ragged, looking like they belonged to a vagrant, and yet upon checking the labels in the bath, they turned out to be quite expensive items, though roughed up.
He tries his best to hang on, to keep the pleasure going, but far, far too soon he finds himself desperately trying to shout a warning, although he’s fairly certain it just comes out garbled, and he comes with a sharp cry, the warmth of Sherlock’s mouth still around his cock.
But John must guess. He has to look for clues, try to piece them together, and wonder what they mean.
“And he knew who I was. He wouldn’t let me get out. I was supposed to just be in for six months, but they tracked me, put me down for every infraction, building up my sentence over and over! I was in for thirty years!” Tears come to his eyes. “They destroyed my life! They
fault for not being acceptable.
Fuck, he can’t decide which would be worse.
For once, Sherlock is left speechless, unsure of anything he could say, and instead kisses his lips, shuts his eyes and squeezes him tight. John gives him a small squeeze back, although it is much weaker, and Sherlock listens to his lover’s heartbeat, and the breathing that soon turns into the snores of Morpheus.
I step down the hall, barefoot (she’s neglected to give me shoes), following the soft sound of humming into the kitchen, where Mrs. Hudson is standing at the stove, pouring what seems to be tea into a green ceramic mug. A small plate of shortbread biscuits lies next to it, and the smell of onions, herbs, and meat roasting invades my nostrils.
They sleep on opposite sides of her queen bed. Thankfully John does not have a nightmare, as that would make everything far more awkward than he was willing to deal with at this stage. He hadn’t even had one in Sherlock’s bed, although he’d once been jostled by the detective into waking at the beginning of one.
As always, do tell me what you think! I am desperate for others' opinions xx
Why does he feel so at peace with Sherlock? The man is the biggest arsehole he’d ever met in his entire life, he’s rude and mean and cold, but John feels utterly comfortable around him. No walls to put up, no acting.
John laughs softly too, and soon the both of them are unable to stop laughing. But even then it can only last so long, before once more reality sinks in. John had committed a serious crime, despite what his current feelings were on the law now. Someone knew, and that person was powerful, and had some vendetta against Sherlock.
It’s near nine when he’s done, and as he’s signing out at the front desk he hears someone call his name.
One has to be happy.
I mumble a thanks. She nods appreciatively, but as I begin to eat desperately, only cutting half-heartedly before stuffing oversized pieces into my mouth, she starts to frown.
“I know.”
“Well, ah…” John clears his throat. “I mean, before this morning, I had come to the conclusion that you were Pure.” Someone who saved their body for their Soulmate, and never even kissed until they met that person.
He has a girlfriend. Of course he does, I think in annoyance and disappointment. An attractive soldier, about to be sent off to die in a war that doesn’t have anything to do with him, it’s precisely out of a romance novel. The perfect man, in this war torn era.
He runs to the tube station, but realises it’s tapering off of rush hour. There will be too many people. He doesn’t have that time.
Aside from a few bones, formerly belonging to a mouse or rat, there is nothing terribly offensive, which gives me at least some solace. The depth of the water is decreasing, now just to my mid ankle.
“What the hell are we going --” John blinks, his mind suddenly going blank. What was he saying? His anger falls out of him like an emptying glass of water, and he can’t quite get a grasp on the conviction he’d just had.
“You really don’t care about this?” he asks.
“Sorry, John. I’m afraid I can’t answer either question,” Sherlock confesses.
“It… It gives insight into what you are now, I guess,” John mumbles, now feeling just discouraged. “Like, when I was really little, I wanted to be an astronaut.”
Sherlock’s hand flies up so quickly, John thinks for a moment that he is going to strike him, but instead he just holds it up, palm towards John, fingers splayed, like some desperate ‘stop’ motion.
“‘Course. Always a war on now. Probably said they stole something of ours, hm? Self-righteous battle the buggers in charge never get involved in. Ever noticed how they never say what we’re really fightin’ for? The least they could do is give us a look at Helen if we’re fighting for her, you know?”
“Is this...a celebration?” I ask curiously.
They do not speak of love.
Sherlock looks surprised to see how frustrated Lestrade is, and his eyebrows furrow. “Is this about the case you wanted me to look at?” he asks. “It was hardly needing my help, seemed fairly open shut, even for you.”
John stands there after the man leaves, slackjawed, unable to think of a single thing to say, before turning to Mike with a look of bewilderment.
He feels like he’s drowning, but there’s no way out. There’s a thought in the back of his head, knowing what he wants to do, but that thought he refuses to entertain.
And even when he hears her voice waveringly assure Sherlock that she was home all afternoon, moments later Sherlock rushes into the flat, andJohn  watches him silently as he tears apart the room, searching for another microphone.
“As we discussed before, I did not serve, making that one weakness in my intellect. Whether or not this is a common tactic taught to all men, or just those shipped off, does manage to narrow things down a bit in terms of suspect.” With that, Sherlock turns to Lestrade and the other constables, and claps his hand together.
I do not know when I drift asleep, but sometime later I wake up with a start, covered in sweat, the grin and laugh of a madman stuck in my head.
It didn’t seem so honorable.
Mary looks up at him with a confused look. “Pardon?” she asks. “Why?”
He loves her.
John scowls. He wanted to catch Sherlock off guard, but he still doesn’t miss a beat. Why couldn’t he overtake him? “You knew this was coming too,” he snaps. “What else is there?”
The tea is sweeter than John would like. He can tell Sherlock added sugar, something he never does, but the earthy herbal flavour still lurks in the background, and he’s learned long ago never to refuse when Sherlock does something kind. He takes another large gulp, if only to show Sherlock that he was cooperating.
There is heavy trauma to my head, but it’s unlikely that that would have caused the amnesia. The nature of my other injuries, and the strange memory-image of a chamber combined with someone laughing seem to suggest that it was sabotage. But why would they have erased my memories?
John feels his cheeks warm. He had never really thought Sherlock was paying attention to his random stories he’d tell when they were lying together late at night. He’d told him about his mother, that his father was on a business trip to London when he was killed by a drunk driver one day after seeing John for the last time, how if it hadn’t been for the army he’d probably had killed himself.
The jealousy faded within a few months, however, when she had called him late at night, her voice angry and loud. Eric was drunk, she exclaimed, had thrown a lamp, was yelling, and she was currently hiding in the bathroom in case he was still manic.
he looks truly like a porcelain doll. “Really?” he asks.
Luckily, I do not have to go far. I turn to the square in the hospital grounds, and see a grate, in the middle, with a small trickling of water flowing down into it. Or, at least what I hope is water, I think as I look up and realise that I’m above patient rooms, an easy place for one to dump his chamber pots.
“Whoa whoa, what are you doing?” he asks, setting down Sherlock’s cup and staring in shock at the blue screen on Sherlock’s tablet. He recognizes the coding on screen as a maneuver to bypass firewalls.
He hisses at himself.
At first I don’t hear anything more. Then a door slams, before the rain returns as the sole source of sound.
“What does it matter what I wanted to be when I was a kid, though?” she asks. “Why would that help anything?”
Hi what's up it's me, your foolish author, I lied again there's one more chapter after this, but it's a very short epilogue and it's all written, just has to be edited now.
Just as he starts down the sidewalk, he hears the detective inspector clear his throat.
He slowly begins to rationalize this, through the days and weeks beyond. Perhaps Sherlock’s Soulmate had been just as odd as he was, but perhaps that had come with some other life-threatening disorder, and she had died. Perhaps that was part of the reason why the Watch was removed.
But John still clenches his fist every time that machine clicks down.
“Not a suicide,” Sherlock disagrees, his half smile growing into a smirk. “At this point I think we can rule it out as a cause of death, hm?”
“What?!” Sherlock demands, his face growing into a mixture of disbelief and anger. “Where did you see him? Was he following you?” John must have a guilty look on his face, because Sherlock shakes his head. “You scheduled a meet up? What the hell were you thinking?! Why didn’t you tell me?!”
Suddenly the other man yanks him closer, so close that John can feel the man’s stubble against his ear.
With this plan in mind, I trudge forward in the now calf-deep water, in the direction I saw the hospital on topside, and hope I don’t come across any more rotting things.
Lestrade turns to him, pen still to his monitor. His expression is a mix of curiosity and annoyance, and he raises an eyebrow. “You think it was murder.”
“You just pursed your lips. You always do that when you’re confused.”
As he wanders the store, he watches as a young couple reunite behind the counter, both teenagers. The girl is petite, curly, golden hair, a red vest makes it obvious that she works here. With her carefully applied mascara, and accessories of dangling earrings and tingling bracelets, she looks like she belongs anywhere but a hardware store.
John laughs for a moment, until he realises Sherlock is serious. Then a flutter of worry goes through him. Only violent criminals had their Watches removed. “... Why?” he asks again.
A single shot, and all of Sherlock’s assumptions and thoughts of the world are torn to threads.
He splashes some water in his face, and heads back to Sherlock’s bedroom.
The two men had become somewhat close over the past few months, mostly over how frustrating Sherlock was. They’d met up over drinks, and had found that they rather enjoyed each other’s company. Greg was also a veteran, having served in the South Pacific front, and they both had had a wild youth.
“It was right as I was leaving!” John insists. “I didn’t tell you because -- I didn’t know what he was planning. He seems obsessed with taking you down, I didn’t want to risk him going after you.”
A quick clearing of the throat distracts him, and he turns to Sherlock, who has his eyebrow raised.
“Sherlock!” he shouts, turning the corner, and freezes when he sees an ajar door, light pouring from it. There are voices, and he immediately recognizes Sherlock’s rumbling baritone.
“Personality?” John asks.
Sherlock hears Mycroft cry himself to sleep for weeks after that.
“John. Please speak to me,” Sherlock sighs. “Even if you’d like to yell again.”
Sherlock thinks). “Shut. The.
Sherlock’s plan, as it turns out, is to browse illegal marketing sites. He has that maniacal, concentrated look about him when John comes in with tea, and he sucks in a breath.
Sherlock shrugs. “Things have changed,” he explains with a sigh.
Sherlock doesn’t make any move to approach the man, only gives him a half smile, and traces the backside of the curtain with his hand, and looks expectantly at him.
John Watson owns and wears a collection of the ugliest sweaters Sherlock has ever seen. He’s almost tempted to set fire to them, just to see if they scream or profess their love to Satan before turning into ash.
John stares for a moment, still confused, but runs after this new man, who’s somehow managed to shake up his entire life.
Carefully, never once breaking his stride, John moves his hand and draws Sherlock’s chin to face him, their eyes now locking in the flesh.
His gloved hands are roaming on John, oddly distant and cold, along his chest and down his stomach, the tips of his fingers gliding underneath the waistband of his trousers. The touch is unlike anything John has ever felt before, he’s never been touched by someone who is still wearing
“Mike!” he yells when he catches sight of the larger man. He turns, looking utterly confused as John continues to run at him.
Sherlock’s eyes widen, and his mouth drops open for a single moment to form a comical grin, before he breaks down into the most sincere laugh John has ever heard him utter.
, he thinks, wincing to himself, and stops. This sort of thing wasn’t supposed to happen. He takes a breath, and fixes a fake smile on his face before he turns.
Instead of talking John busies himself with looking over all the gear in the police car, the monitors and gears that must have some purpose, although he can’t think of what.
More time passes, and a patch of light shines from above. I shy away from it instinctively, forgetting what I am looking for.
“Your monitor,” Sherlock repeats. “Telling you what to do and then waiting for you to complete that task will take far too long, letting me use it will take far quicker.”
“We both know that your little schoolboy tantrum in uni isn’t your only strike against the State,” he hisses, and suddenly John can hear the precise voice of a madman who allowed a building to blow up with six people inside. “Beware of Holmes. He’s beyond saving, but you can still escape the filth of his kind.”
He gives one final glance to his Watch before leaving the tube station. 00d05h27m.
John freezes, and she grins. “Come on. Someone wants to have a chat with you.”
“If only I’d known you got so turned on by fighting,” he purrs. “I’d have started a thousand spats just to get you in this position.”
Sherlock.
So he does cling to Sherlock for the entirety of the night, falling asleep far earlier than he has in ages, while the detective taps away at his mobile. He has no idea what he’s doing, but the exhaustion makes it hard to care.
“Fuck me,” is what he ends up saying.
He suddenly backs into someone, jostling his back and startling him. He can’t help but gasp, already on edge, and he whirls around.
“We’re here for a crime scene, obviously,” Sherlock says, answering John’s unasked question. Once more he started to wonder if Sherlock was actually some sort of a mind reader. “You’ve read about the suicides, I gather.”
“He’s going to get past Lestrade and his men. It’s merely a fact,” he murmurs into John’s ear, causing shivers down his spine. “We’re going to stop him here.”
The smile on Sherlock’s face grows, and he nods. “You’re attractive, moderately intelligent, and far kinder than you need to be. You deal with me, which is exceptionally impressive, and with each story from your past that you tell me, I can see how you became you. Like a puzzle. All the pieces that make John Watson.”
Sherlock Holmes is mad. Absolutely, stark raving mad, that much is incredibly obvious to John.
When he pads down to the kitchen that morning, still slightly shaky from his restless dreams, he spots Sherlock at the stove.
And of course, as usual, Sherlock is right on that count. John isn’t leaving.
“Oh hush, I’m not accusing you of anything.” Moriarty rolls his eyes. “I know you would not be so dull, Dr. Watson. Not when you have so little time left.” He nods to John’s left wrist, and John reflexively yanks that arm into his lap.
“Hm.” Sherlock purses his lips. “He’s far more active than I thought… This isn’t just income for him, it’s a high. And given how this is starting to break in the press, I’d say the next heist will be in less than three days.”
He notices that the other has already put some items in the downstairs bedroom, which is baffling to him. Did Sherlock not notice the fact that John
She must see something, a flash of panic in my eyes, or the blood matted in my hair, or the general disgruntledness of my appearance, because after a moment she relaxes, her gaze becoming soft and motherly as she takes a step towards me. “Now look at you,” she tuts, shaking her head as she takes my hand in her own. They’re warm, I had not realised how cold my body was. “Listen, let’s get you inside...I’ll make you a cuppa. I’ve just put a roast in the oven, although I’m sure it’ll not be as good as your mother’s. With all these rations going about, I’ve had to make some sacrifices to the recipe.” She chuckles to herself.
He sighs, forcing it out of his head before it festers in his brain. Why bother focusing on what could never be, after all?
,” John insists. “And Greg knows… That could mean anyone does.”
, John can’t help but think. When he was her age, he was able to buy condoms from an art teacher.
“May I at least ask what this is about?” he asks, nervousness filling his bones as the car turns into a warehouse district near the Thames, full of industrial shops that had long been abandoned, after the New Revolution.
Sherlock raises an eyebrow. “Problem?”
He tried to imagine the life Sherlock must have led. The guilt and anger, knowing how bad it was yet somehow being drawn to that sort of life.
He freezes when he sees John and Sherlock, and his expression -- previously slightly annoyed -- turns irate.
The dream is something odd, even in it John has difficulty remembering the details. Snakes drift in between a woman’s legs, becoming princes and thieves and then changing once more, while rocks shift from gold to iron back to granite. An amphibian ribbits some wise words at him, but he can’t quite hear him...
John shudders and gasps, each touch sending firecrackers under his skin. Sherlock is good at this, he thinks in the back of his mind as the detective starts to stroke him off. But that makes sense, given that they have the same anatomy, and Sherlock has done this to himself for years.
Blood has already soaked through the left side of his shirt. He’s gasping for breath, his eyes already becoming milky and unseeing. Even as John tries to speak to him, he can see the life fading, until he’s completely still.
No, no, no. He can’t do that. Because if he loved John, if John loved him, it would be horrible. John would need him, always need him. He would soon learn everything about Sherlock, even the things that he has locked away and refuses to look at.
Sherlock, who has already taken a few steps towards wherever they were going, stops, and turns to John with another wide eyed look.
doing?” Lestrade asks, as John grabs the tablet and rushes out the door himself.
“Well, you are a doctor, yes?” he hums. “Would you mind doing analysis on the body?”
He’s young, probably mid twenties. Given his uniform, he’s most likely a recruit. Stiff, rigor mortis has already set in. Places death at at least an hour, then. I run my hands over his body, trying to find a wound, an external cause of death, but there is none. It seems like the man just fell over and died. A heart attack? Possible, but highly unlikely. He is young, and was training for military service; they would have checked for a weak heart. And, why would he be here, in a sewer, unless there was foul play involved?
“No, I know. Thank you, Mrs. Hudson, it’s not you I’m cross at,” John sighs, and steps back into the foyer. There’s nothing that he can do here. “Is this really more than a tantrum?”
What a fucking twat, John fumes, gripping the book tighter. Does he really think that John has nothing better to do but turn in paperwork and bring home a dead body for the other? When he gets home, he’s really going to let that man have it--
“No!” John shouts, struggling to get out of Sherlock’s grip. “Let me go!”
I try to focus directly on the concept of home, but all I come up with are flashes of a lawn, and trees, and skinned knees.
don’t go away, but at least there is not the added noise of morons and idiots to contend with.
I step into the bath, grabbing a small hand towel from the rack, and turn on the water. It’s scalding hot to my frigid body, and makes me flinch, but I keep it on, to reopen and flush out the wounds, as there’s already swelling, and an infection is at this point not needed.
I find something. I think I’ve got it.
John stares, dumbfounded. Sherlock jumps off of the desk, holding the cord and what looks like a small microphone attached to it in his palm. “What is…”
“Good afternoon,” John returns, for a moment forgetting his moral quandary and smiling at how ridiculous Sherlock is. “What time did you end up falling asleep?”
“They’ll still be dead tomorrow.
“I’ll rest until I get another case, will that be enough for you?”
And now John would never have to deal with those days again, he thinks with some relief. No random hook ups or flings that dragged on for too long. He never has to deal with that again. He now just had Mary.
Of course, on the lists of things I really don’t want to do is go back into the hospital. Molly Hooper has probably alerted the staff of a strange, barefooted man who is suspect to turn back up. Which means I’ll have to find another way in.
Think. Focus. Gather evidence, that always helps. Or, at least I think it does...
He turns to the detective inspector, and nods tersely. “Fine, yeah,” he sighs.
Takeaway, given that Sherlock can’t cook, and John doesn’t want to waste a single moment that could be spent kissing Sherlock. So they sit, John straddled over Sherlock’s lap, snogging passionately while they wait for the pizza to arrive.
“Well, that isn’t, but inviting myself to your flat may be.” He smiles at her, and she raises an eyebrow.
Right beside her body, near her broken nails, are carved letters into the rotting wood, spelling out “RACH” before the marks become too light to comprehend.
“I’m... not sure,” I admit. She doesn’t like this answer, apparent in the frown that replaces the smile she wore a moment before.
Each sight is accompanied with the feeling of John rocking into him, the animalistic pleasure that is lust, love, hot and beautiful and burning; the combination of two senses’ delight increases the ardor tenfold, makes him dizzy.
John is quiet for so long, Sherlock at first thinks he’s fallen asleep. “If you were killed…I’d get vengeance for you, drag your killer’s body around his home fifty times until I couldn’t anymore…they’d have to drag you away from me to bury you.”
“No, I don’t believe so,” Sherlock grins, and pulls John out of the kitchen.
Sherlock smiles, and goes back to his laptop, trying to ignore the hot flush in his cheeks and the ache in his heart.
“Someone scaled the ceiling?” Greg asks in shock, echoing John’s thoughts.
The man in question is seated at the kitchen table, bent over something small.
But he’s looked for too long, and now Mike notices as well.
Then he was shot.
high, but he’s obviously not eaten as much as he should; his cheekbones jut out even farther than usual.
The car rolls smoothly to a halt, and Anthea, or whoever she is, slips out of the car. She pauses when she sees John is still sitting very still in his seat, and laughs.
Sherlock sighs, and shrugs. “It’s only so often that you have a criminal with brains. I appreciate that,” he says. “Besides. Proved a point about you.” His eyes drop to John’s legs, and it suddenly occurs to the doctor that he doesn’t have his cane, and his leg only has a dull throb, despite having ran up three flights of stairs.
John pulls away regretfully. Sherlock lets him leave, his hands settling into his lap.
John pauses, still trying to wrap his head around this situation. His war instincts slip on like a glove, and he leans back. “You know, as flattered as I am, I really don’t think-”
John politely accepts, not about to turn down a meal that would be paid by someone else, especially by someone who had done their military service without being sent to battle. Besides, Mike was right. It had been too long, not just since seeing him, but since having any real contact with a living person that he wasn’t forced to have. As Ella had said, he needed to leave his comfort zone more.
“Your husband, obviously.”
Now, he pulls John (or does John pull him?) into the bedroom, desperately kissing the other. He’s so distracted by John’s mouth and body that he doesn’t notice his own clothes being shucked off his body, which he regards a bit in surprise, but doesn’t particularly care. Likewise, John is so preoccupied with undressing Sherlock that he doesn’t seem to notice the absence of the usual periodic table on the wall, and the replacement mirror.
Soon even those thoughts are lost, and John comes far too soon with a small groan.
OHMIGOD finally. This has been such a crazy ride. I've really loved creating this world though, and I hope you all liked reading it!
But that smile...with a mysterious gleam in his eyes...Sherlock would go through all of it. The hugging, the pain, the lack of privacy, he wanted all of it, every piece of it, just to see that smile, if only once more.
“Really?” she grins again. “I’m a pediatric nurse at Great Ormond.”
He steps away again, and turns to leave. There’s not much he can do, as Mrs. Hudson said herself.
With that, he pockets his mobile for the last time, and calls in the next patient with the biggest smile he’d had in a long time.
“I’m insulted, John,” Sherlock teases. “Haven’t I made my affections clear enough by now?”
“Well, someone has to get us groceries today,” John quickly stammers, feeling his cheeks warm up to his absolute horror. How is it that Sherlock can make him feel like an inexperienced, shy schoolboy all over again?
As nervous as John is, Mary is shockingly alright with him moving in with her so soon. Although, then again, why shouldn’t she be?
food away.
He glances around with a strike of fear, but relief rushes through him when he sees it’s just Mike Stamford.
John can’t stop thinking about Sherlock. If he’s honest, the detective has been in his head for ages now, much longer than even when Mary has been in his life.
It really is awful. He remembers the days of pining after someone, the dismay at discovering that no, his Watch was still counting down… The added humiliation of the doomed crush being someone as rude and aloof as Sherlock Holmes seems too much to bear.
Sherlock’s eyebrows fly up his face.
“Good morning,” the other man says, yawning and turning onto his side. “Did you sleep well?”
The Museum of Antique Times is closed, and with the darkened windows the building looks like a looming monster. The tall cement building has always looked foreboding to John, and now that the enormous doors are shut, he feels as if walking inside would be trespassing.
who had to please the scum of society…
“Oh, about three years now,” Mike responds, giving the awkward smile in return. “We’ve got two boys… It’s all crazy, I--” He stopped abruptly, and John could see something lingering in his old friend’s eyes, almost like nostalgia, or regret, before he quickly snaps himself out of it. “Anyway, let me treat you to lunch. It’s been far too long!”
He scrambles to catch up with the other man as he opens the door of the lab violently, causing poor Molly Hooper to jump and shout. She’s bent over some toxicology test, in full gear, but now seems flustered.
My lungs hurt as well. They’re burning, there’s fire in them: I can’t stand it, it’s burning!
Did Sherlock melt all of their cheese with a laser again, or was that just the jack?
First, of course, he has to procure a tall mirror. There is one already, hung against the door of the bathroom, but it seems like a Sisyphean feat to remove it from its screws, screw it into the bedroom wall, then put it back in its rightful place the following morning.
He scrolls through his mobile during a dead period when no one is around, and he finds himself on the messages to Sherlock.
“I could have you,” he says from behind, in a dark, thrilling voice, right in John’s ear. “We wouldn’t have to tell anyone. We could carry on in secret. I don’t mind it.”
The two men continue to laugh and talk about trivial matters with one another as they walk (The larger one’s name is Mike, and lives with his mother, who treats him like a child, apparently), and not once do they look back to see if they’re being followed. Either they’re extremely incompetent, or I’m rather good at this following thing.
“Sher--”
“Right, fine, whatever you want to call it,” the man sighs, rolling his eyes, until they finally settle on John, whose brow is furrowed in confusion as the others talk. “Who’s this?”
John stares at him with wide eyes, completely terrified, until he sees what seems like a mirror in Sherlock’s face.
I close my eyes instinctively, as if giving them the privacy they deserve. I know I should not be watching this. When I open my eyes a few moments later, the man has the woman in his arms, and they both step out of the frame. I stare at the lighted, now empty window, although I do not know why. I need to think, to understand.
Sherlock shrugs. “I’m not sure,” he murmurs, and scratches the back of his head with his bow as a small smile comes on his face.
He stares at his Watch during his entire commute to work, standing at the tube with his eyes glued to his wrist.
to wash her dishes. Not that one could blame her, despite her large and kind heart, I am still a strange, homeless man she found on the street.
“W-what?” he asks.
“Oh yes, please Sherlock, continue describing this incompetent man while we make love. I can’t think of anything better.”
John puts on some pants once he’s back in his room, and curls up into his bed tightly. His mind is still swirling, but somehow he falls back asleep regardless.
(See the end of the chapter for
Unless they expected someone to find the body.
The cafe Moriarty tells John to go to is the most high class one he has ever seen. It has a shiny, Pre-Revolution decor, with red sewn chairs and varnished gold for the legs of the table. At the bar is an old fashioned looking coffee machine, and an older man shuffles behind it.
Snogging was fantastic, he learned very, very quickly. Feeling breasts was fantastic.
But still, it ticks down, second by second, matching his heartbeat.
And on those nights, they can still pretend. They can just pretend that it’s all the same, and that it’s all just a game, between them.
“Shall we sit down?” the government man sweeps his hand to the mostly empty dining room. John stays where he’s standing, knowing that Moriarty has no intention of letting John choose.
talking to is gone, flying to the ground with his black coat flowing above him, in a final act of grace and beauty. His eyes stare up to the sky, lifeless and unseeing.
“What? I’m not that bad, am I?”
“That’s good,” Moriarty sighs dramatically, sipping slowly at his coffee. “I’d been worried about him. You know how hideous that case was… although I have to confess, I thought Sherlock Holmes would have been able to solve it if anyone could have.” There’s a hint of glee to his voice, although John can see the almost physical contortions the man has to go to in order to mask it. “Such a terrible crime. I can still hardly sleep. How someone could be so depraved, I can’t understand.”
Sherlock takes a step back, his eyes suddenly going to the ceiling of the room, darting around. “I don’t know,” he mutters. “Unless…” The man suddenly lurches, and before John can even process it, the detective is on the coffee table, then the desk, causing hundreds of papers to scatter to the floor.
What?
“No,” he says immediately. “No one else knows.”
Both men stare at him for a moment.
“I told you, we’ve been backed up lately,” she squeaks, her eyes moving from side to side, trying to find a way to escape. “I have all the voice notes and handwritten components, but you’re not the only case I have! You’re the one who kept asking me to run different tests, some of them aren’t even back yet! I still don’t think it truly mattered what his DNA makeup was, I don’t understand why you needed me to run it five different ways!” She huffs, her face red by now. “I can’t deal with you
“Anti-social tendencies,” Sherlock says, just as casually, and smiles at John’s look of shock. “Don’t flatter me, John. You’ve seen it more than others. At the age of seven they deemed I would be an insufficient mate, and removed it.” He gets up and walks into the kitchen, seeming completely nonplussed by this conversation.
Hope this chapter is worth the wait.
John taps the message to see the rest of it, but immediately a request for a passcode appears. Shit. He retreats, not about to try to jailbreak Sherlock’s phone. That would not end well, he knows.
“Up here,” he says breathlessly, moving up to the pillows. John gives him a confused look, but is obviously too aroused to truly care, and he to scrambles up to where Sherlock is and resumes his attentions. As he kisses down Sherlock’s neck and body, Sherlock turns his head to the mirror, his heart pounding in excitement.
The door creaks when I open it, and reveals the gloomy, chilly room. At first glance, it seems like nothing is out of the ordinary--no pots or pans lying on the floor haphazardly, no broken glass. I’m confused for a moment, until I see something, a fruit (an apple, I think) on the table. I walk towards it, and pick it up.
. God, I need to eat...
“Tell me!” she repeats, her previously scared eyes now looking determined and fiery.
And soon, just like every other child, he became enamored with his Watch.
I rush towards the passage upwards, feeling pleasantly surprised to find a set of iron rungs once again. I tie the remaining piece of string, and start my way up, stumbling as I try to get feeling back in my feet, which are rather numb after submersion in the cold murky water.
Which he does, always.
They eventually settle back into a routine, although it is a bit different. John lives with Mary now, does not see Sherlock often. But that infuriating man still texts him, sends him details on a crime scene he is heading to, or an interesting client, at any hour, during the day or night, as if it’s an invitation. John always has the choice of saying no, of turning away and continuing about his schedule.
Instead, there’s a large expanse of emptiness against one of the walls, where the most recent piece of art was taken. John hangs back as Sherlock starts to examine the wall, appreciating for a moment whatever the criminal had to go through. The piece had to be fairly large, it must have been inordinately difficult to get out of the museum, in a simply logistical sense.
“Yes you did! You dragged me into this… I never even thought of doing this before I met you, oh my God…” What was going to happen to him? “And now some fucking psychopath who blew up his own building knows! He’s been spying on us! You don’t think anything is going to happen from that?!”
“Do you want me to leave?” the detective asks. “I imagine you’d like time to collect yourself. I’ll need to go to the station anyway.”
As he places the bow under his chin, the two men glance at each other; the emotion in the other’s eyes makes them both pause, and Sherlock has to remember why he’s holding the instrument before he finally begins to play.
At John’s entrance, he glances up. “Hello,” he hums, and turns his head back to his experiment.
I grab three and stuff them in my mouth, all manners forgotten in my hunger. I can barely even register their taste, I’m much too distracted. Upon swallowing I see that crumbs and drool are covering my lap, probably creating the impression of a savage beast. Luckily, Mrs. Hudson has turned her attention back to her roast, and has not noticed.
Sherlock realises that he hasn’t breathed since John started speaking, and his lungs are screaming for air. He takes a deep breath, still unable to blink. This is impossible. No one has ever stood up for him before.
He ignores it for the time being, and dismisses it. It cannot be love, because love is possessive and painful, and this feeling is full of glee and wonder. Love ruins sleep, and steals your life, but Sherlock welcomes this, this change, and he has been sleeping better now than ever before in his life.
“Yeah,” he says carefully, not sure what Sherlock is implying. “Every day. Far too much, for any man.”
But John has already turned around and is running the opposite direction from him. Something has clicked in his head, some dial that has been ticking for ten or so years and has finally fallen into place. All the doubts, the worries, the fears, all the things he’d been told over and over and over again was just paranoia…
The following day, despite John’s gripings, he’s dragged to the morgue to pick up Sherlock’s eyes.
I gasp desperately for a few moments, enjoying the simple pleasure of inhaling, and exhaling, before I remember the task I’ve set for myself. Answer the questions.
Lestrade glances to John, who is only able to nod, corroborating Sherlock’s story. The detective inspector sighs. “Right. Well, I’m going to need you to go over some paperwork here.”
In Which a Tunnel is Discovered, a Mystery is Curiously Stumbled Upon, and a Handsome Soldier Makes his Appearance
Shaking that thought off, I set to examining the body.
The man waves his hand, as if shooing away the question. “What is your connection to Sherlock Holmes?”
Sherlock nods slowly. “There’s not much else we can do otherwise, can we?” he replies. “If you’d like to give this up, I would understand. You’re beginning to see the risks involved, after all, and I do have to warn you that they don’t go away.”
After a few patients, he cleans and sanitizes his desk before the next one, before it becomes too much and he decides to text Mary now. He grabs his mobile, and sees Sherlock’s text from this morning, waiting, looming like some storm cloud.
John tenses. There it is.
But Lestrade’s face lights up slightly. “Could that be what this is? Some bloke trying to purge the corrupt wealthy--”
Why did it have to be a public place, with at least thirty people all around?!
“I won’t!” John shouts, stalking out of the warehouse with a huff.
There wasn’t really anything to return to. Harry was the only person he told that he was back, and even then the tensions between them weren’t gone. She tried to ask him to stay with her, saying that she and Eric had found common ground, whatever that meant, and gave him some money for clothes, and her old phone. He declined, deciding instead to go back to London. He wanted a new start, and London, the largest city in England, seemed like the best place to avoid running into someone he knew.
Most parents would refuse to let their children even date, wanting them to be completely pure for when they met the love of their life. But there was a collection of them in John’s class, boys and girls who were rebellious, or, like in John’s case, had parents who hadn’t seemed to notice that they were now teenagers, and that they needed protecting. They all took advantage of that, having quick flings of kisses and gropes at sixteen, knowing that this was all just temporary.
“Yes,” she told him, with a small smile.
Tonight, however, that doesn’t matter, because John will be there. He’ll come by after dinner, and can stay the night.
I look for his dog tags, but find none on his person. There is a name tag, however, clipped just above his left breast pocket. I unclip it from his shirt. “H KNIGHT” it reads. I’ll have to look him up later, perhaps sneak back into the hospital and check his records, search for any heart conditions.
When he’s finished, he pads back into the room. Sherlock is still sitting up with half opened eyes, and he’s yawning, a silly looking image that John can’t help but marvel at.
“So, where are you living nowadays?” Mike asks, back at the table,. “Get a fat pension from the army?”
Kissing a man is strange. The kiss itself remains the same, and the way Sherlock grazes his lips with his tongue, and sucks on his skin makes John become dizzy, but the rest is where it gets tricky. They’re pressed incredibly close together, and John can feel the outline of Sherlock’s body, can feel the dearth of all the curves and softness of a woman.
When Sherlock mentions this to him, John looks shocked for a moment, then grabs the end of the sweater he’s wearing (gray, wool, with rather sloppy and frightening-looking sheep crocheted along the hem), and mumbles “my mum made this for me,” in a devoted, defensive tone.
The kids leave him alone, at least for the first few years. At that point, there is still compassion in their hearts, and they figure there’s no harm in a boy who doesn’t like company, who prefers to look at dead rodents and watch bees all day.
He could tell him, John thinks. Three years of regretting never telling Sherlock that he loved him, and the man is right here.
“Well, why else would you be here?” I ask nonchalantly. Isn’t it obvious? How can she be surprised?
John’s blood immediately runs cold. What had Sherlock done? “He’s my flatmate,” he says carefully, narrowing his eyes. “What else were you expecting?”
As a young boy, he hides behind the bookshelves in their library, and watches as his father and mother scream at each other, and hears his father sob against the books.
“Oh, for Christsake!” he hears Sherlock snarl, knocking him out of his daze. The detective freezes right outside their door, glaring at something across the street..
“What the fuck? Do you really think some fucking tea is going to make this alright?” he snaps.
“Shh,” Sherlock whispers, kissing John softly. His hands slide along the soldier’s hips. “I’ve got you. You don’t need to do anything.”
“You’re an idiot, you know,” he mutters softly. Sherlock turns at looks at him, with a raised eyebrow.
Everyone is holding their breath by this point, waiting in suspense for the scene to unfold.
I’m now facing the window, where the rain is hitting loudly. I realise after a moment that the window opens into the alleyway where I woke up. Rather interesting, I think. I must inspect it more closely in the morning.
John tries to back away, but one step and he’s against the wall. “N-no!” he stammers.
“Right, yeah, complete control,” John sighs. “Predicted that bullet too, then? What was the point of all that?”
There’s no bracelet indicating a medical issue, and on a quick glance to her wrist John sees that she’s still more than a hundred days away from meeting her Soulmate.
By the time he reaches the sidewalk, Sherlock is long gone, nowhere to be seen. Great. What’s he supposed to do now?
John’s heart rate picks up speed. He is fairly certain this won’t help, but he nervously keeps forward. “Mary Morstan. She’s a pediatric nurse.”
His eyes fall down to his own Watch, and guilt floods his body. Sherlock doesn’t need to worry about this, but he certainly does.
“... Why?”
!” He sounds completely sincere, and John flinches as he stares at the full wrath of Sherlock. “
“Why?”
“LEAVE!!”
“Hi,” she says softly.
He texts Mary a bit. He’ll drop by her flat in an hour, which gives him enough time to talk to Sherlock. She understands this. (“My flatmate was so excited for me too!! We talked about it for ages, take your time with it!! :)” she sends him.)
His eyes wander back up, and catch Sherlock’s piercing blue ones, watching him with a smirk.
Sherlock suddenly whirls around, his hand going to his head.
John finds himself sitting, and watches Sherlock as he cracks a few eggs into the pan, scrambling them expertly (the first time he’s ever seen the man do something food related in the kitchen).
“You knew this was going to happen! I can’t stay here forever! Where the hell am I supposed to go?”
My head is pounding, with an angry ringing sounding in my ear, beating with the rhythm of my heart. Each throb seems to increase the absolute
Upon stumbling out from the shower and cracking open the bathroom door, I see she did indeed put folded, clean clothes in the hallway, right in front of the door. A purple button-down shirt and black trousers, she even thought to leave pants. I change, noting that the shirt and trousers are about two sizes too small. After some difficulty with the final shirt button, it suddenly occurs to me how strange it is that she has these clothes, given that she lives alone.
It’s not as if it matters.
Mrs. Hudson has a secret passage from her kitchen? Interesting.
“It has been two months,” John says. “I thought I’d check in.” Sherlock stares at him, a disbelieving eyebrow rising. “... And I wanted to apologise.”
“Yeah, actually,” John mutters, pocketing his mobile. “Fuck off. You aren’t keeping me here against my will, right? I’ll see myself out.”
“Why?”
There are not rungs here, instead makeshift grooves, missing or scraped away brick, making it even harder to climb down. The holes barely fit the ball of my foot, and I have to stop at each one to steady myself.
“I’d love to.”
Sherlock looks up with a surprised expression. “What?”
John shivers, but he doesn’t have time to let the words soak in before Sherlock pulls him by his trousers to the foot of the bed and starts to undo them with his one good hand.
John ignores his dry mouth and turns to see his sleeping lover.
“Another suicide,” the man pants out.
? Is he mad?
Sherlock smiles, leaning against the counter. “I want to make you comfortable,” he explains.
. This wasn’t entirely a surprise, but John suddenly feels like a mouse, being toyed in the two paws of a house cat.
“Doesn’t matter,” I repeat, pushing her slightly out of the way, almost sighing in relief as I’m finally able to open the door. “Very sorry to bother you, Mrs. Hooper. Good day!” I tip my head in farewell, and walk off, leaving her still standing in front of the door, seeming completely dumbstruck by the experience.
He lets Lestrade into the flat when they finally reach Baker Street, just because he isn’t sure what else he can do.
“We’re here!” he shouts, not taking his eyes off of John for a moment.
“What are you talking about?” John shouts back. “What the fuck am I supposed to understand?!”
trying--
Sherlock glances up. “Hm? Oh, yes, fine,” he says, beckoning John to come closer. “I want your opinion. Would you say this smells like chlorine, or sulfur? My nose is having difficulty detecting smells currently.”
I cannot go back to the sewers; Molly will probably stay in the operating room for quite a while, to see if I come back. Apparently I’ll have to travel topside now.
“Ah, thank you, darling,” Mycroft says sweetly, taking the cup. As he takes a sip, John gets a glimpse of his Watch, and sees that it’s blank.
A petite woman with a felt hat, blond fringe peeking out stares back at him, her eyes wide.
As I begin to carry the plates to the sink I can feel my stomach begin to ache and twist. I’m not used to eating so quickly, or so extensively, apparently.
They rush into the darkened exhibit, and John’s eyes dash to every corner of the room. No one. Shit. Nothing on the ceiling either.
Uh... Can't think of anything more to say. Follow me on Twitter? Is that allowed? @TheBiDumbass
Sherlock glances up at him. “Goodbye, John,” he says.
Now it looks like Mike’s smile falters, but John does catch it. “Yeah, bless her,” he says, slightly quieter. He pulls his mobile out of his pocket, and whistles at the time. “I hate to cut this short, you’re far more interesting than my students, but I really ought to go.”
There was more of a pause after this one, and his mother took a small breath, as if steadying herself, before answering. “Yes,” she murmured, grimacing and nodding.
John’s eyes widened, and he glanced back up at her, the worry increasing in his gaze. At that age he was still frightened of girls, even his twin sister, and the thought of spending his whole life with one was too much.
Those smells always made him feel sick.
Finally a concerned counselor had taken him aside, and through their sessions he continually reminded John that the system couldn’t be absolutely perfect, and of course not all pairs could be love at first sight. But Eric was obviously someone who needed to be helped, to work through his issues, and wasn’t his headstrong, tough attitude sister just the perfect person to help him become who he was supposed to be?
My initial thought was correct; it’s an apple. There’s a bite in it. A single bite. It wasn’t here last night, not when I left, and with the rations, I’d certainly doubt that Mrs. Hudson would leave an apple only partially eaten. Who else had been here?
"Mhm," John hums, unconvinced. "And where do you fit in this spectrum?"
“Hooper,” she says meekly, so quietly that at first I think she is making owl noises. “Molly Hooper. But, I still don’t understand...How did you know about Matthew, how did you get here?”
have happened to them, if they’d been given a chance?
“No! Wait…” he gasps. “I want to please you… Teach me how to please you…”
“We’re talking about this!” the detective snaps, and for the first time, john feels frightened of him.
“John --”
“How is it?”
No, not between
Sherlock gives him a look, that even in his half-awake state looks judging and annoyed. “They removed it,” he says, as if it’s obvious.
The only times he’s seen that is on a corpse.
, he reminds himself.
“I --” His feet feel heavy. He stumbles, barely managing to position himself in front of his couch before his legs give out and he falls onto it. The mug falls from his hands to the floor with a sharp crack, but he can’t react. The world feels so slow.
He’d forgotten what a light sleeper Sherlock was. A single disturbance would wake the man, even a single pea under the mattress would probably keep that tortured detective awake for days...
Greg freezes, his wrist still halfway to his face. “How else are we supposed to catch up to him?”
I eat the rest of the cookies quickly, and do not attempt the tea again, eyeing it warily as my tongue begins to go numb.
“The groceries can wait,” he purrs, biting John’s ear in a way that he knows will make John’s knees buckle. “You didn’t buy anything frozen, they can stand thawing.”
The voluntary erasure of my entire life seems rather extreme. I’ll go with the former option then.
Sherlock huffs. “Well, let’s see, in university I dealt contraception, and for a while I was addicted to cocaine. It was rather vital for me to get on these websites.”
“What was that?” he asks quietly, feeling completely on edge after that exchange.
Other things came out, too, later. In their sporadic chats, Harry would complain about him never cleaning up, about humiliating her, about the bras she would find that could never have been hers. It made John furious. How on earth could such a pompous ass be his sister’s Soulmate? The twins had never gotten along, but that hardly meant she should have to deal with some cheating bastard for the rest of her life.
He allows himself to fantasize about his Soulmate for the first time since he was seventeen. Back then, he had wanted what every boy in the throws of hormones wanted in a woman: big tits, skinny, a nice laugh, and beyond that he wasn’t too picky.
The most difficult part about all of it was being in public. Everywhere he went he was certain that everyone could figure it out, that it was obvious. John knew that he was being paranoid, but in his defence, he was like this the first time he’d had sex of any kind.
him and his bloody stupid eyeballs!” A small frustrated noise leaves her and she turns on her heel to leave the lab.
Usually, it’s in the middle of a case, when Sherlock pulls an all-nighter to try to piece together the evidence and John tries to stay up with him, and ends up slumped at the desk.
But Christ, why can’t he stop thinking about Sherlock?
“What are you…?” John trails off as he hears the door slam, and footsteps rushing up the stairs. They’re heavier than the new land lady’s, and soon a well-built, stocky man appears in the doorway, looking out of breath. John’s about to ask who the hell he is, until he sees the recognition in Sherlock’s face.
With this idea in mind, I duck behind the two men, who are too lost to even notice me (some guards), and search for an opening, something that will lead me down.
And with his hand comes a black cord.
He’s about to retreat entirely when he hears a floorboard creak from the hallway.
“What does that even mean?!” John cries.
“Are you alright?” Sherlock asks, his voice the kindest John has ever heard.
“Sherlock, that’s the man who kidnapped me,” he hisses, gripping the man’s sleeve.
And darkness.
Sherlock leans back. “I don’t know,” he confesses. “Honestly, I don’t think he cares about us, not in a moral sense. I don’t think he believes in any part of his job. It’s just a means to an end. Get power. Sew chaos. Reap the benefits. But I… I jeopardize that, in a way. I have no belief in the system either, have no stake in it. Which makes me dangerous. I have nothing to lose if I did decide to burn this all to the ground. Perhaps that frightens him. Or perhaps he’s merely intrigued by my intelligence, and just wants to add an extra flavour to whatever psychotic fantasy he has.”
