“He is,” Steve agreed with a small smile, tucking the tags away into his jacket pocket. Tony knew Steve was coming for him. He knew Steve hadn’t given up on him and he had left Steve evidence of that. Steve
talking to you,” Tony said, sitting down next to him.
“Tomorrow when they bring the last meal. I’ll agitate them, make them put their hands on me. I’ll grab ‘em then. Let’s sleep. We both need all the rest we can get. You okay?” he asked as an afterthought, hesitating before he stood and waiting for an answer.
They waved him away, rolling their eyes. “Too late,” Jones laughed and then he sobered, reaching out to put a hand on Steve’s shoulder. “We’re just glad you’re alright.” Steve patted his hand as Tony came back in. Dugan watched the way Steve’s eyes followed him, lovingly, like Tony was simultaneously the best and most precious person on earth. And to Steve he was.
“I did.”
“Rest is important for muscle memory,” James agreed. “
“It’s absolutely beautiful,” Tony answered his question. Benni was sitting at the table silently and Tony was proud that he showed he had good manners. There wasn’t much else Tony could have taught him over the years. “I might need a map to find my way around.” He smiled and rested a hand on the silver knife, his fingers running over the cold and beautiful metal.
Steve tipped his hat to Tony and left without a word, Jones in front of him and Dugan behind.
He lowered him onto the bed, softly as possible, his head on Steve’s pillow and Steve got rid of his own shirt and then unbuttoned Tony’s. He leaned down, pressing hot and heavy kisses all over his chest and stomach, down to his trousers and then he was looking up at Tony for permission, his fingers waiting to snap open the button and finish undressing him.
Grateful to be given something he could do, Tony made his way upstairs. Steve had told him that his mother was the boss and she had asked Tony to wake him, which meant his bedroom wasn’t off-limits now. The realization that he was about to see Steve’s bedroom hit him when his hand touched the door handle. Was he the neat type? Or rather messy? What would it look like inside? Warm and cozy like the rest of the house? Was it decorated in his favorite colors? What
“Yes?” Steve said.
Steve froze for a second when Tony handed him the phone and then spoke, “Hey, ma.”
And yet Steve never reacted the way Tony thought he would. Why him?
“I’m not. He’s the son of ma’s friend. He’s workin’ a steady job and ma wants me looked after. Happy’s a nice enough fella, I guess, just not who I saw myself marryin’.” She leaned back and crossed her legs gracefully. “Ma says marryin’ a friend is better than marryin’ someone I can’t stand. From friendship comes love, she says.”
Tony raised an eyebrow, smirking slightly. Now things were really getting interesting. “I’ve known him a minute longer than you. I don’t know. I’ve never seen Steve with someone like me and he proved me wrong. Ask me something easier.”
Steve Rogers.”
“Thank you,” Steve said and turned back to O’Shea with a raised eyebrow. “You stood there and watched us chase little issues and didn’t say a word about the deductions you had been making,” Steve said, sitting down in his chair, his arms crossed. He motioned for Tony to come stand beside him. “Granted he’s gifted,” Steve began, pointing up to Tony, “but he found you out in less than half an hour. I can promise you your punishment will last a lot longer if you don’t talk now.”
know what love feels like.”
As usual, Tony was the first one up. The darkness made it impossible for him to actually stay in bed if he wasn’t able to fall asleep again, so he went to the back door to look outside. He still didn’t want to feel the cold but he was longing for fresh air. Was there no air left in this room? Or was that just how he felt? He felt panic rising inside of him, so he decided to make coffee, tea, and prepare a new loaf of bread for later today. Physical work was a good way to keep his mind occupied and keep him in the now.
There was a loud slap on the other end of the line and James swore under his breath in Russian, gritting his teeth and once again imagining all the ways he would find to hurt Bakuto once they had them back. There was no way in hell he would let him off with a quick death.
They were stalling, straining to hear any sound in the background that might help them narrow down his location in relation to the list of buildings owned by him that Gao had provided. A train? A ship? Heavy traffic? Anything.
“Really?” Falsworth asked. “You’re still trying to do anything with honor? There’s no honor for your kind.”
In fact, the first time, the door had hit him as it opened because he was on the floor beside it, straining his ears to hear something, anything. They had come in and he knew they were throwing insults at him but he couldn’t hear them so he just stared. It irritated them and he didn’t see them again for a few days until they came back.
Stocked up for the next two weeks, they made the little five minute drive from the center to the cottage that lay on the outskirts of Ballycastle. It was in the middle of seemingly nowhere and about half a kilometer from the cliff edges that overlooked the ocean.
“I brought you some lunch,
“He’s the troublemaker, I’m the good one,” he teased and Steve nearly choked. Sarah was laughing too. “What?” James asked, faking offense.
“How did you know?”
“And you think she’d be bothered?” Tony asked, glad to feel Steve like he did. “I know you won’t but let me enjoy this for another minute or two.” He closed his eyes. He couldn’t rely on Steve and he knew that. He needed to be strong for him. But his arm around Tony’s shoulder made him feel all the things he missed the past few weeks.
“Hey,” Steve said as he pulled away and rolled out of the bed, going over to the desk in the corner of the room and opening the drawer. “I have something for you. Something I thought you might like. Might want.”
“No, my food has never smelled that good,” James chuckled. “Sarah’s here.”
Steve’s eyebrows went up in shock. Just him. What did that mean exactly? Had Steve actually made someone question towards whom they felt love? That he found hard to believe but harder still that Tony only liked him. He still didn’t totally understand but he would accept it. Kind of.
“So did you call just to ask me if I’m clothed? It’s an odd reason but you’re an odd person.”
“You know, I’m more than a little disappointed to actually find you here,” he told him, sitting on the end of the bed.
He pulled back slowly, resting his forehead against Tony’s and breathing hard.
Once he made sure that he could maintain a straight face again, he went back to the kitchen. Sarah had her hands on her sides and scoffed.
Tony was hard and that thought drove Steve crazy. Tony’s body was reacting this way to
She patted his shin and stood. “Why don’t you have a kip, I’ll bring you tea and biscuits in an hour so you don’t sleep the day away, hm?” He nodded, already beginning to drift and when he laid down, she insisted on tucking him in. Sarah tucked in her mob boss son and she didn’t think any less of him for letting his mother do it nor did he protest. Sometimes he just needed his ma.
Tony furrowed his brows, unsure where this was going. He didn’t like it, that was for sure. “Because he was yelling at my little brother and I was afraid he would hit him. I made my brother hide and it made Howard furious.”
“I am too. I was proud when you finally learned to use my nine-inch.” Steve raised his eyebrows suggestively and he and James laughed before James added, “did you tell him my offer?”
Steve’s head was pounding, he never did do well with pain medications, and he squeezed his eyes shut when Tony turned on the light. “What happened? Why are you here? Is everyone okay?” By the time he got to the last sentence, his eyes were open despite the brightness and he was searching for any sign of harm on Tony and then he got to his face and found it. “What’s wrong?”
“Thank you,” Tony said sincerely.
James stopped in front of him and gave him a smile that made him shudder and Steve laughed.
Tony tasted better than Steve could have imagined and the fact that he couldn’t keep still, bucking into Steve’s mouth and moaning his name, made the whole experience that much better. Steve just wanted his first time as memorable and enjoyable as possible. He knew Tony wouldn’t last long, not only because he was inexperienced but because Steve was just about an expert by now.
feeling would wear off soon and he could relax.
Dmitri came in a moment later with Benni and turned to James. “James,” he said and Sarah was shocked to hear him call him by his first name but James didn’t react more than to turn to him, “phone call.
“Isn’t it your turn to cook?” Jones asked.
“Everything.”
James’ smile widened. He constantly told Clint that he didn’t care if the others liked him or not because
“Because you have to heal? And you’re not able to do things?” Tony asked. It made sense. Steve was a very hands-on busy man who didn’t have a lot of downtime. “You’re going to be back at work sooner than you know. Can’t you at least try and enjoy some rest?”
“But what if he comes here?” Benni cried against Tony’s chest.
“Edward!” Howard barked entering the kitchen in the store while Tony was topping up containers of olives. “You
“Here,” Steve said, handing him another filled glass. “Sleep, my love, and whenever you’re feeling up to it, I’ll make the call. One more before you sleep.” He gently held Tony’s chin between his thumb and index finger, turning him to kiss him again. How he had missed him. His voice, his smile, his laugh! He had missed those big brown eyes that seemed so soft and warm when Steve looked into them. He’d missed Tony’s touches and kisses.
They talked for just over an hour before Steve’s yawning was the majority of the conversation and Tony decided to let him go so he could get some sleep.
“We wouldn’t be in this mess if I had acted sooner.”
He crouched down and counted to thirty, listening in the darkness for any noise that would indicate that guards were walking.
“Exactly,
They didn’t end up using a guest room that night because despite everything, Steve just wanted to hold Tony and today hadn’t been the best day on record.
He was lying on his stomach, legs in the air and ankles crossed, a large sketchbook laid out in front of him with crayons and pencils. He was drawing some people playing cards. Steve sat down on the floor beside him and tapped the page.
He felt the wind created by the slam of the door behind him and he waited, slowly going back to his mattress. He turned to Tony, his face still stinging from that last slap.
“You got it, love.” He leaned in for another minute of slow kissing. He knew he wouldn’t be gone long but his brain was already in holiday mode. He was already miles away in their cottage, the fire going, hot drinks in their hands, bundled up together on the couch while Steve listened to Tony read to him. It was so close he could almost feel the warmth of the fire on his cheeks.
“We’ll let you know,” James said, his tone dismissive and Mr Delmonico, the poor bastard, thanked him and left. Once he was gone, James looked up. “Obviously this goes without saying but order whatever you like. This is my treat.”
fear you?”
With freshly brushed teeth and his hair warm and fluffy from drying it, Tony got dressed and was about to head out of the room when he heard a snore from behind him. For a second he froze in sheer panic but then what was there to be afraid of? But would Steve really be sleeping already?
“Get that trash out of my sight,” Bakuto snapped, continuing his conversation with James as Clint was dragged out.
Clint hated how scared he sounded and felt. He
“It is.”
are smart and brave, aren’t you?” Benni smiled, nodding. “That’s a good lad.” He pressed a kiss to his hair and told him to have a good day and that he’d see him later, and disappeared down to the basement, waiting for Tony.
nice. He would’ve told you if he wasn’t interested.”
From behind him he heard Steve snoring softly and his heart nearly skipped a beat. He snored. Steve Rogers, head of the Irish mob
She thought back. “Neither of them mentioned one. I can go back and ask—”
you, and we need information from him so I can’t kill him yet.”
“I do.” And he meant that. “And you do too, right?”
she began,
James smiled again, just as sad. “All past tense.” Steve looked down, trying to take his hand, surprised when James let him.
Tony and Benni go to the zoo! Steve attends the yearly meeting. Tony has a request.
“No ice? Something really must be bothering you,” James said. “We don’t just meet here to sit in silence and look menacing,” he joked. He looked Steve up and down, noting his posture and when he came back up, Steve was watching him intently.
When the papers arrived in a brown manilla envelope that looked like nothing special was going to be in there, Tony almost couldn’t believe his eyes. This was it. There it was, his new name, new ID, and even a new passport. Rationally he had known that they had gotten their pictures taken for their papers but to see them in front of him was a completely alien thing.
Before Pepper could react, Tony was out of the kitchen heading to the library and flipping through the collection of records. Should he ask Steve? Surely he wouldn’t mind, right? Not like they were going to need it if they were going on holiday soon. Just to be on the safe side, he headed to Steve.
Steve chuckled quietly, still perusing the information. So far, based on the information gathered, they knew quite a bit about their serial arsonist. Unfortunately it wasn’t anything they could use to identify them but at least they now had a general timeframe in which the arsonist was most likely planting the device and they were able to create a perimeter in which they assumed he would strike next. He was active, he’d hit two diners in the last two weeks. It didn’t feel like much of a stretch to assume he’d hit a third next week.
James smiled. “How’s exquisite?”
He hoped James was alright.
He sat down beside him, pulling Tony halfway onto his lap, his arm curling around his waist and his hand resting on Tony’s thigh.
“Dugan.”
“He has his days,” she added and Steve sighed.
“How did I not think of that?” Rhodey opened it and pulled out the containers, searching for egg rolls. “So you like him? Enough for a second date or you just in this for the sex?” Rhodey asked it as casually as possible but he knew by the drawn out silence before Tony’s response that he had worked out that Rhodey really wanted to know.
Steve ground his jaw, still staring at Tony, watching his face and the way he searched for answers while he spoke. No one telling the truth did that. “Hm,” was all he said and nodded at Jones who was at the door to escort Tony out.
“I think it’s safe to say that I’m unlike most people you’ve met, so that part shouldn’t be too surprising,” Tony joked lightly, not liking how sad Steve looked. “What good would it do if I tried to change you?” Tony asked. “You must know about Pepper’s older brother? The one no one talks about anymore. He was my classmate when I was still going to school before my sister died.” When everything had been okay. “My mom was actually the one to help him get out of here before his family could... whatever it was they wanted to do to him. He even stayed with us for a night when Howard wasn’t there. I asked her why and she said because it’s no one’s business what anyone feels and because love is always worth fighting for. She said ‘so whatever you feel, whatever you want, as long as everyone involved is happy, nothing else matters.’” Lately he found it much easier to think and talk about his mother. Maybe it was because Sarah reminded him of her sometimes, or maybe it was just the distance he was gaining from Howard. “My mom was romantic like that.”
He was okay. He was alive. And James could hear him.
Dugan and Jones were in a room across from Steve’s, all three on the VIP floor receiving the best care money could buy. They only had minor wounds—a concussion for Dugan and a broken arm from hitting it on the steering wheel; Jones also had a concussion and three cracked ribs from the seat belt.
“Alright.” He took the fountain pen Steve had given him and with Tony’s help he wrote his name on the paper.
“It’s so nice to have you dining with us again tonight. Always a pleasure. Anything we can do to make your visit more tasteful, you just say the word,” he said and Clint almost felt sorry for him because James turned away in the middle of his sentence to look at the menu.
With Clint next to him his anxieties were much more quiet since he didn’t have to worry about his friend being away. That also meant that he was paying more attention to his surroundings and what was happening. He saw Steve and the look in his eyes that he tried to hide.
Clint looked over at him. “Probably,” he agreed, nodding his head.
might be when he would get in trouble. James would probably curse him out for even thinking it.
Clint woke first, the pain in his leg demanding his attention. Natalia was still curled up beside him, reading quietly and hit the clicker that gave him another dose of morphine. James was on the other side of the bed in a chair reading the paper.
Steve sighed. “Look, you mook,” he started, looking at James but the corner of his mouth was turned up in a grin. “It was almost dark, I wanted to catch her attention so she’d come out because her old man was a real tough one.”
“That he knows of,” Steve added, because Steve was certain he would still be conducting himself in the same manner had Bakuto taken his ma or Benni. Even Dugan. And James would raise hell if Dmitri were taken. Or Natalia, it seemed.
“Did you sleep well?” He asked instead of answering his question. Sometimes Benni looked much younger than he was and other times he looked older. Once he looked at his big brother’s face Benni seemed to be much older.
you.”
keep them in mind. Steve smiled softly, his kisses now gentle again.
“Pet, why don’t you bring down the photo album? Show the boys?” Sarah suggested, Benni leaning against her—she’d pulled his chair closer—while she played with his hair.
He couldn’t focus on it, though, and quickly found himself instead leaning back in his chair, trying to daydream about France but he couldn’t do that either. Not while Clint was at home battling inner demons James couldn’t touch. It made him furious, antsy, and he needed an outlet.
So instead he got changed and went to the gym. An hour and a half later, he came back in for breakfast, sweaty and tired. He’d fallen asleep somewhere around 4:30am.
“Thanks,” he said, finally feeling some of the tension fading from his body, leaving him more exhausted than when he’d gone to sleep. “Just a nightmare.” He knew he wouldn’t be able to hear what Tony said in reply but still he wanted to talk.
He leaned away, moving his head out of James’ grip and shaking it. James took a step back and picked up his shirt from the dresser, acting like it had never happened and he’d never suggested it. Acting like someone who suggested casual sex would. Only problem was, that wasn’t what he was suggesting.
“We’re going to Nova Scotia first? Wow, I’ve never been to Canada before,” he sat down on the table to read the brochure thoroughly. “That’s a lot of days of endless ocean. Oh look! There’s an outside area for our deck. Can we go there when we— wait, what is it called? When the ships gets going.” He jumped away from the table and headed straight to Steve to check his pocket watch. “We’ve got fifteen more minutes until then.”
Clint and Tony are home but they're a long ways from being alright. James and Steve brainstorm ways to make their homecoming easier. As per usual, Sarah Rogers comes in clutch.
James looked up and met eyes with Dmitri in the mirror, giving him a smile.
It was very unlike him not to notice someone entering the room. The fact that Steve had managed meant that either Tony was trusting him more than he was aware or that Steve was just a lot sneakier. Slowly he sat back down and took deep breaths. It was fine. If there was someone he could trust, it was Steve.
, he wanted to yell and one look at Sam told him he felt the same. He was glad Rhodey was alright, beyond glad, but for fuck’s sake, how was Steve?
Tony did his best to keep from clutching the phone to his chest and grinning happily. He was a grown man after all and this was only his second date with Steve. He should not have been this affected.
“I think,” he said, pointing to two of the locations that were both situated along the East river, “that the word was ‘river’.”
pissed but refusing to call.
Loki turned on the lights and sat on the couch, Steve and James taking a seat opposite him.
, I guess,” Clint teased and both of them rolled their eyes, “but I won’t lie and say I’m not gonna miss you. Like a lot.”
Dmitri inhaled deeply and nodded.
“I don’t want that for Clint either. Though knowing how they both are, I don’t think it’ll be much of a friendship right away.”
?” He said while not breaking eye contact with Steve and taking a deep breath before continuing. “Then maybe we should make it a daily appointment. You and me sitting down to talk?”
Clint sighed. Maybe this wasn’t such a good idea after all. At least at home he could speak freely and not worry about it freaking anyone out.
“They’re all fine, love.” Steve walked over to Tony. wrapped his arm around his shoulder.
? That I wouldn’t want someone who comes from the same upbringing as myself?” He wasn’t angry, he was confused and hurt that he had given Tony that impression.
He licked his lips and shrugged. Just because he had no experience didn’t mean he didn't have fantasies. “I’ll go make sandwiches. Jones asked for them.” He leaned in and kissed his neck right under his ear. “Or else I’ll have to take half the day off,” he whispered and winked at him as he walked to the kitchen, swaying his hips an unnecessary amount.
Tony moved his lips, wanting to say something but he didn’t. There was a difference between taking care of Benni and him and Tony being together with her son. He closed his eyes and breathed in deeply.
“Yes, exactly.” He smiled and sighed in relief. Benni would be fine, no matter what. “
“You can always return should you change your mind,” Monet told him, retrieving the box for the ring and then the box that box went into.
“I think a trip just the two of us would be just what the doctor ordered,” Steve said, grinning. With the hand holding his face, he guided Tony forward and kissed him again, tasting coffee and something that was entirely just Tony. He broke the kiss with a heavy sigh again.
“Sure,” he said in response and thought about his offer. He liked working but without Steve in the same room as him it did get lonely. “There’s some things I wanted to do. And I’m supposed to meet Pepper later.”
“Yes!” Steve gasps. He desperately wants to touch the alpha, feel his soft, warm skin. He wants to hold him close and kiss the parts of him he can reach. But he holds off.
Steve chuckles. “Okay, Petey.”
“Maybe,” Pepper smirks. “You had a meeting today but I canceled it. Don’t get your hopes up. You have one next week that can’t be missed. You should go home and rest.”
“Nat,” Steve gasps suddenly, and his body slumps in her arms.
“You promise?”
Hello! Hope everyone is doing well! I just wanted to warn you guys about the bit of angst in this chapter. I mean, it’s me so what did you expect? 😆 I swear there will be more fluffy stuff on the way!
His mind is whirling, unable to fully comprehend the situation. He shouldn’t have a baby. He wasn’t pregnant...at least, he thought he wasn’t. And yet in his arms was the son he never knew about.
“Hmm?”
“I’m just saying you need more...comfortable options.”
“Yeah. There’s no rush. We can wait.” Tony smiles. He personally wants to get a start on their son’s nursery, but he knows how tired Steve must be feeling. He was the one who just had a baby.
Soft footsteps reach his ears and he turns around, finding the woman coming toward him. She scans the badge clipped to the front of her coat and the door opens.
Tony moves closer, almost as if the omega is some kind of magnet that’s drawing him in. Up close, Tony is able to get a better view. The omega is massive, his frame unlike anything Tony has ever seen. He could put some alphas to shame.
Sam curses to himself once the phone call from Nick Fury ends. He sits back against the sofa in the common room and lets out a heavy sigh. He knew the phone calls would return and he’d have to resume his role as an Avenger. He just didn’t think it would be this soon.
“Are you okay?” Ned asks.
“And Spider-Man,” Sam says proudly.
They don’t speak.
Steve can only sob harder. The sound is painful, and a part of Tony hates that he’s the reason for causing his husband such immense pain. But it needed to be done. It was for the best.
“You okay?” Steve asks again. He leans against the counter and sips from his mug.
But a part of him knows his parents would never disown him. His dad might yell and his papa would look at him with disappointment, but they’d never do anything worse than that. They loved him. Or so they liked to claim.
“How can you be so sure?” Steve scoffs and shakes his head. He digs into the white rice, only to grimace. The appetite he had was lost now, but he reminds himself of the life he needs to nourish. “Sorry,” Steve mutters and with a sigh he sets his fork down. “I think I’m gonna go to bed.”
Natasha and Peter go into the small kitchen with the cake while Clint and Thor make their way over to where Bruce and Tony are. Tony stiffens under the burning gaze of his old teammates. He hadn’t expected Thor to show up, not when the god was usually back at his motherland or in a galaxy far far away.
Bruce smiles and presses his stethoscope to Steve's chest, listening to steady beatings of his heart. “So far everything looks good. Tony did mention that you heal at an...abnormal rate.”
“Just remember what I taught you. You’re strong, Pete. I know you have what it takes to...keep fighting.”
“I don’t think so. I think he’s still in there. Maybe we just need to use a lot of force to get him out.”
“I feel it too. I don’t want to jump ahead but I-"
“I’m sorry,” Steve says, his voice so low it’s almost a whisper. Tony still picks up the two words and pulls Steve closer.
Tony winces. “I played him a voicemail that Steve had left. I swear it was only to...I guess reminisce isn’t the right word. God knows I don’t want to remember the voicemail.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He didn’t belong anymore. He wasn’t one of them.
“So it is my baby?”
Peter grips the paper tight and crumples it in his hand. Sam pats his shoulder again, then he rises to his feet and goes back inside.
“Not that.”
Happy chuckles softly. “Believe me, kid, I know. I’m having to throw them out. Hopefully I won’t have to throw out that boyfriend of yours.”
Tony winces. He forgot to mention to his husband the change in that plan. “Actually she’s not coming.”
“We can go.”
The sound of the elevator arriving captures their attention and they both look up right as the doors open and Steve steps out. He looks refreshed from a shower, and for a moment Tony wonders if this would be the day Steve acted like himself.
“Fine. Then explain. Explain to me why I forced myself on you. Explain why I was targeted.”
“Perfect. We might be able to get some work done.”
Steve sighs. “I have my support group at 11:30, remember?”
Sam chuckles. “And it just so happens to be one of the most famous. You must get that a lot, huh?”
“It’s okay. I know how much of a fanboy you are. Hey! We should sell it on eBay or something.”
Tony rises to his feet and grabs the throw blanket from the back of the sofa and places it over Peter’s sleeping form. The tv is shut off and a light is left on.
Tony was ready to blame the shift in Steve’s character over the lack of sleep and other changes that came with a new baby. He was still recovering from the birth and it made sense that his body would be thrown out of whack. Tony just didn’t realize how thrown off it really was.
“I think he’s ready for bed,” Steve says and he holds out his arms for Tony to take their son. Steve stretches his arms over his head and groans softly when his back pops. “I’m ready for bed.”
Whatever the reason, Peter decides to go alone, at least for the first meeting.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Just hold on! I’ll be right back.” Tony jumps to his feet and rushes down the hall.
“Then promise you’ll be good for your uncle and we’ll go,” Steve says.
It was progress.
Steve makes a face. He hasn’t forgotten about the time James snapped at the bodyguard.
Tony sighs. “I’ll talk to him. I feel like an asshole for how I reacted.”
“I guess. But I know you’re going to blame me! I probably shouldn’t have said what I said but I just lost it. I swear I’m trying, Pep. I’m trying to be a good husband, a good father. I’m trying to be what he needs but sometimes...God, I feel like an asshole for thinking this, but sometimes it’s too much. I’d never leave him; I love him. But...it’s hard. Dealing with this is just so hard.”
Steve scoffs and shakes his head. “It’s funny. Our first kiss was our last.”
“I’m coming,” Steve assures and climbs out of bed. He sneaks a glance in his mate’s direction, not surprised to find Tony undisturbed from his peaceful slumber. Tony rarely got any sleep at all, so finding him still asleep doesn’t bother Steve. He could handle the kids by himself. Tony did a lot and needed a break.
“Steve.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He’s saved by the sound of a car coming toward the front of the school. Peter glances up just as the black Audi pulls up in front of him. Peter shoves his phone into his pocket and opens the passenger door to climb inside.
Steve is at the playground, disguised in one his worn baseball caps. Bucky is with him, dressed similar. Tony smiles. Some things never change.
“We’re sorry,” Steve says first, then nudges his husband to add on.
“Hey,” he says still in that calm tone. “Let me help you out. I can give you a ride.”
“Good. Go nuts.”
But then those jitters turn to excitement when he realizes they’re meeting with Nick Fury.
“Have a good day!” Steve calls out.
Peter’s scared about what lies ahead, but at the same time he can’t help but feel giddy. This was his first mission, his chance to be a hero and fight alongside his family. He’d been waiting for this moment for as long as he could remember.
“More like terrifying. We’re having a baby.”
“Yes! Jesus. Okay, fine you win. I left because...I was scared. I’m not good at anything.”
Steve switches on the living room light, illuminating the space and revealing his oldest pup curled up on the sofa with a blanket.
“It’ll get better,” Bucky shoots his nephew a reassuring smile.
“Yeah or we can cancel the whole shower and do this. It is your birthday, remember?” Tony chuckles and pulls Steve even closer and presses his lips to the side of his head.
The alarm eventually ends, leaving the room in a peaceful silence again. There was no way he’d fall back asleep again and with a huff Tony throws the blankets off himself.
“Hold your son, Tony.”
“I want you.”
“So we’re playing twenty questions again?”
Peter nods and sits up. They don’t say anything at first; Peter is too scared to open his mouth and Tony is unsure of how to break the awkwardness between them. They never used to be this way. Peter never used to fear having a conversation with him. Tony has himself to blame. He shouldn’t have been so hard on his son. Not when Peter needed him the most.
For years he’s been trying to escape Hydra’s clutches. The abuse and tormenting they put him through was something he could no longer endure. He had been willing to accept it at one point, but then they made their agenda clear, and he wasn’t going to let them hurt anymore of his pups.
Tony leads the way and together they enter the elevator. Steve appears even more hesitant about being in the elevator than he did when Tony offered him a car ride. He backs himself into a corner and his eyes squeeze shut. One hand falls to his belly; Tony wonders if he’s getting sick to his stomach.
“You’d tell me blah blah blah. Yeah whatever. Just hurry up and get in the shower.”
Tony doesn’t say out loud that he wishes they had met under better circumstances. But at least they did cross paths. Tony was at least grateful for that.
“When was this?” Peter asks.
“I don’t know. I look in the mirror and I don’t see myself. Everything is different.”
Pepper sighs. “Okay. Be safe.”
Steve doesn’t appear to notice Tony’s attitude and lowers his shirt, then he disappears to the bathroom to start his nightly routine.
“It’s okay,” Tony assures and he pauses working. “I’m not gonna lie but I’m curious about how he-”
Tony chuckles. “It’s a long story. Is now a good time to hear it?”
“Don’t worry about it.”
“Fine. So what’s up? You came looking for me for a reason.”
“Be nice!” Steve makes sure to call out. He can only hope Tony listens this time.
“You know I'd pick them first, but Nick says you’re the best,” Sam retorts.
“Yeah,” Sam nods and he folds his arms over his chest. He smiles again. “I wanted to honor him. And I like helping people. Especially the type of people that come in here. I’ve seen and helped a lot of broken omegas.”
Steve frowns. “I don’t care what people think.”
Peter shuts his eyes, but that only makes the image more vivid. He can still see his father on the table, covered in blood and struggling to fight. Tears well in his eyes and Peter squeezes them tighter, praying that the scene would end.
“No,” Steve interrupts with a shake of his head. “I’m okay. He just kicked me really hard.”
“Huh.”
“Right.” Tony jumps to his feet and rushes around the desk to walk his son out. “Let me give you my number. I should’ve done that before.”
Peter doesn’t notice him right away, but once he does, his face is lighting up and he runs over. Tony has to back up so that they don’t collide with each other.
“There’s your baby.” Bruce points to what Peter can only describe as a blob. It has no real shape; it doesn’t resemble a baby at all.
The woman trembles and tears stream down her face. She doesn’t appear to be the type to make a stupid decision and disbobey him, but Tony wasn’t going to take any chances. He didn’t need his cover blown now.
“You’re afraid of your name being tainted?”
“I just gave you three things that I’ll enjoy. You said anything I want.”
Steve shoots his husband a sympathetic smile and leans forward in his chair, taking Tony’s hand and giving it a reassuring squeeze. “You’re doing good, Tony. Peter will be here soon and you’ll see how it was worth it, how beautiful.”
“I’m happy,” Steve replies with a smile. “I found something out and…”
“I know. It’s just-it’s different now. He’s-and Pete…”
“You okay?” Comes Bucky’s voice and Steve opens his eyes, finding a pair of blue concerned ones staring back at him. He shouldn’t be surprised that it would be his best friend coming over to check on him.
“Wow.”
Pepper smiles. “Those are beautiful names.”
“I’m fine.”
“Hey,” Natasha reaches for Steve’s hand and gives it a reassuring squeeze. “He’s okay. How many times has he been hit and he walks it off?”
“Then why does it always seem like you’re too busy with Peter and Harley and being Avengers? You don’t ask how my day was or if I’d like to go on runs. You can’t even help me with a stupid project.”
“What? Made up? Like I did it for money? I didn’t even know you, Tony! I knew nothing about you. I was ready to raise this baby alone before you showed up.”
Harley kicks in response. Tony rests his head over the bump and rubs the area with one hand. “We’re so excited. You don’t know how much you being here means to us. We love you so much. And I promise I’m going to be a good dad. Just ask your big brother.”
“Talk...I guess.”
Sam and Bucky were also in a disagreement...with each other. No surprise there. Sam was sure the baby was a boy whereas Bucky was siding with Natasha. The bickering they had over the topic only increased Tony’s headache.
“You have to go, Tony. I know it’s difficult because Steve isn’t there, but a part of him is and that part needs you right now more than ever.”
“Is that what the muffins are for?” Steve gestures to the bag of baked goods.
The space falls silent when three figures step into the jet; Peter recognizes them immediately, his face lighting up at the sight of his family. But then he notices the lifeless form of his papa, his heart sinking.
Tony nods and tries to do as he’s told. He closes his eyes and breathes steadily. Steve is touching him again, teasing his hole with the tip of his finger before slowly pressing it inside. Tony tenses, preventing Steve from pushing any further.
“Of course, sir.”
Tony sighs. “Well stop. I’m capable of having this kid.”
“You can back out.”
Bruce catches on immediately. “Yeah. Yeah I understand. I’ll check okay?”
“Kiss me again.”
“Mr. Stark, let me start off by saying that you are a gift to this world. Your work has helped shape this planet.”
Thank you guys so much for the wonderful response! I’m so happy and excited that everyone is loving this so far! 🥰
“Hey. You all right?”
“I’m not. I mean not re-”
“But?”
“You’ll be fine. You can run this operation a hell of a lot better than I can. It’s who you are, Rogers.”
Tony grins. “I don’t see why not.”
“I know,” Steve turns back toward his mate, “but I’m willing to do it again. I’m going to need someone to talk to.”
The large bed in the center had always been a part of his plan. Its purpose was to be comfortable enough for him to rest and recover, and for Steve to be close by if he were to need him. There was no way in hell Steve was sleeping on the couch on the other side of the room.
Tony completely avoids Clint and Bucky. Sam and Natasha were being civil and even Thor had managed to start up a conversation with him. Tony knew he wouldn’t be welcomed back with open arms, but at least more than half of the team were willing to interact with him.
“I try. I do love this kid. I can’t imagine life without him. Guess it’s a good thing you got pregnant, huh?”
“I’m sorry you’re arguing because of me. This is why I didn’t want anyone to know.”
movies,” Peter adds, giggling even more.
The new sensation only adds to his already growing concern. He tries to ignore it like he has been, but even that is becoming difficult. When the pain passes, he’s able to compose himself and scrub himself clean.
Steve nods and glances down at the sleeping pup in his arms. “They’re worth it.”
“Will you two stop it!” Natasha intervenes and both Sam and Bucky fall silent. She waits until she holds everyone’s attention before continuing. “Sam’s right. This isn’t about us. It’s about Peter. He’s the one dealing with the most right now. Steve meant something to all of us but to Peter he meant so much more. Do you really think Steve would want us keeping his son away from Tony? Steve didn’t want that, remember? He wanted Peter to know Tony.”
Steve isn’t asleep, and Tony finds him curled around himself and staring blankly at the wall. Tony lets out a small sigh and crawls in beside him, wrapping his arms around him and pressing a kiss to the back of his neck. “Honey, talk to me. What’s wrong?” Tony asks, sensing that something other than sleep deprivation was affecting Steve.
“Stop being Captain America. I remember he came home one night and...and the bad guys hadn’t gone easy on him. I promised I’d keep him safe...and I couldn’t.”
“Morning.” Steve grins and works on finishing scrambling the eggs. “You took forever getting ready.”
They would all rotate during the night and take turns whenever Peter woke up. But despite the extra help Steve had, he was still utterly exhausted. Having a baby was hard.
Tony hates how broken Steve is. Knowing that they have a baby was a shock, but what he was feeling didn’t compare to what Steve was going through. He wasn’t the one who had to carry and birth the baby. Steve had to do it all and without knowing.
Tony sighs harshly. “And you believed him? Honey, I’m sorry but you just can’t have a baby. Your body-”
“I might.”
“Relax. I trust you. Make yourself comfortable. Steve’s almost ready then we’ll be heading out.”
Now that he can get a good look at his son, he studies the barely developed features. He can make out Steve’s nose and lips on their son’s face.
“California. I have a mansion in Malibu that we can lay low in for a while. Maybe until the baby is born.”
They ride out the high together, their lips meeting in a sloppy kiss.
The only item furnishing the room is a single mattress, laid out in the center of the stone floor. It’s dirty and torn from obvious wear and tear.
He doesn’t get a chance to respond to her. The man is coming toward him again. Steve moves quickly to stand, only to pause when the pain returns. He tries to ignore it and rise to his feet, but he’s not quick enough and he gasps in pain when he’s kicked in the stomach. He goes down, unable to find the strength to get back up. But he knows he has to.
“James, come here,” Steve opens his arms, hoping that his pup responds positively and crawls into them like Harley and Sarah had. The pup peers up at him, blue eyes full of fear and concern. He glances at the other alpha in the room, baring his teeth and a small growl rumbling in his chest. “He’s okay,” Steve assures and James looks at him again. “Daddy’s okay.”
“I said I didn’t want to hear it.”
Tony huffs. Jarvis was right. It could be another form of bonding for them.
“Now about what I was saying,” Steve says. His son refuses to acknowledge him, too engrossed in the blocks. “Walking is terrifying but you’ll love it. Pretty soon you’ll be wandering all over the place and..."
Harley, being the sneaky one that he is, dips a finger into the batter and runs away giggling before anyone can scold him. Steve just huffs and shakes his head.
Hi! I know this one is getting the most updates but it’s been the only one I have the most ideas for. I’ll work on the rest when I’m off.
“I think you’re trying to run away again.”
“Forget it.”
They stay wrapped in each other’s arms, relishing in the comfort that only being with each other brings. For a moment the party is forgotten, all Tony cares about is making sure his mate is content. Steve was always going to come first.
“I’m sorry,” Tony apologizes. There’s no ounce of sincerity in his words. He wasn’t sorry. Not anymore.
“I don’t know if I can make you understand,” Steve says, his voice quiet and soft. He forces himself to meet Tony’s eyes, showing off the tears that have formed in his own.
Tony’s pleased. “I knew it would work. Let’s try the other one hmm?”
“I know. This call wasn’t just about business, Tony. I just wanted to make sure you were doing okay. You haven’t come by in a while. Happy misses you.”
“I know. I swear I’m going to fix this. As soon as the baby’s born-”
“Papa, it’s okay,” Morgan tries to defuse the situation. She didn’t want her parents to fight again.
A part of him wants to put the suit away and demand Tony take it back to wherever the hell it came from, but he’s intrigued. If Tony insisted he take him out for a nice dinner, then Steve shouldn’t refuse. Tony did say he’d make up for forgetting.
Tony smiles “I’d like that.”
Tony kisses Steve’s neck again, moving closer until his lips are near the mark embedded in Steve’s skin. The omega offers his neck, allowing Tony to kiss him on his bond mark.
The other alpha smiles. “I know who this guy is,” Sam says and holds out a hand. “Sam Wilson.”
“How do you not know anything about him?”
Dodger’s attention is grabbed the second Tony comes through with Peter in tow. Much to Tony’s relief, Dodger doesn’t jump or bark.
Despite wanting to hide away from the harsh reality, Tony knows he can’t. Lord knows Jarvis wouldn’t approve if he tried to pretend that he didn’t feel anything.
Tony curls up closer and it’s not long before he’s relaxed and drifting off to sleep. Steve remains awake, wanting to be ready in case Tony needs him again.
Though they did spend most of the day in the lab, Tony enjoyed curling up on the sofa with Dodger right beside him. Which is where Steve finds them when he returns from a briefing.
“Let me say goodnight.”
“I’m fine. I want to meet them.”
The contractions start one early morning after breakfast. Tony had made sure the pills were crushed and sprinkled into Steve’s oatmeal. He wonders if the contractions are because of his most recent poisoning, or if Steve’s body has finally had enough. Whatever the reason, Tony can breathe out a sigh of relief.
“If tonight doesn’t work then-”
They’re led to a control room of some sorts and that’s where they find the Director. Beside him are a beta man and woman that Steve had never met before.
But that doesn’t make Steve yearn for his mate any less. He understood that Tony was busy meeting with his team to work on a story for the media. The news of Tony’s rescue was still floating around the media, and sooner or later Steve’s side of the story was going to need to be told.
“You? Please. I’ve never seen you so calm. It’s making me jealous.”
“You’re sure that’s what you want to do?”
“Mama!”
Peter shakes his head and pulls away, putting space between them. “No. He went in with the team. I saw him.”
Tony sniffs the air again. “And an alpha? I thought you were an-”
“That’s really cool. Now we have another artist in the group. Sara is another one,” Sam says, gesturing to the older woman sitting across from Steve. Their eyes meet and she smiles softly. Steve smiles back, then it quickly falters. Sam senses the change in the omega almost immediately. “What’s wrong?”
Tony shakes his head and keeps working. “I need to do this.”
“Speaking of...I made a call and-it’s nothing bad I swear!” Tony quickly says when Steve tenses. “He’s a friend of mine. I just figured since you probably haven’t had any medical-”
“Steve!” Tony calls out when the omega turns and walks away. “Steve, wait! Don’t.”
Falling in love was never supposed to have happened. They were strictly teammates and that’s all they were ever going to be. Tony Stark didn’t fall in love.
Steve has just managed to get Peter bathed and ready for bed. He’s sitting in the rocking chair, quietly nursing Peter. He smiles down at his son, gently stroking the side of his face.
“Thank God. This kid is making it hard to breathe.”
Anyway! Hope you all enjoy!
Peter blinks his eyes open, his lashes sticking together from the wetness that coats them. He sniffs and wipes at his eyes, but it’s not enough. More tears escape and stream down his face.
The topic of Steve’s death never popped up in conversation. When Tony was curious and needed answers, Peter avoided talking about it. Tony knew it must be difficult for the poor kid to talk about the death of his father. Tony could relate. He didn’t talk about the death of his parents to just anyone. He kept that pain buried deep inside until finally he couldn’t push it down any further.
Ned doesn’t bring up Peter’s suspicious behavior, but as soon as they’re at the tower and Peter is leading him toward his room, Ned cracks.
Morgan doesn’t reply. She loved her brother and everyone else in their family, but lately it was like they didn’t love or care about her. She was always being pushed aside and forgotten. They were getting all the love, something she desperately yearned for.
He comes undone.
“Pete,” Sam breaks the silence first. “You know you can stay here anytime, right?”
“I think you do.”
Steve frowns.
“Steve-”
A soft knock on the door captures his attention and Peter looks up. “Come in.”
“Oh I would, huh? Probably not. I wouldn’t have to worry about you missing meetings and staying late for unnecessary parties.”
“Don’t try and be cute now, Stark.”
Tony made sure to let everyone know where he stood. It was a boy and no one was going to change his mind. He wanted a mini Steve.
“Good. Maybe now you can rest. You’re gonna be here a while.”
“Yeah. I’ll have him go.”
“Hey! Watch who you’re calling old,” Bucky says and throws an old magazine at his husband. Sam dodges the attack and laughs.
A pleased smile forms on his face when he hears the screams.
“You’re welcome. Am I the favorite now?” It’s said as a joke but Morgan was hoping her papa would agree and tell her he loves her more. He wouldn’t of course. He’s said it numerous times that he didn’t have favorites and he loves all of them the same.
His stomach drops at the thought of his parents. He’d have to tell them. They were going to want to know how their teenage son ended up pregnant. He’d have to tell them about the stupid party he snuck off too and the alcohol he drank and then lied about.
“It’s cool. I...I get it. I’m awkward too.”
Ned was a good kid. He still got tongue-tied around Steve, but that was to be expected when talking to one of the Avengers. Steve saw a lot of his own friendships in the one the two kids created over the years.
“I know,” Tony moves closer until he’s standing near Steve. “She’s going to be here when you get out. We all will. And I promise we’re going to visit all the time.”
I’m sorry that the chapter was a little on the short side. I just wanted some fluffy stuff now that the angst is over. I’ll have Tony meet the other pups and of course Jarvis, Happy, Bruce, and Pepper will come back. I thought I’d only have a two chapters left but it might be a little more.
“Why are you still hung up on that night anyway?” Happy asks and turns his attention back on the road.
Before he can consider going back into the room, Jarvis is reminding him of the important meeting he has.
“Please don’t call me that,” Peter groans. “I’m not a little kid anymore.”
Very few words are shared while they dress and work on making themselves presentable. The last they need is to be discovered and find themselves the story of the week on every news tabloid.
“Nope. Boy.”
“You didn’t even let me tell you-”
The door shuts behind his uncle. Peter dresses quickly, fighting with the t-shirt that he assumes belongs to his uncle Bucky. It’s too large around his small frame but it beats the suit he was forced to wear for most of the day.
“I told you to keep your mouth shut about that.”
Steve smiles softly and pulls Tony close, holding him tightly and enjoying the comfort only he can bring. “It’s going to be fine.”
“You forgot master Peter.”
Just the thought of his mate makes Steve’s stomach churn. Tony was forced into this abuse. It wasn’t fair. He didn’t deserve this.
“Your daddy has a shield, remember?” Peter says, getting a nod in response. He adjusts his cousin on his hip, grunting softly. “Dude, you’re getting heavy.”
All it takes is another kick to his side to have him back on the floor. He gets up again, this time on his knees and holds out a hand.
Silence again.
Maybe it was just a stomach bug.
“The kitchen. Or living room.” Tony glances down at the ground, picturing the type of flooring he’d have installed. A hardwood surface would look nice. “Come here,” Tony says and stretches out his hand for Steve.
“Your brothers aren’t stupid. They’re just-”
“No. Let’s have a baby.”
Natasha chuckles softly. “I’d be okay with it but your parents would be upset. And I know your brothers would be too. You don’t think so but they would.”
“Hey, Maguna,” Tony talks to her in a soft voice, smiling down at her when she opens her eyes and connects them with his. “You’re okay, sweetheart. Daddy’s here.”
“You won’t!” Peter quickly assures.
him still plays through Steve’s mind. He had thought he had escaped the abuse and would never have to endure it again. He had thought he’d be a free omega and get the chance to live his life, to be a mother.
“Peter was only-he was still so little! And now he’s gone! And Steve’s gone!” Pepper continues to sob. It was heartbreaking to hear her cries. Just like Bruce, she barely knew the omega that Tony was so infatuated with, but they took the time to get to know him and found out he was someone they could consider a friend, family even. And now, he and his young pup were gone too.
This time Peter stirs and the room falls silent again. Dark eyes flutter before opening and staring straight ahead. Natasha continues to rub his head.
“Tony, I’m being serious right now. Where are you?”
“Sir,” JARVIS’s voice comes through. At the new voice, Steve is jumping in his seat and scanning the room for the source.
Happy cuts in. “Tony, your meeting-”
He doesn’t allow the results to break him down. It didn’t matter. He still had a baby growing inside Tony’s belly, and that was more than enough. It was perfect.
Some days that routine is altered. The coffee is always made and the pill is never forgotten, but the run gets left out. Morgan never misses any attention.
“He’s a good guy,” Tony says and gestures for Peter to follow him to the kitchen where he has an array of takeout waiting for them on the island. “I wasn’t sure what you wanted so I ordered a bit of everything. Plus you’re a growing kid so…”
“Yep. It took longer for Peter.”
He shuffles out of the bedroom, doing his best to stifle a yawn and failing when it escapes him. The light from the second bedroom is on, something he remembers leaving off before he went to sleep. The door isn’t shut all the way and he pushes it open, finding the person responsible for disturbing him.
“Yep. You jinxed this whole thing. The mission was set up to fail from the start.”
Steve gives a small shrug in response. “Fine. Dr. Nielsen just recommended a few things to try. He also wants me to see a therapist.”
“Even if he was, I wouldn’t. He never talked bad about you.”
No one questions him when he returns downstairs. It’s as if no one noticed the lack of his presence. His teammates are seated around a few sofas, laughing and drinking, completely unaware of what just happened upstairs. Steve is with them, chatting with his new friend Sam Wilson.
“Bad?” Tony frowns. “Trust me if it was bad you’d know. Why? Did someone say-”
The alpha trails a hand between their bodies, going lower and lower until rough fingers find the omega’s entrance. Steve gasps from the unwanted touch and he’s quickly shushed. “Shh,” the alpha croons in his ear. “I’ll make it feel good. Better than he could.”
“I know.” Steve holds Tony close and presses a kiss to his head. “If it gets worse I’ll get checked out. I honestly feel fine. It’s just a little weight.”
“You’re okay,” Tony whispers when Steve emits a small whimper and curls up against Tony’s side. “It’ll all be over soon.”
“But you didn’t tell them I’m here, right? Pep, it’s important that you keep my location private. Just until I can figure this out.”
The three of them haven’t been this close since the day Morgan was born. Everything had been different then. They had just welcomed their little girl and had a new journey to embark on. They had never anticipated it to be easy, but they never imagined the devastating pain that awaited them.
“I’m fine.”
“Feel better?” Bucky asks, adding a little more pressure. Steve can only nod in response. Bucky chuckles. “Good. I can do this all day.”
“Steve. Cap, that hurts. Ow ow.”
“True, but I for one don’t really care what people think. Stopped worrying about it years ago. But if it makes you that uncomfortable then we can leave.”
“Tell me,” Tony says again, this time a little sterner. “You said we mated. Did I...force myself on you?”
“I’m really sorry.”
Miraculously he makes it through the countdown. He’s left panting for air and his lower half burns. He lifts his head to ask about his husband.
Anyway, I hope you all enjoy it!
“Maybe we should have. My best friend would still be alive.”
“Not just that. I can’t…” Tony sighs again. “I can’t stop thinking about that night.”
“On a Saturday? You promised Morgan-”
“No touching.” Tony moves away to work on shedding some of his own clothing. He strips off his jacket and shirt, a part of him wishing Steve could reach out and touch him. Steve could never keep his hands to himself.
“Something’s missing,” Sam says and brings his son over so that Steve can add his drawing. “He appreciates this. I know he does.”
Steve glances up at Tony, a mischievous glint in his eye. He tugs Tony’s jeans and underwear down his legs, exposing his hard, leaking cock. Steve leans in and licks along the head, then runs his tongue along the length.
The gift from Natasha is a fluffy red, white and blue blanket with an image of his shield printed on the front. Steve smiles as he runs a hand over the shield, already picturing wrapping his son in it.
Steve frowns at Tony. “You got Peter?”
“My men will come for me,” Pierce says, still struggling under the restraints.
Steve glances down at his belly when his son moves again. He pokes at the little foot that juts out, and laughs when it moves away.
“Fine,” Tony grumbles and he folds his arms over his chest. “But it better not be anything dumb.”
“I had a great time, though,” Steve assures, a smile forming over his lips. “I wouldn’t have agreed to a second if I didn’t.”
“No. I told you this baby wasn’t coming yet. We still have time.”
Steve is ripped from his thoughts when the elevator dings and the doors open. He spins around when a tall woman with red hair enters the living room. Her head is cast down, manicured nails clicking away on a device Steve can’t recognize.
“Yeah.” Tony smiles sadly. His thumb is still stroking along Steve’s face. He’s tempted to kiss him again, but he only knows that will lead to more and they’ve done enough. It was time for them to move on. “We can still-”
With a roll of his eyes, Happy follows the order and moves to stand by the front entrance.
Happy hasn’t bothered to hide his displeasure in the situation, not that Tony was expecting him to. Happy took his job as bodyguard very seriously. Perhaps a little too seriously. Or maybe Tony was just being stupid and risky.
“Don’t fall asleep,” Natasha says and Steve snaps his head up at her. She yawns and holds out her arms, indicating that it was her turn. Steve doesn’t hesitate to pass his son over.
“Go!”
Peter’s eyes are wide and bright when he enters the room and sees his baby brother for the first time.
“I thought you were quitting your alcohol intake.”
“So you want me coming every month? Or is Jarvis enough?”
Peter nods and quickly rushes out of the apartment. Once in the elevator and making his way down, he loses his composure and cries.
“Trust me we’ll live. The choice is yours remember? And if you want to jump back and forth then that’s okay too.”
“Buck…” Sam sighs when Bucky gets up from the couch and tries to leave the room. Sam’s hand flies out to stop him. “Wait. Sit down.”
He’s about ready to take a break when his phone rings. He half expects it to be Steve. They had already spoken and his mate had assured him he was fine, but maybe something had changed. Tony hoped not.
“You have to remember Steve probably didn’t have half of the things Peter has today. He’s just trying to give him more.”
“I know,” Tony sighs and rubs his hand along Steve’s arm. “But you never know. The plan was to get you pregnant first.”
“No. He’s cool. It’s my uncle Bucky that worries.”
Steve wants to refuse and disobey the order, but he knows Tony’s right.
Steve smiles and kisses his son on the cheek. Peter responds by wrapping Steve in another hug, this time holding him a little tighter.
Happy peers through the rear view mirror and their eyes meet. “Don’t worry, kid. Your secret’s safe with me.”
By some miracle Morgan doesn’t wake up exactly two hours later. The sun is just starting to rise when her small whimpers come through the monitor. Steve is up first, already out of bed and shuffling out of the bedroom to get to their daughter before her cries rise in volume. There was no point in going back to sleep after that, and Tony gets up, letting out a yawn and stretching before he follows his husband.
They don’t make it far into the briefing before the door is opening and Tony is entering the room. The first thing Steve notices is his husband’s appearance. His skin is clammy and his hair is slightly disheveled, a clear indication that Tony hadn’t even bothered with his usual hair routine this morning.
“Yikes.”
Happy frowns and opens his mouth to defend himself, only to shut it when he realizes it wouldn’t do any good. He says his goodbyes to Steve, glares at Tony and then leaves, grumbling to himself about how he was supposed to remove the marker from his face.
Those words bring a small smile to Peter’s face. “Okay. I love you, Papa.”
“I’ll talk to them,” Peter says and hugs Tony from the side, a smile forming over his face when Tony wraps an arm around his shoulders and they walk out the exit together. “Thank you for being here. I know you didn’t have to.”
“Save it, Rogers.” Tony rips himself free from Steve’s grasp. “It works out right? I’m engaged now. Turns out Pepper was the one. I hope you and Barnes are happy.”
This time Tony declines. He’s had enough.
Pepper is standing at the desk and speaking with a woman Tony has never seen before. The stranger appears to be in her late twenties, maybe early thirties, and has red hair. She’s attractive, he’d give her that, but there was something about her Tony couldn’t place. He blames his uneasiness toward her on all the recent drama that’s come into his life. It was hard for him to trust people these days.
“I’m sorry,” Tony says. He gives up on booting up his computers and instead makes his way over to the sofas and plops down with a heavy sigh. “I’m sorry I wasn’t there.”
Steve chuckles softly. “Yeah, I’m sure they are.”
He moves quickly to get a bottle made, knowing if he were to hold off any longer Morgan would get harder to console. Tony’s back in a matter of minutes with a warm bottle. It’s almost as if Morgan can sense her next meal is near because her cries become more urgent.
“At least they know, and are super cool about it. My dad would probably flip.”
“Sir,” Jarvis interrupts. Tony has to fight the urge to roll his eyes and tell the AI to go away. He’s ready to do just that, but then Jarvis continues. “Miss Potts is on the line.”
The way Steve’s voice takes on a deep, husky tone has Tony giving up on upgrades and setting the tablet aside.
Finding a name for their son shouldn’t be this difficult. And maybe for some it wasn’t. Maybe for others they’ve already picked out the names they’d want for their future children. Steve’s wishing they would’ve done that. At least then it wouldn’t be so hard for them to find one for their son.
Tony stumbles back, forgetting how strong his son can be, but he quickly regains himself and smiles. “Hey, kiddo. Sorry I’m late.”
Maybe the serum wasn’t working on him anymore. Maybe it was the bit of depression he found himself in that prevented him from truly understanding the beauty it was to bring a new life into the world.
But Peter forces himself to keep going and search out the person he wishes he didn’t have to find.
“Boss, you need to come back now! I think this kid is coming!”
“I’m not doing anything!” Tony yells.
Steve’s nervous to be in the spotlight. For years he had been locked away. Anyone who ever did know him believed he had died in a plane crash.
Tony takes a shaky breath and quickly wipes at his eyes, but the tears keep falling. He gives up on the piece he’s trying to upgrade. His focus is gone.
“But what about school?”
“I’m okay with that.”
The woman sobs and points down the empty corridor. Tony’s eyes follow and then they’re back on her.
Tony pulls away first and presses his lips against Steve’s ear. “Get on the bed, baby. Let me make it up to you.”
“I’m not hiding,” he lies. She can obviously see right through it. “I’m thinking.”
Steve’s pants grow louder, harsher. He must be getting close.
“You don’t! We’re not even together!”
There was a point in Tony’s life when he considered stepping away from Stark Industries and focusing on something a little more important. He had thought joining the Avengers was that missing piece, that importance he needed. He had never been so wrong.
Hope you guys enjoy the next chapter!
“Good.” Tony lies back down and he waves Steve away. “Go take a test. I’m sure you hoarded a bunch.”
“Sure, kiddo,” Bucky smiles. “You can have that room back.”
“Steve, please?” Tony begs, his vision of Steve momentarily blurred due to the tears that have gathered in them. He yanks at his restraints again. “Steve-”
And don't worry Steve will get his heats back. I mean how else are they supposed to have another pup? ;)
“Do you talk about them?”
There’s no response; it’s worrisome. Tony knocks again, assuming he hadn’t been heard the first time. Then he hears it. The sob is small, almost as if Steve was trying to conceal it. But Tony’s picked up on the sound and he turns the knob.
Steve’s face heats up at those words. Hearing those words used to make his stomach churn, but that had been when other alphas had said them. This was Tony saying them and Steve believed every word he said.
Ned nods in understanding and he releases his own sad sigh. “I’m sorry, Peter. Is there anything I can do?”
“Yeah. Guess it’s a good thing you’re taking a break from Captain America, huh?”
Peter’s voice rings out. “I’m home! Sorry I’m…” He steps into the kitchen, brows furrowing at the familiar faces he finds. He wasn’t expecting everyone to be over. “H-hey, Auntie Nat, Uncle Bruce.”
“Tony-he-he said it was okay and-”
The doors to the elevator opens and Tony rushes inside. He presses the button for his private floor and the doors close, cutting Pepper off when she tries to speak to him again. He hates that he’s hiding details from her, but he was still trying to piece things together himself. He’d let her in on everything once he had it all figured out.
Morgan turns away, glancing down at her bowl of cereal to mask the tears that gather in her eyes. She tries to tell herself that getting worked up over Peter going on a run was stupid, but the little voice in the back of her head is quick to point out that she had asked to go on one and her request had been denied.
“Don’t you have a class?”
“Don’t remember that.” Bruce adds. Natasha and him share a laugh.
“Wait, a bottle? Did you-”
“I’m not…” Tony huffs. “I’m not walking away. I’m taking a break. I didn’t want to be a part of this team anyway.”
“What? You’re telling me you’re not curious? I wasn’t even a part of the team and I still showed up.”
Steve blushes harder at those words. “Yeah? Because if you’re not sure-”
“I couldn’t have done it without you. You’re the one who lived through World War 2.”
“Thank you.”
“I have an idea,” Tony says, pulling away and ignoring the huff of annoyance Steve makes. Tony rolls over onto his side, lying next to Steve.
“You don’t want anyone to know I’m here.”
“I’m sorry,” Peter says softly, “I just wanted to know. He didn’t tell me everything. I guess I thought I deserved to know.”
“He always does, Pete,” Bucky assures.
“We’ll do our best.”
“He was sick. Probably due to my past health conditions.” Steve’s aware of the tears rolling down his face and he wipes at them again. Talking about his pups hurt. It probably always would.
Steve doesn’t appear bothered in the slightest about their son’s early arrival. Tony figures it’s because Steve has done this before and knows what to expect, or maybe it’s just his natural instincts. Omega’s were hardwired differently; they were the ones having the babies for a reason. Tony was already proving with his internal panicking why he wouldn’t be fit to be a mother.
It didn’t make sense. His body couldn’t possibly be as healthy as the doctor claimed. It was his body responsible for ending all of the pregnancies.
“I do,” he answers the question honestly. “Everyday I regret not calling him back. I regret everything. Well, aside from the night you were...you know.”
He watches as they converse among themselves and observe the weapons. Peter doesn’t understand what’s so special about the weapons, but it was probably the reason why the Avengers were called in. Peter can’t remember if this information was in the phone call he overheard.
But he wasn’t ready to be out on the field yet. His papa had told him he needed more training. He would just work hard and keep learning from the examples he had around him. He could never be Captain America. But he could be Spider-Man. And he was going to do whatever it took to become the hero and person his papa would be proud of.
“It’s probably safer here,” Peter says and he opens the door. “No one comes in here anymore.”
Thank you guys for the lovely feedback and for sticking it out with me. I really do have the best readers in the world :)
Having Steve meet with the doctor in the safety of their own home is relieving, but Tony can’t help but wonder if Steve would still struggle to open up. He was still having issues letting Tony in. Some days were better, but it was clear that he didn’t want to release all of his pent up feelings. Tony’s hoping after today, Steve would feel more comfortable.
Peter ignores the voice. He made a mistake, but that didn’t mean his life was over. He had plenty of options. He could fix this.
Tony lets out a sigh and rises to his feet. His mind is swarming with thoughts. He can’t stop thinking about Steve’s story and the pain he went through. But the baby currently in Steve’s belly is what Tony can’t fully fathom.
“You might have a little trouble. Look who their mother is,” Steve teases. Tony glares in his direction.
“Hi. Is it too late?”
“I know. But I’d rather you take the reins. I already know you’re going to make this place bigger and better.”
“You know people are going to question the cancellation of your big birthday bash.”
“Hey, it’s just one more thing you have to do before this kid gets here. If you want I can kick everyone out. More cake for you.”
“Hey!” Tony reaches out and wraps red fingers around Peter’s wrist. Peter struggles and screams to be let go, but Tony holds his ground. “Stop! Peter, listen to me!”
James nodded slowly. “It has crossed my mind. I keep thinking about how we tortured and killed a man to save ours from being tortured and killed. I don’t regret it, I only wonder if they’re asking themselves if we’ve ever done what Bakuto did. Taken innocents in exchange for what we want.”
Steve was making his way over already to inspect the back of Tony’s head and be sure he was alright. Once he was sure the least of his worries would be a headache, he tilted Tony’s head up and kissed him.
“I mean, if you want, wiseass.” Steve poured himself a new drink, sighing. “He’s a big boy, I’m sure he can handle it. And would appreciate it.”
Sitting in the living room looking over their travel details, Benni came in to talk to him about the trip, asking all kinds of questions about how far away it was and if it would be the same time there and here. Steve patiently answered every question, even when he repeated a few, and then he wrote down the phone number for their cottage and gave it to Benni for safe-keeping. Sarah, of course, already had this number but he hoped that Benni having his own copy would calm his nerves a bit. He assured him that he could call at any time when he missed his brother.
“Oh.” He felt a sudden rush of embarrassment but shook it off. Why should he have known that? “Alright then how about... Wait here.”
Sarah was paying for the groceries while the others helped pack them when Tony realized they forgot something.
Steve did not plan on missing his one chance to take advantage of some physical contact. When Tony got to the stairs with him, he linked his arm through his good one and held him securely to his side using the stairs as an excuse. Tony still flinched but he didn’t protest, though Steve doubted he would have even if he’d wanted to and for that reason it was the last time he touched Tony that evening.
Just for funzies and because this is how sleepy, pale Steve looks:
Sarah was now sitting in his chair and smiling up to Tony. Not having expected her there, he stopped for a moment.
“Hey, honeybear, I’m alive. I climbed the wrong fire escape.”
“Hello,” he greeted them with a content smile. The cold air they let in made Tony flinch and move away to where he wouldn’t feel it. He waited for them to come inside and for the door to be closed before he went to hug Clint. “You look so much better than yesterday,” he told him quietly, rubbing his shoulders. “I’m so glad you decided to st—that dog is much bigger than I expected it to be.” Tony moved to stand behind Clint, not trusting the unknown animal.
“All for your use, though I’d ask you to be careful,” James said, turning to Natalia. “And I have one more gift for you.” He reached in and pulled out one of the knives in a black and red leather sheath. The handle looked like a thick, plaited cord and was comfortable to hold. “This is for you.”
“Did they now?” Tony smiled and listened to more excited rambling from Benni until he was truly exhausted from the whole day. Benni was also starting to get sleepy.
,” Tony whispered softly in Italian. “
Tony gets a job and a raise in the same day. Steve gets a letter. An accountant has a very bad day.
Bucky rephrased. “I’m sorry you had to see what you saw but you know, Stark has a home too.”
“Hey,” he said, his voice coming out more gruff than usual, deeper. “You alright?” He asked in his usual Steve fashion as though he wasn’t the one who was clinging to life only an hour ago.
They hadn’t even come to check on him or bring food which meant—
“Don’t get upset please. You have school and you’re doing so well. Plus, Nat and Maria will visit plenty. You’ll have
to bother them. Maybe even on a subconscious level.”
Steve knocked his knuckles lightly on the door frame as he walked in to give Tony a quick heads up. James kept walking down the hall to check on another VIP down the way, his men following him. Dugan came in beside Steve.
He didn’t smile, didn’t chuckle, he deadpanned. “Then why don’t you know why he was shot?”
Steve had a stalker. Someone he had slept with months ago. It was a couple of weeks after the act in that he began popping up, standing on street corners staring at the building, appearing where he knew Steve frequented, spending his nights at James’ brothel hoping to be chosen by Steve again but Steve had rules: never the same person twice, man or woman. He didn’t want anyone getting attached and he saw now that that was inevitable.
“Steve?” She repeated.
“You okay?” he heard Clint say, not having realized he was awake. Clint’s hearing aids were in, he very rarely took them out these days, so James responded out loud.
On their way up the stairs, Tony took a detour and peeked in the library, checking if anyone was even home.
James stood up straight. “I’m going out of my mind here, Steve, but more than ever I want to just ball up all of that, push it aside, and focus on getting him back. When he’s in my arms, in our bed, then I can let all of this come out.” He paused, collected himself and said, “No matter what happens I need you to promise me something.”
Clint smiled. “The head of the Russian mob makes me pancakes with blueberry smiles in them,” Clint said, chuckling. “I wonder if they even know just how much we love them. You ever just hang out in Steve’s office and watch him? I think James has finally gotten used to my stalker tendencies.”
He moved back to Tony, his hands on either thigh again, and he went down, taking all of him.
“Like you?” He asked, moving a hand to Steve’s face. How could he ever be anything like Steve? But Tony knew that Steve was also only interested in men. And from what Tony could tell and from the way his body
Steve was in slightly better spirits today, getting most of his aggression and pent up emotions out during the workout not to mention the post-exercise endorphins running through his body and he gave the exhausted-looking brunet a cautious but genuine smile. They hadn’t spoken much since the night they’d spent together on the couch. Actually, they’d barely spoken at all since then. Only tiny bits of chit chat here and there about Benni.
“Okay, okay,” Loki said quickly as Dmitri and Dugan took a seat on either side of him, turning to him. “A few months ago, I was approached by a man.” As Loki continued to explain, James’ expression darkened and Loki knew that no matter what he said, that busted nose was not the last bit of pain he would see.
“Oh? Mr Rogers, don’t like what
“The reports will go to Dugan, Dugan will deliver them to you with none the wiser than you’re in control of them,” he explained, having used the time while O’Shea was panicking to think this up. “I was doing the books when I was your age. Younger even. Granted I was doing a lot of the jobs around here but still. And I wasn’t half as good as you seem to be.”
when you exist and occupy space. Guy’s completely gone for you, you know? You were the only topic that soothed him during…” He let his sentence trail off, knowing Steve could finish it himself. “So if jealousy’s your thing, it’s a waste of your energy.”
Steve said, turning to Monet now. “I’ll take it. No engraving.”
Two weeks later Tony was due for his last check-up at the hospital, the thick bandages on his left arm were finally gone and the doctor moved his arm this way and that, applying pressure and tapping on different places before he was finally cleared. The bruises had all faded, the stitched up wounds were red and throbbed, so for that Tony was given an ointment and that was it. Tony could hardly believe it but he left without new bandages or band aids, no new wounds, nothing. No pain.
“Nothing,” he said, forcing a smile. “You being here is enough.” Tony had all but recreated Steve’s office right there in the hospital room. He’d brought Steve books and he went over the accounts with him more than once, purely—Steve knew—to make Steve feel like he was contributing something. Dugan reported back every single detail to Steve and asked for his approval and advice on things Steve knew full well he didn’t need them on. The coddling was somehow worse than the inactivity but Steve felt like a flaming pile of shit for even thinking that, let alone telling them to stop because it was what he wanted, right?
Steve moved his lips so it pushed Tony’s open and his tongue slipped in.
“Still feel confident about staying over?”
“Oh, um,” Steve began and Tony just waited patiently to see what he would say. Steve was a terrible liar. He’d never told Tony a lie for any malicious reason but watching him try to keep something a surprise was needlessly entertaining. “Keep it a secret?”
Dmitri explained with a slight smile. James tilted his head to the side in confusion, raising his eyebrows as he waited for Dmitri to explain.
Four weeks. A month. That’s how much longer he had to go but it was finally over and Steve felt like a brand new man. He stretched, gently though because the skin was still a little tender, and headed for the door on his way out. He was healed enough that he’d been cleared for light activity and best of all, he could go home.
“They’re all gonna be me. So you better not hope for anyone else, mister.” He smiled and leaned in to kiss his lips softly.
“What happened last year?”
They drove down the block until they reached a bar. Clint had said it was only a few blocks down so there was a good chance this was it. Jones got out this time and went in, coming back to the car with the same expression of dread that Dugan had.
“Just… is Jim…?” Dugan nodded. “Alright,” he said quietly and gave Tony a nod before turning over to face away from them, tears silently falling. Dugan watched him a moment longer before returning his attention to Tony.
“Yeah, sounds about right,” Clint said, his smile dropping slowly and he found himself at a loss for words. He went with his gut instinct—make it a joke but also make it accurate. “Well, that’s… traumatic.” He knew a little about James’ involvement with Tony’s father but only from the perspective of James explaining his situation with Steve.
“I am,” Tony confirmed, grateful for Steve making sure that he was.
“Not to worry. I’ll be back here with my family soon. I just need to… process. Distance myself some.” Steve nodded. He knew it was selfish of him to ask James to stick around or return soon. He needed time to get over Steve just like Steve had taken time to get over James. It was part of why he had enlisted. Get as far away from him as he could so it was only fair he allow James his time.
“What’re you smiling about?” Pepper asked with a smirk.
She nudged his side with her elbow playfully but Clint heard the sad note to her voice and he wrapped his arm around her and pulled her in even closer. They stayed like that for a minute, maybe longer. Their pizzas and drinks were forgotten and Natalia rested her head on Clint’s shoulder, closing her eyes.
“Thank you,
Again she nodded, processing, looking for holes in his words. Anything to alert her that he might just be saying this. She trusted Tony, but her fear for her boys outweighed that trust right now. “Tony, don’t take this any way other than a mother trying to protect her child, but are you sure?” She had to know.
While Steve asked Benni to tell his big brother about all the things Natalia had taught him, Tony rested against him once again. He didn’t feel particularly hungry, but exhausted. Before he could do anything about it, he drifted off.
“He’s haunting me, Steve,” Tony said, his voice barely more than a whisper. Maybe Steve was right in asking him that. Maybe he wasn’t ready. “Tell me there’s no way for him to escape?”
“I’m very grateful for what Sarah and Steve did and continue doing for my brother and me. Some days it’s very surreal, I have to admit, but I wouldn’t change a thing.” He forced himself not to look at Steve like he wanted to. No, he wouldn’t change a thing.
“I wasn’t. I was in a meeting with Loki. That does not count as ‘busy’. And while I’m not happy you’re having a bad day, I am glad to see you,” James told him and pressed a kiss to his cheek, squeezing him tightly as he did. “If you still think anything comes before you in my life, then I hate to add onto your bad day but you’re
“Ready?”
“No, please stay,” he said quietly.
“Alright,” James said, not confident in Tony’s ability but trusting his determination at least. “Yes.”
Tony smiled, falling back onto his bed, the phone pressed to his ear and yeah, now he
? That’s a first. I’m so used to you and James going wherever the wind takes ya. Guess you lucked out, ay?” He nodded.
Tony did as he was told, he found that helped when people were angry. And if there was one person he shouldn’t anger it was the man sitting in front of him.
He made his way downstairs to find Tony trying to light the fire.
Steve agreed but at the same time he knew James was coming from a unique perspective. But Steve just sighed and said, “You’re right but still, you’re not an employee, Tony, you’re the man I love. I want us to have all that time too but I also want to make sure that in case we don’t—just in case—that you’re not left wondering who I even am.”
Tony furrowed his brows and looked out of the window next to him, thinking about his words. “There is nothing I can offer or give.”
“Tony tells me the same.”
“We were looking at our map just now. The lad had some ideas,” Dugan said from where he was standing.
different from ours,” Clint said, grateful because that would make getting lost a lot harder. “Yeah… I was worried about… spacing. I’m—I can be, uh, loud.” He felt his cheeks warm and he glanced up toward the stairs, wondering what James and Steve were taking so long for. “Can I have some water?”
It took Steve a moment to hear Tony’s question and then another moment to respond. He was back. He hadn’t set foot on Irish soil in years. He inhaled deeply despite already being in the car, savoring the moment of being back.
“Nothing.”
“How those two get anything done is beyond me.
“I love Gaelic,” Tony said with a smile and shifted a little, wincing when the small movement reminded him of how sore he was.
As if they had expected Tony to head out, a car was ready and inside it was nice and warm. The drive to the deli didn’t take long though the snow did slow them down. Tony was dreading going back there. What was he thinking?
He turned his head to look at Tony. “Actually a little bite would be great and some water.”
Fifty left was first, but Tony only needed forty-three. He crouched down to look around the corner. It was dark but he was hoping that his eyes had adjusted enough for him to notice shadows in the dark.
Steve shifted, his eyes barely opening to look around the room. He couldn’t get them to focus at first and then when they finally did, he remembered what had happened.
asked what was wrong until he remembered.
he said under his breath in Russian, surprised to hear a laugh on the other end of the line.
” When he caught sight of Steve’s expression, he shut up and changed his tone. “
James looked at Dmitri. “Dima?”
She taught Tony how to properly pronounce it until he got it right.
In all truthfulness, Steve had worried about the boxing thing but he’d checked on Tony just to see him. Just to know with certainty that he was still here. “I know you’re not helpless but my reputation aside, James was right when he said I care about you. About you all,” he added hastily. Steve swallowed hard. Why did those words scare him so much, all out in the open for Tony to hear like that? James had said them; what difference did it make now that he repeated them?
Clint snorted. “No, ya kook.” James laughed. “We’ll freeze our asses off.”
All in all it was a lot like the situation he had been in just one year ago. This time he didn’t have his brother to worry about and he wasn’t going through it alone. That was something.
Steve’s hands were both above the table now, only a little of his leg touching Tony’s. It seemed both of them were screwing up right now.
Steve got in the car with Dugan, whistling a tune—the song they’d first danced to from last night—and Dugan adjusted the mirror to look at him.
Steve and Tony have a good talk. Then they dance. Then they... talk some more.
“Mm,” Steve hummed, licking his lips as he pulled away. “Hi, love. Missed ya.”
Steve’s smile now was wide and confident and he came over and pulled out Tony’s chair, gesturing for him to sit. “I’m glad to hear it.” He leaned down, waiting for Tony to meet him the remaining ten percent of the way and when he did, they stayed like that a moment, kissing slowly until Steve pulled away. “Then allow me to serve you.”
Tony barely made it to the nearest couch, his legs unable to carry him for much longer. A mix of many— too many—emotions washed over him. There was guilt and a lot of it, fear, even more than guilt, confusion, love, desperation, insecurity and anxiety. Somewhere between the door and the couch Tony had managed to get rid of his clothes and was lying on his couch in his underwear, curling up in the tightest and smallest ball that he could turn himself into. It was too bright to find comfort but the warmth in his room helped.
Tony ran a hand over his face and got up.
Tony moved to hold Steve’s hand, not liking how harsh he had been towards him, and then he listened to it all. Once Steve was finished Tony sat on his bed to be closer to him and he kissed his forehead. No, this wouldn’t blow over.
Since a few days ago at the hospital Tony hadn’t bothered to look at his reflection in a mirror. Days ago he had been hideous, his face covered with wounds and bruises in all shapes and colors. The stitches on two gashes on his head had been removed but even around them had been dark bruises. Tony didn’t fit in with this beautiful environment, these beautiful people. He didn’t deserve any of this.
“She insisted on coming to see you,” Nat told him with a soft smile, stroking her daughters’ hair. She checked her watch. “Gotta go, we’re meeting Oko for lunch. Don’t work too hard. It is your day off, you know, Cap.”
He wondered what time it was. He turned his head slightly to see the clock that told him it was 9am. He couldn’t even remember what day of the week it was at the moment. Thursday? That sounded about right. Whatever the case, he wasn’t moving from his spot anytime soon. If he was needed, Dugan would come find him.
She didn’t shush him or otherwise try to quiet him. He needed to get it out and not feel like doing so was anything requiring hushing. She rocked him gently, reassuring him that she had him, he was safe.
to do.
Steve’s eyes had fallen to Tony’s lips while he spoke and then flashed back up as he heard his words. “Yes,” he said, carefully holding back the way he
“Do you like it?”
Steve watched Tony take charge of the situation and of Falsworth with all the smugness of a proud coach watching his players win a big, important game. There was a smile on his face, a look, that he knew he’d only really felt there when he was looking at Tony but the boy just made you want to smile at him and let him do his thing. Falsworth did not enjoy being bossed around by someone almost half his age but one irritated look from Steve and he dealt with it.
Steve shook his head. “A muffin’ll do me just fine, thanks.”
“And if he had? What would you have done? Stopped?” Howard mumbled something and James shoved him harder, pressing the tip of the knife into his skin, drawing blood. Howard screamed.
“It’s a lot? I know. Going there tonight, so soon, it was just an idea. We don’t have to go right away.”
“You know I can hold my own,” Natalia said, her tone furious but controlled.
,” he greeted him, kissing him briefly on the lips and then the forehead. He wrapped his arms around him from behind, burying his face in Clint’s shoulder and inhaling slowly.
“Wait, are you giving
“Hello, little one.” Tony smiled and hugged his brother. Slowly he finally let himself feel at home and safe. He’d still see Howard, still feel like he was killing him over and over again. The most important thing was that they got out of there and were given a completely different life—Tony more than Benni. Tony checked his watch. There was quite some time before dinner.
“And keeping this from me helps me how? I’m not a child, Steve. But I can only handle what you tell me. And this? This you should have told me.”
“We’ll be home soon. I’ve got a heat pack in my room,” Steve told him, worried both as his friend and captain. “You and Clint took a hard fall. Take next shift off. I’ll text him too. There’s always floaters willing to work.”
Tony looked up at Steve, who was sitting at this desk.
“Yeah, everyone’s fine. Dugan is up and ate. Jones is…” He thought about it. “Sad. But his wounds aren’t major either.” He looked in his eyes.
He chose a book of crime short stories and settled on one of the couches to read the first one. It wasn’t a very interesting or long one but it took Tony a long time to relax and focus on the words he was reading. Why did he feel like Steve was watching him? He did allow Tony to come here and read. Only his bedroom was off limits. Right?
“Keep a close one on the
“Yeah, here you go,” Steve said, pouring him a glass and handing it to him after helping him sit up a little more. Steve looked toward the door while Tony drank. “Not sure. Haven’t spoken to anyone yet this morning. I’ll ask Dugan to check in.”
James blew air out of his mouth as he thought. “I’ve just never liked it. The idea of being thousands of miles in the air in a piece of metal with nothing between me and the ground? No, thank you.”
“Sure,” he said, grateful that Tony wanted to make sure he really had the plan clearly in mind.
Clint looked up, a weak but hopeful glint in his eyes. “Really? To take it off?”
James answered back in the same language.
“I’ve lived with them for years and I still forget the doormat thing,” Steve said, a grin on his face that made Tony laugh.
Clint stopped talking and Tony started. Sarah hadn’t seen him carry on conversation since he’d come home. She sneaked away as quietly as possible and made her way downstairs to the basement, stopping at the door, knocking, and when she heard her son tell her to come in, she opened it and closed it again behind her.
“I love you too,” he said and left.
amazing,” he agreed. “So, I’m taking off work today, what about you, love?”
James looked over at the clock. He still had some time before his next appointment but Clint was at the bar and he hadn’t heard from him yet today. He figured things must be going well for once, so he wouldn’t bother him. He did worry at times about his tendency to hover.
“Come on, let’s move to the couch,” he said softly, pulling away but resting his hands on his shoulders.
It had taken some time but Steve had finally pinpointed the few who were cheating him of his money. Two of his own men who did not yet know they’d been found out and had a rude awakening coming their way, and then this man in front of him. The owner of a small clothing store, Mr Callahan. He’d been paying for sure but those two men of Steve’s who came to collect in his area were relatives of his and they were saving the money. He’d convinced them to swindle everyone on their route, pocket some of the cash after collection and well, Steve was not happy to say the least.
Steve sipped his wine. They had long cleared their plates and were on their second glasses of wine now. Steve was only on his third story—Tony had
.” As Clint had recently found out there was the country home and then a beautiful building that his family owned in Paris city center. He managed to get that tidbit of information out of James the other night using some
“Take me somewhere
It was Friday morning and after a minor call a few streets over, Steve had asked Natasha to fuel up at the gas station near Tony’s shop again. They were genuinely on empty so he knew he had a few minutes at least. He’d hopped out and rushed inside, finding Tony downstairs talking to a very nice redheaded woman who introduced herself as Pepper.
“Too early to tell.”
Jones pulled them into the alleyway behind the bar and James and Steve got out once they were sure it was clear. James walked over to the door, having called ahead from his car phone, and knocked. The knock was Morse code and spelled out the word ‘Barton.’
“Yeah. So I asked him out again but, uh… I don’t actually know where he’d like to go. Or what he’d want to do. I was hoping for some advice.”
He looked at the words there, his own. The warning he’d sent Howard that had more than likely only caused Tony more grief and yet he’d kept it along with the paper Steve had written his number down on. Steve felt the paper between his fingers; how it was no longer crisp and strong but soft, worn, the sign of something often picked up. He wanted to think about what that meant but figured it was nothing more than gratitude perhaps.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, I mean there’s also food. And music. Sometimes people just come in to talk and don’t even order anything. You can sit at the bar and chat with me or one of my other bartenders or have your own little group at a booth or table. Owning a bar is kind of like having a party at your house every night. It sounds exhausting, and sometimes it can be, but it’s mostly fun. For me at least.”
Steve was grinning like an idiot into the darkness. Tony thought he deserved the pet name
The man watched them, his eyes bloodshot from the lack of sleep and his skin pale. A shiver ran up his spine as the wind blew, that broken window in the back serving a purpose for Steve and James as it gave their hostage a little more incentive to answer.
Steve woke slowly, his neck aching, and looked over at Tony. “Same idea, I suppose,” he explained. “But I didn’t want to wake you when I got in here, so I decided to sleep.” He patted the cushion beside him for Tony to come back and sit.
James didn’t like talking about Clint without his knowledge but he would do almost anything if it meant he was better equipped to take care of him, so he’d asked Natalia about it. She confirmed James’ suspicions that Clint didn’t do well with communication relating to emotions or mental well-being and then she’d promised to talk to Clint when the opportunity arose and try to get a read on him.
Tony leaned down to kiss Steve’s hand and got up to get him food. He wouldn’t ask someone else to get it but he would take care of it himself, even when one of James’ men asked him if he needed something.
“Well, I hope you don’t mind full-time visitors because for the next two days, I won’t leave you.”
It was supposed to be a light joke, nothing more. Never had he expected anything from Steve, especially not a job. Especially not one this important and essential to his business. There was nowhere he could go. Nowhere he wanted to go. If he could help Steve, he would do that. “I think I’m getting the hang of it,” Tony said and nodded. “I’ll be here sorting the papers.” He started collecting the papers and putting them into the correct order as Steve had asked him to.
“I don’t want you to think this in any way reflects on you, Dugan, there’s just been so much short-changing as of late that I think a reminder of who exactly they’re robbin’ might do these wiseguys some good.” Dugan nodded; he couldn’t argue with that. They had been gypped a lot lately and that either meant that lackies were stealing or protectees weren’t paying up.
The next day carried on in its usual fashion. Clint and Tony woke up and sat in the darkness of a winter morning, awaiting their first meal. It was delivered with all the normal levels of grace and kindness, the trays thrown onto the floor and the food clinging for dear life to the thin metal instead of rolling onto the floor.
He sipped it. It was delicious. He had never had champagne before and judging by the way James was watching him, he had figured this out.
When Bakuto sent the latest photos of Clint and Tony, he had done so via messenger. He always had, they assumed, but this one wasn’t so successful at making a stealthy delivery. Dugan had spotted him and Dmitri had taken him down with a single knife to the leg. Now the poor unfortunate soul was theirs to play with until he gave them what they wanted.
As soon as he felt Steve wince he pulled away. “Easy there, Cap. There’s going to be enough time for us to kiss,” he promised, gently pushing him back into the less painful position. “I love you, Steve.”
“Cap, you sure? I mean you ain’t never really… made an appearance at these things. It’s beneath ya,” Dugan told him as Steve buttoned his vest. He grabbed a hat off his rack and put it on, tilting it over his eye and he spun around, arms spread, a wicked grin on his face.
“I hope you’re inviting everyone in the street because that should feed them all,” Tony greeted Sarah.
Peter stopped talking about the incident. For months it had been a topic in every one of their conversations. Peter was always trying to find a way to talk about the baby brother he never got to have. It was difficult at first to address any questions he had, especially for Steve, but they managed to find the strength to talk. Communication was key.
They never make it down to the lab. As soon as her dad gets his first serving of coffee, the rest of the house comes alive. Harley is up and irritable, demanding only Tony’s attention and no one else’s. Morgan is left to watch as her parent’s struggle to calm down her upset brother. It’s not until Peter steps in to take Harley for a moment does Morgan try to regain the spotlight.
