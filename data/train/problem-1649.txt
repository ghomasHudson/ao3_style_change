A noise of movement from behind made Mrs Hudson whirl around, but it was only John ambling into the kitchen, his tail up and waving. He walked to the table and climbed on top of it, where he sat right beside Sherlock and joined him in staring intently at the ceiling.
to be touched? It had been ages—and quite literally years since anyone had showed more than a perfunctory interest in his nipples. Sherlock’s interest in them now made him feel… naughty, reckless.
Gaping and satisfied, with come leaking out of his sore arsehole and down his thighs, John let Sherlock help him down from his hands and knees and then onto his back. Practically glowing with self-satisfaction, Sherlock kissed John’s neck, then his ear, then—when John lifted his head pointedly—his lips. John opened his mouth, licked Sherlock’s pouty bottom lip, and tasted chocolate.
Sherlock drew back, despite John’s grip on his hair which grew even more insistent and excruciating before finally letting go. With the back of one hand, he wiped the saliva from his chin, cheeks, and the tip of his nose.
, Sherlock reminded herself.
When she pulled back, John let out a quiet “uhn” of protest and tried to follow, but Sherlock shook her head. “Shh. Not now, John. Show me how you touch yourself. I want to watch. No more men.”
“Mary, Mary,” said Sherlock. “Quite…contrary, isn’t that how it goes?”
The expression of distaste, which had faded as Sherlock spoke about his parents, returned and deepened. “One older brother, Mycroft. A pompous, interfering ass, but occasionally useful to have around. Like Mrs Hudson, he’s very, mm…
, he told himself. Not marrying John would hardly be the end of the world. A month ago, he hadn’t even wanted to. The thought never would have crossed his mind if John hadn’t put it there.
Mycroft’s eyebrows flew halfway up his forehead, and then John and Sherlock were catching each other’s eyes and giggling like children. Sherlock’s violin plucking faltered and then stopped completely.
He was toeing a dangerous line, he knew. The thin, tight line of John’s lips confirmed it. A few more jabs, a few more pointed strikes—
“Not—no,” John said roughly, looking pained. He gripped his prick in one hand and used the other hand to haul himself to the edge of his seat, his body angled towards Sherlock. “Just—give me a minute.”
If you want, sure.
Several times, the crown of his cock catches on the rim of Sherlock’s hole, nearly slipping free again before John manages to shove it back in, filling Sherlock with the never-ending burn of that initial penetration, the feeling of
The man smiled tightly and reached into the still-open car door, where John saw there was a woman fiddling with a mobile phone. She didn’t look up from the screen as she handed a Primark bag to the man, who in turn offered it to John. Sherlock made a disgusted noise but nevertheless gestured for John to take it.
“Shit, hang on.”
With a shaky sigh, he made himself let go. His cock neglected and aching, John finished his shower and allowed his breathing to even out, his heartbeat to slow back to its normal resting pace. He dried himself, put on his bathrobe, and opened the door.
They’re not.
Really, it was just a shit idea all around. Off the top of his head, John could imagine over a dozen ways this night could end in disaster.
Okay well, just ignore the second one then. The point is, I’m glad you texted and that you’re okay.
The sight undid him. With John’s knees shuffled slightly apart, his cleft was exposed. The sensitive strip of skin, the spattering of curly hair (darker than the hair on his head, possibly due to the effects of sweat and lubricant), his anus (Sherlock’s breath caught and he swayed, lightheaded) wrinkled and shining with slick, John’s index finger just barely, barely slipping inside.
, Sherlock told himself sternly.
All right. I’ll see you in a bit. :)
Then he shut up, returned his attention to the movie. Sherlock seemed to do the same, but John knew better. He knew
, the photo said.
“John,” he said solemnly. His voice was even deeper in person, which was absurd.
Nothing.
“You’re in therapy because of me,” John says. “
Such a perfect, gorgeous cock—Sherlock had an entire folder of photos of it on his phone.
John paused after the head was sheathed, because Sherlock’s thighs were trembling and he was gulping in air like he was in danger of drowning. Plus, John needed the moment as well; Sherlock was so warm inside, and the clench of his muscles so unforgiving, that this could all be over very quickly if he wasn’t careful.
“Tomorrow!” said Mrs Hudson, loudly enough that she could be heard quite clearly all the way up in John and Sherlock’s flat.
“Called it off.” John shrugged, kicking off her shoes. “Said he wasn’t interested in seeing me anymore. It’s weird, apparently, to have a girlfriend called John. He wanted to know why I couldn’t just go by Johanna.”
“What is your medical opinion on spontaneous human combustion?”
This time Sherlock didn’t avoid touching him, and in fact laid the full length of his hand across the back of John’s neck, covering not only the scratches but unmarked skin and hair besides. John never really forgot how large Sherlock’s hands were, how long his fingers, but rarely had he been confronted with the knowledge quite like this.
Sherlock sighed. “Mother. Our mother. This is my brother, Mycroft.”
“Sorry,” he said, still giggling helplessly. “Sorry. I’m apparently horrifying everyone around me. People are staring.”
And now evidently 071411120418, whatever sort of username that was meant to be, had a proposal for him. If 071411120418 even was a real user in the first place. Possibly it was only the fetish site version of spam.
The gunshot was deafening in the silent room. Across the courtyard, the unknown man fell. John dropped the gun to his side, heart in his throat, and watched as Sherlock rushed to the window, looked out, and met John’s eye.
“You’re not very wet,” she said.
“God, Sherlock,” John said, and finally,
“Tonnes?” Sherlock scoffed. “Oh please.”
Sherlock went utterly, completely still as she came. Her lips clamped tightly shut, which did little to hold in the string of soft, throaty whines John suspected she’d be hearing in her wet dreams for years.
To his right, the monitor began to wail.
“Molly.” He nods in greeting, striving for politeness even though he’d prefer to rudely retrieve his toes and leave, return to John and his newfound mission. But politeness is necessary when someone is doing you a favour—one of the many things John has taught him. “You look….”
Part of John wanted to take off his clothes again, shove Sherlock back into his armchair, and climb on top of him. The other part of him wanted to make a joke about the taxi drivers in London these days.
“I didn’t.” Of course Sherlock hadn’t. Ridiculous. He swallowed and swirled the food on his plate, concealing anything that might’ve suggested otherwise.
Laying one hand on the back of Sherlock’s neck for support, he nudged the toy’s tip between Sherlock’s lips and inched it into his mouth. Sherlock’s eyes squeezed shut, and John could see the muscles in his throat contract as the tentacle scraped the back of it.
were at the mercy of such a creature….”
“You left first, you know.”
“You want to keep him, don’t you, Mary?” said Sherlock. “You want to keep them both.”
That reminded John.
, which was unexpected to say the least. John had done nothing but type and send a text.
Relationship in trouble, obviously. The stress of travel, multiple weeks in the near-constant presence of one another, it revealed issues of which neither was previously aware. The engagement will almost certainly be called off within the month, if not this week. By him, of course.
Warning: There's a very brief mention of past child abuse and homophobia in this chapter.
But John, occasionally brilliant John, understood. His expression went so soft, so plainly adoring that Sherlock’s heart swelled in his abused throat. “All right,” John said.
But he hadn’t—and Sherlock suspected that if he didn’t figure out why, it would haunt him for the rest of his life.
his gaze fixes almost immediately on Sherlock’s throat.
Sherlock lifted his head, standing straight again but remaining close. He pressed their foreheads together, staring into John’s gorgeous blue eyes. “Ask.”
“I don’t mind. They’ll see worse by the time I’ve finished with you tonight.” Another kiss, to John’s bicep this time, which flexed at the light tickling touch. “You’re welcome to stay the night and ruin them completely, but I know that you won’t. You worry I’ll be put off by your nightmares.”
Sherlock finds his words again. “Hardly unthinkable. All things considering, it’s really quite normal. In my experience, infidelity, the temptation of it if not the actuality, is present in most marriages.”
“Is there a case in that folder to do with all the photos you had me take?”
Heart pounding, Sherlock sat up and popped open the lid.
The muscle cramps, when Sherlock was finally untied, were apparently awful. Enough so that he lay perfectly still for several minutes, allowing John to massage the seizing muscles, and then consented to drinking multiple glasses of water and even eating a piece of toast without complaint.
“A webcam, yes. Much easier that way. I thought you might appreciate evidence of my arousal. So you can see for yourself how badly I want you.”
), but a pair of pressed, well-cut trousers and a tight-fitting shirt would accentuate his attractiveness, perhaps improve his chances.
John looked. ‘The chair’ evidently meant Sherlock’s chair and ‘my computer’ evidently meant John’s computer, as that was the only one in sight. At least it was a request rather than a command—that was some progress.
You’ll notice I’m sending this email from a different account, one which is associated with my real name instead of ‘ScienceOfDeduction’. Please feel free to use this one when contacting me.
And all the while, John murmurs things like “Fuck, your arse should be a national treasure” and “You gorgeous, magnificent creature” and “Christ, Sherlock, you have no idea how badly I want you.”
He probably needed a shower. Could definitely use the loo and clean his teeth. So he turned on the baby monitor balanced on the wall of Rosie’s cot, grabbed the parent unit off the bedside table, and carried it into the ensuite.
Still, Sherlock did her best to swallow her fear and lift her chin confidently. “Of course I’m not.”
Sherlock
, says its cover—balanced on one arm. John’s expression is open, his emotions plain in the configuration of facial wrinkles, the shape of his mouth, the set of his jaw, the degree and direction of his head tilt: interest, curiosity, concern, patience, uncertainty.
In the meantime, Sherlock researched the history of various marriage traditions and pondered his own name.
Sherlock wet his lips and looked so fucking greedy that John could
How did you know I’m a man approaching 40?
Sherlock’s reply came a minute later:
He answered:
But John wanted it. Was asking with that little half smile that was somehow just as cocky as it was supplicating. Sherlock adored her. A labyrinth of contradictions in a plain cable-knit jumper and a pair of jeans. Sherlock’s adoration was a wave swelling and crashing in her throat.
Life is still too short to not write shamelessly self-indulgent catlock. Happy National Cat Day and (early) Halloween! ♥
“Was that all right?” John asks, hands on the back of Sherlock’s thighs, rubbing his palms mindlessly against Sherlock’s trousers. Wanting to move upwards and grope at Sherlock’s bum, but holding back. Uncertain.
Stupid. Pathetic. Sentiment is every bit the weakness that Mycroft says it is, but it is also utterly irresistible. Worse than cocaine. Worse than Lestrade at his door, summoning him to a bloodbath.
I know I’ll be there in only a few hours, but do you want to play a bit of Diggy Hole or Outskirts?
“Two in the last week, he said. Something like fourteen in total.”
John’s words strike with the intensity of a needle plunged into Sherlock’s vein. Sherlock stops listening, loses awareness of his senses entirely. His mind begins to reel.
“You’re a sadist,” Sherlock explains. “You derive physical pleasure from inflicting mild, consensual pain on others.”
Sherlock shut the front door behind them and strode past John into the living room, flipping on the light and then looking about. Nothing had moved since they’d left, as far as John could see. Even Sherlock’s duffle was still where it had been, on the floor beside the sofa.
“You don’t think your life is interesting?”
A week after that, Sherlock shouted through the bathroom door while John showered, “Rope bondage?”
“Impatient,” John said, breathily.
Her tone was warm, fond. Sherlock could feel John’s grin against her bare breast, and she wanted to crush John to her, make a permanent imprint of the sensation in her skin.
But that was fine. There was still the tail.
“I’m so glad you two have worked everything out,” Mrs Hudson says. Once the tea tray’s been sorted, she seats herself in John’s chair, smoothing her skirt beneath her.
Oh. That’s a profoundly tantalising image: John reduced to violent, primal possessiveness over Sherlock. Blood and bits of flesh on his teeth and lips. Pinning Sherlock down and fucking him while some idiot somewhere screams in agony and bleeds to death for touching what is John’s.
Then John jerks upright, saying, “Sorry. Sorry. Dozed off.”
“There,” John said, his tone warm and approving as Sherlock whimpered and shivered and began to rut frantically between the plug and John’s hand. “How’s that?”
“Hold it tighter.” If Sherlock tries to lean forwards again, John’s grip loosens immediately to allow it. Sherlock doesn’t want it to. “I want….” He licks his lips, feeling uncharacteristically shy. He thinks he might actually feel the heat of a blush on his cheeks. “I don’t want to be able to move.”
But John said
Another tight smile, although this one seemed more genuine than the last. “Not at all. It
With a whine, rapturous and lost, Sherlock rutted against John until her eyes stung with sweat and she was breathing frenziedly through her nose and snorting slightly, bull-like and stupid but impossible to stop. Pleasure was a knife slicing through her, cutting away her inhibitions. She even felt a bit like she was bleeding: a sort of slippery feeling in her cunt that had only ever accompanied menstruation.
Sherlock nodded. “It—” He couldn’t even begin to explain the appeal. Of being left wanting, being consumed with thoughts of John, or of John’s thoughts never straying far from Sherlock. The words wouldn’t come.
The smartest thing to do, he realised, was to move on.
, Sherlock thought. But no. John would have to get up and retrieve the ring from the bedroom. John wouldn’t want to propose without it. He was traditional and a romantic, and it would defeat the purpose of getting the ring to begin with.
They would eventually, of course. That was something John was quite confident about.
It wasn’t, though. It might’ve seemed that way now, in John’s hormone-flooded imagination, but the reality was that it made sex with Sherlock difficult. It made her
“You must be Dr Watson,” he said, to John’s shock—he didn’t recall telling
John holds himself utterly, perfectly still, though he throbs and aches with need. He can feel his pulse in the veins of his cock, can hear it pounding in his ears. Time slows and the world goes soft and hazy for a long, long while, until finally Sherlock’s prick softens enough that he can withdraw.
John obeyed, although he felt perfectly ridiculous like that. With the Fleshlight in the middle of his pillow and John gripping the cylinder with one hand, putting his weight on it so the sleeve part of it was tilted up: ready for his prick. He needed his other hand to hold the phone against his ear, which left him nothing to use to keep himself upright and steady. He found himself pitching forwards, lying almost flat atop the pillow with his forehead mashed against the headboard.
doing it… it was hot. It was stupidly hot, actually.
“Listen to you,” he said gruffly, as though he’d been choked. “You love this. You love being my pet and getting fucked like a good boy. No, don’t do that.” Because Sherlock had started to move back and hump himself on John’s prick. “I told you to stay there, didn’t I? Be good.”
He lifted his chin, inviting Sherlock to bite along his throat while he plunged his hands down the back of Sherlock’s trousers, cupping that plump bottom and feeling the cheeks dimple as Sherlock thrust against him. Groaning, he let Sherlock’s hands roam his chest: splaying over his pectorals and plucking roughly at his nipples until the little buds were tight and aching.
is your matter of great importance?’ John thought, bemused, but said nothing. He allowed Sherlock to bang on about venomous snakes and ignorant pet owners and walked—refreshingly briskly, as his leg wasn’t bothering him much today—to the nearest station. There, he decided it was probably prudent to warn Sherlock, even if it meant interrupting again.
He lifted a fat, dead rat to his mouth and bit. If John could still identify the animal—brought upstairs by Mrs Hudson as a sort of snack, no doubt, similar to how she sometimes brought John a sandwich or a plate of biscuits in the afternoons—that meant he’d only just got started. In as little as ten minutes, the rat would be reduced to a gruesome lump of flesh and fur, the dozens of fang marks robbing it of any distinguishing features.
Not quite 20 hours since the scalpel debacle, countless cups of tea and plates of sandwiches and biscuits, and John hovering in Sherlock’s sight as ever-present and quiet as a ghost, and Sherlock feels… off. Dimmed, somehow. As though he’s standing constantly behind a wall of scratched, mud-speckled glass.
Then why the hell, John wondered, was he here?
“Ah. Of course.” Sherlock stopped spinning and faced John, giving him a lingering once-over that made him feel as though he should cover himself. “Hmm. You’re angry. You feel deceived. I’ve been here this whole time, and you didn’t know it, and I
It’s a clear dismissal, although Mrs Hudson glances at Sherlock, who nods at her, before actually dismissing herself. As she closes the door softly behind her and starts to descend the stairs, Sherlock stands, wrapping his dressing gown more tightly around himself.
It was meant to be a sort of joke, although he soon began to suspect that the tone hadn’t translated. Sherlock’s previous texts had been nearly instantaneous, arriving seconds after John had sent his. The next one wasn’t. It was a long, full minute—during which John arrived at the station, then simply stood awkwardly on the pavement outside, not wanting to miss Sherlock’s reply—before the BlackBerry chimed again.
You’re a lot of things, Sherlock, but emotionally fragile is not one of them.
It would’ve been nice, he reflected as he trudged up the final few steps, if Sherlock popped out to help, but John remembered the day he moved in all too clearly to actually expect any sort of assistance. Sherlock had been far more interested in deducing the contents of John’s bags and boxes than carrying them anywhere.
John had only managed a handful of thrusts before Sherlock’s hands, clinging to John’s thighs, slid upwards to grip John’s hips. To be helpful, probably, to stabilise John, or maybe just to feel John’s muscles working, although in that moment it seemed to John like a greedy little power grab.
“Sherlock!”
Acceptable, Sherlock decides, although he suspects he’ll still have to settle.
“I’m not really sure what just happened.”
“Here,” he’s saying. “It’s time to eat. Christ, if you’re not hungry, what do you fucking want?” And then: “God
But he does, and he folds his hands in front of his chest, waiting.
“Obviously.”
This was not, John knew, what his therapist had meant when she’d suggested that he try meeting people online.
“That’s wasteful,” said John, scandalised. “Which is even worse than extravagant. I’m not going to throw away a perfectly good sex toy.” No, he would look up how to clean a Fleshlight online. Easiest method, what materials to avoid, and all of that. “Also, you’re meant to be
Rubbish. Ella wouldn’t be pleased.
“Oh,” he said.
Scoffing, Sherlock turned her face pointedly away. After watching her a moment, noticing that the tops of her ears had gone pink, John shifted until she was the one with a leg crossed over Sherlock’s and Sherlock’s bum was flat on the chair. Sherlock accepted the change with nothing more than another scoff, more dramatic this time.
Because it is. Did you just seriously ask that? If you’re going to be a reckless idiot, then you really should take me with you next time.
, John thinks.
And even though John knew that he shouldn’t, just as he knew that if they’d been having this conversation in person John would have answered very differently indeed, he found himself incapable of saying anything but:
Despite the clean floors and the neatly made bed, the whole room reeked of sex. Sweat, lubricant, ejaculate. The bedsheets, no doubt, were in desperate need of a good wash. The scent, and the thought, made Sherlock grin. Perhaps John could be put off doing the laundry a few more days, until the smell had seeped beyond the bedroom and permeated the entire flat.
Fighting Sherlock is the last thing on John’s mind. He squirms because he loves it: being fucked by a werewolf in whatever room he happens to be in when Sherlock finds him, in the middle of the floor because Sherlock always wants him
“You’re very, very tempting right now, I admit it,” said John. “But it’s only five hours.”
He set the phone down on his thigh and rubbed his palm over his face. Not for the first time since he’d been invalided, nor even the first time today, John wished he were back in Afghanistan. There might’ve been war and death, the stuff of nightmares, but at least he’d always known where he stood in a situation and how he was meant to react.
John’s hand tightened into a proper fist. “Don’t you fucking even,” he said, his voice deathly low. “I’ve seen your bank statements, just this week in fact. We’re far from ‘financial turmoil.’ And you’ve been pestering me to quit for months. Hell,
John didn’t want to, in fact had every intention of staying right where he was, but then Sherlock added, “Turn over and you can drink from my throat.”
“—so you’d fall right into his trap.”
He banished the idea from his mind and stayed quiet, catching his breath, until Sherlock gave a sharp “Ah!” and then went quiet. For several long seconds, there was no sound from the phone but for the occasional burst of static as Sherlock panted against the receiver.
His history? Sherlock had deleted John’s browser history after he’d borrowed the computer. Of course he had. Hadn’t he?
Sherlock’s smirk had grown so wide it felt like it nearly split his head in two. He couldn’t resist a preen, going so far as to lean back against the table, his legs parted slightly. A delicious little tease.
“Perhaps they’d be open to commissions…”
‘How do you know I’ve got a therapist?’ John meant to ask, but he’d got only as far as the first syllable when Sherlock dove forwards, licking at John’s sore and messy hole, which wiped away all thoughts of his own mental deficiencies. “Jesus Christ, Sherlock, I just woke up, and that’s—that’s
And also so that she could monitor its healing. Late one afternoon—in her bed, undressed but for her knickers and a vest, and curled around John while John was still nude and trembling, letting out soft gasping cries while her bullet vibrator still buzzed against her clit—Sherlock scrutinised the bite mark, noting that the texture was smoother, the redness gone, the purplish-blue faded to tan.
John frowned. “What’s what like?”
They were headed towards the main street. To hail a taxi, John assumed, although Sherlock veered abruptly in the direction of an abandoned block of flats. He threw open the door and waltzed inside as though he owned the place, then turned around and held the door open for John to follow.
Considering you were only responding to my questions, you needn’t apologise.
John’s jaw drops, and he wants desperately to lower himself to his forearms and stick his bottom in the air, spread his legs wide for Sherlock’s tongue. But the breeding stand prevents it, so John can only remain where he is, slack-jawed with pleasure while Sherlock eats his arse.
He thought they were dating, anyway. They’d been on dates, and Sherlock certainly seemed keen.
<JohnHWatson> Both I suppose. It was all helpful. So thanks for that!
“I want you to have coffee with me.”
But John isn’t manipulative like Sherlock. He doesn’t do things just to gain a response. He is honest and good. He is genuine.
“Yeah?” says John.
Before John, no one had ever teased Sherlock. The person to come the closest had been Mycroft, but those conversations were little more than sparring matches. Barbed comments and chilling smiles. With John it was soft, warm. Sherlock sometimes imagined himself—although he would never admit it aloud—as a basset hound coming awake under John’s gentle hands, answering John’s teasing smile with something that he hoped was understood even if only on some subconscious level.
“Up, get up! I won’t have you turning into a useless stereotype who only wakes when the sun goes down. There are entirely too many of those as it is.
The taste bloomed in his mouth, first only the drop on his tongue—rich and delicious, almost decadent—and then he could feel it all the way in his throat, a trail of warmth—like alcohol, or what he remembered of alcohol, but less of a burn and more of a shock—that travelled lower and lower until his prick, already hard, thickened to the point of aching.
John laughed. It wasn’t a happy sound. “Of course she understood. She understood everything. She—”
Sherlock will never be able to know every thought that passes through John Watson’s head. There is an entire world, fields of unfiltered impressions and mounds of partially formed ideas, that will never give themselves away in John’s expression, and thus Sherlock will remain ignorant of them. Unfortunate, distasteful, but out of his control.
“Well, come on,” Mrs Hudson said. “I got it out for a reason, you know. Calming effect, lowered inhibitions. It’s the perfect opportunity to make friends and get to know each other.”
She concentrated on the protected bite mark instead. Scraped her cheek across the plaster again and again and then turned her nose into it, inhaling the very faint (possibly imagined) scent of antiseptic and antibiotic cream. She even gave in to the urge to lick it gently, barely brushing the tip of her tongue across its surface. It tasted of nothing but the woven fabric it was made of, no soaked-up sweat or lingering blood, not even a hint of the plaster’s adhesive, but the thought of the wound beneath it—maybe still swollen and red, throbbing with John’s pulse—made her feel like she could purr with satisfaction and contentedness.
But you never had sex with Victor?
Sherlock, a short distance away from where Mrs Hudson stood with the hat, flattened his ears and hissed. The thick black fur along his back stood up straight until he actually looked quite festive: an appropriately Halloween-ish black cat.
“You talked to Mycroft,” he said grimly.
. He could hardly keep still. He wanted to writhe and squirm, fuck himself on John’s fingers or rub his prick against something, nuzzle John’s hand or lick at the webbing between John’s fingers.
“Dull,” he said sulkily. “I don’t know why you insist on working there. Your time would be better spent—”
Just worry about catching your train. I’ll see you when you get here.
“Was that a moan? ... You little whore, are you actually touching yourself because I killed a bloke with a flamethrower?”
, Mrs Hudson thought, pursing her lips so she didn’t say it out loud.
“A lobotomy,” Sherlock said darkly, the first thing that popped into his head.
With another deep breath, Sherlock reached for his wine glass, although his hands were shaking too badly. Wine sloshed over the rim, spilling onto the leg of his trousers.
He covered Sherlock’s hands with his own, stopping them in their path, and pinned them to the mattress. The change in position shifted John’s weight from his arse to his knees, giving him more leverage, making it easier to rise up and fuck down on the length of Sherlock’s prick hard enough that the bed shook and creaked.
Firstly, Sherlock has not stored any sexual organs, much less the genitalia themselves, in the fridge since John has lived with him. Secondly, and most importantly, John has never accepted Sherlock bringing home body parts without a row of some kind: John banging on about sanitation and hygiene and
Sherlock appeared in the entrance, a steaming mug in each hand. She looked less confident than she had only minutes before; her shoulders and back were slightly slumped, and there wasn’t an air of self-satisfaction about her any longer.
“You’re enjoying this,” said John. “You had your little huff at first, but you actually like that you have to teach me all this.”
But he hadn’t imagined it would feel quite like this.
“You’re John?” the man said, and when John nodded, he bent down and picked up a shoe box, which he passed to John.
Shut your fucking mouth. I’ve never. I would never say that to her
John’s fantasy was certainly improved—as was his mood. Even the mention of the case John hadn’t been invited to didn’t put him off spending the rest of the morning dirtying the freshly cleaned Fleshlight all over again.
He laughed, a small barely audible huff. Of course John would overestimate his ring size. John who marvelled regularly at the size of Sherlock’s hands. Sometimes whilst he was knelt over a body, chuckling despite all of Scotland Yard goggling at the inappropriateness of it. Sometimes whilst he clung to Sherlock, moaning, his breath warm on Sherlock’s bare shoulder.
His prick doesn’t even twitch. Not in the mood.
Sherlock allows himself to be hefted up and shuffled a bit until it’s no longer his bottom in John’s lap but his head, and the rest of his body is as close to being curled around John as he can manage. The position stretches the skin on his arse cheeks, which burn and throb.
Nothing is okay.
in certain aspects.”
But even as he was admiring the boots, uneasiness niggled at him more persistently than before. This wasn’t something that could be brushed off as a business expense; Sherlock wouldn’t benefit from John’s new shoes at all. This was… John didn’t know what this was. And now that he was here, turning his feet this way and that, watching the light glint off the leather, he wondered if he shouldn’t have come to Speedy’s at all. If he should’ve refused to accept the shoes, despite what Sherlock had said about them languishing behind the counter.
“Would you mind checking my computer? It’s on the chair.”
‘Right,’ he thought, determined. ‘Bugger the money and the gifts and the—the everything. You fancy him. You want to be dating him. Time to stop wobbling and start doing something about it.’
. The dribbling became one spurt after another, and his bollocks were drawing up, and it felt… earth-shattering, devastating. The orgasm didn’t start from his cock, but from somewhere deeper, and it reached farther. He could feel it in his stomach, in his knees, in his bones and blood, and he was crying “ah, ah, ah” into the sheets, eyes squeezed shut and his whole body heaving. Vaguely aware that John was lifting him by his waist so he was sitting up with his back against John’s chest, John’s pelvis digging into his arse cheeks.
It was so ridiculous that John snorted. “I think I’d know if it hurt, thanks.”
She didn’t return to fondling her breasts as Sherlock had intended. Instead, she dipped her left hand between her thighs. There was none of the
And today, it evidently wanted to bite John hard enough to draw blood.
“You know you didn’t actually have to go with him. You were in a flat full of police officers. You don’t have to risk your life just to prove you’re clever, you git.”
“Oh, bugger Mycroft,” John snapped. “He’s a twat. He doesn’t matter. What I want to know is what
Let me know when you find the dog?
John’s leg didn’t hurt at all during the walk home, nor during the time he spent circling round and round the bedsit, altering his pace and the length of his stride, until he felt it was finally safe to conclude that the pain and the limp were gone.
And John was interested, if his sniffing was anything to go by. Sherlock, meanwhile, was peeking warily from the kitchen. Mrs Hudson could hear his tail thumping anxiously on the lino.
Hi, sorry, popped into a shop!
As though he’d heard Sherlock’s pleas, John’s hand left his bottom abruptly. But Sherlock’s cry, low and positively tortured, turned quickly to a yelp when the hand crashed down again, landing a light blow on Sherlock’s arse right over the plug. Just like before, it forced the toy deeper, and this time it also drove his cock sharply into John’s grip.
John was sure he was gaping like a fish. A drug cartel. The cheerful woman with the flour-covered apron. Christ. “Er. Yeah,” he said. “Yeah, I imagine so.”
More or less, yes, I went from school to detective work. I had an interest in solving crimes, and solving murder in particular, from a relatively young age. When I was ten, a boy died during a school trip to a London pool. He had some kind of fit in the water, but by the time anyone could get to him, he'd drowned. A tragic accident, according to the police, but I suspected otherwise. Of course, no one cared a whit about the opinion of a ten year old, no matter how clever he is, so nothing ever came of my attempts to alert the police to their mistake.
“Longer than a month.” John’s head came up again, and he sat back into the sofa, his hands going to his thighs and rubbing almost self-consciously. “Closer to two, probably. It took you a lot longer than I thought it would.”
; it rang or chimed. Harry’s old phone was the one that John had left in vibrate-only mode. He couldn’t even remember the last time anyone had rung or texted him on that. It had been weeks at least, maybe even a month or longer.
<JohnHWatson> No one else I know is so consistently infuriating.
for—Mycroft’s existence, there are at least a dozen days Sherlock curses his parents for having sex at any point before his own conception and thus giving him an overbearing, interfering arsehole of a sibling.
With a heavy sigh, John rubbed his palm over his face.
It took John a moment to realise Sherlock was addressing him. “Oh, um. Yeah, they’re… nice.”
“You could tell from a dead man’s fingertips that he used a computer regularly,” he said. “I think you’ll manage. Now, is that all?”
But this entire conversation is setting the wrong sort of tone, so he decides to let it go. “Fine. Noted. Come back to bed.” Then, because John still appears undecided, Sherlock ducks his head, shamming shy earnestness. He even bites his bottom lip and flutters his eyelashes, which makes John gulp. “Please?”
Not just his mouth, apparently, but his throat. Sherlock sucked John down nearly to the root, which pulled a startled shout from John and upset his balance. As he planted a hand on Sherlock’s headboard to keep himself stable, Sherlock took advantage of his distraction to slide two fingers into John’s messy hole.
“Of course I don’t! I think that because you got uncomfortable when we talked about him before.”
Sherlock’s voice was hoarse when he answered. “Doesn’t matter. We’ve the rest of the night for you to try again.”
John raised a hand with one finger pointed, effectively cutting her off, just as Sherlock mounted the stairs and clambered noisily up them.
Definitely the best.
, it said.
JohnHWatson: OH! No I don’t have either.
“Thank you, Daddy.” John bent over Sherlock’s back as far as he could without breaking his rhythm, wishing fervently that he could bend all the way—or perhaps yank Sherlock back towards him—so he could pant directly into Sherlock’s ear. “You take such good care of me, Daddy.”
“Wasn’t it?” John said, still smiling. “You didn’t cuff yourself to my bed so I could do what I want with you?”
Sherlock had seemed frozen, and then suddenly he wasn’t. He lurched backwards into John, utterly graceless. Panicked, John realised. Rosie, jostled by the collision, threw her head back and howled.
, he thinks desperately.
In short, Graham “Jake” Doss was exactly as SH had described.
The shoes were… well,
,” Sherlock spat, for perhaps the hundredth time. “I miscalculated. If I’d known it would be such a
It was more than enough incentive for John to get on with it, and this time the penetration went smoothly: no gasps of pain or discomfort as John slid inside. Sherlock took everything up to the fattest bit of John’s cock with a soft, needy moan.
John hissed. Sherlock was right; it was big, especially for an anal toy, and although the tip was rounded, there wasn’t a lot to ease him into the stretch before he reached the thickest part. The abundance of lube helped. Any more friction and it would’ve burned like hell, but instead it slid in with minimal resistance, more discomfort than outright pain.
John was gone hours, during which Sherlock solved Taggert’s murder—he thought, although he’d have to return to the crime scene to verify his theory—and drank two cups of tea. When John finally returned, he was straight-backed, his jaw clenched with determination, and carrying a plastic shopping bag, which he dropped into Sherlock’s lap.
Sherlock had said, and more because it had been
John refused to allow himself to smile, although his lips kept twitching upwards, trying to spite him.
“Well, there’s also the obvious, of course,” Sherlock said. He strode towards them, and although Mike stumbled hastily away, John stayed where he was. He got a strong, dizzying whiff of cologne and copper as Sherlock squeezed past to grab his coat. “I tend to respond… poorly, shall we say, to activities that significantly alter the human heartbeat. Exercise, sexual activity, nightmares....”
Did he? God, yes. It’s all he wanted, really. But…
Instantly, John’s arms were around him, drawing him into John’s chest. Sherlock felt John’s prick, blood hot and as hard as steel, against his hip, and whimpered. He needed it, god he needed it. He tried to spread his legs, tried to encourage John to shove it back inside him and fuck him until the pressure, the throbbing, was gone.
of Madame Tussauds so I could take a picture of the door I was escorted from.”
“—have failed the Foundation Programme’s clinical assessment,” Sherlock was saying, “and he feels excruciating shame because of it. And… ugh, dull. He didn’t kill these men at all. They were homeless—you can tell by their feet. He found them dead.”
John breathed deeply and began to type as quickly as his fingers would allow.
“—and I need to go home,” he finished instead.
to me again, isn’t it? Look, Sherlock, this—I know you’re selectively ignorant about certain aspects of human culture, but feeding me your blood doesn’t make you my father in any sense of the word. You’re my friend,” John said, emphatic. “That’s all.”
“Well… yeah. I suppose so. You’re certainly happier when John’s around, and that counts for something.”
Sherlock goes still, even as his cock jerks in complaint.
John’s stomach swooped. “Oh god yes.”
“Will neither of you ever simply grow up?” Mycroft said, exasperated.
Why didn’t you tell me Victor was your drug dealer?
It’s a reasonable request. He thinks it is, anyway, although his mind is uncharacteristically sluggish and refuses to open the mental file he’s got on acceptable behaviour in average social interactions. But it doesn’t sound unreasonable. After all, Sherlock wasn’t even given the opportunity earlier to enjoy his arousal and have a proper wank before he was being hauled off to sleep.
“You said he wasn’t happy!”
is a feat of mythical proportion, indeed.
“In a minute,” he murmurs. “One more question.”
He envies her.
is what finishes that sentence, but Sherlock has never asked for company in his life. Or permission. So instead, Greg just says, “Shall we?”
He can see Sherlock’s gaze clock the child in the car before boring holes through his skin and muscle and marrow. “Where is he?”
“Yes, you,” he spit. “Do you really think your wife shot my brother to save him?”
Because he’s dead.
“Oh, will I?”
She knows her Daddy is brave so she doesn’t reply. She’s not sure she could even if she wanted to. Her throat is still working very hard to not make a sound.
And those five words ignite a fury in him that takes him by surprise. But it shouldn’t. It’s been simmering beneath the surface, but those words - those enraging words - are like tossing gasoline on a flame. They’re the spark from Thomas Farriner’s bakery that burned London to the ground.
Mycroft stares at the quiet street, making visual confirmation with the few agents he can actually see. He knows there are far more scattered about. “Sherlock shouldn’t be seen.”
“Come on, then,” Mrs. Hudson says when she stands, showing remarkable fortitude when she meets his eyes for the first time. No doubt she’d prefer to clap him about the ears, but instead she starts talking about tea, which is so comforting, he could sit down right here on the stoop. “Well go ahead,” she urges and that’s when her false bravado falters; when she reaches up and runs her hand through his hair, so like his mother used to, and cups her cheek in a palm that’s frail, but strong.
“Precisely. Well done, Watson. You torture them with ten square inches filled with glass and nails, poking and prodding every time you bump into it.” His gaze falls on the photo still lying on the desk. “Or look at it.” He reaches out and picks it up, running his finger along the glass, just as he had done to the mobile. “He had it on the wall next to the bed, which would have annoyed her. She hated me.” He weighs the frame in his hands, passing it back and forth between his right and his left. “Oh she was quite the actress, make no mistake. In the beginning, anyway. But she made one glaring error. It’s fine, they all do.”
But he doesn’t think of John Watson. Not if he can help it. Unlike Baker Street, the cottage is full of sunlight, with wide windows not inhibited by thick curtains and pale blue paint reflecting the light off of the relatively low ceilings. The hearth is nearly always lit and the kettle is always boiled. He doesn’t ever expect company, but one can only spend so many months in a dark basement before one begins craving the opposite.
In due time, of course.
Some new players.
He listens to John’s words and remembers that determined little girl in the closet who looked up at a grown man, a stranger, and hit dial anyway, just to make sure he was telling the truth.
“Thank you,” he says to her, and he tries to infuse those two words with as much love and gratitude as he can muster, which at the moment, isn’t much, but it’s all he’s got.
Now, he calls Sussex home, with the buzz of the bees in the yard and the sea salt in the air making his curls do all manner of impossible things. He has a schedule these days. He wakes around eight in the morning, makes tea, and putters with the newspaper. He does his PT stretches in the living room whose windows overlook the hives. He has more tea and then dons his beekeeping suit, ready to check on the kingdom he shares with a Queen he’s named Lola.
They stand there long enough for his bad back to ache, until Sherlock’s sobs subside and the collar of Greg’s shirt is soaked through. He maneuvers him over to the couch and lowers him down to it, clocking the limp and the feel of uneven skin through the thin, poncy shirt at his back. Sherlock collapses into the leather and Greg takes a seat on the coffee table in front of him, lowering his head to try and catch his gaze, but never letting go of his shoulder.
Mycroft turns at that, looking like he’s aged a decade in a day. “All of us, I’m afraid.”
“She might have. I do believe she loved him. In her way.”
Mycroft’s expression darkened. “Thanks to you, my brother’s future, regrettably, is.”
“You could have just called, instead of driving all the way out here and wasting precious time.”
“I don’t know. Two, I think.”
He’s losing the battle to stay awake.
“They took him. He’s hurt,” she cries. “Sherlock said he’d bring him back.” Her breath hitches again, catching as her red face nearly turns purple. “I want Sherlock!”
The light in the closet is turned on and it seeps through the cracks in the tiny square door she hides behind.
Maybe he fell.
“Well, he’s very good,” she says succinctly with a little head nod and he huffs out a chuckle.
“So what now, genius?” he asks fondly.
“Sherlock, what are you talking about?” he asks, because his brother is almost manic now, lost to the spiral of discovery.
“Mrs. Hudson, it’s Mycroft Holmes.”
throughout the whole ordeal that Mycroft had gotten complacent. He had forgotten, for a moment. So fate saw fit to remind him that she is just a child, a six-year-old who’s lost the only constant in her life; the only thing that truly matters.
before that.”
“Mrs. Hudson,” Mycroft says again, staring at the small sliver of John’s face he can see behind the ‘play’ icon. It’s bloodied and bruised and no sight for a child - for
She is six-years-old when her world falls apart, though if you asked her, she’d probably tell you she’s nearly seven. Her birthday is in February and it’s October so it’s close enough to round up. Her father always told her she was wise beyond her years, which was all the permission she needed to be a little bit flexible with the details.
“Where is he?” he had asked.
“Dr. Watson came to me after the truth about who he had been living with came to light - ”
“Yes, please.”
But Sherlock is already shaking his head, eyes never leaving the picture on the homescreen.
her father says to her.)
Rosie wiggles enough that Sherlock puts her down on shaky legs on the pavement. She’s up the steps and vaguely remembering to be gentle as she barrels into Nana’s waiting arms, burying her face in her neck and inhaling her familiar perfume.
He cannot muddle through this.
“Rosamund, take your toast to go. We’re leaving.”
Sherlock Holmes should never look like that.
“Of course I care, John. What kind of stupid question is that?” She actually has the gall to look affronted.
That makes sense. “So would I.”
He spent a bit too long with only his thoughts for company in Uzbekistan.
“Not here,” he grunts as he lifts her and carries her to the door.
“Ah.” He glances out the window to find that they’ve parked outside a modest townhouse in some suburb whose name he honestly can’t be bothered to learn. He opens the car door and breathes in the London air, surreptitiously stretching his knee and wincing as it pops yet remains stiff.
Mycroft clears his throat. “Early this morning.”
“I wanted to be… whole,” he admitted, “when I saw him.”
Greg’s ears ring as his mind conjures all manner of horrific images for him.
She rolls her eyes, but decides she likes him even more because he doesn’t know typical night-time routines. “The point of tucking someone in is that you’re supposed to
No, no he’s not. John knew that. Which was why the next question was so devastating to ask:
“Don’t mind me,” she says, but that’s preposterous. He’s never minded her. Even when she’s on her herbal soothers.
Rosamund.
It’s a bit morbid given the circumstances, but that’s the sphere in which they operate. The shadows where they conduct the day’s business.
Excluding the aftermath of the fight, the house is relatively clean. Neat, but lived in, as evidenced by the basket of clean, folded laundry on the dining room table and the pile of toys and children’s books that have been carefully stacked by the sofa, an old Roald Dahl on top.
“Beg your pardon?” Sherlock asks, eyes sliding over to his brother for the briefest of seconds.
He wakes some indeterminate time later, tied to a chair with a raging headache pounding away at his skull. His shirt is tacky with semi-dried blood on the right side of his body, but he can’t check the state of the wound given his current circumstances.
“Yes, with me.”
“You’re Uncle Greg.”
She cups his cheek, more weathered than when she last saw him, before nodding towards the stairs. “They’re up there.”
“Fine,” Sherlock relents. “But just the two of us.”
Mycroft glances at the ceiling. “Putting Miss Watson to bed.”
Mycroft frowns, but before he can ask for clarification, Sherlock fixes him with a look that’s brokenly resigned.
He leaves Sherlock rooting around in the kitchen and heads up the stairs, noticing the distinct lack of family pictures which he’s seen dotting so many suburban hallways. He pokes his head in the first door at the top - clearly Rosie’s bedroom - and glances around. It’s tidy, but her bed is unmade, hastily so. He’d read the file - he knew John had grabbed her in the middle of the night.
Sherlock sinks back into the cushions, leg already bouncing, fingers drumming a beat against his kneecap. “I need to go back to the house. I didn’t get enough time there. Before...”
Mycroft squares his shoulders. “Would you have listened?”
At six-years-old, there are many things Rosie Watson doesn’t account for. She doesn’t account for how food gets on her table or how new clothes get in her drawers or a plethora of other things that just
She thinks she may pass out, which she’s never done before and it’s all a bit scary, but then arms circle around her and lift her deftly, turning her away from the puddle of blood and pressing her wet face (when did she start crying?) into a strong shoulder.
He yells for Mrs. Hudson.
“Light on or off?”
The making or the breaking, indeed.
If anything, it makes her hold on tighter.
. “You’ve been glancing around the flat as if it’s an old friend you haven’t seen in far too long.”
“Oh thank God,” she breathes, and he must remind himself that, though Sherlock has been a hermit and he himself tied to his desk, John has lived a life. Has woven people in and out of the fabric of his days and his daughter’s until a tapestry had formed of family and connection and love.
She really wants to stay awake because she knows they’re going to talk about her father, but it was a long night and an even longer morning and the leather seat really is very comfortable. She feels her head loll, not quite sure when her eyes closed, but the next time she wakes, the suffocating silence is back and she knows that all of the important words were said while she was sleeping.
Sometimes he feels like his life is one long series of wasted opportunities. He could have the proof of it drawn up in triplicate.
She'd be nearly two by then.
“She got past us.”
"Living," he replies. It seems to be an accurate summation. Even if it’s a half-life.
“Because
“What do you do with someone you don’t like?” he says slowly. Distractedly. “Someone who’s been naughty?”
She eyes him somewhat warily through swollen lids, this stranger who’s entered their safe space, but then he watches something click in that gaze that’s seen far too much in her short years.
She ignores him. “Would you like to tell him? That you’re alive and well? Or should I?”

221 always seemed dark and a tad dreary to her, at least the hallway. Nana’s flat was cheery with its pink curtains and neverending offerings of tea and biscuits, but she and Daddy never did go upstairs. She snuck up once, when she was little (well, littler) and Daddy got angry. It was strange, though. He wasn’t angry at her. It was like he was angry at the room and she had no idea why. It didn’t seem all that special or even dangerous. It was just a room with fun patterned wallpaper and a skull on the mantle, which frightened her at first before she realized someone had stuck a cigar in his mouth and then it just made her giggle.
“You think he’s been shot?” he manages after a moment.
she had exclaimed and a part of John died at knowing his daughter was forced to learn Mycroft’s name before Sherlock’s. Her middle names remained a mystery.
He heads into the living room and waits by the fireplace, catching his morbid reflection in the mirror and aiming a sigh at the skull. Frequently a better companion to his brother than he ever was.
Mycroft thinks of the version of his brother he left in the countryside and how far he’s come since then. Of how far he hasn’t still and how many wounds are yet to heal.
They eventually go down to her flat for some food because Rosamund needs to eat, despite her protestations, and when they return, her belly is full and her eyes are sleepy. The minute she goes up to change into pajamas, Mrs. Hudson’s frail stoicism crumbles and she dissolves into tears she’s been keeping at bay all evening.
“Where is he? Right now? I know you know!”
Mycroft tries hard to gauge Sherlock’s disposition but he vacillates between a puppy that’s been kicked and a snake that’s a moment away from striking. He doesn’t even take the time to look around the flat he called home for so many years, too busy pulling at his hair while Rosamund quietly watches from where she’s tucked up against Mrs. Hudson’s side on the sofa.
“Oh my brave girl,” he whispers, wiping her tears with his thumbs. “Whatever happens, whatever you hear, don’t come out, okay? That’s very important. Even if it sounds -” he stops and licks his lips, forehead creasing. He looks upset. “Even if it sounds like bad things are happening, stay put. Please, for me.”
“Here. I think I have something that belongs to you,” he says to Rosamund, pulling a plush toy from his pocket.
Greg knows it’s not a big flat, but they’ve barely scratched the surface. “What about - ?”
A blonde head watches him carefully from the backseat, eyes so like her father’s barely able to see out the window.
He doesn’t know that his world will implode in a matter of hours.
“That still leaves us with four pretty large options, all on separate sides of the country,” Lestrade says, fiddling with his mobile. “He’s been missing long enough to reach any of them.”
All in all, it wasn’t bad.
“Oh well, my mistake,” he murmurs, hiding a smile as he digs the covers around her tiny body nice and tight. “Better?”
He lets that reveal land, taking entirely too much delight in the way her face slackens, in the way her features lose their edge, giving way to something truly surprised. It’s been a while since he’s been able to do that; catch her off guard.
Truth be told, though, he had tired of fighting by that point.
He rewinds and finds himself back at the pool -
“Mary never would have given John the only copy, though,” Sherlock argues, but Mycroft makes a noise of disagreement.
When Rosie was one, he took up boxing. He knew it was the only way he’d be able to get in bed next to his wife and not throttle her in the middle of the night. He performed his husbandly duties but barely, claiming any excuse he could find using his not insignificant medical knowledge. And when he did, he was militant about birth control. Not that he wouldn’t love another child, but another child was another chain to Mary and it was enough trouble trying to untether himself as it was.
“Both of them?”
Mr. Holmes sounds bored when he replies. “Would you have answered?”
The footsteps come closer and she forces tension into her muscles solely so she stops trembling. She clasps a hand over mouth and holds her father’s mobile in her sweaty palm like the lifeline it is.
Greg narrows his eyes and steps closer, arms still crossed over his chest. He’s spent every minute since that blocked number appeared on his mobile wondering why Mycroft called him. He’s a retired DI who could barely get Sherlock to listen on the best of days. Why on earth is he here? But maybe - just maybe - this is it.
Funny that, in her head, Mycroft Holmes is Mr. Holmes, but Sherlock is just that. Just Sherlock. Her detective. And if there’s one thing Daddy taught her, it’s to follow the Detective.
Somewhere a clock is ticking. The light in the kitchen is buzzing.
“Anyway,” says John, and little crinkles appear at the corners of his eyes as he grins. Sherlock wants to kiss them, but is prevented by John reaching one hand towards him and smoothing the fringe from Sherlock’s face. His fingertips skid purposefully over the skin of Sherlock’s scalp. “Pasta is okay for dinner, yeah?”
“Good,” John said, letting the adulation positively drip from his tone. “Very good, Sherlock.”
but not the husband?”
“These should be bandaged,” he muttered. “You’re a doctor. I’d expect better of you.”
“He would’ve happily given me whatever figure I asked for, but then he’d have lorded his generosity over me at every turn afterwards. Fat, scheming arse.” Sherlock’s face twisted even further, darkening until he was fairly spitting his words. “And now he’s apparently fed you a load of rubbish about me being helpless and destitute—”
The first few are more of the same: light, more noise than pain. John’s mental timekeeping is off, so ten seconds becomes somewhere between 11.1 and 11.9 seconds. During which he smooths his palm gently along the skin he’s just spanked, making little circling motions with his fingers, before he lifts his hand and swats Sherlock softly again.
“Multiple times in one day seemed like a lot, I suppose. Anyway. Just ignore me. I don’t know what I’m talking about. I could respond to it verbally now if you want.”
Awful didn’t begin to describe it. The tea was dreadfully oversteeped, so bitter that Sherlock couldn’t help but screw up his face in disgust. Even the milk (too little) and the sugar (too much) couldn’t mask the taste.
, Sherlock thought,
John whimpered, almost swept away by the thought. “God, yes.” Then Sherlock’s tongue skidded perfectly over his fraenulum, and John nearly sobbed. “There. Oh god, right there.”
For once, it didn’t sound like an awful idea. Things were happening to him now—all of them centred on Sherlock, which might’ve been pathetic. Still, it was more than he’d had a few months ago, and Ella (not to mention Harry, the only other person reading John’s blog) would probably be thrilled to know that he was dating someone.
John jumped. “What?”
An older, kind-looking woman stood in the doorway, smiling at John but still managing somehow to look slightly harried. She wore a white apron with bits of flour sprinkled on it.
And what does it say about Sherlock, he wonders, if he enjoys being hurt—
He’s fairly shouting by the time he stops, and Sherlock is half-shrunken into the armchair, listening to John’s fury rumble through the room like a crack of thunder and waiting for Rosie to jerk awake and add her own anger to the mix.
It reminds him of having his mouth fucked, pumped so full of come it dribbles from the corners of his lips, which makes him think of being filled from both ends.
John had barely shut the door behind him before Sherlock was scrambling to his feet and lunging for his phone.
“Sorry,” John said. “Which flat did you say it was?”
“Not really
John always relished the opportunity to help Sherlock undress. To stand chest to chest while he unbuttoned Sherlock’s shirt, to tell Sherlock
John’s weak and quivering limbs give, and he collapses to his stomach. Sherlock follows, still lapping insistently at John’s sloppy, sensitive hole.
A cold puff against his ear, a whisper in Mary’s voice: “Scared, Dr Watson?”
Of course not. John knew very well that first thing tomorrow he would go to Speedy’s to pick up whatever watch Sherlock had apparently bought him. Just to see it, to continue going along with the insanity that Sherlock Holmes had brought into his life. John could always, like he’d considered doing with the shoes, refuse to accept the watch after he’d seen it or offer to pay Sherlock back for it. There wasn’t any harm in that, was there?
“Morning! Hope you don’t mind. May I?”
It’s a bit frightening how matter of fact you are about all that you know.
But he loves this. Christ, John loves this.
John started, horrified. “She heard us, didn’t she?”
Fine. So it was scratched. And SH’s solution to that, apparently, was to… buy John another phone?
By the time that John finally spilled onto the sheets, clenching around Sherlock’s tongue and feeling Sherlock moan against his oversensitive skin, the ache in his arse had worsened to the point of smarting.
But once she’s finished speaking, Molly stands from her stool as though the conversation is over, so Sherlock swallows it all and stands as well, gathering his coat more tightly around himself.
They were silent the rest of the ride.
of vampire culture.”
John wondered if Sherlock masturbated. Ever? Often? What did she like? What did she think of? Where did she do it—in her bed like John, in the shower, somewhere else? The entire concept—Sherlock as a sexual being, Sherlock with masturbatory habits—was so foreign; John couldn’t picture it.
A fair point, Sherlock supposed. He conceded it. “They’re a disaster. I don’t know how you can stand it.”
Exactly as Sherlock hoped, John grasps Sherlock’s hair, tugging until Sherlock’s chin is tipped up and his back is arched, while he tosses himself off, gasping “Oh my god, you filthy fucking tart.”
Sherlock laid one paw over the other, rested his chin atop them, and closed his eyes.
—Sherlock wailed and clung to John’s bruised shoulder and came.
“Oh, that’s handy. Okay, um. Shall we... get started? I think I’ve done everything I need on my end.”
<JohnHWatson> How do you make torches?
—” John lifted even higher so that he was sitting on his haunches, mirroring Sherlock, although looking no doubt far more attractive. “—won’t be the largest thing I’ve had up me.”
Sometimes, when Sherlock is sufficiently wet and loosened, John stands again and glides the tip of his cock over and over Sherlock’s hole, occasionally pushing in slightly, just enough that Sherlock can feel the first hint of burning as the muscle begins to stretch, then withdrawing when Sherlock tries to rock backwards and impale himself properly.
“I’ll be home for dinner,” he says.
Ridiculous. John didn’t understand any of what was going on in his own head.
it, although it’s been years since you trusted someone enough to suggest doing away with protection. But you trust me, don’t you? You trust me, and you want nothing more than to feel my tongue against your cock and fill my mouth with your come.”
“Dunno. That might’ve felt like the bigger betrayal,” John said, squinting down at his steaming cup. “She’s been married to her husband for four years, but she’s known her sister her whole life.” He thought of himself and Harry, the decades of resentment they’d built up between them. “Then again, siblings aren’t always close. Sometimes the problems between them are, well, deep. There might’ve been friction there even before the sister started—”
Yet another element falling under the umbrella of
Sherlock refused to let her eyes widen, although her surprise was considerable. The cheeky comment, the flirty smile….
“—sensitive,” Sherlock decided on. “My back is—”
“The current theory is that so-called ‘ghosts,’” Sherlock rattled, “are simply energy that, according to the basic laws of physics, could not be destroyed after death. Which is preposterous, of course, as any energy in the human body is released after death in the form of heat or transferred—what?”
. John shuddered and bit back his own whimper.
Sherlock?
He could. Graham Doss was youngish, probably still in his twenties, white, and muscular. His hair was blond with dark roots: dyed.
John glanced down. Although his view was limited, what he could see—Sherlock’s eyes closed, his forehead wrinkled like he was deep in concentration, his pretty red lips stretched thin around John’s length—made John’s face go hot and his prick throb. He sounded rather choked himself when he said, “Fine. Have it your way.”
With a shaky breath, Sherlock drops his hands and looks at John, who’s still sitting down although with one elbow on the arm of the chair and his cheek propped in his hand, confident and casual as you please. “I beg your pardon?”
“Um,” John said.
Stop. Just stop.
All right. Enjoy your time with Lydia.
There was no reason the sight should’ve affected Sherlock like a blow to the head. John’s arse in dark-grey trousers was nothing he hadn’t seen before, nothing worth staring at in awe as though he were an unnaturally sheltered teenager who’d never before glimpsed an attractive human. Sherlock didn’t do that sort of thing. He was above it.
, Sherlock thinks feverishly.
“Don’t,” he said, in his most grimly serious tone, “touch me.”
Would be hers. Sherlock swore it.
That was true, wasn’t it? John certainly shouldn’t have felt as chuffed as he did. That was probably a bit not good. Morally dubious at best.
—then Sherlock wanted him to find it clean, lacking any strong scent or taste, and… perhaps not attractive but at least not
“What’s got you in such a snit, then?” Mrs Hudson said.
“And you… enjoy that, do you?”
“The murderous fetishist,” he found himself saying anyway. He’d been wondering about the details of that since the very beginning, after all. “The case you were working when you first messaged me on the site. How did you solve it?”
Funny, you know he said the same thing about you. Also that YOU call him your archenemy, not that he calls himself it.
better off without him.”
Did you actually just chastise me for not following your guide closely enough? After you berated me for relying too heavily on it? So you’re not only an arrogant prat, but the sort of arrogant prat that changes his mind constantly and expects everyone to just go along with his whims? Good to know.
“You thought we’d come home and shop online,” John finished, staring wide-eyed at the screen. When she’d agreed last week to Sherlock’s suggestion of a strap-on, she hadn’t envisioned a harness costing £100, but that was precisely the cost of the one that Sherlock had pulled up on screen. Surely there was a less expensive option, something that John could actually afford?
Oh, he
, he thought, eyes drifting shut,
him swallowing around it.
“Excuse me? Hang on, you can’t honestly think—”
I’m not going to argue about video games with someone who had to be told that his inventory was full because he couldn’t deduce it on his own.
All thoughts about cost fled John’s mind like frightened birds.
The man approaching was familiar, although it wasn’t until John glanced around and spied a sleek black car idling nearby that he realised where he recognised him from.
<JohnHWatson> I added you on Steam all right didn’t I?
“Yeah? Well, bully for you. I’m not letting you bugger me until I know you’ve had enough calories to keep your strength up.”
He shifted in his armchair and clasped his fingers beneath his chin. He didn’t look away from the bit of wallpaper he was staring at and said nothing. Let John think he was so deep in his mind palace that he hadn’t heard the question.
“I want it,” he says. Because his voice is considerably muffled by John’s skin, he tosses his head back a bit and repeats, “I
“Oh for god’s sake!” Sherlock throws his chair back and lunges for the rattle, then the elephant, then the jingly butterfly. “She’s going to do it again. Of course she’s going to do it again, because that’s who she
Time to impress.
Also obvious was that the man had had at least one profile on an adult website. It had taken Sherlock less than a half hour to find it.
“Sorry,” John murmured. “I probably just got come all over your sheets.”
He clears his throat once more, then heaves himself to standing. “Yes, well, thrilling as this has been, I’m afraid I must ask you to
“Oh. So you’re unattached, like me.”
Of course not. Not John: kind, considerate, selfless John.
John’s voice was level, calm. He was concerned, but not overly much. After all, Sherlock’s mind was often preoccupied with one thing or another. John probably didn’t have the slightest clue that the fault here was his.
John laughed. That was probably the last response he’d expected.
Oh right. I suppose you would be too clever for them.
The thought of his cock inside it… oh, that was a nice thought.
“It started… I’m not sure, actually. It seems like she’s always sort of been drinking, even as a teenager. I only noticed how bad it had got after our mum died. Why?”
Eventually, John abandoned his cock, although it still twitched uselessly against Sherlock’s belly. His sobs grew deeper, and his limbs shook in their restraints like bits of glass in an earthquake.
Sherlock’s view would be limited. With John lying atop him, he would see only a fraction of what he desired to.)
“Oh no.” Sherlock smiled brightly. “I ensured it. He ran a drug cartel and was arrested, quite rightly, for double murder. Not a very nice man. Don’t worry, she’s much,
“Excellent,” said Sherlock. “Let’s go home.”
Sherlock remembers. John’s perpetually sullen expression, the sagging line of his shoulders, the slow formation of near-cavernous bags beneath his eyes, aging him more than even the moustache and the worst of his PTSD had done.
He trimmed his pubic hair, which was thick and curly and a bit wild. Or at least he removed the tufts around his prick. He was somewhat less comfortable aiming sharp objects at his testicles, which were more awkward to reach. The strip of hair surrounding his arsehole was left similarly alone. Hopefully, if John had any interest in exploring either area, he wouldn’t be put off by the hair.
As it was, it felt like the air was being punched from his lungs and the coherent logic being drained from his thoughts. His mind was nothing but a marsh of clichés like
John was torn between needing to protect Sherlock and needing to get Rosie as far away from the threat as possible. He was saved the decision by Sherlock grabbing John’s shoulder and shoving him behind him, away from the door, shielding them both with his body.
To John’s surprise, Sherlock’s lip quirked into a crooked little smile. “Fair enough. You’ll just have to trust me, I suppose.”
in her cunt: a sweet shockwave that ended too soon as Sherlock mashed her face into John’s vulva and pressed her tongue against John’s clit so hard it nearly hurt.
They played fetch until Sherlock’s knees and palms were sore, his mouth and throat dry from panting, his usually quick, clear thoughts beginning to drift in and out of focus—and until John’s bodily self-control had been largely chipped away, leaving him grimacing and squirming, his left knee bouncing incessantly.
“God,” said John. Her tone was hushed, awed. “Look at you. You’re gorgeous like that.”
JohnHWatson: Hello!
Well. No, actually, she supposed he hadn’t been sweet with her. Not like this. John was nuzzling her palm now, purring like a motor. Mycroft had never done anything like that.
“Don’t push me, John,” it said. “You won’t like it if you do.”
“Coffee?” John asks, nodding to a Starbucks across the street.
When Sherlock eventually pulled back, John was breathless, his lips wet.
The bridge of Sherlock’s nose wrinkled. “Not consciously, perhaps. Now, is there a particular shape that you prefer? I could provide you links to the sites I found, and you could bookmark the options that most appeal to you.”
Mrs Hudson said. Would John have any interest in marrying him?
John thought wryly. Aloud he said, “Oh, really? Because I thought I might have a paragraph of nothing but the word ‘childe’ repeated one hundred times to commemorate the occasion. Like a poem.”
It was brilliant, though. He found it difficult to stop smiling.
For more than four hours, the monitor was silent, and then suddenly Rosie was cooing to herself and making rustling noises. Rolling over, maybe even trying to pull herself to standing using the rails of her cot. Her motor skills weren’t especially advanced or graceful yet, but she was keen.
, she thought, wincing.
John laughed. “So that’s what gets you going, is it? I’ll try to remember that.”
John laughed, incredulous. “And worry the whole time that I’m suffocating you? Ta, but no. Especially when you can’t move your arms to stop me if something goes wrong. Nothing quite ruins the mood like involuntary manslaughter.”
“Oh.”
John set the laptop on her knees and opened it.
By the time John comes, Sherlock’s own cock is finally, blessedly semi-hard.
But they didn’t talk like that, that wasn’t who they were, so he swallowed again and said, “Come on, Daddy. I want to fuck gold.”
“Ah I see. I have a needy puppy, do I?”
“No, I don’t think so. Not exactly hard, is it, the combat in this game.”
Sherlock did, and moaned gratefully when John knelt behind him and replaced his fingers with his prick, which slid in easily (if noisily) and felt so bloody perfect that Sherlock wanted to shout but could only manage a whimpering cry and another twist of the bedsheets.
He was aware of how absurd he looked, a disabled man taking a picture of the ceiling in a room of priceless portraits, but he did his best to shove the embarrassment aside as he closed the camera, opened his text messages, and sent the photo to SH. Then he stuffed the phone in his pocket, ducked his head, and turned to leave.
The smell of blood was stronger here, although not by much. (His shoes, Sherlock thought. John had cleaned himself and changed his clothes, but not his shoes.) Sherlock couldn’t help but linger on the scent, the associations. Plasma, iron, chains, gunpowder, John… Mary.
“Okay,” John said quickly, leaving the lift now that it had arrived at his floor. Although he wanted to giggle now even more than before, he made a dedicated effort to keep his voice even and soothing. “Okay. Sorry. I didn’t mean to offend you. It’s just… well, it’s impressive. That’s all.”
Abruptly John felt like he had tipped his hand, which was absurd. He wasn’t sure he even had a hand to tip. “You did give me a sheet of paper covered in your handwriting just last night,” he said, perhaps too defensively.
“Dirty talk,” John said, only mildly surprised. It was far from the most unexpected thing Sherlock had ever said to him. “It’s all right. Depends on what sort of dirty talk it is, I suppose.”
“All right?” John asked.
Because John was near enough now that Sherlock could hear her. Her throaty “uh, uh” as she rutted against the vibrator and her breathy “ahh” as she rocked back onto the dildo, and her seemingly startled “oh, oh, oh” when the rumbling vibrations hit her sensitive clit just right.
16 May, 6:10 a.m.
, John thought. Of course Sherlock was still on about that. “Maybe a bit,” he admitted.
“You and your ruddy detective cost me 400 litres of stock,” Harvey spat. “Drastic measures and all that.” He rummaged about on the table until he’d produced a hypodermic needle and a liquid-filled vial. “Fortunately, I know a few vamps in London. And new childe blood’s in high demand these days. You’ll make up for the loss.”
“That’s it?” John giggled and opened her eyes again, arching a brow at Sherlock. “That’s the best you can do?”
Sherlock’s shoulders jumped, and John realised with a good bit of guilt that he’d been falling asleep before John had opened his bloody stupid mouth.
Sherlock was unfathomable. He worried about asking John to get on top of him when they were snogging, but badgering him to move in was apparently acceptable. John sighed, shaking his head.
Sherlock cocked his head in a way that told John he was being judged rather harshly for that question. “Lestrade working a blood smuggling case? Of course not. There’s been a body found in a flat in Hackney. I’ll give you time to drink and have a shower if you’re quick about it. Otherwise, I’m leaving you behind.”
There was a hint of discomfort in her expression, a deeper wrinkling of her forehead and a downwards quirk to her lips that wouldn’t be present if she were experiencing only pleasure. Sufficiently wet, thin but long toy, impaled directly onto it—
“I can’t believe it,” said the man who’d spoken earlier. “He actually—”
By ‘playing style’, I mean how you’re developing your character. Which skills you’re picking up is part of it, as are which weapons you favour and how you approach enemies. Do you charge into battle carrying a sword in each hand? Do you hide and snipe from a distance? That sort of thing.
, he thought,
(It was so easy to forget. In the exhilaration of the chase through London, John forgot that it was anything more than Sherlock’s damnably long legs that made him so bloody fast, impossible to keep up with. John forgot a lot of things, really—everything but the whip of the wind in his face, the burn in his legs, and how his heart pounded in his ears as loud as a series of gunshots.
She lay down exactly as Sherlock had instructed, keeping the phone pressed to her ear as Sherlock continued to speak.
“I could describe my methods, of course. But I think it might be more effective to show you. Come back to my flat with me after dinner.”
But that doesn’t make sense. Although Sherlock’s person isn’t entirely devoid of any indication of his and John’s relationship, the signs—the dusting of John’s hair on his coat, the faint scent of John’s aftershave still lingering on his collar, his previous fondling of the sex wounds on his hip—are subtle enough he doubts Molly, clever though she is, is capable of spotting them.
“You’re wet,” Sherlock said. An inane comment, but she was too awed to hold it in. They’d done nothing so far. John had pawed at her pretty breasts and let Sherlock kiss her, and already she was so wet that Sherlock could
. There was no welcome screen or spinning hourglass while it loaded. Instead, it had gone immediately to the home screen.
The message read:
But there was also the fact that Sherlock was a great deal more chatty than Mycroft. Mrs Hudson thought sometimes that he meowed simply to hear himself talk, as he took to spending his afternoons and some of his evenings sprawled across her sofa, rolling from one side to the other, making happy little
John,
We didn’t decide anything of the sort. You sort of declared, I said no, and then we had a snog.
Sherlock huffed dramatically and threw up his arms in a sort of ‘Dear god, look what I have to deal with’ way. “No one
Sherlock blinked. “Yes.” His gaze flickered downwards, fixing on John’s lips.
When he feels a cautious touch to his left hip, Sherlock gains a sudden appreciation for the aptness of the idiom
“Erm,” John said when he was close enough. He hunched a bit, trying to make himself as unthreatening as possible. “Hello. Sherlock Holmes asked me to meet him here.”
John’s height isn’t ideal for every sexual activity, unfortunately. Sherlock finds it utterly impossible, for instance, to fellate him efficiently unless John is either lying down or seated very low in a chair.
Are you serious? He was your friend. Of course it affected you strongly.
“Mm. You’re bored. You need
“Daddy,” he said, half gasping. “Fuck. Daddy.”
And with a small, pleased whimper, Sherlock obeys. He remains utterly still, helpless, shaking, until he finally makes a mess of the floor, sending a series of whining “Oh, oh, oh”s towards the ceiling.
“I—I did actually, yeah. How did you—”
His legs were weak, a little wobbly, as he climbed off the bed. He approached the chest, grasped the handle for John’s sock drawer, and opened it—
This time, the skin wasn’t just white, it also bore the clear impression of Sherlock’s front teeth: both incisors and cuspids on the top row, and all the way to her premolars on the bottom. The top row faded in seconds, although the bottom one remained.
“Still could,” Sherlock piped up. “Just pop back outside, and we’ll pretend you were never here.”
‘Manipulative git,’ John thought without heat. He was right about at least one thing, though: John did crave it.
“... Hi, hello?”
“Yeah, I know,” John sighed. “Cheers. Just let me be disappointed in the world for a bit, and then I’ll move on.”
John drags him to his bedroom, grumbling the entire walk through the kitchen and the hallway about Sherlock’s height and limbs and weight and also just his general personality.
“I know,” John said. He was still stroking Sherlock’s hair, massaging his scalp. “I understand now. You thought I was finally going to propose, and I didn’t. Although why you thought I’d propose to you in a random bloody restaurant is—well. It’s fine. It doesn’t matter now. So you don’t mind if I quit?”
“How the hell did I miss that? Stay there. I’m on my way.”
“Oh yeah,” said Jennifer. “A tall, pale bloke. Had a really nice coat, but he was a right bastard. He had a weird name, I can’t remember it.”
Only a few more hours left. Do you have a case or anything to keep you busy?
His home had been haunted. Now it was gone.
ScienceOfDeduction,
“Because I doubt you could manage taking photos, sending photos, and talking on the same phone, and the camera on your old one is abysmal. I want you all the way aroused. Take all the time you need. I can wait.”
“You sure? Not even this?”
Or John could refuse, of course, and carry on being a useless, damaged ex-Army doctor.
It was so strange, so very far from the sort of thing you were supposed to give someone you wanted to seduce, that John ducked his head and bit his lip, holding in a giggle. It was… endearing. Stupidly,
He ‘d put his hand on my shoulder and I’d feel it for days
There’s nothing to be read in the gesture, of course, but nevertheless—sitting there with Rosie asleep in his arms and John’s head with its sweet-smelling hair pillowed on his shoulder—Sherlock shivers and smiles.
“But for me,” John said. He looked away, his brows drawing closer and his forehead wrinkling. “A while.”
On the other side, he found Sherlock, mobile phone in his hands and typing furiously. He appeared more or less the same as he had when they’d parted outside the restaurant, wearing his long black coat and blue scarf, although his hair looked a mess, like he’d got caught in a strong wind.
, Sherlock thinks in despair.
“Please,” John said. “Please, god.”
But, although the dictionaries are more direct and thus more clear, they aren’t especially helpful either.
You arsehole. You have no idea what you’re talking about.
A flash of panic—John wouldn’t deny him this, he couldn’t be so cruel after Sherlock had been so good—and then Sherlock understood. A shy bladder, John fighting the part of himself that had been no doubt taught to wee only into a toilet. Sherlock tried to be patient. He shuffled backwards very slightly on his hands and knees, letting out a long pleading whine and wiggling his bottom as though he had a tail to wag.
, and that Sherlock was lying here worshipping her, enamoured of her. John had always been confident of her sexuality. She was a minx. A tease.
Mycroft would say.
You’ve got several rather unbecoming qualities, I see.
Sherlock’s own pussy ached and throbbed like a forming bruise, and she felt wetter than she’d ever been before. Enough that she could feel her knickers clinging to her and her labia dragging slickly over her clit as she squeezed her thighs together.
Yeah no. Using past traumas to manipulate me is a bit not good, Sherlock.
“Give me a bit,” said Sherlock. “Before you undo the cuffs. I want to, uhm. I want to stay here just a bit longer.”
‘Ah’? That’s all you’ve got to say?
John started and the woman whirled around, and there was Sherlock—striding briskly from the house towards them. He was glowing, his mouth stretched wide in a smile that lit him up like a shower of sparks. He looked gorgeous. John was breathless at just the sight of him.
They’d have thrown her out, you know, they’d have sent her somewhere to get shock therapy or god knows whatelse
The paper was covered front and back in writing, the first line of which did indeed read ‘Favourite colour: ASH.’ Also listed were things like favourite composer (NICCOLÓ PAGANINI) and favourite animal (IRISH SETTER), but as John flipped the page to scan the back, he noticed things like favourite method of murder (RARE SLOW-KILLING POISONS) and favourite method of body disposal (DUMPING INTO LARGE BODY OF WATER) and even favourite unsolved disappearance (LOUIS LE PRINCE, FRANCE, 1890).
It made John think again of the woman at the crime scene, Sergeant Donovan: how she had claimed that Sherlock didn’t have friendswhen he clearly had at least one in Mrs Hudson and one in Angelo.
When it cleared, Sherlock was expounding on the diet and defensive behaviour of the false widow spider, and as John paid the cabbie, Sherlock switched abruptly to discussing bee sting venom and variations across different bee species.
In the shower, he’d decided to hold off on saying it. To make Sherlock long for it and crave it and become half-mad with the desire to hear that he was wanted, trusted, needed, the way he had at the very, very beginning. But now John licked his lips and said, gruffly, “Yes, Daddy.”
Because Sherlock has never failed John as spectacularly as he did with Mary. Countless indications of Mary’s true identity missed because Sherlock refused to let himself fully deduce her. He didn’t want to see her flaws and all the bits of her that didn’t line up perfectly with John, to fixate on them, and to live with the knowledge that John was marrying someone flawed who didn’t suit him as well as Sherlock.
He’s said it—he’s actually said it. Sherlock should be pleased about that; he should be thrilled.
nice to finally have occasion to meet the man who’s made my brother so eager to agree t—”
So John filled Sherlock’s mouth with the tentacle again and fucked his throat until there were not only tears rolling down his cheeks, but snot and drool as well. His face was soaked, the skin growing puffy and patched with pink, yet still he moaned like a greedy whore as he gagged himself again and again on the tentacle’s thick, curved length.
“Well-spotted.”
He took a deep breath.
“This was inside you?” John said. Even he could hear the desire in his voice, deep as the sea, so of course Sherlock could hear it as well.
“Fuck.” John’s arm was flying now, grinding the Fleshlight into his pubic bone on every downwards stroke and slipping off on the occasional upwards one.
how wet she was: the rhythmic
All he said, however, was “All right,” and then he took Sherlock’s money and left, feeling more cheerful than he had in years.
But Sherlock wasn’t meant to be Sherlock now, was he? He was a puppy; John was his owner. That was the game that John was evidently intent on playing.
Of course, he’d asked himself the same question about the Army more than once while he was in Afghanistan, and he didn’t regret that at all.
It was glorious. His arse so wet and full, John’s grasp so hot and firm. The tail swung behind him like a pendulum, brushing his arse cheeks and the backs of his thighs. His collar jingled ceaselessly, loud enough that Sherlock could hardly even hear his own breathless moans.
9:35 p.m.
You’re the genius, you tell me. ;)
He didn’t think he looked too worse for wear today, but Sherlock could probably see it. Read it in the wrinkles in his trousers or something.
“Okay. I can do that. I just… wanted to be sure you were all right.” Still smiling, John bends forwards and presses a kiss to Sherlock’s forehead, then nuzzles his fringe so sweetly that affection floods Sherlock’s body, as fast-acting and potent as cyanide. “You’re doing so well, by the way. You didn’t move at all while I cut you.”
Sherlock’s coat, stuck between their bodies, fluttered suddenly free and fell on either side of her, covering both her and Sherlock like a quilt, trapping their body heat inside until it felt like John was in a bloody sauna. Sweat beaded on her forehead and dripped down her temples. Her fingers scrabbled against the wall for purchase while Sherlock fucked her hard enough that she could
First, though, Mrs Hudson needed to tend to the scratches on her hands, which had puffed up and begun to throb. She dropped the miniature deerstalker onto the sofa arm on her way to the bathroom, where she cleaned the wounds and covered them with a few plasters.
He considered adding something else—an insincere apology? an admission that he might’ve stayed longer to wait but hadn’t wanted to?—but nothing seemed appropriate. He clicked the send button.
We could play Diggy Hole again I suppose. Only, does that not sound like it might be a maybe not so good idea to you?
for littles. That wasn’t meant to be, I dunno, a hint, maybe?”
Sherlock scoffed. “Oh please.” He rolled his eyes and carried on.
Beside him, John jolts from stage one again, but this time instead of returning to it, he rolls to his back and blinks at the ceiling.
And he did, rather intimately. He remembered all too well squinting at Sherlock’s form on the roof of Bart’s, icy fear gripping his heart and freezing him all the way to his toes when he saw the glint of the knife in the sunlight. And then: Sherlock’s bloodied head on the pavement and his body a short distance away, or what had seemed to be Sherlock’s anyway. John would have done anything in that moment—and any moment in the next two years that followed, really—to save him, whether Sherlock wanted it or not.
The house was silent and had been since he’d got back from Baker Street. For several minutes, he listened to the quiet, watching Rosie, counting his own breaths to avoid thinking too hard about…anything, really.
Sherlock knelt too, except instead of helping to soothe Rosie, he was peering at John. Then he leaned closer and rested his hand on John’s upper arm. John still wore his coat from the trip over, and had two more layers under it besides, but he swore he could feel the warmth of Sherlock’s touch through it all.
Sherlock couldn’t help but correct him. “Didn’t
Sherlock was gasping now, both his hands curled into fists against his thighs. Trying not to touch himself even as his head filled with images of John moaning, John fucking himself, John wanting it so badly he gnashed his teeth and whimpered into his pillow.
“What’s your father like?” Sherlock suddenly asks and she frowns.
he didn’t know until that very moment. Why he never bothered to find out, when the man across from him had hunted down his bloody birth certificate. Sherlock had wanted to know everything there was to know about John. And John - well. John had just wanted to bask in a presence he ultimately took for granted.
“You okay?”
He huffs out an unamused laugh. “If you call this ‘well,’ I’d hate to see what the alternative is.”
But it was too late then. And it’s too late now.
John remembered thinking at the time.
He closes his eyes and waits, because he knows he won’t have to wait long. Not with the way Mullens drives. Sure enough, he hears the distant murmur of voices from downstairs followed by Gregory Lestrade’s steady tread on the steps, and he braces himself for whatever is about to walk through that door.
Two peas in an emotionally constipated pod.
“I didn’t get to his bedroom,” he says, anxiously shifting his weight from foot to foot. It’s not a gesture Greg thinks he’s ever seen Sherlock make.
Lestrade clears his throat, digging around in his pocket and pulling out something small enough to fit in his palm. A chain dangles from his fingers, a red flower catching the light from the corner.
She’s silent for a moment, a twitch in the corner of her mouth the only evidence that his words have affected her. “Then you better send this message so he can come rescue his damsel in distress.”
After God knows how many years he’s spent chasing after the two of them, he knows his place. He knows where he falls in the scheme of things.
He sees the curtain flutter in the front window and he holds his breath as he glances in the car. “I think we’re about to find out.” He closes the door and begins to make his way up the walk as his brother’s voice bellows across the tidy garden:
“I’m on my way,” he clips.
Mycroft honestly wouldn’t blame the detective for still grappling with it. He still does, on his off days. And yes, he does have them, not that he’ll ever admit that to anyone. As his brother is only too eager to point out, he has a reputation to maintain.
He steps forward, well aware that Mrs. Hudson watches him like a hawk, waiting for him to bungle this Very Important Moment, and he opens his arms, ready for judgment.
“Wait - Didn’t you two look at it together?” Lestrade frowns and looks at Mycroft for confirmation. As if Mycroft has ever had any control over what Sherlock Holmes and John Watson do.
“Where’s Mummy?”
It’s the first of two of the most draining conversations he has that day (
Mycroft watches Sherlock watch her go and he feels like he should offer some sort of brotherly comfort, but then again, that’s never been their forte.
“You were right. He wasn’t happy.”
“What can I do?” he finally rasped. “Tell me what I can do. How do I make this right?”
She pats his cheek, like she did to Sherlock when she first clapped eyes on him, and Mycroft startles enough that he sucks in a breath. He’s not sure he realized how touch-starved he was until this moment.
The street is still cordoned off, but an agent waves them through. That’s it for fanfare, though. You’d never know a man was abducted from here that very morning. Greg pulls up outside the flat and puts the car in park, opening the door and stepping out onto the street.
She never went exploring again.
How like her father she is.
Sherlock nods and scrubs his hands over his face, wincing as he adjusts his knee.
“What now?” Sherlock barks in greeting, and Mycroft closes his eyes and wills himself to have patience.
“Time to come out of retirement, baby brother.”
“I assume Rosie has your mobile?”
Sherlock sniffs and abruptly turns as Greg lifts his arms, conveying a general sense of
“Yeah? I need to do this for me, Rosie. I need to know you’re safe.”
She nods, but then pauses. “Daddy usually tucks me in.”
“With her friends, probably,” he replies distractedly, giving the post a cursory glance.
Mycroft sighs. It can only mean one thing meant for only one person. “Detective Inspector, I’m afraid there’s a lot you’ve not been privy to.”
“Well go ahead,” Nana says to Sherlock who hesitates in the foyer. Then she reaches up and runs her free hand through his hair, gently cupping his cheek. And for the first time since Rosie’s known him, Sherlock looks like he might cry.
She always thought of her house as the safest place in the world. It’s where they built blanket forts and had movie nights and dessert before dinner on evenings when Mummy was out with her friends. But she’s never seen her street so quiet. Even when the Robertsons had their domestic down the block, the road was full of police cars and flashing lights. Now it looks like that zombie show she accidentally saw on the telly before Daddy came in and switched it off. Still gave her nightmares for weeks.
“Sherlock,” she says without fanfare. Then she holds out the phone again and shakes it, as if she hasn’t just asked for the impossible. “Call for him. A little video message. You know you’re the only one he comes for.”
Perhaps it had just fallen off the nail.
“Funnily enough, it doesn’t.”
“Do I have a choice?”
“I have John Watson’s daughter in a bedroom upstairs and a little brother who is not emotionally equipped to deal with what is happening right now,” he snaps, patience wearing thin. “Just - will you come?” It might be the closest Greg ever gets to hearing Mycroft Holmes beg.
She thinks of her father and that something sharp hits her in her chest again, causing her to gasp. The lady, Anthea, glances down at her in concern, but she turns away, blinking her eyes quickly and willing herself not to cry.
Greg stares, and then stares some more, wondering if it’s a prerequisite to be able to deliver news like that in such a matter of fact, almost bored tone to get to where Mycroft’s gotten.
Sherlock reached behind and spread his cheeks, so that John’s next smack landed on the base of the tail directly. He could
Of course he hasn’t. Given his heartfelt mantra of “I’m not gay,” he hasn’t felt even the desire. Until now, of course. He wants Sherlock—and the significance of that has not escaped Sherlock.
“...”
Sherlock sighed and looked to the ceiling as though praying for patience. “We’re both clean, and neither of us minds a mess. We don’t need condoms.”
Sherlock stood, dimly aware that his chair was being thrown backwards from the movement and clattering to the floor. He cleared his throat. Clutching the can, John jerked upright, startled. Sherlock couldn’t meet his eye. If he did, he would flush crimson; it would be disgustingly obvious where his mind had wandered.
Which is, Sherlock realises abruptly and no doubt belatedly, the true crux of the matter.
“Hurry up,” Sherlock snapped. Her mouth was glistening with saliva and wetness, and there was a whitish smear on her chin. “Get yourself off and then
<JohnHWatson> I’ve just said something stupid haven’t I?
“So,” he continues, ensuring that no matter how undignified his appearance, his spine is straight and his shoulders squared, “skipping to the part where you get on with it and tell me why you’re here….”
More than, Sherlock suspected, if he were bothering to monitor the hours, minutes, and seconds that had passed since he’d discovered the ring. Fortunately, he hadn’t yet progressed to such a level of histrionics.
Immediately after the photo was sent, he took another: this one with the ears on as well as the collar. He lay flat on his back, holding his phone an arm’s length above him, and snapped rapidly until he had a shot in which he looked suitably needy: his eyes half-lidded and unfocused, his lips wet and red, his spine arched slightly.
Like something small and light drumming against the wall in the corridor. It sounded again, closer this time.
“C’mon,” John said, tugging gently. “We’re meant to be shopping together, yeah?”
Something gripped his nape. Icy, but sharp enough to burn, like he was being clawed. He hissed and ducked, curling himself around Rosie’s small frame, thinking fiercely,
Ridiculous, perhaps, how satisfying it is to hear, but Sherlock hardly cares. He moans softly, happily, and closes his eyes again when John eventually draws back and returns to Sherlock’s hip.
“Oh god,” John groaned. His head dropped, mashing his face into the duvet. His next cry was muffled. “Oh fuck.”
To his surprise, the sleep fog began to dissipate quickly and was replaced with a fierce, all-consuming thirst. His mouth was so dry his tongue was like paper and the walls of his oesophagus felt as though they’d shrivelled and collapsed. He couldn’t even swallow.
Quite literally, in fact. The pulsing in Sherlock’s groin had grown so strong it toed the line between pleasure and pain, edging closer and closer to the latter as the seconds passed.
Sherlock responded with another soft moan, which became a long string of moans as John continued to get him open and wet. When he was finished, John pulled his fingers out and, on a whim, wiped them across Sherlock’s chest, making the stretches of bare skin between the rope gooey and sticky. True to John’s fantasy.
. The thought bobbed suddenly above the rest, and Sherlock rolled to the side and reached for his mobile.
Sherlock caught and held John’s gaze, ensuring that John understood the weight and truth of his words when he said, “It’s
It’s both a blessing and a curse, John’s ignorance. John will never understand that, with three words a matter of years ago, he singlehandedly made Sherlock Holmes—just as, with five words a matter of weeks ago, he singlehandedly wrecked Sherlock Holmes. That John could show up on his doorstep with three daughters, a stray cat, a dying dog, and the rotting corpse of the Prime Minister, and Sherlock would offer his home, his resources, his protection without hesitation.
Today, though, Mrs Hudson winds up in the kitchen with John, nattering on about telly and politics, while Molly sits in the living room with Rosie and Sherlock settles with his phone in his own armchair across from her.
“Mm. So you don’t remember trying to kiss me and then coming in your pants when I pulled at your hair?”
“Of course,” he says. Although panic still buzzes in his thoughts, his voice is calm, composed. “If anything, our history gives us an advantage. We’re flatmates—I know the worst of you, and you of me.”
“What? Of course they fit me.”
“Yeah,” John said, “and if you honestly think I wouldn’t have done the same, you’re an idiot.”
Sherlock’s expression was so fond it made John want to squirm. “Yes,” he said, sounding deeply pleased, “and you observed. No, it isn’t mine. It’s… Lestrade’s, possibly.” Finally, he returned his focus to the folder and opened it.
“Shot him twice in the chest. Not sure why that made bits of him fly all over the place though.”
I’m really not uncomfortable. Obviously I’d be a bloody hypocrite if I was. It’s fine, it’s all fine.
“Ta,” said John, “but I’ve just had coffee and a fry-up downstairs, so… not really interested just now.”
She was sitting up in her cot, staring off to the left with her eyes and mouth wide in something like awe. Then she turned to John, who was panting and dread-frozen with his hand still on the doorknob. She smiled. Sunny, oblivious. Vulnerable.
And then it’s wet, the tip of John’s tongue brushing curiously against his, and consequently distinctly less enjoyable than the previous kiss. The taste of another person’s mouth, another person’s saliva mixing with his own, the transfer of bacteria from one wet environment to other, Sherlock dislikes it immensely. It feels uncomfortable. Claustrophobic.
Sorry. I’m really not trying to lead you on or give mixed signals.
John raised an eyebrow, at first wondering if he’d misheard, but when Sherlock blanched, looking as though he might sick up all over his heavenly bedsheets, John realised he hadn’t.
“Oh, right,” says John, his eyes widening in surprise. “That’s… good.”
Afterwards, Sherlock was in a foul, foul mood. He hunched and glowered and scowled, gnashed his teeth at regular intervals, and occasionally let out a long, disgusted groan and swiped and tugged at his hair like it was the source of his frustration. There might as well have been a storm cloud above him, complete with rolling thunder and ominous flares of lightning.
he tells himself.
His eyes are open, his head tipped back, so he can stare up at Sherlock. Sherlock can see his dilated pupils, how John’s eyelids droop when Sherlock’s prick sinks deep enough that John’s oesophagus struggles to accommodate its girth. Sherlock can see that as well, the column of John’s throat expanding, and he could feel it too if he wanted, but he’s content enough to simply watch.
Sherlock stared, spellbound. Condoms and tissues open (ripped open, indicating impatience), lubricant only three-quarters full (sticky sheen on the label, indicating spillage), toy lying on its side (lack of dust clinging to the silicone, indicating recent cleaning).
“Touch me,” he pleads, and it’s only partly affectation now. He wants it: the irresistible burn of orgasm, the stink of John’s ejaculate on his skin. “For god’s sake, John, please touch me.”
When there was no response, he pounded again and listened closely, leaning towards the door so he could hear the knock echoing faintly inside. Maybe no one was home.
John leaned into him, his side against Sherlock’s shoulder. “I talked to Greg a bit the other day. His team’s at a dead end.”
Sherlock let the phone drop to the floor, relishing the vicious thud it made as wood and plastic connected.
“Ah,” he says. His mouth is open, but nothing else will come.

“How the hell did you manage this?” John says.
“No!” Sherlock said. His head snapped up, and he stared at John with a mixture of alarm, disappointment, and indignation. “No, John, don’t—”
He wants more. He wants more so badly he knows he should be ashamed of it, the way his arse clenches as he remembers how Sherlock felt in him, fucking him as though John’s entire purpose were simply to stand here and take it.
His throat, so full, tightened in the beginnings of a gag. He exaggerated it, added a heartfelt sniffle, and allowed a few tears to well in his eyes. He felt a flash of triumph—and a pulse of arousal—when John’s whole body shuddered and his mouth opened around a blissful cry.
“You’re still interested, then?”
All the tripe about honesty and trust and respect, and if he has to listen to John’s verbal rendition of it, he doesn’t know what he’ll be reduced to.
Sherlock does want. Quite badly, as it happens. It’s utterly unprecedented, but at the moment he doesn’t want to spare the mental energy required to be surprised about that.
While John watched, confused and embarrassed, the waitress appeared and began to clear the table. Just as Sherlock had claimed, she didn’t seem at all bothered by the spectacle Sherlock was making. Without a word, she gathered their plates and left.
The seed was planted. It would grow.
“Er,” said John. “Okay.” He thought about the hazards of frequent international travel, about everything he knew of Sherlock and his cases, about every news article highlighting medical oddities he’d read in recent months. “Does he have allergies, by chance?”
“You’d best mark it on your spreadsheet then.”
John realised only after he’d spoken how like a cheesy come-on it was, and judging by the way Sherlock’s eyes widened, he realised it too.
, he’ll be taking much more of an interest in your personal safety. As you can probably imagine, he thinks poorly of my competence as a sire to a newly turned child.”
