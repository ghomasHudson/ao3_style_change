"Well," he chuckled, "William is my religious name, that's right -. I was baptized, however, with the name of Sherlock"
I shook my head slowly.
"Always a pleasure to see you, Doctor," he mumbled, trying to free himself from my grasp, which only made me pound his head again against the pale plaster. It left a dark red blood stain.
John heard Mycroft sigh again. “Very well,” he said then the line went silent, leaving John staring blankly at his silent phone.
Sherlock dialed Mycroft’s number. He rubbed his eyes with one hand as he waited for his brother to pick up. At last Mycroft’s bored tone drawled, “Hello?”
A heavy sigh left John’s lips as his shoulders slumped. He realized he hadn’t eaten in hours and his stomach rumbled when he smelled the fragrant steam coming from the coffee maker.  He opened the fridge and took out an already-prepared, plated meal. He popped it in the microwave to heat while he poured coffee and added milk. When the microwave chimed, he took the plate and mug to the living room.
“Hello, John. Did you come for me, too?”
"Apple blossom honey. Very delicate and guaranteed organic - the trees grow in a monastery in southern England. "
What?
"Yes, I stayed."
He pushed his lower lip out petulantly, reminding me a little of a defiant child.
"Even better!"
"As long as your condition doesn’t get worse, you won’t need to. But you must be careful and rest. "
It felt strange to me that the monks' lives went on as they had before the treacherous attack on Sherlock, the false accusations against Jonah, and the unmasking of the murderous novice Francis; no one seemed willing to discuss it. Francis’ disappearance was apparently simply accepted and not further remarked on, although I was sure that everyone in the monastery knew exactly what had happened.
I sat down in my usual place in one of the front rows and watched the monks’ entry into the choir. The calm and peace that came from this familiar sight also brought my own frightened spirit back to what was important. Even Brother William was now completely serious and focused on the fact that he was here to serve God.
Hands still clasped tightly, they followed Lestrade to the kerb where a cab waited behind Lestrade’s car. They exchanged a few more words with the DI then settled into the cab for the ride back to Baker Street - back
"As long as I can rely on your silence I have no reason to regret it."
Sherlock discusses his encounter at the restaurant with his brother. They both realize that John has not had the full picture the past two years.
I nodded politely.
"But why not?"
Despite the obvious pain he felt, he shook his head.
“I started last week,” Sherlock replied in a flat American accent. He shrugged.
That was enough of an incentive; I would peel him out of this completely unnecessary cloth as fast as I could - if only I could find out how! As if he had already counted on my ignorance of religious clothing, he turned a bit to the side and revealed a zipper on the back of the white robe. Well, in contrast to the long button placket, that was quite handy! When finally this last piece of clothing lay at his feet, I paused to just look at him.
“I’ve got boots.”
"You hardly hear the noise."
Sniffling turned to hiccoughing, the sound of John trying to suppress tears. Sherlock’s chest felt like it was cracking in two, the pain of knowing his husband - John - was in distress as great as the pain of knowing that John would not welcome comfort from Sherlock. Releasing his curls, Sherlock wrapped his arms around his folded-up legs and rocked forward-and-back in agony. His hands grasped tightly together to keep him from springing from the bed and rushing up the stairs.
My faith had often helped me, especially in Afghanistan ... if  shots cracked around you and bombs detonated in close proximity, it could be immensely comforting to hope that somewhere, someone was holding a protective hand over you and over your squadron. As I lay there in the glowing desert sand and felt my life fading with every drop of blood dripping from my body, I had prayed for the first time in years. I begged the God whom I had ignored for so long to let me live and not to let me die in the middle of nowhere without a soul at my side. And He had heard me. My comrades had found me in time and had brought me to the relative safety of the hospital, where surgery was performed on me and I was drugged up to the eyeballs with antibiotics to counteract the onset of sepsis and, after two weeks, flown back home. The wound itself was not fatal, but the massive blood loss was hard on my body. The two weeks immediately after my injury are dim in my memory to this day; my knowledge about this period came mainly from the other soldiers’ stories and the treating physicians’ reports. I knew that my life would never be the same again; yet I was grateful to have escaped without lasting damage.
"Because I have to talk to you. Unobserved."
important.”
They’d never had the type of relationship that depended on endearments, pretty words or declarations of affection. His relationship with Sherlock had been man-to-man, based on shared excitement, adrenaline and passionate sex. Afterward there had been tender moments, holding each other while they slept, whispered “I love you” and “me too.” But they’d never rhapsodized on their affections – nothing close to what Sherlock’s note held.
makes dinner. Without asking anyone else what they want!”
Harry gave him a sympathetic look. “Aw, John, I’m sorry. It hurts, doesn’t it?”
Sherlock moaned and buried his face in John’s neck, panting hot against John’s sweat-damp skin.  “Give me your hand,” he gasped. John licked his palm and threaded it between their bodies to capture Sherlock’s rock-hard cock. Sherlock’s skin felt hot and dry, distended over the thick vein that ran the length of his cock, and he shuddered violently when John stroked down the hot length. Taking a moment to readjust his hips to line up his own aching erection with Sherlock’s, John stretched his fist to accommodate the girth of the two of them together. Sherlock jerked like he’d touched a live wire then snapped his hips into John’s fist faster and faster, making little ‘aha’ sounds with each exhale until he shuddered and came, scorching John’s belly with his release.
A tear slipped from his eye, rippled over the crows feet at the corner and slid into his iron-grey curls. He wiped at his temple with the back of a weathered hand. He wasn’t going to get maudlin over everyone he’d ever  lost. And loved. Loved and lost - he could allow himself to think it now. He’d loved Mrs. Hudson like a surrogate mother. Her absence left an aching hole in his heart these many years later.
Remorse crept over me as I walked through the garden at dusk, past the apple trees, which were now almost completely harvested, and the flowers, whose blooms slowly faded to be replaced by colorful autumn leaves. The cool evening air penetrated my bones, making me shiver but when I finally reached my destination, I felt warm immediately. The outer wall and the trees with their low-hanging branches offered the hives a little protection from the weather and in spite of the advanced season one or two bees were still visible in the air. The same meditative calm that had seized me while working among the hives with William captured me again now as I pulled the protective gear out of the shed. I put it on and started to provide the bees with nutrient solution. I would take care of his tiny animals until William could do it himself again. It seemed like a deal with a higher power: If I could make sure none of his bees died, then William would stay alive too. It was a completely absurd thought but at the moment it was the only thing that kept me from going crazy with fear.
"The two seemed like secret agents or something ... like out of a bad movie. I never learned who they were and I'm honestly not keen to know. "
"Yes. And I am very happy about it, although it was a bit strange at the beginning when he took his vow of silence. "
“Good god, John. Did you not actually spend days reading my letters or are you too dull to pick up on what I so obviously stated?
I furiously slammed my fist on the window sill to silence the voice.
I gave him a quick nod and then, with drooping shoulders, proceeded to Sherlock's hospital room. Just before I could press the latch, Mycroft called me back again.
"They didn’t smuggle in Francis - one of them told him about Jonah and me, probably knowing his hatred for gays. And then they just had to wait. But they didn’t have the opportunity to send a replacement for him after Francis was caught. "
He dreaded what he might find in the file. It could blow his simple, easy, uncomplicated life to bits. But he had to know. He couldn’t survive on this anger forever. It took too much energy to stay this mad. He knew that he’d eventually soften toward Sherlock and hated to think of the implication that softening would have to he and Mary.
"We finally had to make him aware of my presence here and keep Jonah safe while I was in France," Sherlock signed.
Breathless, I stared at Brother William. If there had been a mirror in the room, I would probably have seen a man with reddened skin, dilated pupils, and trembling lips. I was dizzy and I had to lean against the cabinet behind me to pick up courage again - as inconspicuously as possible. The friar, however, did not seem to be finished with me. He had also leaned against a dresser, his arms crossed in front of his chest, and looked at me defiantly, his lips pulled up slightly in a mischievous smile. He raised his eyebrows and fixed me with his gaze, tilting his head slightly, as if he were expecting me to say something. I broke out in sweat and wiped one hand across my forehead and back through my hair restlessly. I cleared my throat, turned my eyes away and tapped non-existing lints from my sweater. The monk still stared at me, kept me in suspense a while longer - it seemed like hours - and then finally turned away. I could not see what he was doing, but I realised it as he turned back to me. He held the clay pot into which we had previously filled the honey and presented it to me like a precious treasure.
“My fucking god, you’re gorgeous,” John rumbled. “Look how badly you want me to fuck you.”
"You do not have to apologize to me," I replied, glancing up at the tall man, "Things are the way they are - and I'm grateful if I can at least be of some use after being welcomed here so warmly. But I can not understand why Jonah was put under arrest. "
Looking at me with wide eyes, he sat down again and gestured to the seat to his right.
He looked extremely nervous, which was quite understandable in view of the previously allegations against him. But would the brothers actually be guided in their decision by the events of the last days and take this as an opportunity to refuse him full admission to the Order? I could only hope with him that this would not be the case.
"I understand that pretty well."
"Not here anymore."
"And now you want to go because these thoughts and feelings confuse you, because they’re disturbing you don’t feel able to handle them. Believe me, I fully understand, I went through this, too, when I came here. I even went to the Prior’s office after a few weeks with packed suitcases after two days and told him with great conviction that the monastic life didn’t suit me and I wanted to go home. "
It doesnt matter to either of them - those things are hard for both of them to express. Not having to mark a red-letter day on the calendar is a relief to both men.
Eyes closed, John drew in two long breaths through his nose. His lips were pressed into a line so flat, Sherlock could no longer see any of the smooth mauve lips he loved. John opened his eyes and  stalked into the living room, stopping in front of Sherlock. “You are Sherlock Holmes, Consulting Detective. You aren’t just a man any longer. Sherlock Holmes is a
"Sherlock. But he belongs to a monastic order, so it could be that he registered under his religious name. William. "
"I knew it. You've been following me! Who do you think you are? "
"But the Prior will not let him go to the hospital."
When he looked up, I was startled. His face was terribly pale, and had he had such dark circles under his eyes this morning?
"Jonah, why are you still here? He desperately needs medical help! "
"Is that real?" I asked, shocked. I had seen human skulls more than once - and this one looked damn real.
When he got the results, John was devastated. It was a certain impossiblility for the baby his wife carried to be his. While he’d seen miracle healing, John didn’t believe in true miracles - and it would have been a miracle for him to get his wife pregnant.
form of endearment, because they had unshakable respect for each other. The joy in each other’s company, even if all they did of an evening was sit in front of the fireplace and read silently. Relating – really
In disbelief, I stared at the young man, who, however, was very eager to change the subject.
Sherlock holds his breath. A lot. John begins to notice little gaps-in-breathing in his partner more and more. Not wanting to be too intrusive, but concerned that Sherlock may have an undiagnosed medical condition causing his system to misfire, John brings it up casually over breakfast one morning.
"What does that mean?"
"Well, that was probably not a very intelligent thing to say in the face of his vow, but I already knew him as a very calm and self-contained man when he came to us a year ago. He decided to take this vow very quickly, because he wanted to concentrate fully on his relationship with God - and some people can do it best if they are not distracted by conversations. "
"I want to look after Brother Jonah again," I explained my abrupt disappearance and received some glances. Greetings and blessings were given to me on my way out, then I headed in the direction of the sick-room.
Now it was up to me to clarify some things.
John smiled fondly. “OK, it’s in the front pocket of my bag under the seat. If you can’t fall asleep just help yourself.” John closed his eyes and laid his head on Sherlock’s shoulder. The book remained closed in his lap.
"Is beautiful. Should you take a look. "
It took me more than half an hour to find him in the garden. Without the help of an older brother, I would never have recognized him for his face was completely hidden by a beekeeper's hat while he worked on the beehives. White smoke rose from the beekeeper's whistle which stuck between his lips and enclosed him like a cloud.
"What would you advise from a medical point of view?"
? Surely his broken ankle would be more comfortable in bed. Why would he spend time in the uncomfortable wooden chair when a large, soft bed was only a few feet away?
"He's not really a junkie, not anymore. Just a little bit ... down on his luck. I thought you had sympathy for folks like him! "
Carlos leaned over and sucked the drink stirrer. He drained half the glass then swallowed. “Drink up, Sammy boy.” Sherlock did, quickly finishing what remained in the glass. He sat the empty glass on the bar and followed Carlos to the dance floor, threading through the heavy crowd of sweating bodies. Sherlock raised his arms over his head and swayed his hips to the music, undulating in time to the throb of the bass and beat of the drum machine. Carlos danced close into Sherlock’s personal space and rubbed their bodies together. Sherlock wanted to roll his eyes at the clumsy move; instead he put on a blissful expression and smiled. He pressed his chest to Carlos’ then slipped around until he was behind the other man, chest to back. Carlos thrust his arse back into Sherlock’s crotch and wiggled his hips. This time Sherlock didn’t have to stifle the impulse to roll his eyes. He placed both hands on Carlos’ hips and ground into him, swaying back and forth in wide arcs. Carlos responded eagerly, swaying and rolling his hips. Sherlock slipped both hands between them, cupping Carlos’ buttocks and squeezing. At last he had the opportunity for which he’d started this farce of a flirtation - he slipped his right hand into Carlos’ back pocket and slid out the wallet he found there, quickly sliding it into his jacket pocket.
was I supposed to get messages? Bottles in the Thames?”
John shouldered the door shut while juggling his keys and two takeaway bags. Mrs. Hudson’s door stood half open as if she’d been waiting for his arrival. Just as his foot hit the first stair, his landlady poked her head out into the foyer.
, John.” Mary’s casual tone of voice, paired with the twinkle of good humor in her eyes, were a bizarre contrast to the matte black and gleaming silver of the gun in her hand.
Sherlock tried to relax. He concentrated on the wonderful warmth, the cozy weight of John’s head resting on his shoulder, the faint herbal smell of shampoo in John’s hair. He dropped his head, lightly rubbing John’s crown with his cheek.
On the third day, John began to feel a swelling in his bollocks. By night the pain was unbearable and John’s doctors stood by helpless while John’s body fought the rare complication of adult Chickenpox: testicular infection.
"No, you didn’t," I answered softly, because at the moment I simply lacked the strength to focus on the appropriate signs.
"That's right."
However, I had no time to think about this any longer because as soon as I parked my car in the monastery’s visitor parking lot, I saw a face at the gate I knew all too well. With weak knees I got out, walked over and stopped in front of the gray-haired man who had his hands folded over his chest and looked at me over the rim of his glasses.
want to ..."
“That’s hideous take it off.”
"I loved this book as a kid, and even as an adult, I read it a lot - I think he'll like it. And please greet him warmly from me. I'll see you at breakfast!" He called to me as he disappeared around the corner.
The pattern becomes clear to John after a few days. Sherlock holds his breath when he’s concentrating very hard. Not for normal Mind Palace storage and retrieval - breath-holding is reserved for seriously hard thinking. It soothes John’s concerns when he makes the connection. He knows there’s nothing medically the matter - it’s simply Sherlock’s way of cutting out every distraction. That includes the sound of his own breath in his nose and the sensation of his chest rising and falling. It’s Sherlock’s way of going very, very still.
I saluted jokingly.
"What do you have to offer?"
"There is a drug trafficking ring that usually operates from Northern Ireland and has its fingers in all sorts of dirty deals throughout the United Kingdom. These people are known to threaten people who are able to testify against their gang by sending orange pips and then clear them out of the way. So - is there something you want to tell me? "
"I guess you're wrong."
"Oh my god ....", I breathed, so overwhelmed that tears came to my eyes.
"I have to hang up," I mumbled, dropping the phone on the receiver, only to walk up the stairs to the fifth floor seconds later. Even the time I would have spent waiting for the elevator seemed too precious at the moment. Panting and sweating, I came to a stop in front of a nurse who was on duty in front of the entrance to the intensive care unit.
Traveling aches
Sherlock? Did Sherlock think he was writing only for his own benefit? “Of course. I’m writing them for you. About you, about me. About the time you were ... away.”
The blond took a quick look at it, then put the letter aside. "I have no relatives, my friends would not address their mail to 'Brother Jonah' and my birthday is  only next week. I’ll take a look at it later, now I have to beat the great champion here in chess. "
"No! I'm not going to hospital! I don’t want to!"
The young monk seemed surprised that I had remained in the room, unlike the others. I pulled up a chair and sat down beside his bed. He suddenly looked much younger after Brother Elijah had helped him to take off his black scapular, and he was only wearing a white tunic that otherwise was hidden underneath. He looked at me questioningly from weary eyes.
just no emotional entanglements, God forbid! You are so ridiculous, John ... "
left kudos on this work!
Bobbing my head, I turned around too fast, as if Brother Jonah had caught me doing something forbidden. He reacted casually, leaning in the doorway with his arms crossed over his chest and shaking his head.
"Who did he want to protect you from? You said the parties were all arrested and sentenced ... "
Sherlock tipped his head back on the pillow and smiled softly. “Morning,” he whispered.
do this to
I shook my head and pulled him into my arms.
Brother Francis, who always sat next to me at the dinner table, seemed to share my concern. "I’ve never seen him like this at all," he murmured, glancing after Jonah, who had just pulled the door closed behind him.
“Sherlock, you are
“Why?”
What Sherlock did know was that John, his partner, his lover, his reason for living, his reason for jumping, was marrying someone else. A woman. A beautiful, seemingly kind woman named Mary. He also knew that John was furious with him, had assaulted him three times in an hour and then stormed off.
"Keep out of things that aren’t your business, Doctor."
"I don’t want to throw you out, Doctor Watson."
And after? After, John remembers who he is. He leads his exhausted lover to the ensuite, seats him on the closed toilet lid, and tenderly shaves his precious face.
The first day back in my 'old' life was strange, but not as bad as I had feared. My colleagues asked me curious questions about my time in the monastery that I answered as neutrally as possible. I didn’t share that I’d  fallen in love with an alleged monk who actually returned my feelings. Otherwise, not much had changed, except maybe that I - the rhythm of the friars’ days still in the blood - volunteered for the otherwise generally unpopular night shifts. My surroundings were the same as before my time off but I felt that I had become a different person.
So formal, so
"Yes, down the hall, behind the administrative offices. I'll get a key. "
Saul answered before Sherlock could open his mouth. “Frank said to feed this kid and put him to work. I found him sleeping in one of the trucks this morning. Broke into the yard last night.”
And Mary, the woman who was still a total stranger to Sherlock, had offered to “talk him around.”
Mycroft’s tone actually softened a bit. “I am sorry, but you see, John, based on your past behavior, I did indeed believe you’d grown tired of waiting. The string of girlfriends, the ease at which you’d
John was silent for a long time. Finally Sherlock prompted softly, “And then?”
"It’s alright," I reassured him, got up and went over to the cupboards on the wall. The usual remedies were available and so I found what I searched for quickly. I sat down on the bedside, opened the large orange plastic box, and shook out two small white tablets, which I handed the novice along with the water glass.
Prior Lambert shook his head and interrupted my laborious attempts to explain.
John woke the next morning with a feeling of conviction. He knew the course he needed to take:  gently end it with Mary; apologize to Sherlock; move back to Baker Street; spend the rest of his life trying to make it up to Sherlock how he’d acted since Sherlock returned.
"I asked a few days ago, the nearest hospital is about twenty minutes away from here. It won’t be too long until someone is here ... just hold on, you've made it so far," I said to him and was terrified by the sound of my own voice - as frightened as I sounded, I could not calm anyone! The young monk suddenly started mumbling to himself.
. The word lay between them, a nearly-physical presence on the table, spreading out and smothering the dishes with its gray-green-purple repulsiveness. Once spoken, it couldn’t be un-spoken. Once heard, it lived on and on. And now there it was, vibrating in the air of their flat, tainting everything in their home with its miasma.
"Yes, if it’s okay ...?"
Opening the site, John read over Sherlock’s last message. He exhaled sharply, thinking of the lash scars on Sherlock’s back that resulted from his capture by Moriarty's Serbian people. Sherlock had told him in the message about his injuries. How confused Sherlock must have been when John launched himself at him, knocking him to the ground on his injured back with all his weight. John swallowed the gorge that threatened to rise at the thought.
"Hi, um ..." I cleared my throat, uncertain. "Brother William, right?"
Neither he nor I then spoke a word so I got up and just wanted to say goodbye when the gray-haired man spoke to me again, his voice much softer this time  than before.
Sherlock nodded.
He took my left hand and placed it on the top button of his habit - and then just waited.
"If it’s so bad, then surely your fellow brothers know of your allergy, don’t they?"
"This is the refectory, where we take our meals. In silence. "
For so long, Sherlock had avoided even the most casual touch. He’d avoided John’s whiskey-foul kisses. He’d avoided their big bed, coming in late and either staying up through the night making notes for his latest choreography or falling asleep on the sofa with his mobile on his chest. And sex, when they bothered at all, was just a hurried
I nodded in agreement; I had not thought of that at all.
When those twinges of pining flared, Sherlock tamed them with work. Not the brainwork of his younger years but hard physical labor. The more his heart tried to betray him, the harder he worked his back and arms and legs. Along with active composting, he also tended a dozen hives at five different farms in addition to his own four hives at the back of the garden. The garden, his solace of hard work, where he turned the soil with a shovel instead of hiring a tractor to disk and plow. He planted and hoed and pruned with a vengeance, eschewing all chemical fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides, preferring to pick insects off his tender plants by hand.
"But we can never be completely sure."
He sounded so shocked - now that he knew
Carlos edged in between two other patrons and quickly caught the bartender’s attention. He turned back to Sherlock with two tall glasses in his hands. Sherlock took one and sipped. It was over sweet with a biting aftertaste - Seagrams and Seven. Instead of pulling the sour face he felt, Sherlock smiled up into Carlos’ eyes. “Delicious.”
Without removing his eyes or the gun from his former girlfriend, John fished in his trouser pocket for his phone. Just as he dialed 999 by feel alone, the kitchen door banged inward with a crash. Four uniformed police officers rushed in and surrounded the table. Throughout the pandemonium, even as he gained his feet, John’s hand never wavered as it held the gun on Mary.
Jonah ran his fingers through his hair and leaned against the door frame, exhausted.
After Compline I retired to my room to read a little - after dinner, I took a book from the common room, the "Spiritual Exercises" of Ignatius of Loyola. Not exactly light fare for an absolute beginner like me, but a return to my relationship with God had been my focus in the last hours of the day. And there was, finally, a large number of competent persons who could provide advice and support to me, if appropriate, in case  I stumbled on my way to self-awareness. In good spirits, I dropped on my bed, shoved the pillow in my back so I was comfortable and adjusted the bedside lamp so that the light fell on the pages of the book at a good angle, so that I did not have to contort myself. This time I would not go back to sleep before the night prayer. It was time to approach this challenge with the necessary seriousness ; I wanted to gain an advantage from my stay. And I was convinced that I was on the right track.
"I like to take care of them," Brother Elijah replied, "I've been stung a few times, but I like the little things."
Pink, raw, new
I began to think about the always-so-helpful novice; What might have been in the letter, and why had he tossed it aside without reading it? I had not noticed where he had stuck the envelope, but it was no longer lying on the table.
And John closed his eyes and shook his head again. Suddenly one dinner, one expensive bottle of wine, seemed a small gesture. Insignificant. There wasn’t anything he could reply - Sherlock was right. He heard Sherlock move and opened his eyes to watch Sherlock drop to his knees in front of him.
“Then why would you think he’d change while I was gone!”
John brought Sherlock’s hand to his lips and kissed his knuckles softly. “Nope. Today is good for me. Just making sure we won’t have to wait.”
Still shaking with mirth, Watson pulled Holmes’ ear level with his own mouth and whispered an explanation.
"Because I was convinced that you could hear me."
Where?
I sat down in one of the front benches and stared at the candle which, protected by blood-red glass, hung down from the ceiling in an elaborate gold frame, and cast the Lamb of God on the front of the tabernacle in a gentle light. The Eternal Light. Sign of the everlasting presence of God. Symbol of the Most Holy, concealed behind the closed door.
Shaking his head roughly, Sherlock finally spoke. “It’s not. Okay. She… the gun. She could have shot you.” He released his grip on his hair and lifted his face to meet John’s eyes. “And I just stood there. All I could do was make a call. And you had a gun pointed at your heart.”
, John. That’s
John nodded his head sideways toward Sherlock. “He’s been quite ill. Gunshot wound, lots of internal damage. Between work and taking care of him, I’ve kept busy.”
“Yes, Mrs. Hudson. I certainly do. I’ll just … Sherlock and I, we’ll. Um. The room upstairs …” John trailed off weakly, not really sure how to tell his eighty year old landlady that he and his lover would be sure to fuck somewhere else than over her head while she tried to sleep. He took another step up, holding up the takeout bags and nodding toward them. “This is hot and you know how Chinese is best eaten fresh. Goodnight, Mrs. Hudson!” Cheeks aflame, John ducked his head and nearly sprinted up the stairs.
He shrugged his shoulders indecisively . "Of course it’s difficult to be obedient if you notice that the superiors are obviously making stupid decisions..."
The older man looked as perplexed as I did.
He’d responded less and less to my texts until eventually, a month went by with no word from him.
"And Mycroft is sure that Jonah isn’t in danger now? And you?"
“Very well. I will send a car.”
When Mary suggested he move into her townhouse in the suburbs, he’d just gone along. It was the path of least resistance and maybe a little
Whatever the reason for it, John’s crisis now appeared to be over. Sherlock heard the faint squeak of bedsprings as John adjusted his position in the bed. Holding his breath for a few seconds, Sherlock could not detect any further sounds of distress.
Sherlock glanced down. Frank was, indeed, wearing steel-toed workboots. He drew a shaky breath and tried to summon the bravado he’d felt earlier. “My name is Bill. I’m here in Miami at a drug and alcohol clinic. My parents sent me here to get clean.” The waver in his voice embarrassed Sherlock but he couldn't seem to damp it down. Suddenly he felt very alone and very frightened. No one knew where he was - not his parents, not his meddling older brother, no friends; no one. “I signed myself out yesterday. My birthday, when I turned 18, they couldn't hold me any more. I wasn’t going to steal any of your equipment. I just wanted a place to sleep.”
"Did you tell anyone about it?" He asked tonelessly, without looking at me.
Realization dawned on Sherlock’s face and he nearly shouted, “No! John, its not … that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sundays are so dreadfully dull. I thought it might help pass the time.”
Sherlock turned in the doorway and faced John chest-to-chest. “My getting a haircut doesn’t endanger your income. Just stop. Now.”
"I had a wonderful time with Sherlock that I will never forget and he will always have a special place in my heart - but that's not the life that's meant for me. I belong here. Here, I’m happy. And I want Sherlock to be happy, too."
I had not seen him all morning and when I arrived at the door of the kitchen area at eleven o'clock, I could not see the slightest trace of my companion. Instead, there was an older brother with thinning hair, who seemed vaguely familiar to me and introduced himself as Brother Elijah.
The man's features relaxed and he smiled sympathetically.
"I think you need this more urgently than anyone else here."
, forgive the man. If he did, and went back it all, Sherlock would set him aflame, consume him; he would burn like a magnesium fire until there was nothing left of John Watson, and he’d be an extension of Sherlock once again. And oh god,
I rushed over to him, grabbed his arm and catched him by his sleeve.
"Thanks, too."
"How do you know?"
I nodded uncertainly, curious to see if he would say something more.
He scrolled up, skipping a few dozen messages. The dates were not consecutive this far back in the site. Sherlock had not posted every day – let alone three or four times a day as he’d done much later. John clicked a random file:
"How is your leg?"
!” John loomed over Sherlock as he shouted the last three words.
The man, who otherwise seemed so calm and relaxed, frowned.
“Yes, alright. I’m coming,” John babbled as he fitted together the events of the evening in his sleep-fuddled mind.
“No! I wasn’t joking. Do you want a blow job?’”
"Nothing. Just keeping in mind that things are not always what they seem at first sight. "
"If I find your door unlocked tonight, we'll talk. Until then, you would do well to equal me and practice silence."
"I heard you. Every word. And I wanted to show you that I heard you. I also heard what Francis said to me when he stood by my bed before you came in. Even today I hear his words in my mind. "
It gave Sherlock comfort to think of John sitting in his chair at Baker Street, checking the secure site before bed a few times a week. The longer Sherlock was away, the more he missed John and the more his posts revealed his feelings. As months stretched to years and his longing for John - and home - grew stronger, Sherlock poured his heart out to John frequently, until just before he was captured by the Serbians, he was posting several messages a day, telling John how he loved him, how he longed for him.
“But my phone! Surely you recorded the conversation!” Sherlock grasped at this slim hope. “Do you have the file? Can you give it to me?”
the consecrated host, then rose in one fluid motion and withdrew in silent prayer to the choir, I involuntarily held my breath and could not detach my eyes from his slender body. The question of whether occasional adventures in Afghanistan had only been 'a phase,' as Ella had claimed, now no longer seemed appropriate as I had not previously felt for any woman as I did for this young monk. Wasn’t that supposed to mean something?
Here's a lovely rendition of O Come O Come Emmanuel:
I glimpsed into the garden with the apple trees and for the first time I looked down consciously. I had been here for more than a week, and yet I had not even looked at what was on the other side of the window as I had only glanced at the part of the building on the opposite side: Facade of light stone that looked quite monotonous. I recalled the floorplan of the convent; only now did I notice that the rooms opposite my room had to be the cells of the friars. I tried to think back to the corridor which I had walked along with Brother Jonah when the migraine attack had struck him and which I, as a guest, wasn’t allowed to enter. We had come down from the novices’ seminar room in the attic, walked down a stone spiral staircase and then entered the corridor, which, from my window, was on the left; from there we had turned to the right and had entered the corridor reserved for the brothers as a private retreat. Brother Jonah's room was - I counted again in my mind - the fifth rooms on the left, on the side that was turned away from the courtyard. Brother William’s room had been diagonally opposite, a few meters away. It had to be the seventh room on the right side.
"You're not much help to me either," I grumbled in his direction, pulling a few random books off the shelf, flipping through them, then putting them back.
Sullen, I returned to the monastery and wandered aimlessly through the dimly lit corridors. The monks had probably just gathered in the common room or had retired to their rooms to read or rest for a while. There was an almost eerie silence and I would have preferred to also retire to the cozy room with the roaring log fire and enjoy the company of the other men, after doing so much on my own today, but just as I passed the doors to the library, I decided to look there again; maybe I could find out anything else inside.
"Everyone who hears him play for the first time reacts like that", the elderly monk who brought me here whispered, "Our brother William is a downright genius."
"You’ve got mail, it’s been at the door for two days. Aren’t you interested?"
I was glad when I closed the door behind me.
"All right. Now, would you actually come to class with me or do you prefer to be on your own today? "
But in the next breath, he’d admitted to himself he didn’t – he
Sherlock turned his back again. He didn’t want John to see the expression of grief he could control no longer.
“Turn over.”
"Yes, you. Are you looking for Sherlock Holmes? "
I regained my composure and reached for the rope around his waist.
"Yeah, obviously," I snorted bitterly. I had not wanted to talk about the subject, but now it took possession of me and I felt rancor rise in my throat.
Suddenly tired of the mountain of never-said things built up between them, John spoke without forethought. “Do you want a divorce?”
Calming my slightly-rapid breathing so I could listen intently, I heard Billy Wiggins and John exchange words at the door. Then a scuffle and finally John’s footsteps on the stairs. I held my breath as his footfalls rang on the bare wood floor, coming closer to the mattress where I lay hiding my face behind the hood.
"It's not up to you to judge. I can only advise you to stay away from him in the future.”
"John, what's up? I was told you were at the hospital ... "
Another tilt of Mycroft’s head encouraged John to go on. “And, if he’ll have me, I’ll move home. To Baker Street.”
“Doctor Watson, is it now? What happened to John? Hmmm, Mycroft?” John’s voice shook with rage.
"You need to indulge Brother Jonah, he's always worried about others. Sometimes too much."
It was not long before the emergency physician came in, who in wise foresight carried with him all the necessary supplies. The wound was sewn and then he checked Jonah's reflexes and his pupillary reaction.
I grimaced.
Suddenly it struck me that today was also Jonah's birthday - presumably, despite the latent threat, he would never have expected that his special day would take such a tragic course. I felt pity for him. But more than that, I pitied Brother William who was probably in hospital all alone and fighting for his life - I could only hope that he had not lost his battle.
.” John said in the lethally calm voice he used when especially upset. “Your brand.
A hint of unease tickled the back of John’s consciousness at Mycroft’s admission that he’d eavesdropped on his conversation with Mrs. Hudson.
All the years he’d hoped, and longed and wanted. Just wanted,
"I ... told you that it was William ..." He looked out of the big window as if in a dream and looked at the moon, which hung over the treetops and bathed everything in a silvery light, before he corrected himself with a gentle voice. "... that Sherlock was the one who helped the police bust the drug trafficking ring and bring those involved to justice. You asked me why he came to this monastery, though he knew we would meet here. "
, as he had called it, that it was himself. So I started talking about the disputes in our youth that had ultimately divided us and admitted to him that the relationship between us was still embittered.
“But he claims he didn’t know about the secure site! His reaction seemed honest. He truly does not remember our last conversation d. He says he grieved for the past two years.” Sherlock wanted to believe it was true, that John had not merely cast him aside when he was no longer in London.
It was foggy and dreary, which made night fade into day almost imperceptibly. John had slept through his alarm clock with no sunshine through the curtains to wake him as a back-up measure. In his rush to get coffee before he left for work, he’d only half listened to Sherlock talk about a one armed hitchhiker who carried a sheleighly and had an oblique connection to a stolen gold-and-ruby necklace. Sherlock was still talking when he’d kissed the top of his head then bounded down the stairs in a hurry to catch the 7:53 at Baker Street station.
Next to me, a snort sounded and prompted me to turn to Brother William in astonishment. He appeared to be as deeply absorbed in his work as he had been before.
"Go where...?"
nog. Made with
Mary filled the kettle and flipped it on. She laid the gun on the worktop as she got out the teapot, tea and mugs. John felt sweat trickle down the back of his neck. Was this his chance? Should he lunge for it, try to knock her out of his way? Perhaps he could grab the kettle and use it to knock her out. He glanced up just in time to catch Mary’s eye as she turned toward him. She frowned so John smiled brightly in return. He kept his breathing in check, willing his muscles to relax. He didn’t want Mary to pick up on the tension he felt. Something was very, very off about her and John wasn’t sure how much it would take to push her over the edge.
particular undertone in my voice. I moved around in front of his chair, grabbed his hands, and pulled him out of his chair.
"If you're still in there somewhere," I whispered, gently stroking his ashen face, "If you can hear me, then please, Sherlock - don’t give up. Please wake up ... I ... I have something to tell you and I don’t  even know if you can hear me ... "
“What are you doing?”
Sherlock’s grip on John’s thighs tightened more the longer John stared at him without making a reply. No matter how tense things were, he didn’t really want it to end. He just wanted John to be
"You said no one knew you were here."
"John, please -" he sighed, "I do not want to leave the monastery."
"Look, that's why I wanted to talk to you."
"No, not his brother ... a priest."
"Hey."
“You said you kept an eye on him! You must have known about the woman! Why didn’t you tell me that he was
dinner? No!
Sherlock rounded the sofa and sank into the soft cushions. He glanced toward the telly and the detritus on the coffee table before him. A commercial for feminine hygiene products showing a young woman riding a horse in white jodhpurs and white blouse blared on the expensive television. A green glass ashtray near his knee held the partially smoked joint that Mrs. Hudson had obviously snuffed out when they entered the room.
He hadn’t lied to Sherlock about where he was going - just said he was going out.
"I was worried about him and wanted to see if he was okay."
But at just the last split second, as the last syllable left his tongue, he glanced at Sherlock. Sherlock, whose eyes had taken on a sheen and whose luscious lower wobbled just the slightest bit. Understanding hit John like a lightening bolt and he softly said, “oh,” as he dropped the book into his lap. “Did you mean … I didn’t mean … I just never thought …” John seemed unable to finish a coherent sentence.
"I would like to apologize. What I told you was ... "
John opened the door and held it for Sherlock. He’d chosen the restaurant because it was small, well lit, sure to be uncrowded even on a Sunday in December, and most importantly - it did not serve alcohol.
He gave the man a wink and his most wicked grin.
Sherlock straightens, with his patented ‘I’m-highly-offended’ look. Before he can bluster out a response, John continues. “I have good memories of peppermint schnapps. It’s the first alcohol I ever had - Harry too, but that didn’t turn out so well, did it? At Christmas my mum would make hot cocoa with peppermint schnapps. She’d put whipped cream on top and crush up peppermint candies, sprinkle it on top. My grandparents and aunts and uncles loved it. And for the kids - Harry, the cousins, me - she’d make some up in special Christmas mugs with just a teaspoon of schnapps, and extra candy on top.”
"I'll help you but you have to tell me everything you know. "
"Wait a minute, what gift?"
They both erupted in a fit of giggles. John felt
"Oh - I think I got him. Sherlock Holmes. Is apparently in the intensive care unit, that is, you would have to register there first in the nurses room. Fifth floor, left corridor. "
Following Saul up the steps, Sherlock looked around. The property was surrounded by a tall, decorative iron fence but there was no gate. A portico at the top of the steps was held aloft by thick limestone pillars. Glossy black, double front doors with frosted sidelights sat in the shadow cast by the portico’s roof. Saul reached for the doorknob and a shiver of anticipation raced up Sherlock’s spine. He wasn’t sure where this misadventure was headed, he wasn’t even sure if he’d make it out alive. He didn’t even know Frank’s last name or why he’d relented and cancelled the call to Sherlock’s brother. But one thing Sherlock felt in his bones: whatever was on the other side of that door would shape his life in a way he couldn't even conceive.
The derogatory tone in his voice infuriated me but I didn’t want to start a fight now.
“So did you lose yourself?"
“Where would you put it? We’re full up here.”
Skipping from navel to hipbone to hip crease, Sherlock littered kisses on John’s body as he settled  between John’s legs.  John watched and made a sympathetic sound at Sherlock’s languid movements - he was obviously moving carefully to avoid pulling the tape holding the bandages crossing his back in place. John heard a click, then Sherlock’s lube-slicked hand circled his cock and the other gently slicked his bollocks. Sherlock kept his mouth in motion, kissing the inside of John’s thigh, the soft skin just beside his sac, his kneecap - everywhere but the place John most wanted his mouth to be.
It couldn’t be true. All the suffering, all the pain, moving out of Baker Street, avoiding Mrs. Hudson because it was too painful to see her sweet, sad face … falling in with Mary, the affectionate relationship based mainly on sex and Mary’s bright smile and not much else… all of it, the huge
"Who wants to know?"
"What are you afraid of, Jonah? Who is threatening you? "
"Brother Francis," I mumbled in sudden realization.
Sherlock gestured that he understood with a vague wave of his hand, half asleep. John bent and kissed his cheek. “Wash those sheets while I’m out,” he said over his shoulder as he headed into the loo.
"If you want to go to him - go ahead."
"He says that he has to go to rehab for a long time and then probably go back to London because he is likely to be dependent on regular medical appointments for his injuries for quite some time."
like a physical barrier between them, he’d closed himself off even as Sherlock did his utmost to be strong, to be the one John could lean on when he was down. Instead of leaning in, John had leaned away. And now, here they were, separated by the kitchen table, separated by the word
Sherlock squeezed back. “Couple more minutes,” he answered.
Having arrived at the door, behind which were the sleeping rooms of the friars, I stopped, knowing that I did not have permission to access this area of the monastery.
"It does not have to mean anything," I tried to calm the young man and put a hand on his shoulder, "Maybe this is just a misunderstanding ..."
I gasped for air; wanted to say something, but did not say anything while Jonah just looked at me with an unfathomable look.
Quietly, I opened the door so as not to wake the young man should he be asleep - which was indeed the case. I crept over to check on him at least superficially, and to see if there were signs of any worsening of his condition. I took a moment to notice that he was breathing quietly and that no abnormalities were recognizable. The tray on which his supper had been served stood almost untouched on the little wooden side table. The spoon had been used so I could assume that he had at least a little soup. I was about to clear the dishes and leave the room when I heard a faint rustle behind me. Jonah had turned around and his eyes opened a tiny split.
“An explanation. And apology. Please, just read it.” Sherlock hated the pleading tone in his voice but he had reached the end of his self control. He was desperate for John to understand, to remember. “Just … it’s all in there. You’ll understand after you read it.”
"This is the spot where the broken bottle of whiskey caught me when my father beat me with it. I can be glad that he missed my eye by a hair's breadth, otherwise I would be blind on this eye," I replied, pointing my finger to the places that had actually been injured. I never talked about him. I did not even think of him as 'my father', but I did not know another way to make Jonah see what alcohol could do.
"It's probably better if I leave you to your studies. Good night."
"What about him?"
I drew in a sharp breath and shook my head. "You are wrong, Jonah. There was never anything between us and there will never be. "
"What were you expecting? The fact that I have, on account of special circumstances, contravened my vow, also abdicate all other obligations which I have vowed to obey? Believe me, there is not the slightest reason for this. I will repent in due time for my transgressions, but it should be clear to you that it is not for you to judge my actions. I am not accountable to you. "
I gave Sherlock a stunned look, but he just smiled mischievously and disappeared into the hallway.
"And what about you?" He asked, catching me by surprise, although I had expected the question that this question would come up eventually. "What brings a seasoned man - a physician, in fact - to the monastery? Stress at work? Or are you not at peace with yourself? I don’t want to insinuate anything, but you seem a little lost sometimes, if I may say so openly ... "
In the great garden, surrounded by the cloister, I found him; however, Brother William was not in the shed, but where I should have sought him much earlier - he was with his bees. For an almost endless moment, I just looked at him with his hat and veil, his gloves and his pipe, standing before the beehives, wrapped in white smoke and the black cloth of his habit. Dark curls on light skin surrounded by the delicate veil of the hat. A symphony in black and white. Lost in his activity, he had not seen me coming and jerked briefly when I stepped beside him and cleared my throat.
He must have noticed my fascination, for he raised a finger to tell me that I might wait. He disappeared briefly in a nearby shed, from which he returned only a little later with a second beekeeper's hat and long, padded gloves that he handed me. He waited until I had put on the protective equipment, then grabbed me by the elbow and pulled me slowly to the beehives. Again he took the whistle in his mouth and blew a powerful smoke cloud in the direction of the baskets.
"You're the one who brought me into this situation!" I complained to him in a hoarse voice, knowing how unjust and defiant my accusations sounded.
"Then I'll leave you alone now."
Now it was up to me to clear my throat. I did not know why, but I didn’t like to talk about this. Something about this whole situation seemed terribly wrong. I felt as if my throat was closing up; maybe it was just the indisposition that I felt in the face of such discipline, but perhaps it was also a feeling of guilt because I too had been to blame for Brother William not being able to eat together with the other brothers and spend his free time with them. I took a deep breath.
And now, fresh from the barber, his shorn and pomaded hair slicked straight back from his forehead, Sherlock felt like a new man. Fresh, unbound, unfettered from his past indiscretions. He’d been clean for years - it was finally time to look like it.
"Probably."
"Say, Sherlock ..."
"You're right, John. At first it was all staged. Several weeks after Sherlock left, Mycroft contacted me and introduced me to his plans. In France, where no one knew him, Sherlock would acquire the theological basics and contact me as soon as everything necessary was set in motion. From a legal point of view, you are right with your suspicions - Sherlock has never taken the vows of ordination. That he spent the last few months before he came here in a convent in Brittany, however, is true. "
Since most people see very little and observe even less, the people around them missed the signs (except Mycroft, of course).
The words had slipped out of me before I could stop it.
Sherlock observed the cabin through slitted eyelids. He often found air travel overwhelming – too many people, too much noise. And coach was its own special circle of hell. The music flooding his senses helped. He narrowed his focus to the overweight man to John’s left.
"Thank you."
"Through this holy anointing, the Lord will help you in his abundant mercy, to help you with the power of the Holy Spirit. The Lord who frees you from sin, save you, in His mercy he will raise you up. "
“She educated me on how it gets harder to sleep deeply as one gets older. Especially when one’s tenants are fucking
“I don’t see anything to talk about. I’m with Mary now. We’re getting married. I would like to still be friends, if that’s possible.” John sounded like being friends was the last thing he wanted. “I thought at least I’d come by and thank you for saving my life.”
"Are you sure?" I asked, fixing Jonah with a questioning look.
"You two are getting along just fine, aren’t you?"
His wedding took up considerable time, then he and his wife left for their sex holiday and I had nothing to do. When they arrived home he seemed more and more preoccupied with his wife and their ‘couple friends’ from the boring suburb where they lived. So I followed him.
"You talked to the doctor?"
"I will," I promised and turned to go.
John sputters and drops the newspaper he was reading. “What did…”
"Billy?" That's when it hit me. "The junkie from Montague Street!"
“I thought. Well, I hound you about your smoking. And try to tell you when and where you can smoke. And I realized. It’s controlling, isn’t it? You’re an adult, you pay your share of the rent. You can outrun me without even breathing hard so it’s not ruining your health. So, I…”
Even stranger was the way John behaved after they were thrown out of the restaurant. They settled a small diner and John continued to be angry and yell at Sherlock. And that woman – Mary, he’d gathered to be her name – tagged along as if she belonged with them.
6ish months later...
“John, the secure website. Didn’t you check it? Didn’t you get the web address from the paper? Didn’t you retrieve the newspaper from Mrs. Hudson’s bins?  The password! Did you remember the capital letters?” Sherlock’s voice rose as he spat out a litany of questions, growing more agitated by the minute.
the British government. And he is not to be trifled with, so be on guard if you should meet him. "
"Problem?"
to run back to Baker Street, tear open the door, throw him on the sofa and snog him silly. It hurt so badly to see Sherlock in the flesh, even more incandescent and magnetic than his memories of the man.
After a brief internet search, the only information that could help me was Jonah's comment that Sherlock used to live on Montague Street. For London, the road was quite short, so I wanted to use my day off to take a little walk past the British Museum along the way and to inconspicuously squint at the homes in Montague Street.
"I couldn’t do that as a child as well," he tried to justify himself.
I wanted to make a joke, but I just couldn’t; a single look at the motionless body in front of me was enough to wipe any hint of a smile from my lips. With a sigh, I leaned forward and buried my face in the folds of his hospital gown, feeling his heartbeat and the warmth of his body against my cheek.
Was it so obvious? Or was his question simply meant in a friendly sense? I hoped for the latter, and answered accordingly.
“I thought you’d like an authentic Santa gift delivery.”
"Do you not ever remember your time together?"
Best to put away those gloomy thoughts! She had a turkey to baste, piecrust to crimp, potatoes to peel and she needed to lay a fire in the living room fireplace.
John remembered the feeling of a true relationship with Sherlock. The thrum of excitement through his veins when he returned home, running up the stairs because he couldn’t wait to see the person he loved again. The discussions, debates, challenging each other, even calling each other insulting names that were really endearments.
"If I have to ... but first I will go over to the church and pray for him - I will not let anyone stop me doing that."
"What is it?" Jonah asked, frightened, standing next to William and placing a hand on his shoulder.
John gasped in surprise at the gauze bandages crisscrossing Sherlock's back, held in place with white medical tape. There were so many, it was hard to find a square inch of skin among them. Sherlock continued, “Mycroft’s been sending a nurse round every evening, but I have a feeling he cancelled that service.” He grinned over his shoulder at John, “Now that I have my own personal physician again.”
The last word was nothing more than a breath of air and as weak as its sound was its effect. Sherlock's chest rose and fell with the rhythm of the ventilator, and it was not until I rested my hand on his chest that I could feel his heart beating. Weak, but even. If I had hesitated the previous visit, it now seemed as if my body wanted to make up for what it had been denied the last time; I wanted to touch him, stroke his skin, run my fingers through his dark curls and feel his lips on mine. But instead of continuing to indulge in dreams that would never come true, I thought better of it and began to talk. I told Sherlock about everything that had happened since his involuntary departure from the monastery, about Jonah's 'excursion.'
her. She was bright, amusing, quick witted and beautiful. But he didn’t
I had talked to my sister Harriet shortly before her marriage to Clara; it had actually started quite relaxed, with her impish grin accompanying the question of whether I eventually hoped to tie the knot, too. I had laughingly rejected her by saying that I was quite sure that this kind of lifestyle wouldn’t work for me. Suddenly she became obsessed with the idea of pairing me off with someone and zealously forged plans but this had ultimately been too much for me. I had already noticed the slight smell of gin when she hugged me in welcome and I decided to use her weakness against her, knowing that it was wrong, shabby in fact.
"He's still in the hospital after all, is not he?"
Sorry, this work doesn't allow non-Archive users to comment.
. I looked around the room, uncertain what to do next.
"My flat is just around the corner."
I decided not to see Brother Jonah until evening. He needed tranquility to recover and enough time to sleep off his intoxication or any attempt at a conversation would be doomed from the beginning. With a queasy feeling I now appeared at Vespers. Much too early, for there was no one in the gloomily illuminated church besides a novice who lit the candles, which were fastened in holders on the pillars that delimited the side aisles of the church. We knew each other by sight but I could not remember his name so we smiled and nodded at each other before I looked for a place on the outer edge. The silence, which I had always perceived as peaceful, seemed depressing right now. I heard a noise from outside the building that grew increasingly loud as the church grew darker - a rain front crossed the place and seemed to drown it. There was thunder in the distance.
Again I stared out the window. A question remained that left me no rest. According to what Jonah had told me, the separation of the two had been the result of his decision to enter the monastery - Brother William had at that time been anything but enthusiastic about his decision - he had ended the contact and had not restored it ever since. And then, little more than a year later, he had appeared again on the scene - as a fully ordained monk. Even assuming that he had gone to France immediately after their separation, had joined a convent, successfully completed the novitiate and took his vows for a few years, this did not explain his motives, nor the astonishing speed at which he had completed his monastic education - and certainly not the fact that he had returned directly to England afterwards and had joined the community which his former partner also belonged to.
"You should take a break, Dr. Watson."
"I have a date occassionaly."
"Of course, it does," I replied, "but there's lots of time until Sherlock is done with rehab. We all don’t know what will happen then ..."
. John’s anger was apparent in the long glare that accompanied the question.
"No problem."
"Why does this dispute with your sister still bother you? I thought you had reconciled." Jonah took up the issue again, as serious and caring as before.
"The point?"
Biting the inside of his cheek until he tasted iron, John struggled to keep control so he could fuck Sherlock through his orgasm. It was only when he saw Sherlock’s back sag and Sherlock quieted that John gave in to his own urgent need. He thrust deep one final time then quickly pulled out, slotting his cock against Sherlock’s cleft and rutting savagely as sparks flew up his spine then coalesced downward again. Orange and silver starbursts burst on the backside of his eyelids as he groaned and gave in to the pulses of pleasure. His ruts were slicked by his own hot semen and continued to press into Sherlock’ flesh, moaning loudly, as he rode out the last few weakening pulses.
to see Sherlock.
"I'm not angry with you," whispered Jonah, as if he were aware of my doubt. He pulled me into a tight hug. "I just want you two to be as happy as you deserve."
"Hello John."
"I just wanted to ..." I stammered, probably not far from being labeled as a nervous wreck by Brother William.
Prior Lambert gave me a cold, almost condescending smile.
His reaction was the same as that of the Prior's - he shook his head.
No. Alright, stop it now.
Sherlock had learned to look anywhere from five years younger than his age to five years older just by adjusting the set of his shoulders and the way he carried his head. Over the years he’d also learned to blend in with a crowd by adopting similar postures and gestures to those around him. He had no doubt he’d be able to pass among the nightclub’s patrons without being detected.
“I can pay for it,” Sherlock offered.
Sherlock dropped a newspaper into John’s lap. “Good. There’s a glass blowing class that meets on Sundays. They’re looking for an assistant. I knew you’d be interested so I circled the advert. Thought you could use the extra income.”
"As Prior Lambert introduced me to you, he told you that we were all but colleagues - and I, as you already know, am working in the field of science and herbal medicine, so it seems likely that you pursue a medical profession. You are here to get away from your everyday life; you seek the peace and seclusion only a monastery could give you, so I'm assuming that you have a job that drains you, which has lot of stress - it’s obvious  that you are working as a doctor in a larger hospital. However, your physique is not indicative of the typical clinician who gets too little sleep, and eats unhealthy food - you are, despite your small size, very strong and athletic but you seem to have neglected your training lately, maybe even abandoned it. I attribute this to your slight limp, which occurs sometimes. Psychosomatic, I'm afraid. But your therapist probably already said that. "
“Santa wears considerably more clothing than
My cell phone never left my hand after my return to London; even at work I carried it with me constantly and switched it off only if I had no choice. But as much as I hoped, as much as I tried to will the device to ring - nothing. Week after week passed and I waited in vain for a call. I told myself it was the injury to his vocal cords so he couldn’t talk and that his hands were not coordinated enough enough yet to send me a text message. I told myself that he was focused on his rehab, that was all. Every now and then I was tempted to call the convent and ask Jonah if he had heard anything about Sherlock, but the knowledge that outside contact was not really wanted held me back. Jonah himself might not be so bothered if I called but the Prior would certainly not like a former guest constantly seeking contact with one of the monks. If one wanted to be in regular contact with the outside world, then one did seek a life in the monastery: I had to accept that, for better or worse.
"Is everything alright with you?"
Weeks of trailing him through his dull routine - work, home, a few nights out with his wife and new friends. I began to wonder why I even bothered. I was as bored surveilling his activities as he looked while enduring them. The less he answered my calls and texts, the more I followed him.
The look he gave me showed all the hopelessness that I now felt.
“I’ll stay home.” There was a hint of desperation in Sherlock’s voice. “I’ll do the washing up. You can relax. Watch telly.”
“Just ... stop. Stop the bullshit.” John pinched the bridge of his nose with a groan. “I’m fucking tired, Sherlock. Tired of waiting for you to come home.”
I rummaged in my jacket pocket desperately for a pen and paper, on which I wrote down my mobile number and handed it to Sherlock.
Hope dies last - in my case, however, it was just in mortal combat. The symptoms were too unspecific to risk forcing vomiting - the danger was too great that the poison would burn his esophagus and throat and even his respiratory tract. I wanted to do something; I despaired at the certainty that there was nothing I could do. It seemed like an invisible wall that I could not penetrate; instead, I watched helplessly as he grew weaker and weaker.
"The Queen!" I whispered with excitement, looked at her for a moment as she crawled over the honeycombs, then put the frame back into its place at the behest of the friar. After I had checked all five beehives, the dark-haired man got proactive himself and took one of the frames, the honeycombs of which were almost all closed. He hung it in a stainless steel container and gestured for me to follow him back inside the monastery.
right in front of me. I watched you
He knew that I asked for a reason because his eyes looked a little alarmed.
John looked down his body at Sherlock’s upturned face. Sherlock’s eyes flashed playfully as he stroked over John’s bollocks and down his thigh, trailing his slick fingers through the wiry hair, drawing slick designs into the shiver-sensitive skin, then stoked his palm back up to firmly massage the root of John’s cock. The knuckles of his other hand brushed the back of John’s sac before his tongue finally replaced his fingers, laving John’s bollocks and perineum and trailing kisses over his thighs, drawing a full body shiver from John. John watched a tiny pearl of translucent fluid appeared at the tip of his cock as Sherlock kissed up his thigh, lingering at the place thigh became hip and ending with a wet swipe up his cock to gather the drop of fluid. Sherlock sat back between John’s thighs and licked his lips as he poured more slick into his hand then rubbed his palm together.
Mary crooked her head and replied brightly, “What is it, John? That you’ve been off working for MI5?” She laughed briefly.
"He suspected that it must be one of your fellow brothers."
"Chervil...?"
John didn’t ask for details. No matter how late Sherlock left the house our how late he returned, John made it a point to never ask where he’d been. They both kept odd hours - their professions often necessitated comings and goings outside of normal business hours. Sherlock never asked him when John had to leave on a moment’s notice and he gave Sherlock the same courtesy. They
The shock of my painful loss slowly dawned. Again and again I tried to convince myself that it had just been nothing more than a fleeting flirtation, nice, but just entertaining. Sherlock and I had experienced many things together, perhaps more than any other person would have encountered in his entire life - but now it was over and I had to accept the fact. I devoted myself to my work fully, went out after work with colleagues in the pub and could almost claim to have regained something like my normal
"That Francis was behind the threats? "
The priest shook his head as if he did not want to accept the possibility.
Yes, Sherlock. Got it. Please take care of yourself.
He turned to me, but his eyes were fixed on a point right beside my head.
Sherlock smiled softly at him. “Go on, shower first. I’ll be in the kitchen.”
“What the fuck!” John blurted. “If Mycroft knew something about Mary, why didn’t he tell me?” John’s voice shook with suppressed fury.
, after sex, they’d always separated to clean up then headed back to their own rooms to sleep. But before, they’d only been having sex. They’d never exchanged tender words or even affection beyond a few moments of closeness while cooling down after orgasm. John yawned, too relaxed to worry much about it. If Sherlock wanted him to trot upstairs to his own bedroom, Sherlock would surely tell him.
"I would probably associate the visit with seeing Brother William again ... It's exactly as you say, Mr. Prior - I was there when he was poisoned and somehow I feel responsible for him. I know how strange this must sound to you, but ... "
"I know exactly what you wanted - just as well as you know it does not work."
A hand on his elbow stopped his progress. He spun toward the owner of the hand to find himself looking up into dark eyes set in a swarthy, handsome face. “Hello, doll. I haven’t seen you around here before,” the too-handsome man lisped in a Cuban accent. It was clear this man had seen Scarface and strove to emulate the lead actor of that movie in his dress and actions.
Mrs. Hudson nodded slowly. “Yes, I know that clinic. It’s one of the best for teens and young people.” She glanced at him with compassion in her eyes. “It’s hard to be so far away from your family. Did you plan to work a bit, until you could afford a ticket home?”
"Please forgive me, Prior, I should have asked permission."
I felt my cheeks blush slightly. Caught. I shook my head as if I could thus expel the unpleasant thoughts that started me haunt again. Perhaps it had been a mistake to come here, because actually I did not really know exactly what haunted me and slowly crept into not only my sleep, but also robbed the joy of life from me.
The lines around John’s mouth softened. His lips appeared minutely fuller because tension in his facial muscles eased. The whites of Sherlock’s eyes were brighter, because he was getting more sleep (more sleep meant more time touching John so Sherlock was wholeheartedly in favor of it). Both men held their shoulders in a more relaxed pose.
They had dinner then spent the evening reading by the fire and not talking about the painful memories that seemed to hang in the air like ghosts of Christmas past.
"No, John, not that. And you know that, too."
"Tell me, John."
"But what about you?"
It was almost an automatism that made me dip two fingers into the holy water, then made the sign of the cross over my forehead and upper body.
Fascinated by the letter’s unusual contents, I approached and tried to grab it, but the monk pushed the seeds together and into his slightly arched palm, poured them back into the envelope and carefully locked it in a drawer.
Of course, Mycroft had cut his mobile service as a precaution to maintain the safety of the safehouse.
This statement perplexed me.
He furiously tore the reading glasses from his nose and hurled them on the table with force; I almost feared that the glasses would break.
He raised his hands helplessly and stared at me with big eyes.
"But you are talking to each other with your religious names ..."
“The Adaptive Center Miami.”
"You are welcome."
They were both laughing now, John leaning against the table and nearly collapsing in mirth and Sherlock rocking back and forth on his lab stool, giggling helplessly.
The Chickenpox vaccine was brand new when John joined the Army, too new for the Army to make it part of the standard inoculations given to new recruits. John never thought much of it, having been assured by his Mum that he would never catch Chickenpox.
I'm not sure what reaction I’d expected from Sherlock. What I got was a blissful smile, another kiss from lips so unspeakably tender, and finally, after I had let go of his hands, he signed slowly with obviously heartfelt emotion.
As the day drew to a close, however, I was nervous. I had noted at lunch that Brother Jonah and I were on the chart tonight for kitchen service - along with Brother William. When we came into the kitchen, the curly-headed man was already bent over one of the countertops, slicing the bread for dinner while large kettles of water heated on the stove. He greeted us with a curt nod and gave the novice a sign that we were to get the dishes out of the cupboards and set the tables. I was more than happy because that meant that we could leave the room in which he was engaged in preparing food - so I no longer had to waste all my energy in trying not to stare incessantly.
"Detective stories?"
"Why didn’t you come to me for the months after you returned to London? I gave you my number ... "
He hauled Sherlock to the door, unlocked then threw it open to bellow, “Saul!”
"I'm calling the police. It's too much over the past few days to handle these things on our own. "
"I'm not sure ..." I added timidly, I’ve got a job I enjoy, nice colleagues with whom I go and have a drink now and then ..." A smile crossed my face as I thought of Sarah, an extremely likeable young doctor I worked with in the emergency room who always wore an expression of serenity even if chaos erupted around her.
After the Prior put his glasses back on his nose and thanked the attendees for their attention, everyone stood up and went back to their usual routine as I retreated to the kitchen where Brother Elijah had already begun to prepare a small pot of herbal tea and cup on a tray for Brother Jonah. A bowl of porridge followed and was finally garnished with three fanned apple slices; it was clear that the cook wanted to make the novice happy with the lovingly prepared breakfast.
I tried sorting my thoughts and approaching it logically. Had I not known him, my suspicion would probably have fallen on Jonah first - after all, it was he who had given William the chocolates. The two men knew each other before, had been a couple for a long time, and probably had a closer relationship until a few days ago than was common among religious people. Besides, Jonah seemed to have some emotional instability lately - could anything have happened between the two men that could have made him do such a thing?
"He was extubated yesterday morning, and was diagnosed with damage to the vocal cords and larynx, apparently caused by the poison, which currently makes it impossible for him to make anything other than incomprehensible sounds."
"I've never seen a beehive from close up," I explained in awe, trying to see something in spite of the distance.
When I entered the seminar room two hours later, the novices were already present. Jonah, too, who I had almost forgotten during the day, was sitting in his place, drawing on the edge of his writing pad with a ballpoint pen, I could see geometrical shapes, squiggles, and wavy lines that merged into one another in a confused pattern, but without making a recognizable picture.
- to bring tears to my eyes to make them redden, then wiped the tears away with the now-grimy cuff of my hoodie.
it was a bad idea to keep spending the night in Sherlock’s room. He’d even brought it up to Sherlock, that they should retire upstairs to his room for after-dark activities. But somehow,  John’s bed remained un-slept-in even though his clothing and personal possessions were safely stowed in ‘his’ bedroom.
"Yes."
"I think it would be best if he could, if only briefly, visit Brother William at the hospital. Just sitting here, unable to do anything..." I shook my head, unsure how to finish the sentence, ignoring what I had learned with confidence from the young novice.
Sherlock turned at the waist to face John with an expression of shock. “Now?”
The first door he opened was a bathroom, the next a bedroom. He entered and sat heavily on the double bed and pulled out the laptop and powered it on. He plugged in the flash drive, quickly stripped down to his pants and vest then turned down the pale blue duvet and slipped into bed.
“Can I read them now?” Sherlock gestured toward the floor where the laptop lay.
I heard the door open behind me. Jonah came in and sat down on the edge of the bed.
"The evidence was right in front of your nose, John. Most people see but they do not observe. I wrote down everything I knew until Francis' attack on me and hid it in front of everyone - I was so sure that at least
I was glad to find a chair in front of the office of Prior Lambert, where I was able to put the young man down until Brother Elijah returned with the key. Just at this moment, a door opened on the opposite side of the corridor, and Brother William stepped out. A brief glance at his brother's bloodstained head seemed to suffice as a justification to grab me by the shoulders and push me against the nearby wall.
"Not at all, the novitiate takes at least a year and before that, the postulate needs to be passed. But Brother William took his solemn profession two years ago - he came to us from a convent in Brittany, when it disbanded. "
The Father shook his head vehemently.
Now Sherlock was back, popping “not dead!” on him and babbling about some secret website John was supposed to have known about. His fist clenched at the thought.
as the body moves
Laughing together, Sherlock and John leaned into each other as the cab resumed traveling. They exchanged sloppy kisses between giggles. Soon enough their kiss turned serious and each tangled his fingers in the other’s hair.
"You have a choice," he told me, "Either stick with our novices whose curriculum today, among other things, includes detailed introduction to our religious rule states, or participate in the apple harvest. I would think, given an alternative, that you would prefer the first one - in fact, you can pick apples anytime you want, you don’t need to join a convent to do that" he added with a wink.
The four shared a meal at Mycroft’s expense then they headed back to Baker Street. When John closed the door to the flat behind them and turned the lock, they dissolved into a fit of giggles. Sherlock pulled John to him and looked down into his face with such an open, unguarded expression that it was John’s eyes turn to mist.
Jonah shrugged, as if he did not understand the question.
"I was a different person then. Now there are other things that count for me. "
"I'm innocent," the novice muttered, glaring at his blood-drenched brother, "why are you doing this?"
seemed agreeable to waiting.
, crossed my mind in a moment of cynicism. His eyes were closed, but his chest rose and fell on its own in a steady rhythm, accompanied by the steady beep of the heart monitor. I pulled up a chair and sat down beside his bed.
I almost expected her to demand that I identify myself, but instead she just smiled shyly, took a large-sized book from the shelf behind her and presented it to me.
Sherlock swallowed, raised his chin a notch then answered. “I found a weakness in your perimeter security. I wasn’t trying to steal anything, just looking for a place to sleep.” Sherlock played up his posh British accent, putting it on rather thicker than he usually did in America.
Heavy double doors at the end of the hall lead into the main club. It was getting late, long past the dinner hour, so Sherlock took a moment to adopt the mannerisms of an early-20s clubber, cruising the scene and happy to be out for the night. He scratched a hand through his hair until it tumbled artfully over his forehead and pushed up the sleeves of the jacket and shirt to just below his elbows. Thumping bass from the club music reverberated in Sherlock’s chest as he made his way toward the bar. The dance floor was already crowded with gyrating couples and the bar was lined three-deep with patrons all vying to catch the few bartenders’ attention. Sherlock took up a post against the wall at the end of the bar and watched the activity around him. After a quarter hour he saw a pattern emerge. A middle-aged man seated on a stool in the center of the bar was the middle of the action. Men and women came and went around him like ocean waves, all smiling and jovial and evidently trying to curry his favor. Sherlock deduced the man was both the owner of the establishment and the owner of the clothes he’d nicked, not to mention the gun and cocaine. Grinning maniacally, Sherlock edged into the crowd and worked his way toward the man.
When I returned to my room at half past eight, I noticed for the first time just how tired I was. I would simply have to rest a little, until I would be awakened by the bells, whose sound was pretty hard to ignore. Only a little doze, a tiny nap ...
"I’m not talking about me, John - I’m talking about you."
Sherlock—
Sherlock responded with a smile again, then shrugged apologetically and turned to Jonah, who translated Sherlock’s signs:
"Are you in pain?" I asked him in a helpless attempt to keep the conversation going.
"A little, but ... I don’t understand what it's all about."
He looked at me with a smile.
"What I'm really talking about is ... well ... do you think it advisable to leave him alone with his problems? Until this morning, after all, he still had Brother William, who stood by his side, but now - after these terrible news? "
“I’ll write down my brother’s number. I’m sure the clinic has called my parents by now and they’d have called him. They’re all bound to be in a stir. You’d be doing them a favor by calling, letting them know I’m okay.” Sherlock was pleading now. This interrogation had gone on to long - his nerves were shot, and he hadn’t even used the cocaine he'd scored last night from the man who sat in front of him. Sherlock hoped Frank wouldn't frisk him and find the baggie in his sock - the baggie Frank would surely recognize. Frank seemed to shaken up to recognize the shirt and jacket Sherlock wore as his own. But surely the man would recognize it all, and realize that Sherlock had burgled his office, if he found the drugs.
“Mmmm,” Sherlock hummed, pretending to have an idea what John was talking about.
“Get over here. Get it off!”
Sherlock turned back to the sink. “Yeah,” he muttered over his shoulder. At last the irritating woman moved on, probably to terrorize other minimum wage workers who had the bad luck to work in this wretched kitchen.
"His men? What does this guy do professionally? Is he working for the British government or something like that? "
For a moment, I simply stood by his side and held his hand, occasionally glancing at the monitor to see if his pulse or heart rate changed-but nothing happened. The longer I stood beside his bed, the more desperate I became. Right now, he was closer to death than to life, and even though I barely knew him, the thought that he could die any moment was unbearable. As meaningless and unrequited as my feelings were to him, none of that changed the fact that I, in the face of his condition, suffered untold torments. Never before had I felt that way for another human being, it seemed like fate to me, meeting a man in a convent to whom I felt so deeply attached from the first moment, as we were destined for each other. And now fate had just decided to tear us apart. The Lord giveth, the Lord taketh. But for me, only one thing was certain - his loss would break my heart.
Mycroft hadn’t said he couldn’t leave the house, so John decided to take a walk to clear his head. He left the laptop on the kitchen table then tried the front door. It was locked and there was no lock mechanism on his side of the door.
I would like to talk about the future. I had so many questions that he alone could answer - but how was that supposed to work? Should I ask him in sign language what he wanted to do after he was released from the hospital? Would he go back to the monastery? Or if he ... with me ... As much as I wanted to know - now was just not the right time. Apart from the fact that I didn’t known the sign for 'convent' and, to be honest, I was too cowardly to ask out of fear for getting an unwanted response.
to ask me if I
"Impressive," I whispered as he took out one of the frames and showed me the honeycombs inside, on which about twenty bees crawled hastily. I could have watched him work for hours on end but I would rather have spent the time learning about the fascinating animals from him. He was just pushing a flat bowl with a thick liquid solution into the back of the beehive when I spoke.
“Well, I have all these messages. You wrote them, and they’re. Well, they’re wonderful. The best thing you could have ever done for me. And, you know. I just … I’m not good with words. With talking, I mean. I’m better at writing things out.” John felt a blush rising. Really, it was ridiculous to be embarrassed in front of Sherlock. He’d had his tongue up Sherlock’s anus, for god’s sake. How could he be embarrassed at Sherlock catching him writing a love note!
I hesitantly walked up and down the hall thinking about my conversation with him. Could it really be that he had pushed Brother Francis and caused his fall through the glass? It just did not fit in with the image of the peaceful young monk who grew so much in his faith that nothing else counted for him. I couldn’t imagine him committing such an act of violence. On the other hand, that also applied to all other friars. But it was clear that someone had poisoned the chocolates that William had eaten with a strong neurotoxin and there was a high likelihood that this person was living here in the monastery.
“Have you looked out the window? There’s a foot of snow.”
The creases John loved appeared at the corners of Sherlock’s eyes. “You did, didn’t you?” He took another bite - a bigger one this time.
It was such a privilege to translate this sweet, lovely story. Thank you Philomena85, for giving me this opportunity.
I entered the room with a feeling of dread. The man man my heart belonged to had almost met a tragic end in that room. Now, however, he was back in the hospital bed, sleeping as if those terrible events had never happened. Everything seemed like it was a few days ago: The dialysis machine filtered toxins out of his blood, the heart monitor beeped monotonously, the ventilator hissed menacingly - and Sherlock lay still, nonresponsive. His freshly washed hair spread like a dark halo on the white pillow. If not for the remnants of a bloodstain on the wall on the opposite side of the room, the scene could almost have been described as peaceful. If you could ignore the circumstance.
He couldn’t say he missed cock so much – while he’d known he was bi since he was a pre-teen, he’d definitely been more of a 2 on the Kinsey Scale than a 4. He could have been happy with a woman for the rest of his life. He would have never sought out male encounters again if he’d married Mary.
"You know that you are free to contact me anytime you feel sad or distressed, right?"
Perhaps my presence was indeed welcome.
"He and Brother Jonah get along very well, don’t they?"
“So your good memories of peppermint schnapps are based solely on Christmas?”
I left the church hastily after Thanksgiving and sat down at the breakfast table. I just had to stop my thoughts wandering to Brother William constantly, otherwise I might as well pack my things and go.  It all made no sense - after all, I had come to renew my life and get it in order, not to create new problems by feverishly dreaming of a man who was committed to celibacy. I would have to distract myself. No matter how.
I entered the almost sterile-looking room and approached him. I noticed that the room, unlike Brother Jonah's room - whose walls were painted in bright colors and had paintings of landscapes and two potted plants on the windowsill - contained hardly any personal objects. Aside from a pillow with the Union Jack on the head of his bed and a skull that sat on the bookshelf where it had a perfect view of the whole room.
"Are you still in close contact with Mister Trevor?"
About an hour later there was a timid knock on the door of my room. For a brief moment I waited to see if my guest would just open it, but when that didn’t happen, I called a half-loud 'Come in!' at the direction the knock came from. The door opened a crack and a young monk with short blond hair and  fashionable black-framed eyeglasses on the top of his snub nose shoved his head into the room.
Wait. Yesterday’s paper? Mrs. Hudson may have thrown it out.
Out of sheer desperation, I lifted the mattress but there was nothing there besides the slatted frame. Behind the mirror and under the bases of the two reading lamps, the result was equally sobering. At a loss, I went through the books scattered around his desk again, but again I did not find much, except for a small handwritten note that had been used as a bookmark in a book about the different bee species, in one place dealing with the wood bee, an insect species: "We sometimes ask so much for being angels that we forget to be good people."
I didn’t know how to react to this accusation but in some way, I could understand where his resentment came from.
"Thanks, I already had the pleasure."
"Yes, you will be sitting over there with the novices. The seating is determined by the duration of affiliation with the Order. I would, therefore, like to ask you to take the seat next to Brother Francis, this is the young man over there who just set the tables. Which leads immediately to our next topic: Over there is a written plan of all the chores that have to be done, from helping in the kitchen to cleaning up. This naturally also applies to you so I would ask you to take a look at it, so you can conscientiously perform your assigned tasks in order to support the whole of our community. "
I raised a hand, and interrupted him.
"We do. In fact, I know it. I’ve researched. And my research makes me sure that you did not tell me the whole truth. "
An expression of horrified incredulity flashed across Sherlock’s face. “No,” he said. “She didn’t…”
Sherlock gave him a dazzling smile in response.
"You don’t have to do that," he muttered, ashamed, but still let me help him down the stairs.
Had John even thought of such things, that glorious year they’d had together before Sherlock jumped? At the time, probably not. He’d been too busy fucking roughly and being fucked hard in return. But after Sherlock’s suicide John had spent countless hours thinking of things exactly like Sherlock described. He’d composed countless love letters to Sherlock in his mind. Letters full of things he’d never said but wished he’d had. And now? Now he had the chance to say those things. Now he could tell Sherlock everything he’d regretted not saying before.
"No Jonah, you misunderstood something. I don’t have the slightest problem with it, I'm just ... surprised. And I don’t understand why you both went to the monastery, if you had a satisfying relationship. I mean ... that's so irrevocable ... "
"What was that about?"
I briefly glanced into the bedside drawer; on the one hand, I had the feeling of inappropriately intruding on his privacy and, on the other hand, apart from the magnifying glass he’d used when he examined the letter, it contained nothing but a nail file and some handwritten sheet music. I would have loved to take a closer look at the latter, because the thought that he not only played the violin brilliantly, but also composed music, made my heart beat faster. Next, I devoted myself to the closet. It was meticulously sorted: two white undergarments hung there along a black outer garment pleasantly smelling of detergent, along with a long black woolen coat which looked strangely bold with a buttonhole outlined in red thread; the two compartments underneath the closet harbored some long sleeve shirts and socks, almost exclusively black, and - as I noticed blushing - extremely snug-cut underwear. Like a child caught doing something forbidden, I quickly slammed the door close and tried to dispel the thoughts that flashed through my head. I had a job to do and couldn’t allow myself to be distracted now.
She’d turned to him and grasped his hand, probably waiting for him to kiss her. The setting had been nearly painfully romantic. Instead, he’d said “Come on, it’s chilly. Let’s find a warm pub and have dinner.” Mary’s face had fallen. It was then that John had decided to buy the ring, a decision made out of guilt and despair for not being able to return her love. For not being able to be the type of man that could kiss her in the salt spray on a narrow beach on a chilly, sunny day.
But, on the other hand, has there ever been something this man missed?
"My car is in the visitors’ parking lot. I'll get you to the hospital, we'll be back tonight, no one will know you were gone. "
. I was very sure it was Brother William himself, who had given it to me.
"Jonah, wake up, hey, open your eyes, everything will be fine."
I sighed. What was I doing here? Anyway, I could not escape the realization that I wanted this man - now that I knew that same-sex relationships were not alien to him, perhaps even more than ever before. Again and again I tried to persuade myself how wrong those images were that my mind developed at the mere thought of him, but somewhere in my heart a soft voice had come to life, which, like the a little devil, sat on my shoulder, telling me to try my luck.
to love her that way. Maybe an effortless affection was what he needed. That’s what he told himself from the moment he woke until he fell asleep. He was done with grand love. - it just lead to grand drama.
Baker Street still seemed like Home to John. And the thought of Sherlock sitting alone in front of the fireplace, across from John’s empty chair, caused a pain behind John’s sternum. What was Sherlock thinking, sitting alone? Was his chest hurting as bad as John’s?
Sherlock’s expression softened as he took John’s hand between both of his and squeezed. “What can I do to show you, I do want this?” He gestured between them again.
Sherlock stroked John’s neck.
Two weeks ago an idea came into
"Jonah, I didn’t have the slightest idea that today is your birthday! Believe me, if I had known that, I would have given you a present, but I didn’t know ... and I did not give you any chocolates, I'm sorry. I wish you all the best, but ... "
I had not bothered to report, at least to Jonah, that we had expressed our love to each other. I didn’t expect him to tease me about the 'domestic happiness' that would await me as soon as 'my future' finished rehab and I moved in with him.
“Oh now, don’t scowl, young man. You’ve got such a handsome face, you don’t want to give yourself frown lines when you’re older. Even at your age, you’ve got to be thinking toward the future,” Mrs. Hudson said with a smile.
“Yeah, there’s that. I’m going to end it with her.”
I expected reprimand - not a question. Jonah? What about Jonah? Was he not in the monastery? Instead of giving the man in front of me a reasonable answer, I literally stuttered.
As the friar disappeared into the confessional with Brother Jonah, I left the church and roamed around aimlessly, at a loss as to what to do next. I stopped at a long row of windows and looked out into a bright blue, cloudless sky; had it not been for such terrible events, it would have been a beautiful, clear fall day, one of the kind rarely seen.
"You realize that I'll never let you go again, right?"
, mind like a steel trap.
Sherlock answered without hesitation. “I know. And I, you.” He laughed again, a sound of pure joy from deep in his chest and scooted his body down the bed until he could rest his cheek against John’s shoulder.
"I've noticed that many ... well, are very young here. I was just interested in what moved a young person today to
Cupping Sherlock’s cheek, John spoke so lowly, it was nearly a whisper. “You’re alive. And you’re here.” He swallowed a last hiccough. “And you love me.”
My eyes fell on the church clock - it was only a quarter past one. Rarely have I made a decision in less time than now. I ran down the steps, walking the corridors with certainty, as if this was my home, and rushed to the front gate. The brother on duty at the gate looked at me with a frown but did not ask any further questions when I called him a hurried "I have to leave for a while, an emergency". A few minutes later I raced down the street in my old Volvo, steadfastly heading for my destination - St Mary's Hospital in Aldershot.
"I'm not blind, you know?"
So far, in my story, I had concealed much of the conversation I had with Jonah in the meditation room in the attic, but I did not want to hide any more of my thoughts about it from Sherlock.
Christmas held painful memories for the two partners; the forced gaiety of Holiday gatherings was too much for to endure. So they made a mutual decision to ignore the Holiday season.
"Yes," I replied simply, "And that's why I find it so hard to believe that he would be able to intentionally hurt another person. He must have said something about the allegations against him ... "
John scrolled, skipping more messages this time. He chose a file at random and read:
"I am sorry that I have caused you grief. It was stupid and I promise you that something like that will not happen again." He put down the cup, folded his hands in his lap and lowered his head humbly. "Please forgive me."
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I told you, I’m going out.” He’d had enough. He’d tried to be pleasant, to compliment John on his wine selection, to eat the meal John’d made. But of course, sitting at the table with John had just opened him up once again to John’s ire. He picked up the mobile and began to text without any pretense of deference to John. In less than a minute he’d set a new time to meet
"No Jonah - doctor’s orders. Stay here and rest. At least today and tomorrow. Until ... well, until we know how William is doing. "
"If he actually had any feelings for me, then he would have behaved differently. You yourself have said that he is not a real monk, so he is not bound by vows - and even if that were the case, he has made it clear more than once made it clear what he thinks of vows of any kind. "
THE END
"The heroin my dealer sold me was badly contaminated. I lost consciousness and woke up again in hospital. The doctors said I had been clinically dead for three minutes. But when I woke up again, I had the overwhelming feeling that God saved me because he had something for me to do - I know it must sound absurd to you because it is your job to save lives, but .. . "
"How is he?"
Sherlock gasped again and John noticed that he’d begun to shiver violently. He wrapped both arms around Sherlock and pulled him close, holding him gently to avoid opening up any of the wounds still healing on his back. “Shhhh,” he soothed, gently rubbing Sherlock’s neck with one hand. “You did the most important thing. You called Lestrade. And now, she’s going to gaol. We’ll find out what your brother heard hints of. And she won’t be able to hurt us. We’re safe now, Sherlock. Because you called.” He buried his face in Sherlock’s curls then turned his head to kiss Sherlock’s temple. “You’re amazing, you know. If you hadn’t followed me…”
His goal achieved, Sherlock leaned in to speak into Carlos’ ear. “I need the men’s room.” Carlos turned toward him and Sherlock winked and spun away. He wove through the crowded dance floor and headed straight to a door set in the back wall with a red Emergency Exit sign over it. He slipped out and sprinted down the alley, turned toward the ocean at the cross street, then ran block after block, high on adrenaline, dodging traffic at intersections, not stopping until he’d put at least half a mile between himself and the bar. He ducked behind a parked pickup truck and opened the wallet. He riffled through the credit cards and driver's license but left them in place - he was after cash, $288 that he found folded in the back compartment, removed and slid into the front pocket of his jeans. He passed a US Mail box in the following block and dropped the wallet into the letter slot, counting that a kind postal worker would find Carlos from the information on his driver's license and return the wallet. Sherlock might be a pickpocket, but he wasn’t a dickhead.
Realization dawned on his face, which seemed to lose all its color, but I did not let myself be bothered by it. He had told me things from his life that one would probably not even trust his best friend with. He deserved to know that I was also honest with him. I took a deep breath and braced myself for what was to came.
Thankfully the mattress next to Isaac was unoccupied. I sat down on it and looked around. I needed to be flying sufficiently high by the time John arrived to convince him that I’d just happened to flop on the mattress next to his neighbor's son. There wasn’t time to prepare a hypodermic - John would most likely be here any minute, if I knew his strong moral principles. He’d help Kate, of course he would, and that meant he’d be checking the place mattress-to-mattress any minute. The filthy room offered no supplies for proper snorting so I scooped up enough of the powder to give me a short high on the tip of my little finger and inhaled sharply in my left nostril, then another scoop and snort in the right.
“I love you,” John said. It felt right, and true, and effortless. “I really do.” He smiled, joyful to be able to finally be able to say those words without complications.
“The only place I’m going to like that jumper is in a heap on the floor.”
“Twiddle diddles,” Holmes replied.
The house phone rang immediately. John picked it up to hear Mycroft’s voice. “Hello, John. I can be there in half an hour.”
“If you don’t shut up, there won’t be any pasta to eat.”
"Sure."
He looked up at Brother William and thrust his last remaining bishop from the board with his knight. Still, I had the impression that he was strangely quiet for the rest of the evening.
Although I could understand this point, at the same time it meant that I could not visit Jonah then, since I still had no access to the private quarters of the monks. And right now he seemed to be my only solace. I was well aware of how selfish my behavior was, but that did not stop me from resorting to a ruse.
John pulled at Sherlock’s elbow again. “Yes, now. I’m going up to change. Get dressed and be ready to go in ten.”
As the last words left John’s mouth, Sherlock entered the kitchen. A knowing smile spread across John’s face. “You followed me.”
For a moment, Jonah was silent; it seemed difficult for him to digest what I had just said. When he had succeeded, he looked up at me again.
“Ok, then. That’s … settled.” John glanced up to meet Sherlock’s eyes. He attempted a chuckle but it came out thick and wet. “I didn’t mean to keep you.” He took another step away. “I’ll clean up. You have plans.”
On my way to the refectory, my gaze fell on the schedule and I could see that I would be responsible for lunch together with Jonah and Brother Elijah, whom I had not yet met. I could only hope that they did not expect me to cook ... in my apartment the flyers of various take-out restaurants piled up for a reason. Nevertheless, I was quite willing to use the opportunity for a short conversation - if Jonah allowed it. As frightened as he had been since yesterday, it was quite possible that he was now trying to get rid of everything - and everyone.
Weeks faded into months and the rhythm of their lives fell into place:  cases, holidays with Sherlock’s parents, John’s surgery shifts being interrupted by urgent texts from Sherlock, dishes in the sink and clutter in the sitting room, Mrs. Hudson’s treats side by side with specimens in the fridge. Everything it has been
Thank God I was jogging their street when their upstairs neighbor Kate went knocking. Kate, whose son Isaac had a major drug problem. I deduced Kate’s intent by her hunched shoulders, streaming eyes and loud sniffles. Isaac was at the crack pipe again - or the needle, or pills. For so young a man with all the advantages of a suburban lifestyle and loving family, Isaac had a surprisingly wide repertoire of chemical escape preferences; it had been impossible not to notice during the weeks I’d spent watching their building. I knew where he’d been headed the previous night as I watched him leave his flat from where I sat in the front seat of a parked car I’d found unlocked half a block away. He and I had a mutual acquaintance whom he’d obviously been headed to see.
At first, the prior did not say a word and looked at the young man in front of him pensively, until a smile spread slowly across his lips and he stretched out his right hand.
There was movement in the assembled crowd, as the Eucharist replaced the lessons and Prior Lambert spoke the words of consecration I remembered from my childhood; it was an almost automatic movement for me to me kneel like everyone else, all these things seemed strangely familiar to me. As a child I was happy to go to church with my mother but as is so often the case, this habit was lost in the course of puberty and the times I attended Sunday Mass become fewer and fewer, and I had stopped going at some point without thinking about it.
"But then he would have to be a novice, too, or did I misunderstand you in class?"
The smile became wider if possible.
I was quite shocked by the sound of my voice and the defiance that spoke clearly out of it.
Absentmindedly, Jonah, with one hand, gently stroked the cord that wrapped his waist-the cingulum, as I now knew-and touched the three knots in turn. I clearly remembered who and under which circumstances I had seen this gesture before. When he noticed my gaze, Jonah looked up at me.
Anger thrummed through John as he pounded down the steps of Baker Street. He’d intended to stop in for a visit with Mrs. Hudson but was too angry to be good company. He wrenched the front door open and slammed it behind. He winced at the loud noise – it wasn’t fair to Mrs. Hudson to slam about like that. He’d have to remember to apologize the next time he saw her. If there was a next time - he was so angry he doubted if he’d ever see the inside of Baker Street again.
"Yes, of course."
again.
He nodded generously, then walked past me, brushing my arm as if by chance. I slowly followed him out into the hall, hardly daring to follow him, but he stopped suddenly. Again he raised his eyebrows, almost blaming this time, but I did not understand what he meant until he pointed to the clock on the wall above the entrance of the refectory. Ten to twelve - time for midday prayer. I had no choice but to continue to follow him, though at a reasonable distance.
I shook my head, unwilling to accept what Jonah was trying to tell me. If that was actually the case, it would change everything - not only would Sherlock have to rethink his future plans, but of course I would, too. As much as I longed for his closeness, I was still bothered by the question of whether I was ready for a relationship. And what would become of Jonah and his friendship with Sherlock? Even if a friar's life was what he yearned for, it would surely take him a lot of strength to accept that his ex-boyfriend, who had always stood by his side and protected him, would be far away from him. They would probably see each other only very rarely and ...
"You were in the army, weren’t you?"
"Don’t promise anything you can’t keep."
"A suspect?" I asked, trying to sound as uninvolved as possible.
"You mustn’t be so hard on him, he has already lost his mother by the hand of a stranger."
John glanced sideways at Mycroft, too angry to face him directly. He feared he’d punch Mycroft’s snide mouth if he looked at him too long. “Yeah, so. This website Sherlock set up. It seems I had a concussion. From when the biker took me down. I didn’t know, not until tonight. I just … ummm … thought it was grief. You know I thought he was dead, right?” John realized he was rambling but couldn’t seem to organize his thoughts.
"I don’t know," I whispered, trying to keep my composure, at least now, "I don’t know ..."
"I am his confessor."
I cleared my throat uncomfortably, but did not answer because I already knew which way this conversation was going.
Sherlock remained silent; his chest ached a little at John’s sad expression. Of course John hadn’t hated Christmas as a child. That dislike came out of adult experiences - lonely Christmases in a hastily-constructed Army base in the Middle East, Christmas at Baker Street with a forgettable girlfriend, grief filled Christmas in a lonley flat thinking his best friend was dead, and Christmas of lies, deceit and murder. Sherlock opened his mouth to reply but John spoke first.

I’d never thought it would bother me like that to be rejected by a man who was out of my reach. My mind knew that there was no chance for me to win his love, but my heart still vehemently disagreed. Was he really not interested in me? Not the tiniest bit? It seemed I could still feel his hand in my hair, the warmth of his touch on my scalp - and the sudden cold, now that he was gone.
John blushed at Sherlock’s reaction and stuttered, “It’s, well…it’s noting, really. Just something I wanted to…”
As if she’d been waiting to be summoned by her problematic lodger, Mrs. Hudson immediately opened her door and stepped out. “What is it? Oh, hello John.” Mrs. Hudson smiled, obviously pleased to see them together.
Grabbing Sherlock’s arms, John shouted up into his face. “It’s not just my income, you cock. It’s our income. It’s our job now, not just yours.”
"So you are Doctor Watson," he greeted me, shaking my hand, "I do not think we had the pleasure of meeting each other yet. I am the cook here. "
The man who’d discovered Sherlock sleeping in the truck appeared. Frank continued, “Take this skinny puke home. Tell Martha to feed him and put him to work. He can scrub the toilets or something. Tell her to keep him busy until I get home.” He glowered at Sherlock. “Make yourself useful, Billy, or I will make that phone call.”
No matter how hard he tried, he didn’t manage to completely dispel my doubts; there were just too many tiny details that didn’t fit together - his long absence, after he had been so eager to rescue Jonah, his sudden appearance here in the monastery, and especially the detail that was so obvious, that it was not just me who would have noticed.
I left his office almost two hours later. Talking with Father Andrew was like a therapy session: I felt neither insecure nor pressured, had he had not assigned me any new tasks that I had to do in the next two weeks. The only task that lay ahead of me, I had taken on myself - I would look for Brother William.
