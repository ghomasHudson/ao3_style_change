“Oh yeah, definitely. He’s always liked movies and TV shows. He wasn’t much of a gamer before he got sick though, but since he’s been confined to his rooms, he’s gotten into a bunch of them. Him and Charlie spend hours together going on adventures and battling monsters,” Benny’s voice sounds fond, affectionate even.
“A couple of hours at least, it’s slow going, I’ll try not to be too late.”
“20min?”
Gabe climbed onto the bed and straddled Castiel’s legs, sliping gently behind Dean, shifting in close as possible to encircle him. He quickly slipped the mask over Dean's face, pulling the straps tight and activating the Aphroxil gas in one smooth motion.
Castiel nods, clearly disappointed.
to this by now, he still doesn’t like them. It’s that all he can see while Cas is working on him is his own legs forced up and out, his body completely aroused, exposed and open. Cas knows all this and still straps him in every time, still pulls his legs apart and shifts his hips just right, so that he has maximum access. And sometimes, if he strains too much trying to see, Cas will sigh, sounding all disappointed and get out the head strap, clipping it to the headrest and pulling it tight across his forehead. Reminding him to relax and trust him, just let it happen, let go, submit. And Dean will remember how much he wants it, would feel regret if he missed this, filling some basic instinctual need, but sometimes it takes a while.
“Chocolate?”
Last thing he said was too slurred to hear properly, but I’m pretty sure he wasn’t even talking to me. He was muttering ‘Mary’ over and over and ignoring me. I begged him to stop, begged him to slow down. But he wouldn’t.
“Don’t touch it! If you dislodge it Cas is going to be so pissed.”
The problem with Dominants, Castiel learned, is that they always want to believe they’re in control.
He’d spent almost a year in that centre, recovering his health and learning how to make sure he never got that sick again. He was given intensive Dynamic Therapy, hormone stabilisation medications and taught how to monitor and control his Dominant needs.
“What’s your plans for today?” he asked curious. Mostly on Thursdays Dean worked from home, though lately he’d been going in more often to work with some students on a particular project for the university’s anniversary. Dean doesn’t like to go out as much when he has particularly obvious attachments. Although it’s perfectly acceptable for an Omega to need extra support at times, but the particular methods that Castiel uses are unusual enough to draw some uncomfortable questions. Luckily most of the students and fellow staff are familiar now with Castiel and his methods, they see the benefit his guidance has had on one of their most popular teachers.
Please comment, tell me what you think!
“Hush,” Gabe runs a hand down Dean’s arm, “He needs to get clean too. He’s right there, not going anywhere. Plus you’ll feel better afterwards I promise.”
“I mean it too. I do trust you, and I won’t unless I need to. Thank you Gabe.”
“What are we up to today?”
He dreams of terrifying hands crawling all over him, bodies pressed against him, pressed inside him. He hears his own voice, begging. He dreams of the man, his voice whispering to him of how good he was being. He remembers being pleased, wanting it. Sick with it.
“Horrific. You know what heats are like for him now? Well, think that but worse, so so much worse. They knew it was coming, weeks before and tried to prepare us, but how do you prepare for that? For watching your brother sick with it, begging and begging for it but too exhausted to even move, do anything but beg and moan in pain. And all I could do was watch, I’m a beta so I couldn’t help him in any way, even though they let me in the room to comfort him, it did nothing. It was so awful! They couldn’t use an actual alpha, he’d refused, so they soaked the room in artificial pheromones. Gave him patches and injections to help with it. They tried toys, their hands, even a weird machine to get him through it.
INTERLUDE PART 3
“Yes, of course,” Sam honestly sounded relieved to be escaping the difficult conversation, “Right this way. I’ll call Charlie to show you the way, she’s been assigned to help you during your stay here;”
“No. I should have….maybe if I had….” He’s cut off by Castiel before he can form that thought.
Suddenly he was pissed, anger and resentment surging up and raging out his mouth. He screamed, angry and defiantly, struggling hard against the bench, the harness, even Cas's gentle hands. He screamed and screamed, right in Castiel's fucking face, furious and desperate. He wanted that thing out of him, Right Now!
“It’ll be something small,” Jess reassures Dean, “Private.”
Cas waits, letting Sam sort it all out in his head.
“I’ll always give you what I promise, I’d give you anything.” he says, looking directly into Dean’s eyes like a challenge, before he shifts, pushing Dean backwards and easing him onto the soft bed. Then he crawls between Dean’s legs, leveraging his back up against the pillows and parting his legs gently, kissing his way down from the knee till he reaches the cage, blessedly stopping before touching the plastic. Dean knows that even with the release earlier that would still be too much.
"I'll come back in a couple more hours."
Cas’s eyes met his, an unspoken, unhappy agreement passed between them.
“He ran away?”
But, he supposed, if Dean particularly liked it, he might consider using it sometimes as a reward.
“I’m sorry, I just needed to make sure.”
“I know.” Dean says, weakly stopping Cas’s protestations, “but I thought that then.”
Cas doesn’t comment as he encircles Dean in his arms, his chest pressing comfortingly against his back. The warmth from the shower he obviously just took still radiating from his skin.
“I’m not sure. I didn’t think to ask, sorry.”
“Cas?” Dean’s voice was already a bit rough, but at least he was still mostly lucid.
He never refused to wear it, or even put up much of a fuss, but he also got all fidgety and jumpy when it came time to put it on. And he’d get this embarrassed, anxious look on his face like he was expecting something bad to happen. Once he learned that he would always have to be harnessed and leashed whenever he left the estate, he just stopped asking to go outside.”
Castiel arrives.
“No,” Sam confirmed, “They kept him at the hospital while they looked for next of kin. Dean told them he was an orphan. So, they got a judge’s permission to DNA test him and search the government databases. They got a hit immediately. Dad’s investigators had been monitoring the kinship databases for years. We got our lawyers out there the same day.”
Dean shook his head, “How do you want me?”
The rest of the space is taken up with the heat or medical equipment of various shapes and dimensions. He understood why Dean never came in here outside of his Heats, it’s really quite daunting looking at all this stuff, needed or not.
“What for?” the confusion clear in his eyes.
“Yes, though Charlie didn’t recognise him and she knows most of our friends.”
“I was being unfair.” Sam continues, oblivious to Castiel’s frustrations, “I know it’s the illness and that he can’t help it. It’s just hard to not feel rejected.”
“You know we do.”
Ripped it around and flipped the car. I can...I can still feel that motion sometimes, like I’m on a fucked up kids ride, rollercoaster flipping me again and again, like it would never end. But it did. And then I remember the silence of the empty road and my heartbeat louder that I’ve ever heard it before, like some fucking hammer beating down on my chest. Till there was nothing but that beat, and then nothing at all.
This facility was state of the art and clearly incredibly well funded.
“Well anyway, they got us into supported housing and Dean on a program. He had to step down off the suppressants, painfully slowly too, over about eight months. They had him come into the OSP Centre every day while I was in class. They taught him stuff he’d missed out on and put him into therapy sessions with other omegas. They helped me too, sending over a support person to teach me how to help him and just to talk with about it all.”
“Ok, let’s get you on your side,” said Gabe, as much to Cas as Dean, who took the hint, turning both himself and Dean so they were face to face, resting against the pillow.
He can feel it building, almost imperceptible clenches of those internal muscles that precede the crash, he speeds up, edging towards it.
He was going too fast. I knew he...I knew what he wanted to do.
Dean nods, his breath catching but grips the bars firmly.
“If he gets results, then yes.” John grit out, resigned, “Within limits, I’ll allow it.”
“How long until you noticed the symptoms returning?”
He remembers seeing Castiel just once before they’d been contracted, but that was enough, enough to light the flicker, kindle sometime waiting deep. Though he can’t explain it, something in that nothing and otherwise insignificant moment changed everything.
Sam arrives just after eleven. He’s smiling cheerfully but looks exhausted enough to collapse, a whole day’s work and a long drive will do that to you. Cas knows Sam hates flying but it cuts so terribly into the limited time Sam and Dean have together, it frustrates Cas a little.
“Think you can talk yet?”
Cas sighs, “Bathroom, then we’ll have to exhaust him again before he’ll settle. I won’t use more Aphraxil yet. He needs a break"
“Please.” He’s not begging but it’s close.
Dean gets a reward. Short but hopefully sweet.
“Cas? It’s Charlie. Dean’s having a panic attack. What do I do?” Dean can’t hear the reply but Cas must be talking her through it.
Dean's breath slowed back down, forced in and out at a regular pace.
“You. You inside me tonight, I don’t want to come but I want you, us together. Please!” his voice breaks a little, showing his weakness. He misses Cas inside him, the connection. He doesn’t want to go back to bed tonight and just have them fall asleep in eachothers arms. He wants more, needs more.
“I’m not mad. We weren’t together then and you were trying to connect with your father, it’s understandable.”
New tags for Chastity Device and Orgasm Denial.
“Good morning,” Cas leans in for a kiss, “Thank you for making breakfast.”
Gabe can see his tension,“Just relax man, let it happen.” he says, flopping down beside him on the sofa and pulling out his tablet.
Dean groans audibly and relieved, more bruises added to Cas’s thighs, as he fights the urge to touch, to disobey.
Warnings: references to minor characters death, mental and physical illness, grief
He's so distracted by the pleasure of it that he almost doesn't notice the pressure and push, up into his second passage. The plastic thrusting up deeply at first, what he can only imagine was several inches all at once.
“Okay,” Cas kisses each palm before guiding it down to his waist, pulling tight the wrist cuffs he’d attached to the belt earlier, his hands resting comfortably at his sides.
He had been so thankful to them, so pleased to learn. He’d spent months developing his skills in all manner of Dominance training, diligently copying his trainers and studying every technique he could find. Desperate to feel the rush and experience the beauty of someone submitting to him, he’d begged them to allow him to start working with submissives directly and they’d agreed. He soon began doing simple scenes with the Submissive Dynamic Therapists, perfecting practical skills, more importantly building his confidence as a Dominant. He flew through their program, his scores sky-high on every test they set, every scene he ran was better than the last. They even started allowing him to assist with other patients, his confidence grew and grew.
(See the end of the chapter for
Then Gabe gently pushed him forward till he lay resting encircled in Castiel’s arms. His knees were still bent forward underneath him, exposing his passages. Gabe breathed out relieved to see nothing more than warm pink skin, slightly swollen but otherwise healthy. Gently he slid in the dildo, working the pump slowly to inflate the knot. Dean moaned low and needy, but Cas shushed him. The knot would hold off the next wave of need, at least for a few hours.
“Seriously Cas why can’t we do this on a weeknight? Like Wednesday night, Wednesdays are boring, I would love to do this on Wednesdays. It would make my day seriously! Wednesday!” he pulls the cover tighter over his eyes, daylight sucks.
He could tell the gas was working once Dean slumped against him, his fight giving way to exhaustion, to obedience.
“Not a design I am completely happy with, but since it’s only for a few more days. I think it’ll do. If this works for us, we’ll get something custom made.” Cas is playing with the device, checking there are no rough edges or sharp spots, distracted for a moment. He reaches under the table and retrieving an ice pack and shaking it casually. And then Dean isn’t so sure for a moment, the ice looking mightily cold.
So now when Dean hears them, he breathes deeply. Knowing the hardest part is to come. “I know. I’m ready.”
Benny thought quietly for a moment, “No, I think it's the leash. He's scared of being tied to someone else and having to trust them to look after him. I think he's had some bad experiences in the past when he's had to trust others and rely on them not to take advantage. I worry he's not been treated very well."
Gabe flicked his eyes to the TV screen, all was calm right then. Cas had Dean on his back, was positioned over him and working in and out with the minute thrusts that signified they were knotted. Dean had his arms and legs around him, pulling them together, holding him so tightly that it left little room for Cas to move at all. He was looking at Cas though with a tenderness that spoke volumes. He had everything he wanted, right there in his arms.
He drags Dean's arms back up above his head and fastened his hands around the metal frame.
“Okay,” Cas said, more to himself than Dean, “Okay. Just… just give me a moment.”
Having finished reading the small amount of information available on the topic he clicked through to the ‘Dynamic Spectrum’ page, curious to see if Wikipedia had been updated yet with the newest Scientific Research on the topic.
"Don’t just endure it if it’s makes you feel unsafe and don’t do it for me.”
“It says here that you were severely dehydrated and underweight as well as suffering from shock and extreme post-heat syndrome. I’m not surprised it took that long for your body to recover enough for you to regain consciousness,” Cas notes.
“I’ve asked Charlie to be his guide. She can help him and show him around,”
“Some.” But Cas needed it confirmed, “How did it start?”
He uncapped the tube and showed Cas, “He needs to swallow all of it.”
He helped him up then and led him over to the couch where he had already set up a gravity bag on an IV stand. Settling him against the cushions, he attached the bag, cleared the tube and toggled it to slowly flow down inside him.
“How do you usually do this with Cas?”
He breathes, controls the in and out in carefully counted pace. It's enough for Cas to notice, he pauses, smiles at Dean reassuringly
Castiel knows that bitter pill too, he’s had to swallow it himself a few too many times. That particularly grim form of desperation that comes from working in hospices and end-stage wards, when you realise that you’re out of options and out of your depth.
“Could be anyone. I could make a guess but honestly, you’ll have to ask Dean that one himself…” he trails off before building courage once more “But the rest, yeah, I’ll tell you what I can.”
“Ok,” Cas sighs, “Ok. Gabe, you can give us a little space now. I'll need you in a couple of hours so stay close. The cctv is on and I have this,” He holds up his wrist to show the wireless alert bracelet, “I'll press when I need you.”
“No!” Dean couldn't seem to control the level of his voice, “I can’t wait any longer. Please Cas!”
“In the circumstances, I completely understand the urgency.” Castiel reassured him,"with someone as unwell as Dean, it's a necessity to act quickly."
Cas takes pity and releases him, but only to slide his hand down to massage his balls. Casually he slips his other hand down further, seeking the first passage, sure to be slick with need. He eases a couple of fingers inside in search of that other spot, that place that soon has Dean begging again and forcing his back to arch up and out, causing his feet to momentarily lose traction on the bottom of the tub so he jolts down slightly before he catches himself, serving only to plant himself even more firmly on the now three fingers working themselves steadily in and out of him.
“Has Novak arrived yet?”
“Sure. I’m not certain if he’s always had them, or if they’re a symptom of his DDS, but they’re definitely getting worse. He’s particularly sensitive to texture, sound, taste and touch. He struggles with loud noises and bright lights, although he didn’t used to have major issues with those. Taste has been a constant problem, but recently it’s gotten so bad that, this morning we had to fit him with an NG tube. And boy, did he kick up a fuss about that!” Benny grimaces.
“Alright, you can keep them,” Dean ignores him, preferring to close his eyes and soak up warmth for the moment.
“You need the bathroom first?”
He wanted to touch himself, touch something, reach between his own legs and feel the long cylinder of plastic as it slid deeper and deeper, reach down into the machine and measure with his fingers how much more there was to go, how many inches still waiting patiently to work it's way inside. He wanted to ask but couldn't, unable to speak. And he wanted to touch his belly, to see if he could actually feel the thing each time it pushed up and up. He clenched his teeth and fought the straps again, knowing it was futile.
“Thank you Charlie. Thank you for being there for him.” he sounds so genuine, suddenly so upset about it all. Dean can’t hear Charlie’s reply or even if she gave one, but he can hear the steps she takes closer to Castel, the gentle brush of their clothes as she pulls him into a hug.
“Almost baby.”
“No, I don’t think that’s necessary. Not yet anyway. I’ll handle it. I’m actually calling because I need you to tell me everything you know about what led up to Dean getting put under the OSP contract. He’s told me a little and there is some information in his file. But honestly, I need to hear the whole truth. I can’t help him unless I know.”
“Jerk,” Dean’s smirk catches the edge of his words, “honestly, I’m good.”
Castiel knows that for most people, whether a Dominant ‘guides’ or ‘takes’ is a nuance, it’s semantic, it’s splitting hairs. The problem is that for a tiny percentage of the population, like Nick (who couldn’t let anyone, but his wife take him down) and Dean (who likely experiences his headspace through fear and pain) the reality is that it’s a matter of life and death.
He fixed Dean with a look that told him exactly what was expected. Dean sighed, and finally shifted back against his pillows.
the textbooks called it.
Castiel did know. Dynamic Disorders were often triggered by trauma, abuse, or neglect. He had hoped, that considering the substantial resources and effort they were investing in his care, this wouldn’t be the case here. But he’s starting to think Dean’s background might be a lot more complicated than he had initially assumed.
He knew Cas wore his own matching necklace and wristband but, he didn’t push Dean into wearing his and he was eternally grateful for that.
Earlier that morning, as part of their usual Heat preparations Cas had inserted an IV catheter in Dean's arm but hadn’t yet hooked him up to anything. In the past, they had discussed the possibility of fitting Dean with something more permanent but felt it was premature at this point.
“Shall we head over to your office?”
Dean snorted and gestured to the tape holding the tube across his cheek, “Not with this sticking out of my face, I don’t,” there was no malice in it, something closer to annoyance.
He opened the cupboard labelled restraints and pulled out the first of the many harnesses they would use, this one designed for sleeping. It was quite different from the setup in their bedroom, instead of securing Dean down to the mattress it locked around him tightly, legs and arms held together, tight and safely immobile.
He found Dean first since he’d run out thinking it was Dad home from work, the man even managed cut him, on his thigh, I’m sure you’ve see the mark.”
The ice pack is back and before he can say a word it’s pressed against him, eliciting a shout and a curse.
“There won’t be one. I trust you.”
He pulls off Dean, walking quickly over the the chest and opens it. He eyes the contents critically and decides, in for a penny in for a pound. He reaches in, scoops out the lot.
“Almost there sweetheart. I want to feel you as well as see you come,” he says wanting Dean to have the full simultaneous orgasm possible only for Omegas, knowing Dean struggles with it, but he wants to give him this. Make him know just how good it can be.
Dean is familiar enough with it now to know that doesn’t help much but it’s all Cas can offer. He balls up his courage and remind himself that he wants this, damn it, stop being such as pussy!
But we know that he was definitely already experiencing symptoms, because we spoke to his old boss. He said Dean was often off work or came in late, nausea, fever, headaches, pains, all the classic early symptoms of DDS. He was also drinking a lot by that point. Dean didn’t have money for doctors or the inclination to seek medical assistance, so we think he was self-medicating for the pain.”
“A few days. Just to give it a try this time. Three at most.”
Last night had been so nice that all he wants to do is ignore the new day. Friday nights were always indulgent; watching movies snuggled together on the sofa and long baths soaking in eachothers arms.  But Saturdays... Saturdays meant his weekly physical and any tests Cas might want to run, it meant new obedience and body movement exercises were taught. And though he groaned and moaned because right now all Dean wanted to do was sleep, he knew that once he was up, he would totally be into it. But, right now, now the blankets were soft and all he wanted to do was cuddle back together and ignore the day for a little bit longer.
Of course, the words meant something else entirely now. Now they meant safety and home. Because Castiel had refused to let him shut down, refused to let him hide inside his own mind and let the numbing agony quiet him. Cas had in his unfailing dedication drawn him back out and convinced him to live. Even if he hadn’t always gone quietly, or calmly for that matter.
Please do tell me what you think! I genuinely like to know which parts people like and which parts they're not fussed on. Helps me become a better writer and judge the direction a fic should go in (I have the basic plot mapped out, I'm looking more at the tone of the writing and the kinks!), especially when I'm writing out of my comfort zone as I am with this fic. So please comment, comment, comment!
“Dean, I need you to listen to me and follow my instructions, just like we’ve practiced,” Dean nods, desperate for anything, any way to escape this, but he thinks he’s about to pass out. He takes Dean’s hands and places them, one on his chest and the other lower on his stomach. He rests his hands over Dean's, a warm reminder.
“I hate it.”
Dean cleared his throat roughly, it had been hard work out there and while he wasn’t technically thirsty, his mouth felt dry and a little rough. Castiel wordlessly retrieved a glass of ice chips for him and rubbed his back encouragingly.
They then learned that his devoted father had found him just in time, and rescued him from the clutches of the heartless government who had imprisoned and abused him. Then a kindly judge who understood that poor Dean needed to be sheltered and protected from the rest of society (and from himself), and had placed him under the loving protection of Caladh House. The story ended with his heartwarming return to The Harbour, where he would be loved, cared for and protected for the rest of his life.
“Fuck!” he wants to move away but as always the straps hold tight. “Uhhh!” he had been so hard that the ice felt like a knife, slicing away the skin, or a burn, cold as dry ice.
Dean looked relieved, “I think so,”
On one side of the bedroom door, there was a hand basin and shelf with hand towels, which Benny walked over to and began scrubbing his hands. There was a window between the living area and the bedroom, large enough that both Benny and he could stand side-by-side looking inside.
He can’t help it though and unconsciously shifts again against the speculum, even the small movement sending sparks up his spine and forcing him to bite back a moan, not wanting Cas to stop what he’s doing. He doesn’t mind being up on the table, actually loves being the centre of Cas’s entire focus for the several hours every Saturday morning, but that doesn’t meant he doesn’t struggle with the position.
“I’m sorry, that wasn’t the right thing to do was it?” Dean shook in his arms, clinging tightly for reassurance, his head shaking against Castiel’s skin, “I won’t do that again. Okay? I promise.”
“Lean over.” Gabe reached behind Dean's head and pulls the tape off of tube and checks the end. He grabbed the PH kit and tested the tube gently.
Cas was up almost immediately, rushing to his side.
For most submissives, going down is instinctive, like breathing. They constantly want it, crave it, because for them it’s an escape and a release. It feels so good and right that they genuinely don’t realise that unconsciously or not, they’re making the choice to drop every single time they go down, that their Dominant is just the guide. Submissives who were raised accepting their headspaces can’t understand why anyone would fear and reject it. For most, it does genuinely feel like their Dominants are fully in control and they’ll thank their Dominants for ‘forcing’ or ‘taking’ them down.
And then he would need to choose to submit again....
The alarm startled Gabe just as he was dozing off, the sharp tone jolting him awake with the harsh kick of adrenaline.
“Dude! I need to breathe!” gasps Sam, amusement colouring the moment.
“If I try to be quick?”
“Charlie? Are you sure?” John tried to keep the disbelief out of his voice. Charlie was Neutral. She might know the correct information, but she had no practical experience with the sort of ‘Pure’ level protocols Castiel would be expected to abide by. Hell, almost no-one did, Pure dominants were just so rare. But that was the point he supposed, in that sense Charlie was as good as anyone.
"Not since we've kept him isolated. It's the main reasons we made that decision. We’re doing our best to keep illness away from him, but we’re quite concerned about the development of immune deficiency syndromes.”
He was vaguely familiar with Society Houses, but just like everyone else, most of what he knew came from movies and popular culture. Castiel wasn’t sure how much of what he had heard reflected reality and what was a myth as they were notoriously restrictive and rarely allowed non-members access to their private spaces.
“ I just...”
But nuance always loses to ego.
"Also affection, especially public displays of affection," Benny offers, "All the books say that Pure Subs need lots of physical contact and affection to remain stable, especially doing stressful events like when they are required to go out in public. Sam and John were always careful to follow the medical advice of keeping almost constant physical contact with Dean whenever they were out in public with him. They'd take his hand, sit him in their lap, pull him into their arms, swing an arm around his waist, the usual stuff you do with any submissive, but Dean really seemed to dislike it."
he thinks but for some reason isn’t up to speaking out loud. His nervousness palpable in the room.
“That’s it. Try to sleep a little. We’ll both be right here.” he pitched his tone low, soothing.
Gabe ran his hands through his hair and grimaced. He’d really rather not interrupt them while they were tied, but there was nothing for it though, he had to or risk worse
“Maybe?” he grunts out from his pile of blankets.
“How was Sam?” Castiel enquired, sipping contentedly on a cup of coffee, Dean wanted nothing more than to yank it out of his stupid hands and gulp it down in one hit. Instead he shoved his hands in his pockets, slumping back down in his seat at the table.
“Hmmm....” Cas pretends to think it over but he’d already known this would be coming, Dean always had a problem showing any weakness to Sam, “I tell you what. You pass the physical tomorrow morning, a weigh-in on Sunday and if it all looks good, you can have it out then.”
Gabe first leveraged his own legs against Dean’s, pressing them together before pulling the weighted blanket over both of them and tucking it tight around their legs. Then he reached around and moved Dean’s arms more securely under his own armpits and eased his head back to rest against his shoulder before he pulled him close, both arms around Dean’s chest, holding him steady and firmly against him.
“Is that why you didn’t inform the OSP about him?”
Castiel finished the massage with the base of Dean’s feet, working the sore spots until he could feel them release under his fingers. Dean was placid like this, calm like he almost never got to be in normal life. With his job and the pressures he placed on himself, this was an indulgence he almost never got, or gave himself. Cas hopes to remedy that in time but until then, he worked at making the most of these hard fought moments, let Dean unwind for now and let it all go.
“And you didn’t tell Sam?”
“Said he didn’t need babysitting. That he was fine without it. But it worked you know. Dean got so much better, they made sure he was taking his meds, ate right, looked after himself, even got him started on the sculpture and art track. There was a woman there who took him to galleries and art shows, worked with him on developing his own style. And when he was ready they got him into classes at the local college, just a couple at first then more as he grew more confident. He did so well with it all, with people who actually knew how to look after him.”
He clicked through to the page on The Harbour Society. He knew that The Harbour was one of the oldest and wealthiest of The Societies. It was also one of the most desirable and elite. He admitted that he was curious, he’d never considered joining one himself, but he was looking forward to the opportunity to gain an insight into an alternative way of living.
Dean was pacing back and forth at the end of the the bed, rubbing his palms up and down his hips in an obvious self soothing motion. Cas was sitting on the end of it, hands out trying to calm him but no longer touching him at all. The distance between them obviously painful.
Dean shudders against him. Goes still. Breath ragged, shaking, shivering.
Charlie turned to Sam, “Benny also said to tell you that he probably won’t be able to join you for lunch today, he sends his regrets,”
“Better?”
The problem, his professors had explained, was that no one actually wants to believe it. We want submission and domination to be easy to understand, give and take, black and white, but it’s not. And unless we keep that in mind, people are going to die.
And though he didn’t picture the day including Sam walking beside the gurney, tear reddened eyes and hand clasping his tight and warm. Or the gentle, kind expression on the face of the man, forehead creased with worry as they loaded him into the ambulance for transport. He did expect the numbness to burn through him, apathy searing away the despair, shutting him down. Finally, he’d thought to himself, finally it’s happened, I can stop fighting now, I can give up.
Cas sighs, losing patience for the weekly token protests, and grumbling. He knows eventually Dean will get on board, he just needs time to wake up fully.
Eventually the words filtered back in, Cas’s voice soothing and calm, sounding like he’d been speaking for quite a while.
So much could easily go wrong!
But he understood why, that even though there were lots of things that he hated that Cas did anyway, it was only because he had to. Because Castiel knew that without it, there was no way he could get through his heats without damaging himself.
“I’ll be right back.”
“Do you think..is it ok if…” he looks across at the door as if Sam might walk through it at any moment when he knows full well that Sam won’t be there till much later.
"Soon, he's holding it together, but it won't be for long," Cas's warm, breath brushing past Dean's ear as he spoke.
“That would be awesome. I'm free but let me just check if Cas has anything on.”
It’ll be fine Gabe told himself, he could always call the OSP if he needed too. But that didn’t stop the gnawing worry settling deep in his chest.
“Do we really have to do this?”
“Dean,” Castiel gently wipes his hair back from his forehead, smiling warmly at him as he crouched beside his side of the bed, “You need to get up. We have a lot to get through today.”
“But the cracks started to show?”
Then he checked over the room, setting the air conditioner to cool it slightly and flicked off the lights everywhere except over the bed. Dean didn’t need the reminder of the rest of the room until he was too far gone to care.
“I’m going to feed you now. But you can sleep if you like.” Dean is already dropping off before Cas has even finished speaking, his vision blurring before blackness sweeps across everything.
“Hey Cas!” he yelled over the screech of welding equipment and power tools. He dropped the drill, happy for the break.
“Well ok then! Let’s do this thing.” The earnestness in his voice settling Dean’s nerves more than any drug could ever hope to.
Cas liked CRP frames. He liked their function and simplicity. He liked that they provided submissives with a safe way to experience the intensity of complete immobility, while also allowing Doms with a safe restraint method through the quick release straps. They were expensive, but easy to maintain and very durable. Medically speaking they were also excellent at keeping the sub safe and calm them during necessary procedures (such as the insertion of a catheter, cannula or feeding tube etc).
Cas pulls out the familiar file and contemplates his options. He knows Dean’s going to need reassurance and grounding, some way to stay connected to the present moment when the past threatens. Something physical he thinks, something to tether his control to, something steady. The blindfold is therefore out and he needs to speak, so a gag can’t be used. He looks around the room considering before laying his eyes on the heavy wooden chair settled in the corner.
“Dean, it’s almost 11, we really should start your physical.”
A sad conversation with Sam
Castiel made himself some toast and coffee, sitting down across from him and opening up the newspaper. He handed Dean the sports section and kept the international news for himself. They sat quietly for a while, enjoying the calm before the storm of their busy lives engulfs them. Castiel looked up for a moment and caught Dean eyeing the mug of coffee enviously, he’d normally have gulped his own down greedily by now and was probably feeling the lack of caffeine keenly. When he first met him, Dean had been consuming six to nine cups a day and had built up a significant tolerance for the stuff. Cas had cut him back to two cups a day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon after the effects of the first had worn off. But, it couldn’t be helped really and Castiel wasn’t going to bend his rules for simple cravings so he ignored it, finishing off his own cup quickly enough and putting it in the dishwasher.
Cas worked his way up the spine until he reached Dean’s neck and then fanned out, sure fingers finding every knot, ache and tension in the muscles and guiding them back to complete relaxation. It’s a feat few have time for but his patience is seemingly eternal when it comes to Dean. Dean knew he enjoyed seeing him pliant and needy that’s exactly what he became. Arching up into the touch, letting him guide him under into utter languid calm, a quiet submission under his hands.
They both ignored Gabe, who took the opportunity to leave before the next round really got started. But not before placing more bottled water on the side table and taking one more look at Dean's vitals.
He knows he should still be angry, pissed that they did this to him, but he can't make himself feel it anymore. Something needy takes over, something deep inside his mind that desperately wants to please unfurls and blocks out all the pain and rage. Instead he just feels a familiar, aching fullness, pleased that his alpha was buried deep inside him. Warmth at the knowledge that he was right where his alpha wanted him to be.
I just want to touch, he desperately wished he could tell them, I won't try to stop it, I just want to feel it, please! But as always, his mind and body refused to cooperate. Speech was difficult at the best of times, let alone now when it felt like every time he shifted the thing sensed whatever small space it could take and moved to fill it, it forced more and more air out of his body.
Dean huffs out a pleased laugh, he hadn't done anything! But can't help smiling around the tube in his mouth into the crook of Castiel's neck, the compliment sending electric signals singing through his mind and body.
“No!”
“Then he waved his gun at me, said I was just a worthless piece of ass and a bitch, only good for alpha cock. He said he wished I had never even been born but that he had been too weak to end me, should have. Said he gave up trying to fix me. Said he was done and I should give myself over to it or die, said it was all I was worth.
“Yeah," quietly, almost a whisper, "Yeah ok.”
“Anyway, one night he got into a bar fight with the wrong off-duty cop. He was arrested for Aggravated Assault and Resisting Arrest, and because he already had a record, he was denied bail. He spent the next few months locked up awaiting trial. By then the symptoms had progressed to the point that even the prison warden was getting concerned, so when he collapsed, they took to hospital instead of treating him in the there. Thankfully, the emergency room doctors recognised the symptoms of Dynamic Definiency Syndrome (DDS) and ran the DSPD blood test.”
“Ok, here we go.” he said as he attached the bag, “How fast should I set this?”
Sam looked down at the object in his hands, he had picked up a picture frame from the side of his desk and was looking at the image of a brown-haired woman. Her eyes and face were smiling, easy and bright, her mouth open as if she’d been about to speak just as the photograph was taken, “This is my mother. She died giving birth to me, and Dad never remarried, so I was raised an only child. I always hoped we’d find him so I could have a brother.”
“Let’s just start from the beginning and work our way forward. What was he like as a kid?”
Once Dean was finished, Gabe gave him a moment to gather himself, spending just a little too long washing his hands and readying the equipment.
“Dean was raised by her? Outside of the Society?” Castiel was sure there was probably much more to the story, and he would investigate that later, but he needed to keep on topic.
Gabe guides Dean over to the giant shower stalls in the corner and helps him inside. Cas follows them in, carrying a set of waterproof cuffs which he clips around Dean’s wrists before releasing the rest of the harness.
“Ok,”  Gabe nodded at Cas.
Gabe can see that it’s working, but not enough. He grabs a second canister of Aphroxil and fits it into the other side of the mask. Setting the flow speed high. Then he prepped a sedative, readying it for a shot, but Cas stopped him, shaking his head.
“Yeah, that would do it.” Sam sighs, “Look Cas. I’m happy to fly up early, I can be on the morning flight out...”
”I’m going to unstrap you now,” Cas warns but it’s casual, purposefully mild “Don’t move just yet.”
Gabe woke to the sound of raised voices, he winced, Dean’s throat was going to be completely raw by the end of this if he was determined to start at that volume.
“Dean? Are you ok?” It’s Charlie, Dean can hear her steps quickly approaching, she’s practically running, reading from his body language that he’s really not ok.
Gabe stepped into the room and held his hands out, telegraphing his movements as he made his way over to Dean. This was expected as well, he knew what he needed to do.
“But you got me and I’m thankful for that every single day,”
He squinted at the CCTV feed, Cas was on top of Dean, all his weight pinning down the younger man. Only the smallest movement of Cas’s hips indicating that they were knotted. But Dean was staring up at nothing, eyes glazed over, unfocused.
“As I explained when we spoke on the phone, part of my role here will be working with all the people closest to Dean, which will primarily be you and John. To help him recover, you will both need to participate in his treatment directly, but also to engage with me in therapy yourselves.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Ok, we're ready."
“I know you do. And once this is over I’m going to be better at enforcing more regular meals and forcing you to finish what you have. We’ll do it together.”
“Fuck!,” Dean practically growls.  Gabe winces at how ragged his voice sounds.
The rest of the day had been spent easily enough. Cas had woken him after an hour or so and gotten him up and into the training room for some basic obedience exercises. He hadn’t worked Dean too hard, just some basic crawling techniques and stress positions, knowing that Dean was already feeling pretty vulnerable. Then they’d had dinner and Dean had watched a movie while Cas read through some research papers on Omega fertility. Dean knew that Cas was still looking for something to help him but he no longer commented, not wanting to build any unfounded hope. If Cas found anything, he’d tell him.
“And through here,” Benny swiped his card and scanned his fingerprint on the sensor, “Is Dean’s rooms.”
“Do you have a lot more work to do today?”
And there it was. Cas knew it would come up eventually, the return of the infamous John Winchester, the man behind this whole mess. Because just like that, after years of nothing, like some ghost that refuses to stop haunting him, he showed up in Dean’s life again to destroy what he had built.
Dean nodded, he remembered the instruction from this morning. Gabe slid his hand down between Dean’s legs, laying his palm flat along his pelvis, not the most accurate position, which was internal but enough for him to feel if Dean was doing the exercises properly.
This uncomfortable tube was as close as he got, it could be excused as medically necessary, as anything really but the mark of a Dominant Alpha who loved him. He just wished he was strong enough to do more.
“Shhh…” Cas comforted, “Keep your breathing steady, that’s it. Just ignore us. Focus on keeping yourself calm.”
All the pieces were in place, he just had to keep Dean Winchester alive for one more year.
Castiel was looking at him with a vaguely troubled expression.
“I did,” the smile that greets him, brighter and more alive than Cas had ever hoped to see. He can remember the desperation he’d felt in those earliest days, of trying to break through Dean’s emptiness to find the man he knew existed underneath, the one he saw through his art. He remembers the first time Dean cared enough to resist his help with fondness, the first time Dean argued back had delighted him, and he remembers one morning the light streaming through their window and watching Dean lay himself down in the warm patch of sunlight on the rug, finally giving himself over to the simple pleasure of feeling.
“Look at you, being all open minded,” Gabe teased, falling back into his joking persona with practiced ease, relieved to hear that John, who was usually so strict on protocol, finally understood the need for compromise on this, at least somewhat, “You’re getting soft old man!”
Cas was rarely outwardly aggressive when in rut, instead focusing all his dominant urges towards Dean, generally through manhandling and controlling him physically. Not that Dean minded, he was well aware of their dynamic by now. Although Gabe had never assisted with their Heat before, he had watched the tapes carefully and discussed the matter with Cas. Worked out the best strategies to use while in the Rut phase.
“Yes, mostly," Castiel looked down at his phone, his hands trembling slightly, "Dean rang a few minutes ago, he’s having a bath and trying to keep calm. He thinks he’s about six hours in so we have a while yet before we need to get started.”
“I know sweetheart,” Cas was saying, gently brushing the hair back from his forehead, “I feel like such as asshole doing this to you. But you’ve got to believe me, it’ll be worth it. I promise.” The earnestness in his voice winning Dean over all over again.
Cas gave him a thoughtful look before he spoke,"That's not uncommon," he informed him gently, "There could be any number of reasons why he's had difficulties eating, most of them completely treatable."
They’re interrupted by the arrival of Cas and Jess as if called by magic (or maybe just the beeping of the oven).
“Hold these. Don’t let go until I say so.”
Sam picked up after only a couple of rings, his voice cheerfully warm on the other side of the line.
“I didn’t know that.”
Dean doesn’t reply, but instead snuggles down deeper into the blankets, getting comfortable. Cas takes this to mean he’s ready. He’s warmed the lube thankfully, so all Dean feels is the welcome intrusion of fingers making their way deep inside him. He bites back a little panting moan and tries unsuccessfully to think unsexy thoughts.
Happy times in the next chapter :)
“It’s fine,” Castiel interrupted gently, before she could work herself up too much over office furniture, “it has everything I need. Thank you.” He doubted he’d spend much time here, anyway. Most of his time would be spent with Dean or working with the family.
“I figured that you would. Ask me anything,”
Dean bucked up again, but got no traction at all, just managed to impale himself further as his bare feet slid against the soft silk sheets.
Cas knows he will be anyway, it’s only two days ago that he was struggling through panic and fear, the effects won’t have worn off so quickly. But, he doesn’t protest, he doubts Dean would get much sleep either way.
Dean visibly stiffened and bit back a growl but he did comply, crawling down the length of the bed from the base, forcing Cas to skirt backwards lest they collide.
Catching Cas’ eyes, Gabe held up the harness and received an exhausted nod in return. He also pulled out the blindfold, pheromone mask, earplugs and a knotting dildo.
Is the story making sense so far? Anything you'd like explained? Anything you'd like read more about? Please do comment and let me know what you think!!
Cas’s breath catches in horror. That is the absolute last drug Dean should ever be prescribed, with his history and medical needs it might have killed him. He can’t help the groan of disgust that escapes his lips, he’d known Dean had had unprotected sex, actually guessed he’d probably spent a heat outside the centre. But for anyone to give him Verindox was not only illegal but immoral.
He was back the next week and the one after that. For months, almost a year he'd had to return week after week as she and other doctors patiently and with the utmost care remade him.
He thanked Benny and then took a quiet breath, steadying himself to finally meet Dean. He didn’t knock, not wanting the harsh rapping sound to be the first thing Dean heard, instead he just opened the door and quietly walked inside.
It’s the longest seven minutes he has ever known, the world fades out of focus and all he can feel is the shooting agony and fear of the days, years before, they come crashing back and there is nothing he can do to escape it. His chest feels like someone has taken a knife to his ribs, slicing away at his flesh and bone. He knows he’s curled into himself, can feel all his muscles protesting as he gasps out his pain, knows it all in some distant, unreal way. If only the pain would stop.
“I’m going to take such good care of you,” he’d explained as he slipped into bed with him that night, careful not to disturb any of the attachments, “you’ll see.”
Cas brings him his ice chips, kisses him affectionately on the head before casually arranging the tubing.
In all the chaos of packing and sorting, he hadn’t had a moment spare to research the House itself. The only thing that he’d heard about Caladh House itself was that it was old and that it was powerful.
“Come on, a shower should help.” he said encouragingly, knowing Dean well enough by now that he didn’t bother argue, Dean will convince himself soon enough and nine o’clock really is late enough. He walked purposefully into the bathroom and started to pull out equipment, letting Dean work himself awake.
“Do an extra set for me later this morning when Gabe visits? You feel a little tense still, so he'll need to massage the internal muscles too,” Dean just nodded, he knew how important it was for him to keep his pelvix floor flexible and strong. Cas then slipped in both of Dean's daytime dilators, much smaller and more comfortable, designed to move with Dean’s body. They're more for monitoring purposes than anything else, as they had a full range of internal sensors.
“So you signed it?”
The truth was that Gabe had actually met him first, at one of the OSP’s fundraising events. Dean had agreed to auction off one of his works.....
Castiel gestures to the spare chair beside his examination table. Dean groans, of course they want to do this now, with him sitting there half naked, stuck listening to them discuss him in the most intimate detail.
As expected, Gabriel’s version of the story had spread like wildfire throughout all the Houses and soon everyone had learned the heartbreaking, but inspiring story of Pure Submissive Dean Winchester.
Even with the prior warning, Cas had known that this would hit him roughly. Dean expects so little happiness from life that every small piece of joy feels sharp and cruel, adding more weight to the things he might lose, the unfair but completely understandable expectation of it all being ripped away yet again. The possibility of losing it all just that much more painful to bare.
That night as Cas readies them for bed Dean turns, his voice demanding and plain.
“Damn! Where’d you learn this? I practically burn water.”
Gabe knows how hard it is to control Dean alone during his heat, later on they'll strap him down, but right now he has too much fight in him, too much desperation, he needs to get it out, to move. If he's immobilized now, he'll hurt himself fighting it. But, this small amount of privacy to feel a little normal, like Dean's heat isn't going to be the trial they all know it will, Gabe desperately wants to give both of them that.
“No. Couple of bruises and scrapes but nothing significant. I was out of the hospital after a day or so.”
They went down another corridor and Benny opened the door on the right, “These stairs lead up to your apartment. They’re biolocked and swipe card, so you’ll need to scan your fingerprint.”
“Even in our community, it’s really rare, only eight in every thousand. So, finding out that he was Pure, it felt like a fate. Also, he’s completely charming when he wants to be. Everyone adores him. For the three months he was healthy enough to publicly enter the community, he managed to win over half the residents here. I just wish he’d had more time to get to know us before it all went to hell. Now he’s just so sick… and angry, he’s just always so angry….” Sam peters off, obviously lost in thought and regret.
“Shit, shit come on then!” he said, leaning over the bowl and bracing himself against the back wall in an attempt to hold on a little longer.
And Cas does, working his way up from the straps around his ankles, calves, thighs, hips, chest and neck. He even adds the wrist and upper arm cuffs for good measure before holding out the final one. It’s a little different from the others as it has a wide padded panel at the front for Dean’s forehead and an extra strap on each side to hold it on firmly. He’d added that after Dean had struggled and shifted too much once and marked himself. Although the leather was lined, it was still enough to abrade the skin lightly, and any mark was more than Castiel allowed. This modification Dean doesn’t really like, it feels heavy-handed and a little claustrophobic, he frequently requests it be left off. This time though, he doesn’t comment, he meets Cas’s eyes and holds perfectly still for him to fasten the straps securely on each side of his head.
Cas drags back the covers and throws himself over Dean, pinning him down, holding him tight.
“Ok, I’ll ring him. You got drugs for this?”
“Got some lunch for you. You ready?” he said holding up the cooler.
Gabe pulls out the handheld showerhead and proceeds to wet Dean down with it. It’s not cold, but cool enough that to Dean it must feel shocking against his feverish skin. He gasps and draws in a ragged breath and stills, consciousness flickering back into his eyes.
“How long this time?”
“He got down to his last bottle. I came home to him sitting at the kitchen table with it, pulling long draws from the bottle and snarling at me. He told me that it should have been me, not her that died.” Dean’s voice is monotone, the only way he’s able to speak is to distance himself, Cas stays silent, letting him continue.
“They need to be arrested...I’ll call the…”
“Oh man! I’m so glad to see you and you look so good! I honestly didn’t think I’d ever see you again.”
"He's too lucid. Hey," Gabe shook his shoulder, "Are you hurting Dean?" Gabe asked, peering down at Dean's increasingly rapid heart rate with concern. Cas slid his hands up Dean's back, feeling the tension building there.
The man Dean is now and who he was then may as well be considered different people.
Castiel considers his response to this very carefully. He knows Dean is likely to have developed maladaptive behaviours in response to past traumas, in addition to triggers and anxieties that will require extensive therapeutic intervention. He's tempted to ask Benny whether Dean's told him anything specific from his history, but he knows he will need to tread extremely cautiously when it comes to unpacking Dean's past.
Gabriel knew that the absolute last thing John Winchester wanted to do was trust an outsider with the care of his vulnerable son, let alone a Progressive one. But John was a practical man, who understood that while part of his role was to uphold Tradition, dealing with the complexities of life sometimes required  he take a slightly more flexible and pragmatic approach. As Head of the House, John was empowered to make many decisions regarding the lives of his people, the rules and set expectations, he had to simultaneously enforce the rigid cultural expectations of the Harbour Society, while also adapting them to best suit the needs of his House.
Instead, he pulled out a notepad and flipped to a blank page, “I’ll be happy to discuss the medical aspects with Benny and Dean’s doctors, but I like to build a basic understanding of a patient’s background from their family and other people close to them. I’d like to interview all the key people in Dean’s life, everyone he is closest to.”
Castiel being his usual self, could see right through Dean’s false unwillingness and in response was completely uncompromising. In typical fashion (not that Dean knew him well enough at the time to know) he’d done the inverse. Every time Dean had tried to reject him, he’d turned off the shower and run a bath, turning what could have been just a couple of minutes long task into an hour or more of intimate physical contact. He’d eased himself into the water as well, seating Dean between his legs and wait him out, giving him time to process, to work through his own reluctance. He’d wait, letting the warm water and stillness sooth them both till Dean was ready to continue the cleaning process. He never relented, carefully assertive, but was infinitely patient.
“Alright.” His voice determined to be strong, clear.
It’s only accessible through the garage as it’s an addition to the house, and usually remained locked between heats. Cas’s had it added last year after spending their Heats at the OSP centre had grown increasingly problematic for Dean. Gabe sympathised with them, having to go through such an intimate and vulnerable process under the supervision of the centre staff must have been an ordeal.
Dean, of course, immediately started to shift in his arms, seeking his lost Alpha. But Gabe shushes him, running a hand up and down his back comfortingly. He looks up at the nearest screen above the bed. The gas had run out over an hour ago and Dean was definitely waking up. They probably only had a couple more minutes to strategise before Dean’s next wave of need would have to be addressed.
The vaginal dilator in Dean’s other passage was shaped slightly differently but acted much the same and though he didn’t introduce it until Dean accustomed himself to the first device, both were now familiar enough that Dean no longer hesitated in laying himself over the bench.
was so important
He gets why Castiel wants him to wait, the intrinsic and frankly base desire to submit, to offer himself up in this way would be enough but the build up is delicious too. The way his skin tingles every time Cas touches him, the way he can’t help following the line of Cas’s ass with renewed want everytime he sees it. It’s going to feel amazing having him inside him again.
“Cas.” he gasps out, desperately wanting the world to stop hurting so much all of a sudden. But he can’t breathe, can’t focus.
“Go on,” He steels himself, “Next question.” He catches Cas’s eyes, daring him to continue and Cas, ready to take the hint does, pen in hand again and notebook ready.
"You're ok, it's just a lot of sensation, baby. You're doing just fine,"
It took a bit more effort not to comment further, but it was important to get a full picture of the situation before passing judgement. There may be factors of which Benny was unaware, he’d need to speak to Dr Harris when she returned tomorrow morning.
“You said he met someone he knew, that it upset him?” Sam asks.
“It’s ok.” Cas leans forward into Dean's space, one hand coming up to cup his face tenderly, “You can. Just walk me through it, step by step. Okay?”
He nodded his approval, pleased. If possible Dean knew he was to wait for Castiel before he went at night, it wasn’t always possible but mostly they succeeded.
He’s holding his breath he realises, lightheaded and gasping for air as the last of it passes in gentler movements now, Cas’s still working him through it, giving him every moment possible before it becomes too much, too sensitive.
Gabe swaps sides and has him finish off the second set of exercises and in under a minute they’re done, with Gabe wiping off his fingers on a towel and reaching for the dilators to give them a clean. He heads into the bathroom and Dean takes a moment to catch his breath.
And he’s working into Dean hard, just like he likes it.
Castiel didn't like the sound of that at all, he frowned, "Has he caught anything lately?"
It had to hurt but Dean is desperate enough now to like the pain a little. Cas knows that when he gets like this, some denial and then a little pain, it’s almost enough by itself, damn the cage. Almost.
“Good. That’s it,” Cas used his other hand to wipe Dean’s hair back off his forehead, “You’re doing so well.”
"Dean? Sweetheart, you need to relax your body. I know it's hard, but you have to try," Cas sounded sad, as he brushed his fingers through Dean's hair and down his neck.
Gabe hoped desperately that it was true.
“And your father?”
Gabe clicks open the quick releases on Dean’s hip and leg harness. The straps fall away, but they leave his arms still immobilised across his chest. The IV is carefully removed as well.
Castiel had just finished packing up his own supplies as Gabe entered his office.
Not too bad he thought, a bit short, but at least Wikipedia had accurate information on the new testing regimes and the differences in criteria.
“You catch all that?”
“And Dean,”
“God, it’s such a mess! I don’t even know where to start. How do you break down someone whole life into episodes of trauma? It’s just...” he falls quiet for a moment thinking, clearly not ready to talk about this, Cas doubts he’ll ever truly be ready, but Sam loves his brother enough to try.
Dean let out a relieved breath, he hated having anyone but Castiel’s fingers inside him. Even though he knew Gabe well and had gotten somewhat used to having him do this, it still felt pretty awful.
One person just wasn’t capable of taking care of Dean throughout all of the estrus period. Luckily Gabe was a beta, perfect to assist as he was unaffected by their pheromones. He could keep a clear head and a steady hand when needed. His training as an Omega Nurse and history with Dean was also an essential part in making this a success. Dean needed to trust him intimately or it just wasn’t going to work.
“I’m fine. Just wanted to check,”
It’s a large room, practically an apartment by itself, with a small kitchen and separate bathroom off to one side. There’s king size bed tucked into one corner, near the bathroom and a sofa in another corner, one wall is mounted with screens featuring readouts from the dozen or so monitoring devices Dean wears, as well as some medical supply cabinets and a wardrobe for extra sheets, blankets and towels against the other wall.
Because every Saturday, without fail, Castiel opens Dean up and proves just how much he cares.
He wondered what treatment methods the medical team at Caladh House had tried, he really hoped it wasn't the 'Traditional' method.
“I lied.” He whispered to the bend between Cas neck and ear, “I told them it was an accident. I said he came for a visit and we were going out to dinner. I lied and told them it was an accident and that he didn’t realize how drunk he was. I didn’t want them to know just how worthless I was, that my own father tried to kill me.”
“Okay. I’m going to tell you what I know and you can fill in the gaps. I’ll also ask you some questions and I want you to answer them as best you can, even if you need a moment to consider. If you need a break just say so and we’ll stop.”
“Good to see you Sammy. Real good.”
“He said it would be fine, so long as I pass the physical and weigh-in,”
“John. That’s just…. I’m so sorry,” the man on the other end of the line was clearly lost for words, he knew how difficult it was for John, how he desperately wanted to connect with his child, “But now that the council has approved the employment of that Dynamic Therapist, he might finally respond to treatment.”
