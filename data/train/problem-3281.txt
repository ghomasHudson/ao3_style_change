As if to put the matter to rest, the angel hooks his fingers on the waistband of Dean’s pants, smiles as if he knows all of Dean’s secrets.
Dean feels something straining in his neck.
He can’t sleep.
And Dean knows that he shouldn’t be succumbing like he is, to the same trick that the angel’s pulled on him, a thousand times, at the wall. That just because he seems vulnerable, Dean shouldn’t be putting his hand on the angel’s back, shouldn’t be trying to comfort him, when he knows that this isn’t Cas—can’t be.
But the man doesn’t have any proof. Bobby had seen Cas’ body. As long as Cas is a no-show at the wall, Aarif can’t take Dean to the council.
enough, even though Dean had spent his whole goddamn life taking care of him, feeding and clothing Sammy through worse.
just as the sun below the horizon starts to rise again.
But still he does it.
But maybe he's not because then Cas jerks from beneath Dean’s body and he turns his cheek away, buries his face into the pillow and stifles a moan and then Dean's burning, feeling hot and he moves his lips to Cas’ ear, works his mouth more furiously than before.
Cas opens his eyes, and he’s staring at the hunter again, looking pained, looking burdened and he finally says, “
But when she sees Cas, she goes abruptly still.
It’s the hardest thing to do, picking himself off of that playground floor.
People.
Hearing this, the demon smiled.
And Sam feels truly sorry for the guy. Or well, grudgingly at first—it’s a little hard to acknowledge that they fucked up again, missing the witch a second night in a row—and then truly sorry when he remembers the shattered tile in the bathroom where the dude’s head had collided. Dean’s victim only sobs harder when he complains about how his pitcher of beer was knocked over onto Cas, and Sam’s not sure if he’s more sad about the fact that Dean pushed him into a wall while attempting to rescue their formerly angelic brother, or if he’s just miserable that he has to pay for more beer.
Dean’s mouth feels dry. This feels like a long time ago has come again.
Cas says, voice warbling like a little bird
Shut up.
Cas closes his eyes when Dean kisses him on the jaw.
, the angel will remind them, each night when he finally shows his face. He’ll sit by the fire with his legs crossed, and tell stories about a place filled with roses and sun. He’ll take Mom’s hands in his own, look her in the eyes and promise that her sadness will be gone soon, that she’ll see her husband and be at peace again. To Monique, he’ll clasp her by the shoulders, speak avidly of paradise and food plenty, of people who live on, even if they’re gone now, and Monique’ll weep openly, thinking of her dead parents and brother.
“It’s a surprise,” Dean says and leans over, cups Cas’ cheek for a moment, runs his hand soothingly down Cas’ arm.
And suddenly, they can't look each other in the eyes anymore.
Cas wraps his arms around his back and they breathe together.
Cas’ shoulders slump. He doesn’t look at Dean. But he says quietly, “I’ll be gone by morning light.”
, Dean had decided to
, the angel whispers against his chest.
Somehow, so, so vulnerable.
. Or perhaps it was the fact that when her husband had been alive, Wednesdays had always been the days that Woody Farmer would go visit his ailing mother (a Kenyan woman—her daddy had never failed to gripe about the scandal as Woody’s father had been his best mate, or at least until Woody’s father had gone on missionary work to Africa and instead of Jesus, had brought back his foreign wife). At any rate, Wednesday had been the day when Mrs. Christian had always had her husband to herself. For three decades, she had not had a single bad Wednesday in her life, so she knew it was going to be a good day.
Cas keeps his eyes downcast, avoiding Dean’s gaze, and something about that must make Dean really anxious because Dean suddenly pulls Cas into another one of their impromptu hugs. He mumbles another
“I want to sleep with you,” Cas says. “I don’t want to be alone.”
Because it’s not like Dean doesn’t see it. There’s a fervour in Aarif that Dean recognizes. It’s one that’s fierce and unstoppable, a desperation that doesn’t cease until everything that can be done has been done. Because Aarif’s not Alejandro, sixty-three years old and patient. He’s not Rob, who’s fifty-six and still can’t seem to behave. Aarif’s
“They didn’t belong with each other, anyway,” Dean says, and they drive back home.
that he’s a god.
Which means Dean’s not gonna get laid.
“Are you alright?” Cas says, voice soft, and Dean forgets his indignation, forgets about everything except Cas’ touch, and the world goes quiet, and it’s not only because they’re the only two left in the room.
And then Sam’s freaking out because if Dean’s girlfriend’s house is the bunker, then that means that she’s
"Gonna keep you safe," Dean mumbles and he's saying all sorts of things, making a million promises but then, “I love you,” Dean says hoarsely and he can’t stop himself from repeating it—not when it's been trapped in his throat for so long. Not when he should've been saying it for years but didn't.
The man explains how he’s here to inspect the apartment’s fire extinguishers. Apparently the whole complex got the e-mail, Dean tells him, and launches into a long explanation, which starts off with a lot of stammering because Dean still seems to be in shock about his almost untimely demise, and during which Cas is acutely aware of the fact that he’s still straddling the man without any clothes on.
Sam’s there with them. He comes then, limping from the other side of the church because Lucifer tossed him into the pews hard enough that the wood splintered. Sam takes his place on the floor by Cas’ side and then he yanks at Cas’ arm (too roughly, Dean thinks) and Sam’s talking so quickly and Dean’s not hearing any of it, because he’s still looking at Cas.
He wonders then when he got so weak. When he became afraid of the things that go bump in the night. Hasn’t he wanted to be out there for days? With Cas? And even before Cas, to go hunting with Bobby—they’d even argued about it the day that he and Sam had left. But now Dean’s not so sure. It’s hard to be, when there’s inches of snow covering the ground. When he’s shivering and probably frostbitten because they’d stripped him of his shirt on stage. When he hasn’t eaten in a day. When he has
It’s quiet again.
Cas, Dean mouths.
He shouldn’t. He knows. But an hour ticks by and Sam’s been out long enough that Dean can sneak out of the bedroom, go where he needs to be.
Dean avoids his eyes. He drops them down until they rest on the guard’s own badge.
That’s all it takes.
Sam doesn’t miss.
Dean doesn’t know what his asshole husband says. He drowns out the self-congratulatory speech, clings to the angel’s coat with shaking hands as if holding on for dear life, and maybe this lookalike angel’s the only thing that staves off the panic building in his chest.
Associating with angels had consequences, Bobby had explained to him. “They ain’t the God-abiding, harp-toting little healers that you’d expect, Dean. They’re…different. They…”
It’s not like humans have a real nation of their own, all scattered, some at the border of Heaven, others at the border of Hell. Dean's family hails from the first, and even if Dean’s not an angel, the angel’s customs have for a long time been Dean's own.
This time, Dean’s voice is distant and strained as he says, “Cas wants to talk, huh?”
It’s sitting there in front of the council as usual, smack-dab in the centre of the devil’s trap, the ring of holy oil. But this time there are dried flower petals scattered on the floor. There are incense sticks and candles courting its circumference. And
Dean presses DELETE.
Cas was still hugging Dean when they got to the bunker. Hell, he was really going for those brownie points. And when Sam ushered them inside, the two toddlers were holding hands in a death grip, determined to be together.
“’M good,” Dean says. “Your grace?”
It freaks him out when Sam says it. It freaks him out because it implies a little something—something about the way that he feels around Cas, and there’s something uneasy, something that stirs in the pit of his stomach when Sam notices it. He tries to brush it off. He rolls his eyes at Sam, thumps him on the back and pretends that what Sam’s said doesn’t mean a damn well anything, but none of it matters, because in the end…it gets to him (it makes him force himself to stop wanting).
“Yeah, that’s called a hangover, buddy. C’mon, we’re just gonna pick up a few things for your headache and then you can get back into bed.”
Maybe if Cas told him that he’s fine, Dean would push away.
“I wish that you would understand why I can’t sleep in the bed alone, agent,” he sighs dramatically and he keeps pestering, keeps pushing, and he doesn’t seem to understand that the bird monster is coming in mere hours and they still don’t have anything to kill it with.
Cas says and his bottom lip wobbles.
does.”
But why and to where, no one had known.
Dean has
Dean stills, or at least, tries to have the shakiest semblance of control, and he kisses Cas’ neck, wants him to know that he’s not being mean by pulling away because seeing Cas shoot him another disappointed sad look is going to break Dean.

He drinks a lot (but not so much that it’s too much) but there are other things, other pieces that clue Sam in.
At the bunker that night, Dean sits Cas down on his bed in that little room and lifts his shirt up and patches the wound there.
“Close your eyes,” Cas says, when Dean’s lying on his stomach, when he’s got his cheek pressed to the pillow and he can’t help but stare at the door of their room.
“I have my mobile,” the old man says, voice just a high-pitched squeak, and then the old man composes himself and his voice is low, lower, sickeningly innocent. “I can’t reach it though. My arms are pinned behind me. There’s no room to move, agent. It hurts so much!”
When he stops, he’s in the bunker dungeon.
What happens next is the story that will have Cas dying of mortification at every family gathering.
There’s a dark expression on his face.
And of course Sam’s turning to Jack right away. Of course Sam's there, giving him a little frown that Jack pretends not to see, because it’s not like Dean hasn’t noticed what Sam’s been doing—yanking the boy into a corner, hissing at him, warning him in whispers not to ask Dean about Cas because, Can’t you see that he’s hurting?
But he doesn’t do any of those things.
From her neck down, she’s marked with the angel’s tattoos.
Cas’ hand reaches out and clasps the side of Dean’s face.
When he reaches them, he stops.
With hitching breath, once more Dean obeys.
The next three hours, until six in the morning, Mrs. Christian had slaved away, cleaning Mr. Christian’s tombstone with backbreaking effort until it had shone and sparkled once more. After that, she had been too exhausted to walk the rest of the way back to her farm, and pulling out her cellular device, she had sent Cookie Baker a letter imploring her for her help.
He has only a few belongings. He hopes that Sam will not mind that he has taken an umbrella for the rain.
“I don’t know. He went past the wall.”
Cookie squinted, leaning on her cane to get a good look. Come to think of it, the demon did have a pretty voluptuous figure. Momentarily distracted by her appreciation of this beautiful woman, Cookie sighed. She’d been without romance for far too long. Her last relationship…well, suffice it to say that long-distance wasn’t easy at her age. Women of her generation struggled to turn on a phone, let alone send a text. It’d taken her a full six months to teach Eve how to use a cell phone, and all she’d gotten in return were abysmally lengthy and obnoxious texts signed by a Mrs. Gaylord Christian. Hmph!
“He wasn’t talking to anyone,” Sam says.
8:50 p.m.
Okay. So Sam gets a little side-tracked in the morning. His mission to find out what happened to him immediately screeches to a halt by the most unexpected of things.
“Why do you have Sam’s phone?” the voice says softly and Sam says, “I think my name is Sam.”
And Alejandro realizes it.
They hit the road.
The water in Dean’s room is higher today. It laps at the edges of his bed in a strange harmony with the voice coming through the walls. When Dean opens his eyes, they’re on the lake again, their bed no longer anchored, just floating gently across to the other side.
But Cas doesn't do anything.
To the grate.
(But he doesn’t go there).
“I don’t have one for you,” he says.
“That’s easy for you to say when you’re still sporting a fucking semi.”
Dean didn’t think that he would ever hear its noise but now it happens and there’s no sound and Dean wishes that there could have been sound.
“Someone else paid for it,” she says.
“Your brother’s here,” the nurse says. “Let me go get him.”
Baby: You want me to call you.
“What a catch,” the man chortles to himself and Cas smiles, but his eyes keep darting over to Sam and Dean. Or well, it
Sam’s voice is soft, afraid. It cracks when he speaks.
And Sam opens his eyes, only to see that Dean and Cas are staring at him, looking kind of frozen, alerted by the creaking of Sam’s mattress. They’re still pressed together under their shared blanket, tight as ever, particularly at the
Dean hesitates.
, Castiel commands.
It’s a kind of downwards spiral. It’s him and it’s everything that he’s been denying himself for years. It all gets to him. It all reminds him—Sam’s knowing expression, his own needy touches, Cas’ wanting eyes—that he’s crossing a line, crossing into a place that he’s promised himself that he won’t touch because he ruins everything. He knows it.
“I need you,” Dean says and his eyes are shining electric, teeming with life, teeming with energy and Dean’s practically vibrating—Castiel can feel the pent up vitality in the tremble of Dean’s fingers. “God, I need you right now, Cas, please.”
The pair began to move from the aisle to the front door. Mrs. Christian hastily jumped off the crate and scurried to the till. But the devil worshippers paid her no visit. Having loitered for an hour in her shop, they left without purchasing a single thing and Mrs. Christian, to her dismay, forgot to charge the city man for the broken container of hair gel.
So Sam gapes.
But it happens.
“Quiet,” he says.
The gunslinger’s firing his pistol haphazardly, and Dean doesn’t know how he doesn’t have to stop and reload after every bullet (but he’s an entity and maybe that means magic bullets).
“Where is he?” Castiel says.
It’s another stitch on Cas’ face. Cas’ face is becoming riddled with so many cuts that Cas worries that he will soon resemble Frankenstein’s creature from every Halloween movie that Dean has ever made him watch.
I can’t stay.
Castiel doesn’t know—no, Castiel
He can’t sleep.
There’s a clattering of sound—dissonant, grating—piercing Dean’s hangover headache as Sam bangs open and closes cupboards for ingredients for his breakfast sandwich. At five-thirty in the morning, it’s too loud and too early for the boom of Sam’s anger to sink through the bunker’s thin walls.
“I wish my boy had stayed away,” she says and she doesn’t sound like herself. Her voice is soft, vulnerable like he’s never heard before. “I wish that if he had to go to the angel, he would’ve stayed with her, instead of coming back.”
face before the demon exploded into ash.
When Cas runs his fingers over his backside, Dean squeezes his eyes shut. Dean digs his fingers into the mattress and barely bites back a moan.
Did you pray to me?
, he says and Dean’s heart races.
then the angel that he saw at the wall last night becomes

eyes, except the colour’s different—black, and a little rounder than Mom’s. In fact, the more that Sam looks at her, the more he realizes what a doppelganger she is. He almost calls her Mom.
“Turn over,” the angel commands and his eyes glitter.
A wail maybe.
There's no satisfaction. There's only the sinking regret and fear that fills him because Alastair is going to skin him alive.
Sam’s angry that he cut on him but he stays calmer than Dean.
I want you to hold me.
So he spends an hour on his back, staring at the ceiling while Aarif mumbles threats in his sleep. So he spends an hour picturing Cas’ face, Cas’ wings, and what Cas might say, if only he would come closer for once, if only he’d talk to Dean.
“Go—please go. Please.”
Sam drives. Dean sits in the passenger seat.
to get to Cas, anything to make sure that he’s
Dean enters his bedroom and shuts the door.
It’s 5:26 a.m. and the sun will be up soon and Cas has been robbed of sleep.
“I’m sorry,” Cas says and he lets the devil take control once more.
. Dean knows that about himself. He’s hopeless because he’s got a lot of feelings swirling inside his chest and he’s not sure how he’s going to survive the next twenty-four hours without blabbing

got something to offer?"
“That’s how long Cas was possessed,” Sam says and maybe it’s the universe’s biggest joke.
Dean looks at the letter numbly.
The next day, Sam slams his fist down onto the table.
. Sam wonders what’s up. Maybe their bed’s getting too confining. Maybe Cas is trying to push Dean off and Dean isn’t budging. But then Dean’s voice cuts in, equally husky, and, “C’mon, baby,” he says. “Come on my coc—”
After fifteen minutes, Sam starts talking again.
Cas takes a moment to answer. He always takes a moment before answering Dean’s questions. Sometimes, he doesn’t answer at all.
“We got your mistress, Winchester,” the demon gloats. “What are you gonna do about it?”
So, “I know you’re not any fucking widow,” Aarif says. “I know Castiel isn’t dead. And when I find him, I’m going to fucking kill him.”
So it was no surprise, really, that when the clock struck midnight and Halloween reared its ugly head again, that upon discovering a fluffy black kitten with blue eyes licking its paws and nestling on his bed, Dean immediately called Sam.
He doesn’t know what it means.
“Dean!” Sam says, once again drops to his knees, once again clutches his brother’s face and pleads with him. “Look at me, Dean,” Sam says but Dean’s eyes are lifeless, Dean’s heart is broken, Dean is gone and has been gone for a long time, and Sam takes the gun away (it’s easy because Dean’s barely holding on anyway), and he says, “Dean, what’s wrong? What’s wrong?”
The chair’s still where he left it. It’s by Cas’ head, as if some invisible creature’s been watching over him.
So Sam gets another idea.
and just as goddamn
Her hands on his hair are steady as she talks. She snips the hair closest to his ears, tells him how at forty-nine, her son had long been an outcast of society. “Like you,” she says. “No one bothered with him.”
robe wrapped tight around his form. Maybe Cas is too human to sense Dean’s presence because he shivers in the room and opens the refrigerator but makes no indication that he knows that Dean is there.
Death is the only safe place.
Cas doesn’t notice it. Or at least he doesn’t seem to. He doesn’t notice the way that Dean sometimes pushes Cas behind himself—the way that Dean just has this instinct to cover Cas with his body, whenever a gun’s pointed in the angel’s direction, whenever someone dares make a threat to the angel’s life. Hell, when that happens, Dean doesn’t know what comes over him. He doesn’t know why he’s suddenly trying to make himself bigger, trying to redirect those damn insults to himself and away from Cas, because they’re hunters, and insults are just a part of the trade (and Cas probably knows that).
Cas smiles at him, warm and genuine and he leans over and presses a big, loud kiss to Dean’s mouth and before Dean knows it, Cas is eager and straddling him and they’re pressing their mouths together with such a fervor that Dean's just drunk in love all over again.
Dean squeezes his eyes shut.
The drive to the bunker is quiet. Dean’s too nervous to talk. If he lets this moment be forgotten in history, he knows that there might not be another one.
: …Castiel. I think I’m in love with you.
“I’m having doubts about us,” Cas says. “About our marriage.”
And Dean is still dead.
It doesn’t take long after that. An hour later, Sam and Dean show up at the warehouse. The demon keeps an angel blade steady to Cas’ throat, declaring his intent to rule hell, and Cas vaguely wonders how long the fiend will last if he doesn’t flee.
“It isn’t your fault,” he snaps and the towel falls to the floor. The dried blood on Cas’ chest is nearly gone. But before Dean can do anything about what remains, Cas lets his grace spill out, small wisps that will do little than clean his body.
“I know you’re seeing your angel,” she says, “and I know I should report you to the council.”
Because it might be the last time.
“As if you would know what attracts
But in the darkness, Dean’s come up behind him and Castiel feels Dean’s fingers brush his back cautiously until they drop away.
“Let’s kill it,” Dean said, and all it took for them to abandon their murder plans was for the kitten to poke its nose into the back of Dean’s hand and let out a tiny little
So, in a low voice, he croaks, “I saw
“Oh, I’m sure he is,” Sam sneers. “Just like he was last night.”
People
Or maybe that’s just Dean.
It’s an hour later and Cas has spent it lying on his back with his eyes wide open, watching a stream of moonlight through the lone skylight in the gymnasium’s roof while Dean’s hand rests an inch from his own.
“Damn it, what did I do?” Dean whispers to the empty room.
“He was with a man.”
Seeing it makes Dean smile.
And Cas smiles.
“Always knew you were no good, Winchester.”
Gently.
Sam suppresses a groan. His knees are really beginning to ache, not to mention he’s kind of confused. He’s not quite sure why being marked up by tattoos and being stabbed by a Sharpie reminds Cas of being human, but he supposes angels are too uptight to get body art and feeling the itchy sensation of an unruly Sharpie every once in a while is always a not-fun indication of being mortal.
So, “Dean!” Cas shouts, just as the child throws Dean back against the wall.
“What, Cas, why?” Sam says and Cas shifts, gazes out across the lake and at the night sky and every bit of him is uneasy.
“Well, I’m still hungry,” Dean says and stretches his legs out, leans against the wall and rebelliously crosses his arms with more confidence than he feels. “And bored. You leave me here all day with nothing to do. I thought I was your fucking bride or something. You’re not really proving you’re a good husband.”
Those words make Dean forget where he is.
For a moment, Dean feel excruciating pain shoot through his left shoulder.
It’s hard being in the same room as Cas.
Just the gate.
He doesn’t know what pain she’s talking about. For a moment, he wonders if it had been the same debilitating pain that had wracked his shoulder back at the camp, after Cas had claimed him in his dream. As soon as he’d crossed the camp’s threshold, it had vanished, but even now, the handprint’s tender. Thinking about it makes him self-conscious enough that he tenses up, anticipating another blow. When he comes back out of his thoughts, Mary’s disappeared again, her eyes unfocused and mumbling something that he can’t hear.
They get so desperate that they don’t notice when Sam and Jack
,” not tinged with his Enochian accent, not wrapped in the careful intonations of the angel at the wall. Cas says, “Dean,” and it sounds like
“It’s not local,” Sam tells him, “but it’s tricky.”
Alastair comes to him right before sunrise.
But Dean doesn’t.
Today, it’s winter again. It’s been so many winters but tonight, it’s the coldest winter, so cold that even Sam wants to sleep with Cas because extra body heat is the only thing that’ll keep them from becoming flesh icicles in this bunker—except Dean’s not having that because Dean’s irrationally irritated tonight—and he can’t take Sam’s joke so he just snaps, “You can’t sleep with Cas.”
Cue Sam and Dean warily circling the bed, Sam with a net clasped between his fingers, Dean with a bottle of holy water all ready to spritz away every ounce of Satan that the kitten contained. Hell, they were traumatized men, hardened from years of fighting Halloween battles, and they weren’t letting the twisted holiday mess with them this year. With a jerk of his head, Dean motioned for his brother, and after a bit of a struggle (notably chasing the little devil as it evaded Sam effortlessly), the kitten was finally ensnared.
He swallows; it gets to him.
Cas says then, “Sam would never allow it,” and Dean’s confused and doesn’t know what he’s talking about. Instead, Dean reaches for Cas’ hands, pries them away from his face, and Cas darts his head and what are you hiding from, angel? Dean asks.
When he opens the door to the little supply closet, Dean’s there, all the contents of the Gross Stuff drawer out on a shelf. He’s relabelling. He’s giving the vials proper names.
Please help me, he texts the man. I can’t remember who I am.
Cas’ skin is hot.
Sam rolled his eyes, but that was a bad move because Dean saw it and immediately was convinced that that the whole grocery store debacle today had been a ruse to expel him from the family—even though it’d been
is. And I don’t know when we fell in love, okay? Maybe it was when I thought the leviathans killed you and I couldn’t stop dreaming about it. Or maybe it was when we were in purgatory and you’d watch over me when I slept and you’d run your fingers through my hair and I wouldn’t say anything because maybe you didn’t know that that’s not how two straight dudes are supposed to act. Hell, Cas, maybe it was even that first day when you yanked me out of the pit, and you had me believing in you from the moment I laid eyes on you—I don’t know. I just know I’ve been in love with you for more time than I can count, and I—it doesn’t matter now. It doesn’t because we’re finally together now and you’re living with me and Sam so I don’t have to miss you every second of the goddamn day that you’re gone. I don’t have to make you a mixtape to convince you to stay. You’ve always been there, Cas—when my brother was possessed by Lucifer, when the Mark of Cain made me a murderer, when Mom came back from the dead. All of it, Cas. All of it. And I’m fucking grateful. I
(But Dean knows where Cas should go).
Dean doesn’t answer right away. Cas can hear him shifting, the jingle of the Impala’s keys in his hands. He must still be in the car. Sam and Gabriel are probably waiting for him. But before Cas can say good-bye, Dean says, “I just want you to be safe.”
It’s awkward.
The angel’s expression darkens with displeasure.
For a long time, Dean can’t get his tongue to work. For a long time, they sway against the door, and when Dean knows that he’ll never be able to get a word out, at least not without turning into a blubbering mess, he just closes his eyes and leans his forehead against Cas’ and Cas inhales then, sharp and surprised and maybe a little afraid.
They're on their own.
It’s not what makes Dean finally go off the handle.
Maybe he's just been holding it in too long.
When his eyes are open again, Dean watches him and his mouth.
He hears Dean’s voice and it winds him.
Sam yawns.
Later, Sam tells him to stop.
Dean licks his lips.
He can’t sleep.
“Oh, but Jack, we are not in possession of such a white truck and we’re not strangers, you see, for surely you must remember my excellent shop that you visit so frequently with your fathers—
So they’d destroyed Cas' blade. They’d burned away his last remaining essence, his grace, all so that they could have some more goddamn bullets, more angel-killing machines because life was hard, Sam had explained to him. In this world that they’d stumbled into, life was hard and the people couldn’t afford to waste things. They couldn’t afford to do that when they could salvage, as if Cas and his effects had been worth nothing unless they could be used for more murder, used for more blood.
They stay in bed. Opposite ends. Careful not to touch.
He stays complacent.
Whatever Sam says, instead of getting more offended, Dean just looks relieved. Sam frowns, and then Dean swallows, shoots him a look, and, “Uh, well, you—you’re sixteen!”
So grabbing Cas’ hand, Sam rushed through the store in a fright. He headed to the cashier, asked the elderly gentleman to make an announcement in case anyone else saw the tot, but Dean simply could not be found. And as if to make matters worse, Cas used this exact moment of Sam’s intense concern to wrestle his hand away and run off.
“Stop,” Dean begs him. “Stop.”
“Wish Dad was alive,” Sam says.
(See the end of the chapter for
Pretending as if there won’t always be ghosts now.
“Hey,” Dean calls then, from the other end of the table. “I say we call Cas and then hit the road.”
He’s not as good as his job as Insufferable Him was.
Sam immediately plasters his ear to the door.
It’s somewhere when she’s making a second braid for her own amusement that the clocks in the men’s block sing five. In another hour, the others will be returning from the work day. Another hour after that, and Dean’ll have to go back to the wall.
It hurts when Cas chooses not to talk this time.
“You can barely stand,” Dean says.
“Stories,” she says sharply. “You got them stuck in your head.”
At the elder Winchester brother’s words, the city man smacked him. “Stop breaking the fourth wall, Dean,” he mumbled and Samuel Winchester’s eyebrows shot up with disbelief.
While Mrs. Christian sobbed, it was Cookie Baker who saw how the chaos of that cold winter morning unfolded. Now, Cookie wasn’t unfamiliar with the supernatural world, and for this reason, it was why she’d feared Eve Christian’s words when she’d first begun babbling about the Winchesters’ penchant for devil worship. Cookie’s own grandfather had been a witch and had taught Cookie a thing or two when she’d been a child before he’d joined the cultists that had come to Lebanon in ’66. That year had torn Cookie’s family apart, had upset her grandmother so much that she’d fled back to her native Hawai‘i while her grandfather, who’d spoken so ardently to his family about worshipping a demon named Azazel, had one day too disappeared without a trace, a flash of startling yellow eyes and a wicked smile all that the family had glimpsed before he’d departed—eyes that would haunt Cookie’s dreams forever.
It’s maybe a mistake, buying that coat. He sees it in a shop where the prices are thousands above their spending budget, but when he tries it on, he feels as if Cas’ arms are enveloping him.
But maybe denial’s not enough. Sam starts coughing a lot when he’s in their presence.
What Mrs. Christian did not know, however, was that she would be doing it again just ten minutes later.
But he can’t do it for long.
For a second, he tumbles somewhere deep inside his mind.
“It wasn’t,” Dean says, through gritted teeth, and Cas doesn’t say anything this time, just lets him move with this on his own terms, and then he tilts his head up, kisses the part of Dean’s collar that peeks out from under his shirt.
Ten minutes later, “So go to a bar,” Sam says.
There was something about Wednesdays that always put Mrs. Christian in a good mood.
“Well, camp would hate me even more if I didn’t, and they love you so…”
. I was almost gone—”
Oh, how saddened the child looked at being told he was too young to understand the intricacies of devil worship! Oh, it was preposterous, Mrs. Christian thought, considering how the child mere hours ago had clearly harnessed the hellish powers of Satan himself to make the two old ladies invisible!
And still neither of them speak.
Lucifer wraps his hand around Dean’s throat.
The knock comes again. It must be the old woman. Maybe it’s her husband. Maybe Sam’s calling again.
“What?”
He watches Cas eat instead.
into him.
Sam runs then, right out the door, and Dean feels relief because they’ve all got away—maybe.
Sam drives while Dean stares out the passenger seat. They’re not far away from the bunker, but Sam keeps glancing at him the whole way there.
It can’t be his Cas when there’s no need for the angel to pretend anymore.
Still a niggling persistent doubt in his stomach that the Cas at the wall isn’t his own.
“Tickles, huh?” Dean says and he laces their fingers together.
Cas just finds Dean’s hand and holds it in his own.
There’s an ache inside Dean and it’s only growing.
he’ll mumble, and then he’ll look at Cas as if he wants to kiss him (or maybe Cas only thinks that because Cas has watched one too many episodes of
A summoning spell.
“I’m Dean,” the firefighter says, and then Cas realizes what he’s done.
Lucifer rages, throws a tantrum where he destroys all of the pews in the church where Sam and Dean have found the two, and Crowley’s gone while Rowena cowers by their side.
Just before they leave for Gay Bar™, Sam stops Cas by the door and applies some eyeliner. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder but sexy, seductive eyes definitely help.
CASTIEL: I kissed your brother sam
From the corner of the room, Michael watches them with curiosity glittering in his eyes.
And then Dean looks his way.
Dean closes his eyes and tries to breathe.
It’s at this point that Ai’s hand finally becomes less sure. It’s at this that she has to put her scissors down, because the only way she seems to be able to keep her fingers from twitching uncontrollably is by digging her nails into her thighs.
But he lies there with the knowledge that his Dean lies with another version of him, too.
For a second, Lucifer’s fingers falter. Dean’s body hits the carpeted aisle of the church floor. His head knocks against the sharp edge of a pew. Blood erupts from his forehead.
And then Sam’s not expecting what happens next.
Cas looks up at Dean, puzzled.
It takes a while.
So maybe he’s hallucinating when he sees him.
“You’re so strong, Cas,” he babbles. “I don’t think I could even take out a demon on my own but you took down so many!”
And at that, Dean Winchester shut his eyes tightly. Swallowed again as if there was something on his mind that was haunting him. And then when he gazed back at Castiel, it was with a clenched fist and quivering lips.
Cas whimpers and Dean swallows his cries down with kisses. Cas arches his body, throws his neck back and Dean presses his mouth there when Cas tries to catch his breath.
When Sam comes back to the motel room, it’s only to get a text from Dean telling him to stay away because
Castiel is always caught off guard because nowadays, it seems that Dean is jittery, is so cautious and it lulls Castiel into a false sense of
At least, that’s what Sam thinks of Dean’s behaviour.
From inside Dean’s room, Cas makes a low groaning sound, probably his disappointment at his bad grade, and Sam takes a few deep breaths while Cas pants and says in an awkward stilted way, “Oh, Sir. I tried so hard. I’ll do anything to make it up.”
“Oh, yeah?” Dean says then, angrily, and, “Why’s she here now, huh, Sam? Seems like she couldn’t wait to get outta there last time we saw her.”
The voice on the other end won’t talk to him.
But then the true hunger of purgatory gets to Dean.
. But it doesn't seem to matter. He still finds himself caring, still finds himself clenching his teeth with desperation and wanting to help when he sees the angel's wings
And then Dean’s back.
They just keeping
If Dean closes his eyes, he can pretend.
Sam cries, puts his hands over his face as he floats downstream, but nothing can keep the memory away. It penetrates deep into Sam’s conscience, and when Sam jerks awake, with horror, he realizes that he still remembers.
And whatever’s happened here, Castiel thinks, is
He doesn't want to. But because he knows that she’ll be checking on him, he picks up his fork. He moves it across his plate, spears peas and brings them up to his closed mouth. But he can’t bring himself to accept the food. He can’t stomach the thought of eating when the ache in his stomach isn’t from hunger.
Sam’s bewildered.
But listening to Bernard talk is excruciating.
He can’t sleep.
“We looked at that, Dean. It was nothing.”
Sam had dashed his hopes in one quick blow.
It’s after another movie session that they go out to the lake, and there’s something in the air, something with all of them, and maybe it’s because they watched a movie about family, about friends, and lovers, and maybe that’s why Sam’s jaw is clenched and he can’t look hopeful tonight because it’s been years and they’re nowhere closer to fixing this mess.
Maybe Dean’s goddamn foolish because night falls and Cas is shivering violently and then Dean’s aching and then Dean’s tired so he gets out of the chair and he goes to the bed and he slips in under the sheets and he shouldn’t do it because he told Cas that he wouldn’t but he
But then, “Is ketchup a vegetable?” he asks again.
The stunned silence that followed the demon’s request had Belphegor grinning.
At the elder Winchester’s words, Mrs. Christian couldn’t help but let out a squeak of terror. She covered her mouth quickly with her hands, but it seemed that the two devil worshippers took no notice. Weeping, she made the sign of the cross and prayed to the Lord to strike down upon these two Satanists. Who was she kidding? There was no saving their souls; they deserved every bit of damnation they got.
And “Don't tell Sam,” Dean says. "Don't tell Sam about what I'm going to do."
It’s been ages since Cas and he talked properly.
A moment later, Cas gets dizzy and conveniently falls to his knees.
Dean shouldn’t.
“Dean,” Castiel says and his voice sounds as if it hasn’t been used in the last two years.
Such a small heartbeat, Castiel thinks, compared to an angel’s own life force.
in tune that a bit of a crowd’s forming, watching the two go at it and Sam even sees the burly guy who’d tried to pick Cas up standing among the observers (but after the

, and then Dean's pulled into Cas' arms.
Kudos and comments are always welcome :D And if you'd like to show your support on Tumblr, you can reblog the original version
“Oh,” Sam says and he steps out. “I’ll…”
He can’t sleep.
“Dean?” Cas says, and his voice comes out warbled.
“I want to hug you,” Cas says after another eternity. “I want to wrap you in my arms and listen to your heartbeat and just hold you for a moment in agreeable silence.”
that surely the cold-blooded killing of the feline could be put off, in the interests of, as Sam had put it, “Not jumping to conclusions, Dean—it might just be a stray!” even though Dean was 10000% sure that the kitten was most definitely the spawn of Satan, intent on bearing them ill will on Hallow’s Eve.
Word starts to spread after that. The whispers in the camp are reborn. But they’re not completely venomous this time. They’re not just disgusted slurs, hurled at him as he goes. They’re whispers filled with wonder, with curiosity, because no one in the camp seems to be able to believe their eyes, believe that it’s this man that they’ve been tormenting, this man who’s been a stain on their camp’s reputation.
And then Sam’s lips twitch uncontrollably as he tries to force a nervous smile.
And Dean
Maybe there’s something heartbreaking about the way that Dean says it. Maybe it’s because Dean can’t even look at him, while he confesses it, and he’s so hurt that Dean suddenly feels the angel’s arms around him, pulling him close to his chest. And then Dean’s leaning his head against Cas, and Cas’ wings are surrounding him with their warmth, and even though he’s done this a thousand times with the Cas in his dreams, it’s only now that for the first time, it feels real.
“Movie?”
Dean remembers what Sam and Bobby did.
And then Sam could’ve sworn that they’d argued about who had missed who more, but they couldn’t have been talking about that, Sam reasoned, because that was sappy and coupley and
In front of the council’s dais, the seat that sits in the devil’s trap is there like always. The uneasy feeling that always drags Dean down whenever he’s in this place swells up in his chest as if it never really left. But the closer he gets to the chair, the more he’s aware that things have changed since last night. That today, there’s a small table in front of the chair. A walkie-talkie placed perfectly in the centre. And around it all, more guards than he’s ever seen before.
Dean must’ve been here at some point today, because the clothes that Michael had him wear are on the floor and his duffel bag from the hunt is on the table. It’s open, so Cas rifles through it, and maybe he is afraid that he’ll find something, something that’ll worry him, but everything is in order save for the toothbrush.
The seventh day that Castiel observes Dean, it is a laundry day.
This time when Dean kisses him, he doesn't miss. There's something salty mixed in with the taste of him, maybe tears, maybe the bitterness of their whole shitty situation. Dean doesn't waste a second—there are no pauses for breaths. Dean springs forth and plasters sloppy kisses to Cas' mouth, to Cas' temple, to Cas' ear. Murmurs
, opposite that. And where the names
So, “What are you doing to us?” he says.
, Cas. It’s not freaking Crowley or something. It’s Sam so why would he—”
It’s somewhere between the point where Cas’ mind is already drifting that his phone lights up, vibrating across the floor right into Cas’ outstretched hand.
Over the years, Lord Alastair's taught Dean many things. He's taught Dean how useful his mouth and hands can be for another man's pleasure. He's taught Dean what pain means and a hundred methods to overcome it. Dean knows how to pull state secrets off the tongues of even the most stiff upper-lipped nobles, knows whether he ought to submit or dominate, whether he ought to taunt or cry and resist to get them hard, whatever it takes to get them to sing while they fuck him.
Dean’s vision is tainting, with a blackness that threatens to take him under, and his cheek grazes Cas’ shoe as dizziness overwhelms him.
But now whenever Jack’s in trouble, he’s gotten used to looking for Dean. He’s gotten used to asking for Dean’s help. In the middle of the night, it’s always Dean who finds himself getting to his feet, when Jack’s dreaming about Dagon burning and the death of his parents.
He’d imagined a love confession many times, but he never pictured this.
But Sam doesn’t say that.
, says that as if there's anything he could say, and Cas, that goddamn sap, entwines their fingers together and tells Dean that he loves him.
i also promised that this chapter would be more cracky and deancas heavy than the last but...plot happened. what i had planned for won't appear until part 2 of this chapter unfortunately, so i promise, next chapter, that more cracky deancas stuff will definitely happen!
Of course, Sam’s first thought is that they’ve got to be talking about him. Sam hasn’t forgotten the way that he’d seen them sneaking around the bunker, trying to hide whatever had made Sam wipe his brain clean. It must’ve been something really bad, if they were constantly talking about it. Come to think of it, maybe that’s why they had resisted Gay Bar™ so mightily. Maybe there was an apocalypse brewing, and they hadn’t wanted to leave the bunker because some things were more important than a witch cursing people to dance, and Dean and Cas had maybe wanted to do some more research.
Tell him.
It seems okay for a while, Dean thinks, because they hunt and Cas comes with, and they’re back to digs and insults and it’s all in good fun, Dean thinks—really.
Sam shoots Cas another thumbs-up.
When Dean joins the other families, Bobby signals to the wall patrol.
“I know,” he says and he looks away from her, peers down at his toes again. “I know it wasn’t real.”
Dean gets such an urge to kiss Cas’ mouth again so he does, and Cas laughs into it as if Dean’s kisses are the best thing in the world.
But then Cas comes the next night.
Dean’s in the diner’s bathroom and he’s washing his hands when Cas comes in and Cas presses up against him, presses him into the sink.
So it’s no surprise that he ushers them all into the western-themed motel with a gargantuan grin splitting his face. It’s no surprise that Sam smiles softly and shakes his head, maybe a little embarrassed at his brother’s antics when Dean greets the receptionist with an overly-enthusiastic,
Dean’s slow.
Outside, the sun begins its descent downwards.
Even though Dean's done this a hundred times before, today feels like the first time.
“You’re not going to murder me,” Cas growls, defiant, just as the man babbles, “Please don’t kill me!”
“Yeah, it’s fine now,” Sam explains. “Don’t worry, Mom.”
“I’ll meet up with you guys after,” Sam says and he smiles gently, as if he understands something that Cas doesn’t. Then he disappears into the produce aisle.
Dean becomes a shell of himself again.
"Why do you have this?" he says and his touch make Dean shiver.
fingers that are clasping his face—it’s
Sam had said, with awe shining in his eyes, that had been replaced with soft feathers instead.
Sam types the first thing that pops into his brain.
content warning: implied self-harm
Dean hums in agreement. He draws Cas to the closet, pulls out their pajamas. Cas blinks. It’s not even late enough for dinner.
Cas says, “I’ll call it, Dean.”
But Dean
But he can’t think about that right now.
He must be out of his goddamn mind because it’s 2:00 a.m. and he’s swinging open the door of his bedroom, to the bedroom where Cas has been hiding in for much too long now, and he’s stepping inside, just wants to hear Cas’ voice because it’s been almost two years since Lucifer first possessed Cas, and now Cas is finally goddamn free.
he says softly and he lifts his hand, caresses Dean’s head hesitantly as if he’s not sure that he’s doing the right thing.
They don’t know what to say to him.
“I know you’re not,” Bobby says and he’s fucking gentle. His voice is soft. As if Dean’s maybe four and he’s lost Mom all over again. “But that don’t mean you don’t need more time.”
“I think I’ve found the way,” Cas says.
, do Dean and Cas fight like a married couple.
Worry overwhelms him.
(But he doesn’t know a lot of things lately).
“This is my fault, Dean.”
and Cas says,
So maybe that’s why Dean doesn’t do anything.
“Well, first of all”—Belphegor leaned forward in her chair—"you gotta let me go if I tell you.”
“Sent him on a bus home.”
“Don’t say that,” Dean says and he sounds desperate. “I’m just worried, Cas—I—you’re
Cas limps a little closer to the bed on his twisted ankle, close enough to touch.
In the distance, he can still hear the sirens going off. There are shouts and angry barks, panicked civilians being herded by camp guards into the warded bunkers that Bobby had helped design.
Mrs. Norris only has enough decency to not come barging in when Dean loudly rambles about how showers are private affairs.
Dean wants to pull him closer.
(“God, Dean, you’re not five!” Sam scolds), even if the receptionist’s polite and she rallies back Dean’s energetic salutation with one of her own.
He does not mention that he thought that he would die this Thursday at his own hand.
It’s loud, is what it is. It’s a split second of unbelievable noise, a split second where the Impala hits the pole and time slows down and Dean sees his Baby shredding, sees the way that pieces of Baby’s body embed deep into his guts.
They pull apart.
Castiel wants...wants so very much...wants to answer but he still can't seem to make his mouth move, still can't seem to reveal himself.
And then Dean finally learns what had happened to Ai’s son, why she had been so afraid.
Sam holds him by the arm. He guides Dean to his feet. He presses Dean’s forgotten phone into his hands.
Heads close together, they watch the little video snippet craning their necks over Cas’ phone screen.
Cas looks down at his lap, takes such a sharp breath then, a breath that sounds like a half-formed sob, as if Cas is desperately trying to keep himself calm.
It wasn’t just the fact that they kept waking up and going to bed in the same room (Cas’, if anyone cared to know). Or that every time someone tried to make plans with Dean, he would say, “Yeah, I’ll have to check in with Cas. See if that’s okay” (“What, are you married to him, Dean?”). Hell, it wasn’t even the fact that Dean had started beckoning Cas over with absent-minded “honey”s and “sweetheart”s whenever he wanted Cas to take a look at their faulty electricity bill.
He goes slowly, lets his feet drag over the carpet and lets the noise of his arrival carry over. When Dean hears, he lifts his head and he looks at Castiel, sunken tired eyes, body taut with tension.
(See the end of the chapter for
It’s where they keep their spare phones.
And Cas expects Dean to go on. Cas wants Dean to ramble, like he just did himself, but Dean doesn’t. Dean holds it in, and Cas grits his teeth, feels a weight settle back onto his shoulders and air that won’t leave his lungs and, “Stop it,” Cas says. “Stop doing that, Dean.”
“Then we should get
sleep a little. He falls into a pleasant slumber, only for the sound of hushed voices waking him up.
But Cas remembers or something in him sparks because there’s light that Sam blinks away and then Dean’s fine.
. So it’s no wonder that Cas knits his eyebrows together and gets all squinty after that.
He’s over by the counter with the man and they’re on their third shot. Cas has never seen Dean with a man before, but he’s seen plenty of women, so he knows that he won’t be sleeping in Dean’s bed tonight.
Sam and Castiel organize a hunt, one that puzzles even Castiel’s ancient mind.
The next day, Mrs. Christian was as busy as a bee. To be fair, she had always been this way, but knowing now that the fate of the town was resting on her shoulders, she got out of bed with purpose anew, ready to seize the day. By six o’ clock that Friday morning, she had already dealt with all matters pertaining to her business and her contract with Millionaire Milk Inc. (quite an accomplishment as she had only risen from bed an hour earlier). After making sure all her livestock was fed (by bossing around her new site manager), she finally had breakfast at seven-thirty, and then, after her fruitful conversation yesterday with Cookie Baker, she prepared to meet the lesbian restaurateur for eight o’ clock sharp as they had agreed upon yesterday morning (their one o’ clock appointment had been rescheduled after Eve Christian’s sobbing session had taken up too much of Cookie’s free time on Thursday).
“Forget it,” he says again.
He’s not sure where he is.
They squabble a lot. Sam and Dean. They squabble because every bad habit that Jack learns, they only have themselves to blame.
What did I do wrong? Dean had asked him again and again over the years. Why did you leave me?
When Dean’s phone goes missing, the mystery’s solved when they reach the motel room and Jack’s eyes are fixated on the screen.
Dean’s prayer is a whisper. But Sam hears it all the same.
to find her. I need to take her back from Castiel. I need to keep our family together. Baba died the same day Mom left. All I had—all I had were my two sisters. And then she went through the g-gate. A-a year ago. We’ve had victims come back years later…changed. Is that—is there a cure to the angel madness, to the claiming marks? Has Castiel promised to release your mother? Is—is that why you’re here, carrying out a mission for them, the angels? Because then…I’d do it, too. I’d do it in a heartbeat.”
Dean stops walking.
Cas just stares at him.
“Dean, please,” he says and Dean says, “I’m okay with you begging,” and he slips into bed, pulls Cas’ frail form into his arms and kisses Cas’ temple, lingers his mouth over Cas’ cheek and Cas stiffens and Cas says, “You smell like drink.”
, Cas says.
“Should’ve done this a long time ago,” Dean mumbles.
A month later, Dean carries Cas in his arms down the bunker’s hallway and lays him onto their bed.
“Don’t tell Sam about what I’m going to do,” Dean says, but Sam’s there, just a dozen feet away in the bunker’s parking garage where Dean’s got Cas trapped in a circle of burning holy oil and he’s got his thumb on Cas’ cheek and Cas is pressed against the wall, waiting with bated breath.
“Will do, sweetcheeks. Now do me a favour and switch out the sheets of our bed, too? They’re due for a wash.”
For a moment, he thinks it’s snowing. He sees it, heavy and harsh, but when nothing falls onto his face, he stirs. The angel’s stupid fur coat is wrapped around his body, encasing him, mirroring the warmth of his night-black wings. Dean sits up, shivers when the coat slips off from around his shoulders, still shirtless, finds that he’s in some sort of cave, the early hours of morning creeping in.
Because a guard comes running through the crowd, and it’s Aarif, and he’s panting hard.
“I should probably just go with you,” Dean says, and they ride the ambulance together all the way to the hospital. Dean is a nice guy who holds Cas’ hand the whole time, even though Cas can’t bear to look at him (looking at his chiseled chest is a lot easier).
Sam pretends to wake up.
This thought makes Castiel’s heart beat faster—Dean is
“Tell me,” Cas says.
He stayed where he was, for such a long time that it seemed that the temperature dropped a few more degrees, and their bodies felt like ice, but finally, when Mrs. Christian thought she could take no more, Dean pulled himself up at last and went into his home.
“Why’d you leave me?” Dean wants to say but he doesn’t because Cas is fast asleep in the backseat of the Impala. Killing God has left him weak. Almost human.
Dean’s heart thumps hard in his dread.
Please take care of Dean.
Dean straightens up. His hand shakes against the grate.
“What’s your name?” Cas asks. “Why am I here? What are we going to do?”. So to avoid making it seem like a kidnapping situation, Dean starts kissing him to shut him up, soft little pecks on the mouth that make Cas grin all dopey and lean back, giving him enthusiastic pecks in return, and Cas’ lips are soft, and
,” Dean Winchester said and he once again returned Castiel to his position at the base of the oak tree. Castiel was now well and fully intoxicated, Mrs. Christian observed, and it took some skilled maneuvering on Dean Winchester’s part to extract the city man who was clinging to him like a koala bear to a tree. “You stay right here, alright, sweetheart? Let me talk to Sam and then we’ll get you home, okay?”
It’s a bit of a hassle filling out the paperwork. They have about a hundred fake addresses and Dean doesn’t really remember which one.
Not after this, when he thought that he never could even if he wanted to.
“Dean, he doesn’t want to see anyone.”
He had not known what spell she had used.
Maybe Belphegor just runs out of things to say because when Cas refutes him a second time, he doesn’t try to pick up the conversation—things just become quiet.
denying this, Sam can’t believe it, so Sam turns and looks at Dean, waiting for Dean to interrogate Cas, switch on the gruff “What did you do?” voice that he uses when Sam’s made a big mistake (like maybe drinking demon blood), but the voice doesn’t come.
“Stay here tonight,” Dean says. Cas says why?
Dean: we can’t do this anymore
Cookie sighed. Fools, honestly!
“Tell me about yourself,” Castiel says and he positions himself at Dean's entrance. "Tell me, grasshopper, and I'll take you."
Everybody’s staring at the bathroom door.
He’s had too many not to know. He’s in the bunker again, in his bed, and Cas—
When Sam pulls out his outfit for Cas, Dean gets even more disgruntled.
It’s Sam who tears the phone out of Jack’s hands.
“You know what happened?” Dean asks and his voice cracks. “I love you and that wasn’t supposed to happen, and no matter how hard I fucking try, I can’t stop. And he’s gonna use it against us. He’s gonna do something stupid for his story, some drama to entertain himself, and it’s gonna be Sam or you and—and I won’t be a-able to choose. I won’t be able to choose, damn it!”
“Of course, it was harder back in the day. He had a wife, and my African heritage didn’t make it any easier for the two of us to associate with one another for quite some time but…when we were together—hell, it sure was worth it.”
Cas just stares at him.
And Cas’ eyes are curious again. Cas looks down at Dean with a strange, strange expression on his face, as if he’s not sure why Dean’s got his hands on him, why the only expression on Dean’s face is that of reverence. Cas’ wings flare out, cast a shadow over both of them, before they fall back gently to the edges of the bed. He gazes down at Dean with the same intense look in his eyes that he’d had when he’d watched Dean being kissed.
They blame Dean for what’s happened. They blame him for consorting with the angel at the wall. They tell the entire camp, that the mark on his shoulder is a sign of what he’s been doing in secret (even if the council doesn’t know anything about it), and they hold him responsible for his mother’s condition.
Within five minutes, the graveyard had been empty.
The peanut butter sticks to the tiles.
with all of this, something wrong with what Cas is saying.
And that’s it.
, Dean can already picture him saying.
This time when Dean runs, it’s a lake that comes up, the angel from the wall curled up at its sandy shore. Dean approaches him warily, but tonight, he doesn’t look menacing at all. There are no massive fur coats to hide behind. There’s no goddamn smirk adorning the angel’s features.
Who would have thought that Dean Winchester would be such a gentleman?! He almost had Mrs. Christian fooled, but then she recalled how that little Satan devotee had chatted so casually about being a serial killer in Cookie’s diner just this morning, and Mrs. Christian once again felt her body go cold.
He’s gone.
angel.
Sam tells him that it’s been 666 days.
Cas doesn’t end up moving from Dean’s bedroom. He doesn’t because when Dean finally braves walking in, he finds Cas tossing and turning in bed delirious with a fever.
“Jack was up trying to decode the message on his cereal box apparently. I told him I would help him with it in the morning.”
“Oh, yeah? If you want me to suck you off so bad, Cas, why don’t you just say it.”
Especially when they’re hiding a secret.
Or maybe that’s just Cas’ fantasy because another fifteen minutes later, the demon starts up again.
, because
He doesn’t know when he fell asleep. Or how long he’s been dreaming. But suddenly he’s aware of Cas, sitting at his side, his wings drawn around Dean and their bed still on the deserted island from the night before.
Dean clenches his jaw and leaves.
Awkward.
Sam turns bewildered to Cas. Cas who’s been sitting in the kitchen quietly. Cas who’s staring at the floor without saying a damn word.
, and after that, it becomes so quiet that Sam wonders if they both fell asleep.
. Real wings with gleaming black feathers interspersed with the darkest blues, purples and reds. Feathers that Sam had
Today, when Dean seats himself on the bed, the angel trails his fingers over it.
“I’m sorry,” Cas says. “I’ve been a poor friend.”
And Dean’s grasping his hand again, as if seeking an anchor, looking down at their entwined fingers, as he rubs circles into Cas’ skin with his thumb. He drops his head onto Cas’ shoulder, leans into him, and like the sad pair of friends in the movie that they just watched, Cas tentatively wraps an arm around him.
He should be
Cas averts his.
Belphegor grins, starts moving ever so closer, as if he intends to kiss him. Cas should smite the creature before him, should turn its body to dust, but it’s
and he's not coming back.
It’s the next morning and Sam’s a buffer at the table for them.
Dean’s starting to hate this guy’s guts. His voice is annoying, so goddamn annoying, but even Dean knows that for once, this man does have cause for complaint because the closet’s so small and with three of them in here, they can barely breathe, let alone move.
. He mumbles
“What are you going to do?” Cas asks, and his eyes are focused on Dean’s face, but they flick away for the briefest second, meet Sam’s chest and Cas knows, Sam realizes. So maybe Sam should stay where he is. “These are drastic measures, Dean.”
But he says something then.
Dean drives them home. Cas sits in the backseat, curled up against the window. It looks like he’s sleeping but he’s not.
Cas doesn’t change. Not his face. Not the way he looks at Dean so intensely, because he always has. But Dean reaches out with his hands and runs them over the markings as if they’re foreign. Dean touches the muscles of Cas’ bare chest and Cas jerks at the sensation.
Dean rubs Cas’ back.
So, anyway, point is Sam’s angry—at Dean, at Mom, at Cas—and when he’s putting together a little salad in the kitchen, it’s not a surprise that his mind immediately turns to revenge when he notices that Dean’s forgotten his cell phone on the counter beside the fridge.
So Dean’s pressing his hand to the grate. It’s why he’s clawing at the the damn, damn freezing metal in an act of such goddamn desperation and it’s why, “
, making lightning pour through the sky in a terrifying weather display with every step that he takes. A warrior of God, Dean reminds himself. A warrior dressed in robes like Dean's seen a hundred times in portraits depicting heaven's armies except Cas' robes are black. Cas' garments are so fucking sheer that they do nothing to hide every tattooed inch of his skin, every muscle, every part of him bare to showcase his splendour.
that what he’s been doing has been wrong.
But she won’t.
Cas knows that it’s not appropriate to leave in the middle of a conversation. He knows that because every time he does it with Dean, Dean usually gets annoyed, follows Cas and yanks him back by the shoulder to demand what’s up (a lot of times, Dean is right, and something is usually “up” with Cas, and Cas ends up rambling and Dean’ll sigh and,
“Dean, please,” Cas says.
Years and years, Sam’s endured Dean’s pining.
Seeing Cas’ body would shatter him.
person.
Cas is watching him with unwavering eye contact and Dean looks at him, stares back before turning his back to the whole scene.
And Dean’s jumping out of his chair, picturing a million nightmares, that maybe the dentist is going to have to pull all of Cas’ teeth out or
They continue the hunt.
The voice on the other end stays quiet.
“And the demon who’s carrying out this scheme…their name?”
Dean hadn’t had a new girlfriend in six months. Cas hadn’t brought someone home in ages.
It’s hard enough. It’s hard enough lying in bed on his side,
Dean’s awake and he thinks that Sam’s asleep but he’s wrong so Sam hears everything that Dean whispers to the night.
“You’re too overprotective. And it’s…suffocating, Dean. I…I feel as if maybe a break…would do us some good.”
He must be drunk and he must not have realized it.
He’s thinner. He’s scrawny in his
Dean won’t be able to
The blizzard seems to ease for a moment. There's something about what Dean's said that seems to interest Cas, that makes the feathers on Cas’ wings raise as if in excitement. When Cas looks up at him this time, his eyes are dark, pupils blown wide with desire, and his voice seems to sing to Dean.
Except rituals in this godforsaken camp are just the goddamn day-to-day and his silence is intolerable. So it only takes one councilwomen to raise her hand in protest for something to happen. It takes one mere second for a council guard to come stomping over and spit, “Did you hear that, Winchester? They’re asking for your name.”
“Sorry,” Dean mumbles to Cas, and for the rest of the night, everything’s quiet.
“He’s hungry,” Dean says.
And Dean’s heart swells then. A strange euphoria that runs through his body because maybe—maybe Cas recognizes something. Maybe Cas is remembering because it’s really
There’s an hour. There’s two.
But before Mrs. Christian could begin to theorize who Woody’s mystery lover had been, Dean Winchester spoke then, suddenly and brokenly, as if something that he had been keeping at bay for years could no longer be contained. He shook mightily, one hand clenched into a fist at his side, but when his voice at last escaped his throat, it was but a whisper.
For a long time, all Dean’s aware of is the silence of their misery and the wetness of Cas’ tears making the fabric of his shirt thick and heavy.
Cas looks down at the menu, squints at the items and points at what they’d decided on earlier. He looks to Dean for confirmation, but Dean gives him an icy look in return and Cas kind of shrivels, his smile fading and he says
He stayed limp, a lifeless body, blood still running down from his forehead.
Not more than a second later, Dean and Cas enter the room.
And then they’re there.
When Cas does return, he’s not in his boxers anymore. He’s not so uncovered. He’s dressed.
“It wasn’t as potent as I thought,” he tells Dean and Dean looks relieved. “It should wear off in a mere fifty-nine hours.”
Cas wants them gone.
, Dean thinks before he wonders why he cares so much.
Then he shows.
Dean Winchester, for his part, seemed somewhat melancholic all of a sudden. When Castiel tangled his fingers in Dean’s hair, this time Dean reached up and caught Castiel’s hand, pressing a kiss to it swiftly. And then he turned around, knelt in front of the city man, and swallowing hard as he often did, “Cas, there’s something I gotta tell you,” he said, just as the city man leaned forward and captured Dean Winchester’s mouth with his own.
This time, Dean rushes to get it.
But it seemed Sam didn’t want to be compliant. Instead, he pointed his gun at Belphegor’s head, advancing slowly. “She doesn’t have a weapon,” Sam said and Belphegor frowned with displeasure. Dean, however, reached to his brother with a shaky hand, clearly afraid.
, and then Dean gets Cas to turn around for his back because Dean’s not sure if he’s ready to go down any further.
. It helps them fit in with the locale, connect with the people better, and it just makes it all around easier to question them if they wear what’s ordinary
, Dean wants to say.
Maybe the silence between them had grown far too long and awkward because Castiel then took a step back and, “Well, I should get back to bed,” he said and Dean nodded, made a little noise in his throat that oddly seemed part-agreement and part-
In his mind, he dares Benny to look. He dares Benny to
So it was no surprise, really, that when the clock struck midnight and Halloween reared its ugly head again, that upon discovering a fluffy black kitten with blue eyes licking its paws and nestling on his bed, Dean immediately called Sam.
It feels like he’s slept a year.
But Dean just about dies when Cas protests with, “But I feel like I’ve always loved him.”
He’s used to sitting here, since falling, used to feeling the dull ache that accompanies every visit, every time that he has to think of him. He’s used to this place, because the day that Dean had died, one moment, he had been descending the stairs of the bunker, offering his comfort to Sam, and in the next, the Woman of Letters had pressed her hand to the banishing sigil and had sent him here, stripped of his grace and left utterly human.
Dean lets Cas go.
Cas safe. That much like how Rufus in this world is Bobby’s gun, despite all of Dean’s goddamned hope, this might not be his Cas. This might still be a Castiel that he won’t be able to recognize, a version who maybe enjoys tempting innocent people to come over the wall for him. To hurt them, maybe.
So the camp had torn the towers down. The camp had turned off the watch lights. And every five metres along the camp wall, they had installed a metal grate covered in protective sigils with which to look out.
“Tell me,” he says.
They can’t sleep. Cas kisses mightily, maybe because he thinks he’s still a raging celestial mass, and Dean’s own reciprocation seems meek and soft in comparison. Dean’s on his back and Cas has got his own legs swung around Dean’s hips and Cas’ fingers are in his hair again.
, Dean.”
“Obviously, I didn’t believe him, Dean. Cas can’t lie to save his life and guinea pigs have been his wishful fantasy for the better part of a decade now. He thinks that we’ve been hiding them from him.”
And Cas seems so happy, too. He seems so pleased and it’s like he can’t stop himself. Cas flutters between those two personas that he seems to have. He wavers and the shy, tame creature that he seems to want to pretend to be melts back into the angel that Dean’s watched in the distance for days now—the one with
That was what Sam had
“You like dancing?” the man says.
The rest of the day, Cas spends his afternoon in Sam Winchester’s apartment. Sam Winchester’s a friendly neighbour who’s had him over a few times, who lives with his girlfriend, and at any rate, Cas agrees wholeheartedly when they bump in the hall and he receives an invitation for beer.
In the morning, he pretends to be okay. In the morning, Sam opens up the books and the websites and the—Dean doesn’t even know because he stops paying attention. Dean doesn’t know what Sam talks about, in those minutes in between research, doesn’t know what they might do to expel the monster that’s taken over Cas’ body, because Dean’s too busy grieving, too busy holding a beer bottle to his lips and when the bottle falls, when it crashes and shatters on the library floor, Sam puts his book away and looks at him.
“What?” Dean says and Sam tiptoes around the door.
Maybe that’s his problem. Maybe it’s because he’s always been like this.
him last night, hadn’t he? He’d
Still nothing.
Dean can feel the power radiating off his body. Dean’s own hands start shaking.
The silence that follows this moment will never be matched.
But it turned out that Dean Winchester said nothing. Several times, he swallowed, worked his mouth as if he had more to say, but not a single word came out. He closed his eyes then, took a deep breath, but then the city man pulled his hand away from Dean Winchester and this seemed to break the elder Winchester brother completely. A small sound came from his throat then, a little whimper that was barely audible to Mrs. Christian’s sharp ears, but it seemed that Castiel did not hear it, for just then his son came prancing down the aisle and asked him if he could buy another cereal box despite not having finished the last one, for he desperately wanted to obtain the special decoder ring hidden inside the box that would complete his collection of useless plastic parts that the box promised would reveal a secret message.
Dean starts walking again.
“When is Sam returning?”
“Three years,” Dean says and thinks,
It doesn’t occur to him, when it happens. When between daydreams, his eyes close and he slips into sleep, and even here, it’s the same thing on his mind, the same person like always.
warning: implied suicide attempt in the the last three paragraphs of the flashback at the beginning of this chapter. Feel free to skip it if it's an uncomfortable topic for you. The rest of the story will read just fine without it.
His lets his fingers brush over his lips.
Maybe that dog tag’s a gravestone that was etched the day Dean Winchester fucking died.
“Dean,” Cas says, a murmur, and he closes his eyes and he falls asleep.
When neither of them offer an opinion, Sam pulls into the lot of a fast food restaurant.
“I don’t want anything,” Dean says.
Dean stares at him for a moment, still bleary-eyed from sleep, and then he leans forward and brushes his lips against Cas’ chin.
And then the swarm of demons descend down upon him.
Oh, god, Dean had said. Oh, god. I nee—needed you. I n-needed you.
And he never says anything.
He’s right.
Cas tells him that he realizes that his advances earlier tonight made Dean uncomfortable.
He’s in a car, alone, in the middle of the freaking woods, and it’s kind of foggy out—getting kind of scary. He spots a letter then, pinned to the window and, “Your brother’s been kidnapped by a witch,” he mumbles while he reads the note, and, “Found your stupid car and left you here.”
. Cas’ tongue seeks entrance to Dean’s mouth and Dean just lets him, so eager, all of his previous convictions gone in an instant, and he wonders briefly if it’s Cas who’s doing this to him, making him want the angel so bad. But then he finds that he’s hard for the first time in months, finds that he doesn’t care what the damn truth is, not when he’s arching up against the angel who’s got him ensnared. It’s just the same—it’s just the same feeling over and over again reverberating throughout his goddamn mind.
“Can I just call you Cas?” Dean says.
It happens that he hears whispers, eventually a break to the endless silence, and then it grows into chatter, loud, loud excited conversation in Enochian. There are smatterings of light in places, flashes, and every flash illuminates a fearsome form, taller than mountains, some bodies with multiple heads, other with more wings.
Dean grins.
Sam shifts uneasily on his feet. The bunker kitchen is cold. “Haven’t seen you in months, Cas.”
“Be careful,” Dean said, just as Castiel stepped into the demon's territory, just as his shoe scuffed away the last of the red paint that had bound the demon in place, and just as Eve shed her last couple of tears, wiping the paint completely away to break the devil's trap.
Sam looks at him hopelessly, watches him as Dean’s mind races, and for a moment, Dean thinks maybe this is it, thinks maybe the promise that he made that felt so unbreakable just a second before can be broken after all, and maybe that’s why, amidst all the despair hanging over them, he looks to the star, says what he needs to say, maybe the last words left locked away in his chest.
Dean thinks about how it’s the middle of the night but Cas is holding a plastic bag in his hand and he’s tossing his clothes into it.
Sam isn’t satisfied.
“Why?”
But then there’s a message that pops up on the screen.
, those wings—just so damn
“You think I deserve to die?” Cas says and Dean feels himself shatter.
Sam doesn’t open the text.
Turns out that Castiel, hunter-in-training, master of smitey looks, angel of the Lord, and mighty fearsome warrior of God, is a
There’s a frantic race for the books then, Sam and Dean, endless, endless reading as they try to figure out their mess.
“Let Cas rest in peace.”
And then he turns his attention to Cas.
For a long time, Cas is quiet. He keeps his wings limp while Dean fixes his ruffled feathers, and when the awkward position makes it hard to reach, Dean tells him to sit. Without protest, he pulls himself up and Dean leans up against the wall, Cas cross-legged at his feet, and barely registering the time that passes, Dean works.
, and
It gets to him in a whole new way.
He’s alarmed, and he shakes Dean’s shoulder a little harder. Cups Dean’s face in his hand and directs Dean to look at him. “Hey, Dean, come on. Come on. Get up, Dean.”
Sam watches over his shoulder as Dean fumbles through a cabinet.
They bicker a lot. Lately, it’s just what Cas and him do. Dean knows that his anger’s misdirected. He knows that Cas was just trying to save his ass when Cas decided to stick it to Billie, but cosmic consequences—they scare him. He’s sick of cosmic consequences. He’s even sicker when Cas is the one who might have to face them.
And there’s pain then, fresh pain, and it hurts even worse when Cas pulls off of him and retreats and doesn’t answer Dean’s question. He just says, “I don’t want us to share this bed anymore,” and he pulls the sheets over his form and waits for Dean to leave.
But of course they will.
“Uh, you can keep the coat, Cas,” Dean says hastily, and waves his hand, and Cas prays that he’ll never have to see this man again. “I—I can come ‘round later to collect it?”
So, “I’m hungry,” Dean says.
Dean kicks the closet door, and when that doesn’t work, they push, all of them except that the old man throws a hissy fit as he’s made to work, and it’s to no avail because the bed blocking the closet door is just too heavy and they can’t get it to budge.
Dean watches him, watches his face, waiting to see some sign of a lie, something to let Dean know that he ought to get away if he can. But as if sensing Dean’s doubt, the angel says,
“Y’know, I did tell you guys some of the truth,” the demon said. “I do wanna watch my movie and I
Maybe it's just the nature of dreaming. Maybe it's the reality when the angel says that lies don't belong in dreams, because Dean can't hide his frustration anymore. When Dean wakes up, his old plan to woo the angel into submission will be in fucking shambles. And then he'll never be able to get away.
It’s not that the gate is some kind of drawbridge. It’s not that you have to move because it needs rope to be lowered down. It’s because of the wall. It’s because of what might be waiting on the other side.
The angel behind him remains quiet, but when Dean starts gasping for air, the angel's frantic, too. His wings quiver and thrash, the tear tracks on his cheeks gleaming in the moonlight as he moves, and Dean focuses on his face desperately, as if that can remind him that Cas is okay, that Cas isn't over there, in the place where the goddamn camp disposes of angels. Maybe it works a little, because when he braves a look back across the lake, the woods are gone and it's the open sea that greets him.
, the angel says.
Cas grips him tight.
Cas kisses his neck and Dean almost says
tattoo, Cas says in a strangely theatrical fashion: “
Don’t tell Sam.
It’s like the graveyard, Castiel thinks.
anyway next chapter out tmr, same time :) dean and cas' first date...
Or maybe he’s just waiting to hear Dean sing more praise.
Dean's
He offers to drive through the night while Sam sleeps.
and Dean Winchester, shouting,
“No, you idiot,” Dean says, and unexpectedly, he grabs Cas’ hand. They stand there, at the foot of their bed with fingers entwined, and Dean looks at him with soft eyes. “I’m not mad at you.”
At the same time that Cas had died.
But maybe he’s a liar even to himself because he tries to say it regardless.
“When have we ever been friends, Ev—”
you? Ever reached between your legs at night, and—”
“What is this beast? I’ve never seen it in all of Creation.”
“I shouldn’t have hit you so hard,” Sam had explained, and while Dean had narrowed his eyes in a lethal stare, Cas’ eyes had dawned with realization, and he’d forgiven Sam rather quickly.
Dean fumbles for him in the dark, grabs onto him and hangs on for dear life. Cas keeps his arms at his sides, resists every instinct to take a hold of him. Dean buries his face into the crook of his neck and gasps. Dean clutches the lapels of Cas’ coat in his fingers and mumbles about Michael, how he’s still here, how he’s still dragging Dean down.
And Sam’s just
Dean’s still hard and wanting, but now he realizes that he's just made the biggest fucking mistake of his life and Cas is going to hate him.
“Oh, is
Dean’s going to die if Cas doesn’t do something.
Mrs. Christian, however, could at the very least say that she was no stranger to being locked in—or out, for that matter. It had been an unfortunate quirk of her husband’s. Many times, Mrs. Christian had come home from the shops to find that Mr. Christian had mistakenly latched the door shut with the chain from the inside, thereby making it quite difficult for her to enter despite her key. She would have to call for him then, through the crack of the door, and Mr. Christian would scurry over, quite embarrassed and often red-faced and sweating, such would be the poor man’s humiliation. Oftentimes, he would be unclothed, save for a robe thrown over his body, for he had explained to her that he often latched the door with the chain lock when he showered, afraid of what an intruder might do to him when he was at his most vulnerable. “Oh, you silly man!” she had laughed, for many a time these same nights she had found their house’s backdoor hanging wide open! But he had explained to her that he did not fear intruders coming in through the rear, for his backdoor opened to Woody, as his friend’s farm was that way, and he had assured her that should there ever be any trouble at the front, his good friend would surely come to his rescue, thrusting into his rear.
Cas falling to become human and Dean being ridiculously overprotective.
But for Dean, he never gets the same treatment.
He kisses Cas. On the corner of Cas' mouth. He kisses him and Cas jolts back in surprise; he wasn't expecting this.
Dean sits up then, turns on the lamp and watches over Cas. Cas’ body is still but his hands are clenched tight into fists and his face looks miserable even in sleep.
. But it’s fearmongering. Cas didn’t come with a goddamn army. It wasn’t like Cas was there to bring war.
At this, the child frowned once again.
There’s an awkward silence after that, one that only breaks with the occasional squeak from the Impala’s wheels as they turn more corners, as they drive on and get closer to meeting their destination.
He opens his mouth. Adjusts his tongue so that when he says Dean’s name, it will come out in the same sharp authoritative tone as the Cas of Amara’s world likes to speak in, likes to
It’s like this because Dean finally releases Castiel’s hips. It’s like this because Dean’s hands move up and embrace Castiel, and suddenly it is warm and tender like it had been in that graveyard and Dean—Dean suddenly says, “I miss you, Cas.”
“I know,” Dean says and his voice cracks on the last word. “I know.”
Solitary confinement.
They’re in Dean’s room.
Sam sighs.
there, making him so guilty for what he did in the last few months, ignoring Bobby and Sam, ignoring his brother’s pleas for help to find Mom.
But what Mrs. Christian had just envisioned was not what happened.
He’s lonely, Sam knows. Sam’s seen him, lying in bed, or pacing restlessly in the apartment because it’s not like Cas needs to sleep. Sam’s seen Cas. He’s seen that all Cas does now is stay in that apartment and wait for Dean to pray and call him down for help, like they’ve always done with Cas.
At least,
“Uh,” Dean says.
Then Sam had told him what they had done to Cas’ body.
“Aw, Cas,” Belphegor sang, “if you want that information, well…you know what you gotta do.”
But then Dean drops his hand.
Until she saw
“So,” Sam says and he sounds very awkward. Cas knows that Sam is awkward because Cas is very awkward himself, and if he can notice Sam’s awkwardness, too, then it can’t be a good thing for Sam. “I’m sorry for, uh, walking in on you guys this morning.”
real.
666 days.
They stand in the doorway of the bunker. Cas is wearing a new trench coat, a new blue tie from an old barn years ago and an expression on his face that makes Dean feel like something ominous is about to happen. Cas' eyes dart to his and then he reaches with his fingers outstretched, presses two to Dean's forehead.
Cas? he says.
That night, Dean’s too touchy. That night, Dean’s so impatient to start again what happened in the morning that they find shelter while the sun’s still setting, when they could go further, walk longer, but they don't. Maybe his hunger shows through because Benny doesn’t mention taking turns to keep watch tonight—he just says
Oh, how loudly she gasped! Oh, how in all her years of marriage, she had never seen such a horrendous thing! God, right there, for all the universe to see, Dean Winchester was tenting in his pants, all of his arousal on display to the universe like a dancing bear at the circus!
Their food comes.
Cookie, does it also say
“Cas is sending me back.”
Okay, the thing about the kitten was…well, it was kind of actually really fucking cute.
Sam narrows his eyebrows. Had they lied to him? Was there a war going on?
Cas takes his place among them.
Belphegor put her hands up in surrender. “Okay, okay, gotcha. Didn’t know he was your boyfriend already, geez.”
“Yeah, angel? What, by fucking me in the same room my mother’s in?”
It’s not the first time that he’s done this.
Dean sits cross-legged next to her, takes the angel’s black fur coat and wraps it around her. But within moments, he’s numb. His fingers start aching painfully, and if he’s not careful, it’ll be frostbite before the end of the night. It’s Monique who reminds him that he’s being stupid.
Castiel tries to say something.
He’s gone.
. Cas nods. Cas is a groaning, shuddering mess, eyes closed as he’s breached, still a little loose from the morning, and Dean can't help it. Dean gasps for every breath, struggles for it, because Cas—he’s the goddamn most beautiful sight that he’s ever laid eyes on.
I thought— Dean had said. I thought you were with him. With the man.
But of course they did. Two members of the council had been present, too. They hadn’t found anything.
The walls in the bunker are thin.
“Were you teasing like you’ve been teasing me for days, Cas? Were you—”
The angel comes back nearing nightfall. Daylight’s dying and the woods are becoming dark and uninhabitable again. Dean shudders violently with every blast of cold air that makes it into the cave. All day, he thinks about running away. All day, he can’t get himself to budge.
When morning comes, he doesn’t let the officers see him. He can play it cool—years of pretending to be something that he’s not makes it easier than it should be. He’s calm enough when he signs off. Over the box where it asks him to report any unusual activity, he neatly writes
Kinky Secrets for the Secret Submissive
and another chapter down and three more to go! hope your holidays are going well! i will have another cracky chapter out tmr featuring dean visiting woody at his farm, cas dealing with the aftermath of his binge-drinking, and more cracky stuff like...well, you'll see........
When he calls out Cas’ name, relentlessly, relentlessly—when he’s stopped caring about the angels, some young, some ancient because they died first—when he doesn’t care for them anymore when they go quiet so abruptly whenever he screams Cas’ name, it’s then that they start talking to him.
“I’d do anything for you,” Dean says. “Anything, Cas, anything. Just—just…”
But shush.
Dean is drunk. Dean is so drunk that Cas knows that it would be inadvisable to drive, and because Dean would never let someone else touch the Impala, Cas will have to find some other way to get him home.
