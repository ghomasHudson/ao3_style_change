Sherlock must not have said it right, though, because John turns to face Sherlock, his face distorted by anger and self-loathing. "I have failed at everything I have ever wanted to do." He pulls his hand away from Sherlock's so he can hold up his fingers and enumerate: "I failed as a surgeon. I failed as a soldier. I failed as a son and as a brother. I failed as a husband. I failed as a- a friend to you. And, my crowning achievement, I have now failed, utterly and completely, as a father. I mean, I know I didn't have much of a shot at it, but I couldn't even give my daughter a bloody normal set of chromosomes! I don't think there's really anything left," he concludes bitterly.
"This would have been easier if you lived with me."
"Blackbird!" she announces. (
Tristram sits up and takes his phone out. He can't properly see the buttons in the intermittent stripes of light that fall into the cab from the street lamps, but of course he knows where everything is by touch. He pushes '1' and then the call button. The phone buzzes in his ear, and then the chime for an incoming call sounds on his father's phone.
When the bowls arrive, they contain what looks like a small pile of brown spaghetti topped with whipped cream. Despite being curious what exactly the 'spaghetti' (he can tell it's not really worms) is, he doesn't reach for the spoon right away. Neither, he notes, does Emily.
"You've had your fun. Now back off." John still had his hand up, warding Moriarty off. Sherlock wanted to tell John to leave it. Moriarty was no real threat. But the way John had said 'he hasn't trained me' made him keep silent.
John hadn't intended this, hadn't thought this far, but now that he had Sherlock in his arms, chest heaving, loins quaking, hot and damp and keening, it was as if his body took over, a reverse kind of muscle memory: muscle prediction, somehow knowing just where to touch, how much pressure, tongue or fingers, lips or palm. A gentle suck on Sherlock's lower lip making his breath catch. A thumb dipped into the delicate hollow beneath his jaw, where his carotid pulsed fast and strong, eliciting a moan. Drawing up the back of Sherlock's thigh to hitch his leg over John's hip, fingers barely brushing his tender, soft bollocks in passing, and Sherlock's pelvis shot forward as if electrified. Maybe it was just that Sherlock was so primed and on edge that he responded enthusiastically to everything. Anything.
stomach, Gregory Lestrade imperceptibly opened the dark curtain that separated the stage from the overheated room, now plunged into darkness. The control room had turned down the lights. The small group of fans
to create a diversion.
"Sherlock," Greg tried a third time with his voice even lower - and he could almost touch the young man's shoulder - "come on... it's going to be okay now... come (on) with me," he repeated, "look, it's just you and me, there, like at the beginning..."
A brief search led the doctor to Instagram. A tidal wave of clichés then swept across the screen of his laptop. Sherlock on stage, eyes closed, air inhabited. Sherlock at a press conference, Gregory Lestrade's arm surrounding his shoulders, as if he wanted to protect him.  Sherlock in the studio, headphones on his ears smiling at a man as tall as him, in a three-piece suit leaning on an improbable umbrella. Sherlock, looking tense, beside a very blond man with golden glasses who had laid his hand on the musician's hand.  Sherlock standing, head a little bent, chin resting on an electric blue violin. Sherlock, reddened eyes, exhausted air, coming out of a box. A photo, obviously stolen, then caught John's eye. A young man stood behind Sherlock, very stiff, pale in colour; he embraced her possessively, his lips placed at ear level; it seemed as if Sherlock was trying to free himself from an embrace he didn't want. This last cliché, more than anything he had just discovered, upset John, without him understanding the reasons for the unease that was growing in him.
Sally looked at him with an intrigued eye, looking for an answer, but Greg had already grabbed the musician's scarf, placed on a stool near the instruments, (had already) left the stage and rushed like a madman backstage
A burning image suddenly emerges in him. Victor, imperious, superb, dictating to him gestures that he would not have been able to find alone. Victor imposing his law, devouring him with caresses, forbidding him pleasure.  Victor pressing his hands relentlessly on his loins to make him bow and open more. Sherlock, kneeling before him, his mouth open, welcoming his pleasure. Victor, his throat stretched to the extreme, thrown back, his hard and authoritative hands in his hair, a single word to his mouth as pleasure swept through him as he deprived his lover of it.

All the pleasure he took a year ago to sing on stage, to commune with his audience had disappeared, dissolved in the collaboration that his record company imposed on him with this author, the half failure of his last album, the pressure from the fans, the weight of his team's nervousness and, what was more, the feeling that Greg and Mycroft were damn right to be worried for him. Desperately repelling the urge to go slap Moriarty and leave the set, he looked at the drummer and threw the first song with the agreed sign. His voice landed on the first chords, so low and deep that, on the stage, all the tension accumulated during the previous hours seemed to vanish into the notes and the bewitching harmony of the instruments and voice.
"Of course you don't care, you only think about yourself, as usual... The others are never your problem, are they? Not even your musicians or Molly of course... You know very well that we're on the edge... Everyone's counting on tonight's concert to get the machine running again. If you keep playing the diva, you'll get yourself killed. And you're going to drag the whole team into your slump... There are people who need to pay their bills, you know... people who do their jobs without swallowing tons of pills. Give them to me," Greg said, stepping forward towards Sherlock who had turned white when he heard the accusations.
crescendo and rise into a paroxysm of desire
"Again, Tim? But you already have one yesterday! Besides, shouldn't you be in college? "Sherlock felt a certain tenderness for the frail teenager in whom he felt a whole world of fragility. For a few months, Tim had been following Sherlock everywhere. He seemed to have made the musician his star, until he went camping from time to time at the bottom of Baker Street so as not to miss any movement of his idol. Sherlock had been discreetly informed about the teenager. He lived more or less on the street with a network of homeless people and went to college very irregularly.

The door was slightly ajar allowing a cold draft to pass through. The winter spittle had soaked the threshold and Greg was forced to step over the puddle that had formed to venture onto the platform that was bathed in darkness. The clouds concealed the moon, and the place, bristling with chimneys, seemed deserted.  The blue neon lights of the theatre flashing just below illuminated the whole area with a pale glow. At a quick glance, Greg scanned the solitary place. From where he was, however, Greg could not see the entire platform. A duct higher than another in front of him, hid from him the whole part of the roof that gave onto the facade. He moved a little further forward and in an instant he was soaked by another bitter gust. Fighting against the wind, his hand above his eyes to shield against the rain, he took an uncertain step towards the part of the roof that was still hidden from him. There was no point in calling. The gusts would have covered the sound of his voice. He could only move forward against the wind, taking care not to slip over the puddles that flooded the ground. Suddenly, his foot caught in a cable, hidden in the dark, and he almost fell. He clung to a chimney as best he could, swearing, and it was at that moment that he saw him from behind, a little further away, sitting on the low wall on the facade at the edge the roof.
It was as if a threatening signal had been given. Moran replied in a frosty voice, waving to everyone to prepare to leave, with a condescending gesture of the hand.
At first, John heard nothing, he was going to reopen his eyes, still expecting a usual Sherlock spin, when he felt shy lips landing on his cheek, just at the corner of his own lips, then approaching his mouth, leaning more firmly, then with an exquisite softness, slightly opening up. There was a slight hesitation, almost a withdrawal, and again John felt the detective's lips come and pick up his own and offer them a light touch, full of a promise that had never before been spoken aloud.
Your sense of self-preservation is not especially developed, you know," the doctor nodded with a half smile that revealed how little confidence he had in Sherlock's promises. "We know when you leave, but we don't know when or in what condition you return," he added with a grin... He always held Sherlock's shoulder firmly as if, by this pathetic gesture, he was preventing him from  leaving their sanctuary.
The press officer then meekly handed a file to the musician.  "Eight weeks of non-stop TV and radio coverage. Makeover in two weeks.  Visit a high school, with your Birmingham fan club. Appearance in two fashion shows this week. Ah, you also have a promotion day planned in Ireland and another one in Scotland. "But Moran interrupted the young woman with a voice that suffered no remark.
Greg, his stomach tied by anxiety, turned again to Sally Donovan, who looked at him with a sorry and helpless look. The artist had never done this to them before. They had had everything else... panics, whims, anger, but he always showed up on stage at the scheduled time. Always.
"Your wife just left you, you got drunk last night because you realized she was going to go elsewhere, you got beaten up by her new boyfriend and your tabloid  wants to fire you. No wonder, on your own, with your questions, you will lower the IQ of the entire editorial staff!
"Don't complain," Molly slipped (Molly) in his ear as she took him with her to the kitchen, "I avoided you Moriarty. Mr. Magnussen wanted him to come. But I managed...," she added, squinting at her mouse snout. Sherlock waved at her a little waving as he pointed to the others.
"Sally, you're handling the scene...? I, I..." He stopped, carried his hand to his phone, which was vibrating insistently in his pocket.
"Shut up. "You're only here at Magnussen's request and I swear to you..."
Sherlock grabs his phone. He quickly created a new contact and fidgeted a short message.
"Yes, I have a question. Have you thought about my beloved little pills? "Without saying a word, Sally rummaged through her bag and handed
Tristram is pretty pleased with himself for figuring it out. He's getting chilled too, standing there in the wet grass with only his thin jacket on. He should go on to Grandmother's studio. He's bothered by a niggling doubt, though. He wants to check whether he's right. One quick look in the stable. Maybe there's nothing there after all. Just some mice, like Doctor Watson said.
"You can order next time."
Holmes looked as horrified as I had felt at the thought of the rogue touching him. "Never!" he cried. "Watson, that you would think me capable of allowing such a thing! I will be your commander, director and guide. I will select a task I am confident you will be able to master, and you will scintillate. Yes, the more I consider it the more I like it. I think this trial will be quite interesting after all."
"How long--"
He waited for Sherlock to piece it together. To spare him saying the words out loud.
The igloo restaurant is based on the '
"I don't know, I just don't think we should listen." He doesn't know how else to explain it. He's listened in on conversations lots of times, both pretending to be asleep or actually eavesdropping on the stairs or behind cracked doors. He's gained some useful information that way, too, but this is the first time Doctor Watson specifically asked them to leave so that he and Father could talk in private, and somehow, Tristram knows that Doctor Watson trusts them - trusts
By the time Sherlock got home and hooked the lead onto Gladstone's collar, the shock had passed and he was ready to get his thoughts in some semblance of order. He set out, purposely choosing a route that wouldn't take him anywhere near John's neighbourhood or any of the places he and John had been together.
John leans one hand on the back of the desk chair and looks over Sherlock's shoulder at the laptop. "Sorry?"
"I'm fine," he answers, but he's confused. Why should he have fainted? Does John think he's sick?
And on top of everything else, Molly Hooper was also being enormously irritating, acting like they were friends just because she and John got on.
It would have been easier if John were clearly uninterested in anything other than a casual, colleagues-and-occasional-punter-night friendship. Although even that would have been far more intimate - emotionally, at any rate - than any of Sherlock's previous associations. However, despite Sherlock's lack of fluency in the unspoken language of interpersonal relationships, he recognised that John would be more than amenable to exploring further options. It was getting more and more difficult to justify not giving in. Maybe it did come down to the simple fact of him being afraid: of losing control, of the unpredictability, of being hurt.
Sherlock couldn't tell whether John was simply not interested in parroting back his monologues from the previous night, or whether he didn't recall a word. And he couldn't very well sit John down and explain this was for an Important Experiment, because then there would be uncomfortable questions about said experiment and terms like Informed Consent would be bandied about and there would be shouting.
"John, please." Sherlock made a pained expression.
He doesn't think Emily would stop being his friend if Father and John weren't boyfriends anymore. John said he was Tristram's friend too. Maybe they could still go to the park on Sunday morning once in a while and have a bun. And maybe John would still sit in the waiting room while he plays games with Mrs Daniels. Maybe. But there definitely wouldn't be any stories at bedtime or having breakfast together. No more pillow fights. No more of John taking care of his injuries - not that Tristram expects to get hurt that badly again, but he's oddly come to enjoy their little nightly ritual of re-applying bandages and talking about things he'd never talk about with Emily or his father.
"How much longer is it going to take to get better?" he asks, staring at the image on the screen.
The much vaunted light was gone by now, the early winter night having already settled in. The shed had originally been conceived to double as a greenhouse or winter garden, so one wall was almost entirely enclosed in glass. It would really be a fantastic space for an artist's studio, John thought, although Mr Holmes used it for practical carpentry rather than decorative pieces. He showed John some of the finished pieces he hadn't yet found homes for: a sturdy little chess table, a lamp stand, several planter boxes of rough-hewn timbers a neighbour hadn't known what to do with. His current project was a birdhouse, which he unclamped from the vise for John to inspect. "Cliche, but people do love their birds round here and it's the season," he commented.
"Well now, Watson, finish your coffee. Friend Shinwell has invited us to his club, and we will need to stop off at Baker Street first."
(See the end of the chapter for
“Here we are,” declared Sherlock, as he removed John’s blindfold. The moment the had left Baker Street in the cab, Sherlock had insisted on blindfolding John, so as not to ruin the surprise.
Happy Valentines. Meet me at Baker St at 5 for your special surprise. Mrs H can watch Rosie. - SH
John jotted down the name of the hospital and hung up the phone. “Rosie,” he called. “You need to come right now sweetie, we have to go right now.”
John nodded, “Yeah, thanks Mrs H.”
“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean…” John rushed over and took Sherlock’s hand. “Please don’t be mad. You didn’t do anything wrong and this isn’t about you, you’ve been perfect, helping out with the party and everything with us, it’s all great. This is just something I have to figure out, the balance of it all.”
“If you forgive me for this,” Sherlock muttered.
Sherlock turned around and grabbed John, by the shoulders, “John, it is wonderfully sweet that you care so much about this party, but really why are you so worried? It’s going to be fine.”
“I’ve got to,” Sherlock replied. “Rosie will be done with her bath soon and you’ll have to put her to bed. “Good night, John, I’m glad the party was such a success.” And with that he left.
“You’re headed off early. Got a case to see to?”
“It was a blind date, John, set up by a work colleague who was being rather pushy about the whole thing,” Sherlock said somewhat pityingly but not cruelly. “Did you really expect it to go well?”
“Well,” Sherlock replied slyly, “I believe you have my number, Dr. Watson, and I have yours. So I think I give you a kiss goodnight and we make plans to meet again soon, does that sound alright?”
“Everything’s fine, John, I’m at the school now, actually,” Sherlock replied evenly. “Rosie’s teacher just needed some confirmation that it was ok for me to take her home so they asked me to give you a call.”
Sherlock was at the door when he turned back and said, “Oh and just to be clear, John, I do very much want to have sex with you, just when you’ll be able to remember it the next day.” He winked and left the bedroom.
“I’ll drink to that,” responded Sherlock, lifting his glass and slugging down the last of his first pint. And so they did.
“Mycroft this is only our first date. I’m sure with time we’ll figure out exactly how things will work between us,” John managed to respond, still finding it hard to believe he was actually sitting in this car having this conversation with Mycroft of all people. Shouldn’t he be discussing these things with his boyfriend before he got them all squared away with his brother? Was Sherlock even his boyfriend for that matter?
“The ambulance,” Sherlock said, looking worried again. “John, are you sure you’re alright? Are you feeling light-headed?”
“Do I?” Rosie asked, pulling away slightly and smiling up at him brightly.
John was surprised to hear the detective back down on his gibe so easily. Not wanting the moment to turn to heartfelt (for obvious reasons) John quickly made a comeback. “Either way, I still outran you!”
“Say no more,” John whispered back, and they made their way to the bedroom.
“Yes but you didn’t have to say it so... so bluntly.” John was trying very hard to control the volume of his voice so Rosie wouldn’t hear them “She’s my daughter, Sherlock, not yours. It should’ve been up to me to explain that to her.”
“It’s alright John, we’ll talk about it later.”
As they were leaving the shop John took Sherlock’s hand in his. “I’m sorry,” he whispered tenderly in Sherlock’s ear.
“Not a problem, you’ve done that for me many times,” Sherlock said, pecking John on the cheek as he got up from the bed. “Now you take your time with that coffee and when you’re done, we’ll go out and get some breakfast. We don’t have to pick up Rosie until this afternoon.”
“Of course,” Sherlock replied quickly. “I’ll expect you soon.”
“You’re on speaker, John, so you are talking to them, right now,” Sherlock said, trying not to find the situation amusing and glancing up at see the teacher’s reaction.
“Sherlock, I’m fine it’s not a bad cut,” John protested, embarrassed. He couldn’t believe he’d been beaten so easily but it had been a long while since he’d been a in a combat situation.
John agreed and Sherlock walked over to where Rosie was pursuing bins of brightly colored taffies.
“Oh Sherlock! You can be nice when you try, huh?” Molly teased. “And you’ve no right to be jealous,” she added jokingly, “You had your chance.”
“Not as funny as your date not making it past the first course,” Sherlock retorted playfully, as he filled his plate with the contents of the take away boxes. “Are you really that out of practice?”
He and Sherlock had been called to a case by Lestrade: a dead woman found in an alley, just off a busy shopping street, lots of blood and two purses so possibly there was another victim somewhere. It might have been a robbery but the fact the diamond engagement ring was still on the woman’s finger and both the purses they’d found had wallets with money (although it wasn’t much) but no ID’s, pointed towards this being more than just a random crime. That was what made the case interesting to Sherlock and it was why he and John were currently in the alley with Lestrade and his team, trying to lend a hand.
“Oh nonsense, John, you’re always a great help. I wouldn’t be able to solve half the cases I do without you, or at least I wouldn’t be able to solve them as quickly.”
************************
Sherlock chuckled at this.
“Well then I suppose I’d probably best be off too,” Lestrade said. “I’ll call Molly. We’ll all come by tomorrow, but you two can have a moment to yourselves today.”
“Are you threatening me?” John shot back.
“It was just a joke. I like it, really,” Sherlock said with a smile as he set the box down on the bench and pulled John in  for a kiss. “Happy Valentine’s, John.”
“Don’t blame yourself.” Molly rested her hand on his shoulder.
“Hey that’s mine, that’s my drink!” John cried. “You’re a thief! THIEF!” He yelled.
“Pick up the phone, please pick up,” John prayed through gritted teeth. The dial tone blared in his ear as he held his mobile with his shoulder in order to keep both hands on the wheel of the car.
“Yes, it is, and another round would be great, thanks,” John said cheerfully. He felt oddly thrilled by pretending he was on a date with Sherlock to this overly chummy bartender. It was like when he was a kid and he swore for the first time. It was the thrill of saying something he knew he wasn’t supposed to, something that was off limits, but strangely, he wanted to say it anyway.
“You two enjoy your date,” Sherlock called as the couple walked off with a wave.
“She seemed to take it well though.”
“Perfect, because I hear this place has great cheesecake.”
“He’ll pull through,” Mycroft sighed. “He always does. I’ve been here before.”
“What’s that Rosie?” he asked, curiously. “Something for show and share today?”
“John? Why are you calling me?” Sherlock sounded genuinely confused when he answered. John chuckled slightly, knowing Sherlock really didn’t understand why his even best friend would be phoning him when there was such a thing as texting. Sherlock’s little social quirks were really quite endearing
What should I get him?, Sherlock thought, and then the idea came.
“I don’t have to think about it John,” Sherlock’s voice was flat and calm. John didn’t turn to look at his friend, he couldn’t, he had no idea if what was coming was good or bad. “I have feelings for you too,” he said simply.
“Why don’t you fill up a bag with some taffy to share?” Sherlock told Rosie. “Make sure you get all the good flavors,” he added with a smile.
“I’m not mad but you did mean it John and whether or not you meant to, it does hurt to hear you say you don’t think you should be spending so much time with me,” Sherlock said. He wasn’t angry; he wasn’t even being cold; he just sounded small and hurt, like a wounded animal. John squeezed his hand tightly but then Sherlock pulled it away. He walked toward the door and started putting on his coat.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What if, what if he doesn’t get a chance to forgive me though?” John looked up and the fear that he’d been trying to avoid thinking about threatened to overwhelm him.
“It will certainly be a challenge,” Sherlock admitted. “But I think we’re up for it.”
“Well, John is held up in traffic and he asked me to pick up his daughter for him. Rosie, clearly knows me and is comfortable with me watching her until father is able to come retrieve her, but if you’d like I can call John and he can explain the whole situation to you,” Sherlock told her, adopting a falsely chipper air.
“You know it’s ok, right?” she asked.
“But you don’t bring it up! Certainly not as the first thing you say to someone on a first date!” John cried, exasperated. “And stop interrupting me,” he added. “You want to hear the story, let me tell it.”
“Right so baking soda volcanoes, and making slime, you’re sure they’ll like this?” John said nervously, looking at the supplies laid out in his backyard.
“You’re bleeding terribly John, don’t be ridiculous,” Sherlock argued, but his tone was more caring than patronizing. He took off his scarf and pressed it firmly against John’s injured shoulder to stop the flow of blood. “Tell me if this hurts, if I’m pressing too hard.”
**************************************
Sorry this one took so long but I hope it was worth the wait! As always, thanks for reading, commenting, etc!
“Yes, that’s right, but that won’t be an issue anymore,” John continued, sounding irritated now, “Because this morning Rosie asked me if this princess was going to be able to discuss life as a foreign dignitary and affairs of state. And when I said no, the princess would probably just sing some songs and play some games, Rosie said she wasn’t interested in a princess that wasn’t historically accurate and if she couldn’t have that she wanted a science party.”
“Pretty big favor I guess.”
“What about it?”
“Oh great, yeah, I didn’t really get a chance to eat at the restaurant,” John said, stepping carefully over a stack of papers and sitting down. “There a reason you’ve decided to set dinner up on the floor?”
“Certainly no one at Scotland Yard liked it when I showed off my deductive skills upon first being introduced,” Sherlock said ruefully.
“Ah, good you’re up,” Sherlock greeted him cheerily, as he entered the room. “Would you like some tea or coffee perhaps?”
John felt bad for imposing on his friend like this but under the circumstances he didn’t have much choice. “I just got off work at the surgery and I was headed to pick up Rosie but there was some huge accident,” John explained. “They’ve closed off roads; traffic is awful. So if I text you the address do you think you could get Rosie from school for me?”
“Do you think so?” Mrs Stevens asked, sounding frightened.
“There were signs of attraction. I suspected for a couple of weeks that you might be feeling something. Mycroft suggested the restaurant as a way to give things a little push in the right direction and although I normally wouldn’t take his advice on such things, it seemed like a good idea.”
John set his phone back down, feeling more nervous than ever. Perhaps the right time to admit his feelings for Sherlock was going to come sooner than he’d expected.
“Thanks,” said John, taking a sip, and setting the cup down on the nightstand. “Sherlock…” he began nervously. “Last night, I don’t really remember how things ended, did we…” John didn’t know how to finish the question, he was feeling embarrassed and stupid now for having gotten so drunk and making such a fool of himself, even if he couldn’t remember it he knew he must have acted outrageously.
“Alright, not so loud,” Sherlock warned, but no one seemed to be paying them much attention.
“Coffee, maybe?” John mumbled. God, he felt awful. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt so awful… He also couldn’t remember what had happened last night, how had he ended up in Sherlock’s bed?
“She left a bit ago and the waiters already cleared her place,” Sherlock quickly supplied a clearer excuse.
“John she’d already seen us,” Sherlock argued evenly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I… I know this may come as a shock, but... I’ve been thinking about it for a while now and it’s real, I’m not... Overreacting or anything like that… I… Sherlock, you are my best friend. You’re an amazing, intelligent, loyal, brave, caring person and… I think, no, I know I’ve started to develope feelings for you… Feelings that are more than friendship, that are, you know, romantic… And well, there it is, I said it, I’m falling for you Sherlock, and it’s up to you how you feel about that, but I want to see where it goes if you’re interested so I guess… That’s it.” John felt somewhat out of breathe when he finished and he realized he’d been hyperventilating the whole time. He felt even more shaky and anxious now, but the deed was done. He couldn’t take it back, but he could retrieve Rosie and run from what he’d just done. So John made for the door, purposely not looking at Sherlock, but then he was stopped when he felt his friend grab his wrist.
“It’s true.” Mike nodded. “Molly and I have had our rows and we’ve gotten through them.”
Sherlock grinned, “Clever little girl, isn’t she?”
Right, so she saw everything. Now what do I say, how do I recover from this?, John thought, but Sherlock was way ahead of him.
Damn, John thought, I’m really in trouble now.
“Daddy, Sherlock look, I’m all ready for the party,” she cried. She was dressed in a bright floral sundress and over that were a child-sized lab coat and a pair of safety goggles that barely stayed on her face for they were much too big. They both melted at the sight of her, so excited, so proud, and God how fast she was growing up.
“Quite alright, John,” a familiar voice said crisply. “But since we’re both here why don’t we sit back down and have another pint? This one’s on me.” Sherlock took the stool next to the one John had just vacated and flagged over the bartender. “We’ll have two more pints of whatever my companion here was just drinking,” Sherlock requested promptly.
********************************
“Excellent, John,” Sherlock smiled. “Angelo seems to feel he will forever be indebted to me and thus when I asked him to teach me a simple classic dish he agreed.”
“I don’t think that’s the best idea tonight,” Sherlock replied kindly, taking his friend into his room and helping him into his bed.
“Where’d she get off to?” John asked looking around for Rosie’s blonde head.
“You’d better go after her,” Sherlock said with a playful smirk.
Right on cue, the waitress appeared. “Ready to order loves?” she asked.
“Of course dear.” She took Rosie’s hand. “Alright Rosie, say goodbye to everyone, they’ll call when the doctor tells them how Sherlock’s doing.”
“Anyway, I’m just glad you were free. At least I’m still getting dinner,” John said. “I’ve missed our old takeaway spot,” he added with a smile.
“I know, and I want to tell them, I do. Just not yet,” John sighed. He wished he could make Sherlock understand that this was not to do with him, this was just something John needed to work through. He needed to get used to the idea of their relationship before he was ready to share it with everyone else. After years on his own, this was all felt so new and it was a good new, but it still took getting used to.
“Charming,” Sherlock said in return, feigning politeness, “I’m Sherlock Holmes; I’m a friend of Dr. Watson’s.”
Sherlock was normally quite fond of Molly, but today her questions were not welcome. This was only his and John’s first date and he wasn’t ready to tell all their friends what was going on between them just yet.
“Well, considering how the date turned out, I suppose I’m glad you showed up,” John admitted, still unable to look at his friend.
“Thanks again,” he turned and said to Sherlock as he got in.
John made a sulking face, but Sherlock just kissed his head and smiled. “You’ll thank me in the morning,” he said.
“Good,” said Mycroft smiling again. “Because I believe this is your stop. John realized then they had just pulled up to the cafe. He got out of the car and as it drove away, he turned and found Sherlock standing before him.
In the the cab back from the restaurant with Sherlock, John sat quietly, trying not to show that he was overwhelmed by nerves. He hadn’t managed to say what he’d needed to to his friend, hadn’t been able to get the words out of his mouth, even though they’d been running on a nonstop loop in his head. Now his window of opportunity was growing smaller and smaller. He’d already given up the gorgeous, romantic setting of the restaurant dining room. He’d have to settle for a cramped cab… with the driver listening in? No. He couldn’t do it here. He would wait until they arrived at Baker St, but how would he bring the conversation up? THere had been so many clear opportunities at dinner and he’d let them all go. He’d been too nervous, but his apprehension had only grown worse over the course of the meal. How on earth was he going to do this?
Sherlock grinned at him, it was cute really, how much he cared about making Rosie’s birthday perfect. John really was a good father. “They’re six year olds, John, they’ll eat it up,” Sherlock assured him.
Sherlock and John entered the candy shop which was packed with people.
“You know it’s funny, I don’t have much experience in this area but I thought people were supposed to be trying to be charming and likeable on a first date?” Sherlock asked sarcastically.
“Oh really?” John said.
“It is what it is,” they both said softly in unison. They broke their embrace at that moment and pulled away to look at each other, both smiling sadly. The phrase had become a sort of shorthand between them, a way of saying ‘I know life is hard, but I’ll always be there for you’, ever since the day they had made up shortly after Mary’s death.
“How?,” John interrupted his friend’s explanation. “How on earth could you know that? Sarah, from the surgery, set this date up for me; I was meeting a friend of hers. You don’t know her so she couldn’t have told you. And I certainly didn’t tell you so how the hell did you find out?” John was anger was only made worse by his confusion over how the detective had managed it.
John and Sherlock chase down a jewel thief but all doesn't go according to plan.
“Yes I think we are, thanks,” Sherlock replied politely. After he took care of the bill he pulled out his phone and shot off a text to Molly.
“Yes, I’m really turning out to be much more dependable than this friend of Sarah’s aren’t I?” Sherlock joked.
“Isn’t it possible I just wanted a drink and picked this spot coincidently?” Sherlock questioned in an overly innocent voice.
Sherlock shrugged. “She asked me what I liked to. I said 'play the violin and solve crimes' and she thought the second of those things sounded much more interesting,” he explained mildly. “She was a bit of a natural.” Then he smiled slyly. “She’s quite bright for her age, but then of course we know where she gets her smarts from,” Sherlock said smoothly.
“Ok,” John said evenly. “But that still doesn’t explain why you blew up at that woman like that.”
“Oh hell,” John muttered in defeat.
John kissed him on the cheek. “Being your reason is the greatest honor I could wish for.”
“And you’re the most important thing in my life,” Rosie said, wrapping her tiny arms around him in another hug.
John just shook his head. Molly squeezed his shoulder comfortingly.
“It’s a pity Lestrade will get all the credit for my work on the diamond case,” Sherlock commented, after a moment. “But I suppose saving you is something of a consultation,” he added coolly.
“Here we are gentlemen.” The waiter reappeared with the champagne. He popped the bottle’s cork, poured each of them a glass and then set vessel of ice on the table and placed the champagne bottle in it. “Are you gentlemen ready to order or do you need a moment longer with the menu?” He asked politely. John ordered a steak and Sherlock got the lobster, and the waiter left them, promising the wait wouldn’t be long.
"What is this outburst, Sherlock ?  ” asked Greg, whose anger was rising dangerously. What's the point? Why are you attacking me and your brother like this?" You want to hurt us because you and..."
In the morning, his guard at the clinic had been very harsh. A mother had presented with her baby, in an advanced state of malnutrition and with pneumonia that he had had to carry for several days. The small burning body, the protruding ribs, the piercing screams had brutally sent John back to the worst moments of the capture of the village of Châârnafi from the Taliban. These were the complaints of Fayaz that he suddenly heard resounding in him, those he had perceived when, with the men of his group, he found at the end of the village, in the house that the madmen of God had invested, these children taken from their families, hungry, beaten and for Fayaz... even worse than that. It had taken John a huge effort on his part not to suddenly leave the examination room and leave his little patient with another member of the team. Of course, he had held up well. And all morning he had been consulting on consultation after consultation, until the clock delivered and he could rush home, with only one desire in mind, to post on his blog everything that this trying morning had brought out in him.
The first songs followed one another, almost magically. It was perfect. No need to repeat this or that measure. Sherlock had never been better, thought Sally as she looked at the young man who, with his eyes closed, his throat thrown back, swung backwards, wiggling his hips in such a sensual way that the narrow t-shirt he was wearing that night showed the black line of the down that plunged into his jeans. It seemed as if his hips embodied the words he was singing.
"What moment?" scolded the musician as he cut him off, do you think I don't see your little game? "he added in a voice that rage made it more acute now. You think I'm losing it because Vic..." but he stopped suddenly, unable to pronounce the whole name. "...Because, he continued, I haven't composed since..." In his own despair, Sherlock heard himself stop suddenly, looking for his breath. He was going to continue when Moran, Magnussen's right-hand man, cut him off in a bad voice.
faithful beyond all past disappointments, were already pressing ahead, chanting the name of the idol
Uncomfortable with himself, John took up his phone again, taking a mechanical look at the Twitter trends of the moment, as if to screen out those diffuse thoughts that made him shiver without him perceiving the reasons. Suddenly, the #Sherlock hashtag flooded his screen.
His hollowed eyes, when he looked at himself to shave, told him about the months of hospitalization, the suffering, the temptation of the Sig he had kept illegally. When he was washing, he could feel the bones of his hips. He carefully avoided passing his hand over his sex any longer than hygiene required. Anyway, even when he woke up, he was flabby. The burning of the water could not remove the impression of dirt. He rubbed his skin to the blood to get rid of the smell that didn't leave him, he thought, the smell of sweat-soaked leather from his boots and the holster from his gun.  Sleep was no more restorative.
Was it a coincidence? Could the doctor evoke an encounter other than their own through these words that portrayed the musician?  Sherlock felt his heartbeat accelerate even faster. He had not invented the gentleness of this doctor, his brilliant look, his questioning smile, his poorly concealed worry.  Nor had he invented this which, irrepressibly, had been tapping him since that first moment.   He needed to know for sure. He closed the lid of his computer, got up from his bed and left his room. The apartment was dark. Apparently, Molly had gone down to do some shopping. Sherlock headed for the entrance and found his high-collar Belstaff hanging from the coat rack, protecting him from looks when he was on the street. What Sherlock was looking for was, in the pocket of his coat still wet from the rain, the little piece of paper that Sally had slipped into his just before he left the hospital and on which she had collected the doctor's phone number.
Amazed, John had looked at this stranger who was so fragile and at the same time arrogant and brilliant that he had deduced almost everything from his life in one glance.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
"No way," replied Sherlock..." Don't you understand? You don't understand that I need it," he said in a less confident voice. "I... I have to... I have to..." His voice stopped... And as Greg was now very close to him, the musician, with a quick gesture, grabbed the pills nestled in his pocket and swallowed them, looking his agent in the eyes. "I promise you, it's the last time... It's... It's... It's for tonight, you understand... I have to be in good shape, you know, it was Magnussen who said it," he added with a kind of laugh back. »
With a moan of impotence, Sherlock stood up suddenly. He was dying to take a cigarette, a pill, anything to get through the anxiety and guilt that was crackling in him. He checked his cell phone again to see if Sally, as she had promised him the night before, had sent him any news of Greg. But the screen remained inexorably blank of any notifications.  At the height of his frustration, he headed for his bathroom. At the end of his nerves, he slipped the dressing gown off his shoulders. The reflection of his naked body in the mirror struck him painfully. He found himself ugly, damaged. He was scary. In fact, that's what Greg told him backstage at the Palladium; he knew it was to make him react. His agent was not wrong. He had to admit it. Months of chaotic sleep, skipped meals, pills swallowed wrongly and through had dug his features, his chest, his stomach, had slimmed his shoulders and thighs. Almost in spite of himself, he put his hand over his throat and then through his brown hair.
brought you your scarf. You know, the blue one, the one you like..." He left his words hanging, hoping that the young man would turn around and catch him. But Sherlock, without answering, kept his back
"Greg," began the guitarist, in an exasperated voice, "it's no longer possible... we should have started forty minutes ago. Do you hear them? They'll break everything if he..."
"Now it's your turn, William, okay? »
In an uncontrollable wave, the events of the last two days came back to hit him hard. Tim's words begging him for a picture, Moriarty's sarcasm during rehearsals, the concert fiasco cancelled at the last minute, Greg's surprised eyes looking at him without understanding as he plunged into the void, his bloody temple violently lit by the scyalitic. But beyond all the images that came spinning inside him without him being able to block it, it was the feeling of the doctor's hand on his wrist and the warmth of his smile that he still perceived in him. Greg's fall, his injuries had taken precedence over everything else while he was in the ambulance with him. Waves of panic and guilt were shielding his own discomfort. He was not aware of his shattered breath, made laborious by the pills he had swallowed all day before the concert to help him hold on, nor of the dark circles that highlighted the exhaustion of his face, nor even the intense shaking that was shaking his hands.
He rolled his eyes as if he'd just remembered. "Oh! Lestrade texted back earlier. Not the same man."
"And now I am. The ends justify the means, John. You only needed that little extra incentive." He flips his phone in the air, catches it, and slides it into the front pocket of his trousers.
John bent forward again to kiss Sherlock and run his hands over his shoulders, his chest, his abdomen, stroking and squeezing firmly. He followed with his mouth, pausing to give special attention to Sherlock's neck, his nipples, a spot that was apparently particularly sweet along his ribs, until without further preamble he encased Sherlock's stiff member in sudden heat. He withdrew to gather saliva, then sank down again, working the moisture around with his tongue until the condom was thoroughly slick and the slide in and out of his mouth was smooth. Then he nudged Sherlock's legs further apart and settled down between them, his left hand playing with Sherlock's balls and his right steadying the base of his cock while he sucked and licked.
Tristram isn't particularly enamoured of the taste - it's not awful, but it has a slightly bitter undertone to it that Doctor Watson says is from the kirsch, some kind of alcoholic drink, that's mixed in with the cheese. He assures Tristram and Emily that the temperature is high enough that all the actual alcohol's evaporated, leaving only the flavour behind. Tristram wishes the flavour had evaporated as well. Doctor Watson seems to like it though, enough that he orders some kirsch separately for Father and him to drink. It comes in tiny little doll-sized glasses that Emily coos over and Tristram thinks look frankly silly, but Father gamely picks his up and clinks it against Doctor Watson's, and after they each take a sip, they look at each other for a moment and break into giggles over nothing. Tristram grins too and decides the glasses' silliness is worth it.
"Oh, the bait's doing just what you want, I expect." Sherlock turned and went toward the door. "The question is whether you're going to be disappointed with your catch," he said over his shoulder.
When Father returns, a short, moustached man is following him with a trolley. Father says something to the man in another language, gesturing at their luggage.
When Sherlock's taxi pulled up outside the cathedral ruins the following afternoon, he felt uncertain. He disliked being uncertain. Irritatingly, it seemed he was never anything but uncertain when it came to John. And yet he hadn't given up the experiment, hadn't given
John beamed. "That was excellent." He turned to Sherlock. "Wasn't that excellent, Mr Holmes?"
Tristram's not sure whether by 'exciting' she means the fun things like going up and down mountains, or all the other things like running away from bad guys and getting shot. He could certainly do without the latter, and as for the former... he's not sure he can picture Irene on a toboggan or rolling in the snow. Although, to be fair, he couldn't have pictured his father doing those things before their trip either. He imagines her house (well, Kate's house) will be more like Emily's aunts' house than his and Father's flat. And he does have fun when he goes to the Watsons'. Although, mostly, that's because Emily's there.
Time: 15:55
"No, he will not," Sherlock said shortly.
John held the bag out for him to take a chestnut.
He approached Greg who was shivering and had closed his eyes.
Everything mixed in him in a crazy waltz.  Tim's eyes, filled with that crazy devotion that almost scared him... the inspiration that was desperately escaping him... the sales that kept falling... the pills he was taking to feel better... that song, Mine, that put him in a state of intolerable vulnerability every time... Greg, finally, so concerned and yet, he had knowingly hurt his relationship with Mycroft by his inappropriate allusions. Sherlock refused to think more about his brother and Greg. Too much guilt...
"... Still what? Pull the strings? Manipulated each other?  Fomented his power struggles to keep his label alive in the record company jungle? Gave all the attention, all the energy, I'm talking about sex of course, of which he was capable to a certain..."
A week had passed since the crazy evening at the Baths and the tension had only increased as he approached the concert he was to give at the Palladium, a venue he knew by heart and loved especially in ordinary times. But he knew today that, given his inner state, he was in no condition to do so, even if he had to give this concert that very evening. When Molly had gently shaken his shoulder, to give him the signal to leave, he would have done anything not to go. The rehearsal the day before had been a nightmare. Nothing was fine. He had demanded a change of orchestration on Le Lac, the title that opened the concert. He also had to review the sequence on the word mine that linked the sixth and seventh songs. He kept stumbling over the word that he couldn't place correctly.
His hand was throwing it. When, the day before, he had punched the mirror in his bathroom with his fist, the force of the blow had lacerated the skin. And earlier the boiling water from the teapot had not helped. The last hour had been terrible. Moran's half-veiled threats, the pressure he felt on others, and above all the immense feeling of guilt he felt towards Greg, who, much more than his agent, had become over the past few years the one who kept him on his own and allowed him, by protecting him from external attacks, to make him express his talent and creativity, had finished undermining his last defenses. While the apartment was filled with the rustling of each other's conversations and Moran's obnoxious words were being heard, he felt an irrepressible need to flee, to withdraw into himself, to seek a moment of peace that he knew, even if it was artificial and temporary, would at least save him some time. He pushed back without saying a word Molly, the only one who hadn't left the apartment, and locked himself in his room. He threw himself on his bed, his temples beating, a vague nausea on the edge of his lips, while he still felt Moran's breath in his ear and the word "obey" resounded in him. It was only after he had swallowed the two pills lying on his bedside that he felt the vice compressing his forehead loosening. The desire to vomit nevertheless remained at the bottom of his throat, increased by the pungent taste of the pills supposed to reduce the anxiety that crackled in him in incoercible waves.
The pain in his hand kept him from sinking. He remembered very well why the anger he felt towards himself had pushed him to smash the mirror a few hours earlier. He had tried to get rid of the image that was pursuing him, that of this doctor, whose indecipherable blue eyes that carried as much determination as sweetness in them, came back again and again to the forefront, as if it prevented him from thinking, as if it prevented him from being himself.
"Didn't you hear that, Sherlock? When you say yours... I want you to think about Victor. »
"Are you cold, Mr. Lestrade? It's normal, it's the shock; it'll get better in a few minutes. Wait, I'll fix it. "He waved at the nurse who covered the wounded with a light blanket. "This is what we're going to do now.  I'll give you a mild sedative to help you relax and I'll suture your wound, while Julia and Kathy cast your ankle, okay? ».
But today, in the silence of his room, as the heavy sleep of the sedative he had been given the day before in Barts hardly left him, his fingers had wrapped themselves around his erect sex and gave him increasingly rapid movements that tore off a moaning made of pleasure and discomfort mixed. His eyes then opened and he became more clearly aware of the heat radiating between his widely open thighs. The blurred image of a face he didn't recognize was floating inside him and accentuated the desire to push his hips up, while his hand came and went all the way back and forth and dwelt in the most sensitive and already wet spot.  The sound of his panting breath finished waking him up completely. With a sudden grin of displeasure against himself, Sherlock stopped completely and forced himself to inhale deeply.
As a result of the blow, Sherlock felt shaky and barely made up for it at the edge of the sink.
"Leave me alone, let me go," he shouted as he struggled under Tom and Fred's merciless grip.
Mechanically rubbing his hand whose lacerated skin was throwing it, Sherlock suddenly opened the lid of his computer. He locked himself in his room, away from Molly's worried eyes, and lay on his bed, after taking the two pills he absolutely needed to let the odious scene with Moran pass. He already felt the effects of the pills. He knew he shouldn't have taken them, he knew he was playing with fire, but these pills had become more than indispensable to him. The musician pushed the unpleasant idea of any kind of dependence very far back into him and slipped halfway under the down. He was always either too hot or too cold when he took them and he already felt the chills grabbing him.  Sherlock then brought his dressing gown as close as possible to him and, leaning against two pillows, the computer resting on his half-bent legs, he logged on to his own twitter account. He used to distribute tweets at more or less irregular intervals, whose humour delighted his fans.  His favorite hashtag #ohwhatawonderfulworld scratched with an often cruel verve the banalities, sterile polemics and hypocrisies that circulated in the music world.
"As if you could do that! Even for you, the impossible exists, you know..." And there was so much uncertainty in his voice that Sherlock came closer and blew in his ear:
... take care of yourself, William....
"Yes, Chris, it's okay, it's nothing, just a little bit tired," he whispered in a voice he wanted to keep light
"I'll leave you," Greg ends without answering directly, his voice tired, opening the door to get out.  "Since you don't seem to care much about our..." He stopped and then took over "... of all the interest I have in you, I leave you with dear Moriarty for the spinning. One last thing... I'll meet you in your dressing room half an hour before the curtain rises... Please try to eat and sleep for twenty minutes. Look at you. Look at you. You're scary as hell." He closed the door behind him, without slamming it. Sherlock then slowly raised his face towards the mirror. The reflection returned terrified him. Searching his pocket with a shaky hand, he took out an extra pill and swallowed it immediately. Anyway, it no longer had any effect on him. And he needed this to go rehearse Mine with Moriarty.
But in the end, it was a certain form of glare that dominated John, despite - or because of - the arrogance and acuity of the character. And although he absolutely did not want to admit it to himself, the singular beauty of the young man had struck him and his face with angular features still pursued him tenaciously in thought, while his sight was blurred by the gusts that shook the park trees and the wind blew sand on the deserted alleys in that early winter morning, bringing back memories of other dawns and other faces.
"Nigel, the doorman at the artists' entrance, was asked if he had left? »
But while John, once his guard was finished, crossed the misty park at dawn, which brought him back to his apartment, he could not stop his mind from constantly returning to this man who - he had not yet understood how - had deduced from a sharp look his nightmare nights and family alcoholism. He was not sure whether anger should prevail over worry and surprise. William's condition - no, Sherlock, since the young man had corrected the information on his own - was of concern to him, of course. He had left alone, obviously very shocked by his friend's accident and under the influence of certain dangerous products. John had detected, when he examined him, old but very recognizable traces of injections. He was in trouble, it was obvious. The doctor could still hear, amplified by his stethoscope, Sherlock's heartbeat and panicky breathing, which he had only managed to calm by asking him to follow his own rhythm.
"Liam, we find Ed fast and we throw him in the first part. He's ready backstage. You put Projo 1 on him. That'll give us 30 minutes to find..."
"Can you explain it to me, Sherlock? What was your number on the set during the snitch? And since we're going to talk about things that are annoying, why do you have to touch your jeans pocket like that? What do you have inside? You think I didn't see your eyes... your hands... Greg asked, very coldly.
"No, don't touch; we'll give you something for the pain. It's going to be okay. You don't have anything too serious. How are you feeling?  Do you know where you are?  Look at me. Can you tell me your first name?" And when his patient didn't answer, John insisted.  "Tell me your name. "He bent down to grasp the murmur that was leaking from the lips of the wounded man.
"Sally, I may have an idea where he might be. “
The two men had arrived on Baker Street. Sherlock had immediately locked himself in the bathroom. He came out ten minutes later, metamorphosed, a towel barely draped around his hips, fully inflated; he rushed through a pair of black jeans and a plum-fitted shirt; made a vague gesture with his hand towards Greg who was looking at him, stunned, he left the apartment in a hurry and asked Tom, one of his bodyguards to follow him to the Baths, a box where he regularly went. He was only seen again the next morning at seven o'clock, exhausted again. And alone. Photos stolen by fans from the box and published on Instagram had shown him, during the night, with a wild look, his black loops loose, a false laugh mechanically stuck on his face.
The last few days had been a nightmare. Even though he had signed a contract in Los Angeles with a promising artist for his label, Strad Records, what happened in London at the Palladium had finished cracking the bastion he was trying to build around his brother, to protect him from the outside world and especially from himself. The flight from the west coast of the United States to England was several hours late; he missed the connection in New York; the wifi connection on board the plane was non-existent. It was only by landing in Heathrow that he was able to reach his assistant, Anthea, who had stayed in London.  Sherlock, invisible, was hiding on Baker Street. Greg was safe, but seriously injured. Sally had managed to get him out of the hospital fairly quickly and had repatriated him to her apartment in Camden, under her promise to a certain Dr. Watson to watch him and keep him warm and calm for a week.
Bonus points if you got that the case was an allusion to the original Conan Doyle story, "The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle"... And as always thanks for reading, kudos-ing and commenting! <3
“But it’s wonderful. I love it, of course I do,” John assured him. “And the important thing is I’m here with you.” He smiled and Sherlock smiled back.
John knew his feelings for Sherlock were there, and after the last few difficult, grief-filled years after losing Mary, he wanted bring love back into his life. He felt sick with nerves just thinking about it, but he made a promise to himself to tell Sherlock how he felt, when the time was right.
“Daddy, are you alright because we have to go!” Rosie cried.
Then, however, Sherlock hung up his phone and turned to look at John. They’re faces were so close. John was staring right up into his vibrant blue eyes, getting lost in them. He glanced at Sherlock’s mouth, at the perfect cupid’s bow of his lips, just inches away, and the urge to lean slightly forward and kiss it was almost too much. There was no stopping this, but John knew he at least had to try to hold it in.
“No he’s no my…” John trailed off as the bartender went to get their drinks, seeming not to have heard him. John sat down at the bar, not looking at Sherlock. “Mind telling me how you knew I was coming here tonight and why you decided it was a good idea to be here too when I was on a date?” John asked, annoyed that Sherlock was meddling in his private life.
“Oh, yes sweetheart, Daddy’s fine, just thinking about some things he has to do after he drops you off at school, but you’re right let’s go.” As they headed out the door, John’s mind ran through possible gift ideas and threw out each one in turn; Sherlock was not an easy man to shop for. His only hope was that Sherlock had forgotten what day it was too and, knowing Sherlock’s track record with basic life trivia, it was a possibility. Just as he was getting in the car, John’s phone buzzed. He looked at it and his hopes flew out the window.
“Well she showed up late, which wasn’t a great start and she didn’t apologize either, just gave the old ‘hope I didn’t keep you waiting’ but when you’re fifteen minutes late of course you kept me waiting,” John said, the frustration from the date quickly returning.
“I just want this relationship to be ours, just ours for a little bit before we have to share it with everyone. I want us to figure out us, before we have to explain it to all our friends, you know?”
John wanted to be really mad about the blatant invasion of privacy, but he found he felt somewhat touched by the fact that Sherlock and remember his and Mary’s special day. His friend knew him well. And just thinking about Mary calmed him down too; she had always been willing to give Sherlock a chance, even when he was being particularly impossible.
Rosie is turning six and John and Sherlock throw her a party...
John and Sherlock met for a walk in the park a couple of days later, it had been John’s idea and Sherlock got the sense there was something specific they were there to discuss. He hoped John hadn’t had any second thoughts about how quickly their relationship was progressing, when they’d made love for the first time it had felt so right and Sherlock had thought John felt the same way. But as the conversation began, Sherlock realized this wasn’t what was on John’s mind at all.
“Please,” John said enthusiastically. “And I’m not complaining, it’s just funny, that’s all,” he added.
“This is a pretty nice place,” John commented gazing around the black-tie-only-type restaurant and down at the rather pricey list of menu items.
“Thank you. So after she told me I was disappointingly short, I tried to sort of laugh it off. Figured maybe she was nervous and just trying to be funny and it came out wrong, but she didn’t seem to treat it as a joke at all. And she followed it up by asking how old I was because she was 44 and not interested in dating an older man. And then when I told her I the same age she responded with ‘Really? well that’s good’ like she’d been thinking I was older,” John paused to take a breath, he was really getting riled up. “You want to say something smart about that?” he snapped at Sherlock.
“I am not. I’m the doctor here, not you, me so I will make the diagnostics and I say I am not drunk at all, I’m just having a fun night. Enjoying me-self, myself, is that so wrong?” John stumbled through this declaration of his relative sobriety and Sherlock giggled. It could’ve been annoying but John was not in the habit of overdoing it with the alcohol, the last time Sherlock had seen him this drunk was probably his stag party, so he found the display tonight to be rather cute and endearing.
“John is something wrong?” Sherlock asked, turning to face John, as the cab drove away.
“I’m human John, of course I get hungry,” Sherlock replied with his usual slightly exasperated tone.
“Like what?”
“Alright calm down, we can solve this,” Sherlock said, taking John’s hand to get him to hold still. Just then, Rosie burst into the room.
“Yes, but Sherlock that’s not a funny joke, ok no encouraging the children to eat the slime. This party is not a space for experiments in child psychology, do you understand me?!” John yelled, following him into the house.
“We never got one! After I cancelled the castle cake order we never got a new cake, oh my God Sherlock, there are a dozen six year olds about to arrive at our home and we have no cake.” John started pacing back and forth nervously.
“John?”
“I want to stay and see Sherlock,” Rosie objected.
“It’s stupid, I know, but I didn’t know what to get you and I was at the chocolate shop and I saw that and well…”
“You know him actually,” Molly continued, not noticing how distracted Sherlock had become.
“Riley, Lucas Riley Stevens, but why does that matter?”
“Or is that how you feel about me, John, not your daughter, but you?” Sherlock spit this question at him bitterly. And of course it is what he thinks, said a cruel little voice in Sherlock’s head. Who could ever love someone like him?
“Daddy, hurry up, I’m going to be late!” Rosie whined loudly.
“Alright doctor, but this is the last one because I’m tired and I want to head home,” Sherlock argued. “Here, in fact, let me help you finish that.” He took a drink from John’s glass.
“Can you do that?” Sherlock asked. “Can you just copy someone’s party idea? Isn’t that against the parent code or something?”
“Of course not a problem,” Sherlock replied.
Lestrade ran off out of the alley, after the thief. Sherlock, still holding John firmly, lowered the two of them to a sitting position.
Also don't hate me for the inaccuracies that I'm sure exist in me rendering of this situation...
***************
"And was there any sign of someone breaking into your son’s room?” Sherlock asked, without looking up from his phone which he had been looking at through most of their client’s explanation of her missing son, Lucas. The detective’s tone when he spoke was was cool and matter of fact. John felt a bit annoyed by his nonchalant attitude toward the case at hand, did he not care that a sixteen-year-old boy was missing?
However the piece of the case that was grabbing John’s attention at the moment was the fact that the victim was a woman with shoulder-length, curly, blonde hair and she was laying there, dead, with a bullet hole in her chest. She didn’t look remarkably similar to Mary, she was several years younger than Mary had been for one thing, but it was still a similar enough scene that it brought painful flashbacks for John. Even after years had passed, the wound that losing Mary had left on his heart was still raw. He knew he should’ve been able to face this sight calmly, to be reminded of her without feeling like he was about to fall apart completely right there at the scene of a murder, but he couldn’t seen to tamp down the emotions and tears that were rising within him. He tried to breathe evenly and settle himself but he knew it was no use and he couldn’t start crying here in front of everyone. He had to get out, go home where he could ride out the tide of fresh grief in private.
“Pretty much, yeah,” John said, then he added jokingly, “But you know, it was kind of a nice threat when you think about it, shows he cares about you, doesn’t want you to get hurt.” John expected Sherlock to laugh at this but he didn't.
John felt this was all a bit much but Sherlock had whipped out his phone with his free hand before there was time to protest. As he sat there while Sherlock spoke to the operator on the other end, John contemplated his current swell of feelings. He thought about how much he was enjoying having Sherlock take care of him and how he was getting an odd rush from sitting so close to his friend, but he didn’t want to think too hard about what this all meant. He’d been having such strange emotions around Sherlock lately. He thought he recognized the almost electric feeling, but he couldn’t bring himself to admit that it was attraction. This had to stop.
“Excellent choice, sir. I’ll have that right up.”
“Thank you Molly, we appreciate that,” said Sherlock.
“They’ll be here in a minute,” Sherlock said calmly.
John looked up at his friend and was struck by another realization: he wasn’t alone. He was here with Sherlock, the man he was falling in love with. If all went well tonight, John was going to be headed down a very different path from the old widower because although he had lost his first true love, he felt sure he had found another. John realized he was, really, very far from alone in this life because he had been lucky enough to be given two wonderful romances, two people to share his life with.
“Dr. Watson, this is Ms Jones.” The young woman seemed more embarrassed by the whole situation, than annoyed. “I’m sorry to be bothering you-”
“Let’s see if you can guess,” Sherlock replied mischievously as he started to put the dishes back in the cupboards. “Did it remind you of something?”
John smiled and glanced sideways at Sherlock sitting next to him. “Are you setting us up for sand sculpting disappointment?”
Sherlock, who had been kneeling, inspecting the dead woman’s body for clues, stood up and watched John walk away. He had a thoughtful look on his face as though he was still thinking about the case, or perhaps he was solving another puzzle, but his deduction skills were clearly hard at work.
“Thank you,” Rosie told the sales girl.
“Thank you, John, I’ll see you in an hour or so,” Sherlock signed off and hung up. In his car, John gave a long, exhausted sigh.
“Or at least it is what it is,” Sherlock replied ruefully.
“Thank you so much,” John said, grateful and relieved. “I’ll come by Baker Street and get her as soon as I can.”
“You boys need another round?” the bartender cut in suddenly. “Night’s going better now, uh?” he added with a wink to John.
“Oh!... It’s fine. It um… yeah it’s fine,” John stammered. He was taken off guard by the quick change in conversation topic. He would’ve liked to know a bit more about why Mycroft was offering Sherlock romantic advice, but he was a bit pleased to hear the detective was still concerned about the cut John had sustained on a recent case.
“But it isn’t, if you love each other, you should be together, so tell him to come back,” Rosie pleaded, breaking their embrace.
John blushed furiously and turned his attentions to his drink, hoping he could pass off his reddened complexion as an effect of the alcohol. He knew he had every right to be pissed at Sherlock and any sane person probably would be pretty upset at this point. But that was not what he felt. He felt flattered that Sherlock was calling the two of them special and similar, putting both of them in the same, above average category. He knew Sherlock hated average people and it felt good to be considered on the detective's level, better than the boring, everyday masses. He also felt… distracted, perhaps, by the sly smile his friend had just flashed him when he made this last comment about John not being ‘most people’ either. He felt the need to not look at his friend but instead have another swallow of his beer because that almost mischievous smile was preventing him from thinking clearly. He realized it was the same flustered feeling from the other day when Sherlock had called him smart.
“Rosie, don’t run!” John called, but when she didn’t listen, he simply let her go. He was glad to see her so happy and carefree. He had felt lately that Rosie seemed more grown up than most children her age and it made him smile to see his daughter acting with the glee of any other six year old.
“Romance mainly,” Sherlock said blandly. Then he looked up at John. “I forgot to ask earlier, how is your shoulder doing?”
“Thanks,” John replied, surprised but pleased. He was also pleased that once he was able to come up with a response to his friend's compliments “I did try to look nice for tonight so I’m glad someone appreciated the effort, even if it wasn’t the person I intended,” he added with a playful, joking smile at his friend.
“You are my gift. You being here, that’s all I need,” Sherlock replied
The silence that followed was a nervous one still but there was a sense of solidarity now. Time passed and Molly leaned over onto Mike’s lap and began to drift off to sleep.
Was he feeling light-headed? Yes, but not for the expected reason. “No, no, I’m fine, I just… Had a moment… Maybe it’s good you called for help,” John mumbled. Although, he knew no doctor could solve his real problem.
They cleaned in silence for a moment then Sherlock asked, “Is that why you were so worried about this party? Because you’re on your own with Rosie and you feel like you have something to prove, not just to her but to the rest of the world?”
John pushed the man aside and entered the box where the insistent sound of a heart monitor, beeping regularly, greeted him. At a quick glance, he integrated all the details: a young brown woman, standing next to the patient, asking the nurses for information; the man lying on the examination table, eyes half-closed, a safety collar already placed around his neck, a wound open on his temple; in a corner of the box, two tall guys overlooked another man, sitting on the floor, head between his knees. John could only see an angular silhouette and a mass of brown curls, but he immediately felt the labored breathing and the shaky hands.
As the words were writing on their own, John knew immediately that they were not addressing this young soldier, whom he had intended to mention. While, uncomfortable, he reread the words, he could not help but see, in an almost shocking clarity, Sherlock's long silhouette disappear and flee into the night. He felt a sudden heat spreading first on his face, while a fleeting wave, of which he did not know exactly what it was made of, was born deep inside his belly. He closed the keyboard of his computer dryly, while he felt his hands shaking slightly. Sherlock's face continued to float in him, his bright eyes piercing him, reading everything he was with extreme ease.
But for a few months, after what had happened with Victor, he felt that he was broken, that the mechanics were broken. Getting out of bed, when he managed to sleep, was sometimes impossible. And when he was finally up, he was so tired, he felt so empty that he absolutely needed something to find some energy. His medical staff provided him with everything he needed, with a complacency that he himself - he was not fooled for a moment - considered indecent, but in the end it was convenient for everyone to close their eyes more or less to the pills he swallowed at every turn.
In the taxi taking him to Camden, Mycroft Holmes closed his phone with a dry gesture and slipped it into the inside pocket of his jacket.  He knew he wouldn't get an answer anyway. He didn't expect it. The explanation would come later, as would the decisions that would have to be made.  There would be a price to pay for all this.  We didn't just sweep away Charles Augustus Magnussen's plans and will. The humiliation Sherlock had caused him, the debacle at the Palladium, would be punished. It was only a matter of time and imagination. Mycroft was convinced of it.
“I suppose it was just too close to home. I know-,” Sherlock’s voice broke and he let out a shaky breath. “I know what it feels like to be in Lucas’s shoes. When I was 19 I came out to my parents as gay and they-,” he paused again and collected himself once more.
“Did you start this?” John snapped, “Because I had a whole party planned and it’s got to get completely re-planned in less than 48 hours now.”
“Alright, but first, I’m going to say this thing, all of it, and you can’t interrupt ok? And when I’m done you don’t have to respond, in fact just don’t respond ok? Just let me and Rosie go home and you can think about it and let me know what you think later when you’ve had a chance to really mull it over, ok?” John spouted all these caveats out quite quickly. Now that he was talking his nervousness was making him want to say everything that was on his mind.
“Oh I know, you’re going on a date with my little brother,” Mycroft said, not hiding his enjoyment at John’s shock.
I had such fun writing this one, hope you enjoyed it! More to come and as always thanks for reading, commenting, etc!
“Sherlock was teaching me how to do deduction stuff,” Rosie proclaimed excitedly to her father, as she ran into the room.
“Excellent, to bed then, I think,” Sherlock lead John to his room on the first floor, John’s old room, the guest room was out as stairs weren’t really an option at this point.
“Well that might be a bit of a problem,” Ms Jones said, her sweet tone and smile, not matching her words. “You see only family members and those authorized by family members are allowed to take the children home from school, for safety reasons, you understand, and I’m afraid you are neither of those things,” she explained apologetically.

“Yes. That’s impressive that you remembered that.”
“Well, you only have two shoulders John, even if I did have to guess, which of course I didn’t, I’d have a pretty good chance of getting it right,” Sherlock replied breezily.
“But that that’s what you were going to do,” John said evenly. “Most people would be bothered by that, you realize.”
Chris' voice reached him with difficulty through the rustle of his own heartbeat.  For a very short time, he had no longer been in that white room, but in that hot barrack where he had found refuge with Sholto and Fayaz, between two bombings. But he recovered very quickly and straightened up,  a smile on his lips.
"Stop it, Sherlock, you know very well that Mycroft has always..." Greg replied, looking furious.  But Sherlock cut
