"Oh, Tony." He closes his eyes for a moment.
Pepper only smiles at him gently,
“Thank you.” He says.
“Tony left a message for you. It’s for your eyes only.” Pepper says, holding the mask for a second longer before holding it out for Steve. He takes it, only because he doesn’t know what else to do.
They place Tony’s first arc reactor on the wreath and pushes it out into the lake. Everyone who has their lives touched by Tony is there. There’s even some kid named Harley that Steve has never seen before. There are many parts of Tony’s life that he hasn’t known about, and he will never get a chance to know them.
“I forgive you. God knows I’ve forgiven you the minute you left. But when I saw you again, Steve you have to understand that I couldn’t go through that pain again. I didn’t want to, and I can’t.”
, he thinks distractedly as he looks at the wreath go. There’s no body for them to cremate or bury. Clint had said that he had passed out after Natasha had let go of his hand, whether it was from shock or from the power of the soul stone, he didn’t know. Once he came to, he was lying in a shallow lake with the soul stone grasped in his hand. Natasha wouldn’t have wanted a funeral anyway.
Steve thinks. It isn’t just Tony they had lost. Natasha’s absence is a gaping wound that Steve doesn’t know how to deal with. He doesn’t know if he ever will. She was the first friend he made in this time, and had stood by him through it all.
Silence falls between them, and Tony hold his slumped over pose for so long that Steve thought the recording ended.
The grief hits in a huge wave, and the tears start to fall.
The light flairs up around him, and Steve’s ready this time.
, he thinks to himself.
"I bet you're sorry." Tony smiled tiredly. "I'm sorry too, for what it's worth. Although I don't think my word means much to you now. I do wish we could have done things differently, but my point still stands. I needed you, but you weren't there. Well, I guess you needed me too, and I wasn't there for you."
Numb as the light on the armor faded out.
Steve doesn’t stay after that.
"Hey, Steve." Tony's image flickers for a moment before stabilizing. "If you see this, it means I'm dead. Well, if I'm not, stop this message at once. Don't go poking around my stuff, you bad boy." He wags a finger and smirks.
, he thinks,
“Don’t do anything stupid until I get back.” He tells Bucky.
He spares a thought for Tony’s bots.
"But it's always been you, Steve Grant Rogers." Tony chuckles exhaustedly. "Always you. I love you." He closes his eyes as if it pains him to say that out loud. "I wish I didn't, and heaven knows I've tried to stop loving you, Steve, but I can't. I love you so much sometimes it hurts to even hear your name. I've often wondered if I'd die from loving you instead of going down in battle."
It can’t be….
Oh, so he is. Isn't that weird? Steve hasn't known that you can cry without feeling sad.
A hologram is projected by the helmet, and suddenly there is an image of Tony Stark sitting in front of him. Steve closes his eyes, before immediately opening them again. He doesn't know whether this is a one-time message or not, and if it was, he wants to sear every moment of it into his memory.
he thinks.
The serious tone in Bucky’s voice stops Steve from arguing. Maybe… Maybe he could let himself believe that he deserves it.
There’s somewhere he has to be.
The kid is crying. The kid that Tony thought he had lost and had gotten back only for a few moments. Pepper is crying. Rhodes is crying. They deserve to cry; they love Tony and Tony loved them back. Steve doesn't think he deserves that privilege, but he's crying anyway.
Steve hesitates. He isn't sure what the password is. Rhodes and Pepper may know it, but given the way they are clinging onto each other for dear life, Steve doesn't want to break the moment. He glances at the spider-kid, but he seems just as lost as Steve is.
and the case that contains the Infinity Stones.
“Steve.” She calls again, and he looks around. There’s no one but him left looking out on the lake. Is the ceremony over? How long has he been spacing out for? “I have something for you.“
"I should go find Laura and the children," Clint mutters, and Steve nods silently. At least one of them still has a family. It isn't jealousy he feels, nor is it envy. He just doesn’t feel anything at all.
Dum-ee and U are never going to know what happened to their creator. Steve doesn’t even know whether they survived the snap. He supposes they did, they aren’t technically living creatures.
Part of him wants to ask the kid to move. He’s too young for this, too young to witness the brutality and inhumanity of war and too young to carry the body of a man he loves. But this is the same kid that fought on the battlefield and went up in space with Tony. He was there for Tony when Steve wasn’t. Steve doesn’t have the right to ask him to step aside. Beside, manhood waits for no one.
he thinks. That would be fitting though, the legacy of Iron Man dying with Tony Stark.
He's been called a Man Out of Time, and he's accepted the mantel. Maybe it's time for him to live up to it.
Someone he has to find.
It’s a selfish thing, but Steve thinks after everything, he’s allowed to be selfish. Just this once. The universe owes him this after taking everything he loves away from him.
"Let me." He nods to Rhodes, and the man stares at him. Steve doesn't know what kind of expression he has on now, but it's enough for Rhodes to nod back solemnly and crouch down next to Pepper, drawing her away from the body gently. The kid stares at him defiantly,
The procession through the battlefield is quiet. Someone must have spread the word because by the time Steve turns with Tony's body in his arms, everyone has lined up. He steps on ash and tries his best not to think about a time a few years ago when a similar situation had happened. The cold weight in his arms doesn't do anything for his thoughts, and so Steve keeps his eyes ahead of him. The quiet support of the remaining Avengers behind him gives him the strength to carry on.
Steve hears it alright. He hears Tony saying it to him, but Tony will never get to hear Steve say it back to him. And that's what breaks his heart.
Steve shuts his eyes. Even when they were back together before the Accords incident happened, they had never said ‘I love you' to each other. And oh, how much does Steve regret it now.
“I’m sorry,” Steve tells the recording.
Steve thinks
“I’m ready.” He tells Bruce.
It's only in the safety of his own room does he then dare to examine the helmet. He's staying in a hotel room for the night. There's nowhere else for him to go. The compound has been destroyed, and well, Clint has offered to put him up for the night, but Steve couldn't do that to him. Not when the archer had finally been reunited with his family. Thor has gone back to New Asgard, something that he has to do before he leaves with the Guardians, he says. He has no idea where Bruce has disappeared to, but presumably, it's to work on the time machine to bring the Infinity stones back. Bucky has gone with Sam, who has also offered him a place to stay, but Steve had declined. He just wants to be by himself.
"Password required," Friday's familiar voice drifts out from the armor. He may be projecting, but the AI's voice carries heartbreak and pain in it.
“Oh Tony,” he mutters.
“Steve.” Thor’s hand on his shoulder steadies him.
"Cap." The low rumble of Thor's voice draws him out of his stupor. Steve looks at the god and belatedly realizes that his cheeks are wet. Is it raining? He looks around the field in confusion. Everything else is dry.
Steve had never wanted so badly to
be proven wrong.
Numb.
He pulls away and smiles, before stepping up to the time machine. He picks up Mjolnir,
she would have said.
Before the ceremony, Tony's family turns to go inside the house. He must have left them a message; that seems like something Tony would do. Steve turns away from the house. He might have been Tony's family once, but that life doesn't include him anymore. Not since the argument over the accords happened.
They have to carry the body.
Steve understands. He does, and that’s why he had stood there five years ago and let Tony lash out at him. Tony needed to get it out of his system, and Steve needed to hear it.
Can it?
But the point still stands. Steve had stood frozen, numb as he watched Tony collapsed. Numb as Thanos and his army faded away. Numb as he watched Pepper and Peter and everyone who loved Tony gathered around the dying man.
“But I think we can both agree that there’s blame to share. Pepper says that communication is the key to a strong relationship, but you know us, Cap,” Tony laughed bitterly. “We were never good at that, were we?”
“You’re crying.”
“Nononono. No-“ Steve chokes out. He isn’t ready for this.
Steve hasn’t thought that the date of his birthday would still be the password. It isn’t the most secure password but say what you want about Tony Stark, he does have a heart.
he thinks.
"Want to help me, kid?" He asked. The kid sniffles and wipes his tears away with a dirty hand before nodding resolutely, "Yeah."
He doesn’t.
Steve drinks in the smirk like a thirsty man.
He's confused but goes silently. Pepper leads him into the house, and on the table lays a familiar Iron Man's helmet. There are two of them. Steve gulps. Pepper takes one in her hands tenderly and runs a thumb over the smooth surface. He feels as if he's intruding on an intimate moment and looks away. Steve still doesn't know why he's been called in.
Later on, Steve has no idea how he ends up sitting in the remains of the HQ with an IV drip attached to his arm. All he’s aware is that for one moment, Tony’s body had been in his arm and then it’s gone the next. They had taken the body away to prepare for the funeral.
he amends mentally but being in denial isn’t going to help anyone. He takes a step towards the corpse, and instantly Pepper draws it closer to her. Steve falters. He doesn’t want to take this moment away from her, not when almost everything she has is already gone. But they have to.
He had screamed at his body to move, to do something. Anything. If the Hulk could barely handle the power of the Infinity Stones, what chance did a mere human have?
“Feel free to stay as long as you want. Take your time.” She says, before going up the stairs. To Morgan. To Tony’s daughter who’s going to have to grow up without the best dad in the entire universe.
Steve just hasn’t thought it still belonged to him.
There’s nothing else for Steve in this time. Both Tony and Natasha are gone.
"Are you sure you don't want anyone to come with you?" Bruce asks as he powers up the time machine. Steve suits up and smiles reassuringly. "It's alright, I have to be the one to do this."
“No, never.” Steve shakes his head, even though he knows that there’s no one else to see him.
“How can I? You’re taking all the stupid with you.” Bucky replies and draws him into a hug. “Go get him, Stevie. Get the happy ending you deserve. Because you do.” He whispers.
he thinks but doesn't have the energy to answer the question. Thor and Bruce sit on his right, with Clint on his left as they watch the surroundings in silence. Ambulances tending to the wounded. Nick Fury and his crew taking charge of the situation. Families reuniting.
There’s no other option but to try. Steve punches in the string of numbers and holds his breath. With a soft sigh, the armor disables itself and opens. It feels like something is in his throat, and he can't breathe.
Steve thinks since he has been calling him Queens all this time in his head.
family is never coming back.
He takes a good look at the body and wishes he hasn’t. It's charred and carries the smell of burnt flesh.
And he has all of time to do it.
The funeral is a beautiful and quiet affair. It’s a private one. They’ll hold the public one at some point this week, and Steve has been asked to give a eulogy. He doesn’t think that it should be him and voiced it, but Rhodes had told him gently, “Tony would’ve liked it to be you.” He can’t say no to that.
Rogers narrowed his eyes but still sat straight up in his chair, his hand still on the table. “Director Fury asked me about leading another expedition but did not explain the details.”
"We did science!" Stark replies not even a bit helpfully.
“Yeah, Redwing might get loose and hurt herself otherwise.”
“Dinner first though.”
Tony led Steve in a simple two-step across the roof under the early summer moon. The city lights glowed brightly as the music curled around them. Steve might have stolen a kiss here and there as they danced with their hearts full.
A few short remarks. That’s all he had to do. “I am glad to introduce our main speaker this evening, a man you all already know from his legendary days in the Zeppelin wars to his New Explorers’ Club expedition, Captain Steven Rogers. He is here today to talk about his recent travels to Atlantis. I know you’re looking forward to this as much as I am.” Tony said.
“Have Nakia look at the crates and bring Natasha to my cabin this afternoon, when you’re both free.”
~~~~~
by torakowalski. Not 100% accurate because I didn't double check coulson's shirt color and I am bad at drawing logos on shirts, but yeah. :3
Rogers frowned and stood up. “We should look through the hold in case there is anything other than broken crates.”
Tony snickered. “Like you read my mind.”
“it won’t matter much if we can’t untie the ropes.” Tony pulled up his legs to look at the irons. He noticed how badly they were forged. “It would have been more efficient to shoot us in the head.”
“Hello,” Tony replied. He sat next to T’Challa as he felt the need for an ally in the room, given Pym’s intense dislike of anything Stark and the lack of Jan or Hope as a buffer. He’d hit it off with King T’Challa a couple of years ago at an event at the Club over a discussion of rare metals.
“We did. We did,” Steve said happily.
"He'll have his chance." Steve grins as he drags Stark by the arm. "Come on, I wanna be done by the time food gets here."
The kiss had become heated, and Tony was caressing the hair at the nape of Steve’s neck as Steve’s hands continued to grip his hips. Slowly Steve’s fingers found bare skin under Tony’s shirt and one hand started exploring his skin up his ribs while the other kept a firm grip on his hip as if afraid to let him go. Tony broke the kiss breathless and started kissing the edge of where Steve’s jaw met his neck, taking little breaths between attempts to make a hicky.
“It doesn’t matter though; things aren’t exactly good between us right now. It just doesn’t look like that will ever happen.” Tony smirked but even a Steve from another universe could tell it was sad. He felt Steve’s other hand gently tilt his head up to look at him but closed his eyes when he saw the concerned face. He didn’t want anyone’s pity, but no part of him let him move away from this Steve. He would let the soldier hold him there and study his face for as long as he wanted.
“May I?” Tony asked with a soft smirk, as if he knew Steve wasn’t going to tell him to stop but had to ask anyway. Steve nodded sharply even as he felt a rush of embarrassment add to the heat already flowing through him at being naked in front of someone. Tony slowly pulled Steve’s pants off taking his underwear with them. He settled back in between Steve’s legs now without anything but air between them and stopped to stare.
“Turn over.” Tony guided Steve to his side and started working him open with one finger. Steve shifted uncomfortably with the intrusion and Tony put a hand on his side caressing him tenderly and kissed his shoulder as he settled down behind the soldier. When he pressed in a second figure Steve flinched, his breath catching. Tony stilled instantly.
Steve’s breath hitched as Tony sucked on the skin, his fingers tightening around Tony slightly. Tony moved on after a moment, working his way down until he came to a shirt collar and pulled back slightly.
“But you want to be.” It wasn’t a question; Tony knew Steve could see it. He was hardly hiding it. He was so tired of hiding it. And it wasn’t like this Steve was or even could tell anyone in his world. He nodded, defeated. He had never acknowledged how he felt about Steve to anyone else. JARVIS knew of course but he didn’t tell him. JARVIS just knew things. It was… a
“Do you have- something?” Tony asked, his breathing already picking up again. Steve blinked, taking in the question slowly before his mind caught up.
Steve was getting more agitated trying not to thrust up into Tony’s mouth, twitching around, getting so close. Tony pulled off with a pop and used his hand instead when he felt Steve was on the edge. His hand could go faster and without pause Tony latched onto Steve’s balls instead sucking them into his mouth and lapping at them. Steve arched hard his eyes rolling back as he moaned Tony’s name loudly and came. Tony licked him through the aftershocks making it last as long as possible.
“Tony!” He squeaked loudly, grasping the bed sheets so tightly they started to rip. Tony looked up at him, to see Steve’s chest arched up invitingly, bowed in pleasure and didn’t let up for a moment. Going down as far as he could on Steve’s thickness, using his tongue, flicking the slit at the end and sucking hard on the way back up, using every trick he knew to make it good for Steve.
It wasn’t long before Tony was pushing Steve onto his back in the twin bunk and slowly, tortuously kissing, sucking and nibbling his way down his chest and stomach. By the time he reached the edge of Steve’s pants the soldier was breathless and blushing all the way down his chest. Tony really wanted to know if it went down any further.
“I- Are you and, your Steve, together?” Steve had been looking away as he asked but then looked right at Tony, as if looking for even the smallest reaction. Tony gave one, or rather none, he froze. Slowly he unthawed and took in the position he was in. Kneeling in front of Steve holding his hand. The flight part of him screamed to run, but he didn’t move, didn’t want to pull his hand out of this softer (more open) version of Steve’s hand.
“I want you to feel good too Tony.” Steve didn’t stop stroking him gently, but he did want something else too. Something he’d thought about and thought he’d never get when his own world’s Tony was gone. This might be his only chance to even ask.
“You don’t need to do that sweetheart.” Tony mumbled petting through his hair as Steve stroked him slowly. He was in no hurry anymore as he was so relaxed after his own orgasm.
“Hmmm?” Tony questioned becoming more relaxed as Steve continued to stroke him softly, like they had all the time in the world. Steve nudged his head up and kissed him slow but deep, making a stream of want rush through him, and then whispered words he thought he’d never hear from any Steve.
“…No. We never were.” Tony looked down. Steve didn’t say anything for a moment.
“This has to go.” Tony tugged at the shirt’s sleeve his voice deep with want and Steve quickly pulled it off. The genius noticed Steve looking at his own clothes and stood up, swiftly pulled all of his own clothes off and dropped them on the ground as he resettled himself on Steve’s lap and claiming the soldier’s mouth again.
“No, I mean, I would like that. A lot.” He backpedaled slightly. “But I don’t know how many chances I’ll get at this and I-” Now he was blushing bright red and Tony couldn’t help but to think he looked adorable. Steve took a breath to settle himself, it didn’t really work but he pressed on. “I want to feel you.” He whispered finally as he looked down at the sheets.
It was unexpected but nice when Tony felt Steve gently glide his thumb under his eye on his cheek with the hand that was more cupping his face than holding him there. The next part shouldn’t have surprised him, but it did. He felt Steve’s warm lips press onto his, caressing softly. It lasted for just a moment, but Tony felt it flood his whole body instantly, warmth running from his head to his feet.
This powerful man, a super soldier, with hands that could bend steel, squirmed beneath him, and he did that. Part of him wanted to reveal in that power but all of him just wanted to be good to Steve, to take care of him and protect him. And right now, to give him pleasure, to take him up high and easy him down into the afterglow.
“You can call me Steve. I hope that this means that you’ll stay on.”
Stark is laughing his ass off as MODOK keeps ranting about it's superiority. "You hurt his feelings, man. His ego's as big as his head."
Is Steve confessing? Is he apologizing? Tony is so confused. "What do you mean by missing your chance?"
Steve finds them four hours and one large pitcher of Margarita later. They’re still sober but enjoying the slight buzz from the booze. Stark makes a mean margarita. Delicious but kicks like a mule.
“Come in,” Tony said to Rogers’ silent question.
on my stony
“Good. We’re set then.”
Rogers huffed. He went through the expedition members and ticked off his fingers. “Can’t be that many besides me.”
“I am not comfortable with this either. I’ve had my own bad experiences with people Fury hired and some of the missions.”
“Sounds good. I’ll leave a message in the hedge.”
Then Rogers had the nerve to post camp rules in the camp. He’d even been a complete and utter tool by announcing them at a camp meeting. Like rules mattered.

“Captain Rogers asked if you would be the Chief Science officer if I hired him for the proposed expedition.”
fics,
Wanda looked embarrassed when Steve turned to her. “Wanda?”
“Indeed, I did!”
"Sure," she gets up to take Stark's place at the bar. "Clint get me some strawberries."
"You can't resist this, Stark!" Steve comments as he walks away.
“Captain Rogers, I am glad to meet you,” the young woman said. “I am Wanda Maximoff -- I wrote to you about the animal smuggling in New Timely. Mister Wilson said that you were interested in my information.”
“Captain Rogers isn’t the worst person you’ve worked with. Actually I would trust him head and shoulders and body above your last business partner.”
It's voice is so damn annoying.
“Director Fury said that you might meet us here,” Rogers said. Tony did a double take at Steve’s comment.
uhh, a weird fun angsty AU thing for square Y1, ‘Infinity Gems’ on my
Stark and Steve hold hands, sling an arm over each other's shoulders, bump each other, and all sorts of other things. The affection is so obvious that even a blind person can see it. In fact, a blind person does see it because he comes up to them, cane extended, and very accurately thrusts one end into the small space in between Steve and Stark's thighs on the bench. "Leave room for Jesus,” he says with a grin.

He still was not used to all the amazing machines that now filled the city. Steve had to stop himself from staring at the occasional horseless carriage in the streets or the new improved zeppelins in the air above. He had gone to a restaurant the other day and listened to music coming from a mechanical player piano.
When Tony is sure both of them have been consumed by science, he turns back to Steve who's looking at him like he's trying to solve a puzzle. "Sorry about them. So, how's everyone?"
T’Challa pointed out a couple additional landmarks on the map. “That volcano could perhaps hide a lab.”
Tony's teeth clack shut together.
Fury had sent him with both official instructions and unofficial instructions for the expedition. The public ones had already been published in the newspapers and the official journal of the expedition. The charge was to retrieve certain highly desirable specimens for the Club museum, to conduct scientific experiments, and to survey as much of the Savage Land as they could over the month visit.
“Hmmm.” Pepper had drafted some remarks for him, but Tony had left them back in his office. “I’ve got notes, but I’m a spontaneous man, talking off the cuff is my specialty.”
They would, of course. They didn’t have much ammunition stockpiled to begin with and their rifles were no match for the Gatling guns.
“Thor?”
Steve appreciated Sam’s good taste in tent selection. Steve’s tent was different as he had to have an office with his, so he had a two-chambered tent -- one for his bedroom and personal effects, the other for the expedition office. The tent, like all the others, had been fitted with a long canvas sheet and poles to create a porch outside the tent door.
Sam asked, “Smuggler?”
Maybe this could work if Rogers stuck to his work and left Tony alone.
The portal is thrumming. Stark, Steve, and Reed make last minute checks. Well, Stark and Reed make last minute checks on the machinery while Steve checks Tony over.

“Captain, you promised that you would stop the dinosaur smuggling. We have a lead now. You have to do something.”
Jan considered thoughtfully for a minute. “No, we were all different back then -- different places, different times. There was a war and Hank was always in the lab working for the government. I had my own work. All I knew was that Captain Rogers was a hero from the papers and I had just met Hank. I should tell you that story sometime and think of the lovely stories you can tell your grandchildren.”
“Have you met Colonel Rhodes?” Tony asked, trying to pour all his good manners into his question. Because apparently Rogers had left his at home.
"Don't call yourself a cockroach, Tony. It reminds me of that movie. Ugh." Steve serves up three empty mugs and proceeds to fill them with coffee from a large carafe.
Redwing stretched and yawned. She walked over to Steve and nudged his leg.
"The portal is reacting to the energy signature of the arc reactor, Sir." Jarvis sounds worried, "I suggest you step back until we can safely determine the cause of this."

Unlike Rogers, who had inexplicably been given the seat next to Tony. He turned to Tony. “This is a surprise, Lord Stark.”
"Go home. You don't want to be here when SHIELD arrives. It'll save us all a headache." Stark tells Tony once they've secured MODOK. "Also, Coulson will give you paperwork."

“Not all the time -- I do a lot of odd jobs for the New Explorers’ Club,” Sam explained. Turned out that Sam lived with Rogers too.
Reed updates them about his findings when they get to the workshop. It was a quick call. The search is still ongoing. They're getting that out of the way early because Steve and Stark are eager to show him their New York.

“Redwing is still a baby with a brussel sprout addiction,” Sam said. “I doubt she can be on her own. She’s only ever been a city dinosaur.”
The layout of the camp was simple -- the people tents were on one side, the common area with the huge open tent for dinners and entertainments in the center, and the tents for the supplies, crates and equipment on the other side. An hour before dawn there was no need for anyone to be on the equipment side of the camp.
She had cleared her plan with Steve once Natasha and Nakia filled her in on what they knew about the tech smuggling. It wasn’t much as far as Steve could tell. Hope didn’t have much to add to what had been discovered so far. But at least they were all on the same page for once.
“Would you want to go to the Guggenheim tomorrow, and then maybe go to the cafe nearby afterwards for lunch?” Tony asks. Something pings in the back of Steve’s brain, but he’s too focused. He knows he doesn’t have anything on Wednesdays, and Tony’s just got a morning session.
“She has a bit of red coloring. Redwing is a she, too. Based on my reading.”

“You said you’d help me find the smuggler,” Wanda replied.
“My understanding is that Colonel Rhodes is Captain Danvers’ plus-one for the dinner.”
He sneaks a look at his Steve who's looking at them with an unreadable expression and Tony resists the urge to sigh.
“Uh, hey, Steve?”
"Sir, there's an incoming call from the Black Widow."
Cap!Tony (
Tony had seen her before at the Club, he thought, Miss Romanoff could be the name. She coolly studied him back and turned to Rogers, dismissing Tony. “My ticket?”
This was fun ^^
“Really, Pep?” He slammed a hand on the desk, nearly tipping over the fountain pen and ink. “I should go, I should. But leave before the after dinner talk.”
“I do not know,” Tony admitted. He couldn’t quite imagine the exquisite drawings presented during Rogers’ talk as being done by the Captain himself.
“There’s a lot of pricey equipment lying around, the right sort of temptation for a thief like you.”

But the Portal --yes, he's capitalizing it in his head now-- worked more like it sucked him in and just spat him out. No delays. Just in one end and out the other. In his case, falling sideways to the floor where his armor makes an unholy crashing noise as they get acquainted with the scratched floors of someone’s workshop. Or lab. There's equipment and tools he can make out from where he’s sprawled.
Steve's hand is smooth but not soft as he holds onto it. The serum probably takes care of any calluses before they can even form. Tony remembers the calluses his Sheriff has. The roughness of his palms during those times he's taken Tony's hand in his in one of his reassuring speeches. All Steves might be prone to them, he thinks.
“Something more.”
Janet Van Dyne lavished love and attention on the Club’s annual dinner. A member of the Board of Trustees since the club’s founding, she had presided over the dinner ever since she suggested the fundraiser. Decked out in exquisitely fashionable jewelry with a dazzling diamante hair comb tucked in her grey hair, she greeted Tony with a kiss for each cheek. “Lovely to be sitting at your table this year,” she said.
"We should show him a good time. Don't think I didn't notice all your blood drain south when you realized who was in the suit." Stark teases some more. “Could be fun to see how you do with two of us instead of just me.”
(This fanart has no connection to the stevetony bang, btw.)
"Tony! What's happening?" Steve yells from across the room. He looks a bit worse for wear but overall fine. More than fine. Tony never fails to appreciate how good the man looks in blue.
“Now you know about the Pym technology --”
"Tony, who is this?" the man asks the other Tony, then turns to him. "Identify yourself."
"I did not say, honey," Steve protests.
"Steve?" Tony asks cautiously. The man looks like Steve, packed with maybe thirty more pounds of muscle.
And I gave tony glasses on a whim bc SO CUTE
In turn, it fascinates Stark that Tony's Steve is baseline human and is not Captain America. Stark's Steve may be human perfection, but Tony wouldn't trade his Sheriff for the world, even if all the muscles are really damned impressive.
"We noticed," Tony points out, analysing the energy signatures and cross referencing with his own list.
“That would be all fine and dandy, if you had opened the coffee crate.” Tony walked over to the crate. “This is clearly the explosives crate.”
He had been assigned to Rogers’ airship. Natasha was in charge of the other airship and Barton was handling the cargo airship. At least they would be traveling in relative modern comfort for the first leg of the journey.
Steve could still feel the chill magic of the void clinging to his skin, even on a beautiful evening like this. What he could palpably feel was what he was missing out on. The world had moved on, leaving him in the dust. He couldn’t get a handle on anything going on. New books, new art, new stage shows.
Tony had his own suspicions about the expedition ever since the discovery of the first crate had been broken into. “We’ll need to keep observing.”
He walked forward another couple of steps, and immediately tripped off a snare. The snare wrapped around both of their legs, throwing them to the ground. The trap also set off a loud clanging noise as an alarm.
Tony held the leash while Redwing, who had decided that the rain was terrible, shivered against the safety of Tony’s legs. Rogers got up gracefully despite the slippery wood deck but he was dripping wet. Tony spoke before he thought it over. “Come on, let’s get you dried off.”
” Pym.
“You didn’t know that Fury has been running a spy ring for the government on the side?” Steve asked, clearly baffled that Tony didn’t know this.
“When can we free Redwing?” Wanda asked as Steve put Redwing into the pen so Clint could test the resiliency of the protective cover.
Rogers blinked a couple of times, then looked around the ballroom before turning back to Tony. “I was not expecting to be seated up front.” He took a step to the side.
“Good. I look forward to working together.”
“Tony.”
Tony laughs as he's let go. "Maybe. We'll see."
"I suggest you answer the man before he pries you out of that tin can," other Tony tells him. Just then, more familiar faces rush into the room.

"Wha-- Jarvis?" The voice is Jarvis but it’s not coming from his HUD.
Steve studied the baby sleeping in front of them. Wanda had already made a list of appropriate food and other things that they should know.

Steve pointed out, “They have to control the supply chain of dinos in order to get their money back. That camp was set up to capture and hold dinosaurs. With the reinforced pens, stolen equipment, guns.”
“Join you?” T’Challa frowned thoughtfully. “The idea is very tempting, indeed. But to do so would draw attention to the expedition in ways that would risk discovering the smugglers.”

“You’ll need to be careful when we’re on land,” Wanda warned Steve.
“Ship’s crew.” Wilson glanced at Rogers and then to Tony. “It has to be out now, Thor drinks with those guys.”
And a pair of really,
Wanda interrupted, “I’ve heard about Justin Hammer.” She was shaking. “Back in New Timely -- Pietro and I were searching for who was bringing in the dinosaurs. That’s the name a couple of our sources mentioned.”
“You know the supply chain? Who’s at the top? The whole deal?” Sam asked.
She flashed a wary smile at him. “This is where the dinosaurs come from -- the pets that people are tripping over themselves to buy.”
According to Bruce, "Villains know never to disrupt date night because it does not bode well for their well-being."
When Tony needed a specific ink for his mechanical drawings, both Bruce and Hope referred him to Steve, who indeed had the requisite ink. Steve also had some excellent drafting paper.
“It’s okay, Steve,” Tony said. “I know you promised Wanda to return Redwing home. But have you considered that she’s already made the calculation that four square meals a day, a soft bed and all the toys she can destroy is a better deal than the forest?”
"Aaand that's our cue to leave," Bucky says, dragging Clint along when he tries to protest. The rest of the crew follows.
Steve shouldn’t stare. He’d long professionally admired Tony aesthetically, given his love of drawing and art. But being thrown in with Tony as much as he had been, Steve felt something deep and stirring whenever Tony spoke or laughed or sang in the many entertainments the expedition had thrown to amuse themselves. Steve did not have a good singing voice nor could he play an instrument, so he was the audience.
"The multiverse theory is real?" Tony can't believe it. "All this time, we've developed all sorts of interstellar travel, and it's only now I learn that someone can travel to an alternate universe?"
Steve's face lights up in a happy smile. "I'm glad. I'm not all that good with expressing how I feel. I didn't want to mess up our friendship so I didn't say anything. But Steve, the other Steve, told me not to wait too long and miss my chance because our lives are crazy--"
“The last thing we need is conflict between the expedition members and the ship’s crew,” Rogers said. “I don’t want a repeat of what happened on the Amazon expedition.”
Rogers was not as impeccably turned out as Tony was. Not that Tony was an expert on clothes or the latest fashion, but he noticed details like the worn spot on Rogers’ lapel and the slight fray on the hem of his pants. “Captain,” he greeted the man.
Second fill on my bingo card for round 1 of stony bingo 2016.
Steve cautiously peeked over the edge of the basket. “About a mile. Clint and Sam are throwing up some barricades.”
Stark is laughing even as Steve greets the newcomer. "Hey, Matt. What brings you out of Hell's Kitchen?"
“What does this technology look like?”
T’Challa sighed. “Not technology exactly, but a metal. Not like your steel. Vibranium.”
His lizard brain prompted an image of Tony Stark, reminding him how much he enjoyed Stark’s company. When Stark was not angry with him.
“You know you want to. It will be fun times just like when we were in university. Lots of laughs, sciencing, the whole hog.”
Tony sighed and glanced over his study full of leather bound books, hastily drawn schematics, an old globe, the light streaming through leaded glass windows. Pepper insisted on meeting him here, instead of his workshop, to go over business. He had to concede to her obvious wisdom in Tony-management given the constant chaotic state of his expansive workshop, complete with his latest clockwork robots. “I assume that Rhodey is going.”
“Our official goals are to gather specimens for the museum, conduct scientific explorations, and to map areas of the Savage Land. However, a number of us have additional missions.”
Tony spots one of the haulers below pause in the process of lifting a crate and looks up. He stays still, not wanting to reveal himself before Steve gives him the go ahead. He’s proud to say he is doing his best to be a good operative, mostly because he doesn’t want Steve's lectures on responsibility so early in the morning.
While waiting for his coat and hat, Tony pondered. Maybe he should be out there meeting people. He could feel the tug of loneliness more often than he prefered. But he’d learned the hard way that people couldn’t be trusted, and that flaws were often hidden behind smiling faces and shining reputations.
Rhodey put his fork down. “For me -- Come back in one piece, Tony, that’s all I ask. I don’t want to be called in for another rescue if you go missing.”
"Tony---" the exasperated tone is familiar and the accompanying smile makes Tony’s chest ache. Unlike Tony, Steve blushes so prettily.
They said nothing as they smashed the irons with all their might, until finally they broke free. They hastily scrambled up higher on the cave rocks.
“Is this something to take seriously?” Sam asked.
Steve sighed heavily. He should be more upset about finding out a new thing about Fury’s operations every day. But right now, he was more worried about the safety of his expeditions and friends. “We need intel and a plan.”
“Yes. Do that.”
The rest of the Avengers trickle into the living room like tired ducklings, most of them making their way over to pour themselves some margarita while Sam heads to the kitchen to get food. It's funny how their team is the same name as his ship and that their Sam is so young!
“When were you going to say something about that?” Sam asked. “Sounds like a great idea.”
“The point was to let her go free,” Steve said. His heart clenched at the idea of leaving her behind.
Sam gives him a shit eating grin. "I have homework."
Tony is uncomfortable with caves; he was only partly suited up before they fell and that makes him even more on edge. Not to mention the way the jetboot repulsors were being stubborn and not turning on - until they did.
Steve looked over the team swarming like bees to set up camp and thought that they were all that they had for one solid month. Sam and Thor were already done with marking out the place to erect a fence. It had been Sam’s idea to keep out the unknown dangers that could attack in the night or day. They hadn’t been there long enough to have learned anything about the local dinosaurs and large species of mammal population.
Pepper tucked a stray lock of red hair behind her ear. “I’m not seeing that on your schedule for tomorrow.”
“Sam and Thor have studied the weather -- they seem to think that the storms will be passing soon.”
“Not Lord Stark?”
Tony stares. Who is this guy?
Dora Milaje led them in circles so they would lose sight of the restaurant. On their way back to the expedition hotel, Tony and Rogers walked along one of the harbor’s seawalls. Rogers stopped and leaned on the fence, holding his hat in his fingers. Tony hated himself for noticing how the afternoon sun shone on Rogers’ golden hair. Rogers was unfairly gorgeous right there and then, almost distracting Tony away from the problem on hand.
Tony replied. “That’s a small comfort.”
"Would you like to though?" Stark prompts. "Cause if he's anything like my Steve, he might be more open to it than you think."
Alone in his cabin, Tony thought long and hard about reaching out towards the Captain. He’d made attempts before, when Rogers returned to the land of the living. It hadn’t gone well then and he had little hopes now. But he did have to work with Rogers. Maybe checking in before takeoff would not be amiss.

Tony was irresistible in the white summer suit he’d somehow gotten his hands on. Steve felt dizzy as Tony took him by the hand to lead him up a winding staircase to the roof. Above them the bright full moon soared. Steve could hear the music from the raucous party going on downstairs. “It’s beautiful,” Steve said in awe.
“No one but me has this manifest,” Tony said. “I keep it in my cabin and my cabin is locked.”
“Clint’s more efficient than that,” Nat told him.

Meanwhile, he could enjoy sneaking looks at Tony’s flexing arms as Steve finalized the camp rules. Redwing turned around, nearly crushing Steve’s foot. Camp Rule One had to be changed to “Don’t feed Redwing any more treats.” People were shamelessly feeding her treats at all hours which only reinforced her tendency toward begging.
"Doctor Killian. We work for him but it's his project," the man answers, obviously terrified.
“It’s been long, Captain,” Lang agreed.
The next thing Tony sees is the Hulk and Thor rushing towards MODOK. Thor's hammer hits MODOK's gigantic head from above and Hulk smashes the chair.
"You need back up, Stark?" asks Bucky, their troubleshooter, sniper, and Steve's lifetime BFF.
(based on fic by Laireshi)
They arrived at the same time as other hurrying theatre goers. Rhodey checked their tickets while Tony quickly scanned the crowd. No one he had to greet -- then a large heavy mass landed against his back. “Pardon me, sir,” the low voice said politely.
“He didn’t break into those crates. But I don’t know what’s up with her.”
“No, all the signs point to it. Defeat the army and we can get back to the kissing part of the expedition plans.”
Tony sighed and got up for a walk outside. Given the odds and his luck, it was probably still rainy. It was a terrible idea to go out on deck but he was now all riled up.
Some (spoilerish?) doodles of a scene from one of my
"I missed you too, Sheriff," Tony admits. He may not say it out loud, but he's not gonna keep himself from showing affection. If only a little bit. But not too much to weird Steve out.
“Me too,” Rogers replied with a smile.
“He said he was going to have a meeting with the expedition sponsors in a couple of days but wanted to sound out my interest first.” Steve frowned as he thought over the meeting. “He said it was about collection specimens for the collections. I don’t think that’s the entire reason.” He shook his head. “You know Fury. He was keen that Natasha come along as well.”

With that, he swoops closer to the haulers, targeting joints, then goes straight to the front entrance.
“Well, talk to him, get him on our side,” Pym urged.
“And I’ll get Bruce to back it up. Who would want to sabotage the expedition?” Tony asked.
They had gone out to dinner at sidewalk cafe. Nat already had plans for checking in on an old friend. Though Steve suspected that was a cover story. He couldn’t quite put his finger on what Fury was up to. He hadn’t talked like the executive director of an explorer’s club. Steve had a sinking feeling that he had worked with people like Fury before, back in the Zeppelin War.

“No chance that Captain Rogers has declined being the after dinner speaker?”
Rogers pulled the porthole window shut. “It’s the most secure place I could locate that wouldn’t generate gossip.”
“Okay -- you deflate the balloon and I’ll aim to land in the center of camp.”
"I am not familiar with the technology but it has not powered down, Sir. It appears to be on standby through some internal power source."
Rogers sat down and Tony snuck a glance at him. He seemed more closed off than ever before. If Tony didn’t know better, he would have thought that Rogers was embarrassed by the display. But people like Rogers wouldn’t be.

Tony yawned and stretched. “It’s not like we have to stick with the list like we’re on a shopping trip or else. If we find new plants or a particularly interesting specimen, we nab that.”
“We’re not going to that tent -- we’re going to Captain Rogers’,” Tony said firmly.
round 2, first fill: square N3
Something resonated deep within Tony. He’d only ever been on the one expedition. That one had felt different too. “In what way?”
Sam opened the door and they were not prepared for the huge market in front of them. Stalls and crates and people filled the warehouse. They walked past women hawking herbs from Latveria and fish from Atlantis. Miss Maximoff smiled and nodded at the vendors as they made their way to her destination.
“I mean, does anyone else know that you’ve been in jail?” Barton needled. “You stole money from the company you worked for.”
"How do we take this thing down?" he calls out to Stark. Thor and Hulk are having a game of who can take out more AIM agents at the other side of the warehouse.
The sharp crack of wood snapped Tony to attention. He walked around the supply tents, narrowing down the tent with the noise. The saboteur was at work again. Tony gritted his teeth. The noise was coming from the next tent just ahead and around the corner. He slowed down and crept closer to the tent. The tent flap had been untied and Tony could open it without being noticed.
"I'm sending Sam and Bucky after the trucks," Steve replies. "We're almost there, Tony. Two minutes."

“With the Hammer weapons, whatever they stole from Stark Industries, the Pym control collars and the vibranium, AIM could create a velociraptor army to invade anywhere.”
They stopped to take a deep breath. “Where are we?” Tony asked.
“Not luck, soldier,” Tony whispered, as if he was reading Steve’s mind. “Destiny.”
“You want everything, don’t you?” Tony teased back.
Tony walked out of the meeting, even had a spring in his step as he thought about the expedition possibilities. Rogers had a plan and Tony had ideas.
The Hug n fly! :D
“This isn’t right,” Sam muttered.
“Until recently, I didn’t know you well. We hadn’t worked together and all I knew was from the papers. Fury was very tight-lipped about the whole business.”
“And while you’re asking Sharon, ask her to join us for the concert too.”
“AIM is the new HYDRA, Steve,” Natasha explained. “Started up from the ashes of the HYDRA after your war.”
(idk if this is in character or realistic dialogue! i dont person well and i have trouble articulating stuff abt anxiety, my anxiety makes problems for me and relationships, so i was trying to get that across for steve. and i tend to run on when i write, so when i have to be concise it ends up sounding choppy… but i finished the thing so that’s good enough for me..)
They were a couple of days out from the coast of Wakanda and a couple of weeks from the Savage Land.
“We won,” Tony said to Steve, who pulled Tony close to kiss his smudged, dirty face.
“They didn’t even leave any camp guards behind.” They walked right into the huge AIM encampment.
“You know -- people clapping their hands ….” Tony had a joke on the tip of his tongue but Rogers’ steady look killed off any possible amusement. “Okay, well. I will be making a few remarks, then it’s your turn in the spotlight.”
"I did tell you I'd send Clint down there but you said--"
“Is this supposed to be a date?” Steve blurts, looking at Tony, whose eyes have gone wide. There’s a pause, and now they’re both aware that the people nearest them are watching now.
Tony did not like that uneasy sudden feeling that something was not on the up-and-up with the expedition or that Steve Rogers was holding back information from him. Last time he’d had those feelings, he’d been left for dead in the wilderness.
“Thank you, Nakia,” Steve said.
“Animal handlers. And, um, Miss Maximoff uses magic.” Now Rogers was looking at Tony, waiting for a reaction to the idea of bringing a magic user along.

“I should warn you, Captain. Lord Stark, while an admirable scientist, is far from being a suitable man for the job,” Pym interjected. “His history is well known.”
So he concludes that Tony’s not going to be the one to make the first move if he is interested - Tony has never asked out someone he’s friends with, they’ve always been the ones to do so. Best example is Pepper, again, but not the only example. No, when Tony asks people out, they’re always people he barely knows, but he definitely like-liked Pepper before they started dating. Basically, Steve decides, it’s up to him to be the brave one and ask Tony out.
They took a horse cab down to the Customs House near the docks. Steve stepped out of the cab, into the afternoon sunlight. Longshoremen, traders, and all sorts of people milled about the line of warehouses.
“Can’t stop me. I’ve lodged a complaint with the Cargo Ship Trivia Contest Judging Association already. I have suspicions about that question.”
“That’s not how the saying goes.”

"Holy shit."
As for Captain Rogers, he’d met Rogers a week after he’d been rescued from the Void. Everyone had been excited by the news. Rogers had disappeared right after saving hundreds of thousands of people all over the world in the last battle of the Great Zeppelin War. He’d taken down a fleet of death ships. Tony had grown up surrounded by stories of how great Rogers was. Howard filled their house with memorabilia and talked incessantly about the man, whom he had known. A fan in childhood, Tony had become more skeptical as he grew older and more alienated from his father.
Tony catches movement in his peripheral vision. The woman with the rocket launcher is on her knees up and aiming for him. He leaps out of the way as he raises his gauntlet to return fire.
Lang said nothing but turned to his food.
“Probably are,” Steve agreed with a grimace. This wasn’t going to end well for him or Tony.
Tony frowned. “Not sure. I don’t like the feeling of unfinished business, to be honest.”
"Yep. Got shrapnel in my chest. Built an electromagnet to keep me from dying. The reactor powers the magnet. Also powers the suit. Sometimes I charge my phone here too." He lifts his t-shirt to show his chest.
“Tony, hush. Wanda?”
"Maybe? I don't know. I don't ask questions. The higher ups are scary. Please, I'm just a scientist. They told us we're developing new technology. We never thought any of this was illegal."
Fanart of Sabrecmc's A Higher Form of War:
Tony raised an eyebrow at that. “Hope and her whatever?” Hank Pym was probably expecting her to spy for him.
"If it's a minor disturbance, the big guys can handle it," Sam volunteers, pointing in Steve's direction. Tony has learned Steve, Hulk and Thor can't get drunk without some high octane stuff like Asgardian mead or a special potion Thor drops into his drink. He doesn't know if he's sad or envious of that.
He gets his chance later, when Steve offers him a hand as they invite him up to the penthouse. With a full belly and a slight buzz from two beers he's had, he happily accepts.
Steve was knocking on the rocks as he moved further back into the cave. Tony followed him, clinging to the rocks as best he could. The sea water was roaring back and forth below them as the waves crashed into the cave.
“Captain,” Fury said with a nod as Rogers walked into the room.
Sam patted her head. “What now?”

“I’ve got Pepper and the bots. I’m fine. And what’s this now -- ‘we’ worry?”
Tony clinked Steve’s tankard with his. “To ‘magic sucks.’”
Tony had planned to pretend to listen to Rogers during his talk. But he kept getting drawn into his descriptions of Atlantis, bolstered by the illustrated lantern slides that were projected on the wall behind him. Rogers shone under the low lighting, looking far more handsome than he should have and Tony found him more distracting than expected.
contrary to how i draw him at times, steve is taller than tony in the story! ^^''
“Since you aren’t spending the morning with your new bestie Tony for once, I want to talk about how long Clint and Pietro have been gone,” Natasha said after ambushing Steve first thing in the morning.
O5 is Waking up married - featuring AVAC steve and tony!
Not that anyone had started a prank war yet in camp. Yet another reason to miss Rhodey like hell.
and a question - is it his steve, or 616!steve?! extra drama! >:)
Tony shakes his head, willing away the envy in his gut at the knowing looks the pair sends each other. "I don't want to disrupt the status quo. Friendship's good enough for me."
“Salutations, Captain Rogers. I attended your lecture the other night and heard your call to be protective of native species and fauna. You should know about the illegal trade in dinosaurs from the Savage Land. I can show you evidence. If you or a person of your choosing -- I am assuming that a man of your stature is very busy -- can meet me, put your response in the hedges outside your house by tomorrow afternoon. Please excuse the secrecy -- but people with money and influence are involved and are willing to do anything to protect their merchandise. Sincerely, Wanda Maximoff.”
“I can use magic to set up a protective barrier,” Wanda offered.
The girl’s father apologized to everyone within eyesight while the little girl petted her momentarily winded pet. Tony glanced over to Rhodey, who tugged on Tony’s coat sleeve to steer him into the bookstore before Tony said anything.
“We -- Sam, Natasha, Clint and I -- haven’t forgotten about the dinosaur smuggling. We don’t have any leads right now.”
“Fury knows everything,” Rogers replied with a shrug.
“You don’t have to like the man -- though I don’t understand why you don’t -- but you don’t have to turn tail and avoid him either,” Rhodey said.
“Okay there, Steve?” Sam asked.
“Do you know much about the dinosaur trade?”
It's over in a few minutes with MODOK lying on his back like an overturned tortoise. They round up the rest of the stragglers and call SHIELD for the clean-up.
Nodding, Tony offered Steve more liquor. “I don’t like magic -- I have more faith in science -- it can be understood, reproduced and everyone gets the same results. Magic is more like an art, I guess.”
It’d just be nice if for once it was him being one half of a happy couple.
He needed people on his side for this. He could trust Natasha and Clint as long he worked on Fury’s side. Sam was ride or die. The Maximoffs, Hope van Dyne and Scott Lang were in this for their own reasons. Steve was convinced that the only reason Miss van Dyne was on this trip was to scout on her own for the stolen Pym equipment. Dr. Pym had been too cagey to tell Fury about what had been stolen. And Natasha and Nakia acted like long-lost sisters.
"Shut up, Buck!" Steve protests, adorably embarrassed. "Don't listen to him."
Dinner conversation dragged, of course, now that Tony had to entertain Captain Rogers. Rogers held himself stiffly and added very little to the lively conversation at dinner. Tony checked his pocket watch a few times to see when Fury would finally get the show on the road.
Back at Steve and Sam’s house, Wanda helped them create a soft box nest for the baby dinosaur and set the box in front of the fire. As far as they could tell, it was a young Aquilops, maybe a few weeks old. “These dinosaurs are in high demand,” Wanda explained. “They are vegetarians and naturally the size of house cats. Dealers trim the beak down because of the sharpness.”
“I bought a book,” he explained. “And Captain Rogers gave me some tips.”
“We’re in a safe place,” Sam urged. “You can tell us.”

"Sheriff, can you get me permission for a surprise inspection?" Tony hovers a hundred feet above the buildings in stealth mode, not wanting to reveal himself just yet and alert those on the ground.
"These are the coordinates. He figured you'd be able to pick up the anomaly. I have the team on standby and we're ready to back you up when you find it." Tony can hear the smile in Steve's voice. It’s easy to see him leaning back in his Captain's chair, sipping his first coffee of the day. "Are you picking up anything?"
“Maybe,” Miss Maximoff replied, with a glint in her eye. “Does it matter if animal lives are on the line?” She looked around again, clearly still uneasy about the courtyard. “I need to show you.”
“We should leave our coats --” Rhodey pointed over to the coat check.
Maybe Fury was the most familiar thing of all.
“Colonel Rhodes, a pleasure,” Rogers said, shaking Rhodey’s hand.
Except that’s not what really was going on under the surface at all. The expedition was ambushed by a band of ruthless mercenaries and Tony dragged off to be held for ransom. He’d fought his way to freedom, finding in himself deep reserves he had never suspected. Rhodey had found him and returned him back to a family home Tony could no longer recognize or want to linger in.

She nodded to Tony, then turned to the coat check. Great, now he had to deal with Rogers and his mysterious friend. Rogers glanced down at the floor before awkwardly saying, “I wish we’d met again under better circumstances --”
"Oh God. Tony! Are you okay? Where are you? We were so worried. I was so--" He hears Steve take a deep breath and let it out, steadying himself. "Where are you, Tony?"
Steve was more than glad to clear the air. At breakfast the next morning he announced an emergency meeting, calling everyone in the expedition to the central tent.
“Just that?” Steve said with a smile. “But first we have to get out of this cave.”
“Always do. The problem is more complicated -- the fuel to replace gas, then delivery of that fuel. Electricity might do the trick --”
The Savage Land, a strange place truly left behind by time, loomed large in people’s imaginations. Difficult to reach, filled with dinosaurs, monstrous mammals, and covered with immense thick and overgrown rain forests. Not the land around the south pole, but close to it and defying all known laws of climate and weather.
Tony turned to Rogers, who gave him a puzzled look back. Right. Tony was the money and Rogers the muscle. Just how Fury was going to connect all the loose threads was the only mystery left. And Tony was along for the ride.
“I have a job, Tony, with the Air Ship Force high command. I can’t drop everything for some trip.”
“Okay -- I didn’t realize we had gone from basic suspicion to outright paranoia already in one afternoon.”
"Be careful, Tony. Don’t go in alone. Call us and we'll be there in five," Steve says in a voice that’s half Sheriff, half friend who knows exactly how Tony is.
“No, this is about stopping the smuggling of Wakandan technology,” T’Challa corrected.
So he went. A good boy carrying out his father’s legacy and all that. At the end of it all, a promise of reward -- fame, a place in the world he made for himself, the spotlight speech at the Annual Dinner, respect, trust.
“Yeah, let me think.” He rummaged through the spare parts chest in the corner of the cabin and handed the dino a chunk of wood.
“Standard protocol,” Rogers replied. He'd squatted down to look more closely at the pried-open crate. “Any of your people need something?”
They were seated at their favorite table at Rhodey’s club, with an excellent steak dinner and well-aged wine. Rhodey’s club was all wood and thick carpets, the very epitome of an old established organization dedicated to the needs of the military. They even had a framed tribute painting of the war hero Captain Rogers installed just off the lobby.
The next day, Tony wakes up around ten with a hangover, as does everyone else with the exception of Sam. In true hangover-fashion, they order a brunch of pizza and chicken wings. It’s oddly reassuring to see Earth’s greatest heroes squinting and clutching at their heads after a night of strong liquor.
He had the money for a cab to the Club, a fact that still amazed Steve who had grown up poor in a rundown part of the city. The tenement he’d lived in had long been torn down to make room for brownstone buildings, like the one Steve currently lived in. Modern, spacious, full of light and air, decorated according to the current taste with fantastic printed wallpapers, rented furniture and accessories.
He trusts Tony. He just doesn't like it when he's out there flying solo. From now on, no one on the team gets sent out without a partner. No matter what Fury says. He's so focused on his worries he doesn't hear Jarvis' alert.
A little fanart inspired by a scene in this amazing, epic-length fic:
“Yeah, he’s the greatest.” Also Scott seemed to be Rogers’ number one fan boy in camp, which didn’t get on Tony’s nerves as much as he might have thought. “He’s an artist so he explained composition and framing to me.”
Steve shook his head. “It can’t be just dinosaurs. The dinosaur pet market depends for now on illegal imports from the Savage Land. People are starting to breed domestic dinos, which are more available and cheaper than the smuggled dinos.”
Tony’s thoughts were interrupted by a knock on the door. He was gobsmacked by the sight of Rogers in his dark tailored suit and brilliant blue tie matching his eyes. He hadn’t really looked at the captain before, not enough to really take in how classically handsome the man was. And just Tony’s type.
Rhodey pushed the remains of his potatoes and leeks on his plate with a bit of a frown on his face. He sighed and then grinned at Tony. Tony knew he had Rhodey hooked and now all he had to do was reel him in. “You could ask me to think it over all night, and I’d still have to say no, Tones. If I didn’t have the promotion coming up or Carol --”
Steve reminded himself that was the plan and had always been the plan from the beginning. “You can work with her then, Wanda.”
"You got it, Iron Man."
For what it was worth, he’d made a more commercially viable version of that coffee machine which sold like hot cakes and one of the reasons why he could fund some of the expedition. He had no idea if Steve, who had to be daunted by all the new technology, was even still using the little machine.
“Wait -- so you said that Wanda didn’t know about velociraptors. AIM is smuggling out the safer vegetarian dinosaurs for pet sales, and keeping the dangerous carnivores like velociraptors for their own purposes. Basically they are selling off the dinosaurs that they don’t want to pay for their smuggling operations.”
"You are mocking MODOK! I know now what this other Iron Man is! He is either a clone or from a different time! No matter, he shall be eliminated along with his counterpart!" With that, MODOK unleashes a huge beam aimed for Tony.
Tony toyed with a screwdriver on his desk. He’d bought it at a shop in the city two years prior, the day before he’d heard that they had recovered the war hero Captain Rogers from a magic stasis. Just a random fact he remembered each time he picked it up. The screwdriver turned out to be a good tool; the famous hero Rogers a disappointment.
Scott rattled off a lot about frequencies and sound waves. Tony listened raptly. He thumped Scott on the shoulder. “That should work.” Scott beamed.
“I don’t own Redwing,” Rogers replied.
“Hmmm, I don’t know exactly. I can’t put my thumb on it. I thought at first that the collecting of specimens felt like a shopping list. Jane did mention that the new museum was in desperate need of new specimens and displays.”
Tony hugs him back. "Thanks for everything, Steve."
“We should catch up.”
"Looks like work starts at nine a.m. Good to know some things never change."
“Hope, you need to trust Tony and me on this. You should have come to us,” Steve said.
“We don’t need to talk about it again.”
"Not that I know of. We rattle around the ship travelling most of the time. Not really conducive for a healthy relationship."

“We’ll keep up the defense. You work on that,” Steve ordered.
The beautiful late summer evening outside the restaurant windows proved the city’s charms. A city worker methodically lit the gas street lights, which twinkled in the dusk as each light flashed on. Another attraction of New Timely was the vast number of activities going on in the city at any time. Tony could choose to go to a boxing match or a lecture at the Club or to a concert.
The genius had a goal though and Steve had just figured it out as the searing heat of Tony’s mouth enveloped him.
“You know I’m not staying. That I will have to go back.” He whispered. As much as it pained him to say, he couldn’t tell this man he would stay, as much as he’d like to. He had responsibilities. What was left of his friends to protect. Steve looked sad but not surprised, he had already known.
“Inside me, please Tony.” Steve panted pushing back into Tony’s hand but refusing to touch himself until Tony was inside him. He didn’t want to come again without Tony. He felt loss as Tony pull his fingers out and gentle rolled him the rest of the way onto his stomach. Tony’s knees spread his thighs part and then there was something bigger pressing at his hole and Steve clenched the pillow as Tony pulled his cheeks apart and the head of Tony’s cock pushed inside.
to not deny it.
“But I want something…” He was nervous to say it, even after all this but he had Tony’s attention now.
“Until then?” He asked looking so hopeful that Tony finally broke pressing their lips back together.
“There’s usually, something in there. Lotion maybe.” Steve gestured to the bedside table and Tony reached over easily from the twin bunk and open the draw. There was lotion, but the baby oil would work better and leave less mess, so he pulled that out instead. Turning back to Steve he paused. He was so caught up in the desire, the pure want that he almost forgot he wanted to be gentle, kind. He didn’t want to rush this or do something Steve wasn’t ready for.
“TOony” Steve squealed and tried to buck up, just realizing at the angle Tony had him he couldn’t. Tony had complete control over him. Steve felt lava rush into his manhood at the realization, that Tony was fucking him and there was nothing he could do about it. He was at Tony’s mercy.
“There we go. You good sweetheart?” Tony asked sensing Steve’s muscles relax and then shudder. Steve nodded wanting nothing more than to turn and rut into the bed but not wanting to lose Tony’s fingers in him. “Please.” Steve didn’t know what he was asking but wanted more. “More.”
“Alright.” Tony commanded the soldier’s attention stepping in the way of where a trench was being worn into the floor and steered Steve with a hand on his shoulder to the twin bunk to sit him down on one of the few pieces of furniture in the spartan Shield room. “Breathe.” He ordered once Steve was sitting. The soldier breathed in like he just realized he hadn’t been. The breath shuttered out and he took another without prompting. “Good.” The genius praised as he slid down to one knee, so he wasn’t hovering over Steve.
Steve looked down when he felt a tug on his pants and found Tony’s beautiful brown eyes looking up through dark lashes at him.
The genius gasped as Steve came clenching down on him and bring him over the edge with the soldier. He collapsed the rest of the way onto Steve’s back as his mind went blank. Finally, not thinking, at all, about anything. Not even with Extreamis. He was completely relaxed feeling Steve’s back slowly rise and fall gently beneath him. Eventually he came back to himself, his brain starting to think again, but slowly, like he was just coming back online.
“I-” Steve started to speak again but cut himself off with a frown. “I- uhg!” Steve threw his hands up and started pacing. “I don’t know how say it. I just…” The soldier continued pacing, seeming to get more frustrated with himself. After a few minutes of pacing and half aborted attempts to tell him whatever it was Tony couldn’t take it anymore. A frustrated Steve pulled at his emotions, which could make him frustrated, but at the moment it was just pulling on his heartstrings.
Tony guided Steve into the room by his wrist and shut (extreamis locking) the door behind them.
Steve started to shift, his blush growing under the genius’s keen eyes. Tony smiled at him and leaned down kissing him softly. “You’re beautiful Steve.” He whispered before deepening the kiss and leaning down more so that every inch of their now exposed skin touched. Once they were both breathless again Tony made his way down much quicker than the first time, never stopping even though his mouth and tongue were leaving a hot streak down Steve’s chest and his abs quivered once Tony made his way over them.
“Yeah, I’m with you.” Steve mumbled out but raised his head to look at Tony and gave him a pained smile. “I wanted to ask you, somethings. About, your world. I just- is that okay?” Steve looked so lost Tony couldn’t possibly deny him. He really was never good at saying no to those hopeful blue eyes. Tony smirked gently at Steve.
Tony’s first thought was, he should probably get off Steve, as comfortable as he was, most people didn’t seem to like it when you used them for a bed. He gently pulled out of Steve and rolled to the side. Steve groan almost like in disapproval and rolled onto his back, before gathering Tony to him. Pulling him on top of his front. Tony stilled letting himself be manhandled on top of Steve’s chest, but not sure what to do. He had been almost sure, he should leave before Steve grabbed him, the other man seemed to sense his indecision though.
Steve barely had time to look at Tony before the beautiful genius was back on his lap completely naked and kissing him as if his life depended on it. His hands moved hesitantly to the globes of Tony’s ass and squeezed with both hand as he pulled Tony closer. Tony’s breath hitched when Steve’s firm hands grabbed him and pulled him in, he ground against Steve making the soldier groan and shudder.
Tony pressed up tighter behind him, chest to back and began scissoring his opening. Steve pushed back into the fingers. And now knew what he really wanted.
"What's on today's agenda?" Steve asks them as he sits at the head of the table beside Stark.
Steve could feel the beating heart of the dinosaur against his chest. He worried about the labored breathing and didn’t care about the claws biting into his skin.
"Mother-hen," Tony teases even as data starts scrolling on one side of the HUD.
"We dropped off the fragments at the Baxter Building." Stark raises his hands. "Before you tell me off for being rude, Reed was still awake and told me to take it there. He said he'll be in touch. So I guess we'll hear from him soon. Maybe even tomorrow."
"More like SHIELD only noticed because Coulson's team was in the area a couple weeks ago on a whole unrelated mission and his science ducklings noticed the weird readings affecting their equipment." That’s Natasha chiming in this time.

“Yeah, but it doesn’t mean I shouldn’t check either -- I’m out in the field looking for particular rocks and minerals as part of my radiation studies. I might find a plant or two -- saves her some effort.”
He is the definition of smol ;3
“That isn’t a surprise,” Clint said from the back of the tent. A number of other people nodded and murmured in agreement. Sam shifted in his seat and folded his arms.

“Oh,” Steve said. “How many men do you think?”
“You can call me Carol,” Carol said, tossing a smile at Rhodey as they marched into the ballroom, like they were ready to take on the world.
The envelope was addressed to Captain Rogers, but had no stamp, no street address or other identifying marks. Steve flipped it back and forth. “No sign of who dropped this off?”
Tony turned to see Rogers struck with wonder as he looked around Tony’s unpacked cabin and all his little projects he felt safe working on on the ship. Rogers looked closely at the telescope that Tony had pulled apart to redesign and then at the sextant.
"You ready?" Steve asks with that easy smile of his, hands holding Tony's shoulders. He's so calm, which helps steady Tony too.
“It’s a multiple shot, automated loading gun -- Stark Industries developed it after the war, in case we needed to fend off HYDRA again.”
Then a voice is projected from the hauler, "Unidentified aircraft. You are trespassing on AMC grounds and airspace. Move away or be shot down. This is your only warning."
Thor's laughing as he rushes out the penthouse doors to catch Mjolnir and take to the sky.
There are more haulers with turrets on the ground now, bullets raining around him. "I need to get the stealth settings improved in this suit. There must be something really important down there for them to be defending it so hard, Sheriff. Trucks are high tailing it out of there. See if you can get them. I really want whatever it is they have underground."
Wilson reported that two additional crates were found broken into. “Crates from the camp supplies hold,” he clarified to Rogers and Tony. They were meeting again in the ready room.
There's always so much familiarity and fondness for each other that Tony can only shake his head and smile at them. He can't wait to be in the middle of it now.
See, Steve, eventually, decides that he isn’t going to waste time pining anymore. Because you know what, he loves Tony, and he needs to try and take the plunge. Worst case scenario, he loses a friend – but Tony’s not like that. He’s still friends with Pepper Potts, who he dated for a long time before they broke up. Tony won’t throw away a friendship because one party’s romantic feelings aren’t requited.
“We stopped making those guns when I got out of the weapons business -- AIM must have stolen the plans from us.”
Steve moved his wrists back and forth. “The ties are fraying. But I don’t know what to do about the leg irons.”

“Wait, what are they pulling out of that crate?” Natasha asked. “The one with the Pym Corp stamps?”
“Right.”
Redwing bobbed her head, as if agreeing with Tony.
“Good idea.”
Inspired by the Stevetony fanfiction The Boundless Deep, by authors Captainshellhead and Vibraniumstark.
Tony looks at this universe's Steve again, noting the differences to his own. For one, this Steve is massive. Has shorter hair too. And according to Stark was infused with a serum which gives him superhuman strength, agility, and reflexes, as well as enhanced his above average intellect. And also, it seems everyone here is a superhero.
Stark grins, "Well, whatcha waiting for, alternate me? Suit up and let's go."
“We’re working on it,” Natasha.
~~~~~
Sam had worked out a list and plan for the survey so that they could work efficiently in gathering the information. He said it was to avoid lingering too long in an area where carnivorous dinosaurs were located.
“I’ve seen them at a distance.”
Rhodey threw up a hand. “Just looking out for you, Tones. You seem to have hit a dry spell since you came to New Timely.”
And then there was the whole debacle with choosing classes for the upcoming semester- I’ll summarize it by saying that they each tried to suggest classes to the other so they’d end up in the same ones, and then it turned out they each picked the ones the other suggested, and didn’t share a single one. And if that couldn’t rock the boat, you’d think they’d realize nothing could. A year and a half down the line, best bros for life, Steve and Tony started falling in love. Of course the dim-wits wouldn’t believe the other feels the same way. That brings us to the events about to unfold.
Curious about where Steve was going, Redwing bopped along, her feathers and scales rippling with the movement. Steve motioned for her to go into the forest. “Time for you to go free.”
A hollowed-out 3D map of said underground facility appears. It shows a total of five large rooms with several heat signatures indicating people. Using the same sonic waves to scan the area, one room shows structures that Tony cannot identify without directly seeing them for himself.
"Thanks, Cap."
“Yes -- intriguing talk by the Captain, by the way. I did not expect the lantern slides and illustrations. Is it true that Captain Rogers drew all those himself? That’s what people were saying at my table.”
“I wanted to clear the air about last night. Is there anything I should know you haven’t told me?”
“Miss Van Dyne -- it is a good time to start your concert since we could all use the diversion tonight from our travels,” Rogers continued.
Rogers nodded. “We didn’t locate any additional broken crates.”
Stark pouts but drags his feet over to Reed's side. "I was trying to play fairy godmother!"
Tony took a deep breath and put on his top hat, tapped his cane, and adjusted his coat as he and Rhodey stepped out into the street. The sidewalk cafes were filled with people and even some stores were open late in hopes of catching the attention of passersby. “We need to work on replacing gaslight with something more reliable,” Tony observed as Rhodey looked over the books on display in a bookstore window. “And less flammable.”
She squawked at Steve to pick her up. He knew that if he picked her up, he was taking her to the ship and home.
A steward announced that dinner was served in the adjoining room. The expedition members immediately left for the dining room.
Later that day, Tony received a short note from Rogers asking to meet him in the ship captain’s ready room.
Wilson lifted his eyes to the side as he thought. “I only remember customs stamps.”
“I will check if there’s any news. I have received word that we will be departing within the hour.”
Steve wiggled as he felt for a sharp rock. Tony had to look away, as unprompted thoughts about better places and uses for the wiggle show filled his brain.
Tony takes it. "Hi. You can tell us apart?"
Before Nakia left for Wakanda, Tony got the name of that restaurant where they had met T’Challa when they first came to the city. “I have plans,” he said to Steve mysteriously.
“Leaving us to drown -- that means that there would be plausible natural reasons for our deaths without the risk of it being traced back to AIM. If anyone found our bodies.”
Barton built a pen for Redwing near Steve’s tent with a secure protective cover to fend off predators. Redwing showed a distinct preference for her bed in Steve’s tent, to the point of digging up a fence post when she was placed in the pen for the first time. With a glint in his eye, Barton set to work again on a reinforced pen.
“Indeed. What are my choices?” Nakia replied, immediately latching on to Natasha. “Please show me.”
He had also decided that Rogers was not entirely dreadful and awful company. But Tony hadn’t reached a spot where he could easily tolerate the man. He was counting on the size of the team and their specific duties to limit their interactions. Otherwise the next six months would drag.
Steve rubbed his chin. “Fury asked me about going on an expedition to the Savage Land for the New Explorers’ Club today.”
Tony's never put his gear on faster.
Tony leaves Steve a note on his tip... ;3
Behind him, there was a stunning view of the city stretching down to the harbor. Once Tony was settled into his seat, T’Challa rattled off an order to a waiting man, likely a waiter. Tony didn’t know a single word of Xhosa so lunch was going to be a surprise. Then T’Challa dismissed everyone else from the room.
Tony drummed his fingers on the desk, stalling for time. He always looked forward to the Annual Dinner with buoyant enthusiasm. Food was always excellent, the company scintillating, and the after dinner talk compelling. But this year ….
It was getting hot and Steve unexpectedly stripped down to his undershirt. The thin fabric clung to every single muscle on Steve’s strong back. Tony nearly crushed Redwing’s ball in his hands until a squawking Redwing pecked his hand to drop it.
“He’s a very popular speaker, you are too, and the Annual Dinner is a fund raiser for the Club.” Pepper sighed. “I know Captain Rogers is not one of your favorite people, but you could do it for the club? Both of you together would be a major draw for the Dinner.”
Rogers had a fleeting pained look on his face. But he turned back to the window and whatever conversation he was having with Sam. Tony ignored the rising tension in the room as he joked with Bruce about his latest invention.
When Jarvis shows the pictures on the TV screen, Tony almost jumps up in his excitement. "That looks like the portal that got me here! I recognize the markings and the shape, though it's missing a few pieces."
Tony balled up his napkin and tossed on the table. “Who do I need to talk to to get you off the Air Ship hook?”
"Like regulated power on a closed circuit. So, the power source they were using was to nudge it but not to actually make it work--" Tony moves closer to inspect the writings on the portal. The humming grows louder and the unknown writing lights up. "I did not do that."
"I'm faster. Yes. I know," he finishes, cutting Steve off. He pushes the thrusters harder, forcing them to go faster, intent on surveying the whole area to get it over and done with so that they can leave. They landed the Avenger a few miles away and Steve promptly sent Sam on his flight rig to scope the other side of the outpost. "Fury could've sent you exact coordinates instead of sending us in blind--"
“That’s over for now.”
“What are you doing?”
“You’ve handled the specimens excellently,” Steve pointed out.
Steve had hope that they could work through the distance between him and Tony. He had been dead serious when he told Fury that he wanted Tony as his science officer. Tony was the ideal choice. Even if Steve still felt Tony’s lingering coldness towards him.
"You don't need to yell, Cap! We're all here!" Sam groans even as he gets up.
Tony laughs as they step out of the elevator, giddy with excitement. He can feel it thrumming in his belly. Steve's still not let him go. He wishes his Sheriff would hold onto him like this. As soon as they're in the penthouse, Steve puts an arm at the back of his waist and Tony can't help but lean against him. He's so solid. And strong. He wonders how strong his Sheriff is.
“This is an odd place to meet,” he said to Rogers. The room was small, set up for quick meetings and whatnot, and not designed for anyone’s comfort.

“Right.” Tony sidled around Rogers who stayed stuck in place looking past Tony to the stage.
Rogers gave Tony a studied look as he weighed what he was going to say. “We’re returning Redwing back to the Savage Land. That’s where Miss Maximoff thinks she came from.”
"Here you go, boys." Steve presents them with paper bags full of something that makes Tony’s mouth water from just the scent. "Want to find a place to sit or walk around while eating?"
“Staying in New Timely to manage my affairs and the company.”
"I'll miss you. Let us know when you want a visit. We'll get Reed to play interdimensional travel agent." Then he engulfs Tony in a bear hug that warms him inside out.
Hope spent the rest of her day telling the rest of the expedition members what she had been doing and that to make it up to them she and Lang would take on the cooking and cleaning duties for the next week or so.
"Will do. Thanks, Matt." Steve says. "We'll definitely check it out. I'll let you know what we find."
“Hey, sorry about that -- I thought you were kind of an entitled jerk for owning a dino.”
“Really? I thought it added something,” Tony replied airily.

“Hmmmm. We can talk about it more.” Sam fished out a letter from his coat pocket. “Someone slid this letter through the mail slot this afternoon.”
"We watched Men in Black." Stark tells him and Tony nods, understanding. He has a vague recollection of that movie. It might've been based on a true story in their universe. "Anyway, don't worry about it. I'll call Reed. We can visit him soon as he gives the go ahead."
Tony was staring at him expectantly, floating with the sea at eye level, so that only the top of his head was poking out of the water. He guessed Tony didn’t have to breath the same way humans did, but it was still strange to see him swimming so casually with his mouth and nose below the surface of the waves.
“This one has some hope. It doesn’t end like this for most of the dinosaurs.”
“You could be wrong on that,” Steve said.
“Ha! Got it!” Steve waved his now-free arms. He snatched up the rock and butt shuffled over to Tony.
“I was helping Hope,” she admitted. “We were looking for stolen items.”

“What’s this about, Captain?” Van Dyne asked.
Wilson exchanged a worried look with Rogers. “My gut tells me that the person who broke into this crate picked the crate at random.”
“Who told you about Lang?”
The specimens were crated up, the trash and debris burned, and the tents and other equipment neatly stowed away on the ship. Steve steeled himself for the final plan.
He waved her off. “I don’t need a pet. I just can’t see someone owning a brontosaurus for the long haul. The only place where dinosaurs are wild is the Savage Land. How did we get here from there?”
“He’s one of Captain Rogers’ friends. He’s lovely.”
And more arts!
“AIM needs the Pym collars to control the dinosaurs through electrical shocks. But why the vibranium?”

"True. Hulk and I don't want to be stuck in any sort of hell again." Bruce adds.
“They ship them in from the Savage Land,” Steve said.
“Oh.” She looked at the cards. “I didn’t think that when I made the seating arrangements. The Captain clearly prefers your company to mine.” She laughed a little. “You young folks and your technology.”
“About Redwing -- it’s her natural land -- so there are natural predators.”
The ship steamed back to the Port City Protectorate as fast as their steam engines could propel the ship and all its cargo. Steve was of course uneasy about the load of restless prisoners on board. But they made it safe and sound into the harbor, with no fight from the prisoners.

“I’m hearing air coming from over here,” Steve said encouragingly.
Tony froze for a second, as if he had expected Steve to act differently. He looked at the chair like Steve had offered him a seat in a lava pit. “Captain Rogers, I am leaving the expedition now as no one here is able to tell one iota of truth. I will pack up my belongings and will be leaving as soon as possible by any means necessary, even if that includes using magic. Dr. Banner can handle all of the science on his own.”
“Tony --”
“Anything else stick out?”
Tony follows Stark's lead, keeping up with the armor. Stark's might be flashier and faster, but Tony built his to be sturdy and have the firepower to take down spaceships. It doesn't look like much. He's got parts of him exposed, but full body shielding protects the unarmored parts of him.
Rogers smiled at him. “Still stung by the trivia contest?”
"Tony."
"It is not good at all. MODOK is here."
"It was a good date, beloved. Everyone had fun. Including the Hulk." Stark pats Steve's back in a 'there, there' gesture while trying to keep a straight face. Then he ruins it by adding, "Thunderball got Thor's hammer to the face. That was awesome! Do we still have footage of that fight, J?"
O1 is an Image Prompt from the comics...
They’re both cyborgs in this au, Steve’s body is still kind of functional without his cybernetics, but they allow him to be Captain America. Tony’s situation was a life-or-death type of thing, he made the reactor to power his heart, the rest of the plating allows him to move and function. I’m not sure what about the lower-arm addition that’s alarming tony. Maybe it’s new and he’s not happy about it?  maybe it's all new apart from the reactor? hmm.
“Maybe not,” Wilson said hopefully. “There could be a reasonable explanation here for the open crates.”
Her point was underscored by the faded poster of Steve from the Zeppelin War still plastered on an old warehouse wall. Sam arched an eyebrow at Steve, who pointedly ignored the poster. “Lead on,” Steve said.

“My presence is a secret here. Hence the security,” T’Challa explained.
“You want to go for a walk?”
"You do not take down, MODOK! MODOK is superior!" The giant head screeches again and fires a blast of red beam at him.
Except this local fauna had Gatling guns.
“I thought you had something in the works,” Rhodey replied.
“I overheard her talking to Wanda about using magic to track vibranium,” Tony said.
“All right. You sound like an Anti-Dinosaur crusader there, Tones. I wouldn’t be asking about a dino if my niece wouldn’t be a responsible pet owner. My family has had every pet under the sun from dogs and cats to birds and guinea pigs and lizards.”
(And with this, I'm close to a diagonal!) :L
“We are going to spend time in camp -- it’s not like you’d be hiding her there.”
One did not have to be an engineer to do any of that, Tony thought darkly as he picked apart the earlier interaction. Dr. Foster continued on about her latest discovery.
Steve found the hot air balloon and Tony as promised bodged together an engine and rudder system for the balloon. “Let’s go rescue our friends,” Tony said as he dropped anchor on the balloon.
“I gather you must be the artist on Captain Rogers’ team. Or Miss Romanoff. It’s not Barton.”
Tony heard the door rattle and looked down to see a dinosaur beak poking out of the crack. “Captain?”
“We can talk about dinosaurs, Wanda’s crusade …”
“Sure. But I think you’d want to talk to Natasha -- she’s been on alert for something the past couple of days. Hasn’t said anything, but you know what she’s like when she's working on something.”
Steve is already yelling. "Tony, get back!"
Tony wonders if Steve is doing it on purpose.
"Alternate universe, huh? Sometimes I forget how crazy your lives are," Matt says.
"Reed Richards. Stretchy dude? Kind of an asshole. Has an awesome wife named Sue? Not ringing any bells? Wow. Good for you!"
Fifteen minutes later, they were waiting in Steve’s office for Steve to get dressed and join them. Sam and Natasha filed in, followed by Barton. Steve emerged in shirtsleeves and plain blue waistcoat, with a day’s growth of beard, ready to go. “What’s going on?”
The science team was holding one of their science bonding activities that night after dinner. He had commandeered space in one of the ship holds for their nightly presentations and discussions. Tonight’s presenter, Dr. Foster, was giving an impromptu talk on astronomy and her own research. Thor, of course, was in attendance.
The sketch. Spoilery.
“A bit groggy. I heal quick.” One of the many special things about Steve from the Zeppelin War besides the enhanced strength. “Where are we?”
“Do you need to get all arty with the plant and animal photos?”
Rogers sighed. “I’ll see you later.”
Steve tucked the small dinosaur with the water-soaked rag inside his jacket to warm it up. “We’re good to go.”
The other thing he’d admit only under threat was that he found Steve to be an excellent artist by accident.
Lang and Van Dyne both said, “No.” Lang then added, “Now that you know about my past.”
“Gentlemen, thank you for joining me today.”
“Terrific, contact Pepper and we’ll get you set up with a job in no time.”
“Now imagine that moon, that sky, my country house, and just you and me,” Tony said as he put his arms around Steve’s waist, resting his cheek against Steve’s muscled shoulder.
The noise was loud enough to drown out Tony saying, “Oh, come on.”
“She’d drive you crazy and she wouldn’t go somewhere where she couldn’t fly.”
“Dammit,” Steve says, and then immediately regrets it, because the droop to Tony’s shoulders and the way he won’t meet his eyes anymore aren’t even necessary for Steve to know that his words have been taken the wrong way. He knows Tony, knows how he’d interpret that kind of response.
Tony slams a hand on the counter to keep himself from faceplanting with the force of Thor's slap across his back. "Hey, Thor."
“Fury hid it well.”
“Let’s not talk about Stane.” Tony involuntarily shuddered at the name. “Don’t get into any trouble while I’m gone.”
Captain Steve Rogers, Grand Army of the Republic (retired), sat down to read the morning paper and eat his breakfast. He looked over the edge of the page at the coffee machine bubbling away merrily on the counter. Sam likely turned on the wondrous machine just before Steve came in.
All that changed when assassins came to kill Steve, the town's upstanding Sheriff and Tony's drinking buddy. Well, more like Tony drank and serenaded the man, while Steve painstakingly dragged his ass home when he was too drunk to do it himself.
“I’ll be sure to ask -- good to see you, Tony,” Bruce said, shaking Tony’s hand again.
“Nakia confirmed that the crates were specifically from Wakanda -- the customs stamps covered most of them. But if you knew what you were looking for, you could still see them.”
Tony turned pale. “That’s the trademark of the AIM corporation.”
Tony slouched a little and sighed. “Why didn’t you trust me with the information?”
Outside in the hallway, Rogers asked, “We should meet to talk about the expedition. When we will leave, the objectives, and other arrangements.”
“They’ve asked if you’ll be coming, Tony,” Pepper said. “We need to say something.”
“It couldn’t hurt to meet this Miss Maximoff.”
“Naturally.”
“I see that my wife has whimsically decided to sit us next to each other. In case she is not sufficiently entertained by the evening’s program.”
His eyes adjusted to the darker interior of the cave. He could see that Steve was nearby, also tied up and in leg irons. “Steve? Are you awake?”
(edit: the square actually says genderswap, not genderbend. adjusted the title/explanation accordingly!)
“Avoidance is the better part of valor.”
“I’ll keep my eye out.”
Early morning Tony is a coffee zombie and Steve thinks he’s adorable - the moment is priceless for him, every moment with his family and tony is, tbh, he’s living in the now and loving his ridiculous boyfriend.
He smiles back. "As I'll ever be, Cap."
Steve grins, holding him close, arms around his waist like he never wants to let go. "I can do that."
“Indeed. May we go now?”
Tony had long resisted returning to the city of his birth and family honors. His memories of New Timely were tied up in the less-than-pleasant remembrances of his father and those last years before his death. Naturally a man of boundless inventiveness, imagination, and intelligence, Tony felt constricted by the obligations of the family business and honors given by a grateful government. But the New Explorers’ Club and his science friends had lured him back to the city a few years ago. That, and wanting to leave the betrayals of his father’s business partner back in the west and in the past.
Steve felt a deep warmth within his bones for the first time in a long, long time. Tony looked after him attentively, making sure that food and drink were all at hand and that Steve wasn’t standing in a draft or stuck in a corner. It felt nice, being looked after, being part of the crowd, knowing he wasn’t being left behind, nor needing to make any plans for tomorrow.
“Only found out it was a thing before I left on this expedition,” Tony admitted. He was unsettled by Rogers’ easy admission.
Tony still couldn’t get past the fact that the king of the fuddy-duddies had issued actual rules, posted in prominent spaces in the camp, such as the dining and kitchen tent as well as outside Rogers’ office. Although, Tony had to admit that the rules had helped out with camp space when he had to settle disagreements between Jane and Bruce over tent lab space. Though he’d only admit that under threat of pain of death.
“I’m wondering why we weren’t interrogated,” Steve said.
"Is your Steve with someone else?" It's Steve who asks this time.
They stood watching the moon, then the band played a slow song. “Can I have this dance?” Tony asked, as he stepped away from Steve and held out his hand.
They find a bench in Central Park where they pass the time trading stories and enjoying the food. Tony can't help but notice how Steve and Stark can't seem to keep their hands off each other. Not in any sort of sexual way, but in what Bruce had said, casual PDA. It looks so easy, and yet, from what he’s learned since he arrived here, this easy affection was hard fought to achieve. His Sheriff is so much more reserved that seeing this Steve so open is jarring.
And lastly, from this past year I believe? a sketch page featuring another go (from memory, so it's not exact) at the scene in chapter 15
Matt cocks his head again, listening. "I gotta go. Client's waiting. Nice to meet you, Tony." Then he turns to Steve and Stark, "Seriously, leave room for Jesus."

Right. Tried to blow up an AIM base, got caught and knocked out.
Tony slipped his hand into Steve’s and leaned over to say, “I hear that there’s a big full moon in the sky tonight. You want to go see?”
Tony took a deep breath. “Then we tell people that Bruce forgot something and opened the crate to retrieve it. People will believe that story until we find out more information.”
“How did you know?” Steve replied. He took the drink gratefully from Tony.
"Tony."
They slowed down as they reached the edge of the AIM camp. “It’s deserted, Tony,” Steve said.
“That can’t be legal or good for the dinosaurs,” Tony muttered. He flicked his fingers, thinking of all that could go wrong. “While I’m gone, keep track of that brontosaur, make sure it’s taken care of and find a home when it needs one.”
