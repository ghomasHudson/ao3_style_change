The air was even colder now that they were moving at a more rapid pace, but pressed together in the back of the carriage, neither felt uncomfortable, temperature or otherwise. Tucked up against Sherlock, beneath a warm blanket, John felt like he could stay here forever, just enjoying the holiday atmosphere and the smell of Sherlock, a mixture of lab chemicals and expensive cologne.
John finished his eggs he went off to take a shower and get ready for his day. When he emerged from the bathroom, clean shaven and smelling of his and Sherlock’s now shared shampoo, Sherlock had migrated from the kitchen to the living room, but was still hidden behind his paper. John sat down in his chair and opened his laptop, but had barely begun typing when his phone buzzed.
“Well, if we aren’t going anywhere today I’m going back to bed.” Sherlock said standing abruptly from his chair and going back to the bedroom. A few moments later John heard him flop into bed. He puttered around for a few minutes, making coffee and breakfast. But when, midway through his toast, he yawned and felt his eyelids begin to droop, he decided to join Sherlock and get some extra sleep.
Sherlock cleaned up the flour from rolling out the dough and John made the icing while they waited for the cookies to bake. When the timer dinged Sherlock pulled the cookies out and set them on the cooling rack while John separated the icing into smaller bowls and began dripping food coloring into them. When Sherlock saw what he was doing he came over and raised a critical eyebrow at John’s handiwork. “Here, let me do that,” he said, taking the bottle of red dye from John’s hand, and somehow, with his scientific exactness, made a set of brighter icings than John ever could have.
“Do your joints or muscles feel achy?” he asked, trying to establish if was just a cold, or something worse.
Mrs. Hudson put her hands on her hip and John kicked him under the table. “Sherlock Holmes, I am not you housekeeper or your mother,” she said, rightfully in a huff and turned, giving one last smile to John before turning to leave. Sherlock glanced up from his coffee to meet John’s disapproving eyes.
They were in an airy, light filled café, the walls painted a shade of robin’s egg blue. The hostess appeared, and smiled at them. “Just the two of you today?” she asked. They nodded and she smiled. “alright, follow me,” she said. She led them to a table by the large bay windows and placed menus at each of the table settings.
“Mrs. Hudson,” said Sherlock, “this may be the ugliest sweater I’ve ever seen, but it’s also the kindest and most thoughtful gift I’ve ever received.” John bit the inside of his cheek, even more unsure how to react to this.
That was all it took for Sherlock to jump out of his chair and start talking animatedly about the theories he had formed just from reading the paper alone. Lestrade raised his eyebrows and looked past Sherlock at John. John shrugged as if to say “what did you expect?”
Once John was changed he turned off the light and climbed into bed next to Sherlock, relieved to finally be back in their room, instead of his dark dusty one upstairs. They burrowed under the covers, Sherlock still fully clothed, and settled in for the night, both of their heads already drooping. John breathed in the smell of Sherlock, blissfully glad to be this close to him again. After a moment he nestled his head against Sherlock’s chest and fell asleep.
As he eased himself from the cramped corner he’d been standing in behind the tree back around to where Sherlock was Sherlock stepped back to assess his own handiwork. John went to stand next to him and leaned his head against Sherlock’s shoulder. “Looks nice,” he said.
“No,” said Sherlock stonily, “I am not. I would prefer to never come here again, too much cheer.” He said the last part with a playful glint in his eye.
“How did you-? I’ve been fiddling with that damn thing for twenty minutes.” Sherlock shrugged again and they watched the coffee slowly fill the pot, before pouring it into their own mugs.
“It’s adorable, thank you,” Molly said, smiling at him. “It is my turn?” They nodded and she handed a package to Mrs. Hudson.
“Probably not,” Sherlock said. John nodded again, knowing he was right, and moved on to another dish. They worked quietly for a few minutes before John heard Sherlock give a small gasp of amazement. “John, look at how this liver-“
John laughed at his annoyed confusion and pulled the cookbook across the counter over from Sherlock who was glaring at it darkly. He leaned over the book, read the first step and pushed the sugar and butter at Sherlock. “Beat these together with that,” he said indicating to the stand mixer Mrs. Hudson had lent them. Sherlock obeyed and carefully measured out the two ingredients out into the bowl, his scientific precision shining through.
Covent Garden was twinkling in the soft evening light. The Christmas lights had begun flickering on and the street was lit up with a golden glow. Sherlock and John walked along the street, surrounded by excited tourists, all swiveling their heads every which way to catch a glimpse of everything that London had to offer. John found them adorable, Sherlock found them annoying. They had just finished having dinner and seeing a movie, and were on their way back to Baker Street. “Good god, they’re everywhere,” said Sherlock, looking pointedly at the tourists.
This was so uncharacteristically emotionally articulate of Sherlock that John almost pulled away to look him in the eyes and make sure it was the same man he had kissed for the first time two months ago. “Yes, you make me very happy,” he said, knowing that was what Sherlock was really asking. “I just want to get as much happiness from you as I can, for as long all you’ll let me.”
“You have more power than you think Mrs. Hudson,” John said, placing his hand on the doorknob and pulling open the door, “and just tell him he’ll have Dr. Watson to answer to if he tries anything.” Mrs. Hudson laughed and John left, walking to the nearby pharmacy.
“Well, you know. Connected. In sync with each other. People always think you’re a couple anyway.” This, John had to admit, was true. “I’d have thought you two would get together sooner honestly,” Lestrade continued. John shrugged and continued examining the ground.
“Great, that’ll be just a few minutes,” said the girl. They payed and went to find a table. Picking a seat by the window Sherlock angled himself so that he was facing towards the street and was turned almost entirely away from the rest of the cafe.
“Yeah,” John called over his shoulder. Sherlock went into the kitchen to check on his experiments and John settled into his chair and opened his computer. He started typing away at yet another blog post and after a few minutes Sherlock came up behind him, gave him a kiss on the cheek, handed him a mug of tea, and sat down in his chair across from John. He picked up a book and began flipping through it and they settled once again into the quiet enjoyment of each other’s company. Just like the morning, the afternoon slipped by, the hours slowly dragging their feet as they marched by.
“I don’t mind going first,” John said. Everyone nodded and John held out his gift. “This is for you,” he said to Molly. Molly smiled and took the gift. Sherlock nodded as if he had expected that.
He began responding to them as Sherlock drained the last of his hot chocolate and picked up his violin. He began to play, looking down at the street from the window as he did so. It was to the sound of Sherlock’s playing that John spent the next few hours, sunken into his chair and working on his blog. The sound of violin music and computer keys filled 221B Baker Street for the rest of the afternoon and into the night as John and Sherlock spent time both together and in their own private worlds.
“I’m afraid that I, for once, am on my brother’s side. I have no desire to participate in your secret Santa.” John let out an exasperated breath.
“It’s fine,” John said at the same time that Sherlock muttered under his breath about punctuality. “You’re not one to talk,” John said, looking up at Sherlock. Sherlock frowned and Greg went to stand next to Mycroft, who gave him a quick kiss on the cheek. “So, should we do secret Santa now or later?” John asked.
“Let’s just lay here for a while,” John murmured shifting his shoulders so that he was pressed closer to Sherlock. Sherlock nodded in agreement and they both sighed, letting their breaths become synchronized as they laid together, relaxing in the other’s warmth. John felt Sherlock drifting off again, and he closed his eyes as well, happy to spend his Christmas napping in Sherlock’s arms. Just before he fell asleep he heard Sherlock whisper something in his ear. “Hm, what?” he said quietly.
“For here,” “To go,” said John and Sherlock at the same time. The girl behind the counter raised her eyebrows. Sherlock glared at them both. “Fine, for here.”
“It’ll make you’re throat feel better,” said John, standing and taking their empty oatmeal bowls to the sink. He pulled out the salt and a glass while Sherlock crossed his arms and pouted in protest. After filling the glass with water from the tap and measuring out the salt, he poured the salt into the water, stirring and watching it dissolve before handing it to Sherlock who took it reluctantly.
“I’m going to take this as an offer to carry me around everywhere from now on,” John told him. Sherlock smiled, totally fine with the prospect of carry John from place to place. His strong arms circled John’s waist as he mounted the first step and began carrying John, laughing, up the stairs.
“How does it bring people together? If anything, all of the holiday commercialism is tearing us apart. I’m America they’ve started shooting each other over half priced video game consuls.”
Sherlock nodded. “Me too,” he said quietly. John raised his eyebrows in surprise and gave Sherlock’s hand a quick squeeze. The truth was, he didn’t really spend much time thinking about the future or how he wanted to live his life when he was old. And he didn’t think Sherlock was the sort to think about that a lot either. But since he’d gotten together with Sherlock he had found a life that he wanted to keep. It felt like a precious gem, or a fragile child, that he was cradling in his hand, desperate not to drop it or let it go. Instead he wanted to hold on forever, making sure that it never got hurt.
The cabbie nodded and pulled out onto the street, driving them into the busy shopping area. By the time they stepped out of the cab onto the street, which was bustling with tourists and last minute present buyers, the sun had fully set and the temperature had dropped with it. John shoved his hands deep into his pockets and shivered.
Sherlock shrugged and picked up the book he had abandoned when John had gotten home. Sinking deeper into his chair, he opened his book and settled in to read. John followed suit and opened his laptop to work on a blog post. It was in each other’s quiet company that the two of them spent the next few hours, silently enjoying the presence of their other half.
John shook his head at Sherlock’s logic, but continued eating his Chicken Parmesan without arguing. “Speaking of nice,” he said after a moment, “I was thinking, it would be nice if we hosted a little Christmas party, like we did a few years ago. You know, with Molly and Mycroft and everyone. We could exchange our secret Santas then.”
“John I’m bored,” was how Sherlock greeted John as he entered 221b Baker Street, arms laden with groceries. Sherlock was stretched across the coach, feet dangling over the arm rest and his dressing gown spilling beneath him and pooling onto the floor. He was tossing a hot pink rubber ball against the wall across the apartment and catching it when it bounced back. As John stepped into the flat Sherlock turned the ball in his direction and it hit the doorjamb dangerously close to John’s head.
“It’s literally just butter and sugar,” John said, “I can’t believe you just-“  but he was cut off by Sherlock, who suddenly swept over and grabbed John by the waist, pulling him into a kiss. John leaned in and tilted his head, disgust melting away slightly as their mouths opened and John tasted the sugar on Sherlock’s lips transfer to his. He felt the sweet granulated morsels dissolving on his tongue and resisted the urge to moan in pleasure. He felt Sherlock smile against his lips at his obvious enjoyment. “You are the worst,” John muttered when he pulled away. But it was with a tiny grin that he pushed the flour, baking soda, and salt toward Sherlock and instructed him to sift them together in a separate bowl.
John woke up on Christmas morning with Sherlock sleeping soundly next to him. He was breathing softly, his quiet inhales and exhales lulling John into a dreamy state of half-awake reverie. He laid like that, staring at the ceiling with his side pressed against Sherlock’s, as the sun slowly rose outside the window and filled the room with morning light. It seemed to illuminate everything with a dim golden glow that added to John’s sense of being inside a dream.
“Come on, Sherlock,” John said, tugging the on his sleeve. Sherlock sighed and gave Mrs. Hudson a final look.
Sherlock let out an annoyed huff of breath, “well you made me buy those stupid holiday cookie cutters, so we might as well do the shapes option. I didn’t realize we were going to have to wait two hours for our cookies though.”
“Um, yeah,” said John, “at least if you want shapes. If you’re fine with just circles it doesn’t have to be refrigerated.”
The horses took off, and with a slight jolt, the ride began. They gazed out together at the strings of lights and passing people, all bundled up in their warm winter coats talking on cell phones or with each other. The strings of lights all stood out golden and glowing against the sky now that the sun had fully set. Trees became invisible against the black night air and the lights wrapped around them looked like clusters of floating stars.
“Yes, as a matter of fact I do,” Mycroft said primly. Sherlock nodded and made a sound of self satisfaction.
“God, Sherlock,” John rubbed to tips of his fingers against his temples, “I love you, but sometimes I just really want to-“ he raised his hands and made a motion like he was strangling someone.
John began making eggs and Sherlock put the kettle on. Once the kettle was heating up he stood behind John, who was at the stove, and slid his arms around his waist, patiently waiting for his eggs to be made, with his chin resting atop John’s head.
“Oh,” said Sherlock, putting his head back down on the pillow they were sharing, “my mother used to play this song all the time.”
“Lord help us all,” Sherlock muttered. John, who was standing next to him, reached out and smacked him lightly on the back of the head.
“Screw the nice list,” Sherlock said, pushing John onto the bed and kicking the bedroom door shut behind him.
Sherlock mirrored his position and placed a hand on the railing, albeit with a much tighter grip. John saw his white knuckles and looked up at Sherlock, caught between amusement and sympathy. “Ok,” he instructed, “move your feet like this,” he demonstrated and, sliding his hand along the railing, pushed forward a little. He looked over his shoulder and watched as Sherlock followed. Seeing that he seemed to have it right, John turned back around and skated forward a little further, but felt Sherlock’s hand grab his shoulder only a second later. He turned around to find Sherlock very close to him, one hand still on the railing and the other gripping his shoulder.
John felt a warm glow in his ribcage when Sherlock said that. “Yes well, we can’t have both of us laid up in bed, now can we?”
“What the…?” John looked at Sherlock, who hadn’t taken his eyes off the mistletoe. Sherlock squinted and tilted his head, examining the mistletoe and doorframe from a distance. John could see him taking in every detail of the scene with a sharp, analytic eye.
“Ah, yes,” he said calmly, as if he had just remembered where he had left his keys, rather than whether or not something was on fire. He closed his book and stood, looking across the room at John and smiling. John, who was significantly less relaxed about this situation, looked around the flat, trying to figure out where the burning smell was coming from. He stepped from his place in the doorway into the living room, turning back and forth, looking for a source of the scent.
“Do you want to join us on our walk back to Baker Street?” John asked Mrs. Hudson as they headed down the elevator.
She bustled through the door after Mycroft and smiled at everyone. “Hello, happy Christmas,” she said. There was a chorus of happy Christmases in return and John went to get Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson drinks. “I see you’re both wearing your sweaters,” she said when John handed her a glass. John and Sherlock exchanged a look. They had both donned the sweaters she’d made them for the party.
When John looked out the window Monday morning, he was in for a big surprise. Overnight several inches of snow had been dumped over London. Outside the world was covered in a blanket of white. “Sherlock, come look at this,” he called. Sherlock meandered over slowly, coffee cup in hand, from his place in the kitchen.
John smiled apologetically before paying the cab driver and joining Sherlock by the body. It was a middle-aged woman laying facedown in a snowbank, glittering shards of broken window scattered around her. John stood next to Sherlock and as he bent down John took a deep sniff. “Did you use my shampoo?”
“I promised I watched at least four separate YouTube tutorials after you suggested this,” Sherlock said, “but apparently the internet cannot solve every problem.”
When they’d first gotten together and Sherlock had shyly evaded holding John’s hand John had been disappointed but hadn’t fought it. He’d been surprised that Sherlock, who was usually unabashed about everything, preferred not to show public displays of affection, but understood where he was coming from and respected Sherlock’s decision.
Surveying their work, Sherlock picked up an astonishingly detailed snowflake, and John followed suit. They each took a bite and sighed in unison, savoring the taste of the sugar, not for the first time that day. They shared a smile and sat at their table, surrounded by cookies and scientific equipment. John gazed at Sherlock and Sherlock, catching him looking, leaned over and kissed his forehead before continuing his cookie. John leaned against his shoulder and ate his own cookie, enjoying the silent company of the person he loved most.
“Ok, first of all, I will be teasing you about this until the end of time. Second of all, Frozen is not a Christmas movie.”
Eventually John broke away, leaning his forehead against Sherlock’s shoulder. “We really do need to get our groceries,” he said.
But now that Sherlock had assimilated to being with him, romantically and publicly, John had no plans on refusing when Sherlock reached out and grabbed his hand. He was all too happy to walk hand in hand down the street with his boyfriend.
“I know, that’s the point,” said John, wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s shoulders, “maybe now you’ll listen to me.” He kissed Sherlock’s smooth, cool cheek and pressed his nose to his temple.
“Would you two stop being such grumpy arseholes and partake in this please?” Molly beamed at him and the two Holmes wore matching scowls. “I mean come on, it’s not that difficult. Very little of your precious brainpower will get used up.” Mycroft still looked unenthused but Sherlock looked up from the toes he had been inspecting and sighed.
She was turning her head rapidly to look between Mycroft and Sherlock, he ponytail swinging back and forth. “What? Who?” He voice sounded slightly hoarse.
Sherlock grinned. “Yes you are,” he said, reaching for John. John wriggled away and ran into the living room, where he curled up in his chair.
“I, um, I started writing this when, when I first,” Sherlock paused, his hands clasped nervously before him, “when I first realized I loved you.” John’s heart, which had been hovering with anxious anticipation in his chest, dropped with a sudden and resounding thump, before exploding back to life. They’d never said this out loud before. John had thought it over and over again, I love you, I love you, I love you, but he’d never plucked up the courage to say it aloud. And now here Sherlock was, standing in front of him, eyes scanning John’s face in fear, looking for any tiny negative reaction that he may have.
“Well, how long has this been going on?” she asked, indicating between them with her finger. John and Sherlock stared at her wearing matching expressions of embarrassment, dismay, and a touch of relief that they didn’t have to sit her down and explain everything. “Well, how long?” she insisted after several seconds of silence.
“Mhm, here,” Sherlock leaned forward and kissed him. John, surprised by the unexpected kiss, backed into the wall across from the coat rack. “Feel better now?” Sherlock asked. John rolled his eyes and handed Sherlock his hot chocolate so he could take off his coat. They headed upstairs after Sherlock had hung up his own coat. When they stepped into their flat Sherlock immediately flopped into his chair, nearly spilling his hot chocolate as he dramatically tipped his head backwards.
“Well someone apparently cannot walk, they need horse drawn carriages to take them home and their boyfriend to carry them,” John rolled his eyes at Sherlock’s quip about the carriage ride, “So I’m just doing my duty as your boyfriend and carrying you up the stairs.” He adjusted John into a more comfortable position on his shoulder. John had not asked to be carried, but now that he was in Sherlock’s arms he wasn’t complaining.
John leaned down and packed a ball of snow in his hands. “What are you doing?” said Sherlock, “I only agreed to make a snowman, I did not agree to a snowball fight.”
“Actually,” said John, pointing at Sherlock, “that’s really good advice. Yeah, do that. Get him something involving pumpkins, or you two’s version of pumpkins.”
Lestrade stepped back into the restaurant and began explaining what had happened to the boy. Sherlock and John took this as their cue to leave and pushed out of the restaurant, back onto the street, Sherlock with his unbuttoned coat flapping in the breeze.
“Christ this is disgusting,” he said, scrubbing at a particularly obstinate spot. When he found the cleanliness of the counter satisfactory he tossed the kitchen towel into then rubbish bin and pulled out the cookbook they had found stashed in an upper cupboard. Sherlock flipped it open to the page with a recipe for sugar cookies and began directing John, telling him what ingredients to get out. “Why do I have to do all the work,” John grumbled as he pulled out the flour from a high cabinet. “You’re the tall one anyway.”
“You don’t need your chemistry set, you need to rest,” said John, feeling his forehead to see if his fever had changed. “Feeling any better?” he asked.
“Is something burning?” John said. He was standing in the doorway to their flat, having just returned from work. He had stopped and inhaled deeply when he realized that the smell of smoke was lingering in the air. “Sherlock, is something burning?” he repeated. Sherlock looked up from his book and squinted slightly, eyes moving back and forth as if he was searching the inside of his brain for something.
They left the carriage behind and continued on their way back home, only a few minutes walk away from their flat by the time the ride had ended. They walked the last stretch of road and arrived back at 221B Baker Street. When they stepped inside they took off their coats and hung them on the pegs by the door, but before John could start up the stairs Sherlock picked him up and slung him over his shoulder. “Sherlock, what the hell are you doing?” John said, almost loud enough to be shouting. His heart was pounding so hard in shock that John thought, not for the first time that night, that it might burst. He was caught between beating Sherlock’s back with his fists and laughing deliriously, and he ended up doing both.
“Great you’re all here. Come in please.” She led them into the morgue, where there was a cadaver stretched across a metal table. “Sherlock, you can get started whenever,” she said, gesturing to the body, “and Mycroft, I’m not really sure why you requested to be here, but you’re welcome to... um... help?”
He blew past John, who followed, calmly trotting downstairs in Sherlock’s wake. Sherlock was impatiently knocking on Mrs. Hudson’s door when John caught up with him. They stood in silence for a moment before Mrs. Hudson opened the door to her apartment. “Did you put mistletoe in our doorway?” Sherlock asked before Mrs. Hudson could say anything.
When their meal came they ate it quickly, not wanting to be late, and left, walking to the cinema a few blocks away. Sherlock had insisted on buying tickets ahead of time so they wouldn’t have to stand in the queues, but John wanted popcorn, so they ended up waiting anyways. Sherlock tugged impatiently at John’s sleeve the entire time. “Good lord you are impatient,” John said, batting his hand away, then immediately wishing it was touching him again.
John opened his mouth, maybe in shock, maybe to answer, but before he could say anything the waiter appeared with their food. He set a plate of Fettuccine Alfredo in front of Sherlock and Chicken Parmesan in front of John.  “Anything else I can get you?” he asked. John shook his head, his nervous eyes never leaving Sherlock’s mischievous ones.
As soon as Sherlock finished playing the final note John was crashing into him. He couldn’t even remember rising from his chair, but suddenly his hands were on the sides of Sherlock’s face and he was kissing him, telling him not to be afraid. When John pulled back, gasping for air, Sherlock smiled and John pressed their foreheads together. “I love you,” he said. “I love you, I love you, I love you.” He would have continued, saying it over and over, had Sherlock not taken his own face in his hands and kissed him deeply. John leaned forward, almost collapsing into Sherlock, and Sherlock guided them into his chair, his lips never leaving John’s.
John felt slightly dazed as he unbutton the first few buttons of Sherlock shirt and kissed across his delicate collarbone. They’d done this before, but it had been different, Sherlock hadn’t been as natural and eager. He hadn’t been nervous exactly, but it was clear that he didn’t have much experience and he fumbled a bit, as people often did during their first times. But now Sherlock was smooth and instinctive, his hands traveling exactly where John wanted them to.
“Sherlock,” John whispered as they made their way from the front door to the bedroom, “I thought we were on the nice list.”
Mycroft started to leave, but before he was fully out the door Sherlock called out “say hi to Greg for me.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow at him, “when have I ever done something I don't feel like doing. Besides, I’m not a fan of snow, I don’t want to go out in this weather.”
Sherlock cleared his throat and Molly look at him. “I apologize if we were insensitive Molly, I didn’t mean to hurt you feelings.”
Both John and Sherlock launched into their explanations at the same time, their sentences getting mixed into a jumble of “were going to tell you,” and “there was a dinner planned,” and “he chickened out.”
For a moment the room was completely silent then Mrs. Hudson burst out laughing. “Well finally,” she said, “you two took so long to get together I thought I’d be six feet under by the time it finally happened.” Slowly Sherlock’s face reappeared from where he had hidden it behind his knees and John’s regained its normal coloring. Looking at their expressions of disbelief Mrs. Hudson sighed. “You two, I can’t believe you. How am I more in tune with your feelings than you are? Honestly. You’ve been pining over each other so long I was about ready to lock you two in the broom closet and letting you figure it out that way.” Both John and Sherlock blushed deeply at this.
A couple hours had passed and John heard Sherlock shuffling around and bit, but mostly the flat was quite. Eventually he got up to check on Sherlock. When he walked in he saw that Sherlock had thrown the newspaper aside and was tossing his pink ball against the wall across from him. “I’m bored John,” Sherlock said, catching the ball when it bounced back and dropping it into his lap.
“Yeah, come over,” was John’s typed replied. He set his phone down and nudged Sherlock with his foot. “Lestrade will be here in a little while,” he said.
Sherlock nodded and tilted his head so that his cheek rested on the top of John’s hair. They stood like that for a while, John gazing at the tree in smiling contentment and Sherlock looking at it with a contemplative frown. John knew Sherlock’s mind was entirely elsewhere, but he couldn’t help think about how many moments they’d spent like this, only a few feet apart instead of tucked together as they were now. “We wanted so much time,” he whispered, “we could have been like this from the very beginning.”
Sherlock himself was also gazing out the window, but John knew his mind was entirely elsewhere. When they pulled up outside the crime scene Sherlock was out of the door before the car had even stopped, leaving John to pay the cabbie and chase after him.
Settling into the chair he and Sherlock both took up their spoons to have their meal. They ate quietly and when John finished he looked up to see Sherlock’s eyes drooping. He got up and took the bowl from Sherlock. Taking the bowls back to the kitchen, he rinsed them off in the sink. When he came back, Sherlock had nodded off to sleep and John resisted the urge to lean down and kiss him on the cheek. Instead he gathered up the collection of cups and mugs that had accumulated on Sherlock’s bedside table, shut off the bedroom light, and left Sherlock to rest and regain his strength.
Ten minutes later they were on the street, Sherlock with half eaten toast in hand. He hailed a cab with his free hand and slid into the back seat. John climbed in next to him and leaned forward to give the driver directions. When they arrived fifteen minutes later at the scene of the crime Lestrade and Anderson are waiting for them. As Sherlock gots out of the cab Anderson stepped forward and opened  his mouth to breif him on the case, but before he could get a word out Sherlock had brushed by him. “Yes, I know, shut up,” he said.
Lines appeared on Sherlock’s forehead and he looked muddled, like he was trying to recalibrate his brain after sleeping and remember what day it was. “Yes, yes,” he said groggily, “S’ Christmas. Merry Christmas. Coffee.” He tossed the blankets down to the end of the bed, uncovering John in the process, and got up without another word, walking into the kitchen to make coffee. John followed him a minute later and found Sherlock standing, barefoot and swathed in a maroon dressing gown, before their irritable coffee machine.
“Yes, yes, you’re right,” he said, shoulders drooping in annoyance and disappointment. John ruffled his hair sympathetically and got out the oatmeal to start making breakfast. Sherlock stayed on his stool and watched him, casting longing glances between him and his microscope, not sure which he missed more. Not getting to use his microscope and not getting to kiss his boyfriend were his two greatest nightmares.
Sherlock raised his eyebrows and closed the curtains, walking back to the kitchen. “If you say so,” he said, plopping down into a chair across from John and propping one elbow on the table, placing his chin in his hand.
“Because,” Sherlock leaned forward and whispered something in the kid’s ear. John watched the boy’s face go white as a sheet and when Sherlock leaned back he pointed numbly to a door at the back of the shop and looked nervously at John. John furrowed his brows and watched Sherlock push through the door, leaving him and the kid in silence. After a few minutes the kid dropped a paper plate of chips in front of John.
“Oh no, I think you’d prefer to open them right away,” she replied. John furrowed his brow, more confused than ever, and lifted the lid off his box. Sherlock followed suit and they pulled aside their tissue paper in unison. Together they pulled out their respective sweaters and held them up to appraise. After a moment of gazing in disbelief John let his sweater collapse into his lap, but Sherlock continued inspecting his, holding it up to the light to examine the stitches.
“It’s Christmas,” he said, “the paper doesn’t come out on Christmas. Without looking up from the table Sherlock took a sip of his coffee and asked Mrs. Hudson to get him a piece of toast.
John shook his head. “Don’t exaggerate your well-being so you can get back to work sooner,” he said, pointing his fork at Sherlock, “no one recovers from the flu that fast. Though you do seem to be healing remarkably quickly.”
He felt like he was in a cocoon, a small pocket of warm safety, hidden away from the stormy word outside. Mrs. Hudson had the radio on downstairs, playing the old music John’s mother used to play and it, along with the smell of the bread she was baking, drifted upstairs to John and added to his sense of security, reminding him of home. It was the smell of bread that ended up waking Sherlock as well, who lifted his head suddenly but groggily and took a deep breath, saying “is that bread?”
Sherlock took a deep breath, as if testing out his newly weakened lungs. “How do you think John?” he asked. “Like death,” he threw a melodramatic hand over his brow. John shook his head, too concerned to be truly annoyed, but not surprised that illness seemed to enhance Sherlock’s already dramatic nature. He frowned, sitting down beside Sherlock on the bed.
And thats the end! A huge huge thank you to everyone who’s read, particularly those who’ve who’ve stuck around with me all month and/or commented and left kudos, y’all are the best <3
“Sherlock that is cheating, you have to look at the Christmas stuff,” said John sliding into the chair across from him. Sherlock reluctantly swiveled to face him and the rest of the terrible Christmas decor. John stifled a laugh at Sherlock’s grumpy expression. “I know, this stuff is really horrible,” he said, pushing the fake snowman at Sherlock.
“Right, of course,” Sherlock walked towards the door, “We’ll see you after that?” He pulled open the door for John as Molly nodded. “Excellent, goodbye,” he said and followed John out into the hallway.
John turned to face Sherlock, who slept peacefully beside him. John could see his eyes flickering behind his eyelids as he dreamt, but otherwise he was entirely still, he chest barely rising and falling with his breath. The early morning light and the shadows that remained from the night before played off the curves and lines of his face, making him look almost like a fairy tale character. John resisted the urge to kiss him and wake him from his slumber.
When John and Sherlock walked into St. Bartholomew's Hospital Thursday afternoon they were greeted by Mycroft, who was leaning against his umbrella.“So, you two are in a relationship now?” he asked and studied them with narrowed eyes.
“It will, it kills the bacteria,” John said, and, feeling bad, walked over to give Sherlock a kiss on the forehead, bacteria be damned. Sherlock leaned against him for a moment before pulling back.
“Sherlock and I were thinking of hosting a Christmas party at our place,” John said, “we were thinking the 22nd? At 8? Does that work for everyone?” Mrs. Hudson and Molly both nodded and Mycroft and Lestrade pulled out their phones to check their calendars. They both nodded as well, verifying that they could make it.
“And can it go back to Antarctica please?” Sherlock muttered. He leaned over and gave the coffee pot a firm slap, which caused a weak stream of coffee to appear.
Sherlock ran the tip of his tongue across John’s bottom lip before placing it gently between his teeth. When John didn’t pull away he bit harder, causing John to squirm, a small laugh escaping his lips. Sherlock smiled, his mouth never leaving John’s. He slid his hands beneath John’s coat and dug his fingers into John’s back, pulling him closer.
“To get some chips,” Sherlock said, “I need to think.” They walked for some time, passing several good places to get chips, which John pointed to confusedly. Sherlock blew past them, not even looking up when John pointed them out, and stopped, several streets later, in front of a small grimy restaurant.
“Just now, I told him if we could get out of our flat we would come. It appears we can, so I suppose we will.”
Sherlock seemed unperturbed by the plastic pinecone bouncing off his head. “Sherlock if you don’t get over here and help me decorate this damn tree I’ll tell Mrs. Hudson it was you who broke her favorite teapot.” Sherlock’s head snapped up in an instant.
“Well, I don’t want to miss the trailers,” Sherlock said, craning his neck to see how many people were in front of them. The line wasn’t actually that long, considering that it was the middle of the day, not to mention the middle of the week. When they finally did make it to their seats Sherlock settled in and John cast a sidelong glance at him, surprised by his apparent love for animated films. He passed over the popcorn and as the trailers started poked Sherlock on the shoulder, “You turned your phone off, right?” he whispered.
“And even if I didn’t have his name for secret Santa, I’d still have this problem. I want to get him something nice, but I have no idea what to give him. As Sherlock and our parents can attest,” he said to John, “I am terrible at giving gifts.”
He still woke early every day, a habit from his time in the military. But since he had started sleeping in Sherlock’s room, instead of his own, he’d taken to lying awake each morning with Sherlock sleeping next to him, letting the sun greet him, instead of the other way around. The first half hour of the day passed quietly, with John tucked happily against Sherlock’s side. The only sound was the gentle rhythm of Sherlock’s breath and the subdued singing of the birds outside.
“Relationship addled state?” All of the blood drained out of John’s face as he watched Molly’s head snap up.
“I’m happy for you two,” she said after a moment. “I’m glad you have each other.” She say primly on the stool John had pulled out and folded her hands in her lap. John turned over to Sherlock and gave him an “apologize,” look.
The girl nodded sympathetically. In the meantime Sherlock had begun scratching under Annie’s chin and Annie rolled onto her side, tail still thumping in excitement. Everyone laughed at her enthusiasm and Sherlock obligingly rubbed her belly for a little while before standing. He thanked the girl, who smiled. “No problem,” she said. Sherlock retrieved his candy cane from John and they all said their goodbyes, Annie and the girl heading in one direction, John and Sherlock heading in another.
John raised an eyebrow at his expression. “If you think of something reasonable, let me know.” He went back to the kitchen and poured a can of chicken noodle soup into a pot on the stove. When it was heated he transferred the soup into two bowls and brought it, along with a chair, into the bedroom. He handed one of the bowls to Sherlock and positioned the chair in the corner furthest from Sherlock to avoid getting sick himself.
“Sorry for calling you guys on Christmas Eve,” said Lestrade, who had called them desperately a few hours earlier with a particularly nasty case. They were standing just outside the police tape of a crime scene, Sherlock having finished examined the body for Lestrade a few minutes before.
“John by prying into people’s private lives we are doing nice things. Would that client we helped last week know what had happened to his wife without our prying? No, he wouldn’t. Therefore, what we do is nice. Our very profession puts us on the nice list or whatever.”
Sherlock looked peeved at the idea of going anywhere but his warm flat. “I’ve got an experiment on at home that I need to check on,” he said. John happened to know that the only “experiment” Sherlock was working on at the moment was the jar of pickled kidneys that had been sitting in their fridge for the last month.
They walked in silence for a while before John saw a cafe coming up at the end of the street. “Want some hot chocolate?” he asked Sherlock as they walked towards it.
“Alright, now then?” John asked. Everyone nodded and they moved sit down. John ran into the bedroom to grab his and Sherlock’s gifts. When he came back Mrs. Hudson had settled into his chair so he perched on the armrest of Sherlock’s, handing Sherlock his gift as he sat down. Sherlock took it and set it in his lap, looking up and smiling at John in thanks. John smiled back and looked around the room.
“Oh yeah?” John bent down and scooped up a handful of snow with his free hand, which he then shoved down the back Sherlock’s coat, moving too quickly for Sherlock to stop him. Sherlock shrieked, sending a flock of birds bursting upwards into the sky from a nearby tree. He writhed, attempting to get the freezing snow off his skin. John covered his mouth with his hand and bent over, laughter shaking his shoulders.
When they got back to the flat they hung up their coats, but the mood had changed, becoming less playful and more fervent and urgent. John could feel the energy cackling between them as they climbed the stairs, like if he reached out and touched Sherlock he would feel an electric shock. He knew Sherlock could feel it too because as they made their way upstairs he heard a change in Sherlock, in the way he breathed and stepped. Like he was anticipating something. They didn’t touch and didn’t look at one another, but John could feel the air pulsing between them, could feel the tension mounting.
His thoughts were interrupted by Sherlock, who stopped and stared, open mouthed, at something down the street. “What?” John asked, looking around at the many Londoners bustling around them, arms leaden with shopping bags, before realizing what Sherlock was staring at. A young girl was approaching them and as she got closer Sherlock called out to her.
As they walked to Hyde Park the wind died down, and by the time they had reached the Winter Wonderland ice rink it had almost completely gone away, leaving a brisk chill in its place. They stood in the long queue, the park bustling with tourists and Londoners alike, despite it being the middle of the week, and waited to get tickets and their skates. When they finally made it onto the ice, each £15 poorer and with bright blue rented skates strapped to their feet, there were large clumps of people racing past.
When he arrived he stood behind John and looked over his shoulder. “Oh my,” he said, “it appears to have snowed.”
“Are there any cookies left?” Sherlock called to John, who was in the kitchen. He was staring pensively out the window, his fingertip tapping on the sill. When John appeared at his shoulder, cookie in hand, and he took it without a word. He’d been sitting like that for over on hour, trying to work out a case. Taking a bite, frown firmly in place, he tried to picture the problem in his mind, but couldn’t seem to get it right.  “I need to think,” he said, standing suddenly. John resisted the urge to ask him, “isn’t that what you’ve been doing for the last hour?”
“Right, so, we’ll get started on analyzing her DNA at the lab then,” he said. As Sherlock started to answer flakes of snow began to fall. The trio looked up at the sky as if to check that this was where the snowflakes were coming from. Snowflakes landed on their faces and melted, leaving little water droplets in their place. The snowflakes were melting as soon as they hit the pavement as well, and Lestrade threw up his hands in frustration. “Damn it, all of the evidence is going to be gone when this is done,” he said. Already the pool of blood beneath the girl was starting to get watery and wash away.
“I’ll have to start getting sick more often if I get treated like this,” Sherlock said, placing a kiss in John’s hair.
“Hmm, that’s true. Fine I’ll come, but we’re just making a snowman, nothing else.” They put on their shoes, grabbed an old scarf and hat, a carrot, and some string and buttons, for lack of coal, and headed downstairs. After getting their coats on they went out, walking to Regent’s Park nearby. When they found an empty spot, with untouched snow, John stopped. Mycroft had been right, most of the snow was already ruined by cars and people walking, but they’d found a nice patch of clean snow near the lake.
“I’m sure Lestrade will be pounding on our door soon, begging you to come back to work. Speaking of which, are you feeling much better?” John reached over and touched his forehead to see if his fever had broken. It had and John sighed in relief.
Squatting down, he began packing a ball of snow in his hands and John, seeing the size of his snowball and the expression of determined fury on his face, retreated further into the park. Sherlock ran and send the snowball flying after him. It hit him square in the back of the head and John laughed and leaned down, scooping up some snow, which he sent over his shoulder at Sherlock.
“I don’t see why you’re getting so worked up over nothing, we don’t even know what Mycroft wants to talk to us about. Now, if you’re not going to read that paper, I will.” And without another word he stole John’s paper and continued eating his eggs. John rolled his eyes and continued with his own eggs.
For several minutes as they walked John’s mind was entirely consumed by the images running through his brain of Sherlock pulling him into a dark corner and kissing him. But when they rounded the corner of the street John saw something else that made his heart do excited jumping jacks. Sitting across the street was a horse drawn carriage, the kind they gave tours to tourists in. He put his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder and pointed to the carriage. “Let’s take a carriage ride, he said, “come on Sherlock.” Before Sherlock could begin to protest John was dragging him across the road towards the carriage.
Despite their romantic moment inside, when they stepped out the door Sherlock shoved his hands deep into his pockets before John could reach out. John has been surprised to find that, in spite of his own vehement denial of his own sexuality, it was Sherlock who shied away from holding hands in public. “Alright John, where is our mystery destination?” He asked.
When John looked at the clock some time later he realized just how quickly the time had gone by and got up to preheat the oven, leaving Sherlock drowsing lazily. Sherlock wandered in a few minutes later, his hair tousled and his dressing gown thrown over his untucked shirt and trousers. John smiled at him, standing barefoot in the doorway of the kitchen, the late afternoon sun giving him a golden glow.
“Yes, I’m not an imbecile, John.” John rolled his eyes and watched as Sherlock carefully placed his ball onto top of the larger ball of snow John was standing next to. John then made the head while Sherlock went off looking for branches to use as the arms. When they had the snowman fully assembled they added the string, carrot, and buttons to make his face and adorned him with the hat and scarf.
“He knows what a secret Santa is, Molly,” Mycroft interrupted. Molly look affronted and they stood, saying nothing, for a moment before Sherlock broke the silence.
John set down his tea on the side table, next to where the book he had threatened Sherlock with was lying, and brought Sherlock his tea. He offered the plate of cookies and Sherlock selected one of John’s messily decorated ornaments. John sat back down into his chair, picking out a snowman for himself. They settled into a comfortable quiet, the pile of cranes growing around Sherlock, until eventually it seemed to bury him, serving as a makeshift blanket. John picked up the book that had almost ended up of Sherlock’s side of the room, and began skimming through it, before settling on an interesting chapter about bone marrow. They stayed like that for some time, Sherlock occasionally coughing and upsetting a bird on his stomach, John looking up attentively every time to make sure he was ok. And each time, Sherlock would give him a little smile to let him know he was fine and John could relax his tensed shoulders. But John knew, the instinct to take care of Sherlock was one that would never go away.
Mycroft raised an eyebrow suspiciously, but didn’t press the matter further. “If you say so. Well, this has been a very instructive visit, thank you,” he said, standing, “I’d prefer if we didn’t acknowledge that this ever happened, if that’s ok with you.”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes, “Frozen counts as a Christmas movie, shut up.” John laughed at his conviction, but didn’t argue any further.
“Oh dear,” said Mrs. Hudson, looking fretfully out the window, “I don’t know what we’re going to do with this weather.”
Sherlock shot him a glare. “Mycroft is not right,” he said. John laughed and jostled his shoulder affectionately. When they got back to their flat they puttered around for a little while, waiting for Molly. When she texted that she was finishing up with work Sherlock headed to the kitchen to make popcorn and John set up the movie. A few minutes later they heard a cab pull up outside followed by a knock at the door. Sherlock went downstairs to let Molly in and as they were coming back up the stairs John heard her laugh at something Sherlock had said.
John could feel his voice getting thick with affection as he gazed at Sherlock’s brightly lit face. “You,” he said, feeling silly, but not caring. Sherlock blinked slowly and didn’t say anything. He still seemed a little lost when it came to openly showing affection for one another. They’d finally gotten around to admitting their feelings for each other two months ago and things had been progressing slowly but steadily since. And John was certainly glad the silently pining phase was over, he couldn’t say he enjoyed feeling like a teenager again.
level of law breaking? So there was some illegal activity in your formative years.” Sherlock leaned forward ever further, a dangerous glint in his eye.
“Well,” said Sherlock, “she clearly didn’t have any plans for tonight and she seems like the kind of person who would be sad about that sort of thing and you said to make her feel better, so I invited her over.”
John and Sherlock looked over at Mycroft, both remembering the time that, in a moment of impatience and frustration, Mycroft had yelled at Mrs. Hudson to shut up. Mycroft’s cheeks went slightly pink and Mrs. Hudson took a sip of her eggnog. “Thank you Mrs. Hudson,” Mycroft said, looking down at the paperweight, slightly embarrassed, but also slightly amused. He passed the neatly wrapped gift he was holding to Greg, who was sitting next to him.
Mycroft cleared his throat nervously and continued. “You see, you two are the only people I can think of who are in a situation similar to mine, so I need advice.” Sherlock looked as though he might say something maligned so John preemptively kicked him again. “My problem is Greg,” Mycroft said.
“That’s the first few lines of the song I wrote you,” Sherlock said quietly, pointing to the music notes engraved on the frame. “I um, I started writing it not long after this was taken.”
He and Lestrade both stood back as Sherlock bent down and began to eagerly examine one of the bodies. They stayed at crime scene for some time, before heading to the crime lab to continue examining evidence. By the end of the day John was exhausted, but Sherlock was positively glowing. He’d coughed a few times throughout the day, but otherwise seemed miraculously healed.
Molly smiled weakly and nodded. “It’s fine, I’m fine,” she said, “I hope you guys have a lovely... um, I don’t know, just, good for you I guess.” To John’s surprise, Sherlock was staring at her sympathetically.
“Yes, really. Why on Earth is the information that tomorrow is a holiday important? I only need to know it’s a holiday on the holiday. Any other time is a waste of brain space.” John shook his head in disbelief and Sherlock shrugged as if this were a perfectly normal explanation. Taking John’s hand, he began walking away from the crime scene and back towards Baker Street.
Before allowing John to reply he picked up his violin with a sort of apprehensive determination and began to play. The first note was sharp and clear, reminding John uncannily of the note that Sherlock had played a few minutes before when he’d had his sudden idea about the case. But what followed was something less urgent. Instead it was curious and a bit skittish, as if he were skirting an idea that he wanted to delve deeper into.
It felt like if he could stay as happy as he was now for a long time to come, then he would have lived his life well. It felt like he had found a place that felt exactly right and he didn’t ever want to leave. And judging by the look on Sherlock’s face, he felt the same way.
“He said to give these to you,” he said. John nodded and continued waiting, eating a few chips as the minutes ticked by. At one point he heard raised voices coming from behind the door, but they were too muffled to understand. Both John and the kid looked at the door, then at each other. A few moments later Sherlock appeared, leading a tall burly man, who looked like a larger, less weedy version of the kid behind the counter, by the shoulder. He steered the man into a seat a few tables away from John.
Mycroft’s prim frown returned and he looked as his brother with an expression of resignation and displeasure, his discomfort at even being here palpable. “I have his name for secret Santa-“
Once they got outside John stopped and turned to Sherlock and paused, giving him a puzzled look before continuing walking. “What was that all about? Inviting Molly over I mean.”
“No,” they said at the same time, which was a lie. As a matter of fact, their first kiss had been in a pumpkin patch. They’d been investigating a crime that had occurred there when it happened.
“Want to try letting go?” John asked him, nodding to the railing. Sherlock met his eyes and slowly lifted his hand from the side of the ice rink. He slid one foot back, pushing forward towards John, but almost immediately fell and landed on his bum. A giggle escaped John’s lips and Sherlock shot him a glare before pushing himself up to stand. He managed to skate to where John was standing a few feet away, but grabbed John’s hand the second he was within arms-length distance of him. John squeezed his hand, still fighting back a laugh, and glided forward, hand tucked assuredly into Sherlock’s.
As they drove along the driver chattered away, pointing out some of the more notable sites, but Sherlock and John, already familiar with London, tuned him out and instead listened to the sound of each other’s breathing and the jingling of the bells that were strung along the side of the carriage. Somewhere in the distance a group of people were singing “Silver Bells” and John smiled at the parallels between the song and this moment, feeling the magic of the holidays in the air around him.
“What? At the same time? Or separately? No don’t answer that. It’s Christmas, we’re supposed to be doing nice things this time of year, not prying into other people’s private lives.”
“John can you hand me my tweezers please?” Sherlock Holmes asked as he leaned over a dead body, examining its clothes and hair with his typical meticulous scrutiny. John obligingly handed Sherlock the tweezers and went back to examining the scene surrounding the body with Inspector Lestrade. The body in question was a young woman who was lying on her stomach with a long slit across her throat and a puddle of red blood pooling beneath her. Clutched in her hand was the torn corner of a piece of paper.
John leaned his head against Sherlock’s shoulder for a moment and sighed contentedly, happy to have an excuse to be this close to Sherlock. But when Sherlock didn’t tense under the weight of John’s head on his shoulder John left it there, letting himself bask in Sherlock’s warmth. Instead of getting uncomfortable Sherlock turned his head to the side, resting his chin on top of John’s head and looking over him out onto the street below.
Sherlock held it up to his eye, making his eye look overly large. “I already have a magnifying glass,” Sherlock said, referring to the collapsible one he took with him to crime scenes.
When Sherlock did wake it was sudden and without warning. He lifted his head abruptly from the pillow and he looked around the room before his eyes landed on John. Seeing John smiling up at him he relaxed and put his head back down, blinking sleepily at him. “It’s Christmas,” John whispered, pressing a kiss to the tip of Sherlock’s nose.
“Ok, now set yours on top of mine,” said John, indicating to Sherlock’s ball of snow, “carefully, don’t drop it.”
“Wait a minute, it actually snowed?” John looked up from the coffee machine, which seemed to have given up on making coffee, and met Sherlock’s eyes.
Or maybe they could just spend the rest of eternity waking down this Christmas light lined street. Getting wrinkles and growing beards before they reached the end and found workers on ladders taking down the decorations. The sudden image of Sherlock as an old person startled John so much that he had to muffle his surprised laugh by burying his face in Sherlock’s shoulder. “You were picturing me as an old person, weren’t you?” Sherlock asked him.
Mycroft made a hmming noise and raised an eyebrow, “you’re getting soft in you relationship addled state, brother dear.”
John rolled his eyes, but didn’t stop doing his little happy dance. “Fine, we’re even,” he said, “but I loved ice skating as a kid, you’re just being unreasonable.” Sherlock was secretly pleased about going skating, just because it made John this happy, but he maintained his outward distain. He stood, lifting John as he did, and walked to the bedroom, John in his arms, to get their shoes.
They meandered along, discussing the many ways to kill someone using Christmas candy, and past cases with strange murder weapons, no doubt getting more than a few strange looks from passersby who happened to catch odd snippets of their conversation.
