Bucky looked at Steve hovering right there at the edge, looking as if he would die if he didn’t touch his cock in the next 30 seconds. “Wouldn’t make any difference though would it baby? You’ll never be able to give it to him the way he needs it because your cock will never be able to fuck him as deep as I can. He’ll only ever scream like this for me, because I’ve owned Tony since the first time I fucked him. From now on, your place is going to be in that fucking chair, watching me shatter Tony apart as he takes me the way you never did. Watching while fuck each other all the ways wanted but could never get from you. The only place you ever going to come again, is on yourself.”
“Ah ok, I’ll talk to him when he comes back then. Don’t want to interrupt him if he’s in the middle of something.”
When Tony let out a loud gasping mewl and shuddered beneath Steve, he broke their kiss. Raising his body to a kneel, Steve separated their bodies as swiftly as he did their mouths but kept the tight grip he had on Tony’s wrists. Breathing hard with arousal, Tony looked up to Steve who looked completely composed. If not for the large evidence Steve was sporting Tony would have sworn he was completely unaffected by what just happened…
“Nhmmm, Bucky yes… Uhh need you, fuck it’s so hard… want you pounding me… God, Ah just you, uhad, bang me so much better.... Mmm, never felt this good... God Bucky, want this, oh yeah, just you, Ahhh, every fucking day.” Tony came, voice yelling through the room as his body shook apart. “Fuck, Ahhhh Bucky, Yes…. Just like that, god, so deep… so far in, need it… God, coming apart… uh, only for you… Hm, just you.”
One morning Tony couldn’t quite reach the coffee carafe’s Steve put on top of the fridge. Without a sound Bucky came up behind him to grab it for Tony. As he reached, Bucky steadied a hand Tony’s hip and inadvertently rubbed his very large dick against Tony’s ass. Tony pushed back into it automatically as his body betrayed his brain and did what it wanted. Bucky gripped his waist tighter as he brought the box down presenting it to Tony. Handing the box off with a smile, he finally let go with a ‘Good morning sugar’ as Tony took it from his hands.
Bucky had been playing with his new interest for a few days now. It was the best luck when Tony needed a part for his arm he didn’t have on hand. This meant Tony had to order it, extending Bucky’s time with him a few weeks. Downside, Bucky no longer had his alone time with Tony in the lab so had to improvise. Seducing Tony in Steve’s presence and under his nose while challenging, was nowhere near difficult. Steve was truly oblivious to a lot of things and didn’t understand
Bucky loosened the grip on his throat while stopping the hand rubbing Tony’s hardness as well. Even though the thickness pounding into him never ceased its movements, Tony was only able to respond somewhat to the question. “Yeah… Sounds good.”
He stopped the hard plunges he was previously giving Tony and began to just roll the smaller man’s hips on his dick as he came down from his orgasm. Tony’s previously loud moans had died down to whimpers and occasional shivers when Steve said, “That was… you two together were, God it was so hot. But, we should um… we should talk about what just happened.” Bucky let go of Tony’s waist and stopped the slow grinds he was giving him as he looked at Steve. Having taken care of Tony, he felt like he could now focus on what it was Steve was trying to say. Once he saw Bucky was no longer moving Tony Steve continued on saying, “I’m not sure I feel, I guess I’m not sure if I feel comfortable with you two… Um, being so…”
The route they made to Steve’s rooms was uneventful, or at least Tony thinks so. He was being distracted by one Steve Rogers in all his Dom glory at the time so whether or not that’s true is still up in the air. What Tony can say with complete certainty is between kisses and gropes to each other’s flesh, that they did make it at some point.
Tony’s face was flushed as he said ‘no’ and Bucky looked down to Steve asking what was wrong. “I don’t know Bucky, maybe I’m not moving into him right? I can’t figure it out.”
Bucky growled possessively saying, “If he needs to be moved I’ll do it. I know exactly how Tony’s needs it and where to put him,” as he kneeled sitting below Tony’s ass holding it open with each hand. Sliding inside Tony at a quicker pace though not as hard, Bucky ignited a small fire across his skin. “How does that feel Tony?” Bucky asked as he leaned over Tony’s back, hands going to grip the pool wall as he brought the faces together still bouncing Tony in his lap. “Am I working in there the way need it? Let me and Stevie know I’m hitting it right,” Tony felt Bucky lips lift upward and smile saying, “I know what you look like when you’re getting it good. Stevie’s never seen that on your face has he,” When Tony shook his head no amongst his cries of ecstasy Bucky chuckled, “I didn’t think he had. You’ll have to let him know what you’re feeling when I’m sliding into you the way you love it. That way he knows what your face is supposed to look like when someone’s thrusting into you like you need it.”
Once finished, Bucky took both lists before saying they’d be going over a little at a time starting with foreplay. This is how Tony wound up sitting on the edge of his bed naked, Steve down between his legs naked as well, while Bucky sat on the bed beside him fully dressed. “Alright Stevie, you can go ahead and start. Just do what you normally would while I watch and I’ll stop you if I need to.” Looking down to see Steve take the head of Tony’s cock in his mouth, Bucky placed a hand on the small of Tony’s back and leaned forward as if getting a closer look. “Good Stevie, that’s it keep going.” He felt the hand on his back slide down the crease between both his cheeks. It pulled away as Tony shivered giving Bucky an annoyed expression, getting a slightly apologetic one in response.
Tony left a few moments later saying he had to feel out some paperwork for Pepper. Steve eyes always seem to see right through him. Tony wasn’t for sure if he actually could see what he felt but he wasn’t going to stick around and find out.
Tony looked over his shoulder giving Steve a flirty smile. “Well that’s not the only body part I love. I’m also a big fan of…” Tony paused watching Steve’s face become flushed before he finished saying, “your cute little button nose.”
The third time however, all of the team had been in residence as Tony began to feel the shaking start in his hands. Locking down the lab, he had been there for 2 days. Jarvis was continually telling him about Natasha and Clint asking if he was okay and Bruce had been constantly tapping at his door. On the third day, when Tony ignored Thor banging loudly on his lab door saying, “Stark, I need assistance with sending electronic mail to Jane. Is this some message sent with electricity, can I just use my powers?”, that the four of them had enough of Tony’s disappearing act and called in reinforcements.
Clint was the bratty Sub brother he
Tony’s voice was barely above a whisper when he asked, “How do you know that? It has to be, I spoke to them… It is, it can’t… It has to be true.”
Bucky watched Tony slump down in his chair bringing a hand to his face as the guilt settled in for what he’d done. He smirked at the confirmation that Tony was thinking of him. Placing his hands in his pockets Bucky continued on his way back up to the penthouse. He’d leave his new toy alone for the rest of the day but
Tony shrugged his shoulders slowly, “They confirmed every word was true. None of them had ever bonded and every last one of them was still alone. After everything I saw, I promised myself I wouldn’t end up that way, that I’d embrace who I was. Figured I’d do better knowing from the start it wasn’t in the cards for me. Until now, until you, I was okay with the hand I was dealt. Had even learned to love how I was different. Then you just had to ride in on your white spangly horse, destroying everything I’ve built. Making me want everything I can’t have, wish I could be just like everyone else.”
Bucky grabbed Steve’s hand, dragging it along Tony’s abdomen until he stopped and pressed down. Steve felt his breath catch and his dick twitch trying to show interest from what he felt. “He feels so good Stevie; don’t know why you’re not inside him every minute of every day.” As Bucky pulled his own hand back to grip Tony’s hips to drive in harder, Steve moaned along with Tony. He felt his cock begin to harden as felt Bucky’s cock pushing against the skin below his hand.  “I’m so deep inside him, God I wish you could feel how tight he is when you’re this deep inside him. Can tell no one’s fucked him down this far, feels like a fucking virgin around the last few inches of my cock. Uhhh, fuck if he were mine I’d have him sitting on my cock all day every day, just keeping it warm until I’m ready to fuck him again. Ahh yeah, you’d like that wouldn’t you baby? You want to sit with me inside you, filling you up like this every day.”
“Tony… What are you…?” Bucky trailed off saying as he began to move his hand again. “I’m sorry Tony… been trying so hard… Now here you are.... Just to fucking beautiful.” Tony was finally able to get his body to respond in self-preservation. His knees went weak and he had to grasp the door handle to stay standing. Heat coursed through his body as all his blood rushed to harden Tony further. “God baby, I need you… I can’t fight wanting you anymore.”
Steve was conflicted since he wanted them to go on but also wanted them to stop and was happy when Tony came, now he wouldn’t have to make that choice. He was about to get up and go to Bucky, aching and wanting nothing but to feel the man fuck him through the mattress at this point, when Steve realized Tony came untouched. He’d always told Steve it wasn’t possible for him and that no one had ever made him come without help. Both of his boyfriends were driving each other to higher heights of pleasure Steve had never managed for either of them.
“One on one?” Steve asked, turning to give Bucky a questioning look. “You don’t want to talk to us together?”
Bucky walked over to kneel between Tony and Steve legs where they sat facing each other on the sofa. He hadn’t clued Tony into what Steve had asked him to do for two reasons. For one Bucky wanted Tony’s response of uncertainty to to be completely genuine, secondly he wanted to test how far Tony would bend to give Bucky what he wanted. Giving them both a look of assurance as he crouched down, Bucky placed a hand on each of their legs but looked at Tony as he spoke. “I promise we won’t do anything you feel uncomfortable with Tony. Even if you agree now we can stop and call it a quits at any time, okay?”
So he watched Bucky sit back on his feet between Tony’s legs and his hands traveled Tony’s thighs, he hoped they’d like being together. Steve knew if they didn’t, he was going to lose Tony and his heart ached at the thought.
Steve was usually soft and loving, even when really going at Tony he didn’t really fuck him so much as make love to him rougher than usual. But, the way Bucky was manhandling him, holding Tony down and making him take every inch of his dick with every thrust made Tony realize even an old playboy can discover new kinks. He didn’t think he’d like to be pushed around, made to take whatever his partner was giving him, but damn if Barnes wasn’t driving him to new heights doing just that. “Yes Bucky, so good… Fuck, so good. Don’t stop baby, harder… God please don’t ever fucking stop.”
After Bucky’s “threesome” with them, he never really left their bed. It became common place to find him fucking Tony against the wall or sucking Steve off at the kitchen table. After about a month he became the dominant part in their relationship not even allowing Steve to touch Tony in any capacity without his permission. They went on dates together and separately. It was mostly just Tony and Bucky as Steve was still apart of SHIELD. Bucky had opted out choosing a ‘consultant’ status alongside Tony, only taking missions when they had no one else. Tony reveled in their alone time, loving having Bucky’s full attention on him. The team had even welcomed the change seeing how happy it made all three men.
Impulse telling Bucky to reassert his dominance, he thought of the call from Steve that afternoon. Tony had given into him so beautifully. Bucky knew the engineer started to become turned on by the situation, finishing quickly at Bucky fucking his brains out with Steve right there unaware. After the call, Bucky continued to fuck Tony for another hour before bringing them both to another climax. He had remained hard in Tony after their first climax together because of Tony’s participation in deceiving Steve.
Tony leaned back, taking in Steve’s stoic expression. He knew the Dom meant every word he said. He also knew Steve would hit the ground running as soon as Tony told him what he wanted to know. No… That was wrong. This was Steve he was dealing with. He would no doubt spout apologies first, giving Tony looks of pity before he made his escape. This why he never told anyone, Tony didn’t want their sympathy or their pity.
Steve looked remorseful as he face fell, “I’m sorry Buck, maybe you can just get in with the clothes you have on?”
Bucky waved Steve off and sat his cup down as he leaned over to look down at Tony. Bucky grimaced rubbing his forehead looking pained as Tony swallowed. He couldn’t take in air having a fourth of Bucky’s cock down his throat, massaging the portion there with his throat muscles. “Sorry Stevie, didn’t mean to scare you but damn, it’s really blowing… Uh, fuck yeah its Um, it took me down far. Was caught by surprise, engulfed my head out of nowhere. It’s coming… Uh, feels just about finished up, give me a sec…” Still swallowing around him, Tony began rolling his tongue along the veins underneath. “Damn, ahh fuck that’s it,” Bucky groaned under his hand massaging his temples, cock pulsing in Tony’s mouth as he came. “God, Damn… that was…” Bucky shook his head down at Tony before looking back to Steve. “Sorry Steve, never felt anything like that before. Just about blew my head off.”
The first time Bucky came and was still hard made Steve pause, since it was the first time he had ever seen it happen. Usually he’d have to give Bucky some help to go again quickly if they wanted to, but he had stayed hard not once but twice after coming inside Tony. The first time made the first stirring of arousal streak across him, the second was like putting a match to gasoline inside Steve with a small touch of jealousy.
By the time Bucky was almost all the way in Tony felt his orgasm approaching. “Bucky, Oh God, Uhhh… I’m gonna, fuck I can’t, gonna…” Tony eyes screwed shut as he felt a miniature explosion rip its way through his body. His back arched and an animal like sound tore through his throat as he felt Bucky bottom out, finally all the way inside him. Tony’s eyes fluttered back open to stare back up to Bucky as he had moved his head above Tony’s smirking down.
Bucky had never stopped moving, kept fucking Tony through his orgasm and continued on after he’d finished, though Tony could feel his arms shaking from the aftermath. “If anyone is making you come tonight, it’s gonna be me. I said I was nowhere near done with you, that I’d make you come twice, and I always make good on my promises.”
Tony wasn’t sure how long Bucky kept at him since his thoughts and sense of time always became scattered whenever they were together. By the time Bucky stopped the slow paced tease, Tony was rock hard again. Bucky then washed him, taking special care and consideration of Tony in ways only Steve had ever done before. It made Tony feel cherished, important to Bucky in a new way. Once he finished he pushed Tony out the shower, telling him to untie Steve so he could come shower as well.
It was two days afterwards that Tony plans to stay away from one James Buchanan Barnes’ dick took a major sideways turn. He had been avoiding both men, keeping to his lab until they were asleep and only rising from their bed when they had left for their morning run. This had worked perfectly until the day Tony overslept and missed his window to make it down to his lab without seeing them. He could hear the shower running as he came awake and knew one or both soldiers were in there washing off their work out. Hoping for the latter, Tony looked around the bed to see if he was alone and took in a shaky breath at what he saw.
Laughter still in his smile Steve wrapped an arm around Tony. “I told Buck he could take one of the guest rooms, up here with us. There any one specific you want him to use?”
Tony was able to cry out the affirmative around the moaned cries Bucky kept dragging from him with every thrust. “God yes, Bucky please… Love this so much, let me… Uhhh please, please, please…”
“He’ll probably need something to hold onto so just have him wrap his arms around your waist.” Tony did as instructed which brought Bucky’s long hard erection rubbing his face. “Alright Tony try to open up as wide as you can for me.” Knowing Bucky meant his mouth and not his legs, Tony opened as he felt the head slide down his chin, passing his lips to push into Tony’s mouth as Bucky moved his hips. “Ok Stevie, I think we’re good now to start working him loose. The key to all the exercises we’re doing today is constant force back and forth, easing your way in,” Tony moan was muffled around Bucky’s cock plunging into his mouth as he felt a tongue circle around his wrinkled center, “and then easing out. You get all that Steve?”
The End??? Thinking about writing a more risqué epilogue since the focus of this was more relationship dynamic buildup.
Tony bit his lip to keep back the moan wanting to rise up when what Bucky had said registered. Looking down he saw what the soldier had meant, that there was 3 inches of Bucky’s dick that he hadn’t put inside Tony, he knew he was well and truly fucked. He already felt so full, as if Bucky was everywhere touching everything inside him. He hadn’t realized he’d spoken those words out loud until Bucky smiled down cockily at him as he pulled out leaving just the tip of his dick in Tony. “Not yet sugar, but I’m about to be.”
Bucky bit at Tony’s lip as he looked up at Steve saying, “I completely understand why you don’t like to top with me now. Not sure anything can hold a candle to having him squirming on your dick begging for more.”
Tony looked down to where Bucky sat and blushed at the filthy look he was given. “Well, you gonna ask me nicely to pay you some attention sweetheart.”
Bucky looked down at Tony as he began to stroke a little faster into him. “Is that so?” Tony didn’t really answer as much as groan out a yes from a well-placed thrust. Bucky shook his head, “No, I don’t believe that. The way you’re shaking on my dick right now Stark, no way you’re not gonna come more than once.”
If Tony’s A.I. could smirk, he knew it would be wearing one now. “I believe you keep me around for sentimental reasons sir… There doesn’t seem to be anyone or anything else qualified to handle your particular brand of theatrics.”
Steve nodded his head, “White noise.” When Tony gave him a confused stare he continued on explaining, “You have white noise syndrome. Your mind gets to the point it won’t stop going, even when you want it to. Usually happens when you haven’t been dropped in a while. When was the last time you were and how long has this been going on?”
Safe to say, Tony found it in his best interest to hold himself in check until he finished.
Steve looked confused for a moment before comprehension dawned on his face, bringing a look of sadness along with it. “Because I made you feel like you didn’t.”
Tony’s mind came back to the present just as Steve came moaning in his ear. Rolling onto his side, Steve gathered Tony cuddling into his back. Tony may have a ‘free ride’ coming from Bucky, but he was sure that would be the only one given out. He’d have to figure out something soon if he didn’t want to go to long without Bucky.
Steve looked happily over the pair. “Glad Bucky is able to help you with your soreness so well. But uhhh… Bucky,” Tony’s eyes widened as he looked up with a tremor of fear as Steve gazed down at Bucky’s arms leaning beside Tony’s legs at the edge of the pool, “Don’t you need your hands to help stretch him out? How does it work if you don’t use them?”
Tony came shuddering as his toes curled beside Steve’s head. He reached the breaking point when Steve offered Bucky a book of stretches he had from SHIELD.
Once the initial shock wore off, Steve began to pull away from Tony’s mouth. The move was aborted when opened his mouth and licked at Steve’s lips. After that, Tony was no longer the dominant force in their kiss, or at all for that matter. Steve groaned into his mouth, deepening the kiss as his full weight settled between Tony’s legs. His tongue swept forcefully into Tony’s mouth while his hands pulled Tony’s wrist above his head, trapping the sub beneath him.
Tony heard Steve behind him saying, “Jesus Christ Tony,” as he dropped his head down to his desk groaning loudly. “You are the biggest snitch in the world J, why have I not decommissioned you yet? Your treachery knows no bounds Brutus…”
Smiling down, Steve said, “Yeah, you are the best that way.”
idea…
Tony lay on his bed face down as Steve pushed inside of him. Wrapping Tony is his arms Steve began to move giving Tony his full weight. He was whispering endearments in Tony’s ear kissing his neck, and Tony was lying underneath sincerely trying to enjoy it. So far, almost everyone pant and moan coming from him was faked. The reason they were in the position was so that Steve wouldn’t see Tony’s initially half hard cock go completely soft and ask questions.
Tony was in a pissy mood. When Steve said he was going out to the bar tonight with Sam, for the third time this week, Tony decided it should be a team outing instead. Clint had grumbled the entire way asking Nat why they had to skip cuddling because Tony wouldn’t take his head out of his ass. She on the other hand only looked amused about tonight’s excursion. He encouraged Thor to drone on about the ‘revels’ he’d have on Asgard to drown out Clints whining.
It was the night of Steve’s birthday that things took a turn Tony did not see coming. He and Steve had been making out on their bed, grinding into each other while slowly growing more and more heated. Steve was supposed to spend tonight with Bucky, but had wanted to spend some time with Tony before he went to the other man’s room. It had probably been about 3 months since Tony had been without sex because Steve but didn’t want to push him if he didn’t already want it with him, but when Steve kissed him good night saying ‘I love you’, Tony couldn’t help it as he deepened the kiss. Steve had groaned into the other man’s mouth as it happened, settling Tony under him fairly quickly as he responded to Tony’s need.
The relationship dynamics of our future stuckony triangle start showing!
Tony’s hands were fisted above where Bucky’s were holding his wrist, eyes screwed shut as he panted whimpered loudly. “God yes Bucky, so good… Need it, fuck please… Deeper, harder please I… Fuck, Uhhh need deeper…”
Nat chuckled minutely, to which one of their responses Tony wasn’t for sure but it was probably both. She was polishing her knives in the lounge chair next to them while Clint lay across the back of it tossing a ball in the air. “Gonna have to agree with Stark on that one,” she said looking up to smirk at Steve while she worked, “No one answers the question ‘What do you like to do for fun?’ with ‘Work out’.”
This however did not stop Steve’s orgasm as he spilled across his hand, cum landing on his own thigh and Tony’s groaning, “Oh fuck baby, you just sounded so good, I’m sorry, Uhhh.”
Steve Rogers.
Looking down Bucky gripped the sticky flesh in his hand smirking arrogantly. “Yeah it went down completely when I was banging into Tony, knew it’d finish and ease up at some point.” Shrugging and walking to his room Bucky said, “Told ya it was nothing to worry about, went soft right after I was done drilling into Tones.”
Giving an indifferent shrug, Tony ran a hand through his hair before he blew out a frustrated sigh. “I know I have like, zero rights to be jealous in this situation, but I liked being the only one you did that to.” Sitting down in his stool, Tony stared dejectedly at the floor before he finished saying, “That had been just ours you know, and now it’s not anymore.”
He watched as Steve grew red with embarrassment, groaning out, “I can, I… Should of made him come before I did. Please Bucky, just… Uhh let me touch… I’ll try again please…”
Tony watched as he walked away, hating the warmth the filled him when Steve confirmed Bucky’s words. Before they went to lunch, he told Steve he needed a moment to talk with Bucky alone. He gave the excuse of wanting to make sure the other man was really okay with the new turn of events. Cornering Bucky in his room, Tony told him to tell the truth about everything. Bucky didn’t even feign ignorance and just told Tony the truth wouldn’t make him happy, but that he’d tell him if he really wanted know it all.
with the knowledge drilled into every fiber of who I am. I know all the ways you want to give in, all the ways to get you there, and more importantly, all the reasons why you fight so hard against it. So go ahead, continue sitting here being the bratty asshole Sub you always pretend to be, I’ll enjoy proving every word I’ve said to you is true. Or, you can do as I’ve asked. Either way staying here is not an option, I’m not leaving without you.”
Tony rose up, sliding what he managed to get of Bucky’s cock back out of him before coming back down and taking a little more. He repeated the action again and again, eyes glazed over as he stared at Bucky. His moans and whimpers getting little louder each time he settled himself back down. “Uh, Bucky… Tony, can we… Can you stop so we can talk first?”
Bucky just nodded back to him as these thoughts flew through his head. “Yeah, of course, make sure he's ok with it. Actually, you may even want to give it another week just to make sure he doesn’t come around.”
Tony was looking at Bucky as if he sprouted two heads as he heard Steve say, “Deal Buck. Is it ok if we start now, maybe not even a full week just a couple of days?”
Damn if that didn’t start to change everything…
After the shock wore off, it only took Tony about two seconds to say yes.
Tony took more of it into his mouth using every trick he knew to work his way down. Bucky was spewing a steady stream of curses and admirations at Tony’s ministrations. His words only pushed Tony to give more, take more, fighting his gag reflex tooth and nail just for more of  Bucky’s praise. Tony was so lost in what he was doing that he didn’t even register how much of Bucky’s dick was in his mouth, how much he had down his throat, until Bucky held his head to keep Tony from moving back up. Looking up Tony met Bucky’s gaze with a questioningly look.
On the way to his lab he decided to pound out the dents in his armor. He’d been putting it off since their last mission to work on other things instead. Tony was feeling angry and bitter, that always called for hammering things until he felt better.
Bucky had never seen anyone drop as hard or as fast into subspace as Tony just had. It confirmed he’d been reading the other man right so far. After running a company as well as running the Avenger’s with Steve, Bucky guessed Tony needed someone to take control and give him a break from it all. While he had dabbled in dominating a few of his exes, he’d never enjoyed it as much as he was with Tony. The way he went pliant so easily for Bucky set his blood on fire in a way no one else had. Now that he was seeing the man drop so beautifully for him like he was, Bucky was hurdling right to the razors edge.
Steve groaned leaning his head back before he raised it back up to kiss Tony. Steve broke the kiss and held Tony’s hips, keeping them still as he looked to him, eyes growing serious. “I… Yeah, I did enjoy it, but… I kind of miss this Tony. Miss when it was just you and me.”
Bucky held his arms to the bed, thrusting in deeper and deeper as his mouth kiss and nipped the skin below. Tony’s cries below him were coming faster and closer together as his drove the man to incoherence. He made sure to graze every hot spot on Tony’s body, focusing on the ones that made the man below him arch beneath him and squeeze around Bucky’s erection. Although moving a little faster, he denied Tony that last inch of him, waiting for the right moment. “That it baby, love it when you moan and shake all over my dick. You love the way I give it to you to don’t you honey? Love the way I make this ass mine don’t you sweetheart?”
When Steve didn’t reply back, Bucky looked over to where he lay and realized it was because he was in the middle of painting the sheets with his come. Having confirmed they wouldn’t be interrupted again, he brought his attention back to making Tony scream and shake underneath him until he forgot everything but Bucky’s name.
Things had started out fine. Bucky had come up from the training room to find Tony on his knees, Steve’s dick pumping in and out of his mouth. Instead of joining them like Tony, and probably Steve had assumed he would, Bucky had removed his clothes to sit in the lounge chair across from their bed. When Steve gave him a questioning look, Tony could feel the heat of Bucky’s eyes roaming over his skin when he said, “I want to watch you two together.” Tony watch, head still bobbing up and down Steve, as Bucky began to stroke himself. “Damn if that isn’t a pretty picture. Keep going Stevie, fuck his mouth and then fuck his ass."
“Oh god, yes. Just like that, don’t stop.” As Bucky continued to ram his way through Tony, losing himself to the feeling of being fully seated inside someone for the first time, he relinquished all that self-control he’d been holding on to like Tony asked. No longer holding back, his hands moved to Tony’s shoulders to keep the smaller man from moving up the bed with each thrust and held him in place. Tony was moving rapidly to a place of incoherence with the way Barnes was driving into him.
But, when Tony heard Bucky voice say, “You need it deep like this don’t you, the way only I can do it.” Tony’s body began to shake, needing release but unable to move under Bucky to stroke himself. “I own this ass now don’t I sweet thing?” Tony felt Bucky’s hand gripping tightly at his ass before speeding up his pace, “It’s ok to want it, sugar. It’s ok if you want to be all mine.” Somehow getting impossibly deeper inside Tony, the careful thrusts Bucky began with were now replaced by the harder snap of Bucky’s hips down to Tony’s. “No one’s made ever you feel this good have they?” Speeding up his thrust, Bucky made Tony see stars. His vision began to blur around the edges and his body hadn’t stopped shaking as Bucky overwhelmed him. “Course not baby, no one will ever touch you as deep as I can.” Tony only faintly realized the voice echoing through the room was his own. Unable to focus on anything other than Bucky drilling into him, Tony was surprised when Bucky’s teeth bit at his neck. “Say you’ll let me have you whenever I want. Tell me you’ll be mine sweetheart.” Tony moaned Bucky’s name over and over again like a prayer, awareness centered entirely on the other man.
“What!? Tony… No, the team was worried, we haven’t seen you in days and…” Steve shook his head while he spoke, looking at Tony in mild shock, “Do I even want to know why the first emergency your brain went to is a zombie apocalypse happening?”
With that, Tony felt Steve’s fingers entering him as his body grew pliant. He let go of… Everything, until Steve was the only thing anchoring him to the world. He knew he’d dropped fully into subspace for the first time when Steve finally entered him, cock stretching Tony open as he slid in completely in one stroke. He felt his mind reaching toward the dominant’s and the other’s man’s consciousness wrapping around his as Steve’s mind did the same.
He really hoped Steve enjoyed the last time he fucked Tony because, for the foreseeable future, no one was going near that ass but Bucky.
Likely from being in a good mood after their talk, Steve had let Tony hide out on his floor for the rest of the day. The next morning however did not come with the same luck. No matter what Tony said, no matter how much he begged sweetly or yelled angrily at Steve, the super soldier still dragged Tony down to have breakfast with the team the following morning.
Hearing Bucky, watching him tell Steve how much better he was a fucking Tony. Hearing him let the man know Bucky was drilling inside so far he was in practically in Tony’s stomach. Telling Steve Bucky was touching Tony in places and ways he never could, caused shivers to begin racing down his body. “God, yes Bucky… need it, deeper in there… Uh, just like that.”
Tony gave him a half smile, expression beginning to show even more guilt before he looked to the floor. “Steve… Um, maybe we should talk…”
Steve seemed overwhelmed with all the information. “I uh, didn’t know there was… how I would even do hip rolling… Bucky what the hell am I gonna do?” Steve asked, voice growing higher and panicked with each word.
Bucky smiled as he felt Steve laughter when Tony sat beside them. Steve was still smiling when he replied back, “Lucky for you then we were talking about your more recent endeavors, the past few days to be exact.” Tony’s face began to take on a red hue at Steve’s last words. “Bucky told me some things that helped me understand his side a little better.” At the questioning stare he received, Bucky gave a brief version of what he’d said earlier. When finished, Steve asked, “Can you tell me what you were feeling Tony?”
When Steve nodded his head, Bucky kissed him again before settling back in his place. Giving a sigh of contentment Steve finally shut his eyes, loving thoughts of the two men beside him drifting through his consciousness.
Tony pulled his hand out of Bucky’s, letting it waver in the air uncertainly before he crossed his arms over his chest.  He looked down as he shifted his hand again to massage his forehead, the shifting of his movements mimicking the inconsistent emotions he felt inside himself.  “Look, I’m sorry… I just, I didn’t mean to put all the responsibility on you cause, well I was a more than willing participant in it all. I feel, I can’t help… I really am in love with you Bucky but, it just… It has to stop. I can’t, I
The Dom in front of him licked his lips giving Tony a sexy smirk. “I can give you any ride you need baby.”
Steve began stopping in his motions as they neared throwing a smile over to the pair. “Hey you two, coming down to get your work out in?”
Special Thanks for these Awesome ideas:
Now that he knew any of this was possible with his boyfriends he wanted to experience it first hand with them. He needed to know how to pull those reactions from both men. Steve knew he’d be okay with both men together once that happened, once he figured out how to make them feel that good with him to.
…Really, Really well.
“Hello sugar, nice to finally meet the man Stevie here doesn’t shut up about.”
Moaning into the cup as he swallowed half of it down in one go, he finally opened his eyes to blink up at Steve. Blushing brightly he crawled out of the man’s lap and sat next to him. He couldn’t help but be slightly embarrassed about what just happened and what was to come. He hated how blank Steve’s expression was as he watched Tony closely, not giving him any insight into what he was thinking.
Tony mind began to grow fuzzy at the words, slight buzzing coming to his ears as he felt as if he was falling into a cloud. His words were slurred as he said, “Yes… God, yes Steve. Whatever you want.”
His cock hardened thinking about how his “ass cramps” had flared up yesterday. Bucky and Tony had been naked from the waist down as Bucky had called Steve into the living room. He’d had Tony’s back over the back of the couch holding Tony’s legs open as he leaned over him kneeling on the cushions. Bucky had Steve hold Tony’s legs saying he couldn’t ram him as hard as he needed trying to hold them himself. Tony was given the okay to cum once Bucky had maneuvered him into Steve’s arms to be held up. He’d wrapped his arms Bucky’s neck, moaning loudly into his ear as Bucky whispered how much better he fucked Tony than Steve did. Bucky had groaned loudly and Tony screeched as Bucky pinched his balls semi painfully. His thrust slowed to a crawl as he began spewing false apologies to Steve saying he’d accidently slipped inside Tony.
Tony gave a crude smile to Bucky over his shoulder at Steve’s words. He felt the sensations rippling through his giving signal to his climax approaching. Wanting to give Bucky the same thrill Tony had received at his thinly cloaked words, he was unable to keep from replying. Knowing the breathy huskiness in his voice would come as a whine of disgruntlement to Steve he said, “Uhhh, but he’s so bossy Steve. Bucky’s been riding my ass since you left and he won’t let up.”
Steve muttered under his breath with a groan before replying back. “I’m almost positive I’ll be sorry if I ask but… What the hell are you talking about?”
Bucky leaned forward to kiss him, wanting to feel Steve against him for a moment. It lasted longer than either man expected needing to ground themselves in each other, and only finally stopped with the ding of the elevator. Both men looked over to where Tony exited coming forward cautiously when sensing the obvious heavy conversation happening.
Bucky smiled as his hand moved to rake across the side of Steve’s face. “Once I was able to think about what happened without feeling guilty, I started to question the things I should have in the first place.” He rose up on his elbow to fully gaze down on Steve’s face. “The Steve Rogers I know and love is a fighter. He’d never sit back and let something happen he didn’t want to. Would never watch while the men he loved completely disregarded everything he asked for. Let it happen not once, not twice, but three times as he sat and did nothing, unless what was happening was something he wanted to. After that realization, everything else fell into place. I just had to ask myself what would make my Stevie like what he was seeing but too afraid to tell us. But I think the better question would be why would Steve feel like he couldn’t tell the people he loved what was going on in his head?”
Clint yelled from the vents, “Then I’d hit them with arrows… Wait that’s too hard… ‘Tash’d let me go first, I’d hit you with arrows then.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony opened his mouth to respond be had to bite his lip when Bucky moved as if adjusting his seat causing Tony to bounce minutely on his cock. “Its fine Stevie, you look wiped. Tony’s already told me I’m hitting his problem areas. I don’t mind continuing my magic and working him over some more.”
What Tony had not expected, and in hindsight probably should have, is that to get to know Steve Rogers, he’d actually get to
Maybe it was the fact that Tony was competitive, or maybe even a little angry at Steve for wanting Bucky as much as he did, but Tony wanted to be the one to take all of Bucky. He needed something in all of this that only he could offer, even if that wasn’t to Steve. Giving the soldier a determined look, Tony squeezed Bucky’s ass as he said, “I want it all, want to feel all of you. God Bucky, fuck me as deep as you can.” Bucky’s gaze grew even more heated than they already were but Tony saw he was still hesitating. Before he could ask Tony answered him saying, “I’m sure, ask Steve. I never do more than I can take and I’ve had to stop him before.” Giving Bucky a look of frustration he continued saying, “I know my body, now fucking fuck me already or move and let Steve do it.”
I  simultaneously love and hate this chapter. I feel like it begins terribly and ends OK. As always thanks for reading and please let me know what you liked!!!
Taking one of the Quinjet’s they made it to New York in just under two hours. Steve showed him to the Penthouse saying he could take one of the guest rooms or the floor below them. Opting to see how well this first meeting went Bucky didn’t give an answer initially and just dropped his duffle bag in the living room. He’d let Steve assume what his response was until he made the choice. Shortly after their arrival Tony made his appearance. The dark haired male had grease smudges on his cheek and forehead as well as spots on his T-shirt and jeans. Rooted to the spot he initially rose to stand in when Tony arrived, Bucky was frozen.
“LadyJaye” I freaking loved your idea so much!!! I’m debating between putting it in the next chapter or saving for one of the new stories. Angling toward the next story but we’ll see!
Tony turned to Steve giving him a fond look that Steve returned before he chuckled slightly shaking his head at Bucky. “Sorry about that, I’m pretty tame now a days so you were probably bored out of you mind. Steve’s told me some of the antics you used to get up to.”
It might be Steve’s arm around Tony, but it was Bucky’s cum dripping out of him.
Natasha’s laughter trickled off slowly but her smile lingered as she thought through Tony’s question. She began unraveling the tape from her hands as she looked up at the ceiling muttering out her thoughts. “Fairly new relationship, protective instincts will be going haywire… Need to assert dominance…? Nah, overpowered by sub care instincts. Submissive acts…?” She snorted loudly before softly stating, “Tony’d never pull that one off…”
Bucky nodded at Steve, losing himself a little in the sensation of Tony being halfway down his dick and gripping it so fucking tight. “Fuck baby, yeah. You feel so good around me, taking me so good. Gonna take it all for me again, aren’t you sweet thing?”
As they boarded Tony’s jet to come back home, Bucky called to tell Tony about the apple Thor got for them. Apparently it would not only give Tony near immortality, shortening his aging to down to about a year for every day he aged now, but it would also reverse him back to somewhere in his mid-twenties. So while he wouldn’t live forever, he’d have centuries with his soldiers. Tony smiled as he thought of Bucky also telling him he was too excited to wait and was going to fuck Steve the entire way back. Slipping off his shirt and pants he chuckled at the thought that Steve didn’t know Tony knew what they did together. Anytime Tony would tell Steve how much he loved the fact Tony was the only one who got to fuck him, Steve would just blush and look guilty before changing the subject. It alleviated all of Tony’s guilt at fucking Bucky whenever he wanted to.
Chuckling Bucky said, “It’s ok Stevie, I was just letting you know I understand now. Don’t go feeling guilty over nothing.” Bucky leaned over to kiss Steve temporarily stopping his movements with Tony. Breaking the kiss, Bucky pulled out of Tony completely before gliding back in. He leaned over further into Tony, folding the smaller man in half as Bucky rested his forehead against Tony’s.
Though the words were spoken softly in Tony’s ear, he jerked in Steve’s arms as if they’d been shouted. After trying to pull back twice but unable to go against the super soldiers hold, Tony stopped trying and just gasped out, “What… I don’t, what do you mean?”
Tony’s eyes widened and he fought the effort to start jumping for joy. Trying to seem hesitant, as if this was a hard decision, Tony waited a moment before he replied. “Bucky’s your best friend Steve, I get you want to make sure he’s okay.” Giving Steve a sarcastic sigh he continued saying, “I’ll miss sleeping naked but I guess for you I’ll suffer through it.”
Tony shivered as heat burned beneath his skin, he always did love when his partners begged him for it. Nodding at Steve he told him to go slow. With the rush prep job, even Steve moving into him slowly was more painful than arousing. Because of this it took more time than usual for Tony to really start enjoying the feeling of Steve moving in him. Having had a huge jump on Tony, it was no surprise when Steve’s hips began to move franticly as his cock pulsed inside Tony, coming with a loud deep groan.
“You don’t have to do that Bucky…” Tony started, but before he could finish or move, he was interrupted by the other man.
Electric currents began making their way across Tony’s skin as Bucky continued to fuck him, gliding Tony back and forth across his lap. Tony wailed, “Yes Bucky, Please… Don’t stop… Want that, want you all the time.”
Bucky’s orgasm surprised them all. He moaned as he fucked Tony though it saying, “Jesus Christ Tony, I’ve never felt anything this good in my life.” When Bucky stopped thrusting, aftershocks still rolling across his skin, he saw the minor disappointment on Tony’s face. Tony tried to hide it but damn if he didn’t want the monumental climax he felt burning under his skin just barely out of reach. Bucky leaned down to devour Tony’s mouth before he leaned back with a cocky smile. “Oh sugar, I am nowhere new finished with you yet.”
perspective, okay? If Prince Anthony can't prove he's virtuous, he's automatically branded your whore Omega. The whole kingdom will look at him and assume the worst. I
"Good morning, your highness," she says cheekily as she comes in and closes the door. Her cheeks are pink and her eyes bright. "I trust you had a lovely heat?"
"Exactly. And it's even more than that. What do you suppose all those asshole Alphas are gonna want with an Omega Consort? Some young, pretty thing trained in all the ways to please an Alpha?"
"You think I'm a punishment for him." Steve's not surprised. He'd come to the same conclusion, himself. It would help explain Tony's reluctance to open up, his inability to relax. His general fear of Steve and this place – if he'd thought his father was sending him here as punishment, of course he would expect pain and mistreatment.
Clint stares at the basket for a long moment, then shrugs exaggeratedly and reaches for something covered in powdered sugar. "I'm gonna risk it."
Steve grins again, and this time it's almost conspiratorial. "We had a powerful wizard come through a few months back. We helped him out with a little problem, and as a thank-you gift, he charmed the garden to bloom through the winter. Not as useful as, say, boosting the harvest, but still a nice gesture."
Tony stares at him for a long moment, then slowly twists, rolling onto his stomach, pushing himself up onto his hands and knees and presenting himself.
Tony gives him a wan smile. He'd like nothing more than to launch into a diatribe about the unfairness of Omega property laws and Omega rights, but Barnes' eyes are sharp. Tony won't be caught badmouthing the Crown or the laws, not when he's surrounded by people he can't trust.
Tony cries out, mouth open wide as he gasps for air. His cock is rock hard, slapping his own belly as Steve fucks into him.
Pepper snorts, picking up a pitcher and filling it with bathwater. She uses it to rinse his hair. "You know exactly what to do, Tony. You aced all those classes."
, but he'd never been very good at the simpering, coy flirting that the Academy had tried to teach him. Sex is supposed to be
He'd learned something fundamental about sex when he'd been at the academy. The professors, mostly Betas, had told them that if there was something their Alphas did to their bodies, something specific, there was a good chance it was something they, themselves, enjoyed. If an Alpha concentrated on your nipples, then they likely enjoyed having their own nipples played with.
Natasha stands up from the table, quite suddenly, and moves into the little kitchen area and pulls two mugs from the shelves and a box of tea, and goes about – without discussing it with Tony
"Oh, I'm not here to dish out anything," Natasha says, idly running a finger over the side table as she makes her way around the room. They don't talk about it, and Steve doesn't acknowledge it, but he knows she's walking the perimeter to double check exits and escape routes before she sits down on the sofa across from him. It's her way, and he's well used to Natasha's ways by now.
"Aqueducts?" Steve purposefully keeps any judgement out of his voice. Honestly, it's not difficult – he really is curious as to what an aqueduct is.
Steve stared at him.
"Not even close," Steve tells her.
The note King Howard had sent had filled in the missing pieces of the puzzle when it came to Steve's new Omega Consort. The signing of the contract had finalized the deal – there needn't be any bonding ceremony. In the eyes of the law and the land, Steve and the Omega were officially bonded when Steve had signed that paper.
"Tony," Steve says, blinking. His cheeks flush and his eyes roam over Tony's chest and legs. Wilson, beside him, lets out a strangled noise and then averts his eyes back to the floor.
"It's not much," Steve says, holding the bouquet out. "But I thought this might be able to say what I'm struggling so much with."
Steve could bring. It out of him.
"I hope you didn't find it too boring here, without everyone," Steve says, eyes casting to the side. "I was wondering if you wanted to go for a walk? In the garden, maybe?"
"I don't think I understand," Steve says.
No, his
Tony studies him for a moment. "Alright." He starts to walk slowly toward a row of flowers, bushes and stalks planted in a manner that looks haphazard, but flows quite nicely.
"Doing my best!" Bucky tells him, heading off to direct the palace staff.
Steve rolls his eyes fondly as Clint flops on the sofa next to Bucky and butting up against the stump of his shoulder where Bucky had lost his arm in the war, the two Betas apparently incapable of sitting next to one another without making sure they have at least two points of contact between them at all times.
"And you told her it was unnecessary, right?"
Clint cringes a little, but Barnes continues to stare at him for a long moment.
Steve flipped his middle finger up in a rude gesture, almost on reflex. Bucky took it in stride, not even pausing.
"That's how it works," Steve tells him.

Pepper stares at him. Tony sighs.

rights, according to some of their lectures at the Academy. Of course, the professors had always told them about these outer provinces with an air of disgust, and all the Omegas in Tony's classes had nodded dutifully because yes, of course, Omegas don't
Tony stays in Steve's arms for a moment, enjoying the closeness. It's different than the closeness they've had over the last few days, but just as compelling, to Tony's mind.
– cheeks.
He'd known Steve had contracted with Howard. He'd known it was about more than just getting an Omega to bond. The food, of course, because of the harsh winter. But the soldiers. The ones who had come along with Tony and, now that he thinks about it, had not left the area and headed back to Starkland.
"Think he's a spy?" Bucky asks, still peering over Steve's shoulder.
Of course. Perfect fucking timing.
"Are you sure? I don't want you to feel obligated."
"Bruce is still here, and me. Everyone else has gone, though."
"I was bored, I needed something to entertain me," she says, taking a grape from the platter on the table. She pops it into her mouth, chewing slowly.
There's a fork slightly askew on the table, and Steve adjusts it nervously. He doesn't know
"Seriously, Buck, get it out of your system now."
Shit. He should have known better. He shouldn't have taken it all for granted – he'd cancelled on Steve, and he'd spent a week being an
"I'm doing this for the people. The villagers and the townspeople, the farmers and fishermen. For all of you. So we can survive this winter."
"Yeah, pal. I know."
He finishes taking Tony's pants off, then takes hold of Tony's ankles and slides his hands up that gorgeous smooth skin, up his legs to his thighs, to his hips and the lace again. Tony is watching him, breath coming fast.
"Yeah, Steve asked that Prince Anthony dine with him tonight." Wilson turns to Tony. "If that's okay with you?"
Rhodey turns away politely when Tony drops the towel, and Pepper helps him into the bodysuit. He pulls on a pair of form-fitting pants, then slides on a dark red shirt. The buttons are tiny, but he does them up deftly, then turns to present himself to Pepper.
He takes Steve's long, thick cock into his mouth, opening his throat and taking him as deeply as he can, pushing all the way down before sucking his way up, swirling his tongue around the smooth head, and plunging back down.
"Why wouldn't I want to do it?" Tony asks, still as confused as ever.
Bucky stares at him. "That exam is gonna be a hell of a lot easier on him than what's gonna happen if we don't do it."
"I've always had a soft spot for the little guy," Steve says with a twitch of a smile.
"I'm not mad," Steve blurts out. "Tony, no, I'm not mad."
"Me too, Tony," Steve says, eyes roaming all over Tony's face. Tony can feel it, but he can't quite meet the gaze. "I'm sorry about the poison oak, and thank you for teaching me about the flowers. It's nice to be able to… court you. A little. Before."
"Ah," Tony responds, not really sure how he's supposed to feel about that.
Their potential is plain for all to see
But they need the aid. So it doesn't matter how uncomfortable he is with it – with the possibility of the Consort spying on them, with the fact that he's contracting a bondmate, none of it.

"Oh."

of hot water pouring out of a tap in his own bathroom is heaven. To translate that to everyone in the kingdom – well, it'll take some work, but the subjects of America are used to their fair share of hard work.
Steve lets out a low huffing laugh anyway. "I'll leave Natasha with you," he says. "She'll keep an eye out, make sure you're okay."
Steve grabs a pillow from beside Tony's head and shoves it under his hips, and it's enough to angle him properly so that when Steve slides in, his cock puts pressure on Tony's prostate.
Tony hesitates.
"It's not like he stormed off in a huff, it was just… awkward."
"Yes, I'd heard that," Tony says, one corner of his mouth twitching, and the sparkle in his eyes draws Steve in like a magnet.
Now, he regrets it. He'd always sort of felt that Howard sending him to the Academy had been more punishment than anything else. Punishment for being an Omega. Punishment for Maria's death, for the death of his baby brother – though he'd had nothing to do with any of that.
The heat of him is glorious, hot and wet with just enough suction.
Or worse, had it been pity?
Somehow, Steve had memorized all the meanings Tony had been spouting off about down the row, and on their way back, had picked flowers that seem to sum up exactly what Tony never would have dreamed to hope for in a new bondmate.
"The rest of the kingdom
"I'm sure it will be fine," Prince Anthony tells him.
He blinks. Right. A vase. For the flowers. The bouquet of flowers in his hand he's still carrying.
He'd spoken to some of the other Consorts he'd gone to school with, and none of them seemed to know anything about America or its lord. Tony had asked the servants, he'd had Rhodey and Pepper ask around, and no one had anything to say about Lord Steven. There were rumours, of course. That Lord Steven had infiltrated and viciously killed members of the Hydra horde. That he had single-handedly defeated the Red Skull.
He could choose that light blue number with the lace, it would bring out the shape of his shoulders. But that little red set shows off his ass better.
Behind her, are several men and women. Mostly Betas, he thinks, though there might be an Alpha in the bunch. Rhodey is with them, too. Most of them have their arms full. Paper, drawing tools, pipes.
him that."
"Nothing. I'm sorry, that was… I'm sorry."
"He's a good spy, when he wants to be," she says. "He may not seem like it, but he picks up on a lot of little cues. He had you pegged right away, after all."
"Are you sure you don't want to get out? Stretch your legs?" Rhodey is already gathering up his coat and hat, wrapping a scarf around his neck.
Their victory hadn't gone unnoticed. Upon their return to Starkland, King Howard had beckoned Steve to sit court with him. He'd insisted that Steve be gifted with a kingdom of his own, and given him the lands of America. Only once Steve had made it to the old palace there had he begun to suspect that perhaps Howard had given Steve the status and lands of a lord under duress or political pressure. The province was struggling, the people tired and downtrodden. But Steve had worked hard, had done what he could to motivate and teach his subjects, until they were more self-sustaining.
"Right. Well, so there was that. I don't suppose it gave you the secret of immortality?"
Tony shrugs one shoulder, taking a bite of chocolate from the plate and biting into it. "It just made sense to me."
No, the problem is that he thinks he might actually
"Steve, hey," Sam answers, glancing up from what he's doing. "Didn't expect to see you tonight. Dinner go okay?"
"Do you like this shirt?" Steve asks against Tony's throat. Tony swallows, rolling his hips against Steve's. Steve can feel Tony's erection grind down against his.
"–And what kind of Alpha just

He wishes his mother were still alive – she probably would have convinced Howard not to send him out to the coast, to some shitty little fishing village and its so-called 'lord'. Hell, Maria might have even managed to convince Howard not to send Tony to the Academy at all.
Tony blinks. Yes, actually, he had mentioned that. It had been, for lack of a better word, pillowtalk.
"No, no, it's – better. It's okay, I have to talk to you." Steve sighs, and leads Tony back over to the bed. Tony's ass twitches, a bead of slick forming as he thinks of all the lovely things Steve had done to him in that bed.
"Maybe."
He stares around at his surroundings in shock.
"Hey," Pepper says, and Tony's mood change must have showed on his face because she looks concerned now. "What's wrong?"
"Hi," he says, stepping back to open the door wider and allow Tony entrance.

"How long have you had this?" he asks accusingly.
it because he'll never, ever be able to tell you."
Steve gives him a small, knowing grin. "Good. Because so do I. You feel so hot and tight, honey, I can't believe how good you feel."
She blinks. "Something else? Like what?"
"I'd love to," he says, nodding a bow to Clint and Barnes. "It was nice to meet you both."
She grins, helping him out of the bath and holding out a big, fluffy towel for him to dry himself. She uses another towel to roughly dry his hair, then heads back out to the main section of the room. Rhodey is sitting in an armchair, reading a book.
Tony's cock is soft and spent, but Tony is still moaning, whining and crying out with every thrust.
"I should have said," Steve growls, kissing his way down Tony's jaw, to his throat, sucking at the tender skin there. "I should have told you that morning, I should have told you the other day in the garden. You're beautiful, Tony, and I want you. I always want you, I just didn't want you to feel like you
"It's been a fine shirt," Tony gasps. "Served me well. Had it for years."
He watches her for a moment before speaking. "Why are you here?"
"I wanted – I wanted to talk to you," Steve says again, suddenly uncomfortable with the conversation. "About… something."
"I don't know what to do," Tony says.
"Look, I'm not saying that getting help from Howard was a
Steve leans forward, braces his hand on the middle of Tony's back to hold him down, and curls his other hand around Tony's shoulder to hold him close, to make sure that the force of Steve's thrusts don't push Tony away from him.
They turn another corner, and the isolated hallway has three doorways in it.
Who could totally super soldier-on.
The garden is like a completely different world. Where the rest of the countryside is white and cold with the snow, the square parcel of land behind the stone wall is green, lush, and warm. The sun shines overhead, even though Tony had
"You want to be Lord? With all the responsibility and the paperwork and the solving problems?" Steve asks, finally reaching forward and taking a pastry from the basket. Neither Bucky nor Clint is dead yet, it seems safe. Ish. "You go ahead, Clint. You can have it."
"I need your knot again," Tony says, sounding strained. "I need – I need you to fuck me."
Another rush of slick comes out when the muscle winks open, and Steve laps it up, licking his way eagerly into Tony's hole now. His tongue dips inside, and he starts to work Tony more open with it, thrusting and licking and sucking at the rim.
"Man, you get all the good things," Clint sighs theatrically. "You got all the enhanced muscles, you got the fancy castle, the kingdom, and now you're getting the mail order bondmate… Sometimes I really wanna be you, man."
, even Tony knows that.
"I know that," he answers, scowling. "I've done this before, you know."
The lace he'd already seen of Tony's undergarments is attached to the bottom, so it's all one gorgeous piece. Tony's cock is hard, bulging out of the lace obscenely, and it's longer than Steve would have guessed. It's tucked up against his hip, held there by the fabric, which stops at the top of Tony's thighs. As Steve pulls the pants down further and further, he finally gets to see some of that tantalizing bare skin, the muscular thighs and calves and even his shapely ankles. Tony's warm, golden skin looks beautiful in the lamplight. He's shaved all over, and Steve wants to touch the silkiness of it, the smooth, flawless skin. Tony hasn't scented himself, there's no cologne or perfume to mask his beautiful heat scent, and Steve feels another rush of arousal as his nose twitches, breathing Tony's heat musk in.
"Because they're here."
"Show you?"
"I'm sorry, my lord?" Prince Anthony looks entirely confused. Steve understands – he hadn't known it was going to come out of his mouth up until the moment it was already between them.

He knows some of his proclivities are, if not dangerous, at least unusual for an Omega. Technically, what he's doing isn't against the laws of the land. He can read whatever books he likes, learn whatever he wants to learn about engineering and science. He can draw his blueprints, come up with his mathematical theories, it doesn't matter.
," Clint argues. "We have beaches. People like beaches."
"So what's the big deal about the whole Omega Consort thing anyway?" Clint asks, wiping jelly-covered hands from his pastry over his shirt.
Wilson steps a little further into the room, guiding the group toward a door in the back of it. "Here's your bath, a small sitting room, storage." He glances at a clock on the wall of the room. "I'll leave you to freshen up now – dinner is in a little more than an hour."
He turns on his heel and heads for the gate, just barely managing to keep himself from running. God, he's an idiot.
"Hi," Tony says, subdued, as he steps through the door.
"It looks homey," Pepper says beside him. "Cheerful."
Sam snorts, leaning back. "Tell me about dinner, Steve."
"Please," Steve says. Tony expects him to offer an elbow for Tony to take, but he only gestures to the hallway, offering for Tony to precede him. "After you," he says.

No one has ever done anything so nice for him.
"The apothecary died," Steve says carefully. "While I was away at the war. I never got to – to thank him. He had only made the one potion, there wasn't anymore."
"What's that one?" Steve points to a round purple flower.
don't want to hear about it."
obligated," Tony says. "But I truly don't mind."
he's gonna make fun of me."
With a Herculean effort, Tony heaves himself up, swings a leg over so he can straddle Steve's lap, leaning down to kiss Steve. For once, Steve lets him lead the kiss, lets him decide the depth and speed. Tony takes his time, exploring that beautiful mouth leisurely. Steve shifts under him, and Tony is reminded of the somewhat insistent erection pressing against the inside of his thigh.
"Bonded to someone you've never met," Clint adds, and his voice is soft and understanding and sympathetic. It makes Steve want to leave the room, to rail against the unfairness of it all, to tear the contracts to shreds.
And Tony wants to. It's about more than giving Steve pleasure, making Steve feel as good as Tony feels. It's selfish, too — to have that kind of sway over Steve, to explore his beautiful body, to touch and taste him and make him come.
He goes for a long, hot bath, and he sleeps for 12 straight hours.
good, but he's gone."
"You live in America now," Steve tells him. "I may not be able to change the laws across the countryside, but I can do this. From now on, whenever you want to build something, or invent something, you can do it. I don't care if you're an Omega."
Natasha is watching him carefully, scrutinizingly, but she doesn't say anything more. Tony gets the feeling she's examining him, cataloguing his responses, reading his mind. He doesn't want her to know what's going through his head right now, though, so he takes another sip of his tea, changing the subject.
Steve's own knees want to give out, but he has to move slowly to make sure he doesn't hurt Tony – they're still locked together by his knot, after all.
"Don't think about the fact that he's an Alpha, that he's your Alpha. Think about
The lucky Omegas got out before they were ever sent to the programs.
"Do you like it?" he asks, and it comes out soft, like a murmur.
. He'll truly be going to his Alpha tonight.
But Steve is different, Tony knows. And Steve had done this for him, seemed to revel in it, to enjoy placing his mouth over Tony's hole and licking and sucking his way inside.
"Of course!" Tony says, voice too bright. "Of course I'm okay! I'm an Omega, I was
"Apologies, madam," Nat says, but Steve doesn't think she sounds all that sincere. "Natasha Romanoff. I'm a friend of Lord Steven's, I was just updating him on the news of the day."
A knock on the bedroom door startles them both, and Steve whirls around, breaking the spell.
"Tony, wait, wait, honey, it's too soon, I'll hurt you," Steve says, grabbing hold of Tony's hips to try to stop him, but god, he feels good – hot and wet and tight like a vise around him.
for this, to do this, to take–"
"I remember the way," Tony says, moving toward the door. "You don't have to."
. But It had been so
"Jesus," Tony breathes.
"What about right now?" Steve growls, reaching up and digging his fingers into Tony's hair, tugging it to expose more of his throat. "Do you want me to knot you like this, or should I turn you over and mount you properly?"
She tilts her chin down and gives him a
"No, I understand," Tony says, not quite meeting his eyes. He chooses his words carefully. "We both need space. We bonded, just like we were supposed to, and now, you…"
An Omega wouldn't be able to inherit the throne, according to the laws. Beyond that, a male Omega wouldn't be able to parent any children.
The words trail off when the young man comes up behind Rhodes. He's not as tall as Steve, and he's slim, but Steve can tell that his limbs are corded with muscle. He has thick dark hair that curls at the ends, and sharply trimmed facial hair that frames his beautiful, angular face.
. Because it would be entirely too awkward.

"But it's so – it's so
"Not you, too," Steve sighs, looking at her beseechingly. "I'm getting enough of this from Bucky, Clint and Sam. I was really hoping you wouldn't be dishing it out, too."
"He's not my

He opens the door, and Tony is standing in the hall, looking beautiful.

"Are you – are you hungry?" Steve says, trying not to scent the air. He wants to get closer, scent Tony's whole body, but that would be rude. "I have wine, if you'd like?"
"Well, I don't know!" Tony says, arms waving out to the sides wildly. "How am I supposed to know?"
"C'mere," Steve says, dragging Tony down into his lap anyway.
"All the more reason to do it, Tony."
+++++
"I'm your Omega Consort," Tony says, still staring down at the bedclothes. "By definition, that's exactly what I am."
Pepper moves in front of him, which is when he realizes he's pacing. She's holding an empty vase, and there's a strange expression on her face – like she's trying to hide a smile.
"It's okay, my lord, I deserve–"
Tony mostly hopes those ones aren't true. He's nervous enough about going into heat, about consummating with an Alpha, about being knotted for the first time. He doesn't need to think about some forearm-sized dick with a knot the size of his head.
indignity.
Steve has to agree with him, really. Sending Anthony Stark to him as his Omega bondmate is probably more of an insult than anything else. Steve had already been fairly certain that King Howard hadn't
"I'd love some, thank you," she says, giving him a tired smile.
Steve looks down at his hands in dismay, and Tony tries not to let his lips twitch up in a smile. Steve snorts, then looks abashed. "I'm… not very good at this, I guess."
"How are you?" Steve asks.
Tony doesn't need the reminder
Steve notices, though. "What's wrong with carnations?"
It's dark, almost black but with a wine-coloured sheen in the light. It's only one piece, more of a bodysuit than anything. The thighs are cut straight across, so it'll accentuate his muscular thighs, and leave more to the imagination when he turns around and shows his ass. It's a halter neck, and a deep V, and it will leave his back entirely bare, and leave him bare in the front to his navel.
Steve eyes him for another long moment before he finally lets go of Tony's wrist. He doesn't say anything else, though.
Tony thinks about the things he and Natasha had talked about while Steve had been gone. Her tales of her upbringing, her training. He silently agrees that they should have taken her. If even half her stories are true – and Natasha doesn't seem like the type to embellish such things – Natasha had come back several times in the interim, regaling Tony with stories of Steve – during the war with Hydra and after, his first days navigating his new power in the kingdom. The way he'd overhauled America's orphanages, made sure no one in the kingdom was going hungry, no matter how poor.
"Good choice," Pepper says, beaming at him.
"You'll do all the heavy lifting? I don't think I'm gonna be able to walk for a while."
But now, Steve is home and he's in Tony's hallway and, maddenly, keeping his distance.
"Yes, I do," Steve says. "Of course I do, Tony. I shouldn't have left you alone. I should have found a way."
Steve takes a grape and puts it in his mouth, follows it quickly with a little cube of cheese. After the fifth bite, Tony finally reaches forward and takes a blueberry and brings it to his lips.
"You're right, you are shit at it," Bucky agrees again. "These are good, what is this, raspberry cream?"
Steve's cheeks are pink, and his eyes dart down Tony's body and back up again. He swallows, and takes a half-step back into the hallway.
"It wasn't fair of me."
this, that he's been raised to think his pleasure, his comfort, is secondary and unimportant. But he needs to set Tony's mind at ease. "I don't know why they'd want to bond an Omega to that kind of Alpha in the first place, but that's probably why they told you it could hurt. But, Tony, I promise you, I don't want to hurt you."
"But America is a
with him?
to him. God.
"That's good," Steve murmurs, wrapping his arms around Tony and pulling him closer. He slides a hand down Tony's arched spine, slips his fingers between the cheeks of his ass and dips two into his slick, still-loose hole. Tony moans, and Steve's cock throbs.
"I see you've heard of it," she says with a knowing look. "I was placed in a training centre as a child, and I left a few years ago. I wandered into America, and Steve… has been good to me."
She wraps her arms around him, and Tony only now realizes how badly he'd needed a hug. He sinks into her arms, breathing in her sweet, soothing Beta scent.
his virtue intact. It makes you look the fool because Howard sold you a used Omega."
Tony blushes, to his own surprise, but then he bends down to his task. He licks softly at first, tasting the rough, tight skin. Steve moans above him, his hole twitching under Tony's tongue, so Tony licks harder, lips and sucks at the rim of Steve's entrance, working his tongue and lips gently until Steve's hole starts to relax, starts to open slightly under Tony's ministrations.
"I'll take you through this wing first – it's where I live, and where Bucky and Clint live – Bucky is the captain of the guard, technically, but he's been Steve's friend since they were small, and Clint is his bondmate. Ms. Potts and Captain Rhodes, we've set aside some rooms for you here."
"No," Bruce says, squirming uncomfortably. "No, that's not it. It was, um, about a – an exam? A virtue exam?"
"If you and Ms. Potts are looking for company, most days everyone gathers in the main dining hall for supper," Steve tells Rhodes. "Or you can take supper in your rooms if you prefer. Just stop by the kitchens and let them know."
Tony's legs splay wide desperately and he cants his hips back. Steve groans at the sight, of Tony's ass cheeks spread, of his slick hole gaping open and pink, waiting for Steve's knot to fill it.
"Oh, god," Tony moans, ass clenching around Steve's cock. Steve nestles his nose into the back of Tony's neck, scenting him and breathing him in, even as his other hand drags itself up to Tony's nipple, pinching and rolling the little brown bead between his fingers. Tony writhes, bringing one arm up behind his head to card his fingers through Steve's hair.
"It's going to be
Tony loses himself in kissing Steve, in tasting his mouth and lips, feeling the slick slide of Steve's plush tongue against his. He's wet again, can feel slick dripping between his legs, and his cock is hard between them. He moves to pull away, to shift his hips so he's not rubbing against Steve's hip, but Steve holds him still, rubbing Tony's cock against the sweat-slick flesh.
"Ah," Tony says. This, he understands. He's used to the curious stares and gawking when people realize they're in the presence of a Consort. That kind of attention, he can handle.
Their kingdom needs to be ready for war.
no Omega Consort would read anything more than a few romance novels, cookbooks and 'how to please your Alpha' instructional books, oh no. But he's gone through everything easily accessible in the coach.
"I want you to know," Steve says before trailing off, turning and taking a few more strolling steps down the path. Tony keeps pace with him. "I want you to know that you can have your own space. You don't… you don't owe me anything. I don't want you to feel like you're, you're obligated. Or anything."
"I know that, Steve.
Steve moves in his sleep, tightening his arms around Tony's body, and Tony likes this, too. The feeling of being possessed, of belonging, of being Steve's, more than anything else.
"Sweet pea," Tony murmurs, not quite able to meet his eyes. "Departure after having a good time." He swallows. "I had a nice time, today."
he is. His eyes had lit up, and he'd been funny and sweet and interesting. As soon as he'd let his guard down, Steve's stomach had swooped, and he hadn't been able to take his eyes off his Omega.
Tony looks at him expectantly.
"I'm fine," Tony says, heart sinking at the distance Steve is putting between them. "How was your trip?"
Steve gives him a puzzled look.
He reaches a hand up, task hold of Steve's cock, of his big, beautiful knot, and starts to stroke. He keeps his grip firm, stroking root to tip as Steve cries out under him. Tony licks and sucks and thrusts his tongue deep inside, grips his hand around as much of Steve's knot as he can and rubs hard, squeezing the sensitive knot, and Steve lets out a howl, hips jerking and hole spasming around Tony's tongue as he comes, cock spurting thick white fluid over Steve's chest and stomach, pooling in the dips of his muscle.
"You have me," Steve promises, back to kissing Tony's mouth. His hands pull at Tony's clothes, trying to undress him, but Tony keeps getting in the way by pulling and tugging at Steve's own.
Steve laughs, and Tony grins down at him, and that's the sight Steve had been missing all evening – Tony's eyes sparkling, lines crinkling at the corners with the smile.
"Part of the selling point for getting an actual Consort, instead of just any Omega, is the lessons they're taught there," Steve says. "Navigating the politics of the kingdoms, negotiating with other rulers, planning and maintenance of the palace, the whole bit. There's a list of their curriculum in one of those piles."
The ugly thought makes Tony frown. Steve's been nothing but nice to him, and Tony needs to remember that. Even if Steve had taken off as soon as Tony's heat had broken.
"No," he agrees, eyes on the floor. "It's not."
Well, better men than
Tony doesn't know what to say. Anything complimenting her strength or resilience would only sound trite.
Tony feels his stomach sink, feels his skin crawl with the shock of understanding. He'd known he'd been nothing but currency to Howard. That Howard was bonding him to the Alpha in America so he'd have his claws back in the little kingdom.
It's Steve's second day back by the time he seeks Tony out – he knocks on Tony's door in the middle of the afternoon. Some part of Tony betrays him and hopes Steve will shoulder his way through the door and take him there, in his own bed.
Tony stares at the cake for a long time, not even moving to eat any of it when Steve starts in on his own. It's heavy and sweet, with some kind of jelly in the centre of it.
"I just – I just mean, you didn't have to do that. But you did, you did it for me, and I was an
Tony blinks – he wouldn't have expected Barnes to be perceptive enough to sniff out the little white lies.
Wilson leaves the room, then, closing the door softly behind him.
Steve blinks down at his bouquet. "So you're saying the yellow carnations convey a message."
"It doesn't even make sense! He's a Consort – he's been taught to – of
"But what if they're poisoned? What if this is King Howard's way of getting this land back?"

him here.
"So are you," Steve says, smiling.
Steve watches him sleep until his knot shrinks enough for him to move, and then he gently pulls a blanket over them both and settles in to doze himself.
Steve settles on his elbows and leans down to kiss him, gently, on his closed eyelids, and wait for his knot to subside enough that he can pull out.
Tony picks up the pace before too long, thrusting down onto Steve's lap hard and fast, bucking wildly. He cries out every time he drops down, and his cock is leaking pre-come all over Steve's belly.
"Yes," Tony says, swallowing. "Yes, I'm yours."
And he wants this gorgeous Omega to want him back just as much. He wants Tony mewling and crying under him, begging for Steve's knot, desperate and wild and ruined for everyone else.
Tony blinks at her. "What?"
Sam is feeding Redwing, his favourite of the hawks, little bits of meat and stroking his feathers.
Tony blinks. "Clint?"
Tony's limbs are weak and nearly useless, his whole body giving in to whatever Steve wants from it.
I had a lovely heat? What's that supposed to mean?" He feigns confusion even as his own cheeks pink – albeit for different reasons.
"I wasn't at the Academy," she interrupts. "I'm from Krasnyygorod."
"I think King Howard doesn't have enough regard for him to bother with anything so invested as 'punishment'," Natasha says.
to, if you don't want to."
Bucky grimaces, pushing the mouthful of pastry he's chewing to the inside of his cheek so he can talk. "Clint thinks he found tracks down at the south end of Liberty Beach."
"I know honey, I know it's a lot but you're doing so good, that's it," he croons, and Tony sobs out a breath of air, and his cock spurts a trickle of come between them.
Tony wakes late, to a knock on his door. He's still dressed from the night before, but there are pages of drawings and equations spread out all over his bed. He hastily shuffles them into a pile, throwing the blanket over them to hide them. He moves toward the door, opening it slowly and peering out into the hallway.
Tony tears his mouth away, and Steve has enough decency to let him go, to drop his hands and let Tony stand up off the sofa. Tony stands before him, cheeks flushed, hair wild, and lips red and swollen from Steve's rough treatment of them.
Steve rears back. "What?
+++++
On the third morning, Tony wakes slowly, confused. He's in Steve's bed, which is unsurprising. What
Steve glances back at the sofa over by the fireplace, and lets one of Tony's hands drop to his side. He holds onto the other, though, lacing their fingers together and tugging Tony toward the sitting area. "Come sit down," he says.
"I want to talk to him," Steve says again.
"It's… it'll be okay, Tony," Pepper says, not sounding at all sure. "Really, I'm sure it's just… it's not…" She stops. "They don't have running water, no. But it looks like the staff has already started your hot bath so I guess I'll just, um, fill the tub? With the water?"
Tony.
Tony sighs happily, burrowing into the bedding. His hand slides down Steve's arm, and he laces his fingers with Steve before he falls asleep.
"Come on, come on," Tony says, grinning as he moves to help Steve finish stripping, then straddles his hips and leans down to kiss him again.
"It's not that far," Wilson says. "Steve never was very good at keeping his distance from his family."
"I just – I wanted to talk to you. May I come in?"
The lace over his ass is dark and damp with slick, the fabric stretched over plump, round globes. The lingerie is backless, giving Steve more beautiful skin to stare at. Tony's thighs are twitching, muscles in his back bunching and rolling as he moves into position.
"So what's wrong with my bathtubs?" he finally asks.
Wilson shows Pepper and Rhodey their rooms, and Tony has to admit he's impressed. They're not richly furnished or anything, but they're large and aboveground, which is more than he can say for the rooms Howard had allowed them at home. Tiny, dusty, dank little closets, those had been.
In fact, Steve can't stop looking at him for long enough that it begins to get incredibly awkward.
"Yeah, yeah, do it, knot me, fuck, please," Tony is gasping, and Steve is so close, he can feel his balls drawing up, feel his cock throbbing and pulsing on the edge of his orgasm.
"Thank you, your highness," Ms. Potts says, and Steve looks between them, and at Rhodes, for a moment before he stands.
"I'm gonna die here," Tony moans, slurring. "I'm gonna die here 'n it's gonna be great."
Not completely understanding but to turned on to ask any questions, Tony didn’t fight Bucky at all as the man pushed Tony’s face toward his erection. He licked his lips as he stared at what he wanted so close, but couldn’t make himself move to take it. It wasn’t until he heard Barnes say, “Go on baby, show me how much you want it,” that he finally took the head into his mouth with a satisfied moan. “Yeah, that’s it sweetheart take me down. You’re being so good for me.”
Tony stared at Bucky, his own blame for the present circumstances adding fuel to the spark of anger he felt rising up as Steve left. Tony may have whispered his next words, but he spoke with enough aggression that he may as well have been yelling. “Are you out of your mind?” He stood and continued railing into Bucky while the other man just smirked conceitedly back at him. “This is completely your fault and now you want to drag Steve through the grinder to what exactly? You want to prove how much better in bed you are than him? Want to prove you can make me cum harder than he does? None of that matters Bucky, I still love him and I won’t leave him for you. I won’t hurt him just to boost your,
The team never actually had planned to move in to the Tower, it just sort of happened. At first they’d just crash after coming home staff-less, needing to go back to the drawing board and regroup. Then they were staying over whenever they were nearby or crashing a few days since they knew at least one other Avenger would be there for company. Before they knew it, all their clothes and belongings were in the Tower. When Tony mentioned it to them, most just shrugged it off, Clint’s being the funniest as he gave a stunned look saying, “Fuck… Didn’t even realize… The hell am I payin’ rent for? Tash remind me to get rid of my apartment. I haven’t even been there in like, months.”
Clint huffed out a laugh saying, “Only workout that relaxes me is sex, and its
Tony Stark was destined to be alone forever.
his fault.
Tony groaned inwardly as he quickly removed his hand. He increased his efforts, arms wrapping around Bucky’s legs pulling him deeper into Tony’s mouth.  “You might be right, I’ll go look up some others and see what I can find.” Tony reached to palm Bucky’s balls in his hand causing the cock in his mouth to pulse. “Have you seen Tony, he might know of some better ones.”
Tony turned to curl his body into Steve’s as he snorted saying, “We’ll live, pretty sure no one’s died from blue balls yet.” When Steve’s face came up from hiding and looked at Tony, his expression was curious before it became very red and embarrassed. “What?” Tony asked wanting to know what brought about those looks.
After that, he knew he’d be fine sharing his boyfriends with each other.
In a matter of minutes, Steve was gone leaving Tony alone with the man wreaking havoc to his wellbeing. Having thankfully removed his feet from Bucky’s lap when he sat up, Tony just leaned his back to the couch keeping their distance. It was already bad enough he was going to be alone with Bucky for days. Being near him right now while he was still trying to compose himself would be even worse. He would have left entirely if it wouldn’t have been rude. Normally he wouldn’t have cared about that, but for Steve he needed to make Bucky feel welcome.
“Of course, attention junky here, needing attention,” Tony deadpanned as he looked up tiredly at Steve giving him puppy dog eyes. Pointing at his shoulders he told Steve, “I specifically need attention here.”
Bucky raised his leg to straddle over Steve’s waist, positioning himself right behind Tony on top of Steve. Tony raised an eyebrow in questioned concern looking back. “You’re going to take care of me to right? I need it Bucky, you haven’t… stretched me since yesterday. Steve tries but he can’t… he can’t push in deep like you do in me.”
As Steve’s orgasm rolled over him, he felt bad that he didn’t even try to hold back. Steve knew he could have staved off the climax, but Tony’s mouth suckling around him always felt like a heaven Steve was nowhere near saint enough to deny. Usually he’d have to wait a few moments to get himself back together before taking care of Tony, so Steve was grateful he had Bucky there to help Tony as he basked in the glow of his orgasm. Still shaking slightly he bent down to kiss Tony’s mouth, tasting a little of his release there when he did. “I’m sorry baby, I love your lips around me too much. I just couldn’t make myself pull back.” Looking up to where Bucky had stilled inside of Tony and looked to him in question, Steve kissed Tony’s forehead before he continued to say, “Bucky’s gonna take care of you though. You both look so beautiful together and I would love to see him make you cum. Is that okay honey?”
