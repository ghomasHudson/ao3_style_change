“I expect you not to pay any attention to my comings and goings.”
“Champagne and a snack.” He reached up for two small cups and a plate.
“Sherlock!” she cried and pulled him into a long hug, “It’s been too long, dear.”
John stood by his side, looking out at men at the bar, and said, “Well done detective.”
“I can’t tell you how fucking sexy it is that you don’t wear pants,” John murmured, while Sherlock lifted his hips, allowing John to pull off his trousers with one fluid motion.
(See the end of the chapter for
John said, “Who.”
“I only stopped doing that because I got hurt,” John said, and looked down, “and lost someone very important to me.”
He thought back to the pub where he had kissed the green-eyed Jack. He thought about how beautiful and shy he was. He thought about the conversation they had, the kiss they had shared. He remembered that for one fleeting moment during his kiss with Jack, he worried about the smell of his breath. He’d smoked a few cigarettes that day, a passing almost-habit he acquired because of his job at the time. He didn’t want to put Jack off, but he figured the beer and time had erased his ashtray mouth. He’d worried, but Jack hadn’t seemed to notice.
"Sutble," Donovan teases, John rolls his eyes, but surprisingly doesn't get annoyed at the woman.
"Why would Sherlock say something like that? Wouldn't that cause you not to go, more than anything else?" Molly asks, and John shuffles in his seat as Mycroft gives the girl a pointed look.
"Wouldn't it have been easier to look for a book that they would both have and go from there, removing all the books that no one would have?" Mycroft asked, finally speaking without the usual arrogance.
"I'm pretty sure we saw that," Anderson commented with a nod.
“I really hope he can open that safe,” Anderson muttered to himself, hoping that Sherlock had picked up on something that the screen or whatever didn’t.
Anderson frowns in confusion but doesn't bother asking, knowing they'll probably just laugh at him.
"But that's why it's so clever, it would be harder for a local to figure it out," Lestrade also pointed out.
--3rd P.O.V.--
“Guess he changed his mind,”
"A bit like you then," Mrs. Hudson replied, smiling slightly at him to make sure he knew that she was joking.
“That would be hilarious,” Anderson laughed, along with almost everyone in the room.

Everyone laughs at the past John, expect the present John who shuffled in his seat, looking extremely uncomfortable and blushing.
"HEY!" The Yarders call out, but deep down, some deeper than the others (*cough*Sally*cough*) can't help but agree at his words.
"Oh Sherlock" Mrs Hudson sighs, staring at the boy who was like a son to her. Wishing she could find some way to go back in time and help him before things become to late.
"Mycroft literally introduced himself as Sherlock's greatest enemy, and you're just now realizing it?" Anderson questioned, John flushed slightly.
Everyone frowned, worried for Henry, feeling pity for the poor male who had been tormented all his life, by his own mind.
"High functioning sociopath," Anderson, John, Lestrade, Molly and Mrs Hudson almost immediantly correct her, speaking in unsion, give or a take a couple seconds.
"When did the freak ever start looking for the pin? I thought he was just looking for the murderer," Donovan asked.
A few people snort at John still being in denial after all this time. Much to the doctor’s annoyance.
“Does this have to do with Sherlock acting cheerful earlier?” Molly questioned curiously.
"Miss Riley, if my brother really was the master mind behind all this, then why would he set up a meeting without any other witnesses?" Mycroft questioned in that tone reserved espically for idiots.
"Oh so that's how he figured it out," Lestrade muses thoughtfully.
Chuckles fill the room at the two’s confused looks.
"Why wouldn't he be?" Lestrade asks, almost curiously.
Once again, everyone laughs at Sherlock’s joke, glad that the two of them was okay.
"Damn I was hoping we would find out how he did that." Donovan muttered and John sent yet another glare at her.
"Apparently not,"
"Who would want to hang out with the freak anyway?" Donovan commented, frowning slightly when everyone sends annoyed glares at her but no one sent any to Molly.
A few people laughed, hoping that he was joking.
"Ohh, so that's what you forgot..."
Transcript: Arainedevere
John growled, his eyes narrowing as he sees the two figures, hatred burning in his eyes, a similar reaction happened with Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson, thought Mycroft was less obvious. Molly, and Lestrade all tense up, their eyes filled with distrust, laced with hatred, Anderson had the same reaction as Molly and Lestrade just less feeling. While Donovan was only slightly on guard.
A few people chuckled, more at Sherlock insulting himself than anything.
"No," John confirmed, smiling slightly that Donovan was finally beginning to see. While Kitty huffed, still not convinced.
“Because if Sherlock lost his temper, then it had to be for a good reason,” Lestrade defended himself. “And it was,” He added nodding to the screen.
"He was just trying to annoy him," John replies, a soft smile on his lips.
"Don't call him a freak!" John snaps, as he settles down a little causing the chains to loosen.
"You two really are children," Mycroft sighed as he spoke.
"He didn't" John replied.
“I forgot how weird that was,” Lestrade muttered, frowning at the white words appearing on the screen once again.
--3rd P.O.V.--
"Whose suitcase is that?" Molly almost whispered, as if she was afraid of the answer.
"Sherlock never trusted any of the police members," Lestrade answered, with a slight glare towards Donavan and Anderson. It was people like them that made it hard for Sherlock to trust them completely.
"Maybe because it's not true!" John hissed, and open his mouth to speak. But was cut off by Mycroft.
For those who actually liked Sherlock, they all frowned, worried for the genius as he gets more and more panicked.
Everyone winced when the alarm was hit. Everyone was either wondering how they got out, or worrying that they didn't. Or both.
"We did see it," Mycroft confirmed.
Everyone laughs at John. "And you wonder why everyone thinks your together," Lestrade can't help but tease. John sinks down in his chair, blushing slightly while Molly frowns.
"No wonder he is so agitated," Anderson mused, a few humming in agreement and sympathy. Though those who actually liked Sherlock, smiled proudly.
A couple of people scream slightly at the sudden appearance of Sherlock.
"Yes but John's well, John, Sherlock is always treating him nicer," Molly points out sadly, as John blushes slightly.
The Yarders, and Mycrfot both blink in shock at seeing Irene’s most prize procession in Sherlock’s hand.
Everyone, expect Mycroft of course, laughs as Amanda runs around the office.
Mrs Hudson smiled warmly as John walked up to her. His eyes glazed over from the tears he was desperately trying to keep in. Black bags hung under his eyes, dried tear tracks streaking through them. John sniffled slightly before nodding over to the gate of the cemetery. While John tried to keep himself together, to remain tough, Mrs Hudson let her emotions show, though she didn't cry. Together they walked away, leaving the new shiny black tombstone behind, Sherlock's gravestone.
"What did he expect, for Westie to just forget about the plans?" Donovan critics.
"He's not actually going to take that... is he?" Lestrade asks, almost worried. He doesn't get an answer, or at least not a worded one. But as John hang his head sadly, well that was answer enough.
A few people sighed as Sherlock breaths in the smoke. Especially when he was trying to quit.
The officers, all snort as John answers for Sherlock, thinking that they really are a lot like a couple.
"Yeah," John admitted. "Though he's fine now," He quickly added, not wanting to worry anyone.
"You're getting really good at that," Molly comments happily. John flushes slightly and grins back at her, feeling proud of himself.
"Wouldn't you?"
"How did you know where he would be, we only just moved in," John asks, finally releasing it.
"I've never seen a sky so clear in London," Molly muses.
"Not this again," John mutters, and the others snigger slightly, remembering Sherlock's previous outburst.
"Umm... I would say the next big case, which I'm guessing are just cases that involve Moriarty, would be The Blind Banker," John replied after a second or two in thought.
"Isn't that a good thing?" Kitty questions.
"You seem sure that they would accept your case," Kitty starts, "Sherlock refused, twice, he doesn't strike me as the kind of man who changes his minds," She adds.
“I guess you’ll see,” Mycroft answered, not feeling like explaining himself.
“What’s that noise?” Anderson questioned in shock, his eyes wide. Donovan and Kitty both frown in confusion as well as him. While those who know what it was don’t answer.
"You are overdramatic,"
"Why doesn't Dimmock believe him?" Molly asks, her faith in Sherlock neither wavering.
“No,” They commented at the same time. Causing Mycroft to huff, though he didn’t speak.
Mycroft sighed, even if he already knew Sherlock used his badge. It was still annoying and embarrassing that Sherlock had it in the first place.
Everyone but Donovan, Mycroft and John frown at the man, Donovan because she had a smirk glad that someone was listening to her warning, Mycroft cause he's like a robot and John who chuckled slightly, remembering him. Everyone else's glares turned confused as they heard John's light chuckle.
Moly frowned as she watched Henry changing the channel. Never having thought about how Henry’s fear could change his everyday life. Yet now she can’t stop thinking about it.
"I feel sorry for you, dealing with Sherlock is enough," Anderson muttered as he shook his head.
"That's why he doesn't eat?" Lestgrade asks in shock, only knowing that Sherlock doesn't eat while working.
Everyone chuckles as this, and Dimmock's annoyed expression.
John huffs at that, silently wondering if all this time he had just been a fill in for that blasted skull or someone of actual importance to Sherlock. John is pulled out of his thoughts as he hears the Yarders soft chuckles at Sherlock's words.
"Did you?" Kitty questioned curiously.
"Figured out what?" Molly asks curiously.
yet, but he defiantly would be." John answered.
Everyone sighed, feeling sympathy for Henry. Especially since they didn't understand why Sherlock would do that.
“No one would give you a medal for killing Sherlock,” John found himself grumbling quietly to himself with a glare.
"He really is a freak, what's with him sniffing everything anyway?" Donovan asks, and just like every other time that she has opened her mouth, John glares at her.
"NO COME ON!!!" The Yarders yell, throwing their hands up.
"Why did you steal the receipt?" Lestrade questioned curiously.
A few people, mainly Mrs Hudson, sighed at Sherlock having no tact whatsoever.
“Sherlock throws Neilson out of a window doesn’t he?” Molly questions, John nods in answer and Molly sighs, though she still had a smile on her face.
“How the hell is he going to get back in?” Anderson questioned in shock. “You two barely got out last time,” Worry slipped into his voice.
Anderson and Donovan laughs slighly, as Lestrade.... faints which causes everyone else to laugh.
"Seems like it,"
"Whoever sent that message wanted someone to see it, my brother was trying to figure out who it was for," Mycroft snapped back, really starting to get annoyed at these people.
"JOHN! couldn't you have been just a bit more consderate, he is being strangled!" Mrs Hudson scolded, lightly smaking the back of the doctors head. John sheepishly smiles back at them.
Mycroft sighs at the sight of Sherlock rescuing Irene, knowing full well that this means that she wasn’t dead.
Everyone winces, at the sight of the security breach alert. Even more worrying filling them as they are now actually caught.
"Why is he taking the case?" Anderson questioned in shock. Feeling a little bit of whiplash from how quickly Sherlock just accepted.
"When did you expect he would come?" Molly asks.
"I thought he said the hound wasn't real?" Molly whispered in terror.
"You just figured that out?" Lestrade commented with a snort.
--3rd P.O.V.--
"Since he met John," Said doctor blushed heavily at this comment.
"What? It's a perfectly reasonable conclusion," Malcroft responds, his chin held up high. Everyone else rolls their eyes at him when they remember
Lestrade mentally sighed in relief. Glad that he wasn't the only one who got his badge stolen.
Mrs Hudson squeezes John's hand tighter and Molly looks over at her friend. As if making sure he was really there.
"No wonder Sherlock is always so annoyed at us, between the scene with the words and this, if the cases aren't made up, then how isn't he snapping at every word they say?" Anderson exclaimed, though John did glare slightly at the middle part.
“Yes, this is definitely a horror movie,” Donovan agreed, just slightly terrified. As she never did well with those types of movies.
"Seriously! Is anyone else creeped out by her?" Donovan yelled in annoyance. Molly, and the other yarders all hum in agreement while the other's pretty much just roll their eyes.
Everyone, espically John flinched at the sight of Sherlock standing on a ledge.
"He didn't hear a word of that did he?" Lestrade asked, John chuckled slightly and shook his head.
“Yep,” John answered in a clipped tone.
A few people smile at Mrs Hudson tearing into Mycroft, figuring that Mycroft deserved it. While Mycroft sighed.
“The sad thing is, you haven’t,” Lestrade pips up with a sigh, wondering where this is going.
"Who knows," Lestrade answered with a huff.
"At least Sherlock, is disappointed that he's following
"You'll see," John muttered not wanting to keep having to explain everything.
A few people silently prayed that Sherlock and John would get there quickly. Worried about what Henry would do, and what could happen to him.
A few people sighed at the lost look on Sherlock’s face, feeling bad for him.
"Why did he swipe the beer?" Donovan questioned in confusion. Before coming to the realisation when he moves towards Fletcher.
A couple of people snort at the exhange between the two and Lestrade shrugs at the confused looks people send him.
“Despite seeing Sherlock figure it out, I still have no idea what exactly he figured out,” Molly admitted.
"Why does Sherlock think that 'Syphilis and Local Contagious disorders' is a book that everyone has?" Anderson asks, no one, not even Mycroft could respond to that.
Everyone frowns as Irene tranquilers Sherlock, while John sighs guilty, wishing he hadn't left Sherlock alone with her.
Sherlock checking his watch just made everyone even more anxious as they focused more on the amount of time that had passed.
Any and all of their grins disappear as they see the woman, their humor at John fading into sadness and guilt. John and the police officers suddenly wishing that they could go back into time and solve them earlier so the hostages didn't have to suffer.
"I guess the solar system is imporant after all," Lestrade couldn't help but joke. Everyone with a humor laughed.
A few people frowned at Mycroft’s look of despair, wincing at Sherlock making everything worse.
“No clue, but I think it’s like the words,” Donovan replied. “You know, so it’s easier to follow what they’re saying,”
“You shouldn’t litter Mycroft,” Mrs Hudson chided, to an expersated Mycroft.
"Could that be anymore awkward?" Molly giggles causing John to grumble once again.
"You know, if I didn't know Sherlock, I would think he was actually embrassed," Lestrade muses, as he stares at Sherlock.
John looked straight into his eyes and watched Sherlock watch him slide his lips over the tip of his hardening cock. Sherlock gasped, his hands tightening in John’s hair. He kept his hips still and John moaned because he loved the feeling of Sherlock’s huge hands on his head.
John still couldn’t hear anything. He walked up to Sherlock, pulled off that ridiculous cap, and placed both hands tightly over his ears. Sherlock stilled and looked gratefully down at John.
Sherlock was struck with an unfamiliar twinge of self-consciousness. John was the only one who could make him feel unsure but not defensive. No one else ever bothered to criticize or correct him to his face. This was one of John’s many admirable traits that allowed Sherlock to trust him enough to make him his friend. His best friend. Enough to make him fall in love.
Let’s start over here. He pointed towards a curb and a low concrete barrier. John liked the way the street lamps enhanced the shine of Sherlock's irises.
“John?”
I nodded to the plates. “I see my timing is excellent this morning. Not always the case, I’m afraid.” I thought of being at home last night when John returned with his date. If I had known, I’d have left much sooner. I looked at him and scanned the rooms but couldn’t see anything that would tell me what time John’s date had left. He seemed in good spirits. I assumed he’d gotten a leg over.
Sherlock splashed about in the warm water, looking back at the beach every few moments to look at John. He was too far away to have a conversation, but close enough that Sherlock could see the details of his face and body. The water and air were almost the same temperature. The sunlight warmed his skin. It was erotic. The way the sea and sun licked at his erection. Warm, wet, and his cock thickened further. He giggled, he could still feel champagne bubbles on his tongue. It was absurd. He was standing in the ocean, on a public beach, in America, with a hard on.
“Well, now, what brings you here?”
Sherlock had quite enough of the string of undignified, yet strangely affecting, pet names.
“Dinner?”
When he mentioned to Molly that he wanted to get John a small gift and listed all of the things that John liked (well, not
He smirked and waved a hand towards me. “‘Night, Sherlock.”
“Really?” Victor’s face lit up with excitement.
Sherlock and John fit together, interlocking, with no space inbetween.
“Well?”
Sherlock looked down at his thickening cock. “Couldn’t you guess that I’m a bit of an exhibitionist?”
Sherlock moved one hand to the back of his head to press their lips more firmly together. John noticed that Sherlock had slightly bent his knees so that they were a similar height. The other hand moved down to cup John’s arse. With one squeeze of each hand, Sherlock pulled them closer. John could immediately feel Sherlock’s erection pressing into his as their hips aligned.
“I’ll just.” Sherlock waved to the counter and said, “Can I get you anything?”
If John was fishing for a compliment, Sherlock didn’t take the bait.
“What’s your name?”
Sherlock turned his back to Mycroft and crowded into John’s personal space. “I want to go home, John. Will you come with me?”
“What happened at the other location?”
“Sherlock!”
on Tumblr.
Sherlock just kept sweeping his long fingers along the nape of John’s neck, into the hairs on the back of his head. John hummed with satisfaction. They were quiet for a few minutes. Sherlock’s shoulders started shaking a bit. John startled that maybe he was weeping, but why would that be? Confused, he looked up at Sherlock’s giggling face.
doing here?”
John moaned and Sherlock looked up at him. John watched with want etched on every feature and lust in his eyes.
Sherlock’s head swam. John hadn’t let him finish his reassuring thoughts...on second thought, maybe admitting that he thought McGregor was good-looking would not be reassuring at all.
“C’mon, I don’t want to to go back, but they’ll be wondering where we are.”
They stood chest to chest, tension thick between the half-metre space between them. Sherlock’s ire, John’s silent strength, and their mutual attraction connected them and manifested in an unblinking, intense stare into one another’s eyes.
Sherlock rolled his eyes as Lestrade left the room.
“I didn’t start to worry until a couple of days later. I hadn’t heard from him. I started asking around and no one had seen him. I talked with his agent. My research revealed that one other model from the same agency had disappeared over the last ten years. It’s only one...but maybe there were others but they were orphans like Noah?” He blew out a breath and lowered his face into his hands.
John smiled, “Yes, I noticed.”
In the morning, I re-entered 221B with a renewed purpose. I would deny and depress my transport. I would rely on my sociopathic tendencies. A balance must be struck between cold detachment and providing excitement. If he found me barely tolerable, he would stay.
(See the end of the chapter for
Ultimately, it took over three months from that day for Sherlock to make his way back to London. Love or not, he had to dismantle Moriarty’s web for the safety of the world and his friends. His best friend.
The hair on John’s arms and neck stood up. He knew it could turn out to be nothing, but it didn’t feel like nothing.
“The damned bird, John.”
Sherlock set the pace very slow at first. Then he increased the tempo so he was bouncing in John's lap. He used his powerful thigh muscles to lift his arse off of John's cock then lower him back down with a slap. The force of the movement had the delicious effect of slapping his frenulum against John's stomach with every bounce.
“John.”
“I’m glad they’ve landed on their feet,” John said a few minutes after Sherlock had showed him the story.
John crossed his arms across his chest and quirked the ends of his lips upwards in a menacing half-smile. He glared and said, “We’re going there.”
(See the end of the chapter for
John shifted his weight and pulled out of Sherlock’s body. Sherlock adjusted to the emptiness quickly as John moved off of the bed to get them a flannel. Sherlock grabbed his arm and pulled him back down.
With wide eyes, she said, “All right, please give me one minute.” She quickly left through a side door and another tall beautiful woman came out.
Sherlock heard John go from the bathroom to their bedroom, banging around a bit in the wardrobe.
In his lowest voice, he said, “Of course I’m not jealous.”
“Stop yelling. You’re white as a sheet. Sit down.” John got up and held his hand out to try to soothe over Sherlock’s arm.
“It’s Detective Inspector Lestrade.”
John grunted and pressed his hips forward and said, “Yours.”
“True,” he said, smiling wider. “I might have done them more often if I knew how stimulating it was for you.”
Sherlock loves a good cocktail. Fruity, savory, strong, fizzy, citrusy. He doesn't care. As long as it's made with pride and fresh ingredients, he's all about it.
“All right, it was me,” John said, and poked Sherlock in the ribs.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sherlock! Jesus,” he shouted, “You dick, I can perform just fine. I’m perfectly healthy and functional, you arsehole.” He rubbed both hands over his eyes then ruffled them through his hair. “It’s not that. It’s that she didn’t like me so she left.”
“John, your cock is enormous.”
“Were you expecting me to argue?”
I woke, gasping and desperately hard, on my stomach, thrusting into the mattress. There was a sticky patch on my sleep trousers where I had almost experienced an unconscious nocturnal completion for the first time since adolescence. Turning over, I immediately palmed my erection and shuddered. My god, what had John Watson done to me?
John deflated. He didn’t seem angry anymore, “You idiot. I was deflecting. In denial. I was a stupid, stupid man. It’s one thing for me to be an idiot, but you. You must be blind, love.” John smiled around the endearment and Sherlock decided to smile back, shocked into silence by that word.
“Your face is red.”
John learned about Sherlock’s interest in chemistry that began when he was only six years old. Only in Uni did he start to have recreation in mind rather than the chemical properties of gasses and metals and bases. John told him about his first camera.
Sherlock dressed in fitted black jeans, a loose black jumper that draped off of his broad shoulders comfortably, and Chuck Taylors. A very New York look. When he walked out of his room, John looked at him and said, “Jesus.”
“Not that big.”
Sherlock nudged the heavy coat off of his shoulders, letting it slide down his arms. John watched the movement, then focused on the muscles rippling just underneath his t-shirt.
Sherlock pulled John’s hair and cried out a quiet, “Gah!” John pushed his head forward to allow Sherlock to come down his throat, watching Sherlock’s gorgeous face frozen in pleasure. He cherished that look. That was his Sherlock, the one no one else ever got to see. No one else would ever see.
Greg ended up kissing Mycroft in this story because that's what my Tumblr friends (and me, secretly) wanted. I think it also works a little better - Sherlock can lose his shit that much more because of Mystrade. Thanks for reading! I am
“It’s okay, Holmes. You’re still my best friend.” Victor said, but then timidly added, “Right?”
Madras-shorts looked at Sherlock on the floor. “Not gonna try anything stupid?”
“You’re biggest when I lick you.”
With a twinkle in his eye, he said, “You want a name?”
I didn’t want to lose him.
John said, “I’m so glad.” He wanted to stare into those aquamarine eyes to see the light behind them, the clear reflection of his affection glowing from behind dark lashes. Sherlock seemed just as content to stare into John’s eyes.
“I like your glasses.”
John just smiled at Sherlock’s own obvious nervousness.
“What’s happening?” Victor said, terrified.
That’s all it took for them to start a very educational and very satisfying sexual relationship. After a week where Sherlock was completely obsessed with nothing but Victor’s body, things had slowed down a bit. His experiments, analysis, and writing demanded attention. He somewhat reluctantly put on clothes and went back to the lab.
Impatient, he sought their combined pleasure. Foreskins pulled back, cock heads shiny, and they were ready. Never one to delay gratification, he stroked firm and fast, concentrating on the heads of their cocks as he watched them slide alongside each other and under his hand.
After a few minutes, he felt more steady and was ready to re-enter the room and wait for his brother to wake. It turned out that he didn’t need to wait at all, because Mycroft had woken. He and Lestrade were looking at each other with small smiles. Lestrade rubbed his hand and was whispering something. Mycroft closed his eyes and exhaled slowly. Sherlock found that he felt nothing but affection and admiration for the clear love the two men shared.
“I’m yours for the taking,” he said, smirking.
“Come up here.” John pulled him up and squeezed him tightly around the ribs, kissing him open-mouthed and wanting. They groaned together as their bodies aligned. They kissed and rocked and thrusted slowly.
Sherlock was on his back, left (broken) arm out to his side.
I called for Mrs. Hudson to bring me tea and a couple of biscuits. Instead of complying, she loudly exclaimed that I could make my own tea and suggested that said biscuits should be 'shoved' in a decidedly non-masticating orifice. I found it quite rude really.
“Oi! Shit. I might break a hip, you know?”
John lifted his chin, placed a small peck on his lips, and said, “All right.” John turned around, grabbed a bowl and poured himself some soup. “Do you want some?”
He assumed Sherlock was going to try to sleep again, but when he looked down, he was watching him again. John quirked his lips upwards in an affectionate smile.
John’s eyes darkened, and eyelids drooped, “Fuck, Sherlock. Your tongue.”
I had no idea what to say next so I simply put the phone down. I yawned. Seemed my transport needed more sleep after all of that thinking about John. I set my alarm for 8 AM and drifted on and off, watching lights move and change through the clock's glass face.
“I know, but I was thinking I should try to. Harry spent money on it and it’s just sitting here.” John brandished the Kindle in one hand, using his other to balance himself as he stood up from kneeling next to his bed.
He cradled his large hands around John’s precious skull, feeling his soft grey blond strands slip underneath his sensitive fingers. He really was gorgeous, from his deep blue eyes to his strong square jaw. With the same fond expression, he said “I was also going to ask you when you think you’d be able to go again.”
“We’re supposed to want to kiss them and have sex with them.”
on Tumblr, please come by and say hello.
“I don’t care.”
“Hey! It’s been a while!” the man shouted towards the bartender making their drinks. The barman just nodded. The woman with Fish-Shirt hadn’t looked up from her phone the whole time but was drunkenly swaying already. Apparently, this was the couple’s second or maybe even third ‘happy hour’.
He had always known there was a chance he would return when it was already too late, now it seemed to be confirmed. His heart sunk with the knowledge that John had found another person to share his life with. He hadn’t been such a fool to think that John would wait for him. But he missed him, he missed home, so much that he could hardly focus on work. For the thousandth time, he thought,
Moving my hand inside my trousers, I began to stroke. I barely knew the man, how could I know what John would be like during sex? But I’m Sherlock Holmes, of course I can deduce it. The combination of confidence, that walk (the loo door leading into my bedroom revealing glimpses from day one), and his rank of Captain suggested to me that I was on the right track.
John quirked his eyebrow back.
Sherlock raised his eyebrows.
Thanks for reading! I am
“Yes, good timing. Sit.”
That last word was all that mattered. It didn’t matter that he was on drugs. John had been in the fashion world for enough months to have seen some things. He’d seen people be half off their arses and still function professionally. So if Billy could handle the model and keep the light meter calibrated, then John was happy.
Sherlock turned his head to look at John. The hope...and the trust...in Sherlock’s eyes shredded John’s thin - tissue paper thin - wall he’d been clinging to all of these months. John reached for Sherlock’s hand slowly and when he didn’t pull away, he took Sherlock’s left hand between both of his smaller ones and raised his fingers to his lips. He kissed each knuckle slowly as Sherlock watched.
. He closed his eyes as John ran his hand up over his belly and chest. John took his hand away but before he could protest, he felt something very light settle on his skin, near his navel. He looked down. It was the tiny bird skull, glowing against his browned, salty skin. John snapped a very closeup photo of it and then bent down to retrieve a small shell. He placed it on his skin near the skull.
This chapter (in its previous draft) also appears in my compilation of ficlets
“For now.”
When John spoke in his Captain Watson of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers Fuck You Very Much voice, he meant what he said.
“You’re…?” Sherlock stopped again, but his eyes narrowed and he quirked his lips into a shy smile.
“Mm,” John hummed, “Also, your...everything else.” He gestured vaguely below Sherlock’s waist.
“He has a bit of a crush on you, you know.”
Sherlock stopped laughing and flipped them over so John was on his back and him hovering on all four limbs with his face over John’s groin. Sherlock cocked his head and stared at John’s soft penis. “It’s really a tiny little thing now, isn’t it?”
Sherlock, of course, could see fine. He tried to be helpful and told John that 41% of the population in the UK needed slight magnification - reading glasses - after the age of 45. John told him to ‘sod off’ and that he could ‘help by shutting the fuck up.’
The model quietly observed him. His eyes jumped away from John to stare down at his own body. “How and where do you want me?” His tone was almost innocent, but the words were laced with the double meaning of a young beautiful lad who had been manipulated in unsavory ways.
“Mmm?”
John looked at Greg’s face and believed him. Not that it mattered anyway, but he was somehow relieved about that bit of information. He thought maybe Greg was flattered or also harbored feelings for Sherlock. But he wouldn’t delve deeper. “I thought he was beautiful. And smart and dangerous. I mean, what a stupid thing for me, a photographer trying to make a name in this business, to get involved with a young drug-addicted model. How cliche,” John scoffed.
“No they don’t,” Sherlock simply stared, “Why do they?”
Sherlock didn’t move but continued to stare at John.
“And suffering and loss,” John interrupted.
“Oh god, you’re so beautiful. You feel so good. Are you all right?” said John.
John smirked right back. He knew Sherlock could be difficult. An arsehole. Too bloody smart for his own good. But also sweet and loving and surprising and warm and interesting and sexy.
“Well, I think it was you.”
Somehow John made him want to be better. But he couldn’t do it. Because he was a sodding miserable arsehole who acted perpetually like a teenaged drama queen. He couldn’t help but shit all over everyone. Including his beloved John.
“Mmm...feels plenty big," John laughed and thrust his hips down. “I meant take off your clothes.”
He would look up and tell Sherlock he was happy he was safe. That he was happy Victor was safe. He’d tell him to call him later if he felt like talking. He’d turn around and walk back to the chaos of the cars and lights and ask Greg for a ride to the nearest hotel. He’d book a flight to New York City and go to the place he called home and try to move forward with his career and life.
John watched as Sherlock withdrew his tongue in order to wrap his full lips around the thick straw. He hollowed his cheeks, and sucked very, very slowly.
It was late. The thrum of excitement and arousal was familiar in his blood. All he wanted to do was undress and get into bed with John. At that particular moment, however, John was yelling. Although Sherlock generally found John’s yelling or any display of aggression incredibly sexy, John didn’t usually feel sexy when he was in the midst of such a display. Sherlock sighed.
“I do.” John stepped closer and pulled him into a tight hug. After a very short (too short, Sherlock’s body asserted) moment, John pulled away and placed a kiss on his cheek. He stepped further away and cleared his throat. He looked unsure, maybe a bit sad. “I’m knackered. Where am I sleeping?” He tipped his head towards the sofa, questioning.
on Tumblr.
The three of them backed away into the shadows. As soon as the were clear from the garage area, they sprinted toward the other side of the building. John’s lungs burned with lack of oxygen, his breaths coming heavy and loud to his own ears. He couldn’t hear anything in his earpiece now that the other officers had gone silent. “Missing,” his brain supplied. Dammit, how many people were they going to lose before this thing was over?
“It’s good to see you.”
The woman’s face broke into a huge friendly smile. “Oh, yes, Graham told me you were coming. Welcome to Shoreditch House.”
*When Sherlock’s mother suffered a fainting episode. They rushed to the hospital near the Holmes’ cottage. She was lying in bed looking pale, but her bright blue eyes were clear. She was saying,
“Are you covering this for one of the papers?” She asked, snarky but sounding curious.
Sherlock looked down and nodded. The corners of his mouth pulled down and his lower lip jutted out slightly. He sighed.
However, it also seemed like the perfect opportunity for Sherlock to experiment a bit. He didn’t quite think it through, but one thing he was certain of - John would never know that he’d been drugged and observed. Now that sounded like Sherlock’s perfect Wednesday.
Sherlock was shocked by the sudden turn in moods. It was like a chemical titration but with emotional thoughts. One small emotional drip, drip, drip after another, then one thought too many, and the explosive peak is reached. Good mood over, replaced by a new chemistry of fury.
“Hardly a disguise. You have no pants on.”
Lestrade quietly said, “Thank you, John.” He held Mycroft’s hand, his eyes never leaving his face.
Sherlock turned to him, raising one eyebrow at him in question. John stopped giggling and affected his most serious face. Sherlock could tell he was faking and still thought something was funny. With a twinkle in his eyes, he said, “You just grab the base?”
John reached out and grabbed his bicep, hand still wet, causing a dark blue stain to appear in Sherlock’s silk dressing gown. “Sorry,” he mumbled, and dropped his hand. “What’s wrong with you?”
It could have been snarky, it could have been rude or sarcastic, but Sherlock said this with a quiet sense of wonder that made John shiver. Confirmation that this boy wanted him was all John needed to take this to the next step.
When they sat down at the table, Mary looked at them both and let a slow smile form on her lips. Obnoxious James huffed in annoyance. Mary winked at John and Jack blushed. John thought he was adorable.
I picked up the paper and started reading, hoping for a new mysterious incident we could investigate. Adrenaline, a rush around London, that would improve his mood.
Sherlock’s lips part slightly and his eyes widen. He looks interested and a tiny bit surprised. He looks down and picks up his wine glass. They're both sitting forward in their chairs, wine glasses in hand, calmly looking into the other’s eyes.
Mycroft nodded his head to one side in acknowledgement, “As I said, we will.”
“All right, love?”
John almost smiled.
Wrapped up in soft sheets that smelled like them, Sherlock woke with John curled up around him. They’d fallen asleep early after puttering around the flat all day. He hadn’t been bored. He loved watching John, talking to John, kissing John.
John didn’t say anything. He knew this would be a tough shoot and the less he said he figured the less anyone had to argue with. They were under a roadway in Brooklyn. There were several alleyways and tunnels leading from the open courtyard they would shoot in, giving the feeling of isolation and confusion. The walls were adorned thickly with years of bright, ever-changing graffiti.
I tried to understand why John would try to reach me now. What had happened to John’s sex date? In my limited experience, sex was quick, sweaty, and mostly satisfying, yet unromantic. Not knowing John for that long, though feeling like I knew him well already, he seemed to be the sort that would invite a woman to spend the night. He’d make her tea in the morning and she’d look at him with big eyes. She’d probably giggle. Wretched.
Lost in thought for the moment, I didn’t notice until it was too late that Hudders sipped her tea with a small smirk on her lips and a spark in her eyes.
“Please, I am sorry. I’ll try. Please,” Sherlock begged. He lifted John’s chin and John looked at him. He looked him in the eye and whispered, “I’m sorry, please.”
Greg huffed and rolled his eyes. “No you won’t.”
“Your hair…”
Please come find me on tumblr, I am
Sherlock wouldn’t look up, he stayed sat on the bed, and looked at his pathetic wrapped arm resting in his lap, brain whirring with thoughts of redemption, gratitude, apologies, fixes. Gone was the angry petulant idiot who had stupidly told John to go away. He could only think of one word now.
Sherlock joins him at the other side of the table, stopping John's train of thought. He seems bothered, looking down at his cup of tea, though John can't think of any reason of his anxiety. They had such boring day. He is so easy to read now, John thinks.
He waited for them for so long he'd lost all hope of ever hearing them. But here they are, and they feel like a wasted opportunity.
"Of course not. You know what it is," he says and gets up, walks around the table, stops just beside sitting Sherlock. "Come here."
"'There's something I've always meant to say, never have,' huh?" For a moment, he feels angry. His voice sounds too bitter though, and Sherlock doesn't deserve this. He can't bring himself to look at him, instead he continues staring absently at his hands. "Why now, Sherlock?"
John lets out a quiet, surprised oh, now truly invested. It's never happened before, he's quite sure--Sherlock wanting to talk about something. He looks at him expectingly. Rays of sunshine light his face, emphasising his cheekbones even more. His hair is lit in gold. He can see his bottom lip trembling, almost unnoticeably. "What is it, then?"
So it's Sherlock who breaks their kiss. It might've been eternity as far as John can tell, but it's certainly been too short, after all the time they've been kept apart.
"Oh, Sherlock," he starts, laughing without shade of amusement, looking away. "I'd always thought it was too late. It never was, apparently."
"I thought you'd leave."
"Thank you," Sherlock says, softly. Their foreheads are linked. Both of them can't think of anything to say, that hasn't been already clarified. "You think we could stay, like this?"
Sherlock is struggling to find the right words, any words. Silence fills the whole room until it's too much to bear. John finally looks at him, his face pained. Sherlock, oh, god, looks miserable, it strikes him only now--his face pale, his hands shaking. He can't see his eyes but he guesses they are reddened; for fuck's sake, he looks like he's about to cry, if he's not already. He wants to kiss those eyelids, kiss away all the pain he has to bear. He supposes he can try now, but if it would bring him any comfort, he doubts it. Instead he places his hands on Sherlock's, squeezing them gently, caressing his soft skin with his thumbs. He is so sorry, yet he can't make himself say anything.
It is late afternoon on a lazy Thursday in Baker Street 221b. The living room is covered in orange glow, last rays of sunshine get through the windows, lighting everything inside. John admires the view from behind the kitchen counter, keeping an eye on napping Rosie lying in her babysitter in the middle of the room. He's grown to love the ordinariness of this, throughout the years, having to see it now every day. It should be boring and domestic and everything that made him once anxious, yet it feels like something peaceful and ancient, something that was there forever, always waiting for him to come back. It's satisfying and he finds himself enjoying that more than anything these days. He can't quite imagine abandoning it now.
He should've known before. But he let him down instead, blaming him for every wrong that happened to him.
"New case?" John asks in a mildly curious tone, too content with the view to turn away.
He can clearly see Sherlock's tears on his cheeks now. He wipes them off with his thumb, caresses his curls, then brushes them off his forehead. "Was there ever a chance?" Sherlock asks, his voice barely heard. John's look answers for him. "When was it too late, then?"
"Is it bad?" Sherlock asks, still uncertain, though he should already know the answer.
John needs to look at his perfect face, he lifts his chin. It's all pain he's hidden for years, coming out only now. His beautiful as ever icy blue eyes stare back at him, and they're full of hope and relief. "Why not before? Why hide it for the whole time?" John asks.
"I love you." It is barely a whisper, a soft and brief statement. It's sincere, after years of knowing his voice, John can tell that. One day he'd thought those words coming out of Sherlock's mouth would bring him pure relief and joy. It's different now, though; those words sting, like a blade that once, years ago, stabbed him straight in his heart and was never removed, until now. It left him with dull ache he'd learned to ignore almost completely. But now this wound that was once healed, yet never entirely, is bleeding again, causing him striking pain he's forgotten a long time ago.
"It's okay," he tries to comfort both Sherlock and himself, not sounding too convinced. "It's okay, Sherlock," he repeats, now more self-assured. Sherlock looks up at him, confused. John gives him a faint smile, probably looking awfully fake. Sherlock doesn't care, though, and smiles back, just barely. John's smile is more sincere this time, expression not too pained. He needs to do it for him.
"No, not quite," Sherlock answers, his voice as nervous as John could hear him at only few, really bad situations. It takes John's full attention. Sherlock is tapping his fingers on his cup. "But there's something--some simple thing, really. I just want to talk with you about something."
John takes his hand again. He touches his hair tenderly, like he could break him any moment. Sherlock's wary, still afraid, but leans into the touch. He lets his head rest on John's chest, closes his eyes. "Simple as that?"
"I'm never going to leave you, Sherlock. Not again," he promises. He never wants to let go of his face ever again. He kisses his forehead gently. "I'm sorry I did," he whispers, barely moving back, Tears show up on Sherlock's cheeks. He wipes them off again and this time he kisses his eyelid tenderly. "I love you, too, you know?" he whispers, linking their foreheads. He kisses his right eyelid now, "I love you," once again. Then his head, his forehead, his nose and cheeks and chin. I love you, I love you, I love you, he repeats every time, his own vow he needs to keep. Sherlock keeps his eyes closed, afraid that if he opens them, it'll all go away. John wants to convince him that it's all real, but he doesn't know himself. He finally connects their lips and it's tender and sloppy and unsure but still as beautiful and it's everything he's ever dreamed of. Sherlock tastes of tea and salt from all his tears and John can feel him pulling on his shirt. His lips are so soft and John's never going to let them go.
“Bed’s comfortable.” John smacked his lips a few times and drifted off to sleep with Sherlock settled along his back.
John rose and walked towards him. Sherlock faced him, chest heaving. He felt completely out of control. Angry, helpless, and worst of all, embarrassed. He wondered what it was about this photographer that made him feel so insecure. His very unhelpful brain was trying to reveal the answer
John shouted, “Oh fuck!” and came in rapid pulsing waves. “Oh, oh, ah, oh god, oh…”
“You’ve decorated me.”
John tried to maintain contact, but had to let go of his lip to say, “That’s it, you’re so good for me, my beautiful boy,” Sherlock was done, that did it.
He looked up to find Sherlock still looking at him with the same detachment. Resigned, he opened his mouth and said, “Sherlock.” He hated the way his voice cracked on the second syllable.
Sherlock relaxed and changed his face back to his model one. After a few minutes of shooting, he said, “Thank you, John.”
They fell into bed and arranged themselves into a loose snuggle.
Sherlock’s mouth quirked up at the edges humorlessly. “Oh, I can do angry.”
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock exclaimed, now exasperated. “You’re quite adamant about your ‘not gay’ speech in reaction to anyone’s inquiry about us.”
Mycroft smiled. His genuine, warm smile so few got to see. Greg adored that smile. God, he was still smitten even after all of these months.
He stood, and with wet hands, ruffled his curls. He looked up and down the beach and didn’t see anyone about but John. His John, sitting on the shore, leaning back on his hands with his head lolling on one shoulder. He walked slowly out of the water and approached John, who had picked up his camera and was taking a few photos. Sherlock walked slowly, posing a bit, feeling completely unselfconscious about his nudity. John made him feel beautiful and sexy. John snapped several more times.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You snore-snorted and woke me up,” Sherlock said, voice rumbling through John’s rib cage.
That didn’t sound right, but Sherlock didn’t know with John.
Sherlock crossed his arms over his chest. “You stimulate me too.”
Sherlock smirked as if to say
He heard breaths heaving out of John’s wet nose and throat. Sherlock flung himself onto John’s old bed and wrapped himself tightly around John’s back, muscles engaged in strict tetanus. He was never going to let go until John’s tremors stopped.
He couldn’t do it. He couldn’t just leave London and just visit this gorgeous genius now and again. It was too fast, he was risking it all, but he needed to find out if Sherlock wanted the same thing that he did. “Er,” he raised his eyebrows and said, “Actually, I thought I’d move back.”
I did not believe him. I remembered the way they ran up to his room. I remembered John’s groan. A now familiar stirring in my groin tugged at the thought of that groan. I raised my eyebrows at him, trying to look dully skeptical.
Sherlock looked surprised for a nanosecond then composed himself. He answered coolly, “Like it?”
John’s vision went fuzzy. He couldn’t think straight for a minute. He didn’t recognize his surroundings or what was happening for a few seconds, but when he came to and realized that Sherlock still had his nose in John’s pubic hair rutting against his leg, he revived enough to haul Sherlock up into a sloppy kiss. He grabbed Sherlock’s erection and fisted it hard and fast, just the way he’d learned Sherlock loved it. He came five seconds later, spilling over John’s hip and cock, kissing John with swollen lips, still tasting of John’s orgasm. John thought it was the hottest thing that had ever happened in the history of hot things.
“Love?”
on Tumblr, please come by and say hello.
I lingered in the warm water thinking again of John. My belly pulled taut and I felt a stirring in my cock, the unfamiliar pull of desire taking me by surprise, especially so soon after my recent completion. I scrubbed the cloth over my face. I could feel the heat of my skin blushing at the thought of John’s small, sturdy hands on me. It was so unlike me to feel this way, I almost laughed at the absurdity.
“Goodnight, and thanks.”
Greg nodded.
They had kept each other in varying states of arousal until the sun was very low in the sky. “Want to watch the sunset,” John asked.
John smiled mildly as he explained his vision for the overall shoot. Sherlock listened intently and was again surprised that he loved all of John’s ideas. Photographers always wanted to sort of ‘butch’ him up. His features were so unique and not-quite-delicate, but feminine in a way. Especially his lips. John, however, wanted to highlight his features and have him wear makeup. Full smokey eyes with soft glossy lips. Sherlock smiled. He was actually excited to get started. He needed just one little bump and then he’d be ready.
“I thought it was all over. I thought it was the end. Again!”
John’s stomach fluttered again. He didn’t speak for a long moment. Sherlock didn’t speak either. “It’s good to hear your voice too,” he finally said.
“Been wanting to do that for ages.”
John was skating around the rink in slow counter-clockwise circles, with Molly and Lestrade. Sherlock caught up to him and grabbed his left hand with his right. Surprised, John exhaled loudly and wobbled a bit. He smiled up at Sherlock and winked.
Oh...John worried about how he could afford the place. Probably he imagined all sorts of nefarious things Sherlock could be getting up to in order to live in a large flat in Marylebone. Off on the wrong foot, again, he thought. He raised his chin and said, “Mrs. Hudson gives me a deal. She’s an old family friend.”
Sherlock looks at John, “What things?”
I looked at him. He paid me no attention whatsoever. Perplexing.
“Afghanistan or Iraq?”
John kissed his knuckles and said, “Night love.” Sherlock hummed, closed his eyes, and fell immediately to sleep without answering. He soon followed into a dreamless, comfortable sleep.
“Before...I mean when we first met. You...um…”
Victor huffed a little laugh, “Oh, I will Holmes. Look at you. Come on me you filthy gorgeous thing. I can feel your tight little hole. You want me in there? You’re gagging for it.”
“I expect they will be charged with a number of serious offenses and will surely be found guilty.”
Sherlock nodded.
“All right.”
With that, Moustache turned on his heels and slinked away.
, how he wanted.
“Yes we had to carefully subdue Ms. Morstan, as she was armed. She was uncooperative and quite vocal. She and Mr. Wilder are unharmed. As are our officers and agents.”
Sherlock leaned over and kissed John. He was trying to remove his clothing while keeping their lips together. It wasn’t working well, they kept missing and Sherlock would lick John’s cheek or nostril but eventually he was naked.
“Ah!” John cried, and turned around with hands up, looking like he was ready to box whoever had startled him.
He blinked and looked down at himself. His jumper had rucked up, revealing a sliver of stomach. He saw the length of his erection laying stiffly along his left hip. He looked up at John and noticed he was in a similar state. Sherlock scrambled to his knees, while whirling his jumper off above his head. He grabbed the hem of John’s jumper and removed it similarly, quickly moving his hands to John’s jeans. He ripped the button open and unzipped the fly before he was roughly shoved back by strong hands pressing to his shoulders.
In answer, Sherlock took John’s erection back into his mouth, never breaking eye contact.
Thanks for reading! I am
. He threw his head back, thrusting his cock further up into John’s hand, stilling for just a moment. John pulled his hand from root to tip, with a small twist at the end.
“He said he needed air,” I frowned. “I don’t understand, there’s air in the flat.”
All they had ever shared was one kiss. If Sherlock hadn’t fallen asleep that night. If he hadn’t snuck out in the early morning hours. If he hadn’t resisted calling or texting for weeks. If he hadn’t been stupid fucking Sherlock Holmes they would know where John was sleeping tonight. But as it was, Sherlock had no choice but to say, “There’s a second bedroom upstairs.”
The rest of the afternoon limped slowly by.
“What?” Sherlock tried to interrupt but John worked his way up to a blazing fervor.
“Thank you. Thanks for coming.”
John glared at him.
“It’s a bit sticky, you sure you don’t want to hear the details first?”
“No pants."
“What is your association with my brother?” Mycroft asked.
“Thank you.” He wondered if he was easy to read or if she was exceedingly clever. He supposed it could be both. She quirked her eyebrow waiting for him to speak. “I’m from London but I live in New York. I studied chemistry. I want to make as much money as I can, while I can.”
I knew why. Because she loved the secrets we shared.
“All right. We can do it like this.”
“Yeah?” John sighed, as he kissed his jaw, and tightened his grip around their cocks and thrusting lightly. Sherlock’s cock was unassuming when flaccid, but when he was aroused it filled out to be longer and thicker than average, with a gorgeous head that John called “pretty”. John’s cock was shorter, but thicker than his. One of Sherlock’s very favorite things to observe was John Watson getting an erection. John would stroke himself or sometimes Sherlock would touch him and just watch. John would simply stay quiet, with half-lidded eyes clouded with lust while it happened. The sight was so erotic, turned him on so much, that he could only look every few times they had sex. It was very overwhelming.
Sherlock shivered at the mocking endearment, laid his head back down, and closed his eyes. Creepy men had been leering at him and generally being inappropriate with him since he was fourteen. He had never been all-out assaulted, but one of headteachers had called him ‘darling’ while touching his arms and back without his consent. The word made his skin crawl.
John barked out a loud, “Ha!” and added, “Are you really so concerned about that right now?” He punctuated his statement with a hard thrust of his cock into Sherlock’s inner thigh.
“Rub on me.”
“You’re teasing me somehow,” Sherlock says, voice deeper now. A slight blush has crept up his neck and onto his incredibly sharp cheekbones. John doesn’t know if it’s because John’s lame attempt at a joke flew over his head, or if it’s the wine. Or maybe it’s something else?
John rolled his eyes and raised his voice, “Right! Locked down!”
He allowed himself to relax slightly, but remained attentive for the likely possibility that others would join them soon. For now, however, it was just Akari and him.
“This is mine too, all mine.”
He felt John’s fingers press in further. John probed in and out two or three times. At the same moment his fingers went deep enough to graze Sherlock’s prostate, he reached up and sucked Sherlock’s cock deep into his mouth.
He took Sherlock’s hand and turned to hail a cab. Sherlock huddled close so their arms and joined hands were trapped between them. He turned slightly so he could bend down and place a small trail of kisses from John’s temple and down to the shell of his ear. He pulled John’s earlobe between his lips and John gasped. Sherlock rumbled into his ear, “I want you.”
on Tumblr.
Thank you for reading this, and for every comment and kudos, they mean so much to me.
“What?”
“We’ve worked well together in the past. I am hoping that you and I can be friends,” he smiled.
“Um...I’m just going to go…” Victor said, and walked out the bedroom door towards the loo.
“I need to go back to New York.”
“Let’s go to bed, John,” he said as he stood up stiffly. He ran his hands along John’s back and arse, up then down as John sleepily hummed.
John groaned and pulled him back down to bite and suck on Sherlock’s lips. This was John’s method to make Sherlock’s lips appear even fuller. John loved his lips and Sherlock happily obliged. He relaxed his mouth and let John take what he wanted. He snuck in a nip or a suck when he could.
Victor looked at him and said, “You’re very kind.” Then he added quietly, “I hope so.”
John stared at me, a mixture of incredulity and disappointment warring on his expressive face. “It cannot possibly be helpful to your brain in any way for the long term. I find it difficult to reconcile your genius mind with the stupidity of taking drugs like they’re vitamins.”
“Oh. Yeah,” he said, eyes focusing on nothing out the window.
He texted and called a hundred times and she never answered him. Three days later the divorce petition arrived. None of their friends would talk to him. Mary got to them first. He wondered sadly what she told them. He didn’t know how to reach her. Her office wouldn’t let him in, wouldn’t tell him where she was, or where she was staying. He was completely helpless, hopeless, and so confused. He stayed in bed for days, sleeping as much as his body and brain wanted.
Mycroft finally said, “And who are you?”
Now they were sweaty and sated again. After grabbing a flannel to clean them both up a bit, John was laying with his left cheek on Sherlock’s pectoral muscle. Sherlock was on his back with his right arm around John’s head and neck, drawing lazy soft circles around his scarred shoulder. John’s right hand roamed over Sherlock’s belly, down to scratch into the neatly trimmed hair around his softening damp cock.
Again at the same time, with eyes wide, they each said, “What?”
Sherlock worked on his own projects, trying to keep out of John’s way. He also tried to quietly coax John out of the mood. He used his hands to touch John’s shoulders, squeeze his hands between his own, trail fingers lightly along his nape. Once he lightly pinched his bum as he walked by. John had turned and Sherlock winked at him. John’s slow smile that barely reached his eyes was better than nothing, but he had been hoping for a grin and a declaration of “Prat.”
“What?” he asked, irritable again.
“I assume you had a successful date?”
models.”
John scoffed but smiled as he said, “Sod off. Now you have me lying on my back, what did you think? It’s all worn out now.”
They were closer than two platonic blokes should be. People of all stripes assumed they were lovers. John denied it, always. But Sherlock never did. The thought arose without his permission,
John chuckled, “Yes.”
“I’m not leaving you," he said fiercely, "I’m not leaving any of you.”
Greg could only answer one way. He placed both hands on the sides of Mycroft’s face and leaned in to touch their lips together. Their lips touched in a gentle kiss. With slight suction and a slow slide, Greg ran his tongue along Mycroft’s lower lip, their mouths immediately opening to deepen the kiss. Their tongues danced and teased as they began to breathe harder. Hands roamed over faces, necks, shoulders, mussing each other's hair. God, how Greg had missed this.
“Behave.”
“What? No. I meant you should try to get information about her from....friends, colleagues. Not put yourself in a position to be...taken, ” he said, grimacing.
“No kissing,” I groaned, miserable. Oh, how I wanted the kissing.
“I’m sorry. You watched me bring home women. I got married for christ’s sake. I didn’t know. I’m sorry. I should have known.”
The hallway and door were painted a dark grey. He quietly approached the door, crouched down, and placed his ear as close to the floor as he could. He heard Mary’s voice, presumably talking on the phone. He quickly got out his mobile and set it to record, sliding it as far under the door as he could. He sunk back into a corner, staying quiet and listening for anyone else who might come out of the stairwell. After several minutes, he listened again. She was off the phone and he heard Graham and Mary talking. Their voices faded as they walked towards the reception area. He grabbed his phone, stopped the recording and placed it in his pocket.
John cleared his throat and lifted his arm in the direction of the small control room. “Over here. You can get ready here.”
John cut him off before he could say anything, and said, “No. See that right there?” He gestured towards Sherlock. “That right there was not normal. People do not just levitate from the floor to standing, like...like...a goddamned hummingbird.”
Sherlock barked out, “Where’s his mobile phone?”
The narrow space held a small cubby where I stored a thin wool blanket and a change of clothes. There were books, some old case notes, a “hipster student” disguise, and a bed that had no business being as comfortable as it was. In my prone position, warm and fairly comfortable, I allowed my mind to analyze Dr. John Watson. And more importantly my feelings and reactions to him. There was no denial, no rebuke of sentiment.
Sherlock nodded and said, “All right. What are we going to do? We need to find out more about Agra. Mary too, I suppose, but it sounds like she won’t willingly speak to you.”
“You’re brilliant.”
“You said friend. But he’s your boyfriend, yes?”
He reaches his fingertips further down into Sherlock’s palm, then rests them over Sherlock’s wrist, feeling his pulse racing.
“Come here.” John pulled him in for a searing kiss. He tangled their tongues together, making sure to open his mouth a little more than necessary to show their audience exactly how hot and wet the kiss was. He had both hands buried in Sherlock’s slicked back hair, guiding his head sideways to deepen the kiss. He lowered one hand to trail down his throat, squeezing his neck briefly, then traced down his flank to finally rest possessively on Sherlock’s arse. He tugged on his hair causing Sherlock to moan loudly, probably loud enough to be heard over the music. He nipped at Sherlock’s upper lip, then his lower. He ended the kiss with a possessive bite to his lower lip. Sherlock looked dazed and was breathing heavily.
John closed his eyes, tears streaming freely down his cheeks, said, “I love you. You are everything to me.” He opened his eyes and looked into his gorgeous friend’s shimmering ones. John grabbed his face in both hands roughly and pulled him down into a long, slow, wet, deliberate, meaningful kiss.
At twenty-two, he married the love of his life, Katelyn O’Connely, an Irish lass from Acton.  Marah was absolutely besotted with her African Swallow dæmon, Varro.  They settled in Bobby’s family farm house in Studland, Dorset and started their own family.
War took more than just lives.
John and Kato never talked about what had happened to them in the jungle, but then again the never talked about much of anything to anyone anymore.  Spoken only when spoken too, John became a distant child, hiding in his room or running about into the small wooded area near the house.  Kato rarely changed forms, choosing to hold a single shape for months.  When he did shift it was always into a predator.  Kato became John’s protector, standing away from other dæmons, even family.
*          *          *          *          *
A few hours later two more officials came in.  They separated at the door, one heading for the child and the other for him.  Marah cowered against Bobby’s leg as the man told him about the bodies that had washed up near a village, Katelyn among them.  Marah wailed as Bobby sat there in silence, shock settling over him.  She drowned, he told them.  I’m sorry for your loss, they consoled.
When her son was ten, Adelyn bore his brother into their lives.  Sherlock was a difficult child, even the birthing was a nightmare.  He was born late and there had been so many complications that Adelyn was denied the epidural.  It was a painful and long process as Sherlock did not come easily into the world and the years that followed were no easier.
“Well, apparently you can,” Lestrade argued back, teeth grinding as Danae swiveled her attention, ears upright and poised as she stared down the woman’s small magpie daemon.  The reporter retook her seat and said not another word.
“How’s your blog going?”
“It’s an old friend of mine, John Watson and Kato,” Mike supplied as the consulting detective accepted the phone, quickly glancing to the floor as he turned.  Societal norms dictated the unspoken law of scrutinizing another’s daemon.  In layman’s terms, it was rude to stare.  Most considered it taboo, though it was not actually illegal.  Thankfully, Sherlock only needed a second.  The doctor’s daemon was not a dog after all, but was in fact a Neofelis Nebulosa, commonly known as a clouded leopard.  Interesting.
Atalanta huffed in annoyance as Asta climbed onto the table, knocking over equipment and trying to gain her attention.  Turning away in disinterest, she made her way over to Sherlock where he sat upon one of the stools and started to jot down his observations.  “Mike, can I borrow your phone? There’s no signal on mine.”
“You’re just upset his daemon wouldn’t greet you,” he replied, trying not to laugh.
Greg shifted in the uncomfortable seat, fingers spayed together to halt the self-conscious twitching.  Beside him, Danae was the picture of professional decorum.  The Irish Wolfhound laid on the floor to the right of the table, exuding an air of practiced disinterest and yet appearing attentive, which was far more then could be said for Tharin.  Sally’s daemon was under the table, long ears twitching in annoyance and agitation.
“Well, you’re the second person to say that to me today.”
A clouded leopard, the smallest of all the big cats, less than two feet at the shoulder.  Kato was smaller than even Marah.  He was short and stocky, with overly large paws that Bobby knew served some sort of function but made Kato look like a cub that was still growing.
“But if they’re suicides,” another interrupted before the two detectives could beat a hasty retreat.  “What are you investigating?”
The man’s daemon seemed curious, large gold eyes examining the arctic fox, not at all bothered by the attention.  After it became apparent that Atalanta would not be introducing herself, the clouded leopard turned away, stalking around the room and sniffing various equipment.
They stood there a moment longer, watching as Sally started to aggressively type her report and Tharin supervise from his perch on her desk; Greg could hear her keyboard nearly fifteen feet away as she pounded on the keys.  “It was rather impressive,” Danae commented as they made their way into the office.  Greg hummed in a questioning tone as he hung up his coat.  “The text messages,” Danae elaborated, settling into the large dog bed by the desk.
