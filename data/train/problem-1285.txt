“This is everything we’ve been waiting for,” he whispered to John.
Moriarty grinned as Sherlock’s hands came to rest on the lock.
“What is it, Mrs. Hudson?” he snapped. It took him a second to realize she was holding baby Watson, who looked aghast at his harsh tone.
“God, was it that bloody obvious?” he could feel his neck heating up, his throat closing over a wave of tears that threatened to overflow.
ahhhhh oh my god. so FINALLY im so sorry im terrible. here is chapter 4. spent way too long writing this i hope its good !!!!!!! after this we get really into the story. fuck yea. enjoy !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
“I know you have been… down, Sherlock. I will be watching you, brother dear,” with that, Mycroft hung up. Sherlock resisted the urge to take John’s phone and crush it under his heel.
When he entered the building, Molly Hooper was practically waiting for him.
“Where have you been?” he clipped.
“Because of the circumstances, John. Everything is to be questioned right now. We cannot take chances,” his voice was too silky for John’s liking.
“I shouldn’t have brought you guys out here... Let’s go in and get some tea?” John’s eyes still didn’t leave Sherlock as the taller man cleared his throat and stood a little straighter. His hands came out of his pockets and seemed to steady as he fixed his scarf. Suddenly John’s eyes were torn to another. A bloody, terrified severed head stared up at him, eyes open and mouth yawning. It was the dot below the question mark on the sentence. John coughed violently and turned away. Sherlock’s smooth voice broke through the sound of John’s fit.
John looked over the set of photos that were presented to him. Each one showed a sharpened saw, tinted red. It laid next to each of the body parts, the ragged edges of skin fitting perfectly into the notches of the weapon. The teeth were razor sharp, obviously pre-filed and ready for their purpose. It was huge, and looked very heavy. It had to be a man, then. So Donovan was, in fact, out of the picture as the murderer. It was propped up on the side of the house, a hole in the azaleas and a stream of blood down the siding of the cottage the only indication of what had really happened there.
“Are you alright? I heard…” there was a pause, “I just wanted to make sure you were alright,” Sherlock heard a small fist pound on his door, presumably Watson, cradled in John’s arms. He still couldn’t bring himself to move, so he produced a weak reply and shut his eyes once again.
The dreams won't stop. Day in and night out, Sherlock is plagued. What will it take to make them go away? Meanwhile, John tries to balance the newfound chaos making its way into the duo's lives.
It was only later that evening that Sherlock moved. He heard John’s soft footfalls nearing him, and he looked up. The blonde man barely met his eyes.
The car slowed to a stop. They had been driving a while, and they were now outside the city limits, John noticed. The wheels ground into the gravel of a hillier, sparser area, where little houses lined up, one atop each hill, creating a whimsical paradise for those who wished to live their lives in peace outside the bustling ecosystem of London. Except, of course, that there was bright yellow police tape covering the entirety of the house that they had just stopped in front of. Several police cars waited outside, lights flashing in the bright sunshine. It was eerily quiet as the grit crackled under their feet, the three men carefully stepping out of the car, as if waiting to see if something would explode. It didn’t. Sherlock was already scanning the house and surrounding area. John wondered what horrific thing lay in wait for them. He was, undoubtedly, a touch excited.
Suddenly,there was a familiar voice “Sherlock,I ‘ll take you.” It was a blonde hair man.He was quite short,like a teddy bear.
Yes, his good old friend John H Watson. Companioned him for at least 40 years. Cases, they have been through ,difficultiesthey had ,argued they had,wonderful memories of theirs.
he saw John smiles with relief and pain, plause raising ,he's holding his hand.
“No， Sherlock Is dead. ”I said. Trying to make myself another cup of coffee, and trying to avoid seeing the finger on the table.
He sats in his armchair,feeling the warmth from the 19th century’s sun.Bees buzzed in the garden.He listened in silence. He felt sleepy. He closed his eyes. “Maybe I need more cocaine.” He thought,but he knew he wasn’t. He was dying.
“It’s John.”
"Elshil,Sherlock.never think about this. "John raised his laptop and pointed at the screen.
“Your home,our home,221b.”
“Where are we going?”
Cocaine was passing by , but she was too high to hear Sherlock called her.
"Coming!"John answered. Then he turned to me. "Elshil,umm, Molly and Mrs Hudson are out,So could you please......."
Mycroft smiled
"I love you. "
Sherlock said nothing.
I remained silent.

BEHIND The Scenes
“Cocaine””Cases””Reputation ““Scott land Yard” and “Sherlock’s Soul”, and all of the other things which is related to Sherlock lived in a big palace on a lonely island.
He felt heavy, or floating. Like he was drifting off to sleep. He heard a soft voice calling “Homles! Are you all right?”
Mrs.hudson smiled in deep wisdom.
Mycroft stopped him.
"You know what? "he paused a little. "I love you. "
I watched them as they called a cab. Sherlock opened the door for John and  they both went away. I saw them going down the street.
"How do I know? "
He said,suddenly.
Oh, mycroft, his brother. he is the most annoying brother in the world. Dont think of him, he thought angrily. he's dead.
“Dear brother, I can’t take you .I’ve got Lestrade. Someone will do , I promise.”
“He always will.”
Sherlock was stunned.
"You wrote us…… dead. "
“He will come back.”
“He was clearly watching you," Sherlock speaks over John, and then his head snaps up, eyes widening. “
“Great, yeah. Married with 3 kids. Lovely wife. Teaching at Barts, if you can believe it.”
“It’s really such a noble sacrifice, Sherlock, for you to assume the role of John’s lover for the sake of Mummy’s peace of mind,” Mycroft oils. “I imagine it is a
“It should effectively convince her of our harmonious recoupling.”
“Sorry?” Molly says, looking at him, perplexed.
“Why, Daddy?” Rosie asks.
“So sorry to interrupt,” Mummy says, not sounding remorseful in the least, and Sherlock feels a bit like he’s in secondary school, getting caught snogging a friend who’d come to stay for the night (all theoretical, of course; he hadn’t had friends in secondary school). “But we’re going to have cake.”
He doesn't want to think about how carelessly obvious he's been in his attentions.
“I mean, Jesus, roll the bloody tapes. I’m not proud of some of my past behaviour when it comes to you and our--whatever
As the track changes into
Sherlock would love nothing more than to be Rosie’s father. To be with John, and for them to be a family. But it is unclear if John is offering all of it. Life partnership; a relationship.
John’s eyes flit over Sherlock’s face, and he licks his lips. “You like that, hm?” he asks, voice like butter, rolling his hips, tortuously slow. “Slow enough?”
“Don’t...ever say that word again,” John says darkly.
Sherlock can’t see the woman’s eyes behind her overlarge, hideous heart-shaped sunglasses, so he can’t be sure if she is once again addressing her dog or Sherlock.
“You’re being evasive,” Holmes said, though he was preening.
“John,” Holmes panted, “there is nothing I would like to do more at this very moment than to fuck myself on your prick.”
John barks out a mirthless laugh.
Sherlock doesn’t know how he’s meant to respond to that, so he reaches for the top button of John’s shirt. “My turn.”
“John, put those down this instant,” Mummy says.
Mary starts to clap and chant Greg’s name, and Greg is emboldened to take the centrestage of their circle, fist-pumping and hopping in time to the beat. John can’t stop grinning, and even Sherlock seems at odds with whether he should be amused or horrified by the display.
John obliges, builds up speed until he’s pistoning into Sherlock relentlessly, hard enough for his bollocks to slap against Sherlock’s arse, for Sherlock’s cock to smack against his stomach.
"Never wanted someone as much as I want you," John says sleepily, as if drunk off their kiss, and something in Sherlock's stomach somersaults and flutters.
“For god’s sake,” Mycroft murmurs.
Instead, he looks away, wishing he could disappear.
Holmes made a loud noise of disapproval. "Nonsense! Never apologise for your presence, Watson." He appraised me then disappeared suddenly, leaving me bewildered, and hastily reappeared and jut his chin out in the direction of the sitting room. “Come in, my good man. Come in."
“Definitely not really,” Sherlock manages, though only barely.
Mrs Hudson eyes settle on Sherlock. “Who hurt you, dear?”
“I am well aware, thank you, John,” Mycroft says coldly. “I’ve a car on the way. Emergency business, you see. Putting out fires in Australia.”
John is withdrawing, and that simply won’t do, so Sherlock pushes himself up enough to get a hand on the back of John’s skull, guides John back to his lips.
"Death ,is only the beginning. "
He sailed away.
"Really?"I smiled, take a sip of my coffee and turned around. "How would you know? "
“What a lovely day,isn’t it?
High functioning sociopath, people said ,he's a machine.
"Holmes, you need to have a rest. "He heard Watson said ,he smiled faintly in return. Watching has always been his best friend, the best and wisest friend. But he knew he wanted more. She never said, it's nineteenth century it's.some how against the law,Actually, he doesn't care about it, but he afraid that Watson will leave him. .
Behind the scenes.
"Yes?"
he felt tired, he can feel his time slipping away. "Watson"He said in a deep low voice.
He have seen people dead.In all kinds of course.Murders,sickness,drowned,gunshots. All. But he never cared about what people are thinking when they are dying. Somehow, he should.
“You shouldn’t leave,he needs you.”
"John! Lestrade text us,a crime scene . "Sherlock is shouting downstairs.
“John?” Asked Sherlock, “ but why?”
He asked Mrs Hudson,an elder.
Sherlock, closed his eyes again, and he felt the warm from the sunlight, bees buzzed in the garden, he remembered John's smiles, over and over again in the last minutes, the world is in dark, floating but with a soft voice.
"The best and the wisest friend? he just will probably said Oh, breathing is boring. "
“Like Redbeard, again.”
Sherlock was dying.
"And that I love you.? I probably told you more than one time. I am not gay. And how could sherlock said that. You know, I think love is still mystery to him."
“ Because only John is able to understand how valuable Sherlock’s soul is”
When the island had almost sunk, he decided to ask for help .Mycroft was passing by Sherlock in a big boat. Sherlock just look at him. Mycroft smiled.
"I can know everything. "
It's not that hard. He thought. For the past 70 years. When his brains are almost stop working, the working part will be his heart.
But John is always the one who believes him ,Always. People don't keep their promises, usually. Always is never an always. But somehow the silent promise and loyal John gave, never spoken, but it did happen.
"Oh, Rosie, all right. "I picked up my bag "I can handle her. "
“Who helped me?”
After John took Sherlock to the dry land,he sailed around the new island.
Sherlock sniffed in unwilling and disbelief.
“You’re an army doctor, I can tell from your tanned skin ,your …”
“ yes, yes, in fact, we lived on the same floor in your palace .” The man said.
John sat in his sofa, reading the article I have posted on the Internet.
The man took him to a dry land.  He kissed him on the forehead. “ goodbye my friend but it was too late .”
"Well, another day for Rosie. "I sigh, going down the stairs and wink at the camera nearby.
"Thanks."He went off down stairs.
He opened his eyes a little.Waston was standing next to him.He looked concerned. "Fine,It's all just...Fine. "He said heavily.
Sherlock breaks character, moaning deeply, sounding very much like
Moments later, in a boneless haze, John fumbles with incredible incoordination for the lube in the sidetable, and Sherlock gets on all fours and presents his arse for John’s taking.
1. Sans pareille = unparalleled.
sorry,” Sherlock yells over the music, cloyingly insincere.
“Hm?”
Sherlock flicks a dismissive hand. “Vengeful librarian.”
“Really doubt that.”
TW: Mention of Drugging, Flirting with Infidelity
John settles in beside Rosie as Sherlock takes his turn in the sea, jogging and diving into a massive wave, disappearing under the water for a few moments until he springs up like a mermaid, flicking his sopping curls off his face. John rolls his eyes at the Drama, but his heart is all a-flutter. He is
John blinks, hard, his vision bleary, but through the blear, he sees that Sherlock is wild-eyed and unmoored--but just for a moment. There is a shift. His expression softens. Lips stretch faintly upwards. Eyes turn bright.
It’s an inviolable truth.
do. I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you; and with Rosie.”
going to be next to a bloody skip freezing our bollocks off.”
“And if we were to put that tradition into practice, I think,” I said, forgetting myself and sweeping my gaze along his body, “we would need not search far and wide for a handsome, tall, dark-haired man.”
John calls over the bartender to order a water for Sherlock and a local brew on draught for himself just as a twangy guitar solo permeates through the speakers. An old man fingering an air guitar and his dance partner, a washed out blonde woman cheering on his unimpressive panto, take the centrestage of the dance floor, garnering the attention of several sets of judgmental eyes.
Sherlock heads to the booth, hanging up his coat and scarf on a hook, and slides in toward the wall. Scans the room, his foot tapping steadily. Stops. Drums his fingers on the sticky table instead.
“It’s embarrassing, Sherlock. Her parents, snogging like randy teenagers for all and sundry.”
. Anyone faced with such a preternatural occurrence is bound to act in an unpredictable way.
“Surely, you don’t intend to maintain that--that
“We could work something out. Could be nice to have down the line.”
But they never do get around to talking about it.
“Your father is working late today, so he’s asked me to take you home. Are you hungry?”
Preening, Sherlock rolls down the window, the steamy heat of the car and biting cool of the outdoors a bracing contrast, and lights a cigarette, taking a long drag. Holding the smoke in his lungs for a moment, he blows a stream out the window and slumps bonelessly down into his seat.
“Oh, John, how rude of us,” Mummy says. “You’ll be wanting to put down your things and get settled.” John nods absently, looking a bit out of sorts as he hefts the strap of the duffel bag over his shoulder. “I was thinking you boys could take the guest room with the Sargent painting. You know the one, Sherlock.” He does, and doesn’t miss that she hadn’t designated the room John and Mary shared two Christmases ago. “Go and show John the way.”
generous,” Sherlock murmurs.
A hand smacked onto his shoulder startles John within an inch of his life.
When they break the kiss, they keep hold of each other.
My stomach was then in knots, though I took solace in the fact that Holmes seemingly had not followed the scent of my unease to its source.
“Spare me the lecture.”
“All that fresh air will
When Sherlock turns his head, he finds John watching him with a beatific smile.
“God, look at you,” John says in wonder, then kisses Sherlock bruisingly.
“Happy Birthday, my boy,” Dad says, raising his glass.
“I do not say this in jest!” I asserted, slightly offended. “I can oversee your progress, help you with exercises, and administer medication whenever necessary. Dr. Pendergast, my colleague, would be more than happy to take on my patients,” I said hastily, thinking aloud. “My flat can be sold in no time. It is located in a very central location in London, after all.” I looked at Holmes earnestly. “You must know your good health is of the utmost importance to me, Holmes."
“My father wouldn’t know how to plot the demise of a house ant.”
in her eye.
“Until tomorrow,” Sherlock mumbles into the pillow.
The spectre of Mary has its usual effect, putting John in a grim mood. “Yes. Well. Yes. Thank you.”
John swallows. “I didn’t--haven’t dated men, not really.”
Sherlock’s never truly hated the party. He
“I was telling your husband that your daughter reminds me of mine. She was also a happy, beautiful baby with big, blue eyes. Just gorgeous. I do so wish I could see her more often, but she’s all the way in Australia doing god knows what with that
Some uncertain amount of time passes, and John blinks awake and turns his head, meeting Sherlock’s undiverted stare.
“Not at all,” Mummy says. “You are my guest, John. I expect nothing but for you to make yourself at home. And I know you boys set out very early this morning.”
She looks between the two of them and her smile grows unfathomably wider. “But you will still be coming up next weekend for your birthday, won’t you.”
John is anchored in place, rapt.
“Oh, yes,” Hafiz says, looking between John and Sherlock and Rosie. “I was so very sorry to read about your wife. I would’ve contacted you to offer condolences, if I still had your number.”
A host of positively filthy thoughts surface to the forefront of Sherlock’s mind, and he shoves it all away.
“Indulge me, John,” Sherlock purrs.
Though, there is one mercy: John is fully absorbed in typing up a blog post and hasn’t, almost stubbornly so, looked Sherlock’s way once. Sherlock is grateful to be left to suffer sight unseen. But there’s also a niggling, pettish voice in the back of his head that wishes John
“Shut up.” Sherlock carefully lowers John onto the bleachers, taking the seat beside him.
And then they’re kissing--shared muffled noises of bone-deep
But not only that--oh, no.
“We should leave,” John says.
After several minutes of woolgathering and cigarette-puffing, Sherlock lolls his head to the left and finds John leaning louchely against his door and looking back at him with a drunken smile, the dim streetlamp illuminating the clear crystal blue of his eyes.
Sherlock grabs Lestrade by the crook of his arm and drags him into his bedroom.
are you doing?” Sherlock wants to know, John stepping up to Sherlock’s side.
, something else. “I think she’s always had it.”
At the start of the evening, we opened a bottle of whiskey and by the natural progression of things one bottle became two. I had never known Holmes to be an avid drinker of spirits and silently marvelled that he was in his cups that night.
“I may have wanted him to think that you and I were
One may recall when I described Holmes as an automaton. Let it be known I had done so on Holmes’s insistence so he appeared more aloof and mysterious; that was how he wished to be perceived by our readers. After a while, Holmes warmed up to me and was able to express himself more fully—he was caring and loving when he wished to be. He always tried hard to repress his emotions but he became more readable and open as the years passed (Well, at the very least, he did with me).
Holmes was watching me with outright fascination. “You would throw away your life in London to—“
His plan seems to hold up, for a time, until he forgets himself as he stares out the window at a light snowfall, trying his very best to refit his mind back to a state of Johnlessness.
But it doesn't matter how John feels about Sherlock.
John does not turn to acknowledge him, but a muscle in his jaw jumps.
“Is it, though? He and John could pass for the same age.”
“Mr Holmes?”
“Truly,” Hafiz says with a note of sadness. He pushes his son to the forefront. “But, yes! This is my son, Danny. Danny, say hello to John; John and Daddy went to school together.”
,” she teases with a grin.
He bows his head, lowers his voice, and Sherlock strains to hear, can only catch snippets: “...regret...hard feelings...something, back then...nothing...you...”
Lestrade looked on helplessly for a few more seconds until speaking,
The youngest Holmes brother was not known for his deductions on how people were feeling, but the way John walked through the front door a few minutes later was clearly strange. His clothes looked thrown on haphazardly, Sherlock noticed, and his hair was a mess. The normal perfect part and flowing peppered strands looked more like a natural disaster. He was hunched over, eyes glued to the carpet as he strode past Sherlock and locked himself in his room. He would check on John later, Sherlock decided. There were more pressing matters at hand.
“Yes, as you say,” the oldest Holmes brother drawled, “where is he now?”
“Not quite, Rosie. It’s an orange.” he watched her lips mimic his as he sounded it out. John chuckled as her little face contorted.
The man burst out laughing.
“What’ve they all got to do with each other?” it was then that Sherlock’s patient, rewarding facade dropped. He dragged out an exasperated sigh of annoyance and disappointment as if deciding how to respond to such an imbecile question. John decided it was safest if he answered. After all, Greg was their ride back into London.
Shut up, John told himself. You’re here for the case, not Holmes. He can wait.
His last shot almost missed his mouth as he gulped it down. Will followed, adam’s apple bobbing as he swallowed.
“Exactly, John, the case. It’s been a month, and there’s been absolutely no progress whatsoever. That, as I am sure you are well aware, is not normal. I don’t care how chatty or sullen he seems, there is something wrong. However, the good news is, to my knowledge and the knowledge of every single one of my employees, he is not currently using,”
“What do you want,” he mumbled into his pillow. His sheets were practically soaked with sweat, his heart beating faster than the rain pattering at his window.
, He thought. Yet the face spoke.
“It’s time for Anderson to see the other side of a cop car,” the mix of relish and anger was a strange one, but Sherlock strode out of Scotland Yard with a newfound purpose and drive, his blood pumping like it was filled with sweets.
“You’ve never… Done anything like that before, have you?” his voice was gentle, not judgmental or off-put in any way, but somehow it made John feel worse.
“Don’t. It’s irritating,” Sherlock quipped as he stumbled into his chair. He registered John stepping back, mildly hurt.
“Have it your way, then, Sherlock,” The trio dutifully marched up the stairs, the door snapping shut behind John and leaving the smell of rotting corpses outside.
“That’s not a no, Mycroft. Stop playing this sick game with us. It’s fucking over, and you know it,” he had already hung up. John felt the same as he had all those years ago, being played with like a doll to make people laugh. It couldn’t be that complex. Who had grudges against Sherlock? It felt practically rudimentary, but John began to make a list.
“Um, well, three victims. Two female and one male, one of the females lived here. Name was Martha Powers. Other two haven’t been ID-ed yet, but the male was in his late fifties, and the other female was late thirties. Powers was twenty-five. Cause of death for all of them was blood loss, but they all display signs of brute force, so we’re probably looking at a man here,” he was greeted with silence, which lasted for a good few minutes.
“Not quite. I said Will. My name’s Will. And yours?”
“Mycroft,” Sherlock barked, his voice icy.
The name beat in time with his heart, the thick stream of blame running through his veins, up his limbs, making the white bumps writhe with want.
The screen door slammed as Lestrade crossed the threshold and John jumped. Sherlock looked up, his curiosity obviously peaking. Why was it only interest in cases that would dig up his emotions? John shut the thought down as quickly as it came, barely registering it. Lestrade motioned that they follow him into the backyard. The space was large and built up with delicate looking flowers, plants, and shrubs. Must’ve been a gardener, or at least a green thumb, he mused. John didn’t even realize what he was supposed to be looking at until his gaze shifted downwards. He froze. Not only were there three dead bodies, but they were cut up and arranged. He almost couldn’t look as he brought a hand up to his mouth, trying not to retch. Glancing at Greg, he received a grimace. John tentatively stepped closer and a sharp gasp escaped him. The limbs—they spelled something out in the trampled and bloody grass. He stared at the ground, willing his eyes to reveal the deception. It couldn’t be. But the bloody mess ‘MISS ME?’ continued to stare up at him. Oh god. Oh god, no. The letters seared themselves into his brain.
Lighting one of the cigarettes that he had grabbed from his wall stash, Sherlock tried to breathe. A three patch problem… he thought. If only.
“What?” his mouth moved like a dying fish, “How did you know I had lunch with anyone?”
“Oh, John! How good to see you! Sherlock and I just had the most scrumptious tea and biscuits. Would you like some?” she winked at John as she sauntered into the kitchen. He sighed.
“Already on it,” he didn’t even bother to respond to the second part of Sherlock’s request. As he uncapped his pen, John prayed that he would never have to write the name Moriarty down again.
As he gazed, half-lidded, at the board and tried to make deductions, he heard footsteps enter the building. He heard a deep sigh, and although it may have not been about him, Sherlock felt sorry for the second time that morning. He hated feeling emotions. It was his worst flaw, he had decided long ago. That he was a sociopath was his wall of defense, though he would never admit that to anyone, much less himself. However, there was no doubt even to him, that John Watson made Sherlock feel things.
Did Greg not remember what had happened just six months ago? Moriarty had been dead then, too. Sherlock didn’t move, and John elected to stay silent, so Lestrade rambled on.
“No,” he whispered. His head fell back into its place on his hand, cheek slumping.
“What? No, Mycroft. There’s nothing wrong with him, I swear. He’s been reserved, but it’s nothing we haven’t seen before. It’s the case. It’s got us all rattled,”
“Sherlock,” he moaned, “Stop that, please,” padding footsteps neared the bed.
“Eight so far, actually, but your presence is annoying me, so now it’s seven,” John smiled as Donovan scoffed.
John and Lestrade just exchanged glances, resigning to begrudgingly follow Sherlock. The old porch steps creaked as the men descended. Sherlock did not so much as acknowledge their presence, which was customary. He was frantically searching the corpses, looking at them while standing up, squinting against the afternoon sun, then bending down and pulling out his magnifier to stop and inspect every tiny cut and bruise. If only Sherlock doted on the living like this, thought John. He immediately swept the thought away. Mary’s warm, soothing voice filled his mind, sliding into every crevice. Go, Watson. Ask if he needs anything. Make yourself useful! but John needn’t have said a word. Sherlock stood up and locked eyes with him, sending him reeling into the pale depths.
“Oh! Hello!” Moriarty's face contorted into a perfect ‘o’ of feigned surprise. Sherlock shrank smaller against the cold, rough wall.
“John told you,” Sherlock paused and then continued on as if he hadn’t heard him.
Lestrade and John reentered the house as John took out his notepad and a pen.
“No, not really. He’s been out a lot. Says he’s working on the case, but who knows,” Mrs. Hudson clucked and fussed over Rosie, who was busy reaching for more sweets.
Lestrade had still not made a move.
John sighed and left Rosie with Mrs. Hudson, who tittered about the hurry he was always in, and briskly walked out into the cool September air. It took John a good few minutes to catch a taxi, and all the while he could feel his phone vibrating in his pocket. The man just did not give up, did he, John lamented. Secretly, he was pleased. Mary’s voice slithered into his head, always unwelcome. I know what you two could become-
The taxi ride there was a quiet one. Light, dreamy violin played from the cab and Sherlock’s sleeves dripped, the water stain turning his coat a darker black. Charcoal, to onyx. Again, and again. He watched the stain spread. As his thoughts wound their way around his mind, he lifted his sleeve and felt over the bumps with a vacant stare. One, five, nine... The cab stopped. Cold washed over him as he stepped out into the rain.
“Of course not! John Watson, taking my advice! Hand her over, love. Oh, and don’t forget to have fun and tell Sherlock hello from me,” she winked.
In the kitchen, he found John making coffee. Sherlock supposed he should feel grateful, but instead an armored annoyance was all that filled him. He hated it when John acknowledged his weaknesses, even with acts of kindness. Snatching the mug set out on the counter for him, he stomped into the sitting room, saving a flitting grimace for the baby.
It’s a model from the ‘90s, so its age is expected to show, and show it does: peeling ceiling fabric, creaky car seats, poxy doors. At the very least, the heating still works. Sherlock turns the dial to the highest temperature, knowing it’ll take some time for the car to get properly warm.
Sherlock hefts his gift--feels like a jewelry box--and tears off the ribbon and wrapping paper to find...a jewelry box. Never before has he been so disappointed to be right.
“Sherlock!” John yells after him, and he sounds angry. Sherlock doesn’t care. In fact, he welcomes it. Angry sex has all sorts of delightful potential.
at fault, here?
Once I gently slipped the fresh nightclothes onto him Holmes finally looked at me. By the dim light of the singular lamp, which highlighted his angular profile in a ghostly manner, he looked exhausted--and defeated.
“No pointing, that’s rude,” John says, lowering her pointing finger and taking her hand. “Sorry. Hafiz, this is my daughter, Rosie. Say hello to Daddy’s friend, Ro.”
John sniffs, nods once, and marches into the kitchen.
Sherlock opens his mouth slightly to allow John’s tongue in and their lips move together with a pretty, slurping wetness until John resituates himself on his side, with his head on a pillow. Sherlock mirrors him.
Sherlock nods mutely, but adamantly.
“Yeah,” John says, “here,” he turns his head to Sherlock with a devious glint in his eye, “in your poor father’s car with my face buried in your arse not 20 minutes ago.”
Sherlock can only look on at John with grave concern.
Sherlock turns to leave. Takes a step. Pauses. Whirls back around. “Did you kiss me on the pitch?”
“Oops,” Sherlock says dryly.
how gorgeous you are?”
Sherlock’s eyes slide up to meet John’s. He’s not entirely sure how to parse the look on John’s face. A curious smile, glittering eyes. As if he’s not sure what to make of Sherlock even if he’s certain he likes what he sees. They’d used to be so much better at reading each other.
Alongside the warmwet slide of his mouth, Sherlock wraps a fist around the base of John’s cock, his hand picking up the colour there as he pumps, spreading the lipstick over John’s length. John’s cock is defiling Sherlock’s paint, making an obscene art of it, and it is the
“Fine,” John says, strained. “Just. Fantastic.”
“Feels so good,
“I know you’re not,” Mary says in the tired manner of someone who’s said the same thing one too many times. She scrapes her chair backwards and stands up, her bearing and expression resolute. “But I’m not going to live the rest of my life as your second best.”
Straightening back up, his eyes latch briefly somewhere southward of John’s waist, and John valiantly tries to ignore any kind of stirrings in said southward area. He can't help that it likes the attention; Sherlock's attention, in particular.
And, at long last, their lips meet.

It was apparent that an era was ending. I was too late.
"Yeah," John grits out, "I'll make you come."
“I’ll allow that,” I said jokingly, though I was stunned to hear him say so. It was not a word I would ascribe to myself.
Somehow saddened and uplifted all the same by Holmes’s speech, I turned his warm hand around and caressed the back of it lightly with my index finger as if it were fine Chinese silk. Holmes’s fingers twitched at the touch.

Even all these years later, Sherlock is not used to it.

Greg gives him a crooked smile. “Hate to sound like a sappy fuckin’ arsehole, but I’ll only enjoy it if you’re there, you know?”
Despite the frowsty atmosphere of the pub and his perpetual state of exhaustion that certain people have felt the need to point out as a visible marker on his face, John is enjoying himself. For one, it’s a blissful reprieve from Rosie duty, for both him and Mary. And two--John gets to see Sherlock in a purely social context, which is a rarity these days. As he listens to Sherlock expatiate on the tragic love triangle involving the two women and a man sitting at the booth across from theirs, he becomes very aware of how much he’s missed the madman. Every so often, when Sherlock pauses for a breath, Mary peppers Sherlock with questions and challenges his reasoning (to no avail), while John keeps mum, sitting back and allowing Sherlock to perform his magnificence unimpeded. Because it's what John does; it’s what John likes to do.
John leans over, ear out-turned. “I’m sorry, what?”
loved her, he would have made the effort to see her, to speak to her more often. But as he’d grown older, he’d convinced himself that the best way not to get hurt--the best way to funnel the most energy into what he'd thought really mattered, the Work--was to move through life alone.
“Molly isn’t interested. Surely, you of all people can see that.”
Sherlock smiles tautly. “Not in this lifetime.”
Next Saturday, at dawn, they set off on the interminable journey to Yorkshire.
“Dating women is easier than dating men; well, not exactly

“Sorry to--thank you. I wanted to make a toast.” With a shaky hand, she holds up her wineglass. “To the lovely Rosie, on her second birthday.”
Mrs Hudson places her hands on her hips and gives the sitting room a final shufti. “I think it’s nearly done, but I’ll come round tomorrow to do some final touches. Don’t make a mess of the place just yet, we’ve only three more days to go!”
John’s scoffs. “Obviously? Christ’s sake, it was far from
Tiny, shrill voices are too loud.
It’s never been matched.
“Good, ‘cause I’m not. So. You just stormed off. Mrs Watson was concerned.”
“I am very much on, thank you,” Sherlock says sharply. He will not reveal more than he already, clearly, has. “So you may return to the astonishingly dull task of bullying my father with rugby trivia.”
John looks at Sherlock like he is something marvelous.
Sherlock knows, on an intellectual level, that his rancour is misdirected. It’s a fairly rational assumption for this woman, and even the rags, to believe Sherlock and John are a couple. They are living together, and Sherlock is someone valued enough in John’s life to have responsibility for John’s child, to mind her even in the quotidian: picking her up from daycare, taking her to the park or to a restaurant, etcetera. But he can’t help himself; these well-meaning strangers keep dangling the painful untruth of his and John’s relationship under Sherlock’s nose.
“Jesus,” John says, burying his face into hands. “
“Should be proud of your showing, mate,” Greg says. “Still got a bit of the Blackheath magic in you, eh?”
“Nah, I can handle this.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Precisely. So you mustn’t fret.”
“Nothing’s about--this is about nothing. Drank too much. Needed some air.”
The brush of John’s deft fingers against Sherlock’s bare skin is electrifying.
John arches his back. “Yeah, come on. Fuck me, Sherlock.”
And, luckily for Molly, there is something to be done about it.
“I should go over there and--”
“Then why are

“Sherlock Holmes,” I said gravelly, then cleared my throat. “Will you do me the greatest honour and take me as yours?”
Finally: some conviction. Believability. Sherlock may have been a hasty critic.
Holmes did not turn to look at me. “I am not a cripple just yet," he said icily.
“I know. But I felt like such a shit person for even thinking about it. And I thought about it all the time.” He laughs, a sad sound. “I swear, Mary died thinking I was a bloody saint.”
I was taken off guard by the vagaries of his attitude. "No...not quite.”

Sherlock is no longer a brain; he is a mere appendix. And the appendix is his cock.
Sherlock is staring at John, brows knitted together, mouthing
“I think your dad’s plotting my demise as we speak.”
He shouldn’t have said that.
John chuffs out a laugh. “Very generous, darling,” he says as he lowers Rosie’s arm. He casts a longing look over at the kitchen. “You know what? Sod the diet. I’d like some cake myself.”
Sherlock raises an eyebrow. “The sights?”
John grabs his wrist.
“Check out the group chat,” John says, long-suffering. “Twenty-eight somehow

“Oi,” John says, ruffled, swaying back in, but Sherlock presses a hand to his chest to keep him away. “Okay, sorry, but I fully intend to ruin your lipstick job either now or later. So. You'll just need to take your pick when.”
Sherlock hadn’t had good footing. Or, more precisely, he hadn’t expected John to shove him. The man who knows it all hadn’t seen it coming, and it’s John’s turn to feel
And just like that, Sherlock feels as if a great, hulking weight has been lifted from his shoulders--feels light enough to float above all earthly things.
Holmes roved his incisive eyes over me until he stopped to meet my gaze head-on. He looked intense. “Since this is admittedly your area of expertise, I will defer to your explanation. Do you mean what you just said in iterations that would
John nudges Sherlock’s leg with his own. “Be nice.”
Sherlock yanks his arm away and stands up.
“You want to wear the frog hat?” John says, digging in his duffel bag for the monstrosity Mrs Hudson had bought Rosie the other week.
This sudden performance of sexuality, after all these years of being enshrouded in the mystery of whether or not Sherlock acknowledges it, whether or not he partakes in it in any way, shape, or form, is staggering to behold.
“Ooooh, what’s the craic?” Janine says very loudly.
Mycroft’s bored eyes rove over Sherlock and John from head to toe, and Sherlock draws himself up, ready for impact.
But John just giggles harder, and he kisses Sherlock, and then they’re both laughing against each others’s lips.
We drank and conversed and laughed into the wee morning hours until unfinished tea had gone cold and all the whisky was drained from the old bottle. I was more at ease than I had been in a long while. I knew Grief would not disappear in that one evening but in the weeks to come, Grief would rapidly release his grip on me, leaving me to look back upon love lost fondly instead of miserably.
John raises a sardonic eyebrow. “Oh, sorry, you’ve only

“It’s far past midnight.”
John throws a furtive glance at the crowd, then directs his gaze at Sherlock’s lips. “Good?”
When? How often? With whom, precisely? There is so much Sherlock wants to know. So much he hadn’t seen.

Looking to where Sherlock’s drawn his attention, he sees Mary and Greg bumbling back toward them, giggling like a couple of teenagers.
John makes an intrigued noise in the back of his throat. “Drink and a free show; perfect.”
With a sharpshooter's focus, John slides and locks his arms beneath Sherlock’s neck, and Sherlock wraps his arms around John’s shoulders as John continues to pound into him with abandon, and Sherlock bites down at his bottom lip to stop from crying out again--his body is screaming for him to come, so he wraps his hand around his cock, and with John grunting filthily in his ear, white-hot pleasure roils in Sherlock’s core and coils upward through his body and disperses, making him flush, scorching him from head to toe, his mind going static-quiet, and then Sherlock is coming with a dizzying, thunderous intensity, John following shortly thereafter.
John pats Sherlock’s thigh, leaves his hand there. “Yeah,” he says, voice fond. “I know.”

Holmes grunted with assent and began to frig himself on me, each downslide more energetic than the next, his buttocks connecting to my pelvis, the propulsions causing the armchair to slide incrementally backwards.
God, I’m sorry, Mr Holmes('s car).
“Retire!” I cried. “But Holmes, why?”
“So it's a cheat day?” Not Mary says as she glides into the sitting room, eyeing Sherlock up, then targeting in on John with the cake.
Sherlock traces his eyes over the curve of John’s bicep, his short shirtsleeve hugging the muscle, straining against the fabric.
The woman stares at him for a moment, her face contorting in horror. “

John is squeezing Sherlock’s head between his hands and kissing him, a fierce and desperate press of lips to lips, unmoving, spurts of breath coming out of his nose, tasting the salt of a wayward tear (his own or Sherlock’s?), the thrum of his pulse matching the beat of three previously inconceivable words as they strobe in his mind:
"Yeah," John says, feeling cheeky. "Hell, where's my Victoria Cross? I had to endure
“Hey, Sherlock, uh--you okay?” Lestrade asks.
“He said that as well.”
“I have to say," Mary comments, watching Greg effusively clink pints with a spotty constable that John would be hard-pressed to remember by name. “Greg doesn’t look a day over 40.”
John follows after him, shutting the door, then takes a few steps forward, stops, eyes unfocussed on something in the beyond. He looks at Sherlock with ferocious intensity for a beat, then begins to pace like a caged animal, hands balled into fists at his sides.
Sherlock turns to see.
“Wasn’t it just so?” Sherlock chirps sardonically, and he hears Janine snigger beside him. Jamila’s sweet expression falls.
“Homewrecker!” Janine yells.
“Nah. Ain’t possible. Wouldn’t’ve been enough diamond dust,” Wiggins says.
with him.
Sherlock swivels his head.
John punches the blanket off them, unsuctions himself from Sherlock, and rolls away in one swift motion, leaving Sherlock bereft. Catatonic.
It’d been said so casually.
“Yep. Loved it so much he didn’t want to leave.”
“What?” Sherlock says in a spurt of smoke.
“I could say the very same,” I said coolly, throwing out an arm to indicate the bare room. “What on earth are you doing?”
“So,” John says, “think we’ve a handle on kissing? Would it convince your mum of our ‘harmonious recoupling?’”
It is, of course, John, so Sherlock eases into the touch: sturdy and comforting. Eloquent.
“Come on, it’ll be a quick one. Easy answer. Promise.”
Instead of placing the glass down, he holds it out wordlessly to Sherlock.
, eyelids flying open.
John kisses him and pets his hair. Sherlock wishes sorely for his bed back at 221b, wishes for the freedom to hold John close, to wrap himself around him and never let go.
John is well-prepared for this conversation.
These days, Sherlock’s childhood bedroom has taken on a dual purpose, serving as Mummy’s office and a guest room.
“You must know, though.”
“Yeah,” John says, leaning back on the bed with his elbows, spreading his legs into a V. “I’m not sure why we’re wasting any more time.”

Mummy bursts out laughing. The tips of Dad’s ears are a violent pink.
“Because it is. I feel like the luckiest fucking bastard on the planet right now.”
“Postcard from Jack the Ripper,” Lestrade informs the room.

John sniffs. “I don’t dance."
“He always
“Not at all,” Greg says.

“Edmond Locard.”
If he were to, it’d only catalyse the inevitable: horrified, John would hasten to run off with Rosie into the arms of a faceless girlfriend, a wife. And while Sherlock had seen John and Rosie often in the past year, John has only just moved back into 221b, and Sherlock would like to have him there for as long as practicable.
“Look, Constance, darling, I think someone wants to play with you,” the old woman tells the corgi.
Rosie shoots up to standing, bubbling with energy, ready to bolt for the dog.
Sherlock’s touch disappears.
Everyone is waiting to see what Mycroft will do, but he still hasn’t moved, looks as if the entire world has conspired against him. “He is seven years younger than me; surely, the formality is that those who are of a more advanced age--”
Sherlock changes the subject with nary a break in his step. “You’ve been trying far too hard with Lestrade. Here’s some advice: you don’t need to try. He’s attracted to you, and he’s easy to please.”
John’s eyebrows fly to his hairline at the sight of him. “Greg?”

, and it will have to be enough. Because who else, really, in this dreadful world would make so many allowances for Sherlock? Sherlock is ceaselessly rude, inconsiderate, and mercurial by nature. And John accepts him;
“Yes, hello, that’s my prick, which I think you’re well-acquainted with at this point. The soap?”
Janine jumps in, “He’s been too busy brooding over--”
Everyone looks at Constance, who has decided to lie down, chin on her paws, spent from all the excitement. She snuffles contentedly as Rosie continues to stroke her back.
“You were a brill player,” Matterson yells. “It’s our loss!”
My hands fell to Holmes’s waist, bony, protruding from his skin, I kissed him again and I pulled him--warm, lanky and undeniably masculine--close. Holmes did not respond to my kiss, I noticed a moment too late, absorbed in the kiss, and I extracted myself, my heart thudding nervously against my chest.
Mrs Hudson peeks through the blinds of her fingers, slowly lowers her hands.
“It’s...nice to meet you too, Mr Holmes,” Hafiz says carefully, drawing back his hand the moment Sherlock loosens his grip.
Our stalwart armchairs pushed aside, Holmes and I sat on the bearskin hearthrug, he with his long legs outstretched toward the fire, hands propping up from behind, and I in Indian-style. At such a close proximity, I could smell shag tobacco on Holmes’s clothes and lavender on his skin.

It’s become a tradition of sorts to throw a Christmas Eve do at 221b. Heaven knows why. Might’ve been John’s doing. And every year, against Sherlock’s will, the party becomes more and more expansive by way of decorations and guests. This year, Sherlock’s to have his parents, John, Rosie, Molly, Lestrade, Mrs Hudson, Bill Wiggins, and Saville Row Satan in attendance.
Beggars can’t be choosers, Sherlock supposes. At the very least, John’s still in his life, which is something that almost hadn’t been a certainty just a year ago. And they’ve come so very far since.
Sherlock withdraws the pillow from his back and tips over sideways, snuggling up to its welcoming fluffiness and stretching his legs over John’s lap. Because it seems to be the sort of thing John doesn’t mind at the moment.
have known. He obfuscated, but I still should have known. I wasn’t myself, yet. And I didn’t make that mistake again.”
John indignantly places (or, more accurately, bangs) his pint glass back onto the table. “Come on, now.”
“No, believe me, if I wanted a compliment, you’re the very last person I’d go to.” Sherlock supposes he has a very good point. “Dunno. I just can’t ever get a sense of what you really think of me. Sometimes, I think I’ve got it. But then I’m second guessing myself.”
Sherlock had not heard Mummy’s approach, but she has perfected the art of creeping up on him unawares; one of the very few people to succeed in such an endeavour. Her face and eyes are swollen pink, but she is, quite paradoxically, smiling, and dare Sherlock think it, but there’s simply no more picturesque way to describe it--she has a
John tunes out in favour of watching Sherlock’s lips move. And they are moving. Fast. They’re also pink and pretty. And quite pretty. Also: pink.
Though...neither is a funeral, generally.
Lestrade wrinkles his nose in distaste at Sherlock before turning to face Molly. “Molls,” he says decisively.
“Yeah.”
John isn’t gay, and he’s not straight, either, but he’s not exactly divulged that to anyone over the past 18 years--since his self-realisation--and isn’t about to start now. It would change everything, were he to come out. It’d change how people see him and how he’s meant to be and live his life. And, more importantly, John had made a vow to Mary. He’s not free. He has a daughter who needs a mother. Two parents.
“No one asked you,” Sherlock barks.
Sherlock gasps into John’s mouth. “Very slow, indeed. This--it’s practically courtship.”
Sherlock positions himself at John’s side and takes a moment to admire John’s eyelashes. Under the haphazardly-strung cool white fairy lights above the bar, his blond eyelashes are limned gold. Sherlock has never thought eyelashes beautiful before, but he’s also never fallen victim to such egregious poeticism before.
If the day continues in the same vein, this really will be Sherlock's best birthday yet.
“Right.” John slams his laptop shut, shoots up to his feet. “Get dressed. We’re going out.”
John isn’t looking at him, gazing unblinkingly out at the stretch of suburban solitude. “And if you were to tell me to sod off, right now, which you probably should do, I’ll be glad you at least gave me a chance.”
Sherlock shoves John’s hand away. “Tickety-boo,” he says through clenched teeth, bringing himself to his feet and striding over to Hafiz, ploughing through the ebbing pain. “Apologies for my rather inelegant introduction; I’m not usually so gormless.” He sticks out his arm expectantly, and Hafiz hesitantly takes the offering. They shake, and Sherlock squeezes the life out of his hand, pinioning him with his eyes, wanting to know everything him, more than the eye can see. Wanting to know about this man (this
John does not disguise his surprise. “Yeah?”
“There is a facility in Wiltshire that used to conduct highly dangerous experiments involving the aforementioned agents, amongst other things,” Mycroft says coolly. “The facility has quite a history--it’s been around for almost a century now. The nerve agent trials went on up until the late ‘80s. Military volunteers were recruited to participate in these trials; fatalities were not uncommon.”
John looks down at their table, which confirms his suspicion. There are 2 abandoned shots in front of Sherlock, and he’s only taken a few birdlike sips of both. Sherlock is definitely not drunk.
“Get the fuck off me!”
Sherlock tuts. “Would someone please replace Lestrade’s whiskey with water?”
It’d been difficult to ignore.
it. But I could say the same exact bloody thing to you and...” Lestrade peers down the hall into the sitting room, then looks back at Sherlock sheepishly. “You know.”
He listens to them descend the stairs, feeling utterly bereft.
John leads him into the hallway, their hands still clasped, and comes to a halt, giving a cursory glance at the closed door of Sherlock’s bedroom before turning around so he can back Sherlock up against the wall. He places a hand on Sherlock’s neck, and Sherlock angles his head, dips down while John presses up.
It was so grippingly tight--tighter than a woman--and warm inside. The added pressure to my aroused prick was unspeakably divine.

“Happy.
John comes bustling in, handing Molly and Lestrade their wineglasses re-filled to the brim.
John’s line “‘Enjoyable companion’ makes me sound like a fucking dog” was something Martin Freeman said in an old cast interview. The cast was talking about what qualities of their characters they share, and Amanda said Martin is loyal, like John, and Martin responded with something along the lines of “Why does everything people say about me make me sound like a fucking dog?” It was very Martin, and somehow also John.
“Please pancake,” Rosie amends, somewhat.
“A kiss,” Sherlock says.

John had
Sherlock keeps his face very still.
It’s clear that the situation isn’t going to pivot in their favour any time soon, so Sherlock decides to make the best of it. He’s always been partial to dogs, after all.
Rosie goes still at that, her face crumbling. She looks down at the carnage she’d wrought, and her face twists in the all too familiar contortion that precedes a cry.
John clasps the offered hand, gives it a pump. “The sentiment’s mutual, sir.”
Sherlock assents begrudgingly--he must be on his best behaviour for the sake of Rosie's future at this establishment (and for the sake of avoiding John's wrath)--and the woman turns around, holds the mobile above their heads.
“Well, now you know.”
“This was a poor choice of location,” Sherlock says, shooting deeply disdainful looks at John's teammates, who cower under Sherlock’s knife-like judgment. “Particularly with the weather we’ve been having. It’s hardly your fault.”
“Go on, then,” Wiggins says cheekily. “Give MI-5 a snog.”
John looks at Sherlock, burrows into him. "Feeling a lot better now, actually."
Sherlock smiles mirthlessly. “Do go on.”
John throws an unreadable glance at Sherlock then engulfs a heaping forkful of cake over Rosie’s head.
"Though, if I see you in lingerie
“Well. I suppose I revere our great institutions."
“Just like that.”
“Do stop talking.”
“I am sorry to have arrived unwarranted,” I said with a watery smile.
At the front of the room, Mummy is holding a tray of filled champagne flutes. She zips from person to person, handing them off, then plucks up one of her own and takes the floor.
All he can think of is
Sherlock huffs and jumps off the bed onto his feet. "Keep it in the bag. I'd rather be ready to leave at a moment's notice.”
“But why can’t soldiers kiss and make up?” Molly asks diplomatically.
Sherlock gives John a curt nod before spinning his dance partner around so his back is to Starr.
As a last-ditch effort, he pulls out the velvet ring-box, opening it and leaning across the table on his elbows in supplication. The white-gold ring, which had seemed to glimmer with promise at the jeweler’s, looks dull and tawdry beneath their weak kitchen lighting.
John giggles, and Sherlock can feel its vibration in his core. “Only
Holmes brought our clasped hands close to his heart, looked up at me and said, with unvarnished sincerity, “Watson, you count for everything.”
“Oh,” John says, and Sherlock winces at the dejected tone of his voice. “I’m--a complete idiot.
But Sherlock has no data on men.
“If there is anyone who does not have a problem finding a partner with whom to have sex, it’s you, John. In 2011, for example, you dated 43 women.”
Sherlock doesn’t get to hear which epithet he is tonight, because he cups the back of John’s head and collides his mouth into John’s.
But he’d known, after meeting John, that he’d fallen in love.
It doesn’t take much after that.
me. You’ve had an attitude with Jamila since I started dating her!”
“That is decidedly not how--”
“Siger,” Mummy scolds.
“Yeah. You changed my life.” John keeps his eyes trained on Rosie as he speaks. “I’ve never been a lucky man--god, not in the least--but, somehow, I was allowed this. Somehow, I was allowed Rosie. And you.”
“Fucking Christ,” John hisses.
But she’d have to be, wouldn’t she, if she’d wanted to be successful at her chosen criminal enterprise.
“That’s hardly what we’ve been pretending to be.”
“--Hence 3,294 days--
John looks at him for a moment, expression turning positively lecherous, and he licks his lips, throws the flannel aside. Crooks a finger at Sherlock. "C'mere."
“I am moving to Sussex,” he said with an unapologetic plainness.
“I’m surprised I’ve not yet died of the suspense. Do say what it is you wish to say, John,” Holmes said without opening his eyes, a small smile playing at his lips.
Being in closer proximity, Sherlock can more effectively scan the woman from head to toe, and he reads her story in her brittle hair and fingernails, in her sallow skin and cheap clothes:
. (He hopes he doesn't look anything like a blushing schoolboy.) “I’m simply not--used to it.”
“Appreciate the thought--immensely,” he rumbles into Sherlock’s ear. “But our first time is
Sherlock concedes this. “True. It was rather a conscious effort for it not to be.”
Splayed on the floor, Sherlock, looking oddly contrite and small and nothing like the Sherlock John had once known, holds out a placating hand. “Let me explain.”
The honesty is not only refreshing, but emboldening, so Sherlock pulls the car into the deserted road’s shoulder, kills the engine, and turns to face John.
“Just a hunch,” John says with a tiny smile that Sherlock finds himself mirroring. A nod at the sketches in Sherlock’s hands. “Are those yours?”
“Fantastic,” John says without any trace of enthusiasm, unable to meet Mummy’s eye as he carefully unwinds his arm from Sherlock and climbs off the bed, restoring his sleep-worn clothing into some semblance of order. “Sorry, it was rude of us to fall asleep on you.”
