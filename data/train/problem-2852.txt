. Castiel looked back at the door, half-checking to make sure it was closed. Dean might have meant an actual pizza delivery person. And an actual babysitter. “I’m not supposed to talk about it.” He chanced a look at Dean again, whose face registered confusion and irritation. “It’s classified. I’m sorry.”
It also occurs to me that we have your publishing contract to contend with. I’m not sure if they will approve of us writing together, but I have a few ideas that might protect you. We can talk about them more in depth tonight. Perhaps your brother will weigh in as well.
“It’s not a human soul. Not fully-formed, I imagine. As long as I have enough grace, I may be subject to the cosmic entity’s authority.”
“Ten points to the emotionally constipated boyfriend! Yes, it’s Hebrew. And it has three parts. We’ll work backwards. The last two letters—in English or Hebrew, as it turns out—make up one of Dad’s old names, before humans got creative and pretentious: El. The letter before it is a suffix meaning ‘my.’ Quick Hebrew grammar lesson: the ‘my’ modifies the part that comes before it, not the part after. What we’re left with is
“You can make a platypus if you want. But we don’t have a platypus cookie cutter. How about an alligator?”
“You can do a lot of things,” Castiel said, thinking it through. “And you had the benefit of the angel tablet. But no…I don’t think you could create a soul. Which must mean…I already have a soul.”
Sam continued watching as the names scrolled by, marveling at the magnitude of work it must have taken to create just a few hours of entertainment. When the movie ended, he put the DVD away and turned off the TV before joining the others in the kitchen. As he got out lettuce, vegetables, and a couple of hard-boiled eggs for a salad, he watched, amused, as Castiel seemed to follow Dean’s every action, winding up in Dean’s way far too often for coincidence.
“These aren’t your true form,” Sam said, nodding. “Of course. I wouldn’t be able to see them otherwise. But these are going to need to be cleaned before I can treat the wounds.”
“Were you not paying attention any of the, oh, hundred or so times we’ve talked about this?” Dean asked, frustration coloring his voice.
He was about to clean the upper wound in the second wing when the lights all came back on, followed a few minutes later by a loud knocking at the bathroom entrance.
Crowley stared at Dean for several long moments before he smiled broadly and glanced at Sam. “Afraid I’m going to have to pass on that drink. This is
Something else shifted in his mind then. Images from his memories—Avraham, Yitzhak, Lot, Jonathan, David—in every one, he was advocating life. Human life meant little to most angels. Mud monkeys, eking out a few years of what passed for living, then tucked away in their private heavens. But their lives
The stranger nodded once and was silent for a moment. “I can see I need to convince you another way. I
“No.” Dean stood up and got a bottle of water out of the mini-fridge. He gestured to everyone else to see if they wanted one, but had no takers. “Cas was thinkin’ that too, for a while. That he was just a tool to be used, a hammer. Without his grace, he was useless.” He took a few swallows of water. “And that’s bullshit. For him and for you. Yeah, you can do some crazy things with your power, but that’s not who you are.”
so…so Wally wouldn’t suspect anything. I stood there like a helpless statue when you were dying, and
“Let’s just take him to the dungeon,” Dean said, fed up with Crowley’s games. “Lock him up until he’s a little more compliant.”
Castiel took the opportunity to shift his hips, trying to adjust the pressure within his pants, but the movement had the opposite effect and the moment Dean sank his fingers into a particularly sensitive area of his wing, Castiel couldn’t help but thrust his hips up into the air, letting out a loud moan.
“Dean, you cannot!” Castiel said without his usual greeting, his hands held up in front of him to bar Dean’s way.
His left wing didn’t look right, as if it wouldn’t fold correctly, and without thinking, Dean put his hand to the feathers, feeling something warm and sticky as well as cool and nebulous. Withdrawing his hand, he saw blood and thin tendrils of grace.
When Castiel entered Dean’s room, he was surprised to find Dean sitting on his bed, writing something on a piece of paper. There was no way Dean could have overheard their conversation about the bulletin board through his closed door.
. Man, that was a trip. And now this…demon part. I know it’s not really a demon, but it’s easier to think of that way. That makes, what, seven?”
“I’ve been involved in many things, Dean. At any rate, I didn’t do much. Just reminded him that he had all he needed to defeat Goliath.”
With barely a nod to Jonathan, he flew to Naomi’s office to find her waiting for him. With her drill. He bowed his head in shame.
“Relax, Squirrel,” Crowley said, looking up with a bored expression. “I’ll neither eat all your gummi bears nor drink all your liquor.”
Dean kept his eyes on the road, scanning for any signs of speed traps, his hands tight on the wheel. It wasn’t an appropriate time for music; his nerves were too shot. Instead, he focused on the mile markers, each one counting down the time until they were home.
“You just made it a thing by saying you supposed we were,” Dean argued, sliding back under the covers.
. It’s been used to help war veterans for years. And that’s kind of what Cas is, right? A veteran of lots of wars?”
“Maybe I should just…give up. Go work with Bobby. Every time I think I’ve gotten away from being screwed over, I get thrown another curveball.”
At that, Michael smiled. “You’re the playful version of Gavriel. Practicing less self-discipline. Or…” Michael assessed Gabriel carefully. “Maybe practicing none at all.”
“He’s a survivor. He’ll come out on top no matter what he does. And he wouldn’t be where he is if he wasn’t an expert at reading the writing on the wall.”
“That’s…” Dean shook his head slowly, “crazy. And cool.” There was what looked like admiration in his eyes. “So…they’re there right now? Even if I can’t see them?”
They drove for just over three hours with little conversation. Dean asked if Cas minded music and received little more than a tiny shrug in response. Unsure if he’d said or done something to piss the angel off—again—he started to ask what was wrong and then reconsidered. He was not interested in having a talk about anyone’s feelings, hurt or otherwise. If Cas was peeved, he’d have to speak up.
—didn’t determine who I was. Neither did she.” He looked at Michael. “This is the choice you’re talking about?”
“Exactly. Anything like that. Memories might or might not come up. Your subconscious is actually leading this. Or at least, that’s how it would work for humans. We’re hoping that’s how it’ll work for you too.”
several times—whatever that entailed—and banished from Heaven, deprived of his grace. Experience had consistently taught Dean that emotions were liabilities. There’s a reason Sam was such a fantastic hunter when he was missing his soul, even if he was a crappy brother as a result.
There were frequent texts with Cas, and Skype sessions most evenings. Dean even got an introduction, such as it was, to Bal, when Cas’ brother plopped down heavily next to Cas on the sofa, and invited them—complete with Skype connection—to an orgy. On Friday morning at ten o’clock on the nose, Dean received a text from Cas that simply said, “Happy one-week anniversary, Dean.” Prior to meeting Cas, Dean would have thought such things romantically sappy, or maybe just nauseatingly sappy, but he found that he kind of liked it. Simple things, like that text, could make his whole day.
Dean had to fight the urge to defend Cas, even as he recognized his own prejudice of traditionally published authors over self-published ones. Traditional publishing, with its agents and editors and gatekeepers, was how publishing had always been done. Wasn’t it?
He’d given up having the apple pie kind of life he’d wanted with Lisa. He always thought it was the life that he couldn’t have. What if Lisa just wasn’t the right person?
“Right.” Hester’s expression was somewhere between confused and irritated. “So, pick any chair you want, except the far left. That one’s mine. I’ll get the name cards set out, and the room monitor is coming with water bottles for everyone. The mics are already on, but we won’t start recording the panel until we actually start.”
I’m positive. will be in my room when u get back. hunt went well. 1 less ghost. u can tell dean that much.
“He—” Dean held his stomach as he laughed. “And then you shook it before pouring for you and Jess? Oh God… Are there photos?”
. He cursed his guilty conscience and made a decision. “Cas, wait. I’ll go with you. Sam, why don’t you go to Colorado. You’ve got a handle on this, and you’re way better with kids than I am. If this is just a salt-and-burn, you’ll be done by tomorrow night and we can meet you back here.”
imagine him folding his wings behind him. But that didn’t make sense; why would he still have them spread out? “I’m not really from social services,” Cas said. “I’m an a—”
“Unknowingly,” Cas answered. “But even the things you did with full knowledge, some of which you felt you had no choice about, you see them as being unforgivable. But that’s not how I see you. I still see that brilliant soul that captivated me all those years ago.”
The first clue that things were not right was when they approached the van with their bags of food. Castiel saw it first. “Dean. Look at the back window.”
“He didn’t teleport,” Castiel answered. “I’m certain of that. He simply…ceased to exist in this dimension. He was here, and then he wasn’t.”
“I would feel better about this if we could actually summon him,” Cas said, coming up to stand next to Dean as he shook his blade out of his coat. “Or if we knew whom we were summoning. I want to be ready for anything.”
“No!” Dean could feel his cheeks coloring. “No, I just…” He scrambled for words that wouldn’t sound cheesy.
“You’re talking in riddles. Can you just undo whatever you did and help us figure out how to get back to our own universe?”
“It didn’t go unnoticed by me either,” Castiel muttered, remembering Metatron’s betrayal, having his grace stolen, becoming human. He also remembered finally talking to Sam about what had happened when Metatron stole his grace, that Sam had called it a twisted, angelic version of rape.
“We’re not…” Dean said, feeling sudden adrenaline course through his body, “I don’t know what you’re thinking, but Cas and I are not… We’re just friends. Okay?”
“For humans, yes,” Cas said. “Not for angels. We are given orders. We fulfill them or we fail. An angel that fails often is…reset. A string of failures could create doubt. Fear. We were created to fear nothing. Doubt nothing. This is my failing.”
Cas’ breathing evened out, and Dean was pretty sure he’d fallen asleep. And what was the protocol with using the bond during sleep? Was Cas’ essence awake in there, able to use the bond while his body rested? Could Dean push certain emotions through intentionally? Could they provoke
“No, you had an impact. It was Avraham’s argument with Father that will allow us to escort Lot’s family out of the city in the morning.”
“Okay, hang tight, Cas. I’m gonna talk to Sam real quick and I’ll come get you. We’ll deal with the truck later.”
There was no time to answer, as his entire body reacted, arching up off the bed as his own climax exploded within him, sending sparks showering down in his brain. The next thing Dean was aware of was Cas pulling out and Dean’s own oversensitive nerves giving a last valiant pulse of pain/pleasure before he felt cool and empty.
“Thank you. Okay, so numerous miraculous healings in Waterville. Would that be enough to get Tristan and Ross to investigate?”
“Dean?” A woman in her thirties with shoulder-length blond hair and dressed in a simple suit held out her hand in greeting. “I’m Hester. I’m your moderator for this panel. It’s lovely to meet you in person.”
Dean shrugged as if he was trying to look nonchalant. “Mine are mostly buried under gallons of booze and a mountain of determination and self-blame.”
“Still too much on the cryptic,” Gabriel said, holding his head in his hands. “Stop making puzzles for us to solve.”
So when Cas called unexpectedly late Sunday morning, Dean was instantly in a good mood. “Hey Cas,” he answered as soon as the call connected.
“Oh them?” the barista said, nodding at the line. He turned abruptly to the kitchen area and yelled, “
“Babe, I know you’ve got this whole industrial vibe going on, but why this?” Dean pointed to a sign above the sink that read: no food waste in drains. use sealed bins to dispose of all materials. no chemical waste permitted. close valve after using. “Did you find this at a flea market or something?”
“They can’t get in the door if they can’t see,” Gabriel said. “They can’t chase you either. Who else is here beside your wife and daughters?”
Cas reached forward, then sat back with a spiral notebook in his hand. “I’m going to take some notes. These won’t leave my possession.”
“How can you need my help? You’re dead.” Castiel remembered Metatron’s cruel trick at the Gas-n-Sip. Of course Metatron would have exploited his hope that Gabriel might still be alive.
“Yes, Dean, but the Peruvian jungle doesn’t extend far into Ecuador, and he would encounter a border crossing if he started in Ecuador and moved into Peru.”
Dean shook his head. “No. No one here ‘cept me and my mom and dad. And the baby in my mom’s belly. But we can’t see the baby yet.”
“I thought so at first. But there was a boarder living with them, according to the census. Gwendolyn Vosser, twenty-five, unmarried, with an unnamed newborn baby. Newspapers don’t mention her at all, and I can’t find her in the 1930 census.”
And that was it, wasn’t it? With his blade, he was still in control, the weapon an extension of himself. But with the gun, he was one step removed. Aim, pull, and hope for the best. No guarantees, no certainty. It was imprecise and human and he hated it.
“When you find it, let me know,” Dean said. “I’d pay money to see that. Well, someone else’s money, but still…”
Dean took a long breath in and let it out slowly. “Yeah. I just…um…” He bit his bottom lip nervously, not sure what to say.
Glancing at his own matching ring, Dean felt a little choked up. “I’ll still take you up on that,” he managed to say.
Castiel opened the door and walked with Dean through the mist to the other end of the hallway. At the door on the end, he knocked.
“Nothing of importance. Please drive the routes to the Capitol Mall a couple more times. I’m working out some ideas.”
“You a hunter too, or you got some other fake life like him?” Hunter Dean asked, stabbing his thumb over his shoulder toward Husband Dean.
Castiel smiled, fighting his own tears. “Yes. I don’t know how exactly you’ll see me, but when you wake up in Dean’s body in the real world, you will see me. And I will see you. I’ll always know you’re there.” He looked around the group. “All of you. Every time I look at Dean, I will see each of you. Know that I love you.”
Dean accepted his hand and stood, following him out of the room and wondering why he was holding Cas’ hand when he didn’t need to.
“I’ll look them over, Dean. I can give you my legal advice and then my brotherly advice, but you know they might not advise the same course of action. You’re in a cutthroat business that likes to chew up authors and spit them out when they stop earning enough money.”
There was a clap of indoor thunder, a kind of concussive burst, and there they were, feathers rustling as if in anticipation.
“Dean’s allergic to cats,” Cas said. “It would be impolite to bring one into the bunker. Also, they are frequently disagreeable.”
After brushing his teeth, Sam took a detour on the way back to his room. The room he’d found Gabriel in earlier wasn’t made up for sleeping; it was a bare mattress in a dusty, unused room. It didn’t sit right with him to leave Gabe with such paltry accommodations.
Sam motioned for Castiel to follow him out, turning off the light and closing the door as they left.
“Assault is still against the law, I’m pretty sure. And it’s still rude to be…rude.” He let out a long sigh. “Never thought I’d say this, but I’m looking forward to being back at the bunker.”
“PRHB is not promoting ‘just you,’” Bela snapped in return from her office in Manhattan. “We’re promoting Dean Winchester, bestselling fantasy author. You’re not just a person anymore, Dean. You’re a brand. You need to be front and center, smiling while you sign books, chat up the fans, the whole nine yards. I want great photos to use for publicity. And I need to preapprove all your social media posts from now on.”
Dean examined the route they’d planned south across Minnesota and into Iowa. “Sound,” he said finally. “If we go lights-out tonight, with Baby already black, we’ll be hard to see. But she’s not exactly quiet. I can’t guarantee no checkpoints or demons though.”
Tapping the name into the search engine, Dean wondered if Cas had an alert set up under his own name. He’d have to ask. When the search results came up, Dean’s heart sank. “Son of a bitch.”
Dean swallowed instead of saying what first came to mind. He’d hoped not to have a sulking Gabe in the back seat, but a pissed off archangel wasn’t high on his list either. “So what do peace and cooperation have to do with indulgence? And for that matter, how do the ‘just desserts’ figure in?”
Carefully watching around him, Castiel altered direction and headed back toward his original destination. He knocked once, waited, listening intently, and knocked again when there was no response. “Dean.” He spoke softly but urgently so that none of the other Deans could hear him.
“We all want to go back,” Sam added. “Our mom, she’s trapped in yet another world. The one where that Michael has been waging war. People are dying. Our Lucifer is there as well, and…” Sam made a helpless gesture with his hands. “We’re the only ones who can stop it.”
“An organic compound produced by bacteria, yes,” Cas said. “The compound C-twelve, H-twenty-two, O.”
“Crowley put you up to this?” Dean demanded from where he stood across a grocery loading zone. Cas, standing behind Dean, had done whatever he did with his angel blade, disappearing it until next time, but looked like he was ready to draw it again.
“Are you sure?” the stranger asked. “Your van is damaged, and dawn is an unusual time to check out the geographic center of the U.S.”
“You’re not the first one to ask me that. I am certain that you don’t die or disappear. You become part of a greater whole. From all the research Sam has done, you’re an important part of the whole Dean. You’re still needed, but you’re needed along with all the other parts, working together as one.”
Castiel held the Glock 17 firmly in his hand, the weapon heavy now that the clip was full. It didn’t have the balance of his blade, nor the lightness that allowed him to move in fluid motions. It was cold. Impersonal.
Castiel wanted to explain, but the need for Dean’s forgiveness was like that one feather that was out of place, twisted just the wrong way, and he was unable to concentrate on anything else. He had to make this right. “It would be easier for me to explain if I knew how to earn your forgiveness.”
“Yeah, I think I understand.” Dean seemed to realize he was the only one eating the bacon and moved the plate closer to Sam, his eyebrows raised in question.
After a few hours, Sam had cleared the frost line, approximately a foot deep, in the area he and Izzy suspected they’d find Gwendolyn. She’d told him that those buried in the potter’s field were in plain coffins, each marked on the tops and sides with an identification number, and a call to the county records office confirmed that Gwendolyn and her baby—assuming the bones were indeed theirs—were buried together in coffin number 71982.
grace? It wasn’t because I was strong enough. There were plenty of other angels just as strong or even stronger than me. It wasn’t because I was a warrior. Yet you singled me out. Why?”
“I believe I know Raphael better than you would, so I will take care of him,” Cas said. “And I would not presume to understand your characters as well as you do. Let’s work out the major plot points over the next week or so and then we can start writing some draft parts and see where it goes from there.”
“Look, Cas, I don’t like you messing around in my head, and I don’t want anyone messing around yours either.”
“Yeah, Cas. ‘Sides, I was really hopin’ you’d have listened to it already. It, uh… It kinda says some of this.”
“Uh…” Dean was getting nervous as the line behind him grew. “I don’t wanna take up more time. Just the coffee is fine.”
“Yeah, I’ll show you who’s better,” Cain said, stomping back out of the field and past Castiel again.
“Cas, I think the entire universe knows. Everyone except Dean. But that doesn’t explain why he had his gun on you. Why he
Dean stood and crossed the short space between them, then sat down next to Cas on the bed. He studied Cas’ face, his eyes, what he might identify in them. Still compassion, but he could see the admiration there and desire. As he watched, Cas’ pupils dilated, and that was all the encouragement he needed.
What, then? Peace? Would he even know what to do with himself if the world was at peace? This world didn’t seem to have any impending apocalypses, no wars between Heaven and Hell, no angels and demons battling it out with humans as the pawns between them. If it wasn’t for his mom being trapped, he could see Gabriel’s point. This was a pretty good world to be stuck in.
“Yeah, that’s a good start.” Dean looked at the empty table again, shook his head, and led them all outside.
“Exactly. This is like the planes. The physical plane would be the skin, the outermost covering. What you’d see with your eyes. The etheric plane is the next page, the one you’d see when you peel the skin page away.”
“Okay. Yeah. I get it. But Jack’s gone. He thinks he’s evil. Gabriel took off somewhere and said he wants to stay. Dean’s mad at everyone. And I don’t know what to say or do to bring everyone back together.”
“He’s going to be okay, though, right?” Finally, the onramp to I-35E southbound was in view. If he could get them out of the city before the cops could scramble helicopters and get other departments involved, they had a chance.
“You won’t, Cassie. You don’t have to meddle to do that. Have a little faith, bro.” Gabriel paused, then winced. “They know you’re here. You need to go back. Report to Naomi.”
“I have made some truly spectacular mistakes,” Cas admitted. “Far beyond anything you’ve done. But they were all made out of a desire to protect the ones I love.” He glanced at Dean, then their intertwined fingers.
lose control? “It’s…very…pleasant,” he choked out, trying to resist another full-body shudder. “But I should not lose control of my vessel like this.”
He felt Dean’s tongue touch his lips in a tentative movement and opened his mouth a bit, hoping Dean would try again. When he did, Castiel met Dean’s tongue with his own, and the intimacy of the touch, the warm, smooth glide, had his entire vessel moving back and forth slowly, like the slow beat of wings through an open sky.
So now they’d met an angel in this universe. Funny how it didn’t matter what universe it was, the supernatural always found them first. But this angel apparently wanted to play mind games with them, while diminishing Cas to little more than a scared child. He picked up a rock from the base of the stone marker and threw it at the covered picnic area, hearing it bounce off one of the wooden supporting posts.
“What are you gonna do then, Cas? If Heaven dies, do you keep being an angel? And if you become human again, what happens when you die?”
“Yes. This part is unnaturally strong. I don’t think it’s truly a demon, nor do I think this part still bears the Mark of Cain. It’s all of these. It’s rage and darkness and endless pain.”
“I’m not saying it hasn’t,” Sam said. “Just…maybe for a while we pick cases where we can talk first and shoot later. I’ll tell Jody too, so she knows.” He pulled out his phone and sat down at the map table. “Think I’ll chat with Alex too, let both her and Jody know how well EMDR worked.”
Cas had assured him that the electromagnetic pulse would disable all the law enforcement vehicles’ computer-controlled engines, their radios, cell phones, and any other electronic equipment long enough for them to get away. By the time the cops’ radios or cell phones could connect again, and they could call for backup, the Impala would be out of traffic camera range, lost somewhere in a hundred thousand acres of farmland.
“Routine protocol now, sir.” The officer nodded to one of the National Guardsmen on the passenger side, who opened the back door.
Dean closed the distance between them and captured Castiel’s mouth in a kiss that promised much more to come. With insistent nibbles and a tongue that demanded entry, Dean wound up laying half on Castiel before he broke for air. “We need fewer clothes,” he said, breathing heavily. He climbed off the bed and held out his hand to pull Castiel up.
“It was just…every spring, she’d get excited about her roses blooming. Spring meant color. It meant life. And then she was gone.” Dean sat up a little straighter on the bed and looked at the display of guns again. “Death follows me, man. I kill. I kill and I torture and everyone around me dies.” He looked back at Cas. “At least once. Spring…Spring just reminds me of what I can’t have. And Mom’s alive again, but she’s still not back. She’s not the mom I remember. She’s not the mom with the roses.”
“He’s not an idiot,” Castiel warned. “And I can’t. He doesn’t feel the same way. In fact, I’m reasonably certain he’d be disgusted or scared away. I don’t want to risk what we have now.”
“Exactly. It’s setting things up this way precisely so you can process what happened to you. Make sense of it. Put it into context with everything else you know.”
“No.” Cas shook his head. “Not specifically. Perhaps my superiors knew. All I knew was that you needed to stop, or the entire world was at risk. The more you gave in to the demands of the demon blood, the more of yourself you lost, and the more danger that put everyone in.”
“Sorry.” At some point his eyes slid shut and he was unaware of the movie ending until Dean was jostling him awake.
Guilt and anger began a brief battle before guilt won. “Yeah…uh…sorry, Cas. I know you know how to drive. Thanks for the breakfast.” He grabbed a cake donut with rainbow sprinkles.
“No.” Castiel considered several options, choosing the one that made the most sense. “I will change now, and manifest my wings if necessary. If it’s not necessary, I can wear my coat over this,” he held up the bag, “to cover the openings. I believe it’s big enough.”
breakfast. I’m gonna go shower. I have a pretty good idea of how to start EMDR, Cas, so we can get going once I’m done.”
“Great. Fan-friggin-tastic.” Dean chewed on his lip as he drove, nudging the speed up to ninety-three. “So, you got both a clock and a whole astronomical chart in your head, huh? Anything else you want to share?”
“No.” Dean shook his head. “You don’t need to apologize. I’m just saying, how can you say he didn’t hurt you? I
Dean kept glancing in the rearview mirror for any change in the backseat. He kept the Impala at two miles below the speed limit, wary of speed traps and patrolling law enforcement that might have received a call about an angel jail break and a vintage, road-grime-crusted, black, four-door sedan.
There was no easy way to answer that accurately, so Castiel nodded. “Is there a helper who lives here?”
Dean paused for a moment, unsure how to answer that when the author was sitting literally six feet away. “I guess it would depend on whether they thought the angel was a threat to humanity.”
“I don’t want you trying to call new parts of Dean out without me. Just in case he goes for a gun again. Or worse.” Sam grimaced and ran a hand through his hair. “Can you put him to sleep again for the whole night?”
“I can’t have what I need, so I’m going out for a walk,” Castiel said, leaving the kitchen as fast as he dared, and trying to stay away from Dean. “Don’t follow me.”
Fingers stilled for a few moments, then resumed. “It’s a long story that I can go into in more depth with copious quantities of alcohol. But the short version is that my mother and older brother—Michael, the one in air force intelligence—are looking for me. Perhaps ‘hunting me’ is a better term.”
Dean’s four-year-old self made some quite amusing facial expressions while choking down the dream root, and was instantly asleep. After Sam removed Dean’s boots, Castiel lay down carefully next to him on the bed and closed his eyes, easing into the meditative state that would allow him to enter Dean’s dreams. Or in this case, with any luck, his fractured internal landscape.
Castiel gave a half nod. “Gabriel is alive. He’s imprisoned in St. Paul, Minnesota and scheduled to be executed in less than three days.”
“Sam has a point,” Castiel said, breaking into the conversation for the first time. “It would actually be quite the strategic move. It’s something I will need to look into when Gabriel is safe.”
As Sam’s hand lowered, Castiel felt a calmness that he hadn’t felt in ages. A surety that he would find a way through this, even if he still lacked direction. He breathed in slowly, easily, imagining he was again inhaling those colorful wisps, reclaiming the parts of him that had been taken, whether by violence or misguided attempts to help. As he exhaled, he let go of the ties to Naomi. It didn’t matter that she was still alive, keeping Heaven running. Where it mattered, he’d won. She couldn’t hurt him anymore.
“I don’t,” Castiel said. “Religion is a human construct. Sometimes it’s the only way you humans can understand certain truths, and even then your religious institutions warp it into something it was never intended to be for their own political power. With the combined energy around prayer and intention… It’s out of my hands, really.”
“I’m not takin’ that chance, Cas. You deserve to be happy. You don’t need that threat hanging over your head forever. And I really hope you know by now that we don’t want you around just ‘cause of your grace.”
The man’s eyes seemed to stare off into space for a moment, then he turned to the tent. “Why did you laugh?”
“When you choose life—and love—for yourself, you give others permission and an example to choose life and love for themselves. You have now before you life and death, blessing and curse.
“We don’t have weeks, much less months,” Dean said. He started to ask Jack about his power when a painful twist in his abdomen caused him to wince and curl in on himself.
Jack sighed and nodded, then closed his eyes again. He raised his hand, palm out, and seemed to pet the air in front of him. Slowly, a golden rift formed, light shining brightly from within.
“You’re back! I drew you a picture.” Leaping off the bed like a small child would, Dean held out the paper. “I don’t know where my crayons are but I found a pencil. I couldn’t make the blue on your wings so I just made them lighter.”
“Tell him no. Let him send whatever he wants, throw his tantrum. In fact, maybe we can even use his email to you as leverage against him. Proof of blackmail. I don’t know. We need someone who knows what’s legal and what’s not.” Cas cocked an eyebrow. “Know anyone like that?”
“No, Cas.” Dean frowned, shaking his head. “You don’t get to have it both ways. If you see my soul as—” he made a face, “righteous, despite all the crap that I’ve done, and I don’t get to argue about it, then you get to still be a holy badass, despite what you’ve done. And believe me, I’ve been pretty pissed off at some of the things you’ve done, but that’s not
“We’re not letting you go until you’ve answered some questions,” Dean said, putting every bit of authority he could into his voice.
“Dean, you should eat,” Castiel said, setting the cooler down on the stool next to the small refrigerator and their duffels on one of the beds. “Gabriel, stop antagonizing him.”
Sam sighed and examined his own conflicting feelings. There was so much more to process, so much about Gabriel he wanted to understand. “Yeah, Gabe. I want you to stay.”
“Judging by some of the things Sam has said, I think he figured it out before we did. He’ll be fine. Other hunters, people in some of the places we go? It could be a problem. You know, being public or anything.”
“You will?” Castiel couldn’t help but feel hope curling in his chest, a lightness creeping in through the cracks in the dark. Dean didn’t want him to
“No…” Cas began. “Well… I consider that my choices have led to my weakened grace. So perhaps. Why do you ask?”
“Okay, hang on a minute.” There was a great deal of shuffling on the other end before Sam came back. “If all she has are Cas’ notes, then there’s nothing you’ve signed or that legally ties you to this. She can make all the fuss she wants, but she can’t do anything to you. You can spin it a couple of ways. One, you can say you know nothing about this and Cas made it all up.”
He held his hands in front of him, palms out and fingers splayed but relaxed. “May I?” he asked, glancing at Cas’ face and then at the soft-looking covert feathers.
Sam let out a frustrated sigh and lowered his phone. “There’s a type of trauma therapy that could help Cas in just a few sessions. It’s not talk therapy. Not like what you’re thinking. It uses brain science. I don’t know
“Be careful what you ask for, right?” Moving his bread plate, Dean set the box down next to his plate of chicken and something that looked rubbery and green.
“Yeah, I can do that.” Dean went to the fridge and pulled out a tub of sour cream, noting a few items that they’d need to replenish on their next grocery run. He set to work on the eggs, using the skillet that Sam had already set on the stove.
“I dunno.” Dean lowered the phone and called over to Cas. “Sam wants to meet you. What do you think?”
“And we appreciate it,” Pamela said. “Next to Kevin is Charlie Bradbury. Charlie is the founder and owner of B!tch Books, which publishes fantasies with an LGBTQ focus, and Charlie, you have over one hundred titles published, including your own lesbian techno-fantasy series.”
“Right. Sure.” Dean started the car and pulled out of the space. “Just, don’t get the seat sticky. I’ve cleaned enough dried-on substances off that vinyl, and it’s a bitch to get clean.”
“And what about Jack?” Sam asked. “You said Lucifer doesn’t exist in this universe. What does that mean for Jack?”
“I can do small things. Bigger things either just don’t happen or take a lot more out of me than they usually would.”
“Vets aren’t the only ones who use it, Dean. Cops do too.” He tapped twice on his phone and raised it to his ear. After a few moments of silence, he raised his eyebrows. “Hi Jody. It’s Sam.”
Castiel felt one side of his mouth turn up in a smile. “Your double entendres aside, I don’t know how to answer what happens to you, except that I know you don’t go away or die. You become
“I can teach you,” Hunter Dean said after another swallow. “Been shooting almost since I could read.”
Sam took a sip of his cooling hot cocoa and Castiel followed suit, savoring the cinnamon. He could tell Sam’s anxiety was still present, but there was a thread of excitement in being able to share knowledge he’d gained. Sam would have made a good teacher.
“But maybe this one is right about this thing,” Sam said. “I mean think about it. Dean’s afraid everyone is going to leave him. Cas is afraid of being useless, of failing everyone else. Jack’s afraid of being evil.”
“No, Cas. He wasn’t superior to you in any way. Maybe a higher rank, but I bet he messed with some other angel’s reality to get what he wanted. Guy never was about playing fair. Smug bastard.”
“Wait… This is what you meant? Before? When you were dying?” Dean made a face. “That other time when you were dying?”
“Is he… Is he awake? Is he in pain?” Dean wanted to see for himself but he couldn’t take his eyes of the road. “He told me he couldn’t turn off neural input from his wings.”
Cas didn’t seem to see or hear him, so Dean ignored all thoughts about how dirty the floor was, and moved slowly to sit next to Cas. He refrained from any touching, keeping his hands to himself in case Cas reacted violently, but sat close enough that he could feel the warmth coming from Cas’ body.
A warmth bloomed in Dean’s chest, spreading out into his shoulders. At the same time, the thought of spending six hours every day on social media was daunting. And having enough to say on social media to schedule it? A single post on his Facebook author page each week was a lot as far as Dean was concerned.
Once on the bridge, he realized he’d been barely breathing and took a deep breath, letting it out slowly. “You okay, Cas?”
The smell of coffee brewing filled the kitchen and Dean poured himself a cup. “Thanks, Sam.” He ended the call, nursed his cup of coffee while he thought over what he wanted to say, then called Bela back.
“Of course Sammy needs to sleep. Kid should already be in bed. But Dad said I gotta keep an eye on him.” Dean winked. “Hard to do that when I’m asleep too.”
There was no hint of deception in Cas’ eyes or on his face, which Dean now realized was quite an attractive face. The tightness in his jeans said the rest of his body agreed. Dean had only ever dated women and considered himself somewhat of a ladies’ man. He’d been attracted, he could admit privately, to a guy or two before, and wondered what that might be like, to be with a dude. But he’d never met anyone worth considering seriously. And right now, he had too many responsibilities to even think about adding a relationship. There was something about this guy, though, that intrigued him, beyond the ego strokes.
A relatively small parallelogram, the field was set off by a barbed wire fence with a single break at the front. A few locations were dotted with headstones, flags, decorations, and frozen flowers in the snow, but most areas were bare, save for small mounds of brush. Izzy had done some more research about where and when burials took place at the potter’s field over time, and had a good idea of where Gwendolyn was likely buried.
As Gabriel sat down, Sam turned on the water and adjusted the temperature. “If it’s too cold or too hot, let me know. I’m starting with the temperature I usually use.”
When Dean returned, he brought with him several blankets. “In case he gets cold,” he said by way of explanation. “I know he says the cold doesn’t bother him, but maybe it does if he’s hurt.”
“Yeah, I hear you. I’m Dean, by the way, but it sounds like you knew that.” Dean stuck his hand out in a handshake and the spoon flew from his fingers and clattered at the guy’s feet. “Sorry, man. Could you grab that for me?”
“Ooh, now that was a really good guess. I like that one. Still not correct, but you actually tried that time.”
Gabriel stopped whatever he’d been doing and turned, looking kind of hopeless. His arms hung loosely at his sides. He spoke as Sam approached. “Your brother is being a dick.”
“I have lived a very long life. If I spend the remaining few years human, assisting you and Sam, I am content with that.”
Dean opened his mouth and closed it again, once he realized he had nothing. “Cas and Gabe can keep trying.”
“Not even that much, you poor thing.” She lowered her head coquettishly and looked at Cas from under her lashes. Her voice fell to a near-whisper, and she withdrew a small vial from her cleavage.
control this world.” With a thought, Metatron was now shackled in Naomi’s chair. A small table sat next to it, accommodating a drill and several sharp implements, including the angel blade Metatron had been holding.
your argument?” Cas sounded exasperated. “That’s been happening for years. Both sides have used us against each other. I doubt that will change. What
He sat down at the kitchen table and brought up Sam’s number. “Sammy, I need your help again, man,” he said after his brother answered.
“He is as my own soul,” a young man said to him. “I cannot bear to tell him to leave and yet his life is in danger. My father
“If I had the proper ingredients, I could make us completely invisible, even to demons,” Castiel said. “But we have no way to get them.”
Dean giggled—a small child’s giggle—and reached out to pet the wing again. It seemed to mesmerize him as he traced the feathers with his fingers, and that gave Castiel an idea.
Before finding out, Castiel decided he needed to tour the rest of the house. If there was a master bedroom, as the four-year-old Dean pointed to, then it likely belonged to one of the adult Deans. But there were no other rooms on the upper floor. Not even a bathroom.
Dean nodded again. “I’ll draw my car. I call her Baby. I never thought of her as my wings before. She’s been like home to me.”
“No, I’m sorry, Cas. I shouldn’t have teased you like that. Guess I’m kinda sending mixed signals here, huh?”
“I feel like I should go talk to Dean, but I’m afraid I might make it worse. I tried telling Jack about what I was like when you met me. You know, the whole demon blood thing. And he took it the wrong way, that he’s
“Fine,” Dean grumbled. “Yeah, you’ve done some shitty things. And a lot of them hurt. Mostly they hurt because I didn’t think you cared. At least…” He shrugged. “At least not the way I do.”
my wings. Second, yes, I did, and everything was fine. You can stop worrying. I’ve been around you long enough to know how to purchase coffee and donuts without arousing suspicion.” He offered Dean a cup.
“I noticed. Did you do something to us? Or is it me? Everyone took off separately. Everyone’s angry. Every time I try to help I just seem to make it worse.”
“When we came here…” Jack continued, “the rift… I chose. I chose not to have anything to do with Lucifer. He’s
“Yeah.” He chewed his lip. “I kind of like the idea of you having something the others don’t. So…if you want to see them, I’ll bring them out.”
Dean found the laptop in the library. He figured he’d queue up the movie before he got back in his room, just to have it ready to go, but first he had to exit out of all the browser tabs Sam had open. One caught his attention:
“I can shield him from human view,” Cas offered. “But not from demons. If we had the ingredients for a spell, I could do that, but it would be more dangerous to seek what we’d need than to return to the bunker.”
“Okay. I’ll be gentle. I don’t want to do anything that’s gonna hurt you. If something hurts, let me know and I’ll stop, okay?”
Four-year-old Dean answered his door with a wide grin and a drawing in one hand. “I made the drawing!” he exclaimed before he spotted Tween Dean and excitement gave way to caution. “Who is that?”
Dean nodded slowly. “Yeah, I kind of remember that. One had all the organs and one had the circulatory system, another one had the skeleton.”
Castiel moved comfortably into battle mode, relegating anything nonproductive far into the background. “Where is your vessel?”
“We don’t want to inconvenience you or your family,” Castiel said politely. “We’ll stay in the square.”
“Yeah, and they make up all sorts of interesting facts about angels’ mating habits. You know, like um…creative uses for wing oil.”
“Great,” Dean called back. “Why don’t you three figure out how we’re going to defeat Michael? And for that matter, how we’re gonna get back to that giant ashtray of a universe?” He turned right on a county highway that looked like it would get them closer to the interstate.
. And I thought that,” he pointed to the door, “was the motel office. But it didn’t look like a house.” He eyed Castiel suspiciously. “This more angel mojo?”
“I wouldn’t mind a regular paycheck,” Hunter Dean said, eyeing his beer. “But the bunker’s pretty cool. And I get to play with guns.”
Laughing uneasily, Chuck said, “I guess I asked for that. I should limit myself to one question at a time. You guys can hear me, right?”
“I’m the one who’s gonna teach you everything I know about the best music and the best food,” Tween Dean said as he sauntered in and looked around the bedroom before eyeing four-year-old Dean. “You’re kinda cute for a rugrat,” he added.
“Did you have someone you wanted me to see for this?” Castiel asked, not really liking the idea of walking into another office and subjecting himself to another
“Forged registration papers and an ID card.” Sam answered his unasked question. “We were going to need them anyway, so I printed them up this morning. You’ll need to carry them, Dean, and be with him at all times. There might be checkpoints soon. Your driver’s license, his ID card. He’ll need to have his wings out.”
Dean fished in his pocket and pulled out the souvenir spoon. “Might as well get silver out of the way. Can you take one of those bottles—” He stopped as Castiel pulled a bottle free from the case under the cart, twisted the top off, and stuck his finger inside, infusing the water with a tiny bit of his grace. “That works. Let’s go find out why he’s on our tail.”
Tingles of pleasure raced across Castiel’s skin, followed by a flash of heat and the unmistakable musk of Dean’s scent as Castiel melted into the kiss, the embrace, chasing every point of contact between them until—
“No trick this time, kiddo. Now, you make sure this bucket of bolts gets us off anyone’s radar, and I’ll check in with your boyfriend, see what I can do.”
“Cas, don’t say that. You’ve been useful even when you haven’t had any powers. You’re our friend. You’re family.”
“Exactly. He hurt you.” Husband Dean went to the refrigerator and grabbed two beers in an eerie recreation of Castiel’s earlier visit. He came back and gave one to Hunter Dean, then sat down in the living room. “You wouldn’t be so angry if you didn’t care.”
“Wait,” Cas instructed him. “I’ll get out and retrieve Gabriel. You be ready to drive as soon as I get him in the car.”
Sam exhaled sharply. “I get it. I don’t have any other ideas. And I can’t honestly think straight right now. This thing with Mom…” Sam nodded a few times and visibly swallowed. “I guess I’m not really in a great place either.”
Castiel met Dean’s eyes with a glare, irritated that his tone had been parental, as if Castiel was a child. “I am not—”
Dean felt at a loss. The kid could be anywhere. Or really, given his power, any when. “If you guys can’t find him, what does that mean?” he asked. “Is he still on the planet? In this universe?”
“For me too, Dean. I’ve been thinking a lot during the drive. Remembering things. Nothing bad for us; I still want us to work out. But I have unfinished business I may need to take care of soon. I’ll be there in less than an hour. I’ll tell you everything.”
“I grew up—and still live—in eastern Kansas. Bible belt. I don’t know what I am, but gay’s not an option.” Dean sighed, still staring at the ceiling. “I know, it’s not a very glamorous place to live. My brother Sam and his wife are attorneys in Kansas City. They have a three-year-old. Gabriel.”
“But apparently not in this universe,” Sam said. “He’s energy. What kind of sight is he talking about, Gabriel?”
“What am I thinkin’, Sammy?” Dean said, his voice a little more nasal, pitched somewhat higher. He strode out of his room and into the hallway. “I should’ve fixed something right away.”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean said, coming up to stand next to him and pulling his parka closer around himself. “How can you be out here without a winter coat, man? It’s friggin’ cold out.”
the way I intended it, Deano. Don’t worry.” He patted Dean on the cheek with his hands. “I’ll only touch your bro where he needs it.” Snickering again, he added, “Whoops! Did it again.”
“I don’t know, Sam. Maybe he’s trying to jerk me around. Get me to turn Cas over. What do I do? With Bela, I mean.”
“And why would we want to free any of them?” Dean demanded. “You’re on their most wanted list. They think Gabe is dead. And they’re all dicks. We’ve already established that.”
Barely glancing at the signs for which carousel his luggage would be at, Dean scanned the crowds and spotted his brother quickly, a full head taller than nearly anyone else. It helped, also, that Gabe was riding on his father’s shoulders, apparently trying to touch a nearby monitor, perhaps thinking it was a touchscreen. He strode forward, eager to embrace both of them.
“Eh.” Gabriel stood and wheeled the table away. “Perks of being an archangel. I wasn’t certain it would work until you tried it in the bakery. You didn’t get very much that time. Maybe if you’d eaten the entire slice then, you wouldn’t have drained yourself dry with that reckless rescue plan.”
Dean closed the door and blushed bright red. “Probably the best sex in my entire life. I think I…uh…blacked out. When I woke up, I was standing here, dressed, and you were nowhere to be found.”
Castiel looked at him, disbelieving what he’d just heard. How could someone so brilliant in so many other ways not understand how wings worked? “You’ve seen them,” he said. “You really think I can just push them through ‘wing holes’?”
“Well, I guess it still involves sacrifice and conviction.” Dean handed him two more clean plates and started on the pan. “You, uh, want to be with that person all the time. Qualities in that other person that other people think are annoying are endearing to you. You can’t help but forgive them for stupid shit they do.” Dean shrugged. “Why, you meet some hot chick?”
“No,” Castiel sighed. “It’s too late for that now. Even if they did…” He shook his head. “Our original mission was to love humanity. Yet your government embraces demons and despises us. We have to stay. We’re the ones who are going to have to pick up the pieces when this is all over.”
Managing a swallow, Dean took a shaky breath and tried to reorient himself. “I’m…I’m okay. I think.” He stood slowly, Cas’ hand moving to his forearm just in case.
No, the best hunters were those with no ties and nothing to lose. It made for a lonely existence, but that was the price of being a hunter. He was sure even Jesse and Cesar would agree with that; why else would they leave hunting and become horse whisperers or whatever they were going to do.
While Gabriel’s fingers were still on his forehead, Sam felt a sudden urge to yawn, an impulse that took all his focus to fight, knowing how much pain it would cause in his lung and ribs.
Cas managed to disengage himself from her hand and suggested, “Let’s finish going around the table first.”
“We didn’t ask you here about Gabriel,” Sam said. “We’re worried about Jack. He was with us earlier. He’s…um…a nephilim. Lucifer’s son. But he’s not evil. He’s our friend and we care about him. He’s not answering our prayers and Cas and Gabriel say they can’t sense him. I’m hoping you can.”
“Definitely not,” Dean added, taking Cas by the elbow. “And while Sammy makes his call, you and I need to have a different conversation.”
“Coming!” The voice was definitely that of Tween Dean, and Castiel felt more hopeful and confident than he had since this started.
Castiel shook his head, unable to figure it out. No human should be able to see his wings. No human could see into the etheric plane. Except… He’d heard stories about young children still being able to see into both the etheric and astral planes before they learned to only focus on the physical plane. Such children also were able to see spirits, even remember a previous life if they had waived their right to remain in their personal heaven and decided to incarnate again as another human.
The walk to London—or more accurately, the walk to a restaurant called Brit’s Pub—was indeed short, and the weather was beautiful for an upper Midwest evening. Low humidity, few mosquitoes, mostly clear skies with wisps of clouds soon to be painted pink and purple by the setting sun. They found a table on the outdoor deck and browsed the menu.
Castiel watched as Dean shoveled cereal into his mouth and then motioned Sam toward the war room. “Only that our working theory is likely correct. These fractures are along lines of trauma. Each part of Dean has taken on some overwhelming fear or pain that the others are unaware of. The youngest child is the only one who seems to have no trauma. And this Dean only knows himself as Dean.”
His own pain and blood had come back to him in that moment, a night long ago in the crypt, and the words he’d been thinking but too chicken to say. “I need you,” was all he’d managed, and it had been enough at the time, but damnit, Cas had just proven that he had more courage in his little finger—that same finger sharing its warmth with Dean’s—than Dean probably had in his whole body.
The both sat on either side of Dean, Charlie on the right, far too close for his comfort. “Uh…I’m Dean,” he said, half-raising his hand.
Dean stood up. “Okay, we’re done. I wish you and Gabe a happy whatever-the-hell-you’re-doing, but I’m done talking about this.”
Dean took the documents and looked them over again. “I would like to have my attorney review this.” He flashed her a grin. “I remember being encouraged to do that when I was offered my last contract. The one you’re changing. Due diligence and all that.”
Without thinking too much about what he might be doing, Sam pressed harder, continuing the scrubbing motions with his fingertips, feeling the wing start to tremble beneath his hands. The feathers all fluffed up, making the wing feel twice as dense and three times as soft, and then with a shout from Gabriel, all the lights went out.
comfort. And instead of focusing on what he needs, you’re setting boundaries, so he doesn’t cross some invisible line that—let’s be honest, Dean—you haven’t cared about with him in a long time.”
I thought I’d take a few moments to explain how this fic came to be. Initially, as a professional author, I loved the idea that Dean wrote urban fantasy based on the basic
Breathing into the part-pain, part-relief, Dean closed his eyes and allowed his body to loosen. “Hey, uh… You said, back at breakfast, there were things about you I didn’t know.”
“In what world,” Cas said, coming back while securing the top of the container, “is colored gelatin considered a salad ingredient?”
Blue eyes searched his own for a moment, reflecting the light from the overhead lamp. “No, Dean. I’m telling you that reading your book changed my life.”
“I’m not an—” Sam stopped and shook his head. “Yeah. I’ve heard you for years. Helped whenever I could.”
“What’s this?” Gabe said from the footwell. He sat up again, holding Cas’ duffel in his hands. After maneuvering the zipper open, he pulled something out and tossed it on the front seat. “You wanted symbolism, have your boyfriend explain this.”
If they were now having to parade around naked by showing their wings, maybe that wasn’t such a bad thing. Bring ‘em down a peg or two. But when that included Cas, then no. Cas had already been dropped too far, human and homeless, and that wasn’t even the government’s fault. No, Dean could blame that all on himself and his failure to figure out how to keep Cas safe when Gadreel was threatening Sam’s life. He refused to fail Cas again.
Dean was silent for a long time. “I’m not really in the bunker right now, am I? I mean this,” he waved his hand around the room, “isn’t really the bunker. It’s all in my head, isn’t it? That’s what the house is about. Your
Pounding on the door and yelling alerted them to a disturbance at the front of the house. “Please excuse me,” Lot said, rising from the table and going to the door.
“Not much. He was pretty out of it. I said same rules as last time. Stay on your own side, yadda, yadda. Last thing I need is to wake up with him trying to spoon me.”
The guy watched him for a second too long, then crouched down and retrieved the spoon, handing it back with no ill effects. “You don’t seem like the spoon-collecting type.”
Jack’s voice sounded so despondent, Sam couldn’t help but reach out a hand to his shoulder. “We know you are, Jack.”
A wince crossed Cas’ face briefly, subtle enough that most people might have missed it, but Dean could tell. He could always tell when Cas was in pain.
“Yeah, Sam was telling me about that earlier.” Dean repeated what Sam had said, including his thought about being a silent author.
. It’s bad enough they do so over anything and everything. You are to deliver your assigned message and leave. Do you understand?”
Castiel peered at Sam, tilting his head as he tried to see what lay under Sam’s anxiety. “Something changed,” he concluded.
“Aww, someone a little jealous? Is Dean not treating you right? Do I need to give him the big brother talk?”
way of seeing the world. I’m just a hick from the Kansas countryside, and an introvert to boot. I don’t see that social media strategy working for me.”
His fingers scrubbed, almost kneading with a mind of their own, finding particles of dirt and loose feathers, removing the sticky residue and revealing the golden shine beneath. It was becoming more and more clear that he was tired and needed sleep soon, but it was also pleasant, doing this for Gabriel.
“Yeah, and it’s got you pretty screwed up. I don’t want to make it worse. But we’ve gotta find Jack and somehow take him out of the equation so he doesn’t hurt anyone else, and we can’t do that if you keep reliving
“I already accept him,” Castiel said. He hesitated to add the next part, but needed them to know. “I’m also growing weaker. It’s taken a lot of my grace to dream walk with you and I’m running low. In case I can’t stay, I know you can do this. You are the Dean I know and love.”
“I don’t want to leave. I want to stay with you, as long as you’ll have me. And since we’re being honest with each other…” Cas dropped his hand and closed his eyes briefly, as if gathering courage. “When Chuck first did…whatever he did to me…I thought about the Empty. How it would be a relief. But you… Dean. You’re worth coming back to.”
“And what has that ever gotten anyone?” Dean snarled. “You know what love is? It’s pain. It rips your heart out and eats it in front of you. Give in to the pain, Sammy,” Dean said, walking slowly around the table toward him. “It’s all there is. It’s all there ever will be.”
Something ragged felt like it tore through Dean’s chest and throat, and he closed his eyes and clenched his jaw, trying to keep control of his muscles.
Search results showed that some people absolutely believed, and others considered the idea religious garbage. A familiar name caught his eye and he clicked on it, his eyes widening at the sheer number and types of results about Cas. And Cas was mentioned a lot with respect to Dean. Sam followed links to groups on Facebook, hashtags on Twitter, even a foray into Tumblr, where he had to alternate between wanting to bleach his eyes and laughing hysterically.
of the breakers tripping—twice—only meant some sort of power overload. Tracking that down and fixing it seemed overwhelming, though not nearly as bad as taking on the US government. Again.
“No, there’s a page on Instagram for the brewery.” Sam shook his head at Dean’s blank look. “He’s on social media and he posted something earlier today. So, no, I don’t think we switched places with them. And look,” Sam held his phone out for a moment so everyone could see. “The guy who plays Cas has sent…” he started counting. “…four, five, six, seven tweets insulting the president, just in the past hour.”
Dean’s voice called out before the door even unlatched. “Did you forget your—” he swung the door open, “key again?”
He stood, stretched his arms above his head, popped his back in a few different places, then grabbed his dead guy robe and headed out to find Cas and see who else was up.
“Now that’s what I’m talking about,” Dean said, sounding very pleased with himself. He worked through some more tightness, combing through the feathers as he went. “Hey, Cas, this fluffing is a good thing, right? I mean, it’s not ‘cause you’re cold or anything?”
“Think, Castiel,” Michael said, not unkindly. “You know this. I exist outside of space and time. Physical weapons—including fire, no matter what kind of oil fuels it—cannot harm me.” He came close to Cas, who continued to stand his ground, then held his hand out, palm up. “Take my hand, Castiel. You may keep your sword if you wish.”
Dean heard Sam snort as he held back laughter, but when he turned to glare at his brother, Sam had an innocent look on his face.
“What do you want it to be?” Gabriel asked softly. “Because I can never speak of it again if that’s what you want.”
After packing the wounds with sterile gauze and then wrapping them as tightly as he dared with ace bandages woven through the flight feathers, Dean took a deep breath and tried to release some of the tension in his body. He even thought about shaking his hands out the way Cas had shown him, but he wanted to wait until Cas actually woke up before he considered relaxing.
Still, the sounds Cas was making went straight to his groin, and Dean wondered if he could help himself out a little while Cas was dreaming. Because, God, those sounds, especially if he knew
Cas squatted down and ran his hand gently over one of the taller weeds, maybe eight inches high, with wide green leaves and red veins and stem. He cocked his head toward the tree. “That’s a female cottonwood. This is a cottonwood seedling.”
“Still offering, Cas.” Dean took a large bite, chewed, and swallowed, then added some home fries to his plate. “So, we gotta talk. You first or me?”
He yawned and ran his fingers through his hair, checked that his t-shirt and sleep pants didn’t look too disgusting, and made his way to the war room and the front door. Neither Cas nor Dean were around. Probably in Dean’s room, and hopefully Dean was still sleeping.
“Hiya, gorgeous,” he greeted the next woman in line. “Are you the lucky person I get to sign this for?”
Dean managed a nod and forced himself to relax, reminded himself that Cas would take care of him, had always taken care of him. When Dean allowed it.
“Frequently, Dean prays to me by telling me to get my feathery ass to where he is.” Cas gave Dean an exasperated look but now Dean could see the fondness in it too. “There are no feathers on my ass.”
“In case you hadn’t noticed, lover boy, my hands are literally tied.” He held up said hands, his wrists encircled with thick handcuffs marked in Enochian. “So are my wings, which hurt like hell, and I mean that literally. So thank you for the rescue and I’m sorry things didn’t work out.”
Tapping Baby’s roof a couple times with his hand, Dean nodded to himself and then climbed in. He checked Cas over; other than the dried blood from his eye, he seemed uninjured. But clearly
“I’m—” Castiel sighed and stood, moving back to the window and staring out at the parking lot for a few moments before turning around and facing Dean. “With your mother back, you have the family you’ve always wanted. The family you deserve. I know we are friends, Dean, but I don’t know that I fit in there.”
“I’m not saying I made great choices, Dean. I’m saying that I think I’m attracted to the person, not to their body. What they look like, what parts they have, isn’t a deterrent to me. I mean, I do kind of like them on the smaller size. But they don’t have to be female. You know what I mean?”
“Right. Well, the fastest way to Dean’s heart is always through his stomach.” Sam pulled a box out of the freezer, emptied some frozen contents onto a plate, and put it in the microwave oven. “Maybe Hot Pockets will yield us something.”
He dozed off, not sure if he actually heard Cas mumble, “Dean…” or if it was his mind playing tricks on him. His hand stayed on Cas all night.
Dean stared at him for a few moments. When did his brother get so bossy? “Fine. Lemme grab a beer first.” He took his time going to the kitchen, browsing all four of the bottles in the fridge, making a note to do another beer run soon. After popping the cap, he took a few swallows before going back to Sam and sitting down across from him at the map table.
“Good. That’s good.” Dean let out a long breath. “You had me worried this time. Gabe doing what he’s supposed to and nothing else?”
Shaking his head, Sam said, “Doesn’t matter. You can’t publish any book unless they’ve seen it first.”
Dean returned to the driver’s door, but watched as the uniformed man returned to Castiel, looking him up and down. He reached out, lifting one of Castiel’s long feathers with his hand, then clenching it in his fist and pulling upwards slowly until the feather snapped at the base. Castiel cried out but remained standing, head down, hands at his sides. The uniformed man nodded at the guardsman, then returned to his post as Dean climbed in the driver’s seat, gripping the steering wheel hard enough to hurt.
Dean waited as nonchalantly as possible, hoping the officer didn’t realize the visible area of the trunk was only half its normal size. After a few moments, the officer pushed the trunk lid closed and motioned for Dean to get back in.
Cas rubbed his hand over his mouth thoughtfully. “Except a healer could be human. They’re hunting something inhuman.”
, so that others would live and have the chance at happiness he never had. I see compassion and selflessness and so much love, Dean.
“How’s he doing, Gabe?” Dean asked, not able to see much in the mirror. Cas appeared to be unconscious.
“Good morning to you too,” Dean greeted sarcastically, suddenly feeling grumpy. “What’s the emergency?”
“What other symbolism have I missed?” Dean looked over to the passenger side. “Cas? You do the whole symbolism thing too?”
Dean felt an instant panic flare up and tried to push it down with every swear word he could think of. Why couldn’t Sam have made up papers registering Castiel as human? Why couldn’t they just pass Castiel off as Jimmy?
Castiel shook out the dress shirt, lining up the sleeves and laying it with his other clothing. “Creating an opening between planes is very different from bringing my wings corporeally into this plane. Manifesting them here while dressed would both ruin the clothing and be extremely uncomfortable.”
“Well, one of them is going to need to grow a pair and use their big boy words. There’s more tooth-rotting sugar between them than in all the candy I could possibly conjure up. Anyhoo. You ready for another round?” Gabriel came over to the bed.
Sam thought back. The demon blood. Dean insisting he stop using his powers. Killing Lilith. Saying yes to Lucifer. Being soulless. “I can’t be trusted with power,” he said just above a whisper. “It’s when I have power that I make things worse.”
At that moment, someone stealthily took the chair on the far right. Dean glanced over to see the guy from the bar. Cas. And he hadn’t bothered to change into more professional attire. Dean gave him a puzzled look and Cas raised an eyebrow in return.
Demon Dean narrowed his eyes and glared at Lover Dean. “You’re such a slut. You gonna take it up the ass for him too? Love is a joke. It means nothing.”
“If Michael’s right,” Sam said, “that’s exactly why you can’t stay. You’d be trapping yourself because you’re not facing what’s in your way.”
“Okay. And then in between EMDR sessions, things can come up then too. You don’t need to make them go away or cease to exist, but you don’t want to make them bigger either. You want to just sort of transfer the energy into some other activity. Maybe take a shower or go for a run or write in a journal.”
When Tween Dean returned to his room, he looked a little shaken. Castiel wasn’t sure at first if he could enter Dean’s room without Dean, but the door opened easily to his touch. It seemed safer to wait in there than risk being seen by any of the other Deans, should they venture out of their rooms.
Before Dean could make a decision about who was going to take what position, Cas pulled him close and manhandled him into the little spoon. This time, Dean figured, it was okay. Cas would take care of him.
Dean ran up and grabbed Castiel’s hand, then started tugging him toward a set of stairs. “Come see my room!”
“How the hell could they hit his wings when they were in the etheric plane anyway? Wouldn’t they be vibrating too fast to be affected by bullets on the physical plane? Or something?”
“We had sex,” Lover Dean said. “Really amazing, awesome sex. And apparently when he orgasmed here, he came in his vessel too.”
angel was not like the others, and certainly not an animal, but he found himself frozen in place, shocked at what he was seeing.
“I’m here.” The angel’s voice came from the back of the office building, as if he’d been leaning against the wall, watching them all this time.
“I know. And I’ll regret it forever that I didn’t…” Sam ran his fingers through his hair. “Anyway. If I do find someone, it’s gotta be someone who gets it. And…someone who’s less likely to die. Or can come back.”
Dean’s eyebrows rose in a way Castiel had never seen before, conveying innocent hope and curiosity. “Can… Can I touch them?”
“Yeah,” Sam huffed out a short laugh. “Me too. I don’t have any, but I need to pick up a few things, so…” He glanced at Cas. “How about Cas stays here with you and I’ll do a quick grocery run. Get a few boxes.”
me. It’s just who I am.” Jack sniffed and wiped his nose on his jacket. “You should go. Before I hurt you too.”
“Yeah. Thanks, Sammy. I’ve got to run. Got a panel coming up about paths to publication and from the lineup, I’m pretty sure I’m the only author signed with one of the Big Five.”
“All right, let’s blow this popsicle stand!” Gabriel went to the rear door and opened it. “I call the whole back seat.”
“Oh, I supposed you’re gonna say next that I’m one of the versions. Not really Dean.” He stared at Castiel for a moment before throwing his hands up in the air. “Really? You’re gonna go there, Cas? How about I prove to you how real I am?”
“I’m gonna pack up,” Dean informed them as he hefted the cooler. “We can stop by the gas station and refuel Baby and the snack stash.”
“Twice more, I think, and we’ll be done,” Gabriel said. “Keep your questions for next time. I will tell you this: I’ve played with space and time, illusions and metaphors—you’ll learn about the whole angel symbolism thing soon enough—and I’ve accumulated far more tricks than treats. But I have never once broken a promise. Never in my entire existence. And I promise you—and only you—that if you ask for an honest answer, I will give you an honest answer. So… Try and sleep some more, huh? You need it.” He got up and started for the door.
Duffel packed and zipped, he emptied a large canister of salt on the jumble of bones, tossed the cardboard container in the hole, and began pouring gasoline around, trying not to get it on himself. He’d just emptied the plastic can and was fishing in his jacket pocket for a matchbook when he felt a sudden blast of cold. There were barely any trees in the area, but the tall grasses nearby didn’t seem to be moving as he looked around for signs of wind.
He was headed back toward the motel when he spotted Gabriel stalking away from the vicinity of their room, looking like he was ranting at the sky. Gabriel was still an enigma, and Sam wasn’t sure what to think of him. He did help, years ago. And Sam’s heart went out to him for all he’d endured under Asmodeus’ captivity. But still, he’d been ready to turn tail and run again. And Sam really wanted to know what Gabriel saw when Jack encouraged him to use some other sight to recognize Michael. Some other way of seeing? Using his true form’s eyes?
“Oh. Oh!” Sam grinned. “Yeah, so like where unicorns and fairies live. You can’t see them unless they want you to.”
“Okay, anything but this,” Dean said, running a hand over his definitely-blushing face. “Change the subject. Please?”
Dean laughed at the look Cas gave him—something between shock and disgust. “I’m just gonna ask Farmer Guy a few questions and we’ll head back to the motel.” He stood with the others, left a generous tip along with payment for their bill, and nonchalantly made his way toward the entrance, near where Farmer Guy was seated.
A beer was not going to cut it this time. Dean grabbed the closest bottle of whiskey, discarded the idea of a glass after a half-second of deliberation, and closed himself in his room. Headphones, Black Sabbath streaming loud and almost indecipherable on his laptop, and Dean could pretend that there weren’t thoughts and emotions and memories clawing their way to the surface.
At the end of the panel, attendees formed lines to talk to the panelists. Dean noticed that Cas’ line was more men than women, while his own was the opposite. Charlie’s line was almost entirely women, only a handful of people—mostly men—came up to talk to Tessa but didn’t seem as interested in her book as they were in her, and Frank was loudly and forcefully debating conspiracy theories with a fan.
“It’s okay,” Sam reassured him. “You’re okay, Dean. We’re in the bunker. Cas is here. Rowena’s gone.”
Cas didn’t say anything, but there was a hungry look in his eyes and a smile playing around his mouth. He poured some more oil into his hands and rubbed up Dean’s inner thighs from his knees to his groin, thumbs pressing deeply into the flesh. He did this a few times, then on the last upper pass, he moved his hands slightly and his fingers rubbed over Dean’s scrotum and then his cock. Cas focused there then, rubbing and pulling at his dick as if it was just another extremity to massage, using one hand to hold Dean’s sack down and stretching his dick with the other. Oiled fingers massaged all around his balls, never too hard, rubbing places Dean didn’t even realize existed. Cas wrapped his hand around Dean’s shaft and began massaging the underside just below the head, his thumb occasionally sweeping up over the top in a searing burst of pleasure. His other hand moved lower and massaged Dean’s perineum, until Dean felt opposing sensations: the further hardening of his cock and the loosening of everything else down there.
“I just feel like every time I say something, I’m making it worse.” Sam shook his head. “I’m sorry, Cas. I shouldn’t be dumping this on you. You just got out of what happened. What
Castiel hummed thoughtfully. “Don’t you both act now? You portray law enforcement and other authority figures on a regular basis.”
“You wouldn’t know mine,” Tessa said. “My first book is coming out in a month. In fact, I think we’re represented by the same agency.”
That thought soured his stomach even more, and he reconsidered the motel, if only to delay the inevitable. Carefully, he pulled his phone out of his jacket pocket and texted one-handed to his brother.
“Not every man has sensitive nipples,” Cas said, rubbing at Dean’s pecs with all but his index fingers, then using those index fingers to drag his fingernails over the nubs, causing Dean’s entire body to spasm in response. “But you’re so responsive.” Another drag of nails, quicker this time, almost a flick, had Dean shuddering and breathing fast. “I have half a mind to handcuff you and see if I can get you to come from nipple play alone.”
“Good.” Dean breathed out a sigh of obvious relief as he returned to his chair. “You had me scared, man.”
Dean took another long swallow and set the beer down on the table. “Okay. Lead on. Let’s go meet past-me.”
“Yeah. Sam can teach research. I can teach fighting skills. You can teach ‘em anything they ever need to know about angels, demons, Heaven, Hell, Purgatory, even the Empty.” Even thinking about it made Dean feel lighter, more excited than he’d been in a long time, rather than facing down an endless stream of evil until his own untimely death.
Dean watched as Cas slowly raised his eyes, the look on the angel’s face one of puzzlement. “You want to massage my wings to make me happier?” he asked, sounding like Dean had made the stupidest offer of all time.
“How do you know when the moon rises?” Dean stared at Gabe in the rearview mirror. “Never mind,” he added, shaking his head. “I’m gonna stop asking how any of you know anything. So are we ready? I still need to stop for gas and food.”
Cas stepped even closer, Dean’s arm now sandwiched between their bodies. Dean tried not to think about where his hand hung, tried not to think about what his fingers might brush if he moved them.
Dean pointed to a three-way intersection right on the state line. “It’s about ten miles from the nearest town. And Gabe’s going to mute Baby while we drive. Speaking of, how
That time it was familiar. Sam opened his eyes to see a pair of golden irises only inches from his own.
Sam gave a short laugh. “Yeah, Dean, they do. When the frost line melts, the water displaces all the built-up geosmin, which is what gives it that earthy smell.”
Castiel aimed, took in a long breath and let it out slowly, feeling his heartbeat, and at the end of the exhale, he fired.
As Dean flipped through the proposed contract changes, two things became clear: instead of the two books per year he was expected to submit, he would now have to produce three. And his royalty percentage was being cut nearly in half. He tossed them back on the table. “No. That isn’t gonna happen.”
Dean handed him a cup, and Castiel sipped it, only to make a face as the bitter brew hit his tongue. “This doesn’t taste right.”
“Mm,” Castiel shook his head as much as he was able to against the mattress. “They’re not my true form.”
the only way he can help? All Michael. Must be part of his DNA or something. But I call BS. He can do pretty much anything he wants to do. He just wants to dick around with us while I’m recovering and can’t call him on it.”
“Yeah, you know. You go outside, sniff the air, and come back in. You sniffing out new hunts on the breeze or something?”
raced through Dean’s body at the pressure against his erection. He groaned into Cas’ mouth, his hands grabbing and clenching, pulling Cas closer.
“I will try.” Cas stood and stretched his back and wings, careful not to knock anything over. He closed his eyes, concentrating, then winced and opened them again. “The higher vibrations are irritating the wounds. I’ll try again later. I should still see Sam. Apologize to him. And where is Gabriel?”
“I don’t know anything about a bunker,” Husband Dean said. “Cas and I met when his car broke down not far from Bobby’s shop, where I work. We started dating and got married, like, a year ago.”
Rolling his eyes, Sam shook his head. “Dean, you’re a bestselling fantasy author. Of course I’m going to check out the competition. I even read his third book,
“No. There were a couple of panels this morning, but nothing I need to be at. Most people I know are heading out for the airport around lunchtime.”
Dean removed the last of the gauze and tossed it in the wastebasket. Then he started rolling up the ACE bandages. “How is it? Your wing? And, uh… your grace?”
“You mean everything to me,” Dean said, showering Cas in kisses. “Gonna take good care of you, make you feel so good.”
“Okay.” Chuck’s face seemed to be equal parts admiration and concern. He turned back to the podium. “You all won’t be able to see it from where you are,” he said into the mic, “but I’m giving Dean a bronze pendant, modeled after an ancient Zoroastrian god who was a protector of the righteous.” He took the top off the box and showed it to Dean, then returned to the mic. “This is to remind him that the greatest battle of all is within ourselves, to choose good or evil, love or hate, life or death. Congratulations, Dean.”
“What’re we supposed to do, tap our heels three times and say, ‘There’s no place like home’?” Dean said. “I don’t think what I believe is gonna help.”
Closing his eyes, Gabriel sighed. “Once you knew, I was sure that would be the end of it. I was being selfish. I just wanted to experience it once more before it was gone for good.”
“You’re gonna be the death of me, you know that?” Dean picked up the pace but seemed to be having trouble figuring out where to hold himself up with his arms, staying clear of Castiel’s wings.
“It’s different,” Cas said, moving his limbs as Dean let go of his hand. “It means more, coming from you.”
Gabriel managed to shift Castiel over to the far side of the seat, then closed the rear door completely. “You tell me, bucko. It was your plan.”
“I’m not saying you’re afraid of her,” Sam said. “It’s more like these memories, these flashbacks, they come with the fear you felt at the time embedded within them. That fear you felt right before she reset you. I guess it’s not fear of her, exactly, but fear of the process. What she did to you.”
He wanted to close his eyes, pretend this wasn’t happening, pretend Dean couldn’t see how out of control he’d become, pretend he wasn’t disappointing Dean with his weakness, or worse, frightening him. But not knowing had its own form of anxiety, and it was always better to face fear head-on.
“Dean,” Michael said. “Can we talk without this…” he waved at the flames around him, “distraction?” He waited a beat and then walked through the flames.
“No. I’m going to. Because this isn’t the world according to Dean Winchester. You only see what you want to see, and you fight everyone who doesn’t share your view.”
“What Michael said, that first time we met him. He said the only thing standing between us and what we want is what we believe.”
“Yeah,” Dean said, no longer trying to keep the smile on his face. “I’ll take this, bacon, eggs scrambled, hash browns.” He pointed to a photo of so much breakfast food, it required two plates. “Cas, you want—?”
Castiel nodded. “I suppose when you put it that way, then yes. You and I would be brothers in that sense as well, along with every swarming thing in the waters and every crawling thing upon land.”
“What is your body telling you about that experience?” Cas asked. “Not your thoughts or your judgments. Just your physical feelings.”
. Choose life. Choose love. And live.” In the next moment, Michael was gone. No wing flaps, no breeze.
“Awesome,” Dean said. “But I’m starving. You want to share it during or after waffles?” He looked around the kitchen again. “Babe? Where’d you put the waffle iron?” He suddenly perked up when he looked at the metal shelving rack just beyond where Mary was sitting. “Never mind!”
“I…uh…” Dean took another step back. “She liked the way they looked. She made sure they were watered. Sometimes she put some powder or something in the water to make them last longer.” He stepped back again as Cas slowly advanced.
“Yeah, Kelly said you’d probably want to do that, so I’ve already made arrangements. I’ll leave you the house key. What else can I do?”
The feathers were even softer than they looked, and Dean knew that if he didn’t have so many callouses on his hands, they’d feel even silkier. At first he lightly ran his fingertips down along the feathers, noticing that Cas wasn’t flinching, though he was breathing more heavily. Dean took a chance and pressed in more deeply, feeling warm skin and muscle beneath the velvety feathers as he massaged his way down the wings.
He helped Dean carry the dishes to the small sink behind the table, then watched Dean fill the sink with hot, soapy water.
Sam had chosen an upholstered chair to the side, no doubt because of his remaining injuries, and Gabriel had hopped onto one of the tables. Castiel quickly figured out why: all the chairs had armrests, making it difficult to accommodate wings. He opted to stand next to the chair Dean claimed.
“No matter which route they take, I’m certain they will need to cross under this bridge here,” Castiel said, indicating a point on the detailed paper map of downtown St. Paul and the surrounding area that they had spread out over the bed.
Dean shrugged. “I dunno. I think maybe because my mom says angels watch over me and Cas says he watches over me and he says he loves me so maybe because he’s my angel I can see his wings.”
By the time Dean lost count of how many times Cas climbed the stairs to the bunker’s front door, stepped outside just long enough to sniff the air, then returned wordlessly, Dean wanted an explanation.
Castiel wasn’t sure where the words came from, or even who said them, but he felt something shift in the energy around them.
“Uh, no.” He took the pills she offered and went to take them with a glass of water from the bathroom. When he returned, she was eyeing him suspiciously.
How to even begin unpacking that one. Not to mention that unpacking it seemed like a really bad idea. It was bad enough that every evil thing out there knew he and Sam were close, and frequently used one against the other. Already, Cas’ loyalty to them had resulted in him being
The nightmare started the way it frequently did: searing heat and pain and an inability to move beyond seeing what was coming at him and screaming. Razor-sharp talons reached for him again, intent on slicing raw skin that had been torn and healed countless times over before the attack turned far more intimate. He braced himself for the pain, knowing even as he did that there was no preparing, no way to get out of feeling every gut-roiling sensation. But moments before the talons made contact, they dissolved, while silky, translucent hands tenderly caressed his skin, healing all his wounds. He looked around for the owner of the hands, but they were simply hands, almost shyly touching him as they released his bonds.
“No, hey, I’m not going right back to the movie after that. It seemed like it was kind of a, you know,
“Hey, it’s Barb… Yeah, sorry it’s so early. Is Kaye there? I’ve got a medical question.” She ran a hand through her hair. “No, the kids are fine. Yeah, I’ll wait.” Turning to Sam, she said, “Let me see your back again.”
“No, Dean. Michael didn’t do anything wrong. I… I don’t think I can talk about it yet, but he did not hurt me. Please trust me on this.”
After he’d covered the back of the right wing, he carefully lay the wing back down so it was supported by the bed. Then he wheeled the chair over to the other side and went to work on the left wing.
“Cas did,” Dean said. “I was too chickenshit to ask. And I thought he was out of my league.” Dean looked over at Castiel and winked. “Still wonder what I did to deserve you.”
“It’s about the struggle to accept and love ourselves,” Chuck continued, “even in the midst of failure and pain. So I want to present this token of my appreciation and recognition to the author of this remarkable series. Dean Winchester, would you come up please?”
“Open your trunk, please,” the police officer said, hand on his weapon as he stepped aside for Dean to unlock the trunk.
Castiel wasn’t entirely certain why Dean felt such frustration over a law that he had no control over and didn’t directly affect him. Gabriel still needed their help, and for now it seemed the only practical course of action was to accept their current reality. “There are very few times in human history where one group of people has not been oppressed or persecuted by others, based on meaningless categories such as skin color, religion, sexuality, or national origin.”
“The night I met you,” Dean said, his voice sounding oddly choked with some emotion, “you said something that really stuck with me. You said, ‘You don't think you deserve to be saved?’ And I didn’t. Hell, sometimes I still don’t. But I believe with every cell in my body that you do, okay, Cas? No matter what you’ve done, no matter how many times you disobeyed.”
anecdote about publishing a bestselling book with a ninety-nine dollar investment or some such crap, and Dean was certain the resulting book was inferior in every way.
“Yeah, it’s all me. And no, I don’t want him to leave.” He sighed. They hadn’t talked about this much before, about the new laws, about how their part in saving the world from the latest apocalypse had somehow been twisted around and turned into national policy. It had always gone unspoken.
“There’s a small hole here that doesn’t belong.” Castiel pointed to the tiny hole as Dean came over to look at it.
“Dean, it’s okay,” Sam said, raising his hands in front of him to demonstrate that he meant no harm.
Weakly, Castiel sucked in some water, the cool liquid easing his throat. The more he swallowed, the thirstier he felt, until he’d drunk the entire cupful. “Thank you.”
The hands paused in midair and a disembodied voice whispered, “Shhh… You’re safe.” Then the hands faded away, leaving Sam alone in a dark room.
“We’re all made for certain purposes; those are our strengths. Singing is…not one of mine. I sang for a baby once. I don’t think the baby liked it either.”
“You can see his feathers too?” Dean sat up and looked at Crowley with wonder. “And what’s wrong with your face?”
do? I’m a hunter; you’re a warrior. We kill things. And if we’re really, really lucky, maybe we save a few lives.”
“Nope!” Gabriel hopped off the table. “Play is the ante for this game. You all are drowning in so much trauma, this is one thing I can do for you. We’re gonna save the world. And we’re gonna have fun doing it. Who’s in?”
“Yes. He is. Sam would give his life for you. How about if he sits at the table there?” Castiel motioned to the small table to the side of the bed.
“Oh?” There was a lot of bouncing on Cas’ end, like he was folding his legs under him. “How did that go?”
“Yeah. Uh…whatever, um…whatever you decide to do about it, if anything…or nothing…you know, I’ll, um…I’ll support it.”
“It’s okay, Dean,” Cas reassured him. “There is no deception here.” His hand slid into Michael’s, his eyes closed, and for a moment his face radiated pure bliss. Then abruptly he dropped his angel blade and jerked his hand out of Michael’s, covering the sides of his head and letting out a long wail.
“Cas, wait!” Dean called, but Castiel was faster, moving up the stairs and out through the thick steel door. He took the steps to the road and turned right, away from Lebanon, though he knew he wouldn’t walk too far. A swirl of sensations—
He tilted forward and slashed at her with the top point, pivoting to avoid her blade. Although the star offered some protection, it was large and unwieldy. Castiel itched to have it in his hand, more
As dusk settled onto the eastern plains of Kansas, Sam exited Interstate 70 into the college town of Hays. While the lower elevation was making breathing more comfortable than it had been going through the Rockies, it was by no means easy. In addition, he’d not been able to eat much, feeling queasy even with his go-to snacks. He studied a Super 8 motel across the road while he gassed up the SUV and considered another night of rest. The bunker was another two hours away, but the thought of spending the night on a mattress that was likely either too firm or too soft was unacceptable. Besides, Dean and Cas might be back soon.
“Let me ask you this, Castiel. Teleportation, even with a few lighting effects? Any angel can do that. But do you really think this nebbish could
“Such a rebel,” Pamela said. “I like that about you.” She turned to Dean. “And last but definitely not least is Dean Winchester. Dean is the author of the Beast Hunters series published by PRHB, and he’s got the whole deal: agent, editor, marketing department, art department, you name it. Dean?”
“—breaking news from the White House this morning that Congress was unable to pass the legislation that would guarantee human safety against violent angel retaliations. The House passed a bill last week, but neither that bill nor the Senate’s own bill—”
he killed me, and I decided to keep it that way. Took me weeks of practice to get the charred wings to come out right. Two: I was
“Thought so.” Sam stood and made sure he left plenty of cash for their meals. “You suppose we can walk out of here without getting mobbed by fans of people who are not us?”
Dean nodded, chewing and swallowing a bite. “So, what’s the plan, then? We know what we’re doing next?”
“Pfft. They’re already in Heaven because of their choices. Give them more freedom, more choices, and it comes with a bit of responsibility to keep Heaven open. The sheer number of souls there is going to mean an individual soul won’t notice it at all. And we’ll be honest about it. Transparent. No tricks.”
overlapping each other. Before Sam could respond, hands were reaching for him, wanting to touch any part of him.
Sam grabbed a chair from the small table to the side of the room and sat down a few feet away. He exhaled sharply before trying again. “I’m glad we got the cuffs off of you. That’s gotta feel better.”
“Ew, gross,” Sam said, waving his hand at them as if to shoo them away. “Go be at one somewhere else. No! Forget I said that!” He ran his hands through his hair. “I do
sentence, writers.” She winked. “On the end, we have Kevin Tran, acquisitions editor for Tor Books. Kevin, you’re not published yourself, but you play a key part in publishing others.”
“Yeah.” Sam shrugged. “He was kind of helpful. Talked in riddles, but…I just feel like he actually cares.”
Castiel closed the door quietly and made his way through the gray swirl to the next door before knocking softly.
“Yep! Gosh, I’m not sure how I’m going to do this in one sentence, except I’m really good with conjunctions—have that whole
“Same,” Gabriel added. “It’s all about intention. Honestly, the finger snapping is largely for effect. Lets humans know how easy it would be for us to squash you like bugs.”
Sam closed his laptop and made his way into the kitchen, surprised to see Cas sitting at the table, seemingly entranced with his fingers. “Hey, Cas.”
Pamela welcomed everyone warmly and indicated the five panelists with her arm. “I’m going to introduce each of you and I’d like you to say one sentence about your path to publication. Just
This time Sam didn’t interrupt. Breathing heavily, Castiel slid out, causing Dean to hiss at the sensation. He used his grace again to remove the fluids but left them both with the residual physical feelings.
, make yourself God and almost destroy the planet, then set the leviathan loose and nearly destroy it again. You never talk to me, never come ask for
He immediately thought of those furrowed lips against his. Would they be soft? And that perpetual stubble. He imagined Cas groaning
“It was… I remembered creation. And the words that led to a fish beaching itself so it could walk on land and eventually, through eons of evolution, become
“How come we started out talking about saving your brother and you turned it all around and are trying to save me? Again.” Dean stood without waiting for Castiel to answer and ran his hand over his face. “I’m beat. I gotta get some sleep.”
Castiel felt those same doubts rise again. “You can love someone and still not intervene when bad things happen. I’m not a parent, but I can imagine that’s part of letting them grow up. Making their own choices, both good and bad.”
“Figure Chuck is behind them. Whatever he did to you.” A cold dread suddenly filled Dean’s veins. “He didn’t reset you too, did he?”
Castiel let his frustration bleed into his words. “If you want my help, it would behoove you not to insult me.”
Carefully, Cas removed the wing cuffs, setting them on the library table. With pain obvious on his face, Gabriel slowly stretched out his wings a little. The holes where the cuffs had pierced his wings were ugly and oozing; one had started to bleed.
“Why would the angels stay here?” Dean mused, looking at Castiel. “I mean, hell, all it takes is one uncomfortable conversation or one question you guys don’t want to answer and you’re out of here. Why stay and have to go through the whole identification process?”
“It appears they designed the implants to render ordinary angels as close to human as possible. Gabriel is an archangel. He has abilities that they may not know about, or may not know how to subdue. Telepathy with one specific angel is currently unaffected. He’s trying to figure out what he can still do without alerting the guards, who, he says, are not even remotely following the Geneva Conventions.”
Cas shot him a confused look. “Sometimes monumental ones.” He paused when Dean chuckled, then turned back to Jack. “You need to forgive yourself too. Hating yourself will lead you away from free will. Your choices will be blinded by self-hate. That’s not free will. That’s not choice.”
“The energy is…” Cas seemed to be searching for the right word. “Invigorating. My faith in the future of reading and books is restored. At least until I go home.”
“Headin’ up from Texas to see family in Wisconsin,” Dean said, adding a grin. “Go Packers.” He filled out the registration form, then pulled out his wallet and gave her his credit card.
“No. Balthazar was sent to bring me to Naomi’s office. She didn’t like that I’d interfered, even though what I did ensured the future Heaven wanted.”
Dean downed more of his beer, then wiped his mouth and chin with his hand. “Yeah, we were pretty close. I had the laptop resting on our thighs. His and mine.”
“Right. I mean, he could have recorded our conversation, but I don’t think he would. He didn’t tell me he was doing anything other than taking notes. And he asked about that before he did it.” Dean’s paranoia began manufacturing scenarios. What if Cas was lying to him? What if there was no break-in? What if Cas
“So you cheated on me. You even said you stopped wearing your ring in solidarity with me. And then you go sleep with fake-me?”
They loaded the groceries into the rear of the van, then climbed into their seats. Dean pulled down the sun visor against the noontime light and a key fell out into his lap. “Son of a bitch,” he repeated. Looking dazed, he inserted the key into the ignition and the van started. “Guess what?” he asked, shaking his head slowly.
“Are you sure, Dean?” Sam seemed unconvinced. “I mean about trying to rescue Gabriel? He did kill you over a hundred times. And what are you going to do with him if you free him?”
“I have the town already,” Cas said, flipping through the pages of his spiral notebook. “Waterville, Maine. I came across this photo of the Colby College library in Waterville and it just... Here… I’m emailing you the photo…” Cas tapped for a few moments, his eyes downcast. “There. I had this idea that the final showdown would happen in front of this building. I don’t know why I like it so much, but it called to me.”
Flashing a quick smile, Sam raised his hand level with his face, palm facing Castiel. “Just notice.”
“Great!” Dean said. “I’ve been without it too long. That’ll teach me to wear it when I’m replacing an engine in a Ford F-250. Had to tilt that sucker to get it in.”
Cas sat back down on the bed. “I know. I’m not exactly fluent in human emotion either. Let’s start with what you want. What do you want, Dean?”
“Yeah, that sounds like a plan,” Dean said. “I don’t know what else we can do now.” He started back toward the van, Cas beside him, with the rest of them trailing behind. The moment he saw movement around the van, he stopped abruptly and raised his hand to stop the others. “Who’s there?” he called out.
Yitzhak fell silent as his father ordered. He glanced behind him, back down the path, then at his father, but the fear on his face spoke volumes. Running to alleged safety was more frightening than staying with his father.
After spending the rest of yesterday watching movies and trading tender kisses with Dean, Castiel felt the need for another EMDR session like an itch under his skin. He could tell there was more to process, something more he needed to glean from this, but had no idea what it might be.
“You ever had a wing massage before?” Dean asked, the idea of it feeling both thrilling and somehow forbidden.
Barb sucked in a gasp. “I knew I hated that basement.” She continued to dress Sam’s wounds carefully. “I guess I kind of feel sorry for Gwendolyn, if she lost her baby and then had to watch her landlady have one. But it doesn’t excuse murder.”
“Hey, keep it going through the credits,” Sam said, a little annoyed when Dean made a move for the remote to eject the
About fifteen minutes later, he saw a black SUV flanked by two squad cars with their lights flashing turn the corner onto University, where they waited. Dean felt himself tense as they approached, until a warm hand squeezed his thigh just above his knee.
“Fine. I’ll order two cheeseburgers with fries and you can steal half off my plate.” He stood and held a hand out to Cas to help him up.
“While there are still epic battles and supernatural creatures, this series is really a story about friendship and family, about hope and determination, about how the choices we make tell the world who we are.”
Dean’s posture curled in slightly, his shoulders hunched, and his steps became shorter and slower. His hands, too, went from easily maneuvering the cart to gripping the handle tightly. Dean’s gaze went slightly out of focus, as if he was concentrating on something internal, and Castiel could feel a wave of emotion coming off him. He focused on the lyrics, watching Dean’s lips move as if he was barely mouthing along.
Castiel sent a bit of his awareness out with his grace, trying to find Dean, but it was no use. Dean was still warded. Gabriel was easy to find, but was busy with something and waved him away. There was a brief and odd connection with someone else who looked a lot like Jimmy Novak. It wasn’t enough to get a full read on, but he caught glimpses of laughter laced with regret, two children playing in a park, and unconditional love that shattered into a million pieces when a little girl asked, “Is this a dream?” It was difficult to understand without any context, but he understood one thing: family—whether by birth or by choice—was what one mourned leaving and rejoiced coming home to.
“This is my fault,” Jack muttered, near tears. “I keep getting people hurt. I keep hurting Castiel. I’m trying
When they paused for breath, Cas rested his forehead against Dean’s. “I don’t know about you,” Cas panted, “but I’d vote for moving this to the bed.”
“No, Gabe. It doesn’t just go away. I’ve been there. Sometimes I think I still am there. Maybe…” He shrugged. “Maybe we could help each other.”
Castiel nodded his understanding. “Orders. Their orders were to take vessels and seek Lucifer. Even if he’s made some peace with God, it’s still not safe for him to be walking around.”
Castiel stood alone in Naomi’s office. Ashen wings were burned into the floor, marring the otherwise pristine, white room. Except for a spot of color, or several spots, floating in a large, clear jar on the credenza behind Naomi’s desk. Intrigued, Castiel went over to examine it. Multicolored wisps moved around within the jar, suspended in air, and seemed to grow excited and bumped against the walls of the jar as he drew closer. As he put his hand to the glass, the wisps gathered as close as possible, trying to rub themselves on him, like so many ethereal cats. Prompted by some instinct, he lifted the top off the jar, and the wisps immediately flew to him, caressing his face, making some sort of tiny purring noise before they gathered in front of his mouth and paused, as if asking permission.
“Oh, Sam…” Gabriel lowered his hands. “I can heal the hole, but it’s going to take a few sessions. It’ll become smaller each time. I think maybe once an hour ought to work.”
“I already tried civil disobedience,” Castiel interrupted. “Look how well that turned out. I am a…lesson to all of them. They won’t disobey.”
“You’d be surprised how many haven’t,” Charlie said. “Hermione is my hero. If she’d believed what others said about Muggle-born children, she’d never have made it as far as she did. She believed in herself, in her own power. That made all the difference. So I believe in myself and I ignore what others say. They aren’t me and they don’t have the same experiences I have. Most of them know nothing about how I run my business. They haven’t earned the right to give me constructive feedback.”
“Dean.” Sam stopped his brother in the hall. “What are you talking about? I just brought you a snack.”
—bigger. I love all of you because you are all Dean. Now… Behind that door are four more Deans, and I love them as well.”
“And you came in here to tell me about Brady and being bi-curious as some lead-up to telling me you’re hooking up with Gabe now? Are you
In no time, he was dressed and ready to head out. “Are we meeting him—” He stopped as soon as he saw Sam waiting for them outside. Sam looked both exhausted and hopeless, like he was just one step from giving up. “Sam, I’m—”
“I really am working on a case,” Castiel said. “And how I answer you will depend on your answers. What do you see here?”
“What other avenues of investigation are you pursuing?” Cas asked as Dean made his way toward the dungeon.
“Oh. Sorry.” Cas retreated a couple of inches, then began unbuttoning his own shirt from the bottom, their hands meeting in the middle.
“No, not airplanes. There are seven planes of existence in this universe, some of which are subdivided. We’re currently in the physical plane, the lowest plane. Next to the physical plane is the etheric plane. It looks much like this one, but…vibrates at a different frequency. I can see into the etheric plane. You cannot.”
“He was friggin’ polite. And helpful. I don’t know any supernatural creature—not a single one—that offers help without wanting something in return. Usually something bloody and painful.”
Dean shook his head emphatically. “Nobody. And when I opened my door, everything looked kinda gray and fuzzy. And then when I got closer to it, it was like I just sorta squeezed through it and then I was here.”
Castiel nodded affirmatively at Sam, then looked back at Dean. “What’s outside of your bedroom? When you don’t have to hide anymore?”
“Hey. I’m doing ninety,” Dean said, glancing at the speedometer. “It’s going to be even longer if I get pulled over, not to mention the whole two-angels-in-the-backseat problem.”
“But Dad says it’s okay to hurt angels,” Stephen said, dropping half a dozen black feathers onto the pavement. “They don’t really feel anything anyway.”
“Is it?” Cas’ voice dropped even lower. “I was created to protect humanity, to protect life. Death is a tool. Life is the purpose.”
“I told you, Gabriel, obedient angels got Heaven to where it is now. Maybe it needs a screw-up to save it. You don’t have to hand your grace over to them.”
In the men’s section, Castiel didn’t even know where to begin. Long sleeves, short sleeves, dress shirts, t-shirts, stripes, solids… He wandered rather aimlessly, fingers trailing along the hanging merchandise, until one texture caught his attention. It was softer than Dean’s flannel, warmer and thicker, feeling like it might withstand the necessary cuts. He unzipped the front of the garment and put his hand inside, immediately relishing the feeling. It felt…safe. And if he needed to have his wings out, this would perhaps soften the blow. This particular item was bright yellow, the color of bees, but maybe not the best for keeping a low profile.
“Yes. I would have thought you’d have more to say about my arguing with the camel, especially when it insisted on speaking only ancient Akkadian.”
He looked in the rear view mirror to see how Castiel had positioned himself, but could only make out his face against a background of black. Glancing over his shoulder, the rest of the picture became clear. Castiel was sitting nearly sideways on the bench seat, one wing taking up most of the footwell, the other pressed to the back of the seat, the main joint flexed forward and the flight feathers extending all along the width of the car.
“Can you feel my emotions too?” Dean asked. “‘Cause I’m not sure I’m all that happy about you having that much access in my head.”
He felt fingers on his chin, lifting his face, though he wasn’t registering anything visual. There was just gray and a mantra of
He passed a Dairy Queen, a Subway, and a diner with a grand total of six parking spaces before a familiar sight came into view. Just off the highway was what looked like a salvage yard, not too dissimilar from Bobby’s. Seeing it brought back memory pangs of simpler times, even though they were just as painful. After checking the yard for any sort of surveillance and finding none, he kept his eyes open for a set of plates that would be easily accessible. He skirted past the back half of a pickup truck and the shell of a motorboat before he came to a mid-80’s Chevy G20 van with two flat tires, a busted rear axle, and plates just asking to be taken.
“You wanna change into something more comfortable?” Dean asked. “You could borrow some sleep pants or something.” The thought of Cas wearing his clothes absolutely did
“You were hit by a spell, which fractured your personality along lines of trauma. Three of the parts are children. One is a suicidal adult. Two are very angry. I need your help, Dean. I need to help you heal these rifts, and become whole again.”
At that, Dean looked around the room, his anxiety obviously increasing along with his heart rate and respiration. “I don’t know where I am. I don’t know where Sammy is.”
Dean chuckled. “Yeah, well… Your words. So, what does this deal entail? We gotta worry about it right away?”
Kelly here from Colorado Ghost & Entity (COGENT). I got ur email. Wld love help w/this case. We investigated & was inconclusive. Can’t revisit til next month.
,” Cas growled, pressing his hips into Dean’s and earning a reciprocal push and groan. “So beautiful. So bright. So strong. So brave.”
“I mean, it could be a coincidence,” Sam said, closing out the tabs, “you running into him at the diner.”
he was in the store with you and not after he left? I could count the possibilities on one hand.” He wiggled his fingers in the air.
“Step aside, Dean Winchester,” Rowena scolded. “I just need the angel. Former angel.” She waved her hand dismissively. “Half-angel. Whatever.”
Castiel followed Sam’s hand back and forth, again feeling at first like it was too fast, that he was lagging behind. He brought awareness to his head, making sure it stayed in one place while his eyes followed the movement. The muscles around his eyeballs ached as if unused to the motion. Gradually, he settled into the rhythmic back-and-forth, relaxing and letting himself float, certain now that he wasn’t about to leave his vessel.
“Dean…” Castiel could feel his own newer emotions building. Something like grief that hadn’t happened yet. “I can’t promise forever. I’m still an angel. Not a very good one, but… I already know what happens to me when I die. I don’t think humans ever go there, to The Empty.”
Dean glanced over. Cas seemed more relaxed, less terrified. The angel had faced monsters, demons, had his own experience of Hell that they’d never talked about, so whatever Naomi had done, whatever had spooked him, had to have been worse than any of those other things. Dean didn’t even want to think about what that might mean.
Slowly, Cas held it out. It was a lined journal with a bright yellow cover. On the front it had a smiling cartoon bee and said
Gabriel stood straighter, an innocent look masking his face. “Just be a few, Deano. Angel business. You understand, right?”
“Yeah, well I wrote most of it half-drunk in this bar in Ames called London Underground.” Dean shrugged. “Sometimes I do my best writing when I get my inhibitions out of the way.”
Gabriel tried manipulating the tool into the hole in the cuffs and nearly dropped it before Cas grabbed it out of his hands, and deftly inserted it into the lock. With a loud click, the cuffs opened and clanged to the floor. Exhaling loudly, Gabriel rubbed his wrists where they were raw and abraded, then turned his back to Cas with an air of impatience. “Get ‘em off, Castiel. Please.”
sleeping and Cas was in there with him might mean that— Nope. Not going there. No answer from his knock, so he opened the door while wanting to squeeze his eyes shut.
He took 35E southbound into the suburb of Eagan, followed a confusing series of turns, and took Pilot Knob Road south. Based on their research of the area’s traffic cameras, they were now invisible. A little over a mile later, he swung east, following a four-lane highway that quickly became a rural two-lane road curving through some regional park. Another turn south onto Highway 3 and they were officially in the middle of nowhere.
Dean realized that the guy’s gravelly voice was natural and not an effect of not having used it much this morning. “I hear you. Where’s home?”
“Enough, Castiel.” With a flick of Naomi’s wrist, the chair reached out for him, pulling him back. Each step toward him that she took, she grew taller, broader, armor appearing and covering her in complete protection. Her drill became an angel blade, its tip already dripping grace and blood.
“Oh. Yes, I suppose that would be wise.” Castiel settled back down on the bed, returning his focus to Dean. “Thank you for watching out for us,” he added.
“Hey! What’d I miss?” Charlie said, a little out of breath as she followed along, her legs taking two strides for every one of theirs.
Cas was quiet for a few moments. “No. You’re right, Dean. Especially when I can’t sense any deception from him.”
Dean let Sam lead the way and grabbed a second beer from the fridge before he left the kitchen. Castiel waited for Gabriel to shuffle out before he picked up the rear.
The diner had six tables crammed into a long, narrow room. Cas took his usual place next to him at the rectangular table; Gabriel and Jack sat on the other side of the table. The laminated menus were sticky, the tabletops looked like Formica, and the kitchen smelled like the absolute best of greasy comfort food. Steak and eggs caught his eye, while Gabriel said something about a triple short-stack of pancakes.
“You know what?” Dean said. “I think Sam needs to hear this. Stay put.” He directed a glare at Gabriel and left the room.
“Well, Jack can obviously do it,” Dean said, “but, uh, he needs a little work on the accuracy, right?”
“A bit. I’m not trained in it or anything, but I learned about it during a CNA clinical program I did recently in a psychiatric care unit.”
“I give you my word, Sam. Between the cuffs and the implant, there’s not a lot I can do, but I’ll do whatever I can to help.”
The hopelessness Dean felt now seemed to be on a cosmic scale. Heaven was dying. His mom was trapped in a dystopian world with Lucifer and a bunch of human-hating angels. The five of them trapped in this world had no way home. He looked over at Gabriel. “Sam said you were thinkin’ of staying here.”
“That depends entirely on how you define failure,” Michael spoke up. “You are used to your world, which, as I’ve said before, is fractured and concrete. Even a sixth sense, or any of the other senses one might possess, must be expressed through the five senses there. A fractured, concrete world requires spells, objects that are proof of your intentions, desires, and honesty. Trying to reach a goal and falling short is only failure if your value is winning. When your value is growth, trying to reach a goal and falling short is progress.”
“Okay. Well, I think we got the plans for springing him as worked out as we can without actually being there. You got enough juice to do what you suggested?”
“We’ve been over this, Dean. I can take care of myself. And none of this has any bearing on what I told you last night.”
“I don’t care,” Jack said. “It feels…” He put his hand over his chest. “Right. It feels right.” Jack appraised Michael. “You feel right too. Not like the other one. The other one felt very wrong.”
“This can be pretty intense,” Sam agreed. “And we’re all still grieving, honestly. Maybe you guys go shopping for that journal. I’ll see if there are any more signs of Jack. Meet back here in a few hours?”
“Dean, all we’re trying to do is help,” Sam said, standing up cautiously. “We care for you. We love you.”
Carefully, Dean stroked the joint, the winglet almost seeming to caress him back. “Cas,” he said, his voice rough, “I don’t know what to say. They’re…”
“Okay.” Dean nodded once as his brother left the room. He gave up on the remainder of his breakfast, tossing it in the garbage and turning on the faucet to wash the dishes.
“Well, a lot of the menfolk died in World War I. It was hard on the women, especially those with children. Women didn’t work then; there was no income. Many who had houses—” Izzy paused as a server brought two steaming cups and Sam’s wrap to the table, then thanked the server with a nod. She breathed in the scent from her chai tea and motioned Sam to eat.
“I think what Dean’s trying to say,” Sam broke in, “is that because you’re not Jewish, you don’t have to follow the Jewish holidays.”
“If I call you, can you hear me?” Castiel asked, wondering what sort of containment they had around Gabriel’s power.
Castiel allowed himself a small smile as Dean drained the sink and wiped around it. “I’m not in danger of birthing any nephilim, no.”
Standing, Dean ran a hand over the back of his neck, trying to figure out what to say next. “I’m not sure Sam wants—”
“In due time,” Michael said. “You also will understand.” He gave Cas an intense stare, and even in the fading light, Dean could make out that his gray eyes had an ethereal quality to them. “Take my hand, Castiel. Just for a moment.”
Suicidal Dean chuckled. “You just said it after raining sparks down on my head. It was memorable.” He was quiet for several moments. “Thank you.”
Moments later, Dean pulled up a chair to sit next to him, and Castiel immediately felt more grounded, much as he had when Dean lay next to him the previous night. He relaxed his grip on the chair arms and felt the tension ease in his shoulders.
“Gabriel doesn’t think he can be useful,” Dean said at the same time Castiel said, “Gabriel is leaving.”
Dean stopped in the hallway. “Look, if I told Sam, he’d give me thirty reasons why I shouldn’t, all of which would sound good, but bottom line? We need to know what he knows.” He resumed walking. “So I’m gonna summon his ass and keep him in the dungeon until he gives it up.” Not hearing a second set of footsteps, Dean stopped again and looked behind him. “Cas, what’re you—?”
“Maybe he needs to be introduced to more fun.” Gabriel held his hands up. “Before you say anything else, I’m not baiting him, okay? But I do want to get to know him better. I don’t know why. Is that a crime?”
“Cas is better,” Dean said. “At least he’s awake and pissing me off. He won’t talk about what happened.”
Cas wasn’t going to let him out of this, that much was clear, and no matter how much Dean argued, he’d eventually wind up telling Cas anyway. Better just get it over with now and save everyone a lot of drama. Taking the headphones off and setting them on the bed, Dean nodded and felt the fingers drop from his chin, his skin suddenly aching for the touch. “My mom had a rose garden. She loved roses. Red and pink, sometimes yellow. She’d cut them and bring them in the house. Vases all over. I remember her telling me not to touch ‘cause of the thorns.”
“Why didn’t you say so?” Gabe looked around the Impala’s interior, nodded once, then looked down at his attire. In the blink of an eye, it turned the perfect shade of black to match the seat. The brass mesh hugging the back of his neck now looked almost like an intentional accessory.
“Great. Just what we needed.” Dean let out a long breath. “Well, let’s get these groceries and meet up with the others. At least we know angels exist in this universe. Maybe Sam can look into that in his research too.”
Castiel managed to slow his breathing. “Angels don’t have foreplay. Neither do they mate. Not in our true form. It’s both attractive and repulsive for angels to take a vessel, to consider experiencing human sexuality. We are not to even try. The vessels are not ours, simply on loan, and even if the soul gave their permission, it’s a gray area.”
A Home Depot employee—a manager, Dean guessed, by his attire—walked quickly toward the checkout lane and helped the stocky man, and what could only now be described as his angel slaves, haul his purchases out of the store.
Diving for his pillow, Dean felt under it, and finding nothing, scrambled for the nightstand drawer.
“I need…” Sam shook his head. “I’m going to need a couple days. And I need to talk to Gabriel before we look into the cuffs.”
“Sammy! Dinner!” Dean ducked back into the kitchen after shouting down the hallway, grabbed the basket of garlic bread and a bowl of salad for Sam, and brought them out onto the map table where the lasagna was still bubbling in its pan.
Castiel watched all the Deans as introductions were made and stories swapped. There was a lot of thoughtful head-shaking, as if each one was trying to wrap their minds around the others’ perspectives and experiences. Four-year-old Dean was the first to be fully accepted by all the others, picked up and hugged and passed around.
All of the contractual issues that Sam talks about are common, boilerplate parts of a traditional book contract, including the right of first refusal. As far as the ownership of series title rights, that is sometimes written into a book contract as a way to keep an author from taking a more lucrative offer with another publisher for their series. I know at least three authors personally who had that happen to them, and could not take their series or characters anywhere else, even after the publisher dropped their series. One author had to resort to legal action to regain his rights. The other two started writing new series.
something with Cas. Jack had done something similar, before he was even born. What was the damage this time?
“And the art,” Sam continued, remembering some of the things he’d seen. “Really talented artists putting you guys in some compromising positions. Graphic positions.”
“Do you want to hear our specials today?” the young woman asked, her eyes a bright cornflower blue against fair, freckled skin and blond hair.
Sam nodded. “I did. The English word came from the Greek, and the Greek word came from the Hebrew, but I figured what a word meant and what you guys really are might not match. Tell me, did you think about that intentionally, or did it just come up?”
“As far as I know,” Castiel said, careful about how close he got to these unearthed memories of his time in Naomi’s chair, “Naomi did pretty much the same thing each time. And not only did she erase my failures and…reset, as you call it, my behavior and thinking, she also erased what she did to me. Early on, I didn’t even remember what her chair was for. Only that I didn’t like it.”
“I’ve met two different versions of you already,” Dean said, “and both of you are class-A dicks. One wanted to start the apocalypse and the other nearly wiped out humanity waging war with Hell. And that one has plans to take over
Cas mirrored Dean’s actions, removing his jacket and overshirt, then going further to pull Dean’s t-shirt up over his head.
He saw Cas’ truck parked at an angle in some sort of pull-out off the highway, but it looked empty. Even pulling up alongside it, he could see no movement inside. “Dammit, Cas, where are you?” he muttered.
Sam rolled his eyes. “I don’t know what’s gotten into him today. He’s often bitchy in the morning, but it was particularly bad today. He even pissed Cas off, which is honestly kind of hard to do.”
“You don’t have to help if you’ve got other things to do,” Dean said, taking the dishes and setting them in the dishwater.
Looking up from his phone, Dean realized Sam had been trying to get his attention for a while. “Yeah?”
“He said some things. That he was going to give something back to me. He seemed…unimpressed with the re-education in Heaven.” Cas fell silent, watching him for several minutes. “You can speak now, Dean.”
“You know we’re gonna need to keep an eye on him, more than before,” Dean said, after Jack retreated to his room in the bunker. He thought about the snake for a moment. “And no pets.”
“We still matter to Jack,” Cas insisted. “Or else he wouldn’t have run away. He’s afraid of your anger, for what he did to Mary.”
