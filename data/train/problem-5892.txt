The elevator pinged as the doors open. “ Tony I got your message. What up- Bucky ?” Steve stopped mid step as he looked up from his phone and saw his long lost love in the couch.
Quentin grasped at the hem of the pants and underwear and pulled it down at once, revealing Peter to the world.
(See the end of the chapter for
“ Maria is a genuine concern of mine. He is not safe to be around Tony. The man landed on that Maserati that bought for his birthday.”
He started to walk, he didn’t no where he was going, but nothing was going to get done by staying in one place.
“ I did not do anything to make them do this. I got my ass kicked today just like everyone else.”
He was already at the elevator waiting for JARVIS to send up a lift.
Nat just rolled and eyes and tried to contain a laugh.
Tony bristled as Loki smirked at him.
“ Oh my god. Oh my god.” Steve and Grant chanted as they both paced inside Tony’s room. The minute they had touched down, they Ran out off the Quinjet and into Tony’s room. The rest of the Avengers looked at him questioningly. He just rolled his eyes and followed after them.
“ He doesn’t really do the villain stuff anymore dad. He even helps me as Spiderman sometimes when he isn’t working.”
Noticing Tony’s discomfort though, Howard’s features soften as he sighed.
Peter looked up and saw a guy with brown hair and eyes standing in front of him. Peter couldn’t smell what he was.
Tony turned to the two of them, “ For Christ’s sake it’s just a god damn couples massage. So yes we have to get naked. It’s not a big deal. If you two didn’t want to do it why order it in the first place?”
Tony cried as he grasped Steve’s hand.
“ Who chases you?” Peter saw his poppa walk out of the kitchen, a dish rag in hand as if he had been cleaning dishes.
Morgan smiled, a mischievous twinkle in his eye as he rushed to Peters side.
Winghead nodded, his body, Tony noticed was also turned away from him. Tony cupped Wingheads chin and turned him toward him, forcing his body to turn somewhat and revealing what appeared to be a rather large erection coming out of a slit in the  anterior potion he was trying to cover.
“Well it’s not like it was those two that took over the world.” Tony supplied.
Peter shook his head. “That doesn’t make me feel any better.”
Steve huffed at that. “Now that you’ve met him, you can leave.”
“ In fact I do and it is less ridiculous than your idea of a disguise.”
Steve ignored him. But Clint was right, he might have overdone it a bit on the cologne. But Tony didn’t comment on it as Steve placed the coffee in front of him and opened the doughnut box in front of him, revealing a variety of different doughnuts including the ones with the creme in the middle. Tony raised an eyebrow at Bucky who just shrugged.
Tony held on to Bucky’s head as he felt his hips move on instinct. Steve pulled Tony’s head away form his mouth and began to assault his throat with kisses and bites. There would probably be love marks in the Morning but at this point he did not care.
“ Don’t be trying to get a taste test. I want to keep my leg.”
“ He’s part of the team. He needs to be on hand for emergencies.” Rhodey explained.
Winghead just cooed and smiled down at him.
Quentin smirked and grabbed Peters hair roughly and leaned to and began  to kiss him. Peter moaned into the kiss and that was all he needed to for Quentin to slip his tongue through his lips and into his mouth. Quentin pulled back and briefly marveled at the swollen red lips that he had been kissing seconds before.
Harry quickly grabbed him to support him.
“ I-I hope so. Thank you.” Tony could practically hear him blushing and smiling from the praise. This was fucking nuts.
“ Not yet...” Steve chuckled.
“ I want to pet a kangaroo!.”
“ What the fuck?! Why is the zipper not working?”
“ What am I supposed to do with this?”
“ Yes, we wanted to know if you could us with it. He’s been acting quite aggressive lately and injured Tony’s assistant.” Bruce informed.
Tony was led to the bed shortly after he orgasmed and was unceremoniously tossed onto it. Steve had quickly handcuffed him onto the bed as Grant positioned himself between his legs.
“ Please tell me he’s not like in his forties.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “ Conversation for another time.
I’m looking for a Tony x Steve fanfic. Steve gets teleported into another universe where Tony is locked up after being deemed a criminal. The other universes Steve doesn’t want to interacting with their Tony. Steve has to wait until his tony can open a portal to save him. At the end Steve’s Tony opens a portal and rescues him. The other universe Avengers are wary of him. Tony was able to open the portal by using the i dirt stones and with the help of Jane Foster. At the end the other universe Captain America makes amends with the other universes Tony and it can be alluded that they try to start a relationship.
“ I thought he was male,” Sam said, obviously disturbed by the image.
Harry just smiled. “ No problem. So are you free? There’s this restaurant down town that is pretty nice that we could try.”
“ Thank you.” Tony said softly. Again with the bitch thing.
“ Yeah just like that. Get it nice and wet. And slowly enter your finger.”
Grant looked at him startled.
“ Get the fuck off me!” The older man snarled. He looked so much like his father in his world. Nat and Bucky reluctantly let him go and he came over. Tony noticed even though he had a cane. He didn’t use it, not that he needed it judging from his strong and confident stride. Instead he held it by its midsection and carried it.
Peter: “ What did you have in mind?”
“ Really Morgan?”
He gave him a small smile. “ Need something Cap?”
So his attempts at courtship were probably less than stellar. He didn’t know Tony was a good fighter and how the hell he was supposed to know that it was poison ivy he grabbed. He didn’t get a reaction why would Tony get one? It just didn’t make any sense. And then there was Howard, he was the absolute worse. The man hated Steve with a passion and did nothing to hide his feelings. It was so ridiculous to think that he thinks Steve would somehow corrupt Tony. The man was bragging yesterday with Greg how he had people taken shots off of him in college. The worse Steve could do was give him a coupon collecting habit.  And why the hell did Howard think Rhodey was a better choice than him? Rhodey was decent looking but he looked nothing like Steve. And the man was not a national icon. Rhodey took orders and Steve gave them. He was a natural born leader, the apex Solider of the army. How was he a bad choice. He looked up from his book and saw Tony reading on the couch next to him off his Starkpad. He said he had wanted to review some company material for his dad. Everyone and their grandmother knew that there was a Tony from another universe living at the Tower.
Pete sighed. “ I really miss you though. I wish we could see each other more. Me too babe, but this is what I do for a living.”
“ Yeah but we can’t have him coming out of his cell and beating the shit out of you again. “
“ Well I was told it makes your partner feel good.”
“ I’m...I’m...” Morgan was not able to finish the thought as he came with a groan.
Steve and Grant looked at the therapists wide-eyed.
James growled back. “ It’s the truth! He did sleep around.”
He broke the surface seconds later. He coughed out water and get a hand slap him on the back, helping him dispel it. He felt himself being adjusted and laid on his stomach. He looked down as was face to face with Winghead. He was casually gliding the surface of the water, rubbing comforting circles on Tony’s back. He was whimpering and looked up at him apologetically.
“ You are annoying,” Steve groaned.
Clint chuckled at Bucky’s pouting face.
Tony felt something touch his hole . It was blunt and large and Tony didn’t need to be a genius to guess what it was. He grimaced slightly as he felt it widened. He bit his lip to hide is discomfort. He wanted Steve to have this. He was going to give him this. When he bottomed out, Steve gave a loud groan and held himself still above him.
Quentin rolled his eyes.  “ Well this was your idea.”
“ What?!” The three teenagers shouted out in surprise.
Tony glared at the two super soldiers, “ Aren’t you two going to explain yourself. You two are the reason why I’m covered in bruises.”
Bucky chuckled. “ That sounds about right. Did you expect your counterpart to be a Harvard professor or some shit?”
Over again than this. Why did he have to be such a mama’s boy?
“ We heard about the fire in the kitchen and we wanted to make sure you were alright. Good thing we came because Steve was getting a little handsy. That little rat.” Howard seethed.
“ As you wish.”
“ If they find out yes. But I’m being pretty discreet with my new partner.”
Wanda nodded again.
“ Stevie, you need to stop this. This is Not healthy.” Bucky said.
“ You little imbecile! You could have gotten hurt or killed. Those police men thought you were a domestic terrorist dressed up as Iron Man. Did you not think this through? Of course not because you never think things through. You think just because you are Tony Stark you are invincible.”
“ Don’t Fret doll. I don’t like seeing you sad and neither does Stevie.” Bucky kisses his cheek.
Ned gave a drawn out whistle. “ That sucks.”
Tony broke out of the hold and smiled at Winghead who looked a little putout. “ Hey buddy, I don’t put out on the first date. “ That was a total lie. He’ll sleep with anything, no date required. That was like his motto. But that motto didn’t apply to handsy and aggressive mermen.
“ But he was bullying...”
“ I was told you could fix my leg. Can you do that?”
“ It’s our team. As in Tony and I. We are co-leaders.” Steve interrupted. Tony rolled his eyes, these two were really getting on his nerves.
Harry went to his closet went Peter following behind his excitedly.
“ Tony,” Sam reminded.
“ What?”
“ Oh thank the gods you have a vagina.” The blonde man sighed loudly.”
“ He got you there punk!” Bucky laughed. Steve just glared at him as his face turned redder.
“ B-But your majesty if you give him back then it’s obvious that he is not behaving. We thought you wanted to give him back. There must have been some miscommunication.
Steve gripped onto his thighs harder and began to thrust faster, causing Tony to bounce on his dick.
Steve seemed to panic. “ Well you see... um... Ultron was Tony’s... this universes Tony....pet project. He was designed to help us and is very good. You can test him yourself and do whatever diagnostic you need to Tony. Just please calm down. You’re scaring me. I don’t want you to hurt yourself.”
“ I’m pretty sure I could lead the way.” Tony leaned down and kissed Steve on the lips. Steve reciprocated. Tony grabbed his hands and led them to his waist to hold.
Tony sighed as he waited outside the doors. He was going to die. Well that thought wasn’t new. He did ad a risky lifestyle as a part time super hero and before that his partying habits. So yeah. There was that.
“ Guys come on, you don’t have to do this. I wasn’t trying to make you feel bad.”
Tony remembered this floor. They often held SI business meetings here.
Hi everyone! Here is another update! I’m happy that people actually like the fic and are leaving kudos for it! Please feel free to leave your comments and I look forward to hearing from you. Hopefully I’ll have another chapter up soon. Again thanks for your support.
It didn’t take long for Tony to come after that and Steve followed shortly after. Steve barely kept himself from falling on top of Tony.  Tony thought maybe he had blackout a bit because the next thing he knew he was wiped clean and the not- Steve was nestled behind him, kissing him behind his ear.
Tony was smiling triumphantly, but panting hard. He was leaning over Steve, his face just inches away. His eyes became hooded as he bent down and pressed his lips to Steve.
At some point he found himself with the littlest member of the group thrusted into his arms. The infant was happy to rub its hands over his mustache  and blow raspberries at him.
Tony began to undo the his belt and pants, trying to push it down his hips as Steve pushed his body down onto the bed.
Steve reappeared with some sparkling wine. Tony noticed the brand and it was his favorite. Steve poured a glass for both him and himself before depositing the bottle on the table and sitting down.
Tony smiled and shook his head. “ No, no. It’s not Pepper.”
“ What now that Nat undoubtedly heard us fucking with him up my ass, you start having second thoughts. You know what? Fuck you.” Tony felt the tears started to stream down his face. Of course Steve wouldn’t want to be with him or his alternate universe counterpart. Because he was a fuck up always had been.
Followed me to the quinjet.” Tony responded.
“ Because right after breakfast I’ll take you to my place and fuck you over my dining room table.”
Tony wasn’t given much preamble before Steve pushed himself in. Tony bit into a fur in front of him as the werewolf thrusted forward. Shit. He prepared himself and it still hurt. He screamed as Steve began to thrust forward. It probably sounded more like muffled moans to him or he probably didn’t hear it over his own noises.
Tony wanted to roll his eyes. Maybe it was because nothing was supposed to go up that end. But he kept his opinions to himself.  No use in making the man angry.
He gave Nat a shocked look. Well Tony had to give it to her. His respect for her definitely increased ten fold. Especially at the inference that both Bruce and Bucky basically did whatever she said.
“ The public will think we are allied with Hydra.”
Tony gave him a smile smile back. “I’m sure it’ll taste fantastic.”
“ Jarvis, honey, when will Ana be here? She was supposed to get some honey croissants for Tony. He is very upset right now. “ Maria asked as cuddled Tony closer to her.
“ I already know what you were going to say. And the answer is no. We are not installing a coffee maker in the bedroom.”
Clint pouted and whined about the injustice of the punishment.
Steve rolled his eyes and threw a pillow at him.
Peter shook his head, a little confused. Was his father famous? Was he an actor or something?
“ I want your to send his fucking friends to my estate, my secretary will be in contact with you.”
Tony internally sighed. It was going to take some more work to get this man under his thumb.
“You bastard! You said you wouldn’t hurt him,” he growled as he punched him. Grant yelled something incomprehensible back and began to swing as well.
“ Well then, he will need to keep his mouth shut. I don’t want to hear him bitch.”
“ What the hell are you doing here?”
‘Fucking asshole’, he thought.
“ You said all the brunettes and he is a brunette that fits the height requirements.”
Peter jumped up until he stood on the bed.
“ Come again?”
“ Am I missing something?” Tiny turned around and saw Grant enter the room.
Maria Hill handed a photograph to Fury. He looked at it briefly. That all he needed to make his decision.
The other Steve stiffened and he looked even more pissed. “ Well at least I never worked for Hydra.” He snapped.
“ Thing one and two left for school already,” Clint asked as he walked into the room.
“ Why you little slut!” The guy roughly grabbed his upper arm.
Steve heard his phone start to ring. It was Tony’s ring tone. He hurriedly jumped off his bed and pushed things around his night stand to try and find it. When he found it, He took a calming breath before answering.
“ I’m not going to get involved in this love triangle shit show. “
“ What?” Tony asked.
Tony flushed and covered himself.
They walked out the door and saw Nat leaning against the opposite wall. She rolled he eyes and flicked her hair back. “ Come on. We want to go home. What took you saw long.”
“ I like him!” The darker haired man exclaimed.
Wade captured Peters lips again and pulled him away from the door and began walking to What Peter could assume was the bedroom. He didn’t think about it too much as Wade slipped his tongue passed his lips and rubbed it obscenely against his own.
Greg rolled his eyes, “ Fine, we bought some hookers. We are not the first and won’t be the last.”
Peter was amazed at how his poppa was able to prevent his dad from calling Norman Osborn. He swears at times his stubbornness and sheer will was his super power. It had been a sight to see his dad try and climb over Captain America as he tried to calm down the enraged omega who kept yelling, “ Let him try and get near my son! That fucking bastard!”
But the reason I’m telling you this is because the serum does something  to them. It like amplifies their personality traits. Like before the serum Bucky was  always racist and he had a possessive streak a mile wide. When he thought my uncle and my cousin were going to come and take me away from him and he heard some rumor that my cousin had assaulted me. But that all it was a rumor. He never did that.  He went to Louisiana anyway and tortured and killed them. I heard Nat say it was my whole family, but it wasn’t but it still doesn’t make it right. I saw the pictures in the paper. It was awful what he did to them. That the only reason that I don’t fight back. I don’t want him to do that to anymore of my family. Steve also said that he was also loyal to a fault. Those things got amplified with the serum and apparently when he met me and stuff like that could happen again if he feels that I was wronged by someone or if someone could potentially split us up. br />
“ Briefing? Why would he need to go?” Steve asked.
Steve hissed again. He was getting closer to the shore.
Tony earnestly gave his opinion, happy to be included. Howard smiled at him proudly, as if Tony was his greatest achievement and not the new energy efficient car he was working on.  He praised his genius and Tony felt himself blush at the litany of compliments.
“ Hi there, looks like we meet again.”
“ Umm...” Harry tried to come up with something but was too stunned at having Peter basically grind and rub against him.
“ Yeah i Remember that. You were definitely telling someone not to stop.” Clint said with a mischievous smile as everyone else laughed. Tony looked aliens confused what was going on?
“  I’m not taking about that. I’m just wondering if I could have some advice. “
“ We don’t mean you any harm. I’m sorry you saw us fighting.” Strange said calmly.
They all laughed Except for two very disgruntled super soldiers.
“ Steve! Grant! Stop!” Tony cried out, but it was no use.
“ What the fuck? Failing? Pietro why am i just learning of this?” Steve said, a bit angry.
What the hell was going on?
“‘ if not Sunday is fine. Or you can tell me what days you are free.’ He must really want to get that chem homework done.” Morgan said sarcastically.
“ So like a booty call.”
“ Peter! Breakfast is ready!” His dad called.
Quentin smirked down at him. “ I’m a villain sweetheart, comes with the territory. But first let’s see what’s under that mask.”
“ I can hear you, asshole.”
“ Well I’m sorry if I’m a little surprised that my dad happens to know an entire pack of mermaids.” Tony snapped.
“ You never spar with us. How could we know he wasn’t taking advantage of you. “ Steve growled.
Steve smiled.
The elevator doors opened and Tony stepped into the penthouse. It was great to see Rhodey again, but he needed some rest especially after being emotionally drained from the therapy session. He continued to make his way to his bedroom until he saw both Steve and Grant sitting in the common area. They both jumped up when they saw Tony.
Hi I am looking for two fics.
“ Remember don’t hurt him, he is my son and I will come after you.”
“ It’s not the same,” Steve argued.
Tony put in his best “press and interview” smile.
Tony quickly took off his pants and underwear and tossed it into the corner. Steve yipped happily when Tony Laid back and spread his legs and quickly nestled himself between his limbs. Tony laughed as Steve nuzzled his neck.
Steve turned to Tony and saw him looking at him with a small smile gracing his lips. Steve glared at him.
The man nodded. “ I know, but this is the reality: you are the slave and he’s the master. I don’t think he’ll force you, but who knows how he’ll act if you start fighting him. He’s a nice guy, but at times he can be animalistic. He’s a fucking werewolf for crying out loud.”
“ You are going to have a hell of a headache tomorrow. How much did you drink.”
On the ground was a blonde man covered in flour and ketchup as well as the blueberry sauce of the pie he was currently eating. He looked a lot like-
“ Steve make yourself useful and grab a chair for my grandson,” Howard said dismissively.
What the hell is this?, Tony thought.
Tony turned his head slightly and saw the Nervous look on Steve’s face.
Peter showed him a wrist. “ Here.” Harry thought he looked so adorable when he was confused. But right now was not the time.
Cup of coffee in one hand and a box of doughnuts in the other.
Steve quickly handcuffed and and roughly pulled him away from the wall.
Steve smiled, “ It’s Commander Hydra.”
Steve looked scattered, a far cry from the master strategist.
Thanks for reading so far. Only a short update this week.
Tony hissed softly at the intrusion. Steve whispered softly small words of encouragement that he couldn’t decipher and small kisses on his leg. When he was fully sheathed In him, Steve fathered Tony up and flipped them over, with Tony in top. Tony scrunched his eyes and planted heavily.
“ Clint get your ass of the counter,” Bucky snapped, “ And Steve Schmidt told you to take him down to the lab to repair his suit. It’s obvious that he must have made it. Hell he was yelling about it when we took it away from him the first time.” Clint just stuck out his tongue at Bucky and didn’t leave his perch on the counter.
Beck laughed. “ I sure am. Don’t want to get heart attack. Remember I’m not as young as you.”
James looks at his phone and sighs when he read the text message. He typed out a quick reply, telling them he would be there right away. God he had become such a fucking pushover. He couldn’t believe he was going to ditch his SHIELD training so he could get tampons and some ibuprofen.
“Ok let me get one more finger in. “
Tony gave him a chaste kiss. “ You two go wit for me back on the bed. I want to you two to show me how much you want me.”
Steve and Grant both looked up at him like two chastised puppies.
The man was wearing high waisted khaki pants that were held up with suspenders. His shirt was a light blue plaid button up with its sleeves pushed to his elbows. His hair was slicked back and he...
“ Anthony. I love you and will do anything for you but you know why I hate to be called father.”
“ All the girls are wearing-“
“Did you not learn from the last incident? You were trying to have sex with a college student so that he could give you alcohol. Poppa literally kicked your ass.”
Tony nodded and wiped his tears. “ I know. I want to.  But I don’t know how.”
‘And he still has the attitude’ Tony thought.
She looked at him in awe. “Really?! Oh my god, I’m a big fan. You are the the reason why I went to engineering school.”
He nodded.
Tony noticed he was he only one laughing.
“ I guess we still have to do this...” Steve motioned to the bed.
“ Nope. I’m not doing anything. I’m free.”
“ Osborne’s kid. He goes to Peters school. The brat had the nerve to chase him down and flirt with him in front of me.”
“ Salad.” Steve said nonchalantly.
“ Would you believe me if I said your subconscious?”
Tony looked at Steve and that is when he realized something. “ Why are you already half naked?”
Peter made a snorting sound.
The strange truce between the two blondes continued for the rest of the week. They held meetings, asked each other for advice and crates workout regimens together. They hadn’t argued once since that little debacle with the Commander rushing toward the Avenger’s fight with his Hydra Shield. It was kind of odd. Tony was happy they weren’t fighting but two Caps was just too much to handle. Too much bosssyiness and too much ordering around. He was going to solve this once and for all.
“Yes. And please don’t interrupt. I will explain.” Strange sighs and takes another sip of coffee.
“ Sir, it’s the Squadron. They are in Time Square.”
“ I would prefer it to happen before I turn 60.”
“ Sure,” Tony replied. He might as well get something out of this relationship.
“ God youre so beautiful so fucking perfect.” Steve whispered As he kissed along the neck in front of him.
I’m looking for a fic that Tony x Bucky. X Steve. Where Bucky suddenly walks into Tony’s lab and he screams, alerting Steve who comes rushing in with his shield. Tony then has the coax the Winter soldier who is hiding behind an upturned Dum-E. Bucky says he needs his arm repaired and they help him. I can’t remember the name of this fic and I can’t find it in my bookmarks or history. I would really appreciate if someone can tell me the name.
“ God that must be fucking awful. I won’t be able to stand seeing Fury everyday.”
Tony sighed and just patted the spot next to him. They both smiled and clambered into the bed.
“ What’s the second phase.”
“ I didn’t think I grabbed him that hard.”
Peter shot him a glare, but never got to respond.
“ Relax darling, let me take care if you.”
“ Who?” Peter asked a little confused.
Came up. This time a young woman with what seems to be long brown hair.  They both submerged, only to be replaced by two more sirens this time both women one with brown hair and the other a blonde. They both went under too soon after.
Steve pulled himself up and smelled the area between Tony neck and shoulder.
Tony looked at him in disbelief. Nope he likes his parents better when they just ignored him. Yep that was so much better. He didn’t need them trying to set him up with marriage candidates.
Bucky flipped Him off, much to Clint’s utter glee.
He would rather stay with Winghead but his visit was overdue.
“ Maybe this is all a dream or a hallucination.
Steve smirked, “Not at all.”
Beck fondly rolled his eyes, “ You are on every major news network. It’s not too hard to figure out your next move.”
“I missed you,” Peter said when Wade opened the door to his apartment.
Tony glared as Pietro chuckled.
“ What’s wrong Steve? You usually are very adamant about sharing your opinion about Howard,” Clint teased.
“ Great. See you then.” Tony hung up.
Bruce was currently stitching up a cut he had on his face because he had to have fallen in the glass coffee table. That just had to happen with his fucking luck.  They both knew it was going to heal in a few hours, but it was more so for Tony’s piece of Mind.  And hopefully is back would be good around that time too.
“ Good evening.”
“ I’m so happy you noticed my personality and not just my pussy.”
“ It’s our day Bucky. You can sleep here after we are done and have him tomorrow.”
“ At sex? Nope.”
“ Hopefully it has more ups though. You’re finished all ready?! I didn’t even do a single problem. Damn I wish I could have helped.”
Bucky rolled his eyes.
“ No! Let’s play Harry!” Peter giggled.
Steve slapped Tony’s left butt cheek. “ Yeah, you like that? Want me to spank you again.”
“ Come on hes not a pup and he wanted to know how to have sex.”
“ Peter are you sure you are okay?”
Nat gave a small triumphant smile.
“ Howard! Howard! Tony’s here! Come, come. Your father is probably in the living room already. Jarvis has already set out the brunch. He put out all your favorites.”
The baby made a gurgling noise.
Peter felt himself being lifted and he wrapped his legs and arms around Wade, diving down into a kiss. He heard the door slam behind him and felt his body hit it.
“ Tony Wait.”
Steve faltered a bit. “ What?”
“ Are all monitors on mute?” Strange continued, obviously ignoring Tony.
“ So tight. How are you so tight?”
“ What the hell are you doing here? Better yet how did you get in?” Steve asked as he clambered off Tony.
Steve wasn’t getting up, let alone moving. Bucky stood over Steve for a moment, sniffing him as if to make sure he wouldn’t get back up or if he was dead. When he was satisfied he turned back to Tony.
Steve rolled his eyes. “ They can Wait.”
“ I don’t care about your orientation. I just want them to be good to you. So is it him?“
Steve got up and stretched. He was a super solider but he did get cramped up
“No one is going to think less of you just because you didn’t show up for a meeting. Hell they porbabaly won’t blame you. Any of them would leave that meeting if they were giving to option of getting a piece of ass.”
Did no one remember him?
“ Yes.”
Steve huffed and ignored the man behind him.
“ Shit,” Steve muttered and quickly pulled on a black robe and tied it  sloppily. “ Fuck me... sorry about the mess...” he hurried around and began to pick up several wine bottles from the floor.
“ So if I got a goat would that be fine?”
Tony felt the tears flowing freely down his cheeks.
“ He’s going to mount you whether you are prepared or not. He’s really a nice guy honestly, but not exactly a professional at sex.”
“ No shit Commander Obvious. It didn’t work when I tried pulling it down. “
Peter lifted his head. “ Do not!”
“ I’m sorry about this Tony. I didn’t think Clint would do something this crazy.”
Bucky purred and looked at his work as he finished placing the umpteeth flower in Tony hair ( where he got it, Tony was not entirely sure). After that little display of affection, Bucky had dragged Tony through the water and onto the island. Steve has followed close behind and when they were settled had done some strange introduction when included him wrapping his arm around him and pointing at him while his little group observed them.
Peter smiled as they kept walking to class. It was nice to have someone other than his family to place so much confidence in him.
“ What the hell did you do Tony?” Clint snapped as he rubbed his jaw. Steve had elbowed him as he made an attempt to go after his doppelgänger.
Steve covered his mouth with his own, temporarily muffling his cries and moans.
“ That’s good. Maybe you can teach me a thing or two.”
Winghead was pretty good. He didn’t bite or claw of Bruce. He whimpered and squirmed  a bit when Bruce had to take some blood but other than that he was a perfect angel.
“ Quentin,” Peter whined, “ Hurry up. I’m horny.”
“ Sorry baby girl. We gotta run.”
Peter tilt his head and squinted his eyes, as if he were studying him. Then he straightened  up and smiled.  “ This is boring I want to play.” He then grinders his hips into Harry’s.
Steve looked down at him and smiled. “ Did it?”
“ Clint is right,” Sam piped up as he took an ice pack from Bruce and placed it over his eye. “ Maybe Tony Just needs to sleep with them.”
Winghead grunted and submerged himself under  the water.
“ Well isn’t that the biggest load of bull shit I ever heard.”
“ No!” Peter pulled his other leg out of Harry’s reach.
“ Charm had nothing to do with it. Just a couple of American dollars,” Howard snorted.
There was a knock and one of the guards opens the Door. Tony looked up. He gulped when he saw the Slave-master.
“ Think about it Bucky, is this worth sleeping on the couch?” Clint teased.
Please let me know how you like the story:)!
Steve looked up questioningly as the huge machine kneeled next to iron man.the man put his hands on his face plate and tore it off.
He look sheepish as if he didn’t mean to say that out loud.
“ You’re an idiot.”
“ I’m fine mama. And I could really dress myself.”
“ Its Fine. How about you? Been here very long?”
He grasped Grants erection behind him and rubbed it against his hole. “ This is here you are going to be going.” Grant groaned and threw his head back. Tony places a soft kiss on his lips.
“ Yeah you don’t have to talk to fuck me.”
“ Yeah fucking right now hands up,” he growled.
“ Well thy asshole from the 40th floor was there and I didn’t feel
Tony cried and panted as he gripped Steve’s hair and clutched his head with his legs. Steve would die a happy man if he suffocated like that. It didn’t take long before Tony came.
“ He just said that it was important and we need to meet right away.” Bruce supplied. Natasha just rolled her eyes at Clint’s obvious displeasure.
Steve sighed and went back looking out the window.
Peter gave an exasperated sigh and threw his head back.
Grant glared back at him. “ Really? Because it smells like shit.”
Tony sighed. He wished he felt that one in his own universe.
“ Does he have anything?”
Hydra Steve relaxed. “ Ok. You’re right. Sorry about that Tony.” Steve told Tony he was right and apologized? This guy was from a different universe.
Winghead then made a series of rapid clicking noises at Strange.
“ I’m calling 911.” Grant had his phone out, not to far away from the tub.
Hi everyone! Thanks for reading so far. I’m going to be busy real soon and I don’t know when I’ll be able to update so I wanted to post this chapter before that happens. I am looking forward to reading your comments! Thanks!
This was to unreal. It is final, he will quit coffee. He drank too much of the shit anyway. Maybe it was time to cut back. Yeah... that sounded good. That was a great idea.
Tony just turned his head and smiled at him sweetly.
“ Let’s see about that smart ass.” Steve retorted back as he tried to charge forward again, Clint, Nat and Sam struggling to reel him in.
Rhodey motioned him to sit on the couch and got them both two cokes.
“ what Spider-Man?” Harry thought confused. Then he looked at his hand. “Wait, you’re Spider-Man?”
Tony whined when Steve presses his prostrate hard.
Grant had settled himself against the head of the bed and watched as Tony lubed his cock and and was already lining it up with his backside. He carefully lowered himself. He was a lot bigger that he could have imagined. He closed his eyes in concentration and kept slowly lowering himself until he was fully seated. Grant was panting heavily, eyes half way lidded.
“ Are you sure your grace? I can make it worth your while,” Tony said softly as he walked his fingers closer to the hem of Steve’s pants.
They all snapped their heads to the god.
“ I can see your ass with that skirt and the top is to short and see through.”
“ What is it,” Howard snapped. He did not like this deal and wanted everyone to know is displeasure. He didn’t want to sacrifice his son like a lamb for slaughter.
You are freaking wearing my Iron Man shirt.”
Grant hung his head and covered his face with his hands. He just nodded.
Steve winced. “ Please don’t call yourself that.”
“ Are you fucking kidding me Rogers. I will fucking kill you.”
“ First of those so called school children were continually harassing the Children of Mr. Rogers and Thor’s younger brother to the of physical abuse. So these so called children were not innocent and were in fact bullying the children that Team Hydra calls family. This man protected said children and stood up for them when they were to scared to come forward to their family that something inexcusable was happening to them.”
He had already taken off his shirt and was kneeling on the bed when Steve came Into the room. He smiled down at Tony. “ Hi.” He said shyly.
Peter frowned at that. “ why what’s wrong?”
“ It was a six month program and it’s helping me pay for school. I usually come here on breaks on such.”
Tony complained.
Tony didn’t know what to reply to that.
And that’s how they ended up in a hotel room two hours later after talking at the bar. Tony had kissed him like his life depended on it.
Bruce smiled and clapped his hands excitedly. “ And you had rotations right? Was one of them like family or couples therapy?”
“ Sorry to break it to you Pete, no sends a half naked pic with the idea of just doing chem homework or a tutoring section. Ha e you ever watch porn. It never ends with them doing chem homework.”
“ Wild you two calm down? What’s the matter with you?”
Tony groaned as he let his head fall to hit the table. Why couldn’t he just have a normal life?
“ You First, jerk.”
Clint was perched high up in the corner laughing. Steve glared at him. This was not funny. He was so close to having Tony in his bed. They were more than likely going to have sex and it would have been awesome. Tony looked sexy as hell and he seemed very into it. Like he was into it right? He did asked for him to take him to his bed.
Natasha rolled her eyes. “ I think you know the answer Clint. I’m pretty sure you were the one that helped him last night.”
“ I’m not eating that,” Tony told him.
He said he couldn’t believe it and then walked out of the house. I thought it was over but then he came back a couple days later. He was waiting in the kitchen eating cereal. He told me to pack my bags and that if I didn’t listen my sister would be lynched.
Grant smirked and kneeled in front of Tony. He roughly pulled down his pants and underwear and grabbed a hold of his cock. He began to stroke it as he looked up at Tony.
“ We are going to get in trouble. My parents are still pissed about me seeing you.”
“ You know you’re supposed to move right?”
“ You know if I didn’t know better, I would say you have a crush on me.”
“ Thank you your grace,” Tony said with a smile. He probably looked genuine, but  it was far from it. He could thank his upbringing in the public eye for that.
“ Yeah. You can thank Hydra for that.”
“ Tony, I actually enjoy hanging out with you.”
“ What the hell? Barnes it’s me, Tony.” Tony said as he motioned to himself.
Tony panted as he grinded On the thing below him. He classified him as a thing as he wasn’t human, vampires were definitely not human mind you, and he was currently being a bigger pain in the ass as usually. Both figuratively and literally speaking.
“ Ya know,” Steve shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly.
Tony rolled his eyes.
He was pulled onto Steve’s lap much like he had sat on Santa’s lap when he was five.
“ You never change.” Steve as finally looking at him. He looked young when he smiled. So carefree.
“ No, it’s because he wants you to be his future son in law,” Sam retorted.
Harry pushed himself off of him and began to crawl down his body, leaving kisses along the way. He briefly stopped at his belly button and swirled his tongue around in it until Peter squirmed and whined.
Steve looked at him hopefully as he waited for an answer.
“ So, I am going to ask Grant what he thinks of this. Please try not to interrupt. Ok? Grant how do you feel from what Tony is telling you?”
Steve gave him an affronted look. “ No! She’s like my little sister. I couldn’t do that.”
Tony eyes snapped open. He was still in his stomach and he looked up. The room was no longer white but looked a lot like his cabin. And there was Howard in the fore front of the Rag tag group of super heroes who seem to be waking up from some type of nap, glaring at him.
Somehow in that little cyborg Brain of his, it translated to that he needed to somehow help with this mission and he invited himself along. It was pretty annoying. It was supposed to be a week long recon mission with just a small group but it became a giant pin in the ass. The whole mission he wouldn’t shut up and he kept trying to impress me I guess with the Strategies he came up with and all the freaking war stories he had. The asshole even went as far as leaving his damn post one night to buy me flowers and like a breakfast wrap for the Morning and we had almost missed our target moved. It was a nightmare.
“ I prefer Skeletor,” Clint faked whispered.
“ He was just a business man. Not much for violence. I was the one that was Iron Man. The one and only Iron Man.”
“Did you get Tony’s food?”
“ Tony I’m sorry.”
Steve gave him a questioningly look. “ Don’t just push it in there! You need to prepare me. Are you nuts? I’ll tear! Bucky open that draw and give me the blue bottle. Yep, that one,”
“ What do you mean it’s not decent? It was pretty fucking decent for you 30 minutes ago.” Tony growled. He looked pissed and if he wanted to murder Steve. “ And why shouldn’t I be dressed like this? I only dressed like this besucase I thought you would like it.”
“ Steve it’s alright. I know this must seem weird but you don’t have to pretend for my benefit.”
Clint started to laugh again.
Tony glared at him but stopped talking. All the while Commander Hydra lurked in the background arms crossed over his massive chest, glaring a Quentin. He would be lying if he has said he wasn’t scared.
“ What now?” Tony asked exasperated.
“ Don’t you dare,” Bucky Warned Greg.
Steve chuckled, “ I’m guessing you like it?”
“ Ok, school is important whatever. I get it. Now are you going to help me with my homework? Please I’m begging. Like is there like some rule you have to help me since you’re like banging my dad?”
“ Well he has a lot of PR to do. He really fucked up his image. I mean he did threaten a DA for your ass.”
Tony just shrugged. “ Suit yourself. I’m hungry, take me out to eat.”
“ But your grace,” Phil started again. “ He’s not trained as a support companion.”
“Sorry about them. They are a bit much.” Steve apologized.
Steve’s expression darken and if he hasn’t been so pissed he would have been scared.
He loved it when he did that.
“ Honey don’t cry,” Tony said. “ I didn’t know he meant so much to you. I would want you to have to choose.”
“ how about I give you some of mine? Maybe it will be more comfortable.”
“ What the fuck?” He moaned.
“ I thought you were going to tell me when you were ready.”
“ I hope they kick your ass if you say that,” Tony huffed.
Tony was back in the living room when he heard the elevator ding. He had been sitting on the couch, a photo album in his hands, trying to piece together the life of the other Tony Stark. He looked up and saw Steve.
But he won’t treat Tony like that. He was going to treat him like a king. He wasn’t going to mess this up. He was going to be his knight in shining armor.
“ Is there some place private we can go?”
“ How do you know?”
“ Yeah right after Captain America shoved his boot up my ass right?”
“ Honey , excuse me  for being vulgar but you have a nice pussy and a charming personality.”
“ So is this like a cute nickname just like you do with the other me?”
“ How?”
Grant was happy to oblige. Tony came with a silent scream and went limp in the arms holding him. Grant continued to assault his limp body until he came with a groan. Steve came on his back, dropping his head forward in Tony’s shoulder. Tony lifted his head and smiled, “ It’s your turn Steve.”
Tony just rolled his eyes. Howard was always so nosy.
“ I’ll be there in five.”
“ Always such a greedy little creature. Can you bring the rest over here? The rest of your pod? I would like to meet them. And I promise not to hurt them. “ Bucky nodded and moved himself from Tony’s lap to headed toward the water.
“If you were trying to make this a secret meeting you are failing spectacularly.”
“So good. Such a good bitch.” Steve continued, oblivious to Tony’s plight.
“ God, Tony. You’re so tight. I’m going to fuck you. Fuck you so good. I love you, doll.”
“ New partner?”
Nat just shook her head. “ It’s fine. You needed to have been learn to behave. He can really hurt someone if he wants to.”
Winghead whined.
Strange looked up at Tony sadly. “ It never was, was it?”
“ Peter....”
Harry smiled. “ I remember. I wouldn’t forget that cute of a face. Especially a smart one.”
The elevator came to a halt as it dinged. The doors opened and he saw a familiar figure.
What a way to start a morning.
Did he expect a kiss?
“ Don’t touch me!” Tony growled.
“ Yes... god... yes...” Peter breathes out.
Peter felt his face burn when he caught himself staring to long at the muscular chest and strong abdominal muscles.
“You’re awake!” Steve said joyfully, pausing just long enough to set down a tray of food before almost tackling Tony back into bed with a hug. Tony oophed at the impact but had to grin, happy to feel Steve in his arms. “How are you feeling?” Steve took a step back but kept his hands on Tony’s shoulders, like he couldn’t bear to stop touching him, as he studied Tony critically.
“I mean it,” Steve insisted. “You were right. I wasn’t ever angry at you, I was angry at myself because of…” Steve took a fortifying swallow of wine, trying to find courage in the bottle before he handed it back. “Because of how you make me feel.” He stared at his hands, scared to look at Tony because of what he might see on his face. “You make me feel
“Right, right. But, uh, nowhere else?”
“No, you don’t understand,” Bucky said. He struggled to sit up and cursed in frustration when his weakened body betrayed him by not doing what he wanted it to. “They have to be secured. They have to be kept safe.”
“And what do you want with them? A bunch of dusty old artifacts, probably fakes no older than the Kingdom of France itself?”
“Best guess is because of this.” Natasha pulled something out of her pocket; it was a hardened bit of clay and pressed into the center was the symbol that Steve had sketched, the many-headed Hydra. “The source found this stamp hidden in Stane’s desk.”
Stane’s eyebrows lowered and he frowned. “Nothing so base, my boy. But you know what happens to the line of succession with you in the Church.”
“No, the point is that you sin in moments of weakness, then pray for God to forgive you your weakness and give you strength for next time.”
“Yeah, I’ve heard a few of the songs,” Steve said as he cut another piece of meat.
“So you trust him?” Bucky said, with an odd note in his voice.
Stark didn’t turn, but he did tilt his head in acknowledgement of Steve’s apology. “If you are insisting on this mad quest to find your friend, we will leave the day after tomorrow,” he said. “I have arrangements to make.”
“I feel like you’ve been talking to Steve,” Tony said after a moment. “Did you give him the same speech?”
Steve grunted. "He wouldn't be the first broke son of a nobleman to make his riches in the church," he said, keeping one hand on his pommel and a wary eye on the dark alleys as they passed even though lately the Captain of the City Guard had done an admiral job suppressing robbers and thieves.
“It’ll be fine,” Sister Natasha said without sympathy.  “Look at it this way – maybe you’ll get to see him naked.” And it was a measure of how upset Tony was that even the prospect of that couldn’t cheer him up.
Steve bit back a frustrated roar. “Take me to the relics, and I’ll tell you,” he gritted out, and something of his urgency must have made an impression because Natasha finally nodded and gestured for him to follow. He followed her through the stone halls of Notre Dame, past the corridors he was familiar with and down through ones he wasn’t, until they were deep inside the bowels of the church.
“I got this,” she said, inserting what looked like a long, thin needle into the lock of the door. There was a minute of tiny clicking noises as her eyebrows drew together in concentration, then the lock finally popped open.
First
“No, I don’t.” Steve raked his fingers through his hair and sat down for just a moment before he was up again, pacing. “I’m worried that he’s in danger. That we all are.” His armor and sword were carefully hidden in the cart they’d borrowed from Anna and Edwin, but that had likely been taken to the stables and the attendants had already told them they weren’t allowed out of the room on Lord Stark’s orders. Escape was out of the question without Tony, and Steve knew that if he tried to barge in and save him there was a strong chance he would mess up some intricate plan Tony had in motion. As much as it pained him, their only option was to stay put and try not to attract any attention.
, he thought again. Maybe Bucky would be able to envision a happy ending better than Steve could.
“The message I have for him is urgent,” Steve growled, taking a step forward so that he was looming over the young man.
“Thank you for accepting my invitation,” Stark said, standing to greet him as he entered, waving a hand towards a chair that had been set up on the other side of a heavily ladened table.  “I’m glad you came.”
“Not quite. Think you can hold me on your shoulders?”
"No matter how much they would like you to think it, the Church is not synonymous with God." Bucky shifted and hissed with pain but waved Steve away when he moved to help. “The Church is made up of men, and they are as fallible as you and I. Don’t listen to a bunch of fusty old men about what God thinks, read it for yourself.”
” Tony said, pressing a hand to his side where the laughter had caused a jab of pain. “With paint and other artistry. Like the beggars use to look more miserable.” Steve visibly relaxed, and Tony saw the gleam of the fire along his jaw as he nodded. “However, there is one thing that you need to understand that is critically important.”
Tony read it quickly then frowned and read it again. “These numbers are at least 8% higher than they were last month and a good 10% higher than other hospitals,” he said. “The bastard is skimming.”
“That was…” Tony cleared his throat. “That was a fine confession. I’m sure you were the pride of your diocese.”
“Yes, well, the king took an oath to protect and serve the people of France, people make oaths of fidelity to their spouses, and I’m sure the rutting dog makes some sort of oath to his bitch
“My child?” Tony repeated in confusion.
Tony had to work to keep his eyebrows from going up. The page had said that a meeting with Stane was what had brought his father here out of season. Why would Stane lie about something so minor? Tony rubbed his eyes and thought furiously. “I’m having a hard time believing that he’s gone,” he said. “I suppose I have to track down his will and start reviewing his accounts, arrange for his funeral.”
“So you’re saying Steve doesn’t know?”
,” he said, pointing at the thick carpet that covered the floor of his chambers.
“That's all very well and good, but I hope your fleshly coil appreciates my hard work as well,” she said as she sat.  She took her messenger bag off her shoulders and started pulling out stacks of paper. “Here are all the reports you requested.  You might want to take a particular look at this one,” she said as she pulled one out of the stack.
"Is it your father?"
Tony narrowed his eyes at Steve, studying his face. The question was sincere enough, but something about Steve’s tone made it seem like Tony’s inheritance was not what he was actually thinking about. “Of a sort. It will be held up in court for years while they search for another male in my family line, which buys me some time since they’re going to have to go to Italy to see if they can find someone on my mother’s side.”
be out of here.”
That surprised a laugh out of Steve. He could just imagine the face Tony would make at that. He stabbed a potato with his eating knife and offered it to Bucky. “So how did you figure it out?”
"Not if everyone thinks
he'd told Steve in a fit of hurt anger. Now, not even two days later he was talking like there was some kind of future where they were still on speaking terms.
“Bucky?” He called out in confusion.  He stumbled out of bed and threw open his door, surprised to see that Bucky was fully dressed.  He glanced out the window but he hadn’t overslept, the sun wasn’t even up yet. “What-”
Steve swallowed. He felt lightheaded and realized that his breath was coming fast and shallow, so he inhaled deeply, breathing in the scent of burning candles and the more exotic perfume that always lingered on Stark’s robes, reminding Steve of his time in the Holy Land. Steve often fantasized of stripping Stark and finding the source of that perfume but had yet to have the courage. He lifted his hand, which was trembling with the force of his arousal the way it never did on the battlefield, and made the sign of the cross. “I confess to the sin of pride.”
“I don’t understand what this one man has to do with Bucky and the treasure,” Steve protested.  “He told me something only Bucky would know, doesn’t that mean-“
“Go in slow, get out fast,” Steve said. “Even grass is more cover than we had in the desert.” While waiting for the late hours of the night, they’d bought lighter colored cloaks and Steve showed them how to use dirt and ash to make the cloaks mottled enough to confuse the eye at a distance. They hid the horses as close as they dared then started making their way across the open expanse agonizingly slowly, hearts pounding as they jumped at every noise, expecting to be discovered any minute. But there was no outcry, and eventually they were able to take cover in the shadowed lee of one of the towers. “Ok, now what?” Steve whispered, craning his neck up to look at the window far above their heads. “Throw the grappling hook?”
“You wait for further instructions,” Thomas called back.
“When did you figure it out?”
“The grail I used when my horse came up lame with an inflamed hoof; I was miles from town and desperate because the King’s men were on my trail. And this one, the crown of thorns, I used on the man that I entrusted with the relics.” Bucky let the piece of paper fall to his lap and pushed it towards Tony, clearly growing tired. “No one of evil intent should get their hands on these,” he said emphatically. “Because with them, they could destroy the world.”
“Then he was an ass,” Steve said as Tony sat back down.
“He’ll talk,” Steve said darkly. “As scared as he might be about this Lord Stane, he’ll have more pressing problems.”
“You can’t be serious,” Stark said flatly.
“He will live if the infection does not worsen,” she said after a moment of hesitation. “But the damage to his hands and feet…they are difficult bones to set properly.”
“I was just trying to give them a leg up in life,” Tony said.  “You know, swearing is a highly respected skill-”
“Get dressed,” he ordered, shoving Steve back into his room.  “Now, I’ll explain once we leave.”
“I sent them to the Iron Cardinal. To Cardinal Stark.”
With a sigh, he sat back down next to the fire, rubbing his eyes.
“I had to, being around you when you were young,” Ana called out, flashing Tony a grin even as her hands were busy poking and prodding Barnes’ injuries.
Steve rotated the picture slowly, still studying it, and then he stopped. “Yes, actually,” he said, sounding surprised. “But this is a very poor picture. Hold on.” He got up quickly, dug through the chest of their belongings, and pulled out his sketchbook and pencils. Tony watched with interest as Steve’s hand moved quickly over the page; he'd never seen Steve draw before, and he really was very talented. Under his hands a slightly different picture emerged; what before had looked like a nest of snakes eating each other became one snake with many heads. “I saw this more than once in the Holy Lands,” he said as he passed the book over for Tony to study the picture. “Where did you see it?”
Natasha shook her head. “You should rest, or you will fall off your horse, break your neck, and will be saving no one. I will go.”
“But why would he smuggle them out of Paris, only to try to send them back to Paris?”
“What,” he ground out, still looking straight ahead.
“Now wait just a minute-“
“Have you decided where we will go?" Steve stroked the horse's jaw to have something to do with his hands. "Ana mentioned Chateau d’Angers, but that’s where your father is, right?”
“Well done.” Stark moved away for a moment and when he returned, he set a wide, flat pillow on the floor in front of Steve. It was a prayer pillow, and Steve started to move to kneel on it when Stark stopped him with a hand on his shoulder. The hand slid from his shoulder to the nape of his neck, spreading heat in its wake, and then there was pressure, forcing Steve’s head down. “Now it’s time for you to prostrate yourself before your Lord,” Stark ordered, voice low and rough, and Steve shuddered as he obeyed, resting his forehead and hands on the pillow. He felt exposed and vulnerable in the chill, dim air of Stark’s chambers, naked and achingly hard; he imagined he must look like some sort of pagan offering presented for Stark’s pleasure. He closed his eyes and his hands closed into fists as the thought made heat flare under his skin. “Before we begin, do you swear that you are giving yourself willingly, and with your whole heart?” Stark asked.
Steve felt a stab of fear around the squirmy feeling of shame in his chest. “What do you mean?”
Steve stared blankly, unsure of what to say. Tony seemed surprised too, but recovered faster. “Hassam, your courage humbles me, but even if we were planning to track down this organization – which we aren’t,” which was true, for now at least, because Bucky was the priority, “this isn’t your fight. We don’t even know if this is truly the Hydra.”
Tony was still shaking his head in disagreement. “Steve wants to fight me, maybe, but not fuck me. He’s made it pretty clear that I represent everything he hates about Church venality and hypocrisy. You should have seen the look on his face when I surprised him at the monastery.”
He didn’t realize he was frowning until Brother Thibault leaned over and said, “Are you feeling well, Brother Grant?”
Tony's bitter heart wanted to say, but he knew that growing up without a father wasn't easy either.
He would say, sitting up and baring his chest as the sheets slid down to pool at his hips.
“Oh, is that who that picture was supposed to be?" Tony said lightly. "It’s a terrible likeness.”
“Give thanks to the Lord for He is good,” Stark said when Steve was finished. If there was any part of this that Steve regretted, it was this part, the part where the chasm between them yawned vast and deep and Stark seemed far away and unreachable. Steve wanted to bridge the distance and press a kiss to that wry, clever mouth, to taste that sharp tongue, but feared that if he crossed the boundaries of what they’d drawn for themselves, he’d lose everything, and that terrified him more than any armed and angry Saracen.
When Steve came in from the stable, he saw Tony in a dark corner of the tavern speaking to the innkeeper. As he watched, Tony pulled something out of his pocket that gleamed briefly of gold before it disappeared again. After seeing it, the innkeeper nodded and leaned in close as he spoke, clearly trying to keep someone from overhearing what he was saying. Tony’s eyebrows drew together in concentration and he nodded periodically as he listened. When the innkeeper finally pulled back, Tony shook his hand and passed over a coin, which disappeared into the innkeeper’s pockets. Then to Steve’s surprise, they spoke again for another few minutes and money changed hands again before Tony finally made his way through the crowded room over to where Steve was sitting.
Steve had never ridden this hard for so long in his life, not even in the desperate dash to get Bucky to safety. His world narrowed to the rhythm of the horse’s hooves, the hypnotic rush of its breathing, the beaten dirt road framed by its ears. His back and thighs ached, hands blistering from the reins; each time he switched horses, it was harder and harder to get back on as his muscles protested the abuse. But every time he sat down for a moment as he changed horses, when he accepted food and water that was pressed into his hands at each stop, he saw Tony’s face, its waxy paleness and sunken cheeks, and was driven back to his feet.
In the bedroom and out of Tony’s sight, Steve raked his hands through his too-long hair, suddenly realizing that they were shaking. He was still shocked by his own daring at saying the words aloud but also by how good it felt. It felt like he’d been at confession, like pulling out a splinter or lancing a wound. He felt lighter, freer, and, despite everything, was struck by the sudden urge to laugh.
“That’s what I concluded as well,” she said.  “I already have a few replacements in mind if you like.”
“Because of the power of the artifacts?” Steve asked with confusion. Among the artifacts was a sliver of the True Cross, some of Saint Peters’ bones, the Holy Spear, and a cup that was allegedly the grail that Jesus drank from at the Last Supper; it was rumored that these artifacts had miraculous powers, which was why the Templars always kept them under lock and key, lest they fall into the wrong hands.
“Huh.” Tony lay back to stare at the ceiling. His breath was ragged and labored, whistling in and out of his lungs. “What if it doesn’t work all the time? For everybody?”
Steve just snorted and leaned over the desk to give Tony a thorough kiss. “You scare me sometimes,” he said with a smile.
“Who is Stane?” Steve suddenly said from the doorway, making Tony jump. The look on his face was grim and his hands were curled into fists at his sides. “And where do I find him?”
Bucky bowed over Stark’s hand, brushing his lips respectfully across Stark’s ring of office. “Since we were children,” he said. “We joined the Order together and have been to hell and back. He’s like a brother to me.”
Tony concentrated and after a moment he realized what he was talking about. “Sounds like fighting,” Tony said. “And not far away.”
“We’re getting you out of here, Buck,” Steve said grimly, and put the iron crow against the rings holding the shackles to the wall. Tony stooped to calm Barnes while Steve snarled with effort above him, knuckles white on the pry bar until the ring finally snapped and Barnes’s hands dropped to the floor. He cried out with pain at the movement and Steve flinched.
“No,” Steve said finally.  “Oaths aren’t meaningless.  Like faith, and hope, and love, they have as much meaning as you give them.”
Something inside Steve squirmed with humiliation and excitement. “There – I hear there are ways, for a man to lay with a man as he does with a woman. That it can bring pleasure. So I have imagined what it would be like to do that with – with this man.”
Steve moaned, stifling the noise in his fist, and his hand moved faster. His skin was on fire, prickling with the need to be touched. In his mind, Tony murmured
Steve frowned. “I’m sure I don’t…” But then he realized what Bucky meant. A social gathering held by Cardinal Stark would likely have all the most important people of Paris there, and fortunes had been made and broken at such dinners. Bucky would have been on the fringes of such events as the Grand Master’s aide de camp, but this event would effectively thrust him into center stage. “I’m not sure how much help I’ll be, but I’ll do my best,” he said finally. “I’d rather face a hundred Saracens in battle than have dinner with a dozen nobles.”
Tony wondered. Given everything, Tony had a hard time believing that Stane’s presence here was only about getting his hands on the duchy. “Is that why you were meeting with my father?” Tony asked idly, taking a sip of wine and then cradling the glass carelessly in his fingers. “Trying to get me disinherited?”
“So you didn’t know?” Steve slumped forward in relief, burying his head in his hands.  That had been plaguing him his whole ride; if he’d been wrong about Stark, he could have been riding right into a trap.
“Yes, I see,” Stark said after a few moments. He put his hand on Steve’s shoulder and squeezed. “You may stop.”
Steve stopped him as he was starting to mount. “What about you? Where are you going?”
“I thought Brother Peter was your assistant?”
“He was building a prison cell,” Steve said. The man shrugged and ducked his head;
“You were expecting me?” Tony said with a frown. The bad feeling grew, turning into a rock in the pit of his stomach.
"What about the relics?"
“Probably the root cellar, I can’t see him giving up his wine cellar,” Tony said musingly, eyes distant. The man fidgeted at the table for a little while Tony thought, and finally Tony’s gaze refocused on the man. “You can go. Thank you.”
“Until now,” Stark echoed. “You’re just one fugitive Templar Knight, and normally Phillip could be convinced to look the other way, but…”
“Send him south,” Natasha said without hesitation, echoing Tony’s thoughts. “Though he should have been gone weeks ago, when he first got here.”
“He’s breathing easier,” Natasha finally said with relief, shoulders slumping. She reached over and smoothed a hand over Tony’s hair, growing out again from where he’d cut it short all those days ago.
“It’s time,” Tony said as Steve sat down. “Everything is in place.”
“Yes, Your Grace,” Steve said, swallowing thickly as his heart kicked in his chest. He couldn’t look away from the thin, unassuming length of braided leather, heart racing and mouth dry with want. He dragged his gaze away from it to look up at Stark, whose eyes were dark and heavy-lidded as he studied Steve, gaze lingering on the hardness between his legs. “It’s a whip,” Steve managed with difficulty; words seemed thick and hard to find. “For- for the mortification of the flesh.”
To his surprise, Stark opened the door almost immediately after he rapped on it urgently. “Rodgers? What in God’s name are you doing here this time of day?”  To his surprise, Stark seemed alert and wide awake, as if Steve hadn’t dragged him from his bed
Eventually, inevitably, Edwin’s horse brought them to the gates of Tony's manor, its thick walls and crenelated towers reflecting in the broad waters of the river Maine.  Few in the city spared them a glance as they wound their way through the city and up to the gates of the Chateau. “I am Lord Antoine Stark,” Tony said when the manor guards stopped them. “I am here to see my father.” The guards, recognizing him despite the cassock, waved them through without comment. Strangely, the one on the left gave him a sympathetic look as they passed, which made Tony's eyebrows draw together as he urged the horse forward, suddenly getting a bad feeling unrelated to the general dread of seeing his father.  As he drove up to the front door of the main house a groom came up to take the reins; he absently ordered the man to take the cart, along with Steve and Barnes, around to the chapel that also served as the infirmary as he climbed the stairs to the front door.
Tony trotted up to Natasha, recognizing her despite her disguise mostly because she was riding Friday, Tony’s favorite horse. Tony put a hand on Friday’s halter and despite his worry, smiled when the horse bumped him with her nose and snorted, recognizing his scent.
The unexpected question broke Tony's resentful reverie. "No," he said slowly. He had never thought about it, but the Iron Cardinal had grown out of an impulse entirely unrelated to his father. "No, that was...an accident, really."
Steve made a noise of agreement at that, stirring his bowl idly. Pieces of fruit would emerge briefly before sinking back into the porridge, and to Steve’s tired mind it seemed like a good metaphor for Tony, how Steve could get glimpses of the person he was beneath all the masks before he disappeared again. He desperately wanted to get to know Tony, to understand him, but he felt the chance to slipping from his fingers; once at Chateau d’Angers, Tony would become Lord Stark, farther from Steve’s reach than even Cardinal Stark was. And what help could he offer Tony to find the relics, other than caring for Bucky until he could wake up and tell them where they were? Steve sighed and pushed the thoughts away, setting himself to eating though he had little appetite. He finished his bowl of porridge as quickly as possible and stood. “I’ll take him breakfast so it doesn’t get cold,” he offered, refilling his bowl for Tony.
“Sanctimonious?” Bucky suggested. “Pompous?”
“We know your friend went south and west when he left Paris, but he never showed up at Castile,” Stark repeated. “I’m hoping he found a safe place to hole up and wait out the storm. Did he mention anywhere else he could have gone?"
Sam nodded. “I was told to speak to someone known as the Iron Cardinal, have you heard of him?”
“Me? What about you?”
“You must not have gotten very far into the collection then. Not all of those books are, shall we say, church-sanctioned.” Tony wrapped up the rest of the bread and stood, brushing crumbs off his robe. He started to climb into the wagon but when he saw Steve staring at him, aghast, he laughed. “I’m joking,” he said. “Even I’m not that much of a reprobate. Novitiates have access to that library.” Relieved, Steve took the last bite of bread and was just about to swallow when Tony flashed him a wicked grin and said, “I keep
“Of course.” Steve was still smiling at him, eyes roving over his face like he thought he’d never see Tony again; which was fair, Tony reflected. He hadn’t thought he would see Steve – or anyone – again either. One of Steve’s hands came up to cup Tony’s cheek, and Tony leaned his face into the touch.
“Good morning, Cardinal Stark,” Bucky said when he was finished, eyeing Tony’s muted clothing. He looked neither like a cardinal nor a member of the peerage today, wearing plain if well-spun clothing and carrying a tray of food like a common footman.
Steve inhaled sharply, feeling cut to the bone, flayed open and exposed. Tony
“He’s hitching up our cart to take you and your friend to Chateau d’Angers.” She sat back in her chair while Edwin passed out bowls and spooned porridge in them, then set out dried fruit and honey on the table before sitting down as well. "I checked in on you both while you were sleeping and I told Lord Antoine that I thought your friend is well enough to move on. As long as you don't force him atop a horse again."
“Well?” Tony said after they had been studying the castle for a while. “Got any ideas?” This was clearly going to be one of the hardest parts because they risked being spotted by sharp-eyed night watchman and would be vulnerable to archer fire.
Steve drained his cup of wine and set it down heavily on the wooden table, scowling at Bucky.  “I hate arguing with you.”
Tony’s mouth went dry and he inhaled sharply as all of his blood rushed south, a wave of heat flashing through his veins. He knew well how long it had been since Steve's last
“Stark, I’m sorry,” Steve said, catching his sleeve before he opened the door. “That was uncalled for. You’ve been nothing but kind to me, and I have repaid you with churlishness.”
“Because do you want to know what
“What about you?” Steve said.  “If they suspect you are hiding me, and suddenly I vanish, won’t you be in trouble as well?” Stark stared at him as if that hadn’t occurred to him, then he started swearing so profusely that even Steve, a battle-tested warrior, felt his ears burning.  “I’m sorry,” he said inadequately as he realized the scope of the problems he’d made for Stark by just being here, not to mention this latest act of foolishness.
Steve and Bucky bowed in thanks and moved aside to make room for other guests who were waiting to be announced. “Well, this hardly looks like a den of iniquity,” Bucky said under his breath as they took a glass of wine from the servant. Among other discrete display of Stark’s riches, the room was tastefully appointed with intricate tapestries to keep out the cold and an impressive triptych on the wall displaying scenes from the life of Christ. “As orgy rooms go, I’m fairly disappointed.”
"Obscenely wealthy sinner," Tony amended. "Look at it this way - maybe your virtuousness will cancel out my sinful nature. Hey, that could be a good project for you," Tony said brightly. "While we're traveling you can try to save my soul."
“Tony,” Steve said softly. “Enough. Tell me what’s going on.”
just yet - the steward produced a basin and a pitcher of cool water. Tony gratefully washed his face and hands, raking his hands through his hair before drying them on a towel. He changed out of the black robes, aware that he was fortunate that Stane hadn’t noticed or cared enough to ask why he was wearing them. He hesitated for a moment over his scarlet robes of office or clothes befitting the son of a Duke – he needed to wear the best armor for the battle ahead of him, but he just realized he had no idea why Stane had been here with his father in the first place. He wished wryly for Steve’s chain mail and shield before settling on the rich linens and silks of a nobleman’s tunic and pants. With a sigh, he started to wave away the assistance of Howard’s page, a young boy that looked vaguely familiar, before a thought occurred to him.
“Wait,” he said. His voice was tight with concern, but all he said as he climbed out of the wagon was, “I think I know who this is. Let me talk to them first.”
Steve took that for the dismissal it was and returned to the house. Bucky barely stirred as Steve and Edwin lifted him and put him as gently as they could in the back of the cart, trying to take care not to jostle his injuries. He looked so small laying there, Steve thought with dismay. So fragile.
“Good idea,” Bucky said.  They were in the stables where Bucky already had horses bridled and ready. “They probably won’t think to look for you with him. Keep your head down and don’t trust anyone until I come for you, ok?  We’ll let the first of the flames die down and then we’ll figure out where to go.”
“You mean my life or the relics?” Tony gritted out. “Of course we have a deal.” He held out his hand for the pill but Stane put it back in the bag instead.
“Do you still-” Tony started at the same time that Steve said, “You said that-” and they both stopped with a huff of laughter. “You first,” Tony said.
“We will be safer when we can get to my home. When Barnes can be moved, we will get a wagon and take him the rest of the way.” Tony eyed Steve critically and realized that Edwin was right; Steve looked like he was dead on his feet and Tony probably looked just as bad, but he knew neither of them would be able to sleep until they had news about Barnes. “Come. I’ll get us something to eat and then we’ll stay out of Ana’s way so she’s not tempted to throw us in the soup pot as well.”
“Because of the power of
“So you tried them?” Tony said, brows furrowed. “You used them and found out what they could do?”
“Was your decision to become a priest part of this pulling away?” he asked. “Did you do it to spite him?”
“You’re going to be fine,” James said. “I’m sure Steve is racing hell for leather to get back to you so you can make the beast with two backs and live happily ever after.”
“Perhaps that’s why they study the stars so much,” Tony said musingly. “You know, the Muslims come up with some very interesting tables about how to predict the movements of the stars through the sky, and how to use them to navigate. I imagine it will revolutionize map-making and navigation.”
He was so lost in thought he didn’t see Natasha’s eyebrows go up when he said ‘Steve.’ “That’s what they’re saying,” she said slowly. “We’ve been passing around a likeness from Rodgers’ sketchbook and got a few positive identifications. Also, here are the reports from Sister Virginia, on your legal businesses, here’s the report from Brother Scott on your illegal businesses, and a letter from Captain Rhodes.” As Tony skimmed through the sheaf of papers she’d handed him, Sister Natasha swung her legs, looking like a young girl. “So, you going to tell me more about what’s going on with you and
“To be honest, I’m not entirely sure what’s really going on,” Tony admitted as he helped Ana set the table for dinner. “There’s a lot of rumors and speculation, but all we know for certain is that Stane is involved, and he seems to be after some relics that the Templars brought back from the Holy Land. Relics that were last seen leaving Paris in the hands of the man currently lying on the bed in there.”
“Fine,” Steve said grudgingly, trying to put Cardinal Stark from his thoughts. Back at the Tower, Steve followed Bucky back to the Grandmaster’s office to report on his meeting with Cardinal Stark.  He was given new instructions then dismissed, but when he returned to his chambers he was too restless to read or meditate, so he collected his sketchbook and some charcoal pencils and went for a walk.  There was a park along the Seine that had beautiful flowering trees this time of year, so Steve set his feet in that direction and tried to clear his thoughts.  It worked, for the most part, until he caught a glimpse of a profile that seemed familiar crossing the street.
Tony leaned forward as well, eyes steady on Stane's, refusing to be cowed. “If your information was any good, you would know that Sir Steve Rogers despises me. Given the number of times he’s told me I’m going to Hell, I doubt he would come to me for help.”
“Nothing,” Steve said tightly. He’d thought that he was over this, but now that he was back in the same room as Tony it was clear that the run had accomplished little, other than making him sweaty and his legs sore; he was just as irritated and nervous as he’d been an hour ago. He couldn’t help glancing at the bed, expecting a mess, but apparently Tony had tidied after his assignation.
“Isn’t this place cozy,” he said as he glanced around Steve’s cell, making Steve smile faintly. “How’ve you been?”
The rode for a good part of the day before the wagon stopped in front of a modest monastery, where Steve could see men in coarse brown robes were tending a thriving garden.  After a moment he realized that their robes were a match for his, and he realized this was his stop.  At Thomas’s eloquent head nod towards the simple brick building set off the road a ways, Steve gathered his few belongings and climbed down off the wagon.
By the time Tony had packed the trunk and was ready to leave in the morning, he could see Rodgers was already leading the horse out to hitch it to the wagon. Tony held the horse’s head as Rodgers fastened the straps of the harness, trying to figure out how to apologize for teasing him last night. “Steve,” he started, but lost his courage when Steve looked up at him, blue eyes remote. “Do you want breakfast?” he said instead.
Hydra.” He handed the book back to Steve. “In Baghdad they are a well known as a group of thugs and assassins.”
“Is that a problem?” Steve said with a frown.
“You are a Godsend.  Today’s also the day to-“
Tony frowned as he folded the papers and set them aside. “What do you mean?” he asked as he handed over the instructions and information that he’d prepared for Sister Virginia and Captain Rhodes. He also pulled out a sheet of parchment and quickly wrote out the information that he’d gotten from the innkeeper for Natasha to take back with her for analysis.
“Blessed be this man, whom God has called to be more closely united to himself,” Stark murmured, as if to himself, as he ran his hands over Steve’s body; his hands skimmed over the sensitive skin of his inner thighs and grazed Steve’s balls, making his cock jump, but instead of lingering Stark’s hands moved on, squeezing his ass cheeks as his thumbs dipped into the crease between them in a breathtaking tease that made Steve tremble. “Consecration is call to greater fervor for he who gives the grace of virginity,” Stark continued. His gown brushed the back of Steve’s thighs as he ran his hands up Steve’s back then raked his fingers back down, stripes of stinging sensation that made Steve release his held breath with a shuddering moan.
“No, you don’t understand.” Bucky fell back against the sheets with exhaustion, eyes burning with intensity. “The relics are real. They have power.”
“Now, tell me what you are here for,” Stark ordered, and Steve closed his eyes, skin breaking out in chill bumps as fear and nerves fueled the flames of his arousal.
“Distilled?” Tony repeated. “Using al-Kindi’s method?”
“I don’t…”
Tony nodded, relieved. He pulled a note out of his pocket, sealed with a spot of gold wax and a thumbprint. “Go to Notre Dame in Paris and give this to a monk there named Brother Scott. He will give you further instructions.” He held out his hand. “Safe travels, and I hope we meet again soon.”
“Bucky?” Steve turned from where he had been staring out of the window of the infirmary and sat down on the edge of Bucky’s bed. “I’m here. How are you feeling?”
“Fine,” Steve said, relenting. He sat down on one of the empty beds sullenly, aware of Bucky’s eyes on him.
“Believe me, that wasn’t my first plan. But I ran out of options and had some villains closing in on me, so I took the risk that he was the criminal with the heart of gold that all the songs made him out to be.” Bucky was in the middle of a bite of roasted barley when his eyes flew up to Steve’s. “Wait. He does have the relics, doesn’t he?”
“How much farther?”
“As you wish,” Tony said. He stroked the leather over Steve’s cheek and jaw, then let it unfurl against the bare skin of Steve’s chest, the chill of it making goosebumps race across his skin. “Then it is time for you to confess your sins.”
. If you behave as anything other than a man on the edge of death, we are all doomed.” His worst fear was that Steve would hear about the poisoning and attack Stane, which would ruin everything. “Understand?”
“Who is Sister Natasha?” Steve asked, recognizing the name, as Stark returned and sat down across the desk.
"No," Tony said, smiling slowly. He was starting to get a feeling about Steve's intentions.
“Well?” Tony asked under his breath as he approached.  “What’s the verdict?”
Tony looked confused by the question. “If I didn’t pay them, why would they bother-”
friend?”
“I am plagued by the – by lustful thoughts,” Steve forced out, turning his gaze to the hem of Stark’s gown so he wouldn’t lose his nerve. He’d managed to stay away for three days since the last time he’d felt Stark’s hands on him, scared both of what he wanted and how much he wanted it, but like a moth to flame he found himself here again, vibrating with need. “I fear I might be cursed,” he added in a low voice, because truly his hunger alarmed him sometimes, with what he was willing to risk to keep coming here.
“Ana and Edwin were my family’s butler and housekeeper when I was growing up,” Tony explained. “They practically raised me. When they retired, I built them this home.”
“I see,” Stark said when Steve finished. A finger stroked down Steve’s spine, from his nape to the small of his back, then dipped into the valley between Steve’s cheeks, making him tense up and tremble with forbidden excitement. “You think of what it would feel like to be mounted as a stallion does a mare,” Stark breathed into Steve’s ear, as the finger stroked up and down the top of the crease of Steve’s without venturing farther, a cruel tease that made Steve feel strangely empty. The touch and the promise in his voice made Steve’s heart race even faster, his breathing ragged. “Is that right?” Steve nodded, completely unable to find words at that moment, and felt Stark take a step back. “Well, now that I understand the severity of this sin, I have decided on your penance. Are you ready?”
“Tony,” Sister Virginia said repressively.
hydra,” he said. “
It turned out that Hassam was a merchant that had been attacked on his way to the town that Steve and Tony just left. Steve tied up the would-be bandits and rode them back to the town to wait for the bailiff while Tony agreed to help Sam relocate his horse and wagon. They found the wagon a little further down the road, mired in mud from where the horse fled from the fighting. Freeing the wagon was muddy, miserable work; whatever Hassam was transporting, it was in heavy barrels and by the time the wagon was light enough to get out of the mud they were both filthy and exhausted and the sun was low in the sky. When they were done, Tony sat down on the grass and leaned against one of the barrels, groaning as his thighs and back complained from the unusual labor. Sam followed, sighing with relief as he sat.
From the door of the tavern, Tony watched, baffled, as Steve left town at a steady jog, dodging the remaining townsfolk as they wrapped up their day. Shaking his head at Steve's strange behavior, he went up to their room to prepare for his contact's arrival, having arranged to meet them here this evening before ever having left Paris. He emptied the chest full of his and Steve's belongings and opened up the false bottom, pulling out his official ledger, his unofficial ledger, and the journal with all of the reports that came in from Sister Natasha's spy network. The sky was starting to edge towards dusk, the scene outside of the window getting smudged with growing shadows, when he heard a distinctive bird call.
“Well, word is that he spent a lot of time suggesting that perhaps the Templars’ relics really ought to belong to the King. Perhaps even suggested how the King could get his hands on them and rid himself of some crippling debts in the process.”
“So instead of the soldiers looting,
Despite everything, Tony had to smile at the way the request
“Did my father tell you why he had come here?” He asked as he let the page dress him.
Steve’s steps stuttered as he realized he was getting hard. He squeezed his eyes shut as he tried to continue with the Lord’s Prayer, but his mind and body had other plans; no matter how much he pressed the palms of his hands to his eyes, he couldn’t erase the images of Tony’s body, sweaty and flushed, moving against that of a faceless stranger.  How he would look in the throes of passion, head thrown back, eyes dark with pleasure.
As Steve told his story, he realized that for the first time he was the sole focus of Stark’s not inconsiderable intellect; he was reminded of what Bucky had said the first time he’d come back from a meeting with the Cardinal complaining of his impiety. “Stark must be smarter than he lets on, though, for him to be able to reach such a high rank in the Church and then keep it,” he had pointed out, and at the time Steve had known little enough about the cutthroat politics of Paris that he didn’t put too much weight into Bucky’s words.  Now, though, Steve got a sense of what Bucky meant.  He’d barely finished talking when Stark had pulled out sheets of paper and started writing, pen flying over the page as he reached over to pull a cord on the wall next to his desk.   It was only a few minutes before his assistant Brother Peter appeared, slightly breathless from hurrying up the stairs.
“Go tour your estates and have him masquerade as your coachman,” Sister Virginia suggested. Both Tony and Sister Natasha had to smother a laugh at the thought of Rodgers, with unmistakable military bearing and his shoulders that could barely fit up the narrow, winding staircases of the cathedral, acting as a lowly coachman. “Or a driver, what have you,” Sister Virgina said, rolling her eyes at their stifled hilarity. “You know what I mean.”
“Stop it, Steve,” he muttered to himself, and started reciting the Lord’s Prayer to himself as he ran. “Pater noster, qui es in caelis,” he panted, and his mind whispered,
“Don’t be so dramatic,” Tony said, rolling his eyes. “I just need an hour or two, not the whole night.”
“Yes.”
Tony scolded himself.
Tony shrugged. “For all my other sins, I rarely lie, and especially not about things that are important. What I hide, I hide to protect others, not myself.”
Bucky made a noise of frustration. “You won’t believe me until you see it. You need to find them,
“Not the whole time, no.” Hands bandaged, Bucky paused expectantly, gesturing towards the plate with his chin, and Steve fed him a piece of chicken. “Didn’t think he was real for a long time, just a character from a bunch of songs,” he continued after he swallowed.
Tony stared incredulously at Steve’s back as he jogged down the road towards the sound of shouting and ring of weapons. “Sure, I’ll just twiddle my thumbs while I wait,” he called out sarcastically. He climbed down and led the horse off the road, tying it to tree branch to keep it from wandering off, and pulled out Steve’s sword and one of his own. He jogged to catch up with Steve but when he cleared the copse of trees to see the fight, he lowered the swords in surprise.
Tony ran a hand over his face. “Aren’t you not supposed to speak ill of the dead?”
When he got out to the small shed that served as the barn he found the horse, a big, sturdy draft horse, already hitched to the cart, its head dwarfing Tony’s as it nosed around him for treats. Tony laughed as it almost knocked him over and gave up the carrot he’d been hiding. Steve paused for a moment, watching, before the bowl in his hands reminded him of his errand.
!” Steve burst out under his breath, pacing away. He fisted his hands in his too-long hair and pulled, the sharp sting of it distracting him from the tangled knot in his chest. He tried to hold on to the anger, the frustration and impatience, but at the core of it was just fear, curdling his stomach and sliding slickly through his veins. Tony was right, damn him –
Tony stared at the door for a long time in shock, blinking rapidly as his mind raced. What in the hell did he mean,
“What?” Steve said in disbelief, steps slowing. “Arrested? On what charges?”
“You seemed to have it well in hand,” Tony said a beat too late, suddenly remembering that Steve was talking to him. "You didn't even need this," he added, handing him his sword.
“She’s covering our tracks,” Tony said shortly when he saw Steve looking around for her. “She took the horses to try to lead any pursuers in the wrong direction.”
“Take off your sword and set it to the side.” There was only the barest hesitation as Steve obeyed, unbuckling the heavy belt that held the sword and sheath at his waist. He set it down on the long, low couch that lined the wall. “And your surcoat and mail,” Tony added. The only sound in the room was the soft chiming of the chain mail as Steve lifted it over his head; now he was down to his gambeson, emphasizing the breadth of his shoulders and trim waist. “Do you not feel lighter already? Now you are no longer a soldier, merely a penitent in search of absolution. You may continue.”
“Ana, our friend is in dire need of your help,” he said, gesturing to Barnes after he embraced her. When Ana saw Barnes’s condition, her eyes widened and she called out for her maidservant to gather warm water, bandages, and willow bark as Tony and Steve lowered Barnes to the ground. Natasha hung back, holding the horses as Steve helped the women take Barnes inside and the older man pulled Tony into a hug.
"Is he why you created the Iron Cardinal?"
” Bucky said loudly over Steve’s protests. “The point is, it is for
Bucky laughed at that, as he was meant to, and then they were bidding each other goodnight. But the question lingered in Steve's mind off and on for days afterwards; he had the feeling that if he could answer that one question, the rest of that infuriating man would make sense.
Steve raised an eyebrow and narrowed his eyes at Stark, trying not to smile at the man’s discomfiture. “Where else could I possibly have heard it?”
Tony’s throat closed up at the sincerity in Steve’s voice and the warmth in his eyes. His words were failing him, so the only response Tony could think to make was to rise up and press his lips to Steve’s. Steve made a muffled sound of surprise, and then with a groan from deep in his chest he wrapped an arm around Tony’s back and pulled him close. “God, Tony I was so scared,” Steve murmured against Tony’s mouth, voice wrecked. His kisses were hungry and desperate, and Tony’s morning had the potential to get a lot more interesting if two things hadn’t happened: one, his stomach rumbled with an almost embarrassing loudness, reminding him that it had been some time since he’d eaten, and two, they both heard Natasha and James’s voices coming down the hallway. As the sound of their conversation grew louder, Steve released Tony with a flattering reluctance, pressing one last kiss to his mouth.
“You’ll figure it out. Everything will be fine, you’ll see.” Tony must have just realized that he was still touching Steve because he hastily drew his hand back. Steve could still feel the warmth of it on his skin, even through the cloth of his robes. He wanted to take Tony’s hand and put it back on his arm. He wanted to put his hands on Tony. He wanted to bury his face in Tony’s neck, press him back against the grass, and forget the world for a few minutes, to lose himself to raw sensation. He wanted all of this with such sudden ferocity that it terrified him, and it took him a moment to realize Tony was still talking. “But you know, finding him is just the first step,” Tony warned. “After that, we still have to figure out what should be done with the relics.”
had the artifacts the whole time?” He said incredulously when the realization hit him. “How? Why?”
"I doubt Barnes would still be alive if Stane had the relics, so we're just going to have to hope they are safe until Barnes can tell us where they are," Tony said shortly. He didn't have to put a hand on Barnes's head to know he was out of his mind with a fever, probably from infection. He turned to leave and was brought up short when Natasha appeared in the doorway.
The stranger jumped when Steve dragged up an empty chair sat down next to him, eyes darting around the tavern nervously. Natasha snapped her fingers to get his attention again. “We already promised you protection against Lord Stane,” she reminded him. “Now you have to tell us what you know.”
“We aren't,” Tony said firmly, so confident that Steve could almost believe him. Tony put a hand on Steve’s forearm and squeezed, and Steve felt his heart skip a beat. “You know, I admire your loyalty to your friend. It’s quite rare, in my experience. Something to be treasured.”
“Mine is still bigger,” she said, and as they frowned she led them to another part of the castle. “Your comment earlier about the Vicomte giving up his wine cellar made me wonder why he was turning his cellar into a prison in the first place. This not a large castle but even small castles have dungeons to hold men before they are delivered to the King’s justice, right? So why not hold Barnes there?”
“Chatellerault,” Stark repeated thoughtfully. “Good swords come from there, I took a tour of their blacksmith shops a few years ago. I know the Vicomte, too, he's an old family friend.” He looked down at his robes ruefully and passed a hand through his shorn hair. “I don’t think I’ll be calling on him this time, though. But that’s a good place to start, I think a former knight would blend in well in that town.”
“Stane. He asked me if I’d seen a man matching either of these pictures,” he said dryly, pointing at the sketches on the bottom of the page. “Now we have three separate parties looking for the relics. The crown, the church, and Hydra.”
“Lord Stark,” the footman said as he opened the front door, clearly surprised and strangely, dismayed, to see him. “We, ah, we didn’t expect you so soon.”
“I am.” Concern for Bucky had been in the back of his mind since the incident with the Templar in Stark’s church, but now that he’d put the feeling into words he knew that’s what he was going to do, with or without Stark.
“Fine,” Tony sighed with mock frustration.  “Mathematics, then.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve finally managed to say, having practiced the words in his head all morning. “I know it’s not…I know it doesn’t make up for what I said, but for what it’s worth, I am sorry.”
“That’s a yes. Thank God for that at least. So are you going to do something about it?” When Steve stayed miserably silent, staring at the floor, Bucky groaned. “Goddammit. It’s because it’s a sin, isn’t it?” Steve nodded, and came to sit down on Bucky’s bed, resting his head in his hands. “You know," Bucky said, "I’ve always thought that the Church has you so twisted up inside that you can’t see God for the scriptures."
“I know what you’re thinking,” Tony’s voice said softly out of the darkness. “But if you do that, you might as well be waving a flag for everyone looking for him.”
When he was ready, Steve climbed back into the wagon, this time sitting next to Thomas on the seat.  “You work for Stark?” Steve asked as the horse pulled the wagon back onto the rutted dirt road.  He’d spent the hours hiding in the wagon plagued with questions: Where was Stark sending him? Was Stark going to be safe if he stayed behind? What happened to the other Templar? And how exactly did a man of the church know how to smuggle a man out of Paris on such short notice?
“I think you have come to me because you are bearing a heavy burden,” Tony said, making sure his voice was measured even though his heart was pounding. “You are seeking release, are you not?”
He held it there for a long moment as if savoring the wet heat of Steve’s mouth and then began to pull back. Steve pressed his tongue to the underside of Stark’s cock as he withdrew until the flare of the head tugged against Steve’s closed lips, then he had a moment to suck on the soft, smooth skin of the tip before Stark was sliding back in. “So good for me,” Stark said, voice low as his thumbs stroked Steve’s jaw. “But remember, when you’re inside these walls you take what your God gives you, no more and no less.”
Tony opened his mouth to protest, but he knew Edwin was right. He did, however, pull some money from his purse and press it into Edwin’s hand. “Go ahead and buy anything else you think you’ll need,” he said. “I don’t want you to worry about having three extra mouths to feed.”
“As soon as what happened?” Tony asked, still staring at the black hangings. The steward, Edwin’s replacement, was coming down the hall, and the footman bowed gratefully and took a step back, clearly glad to be off the hook for what was coming. “What happened?” He repeated to the steward.
With a frown, Steve’s pencil stilled as he realized that he had sketched a child sleeping on a man’s shoulder, thumb tucked into its mouth.  Aggravated at his own thoughts, he colored in a goatee on the child to match Stark’s pretentious facial hair and slammed the book closed.
Steve inhaled sharply. “Oh, Tony, I’m sorry.” Tony only shrugged and silence fell, broken only by the sounds of the fire. As Tony took another swallow of wine, Steve suddenly realized that this was the first time he’d ever seen Tony actually drunk; he’d seen him often enough with a glass of wine in his hand, but much less so actually drinking from it. “How are you doing?” he finally ventured. “I know the news about your father must be…” Steve didn’t know how to finish his thought. His father had died when he was young, and his mother had been ill for a while before she passed; Tony’s father’s death had been sudden, and they had apparently been estranged for a long time. He couldn’t imagine what Tony was feeling right now.
Steve nodded in agreement. “His color is already better,” he said. He pressed a hand to Tony’s forehead, which was already noticeably cooler. “I think it’s working.” He took the grail from Natasha’s limp fingers, studying it with wonder. “You were right,” he said to Bucky, voice thick and eyes damp. “Thank you.”
“Is Paris under attack?” Steve hesitated, glancing around the sparsely decorated room that had been his home for the past year.  He was accustomed to traveling light, so after a moment he reached for his sketchbook, an illustrated copy of the Bible that was the only thing he owned of his father’s, and his mother’s wedding ring that he often wore on a chain under his armor.  He slung his shield over his back and his sword around his waist.  “I’m ready,” he said, and Bucky gestured for him to follow as they rushed through the halls of the keep towards the stables.
“What are you talking about? This man needs help-“
“That’s good, right? Does that mean this will all be over soon?”
“So what now?” Steve asked. “Are we safe?”
“Thou shalt not kill,” he said automatically.
“Better than all of those,” Sam said. “Distilled alcohol.”
Frowning, he looked again; from a distance, it certainly looked like Cardinal Stark, but he was wearing a very simple cloak and robes instead of his normal richly dyed and impeccably tailored vestments.  Curiosity piqued, he followed Stark around the street corner, staying half a block behind as he tried to figure out where he was going.  They wound through the streets and away from the water to end up in one of the poorer but still respectable districts of Paris until Stark stopped in front of a large plain brick building.  Stark knocked and wasn’t kept waiting long before a tall, lean monk answered the door, bowing respectfully as he welcomed Stark inside.  Steve waited until the door closed before he went closer to investigate the plaque mounted beside the door.
reasons I keep you in my prayers every day.”
“Pack whatever you can’t bear to lose,” Bucky said instead of answering. He leaned out the door as if looking for something.  “Because once we leave, I don’t know if you’ll ever be able to come back for anything.”
He rubbed his temples against the impending headache and braced himself to sit down with Stane.
“But he’s a
“We can't bring you with us,” Tony warned the men as the gate swung open silently, well oiled. "We don't have the horses for you all. I’ll point the way to the stables and we’re opening the gate to escape, but the rest is up to you. God be with you.” The men nodded their understanding and then the whole procession was heading up the stairs, blowing out the candles as they left the pitch darkness of the lower floors.
"Are you okay?" Steve said from behind him. "You've been sighing a lot."
“Are you ready?” Ana said from the doorway, snapping him out of his thoughts. “Lord Antoine is already in the cart.”
“Friendships like yours are a blessing,” Stark said with a smile. “Please, have a glass of wine while we wait for the other guests to arrive.”
“No, Your Grace,” Steve admitted, raising his gaze to meet Stark’s eyes. He licked his lips and saw Stark’s eyes follow the movement of his tongue. “I confess to the sin of lust,” he said, feeling a little breathless.
Tony scowled. "In part," he admitted grudgingly. Steve waited a moment, clearly inviting him to continue, but Tony stubbornly kept his mouth closed.
“I need to see the relics,” Steve demanded as soon as he saw her. “Now.”
Bucky raised an eyebrow, eyeing him critically. “Sounds like you finally figured out that you want him so badly you can’t think straight.”
“What the hell are you talking about?”  Steve demanded.
” he said. “This whole time, you’ve been poisoned? For God’s sake, Tony, why didn’t you say something?” His hands hovered like he wanted to grab Tony but didn't know where to put his hands.
“You’ve met her, though you might not have known it at the time," Tony said. "She’s my…assistant.”
“Guys, we’ve got a situation,” she said.
“You’ve trusted me this far,” Tony said, voice pitched low to avoid waking Hassam. He sounded unbearably intimate, speaking in the darkness like this. “Please trust me a little more. There are…” He hesitated for a moment. “There are other people working on helping us find Bucky. We’re not alone in this.”
Almost a fortnight later, Tony was humming happily in his study at Notre Dame when Steve came in holding a message, frowning down at the paper in his hands. “Tony,” he started, and Tony looked up at him and smiled. Steve was still dusty from the road, wearing his armor and a surplice with Tony’s crest on it. Sunlight shone on his golden hair and beard, glinting off his mail, and he was so handsome that Tony’s heart hurt.
Steve rushed inside only to slow as he approached Bucky’s bed. He wasn’t sure if Bucky looked better or worse now that he was clean and bandaged; the white of the bandages against his skin brought the sheer number of his injuries into sharp relief, and without the dirt on his skin it was easier to see the mottled blue-purple of his bruises. He hovered over Bucky’s bed for a moment, before he knelt and brought a hand up to stroke over his hair, the crown of Bucky’s head being one of the few places that didn’t seem to be injured.
Tony stared at Edwin’s hand over his own and swallowed thickly; Steve saw a flash of vulnerability in his eyes as they studied Edwin’s swollen knuckles and pale skin, spotted with age. “I, uh,” Tony cleared his throat to disguise the wobble in his voice. “Thank you,” he finally managed with a tired smile. “I appreciate that. But I can handle it.” With a satisfied nod, Edwin squeezed Tony's hand and and returned to his dinner.
Steve eyed the work he’d done and the amount he had left to do, and decided he was at a good stopping point for the day. Since he’d gotten here a week ago, they’d put him to work clearing a field in order to expand their garden; he was almost done chopping the trees down and turning them into firewood for the monastery, and next he’d start digging up the roots and collecting rocks so they could till the dirt for the crops. “I’m coming,” he said, tucking the ax into the rope belt that gathered his robe at his waist and pulling off the tough leather gloves. “Who’s our guest?” he asked as he followed Brother Thibault back to the monastery.
The image of Tony surrounded by a bunch of toddlers trying to scam him for treats made a smile tug on Steve’s lips. “Is that what you like about them? The honesty?”
“Handsome,” Steve managed, feeling his face get hot and his heart race. Tony reared back like he’d been slapped, blinking in surprise. They stared at each other speechlessly for a long moment, then Steve said, face still flaming, “I’ll just,” and gestured with his chin towards the bedroom that Bucky had been staying in, even though he didn’t have the slightest idea what he would do when he got there.
Tony’s face went slack. “What? But-” He glanced between his glass and Stane’s, who drained his wine smugly. Tony held his glass up to the light and saw with dismay that there was a film on the inside, smudged and missing in places where he’d put his mouth. Tony’s stomach twisted with fear and nausea as Stane set his glass on the table and took a small cloth pouch out of his coat. Reaching in, Stane pulled out a small, round, waxy pill, rolling it between his fingers.
“Of course.” Stane rested an avuncular hand on Tony’s shoulder, eyes sympathetic. “I know you must be in shock, this is very sudden.”
Tony curled his lip. “I think you’ll find me harder to kill than my father.”
because you’re not the only ones looking for this guy Barnes,” Natasha said primly, her eyes sparkling. “Now who’s mind is in the gutter?” Then she dropped out of sight before Tony could respond. He leaned out the window to see if he could catch her leaving, but as usual, it was like she vanished into thin air.
Tony had asked him once, and at the time Steve hadn't known the answer. Bucky clearly hadn't had the same problem, and his conviction made the answer seem so clear. Like Alexander cutting through the Gordian Knot, Steve felt like the tangled knot of conflicting emotions that had been living in his chest had been cut right in two, leaving something clean and pure in its wake.
“They are,” Steve agreed. “Bucky and I stared at the stars many a night out in the deserts near Jerusalem. I’ve never seen a sky so clear as that in the Holy Land.”
This time, Tony could feel James's eyes on him, and he refused to meet his gaze. “The grail will not refuse to heal you, Tony,” he said softly.
“Tell me about your friend,” Stark said unexpectedly, breaking Steve’s train of thought. “Put yourself in his shoes, where do you think he would go?”
“They are being interrogated for the charges of heresy,” Stark said when he finished chewing. “Some have confessed.”
to judge. Not you.”
They pushed the horses as hard as they dared, riding through the night until the sun crested the trees. Steve stayed on his horse’s back the whole time, even as they rested and watered them, because he was afraid that if he got Bucky off the horse he wouldn’t be able to get him back on it again.
“Steve, you had enough to say about the man without knowing that he was running a secret empire of spies and criminals,” Bucky said. He tried to reach for the water but grimaced when the movement pulled at his wounds, so Steve held the cup to Bucky's mouth to drink. “Especially since I couldn't figure out his motives. I wanted to get the measure of the man myself before I even said anything to the Grand Master.”
“In a moment, Edwin,” Tony said, glancing at Natasha. Edwin nodded in understanding and went inside to give them some privacy.
“I can assure you that Howard’s accounts are in order, so that shouldn’t be difficult.” Stane sat back in his chair and laced his fingers together over his chest. “I helped him manage them so he could spend his time on more important matters. But since you brought up his will, I hope it’s not to forward to ask what you plan to do with the estate, given your position.” He eyed Tony’s clothes. “You
“I’m hardly pure of heart,” Tony joked weakly, summoning a smile. “Or pure of anything, really.”
“That's because you are a very contrary person,” Sister Virginia said. “It's one of the many,
“Do you actually expect me to believe that?”  Steve had to pace away before he committed violence on church grounds, unable to look at Stark sitting there unrepentant.
“Whatever you need, Tony, I’ll do it.”
“Yes, why? Would you like to speak to him?”
But Tony never came. Steve told himself that Tony would come for dinner, but nurses came and went with dinner and another tisane for Bucky and he never showed. Then he figured that Tony would come after dark, when the servants settled in to sleep, but the door stayed closed. Finally as the moon rose, Steve got tired of waiting. As beams of silver crawled in through the infirmary’s narrow windows, he slipped out of the room and searched for Tony. He wasn’t in the study, though the coals from the fire there were still warm. The master bedroom was cold and empty, but when he went up another floor he finally found a door with a faint line of light coming from underneath.
"But how do we do that?"
"I never knew my father," Steve said when he realized Tony wasn't going to say anything. "He left for the Crusades before I was born and died in battle."
Tony nodded, looking grim. “It’s not going to be easy. Especially if he has guards.”
“No problem, I understand. I’m sorry to be the one to give you the news, but I’m glad I was able to be here for you,” Stane said as they sat. Tony noticed distantly that his father’s desk was untidy, like he’d been in the middle of working on something when he’d walked away from it. He tightened his jaw and turned away, sitting across from Stane.
Tony hushed her and drew her away from the barn where Steve was unharnessing the horse. “The less said about the Iron Cardinal, the better.”
Edwin reached across the table and put his hand on Tony’s, squeezing it. “Stay as long as you want. Whatever you need, my boy, we are here for you. You should know that by now.”
“He said he would come when he has time,” the footman said as he backed towards the door, clearly relieved. “I’m sure you appreciate that I can hardly interrupt him while he is meeting with Lord Stane.”
“Yes, Your Grace,” he said, and was rewarded with the press of a finger that finally,
Tony took a deep breath and let it out slowly. “It appears so, yes.”
“No. If you sent them to Paris, we haven’t been in Paris for some time. But I’m sure they are safe,” he added hurriedly when Bucky’s eyes widened with alarm. "Tony has people he trusts who-"
“No one gets their hands on the real relics,” Tony explained. “So no one can use the powers that you say they have. And the first time someone tries to tout them to the public, the others will come forward as well, and then they will all argue about who has the real one and who has the forgeries.”
Steve started to make another joke, but there was an odd twist to Tony's smile that made him think better of it. "You might be overestimating my virtuousness," he said instead. "Besides, one damsel in distress at a time, and right now it's Bucky's turn."
“But why?”
“We just have to get as far as Loudoun,” Tony said, petting Friday apologetically on the nose for pushing her so hard as he fed her an apple. “Then we’ll be on my father’s lands.”
“Look, I know this is just a game to you, but this is
“What? Deceptive? Two-faced?” When Steve just stood there, tongue-tied, Tony scowled. “Just say it, Rogers-”
“But if it is the Hydra, then it is everyone’s fight,” Sam said stubbornly. “If they are here, then they will be in my new home soon, if they are not already.”
.  The point is that you try
“What am I supposed to do here?” Steve said as the wagon pulled away.
“Cast your gaze heavenward and give thanks,” Stark murmured in his ear, breath hot on his neck as his fingers curled around Steve’s cock and stroked him, fast and rough. He put his other hand around Steve’s throat, squeezing lightly; between his legs Steve could feel the filthy wetness where Stark’s spend was seeping out of him, and all of this became a dizzying whirl of sensation as he strained for his release. “God inspires all holy desires and brings them to fulfillment.”
“Tony,” Steve said, and the note in his voice made Tony look up from the rest of Natasha’s notes, trying to find another mention of the men wearing this symbol. “Are these men-” He stopped suddenly, casting a furtive glance at Sam. “Er, going to be a problem?” he finished after a moment. He gave Tony a significant look, and Tony barely stopped himself from rolling his eyes at Steve’s obviousness, since Sam was glancing between them with interest and listening intently.
“Then I’ll go with you,” Steve said, holding him tight as if he could physically keep Bucky from slipping through his fingers. “You’ll need someone to watch your back-“
With effort, Steve forced his thoughts away from the ball of rage in his chest and tried to think. “He has an uncle with a farm outside of Chatellerault,” he said. “I think that’s where his family is from.”
still in the Church…?”
Steve tilted his head. “What does that mean?”
An older man and woman came outside as Tony slid off his horse. “Lord Antoine?” the lady said. “What a surprise! What are you-”
“It does make things more complicated. My father and I don’t get along, to put it mildly.” Tony pulled his bowl of stew closer and sighed, shoulders slumped. “I would pick another estate, but the hunting lodges are all going to be closed up and are farther away, and I don’t want to stay here any longer than necessary because I don’t want to pull you two into this.”
“Can you be sure of that? Absolutely sure?” Stark said. “Willing to stake your life on it?
“He shouldn’t be expecting you – I’ve been having your men laying false trails up and down the coast. Hopefully he’ll be complacent; after all, no one suspects that he may have been making a play for the relics.”
“Huh,” Tony said. He put the drawing back in their chest and ostentatiously put his papers away, hoping that Steve got the message:
"I'm so sorry, Antoine," a deep, familiar voice said from the top of the stairs. Tony glanced up and his blood ran cold as he watched Lord Stane coming towards him, his heavyset face arranged in a look of sorrow. "He was thrown from his horse and killed instantly. There was nothing I could do."
“Good night,” Steve said automatically, but stared at the sky for a long time before falling asleep.
Tony tapped the piece of paper against his lips, gaze far away as he thought. “You know, the lies that fool us the best are the ones we tell ourselves,” he mused. He stood up suddenly and strode out the door, leaving Steve and Bucky staring after him.
“Shortly before the dinner that we went to. That’s why I was so interested in going.”
“You’re back! I take it you and James are finished hiding the true relics?” After examining the relics, they had all decided that the world wasn’t ready for objects of such power; the Templars had been right to keep them locked away from the hands of the greedy and power-hungry. But clearly having them in one place was too much of a temptation; even though the King and the Church were now squabbling over which relics were authentic and which were forgeries, the risk that someone would find about the
As the neared Loudoun, Tony took the lead as Natasha fell back to watch their rear. They kept to the outskirts of the city until he came to a charming cottage surrounded by a garden so robust that it threatened to overtake the path to the front door.
“And you think I can help?” Tony folded the paper back up and set it aside.
When he looked up, Steve saw Bucky studying him thoughtfully. When Bucky took a breath to speak, Steve braced himself, but all Bucky said was, “Well, I suppose you would know,” and then turned to speak to the man on his other side, leaving Steve to wonder what exactly he meant by that.
Steve shook his head in disapproval and looked away so Stark couldn't see his reluctant smile. The amiable mood lasted for rest of the day, with Stark greeting and making conversation with almost everyone they met on the road as they traded the responsibility for driving. They never passed through a town big enough to have an inn, however, so when the sun was getting low in the sky Steve pulled them off at a grassy clearing next to the road. Steve gathered wood for a fire while Stark unhitched the horse from the wagon, putting it on a lead so it could graze. When Steve returned, setting down an armful of branches, he saw Stark pull out a pair of small pillows and blankets from the trunk in the back of the wagon. To Steve's surprise, Stark tossed one of the pillows to him.
Steve’s felt his face flame as he dropped to his knees. “Good,” Cardinal Stark said approvingly. The heat from his face spread down his neck and chest at the praise, until his whole body felt hot and flushed. He kept his gaze on the floor though his senses seemed entirely attuned to Stark, listening to the soft susurration of his robes as he walked around his desk.
life? Brother Peter’s?”
Steve shrugged. “Busy, I guess.”
Tony shrugged. “I don’t understand how other people don’t. If I didn’t, I’d be bored out of my mind, and that is a fate worse than death.” Tony ripped off another piece of bread and chewed it, staring at Steve thoughtfully. “What about you? I know you’re not the wine, women, and song type, so what do you do in your free time? Do you stand at street corners and preach about sin? You have the disapproving scowl for it.” The smile on Tony’s face took the sting out of the words, and Steve suppressed the childish urge to stick his tongue out at him.
Steve was already jumping out of the wagon as Tony pulled to a stop. He fumbled for the latch to the hidden compartment for the swords and threw his hands up in frustration when it didn't immediately open. “Stay here,” he ordered. “I’ll check it out.”
“You said that I should come to you when this was all done,” Steve said softly. “I’m here, and I want you more than ever.”
There was a moment of hesitation as Steve realized what Stark was asking for, then his hands were fumbling at his braes, shoving them down to free his cock. His breath felt punched out of him at the first touch of his hands on himself, and as he started to stroke he curled over at the force of the sensation.
” Stark said. “Inanimate objects can’t be imbued with power, that is just superstition,” he added, and Steve was again grateful to the dark so Stark couldn’t see his chagrin. “But people will do a lot for someone they believe in. If the king can use these artifacts to rally the people behind him, then there will be no stopping him and his ambitions.”
“What about Steve?”
“Sir, what should we do about the two-”
“Yes, Your Grace,” he said.
“Theoretically,” Steve said sarcastically but Tony’s grin only widened.
“Leave?” Steve repeated as he reached for his surcoat and armor, throwing them over his head and fastening them with practiced hands even as Bucky’s agitation was making his heart race. “What’s happening?”
Steve raised his eyebrows at the amount of food on the table as he sat but didn’t comment.  “Wasn’t entirely sure I had a choice,” he said, then sighed when Stark’s smile faded, unsure why he was being so surly. “I’m sorry,” he started, but Stark waved his words away.
going to hell for using a pillow,” and laughed when he felt said pillow hit him in the back of the head.
“And then he proceeds to not visit nearly as often as he should. Tiffany, will you please go to the drying room and bring me garlic, willow bark, the gentian, the plantain, and the cinquefoil?” The maid dipped her head and brushed by Steve, offering him a shy smile as he stepped back to give her room to pass.
“What in God’s name is that?” Steve said, staring down the table at the utensil in Stark’s hand. Bucky lifted his head from his meal and followed Steve’s gaze down the table. He made a thoughtful noise as he chewed, watching as Stark held his steak steady with the exotic, filigreed silver utensil as he cut and then used it to carry his food to his mouth. As he swallowed, Bucky looked down at his own plainer wood utensil. “It has two prongs,” he noted, looking back and forth between the two.
Tony turned his head unexpectedly and smiled when he caught Steve looking at him. It was small and soft and unguarded and Steve felt like he’d been punched in the chest. “Good night,” Tony said, and rolled over to sleep.
When Tony opened his eyes, Steve must have seen his thoughts written on his face, because he just pressed one more kiss to Tony’s forehead and stood. “Please eat, Tony,” he said, and Tony nodded, vowing to try. “I’ll see you at dinner.”
“This goes to Captain Rhodes,” Stark said, folding up one sheet and sealing it. “And this one to Sister Natasha.  The King has apparently moved against the Knights Templar, and I am very displeased to find out that I am the last to know about it.”
He wove his way through the winding halls of the Cathedral until he found Brother Peter at his desk, tongue between his teeth as he painstakingly practiced his calligraphy.  “Is Cardinal Stark available?” Steve asked. “Or does he have…guests?”
“Until now.”
“Huh," Steve said eloquently. "I wouldn't have pegged you for a stargazer.”
Tony shook his head. “He’s gone, he doesn’t suspect anything. I think.” He opened his mouth like he was going to say something else, but apparently thought better of it because instead he just took a swallow of wine straight from the bottle.
“And you had sinful thoughts about this man?” Stark asked, leaning over to speak right into Steve’s ear, his voice husky and breath hot on Steve’s skin. He was standing so close Steve could feel the brush of his robes against his bared skin.
Steve realized that his jaw was hurting because he was grinding his teeth so hard in an effort to not shout, and that his hands had curled into fists. He took a deep breath and sat up straight, forcing his eyes to stay on the road because if he looked at Stark’s face he might lose his thin grip on his self-control.
“The Pope issued a papal bull calling for all European monarchs to arrest Templars in their kingdoms and seize their assets,” Stark said, sounding apologetic. “If that’s where he went, he’s not safe.” Steve cursed and put his face in his hands, resting his elbows on his knees as he fought his temper. He wasted
“Distribute the funds to the orphanages?” Sister Virginia finished.  “You mean, your favorite day of the month? Yes it is.”  She pulled out five purses, heavy with gold, and lined them up on Tony’s desk.  “This time, do try very hard not to blaspheme in front of them.”
Stane raised his eyebrows as he circled Steve’s limp, bloody body.  “I’m impressed,” he said. “I didn’t think you had it in you.”
"Just a nickname? So it's not a code name for the leader of an elaborate criminal network of smugglers like Thomas?" Tony just shrugged, mouth in a tight line. Steve watched him for a few long minutes then finally looked away because Stark seemed determined to keep his attention on the road rather than elaborate further. “So who is Sister Natasha? You’ve mentioned her before, but I don’t believe I’ve ever met her.”
“Is your job always smuggling people?”
“Later,” Tony promised, and felt Steve shudder before his hands fell away.
Bucky snorted and rolled his eyes at that.  “It’s not as if he’s public about his peccadillos.  I think most of the gossip I hear about him is that he lets the wine flow a little too freely at his dinner parties and that he has half of the government in his pocket.”
“What’s wrong?” He asked Natasha, stroking Friday’s soft nose. “I thought you were on your way to Paris after yesterday.”
Bucky had a restless, feverish night that night, waking Steve up mumbling in his sleep and trying to move. Steve soothed him, sponging sweat from his face and chest when he was hot and tucking blankets around him when he shivered, spooning the tisane and broth past his lips when he was awake enough to swallow. He tried to talk to Bucky about the relics but he was only speaking nonsense, so Steve stopped asking. Eventually Bucky fell back to sleep, the heated flush of his face finally fading as his fever broke, and Steve lay gratefully back down on his pallet.
"More than that, though, we need to figure out what to do with Stane," Steve pointed out. "He will be extremely suspicious if you turn up completely healthy, and having tried to kill you once, he will almost certainly do it again."
“Look, I’ve looked into the face of evil,” James said. “You have too. It’s in the smile of a person who takes joy from another’s pain, in the greed of a person who takes from people who have little or from those who don’t want to give. It is
“Ready,” Natasha whispered down, then Tony’s weight was gone as well as he climbed up and into the window. Steve waited until he got a thumbs up from the window before he climbed up as well, rolling so he landed lightly in what turned out to be a sitting room.
“Is that what this symbol represents? A cult? One of the other sources in Paris said it was the symbol of a secret organization.”
He bit his lip as they tingled with the desire to find out what Tony tasted like.
Sir Rogers – Steve, Tony reminded himself, though it was a hard habit to break – seemed to come to a decision because he closed the door behind him and, in a move that made Tony’s pulse quicken, pushed the bolt to lock the door. “Bless me, Father, for I have sinned,” he said, voice husky. “It’s been too long since my last confession.”
Tony summoned as false a smile as Steve had ever seen on his face. “I'm fine. And you?”
library? I thought they belonged to the church.”
He thought about going after Rodgers to find out, but he didn’t feel like dealing with whatever had the touchy knight in a snit after the otherwise pleasant day they’d had. “For Christ’s sake,” he muttered under his breath as he shed his monk’s robe and slid between the sheets. “Don’t know what sleeping in my braes has to do with vows of celibacy, it’s not like I was propositioning-Holy Mother of God,” he breathed, sitting up straight in bed when he finally realized why Steve was angry. “Sister Natasha was right.” He blinked into the darkness and fell back against the pillows with a groan. “Shit. She is never going to let me live this down.”
Tony gave him a sympathetic smile. This morning he looked tired, the lines around his eyes deeper than normal and his shoulders slumped like he was carrying a heavy weight, but his smile was genuine enough. “Yeah, there’s a lot of that going around. Can I see your hands?” When Bucky offered him the closest one, Tony gently unwound the bandages and carefully inspected the broken bones that Anna had set. They were still swollen but to Steve’s relief the skin wasn’t hot or red, so there didn’t seem to be any infection.
Steve sat back on his heels, swallowing back his disappointment. He nodded and stood, stooping to retrieve the bottle of wine as he walked to the door. “I’m taking this with me,” he said, taking a swallow. He’d never drunk his sorrows away before, but now seemed like a good time to start.
“Brother Lucien introduced him as Brother Eduard,” Brother Thibault answered as Steve splashed water on his face and hair, rinsing away the sweat. Now that he had stopped working, his stomach was rumbling, making him glad that it was time to eat. Dinner here was always a simple affair, usually roast vegetables from the garden and hearty brown bread flavored with honey from the hives. After a hard day’s labor, Steve was always hungry enough that he scarcely missed the sophisticated variety of dishes he’d dined on in Paris.
“Not directly. But someone carved that symbol,” Sam gestured to Steve’s book with his chin, “into the wood of my family’s home in Baghdad. I told my family we shouldn’t let them drive us from our home with vague threats, but my father and his brothers would hear none of it. That is why we are now in al-Andalus, rubbing elbows with unbelievers.”
“Who would think to search a Muslim for a bunch of Christian artifacts? It’s not like he’s going to steal them,” Natasha said over her shoulder as she pushed the door open with a loud squeal from the hinges.
Tony’s laugh at that was sharp and bitter, like nothing Steve had heard from him before. “What makes you think something’s wrong?” he said. He used the bottle to wave at the elegant furnishings of the room, the thick rugs and art on the walls. “I’m back in my element, right? My silk sheets, I think you said? The only thing I’m missing is someone to warm my bed, but that shouldn’t be difficult, I’m sure I could find-”
“You’re talking about the powers of God,” Steve said, aghast. “That’s blasphemy. And also impossible.”
“You seem terribly concerned with what happens in my bed, Rodgers,” Stark said silkily.  His dark eyes glittered in the candlelight.  “Why is that?”
"Oh, that's a story for another day," Tony said, voice deceptively light. "It's long and sordid, just the kind of story you hate."
When he came into the room, he was surprised and, though he would never admit it to himself, a bit disappointed to see Tony fully dressed and sitting at the writing desk bent over a stack of papers instead of lounging in bed, tousled and sleepy. The shutters were closed, but there was no smell of sex in the air, so they must have been opened earlier; Steve felt an unwelcome wave of heat crawl down his back at the idea that they’d left the shutters open while they fucked, letting their moans echo in the night air for anyone to hear.
“Now how did you know that?” Steve sat down in the chair in front of the desk and read the message out loud. “’V de C’ – I’m going to guess that’s short for the Vicomte – ‘found dead in the middle of an apparent ritual with eight other members of the nobility. Observers think it was a suicide pact, probably Satanic judging from the symbols arrayed around them.’ I’m going to guess one of those symbols might have been for a many-headed snake.” Steve folded the paper again and passed it over the desk to Tony. “So I repeat, what did you do?”
“I’m sorry!” He said. She had finally cornered him against the fireplace. “But it was also more important that you take care of the forgeries and everything than to come down and hover uselessly. I wouldn’t have handled it that way if I thought I had any other choice.”
Steve paused with his food halfway to his mouth, then slowly lowered it. “Okay,” he said slowly. “Why?”
“Steve recognized it from the Holy Land, and we ran across a fellow traveler who knew what it meant. They call themselves the Hydra and apparently they are a bunch of fanatical assassins from Baghdad. They think that they can become gods through magic or prayer or something.” Tony ran his thumb over the impression, mind racing. “Maybe they think the relics can give them power.”
Tony turned the clay over in his hands, still stunned. “So it’s been about the relics the whole time? Stane’s working with this – this cult and was trying to get access to the relics?”
“Get out of my house, Stane,” Tony muttered savagely, staring at him with hate in his eyes, and with a final smile Stane left, closing the door to the study behind him. Tony collapsed back in his chair and the room was silent until a footman knocked and said through the door, “He’s gone, milord.”
“Oh dear. Please tell me you haven’t gotten involved with that Templar mess,” Ana said. “We’ve had criers in the town calling for people to turn in fugitive Templars.”
“Enough, Tony. Do you know where this man is or not?”
Steve waited for Tony to say more, to explain what Stane had wanted and why he’d been here, but Tony remained silent, staring at the fire. “Are you alright?” Steve ventured. "You seem..."
“We were riding in the woods and Howard’s horse refused a jump, shying at the last minute. Howard was thrown and was killed in the fall.” He spread his hands, eyes sad. “He died instantly.”
“Why do you care?” Steve said before he could stop himself. “You wouldn’t be the first person to enrich themselves in war.”
“Very well,” Steve said as he stood, clearly trying to hide his disappointment. “Good night, Tony.”
Stark rubbed his fingers over his eyes.  “I’ll figure this out,” he said, sounding like he was trying to convince himself as much as Steve.  “For now, just go back to your room.  I would suggest you gather your things in case you have to leave quickly.”
Steve nodded, then realized Tony probably couldn’t see him. “Very well.” Discipline was the difference between a knight and a mere fighter, he told himself, and if nothing else, he was still a knight. He heard a rustling, then felt Tony sit down beside him, close enough that their shoulders brushed. Steve swallowed thickly at the contact; between yesterday and today he felt like a raw nerve, exposed and sensitive. Any equanimity he'd found in the monastery had been shattered by this journey, and he felt as lost and wrong-footed as he had when Bucky had first shaken him awake in the small hours of the morning.
“Let’s stop here for the night,” Tony said when he saw the tavern, and Steve made a face.
“He may not be the most devout man, but I’m sure prayers wouldn’t hurt,” Steve said with a bow before he turned to Natasha. “I need a fresh horse.”
The rest of dinner was spent in oppressive silence, until Steve bid Stark good evening and spent the rest of the night sleepless in his room.
“I don’t know if he can go on like this much longer,” Steve said. Bucky was fiery hot against his back, making him sweat, and Steve could feel and hear every flinch and moan of pain as the ride jostled his injuries.
The next morning, the same artist that had been sent to make Steve look half dead was just finishing up Tony’s own face paint, trying to make him look less ill, when there was a knock on the door.
Natasha spread her hands. “So it would seem.”
“Clearly he needs someone to keep him out of trouble,” Sister Natasha said. “If he says something to the wrong person this will all be for naught.”
“You’ve already explained that,” Steve said impatiently. “I know that if the church finds me-“
“There’s not much to tell, honestly,” Stane said, and Tony wondered how much honesty was in that
Once Edwin had left, Steve seemed to realize for the first time that Natasha was gone.
“No, to the Duke.”
“Rodgers.” Stark slammed his hands on his desk impatiently, making Steve jump.  “
I could be compromised.” As Steve stared at him, stunned, Stark exhaled and ran a hand over his face.  “This is my fault.  I’ve been trying to protect you from the lies and the intrigue and now you may have doomed us all.”
"I'll send for Thomas," Natasha said. "I assume all three of you are going?" Steve met Tony's eyes and smiled, then they both nodded. James just shrugged. "I'll take care of it." She turned to leave and paused, then took a step back and grabbed James's arm, eyeing Steve and Tony. "You're going to probably want to come with me."
“Well, they were certainly calling out His name a lot.”  Steve was turned away, but he could hear the smug grin in Stark’s voice, could well imagine the way the man’s mouth would curl at the corners and his whiskey-brown eyes would grow darker.  Not for the first time he wished that Grand Master Molay had made someone else the liaison with Paris’s Cardinal Stark; every time he came here Stark’s impiety seemed worse than the last.
“Right,” James said, raising an eyebrow. Of course, they healed him with the grail as well; Tony barely recognized him without the bruising and swelling and the constant pain that had been drawing brackets around his mouth since they’d rescued him. “The way you told me and Steve what was going on because we were here and already in Stane’s path?”
