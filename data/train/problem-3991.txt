Dean dumps his duffle and Cas’ backpack onto the aggressive coffee table, while Castiel disappears into the bedroom with the cell Dean gave him once their liaison extended into something more tangible. He is quietly closing the bedroom door and making for the couch, when Dean returns from Baby for a second time. His eyebrow, which seems to have become his main means of communication arches, as Dean sets the two paper bags of groceries onto the nearest counter.
His eyes shut tight as Cas’ hand did all the right things, at all the right moments, and
“What day is it, your Highness?” Brother Alastair stood behind his desk, the scrape of his chair legs loud on the chequered marble tiles of their schoolroom. “Or perhaps I should ask Mr Winchester… he seems to be the more obedient of the two of you, perhaps he is also the more capable… Perhaps we should give him the opportunity to lessen your punishment by answering for you.”
“It’s OK, Jen. It happens to the best of us.” The words were meaningless, she hardly dared ask, as she feared she knew the answer. “What were you working on, Jen?” She kept her voice light.
He sighed and looked at his phone.  He needed to talk, there was really only one option…
“OK,” she muttered, “but I don’t like leaving this one alone, maybe we should kill him now.”
Then… to add insult to injury… he expected us to accept her bastard, defective offspring.”
I think you have the cause and effect a little skewed in that battered little noggin of yours!  Unless Benny is cleared as a totally innocent party…  he will be staying right here for at least another 12 months.” Crowley said. “And conspiracy theories aside, it will be up to the DA to decide whether to add your little ‘scrap’ to your list of charges.  My guess is he will jump at the chance… so you’ll have plenty of time to console Lafitte.”
he has four… accomplices. At least one of whom is dead. For definite. Your amazing gas station lady saw to that. So that leaves him with three, maximum. And the FBI agent, he said witnesses thought the big black guy was hit. So maybe he only has two left...”
He practically jumps from Dean’s lap. How could he be so selfish? This floor is cold and hard and he’s just sat here like a giant lump of self pity... Dean groans and puts his now free arms down to push himself up from his awkward position on the tile. “I’m s-sorry,” Castiel stutters, and fresh tears spring hot and unbidden. What the hell? He’s like an old tap that’s had the rust knocked away, leaking at the slightest thing.
It had been a long night. Adler rubbed the heels of his hands against his trouser legs, the finally healing skin itched unbearably. He still occasionally found another small piece of grit working its way to the surface when he succumbed to the temptation to scratch.
“So what did Napoleon want?” Meg asks him as they lie in the meadow grass beyond the furthest barn. It is a rare moment of peace in his crammed day.
Jane Coleman was leaning one-handed against the body van, her protective suit waiting to be zipped up, slotting her feet into bright blue plastic overshoes, when the two detectives arrived.  Jen O’Brien appeared beside her lugging a heavy equipment bag, her auburn hair spilling over her shoulders.  “Anything else you need boss?”  she asked, glancing just a fraction too long at the American as he stretched up to his full height from the Honda passenger seat.
He flicks open his bill fold, and realises he is short. He used most of his cash to pay for the lumber, but he couldn’t resist it. Benny had told him about the consignment of cherry wood that had just been delivered and he hadn’t taken much convincing to go and check it out. He’s hoping that they won’t quite have finished unloading it when he gets back home, he wants to see the look on Cas’ face. The one he gets when he loses himself in something beautiful.
“I… er… no. I just…” he is saved from whatever embarrassment is about to escape his lips when Angel’s stomach latches onto the pleasant aroma of the take out and gives a rumble to rival Krakatoa. “I take it breakfast was a good idea,” he says triumphantly.
A huge table, wood, rich and gleaming, the patina of polish between the brilliant white of crockery, sparkling silver cutlery and glittering glassware. It hurt his eyes it all shone so brightly. His eyes drifted upwards, to a dazzling display. Crystal upon crystal each throwing rainbow upon rainbow, blurring together into a clamouring cacophony of colour. His vision fused and blurred and his ears raged, burning and buzzing, the world going black, circles of light bursting through the dark and he was falling.
“Dean!” Cas says, jumping to his feet. “Benny has offered me work over the winter months. He even thinks he knows a merchant who will maybe sell any extra furniture I can make in the meantime.”
The airport was busy, but this was Las Vegas, premium destination. McCarran handled 500 flights a day and nearly 4 million people a month. It defined busy. The flight from JFK was due into Terminal 1, so they headed up Paradise Road, into the short stay passenger pick up. Gabe sent his security officer in with the board. He'd left an envelope with the boarding cards at the collection desk. The name Angel Miner was scribbled in block capitals on the collection board, all Meg had to do was walk up and make herself known. As the time ticked by, he tapped his fingers nervously on the dashboard, beginning to wonder whether he shouldn’t have gone in himself. Unphased by the nervous tension building in the vehicle, the driver pulled a bag of pop lollies out of the side pocket and offered one to Gabe. He took it, grateful for the intervention and covered his need to fidget with the candy.
“Sure, Officer Powers,”  the auto shop owner was an honest man, he answered Carter straight, no sign of any concern.  “I remember; fuel pump for a 67 Chevy Impala.  A 502, wasn’t so easy to get one out here.  Don’t see a lot of Impalas out this way.  I took it out to the Kunsberger place myself.   Donald was a good customer, he ran a small repairs business you see… not an engine on the planet Donald couldn’t fix.”
in these cabinets, Mr Angel.  The important stuff, the ‘secret’ stuff is all in the cupboard.”  She nodded towards a glass fronted display cabinet. “He thinks no-one else knows about it,” her voice filled with scorn, “...it has a false back.” Michael stared at her intently as if he was looking for the answer to some unasked question.  She blushed under the scrutiny and found herself adding. “He’s an asshole… sir.”
fresh spruce. oak and a sweet load of cherrywood
Dean sighed.  He was doing it a lot lately, he felt.  “I agreed to go for a drink with Jen O’Brien… the FP assistant,” he clarified when Crowley looked a little vague.
“Just worrying about Dean.”
The barb rankles a little. These two have been feuding for as long as Dean can remember. Far more than the usual rivalry between boarder and skier. “He’s not the manager, he owns the store, but there’s some ‘thing’ with the bank that he needed to get to…” Dean stops suddenly aware that maybe Benny would not like it if Cas of all people was aware just how much he is struggling to keep his head above water. “He’ll be back by four, but I gotta go check-in and dump my stuff.” He nods towards a duffel bag, half-tucked behind the serving counter. “I came straight here off the bus this morning and...then Benny was...and he had to...” He’s aware he’s babbling, but can’t seem to stop himself.
Raphael had been cagey about what was happening with Winchester. Cagier still about what was going to happen to his own brothers.  The fact that he had called Roman in, suggested he was going to continue with Adler’s plan with Castiel, but whereas normally he would have briefed Adler of his full intentions he had made a series of private phone calls.
Castiel is running late as he heads to meet Bal for dinner. He was already reluctant to go to the opening of yet another ostentatious, over priced restaurant opening, when let himself be cajoled into accepting the invitation. The fact that it means spending several hours with the Starks, an extremely flirty open couple who he’s convinced are determined to try and bed them both was only overridden by Bal’s pleading. They are high profile collectors of objet d’art, and Bal wants their investment for his latest gallery. Now running, thirty minutes late, still dressed in his work clothes, covered in the dust and detritus of the museum storerooms and out of sorts after a thoroughly bad day, he just wants to go home.
Castiel had left shortly after the nurse arrived and did not return until just before lunchtime, accompanied by Sam, but carrying the obligatory little brown bag, and blissfully, a flask. He deposited both in front of Dean, who seized on them with real zeal. “Don’t take that as proof he’s recovering,” Sam informed Cas with more than a hint of sarcasm, “the only things that slow my brother's appetite are a coma and health food.”
Her hands had shaken so much as she stripped off her uniform and changed into her ‘normal’ clothes she’d had difficulty undoing the buttons of her bobby blues.  Really and truly the jeans and shirt she’d worn on the bus that first morning weren’t smart enough for CID, but she was damned if she was going to spend her first day up there reminding everybody she was a woodentop.
Sam sighed. He put the gun away.
Carter rolled his eyes and removed himself from the car.
Dean climbed wearily down the stairs to the rented cellar apartment, he still couldn’t quite bring himself to call home, pushed the front door shut with a sigh, and dropped his keys into the upturned hub cap he used as a dish on the hall stand. His precinct colleagues had given him the cap as a leaving present, along with a survival kit that had included a pair of stars and stripes shorts, a signed first edition of Bill Bryson’s Life on a Small Island and an American to English dictionary.
“Good Morning Mr Angel.  No need to apologise, it was just incredibly quiet this morning.  I was just going to grab some cereal and juice.  I assume Jean-Paul is sleeping in...”
He was half way along the landing towards the stairs when he heard a door opening somewhere behind him, the surge of adrenaline made his heart pound and he automatically dropped back against the wall. He suppressed the laugh that burbled in his chest at his own reaction. She was 105 pounds wet through.
Dean doesn’t quite know what to say. Cas has been weird with him since their last day on the slopes.
He glanced across at Cas, dark hair, unruly and spiking in all directions, tanned face relaxed as he slept, bandaged hands resting lightly in front of him.  He tweaked the covers up and over his exposed upper arm.  The familiar flash of anger as the lines of finger grips showed in the bruises more muted now, but still forcing his lips into a tight line.  He laughed at himself, fairly certain Sammy would have something to say about his over-protective, big brother streak.
Cas closed his eyes, and let his breathing deepen.  The key scraped and, with a rasp, the latch pulled back.  He heard the gentle telltale scrape of a tray sliding onto a table, and the splosh of water circling into a vessel.
'Dean,' Castiel sighed, the request clear from his plaintive tone, and Dean obliged by taking him into his mouth. 'Dean!' Dean merely hummed, using all of the tricks he knew would drive Castiel to distraction. It did not take long before Castiel spilled in Dean's mouth, and Dean scarcely had time to lick his lips before Castiel dragged him to the bed to return the favour.
“He asked whether I had any recommendations on where he should stay…” She hid her smile behind her tea cup, eyes wide and obscenely innocent, as the crowd of Shirley Temple curls quivered with the movement. “I gave him directions to the motel on the highway...”
He reached for his cell and noticed the blank screen. He’d been so busy fending off his super fan he’d forgotten to put it on charge, with a mumbled curse he climbed back out of the car and opened the trunk intent on finding his USB cable from the depths of his overnight bag.
Dean pursed his lips, trying to figure out how not disturbing your cellmate with excessive ‘self relief’, could possibly apply.  “Rule 3?”
“Then forget you ever knew me,” Sam dared him.
“Well, I was thinking more for later, but OK…if you insist...”  Dean laughed and gave Cas a shit eating grin as he shook his dark head, blue eyes narrowed.
“Then...when she...when she told me she was dying. I promised her again. I promised her I would never tell anyone else ever and I didn’t. I even tried to fight the court order. But once it all came out, I thought at least I could keep the other half of my promise, I could protect Claire, make sure she had someone in her corner, and now I’ve even fucked that up ,” his hands clench reflexively in his dark hair and his voice cracks. “If I wasn’t such a complete fucking failure Claire would have come to me...Meg trusted me to take care of her and look what a mess I’ve made of it…She’s so alone...If anything happens to her I’ll never forgive myself.”
Mrs Kunsberger?  Dean stared at Cas, how long had he been in the bathroom exactly?  “Cas,” he said with a little shake of his head.  “You will never cease to amaze me.  I leave you alone for ten minutes and … At this rate, by the morning, they’ll be holding a hoedown in your honour and by Friday you’ll be running for Mayor.”  Dean grabbed blankets from the trunk, “You wanna take the back?”  Cas shrugged and rubbed a weary hand over his face.
'Indeed,' Gabriel nodded. 'A wealth largely accumulated through his plantations in the West Indies, worked by slaves of course.'
Even without it he could sense the warding. It dragged at the edges of his mind and body, a vibrating numbness that made it hard to move or think. He retched, nauseous and shaking.
Benny and Sam were just charging the front veranda, and Bobby and Ash were sighting their weapons on the rear exit when the whole world seemed to explode into light. The targets ahead of them disintegrating before they managed a single shot.
They smirked at each other, and Cas stretched, quietly collecting their trash and strolled in the direction of a trash can.   “I could drive some more if you want me to,” he called over his shoulder.
“Raph?”  he realised he had drifted off from the conversation.  “I said, how’s Cas?”
warm and firm. He squinted again, there was something wrong with the other toes, but his vision blurred and he couldn’t focus properly. No gaps. Why was there skin between the toes? Huh? He giggled.
Dean huffed his little laugh and dropped his arm onto Cas’ shoulders.  “I think,”  he said with a little grin, “we might just have got lucky.”  He nodded to a sign on the roadside, half obscured with mud, and peppered with buck shot.  The wording just about visible.  Gasoline and garage services half a mile. A faint glow outlined the hillock that formed the immediate horizon as the road bent out of sight.  He slammed the hood shut with practised ease.  “Care for a little walk?”
Behind him, in the back seat of his own hire car, the most suitably skilled psychiatrist shifted, causing the suspension to bounce slightly. The awkward twist of his body because of the way his wrists were fastened to the baby seat anchor point mounted in the middle seat was clearly forcing his damaged ankle to bear too much of his weight.
“Gabe," her disparaging tone, made him shiver. That was all it ever took. Just his name. In that vaguely mocking tone and he was putty in her hands. "It’s a ride in an elevator, not a Siberian death march.”
He has nearly finished, clearing the stubborn little patch of whiskers in the cleft of his jaw, when he swipes the razor a little clumsily and nicks his skin where it stretches over the bone. It bleeds instantly, profusely, a thick curling rivulet down his neck, and over his chest. Heavy droplets fall from his chin and splash into the water in the basin. A blooded angel. He closes his eyes against the sight, and grips the ceramic to steady himself. But it is too late, the ferrous smell nauseates him and it exaggerates in his mind, and he is lost in memory, staring through an open doorway at what remains of Balthazar, spreadeagled and gutted, a knife jutting in an obscene phallic mockery from his groin. The smell of blood saturating the air in the room.
Dean chuckled.  “You been here a long time, Benny?”
Mr Grey had returned from the store and she watched as he strolled back to Scarface, the two talked.  Then with an entirely cliched glance up and down the street, they strode towards her truck.  With an expertise she couldn’t help but be impressed by Scarface was opening the door, to the point that she actually checked in her pocket to make sure she had her keys.
“What do you want?” Dean interrupted Sam, walking to stand next to him on the opposite side of the table.
“Gentlemen,” Sam greeted. Setting the empty glass in his hand upside down on a line of similar glasses, his other hand reaching under the counter of the dark wooden furniture. Better safe than sorry. “I advise you to vamoose, before things get
Castiel listens as Dean’s breathing eases into the pattern of sleep. He tries to tell himself it’s just some a little spat and that all they need to do is talk it out, but he finds it preying on his mind. So knowing from past bitter experience that he is not going to sleep, despite how dog-tired he felt less than an hour ago, he slides carefully from the bed.
“Please, grab a seat,” her voice was clear and, Garth was relieved to note, her accent was more Home Counties than Glasgow. She waved a hand in the direction of a huge, comfortable corner sofa completely filling one wall and stretching most of the way under the front window. A huge tabby cat steadfastly ignored them from its spot curled in a large pivot chair stood in the centre of the room.
Cas blinks. “You watching me sleep?”
udachi
He could hear the answering bitch face in the weighted silence, broken only by a stern intake of breath.
“Eight months, sir.”  She picked up one of the files that had fallen to the floor and glancing at the label opened a drawer in the first cabinet and slotted it away.
He gripped his own elbows, holding himself, remembering how carefully he chose his words or actions, never crying, never showing emotion, never provoking that look of pain on his father’s face that inevitably lead to the bottle and then to fists and fury.  The burning anger and resentment, but never fighting back, always accepting no matter the cost to dignity.  The most important thought to keep himself centred that this must never happen to Sammy, he must never be on the receiving end.  He blinked, dammit too much wine.
Dean stretched slowly to his feet, as Crowley began mobilising the troops.
He sees a figure standing in the edge of the dunes, some distance away, but his relief is short lived, although the man is dark haired and tall, he is clearly not Castiel. Dean frowns. It’s a quiet stretch here, and at the crack of dawn, in heavy rain, a stranger’s presence jars. Even more innocuous, Dean recognises the dark object in his hands as a camera with a zoom lens. It’s hardly the weather for photography. He starts towards him, thinking to ask if he has seen Castiel, but the man turns abruptly and disappears back between the dunes.
Dean blinked under the tirade, not sure what he was being admonished for.  He looked over her shoulder and caught the familiar quick flash of amusement in dancing blue eyes before the normal inscrutable expression returned.
Officially all that Castiel knows is that Jack’s mother was once a member of The Collective. But, Jack has been able to tell Castiel that he was abandoned as a baby and raised just outside the city of Cincinnati in a group home (one of the many things about the outside world that he has patiently explained to Castiel) No-one has ever spoken of the woman, and Castiel does not dare to ask any of the elders who she was, nor how or why she left the compound or about Jack’s father. He has even scanned his father’s diaries for clues, but the last of them ends several months too soon. A full year before Jack would have been conceived.
The sunlight glints off Dean’s hair, showing up the little hints of blonde that remain amongst the brown relics of his youth and the contrast between light and shadow is showing off the handsome planes of his face. He is smiling into the phone and his green eyes, always spectacular as far as Cas is concerned, are sparkling and luminous where the light catches them. Aware his thoughts are turning into a trashy romance novel, he swallows and turns away to look across the mountain vista, certain that if Dean sees his face it will be
They have spent their days sharing books, cooking for each other and eating from one another’s forks, Dean educates him with films and TV, on the warmer days they swim in the ocean and chase the chill from each other with shared blankets and mugs of hot chocolate. They lie tangled together at night, sated and comfortable. They talk for hours and Dean has been there every time when Castiel wakes screaming from blood and fears. Holding him and kissing away his tears.
“I don’t think Dr Dick can get anything up, right now.” She enjoyed the venomous look that crossed Raphael’s face. Well, faces. Her vision blurred. She concentrated on staying upright, fighting the urge to let her eyes close.
He checked his phone; just gone midnight. Another hour or so, he would catch his brother just after work. He sighed again and headed for the little kitchenette, to get a beer from the refrigerator. He grabbed his laptop and powered it up on the counter, pulling one of the bar stools up to the breakfast bar.
“Sammy?”
Marcy stared at the opulence of the suite with something akin to disdain.  Having spent the last few hours in her company, as they transferred from private ambulance to medi-jet and then to the comforts of a discreet people carrier, Sam could not help but chuckle.
The clatter of the door shutting echoed through Castiel’s ears making them tickle and itch. He rolled onto his side, curling in on himself, with his arms pressed across his gut, careful to protect the cellphone in his pocket, by pressing it between his thigh and the bed. He was conscious that in the bright lights of the room She might see the outline of it in his pocket and it was still on, twist as he might, he had been unable to press the buttons while he was fastened to the door. If it rang now, it would be a disaster, it was his only lifeline and he had to protect it at all costs. He just had to hope and pray that She did not decide to undress him.
Cas and Benny are sitting side by side on the stoop steps and Benny is obviously mid-story, his arms moving expansively as he tells his tale, the sun flashing off the green of the bottle in his hand. Castiel throws his head back and laughs again. It is good to see him so relaxed, it appears that the two men have finally found their feet.
Her face twisted as she told the story, losing control of her chin, voice wavering, angrily blinking back tears.  “Jesus,”  she said with real anguish, “I’m sorry, this is your family and here I am nearly blubbing like a…”
“I doubt it, Sammy. I only just started picking up work…” he trails off, not wanting to admit he can’t afford a ticket, especially not in the expensive period around Christmas.
“...what time did you drop the roofy on your ‘colleague’?”
“I will not let anyone see it, or know that I have it,” Cas affirmed, still with a slight smile on his face.
He shakes his head, “You don’t understand Meg. I want to, but I…“ It all sounds so arrogant. “I’m the only one he listens to even a little bit, without me, he’d be unbearable. I have to protect them.”
“That’s great, Cas,” Dean says, working hard, and failing, to hide his lack of enthusiasm. “These groceries ain’t gonna put themselves away, buddy, how bout you give the food provider a hand?
"Mermaids? Where the hell did that idea come from? Don't get me wrong, I love it, but that's quite a switch away from the fae."
Any port in a storm...although to be truthful, any oasis in a desert, was a more accurate analogy for her love-life. “Miss,” she corrected him, giving him her most alluring look. “Do come in Detective Sergeant.”
“You mean from the side of the highway where you let him escape?” Raphael’s voice was low and dangerous.
Jess handed JD to him, and he dropped a muslin over his shoulder and rested the sleepy boy against him, rubbing his back.
Raphael listened with mild disinterest to Michael’s blow by blow account of the negotiations in Seattle.  He was bored, as ever, by his brother’s need to expand on low-level details.  Raph prided himself on his strategic thinking, happy to leave his brother to minor details like levels of redundancy and changes to storage and warehousing.  He rolled his eyes, as Michael began to explain some irrelevant conversation with a middle tier manager on the dockside.
Standing just beside the pumps on her tiny forecourt, Marcy Kunsberger peered at the badge flashed at her by ‘Officer’ Powers.
“Right, that’s it, I’m hitting the canteen. You coming?”
“All good?” Cas asked, walking out of their bedroom.
Dean swallowed his mouthful a little too early in his haste to speak. The lump of it hurt as it travelled down his gullet. “You’ve talked to Sam about Bobby?” He took a slug of coffee to ease the passage of the under chewed morsel.
The sound of footfalls behind her, caused her to snap her head around. A middle-aged man was watching her quizzically, a young girl with coltish bony knees and a little boy sucking his thumb stood beside him.  "What the hell are you doing with my truck?"
“They don’t even need to come in,” he tells her with an answering grin, “if they call with the card number, I can ring it up and we’ll deliver it all to your hotel.”
The silence hangs heavy and awkward between them until they risk a glance at one another at the exact same moment. The spell breaks and they both start to laugh at just how ridiculous it is.
Reluctantly, Dean got up and moved as he was directed. True to Alastair’s promise the lights died, the sudden silence as the absence of energy dropped everything emphasised just how noisy this building was. A piercing light dazzled him, the torch function on the taser, he glanced down and the pin point centre of the light was just over his heart. Dim recollections of Ephraim commenting that at least the incompetent prat hadn’t hit him directly over the heart flashed through his memory, he could guess why that wasn’t a good idea, but he wasn’t going to risk finding out.
The family’s, (read matriarch Naomi’s) disapproval of oldest son, Mike’s, choice of wife is the worst kept secret in Winter Sports. The elopement of the ice rinks favourite bad girl and golden boy downhiller Masters back in 1997 was certainly the apres ski hot topic of that season and judging by the unco-ordinated reactions from family members, the normally well-oiled Master’s Inc. publicity machine was caught well and truly on the back foot.
“Yes, thanks, Grace. Any chance you ‘n Ollie, gonna let me get some sleep tonight?”
The club is busy without being crowded. Castiel recognises a number of familiar faces amongst the press of bodies. He sits at the end of the bar nursing a long rum and coke. Every time he looks up he sees Alfie watching him thoughtfully as he polishes glasses or replenishes his slices on the back counter, so he focuses on the swirl of his drink and the play of light from the neon-lit bar in the caramel fringes of his glass.
Gabriel flicked his phone shut and turned in the passenger seat, and gave Cas a reassuring smile. “There’s quite a welcome committee waiting for you, Squirt. Kali has booked us in with the DA first thing after lunch tomorrow. Tonight, we’re gonna meet and eat and work out our strategy.”
drop.
“So what happened then?” Crowley prompted.
“No sir, we haven’t seen Mr Angel.  I’ll check the queue for you, sir, in case he’s decided to join it again.”
Jess had wanted to stay.  Knew what seeing Dean, head bowed, bruised and battered in the courtroom had done to him.  The memories it was dragging back to the surface.  She held him while he cried himself to sleep.  Kissed him softly, and covered him with a blanket as he finally slept, emotionally exhausted.  In the early hours, he woke, thirsty.  He rolled over and stared at the empty sheet next to him, and padded on the balls of his feet through the hotel suite.  Jess was feeding JD, her blonde hair gleamed in the light from a side lamp.  He leant against the doorway, letting the aura of the moment wash over him, savouring it.  The scent of lilacs (he had to give Gabriel Angel his due, the detail he went to make his guests comfortable was amazing) mingled with the subtle smells of his infant son.  Baby powder and the warm milky smell of a tiny baby.  He knew the next time he smelt lilacs he would see this image, remember the overwhelming need to protect at all costs and in that moment he felt closer to his own father than he ever had in his entire life.
“If you say you wanna go, Cassie, we’ll find a way. I promise.”
be here. ”
Crowley felt the absence of Dean Winchester like you suddenly notice the lack of noise in total silence. It just wasn’t the same without him, and the rest of the team were noticing too. Crowley was irritable, far more irritable than usual. The workload was huge, even with an expanded team they had many man-hours worth of data to process. His biggest fear that he would be foisted with some other superior had been mercifully unfounded, resources were stretched on the management team and the interference was just a closer eye cast by the senior prat, with a planning meeting each morning and a recap each evening. Crowley was, after years in the Met, more than adept at keeping the higher-ups well informed while telling them precisely nothing. He sat now, in the cubicle office, with a large pad on his lap, idly scribbling down the main points as he processed his thoughts.
“So the phone is off now?” Gabriel had known, but still he had hoped.
The door shut with a heavy click as the staff quietly left. He slid his arms around her waist and pulled her close, drinking in her scent, subtly twisting her so that he could let his one arm snake towards the trolley to grab a pastry. Kali returned his embrace, sighing slightly as she realised what he was doing. They drew apart and he munched on the croissant waggling his eyebrows. She sighed more deeply this time, her facade slipping briefly, showing just how weary she was. “Did you tell them?”
“If you’re a lawman, I’m Miss America,”  Marcy Kunsberger continued.  “I already spoke to the law when I saw Cas on the news during the night.  And they’re on their way here right now to speak to me, I’m expecting an Agent Lomax to take my statement, just as soon as he can get here, so you can just very slowly take out that fake badge and whatever firearm you’re hiding and put em down there, while we wait for the real deal.”
Somewhere in the background, he could hear excited babbling. The phone line clunked slightly, and he suspected that Charlie was currently fending off armfuls of over-excited four year old. "Dude," she said sweetly, "I have to go, we have a park date. Soon as you have something worked out, ping it down and I'll run it past your biggest fan. Say bye to Uncle Dean, Cara."
He knows he’s babbling as he explains, words tumbling over one another. He’s tired and his eyes are strained from hours of driving as he strokes his thumb soothingly over Castiel’s knuckles, willing him to accept what he’s offering. Even in the near-dark he can see the arch of Castiel’s brow. “...basic utilities and a septic tank.” He finishes. Real smooth, Winchester, finish with the romance of the sanitary arrangements.
He remembered shuffling along the corridor when he arrived, one long straight stretch with two intersections and a series of electronic doors. He had expected the escape siren to start sounding, it seemed unlikely that it would be disabled during a power failure. Surely it had to be considered a vital function. Reduced power or not. He turned the next corner and slowed, ahead he could see the change in the colour of the concrete. A square of yellow and black chevrons painted on it to denote the crossing of two open corridors. He bent double, catching his breath. There were no sounds of pursuit behind him. And judging by the slight pounding in his own head and the tingle of bruising to his knee he has done a sight of damage to Alastair. His jumpsuit felt vaguely sticky under his hand, a wide patch soaking into the stiffened cotton, rendered almost black under the weird green lights, probably blood from a (hopefully) broken nose.
“Stand up,” Adler snarled. “Arms forward.”
“Then where is he now?”  Victor said.  “Why not call home?  Or his friends?”
is a surprise, and you shall have to wait until I am ready to reveal it.'
She opened the door, feeling that the rush of adrenalin she was experiencing would heighten the natural blush of her cheeks, and give her a bright eyed, interesting look. She managed to suppress the sigh of disappointment, when she saw the neatly dressed man at her door. Although there was something mildly attractive about him.
“Whoa, there Dr Phil. I don’t remember agreeing to start therapy.”
The morning he finally comes to understand the meaning behind that conversation starts like any other. The sky is the palest of blues once the dawn colours fade away and a dewy mist hangs over the ground. Castiel has been up for nearly three hours already, he has fed and milked the goats and cows left in his care. The majority of their herd removed to the main farmstead after his mother’s death on The Leader’s orders.
"He didn't know I could properly understand, Bal. He thought I could just hear menace and spite, feel fear. Not specifics. You didn't hear him, he was... boasting."
“He’ll be drowsy again, now,” she patted Cas’ arm and he gave her a shy smile.
He stepped closer and Castiel swallowed, determined not to flinch away again. “Prince Castrated.” He smirked and Castiel glared at him. “Can you sense it Castiel? It’s here you know. Your coat. It’s been here the whole time. Hiding in plain sight, amongst all my other trophies. So near and yet so far. Does it hurt more to know it is so close… and yet you shall never have it.”
Her heart sank as Jen answered with something between a wail and a sob, the busker samples were contaminated. They had lost their potential DNA evidence at the first hurdle…
Crowley’s laughter could be heard all the way down the corridor.
Kasia was coming back through the door with a printout of the report, as he stood up from the desk. “Please,” he said, “call down to transportation and get me a car. I need to get home. I think my brother is in danger.”
The blush in Castiel’s cheeks is automatic, years of conditioning making him squirm under the chastising tone, which he supposes is a good thing, he is not actor enough to fake the response.
“Isn’t that sweet,” the brother drawled, “the human seeks to rescue you, Castiel. Perhaps your fledgling feelings are not so unrequited. What do you think, sister, of your rival?”
“Your brother was the Nighthunter’s accomplice?” Her cool professional demeanour had returned as smoothly as ever.  Her husband gave her an admiring glance.  Her intelligence,  intellect, and sheer damned strength of character were what made him love her so much.  She was, in short, fucking awesome.
'Is my riding satisfactory, then?' Dean asked with a pert grin.
“And that was where Gordy fell down really.  He picked an area just South of Sioux Falls.  And we had the nearest thing to family that we had just North of there.  An old friend of Dad’s ran a salvage firm. It was only half a chance, but we had to take it.  We all slept in the truck, he cuffed me to the steering wheel, while he took Dean out to reconnoitre the local bars.  Dean got talking to one of the local girls, who worked the bars.  She told him about the cops in the area, and that was when Dean got his idea.  He asked her to point them out to him.  She did one better she had a ‘friend’ who worked as a civilian admin, who had warned her about some operation that was running in one of the local bars.  So Dean tells Gordy, that is where all the ‘action’ is.  He told me what he was going to do, he spent an hour teaching me how to pick the lock on the handcuffs, gave me money for the bus, and told me to get myself to Sioux Falls and find Uncle Bobby.  Then when Gordy sent him into the bar he deliberately targeted a man he thought was one of the cops.”
Castiel was amazed that Dean was not more aware of his surroundings, he was a policeman after all, but he supposed he had been drinking in that absurd wine bar.  “Focus,” he snapped at himself, “this is too important. He can go for drinks with attractive female colleagues if he wants to, he’s not mine.”
He stops talking when a still very naked Angel reappears, hands dripping slightly and beelines for the foodbags, nose twitching like a bloodhound after a scent. He sits himself down delicately at the table, and Dean stows his surprise and flops down in the chair opposite. They eat in companionable silence, until Dean reveals the contents of the last bag, a pair of gooey cronuts soaked in maple syrup and coated with a dusting of bacon crumbs. The whispered “Fuck!” is the first time he remembers hearing Angel swear.
“I don’t know what’s so great about making music a competition,” Dean said, changing the station. “I wonder when they’ll do something other than jazz and fucking swing”.
That’s what she’d said. The ‘usual spot’ was not occupied with anything.
“I need your help, Charlie. You think if I get us access to the database you can do an asset search on all Angel Inc’s holdings?”
It was Sam’s phone that rang first he answered it. “Oh hi...No...Cas has been looking at the phone about every two minutes, Gabe! He’d have noticed trust me… OK, we’ll send word down to the lobby for them to keep their eyes open… you think she just missed the pick-up sign?”
“Do you want to talk about it?” Cas asks softly.
Dean blissed out with a strangled moan escaping his lips. Cas continued to kiss his exposed hole, the slick flesh around it, his lower back... He put his hands on each of Dean’s hips, so he’d know he was done. Dean collapsed on his back and Cas climbed on top of him, hard-on rubbing deliciously against Dean’s thigh.
'Aye. He says at Gretna Green it's the blacksmith who marries folk, so we can all pretend we are north of the border tonight.'
Jesus, no wonder no-one had come to find him, no-one other than Alastair had known he was loose. No-one else except Bass and Benny, if they weren’t…no point thinking on that. He wriggled his wrists, but he’d been unconscious when they cuffed him, the metal was tight to his skin, he couldn’t even twist his hands.
“No, my little tree topper,”  she shook her head sadly, slipping back into using the nickname she had given him when he introduced himself in their first Psychology lecture together.  “But he is totally pissed with Raph.  He found out about Luci.  Sam says he told you.  I am so sorry, Cas. Michael is pretty heartbroken.  Raph tried to pretend that he didn’t tell either of you because he wanted to protect you both, what with your father dying so unexpectedly. He said he was trying to prevent Michael from feeling guilty when he was already under such emotional pressure.  There was an almighty argument.  I only caught about half of it. I’m just ‘staff’.  Practically invisible, which is perfect.”
“So the buggy isn’t yours…” Crowley began. “Shit,” he thought.
Yatin has barely finished turning the key, before Castiel pushes past him and rushes in, “Bal? Bal?” he almost runs through the gallery and throws open the office door. The post its on the white board rustle in the breeze of his motion like crisp autumn leaves defying the North wind. Behind him, perhaps caught in the contagion of his panic, he can hear the workmen moving through the building, calling out for Mr Roche, and Balthazar, depending on their levels of familiarity. One of them is climbing the stairs to the mezzanine floor, Castiel can hear his boots clanging like a tolling bell on the wrought iron.
He watched the white melt from his own knuckles, as his grip on the steering wheel relaxed.  He tapped the central locking button, feeling more secure with the doors locked. His eyebrows raised involuntarily; the depth and timbre of that almost familiar voice were going to take some getting used to.  His baby bro was all grown up.
He snuggled him gently and turned towards his wife’s bed.  She lay peaceful and beautiful, blonde hair spread across her pillow.  He did not want to disturb her, but she had not yet used the painful looking contraption to allow him to share the feeding.  He settled them quietly together.  “I’m gonna grab myself a coffee,”  he told her softly.  “Want anything?”  She shook her head, engrossed in her tiny son.
Other vehicles drew into the lot as what Sam presumed were other guards arrived for their shifts. The ebb and flow of people gradually shifting as those leaving began to cross in the other direction like the different layers of seaweed at the change of tide. Eventually the activity stilled and the clock hands measuring his chances of seeing his brother that evening rounded from unlikely towards fat chance.
Officer John ‘Isaac’ Newton was bored.  He had been sat on the side of US93 carrying out routine traffic stops for nearly three hours.  It was part of a big safety drive.  And since one of his colleagues had netted the arrest of one of the FBI’s most wanted off of the back of it, his bosses had become utterly obsessed with the idea.
The coffee smelled good and she rolled her shoulders, willing herself to relax.  The first call from Agent Joe Lomax just over a week ago had been cryptic, to say the least.  The Winchester boys were in trouble again.  Or at least Dean was.  At first, she had thought it was just some routine inquiry, yet another background check after a bar fight.  Maybe a hospital trip.  She knew since Bobby’s death she was second on the next-of-kin list on the health insurance that Sam paid for.  The health insurance that Dean didn’t know existed and would be pissed about when he found out.  She shook her head fondly.  Dean was a stubborn ‘idjit’ to use Bobby’s phrase.  Lord, she missed that gruff son of a bitch.
colours to fill the empty space.
“How about romantic or sexual partners? Was he involved with anyone or was he inclined to casual encounters?”
“I assumed you would take it black,” the gravelly voice was pleasant and light. Those penetrating eyes focused on his face, as if reading his reaction. Seemingly satisfied, Castiel’s mouth twitched slightly, before he turned away again, and began rustling through the bag.
Ash’s voice crackled through the comms in their earpieces. “Point it in the general direction of the building, dudes, let’s see if we can get our ears on. Just better hope that fine piece of ass you’re chasing ain’t sitting on the mic.”
Canon typical violence
Castiel is next swooping to steady Dean’s stumble as his bad knee cracks and gives way. One hand pressing against his shoulder to stay his pitch forward the other catching an outflung wrist.
They practice for fires regularly within The Collective, they are their own fire service after all, but never in the dark and there is an edge to the raised voices that tells him this is no drill. Outside he sees the house mothers counting children, as they stand in orderly lines in their night clothes. Adults, as per their instructions, are running with buckets in the direction of a flickering red and orange glow, somewhere over the incline beyond the food hall. The flush of adrenaline as he recognises its location clears the lingering effects of whatever has caused his heavy sleep. The only buildings in that direction are on his own farmstead.
Dean’s teeth flashed impossibly white, stark in a patchwork of blood, bruise and skin tones, even after being stitched, washed up and carefully dressed, he still looked… battered. He dropped his head, flexing his fingers around the back of his own neck, eventually flicking his eyes back onto Benny’s face. Ruefully, he nodded. “No more adventures. Sounds good.”
Dean felt curious.
“On Tuesdays, we learn of the classics, Brother Alastair, paintings and sculpture in the forenoon, literature in the afternoon and language between evensong and supper.” He paused, unable to resist glancing at the Prince, who stared back at him, eyes wide, expression unreadable.
'Is it not obvious? Tonight is our wedding night.'
But the physical evidence is even more damning: It is Castiel’s bronze embalming knife that has been used to mutilate Mr Roche. It is Castiel’s fingerprints on the alarm panel in the Gallery, unsmudged and unsullied by the hands of another.
'We know who you are. It is hardly worth our lives.'
“OK, what happened?” Sam says, and not for the first time Dean curses his brother’s uncanny Deandar. How the hell he knows from a moment’s silence is beyond Dean. He thinks about pretending the call dropped.
“I know you think that my ‘gift’ is ridiculous and unscientific. I wholeheartedly agree with you. I can’t explain it, and it may be that I am just exceptionally perceptive, now, or that I am good at making educated guesses. But you need to understand, I was not a socially adept child. If anything I was socially awkward, I still am. I don’t know how I know things. I was being totally truthful that it starts as vague dreams, but then it becomes more than that.  Things just become apparent to me or I find I just know them. I’m truly sorry that it freaks you out, to be honest, I find it fairly freakish myself.”
“NO!” Gabe snapped. “It’s Cas. I think he’s gone after Meg and I think Michael has gone with him.”
On the early breaking news, before the FBI had descended, they had shown a scrappy old farmhouse, a car graveyard and a straggle of disorganised law enforcement vehicles and ambulances. Among all the chaos, there had been a young girl, grimy, dressed in clothes more at home on Little House on the Prairie stood quietly watching. There’d been no mention of her later, just the manhunt for the second brother and more and more revelations about the contents of the house. The officer was being hailed as a hero, shooting the old man dead and putting his son in the hospital. Gradually the press had got bored, especially when the ‘hero’ refused all comment, remaining grimly tight-lipped about the whole affair.
He paused briefly wondering about spinal injuries before he rolled her over far more gently than she deserved, groaning softly and wincing at the stabbing pain in his own ribs. Her breathing softened and the gurgling ceased, he glanced over his shoulder and watched a clog of blood and spit slide from her mouth onto the concrete of the floor. He moved as quickly as he could, working with his hands behind his back, awkwardly pulling her arms and legs into the recovery position. He noted dispassionately that it was her wrist that was broken as he placed it softly in front of her face. She did not even stir and he wondered momentarily at the extent of a possible brain injury, even while he tapped at her pockets hunting keys. He was just beginning to doubt she had them, when he thought he heard footsteps. He stumbled to his feet and started to move behind the door, just as it started to swing open.
Breakfast was fantastic.  Dean sat quietly as the meal came to a close, acutely aware of his table manners.  Cas had rolled his eyes as Dean’s arm crossed over his plate, just in front of his face.  “We ask politely if we want something from the other side of the table in this house,”  Mrs Kunsberger informed him as she calmly rapped him on the wrist with her serving spoon.  So now he watched Cas, watched how his long delicate fingers handled his knife and fork, watched him using his napkin, watched how he held himself at the table, watched as he charmed the old lady with his easy manners and gentle ways.
Adler picked at a piece of dander on his suit leg. “Your brother hospitalised some local thug.  Beat him about the head with a pool cue.”
He grinned at her ruefully. “It went OK, didn’t it.”
“Jody?”
"Is he right?"
The two men were almost shouting at one another, their noses mere inches apart, although Gabe’s was obviously facing upwards, while Bal’s pointed down.
That day he withdrew his daily limit from the ATM, bought a ticket to LA with his AMEX and then he threw his old life away into the trashcan of a fast food concession on a draughty bus terminal just outside New York. Plastic leaves a trail and Castiel had no wish to be found by anyone who might choose to look for him.
The figure on the sand, just a silhouette, dark grey against the colours of the slowly fading sky, raised smoothly and elegantly from the sand, stretching skyward, in perfect balance. Yoga, Dean realised suddenly.  He watched fascinated, the pose bringing to mind a leaping dolphin. The shadow and reflection mingling in the wet sand was beautiful, a Rorschach butterfly of serenity in dusky, muted pastels. French rose and Lavender blending into Thulian shining against the dark flaxen sand.  Dissected from the muted Baby Blue of the sky by the dark, dark Denim of the sea. Without thinking he grabbed his phone from its waterproof sleeve and snapped a panorama before the moment was lost.
Reluctantly he had reverted to plan B.  He would inform Laduz that Cas had gone to see college friends, and let him try and track him down.  When the time was right, as Michael returned he would hang his head and admit he had misjudged the situation.  He should have stayed home, Cas was not as calm and sensible as he had assumed… then they would inform the local police he was missing.
In some ways, he was much better off than Cas. OK, he didn’t have a wealthy family or a trust fund, but he had always had Sam, either as a raison d’être when he was younger, or now, as a grown man, a steadfast ally and support.  If he was the one in this position, Sam would have his back, he wouldn’t be relying on a relative stranger.  They had been dangerously codependent as teenagers, but they’d worked through it, gained their independence from each other.  Survived their own disaster, and come out the other side of it closer, stronger and better.
“Up and about… oh yes, brilliant Adler, we let him speak to Michael… that will work!  Not to mention the assorted medical staff.”  Raphael shook his head, simmering like an impending geyser.  “I am leaving on a business trip the week after next Adler.  You have 9 days to come up with a solution, and it had better be neat, and it had better be above suspicion.  Do you hear me?”
Dean was leaning against the soft wood at the side of the building when he finally opened the door and stepped back out, feeling better for washing the dust from his face and hands.  “We’re just East of a place called Lusk,” Dean said, pushing himself back upright and handing Cas one of the cans of soda he was holding.  “You made good time, but the old lady in the gas station says there’s nowhere to stay around here.  We won’t get a cab or tow at this time of night, so I guess we sleep in the car tonight and get ourselves sorted in the morning.  You OK with that?”
So, it blindsides Castiel completely, when the DA declares the motion to drop all charges. He hears a disgruntled snort somewhere behind him, and when he glances over his shoulder he can see that the thin blue line, making up the second row of the courtroom audience do not look entirely convinced. He doesn’t recognise anyone else in the room. His friends, if that’s what they still are, such as Hannah and Alfie, are witnesses. Were witnesses, he corrects himself. Beside him, Spengler is looking both relieved and pleased. His smile is even broader, if that is possible, and he looks even younger than usual.
He barely listens as Spengler explains the new evidence that has set him free. The expert opinions of his academic fellows, unanimous that the clumsy hieroglyphics were not the work of an expert in the field. The DA easily argued this away as obfuscation on his part, but then other discrepancies began to emerge. The florist who sold Castiel the poppies came forward with CCTV to back up her own statement that he was wearing his trenchcoat, not the jacket. Expert analysis of the alarm system showed it being deactivated within five minutes of him leaving her shop. A fit young detective sent to check the timings reported it took him ten minutes even at a fast run and even if he had used a cab, no record of which could be found, there was not enough time.
He yawns and scritches his free hand through his hair, a hankering for coffee and bacon nagging gently, but not enough to make him want to shift from the comfort of the motel bed. Castiel’s breath is catching with a soft click in his throat as he sleeps, face relaxed and beautiful in the weak glow of the table light. The surge of affection Dean feels catches him off-guard. He found Cas attractive right from the getgo, but Angel, scratch that, Castiel is… to have been through so much and still be so compassionate and so together ... is extraordinary. Castiel’s life makes his own shit show of an upbringing seem like paradise in comparison. There are parallels, of course. They both know the pain of losing a parent before they really had chance to know them. And they have both suffered at the hands of an abusive and controlling father figure, but this Leader character makes John Winchester look like Parent of the Year.
The final nail in the prosecution's case comes from their own forensic laboratory. Balthazar had fought his attacker, and this man for the DNA was male had also cut himself on the knife, probably slicing his own hands as the handle became slippery with Bal’s blood. He had used bleach to clean the bathroom, but an astute evidence technician had spotted a ring of tell tale round droplets at the foot of the bed and around his bathroom. The DNA recovered does match that DNA recovered from the rubber gloves. But neither it nor the latent prints carefully recovered by turning the gloves inside out and using cyanoacrylate fuming are on the national databases, nor are they a match to Castiel’s own. In short he cannot be the one who vandalised the painting, and someone else was certainly present and responsible for using the knife during the attack on his friend.
She nodded, encouragingly at him, “Well, I think you’re being supremely modest, your books are truly beautiful and I think many of the parents here, probably agree with me, that your take on fairy tale lore, creating such vivid and real characters, with humour and pathos is a welcome change. It’s certainly not a chore to re-read these books over and over…”
This time it was Cas who swallowed nervously, his eyes dropping to the floor.  “Cas?  It’s time for more ‘fess up.  How in the hell did you know where to find me?”
He took a sip from the glass and shrugged.
The sun is low in the sky, the shadows of the mountains stretching across the town, even while the peaks opposite gleam peach tinged in the dying light. Feeling vaguely gloomy, he turns back towards the side street where he left the Range Rover and that is where he catches sight of Claire. He sighs with relief and pushes his own regrets away. Claire might not want him, but she does need him and at the moment she has to be his number one priority. His promise to Meg that he would always be there for her daughter had seemed like the easiest thing in the world when he made it, gazing down at her tiny form, soft and warm in his arms. Little fists gripping his fingers. He’d enjoyed his role as her godfather, spoiling her rotten as she grew.
“Oh, that’s just genius!” She sighed, but he could hear the beginnings of a smile in her voice. “What are you now? Fucking Luke Skywalker? I hate to break it to you, Cas, but this motel doesn’t have any garbage shoots…”
“I’ve been trying to reach you for weeks,” she admonishes him. “I know you’re angry with me, but you can’t just act as though this isn’t happening.” She takes a breath, perhaps expecting him to say something, when he doesn’t she sighs and carries on, “You have some post that’s arrived here. The letting agency have been trying to get hold of you, they want the house cleaned out now that our lease is over or they’re gonna charge us another month.”
Dean blushed, starting to suck Cas off with ease and practiced skill, relaxing his jaw and tensing his lips. Moaning when he sensed Cas swelling, to encourage him to fuck his mouth as much as he wanted, pressing his tongue firm to the base of his cock as he climaxed and swallowing everything afterwards.
The perfect suction pauses at the noise and without sanction Dean’s hands leave go of the twisted bed clothes and come up automatically, fingers flexing into slightly damp, feather soft hair to stay the movement away. “Please,” it’s a pathetic whimper, with a hint of whining and the bastard chuckles at him around the head of his cock and Dean almost loses it again with the vibration plucking at his pleasure, like a thumb on a guitar string.
Dean nodded slowly, taking a deep breath. “Well, I am.”
“No, but I can request one… why what do you wanna photograph?”
we’re good,” she snaps “Unless YOU need to go to town. I know you must be bored of me already…”
As soon as they opened the elevator door on the last floor, two suited men blocked their way out.
Once he kills the engine he can hear the subtle sound of her sniffing. “You sure you don’t want me to come in with you?” he says softly, he can’t blame her for hating him, not really, he would probably hate him too in her position. But he can’t help wishing things were different, that she would let him offer her some comfort or that he knew what to say to make her feel even the tiniest bit better. “I have a little time before I need to head back into town,” he adds helplessly. “I think I have a bag of those marshmallows you like so much amongst the groceries I ordered …”
“You are not unwelcome to me,” Castiel said softly, dropping his head into his hands “But, you don’t understand. I… I can’t begin to explain all this if I had several days, let alone ten minutes. I am so selfish, I should never have involved you…”
Bal laughed. “You know Cas would have just gone on just ignoring them. It was me who got mad and fought back. Billy wouldn’t leave Cas alone. Called him freak. Hid his lunchbox. Ripped his pictures. And stoic little bastard just let him. But I couldn’t. He tripped Cas on purpose and when I shoved him over he laid into me and that was when Cas finally flipped.”
It was over a decade now since Chuck and Anna had been sat quietly in a hotel bar relaxing after the hubbub of a busy conference visit.  The conversation changed tone once Anna had noticed Chuck looking so sad that she broke her own ‘no personal shit at work’ policy and asked him what was bothering him.
Dean smiled. and stared out through the drifting voile curtains to a perfectly still and sunny day. If he left in the next hour the tide would be at the sweet spot between high and low tide when the sandbank threw the best waves.
“I would have gladly taken your place, the intention was to get you out of harm’s way, not...get you in here.”
The silence grew between them as they stared at each other, but it was strangely comfortable.  It was Dean who broke the gaze, he pushed the pillows up against the headboard and patted the bed beside him in invitation.
“Hey, hey, Cas. Slow down,” Dean reaches out hesitantly and when Cas doesn’t flinch away he collects him into his arms and strokes his back soothingly. He notices that the door to his room is still ajar, but Dean is fucked if he is gonna let go to shut it. Cas needs this, he has been carrying all this shit alone for far too long.
His mother had died far too long ago for those three to be involved, and someone as clever and conniving as Raph would surely not let some hired goon know his every secret.  So who had they meant?  Their father had been getting better… Oh dear God, surely even Raph wouldn’t have…
Sam shook his head. “It was Dean. That's just the cover story. You see while Dean could keep me safe, one step removed, he tried to work out a way to get me out from the yard.  But Gordy was so clever.  I was his leverage and he wasn’t going to let me go anywhere. He made sure Dean had no chance to get me away. Then one night, one of the men escaped from the shed. He made it as far as the house, looking for a phone, and Gordy chased after him. He caught up with him in the kitchen and they fought. The poor guy was weak and disorientated from the drugs, and Gordy overpowered him and slit his throat.  That was what Dean was cleaning up.  There was no way to hide that I knew something bad had happened.  The kitchen was a bloodbath.  Dean was covered in it.  So Gordon grabbed me.  Dean tried to stop him and he beat him down, left him unconscious on the floor and he dragged me out back. He pulled a gun on me and he made me dig a hole in the ground, and he told me flat.  I said anything to anyone, gave him away, didn’t do exactly as I was told, he would make me dig another one, and it would be Dean that he put in it, and then me.  No-one would ever find us, and no-one was coming for us.  We were orphans.  It was as near as he ever got to admitting to me that he killed Dad.”
“...MY CLAIM...”
“Actually, it’s his stuff, erm, well, his daughter’s at any rate, although he paid for it.” Dean swallows to shut himself up and dusts a bit of lint off the long-sleeved thermal he is holding.
He deployed his lights and siren, and called it in, back-up coming quickly from the roadblock a few miles further south. First on the scene, he’d found Winchester, face battered and bloody, leaning over his unconscious captive.  No sign of the other driver.
“But you’re not,”  she said softly, standing and slipping her slender arms around his waist.  “And we have a whole army ready to fight your corner.  To fight for all of us.”  She was right, of course. They were a motley crew but between them all… they made a powerful resource.  He sighed as she continued, “And tomorrow is going to be a long and painful day, I know, but I believe in you, Sam Winchester.  You just have to believe in yourself too.”
He knows there is a large glass vase in the back of the kitchen glass cabinet and he decides to arrange the poppies on the hall stand so that Bal will see them on his return. The water swirls around the glass, catching the spotlights and throwing bright rainbows over the steel splashbacks. There is a note on the fridge, Bal’s looping script informing him ‘back late’ and offering guidance on reheating leftovers. Bal may have been giving him space to get over his sulk, but it seems he is determined to ensure that he eats. He sighs again and sets the kettle boiling on the stove, opening the plastic seal and breathing in the scent of oregano and tomato. Setting the microwave, he starts arranging the flowers.
Cas had seen the stubborn set of her jaw easing, and reluctantly she had sighed and nodded her agreement.  “OK, Clarence you win, but I’m only giving you a sleeping-draught, nothing more.  We can’t mess around with these drugs Cas and I don’t like leaving you vulnerable when you’re alone in your room. We’re not in college anymore, so I can’t curl up next to you like I used to. If your brothers find out I’m not actually a nurse, they might jump to the wrong conclusions about how I make my money.  Besides, Dean might not be as understanding as Bal. ”
If Meg was not part of this, she had been here to save Cas, it was the only remaining explanation. Michael opened his phone and began scanning the e-mails again. The date of the detective’s report stared back at him in black and white. And not for the first time that day Michael decided he was an idiot. Meg has already been here for at least a week before this more intrusive and intensive background check had been ordered. The relief that he had been wrong and that the slight sense of distrust he had felt towards her had been accurate, but founded on a deception to protect Cas filled him with hope. Perhaps she had managed to get away with Cas. It would certainly explain the angry destruction of the searches.
The elevator doors slid open and ahead of them stood a double door, a neat brass plaque naming the room beyond as the Magnolia Room. The carpet underfoot was deep and soft, the paper on the walls heavily textured, huge deep pots held plants which, although Cas knew they could not be real, kept under artificial lights as they were, still looked green and lush. Ficus, Cas’ brain supplied idly. The generic pot plant of choice for hotels and businesses everywhere. The overall effect was typical Vegas opulence; a movie set on acid, Disneyland for adults, a living, breathing theme park of epic proportions. He wandered behind Bal. He was getting lost in his own mind, slipping into his childhood habit of letting the world slide out of focus. A state of automation that had carried him through numerous events when he was small and lonely and overwhelmed.
"Crowley, I presume? That's what I get for dropping you as my publisher and selling my soul to the devil," he grumbled.
grill weather light the coals .
Stunned, ears ringing from the acoustic shock of the gun, Cas reluctantly opened his eyes. Raphael was walking slowly towards where Adler lay. He was still alive. Just. Judging by the soft gurgling that accompanied the rise and fall of his chest.
A voice reaches him, distant and steady, “You’re safe, Steve, you’re safe. It’s just a little nick. No reason to worry. I’ve got you. S’OK. It’s just a panic attack, you’re gonna be fine, you’re safe and I’ve got you and it will all be all right. You ready to breathe with me. Just a panic attack, you breathe with me and we’ll beat it together, yeah, just breathe with me.”
“Well, if you’re sure he’s OK.”
Crowley supped at a pint. He was now off-duty and he gave a deep sigh of pleasure as the bitter hops mellowed over his tongue. Winchester pulled a face at the smell of the lukewarm beer, and attempted to enjoy a slightly flat draught of coke. He couldn’t face trying to get his caffeine fix with another abysmal excuse for coffee.
“Missy,”  he sighed, “What would I do without you?”
“So, Dad was missing. School broke for the Summer and we packed up a backpack each and left town.  We were beginning to get noticed.  Dad always taught us to avoid the attention of the ‘authorities’.  He was convinced they were ‘infiltrated’, typical paranoid bull shit. I think in reality, he sort of knew he was unravelled and they would take us away.  He loved us.  Truly loved us, but he was never gonna win any parenting awards.  He always told us that the authorities would separate us, and to be honest… we knew that credit card was a fake… they would have arrested Dean.  It just wasn’t an option.”
Somewhere in the corner of the room, a jaunty tune jolted him. The eerie ethereal glow of a phone screen illuminating a section of curtain. He launched himself at it and stared at the screen. Cas (temporary number). Michael and his ever methodical ordered mind.
He stretched himself into a comfortable position and closed his eyes. Perks of Benny as a cellmate, he didn’t even need to stay awake to swap his library books.  The only downside, there was no Vonnegut in the prison library, and his own copy was still tucked deep in the inside pocket of Cas’ backpack.
. Cas is Dean’s and only Dean’s. His instincts did not fail him with Bal, so he will let them guide him again.
There are no signs of a break in at either the apartment or the Gallery, only he and Bal have keys and he has no alibi.
He opened his eyes, jerking awake into the darkness of the room. His dead partner’s sad face looming at him from the gloom. A shaft of light cleaved the dark as the heavy door opened: He blinked in the sudden brilliance, Sammy’s unmistakable huge silhouette appearing in the gap. “Bad dreams?” his voice was soft, barely more than a whisper. He paused briefly with his hand poised on the Deco door handle.
He stopped just short of the last door, painted a deep crimson, not yet peeling but much like the others showing the early signs of bleaching under the unforgiving sun. The door was covered in dust, just like everything else, except for the brand new hasp and staple which glinted incongruously just below a circular door knob. An unmistakable clink on the concrete surface just to the side of his feet dragged his attention down. A set of keys, bright and vulgar in their newness lay in the dust.
Cas was calmly sat inside, at the kitchen table.  The mugs, he had supposedly been returning, sat on the table, a hint of steam shimmering above the blue curved rims.  Goddammit.  They were supposed to be cracking on.  He shook his head and opened the screen door.
Amelia Angel’s portrait had hung in the President’s office for the last 25 years and when she first met him Anna had been startled by Castiel’s resemblance to his mother.  The same brilliant blue eyes, and rare shy smile, that seemed to brighten the room for all its briefness, had come alive in him after years of seeing it gazing at her from the wall.  Castiel was two decades younger than his other brothers and as unlike them as it was possible to be.
“Then Dad disappeared.  It was the day after Dean’s 15th birthday.   He left us breakfast, $157, and a message saying he’d be back in a week.  That was it. No goodbye.  He just vanished.  At the time we thought he would be back.  He’d been gone for a few days many times, a couple of times as long as a week so … well we waited...  Dean went out every day, looking, trying to find him.  The credit card maxed out paying for the motel room, after four weeks, and there was still no sign. In the end, we were there for months: Dean used a set of faked ID’s to make out he was my much older brother, got himself a job in a garage and enrolled me in school.  He’s always been great with anything mechanical… in another life he’d be an engineer, designing solutions to the unsolvable… but…he never stood a chance… not really.”
He’s ravenous.  Really, really fucking hungry.  His stomach gives a gurgling growl of agreement.  He opens his eyes and smiles.  The nurse winks at him.  “Welcome back.”
He shrugs it off when someone hands him a message from Benny. His friend had rung the centre because he couldn’t get Dean on his cell. Which is no surprise. It’s sitting on the bedside table in his room, he managed to trip over something on his way back to bed after a trip to the bathroom last night and ran it flat talking to Sam in the shower. He’s left it on charge all day. It wasn’t worth leaving it at the centre, far too many people with access and potentially sticky fingers.
“Mr Winchester.  Dean.  I don’t doubt you are a remarkable young man.  But based on the evidence and statements made to me so far, I have no choice.  For your own safety and that of your fellow inmates, you are going into solitary. All your privileges are suspended.  No visits, no calls, no socialisation.  So short of making that statement… there is very little you can do to help Benny… or yourself for that matter.”
His hearing, as ever, returned first. He caught the last snippet of a conversation stilling even as he started to stir.
Spengler clears his throat and pulls out his notebook. “So, much of the forensics is back now. I need to talk to you about some pretty detailed things if we’re going to mount a proper defence. I only got some of the paperwork as I was leaving the office, so we can go over it together if you think you’re up to it.”
It wasn’t really cowardice, it just made sense. If he could keep Her trust, there would be other opportunities. Better opportunities, with a higher chance of success. Her trust was growing. She had let him go to the beach. More than that She had let him go alone. It was a sign of progress. His free will would have to stay his own little secret for a while longer. Carefully, so as not to jostle Her, he lowered himself back to the mattress.
“Right, I need you all to say thank you to Mr. Milton, and then make your way - quietly - downstairs with Mr Teague and Miss Lane so we can wait for the bus in the Lobby. I’ll be down shortly. Anyone who needs to visit the bathroom, or wants to go in the giftshop must ask first.”
“… need to tie up the loose ends… we make it look like this one and Lafitte had this whole trip to ISO planned as an escape attempt and it will only be natural to assume they double-crossed each other. Then one body or two, we can make it look like they took each other out…”
“I’ve been working on it since… since Winner.” He looked away for a moment.
They both lay in the dark, listening to the other’s breathing, separated only by the solid back of the front seat.  Cas had to admit the bench seats of the Impala were indeed extremely comfortable.  He relaxed into the smell of the car’s interior, it smelt of Dean only slightly more leathery.  Leathery.  He smirked to himself at his own inappropriate thoughts and snuggled deeper into the jacket rolled under his head to make a pillow.
“Hey Cher, you spare me a moment?”
Benny smiled as Ephraim handed him a set of very soft, very definitely non-regulation pyjamas, before making an equally soft excuse and tactfully leaving him ‘to change and get into the cot’.
Clever Carter, Adler thought.  Now we know she has no-one here with her and there will be no footage of us being here either.  He was impressed by Carter’s quick thinking, he was a pain, but it was worth the minor annoyance he caused when he worked this well.
one of Mummy’s old friends, I am transformed into the ‘devil incarnate’.”
It was all necessary to hide him, for although he was the Prince and rightful ruler of the daemon realm, his Uncle, who now ruled the kingdom in his stead had sent Her to kill him, and She had to protect from others of their kind who would follow to complete the job.
“She really does have a lot of spirit,” Roman said softly, a thoughtful look crossing his face as he gazed at Raphael.
Dean has his own phone pressed to his ear as Castiel sets the drinks carefully down on the table. He makes to walk away to give him privacy, but Dean just waves him towards his stool as he says, “I ain’t a mind reader, what are you tryna ask?” Dean listens to the response making appropriate humming noises.
Meg kept her voice light, as she responded, “Of course, how kind of him.”
He pulled it off and was dragging it back down over his head even as he moved on autopilot out of the elevator and across the floor of the car deck. He blinked. Rubbed his eyes. And looked again.
He loses track of time as he inhales comfort and peace. He is completely relaxed by the time, Bal lets him pull back, gently chucking his chin with knuckles. “Wanna talk about it?”
“Smooth,” Gabe’s chuckle crackled from the phone speaker. “Don’t worry Sam, your secret’s safe with me!”
“I ain’t a mind reader, what are you tryna ask?” Dean mouths his thanks to Cas as he puts the mugs down on the table. He mimes whether he should give Dean some privacy, but Dean waves him off and points at a stool.
“An access that won’t be denied Mr Spengler, but unfortunately as there is no visitor accommodation in the infirmary attached to the maximum security wing.  And, as it isn’t possible to bring Mr Winchester to you while he is still under treatment, that access will have to be postponed.”
“Well mainly I was tellin’ her about the mornin’ ‘n’ I asked her if she’d watched Enders ‘n’ she goes, nah I don’t watch much telly, ‘n’…”
The two men are talking quietly when he returns and he catches a snatch of their conversation before they notice him. They are clearly discussing the night before, ‘medical evidence of assault’ and ‘press charges if he wants to’. Bal sees him first, clearly amused by his sudden modesty as his eyes flicker over his choice of clothing. “Cassie,” he says, over brightly, pushing around a plate overflowing with pastries, “I made your favourites.”
“Slumming it Raph?” he asked cheerfully, smoothly hiding his distaste.  “I thought you had minions to do lowly tasks like conversing on the phone.”  He did not wait for an answer.  “Is Cas there, only…”
So what happened to change her mind? Why did she secretly ensure that Novak took legal guardianship? Ah, all shall be revealed, dear reader, all shall be revealed.
The crack and tinkle of breaking glass were unmistakable, it wasn’t an uncommon sound to hear in the lab, usually in and around the sinks, so Jane did not even look to the source until she heard O’Brien’s anguished voice. “I’m so sorry, Jane.”
The marks on the painting are not as random as he first thought, there are clear stripes within the sweeping marks, as if a very tall child has finger painted over the surface. They are clumsy certainly but the crude marks are symbols clearly recognisable to Castiel none-the-less.
Removal of teeth renders subject weakened...
“The kiss or the drink?”
“Dean refused to co-operate until we all promised to keep it a secret. There was no real proof anyway.  It’s all circumstantial evidence.  We don’t know where Dad’s body is.  Gordon never revealed it, even to Dean. So we kept the secret, between us all.  Gordon was going down anyway, for the other murders.”
A painted cross is the only break in the monotony of the concrete walls apart from the door and he moves awkwardly towards it, the chain rattling over the tile as he limps the few steps across the floor. He aches all over from a mixture of beatings and the hours he spends in penance on the cold hard floor, but his knees are probably the worst. He eases himself down and kneels before the cross, biting his lip against the initial sharpness of the pressure on the deep bruises, suppressing a low moan as he folds himself forward so that his forehead rests on the hard tile. He will stay in this position until he is ordered to do otherwise, or he will receive another beating. Thus, he does not move when he hears the door opening. His only visitor has been Brother Alastair, and if he so much as twitches when the man enters this cell he is beaten for it.
Adler swallowed.  “Roman is keeping him sedated, as soon as we can convince Michael to...”
Castiel is tired, bone-weary, he has been up since before the dawn completing his chores to allow time for Services and Communion and the Elder talks that seem to be getting increasingly longer and more time-consuming every day. Between this, his work on the farm and commitments with the youth groups and seniors he barely has a minute to himself, between daybreak and falling exhausted into his bed. This, he suspects is deliberate. It is nearly two years since Brother Gabriel’s shunning, but the shock of it has certainly made the Elder Council more cautious. A man too tired to think is too tired to question.
Castiel, held his coffee mug, enjoying the heat seeping into his fingers.  He glanced again at his phone.  It was way past the time they had arranged to meet and it was not like Anna to be late.
“Did you see who that was?” the taller of the two is twittering excitedly.
“He won’t.  I promise.”
“I guess you didn’t see that coming,” Dean joked, suddenly feeling awkward in a way he couldn’t quite put his finger on. Something about the passive, knowing way that this man carried himself or maybe his sense of tranquility or those damned eyes, looking at him from under slightly arched eyebrows. For a fleeting second they danced with amusement, before the steady, inscrutable gaze returned.
He flicks his phone to speaker and checks his missed call records, but besides Benny earlier in the day, it's Cas all the way. The next message starts playing and Dean's heart aches for his friend. “She’s gone, Dean. I can’t find her anywhere in the house or outside. Please, if she calls you, please call me back. I’m going to drive into town and see if I can find her.”
Castiel is flattered. “I think we’re nearly finished with the alterations here, there’s only the bed left for me to finish,” he says. “I need to talk it through with Dean.” They haven’t discussed yet what is going to happen when they finish renovating this place. He thinks, at least he likes to think, what they have been doing here is building a home. But Dean is yet to actually say so and Castiel learnt long ago that assumption is the mother of all fuck-ups.
“And Jupiter aligns with Mars”
“His message said he wanted some time away to think.  Castiel has always been the baby of the family, Agent Henriksen, quiet and solitary.  He often took himself off when he was a youngster, to be alone with his thoughts.  When he didn’t respond to any attempts to contact him, and his friend Laduz exhausted all of his college contacts, we contacted the authorities.”
On a whim, he picked up the transparencies of the wall patterns, showing the amended and unamended spatter pattern and slipped them into an envelope, before returning to reading the forensics.
He risks a glance down, just as a toned arm snakes over his waist and pins him effortlessly to the bed. Muscles flex and bunch under the tan of the forearm, and he focuses on that and the contrast to the paler skin of Cas’ impressively sculpted shoulder. Anything to stop himself from looking at his own flesh disappearing rhythmically into the stretch of pink lips. A circlet of finger and thumb closes around the top of his balls, pulling just shy of too hard, the remaining fingers gently massaging and squeezing. He flexes his stomach muscles once and the arm across his torso gives him just enough leeway to feel the stretch in his taint and the tug at the base of his cock. Cas is going to be the death of him, but what a way to go. He lets his head drop back into his pillow and misjudges it slightly, thunking into the headboard.
Cas smiled, hoping he was hiding just how sad he felt.  “Pie for breakfast?  Again?”
There was a scrunching sound as the receiver was obviously passed across and Michael found himself smiling slightly as the ‘young lady’ identified herself. “It’s Kasia,” she babbled, not waiting for him to respond, a mixture of pride and excitement evident in her voice. “I’ve opened it. I suddenly remembered Antman and I thought it was worth a try, so I found one of the repairmen and got him to bring me some glue and a blow torch…”
“Yes… he said you’d know him straight away…”  she carried on a stream of meaningless chatter, whilst gently gripping and squeezing Marcy’s hand.
The ground dropped away from the road edge behind the barrier,  presumably there to protect the unwitting motorist from careening down into the dip, before rising back up sharply into the bank of trees.
Dean yanked off his shoes and socks, knotting his laces and letting the soft shoes hang from one hand. They weren’t much of a weapon, but they were something to throw and his footfalls would be softer with barefeet. He would worry about grit and stones if and when he made it outside and he no longer had his shoes.
Reluctantly, Michael followed him, out of the diner and towards the parking lot.
Gabe nodded, “Dad was furious. It took all Valentine’s powers of persuasion to get him to agree not to sue. Once he found out what had been going on he wanted to drag Mrs Glenn through the courts for negligence for letting all that name calling and bullying to go on in the first place. He always hated shit like that. Valentine was adamant that we could never get a court to take it seriously. ‘You want to take a playground spat to court. You’ll be a laughing stock, man. Besides which we’re lucky the other kid’s parents just want it to go away.’ So instead Mrs Glenn gets a reprimand, the kindergarten gets a brand spanking new set of playground equipment courtesy of Angel Inc and the little brat has to paint an 'apology'. Then after all that I still had to go find you both a new Kindie, because despite his reinstatement Cassie refused to go back without you.”
“In that case, perhaps you could provide me with the files and reports requested. I can review those this evening, prior to my examination tomorrow.”
“Yeah, well…”  Gabriel said softly, so softly Cas barely heard him above the sound of the turbo as it kicked in pulling them further and faster away from their family home.  “...you’ll always be ‘Shortround’ to me.”
Finding his father’s trunk, dusty and piled under rubbish in the back of the attic had been his awakening. At 13, he had quietly devoured all the books, and reverently cleaned and repacked his father’s things. He barely remembered the flesh and blood man, and the opportunity to know him better through his possessions was irresistible. Far too irresistible to ask his mother’s permission. It was his first-ever act of rebellion.
Dean lets his eyebrows signal his incredulity, “I startled you right outta bed and onto the floor?” He strides across the room and offers his arm, pulling the man to his feet. He seems taller, now that he is not sitting, listing under the influence or horizontal. He is also completely naked and obviously not bothered by it. Eyes up, Winchester. Do not follow the blush to see how far it goes, do not.
Sorry -- --------------  explain. B---- nd I
'I know we cannot be married in the traditional sense, but in my heart, I pledged you my troth the day we ran away. Benny has agreed to officiate a handfasting.'
“Bal,”  Cas corrected thoughtfully, “his name is Bal, short for Balthazar.”  He laughed at the face Dean pulled at the name.  “It’s why we ended up friends in the first place.  Nothing bonds two kids quicker than being the ones with the weirdo names.”
“Really, Dean. You think I don’t do my research. You stood out like a sore thumb on that intake sheet. Did you really think that hokey background story was going to wash? I’m actually a little disappointed I was lead to believe that The Family was a professional outfit. But huge gaps in your record? Brushes with serial killers? A shambolic hobo lifestyle? Was the idea to make it all seem so preposterous that it was too unbelievable not to be true? The ultimate double bluff. Never mind that ridiculous car.”
Gabe watched her, with a look of pride. “Spengler. With me,” she called over her shoulder as she swept out of the room. The young lawyer jumped to his feet and followed in her wake.
Dean stared first at Crowley and then at the fidgeting form of his lawyer, Spengler.  He didn’t remember it like that.  At all. “I didn’t attack Benny.  I wouldn’t.  He’s my friend… at least I thought he was… I don’t understand this at all.”
The diner was busy. It’s popularity fourfold. It was cheap. It was clean. The food was good and most significantly, it was the only stop on an otherwise barren, dust blasted stretch of highway for over three hours of solid driving.
And then he saw Cas recoiling from him.  Just what exactly had Raphael done to Cas over the years.  His anger focused like a hot coal.  If he ever met the man...but that wasn’t very like now was it.
Dean and Sam exchanged a look. They didn’t know the word was spreading so fast about the still-nameless-Inn.
“Assbutt,” Dean mumbled, smiling to himself at the memory. He had thought it was all going so well. Was the attraction all one sided? He didn’t think so. “Maybe he just forgot he had it on him, maybe there was some emergency and he had to leave and he just forgot. I mean he could have stolen my truck, he had the keys.”
“And then?” Michael prompted, not satisfying Roman’s prediction. “What then? How do I know Raphael won’t have them killed when I hand over the drive? He is hardly the poster boy for trust and honour anymore.”
“Let her sleep,” Amy said softly. “We have work to do.”
Dean spotted the cable snaking out from the dashboard as he climbed into the passenger seat and for about the only time in his entire life was quite relieved to be sat in a modern car with it’s new-fangled electronics. You could buy conversion kits to put in old cars, but Dean would never sully Baby with anything so crassly useful as a USB port.
The hatred had congealed. Roman had no doubt that Michael wanted to hurt him given half the chance, but as he doubted that Michael was capable of much worse than a sharp slap he was not especially worried. He was sure that at any moment, somewhere an uncontrollable tic would develop in a facial muscle, or perhaps Michael would just grind his teeth.
Dean blinked and spluttered, while Sam simply nodded his head and gave Cas a thumbs up. The blush and look of amused pleasure was the most appealing thing Dean had seen all day, apart from the cheesesteak and the coffee, of course. He pushed his disquiet to the back of his mind and soaked up the convivial atmosphere. His brother genuinely seemed to like Cas, and he was more pleased than he would ever have thought possible.
It’s not like before, this time he exists in three layers, he does at times retreat deep inside his own mind, and the real world is, of course, still out there, but this time there is a third tier, a section of himself that
Raphael stared at him, waiting for the punchline, “So?”
“Ms Michaels…” Garth began.
Castiel focuses carefully on the discussion. It is important he shows no more and no less interest than normal. No-one has mentioned Jack, nor asked him, especially about his day, but this is not so unusual. He knows that some of the Elders resent his presence at these talks, disliking the evidence of his favoured status. He is often the only Brethren present and certainly the only one who attends with frequency.
A small woman dressed in stripy leggings and brightly spotted blousy sleeves under a tunic and shorts hands them a bright sheet of paper decorated with a printed present and a shiny little pen. Her name badge says ‘Elf Evee’ and she beams up at him, rouged circles on her cheeks and glitter sparkling on her lips and eyes. “We’ve not failed yet,” she says cheerfully.
Dean is beautiful, in his heartbreak. He feels a flash of guilt at the thought. He slides his thumb around to the plush of his full bottom lip. If he can bring him some small comfort and ease his pain, even for a short while, he will. “As you wish.”
“You feeling a little worse for wear son?”
Michael and Raphael ran Angel Inc. now that their father was no longer at the helm.  The effect of the stroke on his once lively and agile mind had forced a retirement that had been unimaginable, up until the day of Charles Angel’s aneurysm.
She shakes his hands again. “It’s too late, Clarence. He’s already escalating. He kidnapped Jack! He’s so self absorbed he thinks he can just go and snatch a normal kid, from the outside world and drag him back here with no repercussions. He thinks he’s invincible. He’s building up an arsenal. Inias saw boxes coming off the truck with the medical supplies last month. He’s arming himself for a war, Castiel.”
In the passenger seat, Cas lay listening to the steady engine noise, and the low music, trying hard not to think about having to say goodbye.
“Well, we can’t take them all with us,” Sam said. “Even if we had a truck, we don’t have the time to load it. We don’t know if that little explosion of power has pinpointed him already, or how long we have before they come if it did.”
Hell, no. Dean thinks. He takes a deep breath and shakes his head as much as he can in the loose frame of Cas’ fingers. “Make me forget, Cas.”
“Bal, I swear to God, one more crack about Dean and I will…” Cas pressed his lips together at a bit of a loss as his brain caught up. “Are you listening to Celine Dion?”
“Coffee?”
Alastair stood up and Bass rolled his chair across the gap from the other side of the huge bench desk. He didn’t trust himself to stand up, until he was sure he was well on the way to the kitchen just outside ISO. He watched Alastair disappear along the corridor in the monitor and slip through the first airlock door, with something approaching the mid-section sprint of Usain Bolt he threw himself along the corridor in the opposite direction and into the small guards cubicle.
Dean bites back the urge to laugh, “What’ya doin on the floor, buddy?”
now. If you hadn’t botched the first attempt...”
He raised his gaze.  “I followed you.”  He moved a little closer towards the bed and Dean hitched himself up from his pillows, leaning forward, eyebrows raised.  “I was worried, I knew something might happen and I was right,” his tone was unapologetic.
“Cas,” Dean said softly, his experience as a cop fighting with his instincts as a human being. “Look at me, Cas.”
Maybe tomorrow night when he stretches out his arms he will find a warm body lying beside him. And when he breathes in, instead of metal and concrete dust, he will smell the hint of vanilla from Cas’ favourite shampoo and shower gel. They haven’t exactly talked about the future… not the future beyond getting Cas somewhere safe anyway. He has nothing to offer. He suddenly feels even colder, heavy and dull… He certainly won’t fit within the heady circles that Cas is used to. It hasn’t mattered up until now. When they were on the run, he had skills that could keep Cas safe, but if Spengler is to be believed Raphael Angel is going down…
“Bart,” Castiel acknowledges, gently displacing the man’s hand from his leg.
Spengler shrugs and continues, watching Castiel’s face carefully for his reaction. “This report is on the evidence yielded by the forensic investigation of the gallery. They found a container in the dumpster out back. The contents are a match to the substance on the painting. And the analysis is back, well, it’s just fucking weird, if you ask me. It’s a mixture of blood, salt and bicarbonate of soda.”
Today, for the first time he could remember, he had felt accepted and happy. Until She had surprised him as he left the bathroom. “Follow me Castiel. Get in the car Castiel.” For one glorious moment he had resisted, his will to return to Dean stronger than Her spellwork. The look of surprise on Her face delighting him. But She was not so easily beaten, the spark and sting of a taser had stunned his mortal body, and Her supernatural strength made it easy for Her to manhandle him. By the time he had recovered physically he was in the car, bound hand and foot with warded manacles and powerless to break free. And now he was back to square one.
Somewhere, back in the real world, he becomes aware that Bal is softly laughing at him. “And he’s back in the room,” he chuckles.
“You’re right. There’s always time for sex.”
“Why don’t you just talk to him?”  Coleman said with a smile, taking the bag from her assistant before pulling her zipper firmly up.  “I’m sure you can think of something to chat about, besides corpses.  I can handle this on my own.  Go on, go make eyes at the pretty cop.”  And with a nod to Winchester, who appeared to realise he was the subject of the conversation, judging by the slight blush and awkward little inclination of his head, she turned on her heel and walked into the converted Victorian terrace.
YOU UNDERSTAND SOME ASL.
He blurts his news enthusiastically, but Dean’s reaction is underwhelming to say the very least. His jaw bunches and his voice sounds flat despite his words. He covers it quickly, but Castiel can’t help feeling crestfallen as Dean stomps away with the grocery bag.
Roman released his grip just as her eyes began to roll back into her head. She coughed and fought for breath as he spun her round, releasing his grip on her arms as he simultaneously kicked her legs out from under her. She fell heavily onto the sofa and he pressed himself down on top of her. He tore at her tunic and she felt the snappers pulling open, friction scorching the pattern of the trim into her trapezoid. Despite the desperate urge to fight him off, she let herself go limp as he closed his fingers around her throat again. He would find it far less fun that way, and maybe she could preserve enough energy to leave a few marks of her own. He relinquished his grip to let her come back round, intent on making her last and with feral strength born of desperation, she twisted her hands free, clawing at his face with her nails, while she used the heel of her hand to strike at him hard, catching him squarely in his namesake, more by luck than judgement.

The fingers tightened still further, tugging harder to see if he could provoke another reaction.  “You may not be properly awake, you little shit.  Certainly not awake enough to elbow me in the nose, or knock me to the floor, but you
Cas was fighting the bedclothes, panicked and frantic.  His breath was erratic, panting and babbling incoherently, as he struggled.
“You really need not worry, my dear,”  he said, and her flesh crawled. “Mr Adler has volunteered to stay with Castiel this evening so you can relax and enjoy your meal.”
Dean turns to look at him directly, and only once their eyes lock, does he say, “Hells yes.”
Bobby’s friend Sheriff Jodi Mills had supported the then 18 year old Dean’s application to look after his brother when John was found dead. Made sure the boys were safe and had a stable situation in Sioux Falls, where Bobby and she could keep a weather eye on them. It was too late for Dean’s education, but he had graduated and made a good living as a mechanic, working hard to give Sam every opportunity and the gawky, anxious teenager, given a stable home and the time and attention he needed, had flourished. Seeing Sammy go off to college had kick started something in his older brother. He’d done what he needed for Sam and was ready for his own challenge.
“Not to worry,” he said calmly, though his eyes screamed something else.  Especially when a blushing Bess froze, eyes wide, at the crunching sound under her tiny foot.  He bent and scooped up the case, shoving it deep in his pocket.  “I’ll just go sign off the ‘loss’,”  he muttered.  “Fetch another batch from the drugs cupboard.  Perhaps you would come with me… I’ll need you to sign off the paperwork.”  He gripped her arm, the pretence at calm beginning to slip.
“Of course, Leader,” Brother Alastair lisps, sliding into view. “Brother Castiel is safe in my hands.”
"You know it was a great deal, Dean, and like I told you, Dorothy and I just couldn't keep up with the sales. You've been more than generous keeping me on as your agent. Besides, your books are beautiful, they deserve the widest possible audience and the big publishing houses have the clout to go international and really push them out there. So what's the idea?"
“So?” Cas asked with a low voice, scared Dean was already asleep.
Dean nodded. His chest stung with the anticipation of grief —because just about the only thing  his father had taught him was how to grieve people who were still alive.
The memory flooded back, the hand in his hair, the hissing hot breath on his ear. “He came in my room, when he thought I was still doped to the eyeballs, told me how they were going make me paranoid, make me so afraid, twist everything in my head. Use the drugs to make me believe that Dean had hurt me, so that I'd testify against him at the hearing...then they'd bribe the guards, how easy it would be to kill him." Cas shuddered, eyes glassy with the memory. "I couldn't do or say anything...just had to let him touch me."
Beside him, Her breathing stilled briefly. He tried not to wish it stayed that way. Then with a snuffle, half gasp, half snore, and a smacking of lips Her lungs clawed a deep intake of oxygen. He had to decide. He either lifted himself from this bed and searched while he had the chance, risking Her wrath if She awoke and he could not convince Her that he was simply avoiding disturbing Her, or he took the cowards way out and lay back down, to wait here, sleepless, and silently hating everything until daybreak. The torq on Her bedside table shimmered, deeply impressed markings shifting in the moonlight, mocking him.
As ever any triggers/warnings are in the notes at the end, so if you have any potential triggers look there.  And if I've missed something tell me and I'll add it.
The resort is still a little quiet, it won’t really hit its full stride until the weekend, but the hubbub of the breakfast lounge carries the anticipation and excitement of a day’s skiing. He whistles as he wanders down the track from hostel to town, well-worn skis snug in their carry over his shoulder and newly minted lift pass slung around his neck.
They resume their leisurely walk, or rather The Leader resumes his stroll and Castiel has little option but to follow.
Newton raised his torch and scanned the interior of the car quickly.  Running through his usual commentary and questions.  He waited patiently while the young man in the car, braced his legs, lifting his hips from his seat to fish out his wallet.
The blush in Dean’s cheeks flares further and deeper the more he speaks, to the point his freckles seem to be hovering over his skin. His words jumble together and tumble over one another and he looks adorably flustered, his eyes flitting anywhere and everywhere rather than look at Castiel.
“OK.”  He handed Dean his licence.  “Have a safe journey.  I’d recommend the diner a couple of hours down the track.  Sukie makes the best steak and egg breakfast in the state and you can’t beat a 95 cent bottomless coffee cup for a hangover.”
“Nonsense, little brother, it’s the perks of being family.  Raph has already drafted in some extra help for Anna.  He’s noticed how she’s struggling at the moment, but it’s not your responsibility to prop up a failing department…”
“I know, Dean.  I saw the news report.”
Someone gave a small gasp, and then he heard the Prince’s voice, quiet and steady. “Leave, I wish to read a little before bed.”
“The bed OK?” Dean asks, covering the flush of guilt he feels at sneaking off to buy supplies. Another missed opportunity to talk to Cas about what he was planning. He fishes around in one of the bags, seizing on a pack of candles. He might only have been a boy scout for about two months, before his father fucked it up for him by punching the leader when he collected him half drunk and pissed from having to care for Sam himself for a change, but he is nothing if not prepared.
“I told you, Michael, she has well and truly poisoned him.”
“We could just ring it,” Benny pointed out calmly. “I mean a thief probably wouldn’t answer it, but if it was an honest mistake....”
Statement upon statement implies his guilt. The case is salacious enough, with its hints of ritualised killing and the victim just prominent enough to stir local media interest, so the pressure is on the PD to make an early arrest. And they are certainly being very thorough.
The momentum throws him back, his knee gives way with a crack and he trips over his own feet in spectacular style. With an eyeball rattling clatter his head smacks into the wall, so he just has time to see Cas startle and lift his head, in time to catch Claire as she all but throws herself onto him, landing in an awkward hug somewhere between his knees and his lap, before he slides down the wall and the tableau fades to nothing.
Cas sighed and wandered back through the suite in search of the bathroom. He didn’t actually need to sniff his armpits to believe Bal’s assessment, he had been in a nervous sweat for something close to 15 hours and no amount of deodorant could disguise that. He loosened various neck buttons and peeled all three upper layers off in one awkward shuffle of shoulders and arms, pausing shirtless in the doorway of his quest.
There is no welcome smell of coffee when he opens the door to the main body of their home. No sizzle of bacon, no gruff, vaguely tuneful hum as Cas shuffles round and sings along to the radio while he cooks breakfast. The room is dull and empty. A fresh squall throws a pebble rattle of rain against the windows and when Dean rounds the corner towards the back door, the first thing he notices is the absence of Castiel’s trench, missing from its hook by the door and the scattering of dry sand on the pad of lino where his boots normally sit.
Henrikson chuckled.  “You make me feel so jaded sometimes.”
She has no such scruples when he asks gently about her weight and height, explaining it’s important for ski equipment and just laughs heartily at him. “I know, I’ve been skiing since I was tiny, you doofus!”
“He was pretty devastated when you left,” Bal said softly, “but he had Michael. He sort of stepped in where you left off. He didn’t make him laugh quite the same, but he did help with homework and do all the school stuff.”
'How can you do that?'
JD burped loudly and christened his father’s shoulder.
“Gregory? No. I parked it myself, yesterday.” Her voice was suddenly alert and he knew he had her full attention.
they were taking their toll. Dean shifts automatically into caregiver mode.
“OK, I’ll do that just as you set out.”
Several of the other children look as though his being right is nothing new and Castiel tries not to laugh. Class dynamics, he thinks, don’t alter much with time or place.
The Angel family were a case study par excellence. Fascinating. A case study in dysfunctionality. He could write a research paper on them that would make the psychiatric community weep. He closed the video call and slid his cell off the table.
He had known John Winchester for years, their paths crossing as police officer and marshal. An obsessive, tough man, broken by the death of his wife, struggling to raise two boys alone, on the road a lot, and sometimes forgetting he was in charge of two children and not two marine cadets. They had exchanged more than a few choice words, Bobby and John. Bobby was not one to shirk on tough love, but it was love… and John had sometimes forgotten the need to show it, and by God, these boys, correction, men were worthy of being loved.
He pushed the heavy door wider and stepped into the warm atmosphere. Sam was hunched over the table, nursing a mug, steam drifting out of it and curling in tendrils over his fingers into the long curtain of hair swinging gently forward to cover his face. Beyond him Cas was leaning back against the heavy counter, on the table were two more mugs, presumably also filled with the sweet cocoa that was cloying the air. Dean could not help the smile that tugged at his reluctant lips, as their eyes met. Smug bastard, he thought. How were you so sure I would join you? He froze. He wasn’t expecting the concern staring back at him. Did Cas know about his nightmares? Was he imagining the understanding there? Stupid, stupid, how
No, Dean was not serious about it.
Angel, unaware of Dean’s quandary, simply shrugs, mouth still chomping on the last bite of cronut. He has eaten it with such obvious pleasure that Dean wishes he had bought more of the damn things. Angel is handsome, even dog-tired and covered in dust. But fresh from the shower, with that faint calm smile playing on his slightly chapped lips, he is stunningly beautiful. His name suits him he looks like an Angel with the softly filtered sunlight playing in his hair like a halo.
“This individual attention is all very flattering Alastair, but what exactly are you planning to do?” He kept his stance non-threatening, complying slowly with the instructions. “There ain’t much of this place not covered by cameras and I’m pretty certain this ain’t a sanctioned recreational activity.”
The young restaurant employee, from whom the jacket had been retrieved could not identify Castiel as the man who came claiming to have lost his cloakroom ticket, but describing the jacket he had left the night before in accurate detail She described him as tall and thin, a gaunt-looking man, “nuttin like that blue-eyed cutie, you got in that photo.”
“Whoever was e-mailing you Cas, it wasn’t Lucifer.  I’ve seen the coroner’s report.  It was ruled a deliberate overdose, his body was found in the grounds.  There was an inquiry… he had managed to hoard his meds you see…”
A pair of warm firm lips press him into silence and it takes him a moment to get with the program and return the kiss. “Dean,” Castiel says quiet and firm as they pull apart. “Yes, it would have been better to just talk to me first, but as I am rapidly learning, expressing your feelings is not your strongest suit. I actually meant that we will sort out this place in the morning, not… the emotional stuff. I’m not angry, Dean. I know you were just trying to help. You have done nothing but try to help me since you first set eyes on me. And this… creaky old couch, is considerably better than most places I’ve slept in the twelve or so months before I met you, so relax. Whatever you think, no matter what else happens, there is no place I’d rather be,” he pecks another quick kiss to his lips, “than wherever you are.” He snuggles closer and they lie face to face, too close to properly focus on each others features. “Now, for fucks sake, go to sleep.”
Jo Harvelle had found it very difficult to keep her demeanour calm and professional on that first day.  Her first instinct had been to throw her arms around Winchester and kiss his cheek, but that would really not have been a good start.
He doesn’t dare let himself inspect too closely why it pleases him so much that Claire likes Dean, as he watches them good-naturedly bickering over dinner with a steadily growing sense of warmth. It had always hurt him that Meg and Dean could not get along. They were, for many years, his two favourite people in the world and their niggling dislike of one another meant he always had to choose between them because more than ten minutes in each other’s company was at best an exercise in uncomfortable silence, but more often bitter sniping that could quickly become outright vicious.
She closed the lid of a heavy looking blanket box on the now folded curtains and joined them, holding out a hand, “I’m Anna, Anna Michaels, this is my house, so I suppose that makes… made... me Rob’s landlady, sorry still getting used to the idea he’s… well… I’ll start again. We’d not long left university when I inherited this place from my Grandmother and I rented it out for a few years, but we gradually all migrated back to each other, so I took it back and we all moved in, we all just share the costs.” She made a conscious effort to stop talking. “Sorry, I’m babbling. Nervous habit.”
Dean blinked, and then gave a grudging little smile. “Crowley?” he asked.
“You will not hurt him.” Castiel’s voice was low with menace. “I will not let you.”
He wasn’t sure exactly how he got back to the offices.  Michael met him in the lobby.  “Let’s get you home, Cas.  This has been a horrible day all around and we don’t want to spread even more alarm upstairs amongst the teams.  I’ve already given Anna’s PA and some of the team members a compassionate day.”
At the little passing out display for parents today, Lucas showed off his skills proudly and his mother tearfully laughed and clapped as he collected the graduation bandanna Benny provides for all the kids at the end of their lessons.
“Naomi was so determined to continue exercising that control... Even living three states distant and with them away on the circuit half the year at a time, she did everything she could to interfere and make her feelings known. I think Meg was the only one who ever had the guts to say no to her.”
No-one would look him in the eye as he walked to his desk.  Anna’s office looked bare.  All her personal belongings were already gone.
He hiccoughed and stared at the screen of his phone.  The message notification icon was sitting on his lock screen, he swiped with his thumb, but instead of opening the text, clumsy with drink he rang the number.  A sudden blow to the side of his jaw caught him off guard, spinning him around. He tripped inelegantly over a ridge in the uneven surface underfoot and his phone slipped from his grasp, skittering across the ground away from him, ending up somewhere near the curb, it’s screen a bright square of light in the gloom.
'If you think he is well enough,' Castiel added.
Dean swallowed.  Natural scepticism fighting with his steady, currently unexplained and to him plain unfathomable, faith in Castiel Novak.  What the hell was he thinking, just blindly believing and trusting this curious man?
He opened Skype, it’s familiar bubble sound echoing from the tinny speaker over the continuing documentary. He paused the video, and smiled. His brother was apparently home already. He pinged the invite and waited for the call to accept.
“I can’t imagine,” Benny said mildly as Bass who had been squatting low, almost tripped over his own feet as he straightened back up. “Bass, where the hell did you learn how to carry a weapon, anyhow? Re-runs of the A-Team?”
Benny walked into the forge accompanied by none other than Dean's brother, Samuel. His wide smile showed his happiness at being once again in the presence of his brothers, and his delight at the joyous event about to take place. Even taller than he had been when Dean and Castiel had left more than a year earlier, he strode over in long steps and embraced them both.
“Wouldya?”
All that time before Marcy’s when they shared a bed and he kept telling himself how wrong it would be to take advantage of Cas while he was vulnerable and frightened. All that time at Marcy’s when he could have left his own narrow bunk in Marcy’s spare room and joined Cas in his on the opposite wall.  “Together or not, it’s all the same to me.” That’s what Marcy had said as she patted his arm goodbye. He smiled in spite of himself. She had seen straight through his crap.  She knew. And in that one little sentence she had told him so.
“Oh Christ,” Dean choked, “Is this hulk your brother?”
'Why not?' Castiel tilted his head in question, and Dean waggled his eyebrows.
“Well, Mr Winchester, the MRI we took last night is clear, you have sustained no permanent damage from the blow to your head, so provided you make sure you check in with your GP to have those stitches monitored, I see no reason not to allow you to discharge yourself…” Dean began to shift himself and the young man’s smile twisted, “tomorrow though, eh.  One more night in Hotel Barts, just to be on the safe side.”
“He ain’t going anywhere, Missy. Even if he could get free, there’s nowhere for him to go. We take him with us and you can have your fun with him. You’ve earned it. Besides, he’s heavy and you know what Pa always said.”
“Stupid boy,” she says gently stroking his face. “You can’t. Not alone against him.”
The curiosity was that no-one so far had managed to pick him up leaving. The footage from the shop opposite afforded a good view of the entrance to the studios, a side door was covered by a street cam. Most of the orchestra had left between 6.15 and 6.45. They had resorted now to moving out in ever increasing radius to try and catch him moving away from the building. It was mind-numbing, agonisingly slow and so far fruitless.
to ask.”
The cops did try to argue he may just have an accomplice or accomplices unknown, but there is nothing but poor quality circumstantial evidence to link him to the murder of his friend and in an election year, the DA has no interest in potentially losing such an important case. And the judge rules him cleared of all charges, pending further evidence.
“It’s a pure fluke. Barts is overflowing, and Molly Hooper asked me as a favour to take a couple of ‘suspicious’ off her hands.  This was the first.  I couldn’t believe it when I saw the results of the tox screen.  It’s the same anaesthetic as Drew and Lettuce, this poor bugger was allergic, dead within 10 minutes.”
Body language alone told him Sam wasn’t buying that one.
his brother’s bitch face.
Dean's screen timed out and not for the first time this month he found himself staring at the figure on the beach, saved as his screensaver, and the colours flitted through his mind, new and enticing. "Not sure really," he lied smoothly, picking experimental mixes of oyster and silver from under his fingernails.
Sam stared at the phone in his hand. It felt hot in his hand, but then it had been working overtime. He had let it boost charge on the short drive to the jail, intending to power it up when he parked.  When the gate staff gave him the message to ring Kali urgently, his first thought was that something had happened to Dean. But then the gate staff wouldn’t have calmly given him a message about ringing the lawyer. He fumbled to turn on the cell, as he crawled at the prescribed 10 mph into the parking lot. It had started ringing almost immediately and a cursory glance at the screen full of missed call notifications was a less than subtle hint that something major was up. Gabe had pretty much chewed him a new one for forgetting to charge his phone and Jess had been very quiet, which was much, much worse. And now he was going to have to tell Dean...
The rap of knuckles on the door made him start and he looked up to see Jo Harvelle hovering hesitantly.  He gestured her to enter.  She handed him an envelope, he realised it was the one containing the transparencies that Cas had been drawing on.
“Yes you were.” The man’s eyes are flecked grey like slate, and Cas finds it hard to hold his gaze. “And that might mean that my colleagues in NYPD were mistaken, of course.” Mooney leaves the double meaning of the sentence hanging in the silence between them. Letting it grow into something uncomfortable. Oh, if only he really knew, he is messing with the master’s apprentice on this one. Castiel was taught by the best, he can outwait glaciers. Eventually, the detective cracks. “If you were in my shoes, Novak, what would you think? How would it look to you?”
Dean closed his eyes against the pain in his forehead.  He wasn’t entirely sure that there wasn’t a part of him that didn’t ache. He shifted awkwardly feeling the curious stretch and itch in his side, that he knew meant stitches.  What the hell had happened?
“How new?” Sam asked. “Newer than Dean? New enough to have been sent in there to…”
Pain.  Bile and pain.  He coughed, choking a little, throat burning.  “One. Two…” Arms slid under his armpits, someone on either side of him, dragging him up into a sitting position.  “Three.” Someone grunted.  It might have been him, and then he was retching, coughing and retching and spitting bile.  Rough cardboard brushed his chin.  “Steady.  You’re OK.  Rinse.”
They were all better off without him. And pissed off with him for doing it or not, that was it, wasn’t it. There wasn’t a single person on this planet who wouldn’t be better off without him. He should just confess to the fight and the kidnap charges, plead guilty at the hearing. If he took the rap, if Raphael Angel thought he could just hang all the death and destruction on him instead.  If he could get a message to Angel, offer him this way out… maybe Raphael would leave Cas alone. That way Cas could just leave the Angel mansion, he could stay with Gabriel, he would be safe. It's not like he had a bright future to worry about, just another forty or fifty years of drifting around the country until either his luck or his liver ran out.
He was a hot mess.  Covered in mud, soaking wet, hair and face running with water, but ‘hot’ was right.  Even in this state, he was an attractive guy.  Improbably blue eyes, a few days growth and those bubblegum pink lips, skewing sideways as he bit the inside of his cheek.  The sass drew an embarrassed laugh as his clumsy attempt to make excuses was skewered with simple accuracy.
The fire has lost its ferocity now that the air available to it has reduced following the collapse. The water from the hoses is beginning to make headway, the flames are reducing in size, licking through the wreckage almost tenderly, compared to the violence with which they blasted from the windows mere moments before.
Tomorrow, he would ask to speak to Crowley. Tomorrow, he would find a way of making his offer to Raphael Angel. Until then. He might as well sleep.
He had run through four turns already, Benny had told him the prison buildings were laid out around a ring of corridors forming a dodecahedron with two large bulbous sections at each end, bisected by one long corridor. This meant at most he had one more corner and two lengths of corridor until he hit that central corridor, running all the way from High Security through to the holding pens and the Admin block.
Dean chuckled. “Yeah, Libby is pretty cool and very clever. Just like you.” He glanced sideways and briefly caught Charlie’s eye. “I think they’d be good friends, too,” he added a little wistfully. So shoot him, it hurt that they never met.
“Give me time, Lis? When were you gonna tell me, after you moved in with him, or were you gonna wait and just send me a christening invite that had
He gives Dean’s shoulder a final squeeze and clambers into his truck. “This place is turning into a beautiful home. It’s good to see. Been standing empty too damned long,” he says, his face breaking into a brief but genuine smile, “Thought the sea was gonna claim her before anyone took up residence again.”
Castiel has known for a long time that The Leader is capable of dishonesty, but he is so convincing, for a moment he wonders whether Brother Alastair has overstepped his bounds and is operating without his knowledge. It is all too easy under his reassuring grip, with his wide charming smile and blue eyes, deceptively gentle, holding Castiel’s gaze, to believe him. But the moment passes quickly. His own father had underlined the words in his diary and Castiel has observed it since. The Leader is not to be trusted.
Adler glanced with some irritation at the bulk slumped in the seat beside him. Uriel’s breath was getting steadily more laboured, as he seeped blood and bodily fluids into the dark upholstery.  They were miles from any of his ‘safe’ places and even his contact at Lusk was having to keep a low profile.  The Feds were crawling all over this case, the shooting of an agent would have them all running around like roosters on steroids.
Being on all fours on Cas’ bed, legs spread, with Cas’ tongue lapping his asshole… wow,
“He’s in solitary!” Cas snapped out of his self-pitying thoughts, voice loud, even to his own ears and full of alarm. “Adler told me that was their plan all along, they were going to get him into isolation and then make it look like a suicide. He said they would bribe a guard and get to Dean and make it look like he couldn’t take it… You have to call the prison…warn them…”
Behind them, the main roof beam of the house gives way and with a groan and a thunderous cracking noise that echoes around the natural basin in which his home sits, the upper walls and roof crash inward and downward, the chimneys toppling last, leaving whirlpools and eddies in the smoke and flames. The blast of hot air that rushes over the ground sets plants and scrub nearer the house alight and the Brethren rush forward fearlessly to stamp out the little fires and douse them with buckets of water and kicked up sand and dirt.
Gabe chuckled behind him. “Not bad, huh?”
“Aye,” Jimmy nodded, looking a little teary eyed once again, “Soft as shite. Tae soft fur his ain good.”
Dean isn’t sure whether he is apologising for overhearing or just expressing his sympathy. It really doesn’t matter.
In the year since, he has hitched and walked his way through seven states and learnt much about how to protect himself. He is wary and careful of the rides he accepts. He has no destination in mind, no need of company, and no pressing urgency to cover the distance, so he can refuse if he doesn’t feel safe, which in truth he does more often than not.
Cas shook his head, disbelieving. He had always felt that Raphael didn’t like him much. Had always assumed it was because of the huge age gap and his eldest brother’s aversion to children… but to hear the hatred so openly expressed was still a shock. “Do you really hate me so much just because our father loved my mother? He made mistakes, but he loved us all. He always did his best…”
Sam had been sat in his car since he watched Bass walk into the prison.  He had decided on the journey up here that he would wait here until he was absolutely certain there was no hope for today. After all it made sense if Dean was released to be here, ready. He checked his phone again, willing it to ring or chime. The only sounds in the car were the steady tick of the dashboard clock, the cooling whirr of the engine fan and the occasional brush of the desert breeze against the exterior panels.
He kneels down and measures her feet and she picks her ski-boots with confidence and efficiency that proves she isn’t lying about her knowledge of skiing. But when they move onto off-piste footwear, they must go through thirty or forty pairs before she finally settles on the ones she wants.
She giggles. “Actually, probably we are, we thought you were in because your phones been blasting Behind Blue Eyes every twenty minutes or so for the last hour. So we’d just… erm… finished taking our revenge.”
He hears the steady patter of rain against the outside window and is rummaging in the hall closet when he remembers with irritation that he didn’t go back and collect his winter jacket from the restaurant yet. He grabs his old tan trench coat. It’s not really warm enough, but it will hold off the worst of the weather.
Raphael dropped a small holdall to the floor, a collection of cable ties and a roll of duct tape visible through the gaping zipper. “Smile for Michael, Cassie, there’s a good boy,” he mocked and Cas blinked against the phone flash.
Dean grabs his own jacket, and thrusts his feet into his own boots, not bothering to tie his laces. The door tugs away from him as he opens it, and he feels a nail tear as he grips it against the wind. He can’t quite believe that Cas is out walking the beach in this weather, but Baby is still safely tucked up under her shelter, so it seems the only explanation. The rain soaks his bare legs and by the time he is far enough down the sand to be have a clear view up and down the beach, past the dunes and banks of sand his bare feet are squelching in his boots.
“We were only students when we first met.  I sometimes think, it’s a terrible cliche, but I think he only had to have me because I was the one girl who said ‘no’.  His families wealth and influence were of no significance to me and I thought he was a total player.  It amused him at first to ‘slum it’ with the girl from a council estate. It annoyed his parents and scandalised their friends.”
