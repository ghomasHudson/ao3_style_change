The grief expression on Rowena's face took Dean aback. He didn't know what made the witch have that look. Was it really that she had become soft lately?
Castiel’s vessel. However, Jimmy died years ago when the Archangel Raphael went berserk at Cas during Heaven's civil war. Then Chuck resurrected Cas, gave him Jimmy’s body and a few upgrades, and his body had become Castiel’s ever since. So, thank Chuck, I guess,” he rolled his eyes.
Cas chuckled at the statement from Dean, “As the matter of fact, no. He, uh, he went to Russia with his housemates on a summer holiday. Being young and foolish, this boy decided to play a little game during his stay in Russia.”
After Crowley’s black vehicle dissapeared from their sights, Balthazar turned his attention to his friend. “Where do you park, Cassie?” he ran a back of his finger on Castiel’s cheekbone, while the younger man was wearing his leather jacket on.
“You weren’t the only one who had changed from the twelve years we knew each other. You had an effect on me as well, Cas. All the things that you said to me, you were right, I always saw myself just like our enemies saw me. I believed that I was
"Well, I'm not using the apartment anymore. Anyway, so you guys will extract Jack's grace so Dean can go to The Empty to rescue his angel?"
“Demisexual, it’s when a person decided to put hold on sex until they’re having a deeper emotional connection, romantically involved, and trust.”
He found the toilet just before the stairs to the second floor. It wasn’t a big place, but somehow was really bright, due to the combination of white lights and wall paint. Dean chose the cubicle that was furthest from the door and starts his business while playing Sudoku on his mobile phone. It took him a while before his mind wandered back to the blue-eyed man. And his smile, the light smile that made the corners of his eyes wrinkled slightly. And the hand holding his phone, Dean never knew someone could own beautiful hands like that.
five seconds in Castiel's life. Stood still in a stranger's living room, face to face with a man he ultimately had no idea who. Waited for him to provide a hint, even in the slightest, if he was the man Castiel slept with or not.
"Cas," he called softly as he parted from Cas, and met with the teary blue orbs of eyes again, "please forgive me."
After he finished answering the call of nature, and trying his best to make his teeth presentable, Dean walked back to the waiting room and picked a comic book (that was actually for children patients) before sitting on a vacant chair. He had just flipped the cover when a nurse came and called his name.
"Wow, still have the angelic memory, I see," Dean chuckled as he brought Cas closer to his chest. "Well, that would make you both Castiel Winchester and Castiel Campbell now. And, um, well, maybe, um, yeah, we started there first, okay?"
For this chapter, i borrowed a story from a friend of mine who had many experience while taking the bus to work, i had told him that i wanted to borrow his story for this, and he allowed it. Yay!
"A bit better. Anyway, have Eileen and Jack told you witches about the new Death?" He addressed Sam and Rowena.
Dean knew that if Castiel was a regular human, he might have trouble breathing from his hug. He missed the angel so much. If he could, Dean wouldn't want to let Castiel go, ever again. He didn't want to repeat the same mistake.
"Ugh, finally! Thanks, Cas," she opened the one that was closest to the fridge and took out two glasses. With a wiggle, she went around the kitchen island to sit across her friend and put both glasses down. Waiting for Castiel to pour down the liquor.
"Right," Dean quickly returned his attention to his glass. There was an uneasy feeling inside his chest as he heard Castiel's reply, and he probably knew
good already. It’s almost three, you still have to pick Cas up, shopping, and cook dinner. I don’t want to have my dinner at nine. I’ll be
time to whatever happened last night, it grew weirder for him. Although, there was a hint of pleasantness now.
Since Dean had replaced his thumb with his lips. The kiss was rough and sweet at the same time, it got better when Dean caught Cas’ wrists and pinned them next to his shoulders, then he kissed Cas’ neck again and placed several bites there.
With that second sentence, the expression in Cas’ face suddenly changed into a state of panic. “I-I’m sorry, I just have to do it, or both of us would die,” not only the look on his face but also his voice.
Dean laughed mockingly, "Yeah, you're not gonna get that from me. See, I told you I want to return what Cas told me when we last met before you took him. So I did. What I told him before, that was what I want to say. It's not my fault that you're invested in our little moment before, that you kinda lost track in everything."
Although he owned half of the share and ownership of Blue Remington, Dean is more comfortable seeing himself as the working guy there. He practically did everything, from teaming up with Pamela in crafting drinks, taking orders from the customer, right to help out in cooking and washing dishes. Just as he hardly helps Pamela in throwing out shenanigans from their bar, Dean would refuse any help from Pamela.
"Yeah, he called me Moose," Sam told Eileen in a defeated way when she turned to ask what Crowley meant by that.
“Dean, you were only visiting, not living there,” Cas defended himself, also biting Claire’s bait, “trust me, it’s different when you live there.”
“Yeah, about that,” Cas added a chuckle on his reply, “I honestly didn’t realised that the event Dean was invited me to is this. And I didn’t expected Gabriel to work about this here. It was a train-wreck, really.”
The older brother shuffled to the kitchen, and somehow the lunch that he had at the small canteen few hours back made his mouth watered, and he felt the need to recreate it.
He was about to move on to the next dish when he felt someone tapped his shoulder. For a second, he wondered who would find him here at
“Did you see him too?” he asked the kitten, and received another meow as answer. “Yes, I thought so too.”
“Don’t let my story fooled you, though,” a mischievous smile was shown on Cas’ face. “But, yeah, he’s amazing.”
“You’re in a good mood today,” Samuel suddenly appears in the dining room, (almost) all dry and nicely clothed. “Ooh, pancakes!” he rubbed his hands together, then stalked the fridge and came back minutes later with a variety of vegetables in a bowl, he then made a veggie wrap with his pancakes.
Castiel nodded hearing that, and he put a masker on before turning on the lights above their heads. He took a deep breath before looking down to his patient – whose head was practically on his lap – squinted and voluntarily opens his mouth. The dark-haired man took a deep breath before bending down a little and started to check on Dean.
,” Benny leaned his back on the chair again in satisfaction. “Exchanging text every now and then won’t distract him, will it? Or are you planning on calling him every hour, just because you’re not with him?”
"Interesting. You're just as interesting as what Castiel had in mind, Dean Winchester," The Empty grinned. "However, that thing with Billie? She didn't tell me at all about it, so I guess she was just planning to
Castiel was someone with intelligence and looks, and him? Dean is someone who didn’t even finish college, and instead, he would work to get by day by day. In short, Cas and Dean are
Dean chuckled when he learnt Cas didn't lose his sass even as a human. "Well, for starters, you can use my last name," he smiled when he saw Cas raised his eyebrows in surprise, "I mean, we can't have you around only with Castiel as the name, right? It would be, um, unusual."
After a quick check-up of his vitals and temperatures, the conclusion would be Jack was too exhausted. There was a possibility that he was now more human than before, hence the exhaustion that he felt. Sam then offered to take the kid to his room, right after Jack apologised to Dean, who replied it with a smile and a pat on the boy’s head.
That was a question that Dean didn't expect. He remembered, though, that Rowena was trying to help him and Cas to mend their fight not a long time ago. Dean closed his laptop and had his eye level stayed on his hands before answering the question.
"Hey, don't be like that," Charlie hugged her best friend, "I know this might be hard for you at the moment, but maybe now you have even more reason to investigate him. You have to make sure that he's gonna be that man who's worthy for your sister."
“No, I’m still Jack,” the young boy pouted at the formality, earning a burst of laughter from the three adults in the room. “Well, we came bearing thank you gifts for you two, for saving the Earth, again. I did a quick check on Chuck; apparently a local helped him from the lake, and now he lived in a shelter.”
Claire pouted and took Castiel’s hand that was stretched to help her walked out from the car. Later she took her uncle’s arm, and they walked into the house.
Without lifting his face from the pictures of food in front of him, and suddenly having a craving for pancakes, Castiel proceeded his story. “I went out with Charlie and our dear cousin, Balthazar, last night. So, as expected, we drank too much. The last thing I remember was dancing with Balthazar, and someone approached me.
to pass the side where Castiel was standing before the stove, instead of the other side of the kitchen island, that was also part of the living room.
Dean finally opened his eyes and found a fluffy blanket with a picture of Yoda covering him and a pillow wrapped in a Millenium Falcon pillowcase. Now that he thought of it, he didn't remember when he moved from the chair to this corner of the room. Apparently, he was still in the Archive Room. He didn't even remember when he finished his whiskey.
Dean took a deep breath to calm himself before he started, and from the look on Cas’ face, he knew that the angel was as nervous as he was. “Cas, you don’t-you just
As he felt something is definitely changing with his body, Castiel's blue eyes widened, and he turned to Dean.
The car went to a halt smoothly on a parking spot just near the entrance, and Cas turned around once more to the big black dog, that whines softly on the backseat. “We’re only going for a bit, Juliet. You stay here and be a good girl, okay?” he gave the pup a quick pat on the head, then opened the windows a little bit.
"Well, it was obvious that you were the fallen angel, and your angel was definitely smitten with the older brother. Even when they were having a hard time, they still need each other.”
Dean had arrived at his car, and he leaned on the side while still talking on the phone, “Bored. It was quite a slow day here at school. You’re going home soon?”
Dean took another leaf of tissue, “I’m good, I’m good. It’s just … weird, I usually only have allergic reaction on cats. You can’t possibly have any cats in here, right?”
Dean knew he might be being too apparent of wanting Chuck’s slow and painful death. But he didn’t care. Not now. Not for Chuck.
"No, I just keep on failing you," Jack's voice suddenly rose, making the rest of the adults startled. "I-I had your mother killed, and I'm also the reason why Cas was dead, taken to The Empty. I took everyone you love from you, Dean!"
“Apparently, we’re in the same page here, Cas, with douche-y big brother,” Sam turned over his shoulder to say this to Cas.
"That's great! That's great, Eileen!" Both Jack and Eileen did a high five over the concept, then the young kid turned to Dean with growing excitement on his face. "Do you think we can summon the new Death?"
Luckily, Dean still kept a box of doughnuts that he bought at a small and adorable cafe that was located not far from his bar. It got quite a catchy name, the doughnut place, Sweet Tricks. Dean noticed the owner sometimes popped into his bar, mostly with women, and they would have drinks and laugh before they leave together.
After the other dentist walked out, Dean turned to Castiel and saw an expression on the dentist’s face that was half apologetic and half comforting, and made Dean wonder if he told the lie and explanation intentionally?
Castiel put the kitten down next to a plastic place with rice and scrambled egg on it that someone had put there, “See you tomorrow, cat.”
So, when Cas said that he didn’t mind staying the night, Dean was beyond excited that he could have a longer time with Cas. Now, he only hoped that he won’t do anything stupid that will make this night ends horrible the next day.
“I think so,” Abaddon replied lightly, “There are people from my class who are planning a pub crawl for tonight, so might pick someone or two from there. We’ll see. What about you? Working?”
Dean ran his hands over his spiky hair and took a deep breath before he continued, "I'm scared, Sammy. The future that I saw, I didn't get to say anything to Cas. He was completely gone, and I didn't get to tell him that his love wasn't one-sided. He died without knowing that all this time, I was too scared to let him know that I loved him. And I kept pushing him because I thought it could
Dean put his spoon down and looked to Cas, “You made it as if it was my fault we got stuck with the six-hours cooking.”
It wasn’t the soft touch on their foreheads that sent shivers down Cas’ spine. It wasn’t the words that slipped out from Dean’s mouth. But it was when Dean placed a hand on his shoulder and ran it chastely on Cas’ arm and stopped on his fingers, then he touched them tentatively.
Dean frowned at whatever that means. He didn’t even have a recollection of this incident. “How did I not know about it?”
Sam's forehead made its iconic wrinkles that Dean usually teases as his wifi signal. Then he snapped his fingers, "We got the recipe, remember? It was at Bobby's house. Then we summoned Death, Cas was there, and then-"
“You’re blushing,” Charlie greeted him after Dean walked back to the common room of the house. “You called your dentist?”
” Sam still couldn’t control his volume, as he stomped forward and pulled Castiel in a bone-crushing hug. “I’m so happy for you guys! Cas, I’m so glad that you’re back, and my stupid brother finally realised that he loved you too! Oh, my suffering days of unresolved sexual tension from you guys finally ended.”
Dean felt the need to explain the relationship between the three of them, “Balthazar was Cas’ ex back then, and now for some reasons he thought Cas and I would hit it off. So, he introduced me to Cas, when I need to check on my teeth. Cas is a dentist, and a good one. So far, I’m not complaining.”
“What a dork,” Dean chuckled to himself as he memorised Castiel’s face went slightly crimson after he pushed the dentist’s glasses up.
“Yeah. Yeah, I guess so,” Dean ran a hand on the back of his head to hide his embarrassment. “So, anyway, I've called Garth, Donna, Jesse and Cesar, they were all alive and well. I’ve asked Garth and Donna if they’ve heard something about crossing to The Empty, and they said that they’d contact us if they did. I didn’t ask Jesse and Cesar. I don't want to disturb their happy lives.”
It was probably caused of her already long day at school and flight, Claire decided to go to bed, not long after Cas refused to answer Gabriel. She gave each of her uncle a hug, the she scooped Misha who was sleeping on her lap, and took him upstairs.
Pamela laughed at Castiel's answer, "I like your brother, Gabriel. I'm gonna give him a drink on the house. Be right back, boys."
Dean was sure that the flush of heat that filled his face was sourced from the insides of his stomach that evaporated and coloured his cheeks.
Cas chuckled at the hint of frustration in Dean’s voice. “No, Dean. I got scared easily, so I don’t watch scary movies.”
"You're The Empty?" Dean reworded his question and was met with a broader smile and a suggestive wink. He didn't like it. He couldn't accept that someone else used Cas' face and did that to him. So, Dean ignored the gesture and continued, "I want to see Castiel."
A soft bark from a massive ball of fur suddenly filled the room, then on the next second, the creature jumped to bed and greeted the human that was still sleepy in his position. The man instantly wrapped the dog in an embracing hug. He swayed him, like someone who missed his dog dearly after years of being separated. There was a desperation and longing in his gestures while wrapping the pup in his arms.
. That was all Castiel needed to know that he had the green light to make a move for the librarian and get him cornered somewhere for some fleeting pleasures. But, it was
Dean really found himself lost in watching Castiel’s look while telling his stories. He was more animated and comical now they had known each other more than a dentist and patient relationship, and it was glorious. He also laughed more, and varied from small chuckle to the full-on one that got his eyes closed and showing all gums and teeth, like a child.
Dean threw the famous annoyed expression that he reserved for whenever Crowley threw a mischievous sass at him, "Thank you for being so considerate, Crowley."
“Okay, I’m sold. I’m glad you guys taking me,” Charlie returned the gadget in her hand to its owner. “By the way, you guys don’t have a date or something for tonight?”
“Ah, yet you know whom I was referring to,” teased Crowley as his smile grew wider as Castiel’s face went deeper shade of crimson. “So, who was he?”
There were slight concerned met confusion in those beautiful blue eyes, “Have you ordered anything?”
Dean looked up while his brain did a quick scan of his mental agenda, and while he was doing so, Dean had his thumb made soft circles on the back of Cas’ hand. This made Cas silently took a deep breath and an equally soundless exhale. “I don’t have anything. Probably just staying at home, marathoning
The question woke Dean up from his observation, and he realised that he was too busy checking Cas out, he hardly touch his chicken. He still had one in his hand, waiting to be eaten.
"Then I made myself the soul bomb," Crowley took the turn, "I assumed that Billie was having Jack's soul prepared. When Jack exploded, he was a huge ball of light that practically awoken almost everyone at The Empty."
“Hey, Eileen! So good to have you back,” Dean stepped out from the car and gave the girl a hug, before pulling away so Eileen could see his mouth, “Are you alright? All limbs attached?”
“Yeah, but they won’t arrive until eleven. I, uh, I thought we could do something in between my after work hours and the time I have to pick them up. I don’t feel like going home in between.”
To be the receiving end of that expression in romantic matter was something that Cas thought he would never experience.
The short questions brought warmth to his chest, and he smiled. Funny how Dean’s text message got in right after he thought how quiet his place is after Gabriel and Claire went back.
the time; he had to keep his professionalism among his team members. After all, they looked up to him as their group head and he shouldn’t betray the responsibility that was given to him. Based on his experience so far, he would be in this library for another
His voice might be a bit higher than he intended to and sounded more like a croak, but he didn’t care.
Claire laughed when she heard Patience asked the question, then she took another shot of the vodka before answering. “Honestly, I don’t know which one I didn’t expect more. So, the dude who told me about this place is more like a geeky guy. He loves
He blinked and broke eye contact with Dean as Castiel collected himself and tried so hard to make his voice as stable and straightforward as he could. "How long have you been dating my sister?"
from the corner of his eye. Someone with dark floppy hair and moved in slight awkwardness. Dean turned his face to the direction of the man. Dark hair, eyes so blue that it would be visible in the dark, like a cat. Especially now that they were so wide in surprise. At the sight of him, perhaps.
“What happened?” there was a slight tone of symphathy in Bela’s voice that made Dean felt like he was back in college, where he would sit in a park with Bela and Sammy with a six pack and they would bitch about their classes and (for Bela) her boyfriend(s).
If he had to be honest, those weren’t foreign words to Castiel’s ears. Still, there was a flash of pride in his chest every time he heard his sexual partner complimented his size. He chuckled darkly before placing both of his hands on the side of the librarian’s face, brushed his lips to the other man’s teasefully, and muttered, “I
The cheeky conversation with his beloved big brother continued for another ten minutes, before Castiel finally told Gabriel that he had to finish his very late lunch soon and goes back to his practice to meet his last patient. Gabriel whined that he still misses Castiel, that went unconvincingly for his little brother’s ears.
Gabriel unwrapped a lollipop and put it in his mouth, "Yeah, I reckon," he said with a slight mumble, "saw you two kissing outsi-
The smile on Castiel’s face was as if audible when he gave the answer, “Sure, Dean. For your next appointment?”
It also had a balcony, where Castiel usually use to have his breakfast or lunch on sunny weekends. Below the loft, next to the door, was dining area; kitchen and dining table for six. There was also a toilet on the other side of the room, disguised as a giant book shelf.
There was an uncomfortable silence between the two men over the phone, and it made Castiel wondered what just happened, and how did it happened. How did the lovely dinner turned to a harsh shouting of demand in less than two hours? He was still trying to make his tired brain work when came a long sigh from the other line.
, all this time, it fucked me up. Big time. So, maybe try not to die again, especially now you're human."
After he tapped the Send button, Castiel put his phone on the table and went to make a cup of tea. He heard his phone chirped when he was dipping the tea bag, so he quickly walked back to the living room while hoping the message would be from Dean.
is why you’re my favourites. You know, for the first time, I have no idea what’s going to happen next. Is this where you kill me? I mean, I could never think of an ending where I lose.”
light prickly touch on his chin, that he chose to ignore. He had experienced such sensation several times, which turned out to be one of the feathers inside his pillow, God knows how did that happened. But this time was different, it was followed with a cold touch on the corner of his lips. That brought Castiel back from his dreams.
“Cas?” he started, “Cas, can you still hear me? We’re gonna get you out, Cas. So, maybe don’t do anything stupid yet? You know, something that would make The Empty pissed and caged you somewhere that we can’t reach. And, uh, I want, um … you-you’ve said your piece to me before you were gone, and maybe, no, and it
“No. I only remember being drunk, then I found someone, I kissed him, and the next thing I know I woke up in an empty bedroom,” he took a sip from his milkshake. “And if I have to be honest, I don’t remember if the person I slept with and the one I kissed at the bar was the same person.”
"Hey, who knows? You told me everything, you told me this," Gabriel shrugged and opened the car's glove compartment. "Sam seemed cool, you know. I think you don't have to worry about him, and he was being nice to you the whole night, right?"
"Sounds great, so I'll take those, and as for me I'd like the smoked salmon and cheese cream bagel and a
“Fuck,” Dean shrugged Sam’s hands away, “this is cheesy. Why am I nervous like this? It’s only Cas!”
So, two years later, Castiel had a Siberian Husky who was so happy that he had a little brother and a black cat who grew up with a dog. And most probably Misha had forgotten that he was actually a cat.
seasoning package and chuckled to himself, recalling the way Cas was so oblivious of what kind of food is this.
“Well, as the matter of fact, I do, Charlie,” the blonde man in the passenger seat replied. “Castiel was someone from my past, when I was in college, back in England. But, we’re on good terms now. No hard feeling included.”
Dean could feel his face heated just at the thought of the dark-haired man, and the memory of a sight before him that happened last week. Castiel went all silent before him, while his thick-framed glasses slide down on his nose.
And tonight, Cas could hardly contained himself seeing the man before him. Dean’s green eyes were soft and (although Cas had tried so hard to find another word) loving, the small smile on Dean’s lips was probably his favourite of tonight, if not today. And the way Dean looked at him … Cas knew that he could forever fall in love with that look.
The three men soon were deep in conversation of their youth days, back in college, as if there was nothing dramatic happened between the lovers among them.
“Well, if she was queer and she chose you, I will be a very happy man,” Castiel placed both of his hands on his chest, right where his heart is and gave Charlie a broad cheeky smile. “By the way, you both were the only people I would go fuck-and-tell to.”
"When I was there, The Empty found us, and it wanted to claim Jack because he was half archangel. So, I made a deal for him to take me instead. The Empty agreed, on one condition. That he would take me when I feel true happiness."
The other man chuckled at the question, “Brother not by blood for sure, my darling. Hey, that Sammy thing can be your opening line before taking Castiel out.”
“I think I should be,” Jack replied. “I-I saw you and Sam fighting about how I made Cas believe about the future, and it got him dead, then I just called him and apparently that woke him up inside The Empty.”
time for them to take this thing between them a little bit more seriously? Dean, obviously, enjoyed his time with Cas, and would love to know more about him. But, would Cas
“Good ones apparently,” Cas smiled and stepped next to the other man. “So, um, Dean … you seemed really enjoy cooking. I feel like underappreciated you for only making you pasta when you were at my place.”
"Huh. I knew that Cas could have that dom potential, but I didn't expect him to be a Nazi," Crowley wondered and clearly was talking to himself, more than to others.
Even with the train of thought, Castiel kept on putting on a thin layer of wax on his hair and started to style it. After few squirts of his favourite perfume, that somehow made him smelt like a combine of cinnamon and watermelon, Castiel took his leather jacket from the hanging wardrobe and called his niece.
“I understand. I also hoped that Cas would be back and Eileen will live with us here in the bunker. Our family is getting bigger.”
The young man walked to Marv’s, and waited on the line there, while looking at the food displayed inside the cabinet. He stood out really well among the other workers who were having lunch there, and it made Castiel wondered, where did the young man came from?
“Use your hands-free thingy, Cas,” Dean laughed at the frustration on Castiel’s voice as he drove his car to the direction of a restaurant he and Castiel would have dinner at that night.
"No, they still want you to be like how they want you to be," Gabriel answered. “Even Luci. As much as he loves us as his brother, but he wouldn’t stand still seeing you with Dean. No matter how happy you are with him.”
Castiel yawned and continued to look around. He found that the room he was currently in was considered small — smaller than his own. There was a window on one of the corners, and based on what he could take a glimpse of, it was facing the street. The flat-screen TV — the one that had his t-shirt on it — was mounted on the wall, with a shelf filled with games, Xbox, below it. Right in front of him, on the side of the bed, was a wardrobe with a
For some time, Dean followed John’s words to work seriously at the workshop. However, he still worked at Ellen’s diner while learning about Business Management. Later, Bobby introduced Dean to one of his good friends, Pamela, who looked for a partner to open a bar. From there, Dean started to build his dream with the help of Bobby and Ellen, who insisted that they would help him financially at first. Dean also emphasised that he would pay them back every cent right after the bar worked well.
Dean could understand if Sam followed Eileen around like a lovesick puppy now. He only hoped that Eileen could realise that and maybe after everything settled, they will have time to talk about it healthily.
“What are the chances you’re gonna hook up with this roommate again? Do you know his name?” Charlie started to show a suspicious smile.
Again, without looking, Dean could see the other four people he was with were turning their faces, in unison, to him.
Dean felt the soft hairs on the back of his neck were raising in goosebumps when he heard Cas called his name wantonly, as he ran his tongue on Cas' stomach while working on his suit pants. When Dean pulled the fabric off Castiel's legs, he planted several kisses and bites on Cas' thighs. Then he smiled when Cas got up to crushed his lips on Dean's and kissed him passionately.
Dean enjoyed the movie Charlie played for them, honestly he didn’t expected that he would. When the movie finished, it was a little bit after two in the morning, and his eyelids were heavy. Sam yawned and turned the television off before saying goodnight and walked to his room. Charlie decided that she would sleep on the couch in the common room, she loves the ambiance there, whatever that means. Dean rubbed her hair lovingly before heading to his own room.
The girls then took out their IDs and gave them to Dean, who quickly went through the cards one by one, before smiling and returning them to the owners, “Okay, all looks good. So, it’s only the four of you, right? Or are you guys expecting anyone else?”
What he noticed, but decided to play coy about it, was the fact that probably most of his younger teammates were smitten to Castiel. He managed to bring good looks to the table and charmed them. Well, besides Charlie, of course, and not in
This time there was a long pause before he replied to Charlie, "I don't even know I could feel this way towards someone, Charlie."
“Give it up, Dean!” Sam wiped a tear from the corner of his eye, then he slung an arm around the man sitting next to him, “Cas got the last word here. Finally Dean met his match, Cas, and I’m glad it’s you!”
"The first time we met him," Dean began while pouring another serving of whisky, "he was in this Liberace-styled house. With a smooth beat song that sounded so dirty playing, holding a glass of whiskey. He had this sexy Scottish-French vessel that talked with an accent, and he also wore a v-neck shirt and rings. He was very seductive to Cas."
The idea came to him after recalling how Cas went half-dying to cross to The Empty. That and the fact that The Empty was a place where angels and demons would go when they died had made Dean put two and two together and came up with a ridiculous plan.
From the days and nights he spent working in this library, Castiel could tell that the person behind the desk was a stranger to his eyes. A man in a white shirt and looked relatively young, probably a senior student or an intern. He had rumpled dark hair, athletic body, delicious facial hair, and friendly smile. He was charming and his rugged look was definitely nice to the eyes, yet there was an air of command around him. Which can be quite interesting.
A flash of memory made Castiel chuckled, he remembered how he and Balthazar used to exchanged surprises during their passionate relationship.
The younger brother turned to face his big brother. "I thought I had got past that with moving here?"
Out of Cas’ expectation, Sam gave him a surprised expression, “Lucifer?” Sam paused and only continued after Castiel nods as the answer, “Not Lucifer
Gabriel had stalked down to the living room, and had his whisky-coloured eyes widened, “That’s all?”
When he had stopped laughing, Cas was caught off guard when he looked at the screen. Dean was looking back at him with a small smile and soft eyes. But somehow, Cas couldn’t look away from Dean’s eyes. It was the look that could make Cas fall in love with him.
The car was amazing, and as Dean had said, it wasn’t hard to picture its anthropomorphic figure as a woman. A strong badass woman. Its paint was perfect shade of black, and the shape had its own class. Even though it probably in its forties, but it had more grace than today’s car.
The small team worked significantly throughout the next two hours. It always made Castiel proud how this small team was so passionate about the project even though they were young, and might be easily distracted with things that they found while researching.
“Thank you,” Cas felt his cheeks heated at the invitation, that actually wasn’t addressed to hi,m from Charlie and Dean.
“Yeah,” Dean smiled and said thank you to the waiter with his Corona. The teacher pushed the slice of lime on the top of the bottle inside before taking a sip. “Well, all’s good now. We planned a raincheck and … yeah.”
“Found it,” Sam’s voice boomed in the library, as he raised his hand that was holding a wooden box. “Now, please bear in mind that this device was made decades ago, or probably centuries ago where the technology wasn’t as advanced as now.”
"Thank you, Dean. Thank you for saving me," Cas touched Dean's face, and he could feel his eyes watered when he saw Dean leaned to his touch. "I guess this time it was you who gripped me tight and pulled me from perdition."
“Very,” Dean answered shortly and rose up to his feet to embraces his friend into a hug. “How are you, Bela? It’s been a while.”
The scene was showing a young male doctor flirting with his patients, when the young doctor looked up from his notes, Dean saw that the actor playing him owned a pair of bright blue eyes. The colour struck him and he suddenly remembered the pair or mystical blue eyes that were staring back at him today.
They went to different campuses, as Castiel studied Ancient Languages and Abaddon went to learn Medical. The twins lived in an apartment located in an area that was right in the middle between their campuses. Their habit of sharing morning after stories came from the days they live in that apartment, as compensation for kicking the other out when one’s having someone over.
"I know you, Samuel, and Castiel could get in and out Hell as you please, thanks to that spell," she smiled as Dean let out a small laugh. "Are there any other places that you can go to, even though you're not supposed to if you're not dead yet?"
Dean finished his meal and quickly pays, then he took his mouthwash from his car before heading to the dental practice just across the road. It’s better to arrive there early than late, anyway.
“What? Come on, it’s, well, quite the stereotype of the BDSM activities. It’s just no wonder if many people thought of that,” Castiel tried to defend himself. “Okay, except for the BDSM ambience, what else can you tell me about the place. I’m curious.”
It took all strength and self-control for Castiel to sit there and not breaking the doctor-patient ethics as he worked on Dean’s mouth. Yes, the man owned the most beautiful eye colour Castiel had ever seen, and although his exterior’s features were rough and very masculine features, Dean’s pair of eyelashes was lush and feminine. Castiel believed they alone could make Naomi or Meg asked for beauty tips.
The big brother was consulting the journal. Even though he might memorise every page, but after many years having the book stayed in the Impala’s boot might weaken his memory. He flipped the pages to find the entries that he was looking for and finally found it—a case with a mime mask that dated back to
Dean wasn’t wrong when he said that this house is a bunker, because it really was what it looked like. There was only one door greeted him. A heavy iron one from the look at it. Although it can be seen that there was a building on the back, that looked like the rooftop of a castle. Whoever designed this place must be heavily inspired by the middle ages.
"Oh, hello," the guest took the hand and let out an awkward chuckle, and wasn't a relieved one. "I'm Castiel. Nice to meet you, Dean. I'm sorry if there's any inconvenience caused last night."
“Dean. My name’s Dean,” the man gave his hand to the girls and they exchanged names for a few moments. “Right, uh, you girls don’t mind me asking for ID first, do you?”
know you, Dean Winchester. I saw you in the angel's mind. Boy, the thoughts he had of you, The Almighty wouldn't be so pleased with him. So, how are you here?" The Empty cackled.
The next morning, Dean woke up with Castiel in his arms, and he knew for the first time in several years, life would be good for him. He leaned his forehead on Castiel's and placed a light kiss there. He smiled when he heard a soft snore from the sleeping man, that sounded more like a purr. It didn't take long for Dean to fall asleep again.
“You’re trying to make me a sap here, Samuel,” (“It’s Sam.”), “let’s say that Cas is a good person and he makes me laugh.”
Who knew that the cheeky comment from Bela was what everyone in the library needed to break the ice. Dean chuckled at that note, "I told you, honey, this bar is no longer in business. But, I will let you know if Cas is
A hard plastic item hit him square on the forehead. Apparently the woman had found herself a seat and she was holding to the handler, almost carrying it to the seat and let it go without looking, made it swung
“Night,” Cas replied quietly, not actually care if his receptionist could hear him or not. He turned his head to Dean, not sure whether he wanted to continue what they were doing before or not. To his surprise, Dean had sat up on the chair, looking at him. “Sorry,” Cas said almost a whisper, and looked down to his hands. Even his erection was upset at that and decided to deny further reaction.
Cas beamed at the suggestion, “Yeah, he is. Okay, let’s go,” he got down from the stool and took Dean’s hand so they can walk upstairs.
A piercing scream made Castiel winced, and he quickly searched for the source. It was from the table with a family. Father and mother were busy with their three children. The elder one was fighting and screeching over something with the younger ones. The toddler in the mother’s arm started to cry from the noises its siblings made.
"Great. Now, tell me where your parents keep the booze, I need some drink, and I bet you do too," she practically jumped off the swing and helped Castiel to stand, before taking him inside the house.
As if he didn't have enough thought about his situation with Dean, Castiel's uncooperative brain suddenly reminded him that he had an investigation task from Gabriel. He still remembered the enjoyable conversation that he had with Dean last week. Still, it would be a lie if he said that that was enough information about the gorgeous green-eyed man before him. Castiel tried
“You finished? I’m gonna wash the dishes,” his brother pointed to the empty plate on the couch, next to his thigh.
"Right, so here we are," Castiel huffed as they arrived at the cafe that he had his eyes on since they arrived at the park.
Crowley nodded his head when he heard his friend’s plan for his darling puppy, “Good, good. But, the thing is, Castiel, is it possible for you to take her next Friday night instead? After work?” before the other man could answer, Crowley had continued, “Something suddenly came up and I had to fly off to England on Friday. I’ll give you my apartment key, so you can get in and get everything you need before taking my Juliet to your place. You can return the key along with Juliet after I come back.”
From the way he replied, Dean assumed that Gabriel was out all night and was sleep-deprived, hence the temper. Or maybe he simply had no luck with women all night.
“Yeah, we just arrived,” Alex Jones, one of Claire’s closest friends, replied to the man, “any chance we can get a table?”
Crowley groaned at the answer, “Seriously, Castiel? You’re telling me that you two had sexy time cooking dinner, and there was nothing equally sexy followed? Are you two from the past?”
Sam saw the exchange's confusion, then he turned to Eileen and communicated with her without saying anything. They only had to exchange looks, and an understanding came between them.
But, tonight, the car had an assignment to do, taking him to Gabriel’s address. It wasn’t an address that Castiel familiar of, in fact it was on the other side of town. What in the name of God Gabriel is having there? It better be good.
"Dude, your face is clearly more honest than your words," Sam debunked Dean's story, "there's no way that was the
there was a moment if confusing silence before a dramatic gasp was heard on the other line, “No, that
The taller man before him put his jacket on and returns his host’s smile, with an equally gorgeous one. “It’s great, Castiel. Thank you. And, uh … I meant it, you know. You have dinner at my place sometimes.”
These information was ended with the blond Brit fisting the front of Dean’s shirt and shot him a look that he never seen before in his friend’s icy blue eyes, while saying that even though they were better off as platonic these days, but Castiel was the love of Balthazar’s life, and he will make Dean regret for as long as he lives if he ever hurt Castiel.
“Enough with teasing Sam, Dean,” Ellen started, “what about you? You never brought anyone here to meet us. A boy with your look, I found it hard to believe that you never have any girlfriends.”
Castiel scoffed, “No, no, this is how I usually look after he called. Well, in a good brotherly way, mind you. For some reasons, Gabriel really looked after me, ever since we were kids, and before Sammy was born. He would hate it because it was true, but Samandriel was some sort of reproductive accident of our parents’.”
. The main dude was already has a love interest from his childhood, but then there was another girl came and flirted with him. It was absurd if he fell for the new girl, just because she was flirty, right?”
"Fergus," Rowena returned the smile, "what makes you think that I'm alive? I'm currently taking over
girlfriends, weren’t they?” Bobby put a halt on Dean’s train of thoughts, “So, which one of them who’d you think would be good to meet us?”
"Well, you're living in the bunker now, you're one of us, and I'm sure this reality will feel better."
“Very. Finally, I decided to tell my father that he might need a better manager for the factory, and I was out of the question. Thankfully, he understood,” Bela sighed, and before Sam could carry on asking about her work, she had called a waiter to make an order.”Have you boys decided?”
“I have watched you die six times, Cas, and that’s more than enough. I don’t mean to add more of that to the list,” the look in Dean’s eyes had now challenged the man before him, and he didn’t intend to let Cas cut him again. “The first one was when Lucifer possessed Sammy, and he blew you up after you Molotov Michael. Then when you swallowed the whole leviathan in Purgatory, I even lost you in Purgatory. Next, it was when the Reaper April killed you as a human, then Lucifer killed you again, and now, The Empty. I couldn’t-I
There was a pang of disappointment inside Cas, but on the other hand, he also felt glad that he can get inside and be under his warm blanket. “Go then,” Cas replied with a smile. “I’ll go to bed, so I can get warm.”
“Fair enough. Jesus, I don’t think I could get used to that name, “Dean had his head hung down, as if his future existence was condemned by the name Lucifer.
Dean’s matter of fact answer once again put the smile on Cas’ face. It felt like the more they talked about practically anything and everything, the more Cas found it easier to enjoy and laugh at Dean’s words.
Sam sighed dramatically and closed the box again before answering, “Dean will have flashbacks on everything that happened before Michael possessed him, and it won't be the good memories.”
It was like slow motion scene in movies when Dean licked his lips and lifted up his hand to push Castiel’s glasses up lightly, and made the dentists swallowed.
A meaningful-yet-confused look from Cas brought him back to reality where Cas would need the bathroom to his own.
Cas looked up to Sam, “I was, uh, I’m Dean’s dentist. Balthazar here recommended me to Dean. So, that’s how we became friends,” the dentist closed his answer with a smiled that was addressed to Dean.
Castiel bumped himself back to the chair, huffing out breath that he didn’t know he was holding. He knew that the only thing that stopped anything to happen just before was the fact that they were doctor and patient. Given they weren’t, he didn’t dare to imagine what could happened between him and the very fine man who was just in his office.
“Come on, we’ll walk you to the door,” Dean took one bag from her hand and pointed to Charlie’s house.
He knew that the brunch time together probably was the relaxing time he needed. He also highly appreciated the meal cooked by Sam and Eileen. However, Dean couldn’t help thinking that he needed the brunch time to quickly end so they could look into the lore and books on how to help Cas, even though his all-night reading didn’t come to fruition.
I'm gonna give you a major update now, with FIVE chapters! And each of them are ridiculously long! Eep!
“What? Yeah, why?” Dean pedalled the gas, and the black Impala rolled smoothly past the traffic light.
,” came the answer from Dean, that made Cas sort of proud of himself for managing to distracted Dean from the cold weather and Cas’ lack of warm clothing, “the one with big grey cat-like bear and cat-bus. It was cute. We’re now on a break for, uh, something with a dragon on it. Dragon got a wolf head, and a little girl.”
Dean smiled to Cas, "My word, Castiel. Did they teach that filth in Heaven?" he then let out a burst of laughter when he heard Cas groaned in frustration. "Don't worry, my angel, I'm gonna make you feel good, that you'll be glad you're a human now."
The words from Crowley had Dean opened his eyes. He was now sitting on a chair, to his surprise, and he didn't remember when he did that. Dean blinked several times to return his clear sight. He saw that he was sitting on one of the library chairs, and as he looked up and Crowley was smiling at him and Cas.
Dean groaned at that, “I had told you, Sammy, if you want to stay, just stay. But if you weren’t feeling comfortable, you’re free to go somewhere. Watch TV in your room or anything.”
The message made Dean felt a little bit uneasy, then he remembered that Castiel always have a full schedule at his practice.
As he drove, Dean couldn’t stop his mind from working extra hard, replaying everything that had happened between him and Cas. He also couldn’t help to curse himself repeatedly, on how he
Right after Rowena finished her statement, Dean looked like he just had a light bulb inside his head, flickered aggressively for the second time that day. A moment later, the look on his face expressed that the bulb finally shone brightly.
He didn’t mean to say it as hard as it came out, but the change of look on Cas’ face quickly made Dean realised that he must be a little bit to hard on the comment.
"Oh, yeah, that tan dog you put on the backseat of Baby. Also, I get that it was weird that your death was so lonely. But,
The beast of a car came to a halt on the side road. After the engine was killed, the brothers came out from each side of the vehicle. The look on the big brother's face could only be described as yearning, if not
"True, that I'll be flying back here next month," Gabriel started, "but not true about driving. I can make Bela driving me."
“Dude, I don’t know. It was his ex, he might as well pay with a quickie or a blowjob for all I know. Have you
Dean wondered if Jack could do the same miracle as before, woke Cas at The Empty and brought him back here, to him. He knew that it was probably asking too much of Jack, now that he was currently trying to resurrect the whole Earth population. Maybe he could ask Sam and Jack to help him find a way to get to The Empty to rescue Cas. Then if everything failed, he’d offer his idea.
to be in the area, and he got hungry, and decided to drop by here to have lunch? Will Dean see him again? Where?
feels and show him that Cas shouldn’t have to worry that what he wanted was something that he could never have. Even when he, or Cas, never realised it, Dean had
Dean wasn’t even halfway through the first chapter of the book, and he was already on his third bottle of beer.
As Jack closed his eyes to concentrate, a rush of excitement and anxiety quickly filled Dean’s mind.
After they dropped Balthazar off at his apartment, Sam, Dean, and Charlie went back to the bunker. Charlie quickly called the bathroom, saying she wanted to take a shower first. Quietly, Dean felt grateful with that, because he knew that Sam would like to ask him some questions about Cas.
Castiel chuckled at the response, and then he turned to the rest of the team, who were all gathered on one laptop and suppressed their laughter at whatever it is they’re watching. “Hey, guys, sorry to interrupt, where are we with these tablets?”
“Good, we’re staying at Uncle Cassie’ place here. The place was wonderful, I love the view from the balcony. Have you been there, Dean?”
Dean made his way to the school maintenance, assisted with two male students to ask if his class could borrow a ladder. And since he had an issue with heights, Dean made the students “who made the ball stuck up there” to climb the ladder and get it down.
It seemed that the look on Castiel’s that night had made Dean’s happiness and ability to string coherent topics of conversation conflicting heavily. Here he was, looking for any entertaining talk that could made Castiel’s face beamed.
It took him few seconds to gather himself and gave the other man a hesitated smile before standing up to walked out from the canteen. Only to be stopped by a small kitten next to him, meowing for food. He smiled softly and scooped the feline while walking to the direction of motorcycle parking lot.
Of course, he wouldn’t jump on Cas when they finally reunited. Or the other way around. They were both six-foot-tall well-built grown-up men, Dean could strain a muscle catching Cas jumping on him, and Dean wasn't that confident of Cas' mortal power since he lost his power and all that.
“Nothing, Cas. just asking,” Dean paused when he saw Sammy’s towering figure walked into the restaurant with a beautiful young woman. “Cas, I hate to do this, but Sammy’s here. Mind if we talk again later? I’ll call or text you, whichever more convenient to you.”
rude to you?” teased Dean, that earned a pout from the woman. “Okay, yes, that was the person who supposed to join me – and Sammy, maybe – for dinner at home.”
As she saw her big brother looked vulnerable, Abaddon reached out her hand to take Castiel’s. “Hey, you know I’ll be there for you no matter what, right? Me and Gabriel will
The other man was staring back at Castiel as if seeing something alien, that was beyond his understanding, but it made him even looked more beautiful.
The man with the name chuckled at that order, and continued finishing his dessert. It didn’t take long before he threw another question, “Have you made an appointment to get it checked?”
He smiled at Cas' sleeping face. He still looked angelic when he slept. Dean fixed the blanket that was now only covering Cas' legs, and he ran his fingers over the fluffy dark hair. He smiled when there was no reaction from Cas, seemed like the angel was really exhausted from all of the excitement today. Dean bent down to plant a kiss on top of Cas' head, but when he turned around and about to lay down on the next bed, he felt his pants were tugged softly.
Castiel chuckled at that, "Thanks, Baz," he said before letting the blonde kissed his cheek and walked to the Impala afterwards.
“Why would he say no? You’ll be in good hands. I’ll talk to him later,” Castiel slung his arm around Claire’s shoulders.
He threw another look to the librarian, and this time the man behind the desk noticed Castiel. And he smiled
“No,” she finally replied. “I just called dibs,” she answered before hissing and bared her fangs widely.
The statement brought warmth to Dean's chest, and groin, then he pulled Cas' t-shirt over his head before he threw it somewhere to the floor without looking. He might have pushed this particular sexual tension with Cas for too long, now that he had the chance to unleash it, Dean felt like he just wanted to devour Cas.
Claire’s response drew a small laugh from Dean, “Yeah, no, sorry. I took your orders, and you had quite some drinks with you tonight, girls. So, either I’m calling a cab or I’m going to drive you all home by myself.”
The woman who sat before her laptop paused and looked at the strange man in her house. “I still couldn’t get over the fact that Chuck was God. I dated him, I
Cas chuckled, “You already told me that, Dean, and I don’t mind. Really. In fact, if Claire and Gabriel were still here, I will definitely bring them along.”
Dean smiled at the sight next to him. “You had bonded well with her, eh?” he opened the door and climbed out from the car, followed by his passenger.
“Dean, I’m cooking bacon,” Eileen smiled mischievously, “you better come to the kitchen soon, or I’ll finish it.”
“Something feels funny on my teeth, I’m going to check it today,” answered Dean and took the newspaper from the edge of the coffee table before him, “and Balz recommended his ex’s practice, not far from here.”
"Yeah. Thanks, Charlie," he received the beer with a sigh. Castiel opened and took a sip before he went to silent mode again. He felt a soft jolt next to him when Charlie joined him on the swing, and she started to sway back and forth slowly.
The young dentist took a long sigh when, for the sixteenth time in the past half hour, the two gentlemen on his left side mention a certain name of a jewellery ring-stone, which was a current favourite among men, said to bring good luck to the wearer. Castiel scoffed and unconsciously plays with the silver ring on his finger.
“Yeah, I remember there was Sammy, and another blonde chick, I didn’t know who she was. Probably someone from my memory. Not important. I remember that we have to hunt and kill something before midnight, or the giant dog will come and kill me. And, uh, midnight came, we failed to kill whatever it was that we need to kill, and the blonde chick suddenly went mental and she released the hound to me. It, uh, it attacked me to a table, exactly like before, and started ripping my body apart.”
Crowley agreed with his mother, which is surprising for the Winchesters. He also said that he'd returned to Death's Chamber to see what he can do with the place. He even gave Dean a new Death's Door key, just in case he'd needed it since the last one they had was destroyed by Billie.
Dean laughed at Cas' ultimatum, "Yeah. I have a feeling that I won't need to do that again in the future. Also, I have a story about Ma'lak Box that I want to tell you later. So, deal? No secrets, no self demising whatsoever?"
If he had to be honest, Cas might thought that if Dean was trying to make Cas smile during their dinner yesterday, then today he was on a mission to make him blush. Cas decided to shrug it off, since he could be wrong.
“I’m sorry, Dean. Clearly I’m not that experienced in going to a bar,” Claire raised her hands. “Especially a place like this. Okay, girls, be honest to Dean here, what do you think of this place?”
“No, thanks. I love my blood pressure as how it is,” Castiel continues driving to the direction of the airport, and felt the huge urge to kick Gabriel out from the car when he heard his phone chirped a text message notification, and the shorter man grabbed his phone faster than he did. “Dammit, Gabriel!”
Happiness took over Dean's emotions as he pulled Cas closer to him and again wrapped the smaller man in a hug. Something that he'd been longing to do since he thought he lost him a few days ago.
The blonde let out a long exhale and wait for the door to open. And hoping that he won’t get any heart attack or something, since it was beating so fast.
Balthazar gave the two men, who were still staring at each other, an understanding smile before he went to the different way than Sam and Charlie.
“Oh,” Cas let Misha jumped off his arm, “of course, Dean. I, um, I’ll get my stuffs. Juliet’s stuffs, I mean.”
Dean sneezed before looking at the folder with his name on it, “That sounds good, but is it alright if you make it after hours? After four?”
Dean cleared his throat and called, “Cas”, and without waiting for a reply, he continued, “I, uh, I’m gonna look in the closet if that’s okay to you?”
“No,” Cas shook his head and laugh, his eyes narrowed and there were soft wrinkles on the corners of his eyes.
Sam and Eileen decided that they'll go shopping for dinner since Dean had done most of the hard work on today's mission. Eileen even said that they won't come knocking, but they will send a text when dinner is ready.
The phone switched from Dean’s face to a room filled with chairs and desks, it looked like a teacher’s common room, based on the paper piles over the desks, and the coffee table with low couches around it for staffs to lounge between classes. The view on Cas’ phone started to move, first it was moving slightly upwards, showing that Dean was standing up from his seat, then the room started to spin slowly.
"Yeah, now you're human, you will have a hard time controlling your boner, Cas. But, lucky for you, I know just how to handle that," after he said that, Dean crawled downwards and disappeared into the blanket.
The claim took Castiel by surprise that he couldn’t even respond coherently to Charlie. All he could do was opening and closing his mouth in protest, and probably resembling a fish who was thrown out of water. It took him another three seconds to finally be able to respond, “I was only
“Yeah, we’re good,” the shorter man walked closer to the host, and stood next to him. “Thank you, though, for being so thoughtful.”
Dean chuckled, “I know, Cas. It’s just … it’s really clear, the dream. Dunno, maybe that was me in my previous life or something.”
The man who was asked a question let out another sigh, and looked up hopelessly to the sky, “Kale, cabbage, celery, you name it, all those green things, he loves them all,” Dean walked into the restaurant, and looked around for tables, “you wanna sit near the window, Cas? Or balcony?”
“Hello, boys,” Rowena greeted them cheerfully. She looked fabulous as always in her Victorian gothic black and blood-red dress, and her hair was let down loosely in perfect curls. Hell had probably given her positive effects that particularly suits her appearance and beauty. “Why are you both on the floor?”
“Sammy, you got plan for tomorrow?” Dean asked as he sat across his brother, who started picking the bigger chicken pieces for himself.
She was tall and had the perfect body shape. Her brunette hair flowed down flawlessly. She wore a black long sleeve top with a wide v-neck that showed off one of her shoulders and most of her chest. Also a perfect combo of dark denim and knee-high suede boots that made her even more effortlessly sexy.
alone is enough, Dean. For someone like him, who kept his principles right, and he’s protecting her. Not people are like you who would easily-”
" he didn't even get to finish his sentence, and already Cas had a handful of a three-year-old teenager hugging him like there's no tomorrow.
Crowley was about to say something to the statement, but he felt a stinging pinch on his elbow that came from Rowena, who did it quietly, "Mother!"
There was an uncomfortable silence on the phone between them. Had this be a conversation with any of his former lovers, Dean would lined off as fast as he could out of annoyance. But, he couldn’t do that with
“My girlfriend suddenly have to go home to her parents’ house, and Dean … I don’t know. Dean, were you planning to take anyone before?” Sam asked in such cheeky tone.
“What do you mean?” curiosity filled Jack’s eyes as he asked this, and he did a squint that was obviously clear where he learnt it from.
“Sure. You don’t happen to have a tissue or anything, do you?” Castiel turned around and showed his hand that was covered in cum. He’d be damned if he touched his clothes while his hand was like this.
The green-eyed man smiled to himself as he closed the dishwashing machine and get it on for the night. After making sure that he had cleaned the kitchen top, Dean swirled on his heel to find a glass of red wine was waiting for him on the kitchen island. Of course, his brother would
long since we were here," Castiel smiled dreamily as he tried to memorise the fun times he had the last time he was at the lake house. "By the way, Charlie, hey, why don't you join us?"
when you were with Balthazar,” Gabriel returned Castiel’s questioning look with a challenge, “remember when you went home for Christmas, and you had a tip that Balthazar was seeing someone else. You were like a time bomb, I thought Dad and our dear siblings would find out.”
“Well, thank you, Ma’am, Metatron. I can assure you, I’ve loved these boys and their found family for a long time, and I will treat them better than Chuck had.”
"Are you crying?" his little brother asked lightly. He might have expected that the big brother would be emotional when this moment happened, but he still didn't see it coming.
Amara laughed, “That was the jail Chuck sent Me, you know. Anyway, Rebecca, I trust the life of the Winchesters will be in good hands with you now. Metatron will be popping by every now and then to help you, and you can live your life as usual. Of course, you and your family will be under the protection of Heaven.”
“Ah, it would be alright,” Crowley waved his hand lightly, “Juliet was gentle, she wasn’t into attacking other smaller animals, really. Everytime I took her for a walk, she would wag her tail madly when she saw cats or squirrels!”
Dean waved his hand, "Don't worry. I get it; it was Friday night and all. Anyway, don't take this as an offence, but you look
And why in the world his response sounded like a widower who had to deal with his child's question about his late spouse?
“You looked after it well, Cas,” Dean ran his hand over the leather and looked to Cas at the right time, as he was putting on his leather jacket. The way Castiel’s arms slide in smoothly and the jacket then wrapped his body nicely almost made Dean had to hide the unexpected movement from his crotch. “Well, well, you look good in that, Cas.”
“Yeah, I guess I was lucky that nothing bad happened to me. I checked in the morning; there were no bruises or anything. But then, something’s more interesting came in the morning after.”
Sam and Dean’s rooms were located on the left wing of the house, there was also another guest room there. Based on the interior and furniture inside, the extra room was probably used mostly as study and relaxing room by their grandparents.
Dean turned to see Cas was actually awakened and looked at him with his big blue eyes. "Hey, did I wake you up? I'm sorry." He sat on the bed next to Cas and ran his fingers on the dark locks.
tree growing in the centre of the cafe. Not only that, but the tree also went through the roof and was decorated with smaller plants. Underneath the tree, some bowls were filled with water for the animal guests.
A smile was formed on Dean’s face when he heard the easiness in Cas’ voice when asking that. He really didn’t have to worry about Cas and Balz. “Yeah, would like to take Benny, but the man’s a bit challenged in art or anything like so.”
"As for your friend," The Empty tilted his head to Crowley's direction, "it was Billie's request to make him Death. I didn't ask why, not interested in it anyway. I just told her that I'd pull Crowley out from here to send him to Death's abode once she was dead. I don't have time for too many questions, I just want to sleep."
The day seemed to take its time crawling from daytime to afternoon, to the hour where Dean supposed to meet the dentist, Castiel, for a follow up for his dental treatment.
"Amara said that she didn't know much about the place as well. Do you think Chuck made the place or did it exist at the same time as Chuck and Amara?"
one. Especially since he and Crowley had been friends for so long, that it felt like forever, surely Crowley knew every lover Castiel had ever have, both male and female. And he hadn’t had a large number of them.
Cas almost fell asleep watching the program when he felt Dean moved and practically nuzzled his face to Cas’ chest. The dentist rose his eyebrows and turned, tried to shuffled away, just in case Dean needed more space.
Tables and booths were mostly filled, and the staff were busy going back and forth, taking orders from the patrons and delivering their food. Castiel had been to diners in the morning after spending a night at someone else’s place, and he had to say, he immensely loved the atmosphere of a restaurant in the morning. Everyone was still in their best mood, and the smell of food that came from the kitchen was perfect for stimulating hunger. Also, the food would be fresher than when you arrived later.
“Dinner with the big boss,” Dean threaded carefully, not to reveal directly that he was having a major crush on a man, “then family visit.”
Charlie shook her head softly, “I only remember you went dancing with Balthazar. Then you were missing, and suddenly you popped out of nowhere and told me that you’re leaving with
When their orders came, Dean grinned at his barbecued chicken wings, while Castiel had his happy face looking at his soup. “
There were some moments where Castiel’s eyes met Balthazar’s and they exchanged smiles that were discreetly their own. Although tonight, when meeting Balthazar, after their spectacular fight three years ago, he felt the most blithe and tickled after few weeks.
Sorry to hear that, man. Hey, next week when I come for my next treatment, let’s have that soup of yours, shall we?
Crowley moved forward, to let it known that they were entering a more serious topic, “Yes, I have to go back to England in two weeks time, and while I was away, could you babysit for my puppy?”
“Sonuvabitch! Seriously? Why didn’t you tell me sooner?” Dean looked inside the pot gravelly, where the cooking had started processing. “What kind of food that need almost half a day to cook?”
Before he turned his head to the man with the voice on Castiel’s door, Dean swore he saw a hint of disappointment on the dentist’s face.
When he felt Cas had stopped talking, Dean lifted Cas' chin to chase his lips for another kiss. "I want you, Cas," Dean said between his kisses before he slithered his mouth to Castiel's jaw and lifted Cas by his thigh - without any muscle strain, to his surprise - and pushed him to the nearest wall.
Dean closed the fridge and turned to his brother who just got home from work. “Counting. You got dinner?”
"Hold on a second, Moose," he said, "that wasn't the whole story. Dean still hasn't told the story from his side. Of the
It was still so little to learn about The Empty, not even enough for Rowena to start working on something, but she didn't have the heart to say it to the person before her.
"Exactly, Dean," Crowley smiled, "I'm so proud of you. You've grown, and you used that brain more often now."
"Yet he's not fully human. So, he belongs here. Now, you listen to me," The Empty moved forward, his eyes started to flash with annoyance. "You might have gotten your way all this time by making deals with
Castiel got into his Duran Duran t-shirt and shorts after he had his warm and nice shower. He went downstairs again to fill his water bottle and turned the lights in the kitchen. Misha was playing by himself on the sofa in front of the television, but when he saw Cas went pass, the little feline quickly followed his human to the bedding area.
was meant for patients, but somehow it came to Dean’s ears like it meant something else. Maybe it was just him. And Dean decided to stay sitting down. “Oh, okay. So you’re going home or still have something to work on? Paperworks?”
Castiel knew that the statement would come from Dean sooner or later in their talk, sometime this weekend. But, he still could feel a slight discomfort in his chest when he finally heard it.
"You know you're always welcome to visit and take whatever you need from there, Samuel. Consider it my inheritance for you."
To his surprise, the blue-eyed man was giving him a small smile before turning his attention to the vegetable-with-peanut-sauce seller and calls his order.
“Okay. Um, the towel is here,” Dean opened one of the lower cabinets, “you can pick your favourite colour from there. Then you gonna need a toothbrush, right?”
Dean looked sharply to the device box in Sam’s hand, his brain was working so hard to decide. The very first thing he remembered happened before he let Michael possess him was Cas being dead, as well, and he was in the lowest state of him. The grieve and depression that he felt at the time might lead him to one poor decision after another, to the point that he would just accept that if he died.
A victorious chuckle came from his brother, “Come on, you said it was alright before, so why not now?”
"She put a spell on me, something that hurt my heart from the inside, and Cas helped me. He took me to the dungeon, 7B, and he put a spell on the door that could stop Billie, but only temporary, I guess. We were trapped, there was no way out from that room. I know-I know that once Billie got through, Cas would step in to
Castiel fucked his hand as he rode the orgasm wave until he could feel his knees were weak. Apparently, this excited Mick that he started pounding Castiel more, and started to lose his rhythm after some moments, then he also reached his climax.
So, naturally, employment was on their top priority, since Dean actually had just got promoted as permanent staff at a public school he had worked in for three months, and Sam was still between jobs as a lawyer. The kid was so excited that he finally earned his Master degree on Law, and got quite picky on taking jobs. Luckily his friends from college asked him to join them in their firm as a freelancer. At least he got some income.
"Yep, you're right. Cas and I will go out and buy pizza or something," Dean tapped Cas' shoulder to sign him to get up, so they can start getting dressed. "Do you want anything, Rowena?"
" as a personal prayer chant while making his way out from the bedroom. Although, he knew the chance of the music that he heard before was from
Gabriel scoffed and takes out another lollipop from his pocket to devour, “You tried to make their relationship as platonic, but somehow it
Now that he took a second look, the cafe was quite adorable. It reminded him of a vintage house in a European village, with brick stone walls, clay roofs, and a chimney. It might be a little out of place for this cafe to be located in the city, but with the park's surroundings — trees, greens, and all — it fits really well. As Castiel walked approaching the main building, he was in awe with the interiors. The walls filled with photos of customers and their animal buddies, then the ceilings were decorated with fake plants that created shades and a calming atmosphere.
There was a small hopeful hint on Dean’s face, yet there was also a cheeky glint in his eyes that could make Cas giggled like a teenage schoolgirl, and bit his lower lip while thinking of the answer (that he already knew).
The bell finally rang before Dean fell asleep watching the students continued their basketball game. Then, as before, he tidied up the hall with the help from some students. After he was sure all had been returned to their places, Dean locked the hall then he returned to the teacher’s room. On the way, he met an HR staff who asked him about the treatment he was having before and reminded Dean to submit the reimbursement form soon, so the school could transfer the money to him along with this month’s salary. Dean told the HR staff that he will send the form and receipt tomorrow, since it was almost end of day anyway.
The question caught Cas off guard. Yes, he would love to have an intimate dinner with Dean at his place, but on the other hand, seeing how friendly and good Sam and Charlie were to him, it could be even better with both of them joining their dinner, right? “Dean, I don’t mind Sam and Charlie joining us. It could be even merrier.”
Castiel woke up from his sleep for the second time that day, and this time he smiled when he saw the familiar ceilings above him. Then as he looked around, he also recognised the room he was in and everything that was in there. From the wardrobe across his bed, the television that somehow mounted on the right side of the bed — from the previous flat owner, to the window that showed the street he lived in from the third floor.
Nick’s expression showed disappointment for a quick second before he replied, “Oh, yeah, sure. Of course, it’s still weekdays now.”
“Nah, I found it funny, that I also had a little brother named Sammy,” Dean let out a whispered chuckle at Balthazar.
smiling since they drove out from the venue. His Saturday night thingy went way better than he expected. Clearly, he didn’t expected to see Cas looking so beautiful in his v-neck and leather jacket. That damn leather jacket that he love to see on Cas.
“Just dinner, Sammy. You guys can join us only on dinner,” Dean finished his coffee, and smiled triumphantly when he saw Sam raised his hands in defeat.
"No," answered Cas with a sigh, "if Dean was about to give Sam a hint, it would be tonight. But, I'm not sure Dean was gonna tell Sam the details."
It was another hour until Rowena called Dean and gave him the two spells that he needed for his plan.
“Oh, no, Cas. I’m glad Misha is found. But, um, sorry to say this, but we gotta go. Sammy doesn’t want his dinner to be late,” said Dean while rubbing the back of his neck.
“Fuck, you’re so sexy,” that was all Mick said before he, once again, attacked Castiel’s lips, then slithered down his kisses to the neck and each of Castiel’s nipples. Mick’s tongue was all over Castiel’s chest as he pushed the man down to the desk tenderly. He rolled his tongue on each nipple, and he sucked them, he even gave them soft bites. Mick even did more than those to the point that Castiel was hard again.
“Geez, Sammy, if you’re still hungry and you would wait for five hours, you can have the honours as the first one to try the rendang on the stove!”
A beautiful brunette with bright green eyes walked to them and gave Gabriel a tight hug. "How's it going, stranger? It's been a while since I saw you here."
," Crowley unbuttoned his suit jacket and pulled a chair in front of Rowena to sit there. He smiled at his mother for a second before had his attention to the older Winchester again. "First, to answer your earlier question, yes, when I died in the alternate universe, I was awakened at The Empty. A lonely and depressing place, where you could hardly see anything and hear anything. There was practically nothing in there, I almost lost my mind staying there, can you imagine?"
"Oh, right, I should leave," Charlie took another serve of the Chateau Bordeaux, and almost filled her glass up before retreating to the dining table.
“Sounds good, Doctor,” Dean smiled, and if Castiel saw it right, there was a little disappointment in that smile.
It was as if a light bulb just brightened in Castiel’s head. He returned the kale and parmesan cheese into the fridge and took out his phone to find his big brother’s number. Castiel called Gabriel, and he waited for several rings before he heard the familiar voice.
That small realisation just made Cas more and more attracted to the man. He involved Cas in the plans that they were making. It wasn’t a one man arrangement and expecting the other person would agree to all his plans.
Castiel Novak, the dentist with deep understanding of his work and strict of what his patients are consuming, was gone, and before him was only Cas, the motorbike-riding kale-lover who could made him laugh with a series of deadpan comments, clumsiness, and even awkward reactions. The man that Dean had feelings for. The man that could made Dean realised that butterflies in the stomach was more than a chick flick moment, it was real and it sent him so many emotions at one time.
He walked to the sofa bed, without looking back to see what Dean was doing after he left him in the kitchen. Castiel also didn't look at which sofa bed was his side, he took the empty side next to Gabriel and let out a long sigh as he put his head on the fluffy pillow. Castiel might be more tired than he thought; from the all-day work that he did, driving for four hours, and having to deal with the sudden surprise, it was exhausting. The last thing he remembered was pulling the blanket to cover half of his face, then turned away from Gabriel, facing Balthazar. From there, it was all darkness and the surreal world of dreams for Castiel.
“So, that’s why you boys are late? You flirted with a girl at a bakery?” Ellen took the boxes and brought them to the kitchen.
That was the moment Dean’s eyes caught it, a small fluff of whipped cream on the corner of Cas’s mouth.
How was Jo doing? It had also been a while since Dean talked to her. Dean remembered how Ellen used to scowl at him because he took Sam and Jo going for an ‘adventure’ during summer holidays, playing in the pond near their house, climbing the trees to see how their town looked like from above, or cycling around the neighbourhood until her clothes was all dirty. He used to wonder why did Ellen only snapped at him, then he remembered that he was the oldest of them three. Not that it changed anything, he kept taking his younger ones to have adventures with him.
While they enjoyed their meal, Sam and Jack talked about the possibilities of power downgrading. Whether Amara might have taken all of Jack’s powers with Her as She ascends as the new God? Although Jack mentioned how he tried to cut his finger a bit last night, and it still recovered. It seemed like he still had a little bit of grace in him.
"So I, uh, I told him" Cas scratched the back of his head, that wasn't itching at all, "that I love him," Cas said as he turned to Dean, who grinned at him.
Unexpectedly, the dreadful road today was a bit tamed when he went pass. It was still crowded, yes, but nothing to be frowned upon. Castiel arrived at the restaurant fifteen minutes earlier than he expected, and to add up his luck, he could find a parking spot outside the reataurant without any hassle.
It was still like that night, the burnt sigil was still visible on the door. The sigil that was made with Cas' blood. Apparently, the angel had fallen that far, and he had lost that much grace that he bled now.
“Wow, two older brothers? I hardly managed my temper with one. So, they all named after angels like you?”
“Join us, and you’ll find out,” the English man stood up and silently exited the small practice. Before he walked away, he lifted up his hand and made a phoning gesture while mouthing ‘Call me’, which earned him a throw of a rubber eraser.
"Oh, right," the ex-angel smiled sheepishly before he returned the pillow to its origin bed. When he turned around to expect Dean had led the way to his room, the taller man was standing before him instead.
The man with light brown hair before him raised both of his hands and smiled mischievously, “Twist my arm.”
Sam tapped his big brother’s shoulder as he pushed a glass of water and a small tube of aspirin in front of him. “Take this, Eileen and I will cook breakfast.”
Even though he knew that probably wasn't the question that Dean wanted to ask before, Castiel couldn't hide that he almost jumped in surprise when Dean suddenly broke the silence. "They're good. I have a friend babysitting for them, while she also housesits for me this weekend."
He swore he could hear the other man’s choked response, and Dean almost felt guilty about his reply. It wasn’t Cas’ fault that he suddenly had an invitation from his superior, not even Crowley’s fault.
“Dean, that’s okay, I understand,” Jack shrugged and smiled again to one of his fathers. “Okay, I’ll try to call Cas from The Empty now.”
The beer in his hand was almost spilt when he felt Bela shaking his arm. Dean didn’t have to look at his brother to notice the slight jealousy on his face. Given any other woman, Dean wouldn’t care that his brother had a crush on her, he’d make his move. But, he couldn’t do that with Bela. Sam met her first in his Master class.
Dean returned the smile and took a quick glance at Sam and Charlie who were watching the film with their attention undivided. When he was sure that both of them won’t eaves-dropping what he will say next to Cas, Dean whispered, “You wanna get closer?”
“I’m gonna go cook dinner for myself then,” the father walked out from his room, left his children all puzzled, and headed to the kitchen.
Dean chuckled, "Yeah. Now you mentioned it, she really does. She might never say it directly to us, but somehow she's always there whenever we need her. I really appreciate her help with everything that we've been through. She even gave her life to our aid."
be my turn to say mine, Cas. So, please hold on there for a bit longer, okay? We’re coming to get you.”
“Uh, no, I didn’t use this,” Balthazar squinted to read the small letters on the back of the card, and returned it to Dean, “I don’t think I even have this.”
Dean sniffled, the thought of Cas yet made another life-costing deal and didn't tell him was still hurt to recall. "It was when Jack was dying, or dead already, when you called Lily Sunder to come over. Cas made an exchange deal since The Empty wanted to get a hold on Jack. Him for Jack. Being a sonuvabitch that it is, The Empty told Cas that it won't take Cas until he experiences true happiness."
“Yeah, yeah, go ahead,” Dean took a left turn that will lead to Sam’s office. “Anyway, Sam, I don’t think I can pick you up later, so you’ll be going home by yourself.”
Rowena chuckled, "With him actually being like that, I wouldn't be surprised that his children were all rebellious; Lucifer, Castiel, Gabriel."
“Maybe in fifteen minutes, Claire. I just need to use my bathroom for a sec, then we’re off,” Castiel answered while taking his turn to the upstairs.
"Anyway," Dean cut Crowley's train of thought, "from what we saw, once you get to know Amara better, it made more sense that Chuck was The Darkness, and Amara was The Light. One thing led to another, we stripped Chuck off of his power, and Amara became the new God. So, based on your story, it was more likely that Amara pulled you out from the Emp-wait, didn't Amara say that She wasn't familiar with The Empty?"
A woman with brunette hair and perfectly sculpted facial bones suddenly appeared in the middle of the room. She looked dashing in Her white shirt and violet coloured velvet suit, Her long legs were wrapped in a pants suit of the darker colour. She turned Her face to the woman who was busy typing and now was frozen in her seat.
“Okay, let’s have breakfast,” he took the aspirin and pushed it with the glass of water before standing up (and heard some bones cricking) then shuffled his way to the kitchen. When they were halfway, Dean turned to make sure Eileen saw his face and said with a smile, “Eileen, I can help you with breakfast.”
The beautiful brunette turned to Dean and smiled, “Hey, Dean, you’re just in time. Sam and Jack were just catching me up with what happened to Chuck.”
Claire made a mock disgusted sound, “Well, at least you have a good taste in men, Uncle Cassie. Balthazar and … Dean.”
Jenny’s demise caught the two vamp-mimes off guard that the hunter in their hands could easily break free and attacked them. Soon, the four of them - two hunters and two vampires - were back in a chaotic fight between mortals and supernatural entities. Punches, kicks, shovings, and every means to hurt were made between them.
“Sure will, Dean. Yeah, I think I wouldn’t mind coming here every now and then,” continued Alex while looking around with amazement in her eyes.
“The pub crawl I told you before, with my class?” Abaddon turned to her friends who were standing in a group behind her. As expected, they all stared dreamily at Castiel. “We made a pit stop here for a quick bite, before hopping off to the next bar. Charlie! How’re you, babe?”
Dean hoped that Cas won’t noticed the uncontrollable thumping in his chest, that was very close to the other man. He took a deep breath, and when he was certain, once again, that both Sam and Charlie were focused on the film, Dean talked softly on Cas’ ear. “Do you, uh, do you wanna stay for the night?”
If Castiel and Abbadon were cheeky, it was all thanks to Gabriel. He groomed his baby siblings so they knew that they
"Whoa, whoa, Dean, are you okay?" Sam placed a hand on his big brother's shaking shoulder, "Look, if you want to tell me anything, I'm here, okay? Anything, Dean,
Dean pretended that he was too busy with his food to answer his brother, although he could feel his chest had an alien staccato jolt when an image of a certain dark haired and blue eyes man came into his mind, he only managed to put up the mask for few seconds, before Sam kicked his leg under the table and made Dean looked up. “What?”
“I’ll give it to you later after I take my shower, is that alright?” Dean got up and at the same trying hoping that there was no tent or whatever on his pants.
“Awesome. Oh, here,” Dean handed Castiel his phone, and received a frightened look as response, “not for you! Put down your number. I don’t wanna talk with your receptionist if I want to meet you outside your practice.”
Cas was still registering the touch on his skin, when he felt Dean cupped his face and moves forward. Next thing he knew was a soft brush of Dean’s lips on his, a faint one, that followed with a claim on his lips.
Henceforth the fact that he would bounce excitedly towards Castiel, whenever he took out the harnesses and leash. During the walk, he would pace and run proudly next to Romeo.
"Surprise," the British man said in a sing-song with a smile before he tapped the end of the device in his hand and made it disappear. Another theatrical performance from Crowley that he was clearly proud of. "Mother, how are you? I'm surprised to see you
"Maybe Billie thought it would amuse you to reap Sam and me," Dean shrugged to Crowley who smiled back at him.
After each call of ingredient, Cas would hear Dean pushed the trolley to various aisles of the supermarket. Cas could practically hear the rolling wheels of the cart.
As they walked, Charlie hooked her arms to each Dean’s and Sam’s, “I’m so glad you met Castiel, Dean. You guys looked really good together. And that friend of yours, Balthazar, he’s cool.”
so fast at the same time. His Monday started with a text message from Balthazar that said Charlie was comparing him to Gollum, and Dean was The One Ring. He bursted out laughing in the middle of his morning run, causing some of other people passing by turned their heads to him curiously.
Dean raised his eyebrows as Sam wolfed down a chocolate and peanut doughnut, “So, we talked about relationships over a box of doughnuts in the middle of the night, is this high school?”
With the help of his vet, Castiel took care of Misha — who turned out was only two months old at the time — until he was healthy and playful again. Not to his surprise, Romeo was the target of the little feline's mischiefs, and Romeo was enjoying every second of it. They were inseparable; although, with Romeo not knowing his actual ability and what he could do to such a small animal, it could be a bit worrying. Castiel kind of lost count how many times he rescued Misha's head from Romeo's
The two vamp-mimes brought him up to his feet, and that was the time he saw his brother started to awaken while trying to reach for his machete behind Jenny. The big brother realised that he had to buy time, then he decided to do just like with other cases, he tried to break the ice.
The man receiving the question leaned back on his chair, “Yeah, he’s coming back. I hope. He needs treatment for his molars, and I told him to do another visit next week.”
Crowley and Rowena even shared a warm look and smile from hearing that they were considered family in the bunker.
Balthazar laughed when he heard Dean’s protest, “That’s gold, Charlie. Cassie must know about this. Can I text him, Dean?”
The camera was moving slowly (probably Dean didn’t want to make Cas dizzy from the fast movement) from the television that was mounted on the wall, then shooting down to the desk before Dean, Cas could see that it was almost covered by papers, and there were two cups of coffee, one of them was half full.
, Castiel was served with a monologue on what are the ingredients the cafe used for both cat food and dog food. The explanation also included nutritions that are best for Siberian Huskies and domestic cats, that Castiel actually had known from his vet. Still, he really appreciated that the cashier person learnt
Maybe that was the reason why Dean was so kind to him, even though they just met. He was raised by good people, and he basically paid it forward by treating others right.
The last time he let someone else into his car, that person didn’t make any comment about anything inside or what Baby lacked of, so Dean didn’t actually thought of installing a seatbelt. Probably if Cas did made a complaint he would go find a way to install it the next day.
It was the word ‘major’ that made Dean’s stomach did a flip, that was not caused by hunger, and he did his best to avoid looking straight to Sam, just in case he was blushing. Preteding he was busy with the chicken, Dean gave the answer anyway, “I’m gonna have someone over tomorrow. Dinner.”
“Cas, look, I’m sorry I snapped. I was really worried and, uh, I’m glad you arrived home safely. I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, man. I shouldn’t shout at you.”
Speaking of weird, Dean must remember to ask Balthazar about Saturday night at school tomorrow. Dean admired how Balthazar was very supportive of him trying to get to know his ex-lover, and he was even the one who introduced them. He didn’t know many people who would do that, and actually Dean himself might not have such big heart to let anyone he knew going out with any of his exes. It probably caused by the protective nature in him.
As he broke down to sobs, Dean could feel Sam tightened his grip on his shoulder. The way Sam didn't say anything as he broke down his walls, the one he had kept up for many years. The one that prevented him to actually have feelings and attachment to someone else, besides his most inner circle.
"And being brought back to life," Dean continued, "to see your sons as adults who are older than you probably was too much for her. She got through this phase, of course, as you saw. Then, things happened, and as Sam and I learnt of who she really was, maybe her time was up, again."
person he turned down this week. It was like Dean had lost the excitement of the hunt and flirting. Has he really grown up that much? Well, he owned his own bar
“Doing good, Sam. Hello, darling,” Balthazar turned to the red haired girl sitting next to the tall man. “I don’t think we’ve met before. I’m Balthazar, I work with Dean.”
“Room service for Misha?” Dean asked, as he saw the yellow kitten had curled on one of Cas’ pillows.
“Really?” Castiel smiled when he remembered his baby brother, who’s also Claire’s senior in High School. He made a mental note to call Samandriel tommorow.
He silently prayed that Dean wouldn’t realise that he was actually frozen of astonishment, instead of technology issue.
“That was last year?” Dean turned to Benny, who smiled understandingly and nodded. “Wow, time do fly fast.”
Dean parked his beloved Impala at the parking lot of the building, and walked to the food court. He had tried the Marv’s before, and he was thinking to give another stall a try. Probably the one that he saw was producing deliciously smelled fog all around the place when he was here before.
Dean knocked on his brother’s door. It was almost eight in the morning, and Sam said the night before that he wanted to hitch a ride to work with Dean, who agreed as long as Sam would wake up earlier than he usually is.
Dean chuckled at her comment, "I'm sure Rowena was fond of Sam for a long time, not in that way, mind you. Maybe she saw potential in him, or she just liked to tease him."
It was a contemplating moment for Castiel, on one side he was relieved to hear that Dean didn’t mention the confession. Still, on the other hand, it was hard for him to hear about Dean’s suffering. That was caused by him and his deaths.
cue, since that was the time when the younger hunter decided to get up and beheaded Jenny. Practically ended up the short and weird reunion between the hunters and the long lost prey, that they had forgotten many years ago.
The fat black cat only looked at Castiel for a few moments before blinked lazily and head-butted Castiel’s hand, a sign for him to keep going with the rub.
Dean looked to his watch on his left wrist, it showed nine-fiteen, Sam and Bela should be here at anytime. Bela said that he’d finished her preparation meeting for tomorrow’s opening at nine, and Sam will pick her up after work, so, yeah, it should be anytime now.
Cas smiled to Dean’s question and lifted up the bottle in his hand, “I’m still good, Dean, thank you,” he replied with soft voice.
Dean smiled as he noticed Cas’ hands starting to paw on his shoulders, pulling his henley shirt, as he lowered his kisses to Cas’ neck. He could feel a sensation that resembled an electric jolt rushed up and down his spine when he heard Cas released an unguarded moan as he caught the angel’s earlobe with his teeth. He could also acknowledge that his jeans started to get tighter the more he slithered his hand under Cas’ suit jacket and pulled the shirt out of his pants to feel Cas’ skin underneath it.
his unusual book collection. He didn’t usually show what was he currently reading to a lot of other people. Somehow he didn’t feel comfortable if anybody else knew about this side of him, the part of him who actually liked to read classic novels. Sammy always said that Dean should let other people knew about his intelligence. Dean always snorted at that.
“I’ll look after him, Uncle Cassie,” they both shared a loving hug, and a kiss on the top of her head for Claire.
There was a slight blush on Castiel’s cheeks after Dean said that, it wasn’t something that could be clearly visible, but Dean saw it. And he liked it.
There was a slight jolt of pain in Dean’s chest when he saw Cas’ face beamed, and how his voice turned softer as he said his former lover’s name. Well, it was Dean’s fault anyway for bringing up that topic.
“Wow, Cas, that’s some thought you have there,” Sam chuckled. “But, that platypus thing, I don’t think it was God made.”
It’s refreshing. Especially after having a minor patient, whose mother couldn’t stop asking and reminding you that her 14 year old son was afraid of dentist.
“Alright, then,” Sam shrugged and turned to Castiel, “So, Castiel, you said before that you had a brother named Sammy as well. Did you act like a jerk towards him as well, like
for Cas to return to him. The angel is the one person who understands Dean’s life, besides Sam. Cas won’t be questioning if he, or they, had to leave so suddenly to another city for a job. Cas would go with them and support them. Even with his power all downgraded, thanks to the chaos in Heaven.
Sam chuckled at that defence, “If you weren’t my brother, I’d say you’ve got a fetish over doctors.”
There was an uneasy feeling inside the car, even Juliet noticed and she started to whine sadly. Cas gripped his hand tighter on Dean’s, trying to radiate comfort to the man next to him. “That was a nightmare, Dean. A terrible one. You’re safe now.”
“Gabe,” Castiel let out a whine that he could only have whenever he’s in conversation with this particular brother, so he decided to take a sharp turn on the subject. “Hey, did you know that Claire will be tagging with you?”
Jack shrugged, "Well, I have three Dads already, and you and Sam are brothers, I could just watch you guys have the brotherly fights on a daily basis. You and Castiel, on the other hand."
Dean knew how important Eileen was to Sam. He knew how in love his little brother was with the funny and badass girl, just by looking at his happy face whenever Eileen was around. It made Dean believe that Sam had found his happy ending. A life with someone who knew what they were going through and won’t freak out with it.
Castiel was halfly gasped when he saw the frozen smiling face is now moving in real time accompanied with a cheerful baritone that he loved to hear.
Dean smiled proudly as he rolled the car out from the parking lot. “It is, I took care of her with my own hands. I don’t trust my Baby to other people. Right, Cas-Tiel, I don’t know where you live, so you have to show me the way. Which way I should be directing now?”
“Um,” the pause between them was signing that Dean was reading the package, “Indonesian seasoning for meat. It’s from Sumatra, spicy and need a long time to cook. That’s challenging. What say you?”
“Oh,” Castiel face beamed at the short story, “alright then, just let me know when you’re leaving then I’ll pick her up.”
Castiel had to bit his bottom lip to prevent a smile seeing Dean bending down over his steering wheel and narrowing his eyes while scrunching his face, trying to look up to the top of the building. Based on the information on his folder back at the practice, Dean is thirty-four. And no thirty-four year old man should be as cute as
years. It must be weird for them, especially someday when Castiel would bring home a man and introduce him as his
Dean smiled at the divine miracle that happened before his eyes. No matter how many times he saw it, seeing Cas doing that always brought warmth to his chest. "Thanks, Cas. How are you feeling?"
The question made him had a little shock and his arm bumped the beer bottle, causing it to spill all over the table.
The girl next to him smiled, “That’s okay, Uncle Cassie. I know it’s hard at home, at least you have Gabriel supporting you for now. Oh, Alfie also knew.”
"Wait," Dean raised both of his hands, "so, you're saying that there are more guarantees for me to cross to The Empty, rescue Cas, then return here alive, as a half-dead
“Well, you looked pleased. Someone interesting on the phone?” Bela asked, with a hint of mock jealousy in her thick English-accented voice.
Would he be able to meet that angel again? Now they were in a dead-end to find anything that could help them pass to The Empty?
It wasn’t long before a pair of footsteps were heard directing to them. One was heavy and one was lighter, along with the respectful owners. A tall man with flowing long hair and excited look on his face, next to him was a petite girl with red hair and wide smile on her face.
Before Rowena could ask him another question, they heard heavy footsteps that came from the ward's direction, where Sam and Eileen would do the extracting process with Jack. As the three people showed, the expression on their faces managed to make Dean lose even the slightest hope that he thought he had when Rowena appeared in the bunker.
I mean, conversing with him was really nice and all, flowing and relaxed. It just seemed bizarre,” Castiel played with the dew on his milkshake glass.
The brothers walked to the kitchen, where Sam turned on the coffee machine. Dean took two cups from the cabinet, and handed one to Sam.
