"I'd love to," Steve said, surprised and delighted, and hurried to get rid of his shirt and undershirt.
"I met someone who knew," Steve replied. He'd probably end up telling Tony about the resistance sooner or later, but not until he was entirely convinced he could trust him. "Was Stane working for them?"
"Where did he land? Did he go somewhere?" Steve asked hurriedly.
Steve crossed his arms. "I'm not fighting for some fairytale perfect match that I've got a one in a million chance of meeting."
Steve had already known that, because the thread would only be there if there feelings were mutual, but it still made his heart soar that it was the first thing Tony had chosen to tell him after that awful silence.
"Are there any humans in this building aside from the two of us?" Tony asks him, watching her slip out of the room. Looking at her back, the curve of her hips, the way she walks in her designer heels, you'd never guess she's a machine.
No one can really blame him if he lets out a yelp of surprise and almost drops the car battery at the sight, because lying on the floor against the wall, it looks perfectly human: a blond man, maybe late twenties in age, wearing army fatigues. Together with the muscular-looking build, that suggests it's a military model. A second look reveals damage to its side that was initially blocked from view, with patches of plastic and broken wiring that make it obvious this corpse is artificial.
Steve had already considered that. It would be a tricky situation, and one where he wasn't sure if there would be any right choices. Nevertheless, he'd gladly face it, when the alternative was never seeing Tony again.
Tony took a deep, shaky breath. His head hurt, and he was vaguely nauseous.
"You're in the hospital in Tromsø. You were airlifted here yesterday from the Finnish side of the border, with a dangerously low body temperature. How you ended up that way, we don't know," she explains, confirming Tony's guess that he is still up north, as well as the fact that the hiking trip from hell really did take place. That just leaves one crucial detail that he needs to clarify.
Steve counted the seconds in his mind, from sixty to zero and then upwards again. He didn't quite get up to ninety.
He wasn't in his bedroom, neither the real one nor the virtual replica. Instead, he was in the VR suite that was a part of his apartment, still dressed in the t-shirt and shorts he'd worn when he'd gone to sleep. Even through all the confusion and pain, it was obvious what must've happened: he'd been yanked out of VR without the proper procedure, by someone physically pulling off the electrodes. There were reasons why this wasn't recommended under any circumstances, no matter how urgent.
He managed to get hold of Pepper and tell her, in the most vague words imaginable, that he knew where Tony was, and that the situation would hopefully be solved soon.
"Oh, no. Those other people definitely wouldn't be buying me beers," Tony said, also going for his drink. When he put the glass down, he licked his lips to clear off some foam, slowly. Too slowly for it not to be a deliberate show, so Steve didn't try to hide that he noticed it, his eyes lingering on Tony's mouth.
The second part of what she said registers with a slight delay—the mention of Pepper, which reminds him of the whole wide world out there, now that he's back in civilization again. The idea of having to deal with the press or security debriefings or any other tedious, inevitable official business makes him want to pull the blanket over his head. He's way too tired and sore for all that.
"You don't have to go. Dinner will be here any minute," Steve said.
"Not when I thought you were after me—which you were, of course. It still boggles my mind you could be so devious." The way Tony said that sounded more amused than angry, which Steve was happy to hear.
Everyone else started filing out of the room—a stylish conference room a dozen floors down from Tony's residence in Stark Tower, with minimalistic grayscale decor and large windows similar to those Steve was used to on the higher floors—but Steve lingered behind with Tony.
He could barely believe his ears when the third call he made turned out to be a success.
"Look, Steve, the thing is, I don't hate you," Tony began. "I've never hated you. After what happened, after Siberia, I tried. I really did. I wanted to hate you, you deserved that, for hiding things from me, but I couldn't. I—"
“See? They’re just like us! So sweet together,” Tony said. He turned towards Steve to press a fluffy kiss on his cheek.
That sounded about right; he was too hot and too cold at the same time, panting and still light-headed from lack of oxygen, his heart pounding like he'd run a mile although he'd just woken up from a nap—he knew he was sick and it was probably bad, but he couldn't stop now. He had to suffer through this. For Steve.
Steve felt like his thoughts were already skirting topics that he was better off avoiding. As much as he wanted to know more about what was going on, he didn't actually need to see it. "No. It's enough that I know it's done."
Steve hurried to do as Rhodey had suggested, settling behind Tony to pull him into a half-seated position in his lap.
Something heavy collided with the side of his head, and everything went dark.
noticed Tony was awake, he stomped the ground and called out his name. "Tony? Are you unwell?"
Steve hesitates, glancing at Tony, clearly waiting to see if Tony will counteract the command. He's hard-coded to obey all humans, but Tony is his registered owner and comes first in the priority queue. Since it's obvious Obie wants Steve out of the room to continue the conversation without him overhearing it, Tony lets the order stand.
He sniffed. Definitely not close to tears.
Pepper gives him a glare and an exasperated huff. "And I'm not a maid."
“And I care about you too, asshole!” Steve shouted back at him.
Even if Tony had messaged Steve, it didn't look like he was interested in actually talking about the situation. He felt a flare of annoyance at Tony for just tossing the information at him and then refusing to follow up on it. Steve wanted to grab him by the shoulders and shout at him to explain himself, but even if he rushed back home and did just that, he doubted he'd achieve anything. If Tony hadn't wanted to face the fact that they were a match before, he certainly wouldn't want to do so now, when he had so many reasons to hate Steve.
It hadn't occurred to Steve that Tony might not have been aware of Captain America's presence at the final fire, but that was what it sounded like. It did make sense, considering that Steve had only joined the fray after Tony had already been pushed into the sea; Tony hadn't really been himself after that.
"I could say the same about you. I thought I'd lost you!" Steve returned. He guessed it would be a long story how Bucky had survived and how he'd ended up in Crabb Castle with Tony, but that would have to wait. Steve held out his arms towards the two men. "What happened to Tony? Is he okay?"
"The Global Identity Agency has confirmed his status. This here is none other than Anthony Edward Stark," Natasha said, motioning at Tony, wearing the broadest smile Steve had ever seen on her lips.
"Well, it was fine in the end," Steve said. This bothered him less than it seemed to bother Tony, maybe because he had known who Tony was all along, and he'd been aware of the potential danger. "Besides, it's not like I was any better. I might not be able to burn things, but I'm strong enough to hurt people if I'm not careful. I didn't tell you about that, either. Not to mention, you wouldn't have wanted me around if you'd known who I really was."
Steve's name had been easy enough to explain away as happenstance, but for this, Bucky had no explanation. He hadn't spoken his nickname aloud one single time since he'd woken up here. No matter how smart and devious Stark was, there was no way he could've found out that name, if not from Steve.
," Kamski says, moving not towards his desk but a sofa table and a pair of comfortable-looking armchairs set in a corner of his spacious office. "Take a seat, and tell me what brings you here."
The bathroom door opened, and the always-impressive red-and-gold figure stepped through it, looking bigger than usual and out of place in the everyday surroundings of Steve's bathroom. "I didn't mean to intrude," Iron Man said. "I just wanted to check if you were all right, and you didn't answer your door, so I let myself in to make sure."
"Anyone still listening? It's Barton."
"Aww, no need to worry for me, Green Genes. Relax. I'm not going to. It's just a thought experiment," Tony said.
in the Vault.
"Where did this happen, then?" Steve went on with the conversation.
Steve shook the hand he was being offered and tried to keep his face neutral. "Technically, I'm not a captain anymore. Pleased to meet you, Mr. Hammer."
Steve wanted nothing more than to punch this terrible, twisted man right there and then, but he didn't want to compromise his progress. It might already be enough that Stane had admitted to the identity theft in such clear words. Still, Steve reeled in his wrath and just barked, "Leave him alone, Stane."
Tony's fingers dug into Steve's shoulders, his voice turned into a wordless moan, and he came, his cock still between Steve's lips, just like Steve had promised him.
Steve froze, both his hands on the back of the chair now. "Of course. We fought against them many times, back in the day. They're a paramilitary fascist organization who ran all kinds of inhumane experiments," he summarized. Those had been the rare missions where he hadn't felt too guilty about causing lasting damage to his opponents. And if this was going where he thought it was… "Was it them? Were they the ones who took down my team and half the administration of SHIELD?"
"You'll need to be a little more specific, I've got a lot of stuff," Tony returned. Of course, the things he imagined a mob boss might be interested in were such that he'd never consider handing them out, like the Iron Man armor and all the additional weaponry he and Jarvis had designed for it during the war.
He pulled up his own genome from his medical files. Even though he'd never entered it into an amoromics database, he'd had it sequenced. Of course. Out of curiosity, mostly, because why not. It hadn't offered any shocking revelations of his lineage or his risks for hereditary disease.
"The pleasure's all mine, Steve, believe me. It's not every day you get to meet a celebrity from the past," Hammer said, already moving towards Pepper. "And Miss Potts. Enchanté, as always." He reached for Pepper's hand as if he was planning on kissing it, then saw the glare Pepper was giving him and shook it lightly instead. "Sad to see Miss Rushman couldn't join us this time."
As soon as they know where to go, Tony takes off in his armor, rushing through the snowy forest at breakneck speed. It takes all of Sam's flying skills not to lose sight of him. The others follow behind in the Avenjet.
"I wish I could figure out what's going on behind that pretty face of yours, Steve," Tony said.
"No," Tony admitted, looking away again. "Those bad things I did, I didn't mean to. At least I don't think I did. I hope I didn't. I wish I could be sure." He wasn't making a whole lot of sense, but it was plain as day how much this upset him. "I need to figure this out, and I need to fix it. I can't do that without some answers. That's why I've got to do this, and I've got to do it alone." It sounded like he was trying to convince himself rather than Steve.
"Steve! It's true—you're alive!" Bucky exclaimed, as if he couldn't believe what he was saying.
"Yes, and I'm not proud of that, but we had to test it! Otherwise we wouldn't have found out if it worked," Maya said defensively.
Was it possible that Steve had gotten things wrong, somehow, and this really wasn't Tony, after all? Could this be some kind of lookalike? Had the real Tony Stark been left behind, buried in those temple ruins, and this was someone else?
This wasn't an expedition that Steve had ever heard anyone mention, neither Tony himself, nor Rhodey, Pepper or Jarvis. Once again, he found himself holding his breath in anticipation. He half worried Tony would realize he wasn't asleep and stop talking, but he went on.
"Afternoon, Mr. Stark," Pepper greets him as she spots him. "I've been catching up with Steve, here."
It's that look, hopeful but still cautious, that compels Tony to bite down a snide response about how he has plenty of reasons not to trust Steve's promises. "Glad you found time in your schedule," Tony says instead. He thinks it works. Not too mean, but not too sappy, either.
He tried to remind himself that Stark had brought this on himself by abandoning his fellow humans to serve the lizard oppressors. Bucky hadn't shown any compassion towards Nazis during the war, and this was no different. Stark wasn't just an enemy soldier, he was an evil collaborator. He didn't deserve sympathy.
"Me?" Natasha chuckled aloud, clearly taken by surprise. "Do you really need to ask? I have dozens of reasons not to. Have you, then? Or thinking about doing it?"
Steve's face fell. "Oh, that's terrible, I'm so sorry." He let go of the metal arm and put his hand on Bucky's good shoulder instead. "I'm sure I can't even begin to imagine everything you've had to go through, but I'm so glad you're alive, you have no idea."
"We're working on it," Fury said.
Steve’s expression was inching away from slightly grumpy towards full-on righteous Cap wrath. “An adult? Like you? You’re a narcissistic jerk with a god complex!”
As weak as Steve was, there wasn't anything wrong with his legs. "I hope so," he said.
"If you'd actually told me what was going on, it would've gone differently," Steve pointed out, casting a glance at Pepper.
"We found it, Al and me, before Tony's group got there," she went on. "We wanted to know if it was the real thing, so we had someone drink from it. One of yours," she glanced at the Kingpin. "His name was Mallen."
They'd taken him to a mid-level hospital that Fury had picked, promising that the staff were good people with no loyalty to SHIELD. The doctors there hadn't wanted to put Tony in cryo because of the added risk of complications involved in freezing and thawing his brain without a backup. They hadn't wanted him conscious, either, because while no one knew what state he'd wake up in, it'd certainly be highly stressful for him. Until Tony's identity was officially verified, he was still penniless and paperless, outside the system, which meant that the costly operation to get him out of his failing body wasn't an option. That left him stuck on external life support in an induced coma, which the doctors promised should keep him alive for at least a month.
"And what's to stop me from solving my problem by just killing both you and him?" Stane said, still not using Tony's name.
While the aftershocks were still coursing through Steve's body, he saw Tony bring himself to a second orgasm. Tony slumped to the floor, letting go of Steve altogether, the back of his head resting against Steve's thigh, coming messily all over himself.
As soon as the firemen with the gurney had passed the crowd, Steve followed them.
"Okay. Thanks for the update, anyway," Steve said.
"I don't doubt that," Tony said, with a smirk.
"Right. You start the timer and hop on your steed here. I'll go ahead and open the door for you, and we leg it like our lives depend on it," Bucky summarized. "Hopefully your clawed friend from the cell is close by, because we won't have time to wait for her."
“I’m pretty sure I’m not,” Tony replied.
Steve considers whether he should disclose that he had that monologue while cuddling Tony's naked body, but quickly decides against it. If Tony doesn't remember that particular detail, it's probably best left forgotten for now. "Yes. I did say those things, and I meant everything I said back then. I still do, here and now. You probably hate me, and you have plenty of reasons to. I wrote it to you once, but I should've said it in person: I'm sorry."
"I don't, and I haven't. I think Tony knew her beforehand, but that obviously isn't very helpful when he's not around," Pepper said. "I'd suggest you contact the university and ask for her number, but since her apartment just burned down, that won't do you much good, either."
Steve would've preferred to just hop on his bike and drive through the night to get to Tony as soon as possible, but he had a meeting scheduled with the FDNY regarding the fires first thing in the morning. Perhaps that was for the best; waking Tony by showing up at his door at dawn would definitely not be the best of ideas. Steve would have to be careful. He'd seen what Tony could do when he was cornered and desperate.
Deep in thought, he returned to his floor. He cleaned and sealed the cut in his calf, remembering the fight that had caused it and the disdain of everyone in that bar towards him. Later, he had a solitary instant meal from his fridge. The difference between this and the burger he'd had Downstairs was like night and day. He'd preferred the burger, because at least he'd chosen and bought it himself, even if the money had come from selling a coat that Tony had given him.
"Elijah," Tony returns, forcing a smile. "Loving your new home. If I didn't know better, I'd think you're compensating for something, but I guess you just can't help being pretentious."
A general overview of key political events during his time in storage supported this impression. SHIELD seemed to have grown from an organization that mainly worked behind the scenes into a major player in global politics, and a planetary police that held far more influence than any local ones. When Steve asked if there was any chance that he could meet with someone currently working for them, Ultron said he would have to run that by Tony first. That was a reply Steve got for several other questions that might've helped him figure out the past. Almost as if Tony didn't want him to know.
"The last time we were supposed to meet didn't go so well," Tony said skeptically. Steve guessed he was referring to the first warehouse fire.
What he couldn't forget were the faces of the people who had gotten hurt because of him. Today had been particularly bad because they'd only been a few minutes too late. If they'd just been those crucial minutes faster in Assembling, no one would've gotten hurt. They would need to practice harder. Shave off all the extra time they could.
"Good," Steve said. It was a start, at least. "Now that we're here, Sam and I can start gathering supplies for the trip."
The petulant look on his face shouldn’t have looked as good as it did. Not that Tony would ever admit to that opinion. “Don’t pout, Rogers, it makes you look like a child,” he said instead. “At least try to behave like an adult.”
James gave him a scrutinizing frown. "You do seem pale." He pulled out a pocket watch to check the time—something to set apart the North from the rest of Dinotopia, where regular timepieces were rare. "It's getting late anyway. Might as well."
He turned around to face Randall again, hands raised in fists. "Who did this?" he demanded.
"Nope," Tony replied, his eyes still on the phone.
He'd just sit here for a moment, see if he could learn anything new, and walk away before it could turn into anything more than casual flirting, he decided. That wouldn't be too bad. He could still live with himself after that.
It was Tony's database. Tony's data wouldn't be unavailable.
He's just never been any good at that.
The same as before, Jarvis also picked up now. "Stark residence, Edwin Jarvis speaking."
"It's not really up to me," Tony told her.
Steve sat down on the fake marble floor in front of him. "I've got an idea."
Steve glanced at the speaker. His frame looked like a man in his thirties, with auburn hair and a lanky build that reminded Steve of his own birth body. In place of a uniform, he wore a hybrid of formal attire and scrubs: crisply pressed charcoal trousers and a high-collared turquoise jacket, all of it precisely tailored. His name tag was a rectangular screen seamlessly inset into the jacket's breast, and it identified him as Randall Jones.
The drone holding Steve released one of its pincers and smashed it into the side of Steve's face. It connected with such force that he saw stars for a few seconds, his legs going limp involuntarily. The drone moved in to press one of its metallic knees over Steve's thighs, pinning him in place.
As he keeps on walking, going around one of the countless hills surrounding them, as if to put that physical barrier between himself and the man he can't stop thinking about, his anger slowly dwindles away. It's first replaced by annoyance, then regret, and eventually, despite everything, concern.
When he lay down in bed and closed his eyes, his thoughts kept going back to the evening's events, and it took him much longer than usual to fall asleep.
Steve responded with a triumphant grin. "You didn't really believe I'd just walk in here without a plan, did you?"
Her smile when she beckoned him aside was definitely a good sign. Bucky left the other young resistance fighters to go on with their sparring and hurried to her.
Tony bit his lip. "I've thought about it, but I don't know. I'm not sure it'd work for me? You've got years of experience with fakes. I'm just so used to this body. It's a pretty nice one, isn't it?" He ran his fingers up along his thigh, stopping to rest his hand on his hip.
He hated that he couldn't trust his body. He couldn't die now. Not yet. Not when his job wasn't finished.
Finland makes a lot of sense, considering they were in Norway, and he suspected the kidnappers' plane might have been headed for Russia. Unfortunately, his team won't know that, so they probably haven't guessed to look for him here.
The ground grew closer; close enough that he could see it looming beneath the fog and spot some neon signs far below. He supposed most other people would've felt nervous before doing what he was about to. He didn't. He actually felt excited for the first time since he'd woken up in the future.
Steve had thought Tony had picked this frame for him. He hadn't been wrong, after all, even if the person he'd first taken for Tony had been someone else. Tony had wanted him to look like this, like an improved version of Steve's birth body. One that Tony would like better. More than that, Tony had involved him in this scheme, assuming without asking that he'd be fine with it.
"But that's—" she stammers, pointing a shaky finger at him.
Maybe he imagined the voice he thought he heard.
Tony didn't seem amused at all. "I've always admired you, you know, Captain. Since I heard about how you volunteered for that experiment, and about your bravery during the war. You're the kind of man I'd like to be, but I'm not. I'm all too aware of that. I've questioned many things I've done over the years. Like I said, a lot of what I've done has been driven by, well, personal reasons, and just seeking a thrill, always looking for something new and exciting. Sometimes I think I'm the most selfish person there is." He paused to take a shaky breath. "On some level, I kind of feel that maybe I deserve what's happened to me. Reap what you sow, and all that."
He looked out of the large windows. As far as he could tell, he wasn't being followed; he saw no sign of Ultron's drones. If he was lucky, his behavior hadn't raised any warnings yet. The cab's recognition software had figured out his identity, but the cab company should be keeping that information to themselves. He'd left his watch in a bathroom at the police station, which should confuse Ultron and buy him some time. He was fairly sure Tony would've had some type of tracking device installed in his frame, but he had no means of locating or eliminating it. He'd have to find a way to deal with it later.
He still needed to find Tony. Pepper had said Tony would probably be staying somewhere in the city. There was a chance that he'd fled, after yesterday's altercation with the mob, but if he hadn't, maybe Steve could find him through some regular detective work.
He did spend a lot of time thinking about Peggy. He missed her when she wasn't around, and when she was, he always got all too flustered. He could face the enemy's armies without blinking, but somehow, when it came to her, he just couldn't take that one step; couldn't say those few words that it would take to let her know how he felt.
"Rushman?" Stane exclaimed. He'd frozen in place, staring at the door in utter disbelief.
Steve couldn't stop second-guessing himself, wondering if instead of waiting so he could eavesdrop on the meeting, he should've brought Tony in. It might've gone badly wrong; Tony might've resisted, so that he would've ended up burning down the inn instead of another empty warehouse—but there was also a chance he might've listened to Steve, and that he'd still be alive.
That was where he was.
"Like I could sleep for a week," Tony replies, which Steve thinks is surprisingly direct, coming from him. "Didn't know you could get this tired from being too cold. Then again, spending several days barely eating or sleeping might play a part, too. They were saying something about messed-up electrolytes and whatnot. Wasn't really paying attention."
"Very good, that's very good," Randall said, offering him a smile that might have been cute if it hadn't looked so practiced. "Now, I would like you to go through a set of exercises for me, so we can establish that all the neuromotor connections are correctly mapped."
"You don't need to," Steve said quickly.
"What you actually should do is take me with you, the next time you go out there," Steve continues. "You know it's what I was built for, and you're right. I'm not a nanny, or a butler, or a personal assistant. I'm a soldier. Let me do what I was created to do."
"I think she can be excused, considering what she had to go through last time," Pepper said sharply.
"That's very kind of you," Steve said, suppressing the thrill of excitement at the touch. This wasn't the place.
"It's amazing," Steve said, pressing his lips against the back of Tony's head. "You're amazing."
He pulled the phone out of his pocket. Still no reply.
He keeps going through the day and well into the twilight, pausing only to drink and to eat the rest of his brunch bird, until the gathering clouds turn the landscape dark in spite of the midnight sun. With so little light left, moving in the often slippery and rocky terrain turns perilous. Gaining more headway over Tony isn't worth chancing a broken ankle.
"It'd probably be best if I let your contact person explain everything to you. My job is just to oversee transfers," Randall said hurriedly. "Yours seems to have been perfectly successful, so my work here is done. She's waiting for you in the lounge. That's right next door."
Steve had thought he'd need to carry the burn victim to the rescue crew, and maybe wait for several days before he got to talk to them, but this man seemed to be in good shape; he'd stopped coughing, and clearly had no trouble carrying his own weight. Steve couldn't spot any obvious injuries. He decided he could as well take a few minutes to interview him right away.
"Tony?" he asks sharply, and gives Tony's bicep a squeeze. Then he waits, stock still, hoping ardently for an answer, or any reaction at all. There's nothing except for another breath, this time with an audible exhale. It's not much, but he decides it's clearly an improvement.
He was wearing his costume; this was entirely inappropriate.
"He meant every word of it, you know," Pepper said softly. "He didn't want you out because we need your help. It was because he was worried he'd lose you for good."
Tony sighed and pursed his lips. "I'm sorry you don't believe it, but I actually do. If I didn't, you'd still be in storage. I could've picked anyone to tackle this case. I picked you."
"Tony. This isn't a bad thing, when you stop to think about it," Pepper went on, annoyingly calm and all too positive. "This means there's a better way than random chance for people to find their soulmates, if they want to."
After a moment of charged silence, Tony spoke up. "So, uh. There was actually another reason I wanted to stay. Something I wanted to talk about," he began, then stopped, hesitating.
Feeling apprehensive, Steve inched forwards until he came to rest right next to the cage, his button of a nose almost touching the metal rungs.
"It doesn't hurt. Not like some of the other things," Tony said softly. He raised his head, and Steve's hand ended up on his shoulder. He didn't seem to mind, so Steve kept it there. "It's just dead. No backup for me," Tony went on, still facing away. "One body, one life. Like those anti-node fanatics."
He couldn't help throwing his head back again, his spine arching. Iron Man shifted out of the way, so Steve wouldn't bash his nose in, and as he did, his lips found their way to Steve's neck, below his jaw, licking and sucking, like he was so lost in the moment he didn't care if Steve could see his face.
He had to stop thinking about Tony, or he'd spend the entire night distracted. He stashed the leftovers in the fridge, and pictured himself leaving the unwanted thoughts there with them. He'd return to all of that when he was back. For now, what really mattered was the mission.
"So, you're saying Stark has an artifact that can set things on fire? What is it?" he asked.
"I'm in position." Clint's voice rang through the earset Steve had been provided with.
Tony raises his eyebrows; he can probably tell from Steve's expression how bad that was. "Huh. How
"I didn't. That's not why I did it. I swear that's not what it was." Steve tried to make his voice as emphatic as he could, but it didn't seem as if he was getting through.
The first time Steve had met Tony in the ruins, after the warehouse fire, Tony had claimed not to remember anything about how he'd gotten there. Steve had been wondering about that. It sounded like he'd been telling the truth, back then.
When Steve went to sleep that night, the thought that Ultron was constantly awake, his inhuman eyes watching Steve's every move, felt more oppressive than ever before. He was used to a life surrounded by AIs; they had been just as omnipresent eighty-five years ago as they were now. Still, back then, they had always been impersonal, little more than highly evolved voice interfaces, and Ultron's behavior today would've been seen as a serious programming flaw. He hadn't met enough modern AIs to tell if strong personalities and independent thought were more common and encouraged these days.
“Okay, fair enough, there’s that,” Tony admitted, his expression still sullen. “But now I’m not, this isn’t a life-and-death situation, and you can undress me like any sane, normal person would. Let’s just get this over with.” He grabbed the hem of his shirt with his uninjured hand to start pulling it up.
"Wasn't your fault. I shouldn't have gone," Steve says.
After who knew how many days or weeks, Tony's building project was nearly finished. If only his other project had been equally successful. Even though James seemed sympathetic and made the occasional friendly gesture, like bringing Tony an extra slice of bread, or warm water and a bar of soap for the rare opportunity to clean himself up, Tony still hadn't been able to convince him to let him out of the dungeon.
"Well, no, not at first," Bucky admitted. "He only explained it to me last night."
Steve raises his eyebrows in surprise, and yeah, Tony probably doesn't seem the type to be a history buff. Which he isn't, he just used to admire some heroes of the past when he was younger.
"So, all that stuff in your magazine, it really happened?" Bucky had to ask. As much as he knew the others' stance on talking to the prisoner, he was too curious not to.
"It's in the past now, and I'd really like to move on." Tony tried to consciously push his acceptance and forgiveness at Steve, though he knew the synchronization didn't quite work like that. Maybe the feelings behind the ideas would at least be more obvious when he was actively focusing on them, and Steve would understand that Tony was being entirely honest about this.
"If the rest is as good, I just might," Tony said. He traced his fingers down to Steve's neck. Steve figured he must be feeling if the pulse point checked out, which it would, indistinguishable from an organic. He could feel it himself, too, when Tony pressed a little harder, a perfect approximation of a human heartbeat, even though the frame's internal workings would look nothing like human organs.
"If it wasn't you, then call off the drones!" Steve commanded. "Both of you!"
"Steve, this is Happy. Happy, this is Steve. He packs a mean punch and is going to lend you a hand babysitting me," Tony introduces them to each other.
As glad as Bruce was to see that his friends had finally sorted out their issues, this was way out of line. He rapped on the glass, hoping to catch their attention. “Guys. Uhh. Guys. That’s not appropriate quarantine behavior.”
Steve struggles to get a fire going without supplies. Creating a spark is not the issue; his enhanced strength makes that part easy, as long as he has a few dry sticks. But with the unfamiliar plant life around him, finding the right materials for tinder, kindling and firewood takes far too long. Everything is slightly moist with dew, and the bushes that are the closest thing to a forest here have such thin branches that most of them won't burn for longer than a few minutes.
It might. Steve really did need more time to think about it.
"How do you—wait, you said you were there, that night. You heard the whole story when Maya told it?" Tony asked.
Everyone else followed suit, Steve included. The wine tasted good, though Steve was sure he couldn't appreciate the complexities of it. That was, overall, his feeling about the entire meeting: the food was tasty, but he couldn't understand why anyone would wait for ten years to get to eat these particular dishes. Of course, listening to Tony and Justin Hammer constantly snipe at one another also wasn't his idea of a good time.
"To have Tony back where he belongs: in a healthy clone and living in the Tower, instead of that bastard who's stolen his name and frame. And to make Stane answer for his deeds, I hope," Steve said. Just speaking about it made him angry. Stane had done so many unspeakable things. False imprisonment, torture, identity theft, frame theft—all that put together would've earned him a hundred-year sentence in the past. With the current, stricter punishments, it would probably be grounds for a wipe.
Steve lowered his hands, but didn't put the guns away yet. "I take it that Tony doesn't know you're a police officer?"
"I don't think that'd be a good idea," he said bluntly. "Shower?"
"I'm not going to," Steve said.
Miss Potts had brought him a selection of clothes to pick from, and in fifteen minutes, he'd changed into a pair of black jeans and a blue button-down shirt that stretched tight over his enhanced muscles. They'd had his measurements down to the fraction of a millimeter, and Tony had clearly made use of that. Even the combat boots were perfectly fitted.
He patted Tony's cheek. "Tony. Tony, wake up."
He can tell he's outside. There's an earthy scent in the air, like moss and grass, and the surface he's lying on is cold and soggy. Contrasting that is the unmistakable warmth of sunshine on his face, bright even through his closed eyelids. His arms are held against his sides by some material that's wrapped around him, and as he tries to shift his legs, he realizes it covers him all the way, from shoulders to toes. It clearly isn't too thick, considering how he can feel every pebble under his back. The impression he gets is of being swaddled, not of being tied up, which is what he would expect based on his hazy memories of recent events.
Eliana seemed relieved to have Sam backing her up. "Yes, and you have to understand, the caravan was waylaid in the middle of the Rainy Basin. Since they didn't have any skybaxes accompanying them, no one knew of the attack until they'd made it across to Waterfall City. Then, I was first sent to take word to Tony's house, in case any of his friends were there, which is where I met Edwin Jarvis. He's the one who told me to come to you. He sent you this." She held out a small parchment roll; Steve could recognize the Stark seal on it.
He'd known he shouldn't have, and he'd still done it. He'd enjoyed doing it.
"You're a genius, Pepper," Tony declared. "Never let anyone tell you otherwise."
"If you build a bike, you'll invite me for a test drive, won't you?" Steve asked. He picked up the helmet from Tony, and stowed them in the storage compartment.
He was having coffee the next morning, wondering what he was going to do with his day, when the local AI announced that he had a message from Tony Stark. Tony wanted to meet, in person, at the Better You: Cloning, Constructs and Enhancements clinic, at eleven o'clock the very same day.
"I'll keep that in mind," Tony said. "They wouldn't let me borrow that particular frame, anyway, although I guess I could just buy one."
"Oh! Lunch!" Bucky greeted Steve happily as he entered the room with a paper bag in hand.
All three of them were armed, and they also carried a few of the drone-disabling devices Pepper had used back when she'd freed Steve from the Tower. It would be desperate to go against four or more drones in organic frames, but they'd have to try.
"Okay?" Steve seemed taken aback, but nevertheless motioned at an unoccupied stretch of rock at the outskirts of the camp. "Over there? If this is about me and Tony, I can guess it must be a big surprise to you, and—"
Here he was, finally. Street level. Back where he'd started.
Rhodey raised his eyebrows. "Biotech project? Should I be worried?" He nodded towards Tony, casting a pointed glance at the glow of the arc reactor.
"I can't. I'm sorry, Steve, but that's the way it is," Sam confirmed. "Redwing will do almost anything if I ask nicely, but not this."
"I wasn't always the man you've learned to know," Tony went on. He still spoke in that serious tone, completely different from the one he'd used when spinning his previous yarns. "When I turned 18 and got my hands on the inheritance, it wasn't pretty. I'd lost my parents. I'd been told that because of my weak heart, I might not live to be very old myself. The way I saw it, I could either spend my short life moping, or I could have some fun. The latter sounded like the better plan.
"Oh, yeah."
Tony squints at him suspiciously. "Is this some roundabout way of hinting that I should fetch my own coffee and let you join Happy on the security detail?"
Tony turned his head away, not facing Steve's eyes.
"There's a certain satisfaction in imagining him in that position, yeah," Tony said.
"Straight off the assembly line," Hammer confirmed, stepping in front of the drones and spreading his arms. It looked less like a grand gesture, more like a dealer trying to sell used fakes.
"It's not like you're asking me to marry you," Steve said. "I'd like to have a real relationship. See how that goes. Besides, we already know the sex would be great."
Tony leaned on his elbows, his breath hot over Steve's face. "How was that for you?"
After a few final licks, Tony sat down on his haunches, glancing up at Steve. That, right there, was something else that Steve doubted anyone would've believed: Tony Stark looking all smug, utterly debauched, and distinctly submissive. It was a look did things to Steve, lighting up a warmth to challenge Tony's at the pit of his stomach.
Tony put his arm around Steve's waist, leaning his head against Steve's side. "I really don't deserve you. I don't. But thank you, for everything," he murmured.
Steve strips off his uniform, as fast as he can, before he has time to change his mind, and loosens the blankets around Tony so that he can slip under them as well. He settles with his back against a wall, Tony on his lap, and wraps his arms around Tony, hugging him close to maximize skin contact. Steve tends to run hot himself, thanks to his super-soldier metabolism, and he hopes that the added warmth will make a difference.
He's abandoned Tony out here in the untamed highlands. Tony, who's used to five-star hotels and an endless arsenal of gadgets. Steve assumes the kidnappers took everything he had, leaving him with nothing but the clothes on his back, which are as ill-suited for the setting as Tony himself. Tony was prepared for summer weather, and wherever they are, although the sky is clear and sunny, the air is brisk. The current temperature can't be much above 50.
Steve and the others had discussed the option of going public with his recording of Stane's near-confession. So far, they'd decided against that, since it was the best leverage they had left for any unofficial negotiations with SHIELD.
He'd obviously told them something about it later, since Jarvis had known that Tony was alive and that he was here, but back when Pepper had called Steve, it'd seemed like she was genuinely worried about Tony, and like she hadn't known at all what was going on.
So far, things had gone as smoothly as they could've hoped, and Natasha's warnings of an army of Northerners seemed unwarranted.
Steve might be able to shake off a pursuer on a bike, but for Barton to have found him like this, he had to be tracking Steve. That would make running pointless, unless he managed to either shoot Barton before Barton shot him, or damage the bike enough to disable it. Shooting at a police officer would put his name even closer to the top of the most-wanted list. Not the best of plans.
He manages to stand up and take a few steps, but he doesn't get far until he stumbles again, and finds himself on his hands and knees.
The next thing he did feel was someone toeing him in the ribs, sharply. Then what must've been the same boot turned him over on the ground so that he was lying on his back, staring up. His vision cleared slowly, the too-bright haze coalescing into a figure towering above him. It was holding a stun prod.
Tony hadn't guessed the truth, after all.
"I told her not to tell you," Tony said. "I know you, Steve. If you'd heard even half of what you've learned here, would you have been able to keep that to yourself instead of punching Obie in the face?"
"Found him, and lost him again, right away," Steve had to admit. "I also didn't learn anything new about Simon. Not the most successful evening, all in all. I'll go back tonight and try a different approach."
"So, what're you going to do about it?" Sam asked.
Eighty-five years.
"I talked to the boss. He'd like a word with you. Come with me," the man said. The words were inconspicuous, but the way he said them almost sounded like a veiled threat, not giving Tony room to decline.
Tony flashed her a rakish smile, as if he were posing for the fans of Marvels. "Don't worry. I'll be fine. I'm used to this kind of thing," he assured her, and turned to face the would-be kidnappers. "Alright. I'm here. Whatever beef you've got with me, we can settle it without involving the others."
"Huh? Tony asked about me?" Steve blurts out, baffled.
Bucky found himself oddly nervous as Steve approached him, but Steve clearly had no such reservations. As he got closer, he spread his arms in invitation, and when Bucky leaned into it, Steve hugged him tightly.
He'd thought Tony had died, not long ago. The memory of seeing the news, the image of Tony's Malibu mansion as a smoking ruin, was still fresh: how he'd tried to feel something about it, prodded at the idea of Tony being gone like testing an injury to see how bad it was. All he'd gotten was numbness and disbelief. It hadn't felt real. When it'd turned out Tony was, in fact, alive and fine, the relief had been equally underwhelming. He'd not seen Tony since. Considering that Steve was now a fugitive from his own employer, he wasn't expecting to, either, not anytime soon.
They stopped to tend to the wound and wait for Stark to regain consciousness from the second blow Bucky had delivered, this one with the butt of his rifle. Following the instructions from Mona—a distant relative of Lina's who had more experience dealing with dinosaurs than anyone else in the group—they were careful to collect any bloodstained fabrics and bury them. She warned them that the scent would draw out predators, like sharks in the water.
He gets up from his chair to crouch in front of Tony, bringing one hand to frame the thirium reactor. Tony does his best not to flinch at the touch; he really doesn't like it, but he feels like he owes it to Kamski to let him have a proper look.
Then he waited, and waited, and waited some more.
"Wait!" Maya shouted, squirming in their hold. "He's telling you the truth. There's no artifact! There never was!"
"I get that. You're a man with a mission, after all," Tony said. "If
Steve fought like he hadn't since he'd left behind the war. Luckily, these weren't skills that he would easily forget, and his strength and agility gave him an advantage over everyone. He, Sam, and Natasha did their best to hold back the enemies, giving Pepper and Rhodey room to keep working.
Bucky didn't really think there would be any harm in what Stark was asking, but his orders were perfectly clear. "You'll just have to wait that much longer, then."
The sonic taser was designed to be a peaceful means of crowd control, and it definitely didn't deserve approval for that. Even if it doesn't cause pain, it's scary as hell, especially if you don't know it's temporary. Preliminary testing also suggested that repeated or prolonged use could be a significant health risk. Tony doesn't know what reasons CyberLife had to shelve the SR100 line, but it can't be anything comparable.
"Captain, I hope you don't mind me calling you. I got your number from the card you left when you visited Tony's house. I know he hasn't contacted you, and I don't think he will. He didn't want me to, either, but honestly, I'm starting to get concerned, and I'd like to talk to you. If you have time tomorrow, I'd be happy to meet. Before one o'clock would be best for me."
Tony headed straight for them, his expression somewhere between amused and contemptuous. "So, your latest, Justin?"
"I helped capture him, and I was his warden since the beginning." As Bucky went on, the words started to flow easier, everything he'd wanted to talk about for so long spilling out. "They rescued me after the crash, they told me the dinosaurs were evil and that Tony was evil, too, and I believed every word of it. I thought they were helping people, so I wanted to help them. I didn't realize it was all backwards. Even when I saw them do things I didn't like, I still thought they were in the right when it came to dinosaurs. Tony tried to tell me the truth, and I wouldn't listen. Not until it was almost too late."
The gear he's got includes a few hooks. He unravels a length of paracord to reveal the thin inner strands, which will make the fishing line. All he needs now is bait. That requires digging around for worms. Not something he's ever envisioned himself doing, but hey, at least dirt under the nails is less painful than needles.
Tony was alive, after all.
"A friend of a friend," Steve lied. "It's work-related, too."
"Sorry to interrupt your meal, but the Mayor asked for us to take Stark to the Vault," Bucky told him.
"Hydra," Pepper answered. "That was years ago, of course, but—"
"He wouldn't," Steve objected.
Tony. He was still in Tony Stark's hotel room, in Tony Stark's bed, and the reason he was feeling all groggy was that he'd spent a good part of the night having the most amazing sex with Tony.
Steve turned to look at him. The flames reflected from his eyes, but there was something fierce in them beyond that. "What if it did, though?" he asked, his voice still subdued, and yet, there was a strength to it, the same unmovable resolve that he would use to challenge any general, no matter how decorated. "And last night? What if that meant something to me?"
He walked over to the two tied-up guards. One had his eyes closed, apparently still unconscious. The other glared daggers at Steve over the fabric gagging his mouth. Steve glared right back as he knelt on the ground in front of him, going for the most intimidating look he could muster. He'd been told he could be terrifying on a bad day, and that door standing between him and rescuing Tony made this one of the worst.
"You should reconsider," she said. "Do what they ask. There's only so long you can hold out like this."
"A system where humans are not enslaved by monsters," the Mayor said, casting a glance at the dinosaur chained to the corner of the room.
There were no eyewitness reports of the current scene aside from the cab driver who'd spotted the flames and smoke and called in the authorities. He hadn't seen anyone at the site, and the firemen had been grim when Steve had asked about potential victims. If anyone had been inside the building when they'd gotten here, that person wouldn't be alive anymore. No one could've survived this.
He had no idea how long it had been since the Northerners had condemned him to rot in his cell without food or water. There was no light aside from the small lantern, so his perception of the time of the day was long gone. He also couldn't tell how much the constant gnawing headache was courtesy of Rumlow, who had paid him a few visits to add more bruises to his collection, and how much because of dehydration and desperate hunger. He was cold, too; his clothes had been chosen to suit the humid warmth of the jungle, not for an underground cell. The bullet graze on his shoulder, which had already been healing nicely, didn't seem any better now than it had on the way here, twinging whenever he moved his right arm.
"Yeah, I got that," Tony says, frustrated. "But why? Do you have a message to bring or something?"
One of the advantages of a new, temporary frame was that most people wouldn't recognize Steve while he was in it. Dressed in standard-issue clothes as he was, he could've been any low-level grunt. He walked past a number of colleagues who didn't look at him twice, let alone greet him. Plenty of people did greet Tony, and he smiled back at all of them. It was a practiced, joyless look that almost made him seem as if he was in a fake frame, too.
They had been teammates. They hadn't been friends. Tony could really only blame himself for that, too. He'd been too afraid of whatever quirk of genetics had connected the two of them. Maybe if he hadn't been, things would've been different. Maybe Steve would've told him about Barnes before it was too late. Maybe he would've signed the Accords.
The weight of Steve's palm leaves Tony's back, and he frowns. "What do you mean? That makes no sense. My predecessor went rogue and they lost contact with him. I know you're a good person. You wouldn't do something like that."
"As Mr. Rhodes already pointed out, it's obvious you should accept the offer if you wish to minimize the resources expended on this matter," Jarvis replied. "Although one could call the option somewhat unsatisfying."
"Never mind that," Pepper said. She looked very pale, but her expression was more thoughtful than shocked. "The most important thing is, he survived back then. He might also have survived this. You said you saw no trace of him today?"
********************
Whatever the results, it'd be painful, and it wouldn't change anything; whether they were a match or not, Steve would still hate him and wouldn't want anything to do with him.
Steve strains his ears, trying to catch it again, but it's perfectly quiet. He can't help wondering if his mind is playing tricks on him; he could have sworn that was Tony calling out his name from somewhere on the fell beyond the hut.
"Tony Stark?" he says. "My name is Steve. Mr. Kamski sent me to you."
"Is this really worth the risks?" Tony went on. "There's no telling if he can really help me keep myself in check. His powers might be similar, but they're a result of science gone wrong. Mine are, well, who knows what. We're not the same."
"Tony? Did you check out the email I sent?" Rhodey's voice came through the workshop loudspeakers.
"What's that? Do you have something against androids?" Steve asks sharply, his eyes narrowing as he looks from Rhodey to Tony.
"I'm sorry, Tony," Ultron replied, still sticking to the false name. "Even if I could, every projection I've run says it'd do you no good."
"You could still turn around," Ultron suggested. "No matter what you think you can achieve here, it's not going to work."
He had no external backups; if they wanted him dead, he was gone. There was no way out.
On any other day, Steve would've insisted that they tell him right away. Today, he physically lacked the energy to argue. He leaned the side of his head against the window next to him and stared at the view outside.
"If only Tony had listened to reason, just this once," Pepper muttered, her eyes still on the leg plate she was wrestling with.
He should've built a power gauge into the damn thing. Sitting in his cell, he occasionally uncovered the sunstone and contemplated its sea-green glow, trying to decide if it looked fainter than usual. It was difficult to be sure.
"SHIELD files list him as missing," came the answer in a relaxed, almost drawling voice. "Some sightings over the past years, here and in Europe, but current location is unknown."
Tony probably deserved it.
Tony looked disappointed for a moment, but pulled himself together quickly and gave Steve a wistful smile. "Fair enough. I understand. Still, in case you change your mind, I'll try to be at the bar downstairs tomorrow night, if I can."
He tried to convince himself that Tony was lying to him to throw him off balance for some reason, but he couldn't imagine what that reason might be. Tony hadn't stopped him from breaking the other Avengers out of prison. He could've. Tony hadn't come looking for him. No matter how good Wakanda's defenses were, Steve was pretty sure Tony could've found him, if he'd really wanted to. There weren't many things Tony couldn't do if he set his mind on it. That was one of the reasons why Steve had always been so impressed by him.
The more Bucky thought about the situation, the more confused he got. It felt like things didn't add up. If only he could be sure who to trust.
"What Captain Rogers suggests does, in fact, sound like a very opportune tactic, sir," the AI replied.
This was an Italian place located in an Italian quarter; Steve was very obviously not Italian. Rather, he knew he had enough features to identify him as Irish. If this was a mafia hangout, it might've been a better approach to wear the costume after all.
He'd set things right, no matter how many lifetimes it would take him.
"I'm here, now," Tony called out. "I don't suppose anyone's here to meet me?"
Steve placed one hand on Iron Man's metal-covered thigh to keep him in place a little longer. "I guess you're not going to let me reciprocate?" he tried.
Not much later, Iron Man made his actual entrance into Steve's life outside a museum in Stuttgart, with a flash and a bang and blaring loud music.
Tony gets up and starts for the stairs; Steve follows.
They sat down on the bench, a gap wide enough for an additional person between them. In front of them opened a beautiful view over the lake: the first colorful hints of an approaching sunset were playing on water that was smooth as glass. They spent a moment in perfect silence, with nothing but the faintest whisper of the wind in the branches of the trees around them.
He was in a stylish observation lounge, facing a room-height window with a slightly curved surface showing an awe-inspiring view of the blue oceans, white clouds, and green-brown continents of Earth. There was enough traffic outside to make it look realistic; when he looked carefully, he could spot shuttles climbing up the gravity well and several stations and ships in orbit. The room itself gave the impression of affluence just by its size; it would be a waste of life support resources to have so much empty space just for the sake of appearance. There wasn't much furniture, just a bar-style open kitchen against the back wall and three black leather club chairs with an angular design set around a matte black sofa table close to the window.
"How's the frame handling?" Peggy asked conversationally as they waited for the elevator to climb up to the administrative floor.
"It doesn't, but let me tell you one thing," Steve says, his gaze locked with Tony's, captivating in its intensity. "For all intents and purposes, he was me. Our hardware and software are identical. And if it had actually been me, I would've willingly given you that regulator and whatever other parts you needed."
Jarvis was looking as grim as Steve felt next to him, but he'd still politely raised his hand to ask for his turn. "I don't know what hearsay you're basing that on. I've spoken to one of the leaders of the convoy, and she made it absolutely clear that he surrendered to protect everyone else in the group. That's exactly the kind of thing he would do, giving himself up to make sure no one else is hurt."
"No. There's no guidebook for this, because the lesson I learned was about the two of us," Steve insists, keeping his voice as steady as he can. "I don't want to fight you, Tony. Not anymore. I don't know if it's possible to get over everything that's between us, but I want to try."
"Of course," replied the short blond one. "That's what most of these parts come from: dinosaur-shaped vehicles."
"Yes, please," Tony said, finally sounding like he actually wanted it.
"Can't say that I do," Steve admits, "but without me, you'd be locked up in some terrorist hideout by now. Not to mention that I've kept watch all night, making sure you don't freeze to death. So, yes, Tony. The least you could do is to thank me," Steve says, the tone of his voice about as patronizing as it's possible to get.
“I guess it was the right call, then,” Bruce mumbled, as if he hadn’t been quite sure of that.
Tony had been so furious, Steve hadn't even been able to apologize to him properly. He was right to be angry, too. What Steve had done had been disgusting. He couldn't deny he'd been spying on Tony, but it had been more than that. He needed to apologize, but he also wanted to make Tony understand how much he'd wanted it and how much he'd enjoyed it, because otherwise, if he just left, Tony would think that nothing about the night they'd spent together had been real, and that couldn't have been further from the truth. It had been one of the best nights of Steve's life.
"Nowhere," Steve insisted, his voice rough through the chokehold.
"Do you know anything more about what happened, anything at all?" Steve prompted.
Sam isn't sure whether he's more worried for Steve, who's gone missing, or for Tony, who seems to have lost his mind.
He spotted a stall with a variety of clothing on offer and stopped in front of it. The vendor's frame was a plastic fake with light pink skin that made her look uncannily like a mannequin. Considering the skimpy top she wore, leaving her shoulders and arms bare even in this cool weather and accentuating the artificial look, it was probably on purpose. She stared at Steve unashamedly.
"I'm not sure he remembered that. He went to see Jan," Jarvis said.
Tony gave him a lopsided grin. "That's sweet of you, but not what I meant. You're not going to be limited by that deal you made with Obie anymore. You'll be able to swap, too, if you want. And cost isn't an issue. Name any frame you'd like, and I'll make it happen."
He closed his eyes. Reality faded away, and then coalesced again into a white corridor almost entirely devoid of features, continuing until it disappeared into the distance. There were closed white doors along both sides, and for a second, he feared he'd have to spend hours breaking through all of them, but when he turned around, he saw that one right next to him was wide open.
"So, what kind of power output are we talking about here?" he asks right away, because he knows enough to put two and two together.
Now that Tony had given him the low-down, Ultron allowed Steve access to all the material related to the case. He spent the spare time he had before the lunch meeting delving into it: various analyses and eyewitness accounts of the bombing, and videos of what Tony claimed wasn't a suicide. Looking at the events from an outside point of view, it did very much look like one.
That sounded very much like she meant they could ask Tony about it. "Can we talk to him?" Steve checked.
Happy returned with his second coffee, placed it on the table, and started pacing instead of sitting down.
And for the first time in ages, they actually were.
Tony let out a rueful chuckle. If it were that easy, he wouldn't have a problem, would he? "Yeah. Neither of which is really an option. You've not met him. He's…" He ran his hands over his face, searching in vain for words that didn't sound like platitudes, but his wit was failing him. "I get it now why dad always talked about him. He's one of a kind."
"I know how that is," Steve said, brushing his thumb soothingly over Tony's skin. He could feel Tony's heart pounding beneath his palm, fast and anxious.
He was glad he was wearing the sunglasses.
Steve does that thing where he squares his shoulders and lifts his chin, looking like he stepped straight out of a CyberLife commercial. It's almost as if his LED shines a little brighter. When he speaks, it's in the official, more machine-like voice that he reverts to when asked about his functions. "My skills include a variety of martial arts disciplines ranging from Brazilian jiu-jitsu to Wing Chun. I also know how to use most commonly available firearms, although legally I'm not allowed to carry any."
"Excuse me," he raised his voice to catch their full attention. "I'm trying to look into what could have caused this fire. Did any of you see or hear anything unusual, before or after the alarm went off?"
Steve leaned back on the couch, trying not to get riled up. If he'd questioned for one moment whether this person was really Tony, there was no uncertainty left in his mind anymore. Few people had ever been able to get under his skin as fast.
When his teeth start chattering, he has to admit he can't sit here much longer, even though the thought of standing up again makes him want to scream.
As things were, he thought that now that he'd somehow survived all that, things would slowly start getting better again, settle into some kind of a balance. Of course, the universe had another surprise in store for him, instead.
Steve walked over to her, and the other two had gathered there as well. She was still sitting on the floor, looking past them, her eyes wide, worrying her lip. Whatever it was that she was seeing, it clearly wasn't good.
Steve had the gun trained on them again, ready to fire as soon as the next attack came—aiming for the legs to keep it non-lethal—when the door opened.
Tony frowned at Steve's vague answer, but didn't push him to elaborate. "Not at such, no. It was more of a marriage of convenience," he said instead, continuing his account. "Hydra took out my parents but left me alive, probably because they thought I was too airheaded to understand what was going on around me. I wasn't, though. I tried to put up a fight, which made me a nuisance that had to be dealt with. Meanwhile, in Stark Interplanetary, Obie thought my little rebellion wasn't in the best interests of the company, or him. Joining forces gave them both what they wanted. Obie got SI and all the perks that come with being Tony Stark, and Hydra got him in their pocket. World domination secured for the foreseeable future."
"No," he replied.
"My programming includes standard first-aid responses. The chassis is equipped with instant full-body support crash foam. Emergency anti-grav packs can be found under each seat—"
It occurred to Steve that he might have more to contribute to Tony's plans than he'd first thought. "I think I know someone who'd be willing to help. Do you know of the resistance movement?"
As the pack came loose, a shrill alarm sound sliced through the air. "Alert! Property damage detected!" the cab complained.
Steve had been surprised by this as well, though there were ways to explain it. "It could be a different group. We confiscated most of the tech, but the building still has the right infrastructure, like the plumbing and ventilation for cleanrooms. Someone could've seen the opportunity and taken advantage of it."
She sighed and turned to face him, her face very serious. "Yes. He has." She stepped closer to him, her hand on his arm, her lips right next to his ear. "He's not the man you used to know, Steve. Things aren't what they seem," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "Be careful."
Steve doesn't answer that right away, a thoughtful look passing across his face, his LED flashing yellow to signal that he's using more processing power. "No, I've not been told any details," he finally answers.
"Good, because that's exactly what I want." Steve stepped closer to Tony, driving him against the closed door, going for another kiss.
"More afraid that I might die of old age before we even get to appetizers," Tony said.
He turned around to face the others. "Definitely barred from the inside," he told them. "Did you question the guards?"
"Sorry, the answer's still no," Steve said.
"When you put it like that, it all sounds a lot less scary," Tony said, and leaned closer to Steve to kiss him again, the touch of Steve's lips against his more soothing than exciting.
"Is Tony still working for SHIELD?" Steve asked.
"It's been a very long night for you. You should probably lie down," Pepper suggested.
"If you don't mind that I might be rusty," Tony returned.
Steve sat back in his chair, taking in the room around him. The restaurant had ten tables of varying sizes, half of which were currently occupied. Judging by appearances, most of the customers were Italian, making Steve stick out like a sore thumb with his blond hair and pale skin. At a glance, none of the others caught his attention. He couldn't spot any weapons, neither overtly carried, nor obvious signs of hidden ones.
He heard Pepper's heels click against the floor as she approached him. "Tony," she said, a question and an accusation in one word.
What was worse, there were others trapped here aside from him and Seren. He'd seen the
These memories felt more distant than the viscerally real recollection of lying on the cold concrete, his team dead and dying around him, the pain of the stun prod coursing through his body. That could've happened half a minute ago. The interrogation was somewhere far in the past. He knew that couldn't be right. He supposed his mind must've been scrambled by being stuck into VR for interrogation right after the frame had died.
He tried asking for an overview of the case he was supposed to be working on instead, and ran into a brick wall with that, too. "Tony said he wants to go through that with you tomorrow, so you'll just have to wait patiently, Cap," Ultron informed him, and if the AI could've made the nickname sound more mocking than he did, Steve didn't know how.
Bucky tried to picture the dashing adventurer from the magazine as a lackey to evil lizards who'd subjugated humans, and he couldn't quite see it, but the Mayor was right. Everything he knew about Tony Stark came from stories. It was entirely possible the man wasn't as heroic as his chroniclers had made him to be.
"Copy that. Try to get me a clear line from the south, if you can," Clint answered her.
The instant the door to Steve's apartment had closed behind them, Tony's hands were on him, grabbing the lapels of his jacket. Steve obliged, shrugging his shoulders so Tony could work it off and drop it on the floor. He moved on to unzipping Steve's shirt, and tossed that aside, too.
Steve wasn't surprised if he looked a little shaken. He was. "Sort of," he said.
He followed her to the elevators in silence, trying to keep his nerves in check.
Steve looked at the pier next to him. The platform wasn't very high above them, but there were no stairs or ladders leading up anywhere nearby. He couldn't abandon Maya in the frigid water.
"I'm glad it didn't work," Steve added, his voice still harsh.
"Hah, sure, you've got it," Tony promised. Unlike last time, he didn't wait for Steve to undress him, but pulled off his sweater and undershirt in one go, and dropped them on the armchair with far less attention than he'd paid to Steve's costume.
He still looked gorgeous.
In spite of his resolve to stay calm, Steve can't help grinding his teeth. It's as if the days he's spent thinking about Tony, but not actually talking to him have made him forget why it was so difficult to get along with him in the first place. But Steve has sworn to himself that he wants things to change. He's not going to get pulled into another argument. He's going to try his damnedest to make Tony understand what he realized out there.
From what Bucky had heard, many dinosaurs were supposed to be smart, but it was hard to picture this particular four-legged brute as being more intelligent than any other wild animal. Could it be trying to give orders to Stark? He couldn't quite make himself believe that. If anything, the conversations seemed like an owner trying to soothe a dog—and Stark was definitely the owner, not the dog. At one point, he even stopped his work and walked over to pat the creature's bony crest, next to the two huge and dangerous-looking horns. Bucky had to step in, then. He was supposed to be keeping guard, after all.
"It's just that even if all goes well, and I manage to convince myself I'm not an immediate risk to everyone around me," Tony began again, looking up at Steve. "I'm trying to picture what my future might look like, a year from now, or five years, and I have no idea. I think about going back to my old life, pretending none of this happened, and that doesn't feel right. I'll always be carrying this fire inside me now, no matter what, and that changes things. It's almost like I don't know who I am. The war already left me feeling different, but this—I think of that man who poses on the covers of Marvels, and that's not me, not anymore."
"We'll set off first thing in the morning," Sam said resolutely.
"They teach you this at mechanic school?" Steve joked.
"Seren won't attack you. She's thankful you've made the right call," Stark assured him.
"No, I'm here and very selfishly enjoying this." Slowly and hesitantly, Tony reached out to place his hand on Steve's bicep. "It's good. Just hard to believe. I keep expecting I'll wake up and you'll be gone."
"No, that's exactly what I need, I just think bed would be better," Steve breathed. "That, and you're wearing too many clothes."
"I'm all ears," Tony said, glancing down at him.
"That kind of thing is a part of a PA's job," Tony says defensively. "It's what she's getting paid for. Quite well, too, though probably not well enough. She probably deserves a raise. Make a note and remind me to do that."
Tony settled down in front of Steve, a relieved smile on his lips. "Definitely. Better than for ages. You? I hope that rough wake-up wasn't a sign of how your night was."
Tony hadn't actually talked about any of that. It could explain some of his behavior; he'd definitely had to grow up a lot in a short time, and facing so much death was rare in a world where someone with enough money could potentially live forever.
"Yeah, we probably should," Tony said, looking thoughtful as well.
Tony probably hadn't left New York at all during the decades Steve had spent in the ice. Steve hadn't thought of that. The world outside planet Earth had changed just as much from Tony's perspective as Steve's. "I'd love to join you," he offered. "If you'd like that."
Steve pursed his lips.The source of that information had been Ultron, who seemed like one of the least trustworthy individuals he'd met in the future so far. "I don't really know what to think or to believe anymore," he said.
Tony smirked at him and ran his hand up to take Steve's chin between his fingers. "You think I'm still pretty?"
So, Bucky bit his tongue when he felt the others were being too relentless, dragging Stark up and pushing him to walk faster. Hurrying was a good idea; Bucky had no desire to spend more time than absolutely necessary in this jungle, and it'd taken them almost two days to cross on the way in, when they hadn't been slowed down by a prisoner.
"You shouldn't thank me for that," Bucky told him, forcing himself to look Steve in the eye, even though he wanted to disappear under one of the rocks around them. "It's my fault Tony was there in the first place."
"I could bring a doctor to take a look at you," Bucky suggested. Surely the Mayor would agree to that, because if Stark truly was badly ill, he wouldn't be able to work until he got better—and if he wasn't, a doctor would be able to tell.
Tony's flying a kite.
It's the best plan he's come up with so far. Tony has probably spotted the place as well and is on his way there, but following his earlier decision, Steve doesn't linger on that thought, not when he's finally found something to be hopeful about.
Fully naked, he stepped over to where Tony was standing, and went for the zipper at the front of his coveralls. Opening it revealed nothing but bare skin.
There was only one solution to the situation that Bucky could think of.
"Stane is in custody, on charges of stealing your identity," Steve said, his face and voice undoubtedly showing how pleased he was about this.
He'd survived, against all odds. He had a vague memory of seeing Steve, even though that made no sense. Steve had to be hundreds of miles away. He must've been dreaming.
He cups Tony's face between both hands and bows to kiss him on the forehead. Of course, Tony is still deeply unconscious and entirely unresponsive—if he weren't, Steve would never hear the end of it.
Luckily, the Finn hasn't gone far. The rain seems to have stopped for good, and Tapio is sitting on a camp stool by the lake, fishing. He casts a brief glance at the approaching Steve, and nods and hums in greeting before turning his attention back to his line.
After almost six tedious hours on the US9, he reached the intersection that took him towards smaller roads. From there, they kept shrinking the further he went, until he found himself on a dirt track through wooded hills, occasionally passing cabins hidden amongst the trees.
Bucky was probably being childish with his awe, and he needed to get over it.
When he finally walked through the inconspicuous door and down the few steps into the Groggy Cod, still in costume, his combined concern for Tony and frustration for his slow progress had reached a level where he was almost hoping for a fight. Unlike last time, he had no need to avoid attention. On the contrary, he let the door slam shut loud enough that most eyes in the room were on him when his boots hit the floor.
Steve tried his best to appear casual and unconcerned; considering his frame, he was pretty sure it worked, too. "Probably not. It's not important. What was it that you were saying?"
Steve glanced at the damaged bit of the VR assembly again. It didn't look like much. He wasn't sure if they could trust Ultron in this—although, on the other hand, maybe they should be glad Ultron hadn't just complied with the order and shut everything down, and that Stane had gone for the quick solution of pulling a gun instead of pulling the virtual plug.
In hindsight, in light of everything he'd now learned, his earlier anger about Tony wanting him as a pawn for his plans seemed premature and misplaced. He still thought that Tony could've planned all of this better, but he believed Tony's words, that he'd wanted Steve out of storage to protect him.
"In case any of you actually care, I've made a safe retreat," Clint informed them.
"182 744 561 - 2," Tony recites. Pepper would be amazed—but this is different than forgetting dates or personal details. This is a number he can't get out of his head. "It was a combat unit. Reinforced chassis, servos like it could bench press a truck. Auditory and optical biocomponents more advanced than any I've seen. Looked male. Blond. As gorgeous as they come."
Tony thinks he won't be looking forward to it, himself. He'll probably spend the following month dreading it, both because his previous memories of that place aren't particularly great, and because he's terrified of confronting all their issues in earnest. There's a good chance that the whole thing will backfire, and this delicate truce that they've built will dissolve to nothing. Still, it's worth a shot. It's not as if things between them can get much worse than they were.
Tony stood up again, frowning at him. "You've got the best reflexes money can buy. You really shouldn't be stumbling. Maybe I should call the clinic, have them take a look."
Just the idea of a possible way out felt great. Instead of having to indefinitely grit his teeth and passively suffer this situation he'd never wanted to be in, he'd just come up with the beginnings of an escape plan.
Before Tony had let his hand down, Steve captured it between both of his. "That definitely looked like you've learned a thing or two."
The solution to the situation came from Fury, who had an alternative offer: Steve could keep working for SHIELD, and they'd arrange a proper apartment for him, instead of the quarters he'd had so far. The only catch was that he'd be stationed in Washington D.C.
"SHIELD?" Pepper asked.
Happy offered him a bottle of water, and he accepted it with a muttered thanks. Pepper was eyeing him with the usual concern, but didn't say anything, probably out of courtesy.
Yinsen has given him a week. There's no way he can fix both himself and this android within a week. Besides, his best bet for saving himself is the opposite of repairing the android.
At the inn, the familiar receptionist was back, and when Steve asked him for a shot of bourbon, he squinted at Steve, looking more alert than Steve had ever seen him. "You were here the other night, weren't you?" he asked while pouring the drink. "Are you Steve?"
As he had already heard, Tony's parents had died just three years after Steve had been sentenced. Now that he knew who had been behind the takeover, it seemed to fit the pattern. The Starks would've tried to stand up against what Hydra was doing with SHIELD, and so they had been eliminated. Tony had probably been considered either too young and too insignificant, or a potential ally, and left alive because of that.
Tony stepped back and caught hold of Steve's hands as they fell away from him. "Yeah. True. That conversation. I need to get it right, this time. Talk first. I'll try not to ruin it."
"I convinced her," Stark said, with emphasis on the pronoun, "that since you're armed, which is something she's not familiar with, she wouldn't be able to take down the entire group without getting hurt in the process. Which means we're not worth the trouble for a quick snack. You're welcome."
Tony works like a man possessed, first from the pilot's seat, and then, with those options exhausted, from inside the AIM compound they’ve cleared earlier, digging through the surveillance data for any clues and trying to adjust the available tech for the search. All the others try to help to the best of their abilities: Natasha offering local knowledge and a calming influence; Clint trying to lighten the mood with wisecracks that Tony fails to return; Thor and Hulk patrolling the surroundings to make sure there are no enemies lurking. Sam stays close to Tony, assisting him in the engineering and coding. At one point, he catches Tony's hands shaking so badly he drops a wrench. Later, he's shocked to actually pick up a few mistakes that Tony makes while trying to write a search algorithm into AIM's system.
All of it was amazing, and Steve enjoyed every minute, and yet, he still found himself thinking of how much better it would've been to see all of this with Tony by his side. Tony would've been so excited about all these sights, and could've told him of the myths related to the carvings, translating the various saurian languages into English where Steve's skills failed him. Sam and his family knew English as well, but to them, it was the language of the people who'd enslaved their ancestors, so they weren't particularly fond of it. They'd mostly learned it since it was helpful when communicating with recent arrivals to the island, like Steve.
No matter how much tension the day had already contained, Steve hadn't been as nervous as he was approaching the door to their rendezvous location. Maybe he was worrying over nothing. Maybe Tony had given in to Rhodey's pleas—as hard as that was to imagine—and run and made it out.
"What do you mean?" Bucky asked, taken aback by her reaction.
"Thank you, ma'am, that would be great," he said.
All the more reason to do what they were planning.
Tony raised his hand to feel around his skull, making his already tangled hair stick up even worse, then shrugged. "I don't know. I don't think so. No headache, and I don't have any bruises, either."
"I've got them right here," she said.
And just like that, the fire had been rekindled in Tony's chest, the hope flaring white-hot again in spite of all his self-reproach mere moments ago. "If it did," he said very slowly, very carefully, so terribly afraid to get this wrong. "If it did, then I would like to know. Because it may have meant something to me, as well."
"Nice to see you too, Buck," Steve said, and handed over the spoils. "Any news today?"
"Very," Steve said, crossing his arms. "Why am I here, Tony? And why now? Why after eighty-five years? Why not twenty, or fifty?"
He half expected Sam to laugh at that, but he just looked thoroughly puzzled. "Huh. And you believe him?"
Tony grabbed at Steve's hair, gasping. "Shit, that's—that's different."
"I don't mind a few secrets, if you don't," Steve lied. "You've been good to me. Let me return the favor. I'm sure it'll be all right. If it's not, we'll stop."
"Come here, you," Tony ordered, reaching to put one hand on Steve's back and to pull him into another, sloppy kiss. As his hands slid down Steve's body, he made a displeased hum. "You're still wearing pants."
That voice and that face sent a chill of terror down Steve's spine, his throat closing up almost as if Stane's fingers were squeezing it again. He bit his teeth together, hard, taking deep, steadying breaths.
Tony had gotten the knot open, and tossed Steve's tie carelessly to the desk on top of his cap. He then ran his hands along Steve's upper body, over his shoulders, down his sides, in a movement that almost mirrored what Steve had done, but he could tell there was more to it than that. Tony was surreptitiously checking for hidden weapons. In spite of what he'd said, he didn't fully trust Steve yet. Steve had to admit it was sensible, and it was also kind of impressive that Tony could still keep a cool head even when he was clearly as excited as Steve was.
"Steve, you should see the exit. Get him out," Natasha told him. "And hurry. Whatever you're doing, it's not helping."
He wanted Tony much closer than this and not on the cold floor.
The view zoomed out to reveal the rest of the VR chair he was in and his torn and bloodstained clothing. Next to him stood the younger version of the very same frame, uninjured, in an immaculate suit and an all-too-familiar smirk on his face.
Steve bit back the defensive dismissal that was already on his lips.
His emotions flipped from overflowing joy to crushing concern when the dinosaur got closer and he could see more detail.
"I can't tell you," Tony repeated.
"I haven't missed that," Steve said. "Honestly, it's been making me uncomfortable."
Steve arched his eyebrows. "Why would you even have someone like that as chief of security?"
The two creatures were clearly having a conversation, but to Tony’s ears, every word just sounded like “tsum,” spoken in deep, rumbling voices.
"Better, I think," Bucky replied. Even though he still sounded weak, at least he could talk properly, without the raspy undertone or the constant coughing fits.
"I'm so glad you're here," Tony said, lazily caressing Steve's side.
"Sorry, I keep forgetting that you've been out of the ice for less than a week," Tony said sheepishly.
“Well, fine. Steve Rogers, you’re a pretentious, self-righteous asshole,” Tony declared.
He opened his eyes again, looking at Tony, letting the slowly brewing anger show on his face. "You wanted to use me, too. Just like him."
Damn, but wallowing made him poetic.
"Whoa," Tony said, sounding awed, a wide smile on his lips. "I think we may have hit the jackpot."
The session was routine, and Tony kept getting distracted, which made him feel guilty every time he caught himself. He should've been focusing on Rhodey. Instead, all he could think of were Steve and the plan. He wasn't going to tell Rhodey about it—he was pretty sure Rhodey would try to talk him out of it—but he needed to make some kind of an excuse.
The night is beyond miserable.
"Any chance he'll make it?" Steve gestured towards the gurney that was being lifted to an ambulance.
"Anyway," Rhodey said, "My point still stands: this is one study, with a limited number of participants. It's not enough to say anything for sure."
"Of course you do." Steve moved his other hand to Tony's back to pull him closer and into another kiss, first on the lips, then, playfully and sloppily, on Tony's cheeks and chin. Tony smiled, but stayed still, as if partly lost in thought, so Steve stopped and let go of him, giving him space.
Close to eleven o'clock, the meeting was finally over, and Steve could start his long drive upstate. Looking at the map, he'd estimated that getting to Tony's hideout should take him around seven hours, plus whatever breaks he wanted to take. If he hadn't needed to refuel, he might not have taken any.
"Yes, and she told it again, later, in more detail. She didn't know all of it, though. I was hoping you might fill in the gaps," Steve replied. "That's all I'm asking. Tell me what really happened, and I'll leave you alone."
"Well, let me know when you have. And just so we're clear, I'll be happy with what you pick, too," Tony said, giving Steve's thigh a pat.
He remembered how he'd felt when he'd gotten the email about the matching results, and the exact words on the message:
"Seems like you two have things to talk about. I'll be close by, if you need anything," the nurse says, and heads out of the room.
He beckoned to Pepper and Rhodey, and shouted out to the others. "Sam! Natasha! Time to go!"
Tony included samples from his mom and dad among the first test runs of their pipeline. The result was a loud and clear positive match. They really had been soulmates, then, no doubt about it. He raised yet another toast for dad that night.
When he wasn't around Tony, he kept thinking he'd like to be, but when they were in the same place, he felt oddly restless and anxious, like he couldn't wait to get away—even if he simultaneously wanted to be there. It would've been difficult to explain to someone else. It was as if there were two layers to his feelings, separate but merging together into one confusing tangle, so that he couldn't tell where one ended and the other began. On top of that, Steve got the impression that Tony was actively avoiding any situation where it'd just be the two of them alone. He wondered if anyone else noticed it. On the surface, Tony was his regular self, after all, charming and abrasive at the same time.
Something shifted where the noise had come from; a sheet of corrugated iron that'd been a part of the roof lifted up slightly and then fell down again. There was no mistaking the sound that followed for creaking metal. It was a frustrated growl, followed by coughing.
"You think we should say no, don't you?" Tony asked, staring at the passing cars.
"But you don't remember anything at all about the fire?" Steve asked again.
He knows what he should do. He should tell Steve to leave. Go back to CyberLife, and become someone else's problem. Unfortunately, that someone else would shut him down and put him in a box in the basement, and Tony can't do that to him.
"Right, I'll do that. Thank you for your time."
He flopped back onto the couch, staring ahead but not really seeing the room around him.
Tony returns his hand to Steve's shoulder. "I swear I'm not letting anyone take you, no matter what," he promises, as reassuringly as he can. "You saved my life, as did your predecessor. I can't ever repay that favor to him, but I'll do my best to help you."
Had Tony been anyone else, Steve would've protested loudly at his coddling. He would've insisted that he was fine and pushed away the blanket, as soothing as it was, and pointed out that what he lacked in physical strength, he made up for in strength of character. He might have added that although his slender frame and youthful looks often had people mistaking him for a kid half his age, he wasn't easily frightened. To further emphasize his words, he might even have refused the offer of a shoulder to lean on, as much as he enjoyed the safe feeling of another body so close to his.
"Yes and no," the familiar voice of the AI replied, taking Steve by surprise. "My counterpart in the workshop self-destructed to make sure Ultron would gain no information from him. I am a local backup with limited computational capacity."
He grabbed the tubing and pushed in the first dose.
His heart gave a painful lurch, his legs started to fold, and darkness overtook him again.
When the phone was picked up again, it wasn't Tony's voice at the other end, but still the receptionist. "So, I asked him, but he didn't want to take the call."
As it happens, he does know better. Not like Tony would've passed up the chance to get it on with a guy who looks nice and is on the single-digits list of people on the planet who are as smart as he is. Definitely not back when he was still busy getting it on with anyone who was even vaguely interesting.
Outside, it has started raining again. The patter of raindrops on the roof mixes with the crackling of the fire. It's very cozy, but Steve doesn't feel particularly restful. Instead, his unease grows worse and worse as time passes. Tony should have reached him already, if he were coming this way, and it doesn't make sense for him to go anywhere else in this weather.
"Oh, he tried to. But I already had the repulsor pump then, and the cover plate made the blade slip. Gave me a nasty gash on the arm. I can show you the scar sometime," Tony replied, shrugging his left shoulder. "Like I said, by that time, the noise had brought the others out of their tents, and we managed to subdue Cauac. Turned out he was part of a cult that claimed to be the offspring of the original temple builders. Some villagers we met later told us that it was nonsense, and that no one really knew the deities the temple was dedicated to anymore."
The memory kept haunting him: Tony, on his knees, bleeding out, coughing and gasping for air that wouldn't come. Even worse, it kept shifting into the vision from just half a day earlier, of Tony lounging in bed next to Steve, of the lean muscles of his bare chest and the golden glow of his skin.
Steve didn't wait for him to get any further than that. He leaped forwards, bowling Stane over, but he was still a few seconds too slow; he heard the whoosh of blaster fire as they fell towards the floor, and the soft "thwup" of the bolt hitting something.
"I'm glad," Tony said. "You feeling okay? How's your head?"
Tony huffed. "Of course I do. Built them myself. One reason the NYPD dropped this investigation after barely looking into it was that I refused to give them the details. I'm not convinced they would've been much help anyway. Mind you, this did happen when said limo was parked elsewhere, not at the Tower. It still wouldn't have been easy to pull off. Almost impossible, unless the culprit had my security codes."
For a moment, they stayed like that: Steve leaning forwards, carding his fingers through Tony's hair, Tony on the floor between Steve's legs.
"Yeah. It really is unusual," he agreed. "So, did the mission come from those new higher-ups?"
"Facing enhanced resistance," Steve called out on the comms.
"Many experts think they might be much more common than that," Howard returned, as if he'd completely missed the point Steve was trying to make. Knowing him, he was doing it on purpose. "If we knew more about the phenomenon, it could be different. If we could understand why some people match, then maybe we could find all the matches that go undiscovered—it would change everything. That's why studies like this are important." He picked up the journal, shaking it at Steve.
He'd never liked Rumlow much, but he hadn't expected the rogue elements in SHIELD to act this openly. This hadn't been a mission. This had been an execution.
'Iceland announces plan for nationwide, publicly funded soulmate screening initiative,' the title said.
Steve kept his distance from Tony, staying where he'd been sitting previously, but turning to face him again. "I already know all about it because I was there, in that synthetic fake. We had a lot of fun with that. Like we always did. But then, afterwards, you wanted to talk."
He exited through the back door and walked around the block to his bike, feeling no less frustrated than before. His mind was buzzing, running over what he'd heard, trying to figure out what to do next. He started driving homewards, but when his eyes landed on the weather-beaten sign of a small hotel, just a few blocks from the bar, he pulled over to the side.
"Sounds good! So, what'll it be?" Tony asked.
"There's no point in pretending, Stane," Natasha said, the smile she was giving him as dangerous as any Stane had ever pointed at Steve. "We have more than enough ground for arrest, including the accounts of Tony's close friends and some very incriminating statements you've just made yourself."
The next scenario was even more brutal. There were torn nails and pulled teeth and broken bones, far too much pain for Steve to put on any bravado. Worse yet, when he passed out the first time, he didn't die, and came around still horribly maimed, and it went on like it would never end.
Almost every element he was using had already been tested in some other context: the pared-down version of Extremis, with far fewer side-effects than the original, was currently undergoing clinical trials, as was CRISPR/Cas, the gene editing tool that'd do the actual work. From what he'd gathered, at the worst, he might have to deal with a few days of flu-like symptoms—plus the consequences of modifying his INCS, which was the big unknown here. He'd purposefully designed the modifications so that the resulting sequences were unlikely to match anyone, assuming the current science that said INCS followed certain rules was solid. That shouldn't be a problem. People could live their entire lives without meeting their match, so that those sequences would remain dormant. As far as anyone could tell, lacking a soulmate wasn't fatal.
"It's okay. I'm here, now." Steve rubs Tony's back soothingly, and even though he's the one who was almost frozen, it's Tony who seems to melt, the constant tension finally leaving him as he relaxes in Steve's arms.
"Well," Tony said, making a face. "Kind of. There are a few rather sizeable gaps in the plan."
"Damn, this is going to be a long day," he muttered. There'd be so much waiting.
That didn't seem to impress Jarvis in the slightest. "Clearly, they didn't know he was there. He has a penchant for trouble and more lives than a cat."
"Wouldn't want to ruin the surprise," Rhodey returned. "Just read it, okay?"
"Yes. One of the best," Steve answers, without a moment's hesitation.
********************
"Pepper," he nodded at her. "He's in a frame already?"
Tony reaches out in Steve's direction. Even if it's a slightly uncoordinated movement, the intent, telling Steve to stay put, is clear. "No, no. You don't need to go," Tony drawls sleepily.
As soon as he noticed Steve's approach, Tony stood up to face him, taking a few steps towards him with a hesitant smile playing on his lips. Steve returned it with one of his own, even though the jumble of feelings going through him was almost too much to handle.
Even before his eye-opening stint in the cave, Tony sometimes speculated about whether JARVIS thinks of androids as a related species. Cousins, maybe, if not brothers. Still, whether he does or not, JARVIS doesn't
He'd thought they'd managed to pull off their mission without meeting the worst of all dinosaurs, but now it looked like they'd run out of luck on the return leg of their journey.
Tony had been lost in the multiverse. Even with all the combined scientific and magical knowledge of the Avengers and their friends, they had't been able to come up with a way of tracing him, but that had now changed. The thread that connected them would span across all that distance, linking them together, and surely, they could use that to locate Tony. That fine filament, spun from the strength of their love, could bring them back together again.
Tony made a little shrug. "Yeah. Kind of sentimental, I guess. I'm an old man. I'm allowed." For all that Steve kept saying that the frame didn't matter, that still sounded odd coming from someone looking so young.
"I do want to fight for the cause," Bucky said right away, steeling his shoulders.
"Fair enough," Steve said casually, as if that wasn't exactly the thing he most wanted to talk about.
Behind the desk sat a man with a bald, dark-skinned frame whose age was difficult to estimate. One of his eyes was dark and looked natural, the other was a striking pale amber and surrounded with scars. Fixing damage like that or getting a new eye to match shouldn't have been difficult with a police captain's salary, so that had to be a deliberate personal choice.
"Huh. Yeah, must've forgotten it," Steve said, attaching it around his wrist.
Tony lay down in turn, across Steve's thighs, his ass angled up, his head resting on crossed arms. "Okay. Give it to me."
It occurred to Steve that Peggy hadn't mentioned Howard Stark in her account. Which side would Tony's father be on in this conspiracy? Steve didn't know him, hadn't even met him aside from occasionally passing him by when he was visiting HQ. The picture Tony had painted of him wasn't flattering, but Tony didn't get along with him at all. It was difficult to guess what Howard was really like based on only those impressions.
Walking around the main room, he tried and failed to assess what gear they had that could be useful. He couldn't recognize most of the hardware, aside from some handguns and a folded-up suit that looked like it was made out of some kind of stealth fabric.
It struck him then that maybe Steve wasn't dead, after all; maybe those beasts had caught him instead, and he was now their slave. He knew Steve would fight until his last breath to be free again, but he was just one man. Bucky wasn't sure even Captain America could win against an entire island full of monsters.
There's a rustling sound from inside, and the tent flap opens to reveal a graying, bespectacled man, with lines in his face that speak of much time spent outdoors. "Hello to you," he greets, then frowns at Steve's outfit—the dark-dyed version of his uniform. "You are Captain America?" the man asks, speaking with an accent that Steve doesn't recognize, with heavy consonants and rolled Rs.
Tony’s flirty look made a comeback accompanied by a lopsided grin. “Not if Bruce was watching, I wouldn’t.”
Steve stormed out of the elevator and studied the landing around him. In every tower there were stairs as well as elevators, a remnant of earlier times and worse fire safety. He located the door easily and reached for the handle. It didn't budge; the door was locked.
"Try again," Steve said, and grabbed hold of his shirt front to press him against the wall. "You must know something. He was here last night, and he left with you."
"He's probably told Hydra that I'm dead, and doesn't want them to realize that I'm not, because that would make him look very bad. He messed up by letting me slip through his fingers," Tony added.
He didn't see a soul on his way, and soon reached the waterfront. There, he took cover behind some rusting barrels by the wall of a warehouse close to the pier, and settled to wait.
"Sure. Of course," Tony said, and stood up. "Sorry, Steve. Business calls. Keep my seat warm for me," he patted at the chair he'd just vacated, "and I'll see you later."
Steve lingered by the door. "I'll just leave you to rest, shall I?"
"I bet he doesn't, but it was really bad. No one was expecting there to be survivors," Steve said.
Steve heads back to the highest point of the hilltop at a brisk pace.
Sneaking towards Crabb Castle in the dark, Steve felt like Captain America again.
"You should probably start slow," he told Stark in English as he handed him the bowl of stew and a full jug of water. "Don't want to make yourself sick."
Aside from Stane, and another two drones on standby a few meters behind him, the large living room stretching out behind him was empty; no sign of Natasha anywhere. Stane probably didn't trust her enough to let her know Steve was here. Of course, officially, she didn't know Tony was here either, because she wasn't even supposed to know that Stane wasn't really Tony.
"If you'd like me to, yes. You might want to sit down first, though," Randall said.
He sat up on the divan to reach for the cup of coffee on the table, only to find out it had gone cold. He drank it anyway, wishing it were something stronger. Unfortunately, Bruce's lab didn't come with a bar. He should fix that. In case of emergencies. Which he always seemed to be having plenty of.
Steve sits back on the soggy ground, hands on his lap. He feels like he can't breathe; he's numb—as cold as Tony—not even sad, just unable to comprehend, let alone come to terms with what has happened.
It occurs to him that he left the parachute and the simple survival gear in its container with Tony. It's not much more than a pocket knife, a compass and some fire starting tools, and it's probably for the best that Tony has those. Steve, who was tied up only briefly while trying to rescue Tony, managed to escape with a knife he'd grabbed from one of the kidnappers. It's much better than nothing.
Tony opened the entry in plain text form and scrolled through an endless stream of A, T, C and G on the screen, marveling at the thought that these letters were the code that made Steve who he was. He ran a finger over a line, tracing it. What sequence would be the one that determined the particular pale shade Steve's skin? The blue of his eyes? The curve of his eyelashes? Where were the proteins whose expression levels the super soldier serum and the vita-rays had tweaked to turn him into Captain America?
"Some doors are better left unopened. Or should that be ships, unboarded?" Tony joked. It wasn't funny.
Maybe they still had an advantage, if they played this right.
The assault came around halfway through their crossing, without any warning. Tony was walking close to the front of the caravan, following the pair of ankylosaurs leading the way, when suddenly, there was a loud bang very close to them. Tony's instant reaction was to duck, hugging the muddy ground to take cover from the supposed fire.
Before he actually met Steve and Tony, Sam didn't really understand how people sometimes got invested in others' relationships, but now, after seeing his two greatest idols in love, he thinks he gets it. Still, Tony's reaction seems somewhat disproportionate. It's not the first time they've lost track of someone, and it's Steve. It's Captain America. Sam knows Steve can survive just about anything, with his tactical smarts and his super soldier physique. So, it baffles him that Tony is so badly affected by this. It's almost like there's some piece of information Sam's missing.
Kamski picks up his cup of whatever blend of tea he prefers these days, and shakes his head at Tony, his expression nothing short of patronizing. "You can't murder an android, you know. They're not alive to begin with. Unless you actually killed a human being to get the parts you used, you have no reason to feel like that."
Even though Steve had known, in theory, that crossing the Plains would take at least a week, he hadn't appreciated just how long it would feel when the landscape stayed so similar all the way through. He'd done a lot of hiking in the past few months, practically traversing the entire island, but none had been as monotonous as this. Steering clear of the shore meant that instead of a single glimpse of the ocean, all they saw day after day was an endless sea of grass.
"Shoot," Natasha said. "I promise I'll answer. It might even be true."
That wasn't the kind of torment Steve had expected. In hindsight, if Stane had realized how much Steve meant to Tony, maybe he should've.
It's not something he's even going to consider. He's not going to put Steve in harm's way. Not again.
"Not hearts, I hope," Steve joked. If someone had asked him, he couldn't have said if he was flirting in earnest, or just playing a part. Then again, he wasn't sure there was much of a difference between the two. Wasn't flirting always a kind of an act?
There was only one thing he knew for sure: everyone seemed to have an agenda that they wanted to further through him, whether it was Stane, Tony, or the resistance, and he was tired of being told what to do, even if it was for a good cause and came in the guise of a choice.
A slight, noiseless movement in the background caught Steve's eye: one of Hammer's drones straightened up, the launchers on its shoulders changing alignment.
"ETA ten minutes," Rhodey added. "Sorry it's taking so long, but we can't risk being spotted."
Pepper was still looking decidedly uneasy, but she bit her lip and nodded. "All right. Bend forwards."
"Not really." Steve by far preferred the fascination of Iron Man's bare hands over those terrible memories he'd been struggling with. He tried to keep them in the background, focusing instead on the weight of those fingers, letting it anchor him in the present.
"Does the word 'Maya' mean anything to you?" Steve tried, going out on a limb. Wouldn't hurt to ask her.
Steve lingered at the site of the fire until he was sure he'd learned absolutely everything there was to know about it. There were no additional revelations. The FDNY managed to get the fire under control, but as with the previous fires, the investigation concerning how it had started would take much longer, and he'd have to wait several days for even the preliminary report.
With that thought planted in his head, the next time Tony ventures outside the mansion for a charity gala, he does ask Steve to accompany him.
"Okay," Steve says, gives Tony's arm a squeeze, and leaves the room.
The door remained stubbornly shut when the first enemies showed up. There were just two of them, and Steve and Sam took them down fast, before they had the time to shout out any warnings.
Tony finished off the glass of whatever he'd been drinking before the beer, and then answered, "Oh, not really. Sometimes. Not my usual kind of place."
"Yeah. Woke up in some generic tropical beach scene. Not really my thing," Tony said, his voice sounding steadier, though somewhat distracted. "They asked me what I wanted, and this was the first thing that came to mind. I've missed space. A lot of people might find that weird, but I've always enjoyed traveling. You know, physically, in person. When I get out of here and we've got everything sorted out, I think I'd like to do a little tour. See how everything's changed."
He didn't want to think about the reasons for his lack of sleep. Bucky knew about his affair with Tony, of course, and he was hoping they could have a chat about it later, maybe help Steve figure out what he really wanted. Just not now.
He hoped he hadn't wasted too much time trying to decide what to do. It hadn't been that many hours since he'd left Stark in his cell, but whatever had struck him had seemed so sudden and severe that Bucky was nevertheless afraid he might be too late.
Tony took a step closer, his eyes narrowing. "I might, if I had the slightest idea what you're talking about. I don't know what she's told you," he cast a quick glance at Maya, "but it's all lies. I've already said it and I'll say it again: I don't have an artifact to give!"
Again, Steve was left with nothing to do but wait. Telling himself that this was the last stretch of waiting didn't help much, since he knew it would be the longest wait of all. The re-framing procedure had been streamlined and made much faster since Steve's day, but the entire process, from thawing out a new clone to transferring Stane's mind into it and then running pre-wakeup medical checks, could take up to an hour. Hopefully, Steve and the others wouldn't have to sit around doing nothing for quite that long. As soon as Tony confirmed that he and Jarvis had successfully inserted the virus that'd destroy Stane's backups, Team Three could finally advance with their part of the plan, infiltrating the clinic.
"Tony," he tried once more, shaking him by the shoulder.
"It's nothing. You should go, now." Tony rolls onto his side, his back towards Steve.
He'd been too slow. He didn't think he'd see Tony again tonight. He could only hope Tony wasn't in too much trouble.
He ends up dismantling the poor android almost entirely when he builds the suit of armor he uses to escape.
"I won't keep him long," Peggy promised.
He packs up his camp. Fiddling with the sticks and the parachute fabric that make up his shelter is an illustration of his predicament: the cold is already affecting his fine motor functions, and he keeps fumbling and dropping things.
"No, it wasn't," Pepper confessed. "But he jumped at it when I mentioned it to him, probably because he already suspected Tony might be behind the assassinations. He knows how much you mean to Tony. Having you in a frame that resembles your old self made you the perfect human shield."
Tony nodded. "Yes, there are, but any interesting artifacts in them were pillaged ages ago, since they're close to the North and a lot easier to reach than the caves. Besides, I've visited them before. I'm not going to ask the caravan to make the detour just to refresh my memory."
Tony swallows. Kamski has no idea how badly that hits a nerve. "No. I feel like a murderer," he says glumly.
"I'm trying to make sure we all get to keep our limbs, you bonehead," Stark snapped back when Rumlow let go of his face, and then switched to the dinosaur language again.
Tony's eyes had gone wide, his lips slightly parted, a look of confusion and disbelief, but maybe, just maybe, mixed with a touch of hope.
"You're not making any sense!" Bucky exclaimed, frustrated. Insisting that getting outside would help while actual medical attention wouldn't was so bizarre, it definitely sounded like a scheme. "How do you expect me to help you when you're refusing to explain what's wrong?"
He dozed off, the sound of Seren calling his name fading away.
Although his thoughts were decades away, Steve did actually make a quick tour of the apartment. It was a habit borne out of all his time with SHIELD: always know your surroundings so you're prepared for everything. He found a large bedroom, a wardrobe full of clothes in various styles, all of which would no doubt fit him perfectly, a kitchen with a fridge and cupboards stocked with food, a huge bathroom complete with a jacuzzi, a separate room with a VR getup, and finally, a private gym that was larger than the shared one on his floor had been, back in the day.
"Friday?" he called out. There was no answer. For a brief moment, he was alarmed, until he realized he'd shut her off himself. "Friday. Unmute. Cancel all my meetings for today."
As harrowing as the scene in front of him was, so far, this had been easier than Steve had feared.
He opened the latest of the email conversations. "Is this lady still working for me?"
Whether or not Tony managed to convince James that the Northerners were not the more humane side of this conflict, he would absolutely have to be able to talk James into taking him outside. He needed to be sure he was working with a full charge, or his escape attempt might end up being embarrassingly short, but he was stuck at an impasse. He wouldn't be allowed to leave the dungeons without showing his captors some functioning technology—and he wouldn't be able to do that without wasting even more of his remaining charge, not to mention taking the risk that the Northerners might figure out that the key to their power source problem was buried in his chest.
He didn't mind getting hurt himself. He'd been injured in the line of duty more often than he could count, and he knew the pain was temporary. The cuts and bruises he had on his skin now would be fading by tomorrow. He kept forgetting he even had them; none were bleeding anymore, but he'd left a few stains on the tiles, and every time he saw them, they took him by surprise.
"You really did like me, in the past, didn't you," Tony said; a statement, not a question. His hand trailed over Steve's hipbone and then up to his stomach. "I hadn't realized that."
"You know that soldiers can get into a lot of trouble for such things," Steve said, the gravity of his expression at odds with the all-encompassing joy that had taken hold of Tony.
Wherever his kidnappers were taking him, it would probably have been warmer. They might even have fed him. Of course, they might also have stuck needles under his fingernails. Can't know for sure.
"Until I come up with something better," Tony said, and headed for the elevator on slightly wobbly legs. The penthouse bar was mostly intact. It'd be poetic, sitting in the middle of the rubble with a bottle in hand, thinking about how that battle had ruined his life in more ways than one.
"No, but there's a good chance you didn't actually start that one," Steve reminded him.
Steve couldn't stay quiet any longer. "This one was my favorite out of them," he said.
Tony could've guessed this was coming. It's what Obie has been asking him about time and again.
Steve shrugged, knowing that there'd be a camera somewhere that would pick it up. "I have no idea what you're talking about. Are you going to take me home or not?"
"Good afternoon," he returned. "Do you have news about Stark?"
"I'd like nothing more." Tony let go of Steve to climb out of his chair.
Steve took in the room in front of him. It was the smaller of the Bartons' guest rooms; the larger one had been offered to Natasha and Bruce by unanimous decision. Thor had headed off on some mysterious quest of his own, so he had no need for a bedroom. This particular room that'd been designated to Steve and Tony only had one bed, and it seemed narrower than a standard double. Since Steve was kind of wider than standard himself, that would make it a snug fit.
Steve tried to get up, but his muscles wouldn't as much as twitch. Clearly, this frame was particularly vulnerable to stun weapons. That hadn't been in the specs. Steve supposed Rumlow had somehow known about it.
Tony settled on his back on the chaise longue, his hands behind his head, his hooded eyes on Steve. As relaxed as the pose was, Steve could feel the tension in the muscles beneath his fingers.
Someone, indeed. That someone is Tony, and again, for half a minute, Steve almost made him lose focus. Steve is too distracting. He should do the right thing and send Steve away, for so many reasons. But not now.
Steve doesn't care if he's recognized Tony, or what he'll make of finding the two of them like this. All he cares about is getting the help that Tony needs. "Did you manage to make the call?" he demands.
When he came across a more lively-looking street, he slowed down again. His expensive frame and clothes would make him stick out like a sore thumb wherever he went. That made it all the more ironic that he actually had no money available; accessing his bank account would mean giving out identity information that would be easy to trace.
Steve sat down in one of the grimy plastic chairs and looked from Fury to Natasha, who was still standing by the door. Both wore cool, neutral expressions that revealed nothing. "So, Tony didn't send you after me then?"
As was his habit, he checked his answering machine—the special device the military had supplied him with that was connected to his separate Captain America phone line—first thing when he got to his apartment. He was surprised to find he'd been left a message by Tony's friend Pepper Potts.
Tony needs to talk to Steve so badly, but even though he's been saved from certain death by the miraculous android intervention, he still can't move a muscle.
"He was able to get you pardoned for an early release. Your original sentence was for one hundred years," Miss Potts explained. "Since your birth body had been disposed of, he commissioned this new frame for you instead."
"Then all we need to do is wait and see," she finished his sentence for him. "I'm sure he will miraculously recover if you just ignore this for a few days. And as I said, if you've grown too fond of him, I can give this task to someone else."
"Oh, god," Tony breathes, suddenly feeling like he's just lost the reactor for a second time.
If he wanted to help Tony, he'd have to undo this, somehow.
"They rescued me from the sea. I wouldn't be alive without them," Bucky said. That was what he'd kept telling himself in his moments of doubt; surely they had to be good to have done all that for him.
Tony licked his dry, cracked lips. Even if his hunger wouldn't warrant uncooked meat of dubious origin, the thirst was getting bad enough that trying to lap moisture off the walls was starting to seem appealing.
"Would you mind answering a few questions?" Steve suggested. If he couldn't talk to Tony, interviewing the people close to him might help him get a better idea of what was going on.
Steve's eyes flutter open, focusing on Tony, and Tony instantly grabs him in a tight hug.
He was trying to decide between returning to camp before it got too dark, and sitting on this rock through the night just to be sure he didn't miss her, when he caught sight of movement in the waning light. His heart leaped.
"That's already very helpful. Thank you so much."
Steve already had a backstory in mind, one that wasn't even too far from the truth. He looked away sheepishly when he answered. "Well, it's only one part luck, and a few parts hard work. I really wanted to see you again. I may have gone to the Groggy Cod, and then visited a few other places tonight, hoping you'd be in one of them."
Tony steps away from Rhodey and raises his hands in surrender. "No! No, I swear I don't. I love androids. Honestly. My best friend is an AI! No offense, Rhodey. You're also my best friend. I'm allowed to have more than one." He shuts his mouth before he can make this any worse. He's already gone for the stupidest defenses invented by mankind.
"You're pretty great, yourself, for a human," Steve says with a wink, and offers Tony a hand to help him up from the couch. "Come on. We've got a bad guy to sort out."
Tony had seemed quite fond of Steve Rogers the other night, though.
Obie sighs and puts a hand on Tony's back. "Look, Tony, you've got to give me
"I'll keep an eye out for any glitches," Steve said, trying not to think about the kind of in-depth testing Tony had in mind for later.
and a pilot weren't a rider and a steed, but two companions working as equal partners. Sam and Redwing had been flying together since they were young, and by Sam's own words, understood each other better than anyone.
"I missed you," he says, aloud, testing it out.
He found himself getting up again, on wobbly feet, and walking towards his reflection, everything else momentarily forgotten.
"I'd always enjoyed the time we spent together. Of course I had. That's why I kept coming back to you. I didn't want to give that up, but I thought you were too shallow, too negligent about the things that really mattered," Steve went on. "When you started talking about us, about something more serious, it threw me for a loop."
There was no word of Tony the next day either, neither from his friends, nor on the news. Clearly they'd chosen to keep the situation under wraps; there wasn't one mention anywhere that the billionaire adventurer Tony Stark was missing, let alone presumed dead.
Lining one wall, looking very much out of place in the setting, stood a row of drones that were even bulkier than Tony's, a head taller than Steve and twice as wide. The plasma cannons on their shoulders looked purely functional, not like the streamlined repulsor arms of Tony's drones, and their heads were clearly robotic, with no facial features at all.
Steve had done plenty of covert operations during the war, often without the costume, with varying success. He'd never felt at home doing them. He didn't think he'd make a very good spy.
"Whatever's on tap, he says," the bartender shook his head and rolled his eyes. "Surely, a man of your distinction would like something finer."
The only person he'd known who was still alive and not a fugitive was Tony, and going by this conversation, he'd grown up to exemplify everything that Steve hadn't liked about him: he was self-centered, shallow and callous. As if there was nothing left but the worst parts.
"Yeah. The honest truth is, I don't know how it's going to play out. No one does. It was the best we could come up with in a hurry. We had to get you out of there as soon as we could, because we didn't know how long your frame would last," Steve said. It might've sounded ever so slightly defensive.
That clearly took Tony by surprise; he froze, at first, but when Steve didn't let go, he started to relax into it, putting his arms around Steve, his head against Steve's shoulder.
The expression on Stark's face shifted to what looked like a different kind of anguish. "Someone very dear to me," he replied, his voice sounding slightly better, hoarse as it still was.
Steve got up slowly and walked to the shore, feeling hollow. The sunset had turned to a proper spectacle, reds, oranges and yellows reflected from the water in a display that called to mind the fires. It only made the lump at his throat feel bigger.
Tony held his ground, his posture unchanged. "And what if I don't want to talk? Are you going to make me?"
"Is this supposed to make me feel better?" Tony asked.
"Hello, there! You're looking good," Tony greeted her in Saurian.
Steve didn't miss that Tony had danced around the matter of who he was actually looking for. He wasn't going to leave it at that. "So, this mysterious person you're after…"
"Listen to your friend over there," Barton said.
"Where is Stark now?" Steve demanded.
While he generally performs the menial tasks he's given without overt complaint, Steve bristles when Tony once happens to mention it feels weird to have a combat android serving him his morning coffee.
Steve couldn't quite bring himself to believe what he was hearing. "You're not there anymore, though. Why not swap frames?"
"Do it! Right now!" Steve insisted. "On three! One, two, three—"
"Hey there! It's okay," Steve called out, offering the man his arm.
"Ed," Steve said, starting to grow frustrated. "He didn't give a last name. He told me he was a mechanic. That's honestly all I learned about him. Please, he said he was in some kind of trouble—can you tell me if he's all right?"
"Tony could've died. He asked me to take him outside earlier and I refused," Bucky insisted.
Steve had never dared to even dream of finding his soulmate, certain that if he'd been destined to have one, he'd left them behind when he'd fallen into the ice. He'd never thought he'd see what he was now looking at: a red string so fine that it seemed ethereal, but somehow simultaneously more solid than anything else in the room, one end of it tied around his pinky, the other disappearing into thin air.
"I'm so relieved to hear that." Steve runs his hand up and down Tony's arm, and Tony's not sure if it's meant to reassure him or Steve. "I tried to look up the device Stane used to stun you, but I didn't find anything online, so I didn't know what to expect."
He knew this impression of clumsiness was temporary. In this frame, his reflexes and coordination should be better than in the one he'd been born with. This was exactly why they scheduled the swaps to give Agents enough time for familiarizing themselves with new frames. He'd only been in this one for a few hours, which gave him the rest of the evening and the night before tomorrow's mission for getting used to it.
He picked up the phone again, and after a brief moment of hesitation, typed,
The light is orange instead of a healthy blue, which tells him that the android's biocomponents are damaged, but since it hasn't shut down, Tony might still be able to repair it. He'd have to improvise the hell out of it, though, because he doesn't exactly have access to CyberLife spare parts here. It'd also take a lot of time, which he doesn't have.
He'd sleep better on a softer surface, even if it's out in the open. He considers looking for an alternative location. In some strange way, it'd feel like giving up.
They were barely even friends.
Steve had twisted his leg badly when they'd been running away from the falling rocks. The painkillers he'd taken had driven away the worst of the pain, but he was left with a constant dull ache in his knee. Tony had taken a look and concluded that it was probably a bad sprain, though he had no way to entirely exclude fractured bones. Whichever the case, the result was the same: Steve's leg wouldn't hold his weight. Not that they had anywhere to go, even if it did.
"And I told you it's fine," Steve reassured him. "I'm a mess, too. I've just been taught to hide it better."
The incident that had originally sent Steve on Tony's trail was the biggest gap left in Tony's knowledge of what had happened. Maya had told him the events at the Fountain, and various mobsters had described their encounters with him before every other fire, but none of them had admitted to having ever been to Jan's townhouse.
"So, you've already started making arrangements for our rescue mission, right? When do we set out?" Steve asked him impatiently.
"Natalie was there. She's the one who found me with my brains blown out all over the landscape. Cameras show her getting there and instantly calling for help, but still, it doesn't exactly make her less suspicious, does it?" Tony pulled a face. "I don't know what her motive would be, unless she's in league with him, which she could be. Justin has a bucketload of motives. He hates my guts as much as I hate his. He thinks he's competing with me, and sure, his company's a notable player on Earth, in some segments. On a system-wide scale, though, they're nothing. He's more of an inconvenience to me than a threat. Unless he's the one trying to kill me."
"They're classified SHIELD files, Steve," Tony said, apologetic, spreading his arms. "I'm just a consultant. I don't have full access."
Tony wanted to tell Bucky that Seren had only been trying to help, that she'd only wanted to wake him, but he didn't have the breath. After a panicked moment that seemed to stretch on, he did finally manage to draw in enough air to cling to consciousness, and to force out a half-choked "it's fine" to his two at-odds companions.
As he spoke, he was trying to come up with a strategy to get out of the situation in case things turned violent. He'd need to get the big thug behind him to move away from the door so he could rush out before he got knocked out or shot. Four against one. With him unarmed, these weren't great odds, but also not the worst he'd ever faced. He really should've brought a gun, though.
"I'm telling you to look, now," Tony urges him.
Somehow, it seemed to Steve like he was walking away from more than just one conversation, or a shared bed in a guest room.
"I'm glad," Tony said, and gave him a quick kiss on the lips. "Now that you've mentioned lunch, I'm actually starving. Let me see if I can do something about that."
Steve pushed back the blankets covering Tony, trying to understand what was going on. There was a short stretch of IV tubing taped to Tony's arm. He had no idea what it was for, but it couldn't be anything good. A chill ran down Steve's spine.
There were other things he needed to take care of today: he should check in with Bucky, and let Pepper Potts know he'd found Tony, even if he couldn't share any of the details. None of that would take him all day, though.
Maybe that was the truth. It still wasn't the story Steve had wanted to hear. "Okay. So, it wasn't in the Andes or the Amazon. Where did it really happen?" Even if he wouldn't get the true story, he liked listening to Tony telling these tales.
"I thought my clothes felt itchy against my skin, but I seriously didn't realize it'd be like this. Whoa." Tony ran his own fingers down his front, letting out a sigh, his eyelids fluttering.
Pepper had already been on the list of suspects because she was one of the few people with the access privileges to plant a bomb on Tony's limo. If Steve told Tony of this added reason to suspect her, he would suspend her instantly. But Pepper felt like the closest thing to an ally that Steve had; she was the only person who'd known Tony for a long time, including back when he'd been different. Going by her cryptic comments, she seemed to understand what was going on with him far better than Steve did. He didn't want to lose that. In fact, Steve had to admit that he currently liked her more than Tony. He decided that unless he found something more incriminating than a single passing touch, he wouldn't mention this to Tony.
"It's urgent," Bucky said.
"I'm just saying, I was scared shitless," Steve said, making Tony snort, and yeah, he usually didn't swear, but in this case, it happened to be an accurate description. "You wouldn't believe how scary it was, but it was okay, in the end. It felt weird, definitely. You can't really describe how weird it is, and at first it always took me a few days to start feeling at home in a new frame before I got more used to it, but eventually I always did. And so will you. I'll be around to help. It's going to be okay."
“See? It’s fine. Just like I said,” Tony noted.
A second too late, Steve realized what he should've already guessed: the reptilian's feet were similar to their hands, bare and ending in long talons. They caught on the fabric of his pants, rending a long tear in it, nicking his calf.
"That's putting it mildly," Steve confessed.
Steve didn't need to be told twice. He sat up, undid Tony's belt and pulled down his pants and briefs. His socks and shoes were only a minor obstacle on the way. Soon, Tony was entirely naked. Lying there in the light of the hearth, he looked perfect; like some antique god of fire, his skin aglow and his cock standing proud.
"Ready," Bucky said, and the dinosaur gave a low murmur that must've been agreement.
The truth was, in spite of all his misgivings, Steve wanted so many things, he couldn't decide what he wanted the most. He took a steadying breath. "I want you to suck my cock, find out how that feels. I want to suck yours and see if that's as hot as the rest of you," he began. When he saw the look on Tony's face, hungry and eager and not at all embarrassed, it was a lot easier to keep going. "I want to fuck you against the wall. I want you to ride me on that bed. I want all of it."
Bucky sat down stiffly, nervous to hear what this was about.
If Pepper and Steve's first encounter was amicable, his and Rhodey's is the exact opposite. Tony finds them glaring at one another in a Mexican standoff without guns, with deeply suspicious glares and hands clenched in fists.
"That's a terrible name," Steve complained.
Suddenly, idle thoughts about relationships were the last thing in Steve's mind, and he felt embarrassed that he'd dedicated so much of his attention to them, when there were far more important things happening around him. He settled in the chair in front of Peggy's desk, his head held high, his back ramrod straight.
"I'm being too forward, aren't I?" Tony said, his expression closing up. He leaned backwards ever so slightly, giving Steve more space. "Sorry about that. Don't mind me. It's just that there aren't a whole lot of people here who're up for friendly conversation," he nodded backwards over his shoulder, indicating the rest of the room.
"You've already done so much for me, you—" Tony protested.
Whatever was wrong with Stark, it seemed serious. The brief walk through the corridors had left him leaning on Bucky and panting like he'd run a marathon. A small, mistrustful voice at the back of Bucky's mind kept reminding him that this could all be a ploy. Maybe Stark had planned something with the big beast in the Vault, and was feigning illness to make Bucky more sympathetic. Then again, Bucky couldn't imagine how Stark could possibly be faking the ghostly pale shade of his complexion.
Tony realized he'd just broadcast all that affection at Steve, all the feelings he'd always been so determined to push to the background. As confessions went, really, he might just as well have said the words.
, although it was so skinny, its feathers so mangled and its skin so gray with exhaustion or illness, that Tony couldn't be entirely sure of that.
Bucky couldn't stop thinking about the Mayor's words earlier. He wondered how, exactly, he was supposed to keep Rumlow in check, when Rumlow saw him as little more than an ignorant kid. Besides, it wasn't impossible that Rumlow was right to take such a cautious attitude towards Stark. Bucky really was new to everything that was going on in this island, and learning more every day.
But there was no later.
"Fine," Tony replies, out of habit. It's not really true; now that he's fully awake, he realizes that he's so exhausted, he wouldn't mind going straight back to sleep, and his every muscle aches. He's not sure he could get up if he wanted to; his limbs are so heavy, it's as if someone upped the gravity a few G's. "Where am I? What happened?"
"Sentimental reasons, mostly. I got over that," Tony said, as if brushing aside something embarrassing.
Steve was Captain America. He wasn't supposed to die like this, fall into the ocean and drown alone in some unknown part of the world. He was supposed to survive things no normal man would. He couldn't be gone. He just couldn't. But the days passed, and no one showed up to tell Bucky that his friend had crawled up on the shore.
Tony waved a forefinger at Rhodey. "See, that attitude is why they've kept at this for decades, no matter how flimsy the evidence. The nutjobs who believe in this wouldn't be able to get funding if not for all the undecided folks. Since there are enough people who're on the fence, they can always get a grant from here or there, and so they keep going. It's like perpetual motion." He waved his hand around in a circle. "If you could harness human gullibility as a power source, you'd have unlimited free energy."
Steve sighed, frustrated. As much as he liked this island, right now, he would've given anything for a proper network of roads and his bike. "Well, then. I guess there's nothing to it but to start trekking towards the mountains as soon as possible. If there are no galleys, then I'll need to find a way to cross the Basin on foot, like Tony was going to, and try not to get caught, too."
"Good night, Tony," Steve said.
He could hurry over, rush to Tony's room, and grab him as if he were apprehending a fugitive. He just didn't really want to do that. He had reasons to suspect Tony was the arsonist he was looking for, but he was mainly basing that on the stories of a couple of thugs. He lacked solid evidence. Without that, he'd prefer not to make this official. He wanted to be sure he had his facts straight.
Tony, for example, for all his adventurous tendencies, had never been in any body but his own. Not that he would've had any particular reason to swap, either; he was an engineer, not an Agent. Besides, unlike Steve, he'd been born gorgeous.
In the early morning light, the scene around them was like a reproduction of that warehouse fire where Steve had first met Tony: an expanse of burned rubble with a few sections of walls left standing, with broken timber and bent metal everywhere. The smell of smoke lingered in the air, overpowering the scent of the sea. Steve kept expecting that just like last time, he'd hear a sound from the middle of the wreckage, see some movement, and witness Tony rising from the ashes again. Instead, there was only silence and stillness.
From his perch across from the platform, Clint wouldn't be able to tell for sure if he'd destroyed Stane's node in addition to killing him. That meant more waiting. Steve wished he had more than the scattered comments to go on. A few minutes later, he got his wish.
He's about to go back in when he hears something that makes him stop in his tracks: amidst the wind, a voice calls out his name.
Steve's LED burns a solid, angry red; Tony's never seen it do that before. His hands are clenched in fists, his jaw working. The look on his face reflects how Tony feels, with unmistakable rage in his eyes, even though that makes no sense. Steve's not supposed to get angry. He's not supposed to have feelings at all. It's goddamn scary seeing him like this, enough so that for a moment, it makes Tony forget about his own outrage. Thoughts of robot uprisings and rebellions flash through his mind. Maybe there are good reasons why Steve was stored away. Maybe he's dangerous in ways Tony didn't consider.
The thought of Steve watching him sleep definitely doesn't make Tony any less annoyed. He hates the idea that he's been so vulnerable, entirely at the mercy of the person he'd least like to face in the entire world—and it's all the worse because not too long ago, he would've been ecstatic for Steve to be looking after him like this.
"I wouldn't do something like that." Steve did briefly consider whether he should hurry to the nearest village when he'd first reached the hut, but really, there's no way he could've just left, not without being sure that Tony also had a way home.
"Just like he deserves," Steve said.
The hangover and the regret and horror over what he'd done and what he'd found out last night coalesced into overwhelming nausea that went far beyond mere physical discomfort. He turned his head for some less stale air, keeping his eyes firmly shut. He considered making a break for the bathroom—he didn't trust the bile to stay at his throat—but the idea of moving made him feel even worse. He tried taking deep breaths through his nose instead.
"He was there, in the cave where they kept me when I got kidnapped. I guess that's where he ended up when he broke his programming and went on the run. I was dying, and I knew I could use his parts to save myself." The words stick at Tony's throat, his voice threatening to break. "I chose my life over his."
There are a few potential explanations Tony has come up with. It could be that this was a very early prototype that never got a model designation, although he'd expect even those to get one, or it might be a custom job, built only once, but again, that also seems unlikely. The third alternative is that it was a confidential military project. Considering the details of the android, he thinks that's the most likely option. It's also one that Kamski is unlikely to admit right away.
"All the more reason to explore it further. If that's something you might be interested in," Steve suggests, and whoever designed his eyes to enable this particular flirty look through those long lashes deserves a prize.
Steve glanced at the door leading to the bar and listened for a moment, but all he could hear was muffled music. No sign of anyone showing up to disturb them. He guessed brawls like this weren't uncommon at this fine establishment, and the owners were used to turning a blind eye.
"We are. We'll have to think it through carefully, though," Rhodey said. He motioned at his partly armored body with one hand. "If we walk into a trap like this, it's not going to help anyone."
She motioned at the chair facing her. "Please, take a seat."
"You too, Happy?" Tony cast a surprised glance at him. "Don't tell me you'll vote we should go to the police, Jarvis?"
"We're always careful, you know that," Morita said.
"Are you giving the orders, now?" Steve returned, but did as Tony had asked, pulling aside the bedspread to lay down on his back on top of the covers.
"Okay. Thank you, this has all been very useful," Steve said, offering her a smile. "I've got one more question, if you don't mind."
Still, Steve didn't talk. He knew this wasn't real. He repeated it to himself like a mantra. His frame was intact. It would be under extreme stress, but he knew it could take that. Everything would be better in the real world.
Placing someone in VR when they didn't have a body was always an emergency measure, typically in association with a criminal investigation—like what Steve had been through after his most recent frame death—or a medical crisis. People considered it off-putting in the same way as being placed in a cheap synthetic fake, except that it was even worse. To be human was to have a body. If you were conscious without one, it was almost as if you were nothing but an elaborate AI. It was different from a regular VR experience, too; as Steve himself had found out, incorporeally gained memories felt less concrete and more distant than regular ones. There was probably some technical explanation for that.
"No, you don't understand," Steve says. "He gave me to you. I'm yours."
Steve got up to check the doors, and found that the one that didn't lead to a restroom was locked. He could've easily forced it open, but decided against that; he couldn't do it without drawing attention to himself, and for all he knew, it could've just as easily been a broom closet.
Steve stared at the inanimate figure in the stasis box. Next to its slender features, narrow face and bony shoulders, the hand Steve was resting on top of the transparent cover looked massive. Not at all like the sleeper's hands, which were long-fingered and elegant.
"Well, I can tell you that the team she was working with was odd," Pepper said. "It was her and another academic, a Dr. Killian, and a whole lot of assistants who resembled common thugs more than university researchers."
"Well, you're probably better off for it," Rhodey comments. "Android soldiers tend to get the worst possible jobs."
"But you did listen. That's the important part," Steve said. The disappointment Bucky had been waiting for was still not there, as somber as his expression was.
The bag, which he'd punched off its chain, hit the floor with a loud thud, but he barely heard it.
Even through the haze of want, Steve could tell Tony was more hesitant than he would've been in the past—the way he took Steve in his mouth was slow and tentative, and maybe he might've swallowed more of Steve's length before than he did now. Not that Steve cared. Tony's hand squeezed firmly around the base of his cock, covering the rest of it, and he started sucking Steve off in earnest, finally, finally giving Steve that tightness and friction and heat that he'd been craving.
Perhaps he did, without meaning to.
"I'd love to meet him. I'll be right there," Natalie answered.
Steve had gained something of a reputation himself, or rather, his alter ego had: the Captain was every illegal frame peddler's or bio-weapon trader's worst nightmare. His real name wasn't known outside a small group of colleagues at SHIELD, and since he tended to do each mission in a different frame, none of his enemies knew what his true face looked like.
"Anyway, we were making good progress, heading deep into unexplored jungle. It was hard going; often it felt like we weren't as much hiking as digging a green tunnel. Rhodey was having the time of his life, though, with all the plant and animal life we encountered. A lot of the species were entirely unknown to science."
"Yes. It means that we can get his mind mapped onto an intact node and transferred to a new, healthy frame."
If he truly had been working for the wrong side all along, he had to make the right choice now while he still could. He was afraid he'd been so overly honest with the Mayor that she'd grown wary of him. Tomorrow, she might decide to take away his keys to the cells. With them, he'd lose any hope of helping Stark, and of learning the whole truth about Dinotopia and the resistance.
Steve was the first one to get up, on guard for any signs of hostile activity. There was nothing. He looked around, taking in the destruction around them. The room was littered with broken glass from the windows, and he spotted one waiter unmoving on the ground. He was hopeful that it might be only a frame death, with no node damage.
It's got to be one of Kamski's, Tony thinks. No one else makes them as unnecessarily perfect as he does. He's weird even on Tony's scale, but he does have talent, not to mention an impeccable sense of aesthetics. And if it's one of his, Tony knows the basics of the build well, thanks to some time he spent with the man before CyberLife made it to the Fortune 500. Which means that this android could be the beginning of a solution to his very urgent heart-and-shrapnel situation.
"Okay, that sounds like a plan," Steve said, wrapping an arm around Tony's back.
"Yeah. I guess most of us are," Tony said, resigned. He turned onto his side to face Steve, trailing his fingers along Steve's arm.
There was a good chance that they wouldn't be able to handle this fight on their own. He hoped the second team was faring better. "Rumlow! We could use a hand. What's your status?" he inquired.
Tony brushed his fingers over Steve's buzz-cut sandy brown hair. "I can't believe this one's not organic, even though I've seen the specs with my own eyes. It feels very real. Is it the same from your perspective, or can you tell the difference?" His hand found its way to Steve's chin, which was covered in light stubble, and he stood up on tiptoes for a quick kiss.
The disgust that those words raised was enough to push away any lingering nostalgia. Steve stepped away from Tony, shrugging away his hands, glaring at him. "Yeah? And what if I didn't want to be like this?"
Steve recognized that he was so insistent on at least telling the truth about the Fountain because he had agreed not to tell the police about Tony.
"You sure, boss?" The AI's voice was softer than usual. She was smart enough to turn down the volume when it was obvious he'd been on a bender. "You've got one with Rhodey, you want to cancel that too?"
"What's up, Cap?" Tony greeted him.
Steve rubbed at his temples. The intense focus on trying to figure out this puzzle wasn't helping with the headache; instead, it was growing worse again, a constant gnawing pressure behind his eyes.
He had spent his whole life telling off people who assumed he was weak. In certain ways, he was, he couldn't deny that. He would never win any races of strength or endurance. All too often, running left him breathless, and lifting things too heavy for him sometimes gave him strains, not to mention that he lost every single fight he ended up in. Still, that wasn't going to stop him.
When he opened his eyes again, more capable of focusing on what was around him, he realized that the restraints around his wrists and ankles had changed. He was still tied to bed, but instead of metal cuffs there was soft rope, the kind he might expect to see in the bedroom.
Tony waved a hand at the trio, but walked straight past them. "No murders before coffee," he announced. "There's something resembling breakfast, too, if you want it, Steve."
His hand still held up in front of his face, staring at it with such amazement and disbelief and joy that he forgot how to breathe, he felt the strange tingling tug at his pinky again.
"Likewise," Tony said, looking Steve in the eye. "I mean, I'm not going to lie, I did enjoy all those gorgeous frames, but that was only a part of it."
Tony hooked both legs around Steve's and gasped. "Oh, yeah. Oh, Steve. So good."
"Yeah, that was pretty stupid, now that you mention it." Out of habit, Tony tried to hold a casual, cool front, even though he knew Steve would see right through it.
Steve squeezed him tighter with both arms around him, his chin on top of Tony's head. "Oh, no. No. I swear this is real. I'm here. I'm really here, and I won't let go."
"Has he, by any chance, been in more trouble than usual recently?" Steve tried.
"I suppose you've also got an opinion on this, Jarvis?" Tony spoke up once the others were gone, glancing towards the ceiling.
"I am Tapio," the man introduces himself, and clambers out of his tent to offer Steve his hand. He's as tall as Steve and dressed in garb well-suited for the weather: rubber boots and an oilskin coat. "Honor to meet you. Big surprise, too."
As he starts reeling in his kite, he gets a bird's-eye view of his immediate surroundings. Steve is standing on top of a nearby hill. He's facing Tony, clearly still trying to keep track of him. Tony scoffs.
"I think he ran away, in that direction," the bald man waved a hand roughly towards the north. "I'm not sure, I wasn't very close."
"Whether you realized it or not, you were," Fury insisted. "I don't know what plans Hydra had for you after your sentence was up, but I'm sure Stark getting you out was a far better alternative."
"Nothing, really," Tony said.
To see if his money was worth anything, he stopped by a food stall, where he successfully bought a burger that had no flavor except for chili, and a texture closer to bubble gum than quality mycoprotein. It was nostalgic: this was the kind of thing that he'd grown up on. Thinking of that, he realized that although this street was busier than most he'd passed so far, he could only see adults. There wasn't a single child or teenager in sight. Not that he'd seen that many on the higher levels either, but he hadn't spent much time in places where he would expect them. The streets were a different matter. Maybe parents thought the streets were too dangerous these days, and the NYPD or SHIELD had locked away all the street kids.
Only at night, when he lay alone in bed, his thoughts ended up returning to those old paths, making him wonder if there might still be a chance of fixing things. If he could, one day, stand next to Tony and feel companionship and warmth instead of the anxiety that had always been radiating from him.
"Hm, right, of course you wouldn't know," Dr. Harris said, rubbing at his cheek. "See, we lost a colleague recently. Al Killian. Maya was on the same expedition, and I think she feels responsible. Really, if you ask me, the whole thing sounds like something out of a pulp. Went to explore ancient ruins, died in collapsed temple. It's hard to believe that he's gone."
"I'm against killing people in general, but in this case, I'm going to make an exception," Steve said grimly.
After four days of this almost-pleasant trekking, they descended to the Northern Plains, where they met another small group of Northerners guarding a larger group of steeds. Unsurprisingly, these weren't dinosaurs, but some type of early horse ancestors. From there on, the trip became far less fun: Tony's captors locked him in a carriage, where he sat as they rode across the plains. Again, it wasn't as bad as it could've been. They still let him out a few times every day so that he could stretch his legs and answer nature's call, and they still gave him food and water, but spending day and night in a windowless cabin wasn't exactly his idea of a good time—and he suspected it was only a prelude to what he had to look forward to later.
Steve pulled back his hand and turned to face Tony. "A little, yeah," he admitted.
"Well, think of it this way: if there's one person who's got the skills and the means to confirm what’s in SHIELD's actual, secure files, it's going to be Tony Stark," Fury said.
Tony moaned, his cock very hard where it pressed against Steve's thigh. "Ahh, okay, wow, yeah, that's good. Careful there, or this is over really fast!"
"Is it, really? I see you've got no scruples about accepting the services of this one. Does it make a difference that it was a freebie? There must've been some kind of a price tag attached, anyway, right?" Obie's scrutinizing eyes feel as piercing as Steve's.
None of the firemen Steve saw seemed familiar to him—the previous fire in Brooklyn had clearly fallen under the responsibility of a different station—but he had met the police duo before, when he'd been briefed regarding the fire at Jan's house. They were currently standing by their car, talking to one of the firemen. Steve got as far as waving a hand at them in greeting when a commotion at the door of the burning building had everyone turn around.
who was among the smartest people he had met. She had suggested that since the sunstone implant worked so well and he'd been in such good health after he'd installed it, it was possible that his heart was in better shape than it had been in decades. Considering that he was still conscious, that was probably true, but he knew he would never be entirely healthy. He might have hours, maybe a day or two, if he was lucky, but certainly no more than that.
Things were still exactly the same as they'd been. He and the other ex-Avengers were wanted criminals. Bucky was still in suspended animation. Tony had lashed out and tried to kill him. Steve knew he hadn't been thinking straight when he'd done that, and he knew he could partly blame himself and his decision to hide the truth from Tony, but that didn't make it okay.
"I'm not looking for any trouble," Steve said placatingly, and stood up. "I'll just be on my way."
He packs up all the gear, slings the pack on his back and starts to walk.
He'd been so caught up in the thought that he couldn't possibly say yes to his captors' demands, desperately trying to think of ways to escape this windowless cell separated from freedom by who knew how many locked doors and guards, that he hadn't stopped to consider the most obvious way out: the one he was best at.
So far, the people who had rescued Bucky had been nothing but kind to him, and he had no reason to doubt the word of Lina Crabb, who was universally admired among the Resistance. The dinosaurs seemed exactly like the terrifying monsters they'd been described as, and if there were indeed humans suffering under their rule, it was Bucky's duty to help them. If that meant kidnapping Tony Stark, that was what he would do.
He didn't know what Tony's excuses had been.
Last night, Tony had been roused from his usual light slumber by Steve's restless movements, and to his confusion, when he'd whispered to ask what was wrong, Steve had mumbled something about wanting to sketch Tony, his voice broken by some distress and despair that Tony couldn't understand. Taking a leap of faith, Tony had invited Steve to hug him instead, and Steve had accepted that offer. He had allowed Tony to wrap his arms around his thin body, trembling as if with cold even though the night was warm, and Tony had held him close like he had wanted on so many other nights.
Bruce frowned at him for a beat, but then his eyebrows shot up and he shook his head. “Oh, no, no, you didn’t, Steve. You didn’t do that. I stopped you,” he said, an oddly apologetic look on his face. “I made the decision to have you sedated. You never got past second base.”
Tony sighed, crossed his arms, looked at the ground, and then at Steve again. "You'll really just leave me be, if I do? You won't bring in the police and the Invaders and the National Guard and try to put me behind bars for the rest of my life?"
Steve made one more call after those two: he contacted Dr. Harris to check whether Maya had been around at the university since Steve's visit. She hadn't. No surprises there. If Steve wanted to see her, showing up for Tony's meeting was his best bet.
The way Tony said that, without any hesitation, like he was stating a fact, made Steve feel a little foolish, but he couldn't shake his discomfort. "Not wrong. It's just—it's not decent. It's not something Captain America would do."
Steve leaned backwards, looking him in the eye. "I heard some people in the common room talking about the crossing, and they mentioned that it might be dangerous because of the Northerners."
It was as Steve had already guessed, then.
He'd never thought he might some day consider "mind control" the lesser evil out of any set of options, but in this case, it really would've been. The problem was, he knew he was grasping at straws. He'd felt what he'd felt. It had been real. He was still all too aware of Steve standing next to him, and he couldn't shake that off.
With his own enemies out of the way, Steve could get a better look at the rest of the scene. The sight of it made him stop dead in his tracks.
Kamski's office is at the top floor of the Tower. Of course it is. To Tony's surprise, Kamski's dressed formally: dark gray slacks and a matching vest, with a burgundy dress shirt underneath. The kind of getup Tony might pick, and not really the style Tony's used to seeing him with. Unlike Tony, he's been known to show up on the national news in jeans and a hoodie, like some sysadmin that got dragged out of the basement. His hair is carefully combed into his usual ponytail, his beard trimmed to a style not too different from Tony's.
