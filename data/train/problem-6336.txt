It had now been one month since Steve left on that early morning. One month since Steve had thrown his ring at Tony’s feet and called it quits. One month since Tony felt anything happier than numb. Every now and then, a thought would creep in of happier times with the Captain and their life together, or it would switch to more dismal thoughts of ‘where did it all go wrong’, or worse, back to the morning that he would much rather erase from his memory entirely. Of course, doing so would result in forgetting that Steve and he were together for an extra day, that Steve even existed that day. If Tony had it his way, however, he would rather do just that; forget entirely that anything had ever happened or wish that none of it had happened at all. Whatever the case, Tony always tried to force these thoughts as far back into the recesses of his mind when they would oh-so-wonderfully decide to pop up.
Peter gave another sob but nodded. Steve went to the kitchen and pulled out the tin of brightly decorated Christmas cookies they had made earlier and gave them to Peter so he could pick out the best ones. Meanwhile, Steve cleaned the spilled milk and broken sweets while carefully sweeping up the shattered glass.
Steve’s eyes were closed as he pleasured Tony and he began to swivel his head along with his tongue as he continued to move up and down. The sensation had Tony seeing stars and he tightened his hold on his husband’s hair, making more jolts of pleasure rocket through him as Steve moaned around his cock.
CEO now after all, he just ran behind the scenes sometimes. She clearly thought differently and now, as he deposited his suitcase unceremoniously on the floor, he was just glad that the little weekend business trip was over.
Tony turned to his husband, face mask still up, “I’m going to fly ahead, but the directions on your GPS will get you there no problem.”
Steve figured that his son would fall asleep not long after calming down, so, believing it to be safe, he nodded and motioned to the couch. Steve settled first, stretching out with his back against the armrest and Peter quickly clambered up on top of him and snuggled close, resting his head on Steve’s chest.
“Hey, he looked out of it and I never actually said he was asleep. He’s obviously learning bad habits from you.”
Tony acted almost as though he hadn’t heard Steve and turned back to face the city. “No, why would you be concerned? You’re Captain fucking America. You’re just doing your job, because god forbid Captain America doesn’t come in to save the day, god forbid he doesn’t rush to follow S.H.I.E.L.D’s orders like the good puppy he is.” He nearly spat those last malice-laced words.
The other man stiffened, and for a while neither one spoke. Tony lowered is armoured arm and spoke, “I see. Come to see the almighty Tony Stark hit rock bottom?” He laughed humorlessly at his own morbid joke, his tone defensive, attacking, irritated, and perhaps a bit sad. He glanced only barely over his shoulder at Steve and continued in a more emotionless tone, “Then again, you wouldn’t do that. I actually wonder why you’re here at all…”
“I can’t take it anymore Tony!" Rogers' hands were balled into fists at his sides and he was shaking. "I’m tired of long nights alone, waiting up for you to come home drunk out of your mind. Tired of going to stop you before you get your ass hauled to jail.” By this point the tears were slowly trailing down Steve's face, “I’m tired of wondering if there’s some gorgeous girl sitting at the bar that you’re just dying to take home. And now, when you actually do…” Steve turned and rested his elbow above his head and against the wall, his left hand placed on his hip. He ran his right through his blonde hair and faced Tony.
Tony watched them drive away before launching himself into the air and in the direction of the hospital.
Tony stared into those blue eyes, expecting to see maybe some form of resentment or hesitation but there was none, only love. Tony sighed and closed his eyes, leaning into the hand.
All of a sudden, the kitchen turned into a warzone.  A messy, mushy, warzone. The two men were using spoons and their hands to fire projectiles of food and Tony even resorted to trying to fling the mush from directly from the jar itself. Peter just laughed hysterically in the way that babies do and clapped his hands as he was splattered as well.
“It’s also been a while since anyone’s heard anything from Steve either. Phil’s in contact with him somewhat, but he’s been avoiding S.H.I.E.L.D otherwise.”
Beneath his usual professional exterior, Steve could hear the concern in Coulson’s voice. He didn’t want to be worried, didn’t want to care, wanted to say that Tony was no longer his priority or his problem, but he couldn’t.
Meanwhile, Steve had rushed for Peter almost as soon as Tony had, but he had been a little more tied up at first.  Plain-clothed and having had just enough time to grab his shield, he found himself surrounded by the enemy, and no matter how much he beat them back, more kept coming. As soon as he had heard his son’s cries for help, his heart ripped and anger and desperation coursed through him. He heard something like Tony’s repulsors going off and hoped his husband was on his way to Peter. With his shield, Steve barrelled his way through the mob, striking here and there when needed. Breaking free, he caught a glimpse of a man taking off with his son, and at the last minute threw his shield and struck the man square in the back.
Tony could not resist any longer as he cupped Steve’s chin and pulled him to face him, kissing him hard. Steve moaned in happy surprise and bit down on Tony’s lower lip, eliciting a moan from the genius. Steve’s hand found it’s way to Tony’s hip and he yanked roughly on it, pressing their hardening erections together. Tony did not object in the slightest and ground against Steve, feeling all-to-restricted by his clothing. He did not object either when Steve effortlessly picked him up without breaking the kiss and Tony obliged the other man by wrapping his legs around his waist so as not to lose contact.
When he reached the exact spot Peter had called from, Tony’s fears were confirmed as he was standing on the edge of the rock pile. Without hesitation, he began tossing aside chunks of concrete like they were nothing, nearly hitting one or two citizens who made the mistake of standing too close to Iron Man.
Steve began going faster, one hand reaching up to cup and massage Tony’s balls. Tony let out a small gasp at the added stimulation and could feel himself coming closer to the edge.
Tony looked relieved, but only slightly. It was only then, when he saw the pain written on his lover’s face, pain too strong to be physical, that he remembered.
Steve shuddered at Tony’s words, breath quickening as Tony’s grip tightened and his pace increased. He buried his head in Tony’s shoulder.
“He can just fly off though, and I’m pretty sure that the suit can take whatever the Hulk throws at him. He’s in no immediate danger, right Coulson?” His stomach dropped and he came to a halt when the agent didn’t reply right away.
“You need to eat something Pete. It’s good for you,” he encouraged as he offered the spoon once again to his son. Peter pressed his lips together tightly and twisted his head away, finally deciding to try and use his hands to push the ‘food’ away.
Tony just shook his head, the sobs breaking through, and rested his forehead against Cap’s while wrapping an arm possessively, yet gently, around Steve’s chest as if afraid that he too might disappear at any moment. Steve brought his hand up to cup Tony’s cheek. The two men stayed there, spilling out their pain and holding desperately onto the other; their world had just shattered around them and vanished, they couldn’t lose each other too.
Originally, Steve and Tony had agreed that they would leave the kid’s room relatively bare. And they’d stuck to that. The walls were painted a pale turquoise (a color the two had agreed was gender neutral). Other than a white plush chair, a nightstand with a white, rabbit shaped lamp, pale turquoise and white chevron curtains hanging over the long glass windows, and soft gray carpet, it was mostly bare. Steve took a moment to look the room over. Nothing had changed, but maybe it should. Steve reached into the closet and pulled out a few gallons of paint; white, pink and blue, and a couple of small paint brushes. Sinking to the floor, he pictured a few unicorns playing together along the baseboard and got to work.
“Yes, that’s who we spoke about on the phone.” Steve said, blue eyes looking absently across the room as he answered the question and settled himself into one of the few adult-sized chairs in the room.
“Mr. Stark, are you okay?” Peter asked, now leaning in front of his mentor, big doe eyes blinking at him and filled with concern. “You’re panting and getting all red again. Is it space? Is it the water? Just breathe with me.” The younger male instructed. This was not the first time Peter had seen Tony go into a panic attack and it surely wouldn’t be the last. He had gotten quite skilled at talking his mentor down when he got way too over his head with thoughts.
“Can you say it again? Say, up Ellie.” Tony commanded. The toddler blinked her big gray eyes at him in confusion. “C’mon kid. Up. Maybe she’ll say it if you do it again.” Tony wondered, shooting Steve a look. Steve complied, tossing her up a few feet and listening to her delighted giggles as she landed in his arms again. The pair waited as her laughter quieted again, and silence fell over them. Ellie stared at Steve, still grinning like she’d won the lottery, as the two men stared at her. She looked between them, looking slightly confused. “Alright, I give up. I’m starving. Let’s get lunch.” Tony says impatiently, eyes looking over to the clock sitting on the dresser, before heading out of the room. Steve adjusts her on his hip and pauses.
“You didn’t even do anything yet.” Tony joked, leaning against the wall. Steve shot him an annoyed look and pulled the skirt portion of her dress up and tugged down the little pink shorts she was wearing underneath.
Thank you all for the continued support! It's crazy to me that we now have 3 2 0 0 hits! I can't even imagine that many people liking this fic, it's CRAZY! As usual, if you're interested, you can find me on tumblr,
“Oh no, I hear crying.” Steve remarked, carrying two plates in his hand, stacked with slices of pizza. He set the plates down on the kitchen table and swiped a piece of cheese to take over to the counter.
Steve shook his head and leaned down so he was face to face with the toddler. “Okay, I got this. Ellie, deces Papa.” Ellie’s bright gray eyes settled on him for a moment and she broke out into a grin.
“Yeah, that doesn’t sound too bad. I wanted to wait for her to meet some of the team...but I guess this is as good as a time as any.” Tony pointed out, still looking at her sympathetically. The rest of the ride was oddly quiet, other than the occasional grumbles and whimpers from Ellie as she tried to soothe her aching mouth. Steve rubbed her stomach gently, and to his surprise, Ellie reached out a chubby little hand and grabbed Tony’s finger as he scrolled through his phone, checking his email most likely. The brunette man looked at her in confusion for a moment, before smiling softly and holding her tiny hand in his. It was odd; almost like her hand belonged there, and it seemed to put her at ease a bit, since she closed her eyes and huffed, slipping her other hand from her mouth and placing it lazily on her lap. Steve resisted the urge to coo over them both since he knew the second he did, Tony would most likely retract into his tough persona.
Alright, you guys can roast me for being a shit bag and posting this chapter MONDO late. BUT to apologize, again, I want to do something special this week. Since I'm on Spring Break and I have no life and did not go home, I'm going to put up a straw poll every day on Tumblr. You guys will have the chance to decide if I post a chapter of the story OR a one-shot set in the future (even though I said I would not post one-shots, because they could potentially spoil upcoming parts of the story) and it'll be posted at night. That means either a chapter or a one-shot every day! Woo! As a result, there isn't a tidbit for this chapter (you can kill me now lol). Anyway, as usual, thanks for the support! Here is my Tumblr. Tomorrow's straw poll will be up around 11 AM, Eastern Time.
Steve went to pick Ellie up around 8, returning with the over-exuberant toddler who was contently clutching the brown rabbit and burst into the community floor, screeching in excitement. She wasn’t quite sure what she was excited for, but she was excited. Ellie passed by Peter in a blur, heading straight for the other end of the room, only to turn around and speed back to Steve's side.
The time for her to return to the adoption center came a lot quicker than either dad wanted. Ellie had settled in comfortably between Steve and Tony on the couch, big gray eyes drawn to the TV screen as it played Moana. Ellie sucked on ice chips to soothe the pain in her gums, happily humming along to the various songs in the movie. By the time it was coming to an end, it was nearly 5:15.
Peter was laying on the blanket, working diligently on some math homework. He looked up when he heard her speak. “Ellie’s awake?” he’d asked, sitting up and peeking over to see. Natasha hummed and shifted the slowly awakening child in her grasp. The doe-eyed teen smiled a bit and whispered as he scooted closer to Natasha’s chair “Hi Ellie, I hope you slept well.” Surely enough, she looked over Natasha’s shoulder when he spoke and shot him a sleepy smile. “Gosh, Ellie is so cute. Mr. Stark is going to be such a great dad for ya.” He sang, petting her soft curls. Her gray eyes watched him for a moment.
“Alright, let’s go through the whole plan again.” Tony mentioned half a piece of toast in his hand. Steve reached for the remote and turned the tv off, sitting up to face his partner.
“I think that’s an adorable idea, old man. Let’s...let’s go through with it Steve.” Tony felt Steve flinch. Silence fell over the couple as they embraced on the nursery floor, listening to the birds chirp outside.
Sorry for the like 3 month long hiatus. Real life shit hit me a lot harder than I expected to and I kind of died for a little bit. Anyway, here is the end chapter. I’m not going to create a schedule for uploading because I know better than to play myself. My work schedule is all over the place and I don’t want to get anyone’s hopes up and not be able to fulfill my promise. As usual, if you head over to my tumblr
Steve stopped by a café to pick up some breakfast. He couldn’t help but glance at the kids menu and eye all of the child friendly options, imagining ordering fruit salad or a donut for a hungry and happy kid, bouncing excitedly as they waited.
Wow. I cannot believe 1,000+ people have read this story. I am super stoked to keep it up. I apologize for the late upload, I have been extremely sick all week and I did not have the energy to do much of anything, other than sleep. Today I finally had enough energy to put this together, since I have been wanting to introduce Marcellina for a good minute.
The next morning, on his run, he looked a bit longer at the playground than he used to. He imagined pushing a little girl or boy on the swings and chasing them around the play equipment.
Steve sat quietly on the bench in the park after a solo run. His deep blue eyes settled on the New York horizon as the sun rose slowly, bathing the city in bright orange rays. He let out a small sigh as he watched a woman run by, pushing a stroller. His eyes lingered a bit longer than he expected and he sighed again. Sam plunked himself onto the bench next to him, huffing heavily as he caught his breath.
“I second that.” Steve agreed, pulling the blanket up over the three of them. “Goodnight Ellie. Goodnight Tony.”
“Okay. Please be very gentle. The salt in the water may burn her eyes, so try to keep her face dry.” Peter held her like she was made of glass and after a few minutes of wandering around, leaned backward and floated, with Ellie sitting on his chest.
“I’m going to go ahead and change into something comfortable. I should be ready in just a couple minutes and then we should head out. It’s a 30-minute ride and I don’t want us to be late.” The shorter man disappeared into the hallway and returned soon after, wearing jeans, black tennis shoes, and a simple blue t-shirt. “Alright, let’s head out.” Steve nearly shot to his feet to meet Tony, slipping his shoes on at the door and looking over himself one more time. Tony was close behind, sliding a pair of ombre, orange-tinted shades onto his face.
Marcellina lit a cigarette and took a long drag, blowing the smoke away from the two men seated in next to her. With a small noise to clear her throat, she began.
“Okay, no park. What should we do instead?” Tony asked, opening the door for Steve who gently put Ellie into a bright pink and black car seat Happy had put into place while the two went in to get her. He clicked the six-point harness together and gave her a pat on the head. She leaned into his hand, with a quiet whimper. Steve frowned; she was abnormally warm.
“I don’t know how I will ever be able to thank you for this one. This is...it’s amazing.” Steve said quietly, still partially in awe. Sam shrugged again and pushed the file on Bucky directly into Steve’s view.
“MEESHA MEESHA!” The tall woman smiled back and leaned down to scoop her up. She held her tightly in her arms, hands snaking into the child’s curls as she held her close. Steve looked concerned as he set the clipboard back down.
“Oh, sweetie that’s so nice of you. It’s okay, you can have the car.” Steve said quickly, suddenly flustered. In a flash, Ellie stood on wobbly legs and quickly waddled over to another pile of toys and returned with a blue plastic car, and handed it to Tony this time. The two of them shared a look.
“Tony?” Steve whispered, patting him gently on the knee when they stopped at a light. The brown-haired man sat up a bit and looked over, cocking a brow. “I know we talked about an older child..” Steve half mumbled, hand gripping the steering wheel a bit tighter.
“Yeah? I can see you as a dad. What’s stopping you from adopting a kid with Tony?” Sam asked, sending a fiery red blush blazing up Steve’s cheeks all the way to the tips of his ears. Steve sat up and cleared his throat.
“Sorry Ellie, that's dangerous. There could be knives in there. Let’s go back to the living room. I bet your dad is back with toys much more fun than the kitchen drawers.” He chirped, easily scooping her up and carrying her to the living room, where Steve was in fact, setting up the various toys on the other side of the couch. “Woah, look at all the stuff he brought for ya!” Peter bubbled, setting her on her feet. Ellie went straight for Steve, playfully trying to climb him, as Peter sat on the couch again.
“We’ve been with her alone for an hour Tony.” Steve chided, tsking as he rolled on his side and looked down at Ellie lovingly. “Just look at her. She’s perfect.” Tony did the same, leaning on his head on his arm and taking it all in. Never in his wildest dreams did he think he and Steve would be laying in the same bed with a toddler sleeping between them. Then again, he never thought that he and Steve would be in a relationship. In a very, un-Tony-like action, he reached over and gently placed his hand on Steve’s face.
“So...what do parents do while their kids sleep?” Steve asks, heading into the kitchen to clean up. Tony smirks to himself. “I can think of a few things we can get up to…"
“Don’t have bad table manners like your Papa, kid.” Tony teased, heading out of the kitchen briskly. Steve watched her shovel piece after piece of pizza into her mouth quickly, decorating her face and t-shirt with bright red tomato sauce until her plate was empty. “Wow, look, you finished all your food!” Steve complimented, making her grin for a moment before she promptly swiped the plate off onto the floor and watched as it clattered against the dark wood and rolled underneath the table, sending her into peals of loud laughter. Steve gasped. “Ellie, don’t throw your plate.” Tony re-entered the kitchen a second later, eyebrow cocked at the pair.
“There isn’t much we can do. Maybe we should just head back to the tower for a quiet afternoon and give her lots of cuddles and some ice for her gums.” Steve said sitting down and frowning at Tony. Tony frowned back and climbed into the other side, telling Happy to head back to the tower. Both men looked over Ellie, who chewed restlessly on her hand, cheeks tinged pink. Steve smiled sadly at her and ran his fingers through her short, brown locks. Tony also looked her over, mouth crooked to the side and eyebrows drawn together. “We’ll make a whole thing of it. We can get some ice cream, and watch some movies and get some quality time in.”
Tony and Steve get a surprise awakening, that leads to Tony opening up about what it means for him to be a dad.
“Thanks. Well...I hope to hear from you soon. Thank you for taking care of my sister and caring for her so much. It means more than you could ever imagine.” She headed toward the gate to the yard instead of the back door. Steve quickly shot up and rushed to her side. Tony watched as the blond hugged her tightly, said something to her that made her laugh and headed back to him.
Tony kicked off his shoes and sighed deeply. He ran a hand over his face as he headed into the kitchen, grabbing a water bottle and going straight for his bedroom. It had to be past 4 AM. Birds were chirping away outside, but the sun hadn’t begun to rise. Tony sauntered down the hall, to the master bedroom, smelling heavily of oil. Splotches of antifreeze decorated his hands and as well as his face, but he paused when he heard gentle music playing lowly from the nursery.
“Try not to jump to conclusions next time. That goes for all three of you.” She chastised. “C’mon lets get something cold for those poor gums, bednyaga..” Ellie’s cries shifted down into long whines and loud pants as she continued holding her cheek. Natasha dug through the freezer and found her target, strawberry lemonade popsicles. “Here little lady, let's eat this.” She removed the plastic and sat on a chair, offering the frozen treat to the toddler who immediately took it and shakily shoved it in her mouth, sighing as she rested it on her aching gums.
“Okay, Ellie. It’s about time we get you back.” Steve explained softly as he picked the girl up and settled her on his hip. She frowned at him. The men eyed each other. “It’s okay. We’ll come back next week and we’ll do something fun this time. Maybe the beach! Do you like the ocean? There are fish and seashells…” Steve rambled, carrying her over to the elevators. He pressed the button to head back down to the garage as Tony sent Happy a quick text and slipped into the elevator with him.
“A baby? Like a physical baby? I don’t know if you had sex ed back in your day, but we don’t exactly have the parts required for that job.” Tony said, leaning back against the pillows behind him, with a small smirk tugging at his lips. Steve rolled his eyes and deadpanned him.
“Well, this may blow your mind a bit more. I have a confirmed sighting near Albania. As in, pictures and a possible residential location.” Sam explained, opening the other file and pushing it over to . Surely enough, there were pictures of a man who looked almost identical to Bucky, kind of slinking around a city. Steve looked at the photos slowly, analyzing every detail and reading over the reports. “So? What do you want to do?” Sam questioned. Steve took a deep breath and let it out slowly, thinking over his options.
The weekend rolled around in the blink of an eye. Steve had agreed to let Peter go, as long as he consented to being extremely gentle around Ellie since the boy was prone to tripping and falling, breaking things in the lab, and trying to show off to Tony. Natasha and Sam decided to join them, along with Pepper and Happy, bringing the beach group to 8.
“How about the ball. Do you want to play with the ball, Ellie?” Steve asked softly, picking up the blue ball in his hands, his tone light and sweet. Tony scoffed playfully and reached for the car.
Suddenly the bench shifted and there was a warm hand resting on her shoulder. She tilted her head back down and came face to face with Steve’s warm blue eyes staring back into hers. She’s looked to quick. The tears began to fall without her consent. “I want you to know that there is nothing wrong with following your dreams. Or sticking to your plans. No matter what we do there will always be things that get in the way of what we want. This was just a hurtle, both for you and Ellie. Both Tony and I want to give Ellie a good life. We want to raise her around friends and family.”
“I…” Steve looked at Tony and smiled a bit harder, handing her the toy. “We got you this. As proof that we plan to do all the work, it takes to not only be good dads but to be the best dads. So, we’re going to file to officially be your foster parents. It’s going to take some time, but before long, you’ll be able to come home with us for good.” He says, leaning on the frame of the car door. Ellie holds the stuffed rabbit close to her, armed wrapped around its neck tightly as she beams down at him like he’s hung the moon.
Thank you for reading this chapter. Since it's a bit short, I may post another chapter either today or tomorrow. I appreciate any type of comments and can't wait to write more since it seems like you guys are really liking the story. I've also been asked to write a follow-up, with an upcoming character where civil war and Ultron have both happened and having it take place during/post infinity war. What do you guys think? I'll bring this up again once the character is introduced!
“Woah, hold on Tony.” Steve said, his tone suddenly serious. Tony spun on his heels and turned to face them again, leaning against the door frame. Steve lifted her under the arms and held her above his head. He sniffed her little tush and recoiled. Tony cringed as well and quickly put his finger to his nose.
Slowly, he wandered into the toy section, and he was transfixed by all of the cute little stuffed animals. He could easily imagine a kid running around excitedly with a stuffed bear or fox tucked under their arm.
“Well, I’ll be damned. Natasha is going to be pissed.” He chuckled, standing up as Steve began folding up her towel and tucking the wet clothes inside of it. “She’s on a roll, huh Cap?”
“Papa!” Sam whooped loudly and high fived Clint. Steve clapped Tony on the back as he pulled her into a hug.
That night, Steve sat down on the edge of the bed as Tony exited the shower. His partner dried his short brown hair haphazardly with a towel, a stark phone in his hand and a confused look in his deep brown eyes. Steve sat quietly, stock still as he turned the soft rabbit over and over in his hands, fingering a white satin ribbon that was tied around its neck.
“Okay, if you’re going to sit up here with me, you have to sit nicely.” The spy was quick to tuck to the girl in a towel (since Ellie was very wet and Natasha was very, not) and sit her against the crook of her arm. “Here, will reading to you calm you down a bit?” Natasha read from the pages of her mystery novel quietly, feeling Ellie occasionally snuggle into her. She was out cold in less than five minutes.
“See, she even eats well. Went straight for the fruit. What a straight arrow kid.” Tony mentioned, crossing his arms over his chest in triumph. Steve ignored him, reaching for his own sandwich as Bruce, Clint, and Natasha started their conversation back up. Tony continued gushing over Ellie as she ate, though she was very much ignoring him and focusing purely on the food in front of her. Tony eventually reached over and grabbed a sandwich of his own, still beaming with pride at Ellie.
The ride was silent. Ellie was visibly sulking, a pout settling on her chubby features. Steve and Tony both sat awkwardly on either side of her, Tony messed around with his phone to distract himself from the nearly visible tension in the backseat. As they pulled into a parking space, Steve reached for the small bag of items the agency had sent with her and Tony undid the car seat straps. Ellie’s gray eyes stayed locked on him, almost accusingly (or maybe he was just worked up?). He set her on the hood and both he and Steve stood in front of her for a moment, making the toddler slightly confused. Steve spoke up first.
The main floor was oddly populated today. Natasha, Bruce, and Clint were all sitting at the large table in the kitchen, discussing something and eating grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup. Tony carried Ellie into the area and pulled a chair from the table, turned it backward, and plopped himself down with a smirk on his face. Ellie’s big gray eyes scanned over the others at the table curiously. All three heads snapped up at looked at the new arrivals.
“Okay, okay. Papa is going to take you to the water. Just hold on okay? Daddy is not a big fan of large bodies of water.” He soothed as Ellie squirmed and wiggled, trying to get free of his hold, occasionally holding a hand out to Natasha, who would lean over and pet her hair. Steve slathered her down in children’s sunscreen, changed her into a swim diaper and a swimsuit patterned in flamingos and palm trees and alternated between trying to console her, and wondering if she was just tired.
“Tony Stark.” Tony shook her hand next, surprised when she didn’t gush over him as she shook his hand. Instead, she untied her apron, turned off the stove, and gestured down the hall.
“It’s okay Ellie. I’m not going to leave you.” Steve whispered. Tony reached over from the other side of the bed and placed a pink pacifier decorated in pastel flowers between her lips. She calmed almost instantly, and the two men exhaled loudly before locking eyes. Both of them chuckled as they watched the pacifier bobbing in and out of her mouth and her face relax. Steve nudged him playfully.
The car ride was a quiet one. In all honesty, Tony was falling asleep. He’d spent most of the night in the lab, mostly because he needed to keep his mind off of the kid to keep from having an anxiety attack. He was doing a damn good job too since Steve hadn’t picked up on the couple of time Tony’s hand shook while they rode. He closed his eyes and recounted everything he’d done last night to keep his mind busy. Tony spent upwards of 7 hours rewriting code for a new repulsor for another suit, and another 3 hours just working on paperwork Pepper had delivered two weeks ago. Steve noticed his eyes slipping shut every now and again and smiled softly. He pulled Tony into him, causing the engineer to sign and lean his head into his shoulder.
“Now isn’t the best time for me to go off to the wilderness for an extended period of time...And this was over a month ago, he could have moved again.” Steve said, frowning deeply. Sam nodded in understanding.
“Well, thank you, Ellie. That’s was...very nice of you.” Tony said, reaching out to pat her head. The rest of the play session continued, the three eventually ending up tossing the ball around, playing more peek a boo, and ending with a lot of tickling and laughter. As Ellie lay between the two catching her breath, she rubbed her eyes with a closed fist and suddenly yawned. Her once bright gray eyes were drooping, and quickly.
“Look, what he’s trying to say is, we both are sure we want to be your dads. And to prove this wasn’t some, one day trip thing,” Tony paused, allowing Steve to pull the brown stuffed rabbit from a bag and offer it to her. Instantly, a smile spreads out across her face.
“Mr. Stark?” Peter stammered quietly. Tony hummed, leaning back against his chair, but not turning to face the young teen. “Can I ask you a question?”
“What can I say? Those parenting books were good for something after all.” He bragged, making Steve roll his eyes. Tony gestured to the bed, and the two men kicked off their shoes and laid down next to their charge. “So this is the life, huh? Being a dad isn’t so hard.”
“I couldn't sleep again. So, I thought I would at least be productive. I’m very sure, even if Ellie isn’t for us…” Tony gave him a look of skepticism, considering they’d both just about made up their minds that she was. “Even if she isn’t, I think I really want a girl. And it’s almost like us having a baby is like finding a unicorn, ya know? It’s magical almost. I thought it would be nice if we did a magic theme. Unicorns, mermaids, and rainbows. That kind of stuff.” Steve whispered, tightening his grip on Tony and giving him a kiss on the forehead. The inventor hummed in agreement.
“Wait, but who is who?” Clint questioned, looking expectantly at Tony and Steve. The coupled eyed each other.
“Well, I’ve always wanted to be an older brother. I think I’d be pretty good at it.” Peter boasted, chest puffed out and standing tall.
“God no. I’ll carry her in, you just get her bag. We’ll go to our floor and she can meet everyone when she wakes up.” he muttered back quietly. Steve gingerly undid her car seat strap, holding his breath when she stirred for a split second, slowly settling back to sleep after a couple seconds. He breathed a sigh of relief. Tony opened his door, holding both bags in his hand and looking concerned. His boyfriend climbed out, and reached in, gently picking Ellie up and leaning her head on his shoulder. Again, she adjusted herself, stuck a thumb in her mouth, and easily settled. The pair carried her in, after Steve thanked Happy softly, and took the elevator up to their shared floor.
“Aw, El, don’t cry.” Steve comforted, wiping her tears with his thumb and setting the small plate in front of her with a cut-up slice of cheese pizza. She immediately quieted down, reaching for the fork and picking at the squares awkwardly and leaning forward to put them into her mouth.
“It’s so good to see you ‘Nora.” she said, barely above a whisper as she rubbed her hand up and down the squealing toddler’s back.
“Awww, are you all tuckered out?” Steve cooed, reaching forward to gently rub her tummy.  Ellie replied with a yawn, shifting comfortably into his hand and stretching. “Oh, someone’s sleepy.”
“C’mon Ellie. Your dad wants us.” he offered his hand to hers. For a moment, she eyed him, gray eyes looking at his hand curiously before she got a mischievous glint in her eye and took off from him. “Hey, don’t run away, run in the other direction!” he scolded, running after her as she burst into squeals and laughter at the potential for a game of chase. Turning her head to look over her shoulder and beam at him, her foot caught a bit of driftwood and sent her flying face first into the damp sand. Peter was at her side in a matter of seconds, lifting her up so her feet were on the ground again and tsking as he brushed the sand from her face. Her big gray eyes quickly snapped open in confusion. “See, this is why you don’t run when you’re not supposed to.” Peter chided, taking her hand and leading her back to the towel. Tony leaned down and held his arms open for her.
“What’s gotten into you today?” Steve asked, only to be met with more whining. “Okay, okay.” He mumbled, pulling on pink glitter sneakers and pressing down the velcro. “There ya go.” He set her on her face and she quickly toddled back over to him, beaming widely and holding her arms to be picked up, which he obliged as he packed his towel into his backpack. Steve sat there for a moment, just flabbergasted by her.
“Oh. I apologize. I lost my head for a second there.” Marcellina lamented, smile wiping away to a stern and emotionless expression. She stepped forward, Ellie still wriggling in her grasp from excitement, while awkwardly snuggling her. “Marcellina Gordon. I’m Elenora’s older sister.” Then it clicked for Tony. He smiled politely. Of course, he’d done his research. He knew all about Marcellina and her spotless past. Not even a dress code violation in all her years of schooling or detention. If you looked up straight arrow, Marcellina Gordon’s picture would be printed right among the words. Steve eyed the expression on Tony’s face and knew that he must’ve done his background research into her, otherwise he’d be putting on his cautious, all business smirk.
“What really happened to your parents?” Tony prods. Steve huffs out a disapproving breath, mumbles his name with a hiss because it’s inappropriate, and nudges him hard in the ribs. Marcellina waves him off.
“I see Ellie has captivated you.” A sudden light voice caught their attention. Ms. Honey held the hand of a short-haired boy, George, and a girl with little buns on either side of her head, Susan. Steve smiled sheepishly and nodded. Quickly, she shooed them off to play for a moment and walked over to the cribs and easily scooped Ellie up in her arms.“This is Eleanor, but we call her Ellie. Can you say hi Ellie?” The girl grinned and gave them a quick hand flap as a wave as Ms. Honey bounced her on her hip. Ms. Honey sat down, setting Ellie on her knee, and the baby attempted to stand up in her lap, grinning widely and babbling. “Ellie’s parents passed away a few months ago. Luckily, she has an older sister, who took care of her until she graduated from college and joined the Marines. She didn’t really have anyone to care for Ellie...and she ended up here. She’s very well behaved and always loves to be the center of attention. If you catch her on a good day, she’ll sing and dance to just about anything you put on, and most days are her good days. She can be energetic, but she loves to sleep, and she’ll sleep all day if you let her.” Ellie had focused herself on one of the buttons on Ms. Honey’s t-shirt, playing with it between her chubby little fingers. “If you’d like, you’ve got about…” she pauses and looks at the duck shaped clock on the wall “30 minutes until they have to go down for their nap.” The pair looked at each other. Tony saw the pleading look in Steve’s eyes and melted without even exchanging a word. “If she isn’t what you’re looking for, there’s always Francis, Susan, or George.”
“Good to know our minds are in the same place.” Tony said simply. Steve furrowed his eyebrows and then raised them sharply.
“Oh, uh hi Ellie.” Peter mumbled. She squirmed out of his arms and was back to running around the living room before he could even blink. Steve watched, shaking his head to himself. “Well, that was affectionate for a baby.”
“Seems I haven’t been the only one busy. What made you wanna paint?” Tony asked. Steve pulled the smaller man into his body with a sigh.
“So how’s it been, being parents and all?” Clint asked, watching Bruce and Ellie for a moment before turning to Tony. Tony smirked pridefully.
“Ellie, I want you to know that we did really have a lot of fun today. And I want you to know that both Tony and I…” he nervously shot a look over to his boyfriend who immediately reached over and grabbed his hand to soothe his nerves.
To apologize for this short ass chapter, I have decided to go ahead and post a one-shot. It will be a two-part one-shot taking place after the snap in the timeline where civil war happens and Ellie stays with Tony.  There will also be a tidbit on tumblr for this chapter! See you over
“We’ve been talking about this for awhile now, almost 5 months. I’m a lot more comfortable, and meeting a kid doesn’t mean coming home with one. We’d have a lot more work to do, things to put into place, and changes to decide on between us, as well as the team, before we’d officially adopt a child. And even then, it’s a process with paperwork and all that, plus timed visitation, overnight stays and a period of fostering before we can apply to be legal guardians. It’s a bit of a complicated procedure, but my reputation precedes me, so I doubt it’ll be too hard to pull off.” He huffed and twisted his ankle a few times under the table, something he often did while thinking. “And besides, it’s Steve and I. No matter what, things always work out just the way they’re meant to. Pretty sure that super soldier serum gave him some damn good luck too.” Tony mumbled the last bit and downed the remnants of his coffee. Pepper shook her head a bit at his joke and then thought for a moment.
“Olivia, I’m going to have a couple meeting some kids in here. Think you could give the older one's lunch? Broccoli is on the counter, Mac and Cheese is cooling on the stove, and there are PB and J’s in the fridge.” she instructed, as the younger woman nodded and headed out. “Sorry about that. Now you wanted to see Susan, George, and Francis, right?” Ms. Honey asked, gesturing to the only adult-sized table in the room.
“Should I…?” he asked quietly, almost like an intimidated child, as he leaned toward Natasha. She easily handed her to him, instructing him to sit her on the table so she was sitting straight up. Steve did as he was told and sat Ellie on the table as she continued to happily suckle at her popsicle. “Okay, kiddo. You just have to take your pain medicine so your mouth will feel better again.” he whispered, slipping the tip of the syringe between her popsicle stained lips. Ellie scrunched up her face in confusion but allowed Steve to press the plunger down. Surprisingly, she barely flinched and swallowed the medication along with a bit of popsicle. “You’re such a good girl. I’m sorry we startled you.” He said, patting her head affectionately. “We’ll get better. We’re just a little nervous is all.” Ellie blinked at him and removed the half melted remnants of her frozen treat to offer some to him with a sweet smile. Steve couldn’t resist smiling back.
“Look Ellie, there are some cars, and some blocks and a little scootch on toy, since you’re in a very...mobile mood.” The blond pulled her from his back and placed her on the plush patterned carpet. Ellie’s eyes scanned her options, but she went straight for the lion. “How did I know...” Steve mumbled to himself as he watched Ellie climb on and pull her little sock covered feet along the floor, only to not move anywhere. She frowned deeply, making Steve laugh. “It’s your socks love bug, they aren’t giving you any traction.” He removed them for her and she happily scooched herself across the hardwood as quickly as she could.  Steve disappeared for a moment, and returned with Tony in tow, who went straight for Ellie.
“You know I love you right?” Tony said, his deep hazel eyes staring directly into Steve’s, making the blonde blush heavily. “I love you Steve Rogers.” Tony voiced.
“Natasha, Banner, Bird Brain, I’d like you to meet Ellie.” He addressed cockily, setting her feet on his legs so she could stand. Ellie blinked at them, head cocked a bit to the side.  “Well are you going to say hi or what kid?” he questioned. She grinned and sent an excited wave their way. Natasha smiled, aweing over her and reaching out to hold her.
“Well then, you two had some children you’d like to meet with? If you don’t mind, we’ll have to do our meeting in the nursery. I’m going to send my aid from that room to serve lunch to the older children.” she said, as she lead them into a pastel room with a tv playing a bright colored cartoon of some sort. There were six babies of various ages sprawled out across the carpet with various toys. A woman was wiping down a highchair in the corner and smiled in greeting.
“Good morning! Ellie is a little grumpy today. She didn’t get much sleep because her molars are coming in and it’s been agony for her.” The dark-haired child was in fact, rubbing her eyes tiredly with an annoyed look on her face. Steve cocked a brow. He’d never seen her look like that before. He and Tony locked eyes as Olivia shifted a small pink polka dot bag. “Here are some things you might need. She’s got some medication for her gums, a couple frozen teethers, and her favorite blanket. We just gave her some of the pain medication, but it may take a bit for it to take effect.” She listed, handing the bag off to Steve, who took it with a small smile and a thank you. “If you need anything at all, please don’t hesitate to give us a call. We’ll see you guys at 6!” Steve stood up and gently took Ellie into his arms, running a hand down her back slowly and adjusting the little rainbow dress she was wearing.
“Welcome back! Is that a new bunny Ellie?” the front desk woman asked politely. “I bet your guest will be happy to see you’re feeling better!” she said, picking up the phone. Tony and Steve looked at each other in slight confusion. She placed the phone back down and offered the same sign in slip on the clipboard back to Steve.
“Ya know, kids movies aren’t so bad.” Tony yawned, standing up to stretch. Steve snorted and nudged him playfully as he stood up. Ellie looked between them, a big piece of ice protruding from her lips.
“There’s leftover toast and bacon on the kitchen table.” Steve grumbled as Tony went straight for the coffee maker.
“Steve this is something I’ve never really considered. I’d really have to think about it. I mean I know you would be a good dad, but growing up under Howard makes me question if I can ever be one. Plus with work and being an Avenger and-“ Steve cut him off with a shake of his head.
“Sorry Mr. Stark, I should have been a bit faster” Peter said sheepishly. Tony shook his head and patted him on the shoulder.
“Tony I’m not an idiot. I know that. I didn’t mean physically have a baby...adoption is a thing.” Steve trailed off quietly, leaning back to join his partner against the plush pillows against the headboard.Steve turned on his side to reach over and gently thread his fingers into Tony’s. “We could be good dads. Just imagine us with a little one.” Steve whispered, blue eyes staring into hazel. Tony sighed shifting the bed slightly. He rested his hand on Steve’s hips, a look of sincerity evident on his handsome features.
This one is a bit short, so if you'd like another chapter, just send me an ask and I'll post chapter 5.
“Someone had a good nap.” She commented, smoothing down her unruly hair and running her finger along her cheek, which was patterned with indentations from sleeping against the ruffles of Natasha’s bunched swimsuit strap. The toddler rubbed her eyes a bit and cuddled back into the crook of her neck with a tiny yawn. Affectionately, Natasha patted her back and went back to reading her book. Every now and again she’d look up, and watch the guys play volleyball. Honestly, it was more like Steve and Tony arguing about a strategy (or Tony not wanting one) and Sam and Clint (who had joined them halfway through the day) winging it and kicking their ass. Natasha shook her head and mumbled, “Men” under her breath.
“Look at you, coming in to save the day.” Steve mumbled with a pleased grin settling over his lips. Tony’s chest puffed, a cocky smile coming on his face. He shrugged, smirking at his partner.
Tony says nothing, his hands fisted loosely in his lap. He feels ready to crawl out of his skin. Steve lets the silence stretch for a few moments, his gaze dragging over Tony, before turning away.
And Steve almost does it, almost goes to him. He’d take Tony in his arms and breathe his scent - hold him tight until the sun’s rays warmed their bodies - and the dark would go away for good. Tony would be there and right and warm in Steve’s embrace, where he belongs.
Steve says nothing for a long moment, his eyes boring into Tony. Tony can’t say for certain what it is that lurks in his flinty stare, but it makes the hair rise on his arms. It takes everything in him to look back, his body stiff with an apprehension he can’t hide.
Dr. Boyle consults her clipboard. “It looks as though he’s had surgery on his heart, rendering the reactor unnecessary.”
“Gone,” Natasha answers. That shadow deepens on her face, and Steve has the sudden, frantic thought that he doesn’t want to know after all, doesn’t want to hear the truth of whatever’s making her look at him like that -
He can’t seem to tear his eyes away, and is only dimly aware of Tony’s fingers spreading in invitation.
The sudden swell of nausea Tony feels is not the chicken’s fault, this time, and its with herculean effort that he manages to keep it down.
“What?” he presses, leaning forward. Something is going on here. The desire to understand what is a striking thing.  “What were you going to say?”
Sarah’s look of betrayal all but confirms Tony’s suspicion of him having been the doting parent. His chest actually tightens at her expression, but defying the Commander isn’t worth the girl’s favor, right now. They’re playing a game, he and Steve. Tony doesn’t intend to lose.
He’ll have to get her alone, somehow. Build trust between them. If she already thinks Tony’s her father, then it shouldn’t be hard.
“Tony,” he murmurs, shifting towards him, and Tony is suddenly, searingly certain that Steve means to throw him into the sea. He braces for it, his jaw locked, his eyes wide - but all Steve does is break their hands and wind his arm around Tony’s shoulders, like they’re friends.
He can feel Steve’s eyes on him, lingering. Finally: “I’ll be back later, then,” Steve says, turning away. Tony holds his breath as he leaves the room, those locks clicking back into place behind him. He falls back onto the bed immediately, his chest heaving.
Wet fingers close around his chin, like Evil Steve can sense his thoughts, and Tony inhales the sickly scent of copper as the other man asks, “Do you know who I am?”
Tony stares at the wall over Steve’s shoulder. Steve’s voice winds in his head; Steve’s hands burn on his skin: Steve’s breath is in his ear, noxious words corroding something in his depths. Tony tries to breathe but his lungs won’t open. Something’s caught in his chest. The world is
- watches him for a long minute. Tony sweats under his scrutiny. He must not give Steve a reason to believe Tony
Steve nods curtly at his men, who obey his silent command and file into the portal without looking back.
Steve jumps at the sound of Fury’s irate voice reverberating around them, his focus snapping to the intercom above their heads.
“You don’t...know me?” Not-Steve asks. His voice is steady enough, if a little hoarse, but when Tony musters the will to meet his gaze again, it’s to see a frightening fragility shining bright in the familiar blue, like fraying thread.
Later, after it’s all gone to shit, Tony will wonder if it wasn’t his own self-pity that summoned the catastrophe. It wouldn’t be the first time.
He looks away, his huge hand tightening around Mjolnir, like he’s thinking about hurling it at something.
because they have the same flaxen hair and muscled build, the same soft mouth and square jaw. But there is something fundamentally
He tries to get up, but he must have hit his head, because his ears are ringing and something hot is running down his scalp  -
“Come with me,” he says, as if Tony has a choice, and leads him towards the door. They step at last from the bedroom into what Tony recognizes for sure as the rest of his Malibu estate, soft with morning. His chest tightens with a strange tequila of nostalgia and unease as Steve herds him through this home long lost to him, now whole and airy and pristine. His memories haven’t done it justice, really, Tony thinks, as Steve leads him down the winding stairs, past the rows of glass windows and the great bar taking up one corner of this particular level.
“The future,” Tony echoes. He can't help the wry twist of his mouth. “That's a funny thing to hear from you.”
He starts by placing a hand on Steve’s chest, suppressing a wince at the blood he feels wetting his palm. It’s all over him, now, but Tony has bigger problems.
There is...a strange, charged tension swelling in the short distance between them. He wishes, with sudden ferocity, that he had not agreed to do this. That those eyes would
The ground is trembling beneath them, and the roar has become deafening. Back-up will rush the building any minute. If he can just stall for long enough…
The look on T’Challa’s face tells Steve that the king already knows, whatever it is, and he has to stomp down a swell of anger as Natasha swallows, and says, “You know about the Washington attack.”
She shakes her head, that furrow deepening. “I feel it,” she whispers. Her hands are tight fists in her lap, the faintest glow surrounding them.
Steve barely manages to keep his expression in check. He glances at Natasha, who is studying him with that unnerving x-ray stare.
It’s not hard to act subdued as he sets in on his meal, nausea flipping his stomach when  the first bite of chicken touches his tongue. Aware of Steve’s intent gaze, he tries to chew more enthusiastically than he had the pancakes earlier, and makes a show of going in for the next bite, and the next.
And if his heart shudders and his shoulders bow with the crushing force of his relief - Tony is not lost, Tony is still here - then that’s for him to know, and no one else.
so he figures he and Ross both have a better chance of making it out of this if he gives himself up, now.
Steve, he remembers, his hands curling into fists. Panic tight in his throat, Tony forces himself to think through it and says,
He glances back in the direction of his workshop as Steve tugs him into the day. It’s blinding, and Tony gulps the salted air with silent greed, his head craning to the open sky, streaked orange and violet with the fading dawn. Below, the sea beats insolently against the rocks, its muted roar sending cold thrills down his spine.
The arc reactor sits at the bottom of his world’s Pacific, but Tony can still feel it plugging his chest. Palladium constricts his pounding heart, sends fire through his veins. His wills his hands to shaking fists, ignores the bite as Steve goes on, “Whether it’s of old age -- here, with me --  or of other, less fortunate circumstances is up to you, and no one else.”
The Norse god has just caved in the steel door with Mjolnir when they are stopped in their tracks by a blinding light, like the implosion of a star.
- ignores him, leaning dangerously close again. Tony tenses and turns away, his teeth gritting, but Steve seizes his jaw, forcing his head straight again as his lips brush Tony’s ear.
some negligible part of him is wondering again, but the voice is quickly submerged in the heat searing throughout Tony’s body, dizzy and electrifying.
Finally, Steve speaks. “As I said: I don’t expect you to adjust, right away. You need time, and I’m willing to give it to you.”
This close, soft with love, his eyes are indistinguishable from the real Steve’s. Tony feels himself sinking into that gaze, melting forward, because the alternative is another panic attack.
The preservation of his work and its secrets are of paramount importance to Tony: in any world, he’d think. But then - didn’t those soldiers carry guns of
Natasha stands next to him, still as death. Her brilliant eyes are pinned also to the man beyond the glass, and it is as though a veil has been cast over her features.
Steve doesn’t appear to recognize or care how close Tony is to clawing out his brilliant eyes. He regards Tony as one would a petulant child, his brows furrowed.
Tony-not-Tony is staring at him with an intensity that leaves him deeply discomfited, and he is briefly overcome with the urge to step back as the other man dissects him with his eyes.
he thinks, but dares not voice. This Steve, as loathe as Tony is to admit it, has sufficiently cowed him for the time being. He nods once, mute and stone-faced. Steve pulls back to assess him, lush mouth pursing slightly at the wall of nothingness he finds.
With a shout of frustration, Thor brings the hammer down on the table, causing Bruce and Clint to wince as they step through the door, followed by a stony-faced Natasha and a thunderous-looking Fury. Several armed agents loom behind them.
“I understand,” he whispers. And, channeling the love he holds for Steve Rogers, Captain America, Tony squeezes the Commander’s hand. The change is as abrupt as it is disconcerting; Steve’s face floods with an unbearable warmth, his free hand rising to cup the back of Tony’s neck. He brings Tony closer, and for a heart-stopping instant Tony thinks Steve means to kiss him -- but all he does is rest their foreheads together.
“Whatever the reason,” he says finally. “I think we can all agree we have a very volatile situation on our hands. Someone with Stark’s face and fingerprints has the potential to
“Maybe.” Fury’s disbelief is palpable. He swings back to the window, his coat flaring dramatically behind him. Silence reigns while he considers the suspect.
“Wait!” Tony says desperately. He yelps as Steve grows impatient with his struggles, throwing him neatly over one shoulder. “
the Commander growls. It’s a threat and a promise all rolled into one ugly package,  and Tony understands, as Steve’s arm snakes around his waist, that he’s in deep shit. A too-loud voice within him screams that he call for back-up, for his friends - but Tony doesn’t have too many of those, anymore. Not enough to matter.
“Uncuff me,” Tony says abruptly. He looks back up at Steve with a familiar set to his shoulders, the way he used to when he was particularly intent on getting his way.
“It’s time to go,” Steve repeats, ignoring him. And Tony understands, with a sinking heart, exactly what he means by that. He gapes up at the other man, mouth open in a no doubt stellar imitation of a fish.
He forces himself to breathe. Counts to ten. It only barely helps; panic alights Steve’s skin, sparks electric in his skull, and whatever he does he can’t seem to fully quell it. It has chased him since he first flicked on the TV and saw the screaming banners of text - since that name rang in his ears and chest, and closed his throat.
Tony, tries to wrench Evil Steve’s arm toward him, but he might as well be wrestling with stone. The other man doesn't budge an inch.
Steve advances further, that ringing yet to fade within his ears. He wants to lie down, to seize his shield and hurl it into the nearest wall. Instead he looms over her, his jaw set hard, and demands, “What happened, Natasha?”
The wind is knocked back out of him, and Steve has to tear from the bed before it overtakes him again, the hole in his chest. He stands there, lost and shaking and alone, black creeping into the edges of his vision and pain blooming bright where his nails gouge the flesh of his palms, until his throat closes and the room blurs around him, smearing away,
How many more souls have paid for his existence today? Tony wonders, as Steve’s wet fingers card through his hair. How many more has he damned?
The hole within him has eased somewhat, but it still gnaws as Steve sets his shoulders and returns to the main floor. He doesn’t remember climbing the stairs - or even leaving his room - and his hands open and close, open and close, the further he gets away from their quarters.
That look - of utter adoration, and something else Tony won’t name - has no place in Steve’s eyes. Not for Tony.
“The Avengers?” Evil Steve’s drawl cuts into his thoughts. Those lips curl in an odd little smile that Tony does not like at all. “Don’t worry. We won’t be here long enough for them to be a problem.”
He’s just dared to feel something like relief when Steve straightens, his head cocked toward the ceiling. Soldiers will be crashing through it any second, Tony knows.
“We’ve wasted enough time,” Steve tells him, like he knows Tony’s thoughts. He snatches up the shield in one swift motion, and secures it at his back. “C’mon.”
The moment is ruined, however, when he looks up to find Steve watching the both of them. His expression is strange. Those lips are pulled into a little half-smile that Tony doesn’t like, for the glittering of those ice-chip eyes.
Steve considers him for a moment, silent. Then, without looking away, his hand slides up Tony’s wrist, and he
As it is, Steve had snapped awake at Clint’s startled cry, managing to yank the needle out before too much of the drug (an extraordinarily strong sedative, the lab technicians informed them) entered his bloodstream. The serum has filtered most of it out by now, and he wants to blame his current unsteadiness on some lingering traces of it. But Steve isn’t in the habit of lying to himself.
And like that, the chaos within Steve narrows to a single point. Adrenaline thrums in his blood, thumps in his chest. He stares down at Natasha, a searing focus sweeping away all else within him.
They aren’t on anything approaching good terms, but Tony saved his life. Maybe that counts for something. If he could relay what he witnessed to the others -
guns, until he gets the hint and walks forward, his wariness heightening with each step towards Evil Steve, whose eyes don’t leave his.
- to make due on his promise, whatever that entails. So he licks his chapped lips, ignoring how Steve’s eyes track the motion. Forces himself to speak.
