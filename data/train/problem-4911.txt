Then the spell was broken by Tony leaping onto Steve, wrapping his limbs around him like an octopus as he murmured “Oh god, I’ve missed you so much, so so much Steve you have NO idea.” Steve pressed kisses onto Tony’s head and breathed in the scent of the man he had spent the last month without. “Actually, I think I have a pretty good idea,” he replied.
Thor, who had been uncharacteristically quiet and staring at the wall with a clenched jaw up until this point, suddenly spoke up. “Does anyone happen to know what it was that actually
“I don’t know what to do,” she confessed quietly, helplessly. Clint looked on the verge of tears himself, while Bruce was running his fingers through Thor’s hair in a desperate attempt to calm both of them. For the first time ever, the Avengers felt truly hopeless.
She went downstairs to where everyone else had gathered in the living room, talking in hushed voices. Thor noticed her first. “How is he?”
Steve. That’s like a universal constant. No matter where you go, Tony loves Steve. He practically worships the man, and I know for a fact that Steve feels the same way, which brings me to the main question: what the hell is going on? There was nothing even
“Put it on,” Steve repeated in a whisper, and Tony reverently took it out, dropping the box to the floor.
Natasha spoke up. “Let’s think about what we do know. Steve and Tony were perfectly fine until just now. They fought, Steve said ‘it’s over’ as he walked out, and Tony locked himself in his lab. They’re evidently not together anymore. But why?”
Steve sighed in frustration but looked at Tony with a look of extreme fondness. “Fine, just, will you marry me?”
The rest of the team shared a startled and scared look over his head. “Steve,” Clint began hesitantly. “It doesn’t have to mean you never talk to him again. The kind of love you two shared- it could carry on into a close friendship, easily. I just...it doesn’t have to be the end, you know?” Steve looked up at him, looking so distraught it pulled at his heartstrings. “But I’m still in love with him, Clint. I think I always will be,” he confessed quietly. “I don’t think I could survive being just friends with him.”
Tony’s lips wavered, and he looked down, his eyes suspiciously bright. He suddenly all but collapsed sideways into Thor, who had brought the blanket to the shivering Tony and wrapped it around him and sat down right next to him.
“I’m SUCH an idiot,” he muttered to himself. “You put this on me, please,” Tony said suddenly, thrusting the ring into Steve’s arms.
Steve frowned, scowling playfully at Tony. “Come on Tony, what did I just say about letting me finish my sentences?”
“Tony, it’s okay. No, stop getting up, sit down.  Thor, bring a blanket here, yes, that one. Tony. Tony, look at me.” Finally, he glanced up, trying to force a brave smile. “I’m fine Tasha, really, I just need to get back-“
at a breakup, and Nat and I are super cool super spies, so we should know. They were planning their future together, for Christ’s sake.”
They sat there until Tony’s sobs finally died down. Now, Clint was laying in Tony’s lap, and Tony had his head on Nat’s shoulder while one hand was being held by Bruce. Nat was massaging Tony’s scalp gently and Thor was humming a soothing melody, sometimes even singing along. He had an angelic voice, and whenever he would actually choose to sing, everyone was mesmerized. The god was still sitting behind Tony, his head resting on the genius’s shoulder, and Bruce was right next to him, holding Tony’s arm, with Thor’s arm draped over his shoulders.
Everyone was quiet for a moment, silently agreeing. Bruce frowned. “Are you saying he was...forced? Coerced?”
Tony looked terrible. There were circles under his eyes darker than anything they had ever seen on him. He was shaking, and horribly pale, and the redness of his eyes stood out starkly against the pallor of his face. He was thinner than the last time they saw him, looking almost gaunt, and Clint and Natasha shared a worried look over his head.
Tony looked up at him with wide eyes, looking cautiously hopeful as Steve moved so close that their foreheads were nearly touching.
“Over my dead body, Stark.” Tony flinched back in surprise, and Nat made her voice softer. “We’re here for you, Tony. You don’t have to pretend with us.”
At that moment the door burst open and Steve stood there, looking frenzied. “Sorry, I forgot my jacke-“ he started, voice cutting off as his eyes fell on Tony, sitting in the middle of the room with the ring. The energy seemed to drain from him as he paled, looking like he had the weight of the world on his shoulders.
“It’s okay,” Clint spoke up. “You don’t have to know, Steve. This is a bad situation that no one knows how to deal with.”
“But I thought he was past that. He would’ve told us. He’s a genius, he would’ve figured out a way,” Clint protested, then shook his head miserably. “That’s also why none of this makes any goddamn sense. Tony
“-and I was thinking, is this what I really want to spend the rest of my life with? Because you kept trying to shut me up and-“
Clint carefully nudged the door open, peeking into Nat’s room. Seeing Nat, Bruce, and Thor already sitting on or around Nat’s bed, he let himself in, making his way toward everyone, who glanced up at him with matching bleak expressions on their faces. Nat spoke up first, grimly turning to face Clint. “How bad is it?”
idiots, you know that? A month! A full month of dealing with idiots who were behaving like two wet rags just because they can’t communicate at all!” she exclaimed. “I swear, you two are lucky I’m relieved it’s over, and that I’m happy for you, otherwise I would’ve killed you two already.” The two idiots wisely remained silent. “Don’t think you’re off the hook though,” she warned. “There will be retribution later.”
“I’m still so, incredibly, majorly, pissed, got that?” Steve murmured. Tony nodded frantically. “But,” he continued, looking at Tony with a soft expression on his face. “I also probably should’ve expected this.” Tony started a righteous sound of protest but cut off midway and shrugged.
! Because I must’ve done something, right? Why else would he...would he...” his voice choked off, and he buried his head in his hands. “God,” he whispered. “Four years. We spent four years together, and now...I don’t know how to live without him. I don’t know if I
It was only about a month after the breakup, and tensions were running high throughout the team. Captain America and Iron Man, instead of working together seamlessly like usual, had been a disaster. They went out of their way to avoid each other, to not talk or even look at each other, and because of that they couldn’t perform some of their signature moves. They gave contradicting orders, refused to communicate what was going on, and overall were insufferable to work with. Natasha had half a mind to slap them both to get it through their thick heads that there were lives at stake here, that this was above their breakup. Maybe she would, after this meeting where she was sure Fury would tear them a new one.
They all looked at each other, frustrated and confused but not knowing what to do. “This is a disaster of the highest magnitude,” Thor finally muttered glumly. Everyone couldn’t help but agree.
Tony’s eyes were shining, and he laughed in a way that seemed both desperate and a bit hysterical. “You were being distant,” he began. “You didn’t want to spend any time with me. You acted jittery and uncomfortable around me, constantly in another place in your head.
By the time Tony’s shaking had subsided, they were all beyond worried. Before Tony could start with his self-deprecating jokes and trying to wave what just happened away, Nat was coaxing him to drink some water and eat some apple sauce, and even though he weakly grumbled, he obeyed without question. Clint, meanwhile, had cleaned Tony’s face off with a warm, damp cloth, and Thor was gently rubbing his shoulders while Bruce did his best to unobtrusively check his pulse to make sure his organs weren’t at risk at shutting down. After a cleared throat and a quiet “Thanks, guys. I owe you a bunch,” and all of them quickly shutting that down, Nat helped him up and led him to his room, made him take some sleeping pills, and tucked him into bed. He collapsed into it, exhausted, and after she kissed his forehead and moved his hair from his face, she made sure he was passed out and comfortable, turned off the light and left.
She blew hair out of her face and sighed deeply. “That is exactly my point, Bruce.” There was a moment of silence as they all tried to process what just happened.
“Okay,” Clint agreed steadily. Steve nodded, as if expecting that, and walked back out. Natasha shared a look with the rest, and in an uncharacteristic show of frustration, ran a hand through her hair.
Tony was silent for a moment, making a show out of looking hesitant and doubting, and Steve looked at him with an expression of utter exasperation. “Tony.”
Moving as if he was in a trance, he got up from his seat and dropped down next to the jacket, Steve’s jacket, and picked up a small, navy blue, velvet box.
They looked at each other with unbridled adoration, as Clint crowed in the background “Put it on! The ring! Put it on!” And Tony looked down to see that he was still clutching the ring.
Clint frowned, looking really frustrated before he spoke up. “None of that seemed like the behavior of someone who willingly broke up with his boyfriend because he was unhappy in the relationship.”
“I’m saying it’s a possibility!” Clint bit out, looking incredibly frustrated.  “None of this makes any sense. They looked so happy, why would they break up?”
“Hopefully this means you’re not leaving the Avengers, Captain?” he asked drily, and Steve grinned sheepishly, rubbing the back of his neck. “Yeah, probably not. I’m not going anywhere,” he declared, looking at Tony with adoration. Tony grinned back.
There was a moment of dead silence before Steve laughed in a sound of pure glee and collapsed into Tony’s arms.
Tony just stared at him, his fists white as he clutched the box with the ring. “You were going to propose,” he whispered, looking horrified.
and this is a pretty big one, you started the conversation with ‘Tony, we need to talk.’ What was I supposed to think?”
Tony nodded frantically, making an aborted move toward Steve. “I honestly can’t begin to say just how sorry I am. I am so, so, so so so sosososo sorry, I swear I didn’t want to break up with you, this month has been an absolute nightmare sludge from hell, but obviously I understand if you don’t want anything to do with me-“ he rambled, but was cut off by Steve swallowing heavily and stepping closer to Tony, until they were only a foot apart. Tony’s words dried up in his mouth as he looked up hesitantly at Steve.
“Oh no,” Tony said, in a heartbroken voice so quiet they only heard it because it was dead silent in the room. Tony was oddly still, his eyes disbelieving as he carefully popped open the box, and his hand flew to his mouth as if burned when he saw the ring inside. You could hear a pin drop in the room, and everyone was frozen in shock.
Their encounter with Steve didn’t go much better. By that point, Tony had locked himself in his lab again, diving into work, but this time he at least let one of them in once every day to deliver him food and stay and chat for a while. They had tried to get some answers as to what happened, but every time they even brushed the topic with a ten-foot pole he would tense up and shut down so they stopped trying. They did manage to get a promise that he wasn’t forced or in any way coerced into this out of him, but that left them with no leads and no ideas.
He ended up lashing out at Clint for trying to clean the dirt off him, at which point Nat had enough. She gave Steve the tongue lashing of his life, after which all the fight seemed to leave him, and he remained quiet as they finished taking care of him, looking at them with wary eyes. He was fingering something in the pocket of his ratty bulletproof jacket (that Tony had made him as part of his new costume, Nat remembered), but took his hand out when he saw that Nat noticed. Nat narrowed her eyes, but let it slide for now. They finished cleaning him up, and when Natasha looked up she saw that he had tears in his eyes.
Clint’s face probably told them all they need to know, but he answered anyway. “Tony’s locked himself in the lab and refuses to come out or even see anyone. JARVIS overrode all our access codes and says he is forbidden from saying anything regarding Tony’s wellbeing. I don’t know the last time he’s eaten, or if he even can get food in his lab,” he muttered off topic, trailing off anxiously, before continuing. “Steve…well, he’s Steve. He’s gone. He ran away, left the tower, going god knows where. Probably to fight crime on his own or something.” Clint slumped against the wall, running his hands through his hair in frustration. “God, what are we going to
Steve closed his eyes. It wasn’t a question, but he nodded anyway. “It’s moot now, of course,” he started but was interrupted by Tony suddenly jumping to his feet. Tony swallowed heavily, throat working, and glanced at the ring, then back at Steve.
Natasha spoke up next. “Maybe they threatened Steve or one of us. You know how Tony is with the people he loves.”
They heard a dull thud behind them, and slowly turned to see Thor looking elated, Clint with a shit eating grin on his face, Bruce looking at them with incredible joy, and Natasha- Nat had slammed her head onto the table.
Natasha winced internally, knowing that look Steve was giving the wall. He was about to explode, and it wasn’t going to be pretty. She hoped Fury finished quickly so she would get a chance to cool him down before he burned down everything in his path of destruction. Or at least, that’s what she thought he would do, so she was as surprised as everyone when Steve stood up suddenly, and in a steady, calm voice, declared “I quit.”
Steve jerked back as if slapped, looking at Tony incredulously. “What? Why on earth would you think that?”
Clint looked at everyone helplessly. Abruptly, Steve stood, breathing heavily, not looking at anyone. “I’m sorry,” he said, without turning around. “I just...I need some time.” His body was tense as if expecting a fight, expecting to be denied, but Natasha just nodded. “Okay,” she said quietly, and his shoulders slumped. He seemed to be in a slight daze. He nodded and made an aborted move forward. He hesitated. “If you need me,” he began, taking a deep breath and looking back at them. “If you need me. I’ll be there.” Natasha caught his eye searchingly, and seemingly satisfied, nodded. Steve exhaled and closed his eyes. “One more thing. Please...um, take care of him, please.”
Cameras flashed as he climbed on stage and took his seat behind the table. People were moving around and talking, journalists were interspersed with members of the public, and Steve could imagine that it would be so much more overwhelming if he could hear the maelstrom of noise.
His clammy hands scrambled for the switch of his bedside lamp which he usually left on overnight to ward off midnight memory attacks. This time, however, as he flicked the switch rapidly, the room remained void of light with the low grumble of the weather outside. Steve could feel his chest tighten at the prospect of being isolated in a power cut with no hope of light for hours. Almost on cue the memories of terror began to seep into his awareness.
Without hesitation, Romanov slapped the newspaper down on the table with a grunt of perfect disapproval. His eyes quickly scanned the title.
"We need your help." He stated plain and simple. Not beating around the bush nor any bells and whistles. Steve had a logical brain; he fed off facts, "I would have been here sooner but you're a hard man to find."
Shrugging, the archer learnt back against Tony’s plush couch, “Well, do you want him back? And feel like you’d never hurt him? I mean, he’s not proposing marriage... he just wants stability.” The sentiment was slightly ruined as Clint shovelled a handful of chips into his mouth. The crumbs bounced down his chest and onto the couch.
“WHICH MOTHERFUCKING ASS LEAKED THE PROGRESS OF THE JENSEN CASE?!” The captain’s voice echoed into the room milliseconds before he kicked the door open and strode inside. He slammed his fist down onto the podium and peered around the room, his eye resting on each employee in turn. The accusation was placed against each and every individual in that room without exception, “Let’s start with Stark and Rogers since they were the primary detectives on this case. So, gentlemen?”
Steve pouted, “Why ruin the fun? Especially when I can think of so many better things to do with your handcuffs.” A mischievous glint flashed in his eyes.
Tears were threatening again. He rarely took the time to think about what it had been like to be raised deaf in a hearing family and the challenges it brought for them.
Tony pulled the microphone toward himself and sang, with a much nicer voice than Steve's, "Yes, I like Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain. I'm not much into health food, I am into champagne. I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon, and cut through all this red tape. At a bar called O'Malley's, where we'll plan our escape." The soldier laughed at Tony's confidence and how well he knew the words.
The genius was peering up at the soldier with a confused and slight ‘What-the-Fuck’ look plastered in his face, “What’s going on?”
And as though that sealed the deal and was proof to his capabilities, the director nodded and called up the other Avengers over the comms. As the man did so, Barton grinned across at Steve who nodded back gently in a controlled motion. The spy could honestly be an excitable puppy sometimes.
“My only fantasy is sending you to jail.” Stark realised immediately that his statement sounded lame and clunky due to his long pause and it made him look slow in comparison to Steve’s speed. Usually, Tony was the quick witted and cheeky one but the criminal was clogging up his brain.
The scolded men nodded like guilty children and hurried off to their desk without a backward glance. If they had looked back they would have seen Fury shaking his head in utter exasperation.
Opening his mouth several times, he resembled a goldfish as he frantically searched for words, “I can’t.”
“Nothing! It was- You were great! I just feel bad about doing it in the files room… Other people have to use this room.”
The scientist stopped a few steps away and stared open mouthed at the scene before him. He blinked and frowned, “You... your leg.”
Natasha smirked at the face Stark was pulling as his ego got smashed into tiny, tiny pieces. The genius span his chair around with his mouth open in hope of getting support from the team but they were all chuckling silently. It wasn't very often Tony Stark got told he was irrelevant to someone. His mouth fluttered open and closed desperately.
“You’ve just proven my point!” Steve cried whilst Stark’s gaze shot between the man and the surface, “And again! What have I done to you?”
Stark’s cheeky smirk only increased, “Did your mom not raise you with manners?” He shouted to be heard over the music, “It’s rude not to say hi when you bump into someone you know or were you a little occupied elsewhere?!” His eyes ghosted suggestively across to Steve’s dance partner.
As he got closer he could see the cause of Steve’s unusual behaviour. The man was still attempting to run whilst leaning down with one hand grasping into his prosthetic leg as though he was trying to hold it together. Stark frowned and landed next to the soldier. Something inside of him told him just to continue on without the soldier but another part of him was reminded of the pain of Steve’s phantom pains only shortly before.
Suddenly the doors opened and Natasha marched in. Looking up, she froze when her eyes landed on the man in front of the window, "Oh shit."
Steve smiled to himself and snuggled back down against his partner, “I haven’t needed them since you’ve been sharing a bed with me but they’ll always be handy for situations like this.” He swallowed before adding, “Thank you for saving me that night.”
"Help me? How?" He needed help, he wasn't denying that. He was just confused about how to actually be an apprentice of an assassin. An apprentice of the assassin he was just employed to kill.
Clint dumped himself down on the end of the large bed with a sigh, "It's... complicated. He's not like me or Nat. We are protected by Shield so we are more or less safe to live wherever we want but Cap... He's an assassin and a good one too which means people want him dead. For anyone in the world to know where he lives is a danger to him. One torture session and someone could have his address and a bullet with his name on." Clint nibbled at the inside of his lip, "The first time I went to his home it took me months to find it and then I tried to go back a year later when I needed his help but he was gone. Some family lived there instead."
“You really shouldn’t make excuses for him.” He murmured but Natasha could tell he was already considering her point of view. He rubbed his fingertips across his lips as he thought.
They hung up and within an hour Tony had locked up the store and was heading home for the night. He could feel butterflies sprouting in his stomach and he tried to convince himself it was due to a progression with the case, not just the fact that he would be seeing Steve again tomorrow.
“You were in the briefing with us, Nat. Of course you know.” He sighed, turning his back to lean against the towers of dusty boxes. He didn’t even care that the dust would leave a mark on his freshly ironed shirt.
“Not anything?” He blanched, “Stevie you’re not the type to stop off somewhere after work for a quickie.” The disgusted look on Steve’s face at the word alone was conformation but his cheeks flushed even darker and Sam instantly knew, “Oh man, don’t tell me you didn’t leave work? Oh god, you did it in the precinct.”
Clint’s spiel continued for nearly 30 minutes, in which time he had the audience laughing so hard that their sides hurt, crying along with him and falling in love with Steve and Tony all over again. When he wrapped up the room applauded for several minutes and the newly weds were pleased as it allowed them to compose themselves and wipe away their tears.
“One: You’re not sleeping. Two: it’s hardly breaking in when it’s my house. Three: I thought you were out because Jarvis said all lights were out.” He shrugged. He stepped closer to the bed, “I wanted to bring you this.”
Out of the six, he was the one Steve clashed with the most. Steve’s cautious yet stern take on matters was a far cry from Tony’s reckless and jovial one. He didn’t hate Tony, or dislike even. Tony just got under his skin too often.
“We need to get out of here,” Steve said, making sure to keep calm, especially after seeing everyone else’s panic-stricken faces.
Steve’s voice came to an abrupt halt when he saw Tony swing it open from the other side. Tony’s usually immaculate pitch black hair was disheveled, his safety goggles barely obscuring that. His prominent brown eyes had giant dark circles below them while his t-shirt was wrinkled and his jeans hung loose on his body, his belt barely holding them up. He looked worse for wear; a single night of sleep was obviously evaded by him.
“I’m– I’m so sorry, Steve,” Wanda said, she choked on a sob, “I let it get out of control; I didn’t mean to–”
“What are you going to use to get it working again?” Steve feigned interest in Tony’s latest project. This seemed a little too out of bounds, even for someone like him.
Steve watched Clint pull up a chair for Wanda before taking his own seat in the table. Beside them, Natasha and Bruce were in their own little conversation, the latter helping the former gather up the clutter that amassed on the countertop and stove.
“Two hours non-stop, at least,” Bruce said, he turned back, watching Steve gently push the car, “He’s gotta let you rest.”
Steve suddenly placed himself in front of Wanda when he could see a couple Hydra soldiers, ones that were in okay shape, heading towards them. They held long electric probes, static threatening to shock them through their high wattage. They weren’t giving up so easily.
He saw Wanda and the two Hydra soldiers get further and further away, their figures turning into blurs his oncoming tears blocked out. He tried yelling out Wanda’s name, but all that came out was a barely audible wince. His throat burned, a whirlwind of emotions hitting him.
“Hey, you know what? I was thinking we could transport it back here,” Tony replied, pushing himself off the counter, “I can get a head start on the repairs and finish them in no time.”
After hearing a disconcerted crack of the neck, Natasha looked to her left, seeing Steve block a punch from another. He turned back and grabbed the fabric of yet another Hydra soldier who managed to creep behind him and threw the man several feet ahead of him. The man yelled out in pain after colliding headfirst into a tree.
The other five were in the same compromising positions, their bodies paralyzed and hands firm on their ears. Steve saw Wanda; she lay on her side in fetal position, blood slowly pooling out of her ears from the unbearable frequency of the noise. He could hear the muffled cries of pain from his friends, overshadowed by the high pitched buzzing.
“Isn’t it better for you to be in the passenger seat instead of all the way out there?” Natasha called out to him, “I’m not exactly an expert at driving.”
“Whatever,” Clint quickly said, wanting to change the subject, “Do you want eggs? Sausage? Or both?”
It took a full hour for them to reach the enclosed field where the abandoned vehicle lay. The grey 1983 Mazda RX-7 had accumulated dirt and dust as it was left alone for several weeks. The tires of the car were flattened, the rubber beginning to pool on the ground, while the windshield had a crack strewn across it.
I wanted to do a maximum ride based fic but with some of the avengers instead because I love both the MCU and Maximum Ride, and I’ve never seen anyone else do a fic like this based off of my days of desperately searching for one.
Steve instantly picked up his speed, hearing the steps of Natasha and Clint not too far from him. Her body was sprawled on the ground, her long brunette hair spreading out from all sides.
Clint’s attention returned to the cylindrical rifle-like weapon, trying to find the appropriate controls. He could hear Tony’s reassuring words contrasting Bruce’s anxious tone.
The six– or five of them rather, were finally situated around the kitchen table, the smallness of it causing them to crowd the area with their close proximities. Tony opted to sit on the counter, pushing himself on top of it, a sausage patty hanging out of his mouth. It was tradition, for them to eat all of their meals together, as a family.
“You’re not serious are you, Tony?” Bruce said, looking like he wanted to faceplant himself on the table.
“Where is she– where did they go?” Steve said, his senses coming back to full force. He could feel his heart jackhammer against his chest, the intense pounding adding to his sudden bout of adrenaline. Clint and Natasha, who were currently hovering over him, could only give him devastated stares.
His hand violently shook as he brought it up to his cheek, feeling blood pool at that area. The back of his head pounded as he pushed himself up.
“Yeah, it’s time the six of us do something together, family bonding and all,” He replied, “…and before one of you tells me it’s too dangerous, I’ve done my research on the internet. You don’t see packs of people there, unlike the store.”
At her periphery she saw more Hydra soldiers begin rush towards her, weapons in hand. Watching her from behind, a very shocked Tony heard rumbling noises. The trees near them were beginning to detach from the ground. She gradually lifted her arms, her fingers curled and the palms of her hands facing upwards. The trees slowly floated upwards on either side of her. Her arms suddenly moved sideways, causing the trees to fly towards the Hydra soldiers, instantly pushing them several feet away.
“Okay, but then what if some crazed person decides to kidnap one of us? We’re six teenagers for crying out loud–”
“Those were really easy, though. I don’t remember you messing up at all on them. I mean, you’re a pretty fast learner–” Steve stopped, just now noticing her changed expression. Her lids were downturned with her lips pressed together.
“I’m going to let you guys off the hook this time,” Loki continued, “Try to follow us and I’ll kill you.”
Yes, he had those repetitive dreams of him and his family being found out. He didn’t think they would actually come to fruition…not when they’ve managed to stay in hiding for eight whole years. That was nearly a decade ago! How did Hydra manage to find them all of a sudden? How come they never anticipated them coming until seconds before they actually appeared?
“They’re not gonna find us, you know that?” Clint brought him out of his reverie. He must have noticed Steve’s downcast expression, “It’s been what – eight years since we’ve escaped. No one, not even Coulson, has suspected anything. They must have given up on us and moved onto different things.”
“Neither am I!” Tony responded, “…Just making sure there’s no damage being done to the car once we start pushing it.”
“So far you haven’t. You’re good at keeping your powers under control,” Steve said, trying his hardest to keep a nonchalant air about this. He pointed to himself, a small smile forming on his face, “Super strength; remember?”
He wanted to air out his grievances, his anger, but it was unfair to the others. They all tried their hardest to fight off those men. He blamed himself the most.
Tony and Bruce hurriedly made their way towards them. Steve peered over Natasha’s shoulder, noticing that Tony’s vehicle was left to the side, untouched.
That was what Coulson taught them. If something didn’t feel right in the slightest, they had to leave. It didn’t matter what type of situation they were in. There was no room for second thoughts; the only thing they were allowed to trust was their instinct. Any miscalculation on their part could lead to imminent danger or even possible death. It was something the average person wasn’t burdened with.
The others quickly noticed Wanda’s presence. Her long, billowy nightgown trailed behind her as she opened the fridge. She frowned, looking ahead at the near empty compartments. A near empty fridge meant that at least two of them, usually Steve and Nat, would take a long walk to the local grocer and use the stash of money that Coulson left them to stock up on essentials. It was a stressful ordeal for them because they would conjure up worst case scenarios that could happen if anything went wrong during one of their very rare ventures to the public. Not to mention, there would be a day where they’d run out of money. Having to resort to stealing would pile onto that whole nerve-wracking ordeal.
“I’m gonna have to pass on that today,” He said instead, “You know that abandoned Mazda I told you about…the one that Bruce and I found together at the field like a few weeks ago - flat tires, busted ignition switch, cracked gas tank and windshield, and anything else wrong with a car you can think of? I’ve been visiting that area, every other day since then, and guess what? The car was still there.”
It was silent for a few moments, Natasha’s dragging of the fork being the only noise in the small kitchen area.
They watched Tony and Clint cease their fighting after Clint nearly tripped over some nearby rocks, the latter getting berated by Natasha for being so careless.
He felt the thick, greasy scent of overly-processed sausage patties and buttery eggs enter his sinuses the moment he reached the first floor. Once he entered the kitchen, the first thing he noticed was Natasha smacking Clint’s hand away from the skillet. The blonde yelped, dropping a sausage patty back into the pan.
Before the masked Hydra soldier could bring the baton back once again, he was sent flying like a limp ragdoll. His disoriented yell echoed throughout the area before his body harshly hit the ground.
Hydra, a secretive terrorist organization, was responsible for Steve’s current predicament. Their main facility, stationed in Siberia, was among the many facilities peppered throughout the world that stemmed from four different sectors: government assets, global criminal groups, intelligence gathering,...and international corporations hid behind what looked like a legitimate business to conduct illicit activities. These illicit activities included experimentation on living people. Steve, along with the five other kids mentioned, were a victim of this. The facility wanted them back because they possessed something special, something that was of prodigious value to Hydra.
He wouldn’t let them take any of his friends. He would rather swallow battery acid then willingly let one of those men get their hands on them. The thought of them having to relive the physical and emotional abuse they’ve experienced at the hands of the lab workers made him sick to his stomach.
Steve sighed, turning around and heading back up the stairs. He was expecting Tony to follow behind him and not run off in the other direction to lock himself up in the basement again.
As he was pacing, Steve was sat up in their bed with their blanket pooled around his trim waist and was pondering how many times one would have to walk back and forth to wear the plush cream carpet away. Moistening his lips, he listened to his partner ranting without paying too much attention as he’d decided that he wouldn’t be swayed.
“What if I pretend I never met you and drop off the radar?” It sounded like an empty threat but Steve had become too attached and integrated into their lives. It was a danger to himself and to the others. He'd been pondering the idea for a few weeks now and the longer it went on the more realistic it seemed. He knew exactly how to do it and it was always entertaining to see how long it took Clint to find him. Usually only a few months but his record was 8 months.
They were all gathered around the briefing table in the conference room while Nick Fury barked orders and directions at them. Tony had been in some dream world until the boss snapped this remark. Instantly, Natasha, Tony and Clint all shared a look that every person in the room picked up on. It was like they were in some secret friendship club that all the other kids in the playground wanted to join.
Later that night, Tony lay next to Steve in his king size bed with their fingers interlinked until Tony wanted to sign. The soldier looked across at him.
Stark snapped into action mode and commanded Jarvis to track the assassin's cellphone coordinates while still talking to the man. He began to surge towards his helipad while ordering his co pilot up immediately; this happened to be the only other person in the whole tower who could fly a helicopter: Natasha.
Steve frowned and slowed his breathing to avoid detection. Whatever they were about to say about him he was emotionally ready. He steeled himself in case he would have to jump up and defend himself like he had done countless times in his life.
"Sam? Sebastian? Scott?" He began listing off names, "Samuel, Simon, Seth, Steven, Sage?" He barked out, "But how did you do it? I honestly can't stop thinking about it?"
Steve blinked slowly at this. He swallowed slowly before realising that it was probably his turn to explain, “I’ve always slept naked. It’s just more comfortable.” His statement fell awkwardly between them.
The door had barely clicked shut behind Tony when the soldier had climbed into their shared bed and pulled their blanket over his head. Smelling like his partner, the bedding caused tears to threaten to overflow in his eyes. He bit his teeth together and silently told himself to get it together. He was doing the right thing for Tony and their relationship. It would be good for them.
While Steve was floundering with his words Tony stepped forward and filled in his whereabouts. There was an easy alibi to excuse him from being interrogated. Meanwhile, Steve got redder in the face and began shifting on the spot.
He sighed, leaning his face up the the slowly lightening sky. It looked somewhat akin to prayer but spoke to Barton instead of God, "Fine, I'll help but I'll report to nobody but you. And they can't snoop in my life. If that's not going to work then we can leave here now like it never happened."
Intelligent eyes stared into his face for a moment before she stepped back from the doorway to allow him entry. She closed the door behind them and began speaking as she climbed the concrete steps up to the next level. Tony followed just as she knew he would.
The genius began pacing in circles as he waved his arms around repeating “what the fuck” like a mantra.
“I can’t believe it.” Steve uttered between deep lunges, “It almost feels like... like I still have my leg.”
There were several beats of silence and Tony was convince that Steve was about to completely ignore him, “I don’t want to talk about it.”
His shoulder was throbbing as though the bullet was still inside him but he grit his teeth against the pain. He had essentially a vat of morphine in his medical kit for this exact reason.
Minutes later, Steve was taking off his new prosthetic and climbing into bed beside Tony. They both wouldn’t admit to making the first move but somewhen throughout the night the men ended up entwined together and it was the best night sleep they’d had in years.
Tony had been praying all morning that this wouldn’t happen but it did. He heard Steve enter the kitchen while he was making his coffee. He purposely didn’t turn around as he didn’t feel like he could look at Steve after last night. He knew the man’s face would make him think of the man’s butt and he liked Steve too much to just think about his butt without him knowing what happened.
“I’ll be so good. I won’t even leave the car, I promise.” His grip around Tony’s arm was getting tighter as his desperation flowed through him. In the few seconds Tony hesitated Steve added, “I’ll tie you up and won’t let you leave unless you let me come.”
She smirked. There was only a certain few people in this world that Tony would go to interesting lengths to get their number and apparently Captain turned out to be one of them. Romanov considered mocking him but quickly changed her mind. If Stark was making some sort of emotional progress she didn't want to be the one to stunt his metaphorical growth.
Only an hour later he was dressed and stepping out the door of the tower. He looked back up and swallowed thickly at the thought of Steve being alone while he was out with a stranger. However, the drive in his guts had him moving towards the nightclubs. Hopefully he’ll be back within a couple of hours so he could make it up to his partner.
"Stark!" She snapped, "Don't do that. I could have killed you!" Which they both knew was not an exaggeration as Natasha always travelled prepared.
They watched as the man called again, “Come on, Steve! I said I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to screw it up!” He began shivering severely as he moved over to hold his finger against the ringer for Steve’s apartment.
“No! You know exactly what I mean!” There didn't seem any reasonable justification, in Tony's mind, to why a wounded detective should sleep on the rat infested, kinda damp and rock hard floorboards.
“I’ll let you in on a secret, Mr Stark... I don’t trust myself either.” Rogers stood up from the interrogation table whilst sliding his jacket onto his muscular shoulders in one smooth movement, “But my word is all you have. Good day, Officer.”
Tony saw the tall blond stumbling to talk so stepped in to defend the man. He didn’t know why he felt the need to help him but something in his core pulled him to intervene, “C’mon, Captain. We all know goodie two shoes would never-“
At least he was pacing, Clint knew the man well enough to know he was churning it over in his mind as he walked. Standing stone still would be bad news, "You'd be doing me a favor."
He fell back into the small apartment and threw his arm out to catch himself. It left a long smear of blood along the pale wall and he muttered an out of breathy mild curse. He pushed himself over to his bed where he flopped down to place pressure on it while pulling out his cell phone.
Steve sighed, “I love you, Detective Tony Stark.” He could feel Tony’s confusion at the sudden announcement, Steve was always more open with his feelings than Stark but neither were overly emotional.
“Okay,” Natasha called from where she was flying the plane, “We are over the landing spot. All out! See you in a couple of minutes.”
Steve sat up, the blanket fell from him and, upon the reveal of his muscled chest, Stark was reminded that Steve was, in fact, definitely not a grandpa. He felt his eyes linger on his body but snapped himself out of it immediately as he remembered that it was Steve and they had a complicated relationship.
Steve chuckled, “We only arranged it with you yesterday.” He gestured to a large leather chair that sat adjacent to the mahogany desk and Tony sat obediently.
Steve lays down his boundaries but ends up feeling guilty and self-conscious of his sexuality. A lack of communication leads Tony to do something he doesn’t want to do. They’ll quickly learn the value of communication.
However, his brain caught up quickly and he scolded himself for being so slow. Steve wouldn’t even know he’d there because he’s deaf.
The genius wouldn't never admit that he jumped when the calling tune blared out across the workshop despite the evidence video Jarvis now had that proved the contrary. His dark eyes peeped up at the device where it rested on a workbench across the room. He rolled his eyes and refocused his attention on the microwires and chips in his hands. Whatever Pepper wanted could wait until he was next in the office. However, as the tone continued to scream out something inside him caused him to discard his work and pad over to the cell and he was ever so glad he did as his heart pounded when he noticed the caller ID: Captain Mystery Assassin.
They had moved him to a larger hospital for the amputation. A fact which Steve briefly forgot when he was coming around from the anaesthetic so panicked greatly for a minute.
The door opened and Steve span on the spot, ready to fight. The unfamiliarity of the light weight strapped to his leg made him nearly lose his balance; he’d adjusted to the old prosthetic in every way so a sudden change was throwing him off. He eased slightly when a woman in US uniform walked in. Her dark curled hair was long and rested against her shoulders. His mind registered the unusualness of her hairstyle for a war time.
Thor had walked in late, having spent the last few weeks in Asgard, but immediately jumped upon the conversation, "I know of a being in Asgard that'd be more than happy to take-"
"Director Fury. This is Cap and he's willing to help us take down Doctor Wright." Barton finally introduced when he realised that the two other men were too busy inspecting each other to actually start communicating. He expected it from Steve, a secretive and sceptical super assassin, but not from Fury.
Steve was about to prove that he could have fun too, without them, even if the only person he was proving it to happened to be himself.
“You’ve been in a coma for 2 weeks after your surgery caused an infection in your... leg. You’re body is weak and without help you could easily die. We both know your real track record when it comes to health isn’t the best.” The man informed him easily.
“Oh shit! Sorry, I was just... Wait, why are you in bed, grandpa? It’s 9pm.” He pulled an incredulous face as he gestured to the man fully tucked up in his king size bed. All that was missing was a mug of hot coco and a glass for his dentures.
Stark nodded, his assessment had been correct. He held onto Steve and dragged the man up to the pillows and rested him there. It was hard work under the man’s dead weight but he managed it. He sat on the edge of the bed and watched the suffering man carefully and anxiously.
Stark beelined for the shared kitchen as he knew that Bruce had some herbal tea stashed away somewhere and with all the bruises he had he wasn’t about to fuss over whether there were scientific benefits to herbal tea.
The bright, mega-watt smile was implied in Steve’s tone and caused the guilty party to lift his head slowly, “Look, Stark. What you guys did really hurt me but I accept your apology and want to thank you for coming all this way to see me.”
Maybe it was his eagerness which was his downfall. All he knew was that one minute he was leading his men through the trees and the next he could barely breathe through the all-over body pain.
Steve jumped up with as much excitement as a kid on Christmas and began hanging the lights across his bed’s headboard. Once it was complete he nodded at it in satisfaction and tried to ignore the warmth spreading through his chest at the thought of Tony buying them especially for him.
"Well somebody could have told me this previously! 2 days ago he was nearly dying so I didn't exactly expect him to be up to his old tricks," The billionaire defended himself, "Anyway, why don't you just go to his house and bring him back?"
40 minutes in and they were slowing down. Somehow the latest villain had a seemingly endless supply of bots that were doing a pretty good job of kicking their ass. The whole team had gathered near the Main Street to try and amalgamate their fighting power. Stark and Thor we’re taking them out as they fell from the sky whilst Clint, Hulk, Natasha and Steve took care of the ones already on the ground. They looked exhausted but were still trying hard.
"I was slightly thrown when I realized you'd left without all your stuff including your cellphone but I figured that you'd have more than one. Especially since Clint had said he'd get in contact with you but it was a challenge to get this number."
“I love you, Steve. And you’re wrong, I’m the lucky one here.” He leaned up and placed a kiss on Steve’s lips.
Steve chuckled and blushed at how seriously Tony was taking this. He really cared about making him comfortable, “I don’t mind really as long as you don’t tell me all about it. I don’t really want to know any details.”
"I got a call from you and at first I thought you were high or drunk or both." He scratched his beard as he recounted the last few days, "By the time we got there you were pretty close to bleeding to death but the medic saved your life. We had to in hospital for the first day or so, and you had your blood transfusions, until I demanded you get transferred here for safety. You had a full time nurse and all the machines for a couple of days until you were showing signs of improvement. She still pops in twice a day but I mainly care for you now with Shield helping here and there. So you've been unconscious for a few days." He explained, he watched carefully for signs of shock.
Minutes later, Stark was still trying, unsuccessfully, to extract information from Steve about his late night antics. However, he was secretly sure the man probably just got too engrossed in searching for mistakes in the crossword puzzle until 2am… it had happened before. They both jumped as Fury’s office door was thrown open, threatening to smash the glass panelling, and the man marched out with a look of utter rage carved into his face.
Tony looked across at the other Detectives, “I did get the impression that it was a very well rehearsal show. They must do it semi-regularly to be so versed in all the knowledge. Even the workers answers all questions without a problem.”
"Speak." He muttered quietly. He wished he could use the formalities but he was on a job and he wasn't about to get himself killed by doing so. His gray eyes continued to scan the street lamp lit road where his target should run past any minute now. He kept his other hand curled tightly around the gun in preparation.
At their head table Tony slipped a hand under the table cloth to intertwine his fingers with his new husband. He could feel the gold band encircling Steve’s finger and he tried not to allow the grin on his face to turn completely and uncontrollably goofy. Steve seemed to have the same thought as he looked across at his partner and smiled.
Steve laughed and he couldn’t stop the smile from breaking out onto his lips. Never had anyone every tried to make even half the effort for him. Tony grinned back and winked across the table at him.
“You’re hard to kiss when you’re happy. Be sad, for me… Just one minute of sadness.” Tony chuckled as he felt Steve’s lips curl up even further.
He got in closer before leaping on the invader with all his weight. The man fell down with a screech before fighting back wholeheartedly.  They scuffled for a few moments before the invader moved around enough to get a view of his attacker’s face.
“No!” Steve’s hand grabbed the genius’ wrist and, not realising how tightly he squeezed, begged, “Upstairs. Please.”
He rushed to his room and threw on his usual ‘going out’ outfit that actually rarely got used and prepared himself for a night in the town. It felt strange heading out on his own as Bucky had accompanied him the last few times but Barnes was on active duty again now so Steve was without a companion. He tried to ignore the seed of anxiety that was planted in his stomach at the idea of being alone in a club or bar as he didn’t want to seem like the lonely weirdo out looking for friends.
Grinning, Stark answered, “Yeah, and I like kissing you too. But seriously you’ll have to tell me what you’re okay with since I don’t want you to ever feel uncomfortable around me.”
“How about starting from the beginning? Holding hands, kissing, touching, touching where? No sex, no masturbation?”
“No, thank you. One mechanical leg is enough, I can’t imagine a whole suit.” Despite his rejection he smiled gently.
“My goddamn leg was giving me jip and I couldn’t stand another moment with it or in my crutches.” He gestured over to where the keg was propped up beside his chair where he strapped in every morning.
If his face could get any warmer they’d be able to turn off the building’s heat and instead warm the office from his cheeks alone, “Me and this man… engaged in sexual relations.”
“Whoever is getting married would be smart to purposely ‘lose’ your invitation in the mail.” Stark crossed his arms as he huffed. Clint was practically dripping in mischief and Tony didn’t like it.
“Oh...” Bruce stared for a moment longer before he was able to control his inner scientist and researcher and approach him, “Do you need help?”
“I-I… I wasn’t!” Steve stuttered as his face grew increasingly beetroot coloured. Maybe he was thinking about Stark but that was only out of complete boredom! He hunched over is notebook as a scowl curled across his lips.
The knock on the cold metal echoed inside but he didn’t get a chance to consider the sound as the door was suddenly swung open to reveal a slim, red headed woman. Natasha Romanoff: she had also made several appearances in his case files but Stark could never pin her down or figure her out. What was she to Rogers? What did she do in the organization that he ran?
However, after a brief moment of darkness he called out to Jarvis, “Lights on, J.” Instantly the room was flooded in light.
“Well, I feel that went well.” Tony grimaced before shuffling around the larger detective and heading for the door. Steve, on the other hand, just continued peering at the floor in disappointment.
Must be some weird assassin thing because Tony would use his name all the time to just prove he knew it.
"Я в России." The accent melted into the words smoothly, burning all evidence of his Brooklyn origins. He quickly translated for the other man, "I'm in Russia."
Steve was still laughing when a moment later he was also targeted by the rain. Instantly, he assumed a faux serious attitude and grabbed his date's hand, "I think we're going to have to run." He spoke with such seriousness that anyone listening would have thought they were under fire from weapons rather than water.
Once again the staff laughed. Tony felt a comfortable warmth settle across his chest at the reminder of his friends here in the office. Even though Steve had moved on things didn’t have to change for him. He still had his partner, still had his friends and still had the job he loved. As he lowered his hand the gold band glinted in the light again and he peered down at his hands with a gentle smile. The golden glint contrasting the light brown of his sun darkened fingers.
Little did Steve know that Tony didn’t feel anything like this. He recognised Steve’s pain in the pain he felt in his arch reactor so he wanted to reach out and help the soldier. If Steve was going to have a stick up his ass then Tony wouldn’t bother. He’d try to go back to hating the ass although it would be difficult now he knew they had survivorship as something that connected them.
“They were pretty common during the war and we’d been trained to keep an eye out for them. I don’t know whether I was just tired, just being sloppy or maybe it was just hidden really well but I didn’t see it and set it off. Probably for the best since my men were following behind me so if it wasn’t me then it would have been one of them.” He stopped and took a shaking breath, “It completely mangled my leg to the point that it didn’t even look leg-like anymore. The rest of my body got completely mauled by the debris which is why I have so many scars.” His own fingers traced the old wounds, “I would have died from my injuries and the infection from the surgery if it wasn’t for Dr Erskine who selected me for the serum.”
He pulled the trigger and the small metal death sentence sliced whisperlessly though the air until it plunged into the back of the man's head. The man collapsed onto his knees before hitting the ground. There was no way he'd survive that.
Tony sighed but that is pretty much what it felt like. Mr non-commitment being asked to commit. He just wasn’t programmed for it.
Erskine shrugged, “Honestly, I can’t tell what it’ll do. It may come back but it may not. Are you willing to wear an advanced prosthetic on the battlefield, just in case?”
“No, Tony. I’m just... broken.” He refused to look anywhere that wasn’t the floor. Hatred flooded his heart.
“I came to see you.” He put every inch of plea into his voice, “I realise what I did was a dick move and I need to apologise.” The admission hurt his ego but he hoped it was for a good cause.
Visor rising, Tony didn’t waste any time, “What’s wrong?” Although he hated to admit it, Steve was one of their strongest team members and they needed him in order to function as a team.
They left the room awkwardly with Tony continually trying to tease and flirt with Steve but the larger man was just desperate to flee the crime scene before they got caught. Within minutes they were both miles from the precinct, heading home in an opposite direction with the other one on the mind.
The bright lights forced him to close his eyes after an attempt to see the world. He squinted against it and opened them again only to come face to face with Tony Stark. The billionaire was hovering over his bed anxiously.
He coughed slightly as if extracting himself from a reverie, “Anyways, after the serum I continued in the army for a while until I ended up in the frost and, well, you know the rest.”
"Cap? It's me, Clint. Look, I know I told you to wait on the Professor Wright thing but Shield are getting impatient. I've looked into it and it really does look like they're up to something so go ahead." The spy had asked Steve to wait before assassinating the man because he wanted to check over the company to ensure it really was evil. Needless to say he found more than enough evidence to prove Shield's point. "Anyway, do it as soon as you're well enough for it. Get better soon."
The genius hummed in satisfaction as Steve pushed the door shut behind him. Tony took the lead now as he lowered the soldier onto the bed and gazed down at the exposed chest to run his fingers over the tight muscles there. Fingers grazed over raised skin as his touch found the large scars from Steve’s accident again. Tony’s mind instantly leapt to imagining what might have caused it. Did the freezing do it? Or something from the war? Or before? He’d still not been told of anything that had happened to Steve from before they met.
Clint wiped the water off his face despite the fact he'd be wet again only moments later. His shoulders were getting cold from the way his clothes were as absorbent as a sponge. He strode on towards the apartment building determinedly. He wasn't about to let his boss down and besides, he was being paid a hefty sum for this job.
If someone was to ask how they got here they probably wouldn’t be able to narrate the whirlwind romance that had swept them up. Now here they were waking up together in Stark’s unnecessarily large bed in his unnecessarily large penthouse. The genius had an arm wrapped around his still sleeping partner. He gazed down at the man with a smile, thinking about how the last month had completely changed his life.
“Mr Rogers,” Stark spat as he braced himself against the table, “We were fine without you. Don’t you think it’s time you retire?”
"It's not," The assassin sighed, fingers lightly flicking the corner of the paper, "I mean, in the bigger picture, he's does a lot worse for a lot less."
“And it doesn’t make any difference to me whether you like sex or not! I’ve been building up the courage to ask you on a date for months! I’m not going to suddenly change my mind because you don’t want to sleep with me. I like you for who you are!”
Two weeks after Steve is discharged, a media conference is held for him to tell them all about his accident and recovery. However, in the process his deafness will be revealed.
Steve knew they were there but didn't move more acknowledge them. Director Fury, on the other hand, seemed more than happy for the assassin to just stand there so he could assess him and the immediate vibes he got from the large man. Eventually, Clint coughed in sign for Steve to just turn around already.
? Steve mouthed, surprise radiating through his body. He hissed between his gritted teeth when his brain seemed to catch up with the pain in his side. The couch groaned as Steve dumped himself back down. He noticed the mug and cold press that Tony held in his direction. He signed,
