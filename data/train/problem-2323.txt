'You police?' He panted. Sherlock took his time with the reply. He could hear Lestrade and at least four others moving closer.
Sherlock's sarcasm heavy tone seemed to be totally lost on the effusive voice at the other end- 'Mother' Sherlock mouthed.
‘Is it that bad?’ Sherlock mumbled, nose nuzzling at the junction of thigh and pelvis. Surprising himself that he was asking the question and was interested in the answer. John's scent was strongest here, like a handful of crushed aromatic herbs.
‘All of that, yeah. The thing is I’m getting a lot of that already from you. Any physical stuff would just the icing on the cake.’
'I'd like us to bond, doesn't need to be this heat or the one after but...' Sherlock let his head fall, drawing lines with nose and lips over the scent gland. It should be all the answer John needed but he still wanted to hear it. He needed to know Sherlock
' You Ok- everything good with Molly?' John said tucking his phone into his inside pocket, noting the pensive look.
‘You do like the clothes though?’ Sherlock said hopefully, pulling back a little.
John went after the alpha to the bedroom. A little pleased, in spite of himself, that Sherlock's eyes followed him fiercely.
'Did you kick them out of the bridal suite?' John was looking round himself with amusement.
'I actually meant the ankle.' John broke in smiling. I don't have any doubts about the rest of you.' He slid his hand down to rest on the alphas belt, slowly loosening it and pulling it from the loops.
Sherlock moved his hand to rest on John’s crotch for half s second. ‘Show me.’ He said, voice dry and eyes wide.
They mutually pulled away, reluctant and embarrassed.
‘Planning to fall down the stairs are you?’
There was no other word to describe how John felt as he unlocked the front door and quietly climbed the stairs, steeling himself to face Sherlock. It had been heat stuff. He couldn't help it, very possibly wasn't even remembering a lot of it (thank God) but he still wanted to crawl under a rock in embarrassment.
' Thank you- I've imagined you doing that- it felt incredible.' The alphas voice was shaky. There was a sense of satisfaction at having unravelled him so completely. Sherlock began to kiss and lick John's neck, the omega arching up to his mouth and thrusting into his hand. It wasn't dignified but John couldn't have cared less and was soon coming under Sherlock's hand. The alpha seemed surprised and intrigued to suddenly be sticky and they lay together on the bed after a quick clean up with tissues.
All at once John had kicked away his chair and backed into the wall, raw instinct moving him quickly. He stared at the detective, fingers curling into the paintwork.
‘No, it’s not.’ Sherlock glanced at him through lined eyes. ‘It’s for you.’
It was twenty minutes before the reply came through.
Mycroft ignored the implied question. 'Should I send someone round?'
John looked, eager to please. ‘Two waiters on a fag break. Well - one waiter, one supervisor of some sort, different jacket.’
‘Oh. Glass of wine?’ John said, something to say while he got his head wrapped round Sherlock propositioning him.
Once Sherlock has looked his fill at the room and the balcony and John has diligently taken notes Sebastian took them back to reception to show them the security footage. A classic locked room in some ways. The film images were taken a minute apart but the paint appeared between two shots. The vandal had come in through the balcony.
, Sherlock could bear to do anything but take him home. Nest, mate, bond.
He reached one hand up to Sherlock's neck, pulling his head down and pressing their lips together. The other hand grabbed Sherlock’s wrist, pressing his hand to the alpha’s groin.
He crossed the terrace, noting they had it to themselves, and placed his glass next to an almost untouched red wine. ‘Thanks. John Watson by the way. How do you know Mike and Molly then?’ John said conversationally. Definitely out of his league but he was going to have a bloody good try, now he was here.
‘ She’s been dead for fourteen years. Technically she was never alive. Rachel was Jennifer Wilson’s stillborn daughter, fourteen years ago.’
‘I heard footsteps.’ Sherlock whispers, violin dangling from one hand like a forgotten toy as he steps aside to let John in, closing the door behind him with a glance on to the landing. He leans back against the pitted wood to look at John.
'How would you like not to have? I have a room.' John met his eyes, surprised and Sherlock blushed a deep crimson. 'I don't normally do this. Which sounds like such a cliche, but I don't.'
He had his hormone levels tested every ten days in the lab at Barts. He spent a lot of time there anyway and he didn't trust anyone except the highly competent if rather silly pathologist Molly Hooper to run the tests.
'Sherlock?' Victor touched his arm. 'My show opens next week, why don't you come along? Both of you.' He produced a card. 'Text me and I'll send you an invite. Don't worry I'll keep quiet.'Victor raised his eyebrows in an expression that Sherlock couldn't, wouldn't, have resisted once upon a time. He nodded slightly as he left Victor looking at the print. As he turned, his eyes unexpectedly met John's as Lestrade led him onto the dance floor.
‘Yeah, he, well had to stop. He got injured, it impedes healing so…’
'Kenneth Wood.' John came to stand behind him a hand  squeezing his shoulder.
'Its not exactly that I don't do...I just haven't, for a very long time...I'm sorry.' He trailed off, kind of worrying that John would politely extricate himself and leave. Possibly to go and find someone who would spread their legs. Except not really because John Watson wasn't that man.
'Ah yes, quite a diverting little matter. I glanced over it. You're doing rather well just missing one thing.'
‘You in that outfit, me peeling you out of it. Have you any idea what those trousers do to your arse? Then the fact you wrestled a serial killer to the ground that night, that got me hot and bothered too.’
'Thanks – good luck with Harry. Bye.'
‘Go where?’ Sherlock shot back, already knowing what he meant.
'So I spoke to Greg this morning. He's got a job for me, could be dangerous.'
‘Sherlock are you okay?’ It was of course, John who saw him go.
Out of his suits Sherlock is a rumpled mess. Pyjama pants hanging low on his hips, the blue silk dressing gown creased as if it’s been slept in. It covers his arms, stops John covertly checking for track marks, though he knows it's pointless. If he wants to, the brilliant chemist will find some way of getting whatever poison he chooses into his system.
' You're bleeding. What happened?'
interesting.
?’ That was interesting.
'She never left.' John said joining them, a cut to his forehead had been dressed.
John was fairly sure he caught Sherlock waving to the security camera as he leaned against the bonnet of the Jaguar.
‘I'm prepared. Would you like to know the colour the dimensions of the device I've ordered?’
'They told me the best person to talk to was the desk sargeant. Ritchie she's called. She joined at the same time as one of the internal affairs lot. They're drinking buddies. Thing is I also looked into that reported brothel that Anthea heard about, who was working that sort of thing. She came on shift half an hour after the report was made. Now, her name didn't go against it on the system but there's a good chance she saw something, a printout whatever.'
There was hardly any room in the cupboard and they were pushed close, face to face, in the coffin sized space. From the light that seeped in the edge of the door john could just make out the tieless collar of Sherlock's dress shirt. The buttons too strained for absolute decency. Then there was the mesmerising fug of expensive citrus aftershave. The voices in the break room departed and they let them recede along the corridor for a few moments before they moved.
##########
'The alpha cancelled last minute. I had to...I was alone.'
John made a decisive grab for the phone
. Yet in spite of their reputation for fucking around unbonded alphas could be remarkably persistent when they got attached.
'What about the other alphas on the team?'
' I mean you know my limitations already..' Sherlock began.
Lestrade and John, well-used to Sherlock's self-contained way of working, were sitting on the sofa watching football. Lestrade had brought beer, nicer than the stuff John usually bought for himself, and they were both halfway down a bottle. Every couple of minutes they would shout at something on the screen that Sherlock had no intention of taking the time to understand. In between they had a lively discussion going about the merits of various players. John, who had begged the detective to do all manner of things to him days before, was grinning and laughing with the other alpha. Lestrade looked so in control of who and what he was and Sherlock felt awkward and adolescent by comparison.
John pursed his lips, nodding.‘I know.’
The stale alpha fear smell assaulted his nose along with a faint smell of decay as soon as he got inside the flat and he already knew what he'd find as he broke down the locked bedroom door. Ignoring John's shouts from outside.
Sherlock turned abruptly to see what John had been looking at, the copy of the message he'd shown Soon Lin. He hadn't noticed it before but in tiny neat handwriting there it was -
He was going to enjoy this.
John knew nothing about art at all.He suspected Sherlock didn't allow room in his head for it either but at least his alpha looked the part, all floppy curls.
‘My brother. Sharing the burden of worrying about me. He’ll be offering you a dowry next.’
‘Presumptuous.’ John said, holding his hand out.
The omega appeared in the living room doorway fiddling with his cuffs, left hand twitching for the gun he had no doubt been told he was to leave at home. Dr Watson did scrub up well. The new shirt looked good with a fitted grey suit. Quite a change from the shapeless jumpers that he normally wore.
'I understand the chemistry doctor.' Sherlock almost snapped. The young man blushed and fumbled through the notes.
'I'm glad. My mother will be thrilled.' Sherlock raised a sardonic eyebrow and made to resume the scenting but somehow fell off the couch into an undignified heap.
'So, security?' John said quietly, Sherlock's eyes followed his left hand as it unconsciously patted the weight of his gun.
‘Seven.’ Sherlock said sheepishly.
Sebastian's office was in a commanding corner. There was a tense moment when he introduced John as his friend.
'You on the other hand he adores. Mother will come round when she sees that.' Mycroft looked sharply at his watch, obviously uncomfortable.
‘That's it.’ The alpha breathed, his voice closer now and vastly different from the clipped professional tone from before. ‘It may hurt a little, first time and all.’
'Gone home to change before her shift, it's nearly eight. Any progress?'
A rogue rivulet of cooling dish water ran into John's collar and made him jump, breaking the spell. They drew away simultaneously, Sherlock to his washing up and John to a previously unknown fascination with the cruet set.
''For the last few years, didn't know what I wanted to do when I left school. I'm going to uni in autumn, chemistry. Should have started last year but I deferred.'
'So, you work for Jim ?' John said, making conversation.
‘Honestly,’ John said conspiratorially, ‘I just like scotch. John Watson.’ He held out his hand, they shook firmly.
'You bloody know its Greg and why are you bothering me with this when they're about to put out cake.' Greg had a world weary look about him but it said something, something impressive, about Sherlock that a DI came running at his command.
Sherlock shook his head. ‘Everything makes me sick.’
‘You did?’ Sherlock took his meaning and smiled broadly.
‘Might make me uncomfortable though.’ John pulled at Sherlock’s wrist so he could properly read.
John marshalled the thoughts in his head and opened his mouth to speak. To in fact give a speech, because the way he felt was a monologue, not a simple sentence. At the last second though he paused. He had the sudden feeling that the way he felt, unabridged, may terrify rather than reassure, so he spoke the first thought that popped into his head.
‘One thing.’ John's breath was close to his neck and it felt almost obscene in public after what had passed between them. Sherlock glanced up and down the street but they were all but alone.
More wine was produced and poured, they chatted. Films, holidays, Graeme' s charity work. Nibbling delicately round the edges of the reason they were really here. The two lime and soda drinking alphas stayed observant, barely talking. Regularly wandering off to take phone calls.
He felt caught out. Like he was cheating on John. An absurdity, on several levels. ‘You can’t deny the brilliance.’ He said, sipping his tea, an excuse to look down.
'I shouldn't think they're absorbing at all.'
Sherlock made a show of staring at the photographs for a few seconds more before flopping into his own chair, he knew he hadn't the patience to outlast Mycroft today.
'I should have thought that was obvious, I was restless, I thought being closer to your scent might relax me. That is why you're in my room isn't it?' Sherlock said, tossing his head to swallow the painkillers.
They had sat in bed as he explained his theory about Lestrade's father. About how what was now a door in the alley they had visited had once been a small window. Dismissed as being irrelevant because an adult couldn't get through it. A fourteen year old boy though, one that circumstances had made small and wiry on one hand and angry and scared on the other could do so easily. It was little more than an air vent really for the kitchen behind. The murder weapon likely inconspicuously replaced in the knife rack minutes after the act.
'Well I'm not keeping count.' Sherlock said. 'Anyway we have a flat to break into later.'
'You've cooked.' John rubbed still sleepy eyes.
The door opened at a light tap and Lestrade nodded to a beta bouncer, bulky and watchful, who showed them through a short service corridor and into the club proper, which was, bizarrely, heavily scented with patchouli. Greg had been right, they were both far too old for this place. Though he noted that Greg attracted a few admiring glances from omegas half his age.
Sherlock.’ John said, stony faced. He knew the alpha was well intentioned but sometimes he got lost in the intricacies of the problem, forgot the people.
The moment crumbled and they both turned.Mycroft Holmes leant on his umbrella in the doorway. Holding a file in one hand. His scent and expression impossible to read, no doubt through long practice, though John was sure Mycroft knew exactly what
Sherlock ignored the first question.‘The most dangerous man you’ve ever met, and not my problem right now.’ He flounced out of his seat reaching for his coat. The phone rang with a withheld number right on cue.
The next he knew he was being shaken awake none too gently. 'Sherlock!' He opened his eyes to his brothers irritatingly well-rested face. He wiped away drool with his hand and realised Johns book still rested on his stomach.
' I checked, the doctor is coming to see you once he's dealt with an emergency.' The alpha said, lifting his own tea and pushing the paper cup towards Sherlock.
‘Hmm.’William steepled his fingers. ‘Well, your gaze has lingered on both my hands and mouth. I suspect you’d enjoy some combination of oral and manual. Your nerves probably rule out anal.’ An eyebrow raise. ‘Shall I summon Kate?’ William raised his hand.
is the polite way to put it.’ John smiled before burying his face in Sherlock's chest. ‘Fuck, you smell good.’John moved himself about, throwing his legs over Sherlock's lap back resting in the corner of the luxurious seat. Sherlock brought his hand to rest on John's outer thigh, just above his knee. ‘Now is not the time to go shy on me.’ John said, wantonly opening his legs and dragging Sherlock's hand upwards. He Laughed as Sherlock tensed.
‘I do so hate this business of them being paraded like offerings you see in other houses.’ She said, as if she expected John to be an old hand at brothels and to know what she was talking about.
'And this one is fifteen. But what’s the code?' Sherlock said, trying to hide his impatience.
'One last thing..' The alpha bent over to talk in his ear.
John it quickly became clear was tactile. His hands came to Sherlock's waist as when they had danced. This time though they didnt stay still. They roved up over his ribs, his chest, threaded through his hair. He did his best to respond in kind but he felt clumsy by comparison.
He wasn't quite sure what made him look at the young man, a beta by his size, there was something off. He was reading an A to Z and carrying a Union Jack carrier bag but he had tucked himself into the corner of the carriage with an economy that suggested he used the tube regularly and he knew exactly when to move to get off first at his stop. He wasn't a tourist, just wanted to
'John is something wrong?' Sherlock shifted in his seat. John realised his arm had wrapped around Sherlock's leg and his fingers were digging into the flesh.
‘We texted, they called back.’ John replied.
‘My phone -
‘I don't even know how you thought to check the shears.’ Lestrade said, shaking his head in awe.
‘Sherlock Holmes - genius, in the flesh. That website of yours: your fan told me about it.’
‘Hot, hot and
#################
His hand which had been resting  on a wiry bicep was very deliberately lifted and placed on Sherlock’s velvet clad thigh.
‘Two trips around the world this month. You didn’t ask his secretary, you said that just to irritate him. How did you know?’ John said as they walked towards the cab rank.
'Now, ask me about the case.' Sherlock said, shuffling himself up the bed. They neatly avoided any further mention of heat or related subjects for the next ten minutes. Sherlock describing the murder in great detail, obviously unimpressed by the whole business. John, happy the awkwardness seemed to have gone, flicked through one of the journals he had brought, looking for a relevant bit on fall injuries he had read. When he looked up the detective had dosed off, his mouth slightly open, his face softened by sleep. John instinctively adjusted his pillows and blankets as best he could without waking him.
John could see Sherlock's patience, never his best quality, was fraying a little more with each minute they didn't find something.
'No, if she's still alive she's being held. If I could just work out this code...'
A hand stroked luxuriantly down his ,back, round the curve of his arse and finally through the wetness at his entrance .
'Bushes with Stanley knives? This one looks like it needs stitches.' John had gone into medical mode, heat almost forgotten, as he gently prodded around a nasty gash on Sherlock's forearm.
John could feel the alphas cock firming against him through layers of fabric and he was about to complain about being the only one naked when he had the sudden urge to have Sherlock in his mouth. He gently pushed the alpha away, smiling reassuringly when he looked rejected. He shifted, pulling Sherlock with him until the alpha was sitting on the edge of the bed. John sank down between his legs pulling a pillow with him because, though he may have felt like a teenager, his knees didn't. He hadn't done this in a long while. Recently he'd only sought out alphas for his heat and a heat demanded penetration and lots of it, no time to get fancy.
'Dr Watson?' The voice penetrated the fog of sleep.
I believe. Tell me, do you have to come in early or do you do the deed during your shift?' Sherlock turned to look mildly at one of the waiters. He stood red faced while the other one looked at him with disgust.
Sherlock struggled to keep a straight face even more. It was only days after they'd met that he realised he'd given the alpha his home address. Normally he was so careful to be anonymous.
By the time Greg got up a little after eight Sherlock had been up and dressed for two hours. He'd already phoned the hospital. John was sleeping his temperature apparently suggesting he was past the worst. At the nurses suggestion Sherlock left Mrs Hudson's number as someone who could sit with John once the heat was over but before he was recovered enough to come home.
Sherlock was amusingly flustered as he climbed out of the car at their door, carrying his jacket awkwardly in front of him. John was left to tip the driver, and gave more than he had planned to when he imagined he saw the hint of a smirk.
He could hear John outside shouting, angry.
. He had pressed the sheet of paper to his face unconsciously and had to pull it away sharply when the technician stepped into the bathroom.
‘John and yes, obviously I want to... I’m open to suggestions. If you..I mean is that part of the service or do you need specific instructions?’ John was aware he sounded like the rookie he was but didn’t care.
‘You work there then, you're a doctor?’ John replied.
'I've got one right here, sending it through now.' He grinned at Sherlock as he sent the photo.
The alpha paused, looking at the floor. ‘If you're sure.’ Sherlock waited on him to look up and nodded emphatically. Dropping the sheet and moving back to sit on the edge of his bed. John chewed his lip, looking at him.
'You heard me. You know what I think? It went one of two ways. Either you never had an alpha arranged at all or you cancelled the alpha last minute.'
'A reference to our dead sculptor.' Sherlock sighed.
‘I'll leave it with you.’ Was all he said as he left Sherlock staring at the card.
'Hardly, at least not in our circumstances. What I mean is, the whole point of us sleeping beside each other is to give you a soft landing from the suppressant. Not to get you all hot and bothered.' John cringed at his own poor choice of words.
'From what?' John said, defensive in his own way. 'I've no shifts this week so far and I met Mike Stamford for a pint this afternoon. My dance card is pretty empty apart from a physio appointment on Thursday.'
So it was that the three of them were travelling home in the unaccustomed luxury of one if Mycroft's cars. Cream leather interior and one of those electric screens between them and the driver. Molly napping between them, as the detective explained the paint flakes.
‘Better. I'm ready now for..well.’ Sherlock wasn't normally shy of asking for what he needed but in his own living room with someone who'd made him toast it was
...'Sherlock snapped in frustration. If he could only be left alone with his work perhaps. ..
‘Sherlock you’re wearing -Is it for work? John asked, confused, maybe hoping a little.
‘Bigger?’ John volunteered.
‘Yeah of course. Shall we?’ John nodded to the paperwork. They signed and stood up to go.
‘Of course I do. I said I'd help with your heat. This is your heat too. Did you think I'd just turn up for the fun bit?’
A possible pregnancy. Sherlock wondered if it had been deliberate or an accident. Then, out of nowhere, he wondered how John would look pregnant, how he would feel about that. The thought was intrusive but what struck him in that moment was how little anxiety it gave him.
‘Still though.’
'I bet he's absolutely wild isn't he. I like them with a bit of fight.' He addressed Sherlock who made to fly at him but John held out a warning hand.
'This is the alley, outside the brothel, you remember Sherlock? Where Lopez died.' Greg pointed at the screen where several figures moved about. One overseeing, directing with a pointed finger, the others moving briskly. The one supervising was Melissa Graeme. 'This is the day before we went there, after the ID.'
'Perhaps they read your blog.' Sherlock hoisted himself to his feet with the crutches, a movement that over the last few days he had somehow made fluid and elegant.
‘Don't you bloody dare.’ John moaned breathlessly, rolling his hips up to meet the alpha. Definitely not much refractory period. The rough tone of command in his voice
'How do you come to need a fiance?'
'Ideal, your pheromones should be mostly calming. All I'm suggesting is you take him home sit with him. Maybe sleep in the same room.' In John's exhausted state Dr Sloan seemed irritatingly cool.
The scent of anxious alpha grated on Sherlock's already taut nerves as Mrs Hudson showed Raz into the flat.
John, still sprawled on his back, laughed.
'The alpha cancelled, unavoidable-a funeral. The package, what do you deduce? An omega, alone during a heat.. . Shall I go on?'
The sharpness of the tone pulled John out of his own thoughts.
…His brain traitorously supplied.
the alpha explained as he handled the pots and Sherlock couldn't help thinking that his own body was a bit like that, that it was something the cold logic of his brain and his insatiable reproductive system had in common.
'We don't. I need to try and keep this arms length, besides - you know what happened last time.'
‘No – you misunderstand me. I- this has been so
Sherlock began to move too but then hesitated. ‘John we did discuss my inexperience. It’s not that I’m averse to you inside… but I don’t know that..’He broke off pressing his knees together.
Lestrade's nerves were obvious to Sherlock in the way he stood as he waited by the window while John got ready. Slightly hunched but never quite still. Given he was going to meet a known criminal with the implicit understanding he was willing to be bribed it could actually work in his favour.
‘Do you trust Sally?’ Sherlock said, serious.
Joe turned, face flushed and sweating. 'Came on suddenly. First time in ages I've had no warning.' He looked apologetic. John crouched beside him, lifting his wrist and taking his speeding pulse.
'Anthea? I need a favour- from both of you- he once told me he could procure an invite to anything. This shouldn't be too much of a challenge. I will of course need an appropriate plus one.'
‘I didn't mean…’ Sherlock sounded genuinely appalled. He had doubtless been oblivious to the effect he was having. He had, after all, been suppressed until a few weeks ago.
John, in a routine that was becoming automatic, pulled the client chair into position and picked up his notebook.
'I'm sorry.' Sherlock said, wondering if the catch all response to something sad was appropriate, John would have known what to say. 'How long have you known?'
'Burglary,' Sherlock said smoothly, 'I should have thought that was obvious.'
‘But how?’ Lestrade looked typically puzzled.
##########
'Can we move..? Sherlock began, as he held John carefully. Fingers spread across his back as if he had been handed something of great value. 'Only if you want to - it's just because...' Sherlock stopped and glanced down at his injury.
##########
'Over beside him. John gestured with the gun, breath erratic, to where the injured alpha had crumpled on the floor. The smirk continued as he moved.
'Getting what you came for?' John asked.
'It's only sentencing. Greg says it can often be disappointing anyway. If you feel they're getting less time than they should. After what we know she's done...'
##########
He gently opened Sherlock's bedroom door. The alpha was wrapped in the blanket John had borrowed the night before, gently snoring. He decided, given how he'd woken up this morning, to go to his own bed for a change. He climbed the stairs to his neglected room, stripping to his underwear before crawling gratefully under the duvet.
‘Chance would be a fine thing, can hardly afford this round at the moment.’ John replied.
'Possibly.' Sherlock made a vague gesture. 'Not now though.'
‘My dad was self-made, came from nothing so…’
'Maybe they just store recycling here.' Lestrade was losing patience with him, wondering where he was going with this.
Sherlock took a sip of his wine and looked at John stonily fro a moment before a corner of his mouth turned up, apparently against his will. ‘It's not as bad as it sounds. I'm a detective. Consulting detective, the police come to me when they're out of their depth.'
‘You know, I might just have a nice wank thinking about that one day-probably several days.’ Sherlock gave John a mock scandalised look before the alpha continued. ‘I might just think about you doing the same.’
'I'm being watched-we are being watched.' He gestured at the bed. John looked intently and he felt a pang, a mix of anger and sadness when the alpha picked up the picture from the clinic.
'How may of these rooms are there in the hotel?' He asked scrolling through the page.
'Hey.' John stilled his shaky hands kissing the backs of both sets of fingers in turn. 'Don't look so scared. We can go back downstairs if you like.'
'Sort of, I erm- I have erratic heats.' The younger omega turned and walked away a few paces, fidgeting with a hanging coil of cable .
Humiliation crawls over John's skin even as he starts to respond to Sherlock’s proximity, the familiar, expensive scent of him, the angles of his body. The detective leans down to kiss him with a tenderness he doesn't deserve and John gratefully runs his hands over warm cotton and silk, reaching up to rub along the nape of his neck and for a few seconds it feels like something else. Like that first promising kiss after a date, like this is a seduction, like it’s going somewhere.
'Sort of.' He confessed.
'Oh I think you might be interested in this. It ties into the little matter Lestrade gave you, though obviously Scotland Yard can't be trusted with all the details. Dr Watson I believe did have the necessary clearance. He's discharged of course but I think we can stretch a point in the circumstances.'
‘That wasn’t just me.’ John replied, then he was suddenly serious. ‘Look Sherlock I …’ He felt John move towards him, hesitant for an instant before…
He was aware he ranted a bit as he tried to pull the last fragments together...
They ate, Lestrade obviously as hungry as him, and they were soon left with empty foil containers. Sherlock binned the rubbish and dumped the plates in the sink. Taking a deep breath before he turned to face Lestrade. He would have preferred John here for this conversation, he'd been putting it off, but he would have to make do.
'Let him go.' John said, voice firm, in command.
Sherlock laughed at the unintentional innuendo.
‘Alphas usually do - I mean, that's all I expect of them.’ Sherlock corrected himself halfway through the sentence.
‘Not that we could tell. He was, well, Sally had to wait for them to finish, put it like that.’ Lestrade replied. ‘What are you thinking?’
John was regretting taking this shift now. He'd felt obliged because he'd been otherwise occupied so much recently and frankly he was a bit broke. He'd came straight off the train from Harry's. All he could think of if he dared to let his mind drift was Sherlock's scent and the way their limbs had tangled so naturally together.
Lestrade laughed. ‘When John goes into heat you'll have better things to do.’
###############
Sherlock smiled, beginning to relax again.
‘End of Baker Street, there’s a good Chinese stays open till two. You can always tell a good Chinese by examining the bottom third of the door handle.’ He owed John at least one meal. Though the Chinese didn't let him pay either.
Sherlock crouched and examined the face more closely.
He had realised very quickly that the squiggle wasn't just random damage. It was too precise, it
Some alphas certainly would almost fight below you to take control back. John Watson though was the picture of submission. Mouth slightly open, hands resting lightly against Sherlock’s skin as the omega used him.
' It's fine John don't fuss, a clean bill of health.' Sherlock said breezily.
the British government. That gun is semiautomatic. In here it will ricochet, it could hit anyone, it might hit you. She made you choose didn't she Zhu Zhi? A long time ago. By the time Soo Lin came to you it was too late.' Sherlock could see John itching to turn and look at him, he played for time. Dimmock or more likely Anthea was bound to turn up soon.
John laughed, the sensation almost too much in his over sensitised state. 'Told you. I can almost feel it now.' He pulled their linked hands back against his belly.
‘Alright, understood.’ John kept his touch light for a few seconds, feathering kisses up Sherlock's spine before he slid one finger inside him. ‘You're going to feel so good.’ John murmured, before adding a second finger.
'Like you would expect, pissed off he's not involved. He seemed to get a bit protective as well.' John had hated himself a little for being pleased that he had this effect on his flatmate.
'As you probably worked out that's what I think too.'
'Who are they?' Sherlock said, hoping that she might have a little more insight about why an ancient Chinese syndicate was branching into the west.
‘I’ve known for what feels like a long time that I wanted you here somehow. I obviously didn’t know I wanted you like this, I scarcely knew how to want you like this. I know you’re probably looking for something more dramatic, a grand gesture…’ John cut him off.
'I'm sorry.' Sherlock said, drawing up onto his knees to be at Johns eye level.
'That's where it's a bit awkward. I need you to pretend to be my fiance. There's no male omegas in my division that we can be certain he's not seen. I could get an officer from another area but I'd rather have someone I know, who I'm confident can handle themselves If it gets rough. Not that it's likely to but you never know.'
‘I believe you thousands wouldn’t.’ John said as Sherlock squirted some into his outstretched hand. ‘Will you be joining me?’ The velvet hid nothing and if that wasn’t telling enough Sherlock’s cheeks were stained pink, his pupils wide. John patted the blanket beside him. So much for a first date- but then didn’t some of the best first dates he could remember finish like this? Well, a bit like this anyway-it was Sherlock Holmes after all.
A guest, a guest that hadn't bothered with a tie and who could blame him, with that neck. John had then watched him loiter on the edges the whole tedious time they waited on the photos to be taken, there was no sign of a plus one.
The speaker was lounging on a purple chair. He had something of a piratical, maybe new romantic, thing going on. Long legs were encased in midnight blue velvet and a slim but strong looking torso was covered with a white frilled shirt ,a good few buttons undone. Then there was the face, strikingly angular with full lips and pale aquamarine eyes which had been lined in a midnight blue to match the trousers.
‘Well, I knew you’d find the case. I’m not stupid.’ Lestrade said, crossing his legs and relaxing into the chair.
'By who? Its clearly one if the most significant...' Sherlock glanced back through to Mycroft in the office who raised his eyebrows disapprovingly at his outburst. 'Is this your first multiple murder enquiry?' He continued more calmly.
'I didn't like the way he was looking at you.' John sighed, sliding across the car seat and picking up a slim hand, kissing the backs of the fingers.
‘No, the way she's sitting the way she glances round there's someone behind her.’
'OK, see you then.'
Sherlock took a moment with his eyes closed, feigning disinterest, but really inhaling John's post heat scent. It made him want to sleep and not, he was alarmed to realise, alone. ‘Yes, of course. Can I borrow your phone?’
'It'll all work out you know. There's more to life than being shot at. Another round?'
He wandered towards the bar, the area was slightly elevated and he could see the whole party. He found Anthea, still talking animatedly. She was a natural, but then she would be. He couldn't see Mycroft Holmes wasting his time with anyone sub-par.
‘How is it going?’ John said as he walked in. The alpha had obviously had a hard shift at the surgery. It was written in his wrinkled clothes and askew hair (pulled by a vomiting two year old) but he still sounded convincingly enthusiastic,it must be exhausting.
'What's this address?'
When he returned John had rolled onto his belly and was stretched across the bed. Sherlock took a few moments to watch him, paying particular attention to the exit wound scar.
He avoided John's gaze.
Also, I think I'm making up some bits of omegaverse biology but since it's all made up I hope that's ok.
Sherlock had the immediate sense there was little to find as soon as they got inside. Two pieces of worked oak were mounted on stands, paper plans pinned to the wall behind annotated in several colours. The tools were neat, everything put away apart from a couple of chisels, a pen and blank notepad. A half full paper cup of coffee (from the attached shop), sat to one side, mould beginning to bloom on its surface.
There was a full moon and the scene was cast in a bluish hue. The glaring lights forensics worked with not yet set up.
Molly nodded. 'That's what his records say. The dentition is clearly alpha. We'll look into it of course. Get an expert in for a mould, run it against records but all that takes time. Once I've done the post mortem I'll know more.' she gestured vaguely in the direction of the still covered groin area. She could be surprisingly awkward about such things for a pathologist. ' Late presentation is a possibility.'
'Nothing,I happened to be at a loose end, these affairs of state, less absorbing than you'd think.'
'Now that is something.' Sherlock made a beeline for a sleek car in racing green towards the back of the yard.
'I meant to give this to Greg. Address where they run things from apparently.' Sherlock took the slightly dog-eared card from his hand.
'We're leaving now.' You're going to let us go.' John was dead calm the only trace of nerves a quick lick of his lips as they backed from the room. Sirens were approaching as the ran down the stairs and out the way they came in. Jogging round an alley to the side where they could watch the police approach, leaning against the wall to get their breath.
Greg was nodding thoughtfully as Mrs Hudson showed Anthea in.
'Sherlock Holmes can stand to be in a room with three people for more than five minutes. Me, you and Mrs Hudson and I don't think me and Mrs H are his type.' Greg finished.
‘Private detective?’ John said, imagining him trailing adulterous husbands and wives. ‘The police don't consult amateurs.’
?’ Sherlock looked furious.
Another close call.
It was pulled away with force.
'May I?' He took John's tie in his hands and the doctor nodded. He slowly slid it from his neck followed by his jacket and started on the buttons of his shirt. Both of them so silent he could just hear the music still going on below. Hw slid the shirt from John's shoulders and looked at the distorted and discolored flesh, acknowledging that yes, it was a bit sexy.
‘Well, for the duration of this call me John ok? No sir or doctor.’ Matt nodded.
A glance passed between them and Sherlock shuffled closer. It should have been awkward, Sherlock was much taller than him and all leg in an adorably coltish way but it was perfect.
'Won't it hurt.?' Sherlock said quietly.
Sherlock and John moved out of the way, backing against a wall as the police went through final checks and lined up to move in. As they watched the police go in on the blurry camera feed Sherlock found that they were holding hands though he didn't know how it had happened.
'We could have waited till we got home you know.' John said, convincing no one as he stretched indolently. He'd loved it.
He remembered how they had talked, shyly at first, of how they would spend their first heat together (Victor always spoke of it as 'our heat'). Victor had planned to stay on suppressants till the end of exams but after a few days at his father's house they planned to go to Scotland and let nature take its course. Victor had the idea of spending the time in cosy isolation at his aunt's lochside holiday cottage. After that (and Victor had dropped huge hints they'd be bonded by then) they were going to do a little tour of the Highlands finishing in Glasgow, indulging Victors fascination for both the scenery and all things Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Of course it had never got that far Sherlock had said the wrong thing, been the wrong thing, and drove Victor away.
'Yeah well he didn't put it straight forward of course. The idea is I'll be a consultant on security, full time once I retire but internal affairs are fairly certain it amounts to the same thing.'

He started to put a few back into the crates, just to clear the sofa. As he tossed in a copy of '
‘Colleague.’ John had corrected his deliberate ambiguity with an eyebrow raise and a firm handshake while Sherlock noticed a flurry of things. ways to make Sebastian notice how smart he was. How well he was doing at this.
Today though was not that day. He was methodically packing a bag to go and spend this heat as he had the last. With Lieutenant Billy Scott, an unbonded alpha he knew from his last tour. A younger man, who had no interest in bonding until his career was established and was more than keen to help John out with his heats. It was a good arrangement, they spent a few days in his flat shagging like rabbits and then parted with a hug. It was simple, honest. It wasn't what he wanted to do forever but for now it did him very well thank you very much.
John just smiled at him but the alpha was deadly serious. Hand extended formally like he was in a regency costume drama. He settled into Sherlock's arms and the alpha led elegantly as they drifted round the room.
The detective sighed as if the whole topic bored him. 'I get erections occasionally if that's what you mean.'
'He can handle this now, more effective than he looks actually. Don't tell him I said that.' Sherlock said, stepping back out of the room.
‘Yes, must have been, through that window.’ John replied looking up at the building.
‘I can't promise I'll stop asking.’ John stepped nearly in front of him to open the cab door, holding it open as a flustered Sherlock stepped inside.
‘You think they're wrong?’ John said.
‘Are you ready?’ John breathed, kneading his hips. He had a sarcastic response, something about a written invitation probably, on the tip of his tongue but somehow a murmured
He became aware of something else, scent. Smoky, slightly bitter but not unpleasant. Shades of the Campari his mother enjoyed.
for that.’ Sherlock spits the words. Words that should be tender, passionate sounding like a curse.
‘If it was me-I'd definitely be getting a little panicky now, it’s like you’re being stalked.’ Molly looked at him with the wide eyed infatuation he’d become used to.
'I should and you are but I'd rather know what you're up to. Make sure you're inside the tent pissing out kind of thing.'
I hope no one is too offended by the change of ending here.
The alpha showed them Soo Lin's fragile ancient teapots, obviously in love with what he couldn't have.
A primitive rhythm that he would have thought brutal but for the way John arched into the contact, swearing breathlessly as he bared his neck for the bite. Sherlock realised that this would be over very quickly, too quickly perhaps, when he felt the extra resistance of his swelling knot.
As usual Sherlock's learning process was lightning. As he began to move he must have noticed how John was trying to shift around to get a particular friction. Sherlock, with typical efficiency, realised this could be done more easily and he gently moved John's legs and supported his hips till the omega's gasps seemed to satisfy him he'd got it right.
'The tattoo isn't all they gave you is it?' Sherlock tapped a spot on his own neck.
Sherlock showed him round the house, keeping up a steady stream of anecdotes most of which seemed to concern some disgusting experiment or humiliating Mycroft, sometimes both.
That was when he overbalanced. The hand he put out to steady himself meeting yielding polythene rather than the solid wall he'd expected. He fell inelegantly through the hole, feet scrabbling for solid ground that was too far away. His leg was a sudden mass of agony, the crunch of bone breaking reverberating through him as the rest of his body flopped heavily to the ground.
‘Either way I'll be pissing off a gangster.’
‘You have absolutely no idea what just went on in there do you?’ John said as Sherlock hurried him out of the gallery.
John thought.
'Will do. He's been looking at some old stuff for me anyway.' Greg said. John, with a pang of sympathy for his friend, remembered this morning and the old case. Certainly put Harry into perspective.
‘Very nice.’ John said looking into Sherlock’s lap. ‘Don’t want to chafe though.’ John reached across him for the lube with his clean hand and squeezed some into Sherlock’s waiting palm.
‘Yes, and he’s probably also disaffected with the whole business if he’s developed - an attachment.’
Outside the alpha stalked along beside him, the pheromonal response Sebastian had stirred still hovering like a mist around them.
She absently picked at the packet of digestives they'd been eating and John went to make her tea without thinking.
'Can I ask what you are to each other?' She smiled pleasantly, professionally.
'He's an intensely private man John. Lives inside his own head, perhaps he just wanted the space to deal with things in there.'
He came back after a couple of minutes looking pale.
Sherlock propositioning him.
'Yours ran a drug cartel Mrs Hudson, hardly conducive to a healthy lifestyle.' Sherlock retorted.
John turned and reached for him, he actually looked surprisingly uncertain for someone coming on so strong. 'Are you sure you're up to this?' He said, fingers digging into Sherlock's shoulders.
He redressed behind the curtain while Dr Sawyer spoke to him, writing up her notes. ‘No problems I can see and you should get the results back in ten days.’
Raz led them to a streak of the same paint. Buried in a mass of other grafitti on the concrete wall of a skate park. They split up to look for more.
‘So, another case cracked. How very public spirited ... though that’s never really your motivation, is it? I’m
‘Well, it's the weirdest situation I've seen blood pressure taken in and that's saying something. Not relevant to the detective work though, is it?’
'I wouldn’t worry about that, we're expected you see.'
‘Yes, that’s to say no-not now.’ He turned away from them, knowing they were exchanging glances. ‘I need to go home. I need to go back over everything.’
'So,' John broke in. 'How are you feeling anyway?'
‘I simply observed.’ Sherlock retorted. Frankly, he hadn't even had to do that with Sebastian. When he'd been shagging (which was often in his uni days) he generally told everyone who would listen.
‘Wait.’ Sherlock said hurriedly swallowing a mouthful. ‘You said you always do this the same way, different omega, hotel?’
He tapped out the text, trying to school his face into disinterest so Molly wouldn't comment. The beta pathologist had ridiculous, ill-informed romantic notions about heat and bonding.
Well, that wasn't quite true.
Sherlock produced a key card and let them into a corridor marked staff only. It was quiet at this time of day,apparently some sort of storage space for the chambermaids. There was a smell of laundry detergent and piles of linen and towels lined the shelved walls.
'When you say barely a thing?..' Sherlock probed.
'Well I'd rather he dealt with them out here in this flat. The real world'
The next few minutes were a blur. The cab wasn't the murderer. Apparently just an American tourist being taken advantage of by a cabbie. It took a chase round Soho to find that out though. Then the use of a stolen warrant card (Lestrade really should be more careful) to get away from the bemused tourist. Then they had to run away from real police (who could be sensitive about that sort of thing).
‘Yes, we do. I have his address.’ Sherlock is grateful that John has decided to drop it for now. He had no shame or embarrassment about how he manages his heats but now is about the work and it says something that John understands that.
‘I’m glad you could make it over. We’ve had a break-in.’ He showed them through the busy trading floor,which stank of alpha, pto another office.
It had been the first proper go she’d had at staying sober. The snow had helped in a funny way, keeping her away from temptation. She’d lasted into the new year but fell off the wagon again, spectacularly, in early February. Clara had stayed on the phone with him for an hour that day.
'Just checking the layout. Leads back to the ballroom apparently, we're going the right way.'
John was obviously a highly competent doctor, a little sentimental perhaps at ‘a woman lying dead’ as he had put it, but nearly everyone was. The revelation had been how much Sherlock liked his presence. How much it helped his process. His phone buzzed where it rested on his chest. He was disappointed it wasn't a reply from John.
John walked in off the street with a forced confident stride. A faint aroma of beeswax polish hung in the air as he entered a lobby with an old fashioned coat stand. An elderly doorman showed him into a sort of reception room.
‘I'm a consulting detective, the only one in the world.’ The alpha drew a breath to speak but Sherlock neatly cut him off, handing the phone back.
‘So you went abroad put him behind you?’ John said, it sounded more like an accusation than he had planned but Victor only shrugged.
‘Yeah, but come on …You?’
'Its bloody terrible Sherl.' Victor looked at the picture then glanced at him, amused. 'There's still never a dull moment is there? I assume you're working on a case.'
He found himself bold again. 'Hardly I only realised I was coming yesterday. This was what they had left. It's rather wasted on me-well it was.' He walked towards John and stooped a little to kiss him again. Before they'd been in a cupboard and there wasn't much room to really get into it. Now they had time, space, privacy it was so much more.
‘I was referring John to your heat starting. You seem excessively warm, you're in shirtsleeves while everyone else is still wearing a jacket , you…’ Sherlock paused, realising perhaps now was not the time or place for a stream of deductions. ‘I can
Sherlock chose that moment to go after the other little thing he'd noticed at the shop. Paying their bill quickly they crossed back over the road to the yellow pages propped outside the entrance to an upstairs flat, soggy, though it hadn't rained in days. The recent neat script of an name label above the door bell.
'What are you doing up?' John shuffled into a sitting position, squinting.
Scented and dressed a few minutes later he crossed the room to squeeze Sherlock's hand briefly. Sherlock leaned forward lips brushing his ear. 'Be safe.'
‘No idea.’ Sherlock replied, cheerfully. He had a tricky problem and someone tolerable to talk to. That was enough.
Mycroft when he arrived wasn't wearing a tie either but while John had decided he looked passable and Sherlock looked fabulous as ever Mycroft looked like he'd been started by a fire alarm. Anthea on the other hand looked lovely. All the hard edges of working week softened away by a pretty floral dress and a messy bun.
' I've probably got about four weeks left. I was thinking you could help me out with the next one. I know it seems funny to talk about it with Harry and everything but I need to be practical. I can't go back on suppressants now until I'm through another cycle.'
They reached the room door and he fumbled with his key card. Almost dropping it.
It had been a pricey room, more of a suite really. The huge bed was piled high with creamy soft linen, and there was a plush seating area round a fireplace. A bay window looked out across the grounds. Romantic he knew some people would say. Something he would have scoffed at. Not so much now though, with John.
'I'm not an invalid.' John said, his body seeming to mock his stoicism as he felt himself wobble and his head begin to spin. He came to sit on Sherlock's duvet and was immediately enveloped in the scent he craved.
‘You have done it like that before though, just met someone and you know-clicked?’
John shook off the post-heat urge to sleep and tried to think if there was anything else he could usefully take to the detective in hospital. He gathered a couple of issues of a forensics journal and a cold case file Lestrade had given Sherlock before going downstairs.
'How can you be around me and not be...you know.' John ran his eyes down Sherlock's body but there was no sign of arousal.
'Shh, don't say anything-it's all fine.'
‘You want me to?...Here?’ John said.
'Its alright, give yourself a minute.' John smirked, Sherlock looked wrecked. 'It won't take much.' He leaned in towards the alphas ear. 'I was halfway there just from the feeling of you in my mouth.'
When they made their way back to the main stairs Greg was waiting for him at the bottom, chatting with Richard.
, it just was.
‘Well they’d have been hard pushed. That was the really bad winter. Nothing moved for weeks at the beginning of the month, then of the course the building trade takes a full two weeks at Christmas, sometimes more.’
‘I may be able to help him with that.’ I'm texting him a number, he should mention my name.’ Sherlock said, rapidly tapping his phone. Mycroft, he knew, would help with this. ‘Give him some time.’
'I only ever see the postcodes. The men who attacked you, they're the ones who know actual names. Jim's a wholesaler these days but he still prefers old fashioned. Won't put anything on a hard drive.
He remembered their conversation about how John used to do this a lot and he wondered if all the others had seen this flash of vulnerability, if it had even been on display. He took a deep breath squeezing the hand before releasing it to start undressing himself, starting with his shirt buttons. No hint of tease. John at this moment needed to be wanted.
‘Can I borrow your phone?’ He said to the alpha. His was flat,charging electronics having been the last thing on his mind over the past few days.
'These are numbers.The line across the man’s eyes – it’s the Chinese number one.' She pointed.
‘What's that?’ Sherlock asked, his interest piqued by his brothers growing embarrassment.
‘Could just be billed to the wrong month.’ Harry shrugged, breaking a piece of shortbread. John though knew the look, Sherlock had something.
John handed him a blanket that was draped over the headboard. ‘That's the only thing about doing it this way, I can't keep you warm after.’ Sherlock threw the blanket round his shoulders. John picking up his hands again as soon as he had done so, squeezing.
‘I think I'm starting to get this now, I think it'll be Ok.’ Matt said softly as he pulled John closer.
'Just finished, early hours of this morning.'
' John, thought you'd be gone. You didn't miss much, barely a three.'
' Something similar gets used in the prison service, a last resort for very violent alphas. They keep it quiet for obvious reasons. The stuff he's been taking is probably a bit more refined but we have to assume he'll still get some of the side effects.'
'Better, still tender.' Sherlock said, retying his dressing gown. John's heat had lasted two days. Once the hormones had died down Sherlock's knot was red raw. It was, John knew, common enough a problem in new bonds. Both still randy after the heat they'd worked round it. Sherlock was more than generous with his mouth and the alpha managed to get a little relief himself with the aid of sensitive lube. Though penetration was out of the question.
'I'm sure it would. Or perhaps...' Sherlock reached across and slid his fingers between John's thighs and under his balls, behind his perineum. John's face lit up in a grin.
Getting through the flats security door was straightforward enough, though John sniggered at the dizzy omega routine he put on with one of Van Coons neighbours and was impressed but alarmed with his athleticism at dropping on to Van Coons balcony from above. The glass door was unlocked.
‘You need to tone it down Sherlock.’ John said, searching the cupboards for mugs.
'I'll just be at the bar.' He smiled politely as he moved away, getting evil looks in return. He crossed the ballroom, now dimly lit by fairy lights, candles and the colourful glow of the dance floor.
'You know this mark? Every foot soldier bears the mark-everyone who hauls for them.' she said, a deep tiredness seeping into her voice.
‘You just happened to have them?’ John smiled, they were very different from his usual sober if sexy suits.
‘According to this it was Melissa’s mothers council house.’ Lucy said. Maybe they'll, I don't know, go there after the party if that's where the DI is.’ Sally had came to stand behind her again. They were all now crowded around the screen. ‘It's a few miles away.’ Lucy was now looking at online directions.
He could get Sherlock off this way-eventually. They had spent an interesting rainy morning a couple of weeks ago doing just that. The intoxicating blend of lust and a surprising intimacy had rendered them incapable of much but lying swaddled in a duvet for the rest of the day.
Buying John 'one decent shirt' as a thank you on the way had been Sherlock's suggestion. The alpha sat on a chair in the corner of the fitting room with coffee that had appeared from nowhere while John tried on a succession of shirts. The two omega assistants left the room with sidelong glances at Sherlock, exploding into giggles as they passed out of sight. John glanced at one price tag, a shirt in a similar shade of purple to one of Sherlock's, and nearly dropped the thing.
' It's just I'd hate to get further into this and then have him go to peices under pressure.'
‘I can’t imagine it’s the healthiest of relationships, given his line of work. The train ticket isn't his, not when he has this’ Sherlock waved a fancy looking car key. ‘A driver's car, he never uses the train.Then there are the receipts, small amounts, food and so on. He has a budget to run the place. If he can afford that car he’s not micromanaging his grocery budget.
The last proper memory he had was of Sally Donovan. Thrusting her warrant card in the face of an ignorant beta triage nurse who insisted he be removed. That A&E was no place for an omega in that condition.
John went about his usual morning routine in the empty flat before finally sitting down to his laptop to deal with the neglected inbox from his blog. He sent polite replies to most of the messages and printed off twenty or so that he thought Sherlock would perhaps deign to glance at. Though realistically he knew he'd be lucky to get one that held the detective's attention for more than ten minutes.
John took his hand, realising they’d rather gone in a circle. ‘What about if I tell you what I was thinking that night?’ He took a mouthful of Chablis and Sherlock did the same. Sherlock nodded and John took his hand and began to draw circles with his thumb on the palm. It was the sort of thing that he’d wanted to do for ages and it was hard to be casual about it. ‘See I’d gone there to get off, no complications. I’d never done it before. I thought it would be…’
The alpha took his other hand as well as they finished, more or less together.
‘You’re not him! That means he’s still…excuse me for a moment.’ William went for his phone and quickly dialled. ‘Keep an eye out it’s not him!’ He shouted into the phone before before tossing it onto the bed and petulantly throwing himself down beside it. Rubbing his hands across his face, smudging his eyeliner.
