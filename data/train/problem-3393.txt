“Alright, Bobby Winchester,” she muttered to herself, “Get up and go to your bike. Come on, don’t be such a baby. Worst case, you die, no biggie.”
He left the crummy motel room and shoved his hands into his pockets against the cold, walking up the street to the store. He’d have to be smart, he didn’t want to run out of cash. He grabbed a basket and sauntered through the aisles. Bread, peanut butter, ramen noodles, Lucky Charms because even if they were too expensive, they were Sammy’s favorite.
She picked at her Spaghetti-o’s, an easy read as she exhibited the same mannerisms as Dean when she was unhappy.
“Yes, they were my first set of orders, to go to Earth and protect a small Egyptian town from the trickery of a pair of demons.  It was difficult only in that I was young and lacking experience”
“Fuck,” she muttered. Sure the punctures had been deep, but she didn’t think she’d lost enough blood to pass out.
She crossed her arms protectively over herself, “My dad killed Ethan’s dad because he was killing people, not because he was a time traveller.”
Cas painfully lifted his arms and let Dean help him out of his shirt. He had a stab wound on his side that pulsed red. If Dean needed any proof after the light show that he wasn’t a human this was it, if he were a kid, this would have killed him.
A screech erupted behind her, so loud it almost knocked her forward. She swung around and the crossbow was knocked from her hands. She dropped as Sarathiel’s claws slashed the air above her, where her throat had been only moments before. She kicked out, hitting Sarathiel’s knee and knocking her back a step.
She sank onto the ground and leaned back against her bike, breathing hard. She looked down at the wounds on her shoulder where the claws had dug in. They were deep and throbbed, and they continued to glow, tendrils of white light like smoke drifting from the punctures. She could feel it leaving her body, and feel cold replacing it.
She had nothing to do but wait. She pressed her nose to the dirt and smelled the frozen loam. It smelled clean. There were at least four of them in that house. They wouldn’t all come out. Thaddeus at least would probably stay inside and guard the boy, Crowley would have to deal with him. But they knew that. Divide and conquer. She hoped Hannah would be first out. At least Bobby had fought ones like Hannah before.
He crossed the street hand headed into the truck stop parking lot. He was gonna do this. It wouldn’t be so bad.
The screen door on the house clattered as it was thrown open and Bobby and Crowley heard something pelting across the gravel that did not sound like a Baby Ray’s clawed feet. Hannah leapt away from them and the others shouted in Enochian. They could hear fighting and rolling in the dirt.
Bleeding and butchering the deer took a long time, even if her butchering wasn’t much more than slicing whatever meat she could off of it. But it was well worth it when she had a fire crackling and venison smelling like heaven itself over it.
“How’s Bobby?” he asked, coming so very close to Cas as he crossed the threshold, closing the door behind him.
Dean didn’t really need to know what he was going to say, obviously a monster, and Cas was definitely not human, asking him not to call his dad should be a red flag. But he ignored it.
“Singer- Singer Garage?” He asked, indignation dripping from his voice, “What the bloody hell are they doing there?”
She shoved another tamale into her mouth and talked with her mouth full, “Alright, then I’m the King of the Bunker.”
Dean carried her to the library and sat down, cradling her in his lap while he decided how he wanted to answer that, “He doesn’t have anywhere else to go.”
It appeared first as a dot against the blue sky, circling slowly overhead, growing larger and larger.
“I know who you were. I remember,” she said, dropping the pan onto the carpet where it splattered messily and wiping her mouth with the back of her hand.
Before she’d gone a block, a shadow crossed overhead and she cut her engine right where she was, taking the time to drop the kickstand only so it wouldn’t clatter. She seized the side bag off the bike and pelted into the nearest building, not bothering her usual sweep for animals. She raced to a back room she could barely see with the light coming through the broken window and closed the door, slamming the lock home. She scrambled for her weapons, holding her sawed off in her hands so tight her knuckles must have been white, listening.
Cas lifted his hand to Dean’s face, and they were mirrored, Dean touching Castie’s cheek and Cas touching his. They stared at each other in mutual, mirrored veneration.
She laid her head against the cool metal of the door when she’d touched the last perfect sigil. She needed to get up. But it was so much easier to stay here, head pressed to the cool metal, even when she could hear the threat scratching at the door. She touched her Wounds and sank deeper into a trancelike state, becoming so still she almost felt unable to move.
Cas could not resist a smile at the gentle and paternal tone Dean’s voice got when Bobby was upset or fussy or tired.
“You can’t really stay right? The other angels, your superiors, they’ll come looking for you, drag you back.”
She shrugged, “I guess we’ll get a better idea if we find more. Now get working, old man, I wanna clear out of here.”
God she was tired. What was the plan here? Best case scenario she’d get another shot at Castiel and gank his ass too, kill the rest of these fucking things and then what? She and Ethan would die as the last people on earth, Crowley would live on and what… where would their souls even go? Crowley the new king of two insolent dead humans? That was grim.
“There, see, that’s using sense. We can just wait them out and enjoy each other’s company,” he said it with odd emphasis, lifting his brow suggestively.
“What are you doing, Dean?” Castiel asked, watching him haul in a military duffel bag and wooden crate from the garage, dropping them on the big table in the war room of the bunker.
“Yes, very lucky,” Cas grimaced, “I get to stay here with…” he looked at Dean for a very long time, “You three.”
Dean stepped close, kissing Bobby’s hair while she was in Cas’ arms, putting all three of them in close, warm proximity.
It was Dean who flinched. He stepped back and tried to smile casually, “Guess I’ll just have to be glad to have you while I got you, man.”
She shrugged at him, not able to negotiate how to go both where she wanted to go and where he did. She’d been so close to him for the last month and he talked
Dean glanced over at Cas, his daughter fighting sleep in their laps and his niece sucking her thumb under his arm. He shrugged a little.
Astor flapped his wings, warming them up before he lifted off from the ground, his companion following him. They landed on the dented roof of a car that had been smashed up next to a wooden light pole not far from Bobby and Crowley. They spoke while they scratched their claws on the pole, sharpening them like blood smeared cats.
It launched itself at her just as she brought the sawed-off to bear, squeezing the trigger and closing her eyes.
“What’s he mean?” Ethan said, looking at the doors as they began to hear the Baby Rays clawing their way through.
Cas straightened his borrowed shirt, taking a moment to smooth Dean’s before they abandoned the bedroom to go check on Bobby. They were walking, entirely convinced it was a nightmare, until a shriek followed by the unmistakable sounds of a fight burst out of Bobby’s open door.
“What’s that gross smell?” Bobby asked, rubbing her little eyes, scooting into the kitchen in her footie pajamas.
“Yeah, yeah, so Ethan gets the same curse as his dad, jumping unpredictably through time. But he goes too far forward, ends up here. His dad could probably figure out what to do, dodge the monsters until he skips outta here. But the kid gets found right away.”
She couldn’t help but glance up at Crowley before returning to her notes on Henry’s spell. She couldn’t do the spell the way Henry had. It required an angel feather, which wasn’t exactly something they could get. Too bad, since it would be a neat escape hatch from their current existence. But the spell also used a sigil painted in blood on the wall.
When it decided to strike it twisted in the air and streaked toward him, lower talons extended, like a great and terrible bird of prey, mangy wings outstretched behind it.
? You’re certainly not a demon. You do realize you would be dead if it weren’t for my generosity. I patched you up. That thing you decided to fight with had your soul split open like a coconut.”
Bobby clambered to her feet, looking up at the two creatures hanging in the sky above her. It was the two she had seen that morning, Astor and Sarathiel.
Cas bit his lip, his hand shot out and took Dean’s, “Dean… if you ever need me… I will hear your prayers.”
A deer slowly ambled into the yard to nibble on the grass and she grinned, looking down the sight of her rifle and waiting for her shot. She might not have had much of a chance to practice shooting in the middle of a real hunt, but years in a Bunker with a shooting range made her good if she had a steady shot.
He screamed and his eyes lit up red, light shining blindingly through the dungeon. Angry, light spiraled up from his wound around Bobby’s arms, shoving itself like tentacles into her chest.
She sat outside in the sun with a pen, sketching her route and enjoying the warmth. It would be a nice drive, she didn’t have to go through the city proper, it was a ways out of town where it still felt really rural, she liked that much better than entering even a city of Sioux Falls’ meager size.
“Yes I- I missed you as well, Dean. Very much,” he added, tone dropping low. Their eyes met over the kitchen table.
She growled in response, but dropped the bookend and slunk across the room without taking her eyes off him. She stopped at the fireplace and sniffed. With quick, sudden movements she snatched a spoon from where he’d left it on the mantle and the handle of the pot on the fire. With her prize, she retreated further away from him, watching him over the pot as she scooped warm beans hungrily into her mouth.
As the movie played Bobby cuddled into Cas’ side and put her head on his arm. Dean looked across her and caught Cas’ eye. He gave him a soft smile.
room! I just wanna go to my room!” She fled, leaving him alone and rushing down the hall to her own room where Ethan was sleeping. She closed his door with a snap before exhaling.
She tilted her head at him, and he looked taken aback for a moment before she answered, “Dean Winchester’s my dad.”
“Who-who are you?” He flexed his fingers around the handle of the knife. He didn’t know what sort of thing messed up the lights and hid in alleys.
“Jeez, Cas,” Dean said, blushing furiously and glancing around the empty parking lot to make sure they were alone.
By the time she got back to the yard she was covered in blood and breathing hard. She dropped it with a dead thump and sat in the grass next to it, putting down her rifle too, catching her breath. If she hadn’t been hungry before, she sure as shit was now.
“Good girl, eat up,” he said, cracking open a beer while she drank her milk. They were quiet for the first few minutes of the meal while they both wolfed down their burgers with matching gusto.
Well, I caved. I have more to write on this one I guess. Next chapter might get a racier. Let me know what you think!!
, in the safe security of the Bunker. She loved the Bunker. Whatever magic or technology had supplied it with water and heat didn’t stop for something as paltry as the apocalypse. She could still start the stove and the
“I am being hunted by heaven, Dean. I have no allies left. I fear that if I leave this Bunker I will not live long.”
The house was musty with disuse as she was accustomed to. She glanced into the living room and found them, their throats torn out and so more than lifeless that it still made her shudder. Three of them. Nothing touched them, no animals or nothing, so they didn’t rot. These ones had been wearing  synthetic fabrics so they looked much like they must have when they died, just dustier and dried up.
Cas touched Dean’s arm, “Perhaps you and Bobby and I can watch the cartoon western that you suggested this afternoon.”
“Yeah, it’s my friggen room, where did you think I was gonna go? Go take a shower, Sam, you smell like ass.”
His stormy expression made her laugh even if her wounds mader her feel like her body was peeling off her bones, “I’ll get him.”
Bobby slowly returned to consciousness, body aching, thrums of pain still lancing from her shoulder. Her head pounded angrily.
“Nothing’s gonna force you out this time, not til we get the angel stuff figured out. Then you can come and go as you please.”
Cas tentatively sat next to him, “I did, I told her about my first battle with the agents of hell when I was barely more than a fledgeling, not yet assigned to a garrison.”
The grocery store had been looted while everything was happening, so the best things were gone and anything fresh was long rotten. They wouldn’t even be able to rely on the canned goods soon. It had been too long.
“No, of course not, is that blood on your jacket?” Sam shoved him off and stood up, “Dean what’s going on?”
The scream was so loud they both wavered, clutching their ears, momentarily disoriented. Crowley recovered first, putting as much buckshot into it as he could. She’d been right, at this distance even he only missed a few shots.
Dean clapped Cas on the shoulder, grinning at him, practically bouncing with glee, “Change of plans, Cas!”
Finally, Crowley returned and sat across from her. She let him move her around as needed to smear a cold poultice on her wounds and wrap them in bandages. It required peeling off her tattered t-shirt but he didn’t make any of the comments she was expecting.
“That would be irresponsible. You are far too young to be involved in a hunt. It would be both physically dangerous and psychologically traumatizing. It is far better for you to remain at home.”
She made it all the way to the little towns outside the city before nightfall, glad for the open skies and beginnings of emptiness, even if she hadn’t gotten to see what she’d come for. She pulled down a long driveway to an acreage and stopped by an outbuilding. She didn’t have time to clear the whole house before sleep, but she did at least take her time sweeping the outbuilding itself, finding nothing more than a family of possums behind a riding mower. It was still warm this time of year up here, she’d be fine. She unclipped her bedroll from the other side of the bike and laid it out on the dusty floor, laying down to rest, fully armed and dressed.
We are Not Ourselves is a title borrowed from a book by Matthew Thomas. Not only is it good, but it has the Supernatural quality of being the best when it accidentally stumbles on a theme, and sort of bad when it tries.
A smile curved Castiel’s lips, “He turned his knife upon me and stabbed me. Fortunately, his paltry weapon could do very little.”
“Sammy!” relief flooded his body when he saw his brother sitting on the motel bed where he’d left him, studying for his dumb history test.
“We discovered a weak point, I did not discover what had created the weakness, but it allowed us to break the walls and pour through and begin the battle in earnest. I lost many soldiers fighting through their ranks. Your father even fought me, when last I reached him.”
Bobby pulled her bike over, liking the look of a big farmhouse outside of city limits for the night. She could do some hunting here and get fresh meat. There would probably even be something in the barn. Empty of living inhabitants though they were, houses full of the soulless dead seemed to prevent wildlife and plants from moving in.
Dean took any excuse to close his math book, grinning at Sam, “What do you wanna eat, Sammy? There’s a grocery store like three blocks away, I’ll get us something.”
She slept hard, harder than she had in years now that she was ensconced in the safety of the Bunker again. She was bleary and sore when she woke up. She pushed herself out of the bed and finally stripped out of her dirty and damaged clothes. She replaced them with clothes from the chest of drawers: A Led Zeppelin t-shirt, her dad’s flannel, jeans of Cas’ she had to cuff. She smiled at herself wearily in the mirror then headed out to face Crowley.
Bobby took off her jacket, even if it was torn and draped it over the boy’s shoulders when he emerged from the underbrush, “We have to move. There’s somewhere safe I can take us. It’s about six hours from here. There’s clothes and stuff for you there. The monsters won’t be able to get in.”
Dean was entirely disarmed, “Oh - Cas -” he laughed nervously, “Enraptured? You've been watching too many Hallmark movies.”
Something touched Bobby’s face, waking her up. Adrenaline spiked through her body and she struck before she consciously decided to, hand curling around the handle of the knife under her pillow and slashing at whatever had gotten in.
Hannah screeched above them and Bobby curled up against the pain in her shoulder and her ears. Hannah leapt from the car and landed beside it. They could see her clawed feet in the dirt. All she would have to do was bend down and it would be over.
Dean shivered and snuggled closer. Cas had already seen him at his worst, why not his weakest too? “You wanna hunt with me?”
Cas hesitated and then reached up, laying his hand on Dean’s shoulder where his handprint still lay, emblazoned on Dean’s flesh and soul forever.
“Bobby was out like a light, you must have done a good job getting her down to bed. Did you tell her stories? Come here, sit down, don’t lurk over me.”
option. Either we take this way out or Castiel breaks in and kills us all. The boy dies here either way - this way at least we get to live.”
“Yeah, he showed me how to change the oil and keep my bike working and I hung out with him while he fixed it up. I got to scratch my initials into it right next to his.”
He’d clearly had a night similar to hers. He’d finally abandoned his ragged outfit and replaced it with one the Men of Letters had tucked away. He was pulling at the collar of the shirt he obviously didn’t like.
Cas now saw through the change in plans, “Is that why you’ve invited them? I thought that you did not wish to involve yourself.”
She nodded, “Yeah, I’m going back up to South Dakota. See what’s going on at Singer Garage. There might have been more there.”
Crowley’s smile was all teeth, “The food alone will be magnificent, can you even remember the taste of fresh food?”
She released Ethan, arms shaking, and began drawing the spell she’d written down from Henry Winchester in her blood on the floor, barely able to form it correctly with the newly acquired magic pulsating in her muscles. She could feel the magic building under her skin, starting to pull her away. The world shimmered. She finished the blood sigil and looked up at Crowley, reaching up and taking his hands to take him with her.
Sam sat down, “Probably more like a vessel. That’s what it was before, but that’s us, and we already knew about all that.”
“The boy is in those trees,” he snapped, “He punched me when I was taking a turn and ran off when I fell.”
“Yeah, that sounds about right. Ok, well if things are good I should go, I’m meeting the dead guy’s sister at a cafe soon. She says she saw something.”
Dean cursed and ran a hand through his hair, “So we’re back at the end of the world again? And you didn’t tell me?”
“Hey, kiddo,” she said softly, forcing herself to her knees beside the youngest child, “I’m sorry. This is all I can do.”
She brought the blade down at Sarathiel again but her arm was seized from behind. Astor had reached her, his claws cutting into her forearm.
She kept her backpack on while they went upstairs. The spellbag was in it, so she couldn’t let it out of her sight. She put a hand on Ethan’s shoulder then released it. Surely Crowley wasn’t a monster in the dark.
Crowley looked meaningfully at Bobby, “Yes, Ethan, we are all going to die and you are going back to Castiel’s squalid little basement to be slowly drained of blood.”
This still promised to be an ok night. Sammy would probably eventually help him do dad’s research and they could watch a movie or something in the background. He’d call in the info tomorrow for his dad to use on the hunt. He didn’t particularly care that he wasn’t going to finish his math homework, his dad would be back in three weeks anyway and they’d be on to a different school.
“She is well, sleeping of course at this hour,” Cas said, “She missed you greatly, but I found it no trouble to care for her. How did your hunt go? Was it successful?”
She rifled through the cupboards, pushing aside fetid flour and brown sugar that was like a rock, pulling out a canister of salt.
“Yeah, yeah here it is. Look familiar?” she turned the journal around and showed Crowley an old photo of a dark haired man, “Ethan Snider.”
Cas was still for a second then his hand came up to hold curl into Dean’s jacket collar and hold him where he was. The lightbulb in the lamp by the table, the tv screen, and the window by the door all shattered at the same time, car alarms going off all down the parking lot.
“An ancient writing from the shores of the Dead Sea tells of those that can be awoken who may help us.”
She walked through the gathering dark to a tree beneath the once-white house. Clover grew here among the grass. She laid the child down and righted her little toddler skirt. She returned  to the barn for the brother, laying the siblings beside each other.
“Ok, ok, ok,” she muttered, slowly, pulling her new, looted weapon close to her, “I can do this. Three shots. Bring ‘em down.”
The dark was deep out there, only broken by a couple of stars. There used to be a streetlight, but it must not have been connected to whatever was magically keeping the lights on inside. She pushed her face harder against the glass in an effort to see a few more stars above the treeline.
Dean focused on the easiest part of that, “You know most angels of the lord would be way worse babysitters than I was when I was twelve.”
Cas did not have to say it, Dean, eyes boring into his own, said it for him, “You. Why is it always you?”
Dean stared him down, wanting to be angry, but his anger died looking at Cas’ contrite, sorrowful expression. He sighed, “Are we good?”
It wrenched its hand back and screeched, blood flying from the wound when it whipped the knife away.
But he was faster and batted at the back of her bike. It slid out from under her and she tumbled to the gravel. She was saved only because she had not had time to gain any speed, so the fall did little more than scrape her up. She rolled and landed on her feet, dagger-claw ready.
He laughs, “As much as he’ll ever be. He takes FBI calls and does research. But like I said, he’s got a coupla kids now. Hard to hunt with kids.”
The creature howled and lunged, the heavy claws hanging from its hands slashing at her. She threw up her knife, striking one of its hands, piercing it clean through.
“Dean… being here, with you and your family… it’s no punishment. It makes me concerned that I have gone off track, made a miscalculation.”
A few days later, the motorcycle rumbled under Bobby while she barreled down a mercifully empty highway. The cars had been going fast when they’d come so they were crashed in ditches, roofs torn off of most of them. It left the highway clear for her to cruise down, stopping only when the asphalt was broken and needed to be carefully maneuvered over. She’d just looted new tires, she didn’t want to damage them.
Cas felt awkward, wasting a great deal more time than needed to collect two beers so that Dean could shower, change, and check in on Bobby before settling in to his room.
Cas frowned, “I am not sure why changing plans to see your brother would make you so happy, Dean, you have said you miss him. And Bobby misses her cousins. Have you fought?”
“Ethan? Sleeping still probably. You know his name is really familiar. Oh shit! I know where I read it before, hold on.” She leapt up and bolted to the garage to rifle through the bag on her bike to retrieve her dad’s journal. She clutched it to herself and returned to Crowley in the library.
Together they entered the house, Crowley yawning and unrolling his own sleeping bag to sleep in the living room after they’d cleared each room. By the time Bobby had left the Bunker, all the beds in the houses she looted were too fetid to bother with, she too, usually laid out her sleeping bag in the living rooms. She laid hers against the wall and tucked her back against it.
Bobby shivered in the dew, crawling on her belly through the long grass to the spot she’d marked on the map. The watch Crowley had given her ticked loudly as it slid around her wrist. She glanced at it, watching the second hand move. Two minutes.
Cas sat up and pulled up his shirt, peeling back the bandage to reveal healthy, unmarred skin, “Yes, it appears your tending did me well.”
“As I said… there is unrest in heaven. I had nowhere else to go. As you know, the Bunker provides some respite.”
Dean shrugs, “Guess I never thought about it. You were a kid angel once then? You have a tiny little trenchcoat?”
She made a loud noise to scare off whatever animal it was. When she heard nothing more, no scampering of paws, she paused, failing to tamp down the bubbling hope in her gut.
Salt in her pocket, she went back to her bike, getting the plastic gasoline jug out and siphoning gas she could not afford to lose from her own tank.
She stirred the beans and ignored Crowley for a while. Even this short conversation was tiring her out.
She started with the house she was in front of, testing the bolt then using the ax to chop it open when she found it locked. No use risking a turned ankle or hurt shoulder ramming against it. She reached through the hole she’d chopped in the door and unlocked it, then swung it open.
She took Ethan’s hand and walked him up the hallway to his room. Crowley followed them both without comment, lurking just outside the door as she settled Ethan in her old bed and tucked him in, kissing his forehead.
Cas closed his eyes as Dean cleaned him up, “I will heal more quickly than a human, but I cannot call upon Heaven’s power to aid me.”
She shrugged again and left the library, finding Ethan waiting for her. She scooped him up and held him on her hip on the way down to the archives even if he was a little big to be carried around.
Dean got up and headed out into the freezing Michigan winter. Maybe he could con his way into a bar and try to hustle pool again. He couldn’t steal food for the whole week if they didn’t have a car to skip town. He shoved his hands in his pockets and chewed his lip. Bar it was.
She took them to a supermarket first, parking the bike and getting her sawed-off, checking and loading it first as always before she was ready. Crowley didn’t move. She watched him expectantly.
He was proven right when even this made her gasp, “Daddy did bad things? Did he poop his pants on purpose?”
“No, we are friends because when he was being tortured in Hell I besieged the gates and when I found him, I gripped him tight and raised him from perdition.”
. It was still there! She cruised toward the gate, already looking forward to what she’d find. She rode right up to the gate to look at the padlock, sure she could break it if she had the time.
They made it there together in the evening; a warm, safe feeling rushing over her as they eased their bikes into the garage’s hidden entrance. It was just in time too, Ethan was starting to nod off.
She stepped back from it, waving her knife in front of it, expecting its wounds to seal closed. She’d seen it before, she knew how ineffectual her weapons were. She’d watched them heal themselves as quickly as they could be hurt.
Bobby lost the playful look in her eye she’d had with Ethan and considered him calmly while he shouted, “Hunt the archives. That’s your plan? You’re going to find something about destroying… this sigil in particular or sigils in general?”
She filled her belly with meat and extinguished the fire, spitting in it and going inside to set up her camp for the night. At least if she could get a sidecar or something maybe she could adopt one of the feral dogs that ran around cities. That would be nice, a little companionship.
She lay there for hours in the pre-dawn mist, the cool, damp air surrounding her. She was patient; after all, she had nothing but time. The sound was always a risk, but it was a risk she’d have to take. And anyway, maybe it would finally bring them to her and she would be done.
“Moose is Uncle Sammy?” She carried on when he smiled in assent, “Ok, well he didn’t arrange the books out here.”
“Alright, Winchester,” she muttered to herself, “Get up and go. There’s a kid in there.” She stood up and shot her sawed-off into the air. It echoed in the field.
She grinned, “Thought you were the big tough King of Hell, thought you’d know that stuff. Or did your mommy leave that out of the ABCs of magic?”
Dean fidgeted, then finished taping a bandage over his wound, “Ok, that’s the best I’ve got. I’m gonna go wash this mud and stuff off.”
Cas laughed, “Yes, you are correct, of course. Perhaps then it is more accurate to say that you have left her with your…” he trailed off, his courage failing.
them. They changed some quality of the air, charged it with ozone. She peered up over the hood of the car at the big house. It was in rough shape, the windows broken and paint peeling even worse than the usual suburban places she looted.
Cas beamed, “Then what I meant to say was that she is being cared for by your best friend who only happens to be an angel of the lord.”
He turned and walked toward the door, fleeing like he’d done a thousand times before. He stopped in the door frame, remaining there for too long, neither leaving nor staying.
Dean laid her in her bed and pulled the covers over her, sitting on the edge of the bed, “Ok, kiddo, what do you wanna hear tonight?”
It was still plenty light enough that shoving the sliding door open flooded the floor with light. She shot at the movement in the corner on instinct, hitting it squarely. The shuffling animal fell bloody to the dirt. She left it for now, taking a slow circle around the barn for anything else, then slinging the rifle across her back to climb the ladder into the loft.
“Why? You have another stupid save-heaven-grand-plan? Because I gotta tell you, Cas, those never work out well.”
She picked up the spell bag and looked at it, “We didn’t have much Holy Oil, this must be all we’ve got.”
His wings beat the air and he leapt. He landed on her with his full weight, claws biting into her. But her claw bit right back. She sank the knife deep into his chest, his own weight driving him down upon it. He scrabbled at her, but his claws had no strength behind them. His arms fell back and the light left his eyes.
Sarathiel looked at Astor, “How soon do you think we can collect the boy’s blood to fish for another?”
“Mhm all the time, we go when it’s nice out. They come here sometimes too. Ok, play now! I’m it!” She charged him, stumbling when he vanished with a
Dean thought his meaning was obvious, but Cas clearly did not as he tilted his head in confusion, “Reward? I am not in need of a reward. I would find most valuables useless, you should save them.”
She watched the fire burn for catharsis but also for self-preservation; it wouldn’t do to let the long grass catch. The bright light ruined her night vision, but she could still hear the Harley rumbling back up the road toward the farm. She did not fully understand the game that had been afoot before he’d run off, but she did have the sense that she had won.
Dean spun back around and looked at Cas, green eyes like fire. He strode back to him, face set like he was walking into battle. He pushed Cas by the shoulder, and Cas allowed himself to be backed up and shoved against the wall. Dean only paused for another second to look him in the eyes before he kissed him.
She felt she would always be moving along. She needed a new heading, something to aim for even if it was frivolous.
She grinned, regardless of melancholy and winked, “He sure is, and he won’t ever let you forget it.”
His scowl deepened and he got up, glaring at her all the way to the kitchen to see if there was something else he could loot for breakfast. She ate from the pan as he clanked around, grumbling, finally returning with an open can of pineapple.
“Course he does,” she said, getting Ethan his bowl before she started on her own, sitting on the counter.
She chewed on her lip, “Then I’m the bait, you go inside and get him and run. I’ll circle around and meet you in Beresford, it’s not far.”
Cas met his eyes, “I - I was supposed to allow them to take Sam. I was sent to observe weeks ago. As part of my training before I am assigned a garrison.”
Dean held out the plate and Cas took it, their fingers brushed together and Cas inhaled sharply. Dean looked up. They held each other’s gazes for a long moment, before Cas took his plate and sat at the table.
She swayed on her bike and almost lost control. She braked before she could do worse damage, making it almost until she was at a stop before she fell, skidding to a stop on the pavement, blackness engulfing her and pain arcing out of her wounds.
“Gotcha, so the Baby Rays were snagging people to eat from other times. And that’s what they wanted in the Bunker, they must think there’s a better spell.”
She looked at it for a moment before turning back. She retreated as quickly as she could to her bike, shoving her things into her bag and kicking the motorcycle into life. It jerked forward and she did her best to control it, even if her wounded shoulder was making her right arm half useless. White light was still coming out of her puncture wounds, not to mention blood, moving her right arm at all was excruciating.
Dean left Cas to lean against the wall of the motel, dropping his room key he was shaking so hard, in such a hurry to check on Sammy. He swore and scooped it up, getting the key in the lock and flinging open the door.
But its wounded leg didn’t heal and it only snarled at her, not advancing, opening and closing its mouth, many rows of teeth gnashing.
“Suit yourself,” she said, but didn’t re-mount her bike, unbuckling the rifle from the side to take it through the barn.
Dean fiddled with the knife he’d just pulled out of the duffle bag, “Unrest in heaven ain’t ever good, Cas.”
“Cas and I are on our way, kiddo,” he said into the walkie. He pulled his t-shirt back on and threw one to Cas so he wouldn’t have to button up his dress shirt again. “We’ll make sure you’re ok. You got salt and iron?”
“Why? Were you aiming at the broad side of a barn thirty feet away from him?” She asked. She waited for some sort of response and grinned when it didn’t come, “Oh, I got it, you mojo-ed your way to good aim, huh? Tough luck, sport.”
Cas whipped back his hand, “Yes, I suppose. It would be unseemly to allow Bobby to see you in this state.”
He held her gaze, his eyes smoldering with some vestigial glimmer of demonic ire. They waited each other out. She tilted her head to the side, canny enough to know he was playing some sort of game, but not sure what.
There was no reason for her to be in Chicago, but then there was no reason not to be in Chicago either. Maybe the Field Museum was still up. Uncle Sammy said it was unmissable.
She drew a knife out of her belt and tossed it up lazily. She waited until it was pummelling back down at her face before snapping it out of the air. “You getting us out, Crow?”
Her stomach growled and she pulled off the highway slowly, easing down into the residential maze of what looked like a middle class neighborhood. She parked her bike in a driveway off a cul de sac and dismounted, taking off her helmet and leaving it on the seat. She drew her knife out of the side bag and put it on her hip, the Colt was already in one holster, a regular handgun in the other. Just in case, she slung the sawed off across her back and carried a fireax in her hand.
“Why can’t you-” she mimicked his hand motion from before that had done nothing but look stupid. She’d been told by her dad the broad strokes of demons throwing him and Uncle Sammy across rooms.
They ran through their stolen box of ammo, Crowley having improved only marginally and they got up, stowing the gun on her bike. Crowley leaned against his own.
The treatment didn’t alleviate the pain, but it felt nice, like cool water on a burn. She pulled on the ratty tshirt again until she could get a new one and took the medical supplies from Crowley, “Your turn.”
She moved ten seconds too late. The watch ticked ten whole times in the grass between when she knew she had to go and when she could actually force herself to move.
She pulled off when she saw a broken metal post sticking up and dismounted, descending into the ditch and moving slowly over the long grass. It was big and didn’t take long to find, the huge metal sign, flipped upside down, metal rent from the talons of the beast that had ripped it down. She paused to put on heavy leather gloves then hefted it up, unwilling to cut herself on dirty metal and risk infection.
“I have used a gun plenty of times. I could have shot your oh-so-tough father more than once, I’ll have you know.”
He could have cleaned up properly but wished to distract her from her sorry feelings. He waved his hand and cleaned up the kitchen with a small
Cas could not help but recall the time Dean had thrown Cas out of this very bunker barely a day after when he had arrived, newly human, many years before. Nor the indignity of working at the Gas-n-Sip, Dean nowhere to be seen. He smiled a little before answering gravely, “Yes. That’s what he did.”
Dean burst out laughing, “Alright, good lesson. Go put some popcorn in the microwave and I’ll get the kid.”
Cas pulled him up and kissed him, snaking their legs together, “Maybe we could hunt together. Would you like that, Dean?”
Dean kicked the radiator again to get it to come back to life. It shuddered and choked out a little warm air and Dean tugged Sam over to hold his hands out in front of it.
Cas scowled, “There was... slightly more to the prophecy. It is said that a weapon has been forged on Earth which can vanquish heaven’s greatest foes, and that Michael must guide it.”
“Ok,” she said, not fighting him. She changed into her pajamas and brushed her teeth just like she was supposed to, Dean waiting for her to finish so he could tuck her in and kiss her forehead.
She tilted her head and looked at him for a moment, “Ok, you take the sawed-off and head into the field, I’ll take the rifle and the knife. Try to get its wings. You can’t kill it like that but it’ll do damage. And even you should be able to hit it if it’s right up in front of you. We ground it, I jump it.”
She approached it slow and steady, good arm aiming her gun in case she needed to fire it again. If those claws could cut her this deep, maybe leaving them… would be a waste.
“What was he, seven or eight years old?” He said, purring, “You want to put him in even more danger than necessary?”
“No, you can stay,” He shuffled over in bed and she laid behind him like her dad did when she was really small and she’d had a nightmare.
“I hardly need you teaching me,” he snapped, “I corralled the demons into an order that was twice what I had found, I bargained the souls from countless stinking humans, I trained fleets of hellhounds!” his voice rose to a shout, “I was the
“No monsters, nothing can get in if somebody don’t let it in” he confirmed, “Got the walkie if you need me?”
He turned on her nightlight and left her door an inch open the way she liked. He lingered awhile, half to watch her sleep and half because he didn’t want to face Cas just yet. Finally he headed out, going to the kitchen instead of the library to wash up from supper, hoping he could have a few minutes to himself to think. Cas, however, was waiting for him there, sitting as still as a gargoyle.
“If you wanted fashion advice, you could have just asked,” he said, “Daddy’s jacket is a little big for you, and you could drop some of your layers of flannel.”
Cas answered her with utter seriousness, “Of course, Bobby, I would not dream of allowing you to fall prey to demons or their ilk.”
“It was not my intention,” he replied, “This is not one of my… primary skills. I do not need to eat so I never found a need to learn to cook.”
He roared from behind her and swept her off her feet, swinging her upside down, while she screamed in surprise and delight, “Forgot to watch your back!” he crowed and tossed her high into the air to bounce on the sofa.
She put Ethan down on the sofa and almost collapsed. Now that she was here and death was not winging its way down on her, the full pain of her wounds came soaring back. She would rather have knives under her fingernails.
His eyes widened and he followed after Bobby as she bolted up the stairs with Ethan and down the long hall to the garage.
“Jesus freaking Christ, Cas. She doesn’t need to hear about you getting jumped by a thousand Leviathan and dying in a lake.”
But she had come, and she wouldn’t waste it. She wound her way through the city, wishing she’d seen it when it was alive so she could have some point of comparison. She saw a sign for the Field and turned that way.
“Can you blame me for being worried? You didn’t come with great news. It’s not like you came down asking to stay because you missed me.”
“I’ll bet,” he sneered, “Now perhaps before you loot more of my things, you’ll tell me who you are.”
“I fear… I fear that the more people know what I am, the more likely my superiors will discover my transgression.”
Crowley nodded to himself, “Being a god would explain why he can see my real face. And what Castiel was doing with his blood.”
“Clever little Winchester,” he praised but didn’t let her look smug for too long before changing the subject, “Where is the boy?”
“Spells need something to power them; I would assume good ol’ Cas knew a spell to use the boy’s blood and open doorways to different times. But spells always have rules, so I bet the Hellions couldn’t get through them,” he said, refusing to call them Baby Rays.
The door flew open, finally, and the two of them almost fell inside. Dean laughed as Cas stumbled out of his arms and onto his feet, the two of them breaking apart so they could stay upright. Although come to think of it, falling on top of Cas wasn’t completely unappealing.
Dean groaned when he woke, sitting up and cracking his back, wincing at the pain that made him feel like an old man. He stood and pulled on a t-shirt, sliding his feet into his slippers and pulling on a robe since, try as he might for Bobby’s sake, the Bunker was never exactly warm.
It had taken her great-grandfather to her father; maybe it could take her, too. Maybe if Ethan’s power could get them moving, the blood sigil could steer.
“Fuck,” she grumbled and rose, slinging her rifle strap over her shoulder and going back to the ladder to shimmy back down to the ground. She circled the house and sighed heavily at the trail of blood disappearing into a copse of trees. She started walking after it, annoyed at her less than perfect shot.
She straightened the watch so she could look at the time. Another minute. It would have been comforting to think she’d see her dad on the other side, but there wasn’t another side. Even if there was, there was nothing left of her dad to cross over to it. She relaxed her muscles and pressed her face to the grass one last time, breathing in its comforting, wholesome smell. There was a bird singing somewhere.
. Under most circumstances, that would be the hard part. Angels could swing it, some spells could do it, Ethan’s father, Chronos, and obviously Ethan himself. If they could get through the sigil on the kid’s arm, they’d have that part down.
Cas looked unsure about how to respond and settled for saying nothing, “Things are not going well in heaven.”
Dean looked at the whole picture: Cas in his t-shirt, snuggling Bobby and he smiled as he felt a rush of warmth. “Alright, let’s go.” He clapped a hand on Cas’ free shoulder, taking them to the living room to sit together on the sofa. Cas wrapped Bobby in a blanket and let her snuggle across both of their laps.
“Smote it?” Dean stood up and took a few cautious steps where Castiel was pointing, glancing back at him nervously, “So it’s dead?”
Cas groaned and clutched at him, kissing him feverishly. Dean shoved him up against the door, holding him up with one arm under him while he tried to work the doorknob.
“She looks very much like you…”  Cas said after a long period where the only sound was Dean washing dishes.
Her face hardened, and she shoved the spell bag into her pocket, “Touch Ethan… and I’ll throw you out of the Bunker.” Turning, she stalked away to her dads’ old bedroom.
The wounds across her back twinged, cold seeping through her skin. “He was different after Uncle Sammy died. Said he couldn’t even get close to the house, there were too many of ‘em.”
“I am surprised you chose the Bunker. I was under the impression you wanted a ‘normal life’ free of… ‘heaven bullshit’.”
“An organized band of soldiers placed in a fortress or outpost in order to provide a guard. I was its captain.”
The force of the impacts pushed the emaciated thing back as they never would have if it were at full strength, giving Bobby time to draw her dagger-claw and race behind the creature, sprinting toward it. It turned and swung its heavy claws at her, missing her by only inches as she dropped back into the grass.
An awkward silence brewed between them. Bobby went back to making her dagger, “They’re not that strong.”
She remembered what he’d looked like as an angel outside the Bunker. She’d only ever seen him through the round window in the door, speaking to Cas and her dad. Conflicting emotions rose under her skin. He was a monster to be hunted, a threat to be feared, and a familiar face.
The children screamed at each other in greeting. Eddy was the bigger by far and bowled Bobby over, the two of them wrestling on the ground and happily pummelling each other.
“Well,” he muttered under his breath, blushing, not because he was about to go and earn a little food for his brother, but because he was begging, “You said I could pray, Cas, I’m praying. I don’t know what you can do, but I don’t wanna- Maybe you could just walk with me over there. If you’re around.”
“Dean,” Cas croaked, opening the Bunker door for him, returning from his hunt after four days of absence.
“No, they can’t. I stayed there a long time and they tried their best. But we gotta go. They’re gonna be coming after us.”
“That’s him sitting on the hood of the car, the other guy leaning on him is… is my other dad Cas. That’s me shoved in between them.”
“I mean what I say, Dean. I have never had a chance to stay here long with you, some circumstance has always forced me out.”
Astor frowned as Hannah leapt from the porch, flapping her wings but landing hard on the roof of a car only two away from Bobby and Crowley. She sniffed the air.
“I arranged the library. I was here for the better part of a decade on my own. I’ve read through almost everything in here, some of it more than once. What did you think I did to fill the time?”
Cas remained where he was, hovering so near him, their faces close. Dean watched him, waiting for him; Cas watched him too, waiting just the same.
That left the part she needed to tackle: aiming. According to the lore Uncle Sammy had written down, a powered-up Ethan would get pulled to a different time. He couldn’t do much to control it unless he’d stolen the lifeforce of three people. That meant that unless she could find an alternative way to aim, she and Ethan might get out of the apocalypse but there was no telling where they’d end up, or when they’d find themselves right back here, hiding from Castiel.
It took her longer than she wanted to get out of Sioux Falls, unable to get her bike to full speed with how poorly she could control it with one arm. It was still bleeding too, she’d have to stop and patch herself up. Just a little further, if she could get further away she could stop.
They didn’t talk until the door opened and Bobby came in, drowning in one of her Dean’s flannel shirts over her tiny pink t-shirt.
, but she didn’t exactly relish the idea of holding an eight year old up by the armpits so he could murder three innocent people. If she started doing that, she might find her way back to her family just in time for them to hunt
Cas took a seat beside him, taking the spell ingredients and sorting them efficiently, “That sounds very territorial of you.”
“Ok, I’m gonna come back there, but if you jump out at me I’m gonna be pissed,” he warned, covering up his fear with bravado.
She fended him off, driving him backward and forcing him to retreat. She dropped the crossbow, out of bolts, and glanced at Sarathiel. She had pulled the bolt free from her leg and stood unsteadily. Bobby charged her, angling herself at her weakened side. She ducked under Sarathiel’s striking claws and drove the blade up under her jaw. Blood poured over Bobby’s arm as Sarathiel twitched out her last breaths.
She reclined in her chair, tipping her head back and looking at the ceiling, “Are we getting out of here? What do you really think?”
Her lip curled and she narrowed her eyes at him, wondering if she was going to have to fight him for the bike. Her hand slid slowly to her knife at her belt.
He got Castiel’s arm over his shoulder and helped pull him up. Castiel whimpered and leaned against him pitifully. “Alright, I’m gonna take you back to my room, Cas.”
This got his attention, “A demon? A real demon?” he narrowed his eyes, “How’d you know it was a demon?”
Crowley pulled her up and they scrabbled at the door of the dungeon, finally flinging it open as Castiel rounded the corner toward them, terrifying in the Bunker’s flashing red emergency lights.
The creature snapped at her, its unhealthy wings spreading, unable to support its weight on its wounded leg. You could almost see that it had once looked human, even with its hands ending in six inch, ragged claws and hooked, birdlike feet. These were nothing to the mangled jaw, distorted and wide to fit many rows of broken fangs.
His phone buzzed on the table and he glanced at it while she was picking herself up, “Hey, my friend’s here. Come on, let’s go let him in.”
“Maybe. Dad says Chronos lit up in red light then jumped through time. It was unpredictable and involuntary unless he killed somebody and stole their - well their lifeforce or something. Ok, ok so… so he’s with this Lila Taylor in 1944, meets up with dad, gets killed and all that. She’s left there in the forties right?”
He laughed, “Well if you know so much about the books we might need, then find some for me. I’ll pour you a drink.”
She frowned, back stiff, as she knocked his hand aside, “No, you’re not going to kill him. Not on my watch.”
“... to your… home. I thought you were living in a townhouse in Salem, Oregon,” Cas said, frowning and tilting his head.
She froze in place for what felt to her like an eon before she shot backwards and punched him hard on the shoulder.
She took the pot off the fire when it was hot with a stolen oven mitt. She carried it to the kitchen and found a bowl, dumping the warm beans into it and finding a real spoon. She carried it back to the living room and handed it to Crowley.
“I’m not an idiot, Crowley, I’m sure it’s dark out. I’m going to check that the warding sigils are at least still working.”
“I recognize what you said when I arrived but truly, I did not know your family would be here. I don’t want to be a burden. I can go. I have made my way on Earth before.”
She looked at him for a bit, puzzling through the first earnest thing he’d said, “As far as we’ll get. Don’t wanna travel at night.”
Cas dropped his head onto Dean’s chest. Dean reached over and picked up the walkie, pressing the talk button, “You ok, sweetheart? You need me?”
She looked up at her father who smiled at her so she smiled at Cas too, “You gotta check all the sigils before I go to sleep.”
“The archangels are dead,” Dean said, sharpening his knife now, honing its edge with practiced motions.
“We gotta look up that stuff for dad tonight too,” Dean said, pulling on his boots and jacket, “You got the books from the library right?”
He snatched a book up off the library table and smiled devilishly, “The spell won’t take ten minutes.”
Castiel considered how to answer, “Your Uncle Sam called him and said that people were in danger. It is very difficult for your father to ignore such a summons. I have found that your father’s…” he paused and trailed off, toying with how to phrase it, he smiled to himself, unaware that Bobby was not following this, “
Bobby sat bold upright in her dads’ bed where she’d been sleeping now that Ethan had taken over her old room. Her short hair was sticking up and she was drowning in a big t-shirt, “Crow? What the hell are you doing?”
She left him on the couch and walked to the fireplace, squatting to stir her Spaghetti-o’s. “It’s morning. Gotta move,” she said again.
They were too far apart, to face one she had to turn her back on the other. Astor then. She sighted her crossbow on him. She had two shots left. She would have to shoot then turn and shoot Sarathiel. Her aim had to be
She turned on the flame for the stove and slowly stirred the lumpy Hormel tamales, distributing them into bowls and calling for Crowley when they were warm.
“Didn’t get to ask,” she said, slurping back the remainder of her spaghetti-o’s before standing up, “You need a bike. Cars are too big and too much gas.”
“I need to go,” Cas said, but tilted his head and looked inquiringly at Dean instead of leaving, hand still holding Dean’s.
preventing something from getting her. But Cas was already getting up and pulling Dean to his feet, they both knew Dean had to check.
It wasn’t like the kisses before, sweet and chaste and full of adoration. It was rougher and wanting. Cas shoved him back hard against the bed, hand on his jaw.
That made her smile too and she set back to work, diligently flipping through text after text to look for anything to do with sigil removal.
Sarathiel nodded her agreement, “We need the books from the Men of Letters’ Bunker. The next human we fish for could go inside the Bunker for us and collect books. We would need someone to open the door.”
“... Cas… shit. Then you’re the seraph that can open the Cage. That’s why they’re after you? To drain your grace and let Michael out? For what? To restart the apocalypse?”
Dean was flooded with a rush of emotions for his baby brother and wanted to scoop him up and kiss his stupid floppy hair and hug him like a kid. But he resisted and acted like a man about it, punching Sam’s shoulder, “I won’t get caught.”
Circling the garage was one of them. Its frame suspended in the air on two massive wings, feathers red and black, mouth distended to hold enormous teeth, hands with claws like knives.
Only then did she enter the house, even if it was too dark to be advisable. She could feel them emanating like a void from the kitchen. Why did so many of these people flee to their kitchen when they saw doom coming?
“Oh, kitten, if you’d seen what I have you would know that when an apocalypse starts you should always look for a Winchester at the center of it.”
He found himself trembling, he could hear the blood rushing in his ears. Castiel’s gaze transfixed him.
He didn’t know what he expected, a whoosh of air and Cas to be sitting next to him? He also didn’t know what he wanted Cas to do when he got here. Tell him where to find Sammy, or promise to keep Sammy safe. Or comfort him and maybe kiss him again.
Her heart clenched when she let herself think of her dad. She missed him so bad it made her bones hurt. They still wouldn’t have been able to maneuver the Impala but they could have both had bikes. She had to pull over to get herself together. She wanted to hit something it hurt so bad.
She forced herself to focus and tore her eyes from his face to his exposed frame. This troubled her. A year ago she’d fought a Baby Ray in this place that had been weak and dying. She could remember the way its skin had stretched, pale and gray, over its ribs. It had wobbled on its feet. Astor’s frame may have been dirty, but it was not malnourished. He looked strong, alert.
Hannah angled her wings and shot down at her, claws outstretched. Bobby braced herself and tucked the butt of the crossbow into her shoulder. Three shots. She had to make it count.
He paid for the food at the register and headed back toward the motel with his plastic bag. He was crossing the alley behind the motel when something made him stop. The light over the motel’s back door flickered down the alley. He stopped and looked at it. It flickered again.
She grinned at that, drawing the claw from the bag and shoving it into her belt. He seemed to be expecting her to say something but she had no idea what, so she walked off to hunt through the closets for a spare leather jacket.
She knew Crowley would find somewhere to make himself comfortable. She stayed in the dormitory hallway, going down a few doors to her dads’ room. The door creaked on its hinges and she thought she ought to spray it down with WD-40. But not now.
There’d been close calls before sure, where Sam had been in danger or late home from school. But this was different. He’d left a note. Dean was supposed to be looking after him  and he left a note and said he wasn’t ever coming back.
Gasoline and salt in hand, she returned to the bodies, looking at them in the rising moonlight. She twisted the cap of the salt open, feeling it scrape beneath her fingers. She poured it reverently over the bodies, watching it scatter over them, fill the divots their dried skin made around their ribs. When the canister ran empty she put it down and lifted the gas can instead. She tipped it over them, the astringent sacrifice sliding over them and glistening in the starlight.
“Can I have Spaghetti-o’s instead?” She asked, warily eyeing the blackened pancakes he was scraping off the griddle.
Dean sat across from them with his own pancakes, “What you wanna get up to today, kid? You wanna help me clean the car?”
He shoved his own claws into a bag and scowled, “You would prefer if I dressed more like a lumberjack?”
“The town’s not far, let’s keep going,” Crowley complained, dismounting and wincing, not used to riding so long. His was a lot bigger than hers, some middle aged dad’s monster Harley.
She rubbed her shoulder again, looking off into the middle distance, “Yeah… I… was waiting up for him, looking through the window in the door.”
“Yeah, that too, she was just a baby back then. She napped through the whole thing, I made Sammy come watch her.”
She took his spot, sighting the rifle, and squeezed the trigger. The bottle shattered off the fence. “My dad taught me, I practiced alone after he died.” She reloaded the rifle and handed it back, “Keep at it, you’ll need to be able to shoot.”
She pulled the trigger and the crossbow sprang, punching back into her shoulder. The bolt wobbled in the air but struck true, piercing through Hannah’s throat. She screamed, blood gushing out. She careened toward Bobby, a dying, jerking mass of wings and claws. Bobby rolled out of the way, barely missing being slammed into.
“Well we gotta keep our stuff in nice condition, right, sharpen all the knives, clean the guns, see what spell shit we’ve got.”
The city streets were grim, since people had been outside when they came. The bodies were everywhere, dry and abandoned. It put sick in Bobby’s stomach and before she’d even gotten to see anything, she wished she hadn’t come. They were the wrong kind of dead.
Bobby looked at Ethan and they both started giggling. Crowley’s face darkened, “I see the two of you are going to be intolerable.”
Crowley climbed onto the little motorcycle after her and she tensed to feel someone so close that she could feel him breathing. It was worse when she kicked off, turning up the side streets toward the highway. At a certain speed she recognized that she could kill him if she crashed. He’d have to get his own bike, she didn’t like that sort of weight.
Sam fidgeted, leaving this guy behind in the room, but followed Dean who took the car his dad had thankfully left for them and backed it up to the alley. Together, he and Sam managed to drag the giant guy down the alley and dump him into the trunk. At the last minute, Dean thought to grab the grocery bag and toss it into the back seat.
She squeezed the trigger. The crossbow kicked back at her but the bolt went wide, careening passed Astor’s ear harmlessly.
“You have not improved your ability to hold a coherent conversation. But yes, clearly they can starve.”
“I won’t be able to sleep for awhile, yet. I can tell you after I shower and change. Why don’t you grab a couple beers and meet me in my room?”
Cas sat beside him and left his hand on his face, fond as anything, “Barely, you got your ass kicked.”
It was as she’d left it. A picture of her and her dad on the dresser. An old polaroid of her grandmother in a frame on her dad’s nightstand. Cas’ trench coat hanging on the hook.
She didn’t have time to stand here in this field and brood. Cas had told her so many times not to trust Crowley. Cas had made it clear, just when you think he is on your side, really on your side, he will betray you. But who would he even betray her to? She put her hand in her pocket and felt the key where she’d sewn it in.
He crossed the room and sat on the edge of the bed where Dean had, “Yes. I can. At that time I had not been on Earth for a millenium, rather I was stationed with a garrison in Heaven.”
Dean disengaged from the topic, “Eddy’s six, Mary’s three. They’ll have a great time. You’ll love ‘em. And while Sam’s here maybe you can tell us about what’s going on in heaven.”
“She’s nice. I wanna see my mom. I want that more than anything. But she told me… if I wanna go back I gotta kill people. I don’t wanna.”
Bobby scooted deeper under the car, tugging at Crowley who already knew what she meant to do. They shuffled out from under the car, crouching and moving away from the house, using the struggle with Hannah to buy them time to make their escape.
She made an odd, confused sound and went back to the kitchen for heavy kitchen shears, before sitting again by the fire and beginning to cut up the jacket.
The monster lurched and she struck, slamming its own claw through its chest. It screeched and smokey light flashed in its eyes and out of its mouth as it shook and finally fell to the ground. The dread that had choked like a suffocating cloud had dissipated; the body on the ground now nothing but old meat.
She’d lost her anger by the time she got there, replacing it with bone-deep fatigue. She wiped the dust from the porthole window and leaned her forehead against it. The footstool she’d moved to look out this window when she was little was still there, kicked to the side. She didn’t need it now, but it was a dim reminder of how many hours she’d spent staring out this window.
She nodded and maneuvered behind him as they exited the store. She checked the cars in the parking lot and siphoned some gas before getting back on the bike and looking for a place to stay. Crowley tapped her shoulder as they slowly drove down the main stretch and gestured toward a residential area. She nodded and took them that way.
She blinked and tried to sit up, not making sense of where she was. She’d been on the side of the road. There was a fire crackling and she smelled cooking.
She got back on her bike and kept going, through the one time sleepy Beresford and into the biggest city South Dakota once had to its name. She knew the address, it had been written in a journal her dad had had in his room and she now had in her backpack. She’d just have to pull into a gas station near the outskirts and get a Sioux Falls map.
Dean had been gone for less than two hours, trying to get the sister of the guy who’d gotten chewed up by some sort of monster to spill more information. He even got the information. He’d been proud of himself damnit.
She pulled herself up and looked around. Sunlight came in through broken slats in the walls and cut dusty shafts of light into the rotting hay. She looked away.
She watched him for a moment before she stood up. She clicked on her old nightlight and left the room. She didn’t want to talk to Crowley for a while. Seeing Cas - seeing Castiel had opened a gaping old wound. Jesus Christ she missed them.
He was very pleased with this game, especially when she played until she fell asleep on the sofa. He took a blanket from the back of the sofa and draped it over her, watching her for a moment. He found that she looked particularly like Dean while she was sleeping; they had the same freckles and the same forlorn features.
Good. She was close, she’d be there in a few hours. She wanted to see Singer’s Garage, the old house. Her dad had said it used to be like home. She knew Bobby Singer had died long before she was born and the garage might not even be there, but she had nothing but time.
“Your father is working. He will not return for a few days at least. I will have to suffice. Did you suffer a nightmare? They frequently torment your father.”
“I will throw you back into hell,” Cas said, lifting Dean as easily as if he were a stuffed doll and tossing him onto the bed. He loomed over him, eyes blazing with promise.
He tilted his head again and Dean tried to remain mad at him, “I do not know why that upsets you, Dean, that is what angels do.”
The door was almost broken through behind him. She could see Castiel’s face. The memory of another broken door flashed across her mind.
“You are resourceful,” he said, “I will give you that. Dean never managed to kill any of us. Of course we were stronger then, gorged on souls. It was you who killed Efram and cut off his claw a year ago? I wondered.”
“Of course. I was instructed to retrieve the Righteous Man, that is your father, from Hell as he had broken the first seal on the Lucifer’s cage when he had turned to…” he caught himself before he said it and reasoned that ‘scarring her for life’ might include telling her details about her father’s stint as one of Hell’s supreme torturers, “when he had turned to… bad things.”
“Yes, all four of them, there is… only unrest for now. I am not sure the cause. But I will put a stop to it by whatever means necessary.”
She wrenched the dagger free and faced Astor. He had once been the great enemy, the reason Cas had done all he had.
She took a moment to lay back on the hot concrete and close her eyes, liking the yellow sunshine through her eyelids. It reminded her of summer days with her father. He would practice shooting outside and she would lay across the warm trunk of the Impala and sleep.
She had her shot but ran instead, pelting through the grass toward her bike. Castiel roared after her, wing already healed over. She mounted her bike and shot wildly behind her, hearing him screech and fall again. It bought her time to kick the bike into life and move.
Bobby lurched the motorcycle around so fast the rear tire skidded and she almost fell. She wrenched on the accelerator and snapped forward, the monster bearing down. This little bike wasn’t meant to race, it seemed so slow, like she was dragging through mud. It would not be fast enough.
Dean leaned closer, never closing the distance, like he was caught in Cas’ orbit, “You keep dying on me, buddy. I want you to stay.”
Being stared down for an answer she didn’t have mader her itch. She retreated instead, walking away into the kitchen mid-conversation, rummaging through the cupboards roughly with one arm, her right one tucked tight against her stomach.
Dark, fetid wings sprouted from his back. To accommodate them, he’d stripped to the waist, but he still wore dress pants, dirty and frayed though they were. He flexed his deadly claws and his pale eyes scanned the junkyard. His nostrils flared over sharp cheekbones.
Bobby was breathing hard by the time they were out of the junkyard and fleeing back toward their bikes.
She nodded and took her own materials, sitting at her favorite spot regardless of where Crowley was sitting, two tables over. Ethan came with her, sitting next to her.
Cas smiled and took that as assent to pull Dean to him and kiss him again. Dean wrapped his arms around him and Cas held Dean tightly. Dean felt like the world was spinning around them. Cas tasted the way the stars looked out in the middle of nowhere. He made Dean’s head buzz and his blood surge.
He tucked her blankets around her and touched two fingers to her forehead to prevent her dreaming further.
Cas smiled and did as he was told, going to the kitchen for snacks. He returned with the popcorn and sat on the other side of the couch from Dean, who put Bobby down to snuggle in the middle.
The word hung in the air like perfume, Cas’ mouth curved into a tender smile. Dean stared at him, opening his mouth to speak twice before he grimaced and got back on task, “Uhh… what’s hunting you, Cas?”
Astor half turned and looked back into the house, speaking to another. He spoke in Enochian, quietly enough that Bobby could not hear him, but her shoulder wound throbbed and the car rattled. It was no wonder that every window and windshield in the junkyard was shattered.
“Yeah,” she said after a while, “That’s the first place I went after I left the Bunker, I’d been there a bunch with my dad. I already knew Uncle Sammy was dead though, or Dad would have had him with when he… came back. Anyway… I burned them.”
He nodded in satisfaction when the little feet pitter-pattered down the hallway. Bobby careened into the kitchen and half-fell half-leapt into her chair, grinning. A hole stuck out in her smile where she’d lost a tooth.
It was only then, when he knew Dean had returned to his room first, that Cas knocked and came in, handing Dean his beer.
She glanced at him and nodded, then went back to her rummaging, of course she’d noticed. She found another can of beans and walked back past him, picking up the pot she’d abandoned on the floor. She dug her pocket knife out of her jacket pocket and jimmied the can open, dumping the contents into the pot. She put it back on the fire and squatted to watch it.
Sam pulled the mask from Eddy’s face, raising an eyebrow at the dazed boy, “So, is that what you were up to? Scaring your cousin?”
He started to cry, shaking in his sobs. Claws broke through the door and their screeches filled the room. Ethan nodded.
She frowned in Crowley’s direction but shrugged, “There’s paper and crayons over there in that drawer, colored pencils too. Go ahead and use them up… I guess we won’t be here long.” Ethan scampered off happily to get them, dumping them out over the table and starting his art project.
Castiel sighed and lifted her out of her chair, carrying her back to her bedroom. His heart constricted gently when her head nuzzled his shoulder and she fell asleep before he’d even laid her down.
“Yeah, it was me,” her hand trembled around the dagger. She was breathing hard, she could feel the white light coming out of her wounds, the damage to her soul burning like ice in her blood.
Still, she kept Ethan right behind her while she knelt down like before and ran her fingers over each inch around the door, feeling the familiar carved sigils. She was almost to the other side of the door when her fingers ran over a scratch she had never felt before.
“It’s just a fish, isn’t it?” Crowley asked dismissively, leaning on the door frame with an eyebrow raised.
work, and it would be a hell of a lot better than killing people, but it would still be a hard time since Ethan had to do the actual killing. And it still left a lot of steps. Escape from the apocalypse to wherever they could get. Kill three people and get them to sometime where she could get to her family. Kill three more people to get Ethan back to his. And anyway, it still left Ethan slingshotting around through time on his own. It wasn’t exactly a watertight plan.
“Yeah yeah yeah big and lots of wings I got it. Cutest thirty-eyed monstrosity in the garrison, I bet.”
Dean wished he hadn’t left his beer in the kitchen but didn’t want to disturb the kid to go get it, “Hope so.”
He sat on the other side of the couch and sipped his drink, watching the cartoon play for a moment then paused it, “Hmm, a hard turn from your previous mood,” he said, with a raised eyebrow, ignoring his own capricious moods, “Might I suggest a movie that isn’t about a little fish missing his father?”
“You wanna help me carry some boxes upstairs, kiddo?” She asked, putting him down when they got into the back room that was always cold and dry.
It was late when they got back to the motel room and both of them were covered in dirt and smelled like burned hair.
“Come and get me!” Bobby shouted, slinging the sawed-off back over her shoulder and hefting her new crossbow instead.
“I - hm- I am surprised you told your child about monsters, I assumed you would want to shield her from that.”
She clung close to his leg watching him peel back the pull tab top and dump it into a plastic bowl to heat up in the microwave. When it was warm he poured it into a cartoon patterned bowl and set it in front of her at the table.
“Freaking werewolves,” he whined, letting himself pout only because he was alone. Oh he was bleeding a lot. Maybe too much. Maybe this was it.
They walked up the hall together, splitting off so Cas could go to the kitchen and Dean could go to clean up.
“I am aware of that, Dean. I told it as an allegory. It is appropriate to teach children lessons through stories.”
Crowley lifted an eyebrow, “Not just Ethan it seems. Sad that you’re stuck at the end of the world with a brat and the King of Hell?”
Dean gritted his teeth and began sewing Cas up like he’d sewn his dad up a thousand times, “Hey… can I ask you a favor?”
She smiled when she had her cooked meat in hand, juice running down her chin as she shoved meat into her hungry mouth. Not one of her dad’s burgers, but good.
Dean laughed, “Alright, I sort of got my ass kicked. I’m all better now, thanks to you. I ought to reward you.”
No longer mocking, voice having almost a tremor he explained, “I saw them come through a wall. Their claws just ripped right through it, along with my… the person I was with.”
Dean whipped around and gasped in pain, almost fainting how bad it hurt. Still, he managed to smile a bloody smile at Castiel, “Hey, Cas.”
He wasn’t sure his authority extended to physically stopping her from getting herself Lucky Charms so he was reduced to following her to the kitchen, “Bobby, you are to return to your bedroom and sleep.”
Cas looked up at him, face illuminated by the streetlight now that they were out of the alley, “Only if you must.”
Dean tugged him forward by the hip, pushing his trenchcoat off his shoulders, “Get this stupid thing off.”
She began to eat slowly, remembered she was very hungry and shovelled the rest of the food into her mouth.
Its ribs were protruding sharply from its abdomen, its belly distended and sick, limbs emaciated and shuddering.
Dean laughed and scooped her out of her chair, swinging her in the air and catching her properly, “What? Course not. Nobody’s got a cooler car than us.”
She stepped back and lit a match, tossing it among them. They went up in flame, heat blazing her face. She closed her eyes, letting the fire warm her, orange behind her eyelids.
He stood, coming into the light. He was older, a graying beard on his cheeks. He waved his hand at her with purpose, she glared, but nothing else happened. He frowned and did it again. He scowled deeply and snapped his fingers this time. She blinked and waited. Nothing.
“For fuck’s sake, Crowley,” she growled then laughed a little, “Alright, it’s burning out. I shot an opossum, care for something hot for dinner?”
“You know that mark on your arm? We’re looking for a way to take it off. Then, when you’ve got your mojo back, we can all get out of here. If we can get back to a time with more people to help I bet we can even get you back to your mom.”
“Is that what it was?” She asked, looking at her patched shoulder, tiny puffs of white smoke still coming up from the bandages occasionally, “Hurts.”
“Why!? Because we don’t have any idea how long it takes them to starve, because we don’t know how much of the boy’s blood they harvested to keep them sated before we took him, because
“Sleep tight, kid,” she said and turned on the nightlight, getting up. She should have offered to tell a story, but she didn’t have any. It’s not like he wanted to hear about the time she’d run out of gas for the bike ten miles out of town or shooting a coyote or celebrating her birthday with a plastic bear of honey she found in somebody’s basement. She left the room so he could sleep. Crowley followed her like a shadow.
She drew her leather handled dagger-claw and scampered back enough to stand, swinging it at Sarathiel and clipping her forearm. She screamed again and Bobby’s vision went black at the edges. It was not particularly loud, but it felt unnatural, her very soul shivered as her wounded shoulder stung like it was fresh.
He peered through the circular window set in the door to the Bunker and grinned, swinging it wide, “Hey, Cas.”
She shoved the map into her pocket and drove on, wending her way through the streets to find Singer’s Garage. Maybe the house would still be there, she could find photos of her family. She’d only ever seen one of Bobby Singer.
!? That is my bloody luck, of all the little maggots still left on the Earth it would be a Winchester.”
“Serves him right,” Dean says, winking approvingly at Bobby, “If you’re gonna hide in people’s closets and pretend to be a monster, you gotta be ready for a little hunter to kick your ass.”
She faltered many times before she could lift the corpse into her arms, struggling to keep her muscles from betraying her and dropping the husk to the ground. Instead, she pressed it to her chest with one arm, getting up to hobble down the ladder one armed.
A little growl snarled up from behind her and she turned without fear, it wasn’t the sort of growl she feared. A coyote snarled at her and she snarled back, lifting her arms and lunging. It scampered and she returned to what she was doing without any further care.
She shook the bowl in his face. Begrudgingly he took it and started to eat. “Your weapons are over there, in the bag.”
“I recall having told you that. He was in Hell for forty years, which, I am certain, was a trying experience. I besieged Hell’s walls and returned him to Earth.”
Dean wanted to stare but turned away, getting the groceries from the car and making Sam a PB&J sandwich.
She leapt back up and tagged along after him up the long hallway to the door that opened to the outside.
“Not a ton. We’re gonna need more stores. I’ll have to get them in a week or so. I’ll go as soon as we figure out where Castiel is. If he’s gonna try to jump me on a supply run, I at least want to have a heads up. But for now we’ve got some cans still, enough to fill our bellies.”
Dean wasn’t exactly inexperienced, but he had never felt this sort of stirring in his chest before like he did looking up at Cas. He felt like such a
“Shut up, we got to kill it to get you your own knife.” When he didn’t immediately respond, she handed over the shotgun, getting herself hunkered down under a tree where she couldn’t be swooped at.
Finally he spoke, although he did not look up from Mary’s little curls, “I believe that there is a ritual that can be used to stop them.”
The usual revulsion at beholding these soulless bodies welled up under Bobby’s skin when she drew near, but the situation was too close to how she had found Eddy and Mary to give in to it. She edged forward, looking at them, the boy was in denim overalls that hadn’t yet rotted away, the tiny girl was halfway beneath her brother, her clothing so small there were still snaps at the shoulders.
“Tulpa it is,” Dean said, feeling Cas’ eyes on him as he told a cartoonish and bloodless rendition of his and Sam’s adventure with the Tulpa in Richardson.
Crowley didn’t have a response, but flicked a sharp knife from his pocket, beginning on one of its hands to cut free its claws.
Dean lay in the smelly motel bed and shook. He was gone. Sammy was gone. And he wasn’t going to come back. He was gone on his watch and he wasn’t ever coming back. What if they never found him.
She stopped as soon as she saw a little gas station. She found a hand pump in the back of the garage and refilled her gas tank, stopping to open a can of chili from the storefront and eat it cold then grabbing herself a map.
Dean made a face, “Like hell you are. I don’t think angels usually get their ass kicked behind motels.”
She heard it grow its loudest not far off, then cut, and she heard shuffling and then footsteps through the grass approaching her. Thus, she was not surprised when Crowley spoke at her side.
He fidgeted and then looked back at Dean, “In my time observing you… I saw how well you cared for Sam. What you are willing to bear for his well being.”
“Bobby Winchester,” she said, looking for her leather jacket. She saw it over a chair and pulled it on.
Her shaking hands groped for the crossbow abandoned in the grass and she shot madly. Her last bolt did not betray her, but hit Sarathiel in the leg. She screamed and fell back. It bought her time to get to her feet and launch herself at Astor.
She got right to work when she woke, preparing to leave. She could have stayed at that house and hunted more deer, but she couldn’t ever stand to stay anywhere too long, the feel of the too dead bodies got to her without fail and she would move along.
Just as she did so, Castiel’s face erupted outside the window and she flinched back away from the door. His face was slightly distorted through the thick pane of glass. She stepped closer again and faced Castiel. She could hear his claws scraping the door, his face contorted in a furious scowl. She set her grimace like stone, watching him. She knew he couldn’t see her from outside, but she still felt observed. Backed into a corner.
Astor was still speaking to the other Baby Ray who remained in the house. He was turned away from them, facing the open screen door. Bobby crawled on her belly again, dragging herself as stealthily as she could to the next car. She’d be visible to the house for about a second when she went from one row of cars to the next. It was over if they saw her. Even armed with dagger-claws, she doubted she was a match for Astor, well fed as he obviously was. She might get her dagger between his ribs, but surely he’d get his own claws between hers too.
“It doesn’t matter right now,” Crowley said, glancing back at Castiel who finally smashed the door open, silhouetted in the door, wings outstretched, claws bared.
The bathrooms had been meant to house a team of men in the fifties, but her dad had installed a tub when he decided to raise a kid here. She sat the boy down on it and ran warm water.
As she knew it would, the sound of the gunshot split the quiet air. Red burst from where the deer had been hit but she’d hit its belly, not its heart. The deer bolted, blood splattering the grass where it ran.
“Let’s get you washed up and in a real bed, huh?” she said, carrying Ethan down the long hallway. “Watch the doorway, Crow, there’s a -”
Bobby’s blood ran cold as Hannah’s head turned to look in their direction. She tugged on Crowley’s arm and fell back to the dirt, crawling under the car, him right behind her.
been nice to have another person around. She, however, found it difficult to be anything but relieved. She listened to the quiet around her after his motorcycle had stopped rumbling, enjoying that she could hear the wind in the long grass.
“Dean, I meant what I said. All will be well. After a bit of rest I will ease the tension in Heaven. Your daughter, Bobby, will not come to harm. I give you my word.”
The boy was pale, with wild dark hair, slightly matted by blood. He gasped when he saw Dean illuminated by the flickering light. Blood ran down the side of his face, but if Dean didn’t know any better he would say that his eyes, shining a spectacular blue looked… reverent.
“What are you? A Hunter?” Astor asked, touching down. Sarathiel touched down twenty feet away, stalking in a wide circle around Bobby.
Nothing came and she relaxed for a single moment until she was forced to watch Crowley try to make the same journey. He wasn’t nearly as athletic as she was and he couldn’t manage the quick roll she’d made, crawling instead, moving so madly it would have been funny in any other circumstance. Instead, it almost made her heart stop.
She went over to it and picked through it, putting her knife in her belt and slinging her shotgun over her shoulder, wincing when she had to move her right arm.
Cas sincerely hoped the light was too dim for Dean to see how his cheeks blazed, “As you wish, Dean.”
“You still have your hunter’s gear?” He asked, watching Dean start sorting out spell supplies and ammunition and an assortment of artifacts he’d gotten over the years.
“I only mean that it seems… after all that I have done… I should not be able to hide somewhere that is so enjoyable.”
It dragged itself up and stalked toward her, claws clicking on the road. She reached wildly behind her toward her bike, grasping for her gun’s cold barrel.
She couldn’t resist laughing at him again, “Jesus, didn’t you need to be able to handle a gun as a demon-king? Or did you just snap your fingers at everybody?”
Dean stood for a moment in the blistering cold, wad of cash warm in his pocket, then turned back and walked away from the truck stop toward the grocery story.
“I’ll be alright,” she said, with no idea if that were true, “I’m gonna clean up the kid. There’s whiskey in the library if you want it.”
“So there’s at least four here, probably more,” Bobby whispered, “Hannah, Astor, Thaddeus, and this one that I don’t know.”
Still she waited, she waited for many long minutes to pass before finally sneaking back out the door and toward the bike outside. She lay flat on the floor by the window and pressed against the wall, looking up to see as much of the sky as she could. She saw nothing, but that didn’t mean it wasn’t there. The buildings all around her now looked ominous, so many broken windows to hide in, walls to swoop from behind. What had she been thinking, coming here?
“Stupid thing,” Dean grumbled, zipping up his jacket, annoyed he had to wear it inside a gross little motel room.
Cas did not look offended, “Now that you know I am not, perhaps… I could sit down. I fear I may fall.”
She pulled her jeans on and grabbed her packed backpack from under the bed, “To sleep in Ethan’s room.”
She’d been reading for maybe two hours with absolutely no luck when she took mercy on Ethan who was falling asleep in his hard backed chair, “You hungry, kid?”
Ethan followed her to the kitchen, scrambling up onto the counter and sitting happily while she opened cans, “Bobby, can we watch more movies after we eat?”
Dean hadn’t wanted it to go like that, he’d missed the stupid angel. He wanted him to like Bobby and like staying here, but as soon as he was in front of him he just felt bitter he’d been away so long. He was quiet carrying Bobby to her room for bed, ignoring the friend he had been so excited to see only moments before.
Dean got up and shoved his feet into his boots, leading Cas outside to a dark part of the motel parking lot.
Cas did know, and did not make him explain himself, “Dean, working while your daughter is safe and cared for by an angel of the lord is not the same as leaving two children to care for each other in a motel room.”
“The boy must be special somehow,” he said, “They talked about spellwork and obviously they need his blood for it.”
Dean sat back down, not making eye contact and touched the hem of Cas’ shirt, “You gotta take this off if you want me to patch you up.”
Dean heaved a sigh and looked at Cas, beseeching and sorry all at once. Cas smiled a little and tilted his head, a happy concession to a change of plans, communicating in a way Dean was familiar with.
“Of course, Dean, I would not leave her here unsupervised. If there were no choice but to leave the Bunker I would bring her with me and ensure her safety.”
Dean leaned against the refrigerator and sighed, then grabbed a bag of chocolate chips to add to the mix, “Unrest in heaven… I know what you said last night but, you bringing me back into this shit?”
She finally got up and edged out of the store, eyes on the sky, scooting foot-by-foot to the bike. Halfway there she broke into a run and swung herself onto the motorcycle, kicking it to life and turning in a fast circle to race at top speed out of the city. Normally she didn’t like to accelerate this fast, waste of gas, but now she gave it everything the bike had.
She looked over at Crowley who was crouched behind a car a few feet away and shrugged, dropping to the dirt and army crawling one car closer to the house. When she was safely behind it, she came up to look through its broken windows at the front door.
“I remember when I was a human I preferred to sleep in darkness,” he said, “You have also told me as much.”
“Angel fledgelings are slow to fly, but they can do far better than you, of course, as you have no wings. But the rules are simple. Your goal is to capture me. When you have accomplished this, my goal is then to capture you.”
The shot sniped through the joint of one of its wings, making it spiral, careening off to the side and smashing hard into the ground. It was not down long, pushing itself up and screeching at them.
Sick of old cans of cold vegetables, it was time to hunt something. She found a squat house near the edge of town and looked up the wall, trying and failing to get a grip on the faded plastic siding. She growled in annoyance and tried scaling the gutter, yelping when it tore from the wall and she fell to the ground beneath her, nothing hurt but her pride. She pouted and swore then spent a few minutes scrounging around the shed in the back and hauling a ladder out, leaning it against the house. She scurried up it and pulled herself awkwardly onto the roof, getting to her feet and walking to the back. She lay on her belly, facing what was a vegetable garden once, now overgrown,  and took a few minutes to settle in with her rifle. She didn’t get to use the rifle much, just for this really, she’d have to start looting more ammo for it, she would only need it more.
“I dunno why you came into my room in the middle of the night, s’why I asked.” She rubbed her eyes sleepily.
She slashed wildly, Baby Ray blood spraying out as she struck home. Astor stumbled but did not fall. Claws bit across her back, slitting open her jacket to flay her skin. She screamed, falling to the grass and rolling away from the savage, clawed feet.
Cas kissed him and pulled the blankets over them, brushing his fingers through his hair, “Dean... I’m sorry for the times I have not been able to come.”
He glanced at Cas again then disappeared into the bathroom. When he returned in a clean t-shirt and sweatpants Sam was peppering Cas with questions about heaven, which Cas was politely answering while trying not to drift to sleep.
She smiled at the name, “Sure. Headlight and noise from the bike for all them to see and just darkness for us.”
She kicked him off and stumbled to her feet. Her injuries to her arm and back shrieked in pain; she felt torn asunder. She could not look away from the dead monster at her feet. If he could have been killed before Cas had acted, none of this needed to have happened. Her head throbbed, pain lancing down her spine, her wounds impossibly cold.
Dean picked Cas up, Cas’ legs wrapped around Dean’s waist as he carried him out of the Library and down the hall toward his bedroom.
Cas frowned but didn’t want to call Dean barely a few hours into his stint as caretaker just to complain she wasn’t listening to him.
“Sure, all the weapons are locked up tight as usual. Safe as a daycare in here. Come on, we gotta talk.”
She seized Ethan’s hand and ran, rounding the corner down the stairs and slamming right into Crowley, almost knocking him over. She grabbed his arm and hauled him along, “Crow, they’re here.”
She did as she was told, pushing her empty plate away from her. “Does he have a cooler car than us?”
“Six hours,” she said again, getting him situated, “Tug on my arm if you get too tired or need to pee.”
Bobby grabbed Ethan and Crowley’s hands and ran deeper into the Bunker. There was no way out, but she couldn’t just give up. She could hear the large, winged monsters struggling through the halls, weapons and books being knocked everywhere. They screeched, ear-splittingly, and Bobby stumbled.
Dripping with black blood, she inspected her gory prize, a black claw the length of her forearm, sharp and glinting in the sun.
Bobby pulled her motorcycle to a stop next to Crowley who was scowling and nursing a split lip. Black smoke wisped out of a slash across his chest and his pant leg was torn, his leg scraped up from calf to thigh.
He helped him up, “Alright, let’s go get an icepack and we’ll talk about why this was a cruel thing to do.”
Cas smiled at him, a small and tender smile, “Of course, Dean.” He let his knee continue to rest against Dean’s. Dean looked away, but didn’t move his knee.
She got up when Ethan did and found him a new t-shirt to wear, “Let’s go get breakfast,” she said, “Come with me to check the sigils and then we’ll eat.”
Sarathiel hadn’t cleaned the blood off herself;  dried now, it stained her twisted form as she circled, advancing on Bobby. Astor mirrored her on Bobby’s other side. She was going to get pincered.
“Napping. I believe that is healthy for one of her age. She requires more than your own four hours of rest.”
“Thaddeus,” the companion answered, “The boy is tired. We cannot drain him now. Hannah will need to stay hungry.”
He shoved his bruised face into the pillows until it stung. Sammy was on his own. Anything could happen to him and nobody would be there to stop it. How stupid was he?! A demon had come hunting him down once, who said another demon wouldn’t take advantage of this and grab him while he was all alone.
Bobby waited, needing a clean shot, the creature plummeting down down down, larger and larger, eyes glistening with greedy desperation for Crowley’s excuse for a soul.
It was just in time. Astor turned back from the door, the other Baby Ray at his side, finally visible. This one too was well fed. Blood caked her mouth, smeared down her bare chest. Bobby gripped Crowley’s arm. The blood was red and fresh.
She helped Ethan undress and get into the bath, giving him soap to wash up with. She left him to it and went to her old room to get clothes suitable for him. He was a little smaller than she’d been when her dad had died, so she had pajamas that were meant for someone his size.
Dean felt the quotes around the words he’d used six years ago. Guilt and bitterness rose in equal parts in his gut. He continued to not say anything, but he was making pancakes with an odd intensity.
She turned. Horror and filial longing rose within her to look upon him. His hair was as it used to be, dark and messy. His eyes the same blue. The rows of teeth distorted his face, but even so she could see Castiel in his features.
“Hunger is not the only thing that makes Hannah how she is. She was created too late. Maybe we should just be rid of her.”
She picked him up, wincing. He wasn’t heavy but her wounds from the fight throbbed. In her experience with these sorts of wounds, they never stopped throbbing.
Incredible thanks to chemcat92 for her work storyboarding and beta-ing this story. She is an asset and a brilliant editor!
The gunshot reverberated through the cold air and the monster was knocked back, gasping for air, chest a bloodied mess.
She took a decorative bookend off the shelf behind her, brandishing it. The wound in her shoulder made her right arm basically useless, but her left was fine.
The hallway was very dimly lit and Dean was not moving to take them to the library or war room to talk. Even bloody as he was, he was not shoving his way to a quick shower and bed. Castiel found himself not minding the limited space available in the hall, so he said nothing about it.
Crowley crawled up beside her, glaring curiously at the one-time-angel, “Did you know Astor? Annoying little piece of work.”
“Are the sigils inscribed in the walls of the bunker insufficient?” Cas asked, following them as they continued to Bobby’s bedroom, “Why are further sigils necessary?”
She whipped the sawed-off into her hands and shot him. The buckshot ripped through his wing and sent him spinning, hitting the frozen ground hard.
She set up the tv to play after he picked, pathetically grateful that the Men of Letters’ magic held out well enough that they had power in this tiny den. It was almost possible to pretend the world still existed.
“Hey, dumbass, if you don’t want my dad to know you’re here we better not let it get out that there’s a dead guy with burned out eyes behind our motel.”
She didn’t go upstairs, she didn’t need new clothes at the moment and the second floors were starting to be unstable in places, no need to risk it now.
“Good because warding is a delicate business, one scratched out sigil and the whole house of cards comes down.”
“You must understand, were it my choice, I would. You do not get to choose where you go next, do you?”
He should get his phone, try to call his dad. Sammy was at Stanford, he couldn’t help. And he wouldn’t want to hear his big brother die over the phone.  His phone was in his jacket across the room anyway, might as well be a mile away.
“There was a - wait- dammit,” he shoved Sam back onto the bed and grabbed his bag, rifling wildly through it and storming back outside with a gun and flask. Sam, of course, followed him.
“Unfortunately, there may be. A new prophet has been awoken. She has revealed a number of… complications. The most pressing being that the seal on the Cage can be broken with ‘the last shimmer of grace from the seraph who touched the soul of the Righteous Man’.”
Another Baby Ray, Hannah maybe, stumbled from the house. She moved differently than the other two, more like the others Bobby had seen: her head jerking and wings stretching, sniffing like an animal. She screeched, jaws unhinging like a snake as she howled, her voice forcing Bobby and Crowley to cover their ears.
Bobby shrugged at Ethan, “Alright, buddy, let’s go and watch our movie, your turn to pick this time.”
is in that panic room. To get a soul all the way to Kansas? I am not certain. And I would not see the boy himself removed from his containment and taken to the Bunker, Thaddeus warns that he is canny and longs for freedom. He has come close to escape on his own already”
“Yes,” he said, eager when Dean looked at him in understanding, “They have been with me at every moment. I wanted to come before you were hurt, I could not. I only just got away.”
Dean bit his lip, then acted before he could think through the implications, he leaned forward and kissed him.
They turned and fled back the way they had come, Castiel himself looming in the passage to the main entrance. There was no way out.
She waited until she could feel Hannah, her shoulder throbbing as the Ray howled. Two others were behind her, not diving yet, but she didn’t take her eyes off Hannah long enough to identify them.
He screeched and swung at her but she was fast enough to dodge, lashing out with the dagger and slicing him across the chest.
“I’m sorry about that, Cas, I was angry, I shouldn’t have said that stuff to you. It was a long time ago… I missed you too.”
“Yeah, get out of here.” She slid off his lap and let him kiss the top of her head then she raced off.
“I think you broke some ribs,” Dean said, getting a wash rag and wetting it in the little sink by the microwave, “Not a lot that I can do about that.”
He stared at her from the grass, breathing hard, bleeding badly, a look of shock and pain distorted around his teeth.
“My dad used to take me on these long drives. We’d go to see my Uncle Sammy. He lived like three states over but we’d always make it in one night. He said he liked being in the car.”
“Course you can, want me to tuck you in?” Bobby asked. Hearing the parental words coming from her own mouth made her feel strange. She recognized maybe she should feel like she was stepping into her father’s shoes, but she didn’t. She felt a lot more like Cas, not sure what to do. Her father was always so certain.
“I know. I pay particular attention when you are sent to hunt on your own. Three werewolves was a hefty task with no companion.”
“We will be there shortly,” Cas said into the walkie, pressing the talk button with his hand over Dean’s.
Crowley carried on as if he hadn’t heard her, “Then, perhaps we could give his abilities to someone else.”
“When you start shaving your armpits you can,” he grumbled, “Why don’t you watch Cas, he’s doing the spell stuff.”
“Dean… if heavenly unrest spills onto Earth there will be no way to stay out of it… whether I were here or not. I did not come for nothing. I would have been content to be in the Bunker alone. As I said… I did not expect you to have inhabited it.”
Cas grinned even while he shivered in pain, “I would be in a great deal more trouble if I were beaten quite that far.”
The man had once been big, but he was light enough to carry now, desiccated as he was.  Bobby lifted him easily off the hardwood floor by herself. His Carhartt coat flapped open when she carried him out, laying him to one side of his children. At least this time she could carry him and did not need to drag him outside by the armpits. By the time she had their mother, it was well and truly dark. She returned to the kitchen only once more, now needing to use precious battery life on her flashlight to find what she needed.
Cas drew back, fearing he had grossly misstepped, “Dean, I - I did not mean to imply you were… violent with your partners.”
“Not looking your best,” Bobby mumbled, circling it, lashing out with her knife every time it tried to strike, “What? Can’t clean yourself up? Seen you do it, what’s wrong now?”
“Yeah, me too,” Dean said, “Alright, she oughta get up from her nap now anyway. How’d you get her to go down?”
“I don’t need these,” Cas sat next to him and cupped Dean’s cheek in his hand. Blue light burned through his body and he felt his wounds heal and the drying blood disappear.
“I said you could stay, just shut up.” Dean picked up Bobby who had gone quiet, “Your old room’s all made up. Washed the sheets.”
“Yes,” Cas said and shimmied up the bed until he could sit, leaning on the headboard, yelping in pain.
The man walked straight toward him and Dean came to a halt. He thought he was ready for this. Holy shit.
Cas heard Bobby wake a little past two in the morning, his awareness of her aura and soul alerted him that she was frightened, although she remained firmly in her bed.
“Burn through all that grace of yours?” She taunted, scuttling backwards now that she was unarmed, trying to get to her bike. It leapt at her and she tumbled back down the ditch, scrambling up its embankment ungracefully while the creature pulled its claws from the mud where it had landed. She ducked when its wing tried to catch her, falling to her stomach on the tarmac to avoid it, scraping her knees and palms.
She walked forward and shoved him back against the couch, seizing the knife off his belt roughly as he squabbled with her. She got it half lifted to bear before he got his hand up to her wounded shoulder and dug his fingers into the holes left by the beast.
Cas was unmoving for a moment too long and Dean wrenched himself back to flee. Cas seized his collar and flipped them around, slamming him into the wall and kissing him with decades of hunger. The lightbulbs above them shattered into a thousand sparks as Dean dug his hands into Cas’ hair, groaning like a wounded man.
is saving people. Hunting things is… incidental to this larger calling. A necessary labor at which he is well trained, not the mission of his soul.”
“She’s living in a Men of Letters Bunker, what’s she not gonna find out about monsters? I’m just trying not to, you know, scar her for life with gruesome stories.”
Dean laughed, leaving the food to pick up when he got Cas back. “I’ll call my dad, he’ll know what to do.”
He scooped up the burgers one at a time with the spatula and dropped them onto buns, carrying the plates over to the table.
When she was beyond convinced it was dead, she rolled off of it, sitting up. She wiped her hands on the long grass then grinned at Crowley.
Her heart stuttered. She pulled a flashlight out of her pocket and shone it on the scratch. An angelic warding sigil was where it had always been, but a new, ugly scratch ran deliberately through it, breaking it irrevocably.
Crowley read his own books a table over, the two of them working in companionable silence for a long time. Her eyes began to itch finally and she snapped the book shut, “You find anything on the sigil?”
The movie was maybe ten minutes in when tiny Mary appeared in the doorway in her footie pajamas. Her fluff of hair and big hazel eyes looked so much like Sam at that age that Dean didn’t have the heart to send her back to bed.
“You are very much like a fledgeling. Come, I believe that a popular game amongst them that can be adapted for you.”
Bobby frowned and crouched down to his level, brushing the hair out of his eyes, “You don’t want to see your mom again? I thought she was nice.”
She tried to scramble up, searching for her knife but not finding it, a yell ripping from her throat.
“Yes, I understand,” Castiel said, “As I said, I will be fine with her if she will be fine with me, she does not know me well.”
“I think-I think I require… assistance.” The voice sounded like this was a foreign concept, but it was young and more lost than angry, not exactly like an angry spirit.
Crowley made a face. She supposed she should split the beans with him even if that meant both of them would still be hungry.
He didn’t say anything, just picked up the plates on the table from dinner and ran a sink of water to clean up.
“Me, specifically. If I were back to my full strength I could almost certainly overpower it and not get thrown around through time.”
He took her hand and they walked together to the cozy living room. She’d seen every movie in here ten thousand times, but Ethan hadn’t and she was looking forward to spending some time with the kid.
“I patched you up last time, didn’t I? Where did you keep your arsenal? I need some spell supplies.”
“What Dean? Stooooop” he whined, annoyed and confused when Dean rushed in and threw his arms around him, crushing him in a hug.
“Not what I’m talking about, Cas.” He waggled his brows, “We’re here, alone. Can any of your keepers see you?”
“Cas? I miss you, buddy. I didn’t even get to see you last time. Just… is Sammy ok? Do you know? Can you give me a sign or something?”
She thought a second then brightened up at an old memory of dinner with her father.  She said, “Sweet Baby Rays.”
He shifted in discomfort, “It has been… difficult to keep the peace. They want a real leader, an archangel.”
She spent an hour looting the other houses in the cul de sac, then siphoned some gas for her bike before heading back out.
They both lunged at the same time. She plunged the dagger down but he caught her wrist, his claws slicing into her skin. She dropped it, catching it in her left hand and drove it down into his thigh. He dropped her wrist and scrambled back, falling and pulling himself away from her. She doubted the wound would be fatal but he’d taken her dagger with her.
Even more thanks than usual to chemcat92 for her work storyboarding and beta-ing this story. This chapter is much cleaner for her efforts.
Cas waited for Sam to leave with Eddy before speaking on her behalf, “She’s frightened, Dean. She was under the impression she was in a genuine battle.”
She held the crossbow firmly. The tips of the bolts replaced with Baby Ray claws didn’t fly particularly straight. He’d have to be close. He seemed to understand this and kept his distance.
Cas laid down on the bed and pulled Dean into his arms, “That is almost the opposite of the question I believed you were going to ask.”
“Sammy?” he asked, voice strangled. He almost dropped Cas in his haste to get back to the motel room.
He gathered his nerve and turned on his flashlight from his pocket, going down the alley until he saw the body. It was a big man in a dark coat, he was crumpled on the ground. Where his eyes should have been were smoking burnt pits. But he reeked of sulfur. Definitely a demon and definitely dead.
