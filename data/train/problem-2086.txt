“You’ll send me a copy, yeah? Once they’re printed?” John asked Mummy as he looked over her shoulder, giggling at the pictures on the camera.
“Hardly.” John nodded and tapped his fingers against the table. “Moran probably didn’t bother to ask about her children. He’s…”
“Ahhh,” John scrubbed a hand over his face and looked at his mother-in-law apologetically, “Sorry mummy. But you know what they say about Doctors and their handwriting. I'm afraid it's true, at least in my case.”
“I consent,” the dark mage only glanced in his direction while John watched this scene with curiosity. He had never had to be present for something like this, and, to be honest, he did not know how to react to what was happening or how to behave as one of the partners.
Examining her blond hair, pale skin and well proportioned figure, he still couldn’t make up his mind. Perhaps they should have looked at each other a little more, though he could clearly see interest in the witch's gaze.
Without waiting for an answer, he walked with a confident step to their bathroom and in the dim light of a single lamp tried to examine himself in a small mirror above the sink. Sherlock walked behind him and silently watched the changing expression on John's agile face.
“Um...Thanks?” John took a last sip and leaned back on the spartan chair. Having decided to take what was said as a compliment, he had no choice but to silently agree with the obvious. He, too, considered his face expressive, which could not be said about the dark mage across from him. His rather indifferent face was usually animated by emotions for a narrow number of reasons, as John managed to find out during their, although brief, time together. And all of those reasons, as a rule, were associated with his Work. And experiments, which, however, were also part of the Work.
Walking past the dirty shop windows and shabby walls, he now began to notice simple signs everywhere; they embellished the gray walls of the houses and fences with their cheerful yellow color. On these streets, he saw himself as he once was, abandoned and lost, looking for something without the ability to find. Unlike many, he was lucky to escape from those monotonous days, and now around him, branching and swirling, a luminous stream was cascading; now he could not only clearly see it, but also touch it. John bathed in him, as if, for the first time, enjoying his invisible touch on his face and hands not hidden by layers of clothing.
“Oh, that's alright, I'm used to it. Besides, I was looking forward to your visit. Inspector Lestrade warned me... However, I must confess, Sherlock didn’t say anything about you. How long have you been together?”
“It’s not getting easier…. Wait,” John hesitantly stepped his feet dressed in warm socks on the cold light tiles of their bathroom, “If you need Mycroft's intervention ...”
Surprised, and disturbed by this unexpected concern, John knew and had time to appreciate how much Holmes valued him, but he was still amazed every time.
“John, I won’t hide, you have an impressive resume. And though we desperately need specialists like you, I believe that your talent is simply too exemplary for us.”
“Um,” John ran his hand through his hair in confusion. He didn’t believe a single word from the Necromancer sitting opposite, but he could not prove otherwise. “You can't leave them to roam the streets freely.”
The hand, falling confidently on his shoulder, of course, could only belong to Sherlock Holmes. Suddenly John was pulled and firmly pressed against the tall figure of the dark mage, who shielded him from both the curious glances that they were now drawing and from involuntary collisions with other passers-by. Walking beside Holmes was even better than holding hands with him, so they became even closer.
“I don't even doubt it. Your handiwork?” John cautiously peered into the side window, but the other side of the tinted glass reigned complete serenity, as if there was no pursuit behind him, and he had made everything up for himself.
“Everyone who came today,” Patrick said, looking around. “We have twenty minutes until we’re missed. Will it be enough?”
“... I have no doubt that it is something very boring, but I could not refuse,” Holmes sighed, obviously dissatisfied with the work ahead of them.
John rubbed the amulet in embarrassment again, but didn’t look away. His answer was so hasty that even a deaf person would have guessed that by it, he meant something completely different and not that he had time to tour his future place of work.
“I saw you at the meeting,” the same Asian woman, whom he had took note of at the meeting, caught up with him. “You certainly didn’t come there for salvation.”
He only had one tactic left in reserve, but the most damning argument he had, he hadn’t wanted to use now, even if he could, but obviously his choices weren’t so rich, or rather he didn’t have any choice at all. Besides, it was necessary to act quickly before the young Inspector was cursed or worse.
Walking confidently through the courtyard, he stepped forward into the dark opening of an old building in the temple. The chamber was semi-dark and had the scent of candles, old wood, dust and incense. Finding his way through the dark by sound and relying more on his senses than sight, John walked the entire first floor, getting used to the local magic. The magic that filled even the air in this place, was just as primordial as it was alien and inhospitable both for young students, who still had little understanding of the very essence of what was happening to them, and for him, who had the experience of past years behind him.
“You see, the secret is buttermilk. If you don’t have buttermilk just mix a little vinegar in with your milk and let it curdle for a few minutes.”
made it halfway across the room. Sherlock’s clothes, had been kicked under the very table that was supporting the lanky man, and it was with a deep satisfied chuckle that John saw ribbons of Sherlock’s come covering his own clothes. He almost wished he could be around when he explained those stains to Molly. And try as he might, he couldn’t find the riding crop, so he decided he would leave that for Sherlock to find, and bring home. (His coat was longer anyways. Easier to hide it under.)
“Dunno.” Sherlock shrugged then cast the suitcase a dirty look. “I’d rather we stay in bed the next two days.”
“The uniform is a bit wrong…Sorry, Mike. It’s Watson-Holmes now.” John smiled and sat down with a bit more grace next to his husband. “He’s right though. Not staying. I’ll sign the release forms.”
“Mmm. Yes. I couldn’t think of what to get. Already had this one,” John nodded to his right shoulder where he had a coloured version of the Royal Army Medical Corps insignia, “Nothing else stuck my fancy, really, until I thought of you. And how much you loved bees. It seemed only fitting once I thought about it. But…” he added a bit hesitantly, “ Darling, I’m quite cold. So either take me to bed and cuddle me until I’m warm, or let me put some clothes on and devour a whole pack of biscuits before I devour you.”
“Don’t bother knocking,” Sherlock purred, still content from their lazy morning. They’d had a bit of a late night. He’d made John declare, in numerous positions, just exactly where home was. “Don’t I know you?” He eyed the slightly graying man for a moment then his eyes lit up in recognition! “Oh yes, you’re that copper my brother paid off.”
“I do, all the time. My mind is constantly racing, looking for the next puzzle to solve, for the next equation. But when I look at you…” he shook his head, “John I can’t figure you out. You’re an anomaly, and I love it.”
“Ready?” John stood waiting by the door, waiting for Sherlock to get his coat. “Let’s go,” he said when Sherlock gave him a nod. Outside he raised a hand in the air and called for a taxi. Sherlock was oddly quiet beside him. Once seated inside the cab he looked over to give Sherlock a quizzical look.
“Keeping my pants? Really, Sherlock?” John laughed and rolled over onto his side so he was facing his husband.
“This…” Sherlock looked up, tears welling in his eyes and noticing their surroundings, “this is where I leave you.”
Your letter could not have come at a better time! We had a bit of excitement here last night. At about 2am local time the sirens went off, indicating incoming wounded. I'm the Chief Assistant Surgeon here, so when the sirens go off, it's my job to be there when the wounded come in. (Assistant just means I get the crappy hours and I guess if I'm being quite honest, extra work.)
John grunted as he, with Sherlock’s help, maneuvered himself back up onto his feet. He let his hand linger in Sherlock’s for a moment before pulling away to straighten out his uniform, more out of habit than anything else. He stood at parade rest, arms folded behind his back, and grinned.
“Not as dumb as he looks.” Sherlock blurted out, then rolled his eyes when John hissed a warning to be nice. “I'm simply saying that he is correct. I spent 8 months locked away in this prison, and I'm anxious to be free of theses walls. So please, can we go?” Sherlock made a show of checking the time on his new mobile. “If we leave now we should have enough time to have lunch before taking you to the airport.”
“No. You…wouldn’t. I know you wouldn’t.” Sherlock pressed their lips together and ignored a catcall from one of the patients.
fix this for your brother.” Mrs. Holmes brandished the spatula at her eldest son this time, and John had to stifle laugh at the sight.
"That was gorgeous, love. Had no idea you could play, let alone play like that." The sofa dipped beside him and he felt curls brush against his chin seconds before the weight of Sherlock's head came to rest on his chest.
Nearly tripping on is own damn towel from his shower that morning, the very towel John had asked him to pick up no fewer than five times that day, but he’d left it there just out of spite after the third time. (He had been going to pick it up, just hadn’t found the right time.) Regaining his balance, and somehow maintaining his hold on John, Sherlock kicked the towel aside and let out a relieved sigh.
Not exactly one for modestly, spending a year living with other men who walked around with their balls out, (Sometimes more literally than figuratively.) John had no qualms with changing in front of other people. Nor did he have anything to hide. In fact, this could be fun, even if not exactly sexy. So without giving it much more thought, he dropped his clothing onto the coffee table and began unbuttoning his camo fatigue jacket.
“Oh, well I’ll just have to do something about that now, won't I?” John chuckled and let the hand that had slowly been caressing over Sherlock’s back dip lower until he was able to grab an arsecheek.
After finishing with the mobile’s insides, Sherlock brought his attention to the outside. Turning the device over his his hands, Sherlock swiftly removed the case, thereby revealing the tracking device inside. Rolling his eyes at such a poor attempt at subterfuge, Sherlock promptly removed the device before casually depositing it in Mycroft’s tea.
There wasn’t much time to lament over such an annoying fact as Mycroft, as well as, Mrs and Mr. Holmes brought their presence into the sitting room.
Had the music not reached a particularly sad note, John might have laughed at the sight. Sherlock, his crazy impossible Sherlock, was swaying around the sitting room, eyes closed. With a tiara on his head. The very one he’d been wearing in his picture. He leaned up against the doorframe and watched as Sherlock pulled the most hauntingly beautiful song out of four strings.
I love you, John. Enough to sift through Google for sappy things to say to my husband. God knows I can’t let you be the only romantic in this relationship.
Did you know bees communicate with each other through dance? Such knowledge is what most likely fueled my own interest in the art of dance and music. Also, did you know that the sting apparatus has its own musculature and ganglion, which allow it to keep delivering venom once detached. The gland in a honey bee, which produces the alarm pheromone, is also associated with the sting apparatus. The embedded stinger continues to emit additional alarm pheromones after it has torn loose. However, when it comes to defense against larger insects, such as predatory wasps, such defense is usually performed by surrounding the intruder with a mass of defending worker bees, which vibrate their muscles vigorously to raise the temperature of the intruder to a lethal level. That, along with the increased carbon dioxide levels, kills the attacker.
“Suit yourself.” Slightly disappointed, John covered it up by tilting his head to the left and gave Sherlock a filthy wink before undoing his fly and pushing his trousers abruptly to the floor. He kicked them a side and stood there, in front of Sherlock, in nothing but his black boxer briefs,  socks, and dog tags, and watched with a rather smug look as Sherlock’s eyes quickly found his new tattoo. “Not too corny, is it? The tattoo?”
“Hold still then,” grunted John as he grabbed onto Sherlock’s hips. With a loud sigh he pushed in slowly, only stopping when his thighs were pressed flush against Sherlock’s arse. “Jeessuss… you’re always so
“So, Mr. Holmes, is this how you’ll be treating me over the next few days?” John pretended to fight against Sherlock but gave up with a forced huff and a wink then nuzzled his cold nose into the crook of Sherlock's neck, “Knocking an injured man down, I do believe I'll have to get you back for that.”
My father, of course, was the more sensible. He didn't say much on the subject, but assured me that he was happy I had someone to talk to. I never cared much about having friends, however I know it upset my father, especially when I was much younger. He attempted to soften the blow of solitude by letting me get away with much more than I should have. Looking back, I am most certain that I took advantage of that almost regularly.
“Bend over, hands outstretched, flat on the table. I suggest you don’t reach behind you, unless you want your fingers to get smacked with the crop. Now,” John purred, watching as Sherlock positioned himself over the table, arse up in the air thanks to his long legs. “How many swats do you think a broken toilet is worth? When you broke the stove it was 25. But this a much bigger inconvenience. We’re now out a toilet until
Alone in the living room he let out a deep breath and grinned. He grinned like he’d never grinned before. He wanted to jump for joy, to shout to the heavens, to tell the whole world just how very a happy he was. Not because Sherlock Holmes had just given him one of the best orgasms of his life, though that did help matters a bit, but because he was here, with Sherlock and despite the awkward first few moments, things were perfect. He walked quickly to his bag, not for one moment caring that he was in his rather soiled pants. Once he’d acquired clean pants he found his way into the bathroom and cleaned himself up a bit before changing. Part of him wanted to jump into the shower now, having gone at least 24 hours without one, but between not having a proper meal and a recent shag, he was starving.  Food first, shower later.
“Even my soul became brighter... You know, John, I'm more and more glad that you decided to choose us.”
Such self-confidence irritated him, if he wasn’t more or less accustomed to Sherlock’s antics and behavior, then Holmes senior irritated him a little and sometimes even frightened him.
“Explainable. I would never have had the strength and talent to repeat something like that. By the way, how old were you when you wrote it?”
Mycroft said goodbye to everyone politely, giving Sherlock a final eloquent glance, then hurried away. Perhaps something important was really waiting for him, Sherlock didn't care much, and so in the near future they were to have another close communication, only this time without John.
Receiving consent from each of his little pupils, he once again took hold of the hands extended confidingly to him.
“I am not doing this on purpose.” Here, he didn’t even twist his heart, but nevertheless hurried to transfer the conversation to another and more burning topic. “Those yellow marks? Do you know what they mean?”
Sherlock sighed as he let his head fall backwards into the bed, his right hand flicking the air in John’s general direction. “Please, John. I am perfectly safe in your capable hands.”
I feel like I've had this written for ages. Waiting to post it was torture! Hope you enjoy it! -Tindo
“That’ll make for a long flight,” Sherlock remarked. Eight and a half hours strapped in a noisy cargo bay did not sound like an enjoyable flight.
It worked surprisingly well. John only gave a soft grunt, then buried his head deep into the pillow, not seeming to notice that his husband had moved. Pressing one more kiss to the back of John’s head Sherlock smiled then shrugged on a dressing gown. He loved moments like this, where all was quiet, including his brain - still foggy from sleep, where he could simply cherish the moment. He quickly sorted the image of John, naked save the blanket that covered his arse, spread out on the bed into his mind palace. Unable to help himself he softly ran two fingers down the curve of John’s spine, causing the sleeping man to murmur something inaudible into the pillow.
Once most of the lube had been rubbed in or dried up John softly patted Sherlock’s rump and kissed his shoulder.
“But we need to find the women!” John protested, dragging his fingers through his hardly there beard.
“Horny bastard!” John chuckled then tucked the riding crop under his right arm, freeing use of both hands. He made a show of unbuckling his belt then ever so slowly began unbuttoning his trousers. When he reached the last button Sherlocked reached out to help but John stopped him with a click of his tongue.
“Mm. Not quite. But we can at least be physically comfortable for the time being.” John kissed the side of Sherlock's head then wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s tense form. “So… where does our story begin?”
“Now….” Sherlock, long legs and heated eyes, walked up to John and took his husband’s face in his hands, “where were we?”
As interesting as I found flora, there was something else that would soon consume me in a way I never thought even remotely possible. Bees. Bees John! They came in droves! To watch such a large insect land upon such fragile petals, and not disturb a fraction of their structure was amazing to observe. My child mind thought that it might have been a fluke the first time I observed one, but further observation proved I was most incorrect. I then noticed them leaving each flower bathed in said flowers pollen, only to continue on to the next as if nothing was amiss! My mummy explained to me the importance of bees and pollination at this point which, I am not ashamed to say, spurred my continued research.
While Sherlock wasn't prepared for most of what John was suggesting, he knew there was at least one activity they both were more than up for. Maneuvering himself until he was practically in John’s lap, Sherlock raised his hand until just the tips of his fingers were pressed against John’s chin. He lightly pressed until John’s focus was no longer on the fire, but back on where in truly mattered.
He’d woken early, the sun was still just an idea the early morning sky was toying with. Rays of yellow-pink light filtered through the morning fog, trying to break through like it did every morning. Sherlock watched, fascinated as the sun changed colour and actually broke free of its cloudy prison. John stirred as a patch of light illuminated his face, golden light danced over his face, catching in his blond hair, making his tanned husband look like a Greek god. Sherlock sat up properly and ran a hand through John’s hair, then after a moment when the patch of sunlight had moved to some other part of the bed, he reached for his laptop.
“Oh, aren't you looking thoroughly debauched already.” John smiled, and ran a hand through his hair, sparing a moment to wonder if his hair was as messy as Sherlock's.
” He pulled at Sherlock’s collar and growled when the metal splints on his fingers hindered his ability to unbutton Sherlock’s shirt.
I promise, John, that I will tell you everything there is to know about school the moment it has been finalized. Until then, I would like to keep this to myself. I’m nervous about not being accepted, I didn’t have the best marks in school. (I may have spent my last few years informing my teachers that their homework was dull and not worth my time.) I’ve taken my entrance exam, and while it was incredibly easy, I am still nervous that high marks on that exam will not be enough. I am a bit of a problem student, and while I do wish to change, my track record up until now does not speak highly on my behalf.
“As do I. I think I’ll stuff it with a pillow, get a balloon and draw a face on it. Call him John 2.” Sherlock grinned, waving the jumper around in the air, always just out of John’s reach.
For the love of Chuck, and our sanity... if you see typos, please kindly ignore them. We are both running ragged and had to push ourselves to get this chapter to you.  Our schedules (mine work, B's School) are making it so we have little to no free time, and we use that small chunk of  "me time" to write.
” Sherlock chuckled at the sharp hiss the emanated from his brother’s corner and propped himself up on the arm of the sofa.
John stepped back from Sherlock and took a long hard look at the detective. Gone was the posed and refined posh man. He'd been replaced with a naked, half beaten, sexually deprived animal, and oh how John loved it. He stuck his hand in his left pocket and pulled out a small packet of lube and tore it open with his teeth. He poured a large amount into his hand and coated his fingers, stepped close to Sherlock and pushed his fingers inside, coating Sherlock entrance liberally. The rest he squeezed onto his cock.
P.S. Sorry for the currently shitty handwriting, but I’m out in town about to post this, and I'm using the back of a mate for a “table” to add this postscript. Might be a bit odd… but I found this golden elephant quite interesting. Maybe it’ll help brighten up your room a bit?
Mr. and Mrs. Holmes waved as they drove off, and Sherlock snickered as he inspected his love bite in the mirror. “You outdid yourself, John… This one will last for weeks.”
“Turn around and stick your arse out, arch that gorgeous back of yours for me, spread your cheeks.” John made a turning motion with his index finger and his lips quirked into a half smile as Sherlock scrambled to obey. In a flash he was pressed against the wall, arse out and hands reaching back, spreading his arse so John could see his hole. Without any fanfare or dirty talk, he lubed up his finger and began teasing Sherlock. He circled the tight knot of muscle, slicking it up as he went. Sherlock moaned but kept his restraint, he didn’t push against John’s finger when it skitted over his entrance. Instead, he stood as still as he could, breathing hard against the kitchen wall.
“If we must.” At the mention of his parents, Sherlock’s demeanor seemed to immediately go back to his usual dramatic, seemingly put off self. He swiftly grabbed his suitcase and began practically dragging it out of the bedroom and into the hall, a dramatic groan of displeasure clearly audible over the awkward maneuvering of his overstuffed suitcase.
“Well, I was going to say inconspicuous, but yeah, that works too,” he unbuckled and pushed his door open. “Come on, let’s go see Mike.” John had to lean back into the car and fix Sherlock with a stare, silently commanding his husband to get a move on it.
“Your arrest records are public knowledge, William Sherlock Scott Watson-Holmes, and yes your brother did mention them. No, he has not asked me to watch over you, and no he hasn’t paid me off.” Lestrade glared at Sherlock and thrust his hands into his pockets. “Now if you’ll excuse me….”
“Boys!” Mrs. Holmes scolded as she sat down, then shook her head at her husband as he entered the room.
more.”  Sherlock reached over John and placed his wine glass on the closed basket and grabbed John’s plate and began to pile it with food, not listening to John's protest of, ‘That's enough, really. For god's sake are you trying to get me fat?’ Instead he handed the plate over and said cheerily, “Let’s eat, before it gets cold.”
“Um…. what?” John asked, hanging his coat up and going over to where Sherlock was waving a photograph in the air. “Hold still, I can’t exactly see it when it´s flapping about now, can I?”
“Not shy, no.” John grumbled as he fell back into step beside Sherlock, “I don't take kindly to being watched while getting intimate with someone. That's all. Remind me to punch his nose.”
We don’t want to lose any readers, so don’t force yourself to read something that may or may not trigger you. We love you all and don’t with to upset  you.
A small smirk of triumph appeared on Sherlock’s face as he brought down a rather large package of chocolate biscuits. He reached around for a plate as he continued to converse with John. “You do make a good argument. However, the sofa would be much more comfortable than to continue standing here in the kitchen, better place to converse.”
If he understood everything correctly, now the dark mage acted only in the role of an assistant. Unlike last time in the apartment of the late Mr. Wang Kun, there were no dark, lifelike tapes of ribbons, which he firmly associated with Holmes, just as there was no pressure of strength. John felt only faint discomfort, as if he had to sink into the depths, and now the water column pressed on him, but no more.
He didn't even notice how everything was quiet; Sherlock was only worried about the man breathing heavily in his hands. Mage. The Healer John Watson, who kept himself on his feet only thanks to the arms that grabbed him, and Sherlock would give a lot to be such a support to him as often as possible. And as soon as he thought about it, John pulled up, exhaled silently and straightened himself free from his embrace.
“John, dear, you were being prepared to become a vessel,” Mrs. Hudson was the first to break the heavy silence.
Looking around in curiosity, he shouldn’t have been surprised that amidst such a public group there was always someone who stood out even more than he for his interest in everything that happened. A girl with an Asian appearance immediately attracted his attention as soon as he crossed the threshold of the spacious conference room. There was something wrong about her, like he was looking at a distorted reflection. He too, probably also looked strange among all these people who came for fake revelations, but without the opportunity to look at himself from the outside, he could only make assumptions based on his feelings. All he had left was being glad that Sherlock wasn’t there; he was even too afraid of imagining how Holmes’ appearance here would end. At the least, as a disaster. That is, he would exactly look like a black sheep here. Or more correctly, a black raven. Imagining Holmes sitting next to him, John hastened to hide an involuntary smile, pretending to yawn.
“Well, be it your way. But then don't say I didn't warn you. Let's go. I want you to take another look at the bedroom.”
“I didn't think it would be this interesting, it's so nice to be wrong sometimes. Your help was providential”
This unexpected message shattered the charm of the moment. And this had already happened to him, it seemed, quite recently. He’d once before received, just as sudden, a message from Sherlock, while standing at a crossroads. It amazed him how Holmes could feel his hesitation and uncertainty, as if they were really connected. And this particular point was definitely not in their contract - an uncomplicated text even on enchanted paper simply couldn’t give such opportunities.
“I've already checked the movements of the victims in the past few days. Immediately after returning to London, both visited Chinatown. Right where the Black Lotus is. The conclusion suggests itself.”
“Usually John insists on the observance of etiquette, but now he is a little confused. Forgive him this time. Sherlock Holmes, John’ partner,” Sherlock held out a gloved hand to greet the witch frozen in surprise. “Consulting dark mage.”
“For a while, a similar effect will arise from any use of magic,” explained Mycroft, looking curiously about the induced mess. “In the future, something similar in manifestations is possible only with strong emotions, although this will then come to naught. I recommend you see a Healer you know; your lungs bother me, John. And the kidneys. I think these are the consequences of prolonged contact with a cold surface, but, besides this, nothing irreparable to your health was caused.”
“What will be our next step?” John, as usual, had to adjust to Holmes' wide, quick stride to keep up.
“This was not ritual suicide,” John knew for sure, because as soon as he crossed the threshold of this apartment, a faint dark shadow rushed towards him. The one who until recently, was Mr. Wang Kun, now trying to grab his hands, invariably passing through him with an unpleasant chill along the spine. The only explanation for this fact he could give was that he, himself once crossed the line between life and death, though this was the first time something like this had happened  to him.
And not only did he not like what was happening; his shackled magic thrashed uneasily, trying to free itself (1). He did not succeed, but he could see how the threads that fell on him began to glow, until this light began to spread further. Once again during the evening remembering the old dragon, he, of course, could not help remembering his words and how his magic reacted to the treasures collected by the ancient magical creature. Only now, instead of gold bars, cups and coins, there was a web, but the reaction was the same.
“We have an appointment at three, hurry up, change your clothes.” The dark mage promptly got his bearings in this situation, in which he was more than ever glad about. Starting a quarrel wasn’t part of his plans for this particular day, and in principle, it wasn’t ever part of his plans, but after entering into an unexpected-in-every-sense partnership with a consulting dark mage, he once and for all swore not to assert something with one hundred percent certainty.
Of course he was still far from applying Sherlock’s deductive method as effectively as his partner, but he still knew some things. Without the ability to read someone else’s aura, he could have gone the other way. What he learned from Holmes in the first place was what clothes, shoes, amulets, and charms could tell the most about a person. Therefore it was to these things that he now paid his closest attention to.
Which was not surprising, given the peculiarities of the local magic, to which he, too, took time to adapt. In addition, the temples usually did not have special rooms for studying, which were available in schools. As there were no special textbooks and manuals - nothing that would help these children to learn, John wasn't even sure if half of them even passed the First Registration.
With a theatrical gesture, throwing back the flaps of his expensive dark coat, Holmes simply stood between the legs of the murdered man and spread his right palm over him with wide-spread fingers. For several minutes, nothing happened, until the dark mage reached out his hand in a bright blue latex glove to the pale neck and, squeezing the dead man's throat, lifted it above the bed. John swallowed involuntarily, shaking off the phantom sensation of cold, strong fingers holding his own neck.
Making a living consulting other mages and Ministry Agents could have been a lucrative pursuit, if only Holmes didn’t find most of their clients boring, stupid and not interesting. To which he constantly pointed out in his usual manner, further aggravating his already existing unflattering opinion of himself.
Their faces were so close that it would have been enough for him to just stretch a little forward to touch those full lips. He almost mustered up the courage to take the plunge when Holmes stopped abruptly and let him go, puzzling him and even coming off as slightly offensive.
The sleepy mind refused to cooperate, but it stubbornly continued to think in the same direction, listening out of the way to the skull's story and even nodding and assenting in the right places.  In John’s eyes, the magic object had too much free will, already making it truly unique and inimitable, as any other thing that the dark mage undertook. It was only logical to assume that this skull talking to him was a reflection of one of Holmes’ sides, but that was as far from the truth as… John thought for a moment about a possible comparison. This was as far from the truth as the claim that Holmes the younger was not a dark mage, and the elder was not a Necromancer.
He seemed to indeed be the last visitor. It was surprising that he wasn’t asked to leave the Library earlier; he didn’t remember if he was assigned any special status for visits. Although, with the Holmes, one could expect anything - even a limited visit to the forbidden sections.
John slammed the laptop shut and turned his full attention to Sherlock. In someone else's request, he stubbornly heard the desire not to listen to his conclusions, but Holmes' desire to just listen to his voice. And it was not the first time that he caught himself on such thoughts, which meant that his inner conviction, most likely, did not deceive him.
Finding a job he could keep while with Holmes had been second on his list of priorities after the appointment of the Inspector. If he had more or less decided on everything with the Inspector, then with the Work, everything was much more complicated.
As soon as they exited the cab that had stopped at the sidewalk, the answer itself appeared before him in the form of another modern building with a bright spacious foyer and serious security at the entrance. Only a blind man would not have noticed the huge inscription of cast gold letters.
When the kettle whistled behind him, he even decided to show generosity, knowing in advance what Holmes’ answer would be.
Not surprisingly, the hospital still persisted no matter what. John felt no echoes, no alien presence - only peace. Both the location and the layout were certainly wonderful, and John decided to mention it in his casual conversation with Healer Sawyer.
Failing to deceive Sherlock with a hastened innocent expression, John could see he was still disappointed and angry, and not without reason. John’s communication with Dimmock had not given the desired results; the Inspector flatly refused to appear at the next crime scene, which meant John couldn’t get in, unlike Holmes. Personally, it didn’t seem so important to him, knowing that the dark mage would do just fine without him. Although he still had to do something with Dimmock. His indecision, cowardice and disgust could later seriously complicate their life, as, for example, now, when they were forced to go to the morgue instead of examining the crime scene.
The silence in their living room was  rarely comfortable. Usually it was disturbed by some suspiciously gurgling experiment, a skull chattering about everything or a bored dark mage. Even John himself did his part every now and then by turning on the TV or listening to music on his laptop or phone. In their living room one could constantly hear the rustling of the pages of books or newspapers, or the slight crackling of magic charges in the fireplace, where Sherlock again sent them out of boredom. Clients came to them quite often, which, amidst other things, seldom meant that they stayed for more than a couple of minutes. Mrs. Hudson dropped by often to just chat, or tidy up a bit, or bring some fresh baked goods.
Artifactist Su Lin Yao, who remained to await their return under the supervision of Mrs. Hudson, proved to be pleasantly helpful in diverting John's attention unto herself. She could even be useful to them as a specialist, Sherlock decided. It’s a pity that they still couldn’t avoid Mycroft’s visit, and Sherlock was even ready to stoically endure his brother’s presence - he was sure to be useful to them. He had already dropped several calls from him after his short message, which undoubtedly should have greatly surprised Mycroft - Sherlock was rarely the first to initiate contact with him of his own free will, which now explained both the insistent desire for him to talk on the phone, and the appearance of an inconspicuous ministerial car on their street.
“There is no longer any need for a hospital. I wrote to Mycroft,” Sherlock reassured him in a voice slightly hoarse with tension.
Holmes never named his Class using just this streamlined wording, and surprisingly, it worked every time; others took it for granted, which invariably amazed John.
The pleasant face expressed only awkwardness, John himself was a little uncomfortable, so saying a crumpled goodbye, he hastened to return to Baker Street, to the familiar chaos, piles of books, a comfortable sagging chair by the fireplace and a dark mage dissatisfied with the course of the investigation.
Suddenly, a timid whisper ran through the room. Having rushed into the classroom, the mentor first of all looked around everyone with a displeased glance, only lingering on John for a short while.
Whistling softly, he waited. This signal, of course, was taught to him by Holmes, but before now he had not had the opportunity to use it, so John doubted a little whether he did everything as he should have.
John gritted his teeth and exhaled heavily. Neither visual inspection nor checking of activated spells gave him any clues. No matter how much he sought, he definitely saw neither suicide nor the ritual of sacrifice. The most logical thought was that this was a message, but even for a sophisticated message, the ritual was too intricate, and the tragedy that happened here was more like a punishment. He didn't know why he was thinking about it - just the first thing that came to mind when he looked at the runes used, and how and in what order they were drawn caused him to associate with an indicative punishment.
Barely audible children's voices merged into a monotonous hum, reminiscent of a mournful prayer, and he suppressed the childish urge to shout out something to get rid of this impression, at least for a moment. Today, weak spell threads led him down a hallway to a spacious, dimly lit room in which they were to spend the entire day with one single lunch break.
Interested in the words of the elderly witch, he listened to her, while the heavy envelope with the coat of arms of the Ministry of Magic beckoned him to look inside. But the strange, inadvertently dropped words once again reminded him that the woman scurrying around in their kitchen was an unusual witch, and the envelope could certainly wait a little longer. He already had a good guess about the nature of the message lying inside.
“Anthea,” the brother commanded in his usual manner, which at times drove Sherlock to a frenzied, uncontrollable desire to break or set something on fire when they were children. However, having matured, little has changed for him.
“Both recently returned from China, and both flew there for work. Mr. Lukis wrote an article about rare artifacts; Wang Kun was on a business trip for the Exchange.”
So far, everything said at this so-called meeting for those wishing to join didn’t go beyond the standard propaganda, though the last words were alarming. John endured with the last of his strength. All the same, he wouldn’t have been able to get up and leave, despite being in the last rows. He had checked specifically; at the entrance were two fellows of outstanding proportions and physique on duty. The guys were clearly bored and quietly talking about something, but it was still unrealistic to slip past them.
Now that the dark mage's attention was occupied with a new idea, John could catch his breath with relief. Convincing Holmes was suspiciously easy, but he wasn't about to look too closely at it. He just had to rejoice at such small gifts of fate.
Ah, this. It meant that the young Inspector either heard about him, or he, himself encountered Sherlock. And John has already heard similar words in different variations more than once. John could admit, at least to himself that it was naive on his part to hope for something else, based only on the beautiful weaving of runes.
Finally, his young guide stopped and respectfully pushed back a partition so John could step into the twilight of the opened room. It smelled of some kind of spice and tobacco, the two scents mixing with the delicate aroma of a flower unknown to him. He looked around the room with a quick glance, but didn’t notice anything superfluous; two mats and a table, and the main decoration of the dark room, a weapon. It gleamed dimly in the faint light of the setting sun sparingly making its way through the open shutters.
Looking at his only suit, hanging lonely in the closet between T-shirts and sweaters, John could only sigh dejectedly. He had even a specially purchased shirt that went well with the dark brown corduroy fabric. True, so whatever he didn’t choose from his meager wardrobe, it all was the same - in the presence of Sherlock, only a sad fate to look like a poor relative awaited him. Though he saw no point in dressing up for a commission; his task was definitely not to amaze anyone with his appearance. He assigned this role to his partner, whose reckless behavior was the reason for receiving a summons for a hearing at the Ministry.
“Another victim was caught in the Spider's web,” although the words spoken were part of the performance, John was shocked to shiver by their ominous meaning.
“Yes Yes. These strange murders. We’ve had few past ritual sacrifices, so now there are new ones. Do you think this is another dragon? Or some other creature?”
He looked down from a bird's-eye view, and his heart ached from unexpectedly surging sadness. A barely noticeable path wriggled between rare stunted trees, hidden in the withered grass to finally disappear into the forest. Sometimes there were dazzling black flowers in the grass. Like spilled ink, they spread across the ground in black specks in intricate patterns.
“A vessel or a phylactery (2),” Mycroft explained in a pleasant voice, his eyes fixed on him. “And yes, I agree with you, Mrs. Hudson.”
Now he never missed the opportunity to see more, although he still had too little practice to draw the right conclusions. But even what he had learned from Holmes, told him that his would-be Inspector was a neat, cautious and rather vain mage with average abilities and great ambitions.
It was hard to believe that even if it was such a strong smell, he would have such a reaction. And when he also began to feel a little nauseous, everything finally fell into place. John covered his nose with the lapel of his jacket and glanced back at the door. He should have expected something like this, knowing from Holmes and Lestrade what the Black Lotus really was, but he still wasn’t prepared. He didn’t tolerate various drugs, even the most lightest, and right now any filtration rune would help him but he didn’t dare to do anything at this moment.
“I think at twelve you can start reception already. Just a couple of hours to get into the regime. How do you like this plan?”
Chance allowed him to meet a pleasant young witch who emigrated, according to his estimates, no more than five years ago. She had a stable and well-paid job, meaning that she was a highly qualified specialist in her field. She was also not quite human. He lost his step, but immediately pulled himself together. He might be wrong, but the more he looked, the more he noticed details that were insignificant at first glance, speaking in favor to his unexpected conclusion.
Patrick leaned closer, as if he was about to share an important secret. And judging by his next words, for him it was so.
John sucked in a gasp, a sudden idea coming to mind. He now knew exactly what to do and how to help the little disciples in the Temple. The solution, obvious in its simplicity, hadn’t come to his mind on its own, because he had never even tried to share his magic with anyone else. But he wouldn’t be engaging in healing, so he could even succeed, or rather, he should definitely try and see what would come of his venture.
“Moriarty - Necromancer?” John winced as if from a toothache. It was easy to guess, sharing life, shelter and work with Healer Watson, how much he did not like the representatives of this Class. And Mycroft, to Sherlock's delight, was still no exception.
John, on the whole, was not against Sherlock's often tactless interferences in his affairs. Moreover, their concluded contract tied them together, binding them to new obligations and restrictions in their shared lives. The dark mage, like no one else, knew how to dilute the gray, boring everyday life. Though he certainly wouldn’t have had any objections to ending his conversation with Dimmock with some kind of agreement instead of a curt, hasty goodbye. As a result, Holmes' appearance marked not only a new case, but also possible problems for John with his new Inspector in the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, he strongly suspected they were in any case, waiting for a lack of understanding to happen. And it wasn't only about Sherlock Holmes, albeit for the most part, the reason really was him. For himself, John decided to go with the flow and see where it will take him.
“Sherlock, I haven't eaten anything since this morning,” John explained patiently. “And now I'm starving. If you want me to be of any use, then we'd better have a bite to eat somewhere.”
Now, while Sherlock was immersed in thought, he had time to do his daily business. Prepared to wait patiently, John went to his favorite dreaming forum. Over the past few nights, strange, disturbing dreams began to trouble him, the content of which he could only vaguely recall upon awakening. This puzzled him in earnest. Having mastered several simple techniques of lucid dreaming and diligently keeping a dream diary, he even got used to some extent, to remember and then write down everything he saw in a dream. Now, after awakening, he had only a few vague images and a restless premonition somewhere in the solar plexus. Perhaps, in the near future, he should use the leaflet with the advertisement for the courses he found between the pages of a textbook bought at a sale. And to also go look at the courses themselves, and the Temple where they were held. He had specially checked and wrote out the address in advance so he could go there on occasion.
He really liked Sarah Sawyer, although she was far from Sherlock’s standards in terms of talent or eccentricity, he hoped that she would be able to gain his approval. Unfortunately, no matter how strange it may sound, without it he couldn’t have any relations with her, not even as colleagues. In fact, he wouldn’t be able to have any relations with any witch or mage, if they weren’t approved by the dark mage. John frowned, one would involuntarily get the impression that he had returned to about twenty-thirty years ago, when he was still living with his parents and had to look for their approval regarding new friends or each new passion. The comparison didn’t inspire and once again made him wonder what his life had become after meeting one particular dark mage.
(1) Ranunculus is a genus of annual or perennial herbaceous plants of the Buttercup family. Aquatic or terrestrial herbs with acrid, sometimes poisonous sap.
(1) Divine artifact - an item created by the mages of Antiquity  and possessing a unique and enormous magical power, comparable in its power to the Source. For example, the Orb of Vulnerability is a divine artifact that, when activated, makes it impossible to use magic at all or in part, depending on the strength and skills of a particular mage;
As soon as the darkness dissipated, and the magic lights hesitantly rekindled, fulfilling their intended purpose, it became clear that the show would not continue. There was no longer the glowing circle of the arena, the shimmering cobwebs, or the acrobats, just as there was no Sherlock, only the lost and puzzled faces of people who now looked at him with suspicion and bewilderment, waiting for answers.
John looked out into the living room, the skull on the mantelpiece was barely glowing with the familiar blue flame. But it still didn’t try to attract any attention or start a conversation, which meant the dark mage most likely wasn’t in the bedroom, as he first suggested when he went downstairs for breakfast. No, he was in one of his pockets.
“Strange, I don't feel anything,” John was surprised. He gently ran his fingertips over the sore edges and shrugged his shoulders.
“I...” John was not very fond of sharing his thoughts with a genius mage; more often than not, he turned out to be wrong, about which he was immediately informed. But Holmes constantly insisted on this, arguing that it helped him to think, and also that John needed to practice more.
Not hearing the characteristic clink of dishes or the uncomplicated melody which Mrs. Hudson usually liked to cook with, the likelihood of getting something homemade and tasty for his morning tea rapidly dwindled to zero, unless the elderly witch had gone to the store early this morning. But he didn’t remember hearing the front door slamming downstairs, meaning no one had come in or out. Sighing sadly, John knew that while Holmes’ deductive method was extremely useful, he, personally, would rather not bother with any unnecessary thoughts. One could only wonder how the dark mage managed to do this all the time.
As far as he remembered from the general theory, only another divine artifact could extinguish the power of a divine artifact, but their interaction could lead to unpredictable consequences, so he definitely needed something else. And affordable.  Something that, if one looked through the systemic mess residing in the living quarters on Baker Street consisted of, might actually be useful to him.
“In a couple of houses up from here there will be a cozy cafe, if you have some time, maybe we can stop by?”
It wasn’t surprising he had a complex, difficult character - living, while seeing constantly, analyzing every little thing and drawing conclusions, was rather tiring. Besides, knowing everything at once and in advance was also quite boring. As soon as one realized and accepted this simple fact, both Holmes’ behavior and his attitude towards people and to life immediately became clear. In his fight against the incessant boredom, the dark mage grabbed every and any opportunity to distract himself and occupy his active mind.
Only vaguely John knew what he could do to help his young companion. He could only rely on his childhood experiences. Even now, everything was different for him, and the necessary stages of meditation he practically could not feel - they merged for him into a single moment. It was enough just to reach for the luminous pulsating stream, and he knew for sure that he would not take more than he could use.
Inspector Dimmock didn’t even try to hide his displeasure or misunderstanding of what was happening. His whole appearance more than eloquently said what he was thinking of both of them, and about the situation in general. John didn’t want to be tagged in his personal file for refusing to work with the appointed Inspector, but it seemed that everything was inexorably going in that direction.
Sherlock calmly sat down directly opposite his brother and froze in his usual manner, folding his hands under his chin in prayer. And while both Holmes were busy with their silent dialogue, glancing at each other, no matter how amusing it was to watch them from the side, John chose not to waste time in vain and carefully looked around.
Looking around uncertainly, he reached out and caught several circles of bright confetti in his palm. Withal to the black ash, a red suspension fell and whirled around him, more of a bloody rain, of course the comparison would be complete only if there was water instead of paper, but even so, he couldn’t get rid of such unpleasant associations.
“It’s another reason why I can only take a few shifts a week. My contract does not imply so much free time,” Here, he definitely wasn’t being cunning. “My partner and I work as consultants in the Ministry of Magic.”
Pulling back the bottom of his jacket, and shrugging in uncertainty, even tying a tie, though he couldn’t stand them, now and then reaching for the narrow piece of fabric to loosen or tighten the knot, indecisive on how he was more comfortable, John genuinely couldn’t make up his mind.
“I have had it since birth and I have it now. Therefore, I foresaw that you would come someday,” the Master got up, his silk robe pleasantly rustled, while the spicy air swayed and mixed around them. “I had a vision.”
Looking at the golden flashes in the other's hazel eyes, John already guessed what Artifactist Su Lin Yao was going to ask him. There was only one thing left to clarify.
Beyond the door, a familiar image awaited him. One couldn’t even argue that they had the case for it to be familiar. Sherlock, with his hands folded under his chin in a prayer’s gesture, was reclining on the sofa and in no hurry to give any signs of life, which lasted until John came closer.
The suburbs of London in the predawn haze seemed to John something unsteady and unreal. A gray fog masked the ground, covered with a carpet of fallen leaves, and he could only wrap himself in a light jacket and regret that he had not dressed warmer and that he had once again forgotten to put a spare sweater in his rucksack.
The tight, fleeting embrace was a revelation for him. But he didn’t even have time to enjoy the feeling of Holmes’ broad shoulders or narrow waist under his palms, as Sherlock quickly slipped out of his hands. At least, pressing his cool lips to his ear, the dark mage in a hot whisper managed to inform him of his further actions:
It all ended as suddenly as it began. His heart sank down and then jumped up to beat convulsively somewhere in the throat. The pressure disappeared, and he felt an unprecedented lightness, and the only thing that still held him, not allowing him to leave the floor, were  Sherlock’s soberingly cold fingers.
No one grabbed him by hand, but he still felt out of place, occasionally bumping into someone, and out of habit, apologizing. Once again dodging a collision with an elderly man walking mindlessly somewhere in an incomprehensible direction, John decided it was time to start the main part of the assignment he received from Sherlock. The longer he remained in the street among all these people, the more it began to seem to him that he was being haunted by other people’s greedy looks.
On the whole, pleased with himself and the end of the evening, he simply walked down the street. Keeping an eye out for familiar yellow signs, his eyes stumbled upon the only one on the entire street, under which was a poster advertising the Lantern Festival. After photographing both the poster and redrawing the sign so that he could send it off to Su Lin, with whom he had exchanged contacts, he took another close look. But nothing else caught his attention.
The leaflet, hastily shoved into his hands, didn’t arouse any interest in him exactly, until he tried to crumple it up to throw it away into the nearest trash can. Black paper with a simple text stubbornly continued to straighten no matter how much he squeezed it. The only eye-catching thing about it was a bright blot- a strange yellow mark that seemed vaguely familiar to him.
Even after a few days, Sarah Sawyer hadn’t lost her charm, though after their last meeting and the several intense days that followed, he almost didn’t have time to even just remember or think about her. This realization was a little upsetting, but now he had the opportunity to make up for lost time in the peace and quiet.
People around them had already begun to pay attention, and John had no choice but to forcefully break free and hasten to hide behind the nearest turn, hoping that nobody would pursue him. He quickly looked around, now he had to make a detour to get to the former curator, but that was better than facing an unexpected obstacle again.
Such an answer couldn’t help but be puzzling. Either he was unlucky enough to stumble upon charlatans, or, on the contrary, he was lucky enough to get someone reliable. In short, he decided to find out more when he met the supposedly awaiting Master, to whom he was so diligently led.
“I didn't know that she was the Scribe,” John whispered to him, fascinated by what was happening. He sat unmoving at last trustingly hugging Sherlock.
“I'm ninety-nine percent sure of that,” Sherlock decided to leave one percent to his share of mistakes, yet he had to make them sometimes.
“Our killer is breaking in through the walls,” John muttered, displeased. He carefully examined all the locks on the doors and on the windows - nowhere were there any signs of burglary. With his limited experience, he could only assume that either those killed in both cases let their killer in themselves, which meant they knew him, or he got inside, and then disappeared, leaving no trace in an unknown new way.
"You've received long ago what you came here for. But you're still here, even if Mr. Holmes isn't conducting any investigation.”
Instead of answering, Sherlock waved to the taxi driver, refusing his services, and silently stepped back into the stream of people, which involuntarily made John want to smile.
John could barely keep his eyes opened; it wasn’t part of his plan to fall asleep, but neither the strong and sonorous voice of the orator, nor the harmonious mutterings of the people gathered around him helped to relieve his numbness and stupor. Even realizing that he should have listened carefully and memorized the spoken words, he still couldn’t help himself - he had already missed most of the speech.
“Well, I have a little doubt there. You are watching me too closely, more intently than usual. Trust me, this won't make me eat faster.”
“Mmmm... Yes, someone did an excellent job at the time. Look here,” with his fingertips, John touched the thin ligature invisible to the uninitiated eye, and a thin, barely audible chime spread around them. “The evil that is attracted by pain and suffering can never overcome this barrier.”
“Amazing,” he was able to praise Holmes as naturally as breathing. Because it was easy, he was brilliant and amazing. The most amazing mage he has ever met.
At his touch, the runes sang harmoniously, and a faint pulsation ran through the delicate weave to return to him with a tangible tingling sensation throughout his body.
For two weeks now, all his free time was occupied not only by one particular dark mage and their joint affairs. Despite the license, without a new Balance, he risked a lot, using even the simplest everyday spell, and his case was so unique that he did not know who to turn to for help. Having lived like this for about a month, he was already seriously considering options for  evening classes. When Sherlock offered to use the services of one of his acquaintances, John didn’t even think to refuse. And he couldn’t imagine that his consent would eventually result in trips to the suburbs and communication with young mages and witches.
Watching the limp, weakly trembling hands and thrown back head, it was hard to believe that this man was really dead. Especially not when the still recent corpse suddenly opened its eyes and began to shake its head.
“One of the parts of the Sphere of Harmony (3). This is indeed a rare artifact, considered to be long lost. You have no idea what it would mean for the scientific world to find it!”
John watched London from the cab window. The city was dazzling with its assorted houses, fencing and signs. In the interweave of streets, there were sometimes green islets of alleys, and occasionally one could see gardens laid out right behind the hedges, and nothing was more pleasing to the eye than the glimpse of greenery amongst the gray concrete or red brickwork.
The call distracted John from eating his breakfast, turning his head towards the door, he waited with anticipation for the appearance of the elderly witch. Though she never tired of reminding them that she was not their housekeeper, she was still constantly indulging them in homemade food and pastries. Now, John involuntarily sniffed, wondering what she could be bringing this time.
A pleasant familiar scent had been floating around the room for some time, John, straining his memory, nevertheless remembered what it reminded him of - sandalwood. For those who came, sandalwood had been burning without stint, and from its tart scent mixed with incense, he almost immediately began to feel dizzy and had watery eyes.
Two murders, two suicidal rituals, and two messages. All this led to unhappy conclusions and required a thorough investigation, which, judging by Holmes' mood, they should have been doing already.
Mrs. Hudson was far more interesting to him now, than what the Ministry wanted to tell him and Sherlock. Firstly, few people could endure Holmes and his behavior for so long, John considered himself a rare exception, and thus confirming the rule. Secondly, despite her fading aura, he could easily read it, but even so, he still couldn’t identify her Class. Now, it was somehow embarrassing to ask about it, especially after so many months of acquaintance, and Holmes, only smiling mysteriously at all of his questions, and in his usual imperative manner, advised him to think with his own head, to apply his deductive method. John had even tried to do it a couple of times, but each time, he suffered a crushing defeat, though he decided not to give up until the last. And as a last resort, he could always repent, apologize, and ask directly.
“Promise you’ll come back to me?” Sherlock begged, wrapping his arms around John's back and pressing his face into the crook of John's neck.
Right, so when I say buzzed, I actually mean sloshed. Properly pissed. Three sheets to the wind. I don't even remember half of what I drank. Now, I'm not saying this to brag. But to paint a picture for you. So there I was, drunk and on what I can only explain as an emotional high, and one of my friends had an idea. He’s going home soon, which was the reason for the night out. He wanted to get a tattoo. Something to show off to his wife when he got home. In my drunken state, I agreed to get one with him. Apparently my intoxicated self has excellent taste because my second and newest tattoo reminds me of you. Did you know that I already had a tattoo, Sherlock? Shall I leave you to deduce what they are and
on his list is possibilities. Not that he minded such an outcome. John certainly didn't if the noises he was making was any indicator.
“No, thank you.” Mycroft took a sip of his coffee then spit it back out as if it had personally offended him. “
Thank you madonna_and_mermaid for the idea of  John holding up Sherlock during sex, and or face smushed against a wall so Sherlock can’t talk!!!!!!!!
"Shame... musicians should never be kept from their instruments. Exceptions in my case, that is. My version of playing the clarinet is more like, the sound a deflating balloon makes.
At some point, without either of them realising it, they subconsciously reached out and held hands. John’s thoughts were spinning, there was so much he could say, so very little he wanted to say, and the silence was… perfect. Sherlock seemed to agree, and for another five minutes, neither of them said anything.
The head finally stopped swinging from side to side, and now blind eyes were looking directly at him.  He barely suppressed the involuntary urge to take a step back. What was talking to them now was definitely not Wang Kun's summoned soul; his faint shadow still huddled fearfully against him, not even trying to get close to his own body.
“Who stole the Key, did it meaninglessly, considering it a simple trinket.” Holmes picked up his thought, perking up a little and even taking a sitting position. “Otherwise, hardly any of them would have consciously dared to do this, knowing the scope and seriousness of such an offense to the syndicate. Our killer not only killed them demonstratively, but also left the mark of “Black Lotus.” After that, according to your new friend, he began to look for the artifact among his own smugglers, in the hope that it would surface somewhere.”
Now, having taken the last needed papers from the former curator and having found the necessary house in the complex interweaving of streets, John introduced himself with slight anticipation to a cute girl at the reception and sat down in a small cozy room while he waited to be escorted to the desired office.
The magic spilled into the air, spreading in all directions as a viscous stream, giving a feeling of peace and tranquility. He had forgotten what it was like not to be maneuvering constantly, avoiding or passing through the magical Storms, or how out of habit he was to brush off someone else's residual magic while crossing the streets, or catching the echoes of other people's spells. John had already gotten used to the constant hustle and bustle, as if he had never left the London streets for the sake of sun-scorched Afghanistan. So now the sudden silence made him a little nervous, which, however, did not last  long.
“Now listen to me carefully,” they sat down opposite each other right there in the bushes, and John was a bit apprehensive. He was also seized by excitement and anticipation, a feeling that he now strongly associated with Holmes and his Work. More precisely, now with their Work. “I have never done this before, and I may not succeed the first time, so you and I will, one might say, be pioneers.”
Su Lin cautiously approached him and asked him to look at his back, to which John, throwing his education aside, took off the blanket and bared his torso. With his pants stained with black ash and warm knitted socks handed by Mrs. Hudson, who gasped at the sight of his white feet, John still looked charming to Sherlock.
to finish beting this chap (we started in March) but now I really don't know what to do!!((((( She is not answering my mails and I hope nothing really serious happaned to her. I'm really worried!!!
It was strange to see his nails painted black. And he had long been accustomed to this kind of look of Sherlock’s hands, but his own caused a strange reaction in him - a grin and a desire to erase it all as soon as possible. Under a thin layer of black varnish on the ring finger of his left hand the rune of search was now hidden. They decided to play it safe, and John was forced to show off an unusual manicure, but so they had at least some guarantee that no matter what happened to him, Sherlock could always find him. What to say, the incident with the dragon taught them a lot.
Finally going down to the subway and finding a more or less quiet corner, John called Lestrade and briefly told about what had happened. His suspicions were justified - Sherlock did not even think to contact the Inspector and ask for help, so he corrected this omission to calm his conscience. Now they just had to be patient and wait.
He was not tempted by the prospect of being late for a meeting with his temporary, and in the long term, permanent Inspector. John hoped to the last that it would be Lestrade. What was his surprise when he found out that not only the Inspector had only one ward in the person of the dark mage Sherlock Holmes, but that he also served as an agent in the most prestigious operational unit of the MSD (1), in the DMC (2). He could hardly imagine how the Inspector's duties were imposed on the already active operative. But he, John Watson, certainly did not get the same special attention. Of course, he did not have an older brother who not only had influence and power, but who was clearly a strong practitioner. His closest relatives were only a sister who abused life-giving drinks (3), and who, even in her best years, was a rather mediocre witch. There was no question of any influence or connections.
The gazes sliding down his neck and arms were like tangible touches. He, of course, immediately felt them, but pretended he suddenly became terribly interested in the portrait of some elderly man who so successfully appeared right in front of him on the wall. It didn’t help much; John could still feel two pairs of unblinking eyes watching him with interest.
“Mr. Holmes is not going to suddenly appear again and interrupt our conversation?” The mage, nervous in front of him, asked directly. His aura went ugly with brown ripples, making John want to turn away and look anywhere else, just not at those flashing blisters, looking more like scars.
Stopping abruptly and pulling the sphere out of his pocket, John threw it with all his might against the sidewalk, resulting in a blinding flash of light and a prolonged howl that made his ears ring and everything going cold inside him.
“I will not beat around the bush - I will have only one request for you. Remain my Inspector for the duration of this investigation, and when it is closed, you will have the right to do as you see fit,” John put his unfinished cup back on the saucer and leaned back in his chair. It was not easy for him to find some free time, torn between the incessant instructions and orders of Sherlock, so he certainly expected a lot from this conversation. John voiced his wish, now it was up to the young Inspector, who was not stupid at all, despite his failures.
Soon we will finish this part, there will be sidestory form Sherlock' POV and waiting for part 3 as I still writing it..eahhh
“Speak,” Holmes' voice sounded much muffled, as if he spoke from behind a veil. “Voice your message.”
If it were not for Sherlock’s close attention to his long-awaited meal and the fact that the dark mage had not ordered anything and hadn’t even bothered to take off his coat, then this could have even been taken as a harmless dinner between two friends.
PS)) Will anyone be interested in beting my a bit angsty text with Seb Moran\John Watson pairing?)) I personaly think that it's one of my best stories (after Ashes, of course) and this pairing is my guilty pleasure one in fact))) text has been already translated, just waiting for being beted)
Finding one’s Balance was one of the fundamental skills that were taught in early childhood. More precisely, until recently, John naively believed so, growing up in a relatively prosperous average English family.
“Speak.” The order in Holmes’ voice was impossible to resist. John felt his knees buckle from the desire to kneel before the dark majestic figure and tell him his innermost secrets. Any secrets, anything, just to fulfill Sherlock’s order. “Speak!”
To avoid wasting time completely, he leafed through several basic textbooks on Dreaming and dream management, and even planned to buy one for himself. The internet and the forums were undeniably helpful, but one couldn’t forget the basics, for which he couldn’t afford to go back to school for this time. There was also the option of evening courses, which were preferable in his case, but so far, without at least some significant income, he could not afford them.
“I liked her,” John said, blurting the first thing that came to mind, while all his thoughts were occupied by one pleasant, in all respects, witch and her potential as his future employer and object of Holmes' jealousy.
“I owe nothing to anyone. Only..." John trailed off. He wanted to say that the only one to whom he really owed something was Holmes, or rather, both Holmes, but he cut himself off without finishing. He admitted this to himself for the first time. The thought was sobering in its simplicity, because now he truly owed a dark mage and a Necromancer. But the fact that he sincerely wanted to help these children had nothing to do with it.
Inspector Dimmock was looking at him intently across the table, and John couldn't shake the feeling that he was openly feared. It was a strange feeling, unfamiliar to him, especially when the conversation took place within the walls of a bright office and over a cup of fragrant tea.
The two-story Temple was unusual and splendidly beautiful. John even caught a glimpse of graceful shutters, lions and dragons standing still on the walls and around the pillars. There were many rooms and corridors, but what was hidden behind the sliding doors didn’t interest him - he found other people's secrets unnecessary for him. This he, thank Gods, hasn’t yet had time to learn from Holmes, who certainly wouldn’t fail to look into every room and into every crevice to satisfy his insatiable curiosity.
It was rightly said that the Healers were the worst patients, and now with his own at his disposal Sherlock was inclined to agree with that statement. And John didn't even realize how bad their light contact could end for him.
“As you already know, of my closest relatives, I only have a sister, with whom, moreover, I practically don’t communicate. But what about your family? I know of Mycroft, Are both your parents alive? Do you have any other brothers or sisters?”
They said goodbye hurriedly, or rather John said goodbye, Holmes, in his usual manner, having lost interest in his interlocution with the girl, hastened to leave. Having caught up with the dark mage at the elevator, he wanted to scold him for it, but changed his mind. It was easier to get a magical Storm to change trajectory than it was to convince a one-of-a-kind consulting mage of the benefits of etiquette when he had already gotten what he wanted.
He was unceremoniously grabbed by the arm, knocking him off step. The tenacious long fingers belonged to a strange type in shabby clothes and with the dull gaze of a man who had long abused opium and elixirs. His faintly luminous aura was stained with black, ugly splotches like cadaveric spots, the first thing that came to his mind.  John looked at this casual passer-by in surprise, he barely managed to suppress the urge to shrug his shoulders in disgust when he whispered hotly in his face, as if sharing a revelation.
Consequently, upon hearing an unveiled invitation, John agreed without hesitation. His curiosity once again prevailed over sanity. Besides, Su Lin Yao didn’t arouse any undue suspicion in him. Moreover, he had immediately checked her aura as soon as she spoke to him. To his amazement, she hid it as skillfully as Sherlock, arousing involuntary respect from him. This skill required either a special artifact or a lot of potential, though John was more inclinted to the former. Yet, as an Artifactist, the witch walking next to him could afford to have the necessary artifact at hand. But why she needed it was a completely different matter.
“We can wait for the Ministry’s Necromancer, but there is a simpler and more affordable option,” Lestrade, with a habitual gesture, ran a hand wearily through his silvery hair,  flashing a wedding ring. For some reason, John just now noticed the gold strip on the Inspector’s finger. Though if looked closely, Lestrade’s appearance fairly indicated that he was actually married, and it was a happy marriage as well.
John watched with interest, the whole conversation, feeling that he was clearly missing some subtext.
It was all sad. No doubt modern society had not only gave rise to, but in every possible way, contributed to the appearance of such organizations. But all this still didn’t bring them any closer to solving strange ritual murders. The only link so far were the black lotus flowers.
He chose Patrick, not only because he was Holmes' liaison, but also because the boy had a long-lasting strong aura, which was only a benefit for both of them. After all, he didn’t lie when he honestly admitted that he could fail.
Clearly and obviously accustomed to this kind of state of the apartments rented by the dark mage, the elderly witch didn’t even blink at the thickened blood in the cups or at the human teeth. Even the eyeballs in the microwave didn’t bother her. And when their little cleaning was over, she just cheerfully said goodbye to him and went down to her place, leaving him alone with the sealed message and his own thoughts.
The local mentor did not have any patience or any ability to teach. One got the notion that he was fulfilling an unpleasant duty and didn’t even try to hide his displeasure. The traditional kesa (2) looked a little ridiculous on the tall, thin figure, and its practical brown color gave an unhealthy powdery hue to a strange, though rather attractive face. This fact, combined with an eternally dissatisfied grimace, did not add to the mentor's popularity in the eyes of the children, who, with their age-specific spontaneity, were drawn to the only adult who was close and understandable to them in this strange and undoubtedly frightening place for them. On the one hand, it flattered John, and on the other, it only added to the hassle.
It was an ordinary London evening, damp and chilly, with a premonition of rain, he was not in danger of getting wet because he forgot his umbrella. And if he wasn’t too lazy, then he could even not freeze by casting a warming spell. Out of habit, John ran his fingers through his pockets, where he now always carried his permission. He couldn’t even think that he would begin to value this piece of plastic so much, previously taking it for granted, he began to especially appreciate it after what had happened to him.
“Sherlock, something is not right with me,” John, always a gentleman, did not want to disturb the ladies sitting in the living room, so he confessed what had been obvious to everyone for a long time, only now, when they were alone. Finally, surrendering to fatigue, he closed his eyes and continued to shudder and tremble, leaning heavily on the white ceramic surface of the sink. “I think I shouldn’t have returned home, but gone straight to the hospital,” John sighed dejectedly, as if he had already resigned himself to the prospect of communicating with unfamiliar Healers and the need to answer uncomfortable questions.
He noticed Su Lin Yao immediately. Her dark-haired high ponytail appeared and disappeared several times in the multicolored crowd, until the girl finally emerged from the general stream right in front of him. The witch also dressed up for their supposed date, to which could not but flatter John.
“Did you eat anything today?” John strongly suspected that no, he didn’t, but still considered it necessary to clarify, “Biscuits and elixirs don’t count.”
The loud ringing of the bell reminded them that the break was almost over, and the children reluctantly began to disperse, talking animatedly about what had happened. Reminding them once again that they had agreed to keep quiet about everything, he said goodbye to everyone and left the same way, through the fence that he had come over. His experiment today could be safely viewed as successful, so now he could return home with a clear conscience.
“We all have a lot of respect for Mr. Holmes,” the boy told him in a conspiratorial whisper, before they had to return their attention to the mentor, whose expression never changed and was still twisted with displeasure.
Only four pages were written in his notebook in addition to the searching he did for information about the artifact that caught his eye at the Exchange. It became another reason to be added to the list of reasons for visiting the Library. He was sorely lacking in basic knowledge. The books he found in Holmes’ extensive collection were, though informative, still highly specialized and, as a result, still useless for him.
“Job! I liked the job. A very pleasant place with a clean and strong source,” John laughed awkwardly, hoping Holmes would not give any importance to his slip of the tongue. He often witnessed the possessive manners of the dark mage, and had therefore presumed about the possible competition in the person of the Healer Sawyer for his time and attention. Although, probably, it still wasn’t worth mentioning. For his own peace of mind. “Who is the victim?”
“We will not be able to free ourselves as long as we are bound by our humanity, and until we get rid of these shackles, we will not be able to break free.”
“Sherlock has permission,” Lestrade explained to the bewildered Agents, who immediately nodded as if this fact was really something taken for granted.
There was no longer any point in delaying the inevitable, so John, resolutely picking up the envelope in his hands, sat down in his favorite chair by the fireplace, in order to familiarize himself in the peace and quiet, with what the Ministry wanted from Holmes and himself.
The street to one of the Ministry buildings, in what, John decided, was supposed to take place the first and introductory hearing, was short-lived. The cab braked smoothly, and came to a stop at a graceful, carved gate with guards on display. The sweep of the driveway, neatly trimmed grass, and well-groomed flowerbeds, of which John knew little, but could still appreciate something visually and aesthetically beautiful, suggested status, wealth, and position in society. The building itself, as well as the interior decoration, was also significantly different from any Department of the Ministry which he had ever happened to visit. High ceilings, spacious halls and corridors, marble, granite, and wood trim, intricate carvings, wide staircases with twisted railings, and high monolithic columns - the eye rejoiced wherever John looked. Even the magic was unusual here.
“I can imagine how difficult it is to give you gifts for your birthday or New Year. I bet you always know what's inside.” Smiling, John gently released his hand and pulled on the tape, curiosity beginning to torment him.
“... such a mess. Though your appearance, John, has become much better… By the way, the recipe you gave me helps a lot. Thank you, John. It is so rare to meet a good Healer now.”
“Black Lotus. We need to learn more about this sect and visit its head office,” Sherlock stopped abruptly and turned to him. “And for that I need your immediate help.”
Going through the numerous menus, John decided that the witch sitting in their living room definitely should not have given up oriental cuisine, besides, Sherlock loved everything spicy. Su Lin really didn't mind, so after leaving the order, he joined the conversation. He wondered what the magic item Sherlock had created and now infused with his magic might be talking about when he was talking to an outsider. The good news was that he, at least, did not gossip about them, only about their cases. Perhaps it was in himself and his magic, but now the magic skull was strikingly different both in the manner of speaking, and even in the choice of the topic of conversation from the picture that was familiar to John.
“Yes. I think we are dealing with a Necromancer. The ritual was somehow connected with him,” Sherlock already had an idea how exactly, but without Mycroft, he decided not to start building a chain of conclusions yet.
The Necromancer Mycroft Holmes, whatever he would invariably answer to, to the question about his position in the Ministry, couldn’t just be a minor official in the Transport Department. But John still had to nod and agree with the wording, no matter how curious he was. And now he knew for sure that Holmes senior had borrowed someone's office to meet with them.
John is... being John and ignoring his emotions by focusing on anything and everything that isn’t himself.
John’s sense of urgency to get back was urging him to drive faster than they'd gone on their previous journey, the result being that Sherlock had to hold onto the side of the door with one hand, and grip his seat-belt with the other. While John had assured him that there was no real sense of danger, neither man relished the idea of being off base after dark. They were about halfway back when a movement caught John’s eye and his jaw tensed.
Upon feeling John’s soft lips caress his sensitive neck, Sherlock’s entire body shook with restrained passion. Doing his best to collect his now scattered thoughts, Sherlock gripped John’s shoulders with considerable strength before remembering how to formulate proper vocabulary.
“Oh.” He turned and smiled at Sherlock, a genuine smile that made his eyes crinkled and his ears raise a bit higher on his head, “I have a new favorite word that begins with H. Want to hear it?” Sherlock nodded and returned John's smile. “Husband.” and with that, he turned back around and disappeared into the plane.
He tried telling me to back off, to leave you alone, to slow things down between us. That you were better off without me, without the fear and risk that comes along with dating (We are dating right?) a member of the military. My occupation is not exactly what one would call safe, but as a Doctor I am a bit safer than my fellow soldier. Sherlock, is that what you want? Me to step back? While that isn't what
Mycroft sounded put out, as if having his hidden cameras found was the worst possible thing that could have happened to him today.
“Depends,” Sherlock said thoughtfully, “Yellow makes me think of bees, which as you already know is a passion of mine. I’m drawn to blues and purples when picking out clothing…. However,” Here Sherlock turned his head slightly and caught John’s eye, “I’m finding that my new all time favourite is a unique shade of blue. It's almost… indigo, with these little flecks of brown in it, like the sea at night just after a storm.”
(Edit, I'm sorry the screenshots are so big, ao3 is being a tit tonight and wont work with me... and I'm tired and have had a shitty day so I'm not fighting with it. Might just be easier to view on tumblr. Link above and below.)
Three hours later, after allowing mummy to order takeaway from a surprisingly delicious Chinese place just down the road, John and Sherlock sat in their chairs in 221B Baker Street weary from the day, but grinning at each other.
“It was for science. You never let me do any fun experiments…” Sherlock grumbled and sat up, placing his back against the headboard.
“Hurry back…” John slurred, smearing drool onto the pillow as he rolled over to face Sherlock’s side of the bed, and oh, did Sherlock hurry.
"Ahhh..." Sherlock nodded as understanding washed over him. He gently cupped John's chin with his hands as he spoke. "You think because you were rough, that I might think it was less than consensual. John, you couldn't be further from the truth. I knew, if I kept teasing you, it would only be a matter of time before you snapped. I also knew, that you were holding back this morning in an attempt to not hurt me."
“Hey…. come here. Not ready yet.” John murmured and reached a hand out, catching Sherlock's wrist between his strong fingers.
As he waited for Sherlock to answer John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s back and buried his nose in Sherlock’s neck. It felt amazing, to be here, to have Sherlock in his arms, and even more amazing to be able to smell him. Currently, all he smelled of was what John could only imagine to be expensive soap, but it was wonderful. Perfect even. As if to emphasize just how perfect it was, he kissed Sherlock’s neck.
“His name was Victor. Apparently he had a fondness for wandering the halls at late hours, said it gave him a much needed break from the tiresome drivel he endured during the day from instructors. It also allowed him time alone with his thoughts, thought I came to find were quite extraordinary. He knew of me of course. Said he had been curious to meet the famous Sherlock Holmes and find if the rumours of my intellect and lack for social niceties were true, he was quite ecstatic about the entire thing to be honest.”
My curiosity is burning, and is getting the best of me. What is a mind palace? Because I have this image of you, whatever you look like, sitting with a sort of tiara on your head. And I assume that is not at all what you mean. Especially as that sort of behavior would warrant you a trip to a nice padded room.
This chapter is not even close to what I wanted, but if I don't post it, and keep nitpicking it... I'll never be happy with it. I had bigger and better plans, but the boys wouldn't cooperate, I wanted more angst... but didn't have time.
I'm posting this for Blood, as she *GASPS* forgot to post it earlier and now isn't around a computer. (More so real life got in the way than forgot, so I think we can forgive her... this once.)
Sherlock immediately went from lounging in bed to sitting almost ramrod straight, giving his husband a most peculiar stare. “John, I’m starting to get the impression that you’re not happy to see me.”
“Yes, well…” Sherlock panted while reaching up to brush a curl out of his face, “I've only just recently learned what prostate stimulation feels like.”
Sherlock moaned and began rocking his hips back and forth, when the muscles gave no resistance John slipped in his middle finger, making Sherlock rock faster. Soon John had three fingers inside his husband and Sherlock was muttering incoherent words into his makeshift gag.
We don’t want to lose any readers, so don’t force yourself to read something that may or may not trigger you. We love you all and don’t wish to upset you.
“God, that’s hot.” John smirked then mashed their lips together in a wet open mouth kiss. “Right… now… where was I?”
At this John broke his silence for the first time. At the thought of someone taking advantage of Sherlock bile rose in his throat and he emitted a low growl. He didn't put his thoughts to words, but channeled his emotions into tightening his arms around the trembling man resting against him. He pressed a reassuring kiss to Sherlock’s temple then let out a deep breath.
B is up to her eyes in school work and I don't think she'll be able to write at all for a very long time.... Almost looking like not at all, which is sad, but we'll see. : ) FourCorners has been a life saver and helped me write this.
“Yes, of course. Right here.” John’s pant became a groan as Sherlock’s fingers wrapped back around him “So close, sweetheart… so close.”
Sherlock quickly rose to his feet, abruptly cutting off whatever Mrs. Holmes was about to say next. He then swiftly took hold of John’s hand and began maneuvering him toward one of the hallways that branched off from the room they were currently in.
“I believe there is a small telly in the sitting room. I don't believe many channels come in, but I believe there is a good stock of movies if you would prefer,” Sherlock put his tea down and began rummaging through the shelves, “I'll find something for us to eat.”
