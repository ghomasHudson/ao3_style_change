“You don't understand!” Dean finally manages to explain. It feels like he’s drowning, his body and mind battered by dark waves, storms raging above him, electricity, and fear. He’s clinging to Castiel for dear life, afraid of sinking down again into the haunted depths. Terrified of his own self-destructiveness.
It hurt. And they were going to put another one back inside him.
“Of course!” Cas exclaims, “I’d love to do that. I just didn’t think you wanted to hear it.”
He's pushing two thick, flat pieces of silicone into each side of Dean's cheeks, followed by a rounded piece that he worked between Dean’s teeth. It rests thick and heavy on his tongue, forcing it to curve around the plastic and giving him the instinctive urge to suck.
Cas nodded, and set to work, prepping the area around Dean's penis, getting the kit ready, sanitizing his skin. Benny meanwhile inserted an IV and gave Dean some pain relief and IV fluids.
Castiel had seen it himself. Through careful mimicry, practice and sheer willpower, Dean could pass a neutral or even a low level dominant. He rarely let the mask slip, even with Sam, who habitually forgot his brother even had a dynamic at all. Sure Sam tried, he did all the things the pamphlets suggested, gave his brother rules, set routines, took him to appointments. The problem was that Dean was so good at hiding it, that Sam couldn’t tell that it wasn’t nearly enough.
"Hey, no. Dean. It's ok. I'm Balthazar, but my friends call me Bal. I'm your night nurse." The man holds his hands up, palms open, "No need to freak out. I've already texted Cas, he's on his way down."
"Breathe… that's it... and try not to tense up. I know it's uncomfortable but it'll be over soon," Cas said as he gently threaded the tube further down into Dean's sore urethra.
He stumbled, reaching out his hands but finding nothing but air, he fell, agony ripping through his already damaged joints as he crashed to his knees. His wrists twisted under his weight and he fell forward again, sprawling out onto the floor, pain raging up his spine like punishment, like he’d earned it.
An hour later, Dean woke up in agony.
Once Dean was finally settled, Benny returned to his place between his legs. He once again grasped the tube, and Dean couldn’t help the noise of protest the escaped his lips as the tube was eased out of his bladder.
his brain provided,
Dean choked and bit back a scream, as the first inch of plastic was threaded into his oversensitive, too tight urethra. Thrashing, but held tight in his brother's arms, Dean actually screamed as Cas pushed in again. Benny held him tight and rubbed his back as he arched up off the table. His knees pressing tight against the sides of Castiel's body, instinctively trying to close, but unable to do anything but press and shake as he was held open. The doctor focussed and calm, even as Dean thrashed on the table.
"Ok, Ok." Benny soothed, "I see that you're still angry, and I'm assuming by the long time it took you to consider my question, that it wasn't the gag or the blindfold then?"
Sam nods, relieved to be able to go over it one more time. Eventually, he'll learn the process, but Castiel makes sure to explain everything carefully so that he'll not be surprised by any of it when they begin.
"Not for a while yet,"
“Can you rate it for me, Sweetheart? With a zero being ‘no pain at all’ and a ten being ‘the worst pain you’ve ever experienced’.”
He felt around it, as much as the mitts would allow anyway. They'd obviously put them back on after he fell asleep.
“I don’t, not really. But maybe it’ll help? if I know more about what’s happening”
“Good.”
. Thicker than he’s ever felt before and more secure. Wide bands of fabric and velcro. The ball is pulled out of his grip, but only long enough to take the mitts off and then it’s back. A kiss pressed to the top of his hand as Cas helps him grip it tightly, before he fastens a strap across his wrist securely.
Also FYI: We're back to serious Medical Kink next chapter 😉
didn't want to go through that again any time soon.
Dean let out a slow breath and took in another. Cas held him tightly throughout, sensing that he needed reassurance and giving him time to collect his thoughts.
“I know.” Cas offers tenderly, “We’ll talk about it tomorrow. And I promise, I’ll listen.”
Dean laughed, a little brittle and nervous, but it’s genuine.
Dean nods. Hard and sharp.
He closed his eyes, drifting off just as he felt the first warm, wet cloth being wiped across the top of his foot. Benny's sure hand grasping his sole and raising it up so he could side the warm cloth up the back of his calf….
Love to hear what you think!
"It's ok," Cas soothed, "We're almost done, then it'll feel so much better," Cas pushed in again, another inch of plastic threaded its way inside and Dean struggled back the urge to push Castiel's fingers away, off his poor abused dick. To punch him in the face.
He pushed forward till he could feel the strap lifting slightly, then a little more. When he was sure that one of the blades was far enough underneath, he used both hands to angle the scissors up and rested them upright against his cheekbone. Now they were ready, he pushed the top handle down against his cheek with as much force as he could manage. He felt them bite in, not enough to cut through entirely but there was definitely some progress made. He repeated the technique several more times, separating the handles with his thumbs and then pushing it back down forcefully against this cheek with the palm of his hand.
Dean lay back and was quiet as Benny pushed the basin back underneath and returned the chair to its previous position. It was almost as if he was falling asleep, his muscles lax and slow now they were no longer tensed with discomfort and spasm.
"I don't need someone watching me sleep, and I especially don't need some night nurse. I've managed to sleep just fine alone all my life."
Dean almost looked hopeful for a moment, but soon the clouds rolled back across his expression, " Better not to promise things like that Cas. If I've learnt anything about this messed up body of mine, shit just keeps getting worse and worse, nothing ever gets better." He shrugs, obviously long ago coming to accept this as truth.
He could hear the wheels of the chair approaching, and for once he's thankful for it, not sure he'd be capable of making it up to his room with how exhausted he was feeling.
“That’s done.” Benny reports, “Now I’m going to pull the tube out.”
He sat down first and then guided Dean's body so that he was resting with his back against Castiel's chest. Both their legs were up across the length of it. He pulled a blanket that had been resting across the back of the sofa over both of them and tucked it under Dean's chin.
“I suppose,” Cas agrees, equally dour,
“Fair point, the poor guy always looks ragged after a couple of weeks without a proper drop. He would benefit from several more I reckon,”
Dean can’t help the whine that escapes from him, the rush of terror.
(See the end of the chapter for
They took his clenched fists and lowered them back down to his lap. Other hands wiped the tears away from his cheeks with a soft cloth. And throughout voices spoke to him in calming, loving tones.
“I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now,” Cas informs him, “Just breathe normally.” He presses a stethoscope to his chest, pre-warmed by his hand. Dean feels him moving it around, listening and then moving to another spot.
But now it did.
His body was fighting back from the edge of failure and gotten so close to serious, even permanent damage. Cas didn’t even want to think about that, but knew he had to do Dean's full examination soon, just to be sure.
An odd, clanging whirring noise awoke him with a start. Dean gasped and looked around, only to realise he was still wearing the blindfold and he had no way to know what was making the sound.
, chuckles. Dean does his best to glare at him, it’s pointless with the blindfold still on, but it does make him feel a better.
Benny, the
"Can I shake your hand?" Dean can hear the smile in Balthazar's voice, "Introduce myself properly?”
, He recites to himself.
"You know you need them." Castiel reminds him gently, "Rules settle you and give you structure. You know you feel better when you have clear rules and expectations."
"You need to breathe calmly now, mon cher. You're hyperventilating. Just slow your breath down or you’ll pass out. That's it,"
It was clear that he was fighting his way back up. The embarrassment and social discomfort he was experiencing, destabilizing his ability to maintain his obedience and submission. Castiel tried not to feel disappointed. They had been expecting this after all.
Benny smiles and gives him a knowing look, "I’ve heard you two! That boy wouldn't let anything get between him and a chance to fuck. Especially now that you’re bonded,"
Later in the afternoon, after Dean had tried and failed to nap, his stomach was feeling increasingly painful and sore, Castiel arrived carrying an unusual item of clothing. It was a bit like a vest, but the velcro fastened down the sides rather than the front. And it was really heavy, but in a reassuring way, giving consistent weight and pressure all over his shoulders, back and chest. The only place it wasn't weighed was around his belly, which Dean was thankful for, as he didn't think he could stand anything pressing much on him there. Instead, it had a giant pocket at the front and inside the pocket Castiel slipped a heat pack just the right size to fit snugly over his sore stomach.
Cas took a breath and covered the hand with his other, raising both to his lips and kissing the back of his palm.
Dean was still sleeping, his body finally able to rest fully now that the urgency and desperation of a full bladder had subsided and the dehydration was being treated. Cas had hoped he'd have a chance to eat at least a little, but it was clear from the exhaustion in Dean's eyes that he didn't have the energy for even that much.
"It's not your fault. He's incredibly skilled at hiding it, even from professionals like myself. I constantly had to double check my results, he was so convincing that even I doubted what the tests were showing me."
Castiel nodded as if Dean had actually asked him a question, his voice growing softer, gentler, like he knew this was going to be hard for Dean to hear. "After our last conversation, I suspected that it might become necessary, although I hoped that wouldn't. I hoped that I could convince you to willingly engage with treatment, to allow yourself to accept the support that you so very much need. " He held Dean's eyes, refusing to give an inch, " I didn't want it to happen this way, but you gave us no other choice,"
“Cas,” He says barely even able to form the words, “I won’t be able to follow along, let alone think clearly about this right now. I just can’t.”
"Ah," Cas realizing his error, "Can you see that's why we need Gabe's help? With his guidance, maybe we could have prevented what happened here."
"That's ok, you rest. Food will be here soon," Cas promises, but Dean's already sound asleep.
"Thank you," he says and means it.
He stayed angry but didn’t pull away. What he wanted was to settle in his arms, finding safety.
Dean still eyes him suspiciously, uncomfortable and ready to act, he can't help looking around for possible weapons. If the man is lying, then Dean can see at least seven ways to disable him before he can even get across the bed.
“The gag helps him relax,” Cas explains, as he stands back up he places a small white ball in Dean’s still mitten covered hand, “Removing his ability to speak is one less thing he has to struggle against. The ball is to let us know if anything’s wrong, he’ll drop it if he needs a break or to stop,”  Dean grasps it tightly.
At least Sam had left a while ago. He'd seen enough to understand the mechanics and learn the basic process, but after the second one, Castiel had decided that was enough and sent him back to the library to continue studying.
"Ok, deep breaths. Sam, Benny, you'll both need to hold him down for this,"
Castiel snickered, "I'll grant you that Gabriel's personality can be somewhat grating. But the effectiveness of his treatment methods speak for themselves. He is considered one of the leading experts in Dynamic Disorders. I promise you, if anyone can help us, it's him."
Dean lays his head back, his stomach twists nervously, “That’s gonna hurt, right?”
He pressed his head into the crook of Benny's neck. Hiding from something, but he didn't know what.There was nothing to be afraid of here. He knew that.
Dean felt only rage,
“Fuck you,” Dean huffed, disgruntled and fearing what was still to come.
Dean thinks back, had he been scared? He shook his head. He hadn't ever felt scared of Castiel or any of his staff. He didn't think he ever could be, here was the only place he ever felt safe.
He snarled in Dean's long ago memory.
He worked his fingers back a little deeper, hoping to give him something enjoyable to focus on rather than the painful procedure.
“Uhhhh,” Dean complains, “Don’t do that! I might explode!”
Dean has a sore throat and an uncomfortably full feeling in his stomach. He groans, and tries to shift, hoping a new position might help with the discomfort.
And Dean did. It felt good, giving him something to focus his aggression on, his pain. Because there was pain, sharp, sore and deep. Jagged spikes of pain every time Benny moved deeper and deeper.
. Dean sees the shimmer of it in his eyes and something else...
"Yes," Cas confesses, “and I don’t regret it. Just… please let me explain!”
Dean wants to argue, but Castiel just barrels on, "Anyway, let's get up off this floor. There's a sofa about six metres to our right. Do you think you can make it over there, if I help you?"
“There we go,” Benny confirmed, “It’s all out. That wasn’t so bad, was it?”
"I trust him," Castiel kept his voice calm, firm, "I have known him my whole life and while he can be a little annoying, he's also a brilliant, experienced doctor, who is dedicated to helping all his patients. Please believe me when I say that you can trust him not to hurt you."
“Yes, and because we’re going to make sure you’re nice and secure, it won’t happen again,” he pats the inside of Dean’s thigh gently, getting him to spread them voluntarily, before he gently eases Dean’s foot up into the stirrup. One then the other, then he fastens each with two Velcro straps, one that loops up over the ankle and then behind the heel, and another that goes over the top of his foot.
"almost...almost… and we're in,"
"He's not fully back," Castiel answered for him, "but he's getting there. Has been coming up for a while now." Cas's voice sounded a little sad.
Well, it definitely wasn't the gag. Yes, it sucked but he'd dealt with worse, and mostly he liked wearing gags... eventually. It wasn't even the blindfold. He hadn't minded it, when it had just been him and Castiel, lying together on the sofa. In fact, it had felt quite nice, curled up in the darkness, safe in his alpha's arms.
Dean starts to shift away again, uncomfortable, but Castiel just holds him tight “I should have realized that this wasn’t something that I couldn’t just distract you from, that what you were telling me was that you were terrified. I should have listened, talked with you about your fears rather than attempting to distract you from them. It was the wrong thing to do.”
“I want you here too,” Cas promises, “Whatever happens, you’ll always have a home here with me.”
"Thank you. I want you to know that you can speak to me about anything, ask questions about any of my medical decisions and treatments. I just request that you do it privately, not in front of Dean."
Dean growled angrily at him.
"Dean, you know you can't..." he paused, and seemed to be considering his words carefully, he looked extremely sad all of a sudden, "Your condition… "  but Sam interrupted him, storming into the clinic, obviously on a mission.
"Yes. Alright. Fucking Fine. Just do what you need to do to fix me. Please Cas," he ground out, desperately. Wanting to beg Cas not to give him a lecture right now, just Fix It.... fix it before he passed out again and the damage became permanent.
"Yes?"
the doctors had said,
Dean huffs out an unexpected laugh “Well, if he’s willing to call you out on your bullshit.  That’s worth a point in his favour.”
He marvelled at that for a moment. It didn't feel like he had been sedated, all too familiar with that particular variety of cotton wool haziness. But to sleep through someone else brushing his teeth for him, that just didn't seem possible, except for the remnants of mint lingering on his tongue.
He felt like his emotions were on some sort of rollercoaster, or children's Ferris ride. He could feel himself swinging wildly between anger and appreciation, between relief and resentment. And he didn't know how to control it. One minute he was fine, joking and chatting with Benny and the next he was in his arms begging and sobbing. Then Cas would come into the room and he'd find himself screaming and throwing whatever he could get his hands on. He was so angry and sore, he knew it was irrational, but he couldn't stop himself blaming Castiel.
“I will. I promise.” Cas's voice breaks a little at the end, “And when you're ready, I’ll take you hunting again. It'll be different than before, but if that’s what you want, then yes. We will hunt together.”
Even though Sam was neutral, and Castiel would never expect Sam to Dominate Dean in any way, he should still learn about this so he could understand his brother better and build a basic understanding of what caring for his brother entailed.
But there was something he needed to treat urgently first and Dean really wasn’t going to like it.
When they arrived Sam dragged Dean from the car, yelling for Cas and Benny, even as he pulled Dean's hunched figure into the now familiar clinic attached to his house. He'd texted them about Dean's condition, but it didn't stop the distress on their faces or the anger.
Chapter warnings: Enemas, physical discomfort, angst and hurt/comfort.
He dived towards the other man's voice, flinging himself into his arms and pulling him close. He sobbed out inarticulate words. Trying desperately to get him to understand that he didn't want this, he could do this, all of this
Benny had massaged his throat to help the tube slide down, and then once Castiel had aspirated to check it for correct placement, had affixed it to Dean's cheek with a long strip of tape.
Comments keep me writing!!
“You know,” Castiel offers, sounding only slightly more sympathetic than Benny, “Once you’re taking a sufficiently large volume at a fast enough rate, you won’t need the continuous pump anymore. We’ll be able to swap to overnight and just three or four half-hour gravity-bag feeds each day instead.”
“Good,” Castiel lent over to adjust the positioning of the stirrups and knee rests, firmly pushing them up and back, forcing Dean's pelvis forward and his legs even further apart. His thighs were already protesting from earlier and the new position just made it worse.
He could feel himself panicking for real now, the edge of the room going gray. His breathing getting faster and heartbeat louder. He started to plan ways to escape, the get away, away from whatever Sam had done to him.
"I know all this already. I've heard it a thousand times." Dean grits out, "I don't need reminding,"
A deadbolt?
Benny knows he's right, as always. He can keep watch for a while. And Balthazar, Dean's night shift nurse, can take over after that.
“Ummmm,” Sam drew out the vowel, “isn't that quite long?” sounding nervous even asking, "I mean, he's already hurting so much…."
“I love you.” Castiel whispers to him, like a secret
Sam climbs up on the mattress with him, pulling his brother into his arms. "It's going to be ok, you'll see."
“So?”
Dean shook his head, his expression anguished. But his body language said something completely different. He was actively seeking Cas's contact, shaking with the effort and the stress. He desperately wanted to drop back down, but he couldn’t. Dean’s heartbeat started racing and his blood pressure sky-rocketing, Cas knew he needed to act. And Dean was already so open to it, so clearly wanting it, that even the slightest hint of dominance would have him slipping back down into submission and obedience.
Dean grumbles, but after two days in the clinic and multiple others feeling too sick and exhausted to clean himself properly, he felt pretty gross.
He wanted to beg him to get it out faster.
“Oh,” Dean was a little shocked. Gabriel had seemed so emotionless and unaffected. But what Cas just told put the whole thing in an entirely different light. He knew well the need to shut down all emotions and feelings to get the job done, he’d done it himself enough times.
Dean nods. Unexpectedly, unsure he wants it gone now that it’s being taken away.
He pushed at it, swearing and cursing at the remaining straps as they slowed his progress. He hooked his thumbs under the weakened areas and thrust up, gagging himself on the remaining neck band, but succeeding pushing it up just enough.
Benny left before Dean had a chance to ask if he was referring to Sam or Castiel. And he was asleep before he had a chance to think too hard on it either way.
He reached up, trying to slide his fingers under the edges of the blindfold straps to pull them off only to realise he was wearing those damn mittens again. At least these were the softer fabric ones that allowed basic movements and even kept his thumb separated from his fingers. It wasn't enough leverage to shift the blindfold though and he had nowhere near the dexterity to undo the buckles.
"No, he's barely been awake for more than a couple of minutes at a time. I need to do a full examination as soon as possible but I'll need both you and Sam’s assistance if I’m to have even half a chance of making it through.  Sam is catching up on sleep himself right now, which he needs almost as much as Dean does,"
Cas nodded, “It’s good to see his body is able to take it that deeply, it’s a very positive sign.
It was still obviously a medical space, as it was full of medical cabinets holding supplies, machines, monitors were mounted on the walls, and you couldn't miss the treatment chair, or the surgical table, both of which were in the back of the space and separated off from the main room to keep them sanitary. Unfortunately, those pieces of furniture were not optional, but at least it didn't feel entirely clinical either.
His family believed that the best way to foster loyalty and dedication from it's staff was through providing them with the same in return. All of his personal staff were paid substantial wages, offered private generous accommodation for themselves and their families, substantial scholarships to only the best schools and colleges and given enviable retirement packages commensurate with the level of dedicated service they provided. They were fiercely loyal, incredibly hardworking and very protective of him and his family.
"Good morning," Sam greets them both, "How did you sleep?" He directed towards Dean.
Cas reaches out and slides his hand firmly under Dean's jaw, turning his face upwards and forcing him to meet his gaze...
he grimaced, remembering the tube Castiel had shoved into his dick,
This one was slightly larger than the last, not a lot, but Cas was sure that Dean would notice the difference. He was so oversensitive and tight, that each slight increase would be felt keenly. Unfortunately, that was part of the treatments and he would just have to accept that each plug, tube, catheter, dilation device, etc, would be larger than the last.
“I keep fucking running away.” Dean knows he’s ranting, but he can’t make himself stop, “And look where I ended up, like a kicked dog, snivelling on the floor. Both fucking times!" He remembers the hours sat upon the cold corridor floor, his back to the locked door, angry and hurting.
“It’s ok,” Cas rubs his chest with his free hand, “Just take a breath. Benny, can you fasten the thigh and waist straps for Dean? It’ll help you settle.”

"You're a survivor sweetheart. You always have been. I know it's hard right now. You're scared and in pain, but you will get through this too, I promise.   Then life will get so much better. Just give me the time to show you."
All his muscles obeying his bondmate. It was goddamn disconcerting. Terrifying in its immediacy.
Castiel smiles, but cautions him, “Sam isn’t aware yet and Dean wishes to be the one to tell him.  Dean’s not yet ready to address it publicly, so please do not discuss the issue with either of them.”
Castiel's heart ached at the thought.
Cas had sat him down one afternoon in his kitchen and moulded it to fit him exactly. He’d boiled the plastic guards in water and, after letting them cool slightly, had him bite down on them to shape the plastic to his teeth and mouth. There was an opening for breathing and liquids at the front, but otherwise, it fitted completely over his upper and lower teeth and his tongue. He could still remember the feeling of Cas's fingers moulding and shaping the plastic inside his mouth. Holding his chin while he slid his fingers along the gumline and deep into his throat, testing the depth and fit over his tongue. It's a comforting memory.
Benny flicked his eyes over to the monitor above Dean's head with concerned eyes.
Sam maneuvered the wheelchair into view and immediately set Dean on edge.
Dean knew it wasn't usually a very painful procedure, he'd had it done often enough to know. But this time, even using the smallest diameter tube, the stretch was more than his body was comfortably able to accept, but they had no choice. He'd really left it too long.
“No, you’re right. The actual treatments for your condition is quite the opposite. We’ll need to use some quite specific devices and techniques to retrain your body to operate in the way it's supposed to. It will require some intensive work, some of which I’m afraid won’t be particularly pleasant.  But I know that with proper treatment life will get whole hell of a lot better and easier for you, I promise"
He asked Benny to watch over Dean. The nurse was well briefed on the plan for Dean's care and treatment, had helped him design it, and could be relied upon to provide whatever Dean required. There was no way Castiel would be allowing Dean to be left unsupervised anytime soon, not with his extremely fragile health, vulnerable psychological state, traumatic background, and extensive combat/evasion skills. No, Dean would require constant monitoring and supervision for a long time to come.
At first, he’d refused to wear it, claiming it made him claustrophobic, but Cas had been patient, allowing him to pull it out for a few minutes each time he needed a break before he’d push it back in again. Eventually, Dean had grown used to it, even if he still didn’t really like how completely it filled his mouth and made it impossible to speak or refuse to swallow when Cas slid the tube for liquids through the opening. Which he did fairly often when he thought Dean needed the hydration or the calories; several of their scenes in fact had been exactly that. Actually, many of their scenes were unusually domestic. Dean didn’t know what to think or how to feel about that, but he suspected that he liked the casually controlling way Castiel sometimes took over such basic everyday tasks like eating and brushing his teeth, but he refused to follow the thought any further.
"Uh thanks for that, but is there any chance of you giving me my actual phone?”
Straight after every appointment he'd always pulled it right back out again. Sometimes right there in the bathroom of the doctors office.
.” Cas sounds frustrated and sad, “You have been for a long time now. Only three days ago, you were falling in an out of consciousness, hours from doing lasting damage to yourself. You could have died!” Cas’s voice cracks a little when he adds, “You still could die. If you walk out of here today and go back to living like you did before, as it stands, you probably wouldn’t survive a week. You have to know that?”
Instead turned the phone back over, dialed 112 and listened for the click.
"""""
He wanted to scream at him,
Sam pulled the car over and Dean bit back a groan of frustration. Sam's eyes were full of worry, "Dean?"
But the spasms start almost immediately, even before the feeling of fullness and the stretch that he knows is coming. He can feel his abdominal muscles tensing and releasing as shoots of pain run up his sides. He doesn’t know if it’s psychosomatic or real, but it fucking hurts already.
He can’t do anything for much longer, he’s too exhausted.

"No, not that. But we can talk about treatment options later. Right now you need to eat. Your weight has dropped substantially since your last check-up and you were already borderline clinical then. I thought we agreed that you would increase your intake by at least 500 calories a day. That you continue to lose weight is quite concerning," he sounded disappointed but not angry at least. Dean didn't want to admit that he often pretended to eat larger meals than he actually did or opened snacks that he never ate more than a mouthful or two. He didn't want to admit that he was having major trouble eating even tiny qualitiesand even then he often threw it back up soon after. Cas had told him that it was common for his condition, but he had shrugged him off, denying the problem.
"Dean, this is Balthazar. As I'm sure he's already told you, he's going to be your night nurse from now on. He'll be in charge of monitoring you while you sleep. Sorry, I didn't get the chance to introduce you yesterday, I didn't want to wake you just for that."
He can hear Castiel walking over, pulling off clothing as he goes, Dean can hear the shirt being dumped on the chair next to the bed.
Dean leans forward, wrapping his arms around his belly and just breathes. Rough gasping breaths in, and ragged shaky breaths out.
His head hurts too much.
Dean didn’t know how to feel about that. All these people inexplicably deciding that caring for him was worth their time and effort. He tried not to think about it, it just hurt and made him want to run again. To escape. His heart started to beat a little faster, his chest felt tighter.
That was until he shifted his hips slightly, and a cramp hit his nerves like a thunderclap and all the breath was forced out if his lungs. And he was reminded of how very
“You’re doing great.” Benny informed him,
"I'm going to remove the gag, is that all right?" it sounds like a genuine question, like Castiel really does want to know the answer. Like it’s a choice.
He used his mitted hands to push himself upright, and slid sideways, resting his hands on the chair on either side of his hips. His feet still dangled in the air, he had no way to know the distance to the ground, but assumed that Cas wouldn't have him raised up too high lest he fall. He pushed forward off the table trusting his hands to take his weight as he slid his feet to the ground. It wasn't far, but the shock of the cold and his own weight sent him forward anyway, crashing to the ground in a heap.
Cas had explained to him that the pain wasn’t a sign of tearing or ripping or anything dangerous. It was his condition, his body’s way of resisting what felt wrong, but was necessary. His nerves were overreacting to the stimulation by sending painful messages up his nervous system and to his brain. It would settle down in time.
“Dean.” Cas admonishes sternly, “What is Rule Number 2?”
is meant to be a comfort.
Dean opened his mouth to argue, but instead feels a piece of plastic pushed inside. He tries to turn his head away from it, to dislodge it with his tongue. But Castiel grasps both sides of his head and holds him still. An agonizing knot begins to tighten in his guts.
… he slowed his breathing, taking a moment to rest his body against the bench and focus. When he could feel the adrenaline start to fade, he began cutting.
"It's alright, love, we know. You just relax and let us wash you. You'll feel better once you're nice and clean" said Benny.
"Anytime," At that Castiel nodded, and he eased Dean up in the chair one final time.
“I know it’s hard, but first you’ll need to give yourself time to sleep and to heal.”
“Stop. You need to stop.” Dean interrupts, scared of hearing what comes next.
"Tell me. And don't fucking lie. Not this time," Sam's fingers were white, as they clenched the steering wheel.
“Protect me?” Dean’s bewildered, “… and why that?”
But knowing that he couldn’t, that Cas was right there, and that he was safe, helped Dean successfully push the urge down. Letting the ragged urges scratching at the back of his mind settle and fade away. It felt good to snuggle back into Cas’s arms knowing there was no way to act on the distressing impulse.
He reached the door and then the corridor. Counting his movements forward...nine to pass the elevator, another six to the staircase and five more the door to the clinic. Just three more, he told himself, three more and you can open the door to outside.
He slid his free hand down over Dean's chest and stomach, moving lower until he was resting his palm on his abdomen, which pressed on firmly. He could feel that Dean was sore there, his muscles holding the tension, the skin fever hot. He couldn't feel anything of the fullness that would normally be expected during an enema, but Dean could hold so little that it didn't even make the slightest bulge. In fact, the whole area was still concave, his recent weight loss only adding to the issue Cas observed sadly. It would take some serious work to force Dean back up to a healthy weight.
But Castiel's low, controlled voice cut through the panic, as always, gentle but firm, "No, you will never ever be sent to a facility or a care home. I promise. You will be staying here, with me."
He knew he had to act fast, whatever was keeping them busy wasn't likely to last much longer. Crawling on his hands and knees, he carefully moved forward, reaching out one hand to feel ahead. He quickly came up to the edges of a cupboard or counter, and slid his hands up the feel along the edges of the panel. Cupboard, cupboard, cupboard, drawers! Perfect! Gingerly he pulled on the bottom most one, using his separately encased thumb to push underneath the edge of the handle and pull outwards. It took a few tries, but he succeeded quickly enough. Feeling with his mitted hands for the contents inside. The drawer was filled with small cardboard boxes of some type, not what he was looking for, so he used the same technique to pull open the next one. This was slightly closer to what he was looking for, but not quite, the metallic clinking sounds from the instruments inside too large and heavy. Finally, on the third try he heard what he was hoping for. He pushed himself up into the counter, resting his hip on the edge and reached in with both hands.
“Benny?” Cas asks, “Can you do this? I think Dean would appreciate it if I held his hand.”
"Uh…yeah. " Dean was caught by surprise, pleased but wary, “I uh... I'm sorry too, I sort of freaked out on you yesterday. I uh... Sure, we can do that."
“Sorry,” Cas apologised, but didn't make any attempt to reduce the severity of the position, “We’re going to be fitting you for a special belt and thigh straps, so we need to know how far each of the straps will need to stretch.”
Dean doesn't respond. He's barely breathing through the distressing realisation of how difficult that is going to be. But it seems like he doesn't need a response, because Cas continues anyway.
Dean thought feeling relieved to have the particularly strange sensation over.
Dean held his breath, trying to control the pain, or mask it a least. Sam would ask questions and he needed to sound convincingly fine. He needed him not to freak out.
“Okay, Love.” Cas is gentle, trying to sooth him with his words and his body, “Can you explain it to me?”
Dean grit his teeth and looked away. His gaze drawn to the window, out to where the garden was still hazy in the distance with early morning fog and then beyond it. His eyes were drawn out across the forests and mountains in the distance. Instinctively seeking the horizon and an escape from Castiel's words.
Dean groaned, “Benny!.. Just... please.”
That sounded strange. Odd. Dean wasn’t sure what he thought of all that. Hopeful maybe?
Benny gives him a sympathetic look, “You gotta know that it’s only hurting him, keeping it secret.”  Benny had somehow known immediately that they’d bonded, he’d congratulated Castiel and announced that his smell had changed. Castiel hadn’t been able to deny it, and he admitted, it was nice to have someone to share the secret with.
Comments are definitely appreciated!! I'd love to hear what you think so far!
He growled in frustration, pushing at the edges of the blindfold with his palms in a vain effort to dislodge it. But it was useless, someone had added extra chin, head and neck straps designed to keep the blindfold 'secure'. Castiel liked those, he said it was because they prevented the blindfold from moving around too much, but Dean knew it was also to prevent him removing it without permission, which Dean knew he had a tendency to do.
They can see that it had really started to become painful for Dean. The spasms had settled, but the cramps were building up agonisingly instead. The blindfold now wet with tears, and his grunts and moans almost constant.
“It’s mainly just a favourite trope of trashy romance novels, which is probably why you’ve even heard of it at all,” Cas sighs, he sounds regretful “But yes, Dean’s susceptible to involuntary drops and obedience commands. Not from just anyone, mind you, but from a strong dominant, someone he trusts, he can be dropped involuntarily. But I generally try not to use it,”
"On top of that, you are experiencing a high level of physical pain and mental discomfort, which is making it difficult to think rationally right now. This will probably happen many, many more times and that's ok. It's about calming the overactive part of your brain that's activating your 'fight or flight' response and retraining your instincts. Teaching you that you are safe, that you want this and learning to trust. It's all going to take time. You need to be patient with yourself,"
A wave of newly formed rage seethed up inside him again.
"You too," Dean smiled up to where he hoped Balthazar was standing. He suddenly felt uncomfortable, once again reminded of how strange he must look with the thick straps of the blindfold fastened around his head and neck, "Uh, Cas?"
The timer rang out and startled Dean slightly, "It's alright," Benny’s voice was warm with affection, "We're just going to ease you up a moment and then you can release,"
"He put anything else in there, besides saline?" Dean asked, sure he could feel the hazy edge of drugs in his system.
particular expression on Castiel’s face... Dean grinned, just pooling in his groin. Now that he was getting stronger, the want was becoming more powerful each time ...  he felt the pressure of an erection build and for a moment it felt so good, so right. Until a lancing pain shot up from his groin
"Whatever you say, you're the doctor," Dean doesn't sound convinced, but he doesn't argue, "What's your plan anyway? Now that you're in charge." Now he does sound a little nervous, and a little upset. He was still too exhausted and sick to really put up much of a fight, about it, but Cas knew it would be coming eventually.
Dean was responding as he had hoped he might, the loss of control, immobility and discomfort combining with his desperate need to submit and be reassured, to help him relax into it, deep dropping was always so cathartic for him. Castiel just hoped it would come easier for him in the future.
“Now I’ll inflate a small balloon that will put pressure on either side of his opening and keep the liquid inside,”
“Just a little more,” Cas told him, using his other hand to wipe away the wetness that had snuck out from under his blindfold, "just relax, Benny will be gentle,"
Cas brushed the greasy hair back from his forehead, "Thank you. I promise, you'll feel so much better afterwards,"
“It’s long overdue. I know you struggle to drop, but it's good for you, necessary. You know that” Cas reminded him kindly. He reached under the bed for the bag of restraints he kept there and pulled out the blindfold.
"Really!? You're going to gag me? FUCK YOU!"
"It's alright." Castiel kept his hand on the blindfold, palm pushing against it so that Dean could feel the pressure and the control. "You were just doing what you were trained to do. I'm not mad."
"Cas?" Dean asks.
"After we get him stabilized, we'll need to establish a longer-term hydration and feeding schedule that will be strictly enforced. Priority treatments will include bladder training, anal and vaginal dilation..."
Shakily he pushed both palms against the door and using his arms, pulled himself back up to his feet. He reached forward, grasping around for the deadbolt, he could hear the voices. They were calmer now, almost soothing as they spoke to him, but the words just washed over him. Pushed back by the anger and his determination. They didn't try to touch him anymore.
"It's different for everyone. Some people respond well to treatment and only need to have it in for a few days every couple of months. For others it's a couple of days a week. It really depends. But initially, it always requires a period of continuous treatment before a routine can be established."
, how revolting. He can tell that his eyes are wet under the blindfold when moisture starts to leak out underneath. Cas is there immediately with a soft cloth, clearing the evidence away kindly.
He knew what was coming. Castiel had talked him through a treatment plan several times already, and each time Dean had outright refused.
He was already pushing down on the foot pedal that rotated the chair into a slightly more upright position. Still keeping Dean's legs held in a wide apart in the open position, but at this angle, he was held directly above the basin that Benny had slid out from underneath.
However, I will be starting you on your new medication regimen tomorrow. I'll go over each medication with you then as well as the schedule and dosage you'll be receiving. But for today, I just want you to relax. Focus on recovering your strength. Do you think you can eat?"
"You won’t be left alone, but just in case you need or want anything, for the kitchen Dial 112, my phone is 100, Benny’s is 102, my assistant's is 101, security is 111, Sam's room is 124, your room will be 125. But it's all written here on the back of the phone if you forget."
"Later," he pulled the covers over himself.
"Rest for a bit," Castiel advised, "let your body calm down too,"
Dean struggles to sit up, but mostly fails, instead turning his head to look around the clinic, "You got a shower somewhere nearby?"
"Hmmm…" Cas agreed. It wasn't likely.
He wants to scream, but he can’t, his muscles relaxing and his breath calming with the command. His brain floods with soothing neurochemicals, responding to the command. Ordering him down.
there. This time he’d agreed to all of it ahead of time. And to add insult to injury, he’d even gotten himself up out of the wheelchair and with Benny’s help, voluntarily lowered himself down.
“Okay, a bit wider now.” Castiel warns, then Dean hears a click and a slight metallic whir before his legs are opened wider and wider, knees pushed back too, his thighs stretched open to their limit. He’s completely exposed. Even the base of the chair tilts slightly so that his pelvis is angled to make access and visibility easier.
Castiel had already explained the plan, step by dreadful step.  Once he was opened up today, he would be kept open, and not only that, over time he would be gradually opened even wider and taken deeper. Then he’ll be kept that way, Castiel had patiently explained
"Enough already!" he grumbled.
"It's just… it's weird talking to people with this," he gestures a little vaguely at his own head, "strapped to my head."
He’s rewarded with a kiss pressed to his lips and the whispered praise, “You’re also being very good.”
“Tell me,” Cas enquires, his face open and curious, “Is there anything else I can do for you? Something you want?”
Benny immediately held a cup with a straw to Dean's lips, "It's alright to drink now, friend. You won't retain it anymore. Your bladder is empty and the flow is open,"
“Of course,” Castiel’s rough voice, heavy with unspoken emotion, “Anything.”
"I'm, yeah ok. Thanks," Dean seems shocked, "Can't believe you're giving me rules already, not even one day owning my contract."
Chapter specific warnings: feeding tubes, medication use,
He knew that loyalty would now be expanded to include Sam and Dean. Especially now that Dean was officially under his guardianship and protection.  Castiel had always been open and honest with them, and he continued to be so about his plans with Dean.
Dean made a contented little grunt which he took as agreement. He seemed to be enjoying the oral attention, so Cas pushed another finger inside and kept them there, rubbing gently over his tongue and occasionally pushing back into his throat just shy of setting off his gag reflex.
Sam nodded, "Yeah, he's an excellent liar." He doesn't sound pleased about it, "You won't be able to rely on what he tells you. You'll need to use tests and you own examinations,"
"Cas?" Dean's confused,
Dean nodded in agreement, pleased not to be made to explain himself.
In his mind Dean screamed. Castiel knew exactly what he was doing when he chose that gag.
"I know. I expected this to happen just not quite so soon," Castiel's voice sounded rueful and bitterly amused, "You are one of the most resourceful and resilient men I've ever met, so of course you were going to try it, on the very first opportunity that presented itself. It was my fault for not adequately supervising you and making sure you were safely secured. I'm sorry about that. It must have been so distressing to wake up all alone." He hugged Dean tighter.
Three minutes later, Dean was still panting but was otherwise silent as the liquid finally escaped from his body. Castiel could clearly see the exhaustion in his sluggish, uncoordinated movements. He’d been running on adrenaline and now it was wearing off. After this he would likely crash even worse than before, likely to be barely conscious at all for the next few days.
When everything else in his life is full of chaos, confusion and deceit.One irreconcilable fact remains the same: Castiel loves him.
“Sure thing!” Benny cheerily agreed. Dean could hear them quickly swapping spots so that now Castiel stood beside him, while Benny sat between his legs.
He fights back the voice, the memory of his father, telling him how disgusting he is for wanting
This morning, neither Cas nor Dean wanted to admit the day had begun. Instead, Dean snuggled in even tighter to Cas, determined to forget the world existed for a little while longer and ignore the bothersome morning sneaking its light across the floorboards.
"You gave us a fright, mate." Dean had his ear pressed up against Benny’s chest, it felt nice, "If I ask you a few questions, do you think you can answer by nodding or shaking your head for me?"
"I know that this isn't going to be easy to hear but Dean has been lying to you. Probably right from the beginning."
“Feet up first. I’m going to strap them into the stirrups for your safety and mine,” Benny chuckles a little, “No one likes a kick in the head, no matter how accidental,”
Dean could feel Castiel's sincerity flickering down through their link. It was hard to stay mad at him when he
Cas doesn't reply. Seeing how much distress this is causing Dean. Instead, he leans over to Balthazar and asks, "Can you get me a gag, please? Number six?"
Dean tries not to freak out at that terrifying prospect.
"I won't allow him to harm you, I promise. You are my only priority."
He'd also felt anger at John, a man so blind and selfish that he taught Dean that the only option he had was to hide his pain. And he was angry at himself, for allowing Dean to continue hurting himself, knowing it was the only way he would be able to help him. Only when Dean couldn't hide anymore when it had gotten so bad that he was forced to admit it, when Sam was so overwhelmed and distraught, that either one of them could accept assistance.
Dean grit his teeth and tried not to be resentful, tried to remind himself how much he actually wanted this. How they were doing this
, OUT!
Cas nods, checking his watch, “In about 20 minutes, I have you scheduled for your next treatment session.”
He vaguely registered voices, anxious words and his name being called out. But he ignored them all. Instead, focusing on finding where the carpet changed to tile and following it to the edge of the doorway.
Cas finally told Benny to stop the flow, just as a major cramp sends Dean’s body ratcheting up against the straps and crying out around the gag involuntarily. Dean's was openly sobbing, but his grip on the ball in his hand tight as ever, his face peaceful.
comforting to get him through his.
“We’re going to do a basic physical first. Then we’ll move on to your pelvic exam and dilation treatment. First up, I want you to tell me about your body. Just like you did yesterday.”
Castiel had settled for intravenous nutrition instead, not a perfect solution, but it would suffice for now. He'd been tempted to start nasogastric tube feeding earlier than planned but worried that he might wake up during the insertion and find it distressing. He planned to give Dean an endoscopy soon, and figure out exactly what he was working with, but knew that refeeding would need to start first.
Sam owned Dean, and he had done something terrible.
Balthazar was incredibly quick and skilled at fitting it. In less than a minute, he had all the pieces inserted correctly and the front panel fastened securely. There was no way Dean was getting it off himself.
He was practically begging to be taken down. No wonder he was fighting for control, challenging everything and everyone. He needed to drop and drop
It’s hard, but he has to admit that Castiel has a point.  It's a weakness ... a pathetic truth about himself, that he’d much rather be asleep in a hospital bed, than rotting away in some cell.  It's not like he didn't already know... Dean tries to ignore the bitter bite of self-loathing.
Exhausted and defeated he slid to the floor. Sobbing with anger and frustration. In a final effort, he raised his mitted hands up to his head, trying to dislodge the blindfold again. It was still weakened from where he had cut it earlier, just maybe he could….
"I'm sorry sweetheart. I know that won't be easy for you. But it's necessary" he kissed the cheek where the bruise was forming, "You can start now. Just list for me each place in your body where you are currently experiencing pain or discomfort. I won't make you rate it, not yet anyway, we'll work on that another time."
Dean had to stop himself from ducking, dodging a bottle that he knew wasn’t thrown.
"Cas!" He cried out, unsure what he was asking for but desperate for it anyway.
Abruptly, he was
Another shake.
"I think you woke up alone and confused. You felt sore and afraid, so you did what you were trained to do. Get yourself free. And that's a good thing….normally."
sick!”
Castiel shakes his head, "As you and Sam will now be living here on a longer-term basis your things have been moved from the guest wing to more permanent rooms. Sam has selected a set of rooms that look out over the western gardens, but due the need to have you nearer these clinical rooms, your belongings and my own have been moved into the rooms directly above us. There is an elevator from the clinic to our private wing just outside this door. Once you've recovered enough to be transported up to our rooms, I'll show you around,"
"Ok," Dean can hear the warmth in Castiel's breath against his cheek as he spoke,"Rule Number 2. You must be completely honest and forthcoming with information regarding your body. No omissions or hiding of injuries either. When requested you must give a detailed account of any and all pain and/or discomfort you are experiencing. You must fully answer all questions I ask about your body and you must immediately notify one of us of any new pain or discomfort as it develops."
"Protect me?" Dean's back to confused and he’s refusing to let Castiel touch him. Pushing further away from him across the floor.
But the contract security teams were forbidden from entering the central gardens and grounds. Castiel had a small inner circle of staff who he trusted completely, people he could rely upon for their discretion and loyalty. The main staff included nurses, a chef, cleaners, groundskeepers, his PA, bodyguards (several would now be assigned to Dean exclusively), a driver and an office manager. Many of them had worked for his family for generations.
"That's good, brother. Thank you. An easy one first, ok?”
But before he can, Castiel takes his hand. And with his other hand slips his palm under Dean's chin, and forces his gaze up to meet his own. Dean's expects to see reproach, and blame. But instead, he is met with fondness, a tender, knowing gaze waiting there. Cas speaks firmly, but also keeps his tone gentle, knowing how hard this is for Dean to hear.
His feet and ankles are fasted into the rests, then a loud click is heard and his legs are forced even further apart as the chair automatically shifts his knees backwards and out. Dean starts to pant, he always feels so vulnerable in this position, but he supposes that's the point. Blindfolded and silent, open and exposed to them all, powerless and forced to endure everything Cas, Sam and Benny decide to do to him.
"How?" Sam's voice was hard, angry. Like he'd been expecting this, and it pissed him off. But his eyes were terrified. "Tell me exactly. How bad is it?"
“Oh, sweetheart. I’d offer you anything. If you’d let me, I could make it so good.”
Dean tucks his face into Castiel’s neck and groans “I regret asking now!” He adds with an overly dramatic sigh, but no real vehemence.
The first step was preparing Sam for what was ahead. Although he had signed the primary guardianship over, Castiel still knew he needed Sam on board for every step of the way or it wasn't going to work. This was a conversation he had prepared for, but was dreading nonetheless.
He launched himself at Castiel.
Dean nodded, making agreeable sounds around the fingers. Cas pulled them out, much to Dean's dismay, but soon slid his arm under Dean's armpit and leveraged them both up off the ground.
Behind and underneath, the chair were various medical apparatus and tools to be used as necessary such as IV poles which could be locked into place, oxygen hoses, enema tubes etc. There was also a row of medical supply cabinets and a sink along the wall beside them.  Here the floor was tiled, with drains fitted in several strategic places so Dean could be washed while in the chair and a flushable basin able to be pulled forward from underneath and locked neatly underneath Dean's genitals for enemas and douching as needed.
Cas just nodded, like he was expecting that answer, but pleased that Dean was willing to eat anyway. He picked the phone up off the wall by the bed, he held it out for Dean so he could see the back where it was labelled with a series of numbers and words.
"Oh thank fuck," Dean couldn't help feeling desperately grateful for that. His last few weeks had been a misery, of constant urgency without being able to properly relieve himself. He still felt bruised inside, like he'd taken a beating.
Between the pain and the humiliation, it’s agonisingly wonderful. Just to sink into the feeling of Cas brushing his fingers through his hair, whispering gentle words of encouragement and care, to give up everything else and just
Cas folds back the bottom of his hospital gown, and neatly rests it on his stomach before taking his hand, the one without the ball, in his own, “Are you ready to get started?”
Warnings: catheters, John Winchester's abusive parenting,
Cas took his hand, careful not to disturb the cannula, "You will eat them again, I promise,"
“Yes, you. do.” The steel is back in Cas's voice, and a new undercurrent of anger, “Listen, I would give anything to wipe away that aspect of your past, and the people who made you believe you aren’t worthy of protection and care. But I can’t. The best I can do is make sure you’re safe now, and legal protection is a major part of it. I won't regret doing anything I can to keep you safe.”
"I’m so sorry it's come to this. I wanted you to do this voluntarily, but I won't let you hurt yourself anymore. I just can't let it continue."
Dean blushes, “That was
"When do we wake him?"
“Fair enough,” Benny’s tone held no anger, he almost sounded affectionate when he added, “Next up, I’m going to inject a medicated gel down inside your urethra. I’ve warmed it up slightly, but it still might feel a little uncomfortable going in. it’ll help with the discomfort of the insertion.”
Castiel shook his head as he peered at the nozzles critically. They were the smallest diameter available, but he still doubted Dean would find that any comfort. He'd definitely be up for a struggle.  "He's had enemas before but he very much dislikes them. He tolerated a small one the last time they visited, but it was a struggle. It's one of the only treatments he would allow, and only then because it made sex between us easier."
He can’t believe he hadn’t thought of it immediately,
“This is the last one right? You aren’t gonna force a third one inside me?”
"That doesn't…I mean...loads of other people like rules," Dean grumbles.
He doesn't understand why, or how. But he knows that it's true.
“Yes.” Castiel agreed immediately, “I did promise that....”
Cas reached over and slid the blindfold over Dean’s eyes, giving him the security and comfort he found in it. Dean started to shake a little through, so he took his mitted hands in his own, hoping the contact might steady him. He couldn't help the rush of concern that flooded him at the thinness of the bones and muscles under his hands.
Dean always dropped best when obedience was demanded and body control were removed, particularly when immobilisation and loss of autonomy were involved.
He lifted his hips, quietly testing if the waistband strap was still secured, but even that had been left off. They were planning on moving him soon, he guessed, probably even in the next few minutes. He needed to move fast.
"Good," Castiel massages his thumbs across Dean's cheek encouragingly, pressing his palm to feel the molded, flexible plastic, "Just keep working it with your tongue. It'll help you relax,"
"You have no idea how much I miss being able to eat that man's pies. Best I've ever tasted," Dean’s expression turned a little darker, a little sad at what he’d lost.
“Swap places with me,” Castiel instructs Benny, his voice drifting up from between Dean’s spread legs, and he can hear them walking, changing places so Cas is now beside him, touching his neck, his face, kissing his cheek.
He pulled forward, away from Castiel's embrace, shocked. Angry. His mind just barely holding the swell of emotions back.
"With your health so fragile,” Castiel confesses in return, "I had to do something to protect you.”
Dean thought for a moment, debating whether he should press Castiel about the medications. That Castiel no longer hesitated when he talked about treatments or medications and had made the decision to give Dean pain relief without consulting him or Sam, even though he knew Dean hated the feeling it left him with. Castiel now spoke with firm finality as if the decision was already made and out of Dean’s hands, which he supposed it now was. He could tell that something had fundamentally changed between them and in their relationship.
But of course, he was caught easily.
Pulled into solid, loving arms and gripped tight. The blindfold and his weakness from malnutrition and illness made his efforts pale. Castiel held him immobile, tucking his hands under his own armpits and rocking them both back and forward gently. Firmly encircling him with his arms.
Cas took one look at Dean and it was like a switch was flipped. He was no longer the lover, welcoming his partner home. Now, standing in front of them was the cold and efficient Dr Novak, and he had clearly been expecting this.
"The day after tomorrow," Cas kissed him, gently, sweetly, " We can talk about it again tomorrow, but first, you need a good night's sleep. How about we move you to a real bed?"
Cas just smoothes his hand along the inside of his thigh and shushes him, it feels strange, until he realises that it’s the plastic of the glove, making his touch seem more clinical.
“We could,” Cas agrees, “But it won’t help you either. If I was to leave the catheter at this minimal size, if it was never increased, you’d be at risk of closing up again within a day or two of removal. But if we move up to the larger diameter tubes, you could have weeks.  I know you don’t like getting it changed out, but it’s necessary.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He wanted to mentally kick himself
Dean startles, suddenly wide awake and alert. He sits up, instinctively trying to get away from the stranger watching him sleep.
"Ok, this is the bed" Benny says, as they come to a stop. He felt the lift, but didn't fight it, and soon he's settled back against the mattress.
Please do comments and let me know what you think! Suggestions/prompts welcome.
“Alright Dean,” Castiel said in his Doctor voice, “As I promised, I’m going to talk you through absolutely everything we’re doing today so there are no surprises. If you have any questions or concerns, let us know.”
“We’re working on it, he’s just starting to go down,” Cas starts running his fingers through his hair and scratching the back of his scalp just the way he likes it, Dean can feel himself melting under the attention, “He needed it, he hasn’t dropped in weeks and was pushing for it. And I thought it might be a good opportunity to show Sam how I drop him and what a full drop looks like,”
“Keep going, but slow the flow a bit.”
Benny chucked but kept pressing down on the plunger steadily, until about a minute later he’d pushed the entire syringeful deep inside.
His thoughts swirled and cascaded around inside his mind, it was like looking through a kaleidoscope, all jumbled and confusing.
PLEASE NOTE: This fic is currently on hiatus but I will be continuing it!
They let him release. It felt awful and amazing all at once. Dean wanted to cry and beg and laugh, he felt a bit hysterical at all the emotions cascading inside him at finally being done. But also contented at finishing a task set by his alpha, his dominant, his mate.
Dean sighed, feeling just a hint of bitterness.
"Sweetheart, it's ok" Cas soothed his hand across Dean's forehead and easing the blindfold back into the correct position. Once again sending his world into total darkness.
Cas had replaced the heat pack an hour or so earlier, careful not to wake the exhausted man, and that had helped settle him somewhat. He was tempted to dose him with a mild sedative through his IV but decided against it. His body was already working hard enough, Cas didn’t want to add any additional medications unless they were necessary.
to be here. I want to be with you. I want to get better because I’m so fucking sick of always
(See the end of the chapter for
"No, fucking way. Your brother's with that arsehole shrink?!" Dean bit out. Suddenly putting two-and-two together and getting negative four. He knew exactly who Castiel was referring to.
If every small thing was going to be such a fight, he didn’t know how Dean was going to cope with it all. He
But just as Benny was about to push in the final section, Dean shook his head. Or at least he tried to. He was prevented by the forehead strap and the fingers in his mouth, Cas’s hand holding his chin securely still. Instead, he let out a begging, plaintive "Nnnnnn!"
"Do you want the blindfold off?" Castiel asked meekly. Like he was scared to ask the question.
his muddled brain finally provided.
But then Cas smiled happy and relieved, obviously pleased to see Dean awake and looking much more alert.  Dean couldn’t help but feel something heavy in his chest start to lift. There was always something reassuring about waking up in his presence, so necessary.
As a reward he pushed his fingers back into Dean's mouth, letting him resume lapping at them contentedly for a little while. "Very good. Calm and relaxed. Let it all go,"
"I know, I know. I'm so sorry, sweetheart," all anger, all frustration gone from Castiel's voice and replaced with worry and sadness, “I'm going as fast as I dare.”
Dean thought for a moment, the task seemed impossible,"I… um uh...not sure really sure?"
, Dean decided.
He felt his breath start to slow down a bit as he was forced to push it through the plastic opening, it was nice in a way to have something to focus his breathing on.
Just enough to catch Castiel's worried, shocked expression as he rushed over to him. Just enough to meet his disappointed gaze. Dean felt the weight of it crashing down around him.
"What did you sign?" Dean's voice's cold, numb and monotone, sounding off even to himself. Disassociation he realises.
Soon, Benny and Cas have the rest of the straps done up tight; chest, arms, wrists, calves, neck, they’d even attached clips to the side of the blindfold, so it held his head in place, he could still turn his head slightly, but he couldn’t raise it up off the headrest.
Cas can see the moment Dean comes to this realisation that the tube is going to need to stay. And that eventually the flow rate will need to be increased. Cas can see the moment he understands that it's not going to just be just for today, or this week, or even this month. That he'll be agreeing to months of this feeling of overfullness, of discomfort, and he just can't make himself agree that, it's too hard. He can't bring himself to say it, even though he knows he must, that he needs this.
“Already?” Sam asks, sounding worried, “He’s hurting already?”
Castiel does reach over this time, pulling Sam into a hug, letting him rest his head on Cas's shoulder for a moment.
Despite the discomfort, it was clear that Dean was successfully maintaining his subspace, possibly even dropping further down. Perfectly under, deep into submission and responding beautifully to dominance, it was wonderful to observe. Dean may not like enemas, but beyond the medical necessity, they also seemed to be an effective way to help him maintain headspace.
“And he’s down. Fucking finally!” The strain and the relief clear in Benny’s voice, “Jesus, I’ve never seen anyone fight it that hard. Is it like that every time?”
“None,” Castiel fixed him with a hard, assessing look, “It’s not healthy for you to have access to it right now. If you want to call someone you can use this phone or if you need distraction, I can bring you something to read or music to listen to instead. ”
Benny caught Cas's gaze and shared a sad, knowing look. They both regretted having to continue with the next one, but there was nothing for it, this wasn't nearly finished.
It was true, Castiel had warned him, all the doctors had warned him. Cas had begged. Sam had begged.
"My cheek feels like I took a punch. I have a headache, but I always have one. Oh and my hip hurts where I fell on it." He let out a bitter sort of laugh, "So overall, pretty normal for me."
"I told you this might happen," Castiel's voice full of solemn, cold reproach, "That with your condition, things can go very wrong, very fast. And now they have. You need to comply with treatment. I need to know that you understand."
The treatment planned for today was exactly what he needed.
“Can’t we stay at this size for a few more days? It can’t hurt waiting.”
Even as Cas, gentle as ever, patiently waited each time he needed a break, his breath still caught and his teeth ground down each time Cas so much as shifted the tube, he constantly fought back the edge of panic.
Although his brother had held his guardianship since their father had passed away, they barely spoke about it, barely acknowledged the fact that Sam basically owned Dean.
Cas hung up the phone, "He said he'd heat up some soup and also send up some chocolate mousse. Apparently he's  under the impression you have a sweet tooth."
Later that day Dean was angry, again.
The decision Sam had already made, while driving his brother towards Cas's home. Here is the only place Dean asked to go. When he was hurting, when scared, this is the only place he ever felt safe.
Dean didn't respond except to huff out a breath indignantly.
Dean closes his eyes again, but nods, his voice sounds tired, like he's losing the fight for consciousness already, "Okay, if you say so…. Just gonna shut my eyes for a moment,"
Dean nods.
! It sounded like Castiel had already decided.
But instead of pulling the thing out completely, Benny left the rigid end still in, three inches of hard plastic tube still stuck in his dick because Benny had only removed the syringe. He left it like that, the rigid plastic holding Dean’s hole open and ready for the next one. Benny leant over to grasp another syringe from the tray beside him,
this pain was. And just as quickly as the fantasy came, it was doused out by the cold brutal reminder,
"Oh, right. Shit. That's… it feels really weird," Dean reaches up and goes to touch the tube, but Cas leans over and moves his hand away.
"I just can't! Don't you get that?!" Dean can't seem to find the words to explain the knawing, creeping fear that's climbing up his vertebrae and sinking its claws into the back of his skull. The pain and powerlessness that it brings.
Dean had told him once, in the quiet pre-dawn hours, he'd whispered into the darkness a little of his pain. He explained that he had been taught to fight not only his body’s needs but also his mind’s. John, he told Castiel, had detested that his son was an omega, even more so, a submissive. He’s simultaneously abused Dean’s dynamic by demanding obedience from the young sub, while also forcing him to hide and deny his own submissive nature.
Cas thinks for a moment, remembering the conversation. His voice taking a softer, kinder tone as he explains, “Once we started, Gabriel quickly came to realise that I wasn't actually being overprotective nor overstating your vulnerability. Unfortunately, I was right. Gabe told me he’d struggled too. That after the assessment, he’d been so affected by it, he’d taken several days leave.”
"You won't have to," Cas cuts in, "You're stable enough now to be moved, so we're going to transfer your care to the treatment room. We'll bathe you there."
But, Cas just continued speaking, oblivious to the storm brewing, the misery engulfing Dean's mind.
Cas shot him an angry look, but nodded, Good Enough. It was obvious how much pain Dean was in and he couldn't let it continue. He cared too deeply for this frustrating, disaster of an Omega, to let anything harm him. The conversation would have to come later.
He rubs the inside of Dean’s knee encouragingly, before moving up to press his fingers into the area above his pelvis, where his bladder rests, “Soon we’ll need to start you on a urination schedule. Right now, it’s not a significant concern, as it’s been adequately dilated as a consequence of your urethral constriction. But with that issue now addressed, we’ll need to make sure it retains the current capacity.”
"It's ok," Cas reassures them both, "You don't have to decide. I know it's too hard right now, so I'm going to make the choice for you. The tube is going to stay in. You'll be sitting in Joe's kitchen eating pie again in no time, I promise."
He'd hated every moment of it.They treated him too gently, like he was vulnerable, like he might break. They wouldn't let him make any decisions for himself.They treated him like he was fragile, with their fake concern. The doctors, the counsellors, the nurses, all of them conspiring to take everything away from him.
Dean thought about that. About one day wanting this, giving Castiel that control and it being a gift, a demonstration of his submission, of love. For a moment it felt so real, so possible,  enticing even   Kneeling beside their bed and offering up the tube to him like a gift, asking him to take control like that, it felt... Something heavy and warm settles down inside his body, heat pooling, lust swirling at the back of his mind....
“I love an incredible man,” Cas says with the hint of a smile playing around the edges of his lips. “He's got great aim with a pistol, loves sappy hospital dramas, reading Kerouac and is learning to cook. The man I love raised his brother right. He gave him a childhood full of affection and support, something he never received himself. Demonstrating through his actions how to show compassion and take responsibility.  He's kind. Thoughtful and generous to a fault, especially when he thinks no one will notice. Funny. Oh and smart too, even though he won’t admit it." Cas is outright smiling now, his expression teasing, "He's also kinda clumsy and adorably grumpy when he's tired."But Castiel's voice turns sad when he adds, "He also expects too much of himself and too little of others, too quick to belittle and undervalue himself..."
This conversation had been coming for weeks, the dread building inside him. He knew pain and could deal with it, but this was something else, this was something
In sympathy Castiel relented a little and unclipped the forehead strap. That way Dean was able to seek the comfort and contact he needed more readily and Castiel wanted to allow it.  Turning his cheek into Castiel's hand and scenting his wrist, a momentary, hidden look of contentment ghosted across his face. But, It was soon chased away by the next cramp, and replaced with an angry snarl. Cas was pleased to see the smile's appearance, however fleeting.
Castiel sighs, "You like being gagged..."
He was exhausted. Down to the bone tired and Castiel seemed to sense it. With a loud click, he pushed the base section of the table back up into place and then he picked up each of Dean's feet, placing them gently back down so he was finally laying flat.
It had felt like he was burning. Like he was drowning.  For a moment he was disoriented, unsure. Reaching around in his mind for the spark that had lit the Bonfire.
"Please Sammy," Dean felt small, abandoned, "You need to tell me. Maybe we can still annul the contract, it might not be too late. Just tell me it wasn't a fucking care home, or a facility. Please tell me you aren't locking me away." He could hear the panic start to bleed into his voice, those places were terrifying.
Dean can't move, he just stares, watching his brother's shoulders rise and fall with heavy sobbing breaths. He feels numb. Confused. He's not sure what this even means.
Expelling had always been the hardest part for Dean. In the past, he'd always insisted that Castiel leave the room while he'd evacuated. However, this time he had no other option but to release the liquid while they all watched. Cas knew this would truly test his ability to maintain a submissive headspace, humiliation wasn't part of his dynamic so he was definitely going to struggle.
Chapter warnings: Enemas, restraints, hurt/comfort of the physical and emotional kind.
But Benny made it fit, his firm, ceaseless motions pushing the slick plastic tube  first just past the head and then down the length of his penis. Inch by gradual inch.
Cas took his silence as an opportunity to continue, "As I was saying, Dimeroski Syndrome is chronic, progressive and inevitably fatal if left untreated." He pauses for impact, but Dean just rolls his eyes at him, "However, if intensive treatment starts early, the condition can be successfully managed. It is characterised by a progressive reduction and tightening of many of the passages and organs throughout the digestive and reproductive systems of the body. Fortunately, several treatments and medications have been developed which allow for successful dilation and maintenance of the affected systems. With intensive treatment and constant monitoring for compliance, the patient can go on to live a full and healthy life."
Dean is already feeling his pulse slowing, his breath evening out. But his hands keep shaking. He clenches them into fists to hide it.
This time it's Dean who pulls Castiel into the kiss.
Dean wants to scream, he feels like his whole body is shaking with it. It hurts...but even more, he feels so powerless, his body betraying his mind.
Finally, finally that goddamn flow was stopped. Dean felt beyond full, beyond stretched and heavy. His body felt sore in places he didn't even want to think about, a deep internal ache. He groaned, frustrated and sore.
"Get Out!" He screamed, white hot and burning with it. "Leave me the fuck alone! All of you!"
"You're right. Whatever you require from me, I'll support you. Dean needs me to be strong."
Submission was meant to be a release, a joy. It was meant to be easy.
Cas smiles down at him, “I suppose it is. He was rather annoyed with me.  Although usually, it’s  me telling him to be sensible, not the other way round.”
“I don’t need another,” Dean’s voice was high and anxious.
"I'm sorry!" Dean choked out, "I don't know why I did that,"
But Dean can’t.
"I want you to know that the anger you sense from me, is not directed at you, only at myself. I should have controlled for this and managed the situation better. I had just finished preparing you to transfer upstairs when I got an important phone call. I didn't want to disturb your sleep, so I slipped out into the corridor to answer it. It was only for a couple of minutes, but obviously enough time for you to put yourself at serious risk, and even hurt yourself. For that I'm so sorry,"
Dean can hear the click of the buckle coming undone, he immediately pushes up, the instinctive urge to stand, to get away from this, the fear is overwhelming. He fights the hands that grab his arms, his chest, his legs, as they pick him up.
Nervously clenching and unclenching his fists, wishing he had the mitts back so he had something to press against.
But Cas apparently, had other ideas, because after a moment he turned around to face Dean directly. Sitting them both up and meeting Dean's eyes with a purposeful expression. His voice firm, determined, he said,  “Let me tell you about the man I love.”
"Dean, that isn't true," he admonished, sounding disappointed, "It's important that you don't lie about your health." Castiel fell silent for a moment, thinking, "I can see that you may need some additional assistance with this. How about a new rule?"
“Dean,” Castiel had his Doctor voice back, “The gel needs to penetrate as deeply as possible. It will act as a lubricant so when we insert the tube, it will go smoothly. It’s also a medication to help your urethra gain flexibility and better accommodate long-term use of the catheter andl help with the pain.”
"As we can't fill him up with an adequately large volume, we can use the tube to work the solution in as deeply as possible." Benny explains "It's not a comfortable process, but it is necessary."
“I’m attaching a syringe to the tube. This will allow me to withdraw the liquid from the balloon inside your bladder. The balloon is there so the tube doesn’t slip out.” Benny explains.
"Uh…Yeah?..." Dean stumbles over the unfamiliar ground, "…Yes," He raised his mitted hand slightly shakily, reaching out nervously into the air. But it was grasped almost immediately, by a sure, welcoming grip.
“Amongst a range of legal protections, it means that if you're picked up by the police, they can’t actually arrest you. They can’t even question you. Instead, they are legally required to follow your Vulnerable Persons Care Plan, which mandates that you are to be immediately transported to the nearest hospital, sedated and your guardian contacted. The hospital will check you over and then release you into the care of your guardian who will then act on your behalf with the authorities."
"I fucked up. All right?" He didn't mean the words as an attack, but they came out like that anyway, biting and snarling, "and I didn't tell anyone. Now everything goddamn hurts."
Benny moved out of the way to give Castiel access, as he took the position between Dean's legs, careful to maintain precious contact with skin.
that Cas did it out of genuine loving concern. Clearly, from his perspective, he’d done the only thing he could in a bad situation.
Soon they're moving again, out the lift and down a corridor. Into what he presumes is his room. He can't see it but right now, he doesn't care to either. He’s just too exhausted to want anything else but sleep.
"No, No. I don't need…" Dean started, but was cut off by Castiel pressing a couple of fingers into his mouth. Pushing them in and out, massaging along his tongue until Dean instinctively began to suck. It felt so good, almost immediately helping calm his racing thoughts.
"My stomach feels strange, too full, it's really uncomfortable. And my throat hurts. What's up with that?"
He could also hear the low crackle of what he presumed was a radio playing, likely coming from another room, distorted by distance and space. And the hum of the air-conditioning vent, one directly above him, while there were another two or three scattered about the room.
But just as he was carefully placing them back onto the counter he heard a sound.
Dean growled in frustration,
It took a moment for Dean to get to his feet and then to stabilise himself. But Castiel was patient, giving him time to catch his breath before he guided him over to the sofa.
"Just... Take me to Cas. I don't want to talk about it," he tried to keep his voice steady, but he'd be lucky if he remained conscious for the rest of the conversation, let alone long enough to convince Sam to shut up and drive him to the Castiel's estate.
Dean had told him that he didn't think he ever had. Not with his Father, or Sam, or anyone else for that matter. Not even alone. The possibility that utterly terrified Castiel most was that maybe he just wasn’t able to let himself fall, not fully anyway, that his brain just wasn’t capable of it. That he would always need to be forced to go down.
(See the end of the chapter for
Anxious confusion. The sight of the scissors on the floor. He moaned, dragging his gaze back to Castiel, reaching out for him, suddenly needing him near.
Castiel picked up the phone, "Don't bother sending the food up after all, Dean's out again. ‘But is Benny there? Can you ask him to head over please, I'll need him to help with Dean’s feeding tube."
"Why are you pushing it in further?" Sam asks, leaning forward to observe Benny's fingers.
Balthazar had the wheelchair pulled up next to him, Dean could hear him locking the tires.
Cas knew he had never let himself actually submit properly in front of Sam, terrified that he wouldn’t be able to handle it.
"Yep," Dean aimed for nonchalant, but came across more petulant sounding, "Good as new. Thanks for fixing me up. Sam and I will be out of your hair as soon as you unhook me, we left halfway through a hunt. Gotta get back to it," he gestured to the IV and catheter bag he could see hanging on the side of the bed.
“I…” Dean doesn’t want to reply.
A sort of animal sound was forced out of him, like a grunt but deeper and longer.
Dean couldn’t really argue with that logic, but he didn’t have to like it either.
It felt enormous. He couldn’t help but be reminded of it every time he shifted even the tiniest fraction. The uncomfortable wrongness of the plastic pushing deep inside his body, holding him open in places that should never be forced open. He wanted to pull it
"From hitting the ground earlier?"
Mugs of tea, long ago finished, sat on the coffee table in front of them as dawn began lazily painting it’s way across the sky. The house was quiet, most of the other residents still asleep. In the past, they’d often bonded like this, tangled up together on the sofa or wrapped up blankets on the balcony, their face turned upwards, mapping the stars. They liked to talk at night or before dawn, chatting about simple or complex things, sharing funny stories or whispered truths. Taking time for each other while the rest of the world slept.
“You know...” Dean eventually said, “I should have guessed. You're overprotective and obsessively thorough, so of course you'd follow through. I knew what I was signing up for going into the relationship with you.” he confessed quietly, his voice full of tenderness and resignation, “I guess I just wasn’t ready to admit it.”
He also knew that he was wearing down, his own thoughts no longer making sense and that soon he would be too exhausted to fight. But still, he struggled. Trying again to raise his hands to his mouth, his eyes, push the blindfold off. But always his hands were gently guided away.
“When I told Sam to bring me here instead of the hospital, I knew exactly what that decision meant.” Dean confessed, “You’ve told me, in intimate fucking detail, exactly what was waiting for me here if I came to you like this. And you know what? I actually do want this. All of it. I want to stay here; I want to be with you.”
“Sorry, Brother,” Benny apologises, “I can’t warm the spray up, but I’ll make sure the rest of it isn’t as cold.”
Cas seems to sense Dean’s discomfort though, because he leans over and gently cups his cheek, “None of that information is new or unexpected. I know it’s the first time we’ve spoken about it recently, but if you think back to when I originally went over your treatment plan, they were all already on it. Remember your rule: honest and forthcoming with information.”
Dean sighs and grits his teeth. It was all so logical, so
"Cas, you don't actually know me," Dean's shaking fingers catch the hem of his shirt and pull it up, showing Castiel the complex web of scars scattered across his torso and the scores of deep cuts, long ago heeled that still circle down, forming ragged patterns along his hips. Almost like a constellation chart, like his body kept a record of his shame." You don't know what I've done, who I really am. If you knew the truth, you'd never promise me that."
Castiel began the long and heartbreaking process of explaining just what would be needed and how intense it was soon to become....
Dean groans but pulls his hand back and places in his lap, "Fine. But can you please turn it off? It's too much already."
Castiel had always intended to use enemas as part of Dean’s therapy. He'd read an excellent study on the use of low volume, but extremely long duration therapeutic enemas to treat Drop-Resistance. In the study, the routine use of the therapeutic retention enemas significantly improved the submissives ability to achieve and maintain healthy headspaces. He was glad to see that the research was proving itself correct.
“No,” Dean practically begged, “I’m not ready,”
Cas ignored Sam’s question for the time being, comforting Dean instead, "I know…. I’m sorry…. That’s it... Down you go now dear one...good….”  Dean can feel himself falling even further, slipping down into that quiet, comforting space. The soothing encouragement works to ease the way, and it feels so nice, like slipping into a warm bath after a trek through freezing winter winds. He wants to luxuriate in it.
Dean grumbles and curses slightly under his breath, and Cas can just hear the mumbled words not the same thing. But he doesn't push the issue so Cas also lets it go.
Dean smiled, "Yeah, I'd like that," too tired for anything else. But this conversation was definitely not over.
Benny kept pressing, never giving Dean a moment’s reprieve, “You’re doing good, Brother,” he reassured.
Benny was fiddling with the enema hoses that he had clipped to the back of the chair in preparation. He double-checked the flow rates of the various different mixtures. They had decided on four different solutions, but were hopeful they wouldn't need all of them. He had a testing kit out and was making sure each had just the right amount of pH and temperature, as well as cleaning solutions or medication.
"What?" He feels cold, bitter with betrayal, "Why?"
Dean could still hear his disgust.
Dean desperately wanted Castiel to lean over and kiss him right then, his desire was obvious, but he knew that he wouldn’t. Because right from the start he’d been completely honest and sincere with Dean about his feelings about and desire for him. He’d always also been extremely careful to let Dean take the lead in all public aspects of their relationship.
“It’s okay,” Cas was there, soothing back his sweaty hair with one hand and gripping his other hand tight, “It’s going to be okay. I’m right here.”
Dean is very much starting to regret asking Castiel to tell him everything about his treatments, just that list alone is sounds horrendous. He doesn’t want to go on listing, knowing it’ll likely just add more treatments to Castiel’s list.
“Do you think you have any major injuries, broken bones or torn muscles?"
"I'm sorry, you didn't leave me any choice. I' had to," Sam sounded so regretful. So final. So resolved.
"Yeah,"
"Ok, that's good to know and we can take a good look at you when you're feeling better, in case you missed anything. Are you ready for the next question?"
Castiel kissed him then. Sweet, almost chastely, "We're finished and I couldn't be more proud of you. Well done. We'll just clean you up and then you can nap for a little while."
Dean shakes his head.
Castiel chuckles but doesn't outright comment.
"And...uh, my whole body aches. My arse feels like you washed it out with a garden hose"
But a hand, grasping firmly for his own, stops him before he can even take a single step. Dean has reached out and taken his hand, holding tightly, desperately for comfort and the strength to deal with what's to come. He's agreeing, Cas realises, he can't tell him, but he's holding him to his word anyway. Keeping him with them both. Cas had promised to fix him, to get him well enough to enjoy normal life again.
“But you still have your safe word,” Cas’s careful to remind him, “If you need a break or you need something to stop, you can still say it.”
Thankfully, Castiel answers on his behalf, “He wants them.”
Just as he was about to connect it to the tube, Dean caught on...
They'd moved him from the examination table to the recovery bed in the corner. Right now a curtain was pulled across the space, obscuring most of the rest of the room. But he could still see through the door and out the large window by his bed with views of the gardens and the pool, so he figured it wasn't too bad.  The bed was comfortable enough too.  Warm thick cotton sheets and a heavy comforter tucked around him, nothing like the scratchy hospital beds he was used to. Even the curtains were made from what looked like silk, it all seemed so odd to have this sort of luxury in a clinical room like this. But Dean wasn't complaining.
So instead, he pulled his fingers away completely. Much to Dean's displeasure.  He might feel the desire to be entered, but right now, even fingers would likely be too painful, maybe even damaging to him. No, Castiel told himself, be patient, make sure it's done right.
“Yes. He even tried to talk me out of it. But I told him that if he refused, I'd just find someone else," Castiel confesses. “so he called me a overprotective git and bloody idiot.”
“Sam, I … he’s going to want to take me right down. You’ve never seen that. It’s not easy.... It’s not pretty.” Dean can't meet Sam's eyes anymore, he seems nervous, shy even.
“Okay. That I can buy.” Dean narrows his eyes, but can't help feeling slightly amused, despite his irritation, “But why did he bring up those other diagnoses then?”
“All right,” Cas agrees, decision apparently made, “it’s good to hear that your headaches have been getting better. Hopefully, they’ll continue to improve as your health recovers, but if necessary, we can schedule you for an MRI. For now, lets continue to monitor and see how you go. How’s your throat?”
The promise of Gabriel dropping him…
“God!” Dean hissed, “That feels fucking weird!”
“I’m considering whether he would respond to a longer-term form of oral restraint. Maybe something he can click over his teeth to hold his tongue down, but can still eat and drink easily. So long as it wasn’t visible to others, he might like wearing it when he’s feeling anxious or stressed.” Cas ponders aloud to Sam as he walks them all out the door and down the corridor.
Dean shakes his head firmly, he hates the feeling of being drugged, much preferring to tough it out.
He shook his head, “No.”
Dean’s eyes raced back and forward between Cas and Sam, indecision and uncertainty.
Dean thought, but he shook his head, "Just help get me to bed."  He doesn't know why, but he really doesn’t want to give it up again.
He spun around, unable to get his bearing as he'd never been given the chance to see the room, but he moved anyway. Blindly sending himself forward, using what limited knowledge he had of the entry and the corridor beyond, to stagger onward.
“Everything sounds good, “relief light in Castiel’s tone, “How’s the catheter feeling?”
Chapter warnings: Accidental self-injury, discussions of fictional and real mental illnesses. Emotional distress.
! He silently cheered, gripping them tightly between his palms lest they clatter to the floor.
“Hush, Brother.” Benny places a hand on Dean’s shoulder “It’s just me,” and he can feel himself begin to relax again, having Benny around always makes him feel better. Well until he realises that now there will be three people watching this humiliation. He hangs his head, knowing this isn’t his decision to make, but that doesn’t make it any easier.
"Were you angry at Dr. Novak?"
Cas is quiet, staring at his scars. He reaches out, running his fingertips along one, a burn mark that runs along the bottom of Dean's ribcage. A rough, brutal looking thing. That was from a blowtorch, Dean recalls. Can still vividly recall the exact smell of burning flesh. Dean closes his eyes, feeling raw with shame.
"I can see that wearing it might be a bit off-putting initially...," Castiel thinks for a moment, carefully considering Dean's request, but when he does speak his voice sounds strained, heavy but resolved, "but the answer is still no. I'm not going to ignore the seriousness of this situation anymore. No more hiding from reality, it's too important and I know that you're strong enough to hear it."
! But he supposes, it will be nice not being stuck having to wheel around a feeding pump stand all the time.
"Wow," Sam commented under his breath, as he saw how far it had gone inside.
The inevitable, awful day had finally arrived, he grieved for the pain and incredible suffering he knew Dean had endured getting to this point. But Castiel mostly felt relieved, because he knew that at least now he could start to help. As his primary guardian, he now had the power to force Dean to comply with treatment to get the help he so desperately needed.
"Cas?" Dean asked, suddenly needing him, desperate for him to move closer.
Cas turns the feeding pump around so he can check the flow rate. It's been set extremely slowly, barely more than a drip feed. He frowns and fiddles with the tube and bag, checking that there wasn't an issue with either. But everything is correct. The problem was obviously with Dean's stomach.
Dean whined, but relaxed back a bit, clearly encouraged by the praise.
Castiel had made sure he had everything necessary to do the majority of Dean's care right here at home, he aimed to avoid bringing Dean to the hospital as much as possible, he knew that with his background, he found that place extremely traumatic. Dean would be spending many hours here, Castiel wanted him to be as comfortable as possible.
Also, because people have asked, yup, we'll be returning to serious Medical Kink next chapter 😉
At first, Dean can’t feel much of anything, just a slight warmth of the liquid as it begins to flow inside him. It’s calming, soothing, but he knows it won’t last long. Cas shushes him, running his fingers through his hair in just the way he knows Dean likes it.
"Come here," Dean demands, suddenly annoyed, "I’m sleeping you with you tonight, I've fucking earned it,” he says opening his arms.
Dean feels his own anger finally weakening.
That last stunt had earned him a set of medical mitts fastened kindly but securely over his hand. Cas had reminded him gently of his first rule, and that breaking rules had consequences as he pulled them over his hands and locked them at the wrists. The next time would be medical restraints Cas told him, not unkindly.
He had explained that what would be required of them wasn't going to be easy for anyone, especially Dean, but that he relied on them to assist with treatment compliance. Dean would need all their support if he was going to get through the difficult times ahead.
"Ok, not scared. Was it because you were angry?"
He could feel that his knees were weakening, trembling with the effort to keep him upright. But he persisted, well versed in pushing past physical weaknesses. Then the next tool, this one was lighter but already he felt more positive. It had a flat, flared base that he could feel through the fabric of his mittens. He raised it to his lips. Fingers shaking with fatigue.
He can hear a door opening and closing, then the texture of the floor changes from cement to what he thinks is carpet then to tiles. The wheelchair comes to a stop and Dean can hear the wheels being locked. He hears someone walk over towards them and stiffens at the sound.
“I’ll agree to your treatment plan, on one condition,”
“No worries,” Benny cheerily agrees.  Benny makes quick work of pulling the thigh pads up to rest under his legs and fastening the six-inch wide Velcro straps around each of his thighs. Then he places the waist strap across his middle and pulls it tight, “There you go, nice and snug. You want the other straps too, brother? It’ll help.”
Dean can feel wetness on his cheeks. He rubs his sleeve under eyes and shakes his head, his vision blurry.
Cas bit back a sigh,
“Oh,” Sam replied, still clearly unsure, “right….”
Cas expected that too. Dean had always needed to psych himself up for it. Never able to just relax into the feeling, the experience. He loved being down but struggled with the process, with the vulnerability required to let himself fall.
Benny’s hands were steady as he smoothly eased inch after inch of plastic from Dean’s body. He couldn’t see it, but he could feel it each time Benny grasped another section and then pulled, one maybe two inches out at a time.
Dean nods.
Dean just nods. Too tired to even think the words out, let alone utter them.
Dean couldn’t help it as his hips instinctively bucked up and tried to force Benny off him. He’d pushed something narrow, but long and rigid about halfway into the length of dean’s dick and was proceeding to push a thick gel inside him. Dean panted and squirmed as more of the awful liquid was forced out of the syringe and into his body. It wasn’t exactly painful, but it had him squirming and itching.
Castiel’s eyes widen in shock, hopeful and equally lustful.  But then his expression dropped immediately, replaced by a tender sort of sadness, “I want to give you that too but...” Cas hesitated
He closed his eyes, trying not to let his mind be drawn back to that pain...
"Yes," Cas nods, looking down at Dean’s finally peaceful face, "Every single time,"
The words might seem repetitious to Sam, but with how deep Dean was night now, it was important to continuously reassure him when guiding him down and helping him maintain his headspace. When he was in his deep headspace, Dean responded beautifully to even the mildest reassurances of love and affection. Underneath all the bluster and shame, Dean just desperately wanted to please, to be shown love.
Cas went back whispering soothing encouragement to Dean. Telling him how well he was doing and how proud he was of him.
Knowing that they’d be doing this again and again and again. Every time his body had stretched to accommodate to it, when each tube finally got comfortable enough to bare, Castiel would take that as a sign to increase the diameter again.  Dean felt like crying.
“Hush,” Benny soothes when Dean goes stiff, “You’ve done this many times before, nothing to be scared of,’
"No, I know that. All your staff are great." Dean tries to think logically about how to convince Cas, "It's me that's not used to it… it’s weird."
"Do you still have the papers?," Sam whispered, careful not to wake Dean, "I'm sorry. I know you didn't want it done like this."
“That’s it,” Cas encourages, “Relax those muscles and open up for me,”
"We're almost there, just one last push," Cas calmly informed him as he kept feeding in the plastic..
He let them rest like that a while. Giving Dean time to just relax, snuggled against him. Safe and warm.
He pulled himself back up, forced his tortured knees to carry his weight, to move.
Castiel gave into the urge to press his lips to the soft edge of Dean's mouth, not wanting to excite him, just expressing affection, "I love you," he whispers into Dean's ear, so quietly that Sam can't quite catch the words, "Thank you for trusting me,"
"Easy," Benny’s voice rumbled against Dean’s chest, "Dean, can you nod your head if you're following what I'm saying?"
I do need someone else in control. I'm too fucked up.
His father’s voice echoing from memory, like he was standing over him once again,
Dean was quiet, thinking it over for a very long time. He does not like this, but it was pointless arguing about it now. He'd try again later, "When's he arriving?"
It all just feel like too much. Too heavy. And he just felt too tired to even think.
Cas using his other hand, felt along the edge of his pelvic bones, fingers tracing the sharp jut of his hip and down to where his thighs were forced back up and wide open by the stirrups. Let his hand slip around Dean's thighs, gorgeous even though they were thinner than he was happy with, and pushed inwards, downwards. He gave one last push of his other fingers into Dean's welcoming mouth and slipped them free, much to Dean’s displeasure.
"It's all right, Dean. You're safe." A deep, slightly rough voice said, "Everything is going to be okay."
He actually wanted Castiel to take over. To tired of being in control, of being strong, he wanted to submit and just let Castiel deal with everything for a while. He just had to somehow quiet the scratching, vicious voice in the back of his mind. He had to learn how to stay.
"You're doing great," Benny encouraged, leaning down to read the length measurements printed onto the side of the tube. He nodded to Cas, looking pleased with the progress. Wisely, he didn't say it aloud, instead, he kept his fingers pushed tight to Dean’s rim, but stepped back a little so Sam and Cas could see for themselves.
Cas was amazed.
“You’ll have one every day, often more than one. But don’t worry, you’ll get used to it.”
He pulled his head away from those wonderful hands, refusing to accept the comfort.
It calmed and soothed Dean almost immediately. His heart falling back into regularity, his muscles unclenching. He’d kept a firm hold on the ball in his hand the entire time, Castiel had checked. And he was pleased to see Dean so beautifully responsive. Yes, it was a struggle, but he was doing so well.
"I told him, but I'm not sure he'll remember that tomorrow. He seemed a little out of it still," Cas knows that Dean will probably need to have key information explained several times before he's likely to remember it all. His exhaustion and malnutrition still affect his cognitive processes quite significantly. He's going to need a chance to catch up on sleep, adequate nutrition and a whole lot of other care needs before he'll be anywhere near to properly lucid.
It wasn't an ordinary chair, sort of like a combined birthing and dentist's chair. With each thigh supported separately to allow them to be held open in various different configurations, with stirrups for his feet and ankles. The lower back also had it's own supportive pad, with ended just above his tailbone, leaving ample room for access to both his anal and vaginal passages. The chair also featured a complex sort of headrest, as well as upper back and armrests. All fitted with thick Velcro straps which when fastened securely would easily hold him in place. There were even calf and footrests so the chair can be configured in such a way as to lay him completely flat or completely upright in a standing position, should the need arise.
Sam drove wildly, dangerously fast all the way, breaking every speed limit on the way, and yet somehow not getting pulled over. It was only two hours away, but it had felt like an eternity.
For the moment, Cas could see that Dean was focussed entirely on the fingers in his mouth, the fullness in his guts and the breathing exercises he'd been taught to deal with the pain. He'd not paid much attention to their conversation as the cramping had continued unabated.
He looked up into the glinting specks of dust swirling above their heads, not sure if he missed the blindfold or felt grateful for the view. Steeling himself for the truth, "Gabriel didn’t want to do the assessment?” Dean asks, his breath misting up slightly in the cold morning air.
"You're taking this so well. Only two more after this one,"  Cas informed him, hoping that the information might help him cope better with it. Cas hoped that letting Dean know there was an endpoint ahead might even help him stay down.
"Cas..." Dean panics, No, that's not what he meant! It's too much, more than he can give! He tried to think of a way to explain to Cas why it's unfair of him to ask that. To beg for an easier rule.
The few times Dean had been picked up by the police, once he'd been run through the system and identified, social workers always sent him there. He'd spent a couple of nights there each time, till John came and got him out.
Castiel was settling in beside him, pulling up his tablet to check some readout or other. Dean wanted to talk to him, to ask him what he had planned. But he was just too tired all of a sudden, the weight and the warmth finally allowing his body to calm, and before he even realised it, he was soundly asleep.
"I don't want him to teach me anything. No other doctors, I just want you."
“I’m aware of that. You’ve explained it before, remember?”
“Do you need help to go back down?" Cas made sure the warning was clear in his tone.
"Take your time. If you like, you can list them from least annoying to most." There's an amused lilt to his voice, like he is trying to guess which ones Dean will pick first.
“Yes. I agree to your whole plan, I’ll even give it all my best shot. But...”  Dean knew that admitting to the next bit was going to be the hardest part by far, he pushed through knowing he really did need to tell Castiel, “I can’t promise that I’ll be able to submit. I’ll probably still fight you, argue and make life hard for us both. And... um... Okay…” Dean struggles with the words, with what he’s about to give away, knowing he might be damning himself, “Sometimes…If we’re actually doing this right, I’m gonna need you to take my choices away...if I don’t have to make them for myself, everything else comes easier. Not all the time! But… you how having rules really helps me? Well, I kinda need more of that. I want more…”
"Tomorrow then?"
He stood up, swaying. Felt hands grasps his wrists, but the adrenaline and rage gave him the strength to push them away for a second time.
“Fuck you,” Dean snarled. But Cas was expecting that; Dean always fought against it initially, especially when he knew Cas was going to push him all the way down, it was really tough for him to just let go.
