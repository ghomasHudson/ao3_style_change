When John awakes again, his first thought is that, with relative surety, this is quite probably what gargling with cotton wool feels like, so parched is his mouth.
A part of him remarks that he really ought not to be disappointed by the lack of water or tea, because Sherlock coming to his rescue and tucking him tightly back into bed, of his own volition, no less, is a marvel in its own right. Disappointment implies that he’s harbored expectations to begin with. That calmer, more sensible part of him, however, is dwarfed by the bit that’s in pain, deeply inconvenienced, and incredibly thirsty.
Tumbling into the room isn’t exactly elegant either, nor is Sherlock slinging John back into bed, but it’s the moment that immediately follows which is truly awkward. John flopped safely into bed, Sherlock stands at the foot of it, seemingly unsure of what he’s meant to be doing next. After a few moments have passed, John feels compelled to address this fact.
“Yes, but not here, love, I’m shy,” Watson’s curse was loud enough for Sherlock to hear, making it the perfect set up to Jim's own response as he arches slightly against the form behind him.
But maybe John’s still just a little bit high, he considers as he’s flopped unceremoniously back into bed and tucked in, largely without skill, but thoroughly, betraying Sherlock’s hidden capacity for care. The tucking in isn’t strictly necessary, but it’s what John always does for Sherlock when the foolish man manages to get off his head on something or another, whether intentionally or not, and Sherlock’s evidently picked that up too. It’s not just Sherlock who’s changed John’s life on so many levels, both large and small; John’s managed to leave his own mark, and the thought of that is strangely satisfying.
John came to terms with his feelings for his flatmate a while ago. He’s also come to terms with the harsh reality of his situation: Sherlock doesn’t want him. He knows it’s not entirely personal, from what he can suss out Sherlock doesn’t really want anyone.  That first night, at Angelo’s, John had been honest: he wasn’t interested in Sherlock. As far as he could figure out, Sherlock was just another self-obsessed arrogant dickhead Alpha and John wasn’t looking for an Alpha to control him.  It didn’t take long for him to learn that the detective treated everyone like that, man, woman, alpha, beta, omega…it didn’t matter. John’s has no doubt that he’s gotten closer to the detective than most others, from Mycroft’s cryptic conversations it’s probably a good assumption that he’s the man’s only friend…and John is absolutely in love with him.
Alright so I've got a pretty good idea where this story will go and I'll be changing and adding tags as it progresses. I didn't want to add them all and ruin any surprises. I haven't decided if there'll be mpreg or not because I'm not sure if I'm ready to write that.
Then there’s Irene Adler, with strong shoulders, long legs and a sinful mouth, but she’d dismissed John the minute he walked in on her covering his detective with her naked body. It didn’t matter that she was an alpha, John saw her as competition and a small omega growl rumbled from his chest before he could control it. Luckily, John never had to explain the slip up to his flatmate but he’d noticed a definite increase in casual touches and lingering hands. He tried not to dwell on the physical contact, and put his energy into working out his sexual frustration. Maybe he’d be able to find someone to get his mind off the lovesick jealousy of watching Sherlock obsess over the mysterious woman with the camera phone.
It hurt to think about. John sniffled quietly and scrubbed at some dried snot and tears as he heard the approaching footsteps.
“I don’t want to talk about it. You don’t want to talk about it either, not really.” It’s strange to see this man of science in this state. Quite possibly it’s the first time Sherlock Holmes can remember being willing to just believe in something, instead of analyzing every factor, variable, and possible outcome.
Even more remarkable than the doctor’s professionalism is his ability to deal with Sherlock throughout the boring examinations. John can hear the detective sighing and tapping and squirming in the cheap chair in the corner and it’s driving him up the wall. This is exactly why he told Sherlock he should go to his appointment alone and now he has to babysit a bored detective.
“Leave  it, Sherlock. I’m fine, just, listen to me for once. ”And of course the great bastard doesn’t even understand why he’s angry and he can feel is blood pressure rise. Hearing a derisive snort John turns and stalks into the lounge, if he wasn’t still dressed in the clothes he slept in he’d storm out of the flat. Staring around the room he suddenly feels stir crazy so he heads to his room to change. Fresh, Sherlock-free air would do him some good.
John tries taking a step back, because this is far too intimate an act for flatmates, leaning back, trying to dislodge the detectives face from his neck. But as soon as he feels him pull away Sherlock’s tightening his grip on the omega’s hips and pulling him flush against his body. He’s growling in John’s ear, a low rumbling sound that John can feel in his bones. A warning. It’s not going to be so easy to extricate himself from the territorial Alpha, but he’s a soldier and he can use force if he needs to. He’s really hoping he doesn’t though, mostly because he’s not one hundred percent sure he can take the feral detective in his shaken state. But by God he’d try.
“Erm, thanks John. I’ll try to see what we can do with that. From the look of it, that’s the first confirmed connection we’ve got between Moriarty and the hits.” Lestrade is trying to focus on the case, not the omega in heat sitting in the backseat or the instinctual response curling deep in his stomach.
Sherlock expected his meddling older brother to be smirking at him, maybe even demand a favor in return. The older Holmes did not look smug though, he looked…angry, disappointed even. Sherlock stood still in the middle of the den while Mycroft rose and strode over to him. He towered over the detective and wasted no time with quips or insults, “The next time I pick up the good doctor it will not be to drop him off at your residence. Good evening, brother.”
They say when you lose one of your senses, your other senses improve. John can’t confirm this because everything is constantly a grey wash of white noise and numbness. A sea of disorientation and limbo.  It feels like being underwater for too long, surreal and torturous, vision clouded with bubbles until everything is a swirling mess and the weight of his clothes and thoughts pull him down. He’s submerged but he’s not drowning, not quite.
He’s not in control of his body anymore. His mouth is rambling, his legs are moving, his head is spinning. He can’t stop himself, he can’t stop anything. “
“Obviously not since you’re clearly upset,” Adjusting the dials of the microscope, Sherlock mumbles barely glancing at the small doctor.
The brush of a cold, slick digit against the delicate skin of his entrance sends a thrill up his spine. Greg deepens their kiss until John’s entire world is the taste of tobacco and coffee before pushing the long finger in. He massages John’s inner walls slowly, running over everywhere but the swollen gland that drives John crazy. John gasps in deep lung-fulls of air when Greg breaks off to taste the salt on John’s neck and along his collarbone, leaving a small trail of light discolorations when he sucks a bit too hard on the flushed flesh. He runs the flat of his tongue over a pert nipple as he pushes in another finger into John’s tight passage and John arches off the bed at the stimulation.
He shakes his head, like he can shake the thoughts right out of it. When he hears the sharp snap of the bedroom door closing, he rinses off, his skin still smelling like the greying Detective Inspector. Wrapping himself in a towel and heading into the bedroom, he sees Greg undressing, unbuttoning the last of his shirt. John saunters over and pulls on the tie hanging around the neck, bringing those lips into a sweet kiss. Greg moans into the kiss and unfolds the towel the reveal the short body in front of him.
John’s mind is whirring trying to figure out how to get the alpha to back off but when Sherlock tightens his hands around John’s arm the doctor lets out a yelp, pain making him lose his train of thought.
“I’ll go start the water then.” And Greg enjoys the view as John struts into the loo, naked and flushed.
John can feel the tender spots dotting his neck and shoulders, blooding pooling beneath the skin; he’ll be covered in bluish-purple splotches tomorrow. He’s panting slightly from arousal as he reaches his arm back and tangles his fingers in soft curls. It’s an awkward angle but he’s able to reach Sherlock and he lets him know what exactly he’s thinking with a clumsy clash of lips and teeth.
His belly is covered in drying and flaking semen and he’d fallen asleep in a disgusting wet spot full of his own excretions. There are a couple of spots of blood stained into his sheets here and there, from wounds that went uncared from the evening before mixing with dried sweat and tears.  When he looks up, dazed, he doesn’t miss the laser-focused look on Sherlock’s face. Following his gaze, he realizes the detective is staring rather unabashedly at the soft flesh of John’s stomach trailing down to land on his flaccid penis lying against his bruised thigh. John’s face flushes a deep red as he pulls up a sheet to cover his naked body. He’s never been shy about his body before, that kind of modesty is quickly stripped on the field and in the army, but having that analytic stare focused on his small (although fairly standard to bigger than average for an omega) prick and his soft torso makes him suddenly self-conscious. He’s lost his toned physique after being shot. The infection and recovery stripped him of the muscles he’d worked hard for, and being hindered by a psychosomatic limp made keeping fit an ordeal, even now his erratic sleep patterns and too-much takeaway made up for the all the running around London the duo did. He was by no way pudgy or overweight, but he was no longer as young and fit as he was once. It shouldn’t matter to him, but he felt like he didn’t need to give the detective another reason to not want him.
He gives him a chaste, but heartfelt, kiss before turning towards the bedroom. He can hear Greg hit the kettle on to boil and the even clicking of computer keys as he strips in their shared room. He must be free from the office for the day because he’s making tea and not a monster pot coffee. John feels warm and a smile pulls on his face as he peels his socks off because it’s so rare for the two of them to have a day off together. Really it’s just rare for Greg to have a day off at all and he so badly needs it. Throwing his vest and shirt in the general direction of the dirty clothes basket, he allows himself to anticipate the promised quality time he’ll get to spend with his very foxy boyfriend.
The spoon stirring John’s tea comes to an abrupt halt at the declaration. He’d resigned himself to completely ignoring what had transpired. To bring it up is so un-Sherlockian that he’s both eager to hear what the detective has to say and dreading being flayed open and analyzed under Sherlock’s unyielding eyes. John risks a glance at the detective who is seated at their strangely clean (well maybe not what you’d call
Since when is this the situation? Since when does Sherlock preach to John about things like hope and strength and fighting? He has no right to accuse John of giving up. He wrenches his face from the man’s hand and turns his head toward the window and away from the sound of his voice. The silence aches.
He loves Sherlock, so much, and so carelessly that he would let the man break his heart in a moment. It’s a blind trust that surprises him because he’s never been open with anyone, never even felt the desire to be, but he’d let Sherlock cut him apart over and over and over again if that’s what he wanted. It’s a very real possibility if he chose to have an affair with Sherlock Holmes. He’s already betrayed his trust and shattered his world in the most public way possible and still here he is scrubbing the man’s dried semen off his thighs.
What happened with Sherlock was just – well, it does not need to happen again. If it doesn’t become a pattern of behavior and no one finds out, then everything could be okay.
Denial is spilling from his lips because John has never been so wrong and how could he even think that but John’s looking at him with pleading eyes, “Please, can I have some privacy?”
He takes his tea with him to the opposite end of the table from Sherlock whose lithe fingers are still wrapped around a pen, poised to take notes on whatever new thing he was studying beneath the lens of his microscope. He’s staring at his tea, foolishly hoping Sherlock will just drop the subject. It’s already past 9 in the morning but it’s still much too early to talk about this with his flatemate who is…what? Asexual? Homosexual? Just, sexually repressed? He doesn’t even want to begin to try and put a label on Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock’s piercing gaze tells John that he’s definitely not going for John’s brush-off and he’s sits, waiting for the man to break the silence.
The Woman’s presence had thrown a new problem into their relationship. It was making John wonder about Sherlock’s past, and how little he knew. Mycroft’s taunting “
He’s snarling at the strong reek of strange alphas on his omega. He’ll definitely have to burn this outfit later. What he sees when he final gets down to John’s vest makes the snarl die in his throat.  Those tanned arms are mottled with a disgusting collection of violet and yellow marks. His faculties have returned enough for him to easily identify the marks. They’re handprints. Finger marks from wear Moriarty’s men grabbed John. The severity of the bruising shows that John tried to fight back and get away (and a small spark of pride flares in his chest at how brave his blogger can be) and he remembers why they’re both here.
Too curious to hold off, Sherlock was flying down the stairs to greet him, alarming John who had been biding time to consider his words.
“Deduce it.” John punctuates it with a very deliberate press of his arse against Sherlock’s cloth-covered groin. He’s feeling…
When he kicks off his trousers and walks into the ensuite bathroom he’s hit with a heavy dose of shame because his shorts are sticking to his body in the most disgusting of ways. There’s the evidence of his infidelity right there on his skin. Sherlock is rubbed into his pores and the self-loathing might just swallow him whole. John throws the pants towards the garbage before clambering into the shower. He turns the taps on to a punishing temperature. He scrubs every square inch of his body, from the soles of the feet that walked him into Sherlock’s bedroom to behind his ears where he can still feel the detective’s lips licking, sucking, whispering…
brushing it off as residual hormones.  Sherlock has his own study in self-control as he tries to ignore the soft body barely concealed by the thin cloth of his dressing gown.
For the first time in a long time, I got really stupid drunk, read through some old fics, then wrote this chapter about two days ago. I just finished making it, uhm, legible? It is also very rushed but I didn't want to try and revise it because I wanted it out as soon as possible. Eventually, I will probably go back to edit it.
Wait. Pimps. The same person calling the hits is the person policing the group of pimps and slave dealers. The underground group selling off Omega’s to the hightest bidder. The realization grips Sherlock hard and he feels sick.
” at the palace twisted in the back of his mind. Sherlock obsessively researches the most contrite topics, yet neglects the absolute basic aspects of human nature. So what category does sex fall under?

He comes back to their sitting room, brushes a light kiss on John’s temple (something that makes John grumble contently), then settles on the sofa in his favorite thinking pose. He watches John as the man fiddles with the program, his usual bland expression back in place. Sherlock wonders how he can get that smile back on the blonds face: the smile only Mycroft and Lestrade and Molly can get to appear, but not him.
Sherlock had spent the afternoon at the morgue. Sometimes he needed to get away from John, from their flat. from all that responsibility…it was suffocating him. The hours he spent crouched over the microscope cleared his mind of all the useless thoughts that polluted his brain.
John lets out an embarrassing whimper at the pressure on his wrists. Eyes widening, “Of course…” the towering alpha pushes his nose into John’s collarbone leaving a trail of warm breath as he moves along John’s throat. A dark chuckle coming from the man’s throat makes John nervous.  “You’re an omega. You’re just convenient fuck for him, aren’t you? Shame he hasn’t bonded with you yet.”
John wasn’t that familiar with this area. He didn’t know where to go, “Sherlock!” Breathing hurt and his ribcage felt too small.
When Sherlock arrived at Baker Street, Mycroft was sitting imperiously in his armchair, fingers steepled under his chin as he stared intently at the door of Sherlock’s bedroom.
Sherlock swallowed audibly, tearing his eyes from the  soft, enticing, body in front of him, and gave an embarrassed cough before speaking, “I know you’d prefer not to wake up covered in…well, you know, everything and it would be much too difficult to attempt to maneuver you, unconscious, down the stairs and into the shower. I brought a bottle of water for you too, in case you did wake up. I can leave this here and you can finish up the, erhm, sponge bath yourself, although you’ll be quite sore from your, ah, activities of last night and you’ll need help to bandage up some of the wounds. I can leave and come back when you need my help? Or I could not come back at all, although I imagine you’re quite hungry so I can send Mrs. Hudson up later…” What no shut up, shut up,
He knows he’s in danger and pretty much incapacitated but John valiantly tries to shuffle and crawl away, holding back a yell when he falls on his side and jostles his tender ribs.
John can feel the fever both dulling and increasing. He can’t explain it. Suddenly he’s not in pain, desperate with want, but drowning in a burn that’s becoming increasingly more and more pleasurable with every rock of their bodies together. Sherlock’s picking up speed and high moans are escaping John on each thrust in, he’ll be embarrassed afterwards about the sounds coming from him but for now he’s going to ride the waves of hormones, pheromones, and carnal instinct.
Like I said at the beginning this is my first omegaverse so I'm getting the hang of it and I might alter the "rules" a bit to fit this story. Any big deviations from mainstream omegaverse will come with explanations. There will be nasty sticky medically-questionable smut at some point. After all, what's omegaverse without crazy fucking sex?
“I’m…” Sherlock kisses along his shoulder “…a genius...” He nips at the skin along the doctor’s throat, “…not…” deft fingers rub at a dusky nipple and he plants a kiss behind John’s ear, “a mind reader.”
much but his mind is still trying to catch up. He still feels like he kind of wants to punch the man, but he’s pretty sure it’s the normal amount. Then suddenly the kiss is over and Sherlock’s rambling about brilliant and fantastic and conductors of lights and acronyms.
Sherlock’s long fingers frame John’s face, tilting his head up, “John, you won’t lose me again”. He punctuates the statement by taking John’s mouth in a kiss, as soft as a kiss can be. It’s slow, filled with regret, longing, and power. John locks his arm behind Sherlock’s head, trying to deepen it, because every time he tells himself he’s okay, and he’s dealt with everything that’s happened the last few years, it flies out of his head the second he sees Sherlock. He hurts,
It was warm under the duvet from John and his body heat. John’s still asleep but the detective has been awake all night. Now he lies here, pretending to sleep; he won’t let John wake up alone.
John’s pushing himself off the thin man muttering apologies and Sherlock’s body feels too cold without him. The minute his feet reach the ground John practically throws himself back and away and begins furious pacing, fist pushed against his lips.
Today, walking down the street was more relaxing than a cab ride, especially since Sherlock could appreciate how nice it is to walk without having to guide someone with almost every step. He needed the breathing room the brisk city would give him.
Sherlock’s tuning out the sound of their chatter and radios. Why? Why take John and not him? Why take either of them at all? He’s running through the facts he’s accumulated about the suspects so far.
He yanks the blond’s body against his own, crushing him against his chest. Their lips are smashed together and he cuts himself on John’s teeth. He manipulates the angle until it’s a proper kiss and their mouths are sealed together again, tongues colliding and teeth biting. As John sucks roughly on the detective’s plush lower lip, Sherlock takes the opportunity to slip cold hands underneath the knitted material of John’s jumper. The blogger shivers as he feels the electricity of expert fingers on his skin.
Sherlock knew this wasn’t right. John should be furious. He should be yelling and hitting him for his stupidity. He expected at least cursing and name calling. He wasn’t sure what to do with this.
He’s still trembling beneath the detective’s fingers. Sherlock ducks his head down, running his nose along John’s hairline and neck.
He’s gripping the sink, breathing through the irritation. He can’t see himself in the useless piece of glass in front of him, cold under his fingers.
“Because you’re obviously very bored and can’t be bothered to sit through all this. We still have another hour or two left before I’m done. Go for a walk. Go get lunch. Go solve a murder. Just
They’re frozen for few moments, Sherlock panting slightly, and John simmering with self-loathing. Slowly, he begins to move around the lounge picking up his discarded clothing and not meeting Sherlock’s eyes.
“No, Sherlock, you don’t.” He’s exhausted and he wonders how often Sherlock’s actually been exposed to omegas,  “You’re smelling pain markers and residual heat pheromones. It’s my body; it’s just tricking you into thinking those things.” Painful, god, it hurts to say it out loud, “It’s not real.”
“He’s one of the pigs from the Met. Scotty and I dropped him and his partner. Left his alpha friend at the park.” The guy’s nose looks like it’s been broken enough times before and it suits his nasally voice, “Pretty little omega like this playing cops and robbers? He was asking for it.” He runs a cold hand along John’s jaw and John clenches his teeth to avoid biting at it. He has to wait for the right opportunity if he wants to successfully do this.
He will figure out how to fix him and John. He will figure out how to get the old John back. John will be happy again.
He’s a complete utter fool because this entire time he hasn’t been able to see past John’s condition. He’s missed the how he’s been hurting him by treating him this way. He saw but did not observe.
It feels like hours that he’s propped against a box, trussed up and waiting for help after his kidnapper left, but he’s starting to regain clarity as his hormones even out. The door flying open with a bang makes him jump but his movements are too restricted by the rope rightly wound around his wrist and feet.
When there’s nothing but silence from the blond, he stalks forward and drops to a crouch in front of the man. He frames John’s face in his hands, tilting his head up, and he searches the doctor’s face. “No. You don’t want to get your hopes up. You don’t think it’s going to work. You’ve given up before they’ve even tried!”
“Go ahead to the safe house and send out word that the Met is onto us. Don’t let them know we’re looking for the rat. Keep it short.” There’s grumbling and a clatter and John’s trying to focus on the words but his head’s becoming increasingly fuzzy as the pain takes over. “You two: go get the truck ready. And make sure you haven’t been followed or bugged before coming back here or my boss will turn your skin into shoes.” His ribs ache so horribly he hopes he’s not broken anything. He hears feet shuffling as the men move around and leave. Are they going to leave him here? “I’ll take care of this one.”
It’s hopelessly masochistic to fall in love a self-proclaimed sociopath married to his work, but what else can he do? He may not be a genius like Sherlock but John was almost certain he’d hidden his feelings for the detective flawlessly. He has nothing to offer the man, after all. It’s a fact made more apparent to him during Moriarty’s little “game”. He’s not mentally stimulating and he’s far from interesting but he’s so infatuated with the damn genius that he’ll give and give and ask for nothing in return.
The confusion in his voice quells john’s fears and he just nods in what he’s sure is a slightly manic manner before pulling Greg by his shoulders so he’s on top. His weight is reassuring. Greg props himself on one elbow to keep from crushing his partner before leaning in for a filthy kiss that’s really just tongues and teeth clashing violently. He breaks off when John trails a hand down to squeeze Greg’s erection and the groan that rips from his throat is obscene.
Even after the knot has gone down, they stay in bed. Sherlock listening to John’s even breathing pattern as he sleeps. He was selfish for enjoying this, for bonding to John, for tying the kindhearted soldier to him this way. He doesn’t dare sleep and miss a moment of their time together.
It’s awkwardly silent again and stays like that until they reach their flat. Lestrade is helping John out of the car and as he helps the unstable man out from the back seat, John grabs desperately to the sleeve of Lestrade’s coat.
There isn’t a white-hot passion gripping them, they’re both aroused but it’s secondary to the moment they’re having. They’ve laid bare their bodies to each other because it’s easier than laying bare their hearts. Eventually, John slides his body down Sherlock, taking the searing heat of his erection into his mouth. His tongue leaves languid trails of saliva down the warmth, kissing and nipping at his inner thighs, leaving sucking kisses at the head of his penis. It’s slow, it’s decadent, and John is trying to memorize every second because this is the last time this can happen. When Sherlock wrap his warm violinist hands around John, it’s overwhelmingly satisfying.
“Sherlock what in the hell happened? Have we not talked about this? This is a homicide investigation: do not go running off without bloody fucking back up.” Lestrade fumes at him and Sherlock just winces at the volume, brushing the D.I. off with a dismissive wave.
John smiles like a teenager, sick in love as he pushes the rest of Greg’s clothing off. The warm olive skin underneath his hands are all too real suddenly.
Retinal tears are basic and easy to fix, even if they result in a retinal detachment but John was mostly out of it for four days and it was a while longer until he was coherent enough to comment on his decreasing vision.
“Somethings going to happen tomorrow, isn’t it?” Sherlock stills but doesn’t look John in the face.  A kiss is planted on the soft skin of John’s throat, so soft he can barely believe it’s from the same man who was marking him enthusiastically two minutes ago. It’s delicate, the way leaves fall to the ground when the seasons change and the trees are bare. Things are going to change, and Sherlock knows but won’t divulge his secrets. That gentle kiss is a promise and plea: Trust me, please. You can trust me.
To avoid any further harm to John Watson, he slept in short intervals or kipped on the sofa. Last night, he’d snuck into the kitchen to tinker with an experiment involving bees and anthrax spores after John had fallen into a deep slumber but had crawled back into the bed as morning neared.
Yo it's been like 6 months since I've updated you have permission to throw things at me next time I take that long to update. I feel bad for the hiatus so have a bit of smut (consequently the rating got bumped up). I might go back and edit later but I really just wanted to get this out to you guys.
“I know I don’t know a lot about friends but actually I don’t think he’s just a friend.” Sherlock’s taking long strides towards him, “I don’t think this is how a friend feels for another friend. This is more. Definitely more,” Johns frozen in the suddenly intense stare of the detective who is so close, “I love you, John.”
, it’s normal. Natural. Just hormones and biology. Nothing more.” It’s physical. It’s the only thing it could be.
As much as John loathes doing it, he needs to stop this now because the worse that can come of this is a couple of days of awkward coexistence that neither one of them will bring it up.
Sherlock’s nature telling him to push away the other Alpha and find somewhere private for him to care for and bond his omega but he’s fighting to stay in control.
, he struggles to remind himself) and Sherlock doesn’t want to shatter the fragile thing connecting them. Sherlock pulls John to him, spooning the smaller man, away from the cooling mess they’ve left on the duvet and as the doctor begins to drift sated and sticky and conflicted Sherlock can’t stop himself from leaving a dark, filthy bruise on the man’s shoulder. John grunts a bit but hardly stirs. Anyone who sees it will know it for what it is, a clear mark of possession and sex and maybe it’s childish and spiteful but the next time John looks in the mirror, the next time he lets Gregory Lestrade undress him, he wants him to see that mark and remember that he’ll never feel the same with anyone else that he does with Sherlock Holmes.
“I was just dropping in. I had a gift for the good doctor, I thought I’d show him how to break it in.” Ever cool and collected, Mycroft stepped away from John’s chair and towards his brolly, propped against John’s armchair. He twirled it between the palms of his hands, “It’s been awhile since he’s updated his blog. His fans await another harrowing tale of justice and deduction.”
So Sherlock drives himself back in, his knot popping through the tight rings of muscles. His orgasm is almost immediate, enough to make his vision spot. It crashes over the alpha as he lets out a growl, moving his hips in small movements. Instinctually, almost without even realizing it, Sherlock locks himself to the tender spot of John’s flesh, right above where neck meets shoulder and tears into the skin.
than anything else Sherlock has taken from him, he could lose the man he loved. So, Greg struggled to drift off, head racing with everything he might have overlooked and, conversely, making up a million scenarios in which he confronted John, was wrong, and would irrevocably fracture their relationship. It was high risk, with no reward. As John slept beside him, chest rising and falling, Greg stopped himself from waking him and looking for answers. Sherlock blows into all of their lives, turns everything on it’s head, and leaves a mess in his wake. Every scene is chaos in the wake of his theatrics.
“No. You’ve been honest. That’s all you’ve ever been when it comes to…” He gestures wildly at himself before gesturing towards Sherlock, “this. I get it. Perfect. It’s fine.” John’s face is red from humiliation and anger.
“Too quickly. I don’t think it’s a full heat. Usually I can feel symptoms for a week before the worst hits.” Maybe we’ll be able to remember some of it?” Sherlock feels his lungs tighten because the future is so looming and horrible and uncertain, “It’s probably just from all the stress and irregularity with my birth control and –”
Sated, the men lay there for a time, chest to chest, breaths evening out as their mixed ejaculate grows cold and tacky between them. John reaches over Sherlock’s shoulder, half climbing over him to grab a towel off the bedside table. He begins wiping of Sherlock’s chest and stomach before cleaning off his own abdomen, giving a perfunctory, but gentle, wipe around each of their sensitive groins. They really need a shower to clean off the stink of sex but he’s too spent to do that much moving.
“If my associates had been smarter, they would’ve put a bullet in the detective’s brain before snatching you up.” John’s still a touch confused but he knows he needs to get away and he squirms in the man’s grip. The blond shakes him a bit and tightens his grip on John’s wrists painfully. “Now, none of that sweetheart. Holmes will be here soon so I’ll need to split before then.” He brings his face close to John’s and the omega can smell the tobacco on his breath. “He cares for you, you know. Honestly cares, possibly even loves if he can even feel that kinda stuff. Jim loves it, thinks it’s the funniest thing in the world. Question is: what does he see in you?”
Previous warnings apply: Tags may continue to change, there will probably be mpreg, and a lot of anxiety and panic.
He doesn’t know how long he sat there with his eyes clenched shut, taking measured breaths before warm arms came around his shoulders.
John’s instructed to lean his head back as the doctor drops a cold aching liquid onto both eyes. Hart continues, “I’ve seen people sit their bored out of their minds and I’ve seen people sit there chewing at their fingers and nearly in tears. Your friend there was certainly nervous.”
“Tell me, if I was stuck like this, if this surgery fails, would it matter? Would it change how you feel about me?”
Decision made, he pulls himself off the sofa and to his full height. Stalking toward the fidgeting doctor, he rumbles a low, “John”, stopping the man’s nervous movements.
One of Sherlock’s favorite things is helping John shave. John makes it known one every occasion that he can, in fact, do this himself, and the detective believes him. The ex-Army surgeon has steady, cautious hands.
“We need to get him to a hospital.” Lestrade is watching the interaction and even though John seems pretty out of it, the blood dripping down his chin and the bruises blooming on the blonds face are concerning. He takes a tentative step forward –
Time is frozen, time is racing forward. There are so many people around him and then they’re gone. He’s moving, but he’s sitting still. He knows he’s not walking because his legs wouldn’t be able to hold him now. There’s a buzzing, a new one, coming in around him, getting louder. John is suffocating, but his lungs feel like they’ve burst open.
So many what-ifs. It’s not his fault, Sherlock and he have flogged that dead horse to no end, but it’s his body and he wants to take some form of control over it. The responsibility can’t completely sit with some punk-for-hire off the streets.
Silently, John stares up at the advancing detective; his stormy eyes are heated and the pupils are blown wide, John lets out a stuttering breath. His heart’s beating so fast he thinks it’s going to give out when Sherlock places his large hands on John’s hips, stilling him. They’re faces are so close they’re sharing the same humid air.
The unfamiliar voices put John on edge but he stays silent, trying to get his bearings. They’ve secured his hands in front of him. Clearly they underestimate him, expecting a docile omega.
“I want to go home.” Sherlock looked unsure about the suggestion at first, but John’s pitiful mumbling into his chest changes his mind instantly. He nods at the detective inspector and follows him out to his cruiser, Lestrade helping Sherlock mostly drag the omega out of the abandoned building.
“You knew me as I was two years ago.” Because John did want this now, he wanted his friends at the clinic, coming home, and having dinner, and falling into bed with the man he loves and then waking up the next day and do it all over again.
“Eventually, dear brother, you will figure it out. John is neither a riddle nor a wounded animal. Stop treating him like an invalid.” He stepped around the younger man and headed for the stairs. Before descending he stopped and turned back to face the detective. “I told you this would not be easy, but it doesn’t need to be difficult.” Letting out a longsuffering sigh, he strolls down the stairs and into his waiting car.
He hears it: the retched moan that haunted the flat day in and day out before they’d seen a corpse in the likeness of Irene Adler stretched out beneath Molly’s careful hands. Sherlock’s been here this whole time. He’s heard everything and
Sherlock watches John’s small, careful hands as he runs the terry cloth over their bodies. His hands are cautious and hesitant, trying to be as efficient as possible to make sure he gets every spot. He’s missed an area around his own hip but the concentration the man has put towards this one task tells the detective that this fulfills more than just his need to nurture.
It breaks Sherlock from his daydream; John isn’t his to have Later’s and Some Day’s with. ..just tonight, just right now, and he better not waste it. Nodding, he grabs at John’s hand and takes off towards his bedroom, John hobbling quickly behind him, trousers still trapped around his thighs.
“You're doing The Look again.” Sherlock needs John to stay right here with him. He needs to know John still wants to be with him, despite what he’s done to him. He’s taken away so much.
John lost Sherlock when he lost his sight. He can deal with being visually impaired. It’s hard, but he’s a soldier. He’s dealt with worse.
He was lightly grasping Sherlock’s hand, their contact almost hidden by his long coat. John hadn’t brought the white cane with him because he liked it when Sherlock subtly led him around the city. His Seeing Eye Detective. It was nice to be somewhere new.
Shutting the door behind him quietly, he makes his way to the den and assumes his thinking pose on the length of the sofa. Could this be all it is? Biology and instinct?
He fishes for his phone in the pocket of his denims, feeling ridiculous, hiding in the bathroom to make a phone call. The little voice in the mobile reading out his contacts to him until he reaches Greg, hoping the Detective Inspector is free for drinks tonight.
“Sherlock” The pacing detective is only making John more nervous.  They’re not bonded, not by a long shot, but their pheromones are definitely taking a toll on each other.
It’s barely seven now, and it’s a Sunday so John should have plenty of time to speak to Sherlock and be back. He’ll make it clear that it shouldn’t happen again, because John is honestly happy with Greg, and it’s too late for him and Sherlock to do this. He tucks his wallet in his back pocket and is out the door, knee bouncing and chewing his lip the entire trip to Baker Street.
“Sherlock, I appreciate what you’re trying to do here but going on about tobacco ash is not calming. This is the fifth ash-related tale you’ve told me and I’m far from relaxed.” John drummed his fingers impatiently on the arm of the uncomfortable chair. He’s starting to believe they make the seating this stiff and cramped on purpose. The staff wants maximum tension before they start jamming needles and sharp things into his eyes.
He pulls the greying man onto the bed, falling until they’re lying side by side, the fronts of their bodies touching softly  as Greg frames John’s face with his hands kissing him. John lets Greg lead the kiss, not wanting to take more than he deserves. He’ll take whatever the older man is willing to give and he’ll be grateful for it.  Slowly, the kiss is deepened and Greg tilts their heads to lick his way into the warmth of John’s mouth.  It’s maddeningly tender and it’s ripping John’s heart to shreds, he’s suddenly touch starved and he’s leaving crescent moon shaped indents in Greg’s skin with his desperate grip. When the yarder runs a rough hand so fondly through the still damp locks of dishwater blond hair John whimpers into his mouth.
He makes sure there are enough marks and bites covering his doctor so that Mycroft or Molly or Lestrade or anyone else who sees John will know that he can take of his blogger. He wants everyone to know that even though they all get to see him smiling and carefree, even if it’s just for a moment, only he gets to him like this. Debauched, out of control, and lost in pleasure.
Then Sherlock spotted the suspect: the suspect that wasn’t supposed to be here; the one that was supposed to be hiding in one of his friends’ basements. The detective took off running in pursuit of the man. He sprinted forward so suddenly and so quickly he almost sent John falling face first.
the opportunity from life). So, Sherlock takes his time, running his tongue over every curve of John’s mouth, tongues exploring, hands pushing off coats and robes and vests and pants. It doesn’t take long before they’re sprawled across the sofa, limbs entangled and breath mingling.
There it was: John switching from melancholy to anger. Despite Sherlock’s mercurial nature, he loathes these mood shifts in the smaller man. He doesn’t want to put up with it today, he wanted today to be a good day. He’d just solved a crime, a 6 or a 7 at least due to the cleverness of the not-so-dead wife. Can’t he just enjoy the post case contentment?
John can practically see the great mind whirring with the new information but Sherlock doesn’t respond.
“I don’t know what kind of kinky things you and your alpha are into but I’m not interested.” Jeanette is storming off the sofa and John chases after her.
Sherlock growls as he comes to in the dirt of a small bank off the Thames. He jolts up dislodging the offending hand on his should that’s shaking him awake. He’s about to snap when he sees Lestrade’s face.
John’s hoping he’s hallucinating because the very last person  he wants to see is casting a silhouette on the concrete in front of him. It’s not Mycroft, like he originally thought, and right now he’d take the elder Holmes over the spectre in front of him and the only thought echoing in his head is:
Sherlock set’s his pen on the tabletop and crosses clasps his hands in front of his face, “I am so very sorry, John. I never meant…” The sincerity in the detectives voice makes John look at him. He needs to endure the words about to come from the brunet’s mouth. “I never meant for that to happen. Rest assured it will never happen again,” because Sherlock will be damned if he’s ever responsible for that pained look on John’s face ever again. When there’s no response from John, he continues, “I didn’t want you to get the wrong idea.”
WARNING: There is a small part with unwanted advances, non-consensual touching, and some references to forced bonding. Nothing explicit but it's important to warn you.
But they’re still not talking, not quite like they used to. Sherlock is in the flat more than he usually is. In fact, John can’t think of a time when Sherlock left without him. Even when the moody detective leaves for the morgue or for some other science related jaunt, he comes up with an excuse for why he needs John with him. He isn’t stupid; the man is a doctor for god’s sake. It’s obvious to the two of them that Sherlock is keen on keeping the smaller man within ear shot. That still doesn’t mean they are on good terms, though.
time because for a terrifying moment he was not in control of his body. His mind was there but was not calling the shots. All night he stayed up trying to organize the new information he’d collected on James Moriarty, now that he finally met the man in person but his thoughts were frequently straying back to John: his intoxicating scent, his sandy blond hair, the warmth of his skin, the soft malleability of his body against Sherlock’s and the way he melted beneath his hands.
Richie, the one with the mustache, grunts and manhandles John onto his front. After securing John’s feet tightly, painfully, together, he gestures at Scotty to help him with John’s hands. The minute they cut the cord around his wrists, John tries to lash out but a strong painful grip to the back of his neck disorients him. A flush of instinctual submission seizes his body and the choking hold makes him lightheaded. With his body trussed up like this, John’s got little mobility.
Because there is no going back from this, not really. This will undeniably change everything, could ruin everything more than they’ve ruined it already.
He wasn’t there when John was attacked and beaten so badly that when the detective finally got to him he was slightly delusional from pain and, what would turn out to be, a moderate concussion. Lestrade was called, an ambulance arrived, and Sherlock followed closely behind in Lestrade’s cruiser while he explained the details of their criminal’s operation that would lead to his arrest.
Sirens break through the fog of hormones and fear and John jumps a bit and in the split second his mind wanders from the danger with his skin between its teeth, his attacker strikes and bites painfully into the juncture where neck meets shoulder. The pain is near blinding for a second before numbness wiggles its way through his veins and into his limbs. On the positive side of things, at least the throbbing of John’s head and the ache of his body is fading fast.
John was silent as Sherlock finished wrapping his hand. The detective knelt as he carefully bandaged the injured foot then stood, kissed his doctor on the top of soft blond hair, and turned to clean up the broken shards of mug off the floor, pointedly ignoring the dejected look on his blogger’s face.
And John remembers the silver packet tucked mostly neglected in the top drawer of his desk. He’d been taking them when he could remember but the back to back cases have ruined any sense of organization he had. The new business with Moriarty threw what little order he had out the window. But there were no pre-heat symptoms, no nesting, no binging…but still, there’s no doubting Sherlock’s alpha nose. A heat now is the next to the most inconvenient thing that could have occurred. Beyond that, they’re new relationship is just too young…it’s too early on to share a heat.
?). If the panting is anything to go by, John’s wound up and not far from orgasm which is perfect because it’s been years since the last time Sherlock’s been touched and being so close to the blond again has only made him ache for release.
If John must choose between sacrificing his dignity or being in pain, dignity can very well go hang. Just so long as Sherlock doesn’t see him do it . . . he’d never hear the end of it then, and neither, he suspects, would Lestrade and his team, or anyone else they know.
The door opens, and if John didn’t know better, he would say it opened almost cautiously, revealing a dressing gown-clad Sherlock, looking none the worse for wear after what had likely been another sleepless night. Once he spots John where he rests sprawled almost drunkenly on the floor, the door swings open and Sherlock enters the room in his usual imperious manner, something which John has begin to suspect that Sherlock isn’t even aware that he does. Like flipping up his collar.
For the first time in what feels like -though is objectively not- quite a while, the first thing that John Watson is conscious of when he wakes is not pain, but rather warmth or, more specifically, one shoulder being significantly warmer than the other.
Sherlock merely scoffs, the clearest sign of him being at a loss for words, but it is the wounded look that flickers in his eye that encourages John to take pity on him.
And there's no denying that, even after eliminating the ideas of "fault" and "responsibility," these events were still directly caused by actions that Sherlock had chosen to undertake.
Even once he’d arrived and the stand off had begun, the sound of water echoing off ceramic tile and concrete had been just loud enough that Moriarty’s personal exchange with John had been muffled, and lip-reading hadn’t been much help with Moriarty turned away from him like that, too intent on whatever the doctor had to say to face Sherlock head on. That too was no-doubt intentional, just another piece in the elaborate puzzle designed to muddle Sherlock’s crystal clear thinking, but knowing that the actions had been intentional, oddly enough, did little to minimize their effect. Particularly when Sherlock could see plainly enough the physical evidence that, trick though it may have been, it wasn’t founded on nothing, no, the thrilled shivering and the rise of goosebumps had been at least somewhat genuine.
He walks over to John, but there’s a moment of something almost like hesitation, a fraction of a second during which his hands hover over John without actually touching before he seizes him and hauls him bodily upright. Sherlock’s never been the type to hover-hand, John thinks hazily, he’s not shy about physical contact, or even nudity, which John realizes is somewhat in play since he’s wearing only his pants. But Sherlock’s never been shy about pretty much anything, and if he’s not inclined towards engaging in physical contact in a context in which it’s expected of him, he gives little care, stating his aversion in no uncertain terms.
And possessiveness is a more comfortable thing to feel than the vulnerability that accompanies simple, sincere affection.
Johnny boy has shown his hand and Jim points out as much, relishing the little, sharp intake of breath beside his ear as a red laser sight hovers upon the pale skin of Sherlock’s forehead. He’s expecting the sudden release of those confining arms; showing the adversary the inevitability of their defeat should they resist does typically result in surrender, but he’s pleasantly surprised by a sudden constriction of the limbs surrounding him, moving from bruising to suffocating.
“I knew you were cold-blooded, but that’s next level,” Jim croons with genuine appreciation, he’s always found ruthlessness to be a good look on a person, “Your looks are deceiving, Johnny.”
“Good,” John shoots back, “Because that was a genuinely fantastic cock-up, Sherlock, and the mistakes made weren’t mine.”
These thoughts are all, of course, unnecessary and foolish and entirely beneath him, but all the same, it’s getting to the point where not even he can entirely deny their existence, or indeed the way they’re affecting his mood. He’s aware, logically, of what his priorities are, or what they should be, but at this particular moment, he’s not abiding by them, and failing to summon up the energy to care.  And that simply serves to complicate matters all the more.
It’s quiet in the flat, unusually so, and the silence can only suggest that Sherlock has worn himself out and collapsed somewhere into a well-needed sleep by now, and John winces at the thought of what Sherlock might have been doing to wear himself out while he’s been entirely without John’s supervision. Still, he’s not exactly inclined to disrupt this temporary and quite rare peace, so he treads carefully upon leaving the room, avoiding the one particularly squeaky board as much as possible as he turns to close the door behind him.
It's a short chapter, but I wanted to give you something at least, and it seemed like a good spot for a chapter break.
Yes, that’s what’s upset him, that’s it. John’s appearance had been unforeseen, Sherlock hadn’t anticipated him being taken by Moriarty before their . . . appointment, hadn’t expected his flatmate to be thrown in as an extra element, as leverage, although perhaps, in hindsight, that had been an error in reasoning on his part. There’s nothing worse than an element of surprise being thrown into a carefully choreographed exchange; it’s unsettling, irritating.
He replies, or tries to, because what really emerges from his throat is something more like a strangled croak than what he intended to say, which had been something along the lines of “piss off.” Or, alternatively, “I’m fine,” as both are floating at the forefront of his mind, but John’s not sure which of the two would have actually come out had he been able to construct a comprehensible sentence.
John told him that he could take the other side of the bed … It’s perfectly reasonable, after all, it is comfortably big enough for the both of them to sleep without getting much in the other’s way, and whatever discomfort that the close proximity might inspire would be sufficiently cancelled out by the anticipated depth of their unconsciousness. It’s reasonable, yet Sherlock hesitates, which is not like him. He’s never put much stock in boundaries, never been too concentrated on observing them, so why is this line harder to cross, even once given explicit permission?
At least this time when he awakes his mind is clear enough to remember the fact that sudden movements, particularly of his leg, will hurt like an absolute bitch, and he thus takes his sweet time coming fully into consciousness, letting his eyes get used to fluttering about before any attempts to open his eyelids. Upon opening them, he takes a moment to observe a crack on the ceiling that he hadn’t paid much attention to before, letting the sight divert him from the pain that grows with each moment of wakefulness. He recognizes however, that if he doesn’t want it to become truly awful, he’d best get moving, at least enough to get his medication and a glass of something to wash it down with.
He slides his hand away from Johnny boy’s face as if giving a caress before reaching for his hidden knife, which he’s slightly disappointed neither of them had noticed, but then, he supposes, they were a bit preoccupied. He strikes quickly and within a moment it’s sticking out of John’s leg like the thorn of some massive deadly rose; the arms around him tighten briefly in shock, but they release as the pain sweeps in on a wave, impossible to just ignore, and John Watson, sinks to the ground. It won’t kill the man, at least not anytime soon, but he is going to want to get it seen to once Moriarty has left.
It’s easier to drift off to sleep here, next to John, than Sherlock would have predicted, but then, John’s always been different, hasn’t he?
Turning carefully and swinging his legs off the side of the bed to let his feet rest gingerly against the floor, John congratulates his past self on the foresight he’d had to leave his cane within reach from his bed, despite the fact that he uses it so rarely these days. Taking it in hand, he uses it to heave himself up into a standing position, clenching his teeth at the agonizing tightness in his leg and cursing a variety of people and things: Sherlock, Sally, Lestrade, Anderson, his own leg, the very concept of knives … But not Moriarty, not right now. He’s not ready to think about that yet, and cursing Moriarty would involve far too much thinking about him for John’s comfort.
But then, that’s the convenient thing about the whole ‘sleep’ situation isn’t it? If, for whatever reason, he fails to reign in the impulse to lay a hand on John’s chest as he sleeps, to feel the continued beating of a heart and the comforting rise and fall of breathing, if he fails, he can blame it on a movement made in sleep. A truly unconscious effort. And while that might not totally do away with any social discomfort upon waking, it will certainly limit it.
He is, isn’t he? Of course he is, the alternative is simply unthinkable, a thought that is not to be entertained.
He imagines Moriarty, in preparation for Sherlock’s arrival, pushing John around at the business end of some deadly weapon or another, forcing him into that horrid vest, strapping him in . . . hands wandering more than is strictly appropriate for any self-respecting professional criminal . . . and the positively vile swapping of saliva that the man had subjected John to, an action Sherlock had actually been there to witness, making his stomach genuinely turn in revulsion . . . Sherlock has no reason to feel so strongly about it, not when John, who’d actually experienced it, had hardly appeared concerned by it in the slightest, the knife no doubt of greater consequence in the moment, much as it should be. But John’s been injured before, worse than this, and he’s always healed perfectly well . . . it’s just the rest that’s never happened before, and with no previous evidence collected, upon which Sherlock would be able to reflect and form predictions, he’s facing an unsettling uncertainty.
And he’s sleeping, while John’s awake, which, while not entirely heard of, is an uncommon occurrence. It was surprising enough to catch him sleeping outside John’s bedroom earlier, but the fact that he’s sleeping now, seemingly heavily, and doing so longer than John, edges away from surprise and in the direction of concern. He must really be exhausted …
The shiver is real, a genuine response, but no one has ever been able to accuse Jim Moriarty of not being a dramatic actor, and with Sherlock looking on, so adorably lost for all his cleverness, Jim can’t not play this up.
Both options are fucking awful, and John is taking it personally, going by the number of times he’s had to remind himself to include all the other people they know who could’ve been hurt. He’s taking it personally, because he could’ve -would’ve- died for this man, and this man either disregarded him, or forgot about him. A man for whom he has killed before.
He wakes, quite frankly, feeling as though a gerbil has been living inside his skull, an oddly specific feeling which is difficult for him to describe in any other words, but if he has to be general, the word ‘uncomfortable’ will surely do. He feels a bit like he’s stuffed with cotton wool as the heaves himself awkwardly out of bed and wobbles his way towards the window for about two steps, before very suddenly being given an extremely pointed reminder of the fact that he’d had a knife sticking out of his leg last night, but a few hours ago.
Were he any less tired, he would have been compelled to analyse the reasons behind this, but as it is, an exhaustion that he would never publicly admit to feeling weighs heavily upon his shoulders, causing him to slump inelegantly in the chair, feeling the hard edges digging into the flesh of his legs. It doesn’t bother him, per say, not enough to force him to move, but it’s certainly encouragement to consider whatever more comfortable options may be available.
Not that silence was at all unfamiliar to either of them. Sherlock had been quite serious and quite honest when he’d told John that he sometimes didn’t speak for days on end, and with all the time they’ve spent together now, the silent spells had become almost routine, much as the outbursts and associated nonsense had become rather routine. Even before Sherlock and his long periods of laconism, John had gotten to know silence very well, sitting alone in his cheap digs largely bare of furniture, nothing particular to get out of bed for, and no one much that he cared to speak to. Just a gun in a drawer that he did his damnedest not to think so much about.
For now, I'm back home resting up in between doctor's visits, and I intend to spend my awake time writing and drawing to be somewhat productive while I'm without employment.
He looks down at said limbs, dragging his fingernails across the grain of the wood flooring in quiet contemplation, listening to the soft scraping sound it makes. His head is so damnably full of swirling thoughts that it might as well be empty for how much actual, useful concentration he’s been able to summon up. Every closing of his eyes takes him right back to the poolside, to the smell of chlorine and adrenaline-induced sweat, to the shuddering of his heart as John had walked out of the shadow, his face thrown into stark relief by the sickly blue-green fluorescent lighting, his form padded out not with fluffy jumpers, but with explosives. Speaking in a voice not his own, in someone else’s voice . . . Moriarty’s voice . . .
He finds his jacket slung over a chair, probably where he left it, as he highly doubts that Sherlock would’ve bothered to put it there had he found it anywhere else. In his pocket, he finds the bottle of pain medication that he was given, and while loathe to give up his newfound clarity, he recognizes that it would be best, at least for this first day, to remain in the painless stupor of medicinal fog the pills provide. Even if that means walking downstairs on his injured leg to get some water . . . or perhaps more likely, scooting down the stairs on his arse to get something to drink.
His shoulder is warm, it turns out, because Sherlock’s hand is resting upon it, or more accurately clinging to the cloth where John’s shirt stretches over his shoulder, his fingers entangled in it in a way that is no doubt going to create some dreadful wrinkles. There is a moment of mild concern for his shirt, which John knows is cheap enough that such a grasp for such a length of time will likely distort the fabric permanently, but longer lasting than that is a vague sort of concern for Sherlock. He’s never been altogether careful about physical boundaries, certainly not for the other person’s sake, but neither can he be described as the clingy type.
‘Is he just going to stand out there all day?’ John thinks briefly, hazily, before the medicated sleep swallows him up, leaving him to a mercifully dreamless slumber.
Once he’s in the room, he sighs in his put-upon way, which John has to admit he’s definitely had a hand in creating, being a frequent user of that sort of sigh himself, most often directed at Sherlock. The man was bound to pick it up and turn it back around on John; such is his way.
The different chapters will be from different perspectives, illuminating, with time, the feelings that have long laid buried.
“Thank you, no,” John tells him, feeling the effects of the medicine he’d taken begin to set back in in force, “I think the main thing I need is to be unconscious for a good, long while, and perhaps a hand in changing the dressings whenever it is that I wake up.”
He wheezes, ribs spasming beneath crushing arms, and he’s enjoying the novelty of it, enough to forgo having the both of them shot where they stand. No one ever touches him, no one ever gets close enough to try, and he personally doesn’t prefer to get his hands dirty, so physical contact at all is an oddity, and all the more so when he can feel how much the grip wants him dead.
“My snipers could just shoot you in the head, you know,” he mentions casually, tossing the phrase back over his shoulder with a familiarity that makes Sherlock’s shoulders stiffen, if only for a moment, “The vest is a frill that I admit I love, and I’m reluctant to see it go unused, but a bullet to your brain will do much the same job.”
Sherlock darts forward at the words, but just before he reaches John, his movement slows, hesitant, indicating that John’s perception of Sherlock helping him up from the floor earlier might not have been as far off as he’d assumed. The reason for it, however, remains unclear as Sherlock hovers just outside the realm of effectiveness, standing a foot too far from John to do him any actual good.
He takes advantage of the moment of shock to run off, leaving one man stunned and the other bleeding sluggishly around Moriarty’s blade, letting the laughter that’s been bubbling up inside his chest escape, echoing around the pool along with the sound of the slamming door as he properly takes his leave. He knows suspicion and doubt and blame will begin to roil in his wake, and when he finally answers his phone, his voice is bright, a testament to a positively marvelous mood.
