“Yeah you can,” Dean corrected. “Look. I forgive you for the way Sam and I grew up. I really do. But that doesn’t mean I want a relationship with you now. That’s not Heaven to me.”
Castiel offered a look of sympathy. “You were being hunted down by God. You know we both forgive you for not handling that well.”
Dean hugged Mary again, squeezing her tighter than before. “I’m sorry about how everything ended back on Earth—”
Dean answered by shutting him up with a long, passionate kiss. Self-loathing and doubt weren’t welcome at this moment. Just love. Life-altering, universe-saving love. Dean’s whole body warmed with it.
The dreamscape immediately gave way to total blackness. Sam and Dean again stood in the Empty, and Castiel stood facing them.
“What he’s made about? Probably the time I caught him getting fucked by some little flamer, so I knocked some sense into him.”
“Like what? Being strong? Getting revenge? That’s your bullshit,” Dean said. “Not mine. That’s not who I am. That’s never been who I am.”
Dean lowered his eyes and stared at the scuff mark on the floor. He’d thought about how this reveal might go with any number of his friends and family, how it might change how his loved ones saw him. Bobby, he’d always thought, would be fine. And if Dean didn’t tell him, Bobby would soon figure it out. It was better to control the situation.
“No one. Every soul has the ability to shelter itself. No one should be able to come here without you inviting them.”
Part of Dean’s mind was screaming at him to answer with affection. The other part—the part that won—panicked and threatened him. He brushed off the question, bolstering his self-loathing in the process.
Castiel confronted his tormentor. “I only want to be left alone. I have no intention of raising armies or interfering in any way.”
come back. I could have kept fighting, and you and I could have really lived, and you wouldn’t be stuck with angels in your outfield.”
When he was alive, Dean had pictured one particular moment that never came: a family dinner. A celebration of conquering every damn monster that ever came their way. A toast to beating God at his own damn game. Now the moment was his.
Dean didn’t bother to take the Impala. He thought about the bunker and he was there, standing in its vast entrance, alone.
Castiel spoke about his greatest flaw like it was an asset. “I mean it. You’ve fallen in love with the most uncontrollable being in the universe, and I will stop anyone who tries to ruin Heaven for you—even if it’s
?” Castiel spoke in exasperation, the irony of his next statement not lost on him. “Do you need anything else, or can I go?”
“Being unwanted.” Castiel’s face scrunched up. “I’ve never really belonged anywhere, and every time I think I do, I’m wrong. I can’t help but think I’m going to end up being wrong again.”
“I thought you were gone. You can’t do that to me. You can’t—” Dean stopped himself, unable to believe and unwilling to show how worried he really was.
Then Castiel did what he was best at. He stood there, awkwardly, unsure how to proceed. This was their happy ending, but he wasn’t sure he’d earned it. Part of him expected the curtain to fall back and reveal he was in Hell. Dean took a step toward him, and Castiel took a step back. He stared intently at Dean, looking for some sign that anything was amiss.
A nerdy little marshal with armor enrobed by an orange safety vest walked out into the middle of the field to explain the rules of engagement. Standard stuff. No hits to the head, neck, or junk. No charging. No spinning. Call out “Hold!” if for some reason the battle needed to pause.
“I am,” Castiel said. “Happiness is separate from wanting. What I want...what I really want... is for you to be happy.”
Castiel lowered his head and looked up with the self-aware face he made when he attempted humor. “Only as old as you feel.”
In no time, they were naked. Castiel rolled on top of Dean and began worshipping every inch of his body with tongue flicks and kisses.
Charlie looked to where Castiel was the last man standing in a field of fallen LARPers. Dean’s gaze followed hers, but lingered on Cas long after Charlie had turned back to him. He was lost in thought. If she was right, and this could all end any moment, he wouldn’t want to spend his time hemming and hawing and wallowing in self-hatred. He might not have been able to do anything about that last one, but the first two?
By the time the song ended, Dean’s lips were on Castiel’s for the first time. They came together softly. The electricity that normally filled the air when Cas appeared now moved between their lips. The warmness Dean felt every time he was around his angel concentrated itself in his mouth. He’d kissed hundreds of people, but none ever hit him like this.
“Oh, I’ve been to beaches. Killed a few vampirates at one. Crab monster at another. Never like this, though. Never to just...go.”
“Yeah, yeah. You just want to join the battle. Fine.” She pointed to a wide grass field. “The orcs are thattaway. We’re attacking shortly. You two need costumes.”
“That’s Heaven for you,” Castiel said. Miracle scampered over and nuzzled his leg, so Castiel looked down at him. “Good dog.”
That night, he did something he hadn’t in what felt like an eternity. He knelt beside his bed, clasped his hands, and closed his eyes. “Dean. I know you’re not an angel or God and that you most likely can’t hear me. But if by some chance you can, I want you to know that I’m trying. I’m trying to live a life you’d be proud of me for. Life... human life... is... not easy. I just wish you were here to help me.”
From there, they took their time chopping fruit and cooking it down. They also took their time rolling out the dough, which was much more intimate than Dean had ever imagined baking could be. At first, he demonstrated on a separate rolling pin. But Cas kept rolling with angel strength, leaving a tissue-thin bit of dough stuck to the counter. Nothing pie-worthy.
“What have you been doing all this time?” Sam was actually interested and enthusiastic. That made it so much worse.
“When I lived as Emmanuel, I danced at my wedding.” He paused, then made a coy correction. “I don’t suppose that counts.”
Dean reclaimed the spotlight, and basked in it. He left no inch of the stage untraversed as he gave the performance everything he had.
The pantry was fully stocked and nothing would ever expire. Dean started rifling through it for flour, sugar, salt, cinnamon, ginger—
Charlie continued. “Also… Last I checked, Heaven was part of the universe. No one really knows how any of this works. What if the universe goes kaput? What if dark energy is about to eat the whole shebang? What if God dies again? What if we’re seconds from the end of all things? Aren’t you gonna want to spend it with your Sam, Mister Frodo?”
“How many times have you seen your brother? Your parents? Bobby?” He gestured toward the Roadhouse. “You just came from there, so I assume you’ve seen Ellen and Jo. Maybe Rufus? Ash?”
Castiel stood up. “Because this is what we fought for. Free will. Life was never meant to be the way it has been the last few years.”
Dean mingled. He caught up with Ellen, Joe, Ash, Rufus, their original Charlie… It was nice. It was something Dean needed to heal. But it wasn’t Heaven. After a while, he’d had enough.
Castiel gestured with his hand, pulling John across the room to him. “I’m the one who’s going to throw you back into perdition.”
He grabbed John by the throat, and strangled him as hard as he could without destroying his soul’s form. Still holding him by the neck, Castiel slammed John into a wall.
Dean didn’t get such a graceful landing. When he let out a groan of pain, Castiel turned to find him lying on the ground with a piece of rebar jutting out of his chest. Dean’s hands fumbled at it as he registered what happened.
The angel smiled as Dean came to. It was always with a short yawn, then a fluttering of his eyes until they could focus on Castiel’s face.
Dean exhaled sharply, affirming that. “Yeah. Once Lee was gone, he… I’ve never had a beating like that in my life. Not on any hunt. Not when you were brainwashed by Naomi.”
He pulled the car over to the side of the road and put it in park. There were nothing but empty fields as far as the eye could see, not that Dean was looking that far. He scooted across Baby’s bench seat and planted his lips on Castiel’s.
Dean smiled. He couldn’t help it. “You gotta get tougher with this game, man. A whole song, though…” He thought of one he knew by heart, and started right into it, “
“Dean, you do give orders. You are, as you would say, a ‘total control freak.’ And you’ve decided that Heaven is going to spiral into some terrible experience. So much so that you’ll take a pleasant interaction with Bobby and spin it into a disaster. Well, too bad.”
This chapter and the next dive deeper into John Winchester's abuses and the number they've done on Dean (including suicide-adjacent thoughts). I don't think anything is particularly graphic, but I'm desensitized. If reading about these things might trouble you, skip ahead to Chapter 17. Context clues will get you through.
...you love. I just want you happy. Enjoy your eldritch horror. Hell, better that than spendin’ a year with a one night stand ‘cuz you’ve got mommy issues.”
From his shoulder came a muffled, “Hello, Dean.” Castiel’s voice was despondent, and up close, Dean noticed that his blue eyes were surrounded by red.
The hair on Dean’s arms stood up straight. Dean knew what he wanted, and he wasn’t going to give himself time to overthink and ruin it. He imagined lube into existence, raised his hips, and looked right into the angel’s eyes.
Castiel rolled his eyes, and got back to the only thing he figured he was good for: helping the Winchesters. “What’s wrong with Sam?”
On what he’d forced to be an early autumn day, the two men sat outside the bunker, on a red checkered blanket. As they unpacked food from a picnic basket, Dean eyed a sandwich with suspicion.
Until one day, John was home. Dean didn’t know how the topic of conversation got where it did, but one moment he was fine and the next he felt like he was dying all over again.
Dean noticed that Cas was hiding his hands behind his back. He tilted his head in suspicion. “What were you even—”
“I know you can’t.” Dean sat down on the couch. “It feels like a while, though. It feels like something to toast to, or...”
The exchange did not go unnoticed by Charlie, but she simply shook her head and proceeded toward the front lines. “Come on.”
“I’m serious. You can’t be happy if dad’s here, and you can’t be happy knowing he’s there. It doesn’t matter if he’s in Hell or Heaven’s dungeons or Purgatory or anywhere. It’s not your responsibility, and you have to let it go, or there’s always going to be something stopping you from having what you deserve.”
While Sam made the call, Castiel instinctively put his hand on Dean’s chest. He was human now, and they both knew it, but he felt he owed Dean an explanation anyway.
One moment, Dean was on the floor of a barn gasping for breath. The next, he stood outside Harvelle’s Roadhouse. He tapped at his chest, searching for the rebar. Nothing. He was healed.
“You are worthy of more than I could ever give you.” Castiel stared deeply into his eyes. “You really have no idea how happy I am just to be here with you.”
The way Jack had explained it, the Empty was again silent and peaceful. And when he’d gone there to retrieve Castiel, the angel had declined.
“Don’t apologize,” Dean said. “There’s no reason my bullshit would be on your mind. You’re ancient. You’re like...a hundred years out from dad’s death. You play
“He’s dreamy. You’re obviously into it. And you’re dead. There’s no world to save. There are zero obligations keeping you two apart...”
He awoke in a cornfield, cognizant of where he was. It was Heaven. A few yards ahead of him stood a familiar face, holding a glass of scotch in one hand and its bottle in the other.
Dean counted on his fingers. “For one, I’m not eating gas station food in a hotel room. Two: I don’t wish my dad were here. At all. And three… no gifts. It’s Heaven. Everyone has everything they want.”
“Cas is my friend. You’re my brother. If you think I’m not going to help you both find happiness, you don’t know me.”
Some time after their Truth or Dare session, Dean and Castiel were sitting in the kitchen over half-finished plates of pancakes when Dean asked a question that wasn’t prompted by a juvenile game.
Castiel turned to him. “Am I dying, Sam?” His voice cracked as he followed that with, “Is this how Dean felt in that barn?”
“Don’t act surprised,” Dean said. He raised a bottle, to toast. “Four dead hunters, one fruity angel, and God Junior. Team Free Will 3.0. We did it, and we’re here.”
Dean reflected on Sam living life to its fullest, while he’d done nothing, and decided—once again—that John had been right. He really was a disappointment, and he wouldn’t be able to hide it. The question that would prove it was coming, any minute—
“You got me.” Dean shook his head briefly, then put on a smirk. “But just so you know, I’m gonna rock your world some day.”
Castiel had possibly the strangest bedside manner of any registered nurse, but there was something hospice patients found reassuring about him. For those who were religious, he shared stories of his faith (modified, of course). For those who weren’t, he provided simple comfort.
Mary shook her head. “I was going to say I never wanted anything but for you to be happy. I hope it’s not too late for that.”
Dean scowled because Sam had a point, but he continued anyway. “Because it’s Cas. How many times has he died or wandered off? He always comes back. He always
was stupid. I figured I was feeling some cosmic mojo and it was a mistake. Because what would a celestial being want with me?”
Sam accepted that. “So, Dean. I was wondering if you wanted to stop in right now. Eileen and I made a stupidly huge dinner. It’s just us, no mom and dad.” He paused and made a suggestion. “You can bring Cas.”
“You’re trying to drive me away,” Castiel said simply. He released Dean’s arm and stepped around to his side of the counter. “Because it’s easier for you to wallow in self-hatred than it is to admit there are things beyond your control. You did this with your memories of Purgatory. And with everything we went through with Michael and Chuck…Self-determination means more to you than ever.”
. But the last few times you died, I had other people. I had Sam. And all I could think about was getting you back. All I could do was just… sleep and drink and... punch things. And that’s all I was doing here until you showed up. If I lost you here, I don’t know what I’d do. But I know it would be my fault, because…” Dean caught himself vomiting words, and trailed off.
“But you tried to tell me. When you first got here. You wanted to…” She trailed off. Like her son, she’d never be able to forgive herself.
Dean ignored him and barreled into the kitchen. He pulled a sixer from the fridge, popped open a bottle, and chugged.
“I’m sorry,” Castiel said. He opened his trench coat, pulled out an unlabeled bottle of something, and took a deep swig of Heaven’s finest 200-proof liquor.
With that, Castiel disappeared, and the area was still. Dean was alone, again. He knew where his angel had gone, and it was a place he didn’t want to follow.
That was enough to break Castiel. He threw his arms around Dean and rambled. “I missed you. I did my best, but I missed you every day. I missed you such much I prayed to you.”
Back on Earth, when Amara resurrected Mary, Dean had lashed out at his mother for what he saw as her abandoning her family. Now the two of them had sent John to Hell, and Mary did the same thing she’d done back then: she ran away to figure things out. This time, Dean didn’t blame her for needing time alone. He couldn’t.
“This’ll do.” Dean grabbed a record, stood, and took it to the record player. As he adjusted the needle to where he wanted it, he looked back over his shoulder at Cas. “Lose the trenchcoat.”
Castiel knew he’d never have it if they didn’t deal with this. He tightened his grip on Dean’s hand. “I’ve got you, Dean.”
Castiel could have willed the movie paused. Instead, he reached over, grabbed the remote, and slowly pressed down on the pause button while staring at Dean. For emphasis.
Faintly, in the background of everything, they could hear Dean’s voice in place of nature. Not this Dean, but another Dean.
There were things Dean wanted to experience, sure, but almost none he wanted to experience alone. He needed his brother, and he needed Cas. He needed Cas more than anything. But the angel just had to go and tell Dean he loved him, and Dean had no idea what to do with that information. So he needed someone he could figure it out with. He needed Sam, but Sam wasn’t dead yet. Dean was grateful for that, but gratitude didn’t ease his loneliness.
Dean didn’t see that. He was too absorbed in Cas’s lips, using his own to say three words before he could verbalize them. Dean let go of Castiel’s face, and dropped back slightly into the angel’s arms. He watched Cas’s eyes return to blue, in awe.
calls—and I start to wonder. This ain’t healthy, sittin’ around boo-hooin’ in paradise. You should be out there enjoyin’ people’s company, findin’ a soulmate, some—”
“They instinctively know their place. I wonder… what would happen if bees were truly free? If they didn’t exist under their own confines?”
Dean wanted to say something that would make Cas stay, but all that came out was an irritated “You can go.”
Like Cas, Dean refused to leave. The bunker and its surrounding area were his own personal slice of Heaven, and the longer he stayed there with Cas, the easier it was to push
“I get it,” Mary said. “You’ve never been able to put your wants and needs first. Now you can, and you’re not sure what that looks like?”
There were plenty of things Dean wanted to discuss with Cas, and in his emotional stuntedness, he came up with the most juvenile method of doing so. They sat on the couch, drinking to the end of another crappy movie, when Dean dropped a question.
Dean jumped out of bed and transformed his pajamas into jeans and flannel. “Who else can get into the bunker?”
A large bucket of movie theater popcorn appeared at the center of the leather couch that had replaced the two recliners. Dean had claimed he was sick of the recliners and wanted to redecorate, and he may have believed that a little. But subconsciously, he didn’t want to keep Cas at a distance. Not ever again.
“Cut the butter into small cubes,” Dean said. He realized that was vague and corrected himself. “Half-inch cubes.”
The record player moved on to “You Don’t Fool Me.” They paid it no attention. Dean moved a hand to Castiel’s cheek, as if he needed to hold on or he’d lose him again. They kissed harder, their tongues colliding in something they’d both wanted for longer than either of them knew. Cas reached for Dean’s shoulder—
.” Sam couldn’t see the dead-eyed stare on Dean’s face, but he could hear the irritation in his brother’s voice.
Castiel crowded his ornaments in a small cluster near the tree’s base, a loose interpretation of a carbon atom. By all conventional standards, it looked terrible and left the rest of the tree more bare than it should have been. But by Dean’s standards, it looked great because Cas did it, and because it was hilarious.
“I imagine so.” Castiel sighed. “I’m sure he’s still repairing the multiverse. I just wish I knew for sure.”
There came a point in every serious Winchester conversation when Dean knew he wasn’t going to get out of sharing his feelings. The glowering look Sam gave him marked that point.
Castiel Novak Winchester enrolled at a nearby community college, unsure of what he was going to do yet. He just knew that whatever it was, he would help people.
Dean tried. With each hand held by someone he loved, he imagined a hundred futures at once. Things to look forward to. Introducing Cas to Miracle. The dinner the three of them would have with Eileen when they got back to the bunker. Teaching Cas how to make pie. Getting his hands on every inch of Cas’s body. Having a normal job...maybe a mechanic...and coming home every day to the love of his life. Being Sam’s Best Man. Uncle Dean and Uncle Cas absolutely ruining Sam’s kids with pie and pranks.
Castiel, of course, couldn’t sleep. When he was human, he never developed a taste for it. Now, he pined for the ability as he lay next to Dean, watching the sleeping hunter’s shallow breaths.
Sam shook his head at both of those statements. “I always knew you protected me and took the brunt of dad’s abuse. I didn’t know it was that bad. If I had...”
Dean sat on Baby’s hood, in front of the Roadhouse, sipping a road beer. In his mind, the debate that had been turning over since he arrived in Heaven became more and more heated. He’d failed at talking to Mary. He’d failed at talking to Sam. Dean considered that maybe his brother was right and it was time to call for Cas. The deep unease in his gut told him he wasn’t ready, but there weren’t many options. It was this or suffer in silence.
While the angel worked at that with a comically oversized knife, Dean whisked together flour, sugar, and salt. He had an idea.
“I died younger than you did, you son of a bitch.” Dean had finally started speaking, and he couldn’t stop. “I died because you made me carry the whole world on my shoulders, so I could never stop hunting, never stop chasing cases that
Castiel had registered Dean’s words, and they’d been enough to wake him. But he hadn’t understood the intent behind them.
Dean pulled away and looked into Castiel’s eyes, which were again filled with life. “I’m saying you were wrong about what you can never have. You can have me. You...already have me. I love you. I, uh...I’m kind of making this up as I go along. I don’t have the words to tell you how much I love you. I just do. And I want you to come home.”
There was no reason they needed to burn the body, but Sam assumed that Dean would want a hunter’s funeral and Castiel was utterly indifferent because it wasn’t Dean anymore.
Dean left and didn’t return. He didn’t go anywhere at all. He retreated to the bunker, surrounded himself with alcohol and pie, and wasted time—however many bottles worth.
After a long drive that didn’t need to be long but for authenticity, the two arrived at a heavenly beach. It had all the accoutrements—crashing waves, towering palm trees, squawking seagulls, errant seashells, and touristing souls in centuries’ worth of swimsuit styles. Dean and Cas settled in a semi-secluded area, on a blanket under their beach umbrella.
Though he was otherworldly, Castiel was usually so soft. Moments like this reminded Dean of the angel’s sheer, terrifying power.
“No.” Castiel looked up with swollen, red eyes and tears streaming down his face. “I can’t stop crying. My chest is tight. I feel like I’m suffocating.”
Dean considered bragging about his stint in Avalon, realm of the fairies, but ultimately went a different direction. “Man, I gotta visit the Empty to catch ‘em all.”
As Mary tried to blame herself for not single-handedly fixing something, Dean recognized himself in his mother. He reciprocated her hug, fiercely.
Halfway through the terrible movie he’d seen dozens of times, Dean fell asleep leaning on Cas’s shoulder. The angel grabbed a throw pillow, set it on his lap, and moved his shoulder to let Dean fall onto the pillow. Dean let out one sleepy groan, then went quiet and still.
Spread out in front of them was a picturesque turkey dinner, with all the accoutrements. Anyone could create a perfect meal in Heaven, but Dean had really
“I love you.” Castiel said the words and meant them, but his face didn’t match them. It scrunched in pain.
Curiosity shifted into fear. Dean leapt from his horse and ran back down the path, in near panic. Horrible things could and did happen in Heaven, and Cas had made a point of how much the other angels hated him.
Castiel wobbled a bit in the attempt, but it was still an admirable one. Dean chuckled as he caught him, then pulled him in closer than before. Desire and despair played tug of war in Dean’s mind, and desire won for a change. Their chests touched, their eyes met for the briefest moment, and Dean was done for. Just being with Cas wasn’t enough. The final lyrics kicked in—
It was Godzilla and Mothra all over again. Dean’s mind traveled to when he first met Cas, and then focused on where it happened. Hell. There was no getting it out of his thoughts. He maintained his happy face and finished the song, but he needed to get out of the bar and fast.
Castiel looked at him sadly. “I hadn’t planned on being with my brothers and sisters again. Not like this.”
Sam pondered. “So angels go to the Empty and they sleep… Are we in Cas’s dream? Is that a thing we can be in?”
As his lips parted, making way for Dean’s, Castiel tossed his sword to the ground and wrapped his arms around Dean’s waist. He felt a soft burst of Dean’s breath on his face, and the angel’s blue eyes once again brightened to white.
“The universe?” Castiel wondered. “Chuck? Fate? Myself? I don’t know. But we’re both stuck here for eternity, and I refuse to stay angry at you. I’m sorry for the way I spoke to you before.”
“Is that what you think I’m doing?” Dean wondered. He thought he’d been pretty clear that he loved Cas, and that he never, ever wanted to talk about it. In his mind, they’d agreed to just chill in Heaven and pretend this was all very normal. Dean was, in a word, an idiot.
Castiel didn’t care about John. He cared about his son. He scanned their new god for signs that anything might be wrong. “Jack... how are you?”
Castiel could feel Dean’s hand shaking, so he spoke on his behalf. “Ask your husband what he did to your son.”
The angel could have easily escaped. Instead, he put up just enough resistance to let Dean know he strongly disliked the idea.
Castiel shook his head. “Each bee has a different job. Some of them build combs. Some feed their brood. Some protect the others. Some remove their dead.”
On Naomi’s direction, angel radio blasted him again. Every angel at Naomi’s command screamed into his mind. He was worthless. Useless. An abomination. He’d ruined Heaven. He’d ruined their lives. He ruined everything. They screamed it and screamed it.
There was a brief stillness to everything, then a presence—like every atom in the air around him became charged. After all the time they’d spent together on Earth, Dean simply knew when the angel was near. The hair on his arms stood up, and his soul felt both lighter and warmer. Then he heard a flapping of wings that he hadn’t heard in forever.
Castiel grabbed Dean by the flannel, pulled him in close, then shoved him against the kitchen wall. His eyes glowing with passion, righteous fury, or both, he slammed his lips into Dean’s and prodded the hunter’s beer-flavored mouth with his tongue.
As they made out, Dean’s hand slowly moved from the angel’s shoulder down his firm chest, then drifted to his shorts. Dean unbuttoned them. Overwhelmed by the desire to put Cas in his mouth, Dean pulled away from Castiel’s face and let his head fall to the angel’s lap.
The couple ran down their vibrating stairs to find a glowing, furious angel floating over the foyer floor—one Mary recognized in an instant.
.” Dean’s anger and guilt both came through in his voice. “It felt like I waited forever for you to get here. Then you got here and started talking about Eileen and your family…all the things I wanted and could never have… I felt like I was living in your shadow.”
Naomi ignored the human. “Like it or not, Castiel, you are...influential. Others see you choosing a human and... well, we’re hemorrhaging angels. Next thing you know, we’ll be overwhelmed with nephilim. That’s not going to end well for anyone.”
First came a welcoming hug and a brief explanation that they really were in Heaven and that, yes, Dean had checked. Yes, he was sure it wasn’t really Hell. It wasn’t a scheme by Chuck or Lucifer or anyone else. It was what Bobby called “the Heaven they deserved.”
“Then why do you believe yourself that you should feel like shit, and not me and Cas when we say you shouldn’t?”
“Truth,” Dean grumbled. He knew Cas well enough to know he wouldn’t force Dean to talk about their situation—whatever their situation was—and he wanted to know what the angel would come up with.
Dean could practically see the angel’s thoughts, and he shrugged off the abuse. “I’ve been to Hell, Cas. I can take a beating. The things he said, though, for years…”
No part of Dean wanted to sit outside watching bees, but every part of him wanted to make Cas happy. And, frankly, the angel had put up with enough of his bullshit that he could tolerate the bee thing. So they left the bunker and went outside, where Castiel had created his own apiary.
Dean saw no reason to leave until Sam arrived in Heaven, some hours, days, weeks, or months later. He found out it was happening when one dickbag angel or another beamed a location into his brain and told him to go immediately to receive a new arrival. Dean couldn’t think of anyone else who’d want him as their guide, so he knew it had to be his brother.
That question seemed innocent on the surface, but Dean knew it wasn’t. He hurried toward the door. “I’ll tell you about it later.”
They did. The jokes were objectively terrible, but seeing Dean laugh hysterically at them made Castiel smile, which in turn made Dean think the angel liked the movie. This was the cycle that had led to Dean suggesting bad comedies over and over.
“I’m gonna press down and show you how hard to roll,” Dean said. It was the closest he’d felt to another being in as long as he could remember.
Naomi’s face became hyper-focused for a moment, lost in concentration as she communicated to the other angels. It returned to normal as Castiel removed his hands from his face and let his body relax. Dean helped him to his feet again.
In the blink of an eye, everything went bright again. The screeching sound disappeared, and the brothers stood in what looked like a park. It was as vast as the emptiness, but full of trees and grassy knolls. But park sounds were eerily absent. There was no life. No birds. No polite chatter. Just stone paths winding as far as their eyes could see in every direction, intersecting at random.
“How about an angel?” Dean thought up a hokey, fancy robe-wearing, angel-shaped topper and presented it to Cas, seeking his approval.
Dean let go and glanced over her shoulder into the living room, unable to believe his plan had worked. “Is dad here?”
“You should know better than anyone that angels aren’t equipped to write their own path. We want God’s. We need it. Do you know how many angels are suffering right now? Do you care?”
Dean approached slowly, forcing himself to remain calm for his brother’s sake. Entering Heaven was a frightening event, and he didn’t want to make it any more frightening.
“Pfft.” She gestured that she was over it. “I snuck away. That’s not on you. Plus... No shuffleboard!” She didn’t hesitate to move on. “So here’s the sitch. The shadow orcs are up to their old tricks, and they’ve taken four followers of the Moon prisoner. We have an alliance with the wood elves, for now, to get them back because we have the Tome of Regret that the wood elves need to revive their dead who fell in the Battle of Yonder with the Warriors of Yesteryear—”
Dean had two thoughts simultaneously: one was complete exasperation and the other was how much he adored this dorky, exasperating angel. He ignored both thoughts, and launched the ball again.
Once he was in it, Dean never left the angel’s personal space, not that Castiel had ever really understood personal space as a concept. With Dean so close, Cas could feel a difference in his breathing. It was quicker, sharper. And Dean’s face had flushed. Castiel wasn’t an idiot; he knew what these things normally meant. But Dean Winchester was anything but normal.
Then there was the bunker, with its musty memory foam bed. Not the best by objective standards, but the best Dean had ever slept in. He had treasured it, even when he was awakened by nightmares most nights.
One corner of the room emptied of miscellaneous effects, and a seven-foot-tall balsam fir appeared in their stead, adorned by a glistening gold tree skirt. Dean thought about clear lights, and the tree became festooned with them. A bit lazy on his part, but no one liked stringing up lights. Next, he thought about tree ornaments, and a box of classic, blue and green glass ornaments appeared in his hands. Another box appeared in Castiel’s.
Under the table, Dean balled a fist, as if he could squeeze a confession out of himself if he just pressed hard enough. “It’s something Cas said…”
Castiel listened intently, and Dean watched him with the same enthusiasm. This was all so utterly insignificant, but the angel observed like it was the only thing that mattered. Dean became lost in thought, wondering what it was like to see the universe through Cas’s eyes.
The shadow that controlled the Empty did not like commotion. Nearby, the blackness began swirling upward into a vortex, until it took the shape of a towering, faceless human.
John moved toward Dean, not for a hug, but to go to the fridge and grab two beers. He tossed one to Dean, then cracked open his own and took the seat at the table farthest from his son.
Sam doted on Eileen, and his memories of her, from their first date after her resurrection to their wedding, to reforming the Men of Letters with her and turning it into a powerhouse with its own legion of trained hunters, to raising the other Dean and living out middle and old age with her. Their love was beautiful, and Dean choked back his yearning for anything like it.
“What’s up, bitches?” Charlie, beaming as ever, greeted each of them with a hug. She scanned Cas with wide eyes. “Still hanging onto that vessel, huh?”
For a brief moment, Dean set his hang-ups aside to reach over and touch the angel’s shoulder. A question had been eating at him, and their conversation had finally made it relevant.
As Dean became more and more used to Castiel’s presence, he became more and more comfortable. He actually began to believe that the angel might be there for good. One permanent thing. Maybe—just once—it wouldn’t all come crashing down.
Castiel explained. “For angels, love is devotion. It’s a willingness to sacrifice ourselves for God. When I say that you are a loving person, I mean you show those traits... not to God, but to everyone around you.”
Then… Nothing. The Empty truly was empty. Vast blackness in every direction. Sam and Dean stood on nothing, looking at nothing, bracing themselves for a fight. None came. Human beings were so utterly insignificant to the Empty that it didn’t even register their presence.
Dean took a few steps backward and let himself fall onto the sofa. Cas followed and sat next to him, but not close enough to smother the horrified human.
They both stumbled a bit, but they soon found a rhythm. While Dean looked at everything but the angel’s eyes—the floor, the wall, his watch—Castiel watched him looking away, curious what was going on in Dean’s mind. He was troubled as ever, but still beautiful. Still Dean Winchester.
“My past is... complicated,” Castiel said. “And I lost the only person who could understand it. To be with anyone else would be to maintain a charade.”
, I wouldn’t have tried to get you to visit them.” Sam’s brow furrowed. “I wanted to cut dad some slack because I know I messed up sometimes with Dean… Then I got a little carried away with the grandkids and…”
“Yeah.” Dean surprised himself with his answer, and immediately felt guilty for prioritizing something above his brother. Again.
that. When Jack resurrected the other angels and me from the Empty, I planned to help rebuild Heaven and then… I intended to ask him to remove my grace and let me live as a human.”
” and thought about it for a moment. “I guess… I never really remembered much about my mom when I was younger, but I remembered she made pie once. I was three or four. It could have been the worst pie in the world, and knowing her now…It probably was. Hell, she probably bought it and pretended she made it. But I remember it being comfort food. And, I don’t know, I never really got much comfort after that so… pie.” Dean scrubbed the wistful look from his face. “Your turn. Truth or Dare?”
Sam couldn’t help but notice the frenzied look on his brother’s face. “Did something happen when the Empty took Cas?”
was able to end it. Your ‘son’ may have removed the tools we usually use to get the job done, but... I’ll end it again.”
There was no disappointment in Castiel’s voice, only concern. “You have nothing to apologize for. Just tell me what’s wrong.”
It wasn’t long before Castiel had settled into his new home. And it wasn’t long after that when Dean decided to teach him how to bake a pie.
“He’s never met his grandparents, so we’re all gonna go over to mom and dad’s place.” Sam paused, not sure how his brother would take his suggestion. “You should come.”
In Heaven, Dean could have as much sleep as he wanted, and the nightmares never got him. Dean fluffed his mattress and pillow to his heart’s content and relished it.
The beach. Palm trees, coconuts, little umbrella drinks, feet in the sand. A vacation was something Dean had always wanted but never had. Castiel had never been on one either, unless you counted his time on Earth as a vacation from Heaven. There was an argument to be made for that, but Dean ruled that it did not count.
“It’s good to see you, man,” Dean said. “Uh, since we’re in Heaven...shouldn’t you be ‘the size of the Chrysler Building’ or whatever?”
Baby roared as they bounded down the highway, and Dean was happy to hear her again. This time, she wouldn’t end up parked outside his parents’ house with a shaking, sobbing driver. No, this was what she deserved.
Despite that coming out more bitter than Dean meant it, Castiel acknowledged his history of destruction with a downward glance.
Bobby told Dean he was worried about him, more than once. Dean brushed him off each time. He loved Bobby, but Bobby was not someone Dean felt like confiding in. Not on this one.
Castiel, meanwhile, stood awkwardly under a tree, observing. To most of the people in attendance, he was just some hunter standing around. To most of the people who knew him, he was an angel and would flutter away any moment. Eileen was the only one who knew enough to walk over to him.
“I don’t know if it’ll help to hear this from me, but it’s okay to let yourself be happy,” Charlie said. “Nothing else really matters here. Heaven and all.”
“I said what I said,” Dean groaned. He was uncomfortable enough that he had to tell Sam about any of this at all. He certainly wasn’t going to do a deep dive on every person or creature he’d ever been attracted to. He silently cursed Cas for ever saying anything instead of keeping his feelings repressed where they belonged.
.” Dean’s poker face was fading. He wasn’t sure whether he was going to start crying, start screaming, or start punching something, and he didn’t want to find out. He just wanted peace.
Dean snapped away the plates and pancakes, then stood. “Just, uh… Ground rules since you’re you and I feel like I need to explain this. There are no real weapons. You fight like you’re trying to have fun, not actually trying to kill someone. Can you do that?”
Dean decided to just drive around for a little while and get a feel for the place. He pictured Baby in his mind, and the car appeared in front of him, perfect as ever.
“No.” Dean gently removed Cas’s arm from his shoulder. “You’re not gonna do that to some poor…” He shook his head. “You aren’t the problem. Don’t ever think you’re the problem.”
“It’s not.” Sam roped his brother into a hug. “I’m sorry. I’ve been blathering about seeing Eileen again and planning my life, and I didn’t know...”
Dean shook his head, thinking about how this was the worst cover story ever and hating himself for not just telling the angel that he wanted to see him. “No. It’s weird, right?”
“I’m fine.” The angel, still on the floor, sat up with a pained expression on his face. “I had trouble focusing my way back here through all of the chatter.”
“Yeah, well.” Dean also took a seat. He glanced around the room at empty beer bottles, strewn about. It reminded him of himself, and he grimaced. “Are you… Is everything going okay here?”
“What is your plan?” Castiel asked. “We can’t ignore them forever. I don’t want to, and I know you don’t either.”
“Yes,” Sam said. “I don’t like it, but I don’t have to like it. Besides, Rowena’s in charge. It’s not like Hell’s as bad as it was when you or I went there. He's not in the cage.”
They hadn’t gone beyond kissing yet—Dean had way too many hang-ups for that—but the kissing… The kissing was always nice. Dean reached up and grabbed the back of the angel’s neck, pulling him in harder.
. What’re you two idjits doin’ here? Let me guess. Tryin’ to find a way out of paradise ‘cause it ain’t what you want.”
Castiel’s brow furrowed. He continued conversing with Claire, but kept a suspicious eye on Dean as he walked out the front door.
Inside Dean’s mind, Castiel took a brief trip to El Paso, 1995. Drunken screaming. Pain. Then a decade of the hunter’s life rolled by in quick bursts of disgust and beratement. Castiel absorbed all of the terrible things John Winchester had said and done to his oldest son.
Castiel was left confused as to how someone as lecherous as Dean Winchester could fall asleep during a movie with so much nudity, and why Dean would pick such a movie in the first place. He gave up trying to figure it out. His eyes turned from the horrors on the screen to the beautiful human resting in his lap. He placed a hand on Dean’s shoulder and watched him sleep, hoping that—at least in dreams—Dean’s soul knew peace.
“Then I’d prefer you didn’t.” There was only one Dean Winchester, and another would be a grim reminder of what he’d lost.
Sam also doted on his son. The way he described it, the kid was a supergenius. A true Man of Letters. No surprise there. Dean was interested, but also distracted. He swallowed his inner desires with his beer, just in time to hear all about his nephew’s house, wife, and family. About the time they’d all gone on vacation together to Mexico. One enormous, happy family.
The flickering intensified, but again returned to the park and the bench. Dean’s eyes watered as he stared at dream Castiel’s blank expression, with eyes that had none of their signature compassion.
Castiel shook his head. “Do you know what it’s like to have thousands of voices in your head disparaging you?”
“Dean, you don’t have to make this about mom or anyone else for it to matter. What he did to you is enough.”
Dean lied and told himself he wasn’t just inventing an excuse to touch Cas. He told himself it was all about the crust, which to be fair, turned out great. They eased it into the pie tin, filled it, and began crimping the top crust.
“Don’t be.” Dean let go of his angel’s hand and walked over to John, still crumpled on the floor. He looked down at his bloodied father and sneered. “
Sam blinked rapidly, as if trying to clear his vision. He and Castiel had grown old, together. “You’re so young.”
“So why is it like this? Why aren’t we happy?” Dean took another drink. “Shit, you could have just made me sleep forever.”
It was such a simple question, without a simple answer. Dean stared at him for a long moment before he finally gave in and spoke. “You remember I told you about my friend Lee?”
Sam shook his head, trying yet again to come up with a way to get through to his brother. After a moment, he took a different angle.
Dean clawed at every bit of the angel he could reach, wanting nothing more than to feel every bit of him. He told himself he could do this, like it was some final obstacle to fixing himself. One act to wash away decades’ worth of trauma and repression.
“This is hard.” Jack frowned. “I hope the dungeon gives them time to think. I don’t want to leave them there forever. I want them to be happy.”
Castiel tilted his head. “Don’t mistake my calmness for indifference, Sam. I lived for four hundred million years before I met your brother. I gave everything for the
“When I took your father there, I realized I couldn’t hear the angels in Hell. I was enjoying the reprieve.” He stopped, then added, “Rowena said to say hello.”
sleep forever if you want.” Castiel took a seat in the second, unworn recliner. His face softened slightly as he looked toward Dean. “It’s like this because you taught me that freedom is preferable to peace, and I still believe it.”
The siren came closer and closer, but not close enough. Its sound faded, along with every other sound.
Castiel untied his apron. He didn’t have to say anything to let Dean know he was coming with him. They rushed out the door and hopped into the Impala. They did that a lot, usually to cruise nowhere and enjoy each other’s company. Their drives hadn’t had an urgent purpose since they were on Earth together, and it showed in how fast Dean drove.
Dean lifted a lamp from a table, ready to smash it like he had everything else. But he observed the wreckage he’d been taught to make and stopped. He didn’t want splintered chairs strewn across the floor. He didn’t want broken glass under his feet. He didn’t want the life John had raised him for.
Bobby looked him in the eyes. “Are you? No one’s seen you around. Maybe Charlie, but she was real tight-lipped about it.”
With every other line, Dean would look down in embarrassment, then back up so he could see Cas. When he’d finished singing, he prompted the angel again. “Truth or Dare?”
It wasn’t the first time Dean convinced Castiel to put on a cowboy hat, but it was the first time they went horseback riding together. In Heaven, the area surrounding the bunker was whatever they wanted it to be. Dean wanted a trail: a dirt path through scenic forest, lined with sprawling oaks. And so it was.
Dean wondered if he was that obviously attached. He shrugged, and jabbed at his brother. “Good to see you too, Sammy. Nice hug.”
The idea was to show Dean how many people cared about him. Sam put some calls out into the universe and very few souls turned down the invite. At the Roadhouse, almost everyone Dean had ever befriended showed up for a raucous gathering. They didn’t make a big show of who it was for. Dean would have hated that. Their presence was enough.
Castiel reached up and touched the side of Dean’s face. The lights on the tree twinkled in the reflection of his damp eyes.
.” Sam gave his signature look of disappointment. “Have you been sitting around waiting for me to show up so we could relive your glory days?”
Dean reseated himself with a spell book, planted a kiss on Castiel’s cheek, and took a look around the room at the life he’d always wanted. It was his, and no one could take it away.
“Well... if you’re gonna pray and not get a response, maybe it should be to someone you need to talk to?”
. It was no one’s fault. I want you to grasp that things can go wrong and it not be anyone’s fault. That’s life. All we can do is work with what’s already happened and try to do better.”
Dean went into crisis mode, began rambling, and revealed more about himself than he intended. “You’re right. It’s not different, and I’m not trying to be controlling. I just, uh… I like spending time with you and I’m not trying to rush through it.”
Before they’d stepped even a few paces forward, a barrage of rubber-tipped arrows flew toward them, bouncing off their armor.
Dean caught himself noticing how perfectly the plates fell on the angel’s shoulders, and dodged eye contact. “Yeah. Yeah.
Castiel stood. “Yes. Things created here resonate with me in a way Earthly ones don’t. It takes some concentration to understand the flavor as a whole, but—”
Dean did. “He's in the Empty because I stood there like an idiot. He told me he loved me and I didn't say anything. I gotta get him back, Sam. If he knew...” Dean avoided saying the part about loving Castiel, and wiped more tears away. “He wouldn’t have chosen to stay there if he knew...”
Hearing that Jack was as kind as ever softened Dean’s demeanor. He stepped toward him. “You know you’re welcome here any time, right? You don’t have to wait for one of us to pray.”
“I like to think there’s something out there that can surprise Jack. He deserves that. I can’t imagine the loneliness of knowing everything...”
. Something Castiel hadn’t felt in some time. He and Sam landed on opposite ends of the barn with a thud.
“It means my life is immeasurably better for having you in it. It means I would give anything to keep you in it, and that I put you before all others.” Castiel smiled, then let out an amused snort. “It means I’m a terrible angel.”
Dean had been completely convinced that Cas was about to call him out on his half-flirty bullshit. When he didn’t, Dean’s expression and tone drifted toward confusion. “What?”
“Knocked some…?” Dean’s voice rose into a scream. “You broke seven of my ribs and shoved a broom handle down my throat. I told Sam a werewolf attacked me and
“You can’t drive me away. I’m not a person. But even if I were… that’s not who you are. I told you...”
Castiel frowned. He considered flying over to the Winchester residence, grabbing John Winchester, and throwing him back into the pit where he belonged. But he knew Dean wouldn’t go for that, so he listened.
Dean eyed Cas, who was halfway through a PB&J and had managed to drip jelly down the front of his trenchcoat. Completely ridiculous, but devastatingly charming just the same.
Dean noticed, and he was about to say something when Cas cut him off by kissing his neck, repeatedly, up to his ear. In lieu of words, Dean let out a sharp breath. Cas dragged his teeth across Dean’s earlobe as he moved toward his mouth. Their lips touched, and then their tongues.
Bobby half-shrugged. “You go to Hell, you have a few orgies, you become a demon. Then you either don’t care that you’re in Hell or you pop up on Earth, get ganked, go to the Empty and sleep forever. Could be worse.”
“Well, I don’t quite know the deal with angels, but I’m guessing Sam’s alive. As for you... You’re in Heaven, Dean.”
“Whenever you want to sleep, and whenever you want to celebrate.” Castiel scored again. “I don’t understand why this is such a challenging concept.”
“Oh, and uh…” Dean snapped his fingers, and they were both in aprons, Castiel’s tied awkwardly around the trench coat he never took off.
Sam’s voice dripped with sarcasm. “Yeah, okay.” He changed his tone and looked directly into his brother’s eyes. “We won, Dean.”
He jerked suddenly to the side and fell off the chair. Dean caught him and dropped to the floor, keeping his arms wrapped around him. The angel rocked back and forth slightly, digging his fingers into the sides of his head all the while.
Dean couldn’t respond with “nothing,” because that would seem absolutely pathetic. But his reply wasn’t much better.  “Uh, you know. Drinking beer and watching movies and… whatnot.”
Their eyes were closed, mostly, but they met briefly and Dean saw that Cas’s were glowing white. He gasped a little, in awe.
“Well, supposedly God created everything and I’ve seen it all, as far as life goes. There was never any reason to visit the parts of the universe with nothing in them.”
Dean looked up at nothing in particular. The stars swirled in the sky, as they always did in Heaven, but the novelty had worn off. He took a deep breath.
Time didn’t make any sense in Heaven, but eventually enough of it passed that Dean was ready to face his friends in the Roadhouse. When he did, he discovered that none of them had held a grudge. There were no grudges to hold, since they’d all made it here.
Castiel had felt young Dean’s pain and fear, and he felt it needed to be returned. John was already dead, of course. Cas couldn’t kill him. But he could batter his soul until it begged to be returned to Hell where it belonged.
. If Bobby can get in here, anyone can get in here. If anyone can get in here…” He trailed off, not wanting to think about it. His brain didn’t care. It taunted him with the fact that the bunker—the little spot in Heaven he’d claimed for himself—didn’t belong to him at all. It also registered the words Cas had just said to him, in horror.
“I know I haven’t been here, and Cas is in the Empty, but you still should have been able to find something to live for. It’s the after
“Cas, let’s just go,” Dean said, tugging him toward the door. Avoidance was another fine coping mechanism, in his mind.
“Then what’s wrong with you?” Sam asked. “When we were alive, you wanted to see mom and dad forever—”
That hit hard, even if the premise that led to it was a lie. Dean, hoisted by his own petard,  responded only with a sad look.
“I didn’t have a plan.” Dean, annoyed by Sam’s prodding, stopped walking and turned to his brother. “Look. I thought it was stupid. I thought
“Shut up,” Charlie said. “You got the point. Nothing’s guaranteed. You could have something good, so have it.”
There on his porch stood Castiel, just as he remembered him, trenchcoat and all. Castiel looked up into Dean’s eyes.
“I know you do. No offense, Dean, but you’ve said that before. And then you kicked me out on the street when I was newly human and confused and most needed your help.”
The angel scoffed. “I think it’s more likely that neither bees nor angels can properly feel anything. They may be better off with a set purpose.”
“Ash figured out how to hack into anyone’s shelter. Nice place, by the way. I figured I’d come check in. You know, make sure you hadn’t found a way to
“Just trust me. If Cas told Jack he wants to stay in the Empty, there’s something forcing him to say that. Or it wasn’t really Cas. Or… something. It’s
He wondered at what point it would be awkward that he’d waited so long, and if he’d already passed that point. Eventually, he took his thoughts to their logical conclusion: Fuck it. Time was fluid. He could pretend he’d only been there a few minutes and he hadn’t been dodging the best friend he’d ever had. Or
“So the universe would be fine if he himself didn’t have it for a bit. If there were something we could hold his power in for just a little while…”
“Sorry. Like I said, there’s a lot to fix. And the angels will not stop talking.” Jack stared at Castiel, and snapped his fingers again. “There. That should be better.”
With three words repeating over and over in his mind, tears fell from Dean’s eyes. “I can’t do it. I'm barely keeping it together right now… Just… Stay here. Please. I’m about to lose it counting the damn walls in this place. Can you just… stay?”
With formalities out of the way, the brothers stepped into the Roadhouse, to grab drinks and discuss Sam’s life. It wasn’t overly crowded, but there were always a few souls inside. It was an essential stop for those who traveled Heaven by road. That’s the way the Harvelles liked it. Meeting people, serving drinks. The family business.
Thus began the very first Deanmas. With a thought, the Dean Cave had a window with a perfect view of falling snow. It didn’t make sense, given that the bunker was underground, but it didn’t have to. A roaring fireplace appeared beneath the television, with two red stockings hanging from its mantel.
that were awful…” He trailed off, trying not to dredge up more reasons to hate himself. “What you said before I died made me want to change that, so… Just… Believe me if I compliment you, okay?”
“Huh?” Dean blinked a few times, refocusing on the road and trying to figure out how far he’d driven. It didn’t work. He had no clue.
In Dean’s mind, Jack’s words played on repeat. Louder than the Led Zeppelin song on the radio. Louder than Miracle’s occasional bark from the backseat. Louder than anything his brother had said in the last ten minutes.
Contrary to popular belief, Dean loved reading. He just never had time for reading much of anything but lore until now. He and Castiel had started a book club of sorts, but even if Metatron hadn’t bestowed knowledge of a book to Castiel, it took the angel almost no time to read one in its entirety. So he had a habit of interrupting Dean when it was “taking forever” for him to finish something. He strode into the bunker’s library with purpose.
Mary pulled away from the embrace. “The toddler defeated Chuck and saved the world.” She gestured into the dining room. “Now come in.”
“...Yeah.” Dean swallowed and took a quick breath. “We met when I was fifteen. Went on a bunch of hunts together. Hell, he was practically part of the family for a while there...”
From above came a whooshing sound. Dean caught a brief glimpse of black, swirling tendrils—the same ones that had taken Cas—and shut his eyes. There was a cold, surprisingly metallic touch on his exposed arm and within seconds he felt himself become engulfed.
Sam could barely contain his glee as he scooted his chair backward and rose to his feet. Around the table, Eileen, Mary, Dean, and Jack did the same.
Dean reached his right hand toward Castiel’s left. Their fingers came together with ease, like they were meant to be entwined. The same electricity he’d felt when they were making pie made its way up Dean’s arm. He guided Cas’s other arm to his side, and placed his own arm around the angel’s waist. This he didn’t have to explain. This he could just do.
Dean didn’t agree with that assessment at all. “Maybe if bees were free, they’d learn to love. Maybe that would be their purpose?”
“I love you.” Dean leaned into Castiel’s chest, and muttered through sobs. Now that he’d said it, he couldn’t stop, even as it put his stomach in knots. “I love you, man.”
isn’t the worst part. The worst is… he didn’t regret it. At all. If he could have just been happy for me. If he could have just… acted like he loved me, for once. If he could have apologized—”
Dean had always imagined his Heaven would involve being slapped around by a woman in a zorro mask, but this was decidedly better. He instinctively moved his hips and pressed into Cas, which served as his first-hand confirmation that angels were not, in fact, junkless. Dean disregarded how ravenous he felt, and pulled back to ease the tension with a joke.
Those words resonated with Dean, who’d been starving his entire life. Not for food, though there were definitely times he’d gone without. For something else. He looked at Cas longingly, then sadly. “Cas—”
The brothers posted up and spent the next hour getting things just right. Circle of archaic symbols scratched into the dirt? Check. Vial of Jack’s blood ready to be smashed in the center of it? Check. Castiel’s old trenchcoat to tune the spell to him? Check. Ominously large leather-bound book containing the spell? Check. A spare vial of blood and some handwritten notes in their pockets for the return trip? Check.
“You didn’t tell me anything.” Sam reached for his brother’s shoulder, forcing him to meet his eyes. They were glistening with tears. “
Castiel turned away from the stars and toward his human. “That’s a nice thought. But if the other Castiels didn’t rebel, they probably don’t have you. I do believe you’re the one who brought that out of me.”
“Nothing against any of you, but this place isn’t paradise for me yet.” He pulled his keys from his pocket and walked out the door. On the way, he turned to Bobby. “I’m gonna go home and rest. Let me know when Cas or Sam gets here.”
Dean cut him off. “No. There’s no excuse. I was an obsessed bastard about keeping Sam safe, and I didn’t even think about you. You never needed me before, and I told myself you could handle it.”
Castiel approached and placed a hand on the shoulder where his handprint once lingered. “I don’t understand it. You are
Castiel put an arm on Dean’s shoulder. “I’ve guessed that my form is a problem. I can find a new vessel if—”
“I know I can.” Dean finally faced him. “I know. And I trust you. Believe me, I do. But I try to put the words together and it’s like being impaled on some fucking rebar, which… if you’ve never done it…it sucks.”
“I’ve seen you in love before,” Sam said. “It’s been forever, but yeah. I didn’t put it together because it’s Cas, but…” His memory recalled a decade’s worth of long glances, strangely close touches. They weren’t just on Castiel’s part. He’d seen Dean staring at that angel like he was a piece of pie. “...You
There was no practical reason to use phones in Heaven, but many found telepathy awkward and used whatever means with which they were familiar. For Dean, soul-to-soul communication manifested in his cell phone. There were no cell towers, obviously, so they were still communicating telepathically, but this way felt… normal.
Most days at the bunker—if you could call them days—began with Dean asking a question. Nothing serious that would make him deal with his feelings, of course. No. It was always something about an experience he and Cas could share now that the sky was quite literally the limit.
He lied, of course. His thoughts drifted. The TV in front of him was the one he, Sam, and Cas had used to visit the world of
“Are you okay?” Dean asked, shifting. “You look like you’re gonna either bend me over the counter or murder me.”
“I’m bad at Heaven,” he said. “I’ve only ever done things for other people. Even if I know what I want, I never let myself have it. I make everything a mission. You remember when I spent a year with Lisa and Ben… It wasn’t me being happy. It was me pretending to be happy because I told Sam I would.” Dean swallowed. “I need you to know that’s not what this is.”
. You heard Jack. He brought everyone back. The monsters are gone. We finally get to live real lives. This is huge.”
Castiel walked over to the counter and stood across from Dean. He slumped forward and looked into the hunter’s eyes, heartbroken. “Dean. Stop.”
“Oh, it’s real.” Dean grinned. “It’s very real. Charlie just texted me about an event going on right now.”
“If this were about the pie, I could just imagine a pie. No. It’s about the process. We’re making this thing
Dean nodded, uneasy. “But I kept thinking about things he said over the years—I mean, I’m still thinking about them—and then I started thinking about mom, stuck with him forever, listening to...”
“You’re concerned now?” Castiel squinted and unleashed drunken, unhinged sass. “Are you sure there isn’t something else I can help you with?”
Dean thought hard about Charlie, the sister he’d always wanted, and suddenly he and Castiel stood in the loud, nerdy camps of Moondoor.
, while Castiel’s was modeled after an actual horse he once met in 12th century France. There was nothing special about that horse, but he’d enjoyed its company.
Some time after making his eighth mark on the wall, with no concept of how long he’d be waiting for his brother, Dean made the decision to visit his parents’ house, the one that once stood in Lawrence. It now stood, like everything else, exactly as far away as he wanted. For now, that was a short drive.
“Okay…” Mary eyed her son with suspicion. Dean had tensed up and sat rigid in his seat, an unfamiliar look on his face. Nervousness maybe, or fear? In appearance, Dean looked every bit the middle-aged man he’d died as, but in that moment he had the posture of a guilty teenager.
“You’re really gonna make me spell this out for you, huh?” Dean silently cursed his brother for making him put his thoughts into words. “He said I was the one thing he wanted but could never have…” Dean couldn’t hold back his tears any longer.
“I started thinking about how many animals’ eggs are edible and, well—” He opened the refrigerator doors wide so Dean could see that the inside was filled with eggs from chickens, ducks, ostriches, turtles, and fish.
Dean tried to delay the impending conversation with small talk. “This is a, uh… nice house you have here.”
Castiel pulled a perfectly formed, thornless red rose from behind his back. He outstretched his arm to hand it over.
“Yeah. I have for a while now.” Sam dropped the gloves and stood to walk toward his brother. “What’s wrong? Where’s Cas?”
The air around Dean lost its energy. He heard the flapping of wings, but spoke as if his angel were still there. “Cas, I didn’t mean—”
Dean tried to stay, but it wasn’t up to willpower. He could see the end, so he said what he needed to. “You’re… gonna be okay… Take care of each other.”
A few hours later, the Winchesters were walking through a corn field carrying duffel bags full of spellcasting supplies. Dean had been preparing for this spell since the first time Castiel went to the Empty. It was reckless, dangerous, and he was lucky he never had to use it. But he did now. He powered forward.
For when he wasn’t away, Dean imagined a home for himself, and it became reality. It was small, with just enough room for two, but for someone who spent half his life living out of shady motel rooms, it was perfect. One day, while he sat on the porch drinking a beer, he heard panting in the distance. Then he saw a furry figure scampering up the road. Within moments, he was bent down hugging Miracle and scratching his ears. “Good boy. You’re home now.”
They could have simply appeared on any of Heaven’s beaches—or generated one in their backyard for that matter—but that lacked the pizzazz of a true beach vacation. Dean loaded the Impala with an umbrella, beach towels, and a cooler full of road food, and they set off.
Dean found that annoying and charming at once. He watched Cas watching him, anticipating an answer, and he felt compelled to give one. “My family. My
“I don’t know if you’re listening, Jack… But I need help, and you sort of… know everything. I know it’s not fair to put this on you. It wasn’t fair to put being God on you in the first place. But if you’re listening, and you can get here…”
Some anonymous angel told him where to go. The destination was a bridge that looked familiar, but Dean couldn’t place it. Until he saw Sam standing there, a shadowy, freakishly tall figure in the middle of the bridge, staring down off the edge. It was from a case. The first case that took Sam away from Stanford and led him on a fifteen year journey with his brother.
“Look at them.” Castiel gestured to the thousands of bees crawling across the frame. “They each understand their purpose. With an almost inconsequential lifespan, they divide their labor to create a deeply complex society.”
filled Dean’s head. It hadn’t happened very often, but he recognized it as an incoming message from an angel. Sam was on his way, and he needed a guide. He pulled away from Castiel and turned toward the door.
By reflex, Dean smiled, then stopped himself, as if Sam would catch him from the other end of the line.
Even more than that, he liked the plausible deniability of using his own collection. If he chose from any song that had ever existed, he’d choose a song that made him think of Cas, and then he’d have to explain why. Then there was the distinct possibility that it would end up being a Taylor Swift song. No. That wasn’t happening.
With their happy reunion at its conclusion, Team Free Will moved on to doing what they did best: getting into and—hopefully—out of trouble. After all, what was free will without a little risk?
The angel was dressed similarly to Dean, in beach-ready shorts, a plain t-shirt, and sandals. He squinted. “And this is the look you prefer me in?”
Someone even drunker than Dean turned the Roadhouse into a karaoke bar, and if there was one thing an intoxicated hunter couldn’t pass up it was karaoke.
“So he lived for forty eight years without you, plus the year you were in Hell, plus the year he was in Hell, plus the year we were in Purgatory, plus the four years he was at Stanford…” Castiel pretended to count on his fingers to get his point across. “That’s thirty years with you and fifty-five without—”
The angel disappeared, and Dean threw his beer bottle to the ground, where it shattered into pieces. He looked around for something else to break, then remembered one of Heaven’s perks. He willed another bottle into his hand and slammed it to the ground like the first. Then another. Then another. It wasn’t nearly as cathartic as he’d hoped.
Dean broke away and crossed his arms. Every bit of suffering Cas had endured thanks to the angels was his fault, and the guilt of that overwhelmed him into a confession—
He placed the rolling pin on it, then guided Castiel’s hands to either side. He then put his own hands over the angel’s. Dean tried to ignore the electric feeling when they touched. He’d touched Castiel’s hands before, but it had always been in some dangerous scenario or another. This was different. It was comfortable. It didn’t hurt that Cas was literally touching his soul.
Dean had never spoken about this to anyone. There was no one in the universe it would be easier to speak it to than Cas, but Dean still paused to secure his resolve. “One time... my dad was on a hunt, so Lee and I went back to dad’s hotel room. I mean, Sam was twelve. I wasn’t gonna bring him back to the room with my little brother in it...”
Dean let go of the handles and threw his hands up in exhaustion. “Because I wanna know how long you’ve been here.”
Dean had the eyes of someone barely keeping himself together. He looked straight through his brother as he spoke.
It was at that moment—commiserating with a kaiju over abandonment issues—that Dean realized just how bad a place he was in. He berated himself in his thoughts. This wasn’t even a chick flick, and he was crying. Crying. Over Battra.
“Yeah, he wasn’t. But it’s more about… This could never be Heaven for me as long as he was here. I’ve been terrified that he’d find out and—”
From a tight corner of the Roadhouse porch, Dean cursed Taylor Swift’s name. He remembered being strung up and tortured by Alastair. He remembered torturing others. Now he tortured himself, his mind recalling the handful of good memories he had of his father and telling him that he was the worst son in the world. No matter what anyone said, he was supposed to protect his family.
“No.” John looked toward the table and acknowledged Dean’s presence with a slight nod. “You’re already dead, huh? Well, hopefully your brother is doing something with his life.”
“Look, I know he can’t do anything to me now. I know that. But it messed me up, bad. I buried a part of myself, and it wasn’t a problem. And then I met you, and...it was.” Even in his moment of honesty, Dean couldn’t explain exactly what he felt. “You mean a lot to me, and it brings all that crap back.”
They started down the stone path. Any direction was as good as any other, so they just picked one. As they walked, the Winchesters noticed that even their footsteps didn’t make a sound.
Dean hung up. A dick move, sure, but he had eternity to apologize. For now, he wasn’t going anywhere. He had too much to figure out, and being around his family wouldn’t help.
Castiel, unsure what he’d done to make Dean cry, pulled him in close for a tight embrace. He needed the hunter to know that—no matter what—he was safe and loved. He felt Dean’s desperate fingers digging into his back, forcing him to stay.
“—As for sex...If that’s something you’re ready for, yes. Absolutely. But if you’re pushing yourself because you’ve set expectations and you think you have something to prove… You don't. There’s nothing you
“What you did eats at you. I want you to forgive yourself for it, and for anything you’ve ever done that makes you feel that same way. Because—whether you want to believe it or not—you always did your best.”
Castiel snapped a finger and the apples’ peels disappeared from existence. He knew that would get a rise out of Dean, and that’s precisely why he did it.
When Cas was in range, Dean grabbed the angel’s arm and pulled him close. He spoke softly, almost at a whisper. “Don’t leave me like that. If something happened to you…” He trailed off.
difficult. Hearing their voices at all times. Lying next to you, but being unable to rest.” Castiel stared at one bee in particular. “I just want you to understand why I come here to think.”
Dean put a hand on Castiel’s shoulder. “Are you okay? You’re getting a little deep in the bee metaphors. Is this whole thing… not doing it for you?”
The world around them flickered between the park and total darkness, but returned to the park. That seemed to answer Sam’s question in the affirmative.
“Your folks are around. They don’t live too far from here. I don’t know they’ll be thrilled seeing you get here so soon, but they’ll surely wanna see you.”
“I forgave you a long time ago. Were you listening when I confessed to you?” Castiel had tried to absolve Dean. Clearly it hadn’t worked.
great.” A dough had come together, so Dean reached for some plastic wrap. “Now we’ll just pat that into a disc and toss it in the fridge, which I would like Heaven to have cleared of weird eggs.” He enunciated the last part clearly, as if Heaven needed to hear him. Like magic, the fridge had plenty of room. Dean placed the dough inside and turned to Cas.
Option One: Listen to his brother and his angel. Accept that John was supposed to go to Hell and that an error had been corrected. He knew it was what he should do, but this option involved not holding onto shame and guilt. It seemed impossible.
Sam, Eileen, and their kids moved out of the bunker and into a farmhouse a few miles down the road. Castiel needed the bunker space for another purpose: fostering as many children as he could. He’d known what it was like to live with no guidance, and what Dean went through with abuse and neglect. So he filled the bunker with wayward sons and daughters and showed them all the love he could.
Five years to the day after Dean’s death, Sam heard glass shattering in Castiel’s room. He heard shouting. Eileen saw the fear on little Bobby and Maura’s faces.
“You mean on another planet?” Castiel wondered. “No. I’ve been to Heaven, Hell, Earth, Purgatory, and the Empty.”
From then on, when Dean went to visit Mary, his father was always away. He didn’t know whether it was John’s doing or support from Jack’s angels, but either way it was a relief.
There it was. This, Dean reminded himself, was why he’d wanted to stay in the bunker in the first place. There, he could control his words. Cas wouldn’t push him on this. Other people presented variables like... this. He silently cursed Charlie's name.
It suddenly struck Dean. The enormity of an actual cosmic being—one with this much power, who had existed since creation and had seen stars form and burn out—falling from Heaven and directing its energy into baking and decorating trees with him. Into
He’d rearranged a table in the bunker to seat six. On one side, he sat next to Cas. Across from them sat Sam and Eileen. At either head of the table sat Mary and Jack. There would be more gatherings, with more family and friends, but following the last few years of his life, he needed this one in particular.
Sam nodded. “Right. But what if you created a new universe that didn’t have anyone who’d try to steal it…”
. Even when there’s no reason you should. Even when there are countless reasons you shouldn’t. You care what happens to everyone. That’s not a flaw. It’s why I love you. But what is a flaw is thinking you need to
Dean’s intentions weren’t the only thing Castiel questioned. The former hunter’s taste in movies was deeply, deeply concerning. The angel knew this, having endured hundreds of movie nights at the bunker on Earth. He’d seen
Dean was in love. He knew it, and he hated everything about it—especially himself. He didn’t know what else to do but hate it. There were two options again: sit there and suffer, or try talking through it. He took the first option for a long while.
“We’re not doing worried.” Dean grabbed Cas by the trenchcoat and tugged him toward the microphone. Out of nowhere, a cowboy hat appeared on Dean’s head as he slurred his words. “You ever sang a duet? I haven’t since I was a demon and...you’re a lot cuter than Crowley.”
“Or nothing…” Dean hadn’t meant that as a threat. He softly shook his head. “I’m not mad at you either.” He sighed. “I’m sorry I didn’t talk to you sooner. I’m sorry I made up some bullshit story to—”
Dean’s voice was soft and raspy as he struggled to breathe. “It’s okay.” He reached a hand up to Cas’s and their fingers became entwined.
Castiel reached out, grabbed Dean’s beer-holding arm, and pressed it to the counter. His eyes flashed white. “Stop.”
For the longest while, they simply relaxed. Side by side, they leaned into one another, with Dean keeping one arm draped across the angel’s shoulder.
“Yeah. I wanted to see you.” Knots began forming in Dean’s stomach as he even considered discussing the elephant in the room. “It’s just—”
“After what—” Sam resisted the urge to smack his older brother. “After what you told me happened in the bunker with the Empty, you think maybe he’d like a follow-up?”
“Yeah. You’re doing it right,” Dean said. “I’m just thinking.” He already knew his answer, but it seemed so damn pathetic. It wasn’t his father. John Winchester couldn’t do a damn thing to him here. But he knew someone else could hurt him, deeply.
“I don’t think so,” Castiel said. He looked up at Dean from the bed, where he sat rubbing his fingers to his temples.
“I’m teasing. I like you in everything. If you’re talking about what gets me going, though, it’s the medieval armor. By far.”
The figure was unmistakable, but it didn’t reply. Castiel sat, watching silent waves in a silent lake.
Castiel continued speaking through his thoughts. “Maybe I deserve unhappiness for what I did to Heaven. I can’t think of anything you did to deserve eternal sorrow, but…”
Dean recognized the breadth of life Sam had lived without him. He also saw his escape route. He rose slowly from his seat and walked toward Sam and Eileen. “Hey.” Dean threw on his charming facade and greeted Eileen with a hug. “I’ll, uh… leave you two to take advantage of… well, of each other.”
He wasn’t sure exactly what he was going to say, but he didn’t get the chance. At that moment, the phone in his pocket began vibrating, and he was saved by his generic classic rock ringtone.
“Chuck said I’m the only Castiel who rebelled. I somehow doubt the others are reacting well to a nephilim seizing Heaven.”
“Treachery!” Charlie made her voice as dramatic as she could. “Only elves can wield bows with such accuracy. Ack!”
“I haven’t heard from you in a while and I wanted to make sure you’re okay. Bobby said you were on a ‘spa retreat,’ which sounds a lot like a lie you’d tell him to say.”
When he was safely inside the Impala, Dean fell back into the seat, hard. He let out a deep, uneasy breath. He reached for the steering wheel, his hands shaking.
Everyone showed up. Eileen, Jody, Donna, Charlie, Garth and his children... In all, there were probably a hundred hunters, some of whom the Winchesters had only met once. But Dean had made an impact on all of them.
In Dean’s mind, flashes of his childhood went by. Every time his father had destroyed a hotel room because his sons disobeyed him. Every time he’d drank too much and hit one of them. It was nearly always Dean. Dean had made sure of it.
“Neither do I,” Sam said. “But you mean a hell of a lot more to me than dad does. And he did sell his soul to a demon, so going to Hell isn’t exactly out of pocket...”
“I love you, Cas, okay? I love you.” Dean spoke as if the world was ending, with tears falling from his eyes. “I should have told you on Earth, but I stopped myself. I didn’t say it, and then you were gone...And now you’re here, but I keep stopping myself and... I don’t want to anymore. You’re it for me, okay?”
The response was piercing, high-frequency noise from above. Dean covered his ears and looked up. Castiel was, as he’d once said, the size of a skyscraper, though the Chrysler Building may have been a bit of an exaggeration. Dean could barely make out a figure within the brightness. From what he could gather, Castiel was vaguely human-shaped, but faceless, with wings that seemed to go on for miles. More than two. Four? Six? For a brief flash, he thought he saw hundreds of eyes blinking at once.
Dean’s mind replayed Cas, Charlie, Bobby, Mary, and now Sam all telling him he deserved good things. It replayed him telling his father the same. He tried hard to believe it again.
John shook his head. “Well, it has to happen to everyone eventually. But I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t disappointed.”
“I put her in the dungeon. You didn’t think I’d…” Jack’s eyes narrowed, and he spoke with assurance. “I wouldn’t.”
In his own piece of Heaven, Dean awoke from a long rest to a knock at his door. He rubbed his eyes, swept a hand through his hair, and wandered over, still in pajamas.
“Uh…” Dean panicked and drummed up an excuse on the spot. A stupid one. “I think something might be wrong with Sam.”
To their left, the forest was thick with trees and brush, shaded by its own stature. To their right, the trees were sparse, replaced by fields of flowers on a gentle slope leading to a small lake. Beyond the lake stood snow-capped mountains, hit by the sun at just the right angle to make them glimmer. Both men’s gazes drifted from side to side, absorbing the calming views.
At first, Dean left hash marks on his bedroom wall. Deep scratches that broke through paint and hit drywall. One scar for each day. But he soon found that what had been a day for him could have been an hour, week, month, year, or decade for someone else. Time in Heaven was that fluid.
“Well, apparently we missed our own coming out party…” Dean blinked as he registered the angel’s words. “Wait… Why did you go back to Hell?”
Dean imagined himself as his father in those memories. He saw himself yelling at Jack, telling him he wasn’t family. Everything he hated about himself was still there. He’d hurt Cas. Again. Cas, who’d told Dean that his greatest fear was being unwanted. Dean had told him he was a burden. He began to cry, even as he continued his wave of destruction.
“Angels can’t harm souls that belong in Heaven,” Naomi said. “Believe me, it would be a lot easier to convince Castiel if I could hurt you.”
Naomi sighed. “Do you know how many times you’ve ‘fallen in love’ with one of them? You don’t, because every single time we were able to end it.
Dean defensively raised his voice. “So what if I have? There’s no monsters to fight up here. What the hell else am I supposed to do?”
Dean was no melittologist, but he tried to connect the dots and ask about his angel in bee terms. “You think...
“Maybe. Everyone gets one, though, so here.” He handed Castiel his half-full glass, while he took a swig from the bottle.
Castiel thought for a moment. “I did before I actually met God… Chuck. Now I like to believe there’s more. We know there are alternate universes, after all. And I...”
“I’m not sure, I…” Sam tried putting everything together. “You’re not thinking it’s your fault, are you? It sounds like he said his piece and now he’s content.”
Loud cursing came from the corner where Bobby and Rufus stood playing pool. Ash provided color commentary as Jody and Donna looked on, eating cake.
Dean looked down at the ground and shook his head, then looked back up at the earnest angel. Cas hadn’t budged. Part of Dean wanted to extend this standoff, but another part was as flattered as it was flabbergasted.
“I love you both. I have to go, though. I have like a million more angels to deal with.” He waved. “Have some great sex.”
Her voice broke, and she pulled back. “It does. When we were alive… All those times I spoke about missing John and—”
“No, but I would have forgiven him,” Dean said. “And I wouldn’t be here feeling like shit for sending my own father to Hell.”
Dean eyed the tree and began carefully placing ornaments, spacing them apart and making sure to put some around the back.
“So you’re just gonna avoid your best friend for eternity because you don’t want to deal with a few minutes of awkward conversation?”
Charlie snapped her fingers, and Dean and Cas became decked out in plate armor. In their hands appeared padded broadswords.
“You don’t think you deserve to be saved?” Dean stepped in closer. “I’m here about what you said before this thing took you...”
In Heaven, Dean was uncomfortable. He wanted to see everyone in the roadhouse, for sure, but he wasn’t sure that he could. A Greatest Hits compilation of people who died because of him? Awful. And then there were his parents. He thought he should visit them first, but also thought about what questions John would have and how the hell he was going to answer them without mentioning Cas. And why shouldn’t he mention Cas?
Dean took a deep breath. “You know, I resented you most of my life. I mean, I loved you and I missed you. But you got to be dead. You got to be free. Now it turns out death doesn’t change anything.”
Sam dropped to the ground next to his brother and put a hand on his shoulder. “An ambulance is on its way. You’re gonna make it.”
“Perhaps.” Castiel paused. “Perhaps freedom is a length of rope, and love is what keeps you from hanging yourself with it.”
Sleep had been a luxury on Earth, something Dean could never seem to get enough of. Even when he was a child, he’d made do with four hours in a creaky hotel bed with flat pillows. He had to. He’d complained about it once—he was eight, maybe—and it didn’t end well.
Just outside the front door, Dean stood clenching his fists, willing himself to go inside. The light emitted by an injured angel was unmistakable, and it was the final push he needed.
failed to solve, never stop blaming myself for anything I couldn’t fix. And now that I’m dead, I finally have a chance to live and I can’t because you taught me—if I fell in love with the wrong person, you’d kill me. Everything I hate about myself comes from you.”
“That’s him?” John wondered. He looked at the angel with hatred. “Who the hell do you think you are barging in here—”
“Well… I’m trying to let the angels have free will. Most of them just want to stay here and help souls, which is great. We need that. Some of them want to go live on Earth and that’s fine. But some of them keep trying to start wars and enforce strange rules. One of them tried to smite someone for eating a shrimp. I can’t let them do that, can I? Free will doesn’t mean no consequences, right?”
Sam went back to law school to become a public defender. But first, he helped get Jimmy Novak declared legally alive and change his name.
“If we can use my powers to keep dough chilled, why can’t we use them to peel apples?” This was genuine curiosity. “Because you thought up the first idea and not the second?”
. I want to know how long you and I have been living here in Bryan Adams’ playground.” He thought a little too hard to make that reference, and the opening piano to Bryan Adams’ “Heaven” began to play. “Ugh.
This time, there was a proper funeral. Unlike so many losses in their lives, which had been surrounded by chaos and cosmic threats, this one took place in a world with no monsters. The days before were calm, as would be the days after.
“Nah. You both deserve some kinky, non-wrinkly sex. I know better than to get in your way. It’s Heaven so, uh… I’ll be around. Don’t really have a choice.”
“Okay, bad example. How long do I sleep? Why do I sleep? When is my birthday? When is Sam and Eileen’s anniversary? When is Christmas?” The more questions he asked, the more it felt like an existential crisis.
He formed a fist and punched Baby’s door. It hurt, so he did it again. He did it over and over again, dropping closer to the ground with each hit. By the time his knees were on the ground, his hands were bloody.
Castiel spoke in a serious voice. “In millions of years, do you know what the worst moment of my life was?”
Dean spoke his thought process aloud. “The whole point of Heaven is you get to choose, right? That I deserve to be happy...”
There were no days, but each one was better than the last. Game nights, movie nights, road trips across Heaven. Infinite time with infinite family.
Castiel, meanwhile, continued bludgeoning John with his fists. The worst pain he was inflicting couldn’t be seen: his grace, pulling and tearing at John’s soul—flaying pieces from it and incinerating them with sheer energy. John was suffering, and he emitted sounds of pain so guttural they didn’t sound human.
Dean also knew that Sam needed to hear what happened before someone else tried to check in with John and ended up spreading the news. Mary was out of the picture, so it fell on him.
“Uh… Lee and I hit it off. A lot.” Dean paused to steel himself. “We started making out and, well… Dad came back early to find his son knocking boots with a good ol’ country boy. He… he was furious.” Dean stopped and his eyes lost their focus.
Dean stood back cautiously. He didn’t exactly like bugs, and he wasn’t sure whether celestial bees could sting.
“I love you. Not because I have to. Not because I owe you. Because you’re you. Because you’re weird and you’re cute and you make the worst jokes I’ve ever heard. Because I love the way your brain works. You make a better person than most people. You’re kind. I mean, you gave me a damn flower. You know how insane that is?” Dean chuckled a bit. “I love you.”
She gulped down a bite of cake and objected. “Hey! It wasn’t me. Though I did have you pegged about the time you came to visit my cabin and I caughtcha ogling my cowboy posters.”
Dean bit his lip and turned away again. “Cas made a deal with the Empty. If he ever experienced ‘true happiness’ then the shadow would take him. So…” Dean paused and took a breath. He turned back toward Sam, his heart racing. “He told me he loved me, Sam. Like...
Castiel appeared, a bigger mess than before. He stumbled as he landed next to the other recliner. He braced himself against it and snapped, “What now?”
Castiel stood in a flour-covered apron, bewildered, trying and failing to crimp edges. That Dean stood behind him, with his arms wrapped around his waist, only made Castiel more flustered.
Sam had no intention of dropping it, and every intention of summoning Castiel himself. Right then and there. But lucky for Dean, Eileen wasn’t far behind her husband. Freshly introduced into Heaven by her mother, she stepped into the Roadhouse with a big smile on her face.
Taking Taylor’s part wasn’t much of a favor. It left Cas with the rap portions of the song, and he stood tense and awkward as he spoke his way through Ed Sheeran. Dean faced him, mouthing along to the words and encouraging him with a smile. Cas couldn’t help but smile back, even as a small part of him wanted to commit a smiting.
After all the time he spent waiting for his brother to arrive so they could have this exact conversation, Dean wasn’t ready for it. The truth was too difficult to explain, so he settled on his usual self-loathing. “Sam, we’re in
“I don’t know if I ever will be,” Dean said. He scoffed at himself and lowered his head, thinking about just how pathetic that seemed. “I’m...stuck. I know I should be able to get over it. I’m too old for freaking daddy issues—”
Castiel frowned. His gaze landed on a patch of roses to his right, varying in color from a dusty pink to blood red. He’d given one to a date once, and it turned out not to be a date at all—just a coworker who needed a babysitter. But one rejection wasn’t a good enough reason not to try it again. He pulled over, dismounted, and manifested scissors in his hands.
Bobby waved a hand in surrender. “I get it. I won’t tell no one. Not my business. You’ve got a lot to navigate. Anyone asks, you’re just fine. You’re on a... spa retreat for the soul.”
There was a flapping sound, and Ellen looked past Dean. “The angels, genius. You think you’re the only one being tailed by feathers?”
Sounds always echoed in the bunker. At first, Dean thought the noise was coming from Jack’s old room. Then he thought it was the kitchen. Both places were empty, as usual. He stormed down the corridor toward Sam’s room to give that a look—
In every moment since a certain love confession, Dean lived at least partially in a state of panic. That his father wasn’t there lessened it, ever so slightly.
? Did the angels brainwash him again? We need to come up with a plan. We gotta get dad out of there. We gotta fix Cas—”
Castiel sent her to the other side of the room with a gesture of his hand, and set her down gently on the floor. She brought herself to her knees, bounded to a chest in the corner of the room, and began searching for what she wanted. A weapon. One she’d gone through great lengths to acquire.
Castiel glowered. “There’s enough. You didn’t notice that two humans arrived here until I woke up. What’s left of me after my grace is worth nothing to you.”
For a few pop-filled minutes, Dean Winchester was unencumbered by grief, doubt, and shame. If he weren’t dead, Dean could have been a professional singer. He hammed it up for the crowd, leaving the people who knew him stunned and those who didn’t thrilled.
Dean rolled away from the stars to meet his gaze. “But if he was telling the truth, I’m even luckier than I thought.”
Mary noticed the tenderness from the previously rampaging angel. She repeated herself, louder. “You knew Cas was coming here, Dean?”
